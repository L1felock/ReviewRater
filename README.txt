-The best way to start looking at the project is by reading through the final project report pdf

-the project website contains some figures and a very very high level analysis and explanation of the project. It does, however, contain some intuitive and useful figures that were used in the inital research of the potential efficacy of our solution/project. DO NOTE: the website sometimes does not display the word cloud for some reason, and may need to be downloaded and opened on your local machine to be viewable

the project website can be found at:

-if you run the reviewRankerCore... you will need the nltk third party library installed. Also, manipulation of some of the constants at the top of the file will yield greatly varying runtimes.
