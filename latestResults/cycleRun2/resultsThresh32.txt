I was in an accident a few months back and USAA referred me to Gerber Collision, they had my car in and out, and painted perfectly. They replaced the rear bumper and passenger fender. The job was great and they patched my tire up for free! They were very nice and professional. They even gave me a ride to Enterprise Car Rental just as an added bonus. I will go to Gerber every time I need body work done. Hands down.

This is probably the easiest trail that you're ever going to hike besides walking around your block. You only go up an additional 400 plus feet in elevation during the hike. I believe the total loop is a little over 4 miles. This is a great hike for beginners and hiking in groups where you can have casual conversations. There are some rocky parts but mostly this is a dirt trail. This hike at a slow walking pace is about a two hour hike. There are some nice vistas so bring your camera.

Ew, this place is disgusting. We stayed in the fantasy suite building in the "pool suite"-but it would have been more aptly named 'nightmare suite.' Old, dirty, broken... And way overpriced. You couldn't pay me to stay here again.

The whole place feels old, dirty, cheap and trashy. I think you get the point. AVOID!

LOBSTER ICECREAM!!!

is the reason i bookmarked this place. i was excited cuz i was staying at planet hollywood. as i did research, reviews were lukewarm. I tried the lobster icecream and it was ok. I'd rather spend my $ at Earls. if ur a lobster freak, it's worth a looksie as they have many items like lobster grilled cheese, with waffles, lobster rolls- which are $22 for the large ones.

2pm: Lunch at Paris (the off time will help you avoid their notoriously long line) 

6pm: Dinner 1 at Rio

10pm: Dinner 2 at Planet Hollywood (open late until 11pm on Fri and Sat, if Sun-Thurs, make it a 9:15pm dinner)

We are a family of six and moving from a 3200 sq. ft. home is no easy feat.. After interviewing several other moving companies, choosing Creative Moving and Packing was an easy decision. Conrad was professional, knowledgable, and flexible - our closing date changed 3 times and Conrad said, "no problem, we'll make it work".  The employees that packed us up and moved us were friendly and courteous; they helped make one of the most stressful events in life (moving) into a smooth transition for me and my family. I highly recommend this company for any type of move.

I just went into the MAC store today because I lost my favorite lip gloss (maybe it fell underneath my car seat?) anyway the gal who greeted me was very helpful.  Luckily there was a card on me so my last purchase was recorded.  She was able to find the color of my lost lip gloss.  She also told me that a percentage of the sale of this particular gloss goes to help Aids.  Interesting. I bought two lip glosses. I'm happy the store isn't far from where I work in case I lose another lip gloss.

Neiman Marcus meet Salvation Army. Salvation Army meet Neiman Marcus. Nice. 

Wow. A vintage/thrift store that doesn't smell like my Aunt Helen's wig closet. No stench of mothballs, decaying bodies or stale smoke from an old pack of Capri Ultra Light Menthol 120s. 

Organized. Well staffed. Well, staffed by people who are actually engaging and interested in you. Unlike SO many other similar shops in this area where you get a little bit of "OH, you are so lucky to peruse my crap" attitude. 

Most importantly...great stuff. Vintage Italian dishware (think Fiesta with a Tuscan twist), Disney movie stills, framed, and selling for a mere Abraham and an entire case of well lit (much like myself at the time of shopping) Prada, Jimmy Choo and Minola Blanaks!! Just my luck! None in my size.

I ordered a couple of carne asada tacos and a large soda for $7.77. They have that soda dispenser that can deliver just about any soda known to man. They were out of the Diet Dr. Pepper so I was saying no bueno until I saw that they had Diet Barq's Rootbeer. Nice save!

The two carne asada tacos I had were basically two of the smallest tacos that I have ever seen. The taste was so so. They have a great outdoor patio and plenty of room in the dining area.

But I don't see myself coming back to America's Taco Shop.

Conrad was creative and flexible, solved every challenge; he called me along the drive out, and every step of the way to my arrival. Robert was my "Guardian Angel" on the trip; He made it Fun! (well, as much fun as you can have moving). I so appreciate all the hard work, the integrity and genuine care that they took to get me to my new home. All the "stuff" made the trip in great sted!

Over the years, I've been in a lot of sheet metal; Ferrari, Porsche, Bentley, you name it.

I've also been fortunate enough to have driven at the Charlotte Motor Speedway when it first reopened in several different cars.  But I have no idea what to say about Tesla, except something humorless about their cars not needing a cigarette lighter.

I've seen quite a few around town. And yes, it's a very nice car but... $122K for a Model S? I'll admit there's certainly a je nes se qua to them that attracts folks.  The stock price is another story. Really.  

The showroom also seems to do a brisk business in shirts, hats, et cetera.

But I hope they survive, live long and prosper.  If only because I don't want to hear about them being an electric deLorean.

Enjoy!  If you can.

Shhhhhh! can you keep a secret?  

We stumbled upon a secret pizzeria in the new Cosmopolitan hotel.

It was 3 in the morning and we roll in jonesin for some food.
Nico was such a sweetheart, he told us stories, listened to ours, and gave us advice on life, love, and all things worldly.  He was like an elder teaching us life lessons while he kneaded dough and turned it into pizza for us!

It literally turned from this.....

       _.'      `._  )

  _(________)___

Into this...in a matter of 20 minutes
                               
               . ------------.
               \-------------/

                     \&8/
                       \*/

Great pizza, nice crust, and awesome company.  Nico hooked us up and managed to teach us about life all in 30 minutes.  He made me feel like I was in Italy and if this was his pizzeria he'd have given us the pizza for free!  Nico made our trip a memorable one.

It was a spur of the moment thing and happy that it happened! I met up with Rand H, Norm R & Scott W to try the Reign of Thai buffet on a Sunday afternoon.

Every item in the buffet looked delish and fresh,  I tried a variety of things and enjoyed them all, egg rolls, chicken won tons, pad thai, beef massaman curry, chicken pangang curry just to name a few.   Massaman curry is my favorite curry, and normally I chose chicken but the beef was good too!

Service was friendly and learned from the server that it was her aunt and uncle who cooked all the dishes.

Sundays buffet was 10.99 and it is very much worth the price! If I am ever in the area again you bet I will be back!

I've been here a couple of times. It's decent cheap food. The owner's like to call it the Italian Chipotle. 

Basically you go thru the line like an assembly line and order your pasta and then the toppings and then pay. I think the angel hair pasta works perfectly for this type of eatery. First timers usually get crazy and load up on the toppings. I just get a meat item and some marinara sauce. They give you a bunch of pasta in your bowl so you won't leave that place hungry.

Tickety Tacky in only the best way possible.  I actually really like this place.  The neon lights reminds me of my mothers make up in the 90's.

Nick the waiter was a sweetheart.  I am ridiculous in my requests sometimes, but he managed to cater to all of them.

The portions are huge!   My steak and spinach salad was delicious!  The steak was tender and medium rare just as I requested.  I asked for candied walnuts in it and Nick brought me a bowl of them!  That's what I call service.

Late night eats in Vegas!  I'll definitely be back!

Just moved into the area and went to this location. It was so busy but staff was very helpful as I'm not used to this store and couldn't find the things I usually get. One time I went to another store and there was a demo of waffles with pomegranate seeds and yoghurt on it.  At this store there was a  sample with Belgian waffles, strawberries, and whipped cream...delicious!  So I bought the waffles and they were so cheap! I also love their Mediterranean feast meal. They have so many different items and prices are very reasonable. I find that I go to Trader Joe's a lot because of the variety of products and the atmosphere. I highly recommend Trader Joe's.

Three Birds left and pounds of Steel makes for good target practice! 

The Pittsburgh Steelers have one of the best records in football history. They have won 5 out of 42 Super Bowls. Only 3 teams have won 5 and that is the Steelers, the Cowboys and the SF 49's. Seeing the Steelers are the only one of those three in the playoffs, they could break all records this year, by winning 6 Super Bowls. IF they go to the Super Bowl again this year, it will be their 7TH appearance.

IF, is the biggest word in the English language. If my grandmother had 4 wheels, she would be a box car. 

I was not thrilled when Bill Cowher left the Steelers, but I must say Mike Tomlin has done a fine job and we were blessed, to have had two great coaches. 

I have been an avid collector of autographed sports memorabilia for many, many years. I have quite a lot of autographed Steelers merchandise, including a football jersey signed by the Steel Curtain. 

I can't help but admire that more and more each week and think of how Mean Joe Green and LC Greenwood will be watching the games, with nerves of steel and how Ernie Holmes and Mad Dog Dwight White will be smiling down upon Big Ben, Willie Parker, Hines Ward, Troy Polamalu, Harrison, Holmes and the rest of the team. 

This week the Steelers have home field advantage of a ridiculous time of 6:30 against the Ravens. The Ravens play hard and rough and my fingers are crossed that we beat them for a third time this year. 

Everyone is thinking of how great it would be to have a PA. Super Bowl. I went to Heinz Field for the 2004 Eagles/Steelers game. I drove from Philadelphia along with Eagles Fans galore. We won and it was an awesome ride home. 

GO STEELERS!! You rock my world! Give me one for the other hand!

I visited Al-Hana for the first time today for an Unofficial Yelp Event with Rand H., Robyn N., Mike C., Jackie C. and the other Jon H. I enjoyed some great Hummus and Pita Bread plus my main course of Lamb Kafta for $8.99 and a can of soda for $.099; this meal set me back $10.75 today.

Prior to arriving, I perused some reviews and the menu. Pro Tip - this place is not located in the ghetto as some reviewers have mentioned. I did not have to use any of my martial arts training to get into and out of the restaurant. There was decent parking at about 11:10 when I got there. 

As I'm writing this review 4 hours later, I can tell you that I'm still stuffed. I really enjoyed my food along with conversations with my awesome lunch companions. Thanks to Rand for "inviting" me. I probably would have not tried this place otherwise.

Sorry to ruin the party concerning the high Yelp rating for this company, but this is my story. 

I called these guys and we agreed that they would come over to my house at 4pm for a regular service call. So I took off some time from the office to meet them at my house. I called them at 4:10pm and asked them what was going on, I had to leave a message. After a few minutes, they called me back and said they didn't have a technician near my house since they were in other parts of the valley so we would have to reschedule. WTF?

I rescheduled for the next week and while they called me about 15 minutes before the scheduled appointment, I told them that I was in another part of the valley and couldn't make the appointment. I then continued with my awesome lunch.

This location is in Green Valley just off the 215 freeway.

TOTAL meltdown in service. Slow and non apologetic about the service from the management. Wasn't just me, it was all tables and they keep filling em up no matter what. Was there 1 1/2 hours and couldn't even get dessert. CRAZY!

Huge food portions, blah nothing to taste but presentation of the food was nice.

Lack of leadership with excuses. Didn't really care too much about excuses as I'm the customer and went with an expectation of quality food and professional service.
Neither was delivered on this visit.

Just used them to move from Ahwatukee to Central Phoenix and these guys were outstanding! I've moved 5 times in the Phoenix area and each move has had problems. One time the movers didn't bring enough wardrobes. I didn't have any problems with Creative. Jesse and Eric were terrific! They were very fast and professional. I had to store my stuff for a week because my new place wasn't ready and Conrad (the owner) quoted me a fair price. They are the best and deserve all the great reviews. I have no complaints about this moving company and highly recommend them. One thing I appreciated was fact Conrad always answered my emails and was in constant contact with me about the move. It relieves a lot of stress when you have a professional mover. I called a lot of movers but based my decision on Yelp. I always use Yelp to find local businesses.

Yet another really good burger option for the Chandler/101 area!

Over the last few months we've gotten a Smash Burger and now a Burger21 last week. If UR into red meat, how can you go wrong?

I came here to grab something for a late night at the office and Burger21 hit the roof of my flavortown mouth. Sorry Fieri!  LOL

I kept it simple. The cardiac arrest Blue Cheese and Bacon burger for only $7.95 and a Chocolate Malt ($4.95) to wash it down. Both were good. 

Expect to pay $12 or so, if you order a soft drink. Don't  those iced cold beers looked good? There's a real high probably I'll be back with some co-workers real soon.

I would give them negative stars if it was possible! One star is WAY TO GRACIOUS! HAD A HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE WITH TIVEGAS! 

Upon coming back to our room after a wedding last night we found a disturbing man leaving OUR ROOM with a bag full of all our valuables!!! After confronting him, the crazed man grabbed my husband by the throat and ran through the SERVICE ELEVATOR ROOM, using the SERVICE ELEVATOR to escape! Those elevators have to have keys and the hotel receptionist said she has worked there 9 years and doesn't know how to work those elevators!! SKETCHY!!! 

On top of the terror, security was sluggish and ON OUR FLOOR witnessing the attack and did NOT RUN, they walked, strolled even, over to us allowing the man to escape and offering only to write a report "IF WE WANTED TO". Security then proceeded to try to persuade us to NOT FILE A POLICE REPORT!!! SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS SECURITY SYSTEM?! Isn't safety supposed to be the most important??? I don't think TI Vegas has that priority AT ALL. 

And to ice this cake of a stay, TI VEGAS Risk Management NEVER filed a note or report to hotel staff/management to inform them of the breach of safety, as well as REFUSED to compensate for the room for our stay. UNREAL, never ever coming back and you are all warned!

The dealers are ornery but I don't care.
Everyone says this place is run down but I don't think so.  It seems good to me, maybe a bit dated with their decor, but I'm here to gamble and get drunk.  Who cares what it looks like?
I always win so every time I'm in Vegas I come here for a bit to make me some money.

What happened to you, Rain!? You're like a celebrity, once glamorous and incredibly popular, but that has fallen into obscurity. You used to be the posh spot, the happenin' talk of the town... but now you're overused, dirty, discarded. 

This review is long overdue and almost joined Rain by also falling into obscurity.

The layout is still cool, the music still poppin', but never in my life have I come across SO MANY ROAMING HANDS in one place. How shady can a place be such that at least 75% of the male population is trying to violate the females?!? I'd be dancing and suddenly a hand had appeared up my skirt and all the way up my thigh. I immediately moved away and noticed my lady friends were undergoing the same horror from other men. 

I was uncomfortable on the dance floor, and that NEVER happens. I love to dance and meet people and have a great time, but I'm not about to put myself out there for THAT. Gross!

Let's just say I won't be back. Ever. Unless they have a successful Perv Purge movement.

I saw the fishbowl and I knew right away I was in.  
They hypnotize you 
They seduce you, every act more titillating than the next
They make you sell your soul to the man next to you
You forget everything
You wake up and the next moment you're sitting in a vat of writhing bodies
Will you obey?

I'm sore.  I guess that means I did.

PS- If you're looking for a conservative show, this probably isn't for you and your family.  But the crude humor, the scantily clad muscled men (wrap him up i'll take him to go) and barely there women.  This was definitely my kinda show.  Crazy moves, random stunts, perverted jokes...This was definitely perfect for me.

Don't get seats in the front rows if you don't want to be called on.  :)

Ted's is a Phoenix original by way of Buffalo and has probably fed tens of thousands ASU students and teachers over the years.

Ted's history is similar to that of other Hot Dog pioneers like Paul and Betty Pink, Nathan Handwerker, and Dick Portillo. All who started with just a Hot Dog cart, and grew their business into something very special. 

But Ted's is the immigrant story of Theodore Spiro Liaros, who came to the US from Greece at the turn of the last century.  

One of these days, someone will take the time to write the history of all the hard working Greeks who came here with just the shirt on their back, to start a restaurant or food business.

But I digress, because you come to Ted's to enjoy the charcoal grilled hot dogs and hamburgers and all the friendly conversation on line. Ahh, and those charcoals are white hot (see photo), which makes their food oh so delicious.  

They have Hot Dogs, Hamburgers, Brats, Italian Sausages, French Fries and home made beer batter like Onion Rings (photo), along with Milk Shakes and Malts.

Ted's is really just great food, served simply. I can highly recommend those afore mentioned All Beef Hot Dogs, Sausage and Onion Rings. All the tube steaks are $3.79 and you can take home some of their special bottled mustard for $5.39 as I did.

Enjoy!

This is a nice casual place to get some fish. They cook it up anyway you want it (cue Journey), whether it be fried, grilled, blackened, etc.

I have ordered the Taco Mountain every time I've been there. You have a choice of other types of meat besides fish. I always go for the fish. I find that the fish is always fresh and cooked just right. The next time I go in there I'll have to order something different. Pro Tip - This place is a zoo during Fridays when Lent is in season. When you can't find a parking spot, you might as well go with Plan B.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 40/100

Quite a pleasure to see while visiting Vegas! There is a huge lake in front of the Bellagio hotel, which is where the water fountain show takes place every 15-30 minutes. My boyfriend and I recently watched it this past weekend and it was wonderful! The particular show we watched was played along to the song, "All That Jazz." 

As much as I loved watching these fountains, I still think that I wasn't as impressed as I could have been. I've watched World Of Color at California Adventure in Anaheim, CA, and I think that World Of Color is MUCH more impressive than the Fountains of Bellagio. Don't get me wrong, the Bellagio fountains are great and definitely the landmark on the strip, BUT they aren't the best I've ever seen.

Caribbean, mon!
Some water in the desert.
Get the chili dog!

Dillon's is a chain down in Arizona.  BBQ is their specialty.  Kind of like the Famous Dave's of the Southwest.  Have been to the Glendale location in the past.  Solid.  This place brings it to another level.  Situated on Lake Pleasant, just outside of old timers land in NW Phoenix burbs. 

They have a vernicular to get you down to the Lake? How cool is that? I am sure that I will appreciate that in my later ages when I retire down there in my golden years.  Look at the old guy getting busy!:

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dillons-morristown?select=wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqA#wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqA

Anyways, their chili dog is out of this world.  See my picture.  Comes on a hamburger bun with two sliced dogs, topped with cheese and jalapenos and BBQ pulled pork.  Just died and went to heaven.  Gives the Gopher Bar a run for its money. 4.99999!

I was very excited to be chosen for this event, and not just because I got a sneak preview of J-WoW's sweater.  It was also to be the first time the lunch bunch would meet our cyber friend, Kazi, in person.

The venue was fantastic, located between 2 parking garages, next to an outdoor ice rink.  Upon arriving at the registration table, I spied the Santa photo op, so I grabbed Kazi for her first ever Yelp Elite photo (show some love and friend our newest Elite)

While at the bar, I indulged in a cherry vanilla porter, and I liked it.  The trio of ample hummus bowls were a delight, and I'm not ashamed to admit returning for seconds.

The hot chocolate was the finest I've ever tasted, especially after adding peppermint syrup and a heaping mound of whipped cream. 

While the food and beverage was delightful, the conversation was the high point, and I was lucky enough to spend a few minutes with the beautiful and engaging Kazi.  I loved seeing my friends... and meeting new Yelpers face to face is the icing on the cookie! (which there were a lot of)

I witnessed my first ever ugly Christmas poncho when J-WoW's +1, Linh, made his grand entrance.  Santa Sat on my lap, and my cheek was kissed by a pretty little lady who disappeared into the crowd. 

All in all, a pretty good night

I vividly remember my first bite of their red velvet cupcake 8 years ago at their Beverly Hills location.  I'd never had cupcake like that before or since.  There have been copycats sneaking their way into Las Vegas over the years with mixed results and never living up to Sprinkles for me.  They finally made it and I am psyched!  

Yeah so 6 cupcakes costs $22.50.  I was surprised when the cashier asked me if those were for here or to go but then I saw a guy with 6 of them at a table by himself.  Damn, dude.

We ordered 3 red velvet, a peanut butter chip, lemon meringue and black & white.  Those other 3 were nice and all but it's all about the red velvet.  The cake was perfectly moist and the frosting is like no other.  Funny how they put the takeout box into a resealable plastic bag...like drugs.  I am sure Sprinkles is well aware of their addictive qualities.

Even the line on Sunday at 11pm was about 15 minutes.  Looking forward to giving the cupcake ATM a whirl when the line is an hour plus.

Not absolutely sure if this is the first business of this business model to open in the 702, but I am absolutely sure that it is the newest and only business of this kind currently in operation.

Cafe Teaze is what I would considered a hybrid business model combining a boba tea shop and a Vietnamese coffee shop (just Google or Bing it if you want to know more).  Specifically, the menu is what you would normally find at a boba tea house in California and the waitstaff are all bikini or lingerie clad women. The best part for me and I am sure for the target market is that these waitstaff are friendly and beautiful, and could easily transition from serving you boba milk tea to fitting right in at import model photo shoots.

What can you order here?  11 types of milk teas (from the simple milk tea to Ma-Cha Ice Cream Milk Green Tea with or without boba), 5 different iced flavor teas (Lychee Green Tea and Passion Fruit Black Tea are what look the most appealing to me right off the bat), 6 varieties of Flavored Snow Ice, 5 hot milk tea options and 9 snacks (popcorn chicken, fried wontons, and spiral potato just to rattle off a few).

Let's be frank here, even if your name is not Frank or Francis Underwood, I am here first and foremost for the eye candy, without getting hassle for doing the looking. That reality is what the proprietor is relying on in attracting new customers. However, the beverage and food are what the owners are banking on for lots and lots of repeat business after the novelty wears off a bit.

For me hopefully the novelty will never wear off :)

Green has the best vegan food in Phoenix. Weather or not if you are vegan, there is something there for you. Very artsy inside, fantastic staff, amazing "soynamis" AKA a vegan DQ Blizzard. They have a small grocery area in the front as well, all vegan but all amazing. I always get their special without even looking and have never been let down. The spicy Po Boy, and the Mexicali Burger are my fav off the menu, you also get a side and I never stray from the delicious curry pasta salad. On top of it all, they are very fair priced, 2 meals, 2 drinks, and 2 deserts, usually runs about $20. That's great for in house made healthy food.

Bryan's Black Mountain Barbeque is definitely at the top of the Barbeque Mountain in the Phoenix metro area. They have plenty of seating both inside and outside the restaurant.

This place is busy and for good reason. You line up and give your order and pay. They also have many different types of sodas, tea and lemonade housed in a giant dispenser where you program what you want via touch screen. They call out your name when your order is ready. 

I really like the brisket and have enjoyed the ribs as well. They have a station where the heated BBQ Sauce is dispensed from a dispenser similar to how you get your ketchup. They season their fries with a lot of salt/spices so ask for plain fries if you're not into the salty/spicy fries. Their beans are also mighty tasty if you decide to go in that direction.

I just wish this place was a lot closer to my house because I love climbing that BBQ Mountain.

The Chandelier is a multi-story love bar in the middle of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. It's a memorable setting with memorable drinks and plenty of unique couches, seats, and tables. It's easy to find a spot just right for you and your friends.

Plus one star for having several flavors of Hangar One Vodka available!

Another bonus star for super friendly, but efficient servers. No complaints at all.

My wife rated the Cosmopolitan hotel's house Cosmopolitan ($15) her favorite drink in Vegas. If she's happy, then I'm happy. 

I was looking for something different and tried a cocktail called Bruce Tea ($14) with Kai Coconut Pandanus Vodka, St. George Thai Basil Eau de Vie, Lemongrass-infused Coconut Cream, Birdseye Chili, Ginger Puree, Kaffir Lime Leaves, and sprinkled with Matcha Tea Powder. It was too different. I switched to Hangar One Mandarin and Tonic ($14) for the rest of the evening.

If you are staying or visiting the Cosmopolitan Hotel, it will be hard to miss the giant crystal strands of the Chandelier. It may not be a destination bar, but it is the best bar at the Cosmopolitan. Don't miss the opportunity to relax for a few rounds of drinks.

"Thank you for calling Cox Communications. My name is Melika. How may I assist you today?"
"Hello Melika. I'd like pay the minimum on our cable bill please."
"OK sir. I would be happy to assist you with this today. May I please have your PIN."
"I have no idea what our PIN is. I"m sorry. What other information may I give you."
"The social security number for the primary customer."
"Oh, well that's my partner and I'm not sure what it is. I have our address, phone number, our account number..."
"Yes sir, well I do understand that you have that information, I will not be able to assist you."
"OK Melika. Look honey. I'm trying to GIVE you money. I'm not changing my plan or even making fun of your dumb ass company yet. Just wanna GIVE you money."
"Without your PIN or social security number I cannot tell you the minimum due but I can take a payment."
"Oh. Well now we're getting somewhere. Melika. By the way, we're you named after a coffee maker? Great let's pay $165 like I did last month and see where that gets us."
"Thank you sir for you payment. And, yes, I was named after a coffee maker. Thank you for choosing Cox Communications for all your media and digital needs. Have a nice day."
Two days later. Our cable and internet is turned off. Because she could not tell me my minimum amount and I was short by $4.83. Our services were turned off. And I didn't "choose" Cox. It was forced on me like Catholicism and puberty. Cox? You suck!

I love this place!  I noticed a lot of people there and wondered if it was worth the trip.  I wasn't disappointed.  On the day I went, I had a vegieburger and it was really good, came with a salad and blue chips. I brought half of it home and had the other half for dinner.  I also ordered a drink that was cherry and chocolate (delicious).  I am a big fan and would go more but it is a little expensive.  Also took a slice of the chocolate pomegranate cake (their signature dish) and it was really outstanding.  I shall return!

Carrot Top elicits such a negative knee jerk reaction from so many.  It's like asking people at a pizza joint if they want anchovies.  When was the last time you actually had anchovies??  The guy has been a Vegas headliner since 2005.  There's got to be a reason why he's been able to stick it out on the strip and fill seats in that theater for the long haul while so many headline comedians have come and gone.  One year they're at the Excalibur, then The Plaza and then there's their one way ticket to Laughlin. 

I didn't think I would enjoy the show as much as I did.  He opened the show at a frenetic pace going from prop joke to prop joke.  Didn't think the joke was funny?  No problem!  There's another one in 5 seconds.  It was like watching the biggest 5 year old wise ass with A.D.D. show off his box of toys.  Freakin hilarious!!  The rest of the show was just as great.  You'll definitely laugh a lot and have a fun time unless you don't laugh at cock jokes.  So yeah....eunuchs may be sensitive to Carrot Top. 

We sat in the second to last row.  There's not a bad seat in the house.  You can purchase the cheapest seats without hesitation if you're still skeptical.

Over the last decade, we've had a few problems with our Lexus cars.  And, now for the rest of the story...

About eight years ago I was driving our five year old RX-300 from Seattle to Chicago, so one of our kids could use it at college.  We were outside of Bismarck, ND when all the lights on the dash lit up warning us that the car was about to fail.  The nearest dealership at that time was in St Paul, MN.  Yeah, I know LOL.

So after calling Lexus for advice, off we drove very nervously to MN.  We arrived safely around 5pm and waited nearly three hours for them to look at the car.  It was confirmed that the RX had some sort of unknown oil sludge build-up in the engine and that the engined needed to be replaced!  Replaced? Eesch!

We were asked various questions on where we had our service work done.  After verifing that we had all of our work done at the dealership in WA state, they offered us a Loaner.  Ummm I said, we're driving on to Chicago.  Not to worry, they would flatbed the car to us when it was repaired and to keep the Loaner.  Out of pocket costs?  Nothing!

Now, that story is eight years old and it reminds me of our current experience with our ES.  Seems the NAV & bluetooth link doesn't want to accept the new iPhone.  Yeah, I know, Apple right? LOL. After several attempts by us and the dealer, they are now replacing the entire system. Out of pocket costs?  Nothing!

We have owned other cars and have spent lots of $$$ with replair work, but no one backs up their cars like Lexus.  No one. Peace of mind? Priceless!

Encore Beach Club is G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S. Kaskade Sundays is what's up. Like Wet Republic and Rehab, it's all about scene and be seen - you will be surrounded by beautiful bodies. Unlike Wet and Rehab, you will NOT be afraid to get into the pool! 

Mr. Wynn did an amazing job getting this luxurious beach club built in a matter of months. It's located at the front of Encore - I don't even recall them being under construction when I was there in April. The layout is beautiful with three pools and two levels of cabanas, and rainfall "cages" with a stripper pole in the center if you want to show off your skills. 

Kaskade definitely brings the party on Sundays, but the vibe is definitely more chill than Wet and Rehab (hence the cleaner pools). He's set up right in the middle in front of Surrender (the nightclub) and there's a small area for people to dance. 

We got in for free (doesn't hurt to know the promoters), however cover is $30 for women and $50 for men. You'll easily drop $100+ on drinks, so you might want to consider reserving a lounge chair ($150 drink minimum) or if you can splurge, reserved a day bed or cabana (some with your own personal see-through pool), which will run you thousands. Otherwise you can grab a towel and post up along the edge of the pool.

There are two bar areas, a few tables to gamble and "The Grill" to order food. Share a few salads, which are huge, and the turkey club wrap - the more healthy options on the menu. Food babies are not attractive here.

The newest kid on the strip is still the sexiest!

Yup, as soon as you walk into the lobby, you are invited in with the allure of large glass columns with ever changing themes. Chic mirrors and chandeliers dripping with crystals from the ceiling and everything around you just seems to sparkle with a sleek, sexy flare that is all Vegas. 

I checked in for the July 4th weekend and got up sold by a very aggressive front desk clerk that insisted on getting me into the penthouse.  I settled for a 910sq. ft. angle suite on the 58th floor with additional Japanese soaking tub, terrace with a view of the Bellagio fountains, kitchenette with fridge & microwave and an additional full sized bath with shower. Not too shabby.   

The room I must say was very spacious, the view off the expansive terrace was breathtaking and i used the soaking tub practically every night after the clubs so it worked out great!

My only complaint was with housekeeping.  There's a circular red paper note you're supposed to leave on the bed to have your linens changed, which i did but every night i came back to the room, my sheets were done but not changed! It was ridonkulous! Even the dirty pillow that had some sketchy black skid mark smeared on it (that i never used from day one) remained in my room til the last day i was there....nuts!

Perhaps all the smoke and mirrors at the entrance lobby had me blinded by the hotel's sexy charm but with all due respect, my stay was very enjoyable and despite the minor flaws, I had a fantastic time... 

With that said, the hotel was conveniently located in the heart of the strip. It's steps away from the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood and Paris...and the Sahra Spa, brunch and pool were very enjoyable...and partying at the Marquee & Bond was priceless!


Happy Times!

Scary things to me:
Paris Hilton has a career. 
Sarah Palin. Really. She's like the new Anita Bryant. 
My fathers' overgrown eyebrows. Trim, daddy, trim!
Droves of high schoolers leaving school just as I'm trying to find Barrio Cafe. 

Seriously. Like thousands of them. And I couldn't find the damn restaurant. What was I gonna do? Roll down the window (well, not roll down, seriously, who rolls down windows anymore?) and holler out in my best lispy voice, "Hey, squeeze me fellas, I'm going to a wine tasting at the Barrio Cafe. Y'all know where that is?" Since all teenagers carry guns, yes, that scared me. 

Finally. I found it. And entered. 

Cute. Cozy. Middle of the day, so empty. Great, vibrant art. And a very attentive and friendly staff. Often times at this time of day, restaurants really drop the ball. No ball dropping here.
I had La Paloma margarita which is made with a grapefruit soda. Think Squirt and Patron! And after a couple of these babies I was in el bano squirting out that Patron. Dee lish however. 

I ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar. Enchiladas of the Sea for my non Spanish speaking peeps. You know what? It was good. Not great. And the presentation was somewhat messy. I couldn't find the crab or the scallops (which were the size of the ends of q-tips by the way). They were lost in the sauce and the cheese. But I devoured it as the blue corn tortillas sang to me. My friend had a chickent torta. Big and rustic. Like Janet Reno. She loved it! 

I will most definitely be back. Hopefully I will not have to navigate through the plethora of pubescent people and hopefullyl I will pick that Barrio menu item that will blow my calcentinas off. 

Oh. That's blow my socks off. BTW. Adios for now mi yelpitas!

I'd say the majority of Celine Dion music I've heard in life has been from dentist offices.  Needless to say, they aren't fond memories.  I clearly link "Because You Loved Me" to drilling sounds and a big light in my face.

But you have GOT to be dead inside if you don't feel something when she hits those big notes in tunes like "Power of Love" or "All By Myself" in a live setting. As a case in point, I heard a wife ask her husband what he thought of the show while exiting, and his answer was "eh".  He looked a shade under 139 years old!  Almost dead!

Not to say the show was all roses.  I found her version of "Live and Let Die" to be punchless and uninspiring.  Especially after seeing Axl's version multiple times a few weeks earlier.  

Glad I saw the show but no way in heck would I ever pay for this.  I sat stage left in the rear orchestra and a seat retailed for $175 before tax and service fees.  It's only worth it for big time fans.  Plenty of those were in attendance.  Watching people lose their minds to the "Titanic" song was very, very interesting.

"....and I think to myself, what a wonderful world." - "What a Wonderful World",- Louie Armstrong

Great show by a talented performer!

I watched the beginning of Terry Fator's meteoric rise to Las Vegas headliner on America's Got Talent several years ago.  To describe Terry - he is a singing impressionist ventriloquist comedian.  He does spot-on impersonations & sings better via ventriloquism than others do through their own accord.  It was w/ great anticipation that I finally caught his Vegas show in his very own theatre.

To be frank, this show may be not be everyone's cup of tea.  He is, after all, using puppets.  However, I'm a big fan!  His impressions of past & present performers, such as Cher, Dean Martin, Stevie Wonder & Adele are brilliant.  His comedy sketches are witty & current.  I thought it may have became a little edgy for some w/ one of his puppets "coming out the closet", but I thought it was hilarious.

Terry also sings a few original songs sans puppets during the show.  One entitled "Horses in Heaven" & the other a tribute to the troops.  "Horses in Heaven" is based on a true story of a child w/ cancer.  He mentioned to the audience that the Las Vegas powers that be thought  the song was too heavy & not appropriate for a Vegas show during it's development.  He defied the powers that be, and I enjoyed the song, which made me think of my own experience w/ cancer.  

Our show just happened to be the very one that surpassed 1 million guests to see Terry Fator's Vegas show.  Even better, everyone in attendance received a Terry Fator reusable bag w/ the following contents-

Terry Fator playing cards
2 for 1 at Mirage's Cravings buffet
$10 Free Slot Play w/ the Mirage Player's Card

I took that $10 Free Slot Play & magically turned it into $66 on a $1 slot machine!  Oh yeah, I'm good :)
It was my last night in Vegas, and capped an already great trip.

I highly recommend catching Terry Fator's show at the Mirage during your next trip to Vegas.  I laughed, I was moved & I had an absolute great time.

Excelsior!

The Brits have an expression, "Smart by half.' 

I was driving up Scottsdale Road and noticed this new location. I have been on Which Wich's mailing list for a while and remember getting a "Reverse Happy Hour buy one, get one free offer through August 15th" email .

I ordered two medium turkey sandwiches, with extra meat ($3.00 up charge) and a soda.  My thinking was that one would be free and the bill would be around $10.00 or so.  Instead I was told it would be $19.16. Seems the offer reads "order any regular size Wich and get the second Wich free".  Silly me.

The two mediums weighted almost two pounds each.  They felt really, really heavy.  I was impressed. But without that credit, it would have been nearly $27 for those two subs and one drink. Wow

So yesterday I thought I would try the same exercise, but with two "Regular" sized sandwiches.  Without ordering a drink, my bill came to $6.41 and the two subs combined weight barely a pound.

At this point I'm giving up on comparison tests. I'll be sticking to Jimmy Johns or Jersey Mike's.  BTW, both places were empty and it took nearly ten minutes to get my order. So maybe, "Subs, So Slow You'll Freak?" LOL

Sorry, Two Stars and  "Meh. I've experienced better."

SLS = STAY THE F*CK AWAY

What, the acronym doesn't match? Well, it doesn't f*cking matter, because you should avoid this place like the f*cking plague.

Here is a (too long) list of things that went wrong during our less-than-48-hours stay:

1. The elevator in the attached parking structure broke down TWICE for extended periods of time.

2. LiFE Nightclub didn't let anyone in until about 11:30 Friday night despite a HUGE line outside because of an isolated power outage.

3. THERE WAS NO HOT WATER FOR AT LEAST 6 HOURS ON ONE OF THE NIGHTS. THIS IS THE MIDDLE OF F*CKING VEGAS WINTER AND YOU HAVE NO HOT WATER?! SERIOUSLY?!

4. Despite all of the above, it still took me and my dad hours of bitch-mayhem at the front desk to get our ridiculous $28/night resort fee waived.

5. Housekeeping was EXTREMELY cheap. Used up toiletries were NOT replaced the second day.

I would give this place zero stars if Yelp allowed it. But since I'm forced to give it at least one star, I will say that the hotel rooms do have cool illuminated infinity mirrors. But that's it.

Where other companies implode old hotels and rebuild something new and magnificent, SBE only slightly remodeled the old Sahara.

NEVER AGAIN.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 43/100

Pretty decent hotel. The only time I've ever stayed here was when I was a child so I don't remember too much of it. 

LOCATION: 
More towards the south end of the strip, across the street from New York New York.

EXTERIOR:
Look for the big green building with the big lion in the front. The entryway/lobby/drop off/pick up area is actually not located directly on the strip, but rather around the corner along the cross street that runs perpendicular to the strip.

INTERIOR:
HUGE HUGE HUGE lobby. Much larger than a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's pretty nice! They also have a pretty decent sized casino as well, and the theater where they host the KA Cirque du Soleil show is surprisingly ginormous. I was so surprised that that size of a theater was inside this hotel. 

SHOPPING:
Unfortunately, the shops at this hotel are pretty crappy. Nothing interesting except for a bunch of souvenir shops, and places where you can get everything bad for you - alcohol and sweets.

I feel like MGM used to be good, but with the addition of all of the newer hotels on the strip, it's losing its game. So unfortunate since MGM owns so many of the hotels on the strip!

My favorite part of Vegas - right here.

Sure it's nice to walk around in the daytime, but it's better in the night. Why? Because that's when everything is completely lit up! Keep those cameras handy when you're walking around here. You can even take some pictures of certain areas of the strip when you're walking on the "overhead" crosswalks. It's not just the lights to enjoy, but also some of the free shows that are available, including Mirage's Volcano and Bellagio's Dancing Water Fountains.

Be mindful of your surroundings when walking around, especially in the night. Sure it's touristy, but as what some other reviewers pointed out, there were some sketchy people hanging around (panhandlers, con artists, etc.). For this reason, I take away one star.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely be back here!

When the king of pop decided against "Beautiful Young Thing" for his epic 1982 album, Thriller, that set the wheels in motion for what we know today as BYT.

When this place is packed, and it gets packed, you'll be doing the moonwalk as patrons enter and exit by means of any open crevice between you and the other line-mongers.  Michael was so right... You Are Not Alone, but tough it out, because once you sink those bleached choppaz into your first bite, you'll Wanna Be Startin Somethin.

I can personally vouch for the carne asada, chicked and birria tacos, with the later being my favorite.  My wife and I split a carne, cheese and bean burrito.  My only complaint was the fatty chunks, and the gristle.  I wont ding them too hard, as they were totally slammed.

The biggest disappointment of the night came in a styrofoam cup.  The side of frijoles we ordered had to have been from a can... like a can of Rosarita.  I can see them needing a fallback with as  busy as they were, its possible they could have sold out of the good stuff.  I wont know for sure, until my return visit.  I use Elmer's Tacos or Rancho Market as my bean baseline, so be on your A game guys, because based on The Way You Make Me Feel will determine if I'm going to continue to Rock With You, or not... because I will Remember The Time.

I also polished off an order of chips & salsa, a Mexican coke and a large horchata... so I left pre-diabetic and pretty stuffed... so much that I almost didn't recognize that Man In The Mirror.

Vegas requires a surprisingly large amount of thinking. Does the club pay for the cab? Sometimes. One-guy-one-girl rule? Usually. Be sure to tip... or not. Buy her a drink... or not.  $30 cover?? 

Did I just go to a strip club or do my taxes?

I'm at a point in my life where i'm trying to find meaning and depth in the world... and this is the last place in the last city I should be in. It just doesn't do it for me. But it's always good to try new things, and thus lovable Yelper, AJ, made sure I didn't leave without getting my first lap dance.

Keane: So.. uh... what are you into?
Girl: *surprised look*
Keane: Uh.. I meant... things to do.
Girl: I've been going to a lot of late night clubs... Oh! You have really soft hair. What do you use?
Keane: ... shampoo.

*examines my shirt*

Girl: What is "Yelp"?

Aw, shit. Now it's on...

Buh, whaddaya mean you don't have chocolate cactus? ;p

Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden is a free & worthwile distraction when you want to be away from the Strip for awhile, but still close enough to head back to continue availing yourself of sinful debauchery and/or losing your entire savings account.  

The Cactus Garden greets visitors as they arrive.  When I went, I admittedly wasn't a huge cactus fan.  I dunno - maybe it's the spines, maybe it's the phallic looking Saguaro cactus.  Cactus just wasn't my cup of tea.  Ethel M has an assortment of cacti on display, which I've read are adorned with lights during the Holiday season.  My horticultural buddy, who collects cacti, has given me various fruiting cacti like the Peruvian Apple cactus, which has made me appreciate the hardy & resourceful cactus.  If I were to go back, I would look at the garden with a more loving glance.

The Chocolate Factory is a self-guided tour.  Visitors read the various displays on the voyage of a caocao bean into fancy packaging.  The highlight of course, free samples!  Halfway through the tour, visitors get their choice of sample - milk, dark or white chocolate.  I may have obtained a couple samples via a few well-timed out walkthroughs ;p  The tour ends in the chocolate shop, with the chocolates fetching a pretty hefty price.  Looking for more familiar choices?Then, on the left is.............

M&M's World!  Purveyor of all things M&M.  Lots of cute lil knickknacks for the M&M lover.  I remember seeing a chess set, which is pretty dope.  It was interesting to see all the items available to buy, but nothing that I wanted to take home.  Now, if they had M&M colored nipple stickers, then M&M's World would be in business.  I'm Asian, so they'd be milk chocolate M&M's ;p
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Overall, a cool free place to check out while you're in Vegas.

Recommend!

Why does everything have to be SO BIG?! Usually we Yelpers don't complain about that (ha!), but in this case it's just ridiculous. Not to mention the potential for inducing heart attacks is immeasurably increased. It must be part of the appeal / gimmick, but too bad larger sizes don't translate to better food quality.

We were here for breakfast at 8 AM after a long night of partying and gambling (we hadn't slept yet) so at this point everything * should * have tasted good, right?

My Grilled Cheese with ham was hearty and a decent size -- thankfully not a monstrosity. The "Hash Browns" were more like a plateful of overcooked potato chunks, most of which were too hard in texture to eat. The "Side of Bacon" turned out to be an overflowing platter of much-too-crunchy, strange looking meat strips.

Service was friendly when we arrived, but seemed more hassled as the room began filling up for breakfast. 

All in all, an okay experience but would only come back for convenience (a.k.a. when staying at the Mirage and cannot make it to a restaurant outside the hotel).

TIP: Size isn't everything.

DATE TIP: Size isn't everything. Wait, what?! I'm talking about the sandwiches!

Chocolate is the Chuck Norris of sweets. It is possibly the tastiest substance ever created by mankind. Sure, chocolate can cure hunger, but it can also be paired with any food, stop wars, and, in many cultures, is part of mating rituals. Chocolate is like sweet edible sex.

If you're still reading, you can stop now cause ... ya, I know ... "I had you at chocolate."

No sane person could turn down chocolate if offered. When my wife proposed going to Max Brenner at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace for dessert, she knew from my drool that I was no fool.

We were greeted at our table by a hyper server. Dude was clearly choco-rushin' and bouncin' off the walls. I loved his energy, but never did quite figure out what he was recommending. Does it matter? Chocolate is a synonym for "yum."

The Chocolate Fondue and Choctails were tempting (of course); however, we opted for Max's Fried Dough ($14.25). This sweet icon is one huge thin crispy plate of Fried Dough drizzled with Chocolate Chunks, Toffee, Chocolate Ice Cream, and Milk Chocolate Ganache. The animated server said there was no way the two of us could finish it ... I laughed and dove in with both hands. He knows this is chocolate, right? It's a messy and filling dessert designed for a whole family to share...or not share. (4 stars)

We also split a Chocolate Hazelnut Milkshake ($7.95) with Vanilla Ice Cream, Milk Chocolate Ganache, Chocolate Hazelnut Spread, Milk, and Whipped Cream. The shake was smooth, sweet, & superior. If Vincent in Pulp Fiction was surprised by a $5 milkshake imagine how he'd react to an $8 shake. Who needs vodka? It's got CHOCOLATE. I don't know if it's worth $8, but it's pretty f-in good! (4 stars)

Max Brenner, I don't know who you are, but I do love chocolate. So, yep, I'm a sucker ... and a fan ... cause there are only two kinds of people in this world, those who love chocolate ... and those who love chocolate, but won't admit it.

I like Firehouse Subs for their premium tasty sandwiches, they're absolutely outstanding!  

Recently I've found it somewhat harder to swallow their premium prices.

Years ago, the late Clara Peller became famous for her TV commercial "Where's the Beef?", while complaining at a burger place called, "Home of the Big Bun".

While Firehouse isn't that bad, they are close and Which Wich isn't too far behind either for the same reason.  I'm tired of trying to figure out who is giving out 3oz, or 4oz of deli meat on their subs.  

What I truly enjoy is a creative, well made sandwich, that has er, some beef on it, or in Firehouse's case, some meat.  

Quiznos went though bankruptcy, I believe because they forgot that consumers could see them weighing the meat on a scale, and then removing a slice or two when it was too much.

Okay, here's my beef (pun intended).  A group of us came here for lunch and universally found our checks in the $11.00 range.  So that's a sandwich 12" long, meat, chips and a drink.  How much does a 1/4 lb of the most expensive deli meat cost at Fry's or AJ's?

Sadly, we've found it easier just going to Jimmy Johns down on Chandler Boulevard, asking for double meat and paying $9.50 for the same setup.

I give the manager of this location high marks for draining the liquid from the heated pastrami/corn beef NY Steamer after it came out of the oven.  I was in a Firehouse in Florida recently where they forgot to do this and the sandwich just a mushy mess.

In summary, "Yes, I am a Fan" of Firehouse Subs, particularly for all the local Outreach they do for our Bravest. But I only hope they consider taking their thumb off the scale and put some real meat on those sandwiches. 

Enjoy!

miX Lounge on the 64th floor of Mandalay Bay offers the best open-air panoramic views of the Las Vegas Strip. It opens at 5:00 p.m. and the night views are stunning. The restaurant and bar offer an upscale casual way to impress your date or your own eyes with all the lights & sparkles of Vegas over 400 feet below.

Olivia Z. and me stopped in miX before hitting the Michael Jackson ONE show cause it is very convenient to the theater. We were lucky cause there was no cover charge on Christmas Eve. After a quick ride up an express elevator, we eagerly hit the balcony to take in the mesmerizing view. Bring a camera and smiles.

After snapping a few pics, we headed inside and grabbed a seat at one of the many tables facing out. A waitress popped over in just a few seconds and our first round of drinks was on their way. miX Lounge is dark, but the menu is backlit and kind of cool. The faux leather seats and aluminum tables actually seem cool, too. 

Olivia started with a miXOPOLITAN ($16) with Absolut Citron, Cointreau, White Cranberry, Candied Lemon, and a string of Fresh Cranberries. It was sweet and refreshing at the same time. For round two, she switched to a Pear Martini ($18) recommended by the waitress. It features Grey Goose La Poire, Champagne, St. Germain, and a Pear Slice. Much like Olivia, this was even sweeter than the first drink. She liked them both.

For me, I was recovering from the previous night's drinking binge and stuck with some beers. Both were fine and $9: Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale and Sierra Nevada Kellerweis.

This review is strictly for the miX Lounge (not miX Restaurant) and the beautiful views from the outdoor patio.
 - Service was stellar. 
 - Drinks were decent.
 - The vibe was cool.
 - The view was dazzling.

It's time to add miX Lounge to the mix of must see attractions in Las Vegas.

"Please, please, please, no more fish liver, fish sperm, baby eels, crab innards,  shrimp brains, or live octopus.  I wanna pick where we eat today."  whines my Midwest poker bud to a group of three Asian guys.

"OK, OK, where we going?"  I ask choking back laughter at his whining.

"Oyster Bar.  Palace Station." is all he says.

"Cool".  Leaning towards my buds, "Did we really feed him fish sperm?"  Nodding of heads and an explosion of laughter settles the matter.

Very Important:

1.  There is always a line.  Expect a wait.
2.  Don't go expecting perfectly cooked, diverse selection of the best seafood.  It's about flavorful dishes from the 1970's and 1980's made from everyday stuff.

That said, fresh, nondescript oysters on the half shell with cocktail sauce and horseradish.  Overcooked but typical shrimp cocktail with an OK cocktail sauce (dump the horseradish in from the oysters to pump it up).  Chewy, but tasty, overcooked little necks.

Mains are straightforward.  Pan roasts (shelled, over cooked lump crab, shrimp and lobster in an old school brandy infused tomato cream sauce) and Gumbos (same over cooked seafood with andouille sausage and okra thickened with a red brick roux) both served with everyday steamed rice are good eats for sure.   Along with the seafood jambalaya, plain ole good comfort food.

Unfortunately the bouillabaisse and SF classic, Cioppino really miss the mark.  It's hard to enjoy dishes that have been perfected and widely available elsewhere.  Sorry but the use of previously frozen cod, over cooked clams, mussels, headless shrimp and previously steamed crab doesn't cut it.  The sweet, flavorful juices from the shrimp heads and crab are missing and heck, it's just more fun to pick at and suck seafood out of the shell.

Straight forward, simple beer and wine list.  Inexpensive; 2x retail.  Efficient service.

The food is only three stars.  A fourth awarded because this IS a Vegas institution (cheers Godzilla X.)

You know what? I watched the Pound Puppies too. I had dreams of rescuing one of those little Hogan's Heroes clones from their little prison, but in real life that isn't necessarily the best way to go.  Cooler never got parvo.

There is a lot of tramatic backstory to my dog ownership that i will spare you but lets say I have been scarred and it took a lot for me to agree to go here to even look.

Several kennels were full of dog shit...haha yeah dogs live there, no sick looking dogs laying in puddles of runny wrong coloured dog shit, it kennels with healthier looking dogs rolling around in the same sick shit. Yes I am being intentionally vile with my language to make the poit of how vile it was. SHIT!

We saw a dog that we loved. I said no; she said please...then a woman told us this dog was on "the list" yup his last day on god's green earth if he didn't get adopted so we took him. A day or so after we pick him up his little cough is turning into a scary and serious sounding wheez so we take him to the vet, over a thousand dollars later we are told the dog has both pnemonia and parvo...surprise surprise since we picked hi up he had dried SHIT in his fur (keep in mind he was not to be bathed for two weeks because of having just been neutered, yes a freshly operated on dog with dried shit in his fur)
 Oh and puppies don't really recover from that sort of thing so w paid the very nice vet to kill out dog...euthenasia...super....

As she bawls her eyes out I man up to call and let the MCACC know hoping they can take some preventative measures, ya know like not let other dogs roll in the shit that he left. (Parvo is super contagious). They let us know the only action they would take was to make note in our file so that if we went to adopt again they would know we didn't already have a dog in the household...yup...My next dog will be adopted from a much more responsible shelter. I understand low budgets and whatnot but how much does it cost to hose runny shit out of a kennel? GRRR.

I was reading in my IBD yesterday that Zoe's Kitchen was going public today. So why not write a review.

My first experience with Zoe's Kitchen was a couple of years ago at a CMYE at this location. I thought it was good but unfortunately too far from the house or work. Well, since the office moved nearby, I go here about once a week.

I order the 2 Chicken Kabobs which comes with a Greek Salad, rice and a few very small pitas. I really enjoy this meal even though I think it's a bit too pricey. I saw a couple of dudes enjoying the Steak Kabobs the last time I was in there, so I'll probably order that next time.

I went here on a Friday after work for some dinner. The parking can be a challenge so have some patience. 

I have had this place bookmarked for several years but I have never really found myself in the area to take advantage of this place. I was trying to decide on a couple of Korean dishes. There was one that was cooked in a skillet with rice and the dish that I finally chose was the Spicy Korean dish with beef and noodles. I'm really not a more spicy the better aficionado. I don't mine a little heat as long as it compliments the meal. I thought the spiciness to this dish was just right. They give you a huge portion and our waiter was always there to refill my water glass because my mouth was en fuego at times.

The cost was under $12 and a good deal for the amount of food received. The service was excellent and my wife really enjoyed this place as well. I will be back!

Just got this message from one of the owners (their review is under Jestin M.) 

this is me one of the owner of Tina's cafe.  you are obviously a poor idiot who is miserable in life.  If you have a nerve, you should've tell your complaint to us instead of crying out on yelp.  We have so many flowers and will continue doing great. Tina will bit the fack out of you if you come and let her know who you are.  ASS HOLE. Go back to your Mexico and eat corn with your whore mother.  by the way, your picture looks like a a guy who is infected with some kinds of disease.   Your women is ugly as you btw (lol)

So after this I personally called and spoke with a manager, they confirmed Jestin works there. Even though I was being cordial with my tone and trying to be helpful in saying that this was my experience, maybe others are experiencing the same thing and that can help fix the problem, they proceeded to say a few things I wont retype here and hung up. 

I responded back and so did they. If you want to read that here is a screen shot of that: 
http://i.imgur.com/PvcBz.jpg

So it was not enough for them to say that message. They just texted me this right now (since I called with my cell). 

"You keep mentioning 5yrs old about your stupid compain, we will report your info to be investigated if you are a child melester. Tina has a right not serve you for the safty of our customer. Take your little 10 dollar to mcdonald's. Lol"

Here is a screen shot of the text I just got from the business phone number:

This chocolate heaven at the Aria hotel just makes me so happy. As soon as i saw those chocolate flowers on the wall http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=zqVvDm_-ikgvhPMZrUK3Lg, i was giddy!
There was the gelato bar with a great variety of flavors: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=7K-QKzgV0XdrlZOX9aMRng, a crepe station, sandwiches, cakes galore, pastries, chocolates and lots of fun and cute stuff - from wedding cake favors http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=wzlynGBt9AZbLQevhF8jjg to Thrilla
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=ZRq2lJn-JoOHLqUOZNYQVg
It was almost impossible to pick which cake i wanted. We settled on triple chocolate cake (so decadent!) topped with a fab macaron. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=HfgazxGFRJ6nZO2MXGcNsQ
We also shared a tasty crepe: rich and very indulgent. Loved it! 

One thing i didn't love was when I asked a worker if they sold individual macarons and the guy said yes and pointed me to the coconut macaroons. I was even more annoyed when I saw labels for the rose macaron cake say macaroon. However the prepacked macarons were labeled "French macarons".  Anthony N pointed it out to me that macaroon is the English translation for macaron; but seriously at Jean Philippe I would like to see it labeled Macaron, especially when they ALSO sell macarooooons. It's like a prestigious french restaurant having "fat liver" on their menu instead of foie gras. Luckily my annoyance quickly dissipated when i took a bite of that triple chocolate cake!!!

The year: 2010.
  
The episode: "Phoenix."

The Man: Adam Richman, himself.

The Challenge: Chompie's "The Ultimate Slider Challenge."

...12 Original Jewish Sliders: each one brisket-filled and gravy-drizzled, stacked as well with mini potato pancakes, Jack cheese, and onion strings.  Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.  Instead, I ordered the Combo.  And after tearing through an incredibly tasty two, alongside a cup of Matzo Ball soup, I was full.  Adam, however, he Manned-up!  Sadly, though, after a hard-fought battle, he--as many have before him--ultimately threw in the towel. The Challenge, it seemed, proved too hefty.  Food had won.

...However, if one, brave soul decides to accept this heaping challenge ($39.95) and conquers this plattered beast, it's free.  But not only that: upon winning, you will be forever immortalized on Chompie's "Hall of Fame" website (http://chompies.com/wall-of-fame/) and an "Ultimate Slider Challenge" T-shirt awaits you and your bragging self!! You bad!!  (By the way, there's no California representation on that website, zero, none, not one, nada...  Who'll step up?

This having been my first time to Chompie's, I was truly impressed!  A Yelp check-in offer allowed for a free bagel from their awesome deli/bakery; our very cool server, Trudy, brought out a few, free cookie samples for this first-timer; and our just-as-cool host made lunch suggestions, which we ordered verbatim.  As promised, those Sliders were "deli-icious."  And the Matzo Ball and Chicken soup hit the spot.  But I couldn't leave...not yet.  As full as I was, I couldn't head back to CA without first trying the carrot cake, could I?  I mean, you don't blame me, right?

So, "Man vs Food"...  That takes care of Phoenix: Alice Cooper'stown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/alice-cooperstown-phoenix?hrid=esDZwjuGZQlkpKrZAC_guQ), Los Reyes de la Torta (http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-reyes-de-la-torta-phoenix-2?hrid=nJiqRCfTtxs2bIoFrPdmkA), and now Chompie's.  On deck, LA.

This is the first (hopefully last) show I've ever attended where the headliner lip-synced the majority of their performance.  I knew going in that would be the case, but it still bugged the crap out of me.  There are a ton of Yelp reviews that mention it.  Almost none of them care and joyously devour her show like it's all you can eat ice cream.
  
Just being in the same (albeit very large) room as Britney Spears, wafting in her aura and celebrity is where their satisfaction is.  She could have been brushing her teeth on stage for all they cared.  My wife argued that I would go see Red Sox designated hitter David "Big Papi" Ortiz if he did a Vegas lip-sync/dance show and it's nothing different than this.  She's right.  I totally would.    

The scene was a sea of ladies dressed in club clothes, packs of gay men that knew the words to every song, Eurotrash, and significant others like myself that questioned whether the metal detectors at the entrance were for Britney's safety or to prevent a person like me from shooting/stabbing myself mid-show if she sang (ummm...performed?) a song like the inadvertent sex change anthem "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman".  The energy in the venue was palpable when you combined all that with the $45 "Work Bitch" caps, the homemade costumes worn, and people pre-gaming big by double fisting their $12 cocktails.

Of course I got a bunch of dudes a row up that refused to sit at any point during the show. Ballads, dance interludes, parts that she wasn't even in; they were all "Fuck it!  We're standing!  It's Britney, bitch!"  That meant we couldn't see anything unless we stood too!  So even when the majority of people were sitting during certain parts, I was still out of my seat which probably made me look like a really big fan of Miss Spears.  Puke.  I actually shelled dough out for this show so I'd be damned if I were to miss a wardrobe malfunction.  

Songs were....stage was...dancers were....screw that!  Go read other reviews for that stuff.   I didn't cross this show off my bucket list, I crossed it off my fuckit list.

Place is bomb dot com
Must visit when in Phoenix
In my top five joints 

Long before Yelp or the Travel Channel, my go to source for finding the best places to check out when travelling was a book called "Eat Your Way Across the USA."  I think this was only one of two places in Arizona that the book featured.  Went to Richardson's for the first time in probably the late 90's or early 2000's and have been hooked ever since.  It is among my absolute most favorite restaurants.

A couple years back, the original location was destroyed by fire.  This was my first time in the new location which is right around the corner from the original spot.  The interior looks almost exactly like the old location.  They now have mandatory valet, though, which I am not crazy about.

In the past, I have gotten the huevos rancheros and the enchiladas.  Best I have ever had for both.  Today, I got the Trio which was Swordfish, Salmon and Mahi Mahi.  Came on a tortilla with asparagus and carrots.  Outstanding!  They have five dollar mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys during brunch hours.  Had one mimosa and one bellini.

I wish I had just come to Richardson's straight from the airport when I arrived last Tuesday.  It is that freaking good!

Grassroots rates 3 1/2 stars for me but I'll round up with 4 stars for this review. They serve the beer ice cold which I love. I started off with the appetizer of the pulled pork sliders which were delicious. For the main course I had the sliced brisket with some funky side to it which was forgettable as far as I'm concerned. They don't give you enough BBQ Sauce so you have to ask for more. The brisket was just okay for me, and for what they were charging it should have tasted much better.

The service was decent. This place is a great alternative if you ever get stuck waiting in line at that hip pizza place across the way. I would definitely come back and try some other menu items. Just when I thought it was safe to carry the Discover Card I find out that this place doesn't accept it. I think the Discover Card was rolled out in the mid 1980's. Hey Grassroots, if you want to be that upscale and sophisticated go to restaurant and bar then you'll have to accept all major credit cards.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 44/100

The boyfriend and I aren't big drinkers, so fraps at this Starbucks ended up being our first drinks when we first got to Vegas, LOL. This location is nice and big, well lit, and has TONS of seating. We went close to 10pm and they were still open pretty late (might be 24 hours, but I can't remember). 

I decided to try their new caramel flan frap, which was really good! Much better than the caramel frap or the creme brulee frap, IMO. The boyfriend got a peppermint mocha frap and his was great as well.

They only had two people working during the time we went, but they were very friendly asian women who worked with smiles on their faces :)

The only reason why I won't give this Starbucks 5 stars is because it is really expensive. However, all of the Starbucks in LV are much more expensive than normal Starbucks locations are. We got two tall sized fraps and it was over $11...kind of ridiculous.

They INTERPRETATE the music so well!!! 
(Holla at ABDC season 1 fans!)

It was very difficult keeping the show tickets a secret from my dude- a huge Jabba fan. Bought them about a month in advance, we got 3rd row seats for about $70.00 each. Pricey indeed, but it was so worth it to see them live, so close and their 1.5 hour show was packed to the brim with Jabba-ness. When i could finally reveal the big surprise of the tickets, we were full of giddy smiles the entire time. From the very entertaining preshow until the end, we were fully ENTERTAINED!!!! 
Actually reading some of the things in the negative reviews made me sad and little butt-hurt that they were not ENTERTAINED! These are no skinny lizards- but some of the baddest mofos i've ever seen dance. I didn't give a f*ck if some of the story was a little odd or didn't really make sense to me the whole time. I was just happy to see them recreate some of their ABDC performances as well as a whole slew of new routines. ABDC fans will recognize special guest appearances by SuperCr3W members, which was awesome. I loved the playfulness of the glow in the dark sequence, the oldskool segment and the Single Ladies ofcourse. I especially liked the KB solos and it was fun spotting the individuals behind their masks, like Phil's booty shaking and Rynan's impressive headspins. 

A MUST SEE for TRUE Jabbawockeez fans!!!
Great show for hip hop music/dance fans.
Hit or miss for those unfamiliar.

Get seats in the front or center aisle and you may get picked for audience participation!

We really liked Hopdoddy's fresh new variety, but found the burgers themselves a little bland.

One hiccup on our visit, as others have noted, is the service. Too many unsupervised newbies and not enough chiefs on the floor. When we arrived, we were told to wait for our greeter who would then take us to our table.  Then we were told to walk up to the counter and place our order. Grrrr

The problem was exasperated, since there was no permanent greeter. The longer we waited, the more the folks behind us started getting upset since they were outside in the heat and didn't understand the holdup.  I hope it's been fixed by now.

BTW, we very much liked the updated Philip Johnson style glass house architecture. Who would have ever thought of building a glass restaurant in the desert?  Incredible. 

Hopdoddy has a bunch of interesting choices on their menu. And, it's those choices that provide the taste for their burgers, not the meat itself. The food is very good and reminded us a great deal of a Fox Concept's Zinburger. Both offer something interesting for the palate. 

Expect to pay $20 each for drinks, burger and one appetizer.

I went here to see the Coyotes play my home town Chicago Blackhawks. The place was sold out and consisted mostly of Chicagoans. I had no problem high fiving fellow fans after each of the 5 goals that the hawks scored. And of course they won going away that night. I guess it's a sad commentary on society in general when you have to go through a metal detector to go into the stadium. 

I had excellent seats since they were about 10 rows from the glass at the faceoff circle. I was positioned near the Coyotes net to see most of the Hawk's goals. The lines at the concession places weren't too bad but I'm pretty ticked that the dude as we entered our section wanted to see my tickets. I guess he wanted me to juggle my food and drinks in the air while I fished out my tickets from my pocket. He saw my "Are you kidding me look" and explained that they were sold out. I explained to him that I've gone to plenty of sold out games in Chicago without the attitude from the Stadium staff. How can the management expect fans wanting to pay $10 bucks for parking plus $80 plus dollars per ticket and still wanting to endure the hassle of their staff inside? Management might want to think about that for awhile.

Pro tip about going to the game. Don't expect to get any free pizza from their cheerleaders when you're wearing the away team's colors. Getting out of the parking lot was fairly easy as well. Also, thank goodness that cell phone reception is a little inconsistent near the ice so you don't have to listen to people on their phones.

***update***
Our original posting was deleted by Yelp. Now this posting went from being "recommended" to currently hidden at the bottom of the "not recommended" reviews... So far, 21 users thought it was useful. Why are you hiding my review, Yelp? Could it be because I gave a NEGATIVE review based on my OWN experience? So much for being able to trust your site for unbiased reviews.
*********

Our previous review was deleted by Yelp for "violating their guidelines" so I'll post another review that only relates to our personal experience with their boarding facility.

We used Green Acre Boarding in Oct of 2013 for a 3 night stay. This place was presented as a great place for dogs... Free roam and lots of kids to play with your pups.  

This seemed like a great scenario for our 1yr old golden but our 11 year old sheltie just needed a safe place to stay. When I dropped our dogs off, I told MaLeisa that our sheltie didn't enjoy playing with other dogs (she would run away from her own loving, gentle, golden retriever brother at home) and that she just needed a quiet place to rest & observe during her stay. I was assured by MaLeisa they could accommodate that and that she would be fine.

Upon picking up our dogs we were told by MaLeisa that our sheltie "was playing in the yard with another dog and having a great time and next thing she knew, Todd was carrying her in because she had blood on her." Our dog had blood oozing from her ear, cuts across her face, was dry heaving and could barely walk. (And, "they had already washed her.") Our Sheltie collapsed in exhaustion once we got her into our vehicle. Unfortunately, our sweet girl had to be put down the following week as she never fully recovered from her injuries. 

Green Acres makes you sign a contract saying your dog will be dehydrated and exhausted upon returning home but that these are all normal results of a boarding experience. Add to that your dog will reek (which was explained away as being from the flood irrigation they use.) 

We had already pre-booked another stay at Green Acre for later in the month but obviously cancelled that stay after the injuries to our sheltie. I'm sickened and sad that I ever entrusted my dogs to the care of Green Acre.

I'm glad I had the chance to ride the High Roller, but at $21.95 during the day & $36.95 at night, I find it to be too pricey for just a souped up ferris wheel.  I recommend the High Roller as something to take a pic of from a distance, with or w/o selfie.

Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat

Marquee Nightclub was packed. The music was thumpin' and the drinks were flowin'. Who cares if there were more dudes on the crowded dance floor than ladies? We were there to jump and dance ... and after quickly staking out a spot in the middle near the front, that is exactly what we and a few hundred of our new best friends did.

Tip #1: Stay at the Cosmopolitan. Go online and book a room because it includes free admission to Marquee through a much shorter line. It'll also give you a place to freshen up before hitting the club and crash/party afterwards. Ask for a room in the East Tower for convenience to Marquee.

Marquee Mondays makes Marquee a reason to stay in Sin City an extra day. The EC Twins and Nadia Ali performed on the Monday before Christmas and this was like an early gift from Santa.

Tip #2: Get on the main dance floor early cause by midnight it was wall-to-wall people with almost no one getting in or out. Many "couples" were frustrated with the tight quarters, so, come prepared for bumpin' and jumpin' with people from all around the globe.

DJ Lisa Pittman worked it at the pool while Eddie Makabi and another DJ pumped up the beats inside before the headliners came out around 12:30. Nadia did a 30-minute live set which had the crowd frothing and then the energy reached a peak with the frenetic twins.

Tip #3: Get a table if you aren't planning to stake out a spot on the crowded dance floor. If you are just wanting to chill at a club, the outdoor pool vibe and tables may be best or get one of the prime spots inside so you and your crew can dance in your own area.

Drinks are expensive ... of course, and table service is crazy expensive. Plan accordingly.

Marquee was a blast. We loved the vibe, the confetti, foam light sticks, blasts of cold air, and non-stop beats. If you get free admission to Marquee while staying at The Cosmopolitan then it is easily a 5-star night for any EDM fan.

Marquee is the newest club to hit Vegas and it is ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. A gorgeous club full of gorgeous people! My girls and I agreed that it would be very, very hard for any other place to top it... it was that epic.

The main room will blow you away with its 40 foot LED DJ booth, but make sure you check out all three levels, including the Boombox and the Library - you will be wowed by it all. The Boombox is a smaller underground club with a separate DJ, and the Library is more of an intimate lounge area hidden behind the massive LED screen - complete with pool tables, vintage books and offers more craft cocktails. And if you need to cool off, head outside, where you'll be impressed by the incredible backdrop of City Center views and the fabulous pool cabanas with see-through jacuzzis. 

We received rockstar treatment from beginning to end, and were fortunate to be walked right in. The GA line was scary long. We ended up dancing the night away at the VIP booth right next to the DJ booth, so it almost seemed like we were go-go dancers on stage. It was ATB's first night of residency and it was so amazing to be right there with him. His set was totally nostalgic - remember "Till I Come"?! - we were partying like it was 1999! The dance floor was completely packed with a high energy crowd.

Marquee has really taken the Vegas club to a new level. AMAZE-BALLS!!

The Human Bean is a tiny little building bursting with a variety of flavors. I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the coffee here. My first visit I went with a hot "Snowy Chocolate" that the barista suggested. I thought the Snowy Chocolate tasted bland and watered down. I came back a couple days later to try something different and am glad I did because I ended up really liking it! I ordered a "Java Chip" blended and it tasted so good and they don't skimp at all on the chocolate chips! I loved it so much that I decided to cheat on Starbuck's the next morning before work and came here to get coffee instead. I had a BOGO coupon a co-worker gave me so I ordered a  "Salted Caramel Mocha" iced and a "Caramel Mocha" blended. The Salted Caramel Mocha was so-so while the Caramel Mocha blended was so good with ribbons of caramel throughout it and it just had a good taste. They have plenty of options when it comes to flavors, so I will be back to try out more! I was also given a punch chard where after I buy so many coffees I get one free. Also on Wednesday you get double punches! Nice! They have 2 drive-thrus with one on each side of the building and you can pull up to either of them. A nice touch is the chocolate covered espresso bean they put on top of each drink, it just completes the whole drink. The girls working here are very friendly and helpful with explaining all the drinks. Drinks range from around $2 - $5 depending on what you want and the size. Glad I tried The Human Bean!

I used to think this venue was named for the dress size of girls in minidresses who lined up to get their butt cheeks stamped in exchange for free admission.  But, after making my way here last Monday, I'm guessing the name stands for Excess.

Because they spared no expense, friends.  This place is huge, the vibe is sexy, and the people are as beautiful as money can buy.  Especially on a Monday in Las Vegas.  It's industry night, so expect to shake it harder for free perks.  

We arrived shortly before Midnight and paid a cover charge ($20 for me; $30 for him).  Then, on a hunch, I dropped my name to a dude with a clipboard, he checked the guestlist (sign up free on the Wynn's website to be contacted soon by a promoter: http://www.encorelasvegas.com/#/nightlife/xs_reservations/) and then REIMBURSED us for the cover charges.  That's right, they said, "you shouldn't have to pay" and actually put $50 BACK on our card... which paid for a few vodka sodas for yours truly.

A cute gal wandered around with tequila and vodka-guava shooters.  Might want to ask how much they are in advance, since $12 a pop adds up when you offer to buy a round for your friends.

Fun Tip: Find the Las Vegas Weekly photographer on premises and get yourself featured in the online photo album here: http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/photos/2010/jan/26/128774/

We danced until 3am to hip hop mash-ups and had a blast.  Warm vibe from everyone on the indoor/outdoor dance floor - which helps when you fall on your face from 4.5" heels that weren't intended to be walked in and need strangers to pull a Humpty Dumpty and get you upright again.  Hypothetically.

With suitcases in hand we checked this place out to satisfy my curiosity about Michael Mina. I've heard his name thrown around here and there when the conversation is about restaurants. Why is he famous? Why does have so many restaurants??

NEW ENGLAND CRAB & LOBSTER ROLLS ($17) - 3 pieces of warm bread with crab & lobster goodness on top. Scrumptious!

SEARED FOIE GRAS ($25) - It was perfectly seared and buttery. It also had an apple compote that made it super sweet, super yummy!

FRENCH FRIES ($7) - Perfectly salted and perfectly crunchy.

BEIGNETS ($9) - So warm, so soft, and so sugary! Then I dipped it in the chocolate caramel sauce....ohmanohmanohman, I was in pure ecstasy! The salty caramel ice cream was a delightful bonus to this dish!

CHRIS-TINI ($14) - There was something beyond sweetness, something odd and sour that made me a bit dizzy. I liked it!

SUMMER FLING ($14?) - So good yet so bad...The first sip wormed its way into my brain and made me giddy!

SERVICE - There was 1 to 2 people standing in each corner watching the dining room. At least they were on it when we needed something. But as the restaurant got busier, we saw less and less of our waiter. We had to flag him down when I wanted to order dessert, when we wanted more drinks, and when we were ready to pay. But my tummy was happy so I wasn't upset with the wait. And props to the manager for hiding our suitcases in his office.

After a few appetizers and drinks I kind of understood why Michael Mina is known by a lot of foodies. AHHHH...dining here was a great way to end this Vegas trip! Now I'm curious about the other Michael Mina restaurants!

I appreciate French food and like it more than I should. 

I also love NOLA and their Laissez les bons temps roulern!

But, the French Grocery is really not a grocery store at all. You cannot buy any grocery items, like you might find in a typical Champion or Carrefour. No Carte Noire coffee, no Maille moutardes, et cetera

They also do not cook, nor serve food here.  Everything is pre-made, wrapped for sale and kept in a refrigeration case. The only exception is the bakery items and a small chilled salad deli case. 

When we arrived on Friday just before five, there were also very few items left in the refrigerator. There was no croissants, no french bread or much of anything in the bakery case except for some small $1.75 cookies.

There were a couple of small individual Quiche Lorraines (which didn't contain any bacon or ham) and a few small baguette sandwiches, like you would find in Gare du Nord. 

The French Bakery also has a wine section, along with a few French press coffee pots. As others have noted, the lighting is poor and makes the store feel dreary. There are a few tables scattered in this cavernous store. But I am unsure what they are used for since you cannot sit and eat any of the chilled items. 

I believe the French Grocery is set up to appeal to working couples on the go --who want something more interesting than the Take Out selection of Fresh & Easy.  Of the six items we ordered, the best was the chocolate Pot de Creme for $3.50. Our total including tax came to $32.11

But if you come to the French Grocery thinking of Le Pain Quotidien, Le Madeleine, or even local Amuse Bouche (Surprise), you might leave disappointed.   Sorry!

One of the most intimate and unique dining experiences you will ever experience in Sin City!

Having tried most of the fine dining restaurants in Vegas, I thought i'd seen it all til i was pleasantly surprised with a shiny golden ticket in the mail!

When that fateful evening arrived on Saturday October 13th, I was like Charlie waiting in eager anticipation to finally visit Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.  Truth be told, I wasn't quite sure what was in store for me but i had a feeling it would be something good! 

In fact, as soon as we stepped into Jaleo, we were cordially seated at the bar and kindly given the drink menu for the evening on a handy iPad! Since I was feeling celebratory, i decided on the wine pairing with my meal and  as soon as our server found out it was my birthday, he gave us a glass of cava on the house! Now that's service IMO! 

After that, we were escorted to a dimly lit and intimate private room with a semicircular bar surrounded by wooden card catalogs housing Jose Andre's eclectic tchotchkes, which he apparently collected from his travels around the world.  At this time, the chef introduced himself and proceeded with a brief explanation of the evening's events.  Without a moment to spare, the chef and his skilled staff worked feverishly on the first dish. Liquid nitrogen began to billow over the counter and within moments, we were presented with beautiful bite size pieces of food art. About 20 or more dishes followed in succession, each skillfully crafted to engage and amaze!

I must admit, I arrived with high expectations, but the chef and staff at  definitely did not disappoint. It was a truly unforgettable experience that was filled with intrigue and spectacle. An intimate showcase inspired by traditional Spanish dishes, masterfully executed by the talented chef and staff.  is bar none one of the most interesting and enjoyable dining experiences I've ever had in Vegas! With that said, it's an experience you should make when visiting the city because like magic, it could soon disappear!

Happy Eats!

Probably the best Pad See Ew I've ever had, but let's start from the beginning...

Immediately upon walking in, I was given... bar none... the most hospitable reception in my short history of dining.  It was comprised of a greeting (including being called by name) and a hug from the cutest little thing, who I had just met.

We started off with a chicken satay app, which was accompanied by a creamy peanut sauce and cucumber salad.  Removing the delicious skewered meat from the wooden spears brought me back to days of yore, when I would covertly poke my little sister in the closest appendage, with the sole purpose of evoking a squeal, all the while under the auspices of my no-nonsense parents.

My go-to Thai dish is Pad See Ew.  I've seen it spelled differently, but I'm hip.  This dish was one to be savored.... no, to be fawned over and then savored.  Using my meticulous chop-stick skills, I pampered each delicate noodle into my quivering mouth... which evoked blissful visions of lazily floating down the Chao Phraya river... and mind you, I've never even been to Thailand.

I'm not saying the dish was laced with opium, but at some point, I do recall fancying a ride atop an Asian Elephant passing through the seven levels of the Candy Cane forest.

My lunch companion, Chris, ordered the basil fried rice, which was more akin to an architectural wonder than an entree.  Using his meticulous spoon skills, I witnessed him moving mountains... of succulent rice and fixins... never to be seen again, for at least eight hours.

And just when I thought our culinary journey was disembarking, the same vision of loveliness appeared to my right, presenting a showpiece comprised of cake, cream and maraschino cherry.

Knowing my chop-sticks would only make a mess of things, I grabbed a spoon.  It had been so long... but it felt good in my hand.  A little cold.  I raised that utensil to the sky, and with an intense bellow, I cried "By the power of GreySkull, I shall have you as my own".  As I started my initial swipe, I noticed Chris had already gotten 2 or 3 bites in during the fanfare.

BAM!  The cake was bursting with coconut gusto, or maybe it was the ice cream.  I'm embarrassed to think of what I probably looked like as I descended into that dessert feeding frenzy.

I'd like to offer apologies to any staff and/or patron within line of sight.  I don't get out much, and unfortunately whenever my taste buds are stirred up like that, its plain and simple mob mentality.  I cant get in their way!  I wont!

After paying the tab, I bid a fond adieu to the huddled kitchen crew, and noticed their horror stricken faces.  The audible syllables "Mujumbo hielan friacah" lilted through the air as I passed... which I believe meant: "Great manly warrior"... no, my bad, wrong dialect... it actually means: "Portly destroyer with awkward shirt cleavage".

I look forward to my return visit, where I will exercise self control... or maybe just exercise

Finally... a buffet where Quantity = Quality. Of course, it is still a buffet, so, don't come expecting this to be a 5-star dining experience or some romantic dinner for two. The Buffet at Wynn Las Vegas is a 5-star buffet experience ... with buffet being the key word.

We came for dinner and left about 2 1/2 hours later. I'm sure our waitress thought we were pigs. I know we felt like pigs ... and didn't really care because we loved the food so much.

 - Fresh-prepared food like a Pasta counter, Salad station, and custom Crepes 
 - Mounds of Crab Legs and Shrimp
 - Lamb, Prime Rib, & Game Hen
 - Try to get a table in the well-lit courtyard. It's a nicer atmosphere.
 - Gelato, Candied Apples, Profiteroles, and Chocolate-covered Marshmallows
 - Cheeses and Charcuterie
 - Dim Sum dumplings (so-so) and other Asian dishes
 - More, more, and more.

It may sound like every other buffet and while it is, it also isn't. The little things are nicer. The food is better. The buffet is better.

The grilling of food over an open flame is almost 125,000 years old.

And, the Habit Burger story is an interesting one. http://www.habitburger.com/story/  Yet the charbroiling of hamburgers and chicken is a cooking technique that many fast food places have yet to master.  Until now that is. We came here this past Saturday and came away thinking, Wow.

The menu is very familiar.  It will remind many of "In 'n Out" in it's simplicity and style of service.  Their Char-burger is $2.95 and the Double Char is $3.95. I don't know if you can order it animal style, but the burgers are delicious.  Yes, delicious.  It has that smokey char-boiled taste down to where you will want lick your fingers.

Other grilled Habit Burger sandwiches include, Chicken for $5.75, Tri-Tip beef $6.25, as well as Veggie options and Albacore Tuna.  The Sides include French fries, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and a salad range in price from $1.85 to $2.65.  

Besides a side of salad, Habit Burger also has six different Specialty Salads to choose from, ranging from a Garden for $3.95 to a Santa Barbara Chicken Cobb for $6.95.

A couple of burgers, a side of sweet potato fries and a drink ran us $12.68, including tax.  Wow.  Less expensive than "SmashBurger", slightly more than "In 'n Out"; but a lot better tasting.  Nice.

Enjoy!

Friends ask: What's your favorite car?

I say: Hands down, super cars!  Who doesn't drool for the exotics?!

Friends go on to tell me that there's a track in which you can drive them as fast as you want, yadda yadda. 

Me: No Brainer! Of course I want in!!
 
If you can't be behind the wheel for whatever reason, hey, you can be a back-seat driver! As I was waiting for my turn I saw a few people riding as a passenger alongside a real race car driver.  I felt their excitement just by looking at their expressions as they got out of the car. They sure got the ride of a lifetime! 

Most of the employees here are a friendly bunch. They know what they are doing and seem to enjoy their jobs. The owner was on duty that day and noticed we were waiting for quite a while, so they offered my friend a free upgrade and tried to move things along as fast as possible. He paid for the regular Ferrari and got to drive the scuderia instead. I notice that they keep adding more and more cars to their garage! How I wished they had a McLaren when I was there!

Okay, okay. I'll leave you all with a cheesy picture. Here's a photo of me in a ridiculous helmet but in a white lambo:

Priceless, eh?

WOW. THE ONLY THING THAT IS KEEPING THESE GUYS OPEN IS THEIR LOCATION AND FOOD NETWORK FAME.

Most of their customers are mainly gonna be tourists and first timers. Located in a busy part of the Fremont Street Experience, the name of the restaurant and the words "350 Pounds and Over Eat Free" are definite eye catchers.

The Heart Attack Grill or "HAG" as it's come to be known, has actually lived up to it's namesake with actual heart attack incidents. As a matter of fact, while I am typing this review, I find out the unofficial spokesperson for HAG has died from you guessed it, an apparent heart attack. 
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130212/nv-heart-attack-grill-heart-attack/?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=politics

This place must be bad because I have gone at least 3 paragraphs before even having to mention their food. Ok, quick descriptions. They cook their beef patties and fries with lard. Their milkshakes have actual butter in them. Literally they have a little stick of butter right on top of it sticking out. Now I know the fat is what makes most greasy food taste good but in this case the grease is highly overpowering.

Service is decent. Yeah you got scantily clad female nurses as your servers but this is Vegas. Nothing should surprise you. Well, maybe except for when you see guys getting spanked by them with wooden paddles because it's their birthday. You can actually get spanked if you ask nicely. No special occasion necessary.

Of course everybody's number one complaint is that they take cash only. Of course there is an ATM available but you get charged up the arse just in fees alone. FAIL.

So overall, most people come just for the shock value. Meaning they are shocked when they shouldnt be when they find out there has been several heart attack incidents. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

I love art in all forms--paintings, sculpture, poetry, song, and dance.  I am a "FIRM" believer in supporting artists because they try to tell us a story--through their eyes.  On Saturday, my friend and I stuffed our faces with bacon wrapped hot dogs at Echo Park for Javier's Bacon Wrapped Goodness UYE.  Afterwards, we had nothing to do and thought why not go out and support our starving artists--it's all about giving back.  Lets go to Vegas!!

Service - Woohoo! As good as it gets! + soft and silky skin
Cleanliness - Ambiguous
Price - Enough!
Seafood - Yes, some people refer it to that.
Meats - Yes, yes, yes!!
Vegetables - I think this costs extra.
Dessert - Yes it is.
Fruits - Forbidden fruit?

What was ordered:

"Stoner" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - This Anglo artist told me that she works better inebriated.  I was interested enough to purchase her body of work for my friend--who was also inebriated.  As Stoner revealed her art, she yelled out "And they are all natural!!"  I am "technically" a doctor since I was a Biological Science major as an undergrad and I have some expertise in human anatomy.  The mammary were indeed natural and quite a stunning pair.
 
"Ms. Foodie" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - This Asian artist hails from Arizona and is a recent transplant to Las Vegas.  Her and I had a thorough conversation regarding food.  She loves food trucks because the food is so tasty, cheap, and is convenient in her line of work.  "The Foodie" also loves breakfast and a big fan of dumplings.  She loves to dance to Trance music.  Her body of art is all natural and very inspiring--Frida Kahlo would love her work.

"Frisco" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - "Frisco" is from the Norcal region--San Jose to be exact.  I told her I went to school in Sacramento.  "Frisco" found it amusing that Sacramento rhymed with Frisco.  She chose the name Frisco because it sounded sexier than San Jose.  She loves to dance to Trance music.  Her body of work is all natural--and all so buttery smooth.  "Frisco" told me she is selective with her clients--must be my innocent eyes.  She gave me a kiss on the cheek and told me to go find her later.

"Brazil" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - "Brazil" comes from the lovely country of Brazil.  She loves soccer.  I told her "Soccer?!  You must mean "futbol."  She was very impressed that I knew that--Brazil told me that my name is spelled Joan in Brazilian--accent on the "a."  I asked her what is her favorite food in Brazil and she told me bbq meat--she goes back once a year.  I am a giver so I purchased one of her bodies of art for my friend.  She loves to dance to all kinds of music.  I was too busy perusing Frisco's catalog to notice whether Brazil's art was natural or not.

"Mexican Fusion" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - The young and innocent Mexican Fusion is from Anaheim as well--lucky me.  Her friend was putting on a show and invited her to come along this one night--she didn't have to drive so tagged along.  This artist is a fusion of Mexican and Spanish--her father is from Spain so she gets her light complexion and dark hair from him.  My guess is that she got her body from her mother--lucky me.  She also likes to dance to Trance music.  Mexican Fusion's body of art is all natural--lucky me.

I can already imagine the responses to this review--"Where are the pictures, John?!"  It is true that a picture is worth a thousand words, however, I believe art needs to be experience face-to-face--in the moment.  I strongly urge for all of you to go support your local artists!  FYI - Art ain't cheap!

Everything is pretty small and served like tapas, but somehow its surprisingly filling.  There were definite highs and lows to this meal, but I think there were a few dishes that excelled while only a few weren't quite what we had hoped for.

There was a big group of us so I managed to sample quite a big portion of the menu.

Highlights:

Carnitas tacos-served with guac, pork rinds, and a verde sauce!

Like water for Chocolate- fried quail served with dragonfruit and edible flowers.  

Chilaquilles- tortilla chips cooked in a pan with a salsa verde and cheese.  Kinda like nachos.

Mango "sticky rice"- this is something quite interesting.  The sticky rice part was made into a mousse and ripe mangoes.  I've never seen this before and it was really cool.  The "rice" element were like rice crispies on top.  

Chocolate "terrain"- Awesome chocolate mold of a Chinese soldier with a spicy chocolate mousse inside.  It was served with cookie crumbs to look like sand, and a ginger ice cream that was spicy and sweet all at the same time.

Things to skip:

Oceans Nest- fried noodles served with stirfried saucy seafood and veggies.  We ate all the lobster out of it and then left it there.  It was super bland.

Lamb potstickers- pretty presentation with the little edible flowers and everything but it was bland and looked more exciting than it tasted.

Overall, I thought the place had a whimsy to it that I thought was fun.  The ambiance was interesting and diverting, the waitress and wait staff were helpful and went out of their way to see to our requests.  While some of the food is a bit overpriced and small, I really enjoyed their desserts, there is something light hearted and comical about them.  They were the highlight of the meal.  If nothing else, come and have dessert and a laugh all at the same time.

Sadly Al's Beef is gone but Fired Pie is a nice addition to the Northsight neighborhood!  

I came here today for a late lunch. There were no cars parked in front and the inside was cavernously and deserted. Fired Pie I've learned believes their market is providing "a fast, casual and customizable options for your pizza or salad desires. We use local brews, organic foods, cognizant of sustainability and the ..."  Yeah, yeah but do they make a good pie?  In a word, yes. 

This, in some ways, is the pizza world's answer to Jimmy Johns. In essences, "Pizza so Fast you'll Freak!"  LOL  They cook their pies in a wood fired 700 F degree oven, so they're done in less than four minutes. Nice!

The crust is ultra thin and the toppings are very good (see photos). I'm not sure if one individual 10" pie will satisfy you if you have a hardy appetite. But I thought it was very good and filling.  

I had the Tomato & Basil, which has the look of a Margherita pizza, but Fired Pie adds garlic and several types of cheeses for a nice taste.  

The cost was a fair $7.75 (not including tax) and seems like a good alternative to the sandwich/subs guys over near the 101 and Pima.  Specialty pizzas are $2.00 extra. 

So Three and half Stars+, A-Okay!

Like ancient Rome, Caesars Palace is old, but still impressive.

Caesars has done a decent job of upgrading rooms, restaurants, and entertainment in an effort to keep up with best of Vegas. Sure, for similar prices you can usually find a 5-star Las Vegas room, but staying at Caesars in the middle of the strip does have benefits.

The hotel has a wide range of rooms to fit just about any budget including classic rooms, tower rooms, fancy "Nobu" rooms, multi-room suites, spa suites, exclusive "Laurel" rooms, and, of course, Forum Tower Emperors Suites for bachelor parties made famous in Hangover. In room amenities vary depending on the class of the accommodations. Don't forget about the mandatory $28 Resort Fee per day when booking your stay, too.

Headliner acts often do short stints at Caesars so if you are a fan of Celine Dion, Jerry Seinfeld, Elton John, Shania Twain, Jeff Dunham, Rod Stewart, or one of the other star acts then purchase tickets online early. Absinthe is an adults-only show five nights a week that blends a cabaret vibe and raunchy humor with acrobatic skills.

Even if you don't stay at Caesars Palace, the dining and shopping options are worth a visit. The Forum Shops is a huge indoor mall of stores and restaurants under a blue sky. It's an experience to see at least once and take in the architecture, statues, and animatronic performance at the large fountain. 

For eating at Caesars, Bacchanal is the current "it" buffet with lines and prices that will make you wonder if "it" is really worth it. There are dozens of other options including chains like The Palm, Spago, Joe's Seafood, Cheesecake Factory, and such. Other name restaurants to consider are Guy Savoy, Nobu, Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, and Gordon Ramsey's Pub.

Obviously, Caesars Palace is much more than a casino. The gaming areas are relatively clean and smoke-free. Slot machines seem everywhere or sit down to play poker or blackjack for awhile.

Self-parking is free in the structure behind Caesars while valet is convenient (except when they are busy). Because Caesars Palace is in the heart of the Las Vegas strip, it is convenient to the Bellagio, Paris, Cosmopolitan, Mirage, Treasure Island, and the Venetian.

Caesars Palace has remained remarkably relevant for over 50 years. Even though it isn't among the elite hotel resorts in Vegas, the "Spartacus meets Rodeo Drive" vibe is well maintained with plenty of attractions, restaurants, and shops to attract visitors and guests.

Swankified and fun atmosphere, especially when you have DJ's like Afrojack and David Guetta in the house! This is a nightclub that seriously knows how to party.

Guide to having a good time at XS:

1. Go on a night with topnotch DJ's whose music you can groove to for many hours.

2. Get a VIP table + bottle service if you can fork up the money. IT'S WORTH IT.

3. Look around. Lots of interesting/strange characters!

4. Dance. Laugh. Have a good time.

The layout at XS is great because you get a great view of the DJ from almost every angle. The outdoor area features a pool where crazy antics take place. There is minimal seating for the general public -- gotta stand if you don't pay up. If you're okay on your feet for hours you'll be fine, but ladies know it is SO worth it to have a table. Not to mention service from the hostesses is excellent and they're also pretty cute.

My favorite part of the night was dancing up on the cushions of our booth seats (happy feet!). It was comfy as well as an awesome vantage point. We could see: 1) all the oddly dressed and/or super drunk people around us and 2) AFROJACK+GUETTA as they dropped those beats!

DATE TIP (Gentlemen): Make a note of the paragraph above regarding seating. The ladies will love you if you have a table. Or at least visit you to rest their feet. ;)

DATE TIP (Ladies): Cushion dancing is awesome, but at an elevated height one is much more prone to creative pickup lines. A small price to pay for the view you get!

We were sooo happy when Sam Fox opened one of his Zinburgers here in Scottsdale Quarter.  Our taste buds leaped for joy.  

We've always enjoyed their Biltmore location. And even though the service here could be better and the location enlarged, the burgers were...  great. 

We returned last evening for our fourth visit. I would plan on a thirty minute wait, but that will allow you to hit some of the nearby stores. The time went by quickly, with a band playing in the promenade.  Nice!

We started off with their yummy fried zucchini sticks ($7.00), adding the Chipotle Mayo dip to the Ranch was a great idea. I decided to try their Kale Caesar ($4.50). It was good, but needed a little more dressing. 

As for our burgers, we ordered the Breakfast ($12.50) open face and their house Zin($10.50).  Mine had an fried egg on top, with applewood bacon,
avocado, cheese, lettuce and mayo; while the Zin had manchego cheese, yummy zinfandel Braised Onions with lettuce and mayo.  Both were delicious.

I believe the secret to Zinburger is how they make their burgers.  Rather compacting the chopped meat and squeezing out all the air pockets. They form them gently. That way the smoky taste permeates the meat.

Expect to pay $20 each plus taxes and gratuities, including soft drinks and one appetizer or small salad each.

Enjoy!

Vdara is a winner! It has a ton to offer without having to spend a ton of money for it. During CES/AVN weekend, I was able to book 2 nights here for $169/night, which was the best value on the Strip for that weekend. The City Center hotel is just over a year old, so the rooms are really nicely appointed with modern amenities. Although there is no casino and not much in terms of dining options, it's conveniently located next to The Cosmopolitan, Aria and Bellagio, so it's just a short walk to some of the best gambling, clubs and restaurants in Vegas. An additional upside is that the hotel is clean and smells really nice when you walk through the lobby because no smoking is allowed and they pump this lovely scent through their vents. I wish my house smelled like that. 

My BFF and I enjoyed our suite; bed was super comfy, bathroom was really nice and stocked with Aveda products, and there was a mini kitchenette, great for heating up leftovers at 4am. Our other friends stayed in a similar sized king room that had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains so we got a great view of the water show at night. But the rest of our friends had the best suite of all: the 1,447 square foot 2-story penthouse suite with two bedrooms, 2.5 baths, living room and fully equipped gourmet kitchen. There were 6 people staying here, and at $600/night, it was such a steal. Like I said, you can feel like a big baller without breaking the bank here. Unfortunately, their check-in process was a bit of a nightmare as the suite was not ready at 3pm, but they did give them spa credits.

I'd definitely consider staying here again, especially since it's just a hop, jump and a skip away (ok, maybe a painfully long walk if you've been dancing in stilettos all night) to The Cosmo, my new favorite casino resort.

BurGR is definitely a fun place.

I'm not a big fan of GR's TV persona or schtick.  Though there is something positive to be said about his mercurial nature and focus on detail.  So, given our short eleven hours in Vegas, we decided to come here.

At the heart of BurGR, you'll find some good food and I believe GR poking fun at himself.  The restaurant has several photos, as does the menu, of him hands up in a fit of mock anger.  I believe, there's a wee sparkle and impishness in those eyes.

So, what about the food you say?

It's good!  Very good in fact.  And, those BurGRs are worth every penny of the $14.00 to $17.00 you'll pay to enjoy them.

The reason isn't too hard to understand.  Given that mercurial nature, GR chose to cook the food: "Paying special attention to not only the ingredients but the method, beef patties will be cooked over an open flame fueled by hard woods."  

So it isn't too difficult to see why they have a complex smokey taste, that layers nicely with the various toppings and ingredients. 

We had the American and Euro BurGRs.  The Euro (photo) came with truffle aioli, goat cheese and arugula, while the American came with american cheese, butter lettuce, tomato, pickles and red onion.  Both were delicious, though the Euro was more interesting on the palate.  GR's focus to detail even shows up on the selection of the bun. Nice!

Another WOW if you will, were the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Seems the BurGR fries are "hand-cut and thrice cooking will ensure extra crispness" and they use Kennebec instead of Russet potatoes  which "offering a lighter, less starchy and crisper fry"  

Okay, we agree.  But what makes them special, is the hair like shavings of parmesan cheese (photo) with a special aioli oil sauce for dipping. Ohh, are they good.

So, with a glass of wine, a nice pint of Leinenkugel on tap, a couple of BurGRs and some of those wonderful Truffle Fries, expect to pay around $27.50 each, not including gratuities or taxes.

Enjoy!

I was shopping at the nearby Centennial Center as I do pretty much every week and even though there are many food options within the shopping center, I was bored with those options at the moment. I decided to pull up places on the good ole yelp app and came across Above the Crust. It's on Ann Rd across from Painted Desert, so not too far behind Centennial Center. Deciding to give Above the Crust a try, I stopped in and placed a order. They have so many good deals going on each day! It being Tuesday meant that I could get a large pizza free with the purchase of a large pizza and toppings an additional $2 each. I went with a large cheese and a large pepperoni and added a couple "Garlic Rolls" priced at .95 cents each. I really liked the taste of the pizza and the sauce on it. The rolls had a nice garlic and butter flavor on the outside, the inside was a bit too much bread that was tough. I prefer a more traditional knot personally. When I walked in, I was greeted with a friendly hello from all the employees and I was given a menu and a flyer that shows the current daily specials offered. 

Sunday and Monday ($32.95) - Large pizza, bucket of wings, 4 garlic rolls and a 2 liter of soda.

Two for Tuesday - Buy one large pizza get one free.

Wing Wednesday (24.95) - Sampler bucket of wings, choose up to 4 flavors.

Friday Special ($29.95) - Large pizza and a bucket of fingers.

Stromboli Saturday ($17.95) - Large pizza and any stromboli. 

Daily special ($5.95) - 2 slices and a drink.

They offer delivery and also offer sandwiches, salads and calzones.

I don't write many updated reviews but I believe The Parking Spot deserves some Yelp love.

 I've been using this place for about 4 years and the service is consistently superior. There's covered parking so your car is not baking in the sun so you're less likely to come back with an unbearably hot interior. You get a USA TODAY paper when you enter the facility and a bottled water for each occupant of your car when you leave the facility. That water really hits "The Spot" after being subjected to the heat when you're coming back from a temperate climate. You can sign up for thespotclub which you can link your credit card for payment and keep track of the points you use which can be redeemed for free parking. In fact, I called the customer service people at their corporate headquarters because I changed my email address and couldn't get into the site online. For some reason my points were gone too. But they restored my 2,000 plus points within minutes. I guess they thought I was inactive since I hadn't been on the website in years.

All the shuttle drivers are friendly and take care of your luggage (commercial here, Please tip your drivers). They give you a card to remind you which parking space you parked at such as I211. They respond quickly at the terminal when you call and say you are ready for pick up. I usually fly out of terminal 3 so they pick you up at door number 5 on the North side. The vans are air conditioned, what more do you need.

Also, the people that are at the booths are excellent as well. When you call, they know how to answer your question properly. They direct you where to park and take care of your payments at the booth. The Parking spot advertises in the magazines in front of you on your airplane. So you can usually find a coupon for 20% off. I believe a 24 hour stay is $10.95 without coupon. Also, you can get three hours of parking by showing your AAA Card. So if you want to meet people inside the terminal and don't want to pay for airport parking this is what you do. And if you decide to park for more than 3 hours you can use your AAA Card for a 10% discount. They have another service where they'll wash your car by the time you get back. 

There's a Parking Spot 1 and a Parking Spot 2. This review is for Parking Spot 1 on Washington street.

The Cosmopolitan's  "grand social experiment".  It delivers!

Walk in to be greeted by five doors.  Some leading into turn of the century meets Star Trek rooms, others, well...  Spaces morph, the experience evolves, life happens all around you.  Live bands, eclectic music, spontaneous vaudeville acts and a stage production, good food, great craft cocktails.  You need to experience it to understand.

Essentially it's a craft cocktail ultra lounge, stage production, and mega club and restaurant all in one.

Breaking it down:

Craft Cocktails - Excellent, many reinvented, from classics.  Very consistent (a rarity when some cocktails contain 10+ ingredients).

Stage Production (Vegas Nocturne) -  Similar to Absinthe.  Acrobatics, comedy, tap dancing, strip teases. No more details as you are sworn to secrecy.  

Club - Still need to experience this.

Restaurant - Inventive and indulgent.  Many items to be shared like the outstanding caviar mini tacos (Yukon gold shells filled with hamachi and drowned in caviar), deconstructed oysters Rockefeller (fried oysters on a bacon butter sauted spinach and bacon dust in an oyster shell) or the tete de cochon (deep fried panko crusted head cheese topped with a poached egg).

For larger dishes, the reinvented beef Wellington (beef tenderloin with a generous portion of seared foie, trumpet mushrooms, studded with cream spinach, topped with shaved black truffle and crowned by a flaky, latticed puff pastry is very good albeit rich.

Incredible caviar service (five types sold by the ounce, half kilo, kilo).

Outstanding wine and champagne list.  Ultra lounge prices.

Tip;  To make the most of your experience:
1.  Make a night of it.  Drinks, dinner, and the show.
2.  Move through the rooms.  There is something different in each.
3.  Make reservations if you want to eat a full meal.
4.  Purchase your tickets in advance for the show.  Don't skimp.  Pay the $135 for the best seats.
5.  Shows are not the same.  The later you go, the edgier.
6.  Be prepared to spend $$$$.  The show, dinner, and some cocktails averages $300 per person.  Add some caviar and bottles of wine and it's easy to drop several dimes.

Now if only I can remember how Alice got home after falling down the rabbit hole.

"GO WEST, YOUNG MAN" 

That was one of the first things to pop into my mind when I first heard about our much loved Frost Bites Shavery opening a possible new second location somewhere near Chinatown.  Now that FBS has opened at Seoul Plaza (where you can find: Raku, Monta Ramen, Big Wong, Japanese Curry Zen, Trattoria Nakamura-Ya, Kabuto and that awkward "massage" place where tourists leaves via taxi with a big grin on them faces) rebranded itself as SnowFlake Shavery, the famous partial quote by the American author Horace Greeley  about westward expansion and Manifest Destiny could be applied to our favorite shaved snow biz from Hendertucky.  +2 for just being soooo mucho more closer to the Westsiders. 

For those that have not tried shaved snow from SFS before, it is not the shaved ice you might have tried before with colorful syrups poured over the coarse shaved ice.  It is a more refined icy treat with powder snow or frozen cotton candy-like melt-in-your-mouth experience.  Think shaved ice version 2.3, so to speak.  All made with 100% NATURAL INGREDIENTS, no artificial flavorings or syrups used (which is the reason why taro is not one of the available flavors - sadly artificial taro flavorings trumps all natural taro shaved ice made from real taro only).

Ordering 101:

Step 1:  Choose a size: Small, Large, Monster
Step 2:  Choose a flavor:  From Vanilla, Cantaloupe to Green Tea and Black Sesame.
Step 3:  Add a topping ($0.50 per selection):  Fresh fruits to candy and cereal.
Step 4:  Top it off with a sauce (first one free, +$0.25 after that one):  Condensed Milk, Strawberry Condensed Milk, Chocolate and Caramel.

If you are not sure, they also have helpful combos for you to pick from or help jump start your shaved snow creativity.  Although I have had Green Tea and Black Sesame Shaved Snow all by itself, and didn't think it needed any toppings or sauce. It is that good!

Come and try it now that it is closer for everyone that does not live in Henderson.

I think it is better than the ones I tried in SoCal and Taiwan (except the fresh mango from Taiwan is way better).

Here are just a sampling of other real customer testimonials:

Cathy C loves this place, because it is dessert sans guilt.
Sandy K said it is so good it is like [frozen] crack.
Norm K said Mango with coconut sounds good to me!
Philip T thinks he like this more than frozen yogurt now.
Roger T thinks Green Tea + Mochi + just a drizzle of Condensed Milk is dessert heaven.

So what you be waitin' for? Come get some SnowFlake!

Are you a wanna be competitive eater?  Member of a Greek fraternal organization looking for out of the box activities?  Do the Shaved Block Ice challenge!  Successful competitors earn the coolest bragging rights in town + extra(?)


DISCLAIMER:  To harry I:  I am not a shill (I am deeply offended by being called that even if I had to first look it up in a dictionary).  And I am not a professional reviewer, but I will take that as a compliment.  And I believe in paying for the products and services from businesses (I want to review the customer service and experience that everyone gets), and writing a honest review of my personal experience.  If I happened to be passionate about it and write the review with flair, all the better.  Being new to Yelp you should read Yelp's Terms of Service, plus the site's Content Guidelines and Review Guidelines.  You can go back to tell your celebrity chef friend that if he is really passionate about the food he serves, he will not be using artificial powders. Is his product bad? NO.  But it is like comparing real orange juice (SnowFlake Shavery) to SunnyD (KSC).

I was going to wait for an actual ABBA fan to write their 5 star review but it has been 3 weeks since the show started and people need to be informed dammit!!  My opinion comes off almost like a "significant other that gets dragged to the show" but my wife is not an ABBA fan.  I got free tickets through work. 

Also.....

- I generally despise Broadway shows.  "Rock of Ages" makes me wretch.  
- Never hearing "Dancing Queen" again would be a gift.
- Not familiar with the "Mamma Mia!" story.

The will call booth for Tropicana was a total mess.  It was 50 people deep 30 minutes before the show.  Definitely get there as early as you can to pick up tickets.  We ended up missing the first 15 minutes of the show because of it.  Tropicana either needs to employ more people or have an attendant weed out the people in line who are there to pick up or purchase tickets.  As we walked in, the usher didn't show us to our seats.  She just said "Sit anywhere! The show is about to go on again!".  Ummm..okay.  So I did what any person would do and took the first 2 seats closest to the stage.  The place was about 70% full and it took us about 20 minutes to figure out what was going on in the story.

All the performers seemed perfect for their roles and the singing was well done.  The stage set was pretty basic but you were able to get the idea.  I was most impressed with the live band behind the scenes.  Some of the transitions were tricky and I wished I had a backstage TV a la Le Reve to see them jamming out to "Money, Money, Money" or the almost made for a musical "The Winner Takes It All".    

Tropicana did a great job refurbishing the theater.  The makeover looks terrific.    The bar upfront shouldn't serve wine in actual glasses since I heard a couple of them shatter during the show which was distracting.  There was also 20 minute intermission midway through.

If you love ABBA, I see no reason why you wouldn't love this show.  I observed many attendees clapping along, getting pretty animated during some scenes and even reciting lines.  And if you're being dragged to the show against your will by that special someone in your life..bring a flask?

I finally made it over to Pink Box Doughnuts to see what everyone has been raving about. I will say one thing, you cannot compare Pink Box to places like Dunkin' Donuts or Winchell's because they are simply different. After having Pink Box, I can't see ever going to one of those chains again when I can go to a locally owned shop and taste the love in each bite. These doughnuts are made from scratch daily.

They have the doughnuts broken down into 3 different types: classic, specialty and gourmet. The classic such as "Glazed" or "Buttermilk" are $1 each. The specialty doughnuts like the "Bavarian Creme" are $1.25 each and gourmet favorites like the "Fat Elvis" or "Date With A Nutty Pig" are $1.75 each. They have half and full dozen boxes (pink of course!) with prices ranging from $8.50 - $12.50 for those.

I saw on Facebook they were now selling "Cronuts" so of course I asked about those. They were sold out! I spoke with Lance behind the counter who said they had made Cronuts 3 times that day already. I went just after 11 am so apparently people are scrambling to try them. Not having tried the original from NYC, how can I really compare it though? I guess I just want to taste it and get some sort of idea what it might be like. I will try again! Lance says you can just call ahead and if they have the menu item you are looking for then they will hold it for you. 

So I decided that I needed to try the "Fat Elvis" after hearing about it and I am kicking myself for not trying this sooner. DELICIOUS! It is just flat out good! The Fat Elvis is topped with chocolate icing & a caramelized banana, and filled with a homemade peanut butter & banana filling. This doughnut had me feeling stingy since I didn't want to share a single bite with hubby, but I had to darn it!

The 'Apple Fritter" needs some work. The texture is perfect. It is soft and chewy inside, and crunchy on the outside where it needs to be. The thing that gets me is why it's called an apple fritter if there are no apples in it? I didn't bite into a single apple! Boo-Hoo!

When I saw a Doughnut with fruit loops on it I had to give it a try. I was told by a worker that this was called the "Fruit Loop Doughnut" and I get the fun concept, but it just doesn't work. The long glazed doughnut is really good, but the fruit loops they put on top just absorb the glaze they rest on so they are soggy and chewy. 

Last and certainly not least is the "Cinnamon Tornado" and I have to tell you, it lives up to the name. When I took the first bite it was like a tornado of instant flavor, and it seriously melted inside my mouth. Very yummy.

There was a sign out front that said they are now open 24 hours on weekends.

A lifesaver during my last Vegas trip. My first mistake: assuming everything there would be fattening and unhealthy like every other crepe place. But wait! They have fresh cleansing juices. Oh my! I've never been into juicing but this place changed my mind for sure. 

Have you ever become FITTER during a Vegas trip?!? Well, it happened to me. I was very pleased with the surprising results. How did it happen?

All hail the **Detoxifyer**! Densely packed with kale, celery, apple, beet, ginger, and lemon, the juice is delicious compared to many of the healthy concoctions out there. Of course it can't compare to a sugary juice, but it does soooo much more.

I had arrived in Vegas knowing I would be attending a pool party at Wet Republic after 4 days of eating terribly. There were no vegetables or good salad options anywhere around. So I had a feeling I'd gain weight by the time I had to don a bikini. But hey! Detoxifyer to the rescue! One juice once a day for 3 days was enough to do the trick. On the 4th day I put on my swimsuit and was actually impressed. I couldn't believe it.

If you need something more substantial to eat (I did), try **The Fitness** crepe and add Alfredo chicken to the mushroom spinachy mozzarella goodness. I split one of these with with my friend and also had the Detoxifyer.

The only thing I'd change about this place is the system to indicate when orders are ready. They have to shout the order number out and then people come up and take items without having to show a receipt. Maybe a more automated system that shows a number and patrons have to show proof of purchase. My order was stolen twice! Granted the MGM Grand was overrun by about 15,000 people from my company's convention. But still, such a system would help even on a daily basis.

Overall I love Blizz for introducing healthy juice options to me. Thank you to the clerks for the recommendation! And special thanks to the Detoxifyer! You've really opened my eyes.

DATE TIP: The Detoxifyer will definitely get you ready for your next hot Vegas date. 

TIP: [[[ T.M.I. Alert ]]] Remember that what you put in must also come out. You may have to use the restroom slightly more often than before, and things may look the same color as when you consumed them. The Detoxifyer is a vivid pomegranate color. Haha, I told you it was TMI. You've been warned!

I have been stopping by here for lunch and like the subs I have had. Inside is very clean and the employees are friendly and say hello when I walk in. They have plenty of tables if you want to eat inside, but I get my food to-go. The meat is sliced fresh and the sandwiches are made to order. Sometimes they can get busy around lunch time and since I'm on a time limit for lunch, I just call in my order for pick up so that it's ready when I arrive. 

Hook and Ladder - A medium costs $5.99 and includes a pickle. The sub has smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham and monterey jack cheese. I like it "fully involved" which means it comes with deli mustard, mayo, onion, lettuce and tomato. Per my request they leave the lettuce off. The subs are served hot and this sub is my favorite of them all. Usually I don't like deli mustard, but there is something about it on this particular sub that just makes it taste great. 

Firehouse Meatball - A large costs $8.49 and depending on your appetite could be shared between two people. This sub has Italian meatballs, provolone, marinara and Italian seasonings. I usually order this one "sweet and spicy" which means they add pepper sauce and red pepper flakes. I really like this meatball sub a lot. It's always hot, the bread good, meatballs good, melted cheese good, but..... there is a consistency issue with the taste of the sweet and spicy part. Sometimes it's just right and sometimes they put so much pepper sauce that it's too hot. When this sub is good it's very good, but when it's drenched in pepper sauce it's hard to taste anything else. 

The medium sub is just perfect for my appetite. If you are the type like my husband who eats 1 footers, you might want to order the large sandwich. They also offer catering.

Straight out of Cali and family owned. This location was originally built to be a Dunkin' Donuts, but DD never opened. I'm glad Tom's swooped in! You will find a variety of options on the menu here from burgers, tacos, burritos, sandwiches, bacon & eggs, pancakes, steak, pork chops,  fish & chips, salads, smoothies, and Mediterranean & Greek options, and believe it or not much more! They have some pretty good all day specials if you like breakfast.  Seniors 55+ get a free cup of coffee with any breakfast or lunch purchase.

Hubby and I decided to split the "Pastrami Sandwich Combo" priced at $9.59 plus 40 cents for cheese. The combo came with fries and a drink. I also wanted to try the "Zucchini" priced at $3.99 and it came with a side of ranch. The pastrami sandwich was SO good. The bread held up the sandwich well and the mustard and pickles were just right. I know this is something that I will for sure be back for. Good pastrami in Vegas is hard to come by. The fries were excellent. I wasn't actually crazy about the zucchini. The ranch that it came with was a decent size though. They make the onion rings and zucchini from scratch. I want to try the onion rings next time, but will pass on the zucchini again. 

They have a drive-thru if you don't want to eat inside. The burgers are made fresh to order and the steak and chicken is hand trimmed on site. There are a lot of things I want to try here at Tom's so I will be back!

During a 2+ hour layover in PHX, we were headed to La Madeleine to get soup for the wife when we saw the French Onion Soup on the menu here.  Since we can do "La Mad" back home, we said what the heck and stopped in to Zinc.

Now, as everyone knows, French Onion Soup is general served with a "crouton" on top, on which the cheese melts.  But if you're gluten free like the wife, they'll just melt the Gruyre cheese right on the top of the soup-filled crock.  Even though it would probably have been more fun to be able to have the cheese on toasted bread on top (poor wife), she was pleased with the soup.

And speaking of Gruyre...  The truffled Gruyre Zinc Burger was as amazing as it looked.  Five stars right there.

The dessert we chose was some sort of chocolate bread pudding/cake situation, with a side of ice cream with "house made caramel sauce on top".  Eh.... Fairly forgettable (we didn't finish it, even splitting it between the two of us... well, wife could only have the ice cream).  Maybe pastry isn't their strong suit.  

Overall, it's pricy because of the airport premium, and it's trying a bit too hard to be a "bistro" (which for some reason, makes people think they should charge 10% more).  And we didn't have to wait very long for our food, which is necessary in an airport.  I was pretty happy with my burger, "frites", and beer, and there were plugs available between the tables to top off the devices. 

3.86 stars.  Which for an airport dining stop, is pretty darn good.

The decor for this place was definitely the best part. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f1eeViD_rhRG4-MIFgZsEA

It was a nice day so we got seated on the terrace overlooking the Vegas strip.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=FR6MuipnPqtxwIo9BUVZHA

There are some hotties working up in here.  I kept drooling over one of the waiters.  He was Asian, built, slight scruff, and had tattoos on his right arm.  I wanted to order him and take him to go but he wasn't on the menu :(

Order:  Crab cake, mac and cheese, pomme frites, Croque madame, and shrimp cocktail.  For dessert we ordered the caramel tart and the chocolate terrine.  

Crab cake came served with a remoulade and topped with a frisee salad.  It was actually pretty good, nice and meaty with large chunks of crab, yet it was still crispy and held up.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=p_zZ9eP10crf4OoTMMPw-w

Shrimp Cocktail came with huge jumbo shrimp.  I'm not a big cold shrimp fan so it was just okay for me.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f0eXikNX8SVFSiTNYpvs2Q

Croque Madame is basically a ham and cheese sandwich topped with an egg.  I wouldn't order it.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=hz67b-rY5NF_D8MfoFhpyw

Mac and Cheese came out awesome looking, but upon further tasting it fell pretty flat.  It needed something to lighten it up and give it some flavor.  My friend squeezed some lemon on it and she said it made it a lot better.  They need to work out that recipe and give it some ooomph!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=xWVNfswLh_diFTC__WeVMg

The chocolate terrine was too dark for me.  I normally enjoy dark chocolate but this was a tad too bitter for me.  It just tasted like straight up cocoa powder.  I wouldn't order it again.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=LeYT8q4sUDeDQrM6-jxIeA

The caramel tart was really good, but the crust was super stiff and thick which normally I like :)  but not in a dessert.  Flavor-wise though, it was the better of the two.  It came with caramel ice cream and candied macadamian nuts and wafers.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=Uv9LtnwzyrTIZFS6DEGv3w

The waiter was cordial and accommodating.  He was telling us about life in Vegas because I was thinking about applying to schools there.  Overall, it was a nice relaxing meal.  There were highs and lows but pretty solid still.

Ellis Island, you are dead to me!

Oh Ellis Island, I have been a fan for over 10 years. I have been a loyal customer. I have sung your praises from mountain tops. I brought my friends to enjoy the goodness (or should I say former goodness) of your $7.99 steak dinner. But no more! After the experience I had last night, you are indeed now dead to me and hopefully to all the people who read this review.

Ellis Island, I stuck with the even after you continually raised the price of your steak dinner from $4.99 to $5.99 to $6.99 to what it is now $7.99.

Ellis Island, I stuck with you despite the increasingly awful service...your employees have no sense of urgency nor do they understand customer service.

Ellis Island, I stuck with you even after finding out that your "center cut sirloin" is indeed just beef scraps combined with meat glue, rolled up into a loaf and cut into "steaks."

But, after the experience I had last night with your obnoxious, insensitive, offensive, bully of a restaurant manager I will never visit your establishment again.

I arrived on a Monday night at 9:15pm very excited and hungry. I was really looking forward to a "steak" dinner. We were unenthusiastically "greeted" by a hostess who told us there was a 20 minute wait. Odd, the restaurant was more than half empty...in fact the casino was almost empty. The hostess then directed my attention to a printer paper sign stating the kitchen is being cleaned and anyone who arrives after 9:30 pm will only be able to order off of a limited menu. As we were given a 20 minute wait time I asked the hostess if we would be able to get the steak dinner...she said no. I told her we were there now and if we were seated by 9:30, the supposed cut off time, would we be able to order the steak dinner...she said no. I explained we came specifically for the steak dinner, having walked from the strip, and asked if there was any way we could get the steak dinner...she said no. I then asked to speak to the manager.

After a long wait the manager finally arrived...with a security guard. Really, a security guard? Please look at my Yelp picture...do I look like a threat? The manager stood about 2 inches from my face and proceeded to tell me No over and over again. He kept interrupting me when I pointed out his restaurant was empty, that the hostess was specifically giving wait times so that that people would have to order off the limited menu, etc. I told him his manner and policies were completely unacceptable. I finally just asked, "Am I going to be able to order a steak dinner?" He got even closer to me and yelled, "No!" I then informed him that I would make sure to tell everyone about this terrible experience and he yelled in a close and threatening manner, "Don't threaten me!" I told him that I was not threatening, just informing him that this is what is going to happen and this is what happens when people receive horrible customer service like this. We then walked out, while the manager continued to yell at us.

Amazing! I have never had an experience like this. Just an FYI to you my Yelp friends...this is the experience you can expect from Ellis Island. Inferior food, inferior service, all served up to you by a manager who is a bully. Enter at your own risk.

Maybe ramen really is the new pizza!  It's kind of mind blowing how I was dying for just one legit ramen joint in Las Vegas only a few years back and now I could do a week straight without going to the same spot.  I'd also have to chug 500 gallons of water during said week but still....

I was looking for a basic, no frills ramen and their "Tonkotsu Assari" fit that bill perfectly.  Our server also mentioned it was his favorite.  Assari consisted of pork broth, chashu, green onion, egg and bean sprouts, but the thick noodles were the clincher for me.  Most of Jinya's ramen offerings come with thin noodles which I am usually not down with although I didn't ask if they would substitute.  

It's a good thing they put me at a corner table since I slurped my face off.  From top to bottom, it was solid through and through.  There is better chashu to be had in town, but this was still a nice bowl of satisfaction.  I'd also skip the salad (dressing was gross) plus gyoza add-on and opt for another tapas dish instead.  

To my knowledge, Jinya is also the first and only spot in Vegas to do takoyaki the right way.  I've had so many awful versions of it since moving from Japan that I had given up hope.  I was delirious after my first bite!  The light crunch, generous chunks of octopus with its signature sauce, mayonnaise and dried bonito flakes put my taste buds on another planet.  It was a terrific dish that I will be having multiple times in the future.  Love that they're open until 3am!!  

Good call with giving only the ladies the nice Toto toilet.  :P

Ashlee Simpson celebrated her birthday at Wet Republic last weekend: Hot.

I celebrated my birthday at Wet Republic this weekend: HOTTER!

You know you're having a truly fabulous time if you're taking shots with complete strangers and then find yourself having a chicken fight with random people in the pool. 

There's eye candy galore for all; everyone there is beautiful. We even spotted a Brad Pitt and Angelina look-a-like couple. They could have really been there, but we were so sloshed, who knows. 

We arrived early - at 11am to be exact. Doors opened five minutes later, and since we were pretty much the only people there, all of us girls got in free. Surprisingly, there was no line, since you typically have to get there at least half an hour before doors open to get in line. We were also lucky to get first pick of chairs (green lounge chairs inside the pool are the only free seats), so we got the best ones near the pool. We got the two $100 chairs (the drink/food minimum) on one end of the pool that were situated in their own little cove with two green chairs right next to them. 

The $100 minimum is easily met, especially if you get pitchers of their frozen drinks (the frozen watermelon mojitos are awesome), which start at $75. Plus the food is really yummy, and are huge portions meant for sharing. We got a bucket of tasty chicken tenders and waffle fries, and the Philly cheese steak quesadillas (only so-so). 

Although the pool was pretty dead to start, it got crazy later on. Now, if you can party all day here, in the sun, drinking non-stop, and still be able to go out clubbing until 4am, I take my hat off to you; you are a true rockstar.

FINALLY!! I've been waiting for this location to open f-o-r-e-v-e-r! With the location on the Strip closing, it couldn't have come at a better time. Walking in I saw the usual lines for adobada, asada, etc. You have to pay attention to the signs so you know what line to get in. I only ever get adobada, so I usually go straight to that line and hubby usually goes straight to the asada line. Sometimes I do feel like an asada taco, so hubby just gets mine when he gets his and that saves time and my food from getting cold. This last visit the line wasn't bad at all and the place had a good amount of heads in it. I only waited maybe 5 minutes in the adobada line and hubby waited less than that in his line. The wait time will no doubt change depending on the day at time, but the wait is worth it. I had an "Adobada Taco" ($2) and an "Adobada Mulas" ($4, I requested mine to me made on flour tortillas) and they were both so good! I asked for them both with pineapple and the dude hooked me up with a fair amount. The adobada has such great flavor and is very addicting! The taste just keeps you wanting more. They do have seating inside, but I noticed they are working on the other part of the building, so maybe they will add more seating there?? That will be good for those who like to eat inside, but a lot of people, myself included, just eat at our cars. They offer a variety of meats including asada, adobada, lengua, sesos, buche, tripa, suadero and chorizo. You can get any of these meats in a taco, mulas, tostadas, vampiro, sopes and even over fries. This place is absolutely legit when it comes to tacos and I'll be a regular for sure!

I have never fully appreciated nouveau cuisine. It has always left me a little hungry and a few Benjamins short. LOL 

Our introduction to Cantina Laredo was somewhat inauspicious, since they misplaced our reservations on a busy Friday night.  

We also had the same experience with the hostesses that fellow Yelp'er Teehee wrote about.  But in end, we had a nice evening, with our bill coming in at the low end.  

After the confusion and a five minute wait, we were seated near the patio. It was a nice location and we had the added bonus of observing a pre-wedding family dinner of eighteen. 

Cantina Laredo likes to market itself as serving "modern Mexican food in a sophisticated, vibrant atmosphere. ... with a Mexico City style menu."  I believe it's more Mexican petite nouveau cuisine. 

We started off with a delivery of chips and two types of salsa. The milder version had a nice tomato base. But it was the spicier one, with fire roasted peppers that was the standout. It was complex and so delicious, that you could have eaten it with a spoon. 

Next was their table-side guacamole making called Top Shelf for $9.99. It was an exquisite. Now I make this all the time at home, yet it always seems tastier when someone else is doing it. LOL

Somewhere along the way our white honey sangria was dropped off. It was very good and fairly priced served in large 12 oz flute glass. Nice!

For dinner we decided to share two entrees. One was their Vera Cruz Enchiladas (photo), which was a nice mixture of spinach and chicken for $13.99; and the other was the Carnitas Tacos for $13.79.  The enchiladas had a nice flavor and kick. Both were very good, with the street tacos seeming deceptively small. 

The bill came to about $30 a person including drinks, but before taxes and gratuities. 

So Four Stars, and yes we are Fans of Cantina Laredo. While eating here might not get you a doggie bag for later, you will go home feeling as though you've enjoyed something special.  Remember to make reservations like we did! LOL

Bouchon is THE ideal brunch spot after a long night (and/or morning) in Las Vegas. Roll out of bed (or the club) and get yourself over here for some hearty delicious grub! 

Anna R. and I strolled over in the hot sun and arrived around 11 AM. We were told there would be a 25 minute wait. Since we hadn't eaten much the day before, we were practically starving. Luckily they offer seating at the bar, so we gratefully decided to sit there.

We each ordered a Croque Madame -- Anna highly recommended it and the description on the menu made the dish undeniable. I had no other choice. While we eagerly waited, we each enjoyed a refreshing **Hibiscus Cocktail**. Just the right amount of bubbly and lightly sweet for a morning meal. The candied hibiscus at the bottom of the glass was delicious! 

When the **Croque Madame** finally arrived, I wasn't quite ready for what I saw. Beautiful presentation -- a sunny side egg perfectly placed atop a ham and cheese sandwich with thick bread, accompanied by a huge mound of french fries. As I cut this creation open, I happily observed the cheese oozing out from within the folds of the sandwich. I was also very pleased when the egg yolk started running all over the absorbent bread and the rest of the sandwich. HEAVEN. And those fries are extremely addictive and come in a dangerously generous portion.

Service at the bar was excellent. The bartenders checked on us frequently and made sure we were taken care of. My only complaint is that it took around 30 minutes to get our food. The restaurant seemed to be understaffed on Labor Day Sunday, as there were several tables available that were not being used. I was surprised that an establishment of this caliber would not be fully staffed for a holiday when lots of hungry folks would be waiting for a table.

OVERALL: Extremely pleased with the food and service, but I hope they can fully staff all their meals so there aren't such long waits and unallocated tables.

DATE TIP: This is a super cute breakfast/brunch spot with French decor and a warm vibe. Consider taking your date here in the morning after a fun night!

So long Pink's, hello The Wiener's Circle! I was sad to see Pink's go, but the location was never going to work with the jacked up prices and confusion with the names they gave the hot dogs compared to what they are actually called at the original location in California. So, The Wiener's Circle enters in its spot. Will it last? Time will tell! I must admit, I did watch the TV show they had on a while back and found the games they played with the customers (at night they curse at the customers and play crazy ass games... It's intended, expected to all customers and hilarious) funny. I was surprised they opened up in Vegas, but hey it saved me the trip to Chicago for the moment! The original location in Chicago has been in business for over 30 years.

Looking over the menu board, I was surprised at how fair the prices were. The prices here range from about $2-$3 higher depending on the item compared to the Chicago menu. Being in a casino we can expect higher prices, but they weren't too outrageous. I ordered "Wieners in a Blanket" priced at $4.99 for 6. They are made fresh to order. I had my choice of sauce and chose honey mustard. That honey mustard had a real good flavor and paired nicely with the tasty blanketed wieners. They also come 12 to a order, but the 6 was good enough for me. Priced at $4.99 I also ordered "Cheddar Fries" and wow were they good! The fries are fresh cut and come 1 pound per order. The cheese they put on top was very good! Hubby and I split a "Char Polish" priced at $6.99 and came with mustard, relish, onions, pickle, tomato, celery salt and sport peppers. It was pretty good. Next time I would ask for a lighter char, but a decent hot dog with nice toppings. All the burgers and dogs come with those toppings unless you tell them to leave it off. They are happy to customize your order so just ask! If you are in a pinch for time you can phone your order ahead and just pick it up. Aside from lunch and dinner they also serve breakfast and offer Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

Dang, Cantina Laredo - I wanted to like you so hard!  Like a hot date that ends in a restraining order, like an incredible hike that ends in poison oak or skunk spray - I've walked past this place for years, imagining a swanky, high-end Mexican food joint behind the dark windows and high prices; sadly, what I found was a very regular, uninspired restaurant serving up some rather meh Mexican food.  This was a 'man behind the curtain' Wizard of Oz moment for me.

Good things?  Mmmmmm - the warm spicy salsa which they serve along with another milder cold one (not so good) and chips is the reason this place gets 2 very enthusiastic stars from me - SO DELICIOUS!  It was hook-me-up-to-a-feed-bag delicious.  Service was quick and pleasant.

After that though, it all goes downhill.  Being vegetarian, I can 99% of the time find something meatless and tasty when I go out to eat but there were very few such options here.  I ended up selecting the Enchiladas de Espinaca and subbed in a Cheese & Onion one to shake things up a bit (I know, I'm very exciting).  When my meal came out, the waitress said she had the kitchen put zucchini alongside my Mexican rice instead of beans (wtf - who in their right mind opts out of beans for zucchini at a Mexican food restaurant?!); so began the first of my meal modifications - I might note here that while being veggie, I am a pretty low-maintenance diner.  So, just as the black beans are being brought out, I realize the sauce atop my cheese enchilada consists of red chili with beef chunks - again wtf - in my 31 years of life on this earth, no Mexican food joint I've ever visited has ever converted a cheese enchilada to a meat one via the sauce!  The waitress said they could make me a new cheese & onion with sour cream sauce atop (cringe).  The mushroom and spinach enchilada was kinda gross - something about the oil they used to saut the spinach in gave it a strange taste and the button mushrooms looked like they had been plunked into it straight out of a can.  The zucchini and cheese & onion enchilada were nothing I would ever want to order again.  Black beans were alright - hard to mess those up though.  

In defense of Cantina Laredo, if you're a big meat eater, perhaps you might have more luck here than I.  The place was clean, the workers were nice, the one aforementioned salsa is killer.  But this place is neither authentic nor new-agey Mexican, not worthy of the steeper price points, and certainly lacks any great ambience to carry the lackluster food.  Don't think I will be auditioning this place for a second date or hike - would strongly consider rolling around in poison oak or getting skunk sprayed over coming back - it was that bad.

**This place looses a star because I got hasseled for writing this review!!* 
The Heard is many things to many people. 

For Non-natives it is a place to learn about the various cultures of ancient, recent historical and modern Native Culture. 

For Natives of the southwest - it is a place where we are understood and celebrated.

There are so many things I love about this place and I am pleased to share with you my favorite spots in the museum.
- The Navajo Sand painting that is displayed the Navajo Hogan in the Homelands Exhibit. It depicts the Navajo Creation Story and is intricate and beautiful.

- The Hopi Wedding Dress inside the Homelands Exhibit

- The Photograph of the Grave yard outside the Indian School in the Boarding School Experience. 

- The Statue of Native women outside the museum. 

- The Yazzie Mural inside the We Are exhibit. It depicts the story of the Navajo and Yaqui Tribe's modern history. 

-The beaded chucks in the Shoes exhibit! I want a pair!!

When it comes to the Heard's Gift shop: now this place is amazing!! Many of their pieces are authentic and hand crafted. BUT THERE ARE FAKES AMONG THEM!!! Feel free to ask a lot of questions. Even try to negotiate prices. You never know, some of those pieces have been there for YEARS! Demand certificates of authenticity. Ask to know the meaning of symbols and designs. Know what materials they're made out of! 

There could be two bracelets that almost identical and one could be silver plated and one could be solid silver. And they could both be priced the same. ASK QUESTIONS!! Ask to try to stuff on. They are usually pretty nice about this, except when it comes to earrings. Many hard to find books can be found here. Whenever someone is doing a research project, the Heard is one of the first places I recommend. I recommend the photography books.

Their exhibits are always changing. So check the website and see what's new. Have fun, bring a friend, and open your mind and see the many wonderful facets of Native American Culture.

****UPDATE****
One of our fellow yelpers Deb K. http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sGzHUN7UpjXUGKckrv-bTw has sent me private messages asking me to edit my review and I am! She believes and knows that all the pieces are authentic at the Heard's Gift Shop. 

She has said and I quote: "Hi Cher, Deb K. here--actually, I do work at the Heard and I can tell you that everything that we sell is authentic."  and she even goes on to say, "Maybe you're thinking about those dreamcatchers and whatnots in the back? Even those have to come from a Native-owned and operated establishment. [although I do agree they're kind of tacky, but you know the bilagaanas (White People)...they do like their kitschy stuff]" And what really got me was: "I really feel you should go back and change the part about the shop offering 'fake' items". 

As a Native American, sometimes it's a love/hate relationship with the Heard. The Heard is the premier launching pad for non-natives in this city to experience Indian Country but sometimes it comes at a price. We are often objectified and practically forced to share that which is sacred to us. But it's allowed and it's a choice that each Native artist that has dealt with has the Heard made for themselves. 

There is an unequal representation of Tribes on display at the Heard, the Navajo exhibit is HUGE at the Heard and yet the O'odham exhibit is medium sized. Even though O'odhams have contributed over $1,000,000.00 to the museum. We don't complain, atleast our ways are being shared right? And it's nice to take children to the museum and see their little eyes light up when they see things that reminds them of home. And the Boarding School Exhibit opens MANY eyes to the history that existed just a few blocks north. This slices through me and I'm so grateful this piece of history is no longer being ignored.

Like I said - it's a love/hate relationship. I love the Heard because they give opportunities to Native Artists and share our culture as sensitively as possible. But it's an uphill battle to be deemed good enough to be one of those artists and people who shares our culture. I know of many great people who I personally feel should be "let in" be denied and my heart goes out to them. I love that Natives still get in for free but I hate that the Heard treats AZ tribes like we're obligated to help them to keep their lights on. I love that all the tribes in Arizona have been given the oppurtunity to share a piece of their culture yet I hate that the museum focuses on two tribes.

To my yelpers: Please realize that each tribe has it's own ways and unique culture. Open your heart and mind and take in the colorful culture I grew up in!

I could tell you all the reasons why you shouldn't go here. But what good of a reviewer would I be if I told the Yelp community to stay away because this place is far too amazing and you're not good enough to take part in it. Every food lover who can appreciate the beauty in a piece of raw fish should have the chance to experience what Kabuto has brought to Las Vegas. But good luck trying, there are only 18 seats in the entire restaurant and once word gets out, it ain't gonna be easy to get in.

Kabuto is part of the Mon Restaurant Family (Monta, Goyemon, Sushi Mon) and another development from restaurant stylist Martin Koleff. Martin is a pioneer for authentic Japanese eateries in Las Vegas. And at the sushi bar, I was rubbing elbows with those who were more than familiar with Martin's talents. He even popped in for a brief hello during my meal. 

I was told the Omakase Course ($80) will not be available until after the grand opening. I went with the Nigiri Course ($48) but you can order a la carte if you wish. I was served a pineapple appertif sake, a small cucumber salad with sea snail, and 10 pieces of the best fish I've ever had. You can state your preferences, but I had the chef choose for me. He was actually quite vocal and very friendly! He was conversational and took the time to explain the origin of each fish. The giant clam and bull eye were a couple of my favorites. And the uni with ikura were to die for. After your 10 pieces are served, you have the option of ordering more nigiri or moving on to your handroll. I ordered an additional saba then finished my meal. If you love mackerel. Order it here. I've now found the best saba in Las Vegas.

Dessert is not taken lightly here either.  In a couple of months, a Japanese pastry shop is to join this family of restaurants right next door. You have a few dessert options with the nigiri course--mochi, ice cream, or the strawberry layered crepe I ordered. Before I started eating, the chef busted out his iPhone and showed me a picture of a bunch of rocks. Confused, he explained to me the pastry chef's vision. She created the pink and white layers to resemble the layers of rock and sandstone at Red Rock. It was touching, and very delicious.

To be quite honest, I've never been to Japan. My understanding of Japanese tradition is a smattering of information from the internet and my Japanese-immigrant friends. But even I can tell that authenticity and quality are of the utmost importance here. From the food to the decor, Kabuto lives and breathes culture. Its unlike any sushi "joint" you've ever visited in town. I won't discourage you from visiting this magnificent addition to the Las Vegas community. But if you walk in expecting a baked roll with cream cheese, please, turn around and leave those 18 seats for the rest of us.

I'm a fan of Papa Murphy's. Some people are weird about buying pizza and sides that they have to bake at home, but that's just some people being weird. There is usually some type of deal going on and they send coupons in the mail, so with any type of deal it is really worth it considering what a frozen pizza costs and tastes like. You can call your order ahead or stop in and watch them make it fresh. You can choose lighter or extra sauce, cheese and toppings to customize the pizza to your liking. The employees inside this Papa Murphy's are friendly and helpful with going over specials, but when I went on grand opening day, the people there from Sunny 106.5 were very rude and didn't help represent Papa Murphy's well. I was actually relieved to find out it was the radio station being so rude and not the actual Papa Murphy's employees because it would have detoured me from going back. I did score a free pizza (the very last one, nice!) because they were giving out 100 free pizzas to customers that day. 

They have pizzas of all shapes and sizes. They have the mini-murph pizza kit to take home so your kids can put together a pizza for themselves and then see their creation after it bakes. The pizzas also come in signature, pan, delite and stuffed crusts. Most of the pizzas bake at 425 and only take around 10 minutes aside from the stuffed pizza which takes around 25 minutes. The pan pizza is definitely good, but beware when cooking the pan pizza and keep your eye on it because there is butter or something at the bottom of that one and it can burn easy if you let it go too long and when you take the pan pizza out of the oven it's really hot, so let it stand for 5 minutes before slicing. The cheesy bread comes in regular and thicker sizes, both being equally delicious. With a coupon I usually pay about $6 or $7 for a pizza and adding 2 sides it's $6, not including the thicker cheesy bread. One thing I tried on my last visit that I hadn't before is the s'mores dessert pizza. Wow that thing was good! I preferred the s'mores pizza much more than the chocolate chip cookie dough they offer and it is a great price as one of the 2 sides you can pick. My hubby likes the cookie dough here, but I personally do not. If you are signed up for the e-club they usually send you a coupon for free cookie dough on your birthday. They also have pumpkin shaped pizzas at Halloween time and heart shaped pizzas for Valentine's Day, usually at a special price that I like to pick up. All in all this is a decent take-n-bake pizza spot.

Haven't been back in over 5 years and the menu is pretty much the same.  The Travelzoo deal they currently offer (pay $80 for $149 worth of food/alcohol) made a revisit a total no brainer.  The restaurant's appearance even looks about the same.  There's lots of red dcor and the bigger rooms were curtained off since there were less than 10 tables being used.  

There's good value to be had at Envy.  Most appetizers were less than $15 and all the entrees include mashed potatoes and sauted brussel sprouts with bacon.  But when armed with the deal I had, it was all about the $55 "Grand Seafood Plateau".  Lobster, prawns, oysters, mussels, clams, king crab legs....is it possible to get high off of seafood?  I think I did!  Everything was super fresh.  The prawns were enormous, lobster was tender, and I really liked the added garlic to the clams.  This would cost at least 30% more on the strip.  

All the sides we had were excellent.  There was a plethora of lobster in their version of this mac and cheese staple.  This was a highlight of dinner and a ridiculous steal for only $7.  We also had the wild mushroom medley and grilled asparagus.  Our friendly server, Nicki, must have seen several takeout boxes in our future.  

I was least impressed with the steak.  The 12oz bone in filet was 3 stars at best.  Even though $44 was a reasonable price for this type of cut, there are too many great steaks options in LV to say this was any more than passable.  I might not even order steak on my next visit.  

The staff raved about the "Envy Signature Sea Bass" as many Yelpers have so I might give that a shot.  Their "Grilled Pesto Prawns" and "Vegetarian Oven Roasted Stuffed Tomato" also caught my eye.  Entrees like these would be totally ignored at any other steak restaurant, yet Envy might only really be a "steakhouse" in name.  The steaks only take up small bit of their menu while so much of it is non-beef.       

They would be a clear nominee if there were ever a "Best of LV" category for "Steakhouse for people that don't like steak".  3.79394278797982938641112493 stars.  Round up!

If I were on my deathbed, I would request to be wheeled over to eat at Bacio because it would feel like a LIFETIME!!!

I dined here because of a $150 food credit.  With so many quality restaurants in Las Vegas, the ones at The Tropicana aren't on the top of my list.  They're not even on the list.

But color me surprised when I saw their 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings for only $39.  Hey!  That made "restaurant week" look expensive.  It's a shame we didn't even get to the third course after 2+ hours.  I felt even worse for the couple from Italy at the next table playing the same waiting game.  Why in God's name would actual Italians eat here?!?!  

Their saving grace was that the food I did try was actually decent.  The "Risotto Capesante" with scallops, asparagus and prosciutto paired with a crispy white wine was surprisingly good.  I would've been happy with this dish as all four courses.  The "White Peach" salad I received over an hour later was also good but the wait made it taste a little less good.  My dinner companions ordered a la carte and got the veal parmigiana (huge and juicy) and shrimp risotto 90 minutes after ordering.  If they actually got this whole "serving food in a timely manner" down, Bacio wouldn't be a half bad place.  

What the heck was going on in the kitchen??  My guess was the chef suffered from narcolepsy.  We had less than 35 minutes to make a 10pm show at Caesars Palace.  I spoke with the manager to express my displeasure and he took the 2 course dinners off the bill.  The server was super nice, apologetic and took care of a round of drinks too.  At least they made an effort to make it right.  They then boxed up our last two courses of lobster gnocchi (rubbery) and apple granola cheesecake.  The dessert then melted in my car and went straight into the garbage.

I've been by several times and loved everything I had each time. The employees are very courteous and make you feel like family when you are there. I like how affordable the menu is for the quality of food that you get. For $7.99 I got a "Smoked Brisket Sandwich" and for a few bucks more I made it a combo which included a side and a drink. I also added an additional side of "Cheezy Mac & Cheese" to my order. The brisket is smoked for 18 hours and is the best brisket I have had in town. The meat has such great flavor! When it comes to flavor the beans have it and like the brisket, the beans here are the best I've had in town. The macaroni and cheese was very good too. I'm not the type to eat meat off of the bone, but I did try a rib and I enjoyed every bite! So tender and flavorful! For dessert I had "Banana Pudding" priced at $3.99 and it was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. 

Inside is clean and smells like heaven. So does the parking lot where you can on most days see the man himself outside smoking up some of the tasty meats they offer here. If you want to eat at home they offer a variety of party packs. They will even come to your home and bring their own grills and smokers to cater your event. Call them to find out about the packages they have and pricing. I am going to definitely keep the catering in mind for the future!

Middle Eastern food on the strip!  SLS players club offered $30 off of $60 during my birthday month so that made it a clear choice on a recent Monday night.  It was packed at 8:30pm with quite a few people waiting outside.  I'd suggest making a reservation.  Being the middle ground between casual eateries at the resort (Umami) and high end (Bazaar Meat) makes it easy to see why Cleo is so popular.

The menu offered a lot to ponder over, but my mind was already set on one thing....falafel!  It's not easy to find a good version of those deep fried balls of chickpea/fava bean heaven around these parts, but the ones they're serving up here are falawesome.  The light crunch of the exterior went into delicious, warm legume center that was well spiced.  My only regret was not ordering the side of hummus since the amount that arrived with the plate wasn't even enough for three balls let alone seven.  

A minor complaint was that while six of the balls were dark green on the inside, one was very pale green.  It didn't taste much different...still... can you imagine if Robert DeNiro's character from the film "Casino" saw this?  He would have ripped the chef a new one and then made sure he personally saw to every falafel that came out of the kitchen!  

"Kibbeh Nayyeh": chopped raw lamb accompanied with mint, bulgar and lebaneh, was my wife's favorite dish.  It was unlike any other tartare I'd ever had.  The creaminess of the lebaneh (Lebanese yogurt cheese) blended so well with the meat and the toasted parmesan crackers to spread it on.

I found the shawarma portion to be very small for $8 and would definitely pay more for a full lamb entre or just get kebabs instead.  The moussaka was below average and we didn't even bother finishing it before ordering the impressively rich and decadent sticky toffee dessert.  

There are plenty of other menu items worth checking out on a repeat visit like grilled octopus, flatbreads, and multiple mezzes.  I don't plan on being a stranger.

I had three thoughts running through my head as my wife and I were walking out.

1. Outfuckingstanding!!
2. I am having this, this and this next time.
3. We better come back soon because popularity is inevitable and I am going to dread when I'll have to wait 30+ minutes for a table.  I'll do it though.  

Eating at the bar was great since we were able to chat with Woosuk aka Ryan aka the owner throughout our meal.  He handles everything with Moko except for the cooking.  That's left to Chef Hong who is a goooooodddddaaaamn culinary wizard!!  That guy is a total one man show coming in at 10am daily to prep all their amazing stuff for dinner when doors open at 5pm.    

Just discussing the effort and detail Hong goes into preparing plates like the delectable beef short rib (butchering the beef himself, select bones to cook with to enhance the flavor, 3+ hours of cooking etc) was inspiring.  A well presented dish, the beefy fattiness of the short rib accompanied by crispy garlic, gratin and amazing sauce was heavenly.    Christina Perri's "A Thousand Years" was playing while I savored it all and it seemed very fitting.  

It's not often that an Asian restaurant includes a spoon for their table setting but Ryan is smart enough to know the sauce for not only the short rib but others like their "Black Bean Noodle" will/need/must be scooped up out of the bowl.  It sure looks a lot more elegant than sticking my face into it.  Genius!   

They offer Berkshire pork belly cooked for either 10 or 30(!!!) hours.  Even though the 10 hour belly is tenderer, how could I pass up 20 more hours of cooking for $1 more?  It was like nothing I'd ever had before.  The soybean paste marinade with the kimchi crepe and their homemade black raspberry marinated salt (who does that???) was exceptional. 

The grilled then chilled eggplant salad with micro greens and tomato was refreshing and flavorful.  We also got an order of the fried soy chicken wings which was like modern soul food with the unique breading and honey glaze.  There was absolutely nothing left but bones.  

I entered Moko expecting a decent meal and left having an excellent one.  There's nothing quite like this in Vegas at the moment.  Go go go!!

Exhilarating pre fixe menu that showcases the chef's masterful culinary skills!

Located in the beautiful themed garden of the Bellagio, the restaurant's sleek blond wood interior was both intimate and inviting.  Set against soft lighting, the dining space was conducive to a festive and celebratory evening with good friends and at first glance of the tasting menu, i was looking forward to the exciting evening ahead. 

The Breads: Warm sourdough & honey wheat rolls came out nice & hot with a side of lightly salted soft butter. The sourdough was my personal favorite with its nice buttery crust and warm chewy center.

Our party of four didn't need much coaxing as we almost instantly decided on the all inclusive chef's tasting menu with wine pairings, which included the famous lobster pot pie!  

Tuna Tartare - Fresh plump ruby red tuna prepared table side with bright vibrant colors that was definitely a sight to see!  The ancho chili and fresh mint pumped up the volume by adding a tangy zing to this remarkable dish and the pine nuts added a pleasant rustic contrast of texture and rounded out the flavor profiles nicely!

Caviar Parfait - Magnificent! Served atop airy light creme fraiche and a crisp potato cake, each bite was magical! The bubbly paired perfectly with this exquisitely enjoyable dish!

Lobster Pot Pie - Outstanding! I was anxiously anticipating this dish and i am happy to admit that it did not disappoint! As soon as the server carved away the warm golden crust, the sweet smell of buttery lobster wafted into the air and i was mesmerized! As i glanced down into my ramekin, i could see chunks of juicy lobster bathed in brandied lobster cream and it made my mouth instantly water!  I simply love pot pie and lobster has always been on my guilty pleasure list, so the combination for me was a match made in foodie heaven! 

American Kobe Rib Eye - Perfection! The kobe beef was exceptionally moist, tender and buttery! Oh, and yes, it melted in my mouth! Hot dayam, what i'd give to sink my teeth into this luscious piece of premium meat again! Let's not forget about the sides! The butter poached porcini was rich and flavorful while the creamed corn was decadence in every bite!

The tasting menu ended with several small dessert items that showcased the chef's whimsical approach to sweets including a magnificent root beer float, a cookie served with hot mulled apple cider, chocolate bon bons, chocolate chip cookies and a glazed chocolate brownie with cocoa nib ice cream & spiced pecans. 

In a few words, it was literally death by chocolate!!!....and oh what a way to die!

The wine pairings were 100% spot on compliments to our meals. With that said, our server was nothing short of professional, helpful, and friendly.  It was great having friendly conversation with everyone but still enjoy the formalities of fine dining. 

What more could a birthday boy ask for?

So, my only question for La Grande Orange Pizzeria is...can I please live here?  Seriously, this place is GREAT!  There really is no formal division between the pizzeria and grocery parts of the store, so I'm going to talk about both.  Grocery-wise, the place carries a broad mix of classic candies, wines, cookbooks, tchotchkes that rotate seasonally (I've picked up some great holiday items here in years past), and grocery staples; they also have a cafe that serves up oatmeal, eggs (friends rave about the Commuter Sandwich), salads, sandwiches, and sushi rolls.  Word to the wise - bring some extra napkins because their bakery will make you drool!  Order up front at the counter, pick a seat, and then keep your ears perked for when they call your name.  Friendly staff, cool ambience - I always find myself Shazam-ing the music here!  ;)         

As far as the pizza is concerned, the crust is insane!  It almost reminds me of really good sourdough bread, toasted and crispy, not too thin and not too thick.  All the ingredients are fresh and the pizza permutations creative.  They serve up your pie on a slab of wood - nice presentation!  Sadly, I am a creature of habit - once I find something that's to my liking, I latch on and order it every time I return for the rest of my life :/ At this particular establishment, these personal faves would be the Rocket Man Pizza (spicy red fresno chilies, broccolini, roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes) and the Classic Chocolate Pudding - wow, just wow!  I make my poor husband drive all the way across town to come here - he always grumbles but in the end, admits that the place IS pretty delicious.  

The only negative - and it definitely a BIG negative - is the parking situation.  La Grande Orange has the tinsiest micro parking lot known to man.  On a good day if the parking lot gods are smiling down on you, you just might find an open 20 minute parking spot (I haven't been impressed that they actually enforce the time restrictions).  But, if you go on their website under the 'Secret Parking' link (shhhh!), you will find a diagram depicting other parking options that are slightly farther away.

So yeah, come check out La Grande Orange for some great pizza, brunch, baked goods, groceries...the list goes on.  One of my favorite places in Phoenix!

It is ALL about the Aromatherapy Scrub & Massage at Imperial Health Spa. But brace yourself, bitches. There's no gentle, relaxing touch involved so if that's your thing, don't even bother reading any more of my review. The hearts and rainbows and jumping unicorns and rose petals are just not the type of things that transpire over at the Korean Spa. So if you're a bad ass like me and you're from the school that whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, do feel free to read on... 

They will scrub you within an inch of your life and elbow the shit out of knots in your back but it's sooo worth it! No pain no gain baby! Brunhilda from Ryan and Sean's Not So Excellent Adventure has nothing on the chicks that work here! If you don't get that reference, don't feel bad. It's just some obscure, cheesy movie that I happen to have acted in so I wouldn't expect you to have any idea what I'm talking about. And if you do get it... I'm impressed! Extra cool points in my book for you!

Come earlier than your appointment time. Like half an hour early minimum. They want you to be human soup with the rest of the nudists that enjoy the facilities here pre-scrub/massage. Oh and jump into that steam room for a few too if you can handle it. I can't take it too long though. I get wayyy too hot! *insert cute boys sending me compliments like "Yeah, that's right, you ARE way too hot!" here*

My suggestion is to come here before an airbrush tanning session. Get all that dead skin off your body and then head over to see Terry over at Bronzed. But actually the ideal thing is to do this the day or two before because they put a bunch of hardcore moisturizer/oil on you which is not good to have on your skin before an airbrush tanning session because it will make it so the tanner doesn't stick and defeat the whole purpose of your doing the scrub in the first place.

They do just about everything that can be done to pamper you here during this treatment. And there are two different options. One's $125 and the other is $150. Only difference between the two is that one is longer than the other. The Aromatherapy Scrub and Massage appointment goes as follows:

Your scrubber/massage lady comes and finds you in the steam room or jacuzzi. You go back with her and get completely nude. She scrubs the hell out of you as you contemplate your escape route and/or start thinking of a way you can start climbing the ceiling. She shows you all the nasty skin she has taken off of you and you're like, "Wow! I guess I definitely needed this! I swear I don't live in a cardboard box under a freeway overpass!" Then she washes you with this pineapple smelling soap and one of those poof things. This is one of my favorite parts of the treatment because the scent is very intense and smells amazing! After that they wash your hair for you and condition it while giving you a bit of a head massage. Then they seat you up and give you some soap for your face and have you go get in the shower while they clean up all your dead skin off the table so everything is nice and clean for the massage portion that is coming up next. After your shower, they hand you a towel and have you lay down on the table face down. Then they dry you off some more and begin the massage. After that they flip you over and massage a little more, then put a mask on your face. While the mask is drying, they massage your neck and shoulders. Then they peel the mask off and that's the end of your aromatherapy scrub and massage treatment. 

All in all it is a great experience that I recommend and partake in often. So if you see me running around naked 'round these parts, don't be surprised. And sorry dudes... it's not co-ed in the naked area although the men do have their own birthday suit section at this spa. No clue what goes on back there so you're on your own there, buddy. To all the ladies out there... Maybe say hi or something if you see me... Or not. Cuz that like might be awkward since we're like naked and stuff. I dunno... I'm pretty easygoing so if you don't mind, I won't. Your call either way, fellow yelpers. 

All I know is this... You will leave here glowing and looking fantastic, feeling like a new woman! This place is the bomb diggity and the sheer number of checkins I have listed above should speak volumes about how much I love this place!

An incredible steakhouse.   Outstanding food.  Solid wine list.  Excellent service.  Stellar value.

(Sorry this review is long, there is a lot to share).

It's in Luxor.  Stop laughing.  Once you get past the lobby (hey, you can't hide the fact you're in a giant pyramid), renovations have made the casino as contemporary as any.  

Five years and 120+ visits;  Tender continues to impress.  Innovation keeps the menu exciting.  Rapidly changing seasonal specials showoff the chef's commitment to freshness.  

For summer, the heirloom tomato salad with over a dozen varieties of fresh, vine ripened tomatoes dressed in olive oil and sea salt with micro basil and slices of uber fresh, milky mozzarella just incredible.  A full blown tomato party in your mouth.  The salad is large enough for two.

For bison month, a charred bison carpaccio topped with a spicy aioli, arugula salad with roasted peppers and sweet corn finished with a touch of sea salt.  Incredible!

Other killer starters, the charcuterie of game and deli meats (bresaola, finochietta, wild boar sausage, pork coppa, lamb prosciutto and antelope pastrami) with cornisons, assortment of olives and mustard, an excellent take on the classic.  The chilled salmon tasting, a true standout; hot apple wood smoked salmon topped with black truffle "caviar" on a bed of pesto, edamame, and sea asparagus.  Wow!  An explosion of flavors, oily salmon, earthy truffle, herbaceous basil, the back taste of the pine nuts, the crunch and oceanic flavor of the sea asparagus.  Perfect.

Outstanding steaks at all quality and price ranges.  The Bison ribeye is very hard to pass.  Deep meaty flavor, low fat.  JAPANESE KOBE A5 WAGYU.  The real deal.  $95 / 8oz.  I doubted it, I saw it, I tried it.  Yes, yes, yes.  Extremely well trimmed.  Request it cooked below rare.  It's an ethereal experience, seared goodness on the outside, chilled, tender with melting fat on the inside.

Something different?  Wild game platter remains excellent.  Berkshire kurabuta pork chop (order this medium) near perfect heritage pork flavor.  Sweet, tender, and porky!  Finally the bison osso buco; tender perfectly braised, deeply flavored bison on a bed of enriched mashed potato and tangy bbq onions.  Incredible balance.  The marrow is a special treat.

Tip:  check out the sides.  Roasted bone marrow glazed with a veal demi an insane value at $5, Hudson foie for $10.  Add it to any steak or have it alone with some bread as a starter.

Sure, missteps do happen but are always corrected with no fuss.

For the absolute best service on a casual night out, eat at the bar.  Friendly, very knowledgeable bar staff who aim to please.  The music in the lounge a little loud, but it keeps the energy up.

Great wine program with the lowest markup on the Strip.  Huge by the glass pours.  Wines by the bottle near retail.  Check out the Captains' List for clearance wines below retail.

Snub the Luxor all you want, you will be missing a great restaurant.

Forgive the lateness of this review. Usually when a new ramen-ya opens up in LV, I line up outside the door on opening day. Problem is that I've recently entered a PsyD program that has completely consumed my life. I'm lucky to sleep 2-4 hours a night before having to go to work and then school. 

I actually didn't have time to come here today, but one of the students in my learning group really wanted to try this place out and he even offered to pay for it. I couldn't say no to a free lunch. 

So, we have a lot of odd ball ramen-yas here in Las Vegas. Typically, in other cities in America, the most common variations of ramen are: Sapporo, Tokyo, and Hakata. But, here in LV we have a rare Kurume ramen-ya and an Osaka ramen-ya which dominate our ramen scene. I've lived in the Japanese districts of Los Angeles county and have never seen a Kurume or Osaka variation. But, even though Las Vegas has so many rare variations of ramen, we have never had a Tokyo ramen-ya.  And back in Los Angeles we had 100s of Hakata ramen-yas but only one lonely Tokyo ramen-ya. And that LA Tokyo ramen-ya just happened to be......KORAKU. So, you can see why I don't know what a good Tokyo ramen is supposed to taste like. But, after reading Hooto's review, I knew it had to be good. If a man who is from Tokyo is vouching that a restaurant has a good Shoyu ramen, then it erases all my doubts. 

The prices here are very low compared to the KORAKUs in California. My bowl of Shoyu ramen was only $6.95, compared to the $11 I paid 5 years ago when I last went to a KORAKU in California. 

The first thing Japanese people do when they enter a new ramen-ya is ask "what regional variation of ramen is served here?". When I asked this at the California location, the server said " I is... don't know". When I asked here, the server immediately answered "Tokyo". I was really happy that the servers had a lot of ramen knowledge. BTW, I miss the days when Japanese restaurant owners used to force their non-asian workers to learn to speak Japanese.

KORAKU gives a free slice of Naruto-maki with each bowl of ramen! Sora, Fukumimi, and Monta don't do that. 

My Shoyu broth was perfect. My Dad grew up in Hawaii, and he used to tell me that Shoyu broth is best when fish bones are used instead of traditional chicken. KORAKU's  broth did have a hint of fish, but it wasn't very noticeable. Anyway, I thought it was very good and much better than Monta's Shoyu. 

I loved the thin yet slightly curly noodles. Shoyu is always supposed to have thinner curly noodles, but no other place here in LV does that. Sora has curly Sapporo noodles but they are way too thick for Shoyu.  

I liked the ramen so much that I called my Dad in California and told him that I found the best Tokyo Shoyu Ramen-ya in America. My Dad is one of those guys who insists that ramen on the mainland can't compare to ramen in Hawaii so he told me to shut up.

A friend told me that KORAKU had Tan Tan Men. When I showed up, it turned out it was Tanmen. I can't count how many times in the last 10 years this has happened to me. 

It sucks how this place had to open up during the same week as Monta part 2(which many of us Sansei/Yonsei have nicknamed "Monta Strikes Back"). I noticed that Monta 2 is always extremely busy while KORAKU usually only has 2-3 people in it. For some odd reason which I will never understand, people here in LV have this idea that Monta is "the best" and that all ramen should be compared to their Tonkotsu. This is far from the truth. I've only met a handful of Japanese people who think Monta is "good ramen". Most Japanese people I know think Monta is one of your typical Las Vegas "tourist traps" and cannot compare to Katsu & Daisuke's Fukumimi or Yoshi's Ramen Sora. 

I encourage all Japanese-American residents of Las Vegas to support KORAKU. I know that these days there are only like 5 of us left in this whole city...but just do it anyway...

Fuck this place.

Yes, I said it and even after 6 years, I will still say it.

So the girls and I are on a tear it up Vegas weekend. All very cute and sessy gals for the record and all gals who appreciate the less than finer things in life like fake boobied strippers, over-priced drinks and titty bars. 

So we cab it over to the Crazy Horse Too after hearing that THIS was THE place to go. We roll up and instantly get static at the door. You can't come in without a date. Um, okay, well we are a bunch of girls with lots of money to spend? NO! But...? NO!

So we walk a few feet away and regroup while trying to keep the temper of one Drunky MaGoo down to a manageable level since the a-hole of a door guy was especially rude to this one girl in our group. I suggest grabbing a few guys and rollin in with them. I mean who cares, we can ditch them at the door but at least it gets us in. So we latch onto said guys and walk up.

Door guy says, NO!

I say, "You said dates, these are our dates. We are in love, let us in." (Mind you I'm drunk and his anger is amusing me at this point)

Door guy says, "fine you can come in, but that one stays out!" (pointing to my friend)

I say, "Come on, don't be THAT guy, did mama raise you to be THAT guy? She just really wants to see some boobs, surely you can relate."

Apparently he couldn't, but I also think he was suffering from mama abandonment issues and clearly wasn't loved enough as a child, but I digress...

He then decides that none of us should be allowed to come in. Fine, I'd rather not go if my friend is going to not be let in, so just give us our money back and we will go spend it elsewhere, right?

Apparently this is when the poor chap lost all sense of hearing as i became invisible and mute in his eyes.

"Excuse me, I said we'll go. Can you please just give us our money back?"

"Hello?"

"Umm"

"Yo!"

Retard Roy then starts smirking and it is quite clear that the four of us who "got in" will not be getting our money back, even though we technically never even entered the club. 

I then followed up with calls to the establishment the next day that were (to no surprise) never returned. Maybe they are in cahoots with Prime Time Shuttle as their customer service seems to be pretty dead on.

So if you are a girl don't go here. If you are a guy, have at it, but why waste your money on a place that won't let cute girls in who might actually go home with you for free. Just sayin.

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Warning! Going to Sam Fox Restaurants for Happy Hour after a movie can be habit forming. 

We have heard many good things about this Italian farmhouse concept, but we were little hesitant given that we found the lunch at North in Kierland just okay.  Our caution however, was unwarranted.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
We arrived around four-thirty and the parking lot was mostly empty. Were they open we thought? But as we approached the front door, it was opened by a hostess and we were invited in. Nice.  

We said we had come for the Happy Hour and were escorted not to the bar, but to some tables along the back wall. We were given menus, both Dinner and HH and heard a brief explanation of the fish special. Very cozy and very nice. I have taken a few photos of the inside of the restaurant.  The mood is upscale and dare I say 'hip".

MENU:
Like other Fox places, the HH menu is more of a starting point of samplers. For instances, if you like HH serving of freshly made meatballs and spaghetti, then maybe you'll like the lager dinner serving.

The HH menu has about a dozen items, mostly in the $5.00 - $8.00 range.  They have Caesar Salad, Arancini, Pizza of the Day $8, Chef's Board of meats and cheese $10, Zucca chips $3.  Two holdovers from other restaurants are the Castelvetrano Olives $3 and Spiced Nuts $2. These two look similar to the Olive & Ivy's offering. http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-and-ivy-scottsdale#hrid:XB-E39WNviGs1MkkQ4XIxw

As you would expect, they also have all beers and well drinks priced at $4.00 to $5.00.  But what we found special, are all their wines marked at 50% off.  They will also re-cork it for you to go.

Here are links to the menus:

http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/North_40th_Dinner_Menu2.pdf

SERVICE:
We found the service to be very professional.  Yes, the water glasses were refilled on a timely basis, but also the wait staff comes by and chats with you about your food and answers any questions you have very knowledgeably.  We actually got into a very detailed discussion on Washington State wines and Oregon Pinots with our server Vail.

FOOD:
We started off by ordering a Washington State Chardonnay, but found they didn't have any chilled.  We then opted instead for the Snoqualmie Riesling, which was somewhat sweet, with a hint of cherries.

We tried the HH Caesar Salad for $5.00 and the HH Spaghetti, also for $5.00. The salad came with some of the most delicious croutons that had a smokey taste we have ever had.  A definite must.  The spaghetti was equally interesting and flavorful.  The meatballs must be cooked in a marinara, and has a complexed layering taste which was different than the pasta sauce, which has a hint of fennel. Wow.

Next we ordered the Margherita Pizza ($11.00) off the Dinner menu, see photos. It was very good but we found the cheese slipped off when you bit into a wedge. 

For dessert, we each ordered the Gelato scoop for $3.00 and the Tiramisu for $6.00, both off the dinner menu.  I've taken pictures of the Titamisu.  It came in a glass ramekin with an amazing amount of delicious mascarpone cheese and flavorful Kahlua.

PRICES:
Our petite Happy Hour dinner of six items, ran us $41.50 before taxes and gratuities.  It also included the bottle ($23.00, 50% off) of Riesling, which our wonderful server Vail re-corked for us. As we left, the parking lot was full with a dozen cars waiting to be parked.

Enjoy!

I've been coming here for a long time since before when it was Xtreme Sushi and through the new ownership change. I must say that I love it the most now that the new owner(s) has/have taken over. The food is a lot more consistent. They've added some new artwork and chairs which made the atmosphere a whole lot nicer and tied everything together more with the decor. Plus they got rid of the awful grimy menus that had seen better days and have added new rolls, my favorite being the Burn Your A** roll. The Yoshi roll from the past is still on the menu so it looks like they've kept some of the more popular rolls. I'm pretty sure that they will accommodate orders from the old menu in case there's something you miss from before. It's a lot of the same people that work here so that's half the battle right there.

The employees are all great and personable. It's very much like the tv show Cheers type atmosphere. Once they get to know you, they will roll out the red carpet, including remembering your name and what you order to make you feel at home. I'm just waiting on my little name plaque at the sushi bar where I always sit. ;)

It's the little things like this to consider when there are so many other options for AYCE sushi in Las Vegas. They really care and appreciate your business here. Therefore, I vote in favor of trying out this local gem.

PS: Why in the hell did someone upload a photo of their dog in their review of this place? I love dogs like the next person but seriously? WTF!?

Heard about the 16 oz Ribeye for 12.99 here so of course I had to investigate. It's a tough job but hay, somebody has to do it!

As you come in, the bar is the first thing you run into. That's great if you want to eat and drink while inhaling second hand smoke. Just go around to your left and into the actual dining room where there is about 6 booths and 3 tables.

If you are lucky, you just might get Holly as your server. She is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and she provides great service. The vibe I got from her was all positive. It seemed to me like she actually enjoyed her job. Needless to say, I knew I was going to give her a generous tip when it was all said and done.

As promised, I ordered the 12.99 1 pound Ribeye which comes with your choice of Fries or Onion Rings (I got the Onion Rings and man, they were so good!). I also added a side salad which is only a dollar more with any meal. I ordered the Ribeye medium rare topped off with my request of sauted onions and mushrooms. I assume they have been offering this Ribeye deal for a while now because my steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it. It was so juicy and  tender that my wife was kicking herself for not ordering it. Refer to my pic of the inner portion of my exquisite piece of meat. To me, that's how all steak should be cooked and look like when its cut apart.

My wifey ordered the Pretzel appetizer (which is funny because it could be a meal in itself cuz its so huge!) Comes with 3 sauces. Hot mustard, Jalapeno Cream Cheese, and Nacho Cheese infused with Beer! Now that last sauce was kind of weird but definitely a change of pace if you have never had it.

Now probably the only obvious thing that stood out as a negative for me was that even though we were in the supposed "Non Smoking" dining section, you can still smell the smoke coming in from the bar. At the time of our dining experience, I smelled only a little bit of smoke and when we got home, some of the smell was on our clothing. I can only imagine that on really busy nights, the smoke factor would be even worse and that your clothes will smell like an ashtray full of cigarette butts later on.

So if you are ever craving steak, especially Ribeye, then Jacksons Bar and Grill is the place for you! Doesn't matter if it's 11 pm at night or 9 am breakfast time, you can get it at any time because these guys are 24/7!

We contacted Maleisa Hughes last year regarding watching our three dogs (golden retriever, afghan hound and a chihuahua.  The prices were reasonable considering what other sites cost, as they were only charging $20 per dog and they were willing to give a discount for the third dog, so the price was set at $50 per day.  We scheduled a visit to their home and brought our 2 big dogs to introduce them to the owners.  We saw that there was an acre which looked fun for the dogs. They invited us into their home and said the dogs would be treated like members of the family if boarded with them and that all play time outside would be supervised.  Maleisa said they had been boarding dogs for years and were experienced and advised we book early for any dates we wanted as they limited the number of dogs boarded to six dogs.  We felt that was reasonable on a property of that size.  Our dogs were all very well socialized with people and other dogs as we routinely went to dog parks so we felt this would be a great place to bring them. We booked a weekend last fall just to test the place out and see how it went.  We checked in often, via text and and we were told the dogs were doing great and having lots of fun.  The day we picked them up they were out in the yard with the owners running around with a few other dogs and seemed content.    My Afghan hound went to the corner of the yard when he saw me and hid behind some ducks in an open pen, I assumed he didn't want to go home as he had enjoyed his stay.   We went ahead and booked the Christmas week to bring the dogs again.

Christmas rolled around and one of my adult children announced she would be home and offered to watch the dogs for me.  As we had already booked with Green Acres, I didn't feel right about canceling at the last minute, as I had noticed that the owners had numerous young children and felt it would not be fair to deprive the family of the income we had promised.  I did opt to leave the chihuahua home, as I felt he might not be safe running around with bigger dogs.  We boarded the big dogs for about 9 days.  When I came to pick up the dogs that time, they were let out of a room in the back of the house and the afghan hound ran to me with his tail between his legs and couldn't wait to get out of there.  I noticed that both dogs were filthy and smelled HORRIBLE.  I can't even describe the stench, but it took several baths to finally get rid of the odor.  I found it odd because the acreage is all grass, so I couldn't figure out where that stench would have come from.  

Outside of the smell, the dogs seemed fine until a few weeks later we attempted to go back to the dog park where we had gone many times over the years, and when we entered the park the afghan hound FREAKED out and started aggressively barking at the other dogs that ran up to greet him as if to say, "stay away from me".  I had to grab him and remove him to avoid a dog fight.  We attempted to return to the park a few times thereafter and he behaved the same way each time.  He even freaked out on a walk when he saw another dog across the way.  We spoke to a trainer regarding the behavior and he told us once a dog is in that mind set it is VERY DIFFICULT to break it.  We were very sad and couldn't figure out what could have triggered such a wild swing in temperament.  We finally realized that his behavior HAD to have been impacted by the stay at the boarding facility.  Looking back now, if he was stuffed in a room with 30 other dogs, it would have driven any dog mad, or to fear aggression.

We couldn't prove that anything horrible had happened to our dog at that point, it was just a feeling that something bad had happened there and we decided we probably should not use them again.

We decided to hire my niece and nephew last week to watch our dogs while we were out of town, because of that gut feeling something was wrong over there and came back to the news that 17-21 dogs had died in the Hughes' care, or lack thereof.  All I can think about is, IF I had cancelled our plans during Christmas and left the dogs with my daughter, I WOULD HAVE BOOKED last week with the Green Acres and my dogs would have been among those poor souls who lost their lives.  We were the lucky ones...I may not be able to take my temperamental hound to a park anymore, but at least he is alive.  My heart is breaking for all the families who lost their sweet puppies.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 52/100

Stayed in this hotel with my bf for the first time a few weeks ago and absolutely LOVED IT!

I had never heard of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay before. Apparently it's the nicer of the two towers at Mandalay Bay, and consists entirely of suite-style hotel rooms. 

My bf had booked our stay about four months in advance through Expedia, and he only paid around $110 per night for a HUGE suite for the two of us! It was amazing and you definitely get a bang for your buck!

Parking is free, as with most if not all of the hotels in Vegas. The parking garage is HUGE and has stairs, escalators, and elevators. There's also valet parking and a taxi drop off/pick up area.

Check-in was quick and easy. Lines weren't long and it took us around 5 minutes.

Decor/ambience is really great in this hotel. It doesn't really have a theme like a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's just modern, classy, and trendy. I really liked it!

Elevators were kinda confusing since depending on what floor you're on, you have a certain set of elevators you have to take. However, the elevators are AWESOME and INCREDIBLY fast! We stayed on the 20th floor and it only took a few seconds to get from our room down to the lobby and back!

Our suite was AMAZING. There was a living room area that had a couch, desk, chairs, coffee table, and a huge television! There was also a guest bathroom located right by the door if you have people over. It's a 1/2 bath so just a sink and toilet, but still really awesome! There's also a mini-bar area, but make sure you don't touch any of the items there because they are monitored with a weight system, and you are automatically charged for anything you pick up. 

The bedroom area of our room was really nice. We had an incredible king sized bed with a HUGE wall unit that had a TV in the middle, and his and hers closets on either side of it. The closets even had lights inside to see your clothes, and robes, slippers, hangers, etc.!

Our main bathroom was HUGE! It came with two sinks, toilet, a big shower, and a ginormous bathtub that could fit like 3 people in it. My college dorm room was honestly smaller than this bathroom...it was crazy!

The Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson show plays at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. We didn't watch it, but we plan on watching it during one of our future visits! 

The MIX Lounge at the top of the hotel is supposed to be da bomb. We didn't end up going up there but we saw a ton of people waiting in line to go up.

The ONLY things I didn't love about THEhotel were:

1) LACK OF WIFI IN ROOMS. I think they only had ethernet but that is useless when you only have your smart phone and iPad with you.

2) NO REFRIGERATOR IN SUITE. The bf tried to create a makeshift refrigerator with our ice bucket. Didn't really work...

3) LOCATION. That it's on the far south end of the strip. Like literally the last hotel. Fortunately we drove to Vegas so we used our car to drive further up the strip, but if you don't have a car I can imagine it being a huge issue. It's quite a long walk from THEhotel towards the middle/north end of the strip.

I would definitely stay at THEhotel again and highly recommend it! 5 stars!

"Bonjour, mon ami.  Lardons, si vous plait"

Located conveniently by the hotel elevators at the Paris Las Vegas hotel, Le Cafe Ile St. Louis offers French American cuisine, specializing in breakfast/brunch.  A cute facade makes diners feel they are in city of lights, with dining inside or "al fresco", which in this case means overlooking the casino floor.  I chose to sit "al fresco" both times I dined here, as it gave ample opportunity to people watch, both those gambling & those walking by, and to enjoy the filtered casino air.  I assumed seating inside would be rather stuffy.

As previously mentioned, I dined at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis on two occasions, for dinner then for breakfast the next day.  Here's the 411-

Dinner - There was very little wait & was quickly led to a table.  While waiting for my order to arrive, crusty bread & butter were placed on our table-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ
By crusty, I mean crusty.  The outer layer of bread was as crusty as my tidy whities after my first wet dream.  Yes, that crusty!  Inside, though, was airy & soft.  The butter was crack to me.  I asked for another helping of it, as I was liberally dousing each piece of bread w/ butter.  I even helped myself to spoonfuls applied directly to mouth, w/o the interference of bread.

Calamari - Fried squid w/ crispy onions, fennel, lemon & a dijon mustard vinaigrette $12-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#kVwRy-qO3v8PJYyLn5u9aw
This was delicious.  Generous portions, fried crisp & light with a captivating vinaigrette.  I asked for more of said vinaigrette because I was bathing each piece of calamari and/or onion with it.  

Burger and foie gras - Angus beef, pate de foie gras, caramelized apples, balsamic gastrique on a brioche bun w/ pomme frites $18-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#MeXfEou-G1FANcmYRGUT5w
Tres bien!  What sold it for me was the foie gras, a food item that was recently banned for sale in California.  It's like meat butter.  I delighted in the medium-rare goodness-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#b40GDQLSlIUeiYa7GWeWQw
The pomme frites (french fries) were, sadly, soggy & limp.  I guess they spent too much time w/ the Paris go-go dancer the previous night ;p She sure knew how to twerk it, so I don't blame the fries for being limp LOL

Creme brulee $8 - 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#I2QqmkDyFQxm4iGwkx9Y_A
Ahhh, the crispy sugar shell forming a roof over the thick creme underneath.  This was magnifique!  I savored each & every bite, delighting in the burnt flavoring of the sugary shell.

Breakfast - There was about a 5 min wait, so it wasn't long before being seated "al fresco".  Complimentary toasted bread of choice was provided.  I chose sourdough & extra of that fantastic butter.  

Corned beef hash w/ two poached eggs $15 -
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#Lbn2VWRXcYHOWnJDlIpQ2A
Hearty, rich, stick to your ribs good!  I relished each & every bite, as the runny egg yolks slithered down the hash, making for a delectable meal.  Quality portions, worth the $15.

Cafe latte $5 - This could French kiss my derriere.  Weak coffee in a small cup.  I thought the Europeans were known for how strong they like their coffee.  This was more like Folgers.  The Gevalia I brew at home is leaps & bounds better than this drivel.

Service was good, as extra butter was brought out & drinks were refilled.  Seating is plentiful throughout, w/ my recommendation of dining "al fresco".

I enjoyed my 2 dining experiences here at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis.  It's Vegas, so the prices can be a little high for what you get, but I mostly enjoyed the food I had the pleasure of eating here.  Plus, the convenience of having the restaurant located right outside the hotel elevators make stopping here a breeze.

Recommend!

Au revoir!

I really enjoy the Sicilian pizza from the Cugino's across town, so when I noticed this location I wanted to check it out. Before walking in, I noticed a sign at the door promoting their current specials. When I saw they offered a 2 slice Sicilian special with drink I knew that would be what I wanted to get. I have been in more than once and the same sign is out front with several different specials on it, but they don't always have them all available. So far each time I have been in (even at dinner time) they don't have any Sicilian ready unless you order a whole pizza. They only have had some regular slices available. When I asked the guy behind the counter about it, he said that it just depends what time you get there and says they sell out quick. If people like it so much why not have more of it ready? Oh well I do agree it's tasty! I ended up getting the 2 slice special with a drink. For just cheese slices it's only $4.99 and with pepperoni it's $5.99 which isn't bad at all. The slices are decent size and like how the crust is thin yet has just the right crispness to it. I have eaten inside, but I have also taken my lunch back to work with me and I like that the pizza is still nice and warm and the crust isn't soggy by the time I drive back and eat it. This is a plus because let's face it, not all take-out tastes the same once you get it home vs. eating it right when you get it. The inside is clean and the employees are friendly. Definitely better than average pizza, so if you are in the area give it try.

I stopped in to pick up some dinner to-go. After walking in, hubby and I were very confused since they have no signs saying to seat yourself or anything pointing you to a place for to-go orders. The most confusing part was no employees in sight and no menu board?!?! There wasn't anybody else eating inside either, so I had to wonder if this place was really open for business or not. After a couple minutes a woman came out and asked asked if were were eating in or taking out, so I told her we wanted to place a order to-go. She handed us menus and we sat and looked it over. After only a minute she came back to take our order, but I told her we we hadn't been here before and needed a little extra time to look over the menu. She then comes back I swear less than a minute later and asked if we were ready. Ugh. I felt rushed which made no sense since there were no other customers. I just went ahead and ordered some things that caught my eye.

Bean and Cheese Pupusas ($1.95) - The price was great, but not the taste. I wish I tasted more beans and cheese inside instead of the pasty corn flavor this one had. 

Al Pastor Taco ($1.95) - I enjoyed the taco and they were generous with the fillings, but it tasted more like chicken and certainly doesn't stand up against some of the other al pastor around town. 

Fried Plantains ($2.50) - Yum! This was the best part! I really enjoyed the nice sweet flavor.

The lady who helped us was friendly, but pushy about getting our order taken. I really feel they need to put a menu board up and some signage showing customers if they should seat themselves etc. Price was on point and the plantains were good, but everything else was a miss for me.

Located inside the newly erected SLS Hotel in Vegas, Jos did not hold back with construction on this massive restaurant.  Once you pass the grand entrance, drama abounds as you're invited into a dimly lit space that's very much like the Bazaar in Los Angeles with interesting chachkes baubles and distinctive chandeliers of various shapes and sizes.   

While our table was being prepared, we opted to sit at the bar and enjoy a few fascinating cocktails crafted by the bartender. 

Moments later, we were escorted to our table where our server Nick introduced himself. 
Nick was warm friendly and offered some thoughtful suggestions from the menu. On that note, I'd have to say my experience was elevated to VIP status because he was quite the accomplished server. He was very attentive and made every effort to check with us throughout the evening and ensured our experience was nothing less than top notch. 

Foie Gras Cotton Candy - A classic at The Bazaar that is not to be missed, especially since it's been banned practically everywhere else!

Bagel & Lox
Plump salmon roe served with soft cream cheese in a light and crispy cone. Briny yet smooth and creamy with a crunchy finish, phenomenal!

Grissini Wagyu Beef Carpaccio - 
Fragrant onion infused breadsticks wrapped with thinly sliced wagyu beef that's so insanely soft & tender, it will virtually melt in your mouth.  Served with a decadently rich and flavorful Parmesan espuma dip, your mouth will be savoring the rich permeating flavors long after you've devoured every morsel of this fantastic dish.

King Crab & Shrimp Cocktail - 
Served chilled on a bed of ice, I quickly noticed generous portions of chunk king crab & plump shrimp bathing in a bright red cocktail sauce. My mouth quickly started to water and once I took a bite, my eyes lit up. Bright acidity from the sauce coupled with the fresh juicy and plump king crab meat & shrimp made for a light and refreshing cocktail that was refreshingly substantial down to the very last bite.

Oysters 
Kushi, Shiboku, Blue Point - 
Fresh, briny, perfectly sized with a plump and juicy mouthfeel and went down the hatch beautifully.

Foie Gras floating island - 
Served in a small tea cup, this flavorful dish was far from dainty. It was actually quite rich and velvety smooth with a spectacular nutty finish. Foie gras lovers will revel in this richly satisfying dish.

Robuchon Potatoes - 
With the signature Robuchon name stamped on these potatoes, I was confident I was in for a treat but words simply can not describe the out of body experience that you'll have when you try these amazing mashed potatoes. Buttery smooth and decadently rich. Simply divine. 

Roasted Corn - 
Don't let the diminutive size fool you, these snappy little guys don't only pack an irresistible crunch but a surprisingly spicy kick, as well! 

Skirt Steak - 
A beautifully cooked steak with a perfectly pink tender and juicy flesh.

Kobe - 
Easily the best cut of steak ive ever had. Buttery, juicy, fatty, tender and infinitely satisfying. You'll literally shed a tear of joy when you enjoy this outstanding cut of premium beef. And trust, this beef is legit! They even prove it with an actual certificate of authenticity that's handed to you at the end of your meal! Now that's rich ;)

We ended our meal with a selection of the restaurant's fine desserts presented in a beautiful red pastry box. 

I'd have to say this was one of my better dining experiences in Vegas and much of it came from the wonderful service and of course, inspiring cuisine!

Happy Eats!

After an evening of nonstop Vegas-style partying, the only words I managed to utter from my dry raspy voice the following morning was...water please!!!

In addition to replenishing my body with much needed liquids, I was feeling mighty peckish, as well!  After much deliberation, our group decided on a calm & relaxing sit down Saturday brunch at Thomas Keller's Bouchon. 

Located on the 10th floor inside the Venetian, the restaurant embodied what I've come to expect from a fine French bistro. The vibe was chic & refined yet relaxed and unfussy.  There were comfortable banquettes throughout the main dining area as well as outdoor seating in the patio area. We were subsequently seated inside. At 12:00pm, the sun was beaming from the patio, so our location filtered the intense light perfectly, which suited me and my solar sensitive eyes just fine. 

Complimentary house made jam was magnificent! The jam is freshly prepared each day and depending on the chef's mood, a different flavor variety is served. Today, he was feeling strawberry, which is my personal favorite! They served us an Epi baguette to share and it was fantastic, as well. Warm, buttery crust with perfectly chewy texture. Coupled with the soft butter and sweet pucker inducing jam, it was a match made in the stars.

The entrees were orchestrated perfectly as we didn't have to wait long at all.

Chicken n waffles - The waffles were made with bacon n chives and sourdough batter. It was airy and crisp with a lightly sweet flavor and a savory finish. It was so good i almost forgot to use the syrup!
The chicken was roasted perfectly and it was insanely moist & tender! The chasseur wine sauce was rich and flavorful with an alluring aroma. Some of my guests enjoyed the savory flavor so much they poured the irresistible sauce over their waffles, too!

Pork belly was fatty and incredibly flavorful and juicy.  Accompanied by the creamy hollandaise sauce, it was absolutely delicious!

Corned beef hash was phenomenal! Well seasoned pieces of corned beef mixed with all the traditional fixins that will impress any die hard corned beef hash purist!  Trust, this was far from canned! 

Short rib was tender, the fontina cheese was fragrant and the whimsically tiny jingle bell peppers added a pleasant little kick to this fantastic dish!

Beignets were served fresh out of the oven but they were quite dense and tasted more like doughnuts IMO Overall, they were very moist and with the added raspberry preserve filling, they added a sweet finish to our savory entrees.

Our service throughout the meal was very consistent with coffees, water, and juices always filled to the brim.

By the end of the meal we were absolutely stuffed!  But I didn't mind at all :D

My friends and I had a wonderful time and it was great feeling totally replenished and revived with good quality food that was masterfully prepared with fantastic service to boot. The strong coffee didn't hurt either!  I'm not quite sure if this particular location was ever awarded a Michelin star but IMO Thomas Keller deserves praise for a dining experience that was unpretentious, comforting and very enjoyable!

When we all left, I was sated, 100% refreshed and ready to take on the world, well at least another round of partying :) 

Hey, it's Vegas for crying out loud.

Happy Eats!

Had the most Mind blowing Experinece here!

This place rocks!  Seriously they have hundreds of gems, fossils, rocks etc etc. I wish they were closer to get to.

So my friend Dawn R. who flew in from Portland for the Yelp Spring Break had been looking for 6 gems for a Feng Shui thing in the living room.  Everything on the internet was just a online store and not a business that you could walk into.  When it comes to gems and minerals you want to hold and see.  Think about a diamond for example.  Wouldn't you rather see it and touch in person before buying!   Well the Yelp Ap came to the rescue again.  

This place is on the outskirts of downtown and easy to get to.  I wasn't sure want to expect since there was less than 10 reviews but WHOA when we walked in it was like DAYUM.  They have A LOT of stuff.  They have the place organized by the minerals, gems and fossils in the front.  When you go to the back you can find even more minerals, gems in all type of sizes and shapes and even a sections of beads.  Another smaller room where they have Buddhist statues.  I was totally impressed with the amount of items this place carries.

I personally was not looking for anything in particular.  I was looking at some pendulum and I tried out a few.  There was one answering me even when I was not holding it so I getting it.   I also purchased a Moldavite http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavite.  Something I had never heard of until that day.  I was curious to know more about it and Miguel was the one who took the time to explain what it was and how people use it.  Being that I had by Reiki 1 & 2 done and he was a Reiki Master and had also done theta healing I knew exactly what he was talking about in terms of energy work.  I could totally feel the warmth from this one gem from holding it in my hand.  I felt like what one may feel when having a hot flash.  It was pretty odd how this little gem was giving off that much energy.  There are only 3-4 mines and it is estimated that it will all be gone in the less than 10 years so I thought I should get one.   So I picked a pendant http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jMrpr92nMEhe4cC4FF00VQ?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#hddvoHue4g2iC-Tv6KuvRA and a chain I like and put it on.  The pendant sat right between my heart and throat chakra and I could immediately feel the warmth in my chest area.   

Now this is when things got interesting.  As we were checking out, Miguel had left to the back room to grab a bag for my pendulum.  When he returned he told me to put out both hand and close my eye.  Hmmm that is a strange request but I obliged.  He then put a good size spirit quartz in both hands and told me to hold on an feel.  I seriously never ever ever felt so much energy and vibration coming from gem before.  It was so intense my hands were shaking.  It shot up through my arms and straight to my chest and was pounding right were the Moldavite pendulum lay.  I was totally speechless and all that came out of my mouth was Oh Shit, Oh my goodness, Oh Damn Oh my god etc etc.   A minute or so into it Miguel proceeds to share with me a message from my spirit guide to not be so hard on myself and to take things slowly and to take my time.  With the massive energy and vibration going through me and what I was hearing I teared up big time.  This was so unexpected and a great surprise.  It was one of the most amazing experience I had in a store!!!  Now this is not to be expected with every person that comes in but I was totally opened to it and was ready for it and so I welcomed it.  Freaking amazing.   I was feeling that energy pretty much all day, it was freaking great!!!! 

Anywho, if your' looking to buy a few pieces for feng shuei or maybe even by a Moldavite and you happen to be visiting sin city you have got to stop by this place.  It's a gem of a place!

Locale ~ Downtown 
Offerings ~ Gems, Minerals, Jewelry, Statues
Extras ~ Ask for Miguel,  He is very knowledgeable and helpful!

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Imagine you had a long day. And you wanted to relax and indulge in something incredibly scrumptious, delectable, and sinfully good.  Well... Think Sow.  Salty Sow.

We were over near the PV Mall and we decided, spur of the moment, to get something nearby. We thought of sushi and a few other places. But then we saw the three golden neon arrows pointing to the front door of the Salty Sow. 

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
The Salty Sow has that nouveau feel to it. The bar is off to the left as you enter, with a large kitchen straight in front of you. You see a lot of wood and interesting lighting (photos). But the feeling is very intimate. Even with other diners nearby, you cannot hear their conversations. The clientele is mixture of millennials and older, with a dozen or so sitting at both the bar and the dinning area. 

MENU:
Like most places in the Valley, the Happy Hour menu is a jumping off point for the  Dinner menu. When you are seated you are given both menus. There seems to be no pressure to order off of one or the other. The focus of the food is all things pork. So if you love bacon, then you have found your Nirvana in this life. LOL

Almost all the items on the Happy Hour menu are $5,00 and you find things like: Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries, Truffled Deviled Eggs, Pork Belly Tacos and Braised Beef Tacos and much, much more

SERVICE:
Everything is relaxed and our server Holly was excellent.  Folks stop by and ask about your meal and dishes are bused quickly

FOOD:
Okay, the best thing we tried was the HH Fried Chicken that came with a honey glaze and a large sweet potato biscuit (photo).  Even here there was bacon on the underside of the chicken.  It was moist, flavorful and delicious!

We also order two tacos which were equally good that came with a fried egg on top (photo).  But you must try the Duck Fat Fries, which were seasoned with herbs and salt.  It also comes with a poached egg yoke on top (photo).  Great stuff.

PRICES:
Everything at Happy Hour is $5.00 and it ends at 6:30 with the ringing of a cow bell.  Ahh, "we need more cow bells!"  LOL  Our bill came to $37.50 before taxes and gratuities, including two items to go and a soft drink ($2.50).

Debbie Downer:
Just before the check, we asked our server if we could order two items to go.  We also asked what the up-charge would be.  To our surprise, she said it would be the same price.

As we were leaving, the Culinary Manager approached us and said: 
"We normally don't allow people to order off the Happy Hour menu to go."  As I stamered to say we had checked first with our server, she said: "I'm going to let it go this time, but don't do it again."

Make sure you come prepared to stand in line here at the Bachannal Buffet. Being one of the more popular buffet's on The Strip, this line can get outright outrageous I heard.  We were lucky this time,  waiting less than 45 minutes, after hearing stories of people waiting 1-2 hours. BTW, you can opt to pay an extra fifteen bucks to enter via the "Preferred" line. Nope, I'll wait. After paying for two, which by-the-way set me back a cool $102 bucks, we were escorted to our seats and invited to start anytime we wished. Ah, my dining companion and I decided we would make a "dry run" through the entire buffet to prepare ourselves for the journey ahead of us. After familiarizing ourselves with the setup, we proceeded to get our food. For me, the first stop was the Asian section. Being savvy enough to discipline oneself to realize that there is one big huge buffet ahead and not to fill up on starch here can be difficult here.  There was a nice layout of sushi and other Oriental delicacies. As I made my way around the buffet, I couldn't help but notice the standard items found in most buffets. People were piling their plates with crab legs, which btw were probably snow crab, really skinny. I think I took maybe two small legs. I made my way to the prime rib, which is kinda how I judge a good buffet. I asked for a medium rare piece, but was a little disappointed in it's being dry. There were other meats, but they looked equally dry also. The oysters are good, though, very fresh. They have a nice display of fish in the display case which made for a great photo op!  The Mexican section was pretty good, but I think the star of this buffet had to be the dessert section. Macarons, cakes, pies, cake pops, even mochi ice cream! A dessert lover's paradise! All in all, I have to give this buffet a three star rating because I felt it was a bit overrated and because the meat section wasn't what I expected. The service was fair, although I noticed towards the end of our meal it got slow and our drinks went un-refilled... Would I go back? Probably not, I did want to try the brunch one day though. I think for the money, there are other better choices in Vegas.

Have you often wondered why so many middle-aged  Japanese people here in Las Vegas always tell you that they go to SUSHI ON RAINBOW for sushi instead of the multi-million dollar bankrolled sushi restaurants like Kabuto or Goyemon? Why do these former or current Japanese nationals prefer to eat at an older sushi bar that doesn't have fancy or exciting dcor? The answer is that SUSHI ON RAINBOW to MANY of us people of Japanese descent is actually a symbol of pride for our community. And, the owner is a very respected man to us Japanese-Americans.

When I was a little kid in Southern California, I first heard about Shogo-san and the famous sushi restaurant in Newport Beach. Sushi just did not exist in the area. Everytime a sushi restaurant poped up, it would quickly go out of business. Remember that sushi, and the idea of eating raw fish was not accepted by the American mainstream back then. The sushi bar that Shogo worked at was the only sushi bar in the area that had made it. Japanese people would drive 50+ miles just to eat there. Shogo-San was one of the 1st generation sushi chefs, along with the famous Ichiro Mashita who came to America from Japan with a dream to one day popularize sushi in America. They had to endure so much hardships during those days, but like most Japanese and Asian-Americans during that era, they fought hard to find success in the land of opportunity. Today, there is a Sushi bar on every street due to their labor. So, when I found out that Shogo had purchased SUSHI ON RAINBOW from the original owner, I was ecstatic! A great legend of California Sushi was now here in Las Vegas! This was a dream come true. 

Shogo-san has over 40 years of Sushi experience. During his youth in Kyushu, he was a very respected edo style sushi chef. Went through years of apprenticeship before he even get the opportunity to the touch the actual fish. Today, his years of experience really shows. Though the majority of his day revolves around making California Rolls for westerners, there is also a "secret menu" for those who appreciate real sushi. What I love is how every week they got something different. I've had an Edo Chirashizushi, Shinko, Engawa, a Uni-Ika mix, Maguro no Zuke, Yamaimo, and many other traditional Japanese dishes that aren't in any other J-restaurant in town. Every time I eat here I feel even more proud to have Japanese blood in my veins. 

Unlike most sushi bars in LV, SUSHI ON RAINBOW get's all it's items from true Japanese and Japanese-American distributors. The fish is from a real Japanese seafood distributor(not a Korean distributor), that get's their fish from cold waters such as Canada, and Alaska. Fish from colder waters will have meat that has more of that fatty marbling that we enjoy so much. Even the Japanese ice creams(plum wine, green tea) come from a famous Japanese ice cream company in Torrance.  

If you are a true sushi lover, the 1st thing you will notice is how Shogo's nigiri technique is unrealistically perfect compared to the other Sushi joints in town. Remember that he has had over 40 years experience. You will see immediately that even the chefs at Kabuto don't have his precision. And the funniest thing is that Shogo is very humble + modest and doesn't even brag about how great he is.

There used to be a guy named Hiro-san who worked here who was also a former edomaezushi chef from Japan.  Holy crap, that guy was like the best chef I had ever seen. But, he retired a few months ago. That totally depressed the hell out of me. 

Kyuu-chan is their new apprentice sushi chef. He is of Chinese descent but he makes a lot of Japanese chefs look like amateurs due to his amazing talent. Shogo is such a a hardcore Japanese man, that he made Kyuu learn how to speak Japanese to be a chef here. He also made the Latino cooks in the back learn Japanese, or they couldn't work. It's the coolest thing ever! There is so much old school Japanese discipline in this kitchen. But, Shogo himself is such a friendly and positive guy. You can talk to him for hours. And the coolest thing about him is that he knows everything about Japanese history and pop culture! I've had the most fascinating conversations with him.

I love coming to SUSHI ON RAINBOW and showing my respect to these great Japanese heroes. Also, every time I come here it's like that scene in "Goodfellas" when Robert DeNiro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they get him whatever he wants, and they even got a spot saved for him. I NEVER order here, all I say is "Omakase" and they take care of everything for me. 

I've written 100s of Yelp reviews, but SUSHI ON RAINBOW is my absolute favorite restaurant in not just Las Vegas, but the whole world.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 39/100

My boyfriend and I were on a mission to try all of the Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas this weekend! BurGR was our second stop of the trip!

BurGR is located literally right inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel. SUPER easy to get to from the lobby! They have this AWESOME glass window display with a metal structure emitting a bunch of flames all over it. It's really interesting and a great storefront display! They also have a bunch of Gordon Ramsay merchandise at the front such as t-shirts, cookbooks, glasses, etc.

We were able to walk right in and get seated immediately. However, a few minutes after we had been sitting at our table, I looked over to the front of the restaurant and there was a HUGE line! We got super lucky that there was nobody there when we entered at around 11:15am.

The decor of this place is super trendy, modern, and basically a sports bar with all of the large screen TVs on all of the walls displaying football and other popular sports. There are also lots of flames everywhere (I'm assuming are related to Hell's Kitchen) and a photo of Gordon Ramsay.

Waiter service was great, as usual. Our waiter immediately came to us and asked if we wanted to take a look at the drink menu, which is an iPad 2 that they give you to look at. It is an interactive menu that has all of the drinks sorted by category (beers, cocktails, red/white wine, etc.), descriptions of each drink, and even photographs. There's also a tab with Gordon Ramsay's biography and photograph, which I thought was pretty cool.

We ordered two waters, a cup of coffee, and then took a look at the menus. The menus were pretty amusing because they, too, had a giant photo of Gordon Ramsay that surprises you when you first order them :P

My bf and I ended up sharing the Shake #4 - creme brulee pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie. THIS WAS AMAZING! I had seen photos of the shakes on Yelp and was curious to try them because I've never had a shake infused with pudding before. Thanks to this shake, I am a HUGE fan of the pudding + shake combination from now on :) So yummy! The two flavors look separated (with creme brulee on top and oreo on the bottom), but surprisingly when you sipped on it, the flavors were combined and complimented each other very well. I would love to come back to try the other 4 combinations!

As for burgers, I ordered the Uber Cheese Burger (fontina cheese + raclette cheese + goat cheese), and my boyfriend got the American burger (american cheese + butter lettuce + tomato + pickle + onion). As a HUGE cheese lover, my burger was absolutely PERFECT for me! It was literally just the patty + 3 types of cheese, which was exactly what I wanted. My bf nearly inhaled his American burger and said it was super good. We unfortunately decided to skip out on getting fries because we didn't have the appetite to eat that much food! I would definitely like to come back to try the truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries.

When we received our bill, we were given an iPod that had a little survey/questionnaire for us to answer based on our dining experience at BurGR. The Yelp Elite in me naturally reached for this and began answering the questions like crazy :P I thought it was pretty cool how much they integrated the use of iPads and iPods at their restaurant!

Overall, 5 stars for a really trendy, hip atmosphere, great service, and delicious food! I would love to come back during my next visit to Vegas! :)

As they say, "time marches on".

The original POMO was a very special pizzeria, that transported it's diners back to Italy. It was located further south along Scottsdale Road in the Borgata Shopping Center, next to Blanco's. Though small, it had an intimate feel where you could have an easy conversation with you server. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz/pomo-pizzeria-napoletana-scottsdale-2#hrid:DP4ygw0P_5831sjXGX5ecA

The "new" Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria feels like a concept restaurant, sort of like Fox's Olive & Ivy or North, which is not a bad thing. But gone is that old world Italian Grotto elegance and feel. I guess it's only fitting that it's in the former Blooms space. 

Also gone is any mention of POMO's being a certified Napoletana pizzeria, from either APN (Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani) or VPN (Verace Pizza Napoletana). But in truth, the pizzas are still very good and they now have a new, much larger wood fired brick oven. 

The square footage feels three times larger. At times it seems like a dozen or so wait staff are rushing around, delivering pizzas to almost forty tables and that is just inside the restaurant. The outside space is equally large, with a heavy duty tarp covering the diners. I eyed at least two Culinary Managers on the floor keeping track of the staff and food. Nice!
 
The three of us arrived around two o'clock on Black Friday. We were seated pretty quickly, with a good view of the pizza oven. I would highly recommend the location and view. The menu has been updated. And yes it may seem more expensive, given the pricier location near Gainey Ranch and the Hyatt Regency, but it's not. 
http://www.pomopizzeria.com/pomo-scottsdale-menu.pdf. 

I started out by ordering a Cappuccino ($4.00) which was as good as anything I've had at the green mermaid. It had a nice taste but lacked foam. My friends ordered a diet soft drink and a black ice tea, both $2.50. 

Since we remembered how tasty the bruschetta was at the old POMO's we decided to start there. We had the Sorrentina for $7.95 (see photo), which was very good with a hint of garlic. 

Next we decided to share two pizzas. One was their famous Regina Margherita.  It was as tasty and good (though somewhat smaller) as it's predecessor.  I've posted two pictures, a before and after if you will. It was priced at $12.95, same as before.  

The other pizza was their Amatriciana, which comes with saut onions and tiny amount of diced panchetta. It too was very good and priced at $14.95. I believe the key to their delicious tasting pizzas, is the constant and watchful eye as they cook in an over 850 F oven. 

A new addition not found in the old Restaurante, is a grab and go sandwich annex, called "Forno Fabbri, an Italian Market & Mozzarella Bar".  It's to the left as you come into Pomo Cucina and very similar in size and setup to the ones found in Olive and Ivy or the Herb Box. It's a major plus for a quick weekday lunch, one which I will try in the near future. 

Our total for three came to $48.42, including taxes but before gratuities. It seemed fair and the food as I've mention is very good. So Four Stars and yes, we are a Fan of the new Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria. 

Enjoy!

I can safely say this was my first time even remotely being excited to eat Italian food on the strip.  Currently the hottest restaurant in the city, Giada is bringing in the masses nightly.  I thought 90 days ahead of my 7th wedding anniversary would be adequate lead time for a 7pm-ish dinner on a Tuesday, but we ended up with 9pm.  Not a big deal.  That meant more drinks at the bar!  I had a few tasty "Flash Gordon" cocktails that made me feel semi-invincible; the sensation was unfortunately fleeting as I felt like Ming the Merciless had pointed his stupid ring to my head in the AM.  

If you do one thing above anything else with your time at Giada, my advice would be to wait for a premium table.  The hostess initially walked us to a less than favorable area with only a partial strip view.  Despite her warning that it could take half an hour or more for a better spot, we stayed strong and went back to the bar.  Luckily, she came back in less than 15 minutes and brought us to an excellent table with grand views of Bellagio and Caesars Palace.  

Like Rod U. said in his excellent review, antipasti are where it's at.  If I could do it all over again, I would order more small plates of seafood, salumi, cheese, crostini, salumi, cheese, seafood and cheese.  The burrata was magnificent.  It was a creamy, mozzarella dream that tasted more heavenly as I got to the center.  Accompanying this glorious gift from cows with anything else more than olive oil, garnish and balsamic salt would have been offensive.  

I had some serious doubts about the waiter's recommendation of the "Prosciutto San Daniele" since we recently had Carnevino's "Prosciutto di Parma Riserva", but that all went away when the first slice melted in my mouth.  As unimaginable to me as it could be, it was better than Batali's.  The waiter had tried Mario's as well and agreed. Not that he was biased or anything.....

Another highlight was Giada's signature spaghetti with 2 large shrimp, lemon and basil.  She really loves her citrus as it's all over the menu.  It was wonderful!  The handmade pasta was superb and the light cream sauce at the bottom of the bowl was well worth sopping up with the shrimp.  I am a huge sucker for fresh pasta.

Although the "Veal Chop Saltimbocca" was an impressive looking entre in size, I felt it was underwhelming and quite plain.  This wasn't the kind of place that had salt and pepper shakers at the table, but I would have reached for some.  The massive leftover we brought home will definitely be getting some seasonal treatment.  The sauce it came with took it nowhere.  I wished we had given the branzino a shot instead.  At least the asparagus it came with was outstanding.  The wood grill brought out a whole new dimension of flavor to the standard upscale restaurant vegetable.  

The dessert cart they rolled out made final decisions tough but the strawberry tart, blackberry lime tiramisu and white coffee gelato (I'd bath in it) were great conclusions to an overall solid meal.  With dinner clocking in at almost 3 hours, Giada isn't a dinner before a show kind of place, this is the show.

Five of us had dinner at The Carlton last night and it was a wonderful dining experience. 

For appetizers we had: 1 jumbo lump crab cake, 1 beet salad, 1 lobster and crab gnocchi, and 2 house salads. The Jumbo Lump Crab Cake which I ordered, was meaty with crab and was very rich sitting atop of Julianne vegetables. The Dijon Cream and fresh herb sauce it came with was just delicious. The gnocchi was tender and mild which allowed the lobster and crab to predominate the flavor profile. It was served in a Spinach, Caramelized Onions and Tomato-Ketel One Cream base. Very tasty indeed.
Salad eaters, house and beet, all said they were great as well. These were all very good size appetizers so you might save some for taking home if you plan on heavy entrees and tend to fill-up fast.

With the appetizers we also finished off two lemon cream martinis, one sour apple martini and one Grey Goose on the rocks with a twist, and one Arnold Palmer (AP refills aplenty). All drinks were made well. The had a nice martini list, a pretty good wine by the glass list and a full wine list which comes out on an iPad. Pretty cool approach. I am not counting but they say they have over 500 wines on the list. Enough to match any taste or meal. Later for dinner we wanted some rich, creamy full mouth Chardonnay so the proprietor suggested Sonoma-Cutrer for us. This was delicious and great match with our food.

Dinner entrees were hard to choose from the extensive menu which includes some great daily specials which they say usually change every day. Sticking with a theme, I went the seafood route all night and choose the Florida Grouper which was prepared oven roasted and was fresh Parmesan crusted and served with Lobster Pierogies, Spring Vegetables and Roast Garlic Butter. Oh my was this meal ever rich and tender. The Grouper was completely melt in your mouth fresh and tender, and I exaggerate not one bit. The Pierogies were moist, tender and full of lobster stuffing and it went so well with the Grouper. Boy this was a satisfying choice.
 
Three people, were enticed by the 14 oz. medium to medium rare Prime Rib. They all came out looking absolutely beautiful. Jody who is the real Prime Rib  connoisseur said that his ranked up with the best of them. Jody has traveled and lived or visited may cities for extended stays.  He has lived in Las Vegas so he had the opportunity to eat a Lawry's Prime Rib several times. To which I can say when I ate there with him a time or two, and I thought it was the best I ever had. So that puts The Carlton up with the best prime rib places in our judgment.
Linda went for the Ahi Tuna entre, which she said was extremely fresh and tender with the fabulous Tuna flavor one seeks in the best sushi. But it doesn't come naked. It's preparation is fresh Wasabi-Panko crusted with the Ahi Tuna seared rare and served with Curry-Coconut Orzo, Asian Greens, Hearts of Palm-Julienne Carrots and Yuzu Butter. This was a beautiful and tasteful preparation. Had enough to bring home and it served as a special breakfast this morning.

I have to say that everything was really outstanding at The Carlton. Topping it off with some personal service, Kevin Joyce, the owner stopped at our table to see if we were enjoying or meals.  Have to hand it to Kevin, his professional staff, and especially Executive Chef Mark Swomley who has been there for 16 years. The Carlton itself has been around for 27 years which I think is a real testament to its enduring quality and service. You can not go wrong here.

Ay Caramba!!!!

I Love This Place!!!!

On our last stop through SinCity before heading out to the airport, my friends and I decided to check out this off-strip Yelp favorite. With over 1,000 reviews, Firefly has scored an impressive 4.5 star average out of five, no easy feat I might add!

Well, it goes without saying that I came with high expectations. Luckily, I was not disappointed...whew!

Upon stepping into the bustling restaurant, i heard rhythmic salsa music being played in the background and it had a very familar Latin cantina vibe to it, which felt casual and fun. With lots of red and orange all around my hankering for tasty tapas became even more amplified!

We were seated conveniently by the large window, which let in a good amount of natural lighting (excellent for foodporn) and spacious enough for us to stow our luggage.

Our server was friendly and helpful with the menu and never pushy or rude.  Within moments of ordering, we got some sliced baguettes drizzled with butter and served with pickled olives and a house butter spread. The bread was warm & crisp and house butter was delicious! 

Then came our drinks and tapas!

I must insist that you try the blood orange mojito. You can taste that the blood orange was deeply infused in this amazing drink and the combination of the refreshing mint makes this exhilarating drink all the more enjoyable! Of course, the sangrias here are phenomenal and also a must if you're going to enjoy tapas here, as well.

Now onto the tapas...

Bacon Wrapped dates with smoked almonds red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles were remarkably good! Crisp bacon wrapped around sweet dates and tooped with fragrant blue cheese crumbles is always a winning combination in my book!

Tuna tartare - the marinated tuna had a tangy Asian flare that had hints of soy, lime & chili...enjoyed on crisp taro chips, it was a delicious contrast of textures and flavors that made this tartare a shining success!

Tierra Y Mar Skewers - Grilled Shrimp, Filet Mignon, Chorizo, Salsa Verde - from the plump shrimp to the juicy filet, each morsel on the skewer was cooked perfectly. Tack on the the tangy  kick of the salsa verde and it was a virtual fiesta in the mouth! 

Duck rolls - Crisp and delicious fried wonton wrapped around tender pieces of succulent braised duck and dressed in a very tangy sweet hoisin sauce, almost too cloyingly sweet but overall, very tasty.

Filet Mignon sliders - Served with a very rich Serrano ham, cabrales cheese sauce and caramelized onions this dish was probably the most disappointing as the burgers were cooked well done leaving them without the awesome pink center I love so much. Because they were well done, they were chewier and less tender juicy and flavorful 

Camarones la diabla - Now this dish was a winner! Bursting with bright flavor and beautifully presented in a fiery red sauce, the plump shrimp were generously dressed with a sauce that creeped up slowly but left a spicy kick at the end of each bite...yum!

Ceviche - Loaded with plump shrimp, this dish came with loads of crunchy tortilla chips and buttery avocado. My only gripe would be that it needed some some spice to kick it up a notch. Nothing a lil Tabasco couldn't fix which our lovely server remedied for us upon request.

For dessert - We enjoyed a caramel flan with a lady finger and it was the perfect end to a delightful meal!

Our server also arranged cab service for us which arrived in record time!

I highly recommend Firefly to anyone looking for a great lunch or evening out with friends. The restaurant is fun, the service is friendly and the food is fantastic!

Happy Eats!

My favorite buffet in VEGAS!!! 

I came here close to when it opened years ago and remembered loving it and finally got a chance to return and i was happy it was still as good as i remember. 

Off the strip, i came here with my family after outlet shopping on a wednesday lunch. We heard about a senior deal for people over 50, but unfortunately THEY ENDED THE SENIOR DEAL. Still, it's a great deal as we only paid $16.00 per person and they have one of the biggest selections and also UNLIMITED WINE AND BEER AND GELATO!!!

PRICES: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=aVc7XXpYbfEx0zQX1169bA

Breakfast M-F 7am-10:30 $11
Lunch M-F 10:30-2:30 $16
Dinner M-Th 4pm-9pm $24

Seafood Dinner  Fri: 4pm-10pm $34
                               Sat/Sun 2:30-10pm $34

Recommendation: Go for a late breakfast and stay for lunch items, which is plenty of food!

If u want crab legs, don't bother going during the weekday lunches (not sure if they have it during weekday dinners) cuz they dont' have any.

BUT, there's so much stuff! Everything was pretty good except for the sushi, which was terrible that day. Really hard rice! :(
However, i enjoyed DESSERT the best as you can see from my pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=-2R7iQN7p-BTqDGQACzHXA
Creme Brulee, meringue cookies, carrot cake, RV cupcakes, panna cotta, tiramisu, mousse cake, chocolate cake. GELATO of many kinds, tarts,

Others: small selection of chinese food/mediterranean/mexican /indian.mussels, seafood ciopinno, shrimp scampi, baked ziti, BACON, fried shrimp, fried mushrooms, fried chicken, mash, asparagus, sweet potatoes with marshmallows, cream corn and spinach 

Sad to see some of the prices have hiked up since i originally went, but i would definitely recommend this place if ur tired of waiting in huge long lines and paying the same price or more and getting charged extra for drinks. 

Located in the M Resort- that blue building u see off to the right before you get to the strip. A great place to stop on the way home!

They sell pizza by the slice, so originally that was the plan. On the way in though I noticed a pizza special on the window for a $9.99 large (pick-up/carryout). I thought that was a great price to try out their pizza and this way it would be a freshly made pizza. Walking in it looked like a typical deli. There were tables inside and the usual pasta, tomato sauce, etc. for sale. The olives, meats and sweets they offer look very good, but they have no prices on anything. There are plenty of signs along the glass case promoting catering and their win on "Sandwich Wars" yet nothing saying how much per pound or per slice anything was. Maybe they were changing out prices and I came at an off time, but if I have to ask how much something is... I'm more than likely to just pass all together. 

The guy who took the order was nice and when I showed him my yelp check-in deal for a free "Mini Cannoli" he made sure I marked it *used* and said it would be with my order. He also said it would be about 10-ish minutes for the pizza to be made and that was cool by me. When the food was ready I checked my bag and there was no Cannoli. I had to ask for it and the girl who handed me the food acted like she had no idea about it and had to ask around. Finally, the guy who took the order came out and said "yeah yeah they get a free mini" so she went and packaged one up for me. 

The pizza deal wont be going on forever. The guy told me that they would be stopping it soon. Don't fret! If you get down here before it ends you will get a card that gets you the large cheese pizza for $9.99 every time. Score! 

Wow! The pizza was pretty darn good! I love when something as simple as a cheese pizza tastes so good. It seems lately I have been experiencing bland pizza, but not here. The sauce has a good flavor and I like the crust. I had some left over for lunch the next day and it was just as good cold! The Cannoli made for a nice dessert. I enjoyed it. 

They deliver!

I read about this new attraction in the Las Vegas Sun and decided to make a trip down to Fremont Street to give it a try.  Since my Son was off of school today, I brought him along.  The attraction is located on the far East side of Fremont Street, which is closest to Las Vegas Blvd.  The best place to park is the parking garage on the corner of Fremont Street & Las Vegas Blvd.  It's pretty cheap for parking....we were there for 2 hours and paid $3.

I posted a video on YouTube if you want to see the experience:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxzOl3TXeJs

The ticket office for this attraction is on the Fremont Street level next to the Walgreens.  Tickets are $15 each for 1 ride, $25 for 2 rides, $30 for 3 rides....that's per person.  In other words, 3 people riding once will pay $45 total.....capiche?  Cool....

Since we didn't know if we'd enjoy it, we paid $15 each for the single ride.  We should have paid $30 each for the 3 pack.....because we ended up riding a 2nd time.  The girl was cool and only charged us $10 each for the 2nd ride as if we paid for the 2 pack....not sure she'll hook you up like that though, so don't expect that.  (see pics for full price list and all day discount pricing)

The launch pad is I think 60 ft in the air and you access it by going to the 5th floor (roof) of the parking garage, which is the same building the ticket office is located.  We made our way up there and waited in line.  Everyone in line was pretty nervous, including myself.  I'm not a fan of heights, but wanted to give this a try.  My Son was pretty brave....he wasn't nervous at all....until we got up to the edge of the platform.

You get strapped into a harness and get some instruction.  Here are some tips:

- Don't wear flip flops or sandals with no ankle straps....if you do, they'll make you take them off and put them in a netted bag.

- Purses or bags without secure straps will not be allowed on the ride.

- Don't wear anything with loose pockets or if you do, don't put anything in them because it could fly out easily.

- Don't wear loose sunglasses.  They could fly of easily with the airflow generated during the ride.

- They don't allow pictures to be taken during the ride, for obvious reasons...ie your camera could slip out of your hands and seriously injure someone on the ground.

It sounds like a lot of rules, but it's common sense.  Knowing this in advance will save you a trip back to your car or hotel room.

The zipline can handle groups up to 4 people at one time.  A quick hint if you want to get on/off the ride fast.....ride as a single.  They're always looking for a single to fill up a group of three, which happened often while we were there.

We were nervous on the final walk up the stairs to the launch pad....when you get up there the instructor will attach you to a cable until you're secured on the zipline.  Each person will be hooked up to the zipline and given instructions on what to do.  I admit, I was nervous all the way up until the launch of our 1st ride.  It looks much higher from the launch pad than from the ground.

After everyone is given instructions, he releases the safety clip and you lift up your legs and your body weight launches you down the zipline.  If you want to go really fast, tuck your knees up to your chest like a cannon ball dive in a pool.....you'll pick up speed right away.  If you stay in this position, you'll maximize your speed all the way through the ride.....this was a tip given to us by the instructor.

The ride itself is very fun.....you feel like you're flying above everyone, because you are.  It was very exhilarating and I felt free.  The landing is the roughest part.....you slam into a padded stopping mechanism and your momentum swings you up quickly while an employee secures your line with a rope.  I was amazed at how fast we came in on the landing.....the 2nd time around I nailed the employee in the shoulder with my knee....I'm surprised he didn't go down.  He said it happens all day long.....I wouldn't want his job.

After your ride, you get your picture taken and you have the option to purchase pictures of your ride.....prices are $10 each for the 1st 2 pics, then $5 a pic after that.  I paid for 4 pics since we couldn't take any on the ride itself.....nice to have as a souvenir for the 1st time, won't pay for it again though.  I didn't post those pics because I don't have a scanner.  The pics I posted of people on the zipline were other riders.  The pics from the launch pad was from my perspective....I put the camera away just before launch.

Overall, it was an exhilarating ride and we had a blast.

Will we return?  There's no doubt about it.....I'm taking all of my friends who visit from out of town to ride.

They say, you can never go home, or go back. Well, I've never bought into that. 

Over the years, we've been in almost a dozen or so Chart Houses. Sadly, many have closed due to whatever corporate reorg was going on at the time. I miss the ones in Steamboat and Newport, RI the most. Great locations and views. 

So it was with some excitement that we made reservations here for Easter Sunday dinner. Surprisingly, we have never been to this location.

We arrived a few minutes before six and found our hostess in a middle of a hiccups fit. I offered to frighten her but she decline. I guess I was scary enough. LOL

There was also some confusion over our reservations, but it didn't last long. We were escorted to our table, over by the window with a magnificent view of the lake. You got to give Chart House credit for choosing some great locations!

We started with a glass of Merlot and Pinot each. Both were very good for house wines. We also opted for the salads, the warm bacon dressing was delicious, as was the Caesar.

Things started slowly declining from here. I asked about getting their Callahan Prime Rib End Cut ($33.99). Seems the kitchen couldn't make up their minds if they had one. 

First it was no, then yes and finally surprise, they delivered a regular cut. It was tasteless with no flavor at all. When we were paying I mentioned it to our server, all they could say was, "oh yeah."  Grrr. LOL. The other entree was their Beef Tenderloin Medallions ($31.99) which was very good. 


For dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake to share with some coffee. It came damaged and somewhat of a mess. LOL. See our photo, versus the Chart House one. Our waiter apologized saying they should have been picked it up sooner. (Okay, why didn't you bring us another one?). 

The current owners of Chart House is Landry, a very classy and sharp organization.  I would suggest they work on this location before they need to close this one too. 

Our bill, including two glasses of wine ran us $80.00 a person, including taxes and gratuities. 

Now why didn't we go to Capital Grill I wonder?  Well, maybe next time.

For a positive review of a Chart House, I call your attention to my friend Norm's recent experience in Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz/forte-european-tapas-bar-and-bistro-las-vegas?hrid=Gpo-2lh59Bru8sKqgRm5Hw

When I stopped in for dinner the other night, I was surprised to see this place still called Martinez Taco Bar. I came by about 2 months ago and the girl who took my order said they were using the name Martinez Taco Bar for now, but said they would be changing to "Aranda's Taco Shop" and gave me a business card and coupon for a free agua fresca upon their re-opening. I was hoping after 2 months they would have worked out necessary kinks and have the menu in better order. That's something they are still working on according to the girl who took my order this time. it's confusing though because the menus posted on yelp and the menu they have posted on their walls and the printed menus they have out all are different from from the items offered to the price of them. I wanted to try certain things and couldn't because they say they aren't Martinez Taco Bar anymore and are changing the menu around some. Why still use that name after all this time and still not have your menu together? Loco! 

They have a large menu with basically the same thing over and over just in different sizes and maybe a couple different toppings. If you want a basic street taco those are $2 each and come with onions and cilantro. If you want a bit more on your taco and double the meat, the regular tacos are for you. The regular tacos were $3.75 and came with cheese, salsa, guacamole and double meat. They were out of guacamole on my first visit and so they gave me freshly sliced avocado instead and the same thing happened on this last visit. I don't know how they are out of guacamole again, but I have to admit that I really liked the sliced 'cado on my taco and wouldn't mind it that way each time. The street taco had decent flavor and for $2 is a great deal. There is a free salsa bar where you can dress your food as you wish or they have containers for you to fill up what you want if you are taking your order to-go. The price of the regular taco was steep, but it did taste good and I appreciated the amount of stuff inside it. I tried their Al Pastor and Carne Asada. The Al Pastor isn't the best in town, but it was OK as far as taste (a bit overcooked yet had a decent flavor) and something I'd order again if they weren't out of pineapple like they were on both my last visits. The asada was just OK for me, but my hubby did enjoy it. They weren't shy with filling up the asada tacos and that is a plus. There is a good size patio with tables and chairs outside. The food was good, but other kinks still seem to be holding them back in my opinion.

Both visits the soda fountain was out of order. I feel like this place has something, but they certainly have kinks to work out. if they are changing names they should do it and they should have menus that are all the same. It's frustrating to order 3 different things and be told that they don't serve it anymore. Hopefully they will get it together because I'd like to see them succeed being a local family run business. 3.5 stars.

I have been back several times before writing this review update just to make sure all the inconsistency that I have been experiencing is now the way of Bagel Cafe and not just an off day they were having. I'm prepared for the loyal fixtures to be upset, but if you really have been eating here since it opened then you know it's not the same. I first started eating here at Bagel Cafe (I was a teenager) after it opened. It was worth the long wait to get a table as the food was spot on excellent. Sure we all know the best breakfast in town is at the Omelet House on Charleston, but this place definitely came close behind at one point. In the last 6 months I have experienced meals here at Bagel Cafe that were just not worth the money or wait for what you got. They don't even use Boar's Head deli meats anymore! WTH?!?!?!? They use some brand I have never heard of. The taste and quality of the deli meat just isn't the same as it used to be. They claim the bagels are made fresh daily yet they are rock hard. I have never liked the bagels here, but if it's in your name.... live up to it!

As you can tell from my previous review and pictures, I really used to like this place. Consistency is a major issue. The sandwiches used to be made with Boar's Head deli meat and was piled high between the bread of your choice and a real winner. Now you get some other brand of meat just bunched up in a ball between 2 dry pieces of bread. I can do that at home! Then there is breakfast. I usually order breakfast here. The last 3 times the coffee has tasted bitter and nasty. Getting a refill was a major chore as well. I noticed the servers didn't have name tags on my last visit or I would give a proper shout-out to the waitress who has messed up my order lately and has terrible customer service. I ordered "One Egg any style W/Bacon" priced at $8.95 and asked for eggs to be scrambled with shredded cheddar cheese on top. Such a simple breakfast right? Apparently not For Bagel Cafe. The breakfast also came with a bagel of my choice and breakfast potatoes. When my food arrived I noticed there was a slice of cheddar cheese on my eggs. UGH! If you don't have shredded cheese just let the customer know so they can maybe make another choice. I would have had the egg over medium or easy to dunk my bacon in if I had known. The "Asiago" bagel I had was so tough and hard!  I was with another yelper one of my last visits and showed him how I was able to bang the bagel on the table and it just broke in pieces.  The bacon was terrible. From the picture it looks heavenly, but let me tell you it was rock hard and seemed like it was honestly pulled from the fridge or something. When my meal arrived the bacon was missing, so I informed our waitress and she replies to me "oh did you want bacon?" to which I'm like HELL YES why would I have ordered a breakfast that comes with it if I didn't want it? She then brings me the cold/hard bacon and when the receipt comes she charged me $3.50 for a side of bacon. Seriously? It was supposed to come with the breakfast I ordered. She made me feel like I had done something wrong when she actually is a very lousy waitress. The potatoes I had were the only thing edible on the plate and even those aren't the same potatoes as they have had in the past. With this place not being consistent and having waitresses who can't do their job right, I'm going to  BabyStacks Cafe and Omelet House from now on for breakfast and will make the drive to Henderson to eat at Weiss.

I never have been a huge fan of Johnny Rocket's, so when I found out The Wiener's Circle would be taking the spot JR was in, I was happy. A lot of the signs say it's near the bowling alley when it's actually closer to the doors near the buffet. I have enjoyed my experience at The Wiener's Circle inside Red Rock, but there is something about this location inside Santa Fe that was just better to me. If you are familiar with the original The Wiener's Circle in Chicago, then you know they have a different attitude when it gets dark. Here at this location they don't sling any insults (they play games with customers and sling expected insults at the original location after a certain hour even handing out free food and shirts sometimes) or play any games, but what I have experienced is great customer service. The guy who took my order was very nice and patient while I went over the menu. He also told me about different combo deals that include fried and a drink. I have to give them props as far as the menu prices go. Being in a casino usually means marked up prices and sometimes not the same product you'd expect, but I found the prices to be fair and the food tasted great. I've been back a few times now and will be back plenty more! 

Char Dog - I got the combo priced at $6.99 that came with fries and a drink. The dog had onions, relish, mustard, pickles, tomatoes, peppers and celery salt. I asked that the dog be lightly charred and that's exactly what I got. The cook even came over to our table to make sure I liked it. I had them add cheese to my fries and the cheese sauce is thick and delicious! I could eat a huge pile (they already give you 1/2 pound with your order) of just those fries covered in cheese and my taste buds would be happy. 

Chicken Fingers - As a combo it was $7.99 with fries and a drink. They also give you a choice of mustard, ranch and honey mustard to dip your fingers. I really like the honey mustard here it goes well with the fingers. The fingers didn't look to plump or appetizing when I first saw them, but they really had good flavor and the chicken tasted good enough with out any sauce to dip, but trust me and pair it with the honey mustard. 

Wieners in a Blanket  - These were $4.99 and tasty little bites! They come 6 to an order, but when I got my order I noticed I had 8 of them. Score! You can choose a dipping sauce for these so I obviously chose honey mustard. I don't think these would fill someone alone, but they make a great snack to share along with your meal or nice portion for a kids meal. 

They have booths and tables or you can get your food to-go.

When I was asked to dine at a AAA Five Diamond, Forbes Five Star, Three Michelin Star, Wine Spectator Grand Award and Chef of the Century's restaurant, the question wasn't IF...It was WHEN!

My last night in Vegas marked the unforgettable occasion and as soon as I opened those shiny glass paned double doors, I knew I was in for a treat!  As I walked across the foyer into the main dining room,  I left the hustle and bustle of the frenzied casino behind me and I was instantly transported into a luxurious 1930's style French bistro with a huge crystal chandelier cascading above me. Honestly, this place was dripping with opulence!
Truth be told, I do get a bit uncomfortable in fancy schmancy restaurants.  Perhaps it's the well pressed white table cloths or the half dozen stuffy staff serving my every whim, but this place was not like that at all.  The servers were warm, friendly and present without being overbearing, which was really nice!  Add to that the elegant yet inviting atmosphere and I was feeling like a king! A hungry one at that!    
 
As soon as we were seated and handed our nicely bound menus, I instantly knew in my mind that I wanted to try the 16 course tasting menu.  Heck, you only live once, right? 

Because we were in a festive mood, we decided on a bottle of bubbly and for me, a bottle of Veuve Clicquot fit the bill perfectly!

Then came the famous bread cart in all its glory! Wow! It was a sight to see! There were more than a dozen breads to choose from to start the meal and i think we tried almost all of em!  Three magnificent breads, however, stood out from the pack.  Those being the buttery cheese brioche, savory bacon epi, and chewy cheese baguette.  

Then, of course, came the food! Honestly, it was so beautifully plated there were times I simply felt it was a shame to eat it! But I got over that hurdle fairly quickly. 

Now, I don't plan on boring you with the entire 16 course blow by blow, but I will focus on the dining highlights which made the evening extra special for me!

Amuse Bouche "sangria emulsion" refreshingly light citrusy blood orange cream emulsion above a chilled jam in a whimsical dry ice bowl with small chunks of apples and berry sangria gelee.  Lip smacking tartness with a delightfully smooth & creamy finish! Excellent way to awaken the palate!  

Trio of Caviar 
Caviar with Asparagus - Although not the most interesting pairing of the evening, the flavors of the fresh green asparagus and salty caviar played well against each other. 
Salmon Tartare with Shiso Sprouts and Caviar - The textures were delicate and the flavors were refined.  
Daikon Cous Cous with Caviar - The thin delicate slivers of cool daikon wrapped around fluffy cous cous and topped with caviar was an exhilarating finish to an interesting play on Japanese cuisine.       

Lobster - Topped with fragrant black truffle, the langoustine ravioli was magnificent! The grilled lobster was simple yet beautifully presented. Subtle flavors but hey it's lobster! Sometimes a good thing shouldn't be messed with! The smooth & creamy sea urchin fennel potato puree was inspiring and texturally inviting, as well.

Chestnut Soup over Foie Gras Foam - Rich frothy and flavorful with savory bacon bits. The chunks of roasted chestnuts added a subtle sweetness to this warm and rustic soup. 

Bone marrow - One of my personal favorites! The marrow was luscious, rich and supple in texture. It also exhibited the most irresistible aroma! The popcorn added a pleasant textural dimension to this delightful dish.

Sea bass - Beautifully seared, this magnificent piece of fish came bathing in an irresistible butter sauce. The artichoke balanced the flavor profiles nicely. 

Birthday Cake - As the evening came to a close, the staff came out with a cart embellished with lavish decorative baubles and a small sign that read "Happy Birthday" The accompanying birthday cake was extraordinary! Perched on a large black pedestal, it was absolutely majestic but all I could think of was digging into it!  To my surprise, it was a mango meringue ice cream cake and although we couldn't take it home with us, we did indulge in two large decadent slices and it was fantastic! Bravo to the dessert chef!

If that wasn't enough we were given free reign of the mignardises (dessert cart) that had a vast selection of petit fors, small cookies and yes...macarons!

They boxed up the cookies and gave us an additional box of marshmallow treats to take home with a copy of the menu and a nicely bound colored brochure documenting the magical evening.

I'd have to say this was by far the most amazing dining experience
of my life.  Would i do it again? Someday. 

But for now, I'll just revel in the fine memories of an unforgettable evening that will leave my palate in infinite bliss!

Happy "Birthday" Eats, Part Deux!!

I attempted Cafe Zupas on opening day and the line was so long out the door that I decided to wait. It was worth it! Cafe Zupas is kind of like Panera Bread, serving sandwiches, soups, salads and bakery stuff. The only thing different is Cafe Zupas is much fresher and tastier! 

When you first walk in they have large easy to read menu boards. You place your order telling them what you want on what, pay for your food and find a table where your food is brought out to you. They have a pretty good amount of seating offering tables as well booths. 

Sandwiches by themselves are $4.99 each, salads by themselves are $4.99 for the half size and $6.99 for the large size, soups are $3.99 for the half size and $5.99 for the large size.

There is a  "Try 2 Combo" priced at $7.99 where you can pick from two of the following:
- Whole Sandwich
- Half Soup
- Half Salad 

I ordered the "Honey Bacon Club" and "Summer Chicken Salad" from the try 2 combo. The portion size was great. The honey bacon club is a grilled panini with turkey, ham, bacon, tomatoes, muenster cheese and honey mustard. So good! I will order this one again for sure. The summer chicken salad has chicken, fresh strawberries, cashews, dried cranberries, grapes, mixed greens and strawberry vinaigrette dressing. The salad tasted to fresh and yummy! They have over a dozen salads to choose from so there is a nice variety to choose from each time. A really nice touch was the chocolate covered strawberry that came complimentary with my meal! Hubby got one with his too! Hubby ordered a "Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup" that was put of this world delicious! I ended up getting a spoon and sharing it with him it was just so good. The soup is whole heads of cauliflower blended together with cheddar and pepper jack cheese. Bacon was added for an additional 59 cents. Fresh bread also comes with the meal so it was nice to dip in the soup!

So I saw a dessert in the case that called my name. It was the "Sinful 7 Chocolate Cake" priced at $4.49 and I got it to-go. This cake is any true chocolate lovers dream come true! It lives up to it's name and is sinfully good.

The drink bar offers 16 different fountain drinks with free Italian Soda flavorings. If you have a device that needs some juice then you can take advantage if the recharge bar. They do offer catering, but if they offer online ordering I didn't see anything about it. There is a sign that says they do not take tips, but will gladly clean up your dishes (yep they use real dishes) and table when you are finished. The customer service was fantastic and the inside was very clean. I will be back!

I had my hopes up for this place. Walking in it seemed like a fun atmosphere, but quickly it felt like more of a tourist attraction. From the start our server was trying to get us to buy raffle tickets. It didn't stop there. When she would check on us, she was saying things like "if you like the taste of that, we sell it in our gift shop" and at the end of the meal even asked if she could walk with us to the gift shop (we told her that we didn't want to go earlier and thanked her for the info) to pick somethings out so she could meet her goal since she was in the lead for some sort of competition with the other employees for work. To put people on the spot so many times is rude. Ask once and if the customer is interested they will tell you! 

What encouraged us to come here was because I have family here in town that is hosting an exchange student from Germany and I thought she would not only like this place, but maybe feel a bit of home. We sat at nice long table that is shared with the other customers. I don't personally like that, but that's the theme here so it was fine. There was live music being played which was cool. 

Priced at $19.99 we started out with the "Sausage Tower" at the suggestion of our server. She said it was a "hidden" menu item since it isn't on the menu and it would give us a good taste of the different sausages they have. Sounded good to me! When it arrived, it looked like a tower of heaven. There were 3 dishes. 1 dish had chicken bratwurst, pork sausage and veal bratwurst on a bed of sauerkraut. The 2nd dish had krainer, grilled weisswurst and a frankfurter with potato salad. The 3rd dish had 2 fresh baked pretzels with 2 types of dipping sauces. Of all the sausages I only really liked the taste of a couple of them, so it was nice to be able to sample it all instead of just ordering a certain sausage dish that I might have had a type of sausage in it that I wasn't to find of. The pretzels were pretty good and the mustard sauces had good flavor. For my meal I had priced at $4.95 a "House Salad" and priced at $14.95 the "Grillhendl" which is a chicken dish. The salad was average, but the chicken dish was above average. The chicken was roasted and stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions. The chicken was crispy and had a good flavor. It also came with a side of potato salad that was decent. 

I certainly didn't leave hungry! I didn't leave feeling like I would come back though either. The vibe inside just screamed "gimmick" and "tourist attraction here" which our guest from Germany agreed. The server was just too pushy about trying to get us to buy different things. My husbands meal was a joke especially for the price, so I lucked out with the chicken dish I ordered. I'm glad I experienced Hofbruhaus at least once.

When you combine the quality of ingredients, service and tremendous value, Soho is a place worth coming back to again and again.  Dinner for 4 came out to around $60 before tip and we got to try a nice variety of dishes.

It was easy to see and taste the high grade fish they used right off the bat in the "Seared Tuna Special" which included crispy shallots, sweet onion, micro greens and chili oil combined with super fresh nigiri cuts of maguro.  This was a terrific mix of flavors.  $11!  That's about 50% off the strip price.  I almost wished I didn't have to share it.  

I couldn't turn my back on the $3 (!!) Soho Tostadas and went with the tuna with Hawaiian poke sauce.  The tostada itself was made of taro and there were some delicious chunks of tuna on top mixed with cilantro and avocado cream.  Another great starter for sure.  The rock shrimp done tempura style was also nice portion for $7 and came with 3 unique sauces that I fail to remember the details of since my wife was seriously sweating the end of the Seahawks/Rams Monday night game due to some sports bets she had.  It was nice they had one TV up.

Hydro Bibb Black Cod for $5 was a total freakin tease that ensured I'll get a full order of miso marinated black cod the next time.  Even the smaller portioned cod were cooked really well and the combo of cool lettuce, crispy wontons and fish was kind of like a deluxe protein taco.  

Those all were excellent opening acts for what I was personally here for which was the short rib dish.  Ever since I saw that one picture of all those short ribs being grilled, I knew it was destiny!  It totally delivered.  The one rib was like something out the The Flintstones and tasted as good as it looked.  It was juicy and so tender that you could've just picked at it with chopsticks sans fork and knife.  

The chef and owner of Soho, John Chien Lee, stopped by our table to ask how things were and gave us a breakdown on the business.  We were still open to one more dish so I asked him for a recommendation.  He asked what we liked and we said salmon.  He asked if we wanted something cooked or raw and we said raw.  He said he'd make something special for us off the menu (YES!) and 10 minutes later brought over this delectable dish with 8 pieces of scallop wrapped with salmon topped with a little green, lemon and some other stuff I can't remember.  John whipped up this dish thinking it would be a great finish to the meal after the heaviness of the short rib and MAN was he right.  Then he told us it was on the house!  Thanks, John!!  I suck for not taking photos of anything.  

Las Vegas strip quality for locals!  Check it out.

As i rubbed my overstuffed belly, dude said it's ok if i want to unbutton. I told him i unbuttoned already about 30 min ago!

Wowee, i think i consumed more food here that i did at the buffets. 
I brought my relatives here to treat them to a nice steak dinner, without breaking the bank. 
For restaurant week, they were doing a great deal (which is pretty much half of their power couple meal). For $50, you get a 3 course meal. Most of our table ordered that, while my dude and uncle just got their manly bone in Rib Eyes. The deal came with a Petit Filet and crabcake, along with salad and dessert. But ur allowed to tweak your meal and don't necessarily have to stick with the written options- a few items, u have to pay extra for. 
You start off with huge sesame seed bread served with butter. Not the best bread steak house bread i've had, but it was soft and yummy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=0BlIFseV-5Hd16I-PcRrXQ 

My Del's salad was awesome!. Mainly cuz it came with two huge pieces of delicious thick but crisp bacon on top!!! I got mine with an avocado dressing which was so good! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=Gl37AEprIq227kFoigLohw

The petit Filet was pretty filling and cooked nicely med rare.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=fNMin5UVASwyyFBm_eMUlg
The bone in Rib Eye was good as well, dude loved it as he's had it before. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=HyA9h7GFL35u0YrUgi3uvg  It was good, but i felt it lacked that buttery char that i love on my rib eye. Mastros i say still does a better Bone In Rib eye. 

For sides, the staff comes around and spoons out the sides you ordered, which come in large portions that u could share them. 
I tried the spinach (creamy with bacon!), and mushrooms were ok. 
The baked potato looked good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=_fxRw3wX86gejNGyy2rAWg

The crabcakes were pretty good. 
My uncle got the Salmon and said that the Tchoupitoulas sauce it came with was delicious and light. 
My aunt got the seared tuna steak- which was good but not great. She enjoyed the crab cake more. 

We all let out some gasps when we saw the humongous desserts!
We were too stuffed but couldn't resist the yummy looking desserts. 
The bread pudding was the best-  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=J4y4JWu2Kzjwv4Q_Ein0cQ
Strawberry cheesecake was huge and very cream cheesy than sweet 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=NiuW7t29bUx5BSZYH-8DKw
Chocolate mousse was delicious. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=PU3xnSpdx9YjuOQpNiNikQ
One dessert, i think is big enough to share between 3 people, esp after having a huge dinner already. 

Service was outstanding. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and took his time explaining everything and made us all feel very comfortable. We saw atleast 10 different wait staff come to our table, either refilling our drinks (even after one sip!) or bringing out our dishes. 

I signed up for their rewards card which racks you up points for dollars spent for gift cards. They charge u an initial fee of $25.00 which they reinburse you in the form of a giftcard for later. You can also sign up online before going there, so you can use it on your first visit. Be sure to let them know of any b-days, as u will get a comped dessert!

I'm in Las Vegas with my father for one night (don't ask, we're not getting married or any sick Red state shit like that) and I refuse to eat where we are staying because as much as I love me some free room service, I cannot handle when my only choice on the menu is a STEAMED VEGETABLE PLATTER.  that is right.  it is a platter of steamed vegetables and a scoop of white rice.  just typing that sentence makes me want to get sick all over this computer.  now, you might be thinking, "Laura, aren't you on Weight Watchers?" and to that I say, "Fuck you."  

So anyway, I decide we're going to be adventurous and take a trip off the strip to a mostly vegetarian restaurant that I've been to before called Long Life Vege.  It's about a ten minute cab ride away, it's cheap and they have delicious fake meat.  Delicious.  While my dad may hate fake meat product, there is nothing the man loves more than cheap (the dude likes to be told how much you spent on his birthday present and if it's under $10 he will be all, "HIGH FIVE!" Once, my sister got him a pair of toe nail clippers from Mac Frugal's (RIP) for 99 cents and the man shed a tear.  HE CRIED, HE WAS SO PROUD) so we were in a cab faster than you can say, "faux chicken chow mein."  Well, our cabbie was a delightful chap from Somalia who was very affable and talkative and when he asked why we were going to a vegetarian restaurant, my dad said, "Because this one's a VEGAN!  Hahaha!' and they laughed and laughed.  Good one, you guys!  It IS hilarious when someone is vegan!  HAR DEE FUCKING HAR HAR.

we pull up to Long Life Vege and the motherfucker is closed.  GODDAMMIT.  we ask our cabbie for restaurant recommendations and he suggests Merkato since it is nearby and he is a regular.  We get to Merkato and as we are getting out of the cab, both my dad and I realize that we forgot our wallets.  Well, actually, my dad forgot his wallet and I "forgot" mine, you dig?  I ain't paying when money bags is around!  I wrangle dogs for a living and my father gets hundred dollar bills poured on his head just for waking up.  Plus, there will be no social security left for me when i'm old and I gotta save NOW!  and by save NOW!, i mean buy that new ipod phone because it's SWEET!  do you think it comes in pink??

We take a cab back to the hotel, my dad get his wallet, takes out another $100 from the ATM and we drive back to Merkato.  The cab is $45 at this point so my dad gives the guy what he thinks is $70 because he has put up with our insanity for the evening.  You're saying to yourself, "Who gives a fuck, Laura?" And to that I say, "Wait for it. You will get a mild satisfaction at the end but it's probably still not worth reading the whole long ass review."

We walk into Merkato and are the only non-Ethiopian people in the place and it's crazy crowded.  Both VERY good signs for potential deliciousness.  I order the veggie combo (which was a very typical veggie combo: yellow lentils, red lentils, mustard greens, enjera salad, etc) and it was MAGNIFICENT.  One of the best i've had and I've had A LOT.  my dad got the dead lambert and said the flavor was fantastic but there was too much fat and gristle.  now, contrary to popular belief, i haven't always been vegan.  i used to eat meat and let me tell you, i liked the grossest meat.  tendons and gristle and marrow...i mean, i would CLEAN a chicken bone and then use a splinter to pick my teef.  i was a hardcore red neck of an obese 9 year-old until i figured out i was eating bambi.  ANYWAY, if you are currently like i was when i was 9 years-old, then get the lamb and when you're done, have your cholesterol checked because i'm pretty sure you're gonna drop dead at any moment.  

So, we finish our fantastic meal about 15 hours after we first walked in (that's how they roll in Ethiopia.  Slowly.  But friendly.  Like this review.) and as he's paying, my dad realizes that instead of the $30 tip he thought he left our lovable cabbie, he gave him $115 tip.  MY DAD'S BAD!  we also realized that we had no way back to the hotel. luckily when i asked our waitress to call us a cab, she was all, "hold on" and disappears.  two minutes later, a guy who was eating a few tables over has us in his cab, headed back to the hotel.  Major bonus.

In the end, we're dealing with:

Cab rides: $135.  
Dinner: $25 (for two HUGE plates plus two beers and tea)
Average Cost of Dinner for Two People in Las Vegas in Some Cheesy Rip Off Restaurant On The Strip: $200.  

So anyway, I think we still did good.  And there's a cab driver (Yasin!  Holla!) who is high rolling tonight.  Or, you know, sending money back to his family in his war torn country.  As my dad put it, his company is paying and screw those jerkwads, the better man (Yasin! Holla!) wins tonight!  I love my dad.  

I am finally done, you can rest your eyes.  Get up, stretch, do some squats, get the blood flowing...you've been here awhile.

I noticed ZiKiZ while in the area a couple months ago and decided to bookmark it based on the positive reviews and the food sounded good. I met yelper Tracy P here for lunch and walking in we were greeted right away. The 2 men behind the counter were very friendly and told us about their menu. They said they specialized in customizing any order with what's offered on the menu. You pick if you want a wrap, salad or bowl (prices vary) and then pick what you want inside. They have chicken, steak, crab and falafel and a variety of veggies. 

Priced at $7.99 I ordered a "Chicken Wrap" with salad mix, red onion, black olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, ZiKiZ sauce and feta cheese (.50 cents extra for feta) inside a sundried tomato tortilla. I said that I would be eating the wrap inside, but would like the chicken on the side to-go. The guy looked at me kind of funny and said I needed to pick a protein to go into my meal. I looked funny back at him because he just told me a minute prior that they specialized in customizing any order, so what was the big deal with just putting the chicken on the side? I like the Greek Salad Wrap over at The Great Greek on Warm Springs and was hoping to create a wrap somewhat like that. I just said the chicken inside the wrap would be fine. My friend, Tracy had a coupon for $5 off any order over $20 which was a nice bonus. The guy accepted the coupon with no problem, but he majorly messed up when it came to ringing up our order. We wanted to add 2 sides and 2 drinks for an additional $2.99 each. He never asked us what sides we wanted and when we were looking over the menu deciding which ones we wanted, he says "oh I thought you'd want fries" and I was wondering why he was picking for us. I said no, we never asked for fries and don't want those, but we'd like to try the ZiKiZ rice. He then brought only 1 side of rice over and not the 2nd. Then he starts to talk to the next customer and we haven't even received our drink cups. I ask for them and he only hands 1 cup over. What the heck? We mentioned that we needed the other drink (deciding to just give up on the 2nd side we never received) and he just smiles and hands a cup over. I wasn't given a receipt, so I don't know how he charged me. I am thinking he didn't ring up the 2nd drink and side or something, but with the coupon our total was only $15 and some change, so not a bad price to try a new place out.   He did give the coupon back and said to save it to use again.

The rice was very bland. I really tasted no flavor and decided since it was in a container already to just take it home and give it to my dog with her dinner. The wrap was just average. I did like the taste of the tortilla, but the chicken really had no flavor and the veggies stood out more as far as flavor goes. With them not customizing my order the way I wanted, the food only tasting average, the mix up with sides and drinks and the food not being that great, I can't see coming back.

SHUT IT DOWN!

I was incredibly disappointed when we went to grab dinner here last night. Chef Ramsey would have been so upset at the lack of customer respect. It was like they really didn't care. And I found this unacceptable. 

The hostess took us to our table which was a very cool table but it was not very comfortable for our group to have dinner at. It was so low, that there was no way we could even eat or cut our meat. If we were just drinking then we would have hung out here all night. I asked the hostess for a booth, which was right next to the original table. 

She told me that the 4 empty booths were reserved and we couldn't sit there. I asked the hostess how embarrassed would she be if we sat at the uncomfortable table and no one showed up for those 4 booths in the next hour.  She ignored me and didn't respond. 

She then told me that this was the only table we could have. The sad part is that 60% of the tables were empty and she refused to seat us anywhere else.  I told her I wanted to speak to the manager. She went back to the hostesses station told the other girl and the second hostess rolled her eyes. Honestly I'm the customer.  I don't need to see that. The hostess made a phone call to the manager, who never picked up his phone.  She then went in the back and when she came back she gave us one of the booths we had requested. Wow! What changed?

First, why did it take me 10 minutes to get a booth in a restaurant that was only 40% full. Secondly, I asked to speak to the manager and the manager never came out. Why? Completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Really where is the manager and why didn't he come over to talk to us. 

On a side note: At 10:22pm, we were seated and at 12:19am the booths were still empty.  In fact, nobody ever sat in any of those booths for almost 2 hours. It became apparent that the hostess completely lied to us by telling us they were reserved. Who is training the staff to act like this?

Plus we sat at our table with no service for about 10 minutes. I believe the hostesses probably thought it was funny to send no one over.  We all discussed leaving but decided to stay. 

At 11:52pm all of the lights went full blast, during our meal. It was so bright it hurt our eyes. I spoke to the guy cleaning the tables and he went to speak to the manager and the lights went back down after 5 minutes.  We were just trying to finish our dinner. He came back and said, "the manager had no idea who turned all the lights on!" I think the manager might need a visit from GR and he may have his lights turned on. The waitress told us the lights go full blast every night at that time. I think it must be on a timer, like last call for alcohol. But it should not blast all the lights in the dinning areas. It was not a fun feeling as we ate our dinners. 

My first drink didn't look like the picture in the iPad menu. And I was told by the waitress that the drinks never look like the photos in the iPad. Then why do we have photos of the drinks in the iPad? Again this is wrong and not right. GR would be screaming at someone. 

I went to order another drink at 12:00am but was informed that the bar was closed. I said really and why didn't someone tell us it was last call. There was no response. I told the waitress that I was just having a wheat beer and it shouldn't be a problem to pour a pint. All the bartenders were still there. She went to ask and came back with my pint but I noticed that the Orange slice was missing and about an inch of beer was also missing.  I asked where was the orange slice (this beer is suppose to come with it) and I was told that it was wrapped in Saran Wrap and put away. I asked her to grab me a slice and she said that it wouldn't be possible. Why is this dinner so painful?

I'm so mad that I haven't even got to reviewing the food yet.  The best thing we had here was the fingerling potatoes. It was a side dish but it was the star of the show. My buddy was not happy with his lamb. It was covered in a cheese and he felt it was over powering. I liked my PEI mussels and clams but didn't love them. They came with chorizo, carmelized fennel and lemon zest. I've had better mussel dishes elsewhere. I will say that the shellfish was fresh and only two clams had some sand in them. 

Would I come back here again? Probably never! So you're saying there's a chance? I would only probably ever eat here if Chef Ramsey was actually here running it. This place needs to be on one of those Restaurant Rescue Food shows and its only been open 4 months. I was also informed by the staff that GR had only been there 5 times in the last 4 months, since this location opened. If that is true then, he really needs to spend some time here fixing the many issues. I think the loser of Hell's Kitchen might be running this place?

I let my love of GR influence my choice to stay! Next time I will follow my brain and not my heart. We should have all walked.
