This is probably the easiest trail that you're ever going to hike besides walking around your block. You only go up an additional 400 plus feet in elevation during the hike. I believe the total loop is a little over 4 miles. This is a great hike for beginners and hiking in groups where you can have casual conversations. There are some rocky parts but mostly this is a dirt trail. This hike at a slow walking pace is about a two hour hike. There are some nice vistas so bring your camera.

It's all about the Cosmo! My two hotspots i had to visit were at the Cosmopolitan. Wicked Spoon Buffet and The Pizzaria. Walking through this hotel to get to these places were alot of fun. Random things all over the place. Maybe not those bunnies on the commercials, but shoes in the middle of nowhere, cool cigarette dispenser looking things offering artwork. Sparkly stuff. I loved walking through this place and hope to one day stay here and party at the Marquee.

You can bring a Diet Coke can on the bus.

Back packs, briefcases and shopping bags.
You can even bring your own stinky body odor.
Lots of them you know!
And I imagine you should bring $1.25. Only on this day. 
It was free. 
How cool. A free ride to the stadium. A/C!
Oh.

Best shop in town.
Every employee at Dyno-Comp is well-informed and treats the business like their own. This translates to quality work and attention to detail, as well as attention to the client.  Nobody is trying to screw you or upsell, and the work they do is bar none the best available.
I personally have dealt with Richard, Ken, and Ron, and could not be happier. 
If you want your car to go from just a car to something truly special, do yourself a favor and take it here.

Secret pizza is the shit. Sober or drunk, it's worth the wait and the ridiculous conversations and interactions from all the sloppy mcsloppersons standing in line for a slice makes it quite entertaining as well. I liked the pepperoni, but I loved the white pizza with ricotta, mushrooms (?) and pepperoni! Just get a whole pizza for your group instead of ordering individual slices, because they're like the Pringles of the pizza world, once you pop you can't stop.

It's definitely not the Encore or Wynn. The spa is lovely. The gym has great equipment but no bottled water. The rooms were okay but seemed dated. The whole sunken living room idea seems very 1970. Getting help from the concierge was a bit frustrating as they were at capacity. They were able to accommodate a late checkout, which was appreciated but I would not choose to stay here again as I think there are several Vegas properties that are much nicer.

Could this store BE any smaller (said in my best Chandler Bing voice)? I seriously walked in with Rickie, stayed 90 seconds, and said "Dude, I gotta git outta here!" Fortunately they had a guitarist/singer on the back patio with a coffee pot full of java and some cookies. How cool is that? Said musician was eventually joined by a little girl who played her clarinet. Played is being kind. Poor thing. That clarinet squeaked more than the brakes on my 95 ghetto beemer. More than Peter Brady's voice during puberty. But how cute it was. How very Bohemian. Rickie scored The Knife CD he's been looking for and the staff was VERY helpful and not all weird slacker don't bother me cuz I'm too cool to move from behind the counter cuz I just know you two queers are looking for Brittney Spears or Madonna crap and that is so lame...NO...not at all. Nicest of nice. And we were cool. Besides. I'd never heard of The Knife. That was always my nickname for OJ. And he WAS not there. Oh. Cuz he's in jail! HA HA! Anyway, I digress. Stinkweeds! Neither stinky. Nor weedy! Check it 08 my yelpitas. Love you!!!!!

Over the years, I've been in a lot of sheet metal; Ferrari, Porsche, Bentley, you name it.

I've also been fortunate enough to have driven at the Charlotte Motor Speedway when it first reopened in several different cars.  But I have no idea what to say about Tesla, except something humorless about their cars not needing a cigarette lighter.

I've seen quite a few around town. And yes, it's a very nice car but... $122K for a Model S? I'll admit there's certainly a je nes se qua to them that attracts folks.  The stock price is another story. Really.  

The showroom also seems to do a brisk business in shirts, hats, et cetera.

But I hope they survive, live long and prosper.  If only because I don't want to hear about them being an electric deLorean.

Enjoy!  If you can.

I was really impressed by this bagel option at CLT.  

Granted CLT seems to have an Einstein Bagels everywhere, but this one offers a more interesting food option.  The sandwich was very good. But I felt for the folks behind the counter who were friendly, but because it was New Years Day, looked like they were pulling a double shift.

I ordered the Turkey bagel.  It was very good, had a fair amount of meat on it and the bagel stood up to the toasting. All pluses in my book.

After a three night stay at the Cosmopolitan and three nights checking out Bond, this small bar near the LV Strip Entrance did not live up to hype. It's a-ok, but was dead all three nights except for some people gambling on machines at the bar. 

This Bond was nothing like the cool suave style of a sexy British spy. 

It was more like Double O Disappointment. Hey-yo!

We must of went during an off period because there were no DJs or dancers any of the nights. It was just a nice, clean bar. Again, it's fine, but nothing exciting or really special if there aren't dancers or DJs.

Neiman Marcus meet Salvation Army. Salvation Army meet Neiman Marcus. Nice. 

Wow. A vintage/thrift store that doesn't smell like my Aunt Helen's wig closet. No stench of mothballs, decaying bodies or stale smoke from an old pack of Capri Ultra Light Menthol 120s. 

Organized. Well staffed. Well, staffed by people who are actually engaging and interested in you. Unlike SO many other similar shops in this area where you get a little bit of "OH, you are so lucky to peruse my crap" attitude. 

Most importantly...great stuff. Vintage Italian dishware (think Fiesta with a Tuscan twist), Disney movie stills, framed, and selling for a mere Abraham and an entire case of well lit (much like myself at the time of shopping) Prada, Jimmy Choo and Minola Blanaks!! Just my luck! None in my size.

What can I say about Surrender. One of the worst club I have been to. The setting of the club sucks. Small dance floor I mean small. One bar in the back of the club. That has only 3 or 4 bartender try to make drinks for hundreds of people. Imagine the wait. The other bar was in the front near the Dj where it was blocked off for I don't know what. The service was horrible.
On the other hand I would like thank Dilpo you killed it!!! Great set!

I would rather be a freegan and dumpster dive then ever swing into the Rainforest Cafe again. I would rather eat.....
....at the worst Applebee's in America
....vending machine food
....my own flesh

Now, Rainforest could be fun if you were 12 and drunk. Then the overly fried foods and canned sauces could cure your munchies. I would have rather had Totino's pizza rolls than the nasty appetizer combo we shared. The plant and animal filled space could really use the services of Merry Maids. Really. How do you clean all that crap? 

The rainforest "thunderstorm" is as exciting as the one in the produce section at Safeway. So if you have kids who like to drink, you might have a good time here. Otherwise I say stay home and check your trash like a good freegan.

I'm reminded of a Doctor's reading of an x-ray when he comments "unremarkable" when reviewing Lucky Boy Burger Shop. I order a burger which comes with fries and a shake since they don't have free refills on their sodas. The shake was the best part of the meal. The burger was "unremarkable". The fries were meh.

I think they should just close the dining area and make it drive thru because they don't have a restroom for their customers. Meh. I've experienced better.

When my mom picked him up he was covered in paint and what looked to be chemical burns. Along with a 106 degree fever. They didn't contact our family or the vet and refused to help with any bills despite the fact this was because of their negligence.

Hit the spot... but definitely not ranked up there as a favorite.  The eggrolls were somewhat dried out!  The soup didn't have the same taste that I have come to look for in pho broth.  The service was not horrible but definitely wasn't as good as other restaurants, even though they weren't so busy when we went to visit.

They were rather stingy with paper napkins ... and water.

Been there once... and that's okay for me.

Prepare for a shift in perspective...

Too many times, Mexican food is rather typical.  In fact it's likely that, with few variances and exceptions, predictions prevail.  Not that Mexican food isn't super tasty, because it is.  It's just that it isn't usually served with much explosive flair or out-of-the-box creativity.  (I mean, we've all come to know what to expect.)  That is until you've visited the Barrio Caf.

When here, forget what you've known, what you've grown up with.

At the Barrio, Chef Silvana's sophistication and assertiveness with the culinary traditions of Mexican cuisine challenges any and all notions of south-of-the-border authenticity.  Imagine: apples, pears, dried apricots and pecans nesting harmoniously amidst savory chicken, enveloped in a roasted poblano pepper and finished with a light almond sauce, the colors of the Mexican flag (cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds) artfully decorating the myriad of flavors...

"Chiles en Nogada," as explored by Guy Fieri's "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives," is the signature dish that brought me to the artistry of the Barrio.  And it is also the "Chiles en Nogada" that has forever now changed what I thought Mexican cuisine could actually be.  Chef Silvana certainly has an eye for presentation.  To visit Barrio Caf is to appreciate that vision.

The dealers are ornery but I don't care.
Everyone says this place is run down but I don't think so.  It seems good to me, maybe a bit dated with their decor, but I'm here to gamble and get drunk.  Who cares what it looks like?
I always win so every time I'm in Vegas I come here for a bit to make me some money.

Shhhhhh! can you keep a secret?  

We stumbled upon a secret pizzeria in the new Cosmopolitan hotel.

It was 3 in the morning and we roll in jonesin for some food.
Nico was such a sweetheart, he told us stories, listened to ours, and gave us advice on life, love, and all things worldly.  He was like an elder teaching us life lessons while he kneaded dough and turned it into pizza for us!

It literally turned from this.....

Into this...in a matter of 20 minutes
                               
               . ------------.

                     \&8/
                       \*/

Great pizza, nice crust, and awesome company.  Nico hooked us up and managed to teach us about life all in 30 minutes.  He made me feel like I was in Italy and if this was his pizzeria he'd have given us the pizza for free!  Nico made our trip a memorable one.

This may be the first review that I've awoken from a deep dream of peace to write.  Ok, first I had to make a pit stop, but then it was time to pen my thoughts and aspir... ooooh hoooold on, brb...

Now, where was I.  Here's a fun fact... the human body can hold up to a quarter of its own weight in disposable fluids, whose liberation can be mobilized by Arriba's own spinach enchiladas.  Ole!

That's right, the green leafy vegetable made famous by a marble-mouthed sailor, now compels me to blow my own ballast tanks... again and again

But I have to say, this couldn't have come at a better time, with tomorrow being the inaugurate outing of my office's hiking group.  Magic 8 Ball says "Signs point to yes" that I'll collapse 27 minutes into the trek from dehydration, and possibly require professional extrication.

You know what doesn't require professional extrication?  The cauldron of dysentery brewing in my lower GI.  Spiiiicy!

But to be fair, its not all waterloo, Arriba's.  I really should thank you for lightening my load, even though I've really never felt more bloated and irritated.  *quizzical look*

And if I ever nurture the desire to tarry in your cantina, which is somewhat reminiscent of The Blue Oyster on tango night, I'll be sure not to waste the opportunity, and schedule that pesky colonoscopy for the following morning.  Osmoprep's got nutin on you, honey.

Used Creative moving about a month ago. What a great, family-run business. The guys were on time, courteous, and professional. They don't drag their feet - their goal is to get the job done right and as efficiently as possible. As a matter of fact, they came in UNDER the estimate! Not one broken item in the whole move. They carefully wrapped and padded our furniture, and took great care to avoid dinging walls, etc.
Would use Creative again in a heartbeat, and will be recommending them to everyone we know. Could not be more pleased after you hear so many negative things about other movers.

Late November...
The desert air, crisp and clean on a Sunday morning,
And I'm surrounded.
Surrounded by multiple games upon multiple screens,
Lions and Pats, Cards and Hawks.
Friends of old sitting across from one another, stories--once told,
Now again and again--flung casually about, bouncing
Here and there and here and there...
The fireplace aglow, and another on-tap round,
Orange-slice garnishings.
Cheers were in order, and the Verrado Grille,
Also relaxing in the mid-morning sun and welcoming any and all
Who have the luxury of lazy, weekend afternoons,
Hosted.

Here, you recline.

And at noontime sharp,
Our Happy Hour,
Suggestions, recommendations, libations...
Fives and sixes, listed mixes,
And fondues and sliders
And caesars and ritas.
Truffles and pretzels, wings, quesadillas...
Verrado Grille makes your stay easy.
The game's not over, however.
So stay awhile.
Enjoy
The moment and the
Smiles
Surrounding
You.

Again, upon Adam Richman's heels...  

As a continued fan of "Man vs Food" and after having bookmarked a few of Adam's noted, Phoenician eateries--Chompie's, Alice Cooper'stown, and Los Reyes de la Torta--I saddled up, traversed over 350 sun-scorched miles, and with extreme prejudice negotiated terms of surrender with a literal powerhouse of a Mexican sandwich--one piled high, layered thick, and respectfully ordained "Del Rey."

Muy delicioso!  Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, hot dogs, omelet, chorizo, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce: all hail the King!  Ok, it's true, I may be a bit biased--after all, who am I to contradict Adam?--but unwavering confidence and grandeur shoulder this reigning torta.  My job, put simply: tossing confetti.  How am I doing?  =]

The rundown:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KjOMCauQYI.  (By the way, I visited the West Indian School Rd. location, while Adam opted northward to Sunnyslope's haunt on North 7th St.)

What was even better was being treated like kings, ourselves, while we were there.  We really were.  The service was supreme!  My only regret was not taking a picture of the Elvis statue in the window!  Yes, the King himself.  But I'll get it next time.  Trust me.

Adam...lead on!

Tickety Tacky in only the best way possible.  I actually really like this place.  The neon lights reminds me of my mothers make up in the 90's.

Nick the waiter was a sweetheart.  I am ridiculous in my requests sometimes, but he managed to cater to all of them.

The portions are huge!   My steak and spinach salad was delicious!  The steak was tender and medium rare just as I requested.  I asked for candied walnuts in it and Nick brought me a bowl of them!  That's what I call service.

Late night eats in Vegas!  I'll definitely be back!

It's BRITNEY, B*TCH!!!!

Fabulous show!!!  Lights, theatrics, vivid sets, striking costumes, outrageous dance performances, smooth song transitions ... It was a very entertaining show!  Her songs alone will get you off your feet to dance, dance, dance ... So I didn't mind standing 95% of the 90-minute show.  You could sit but you wouldn't be able to see since everyone was standing and dancing, which makes for a high energy, fun show.

We all have heard it time and time again, she lip syncs her shows ... SO WHAT!!!  She's not Adele or any high caliber vocalist!!  I'm sure they're not jumping and flying all over the stage at their concerts, it's impossible to dance and sing perfectly!  So prerecorded?  I don't care!!  She's an awesome performer with beat-thrilling, ass-shaking songs!  

Btw: Sorry that douche cheated on you, Brit.  Good job dropping his @ss!!!  Demand to be cherished and nothing less!!!   You looked great, post popping out 2 kids!  Keep it up, girlie!!!

*This review is dedicated to Brandon C. for reviewing Brit's boutique http://www.yelp.com/biz/britney-spears-boutique-las-vegas?hrid=XPYdszVwVxkPiTZ2qqrLPA.  Now go watch the show!!!!  lol!

4pm check out time, at no additional cost. In Vegas? Yes, it does exist, and it exists at Trump. It's an excellent buffer after going all night long, because the thought of getting up at 10 or 11 is just plain awful. 

The bathroom is huge and includes a shower large enough to fit a party of four people (if that's your kind of thing) and a bathtub deep enough to store all your winnings. And there's a TV in the mirror in the event you want to bathe in your money and catch some prime time.

The rooms are spacious and though there's no casino to amuse you, it's walking distance from some of the more desirable entertainment locations of the strip.

Your nose will also appreciate the distinct (and pleasant) smells in the lobby and elevator.

The people complaining about the way Chars looks have no idea what a Juke Joint (or a Honky Tonk if that's your flavor.  Dive Bar if you can relate to that) is supposed to look like.  The lights are supposed to be dim.... the place is supposed to be small... The place will have a band that doesn't care if their makeup is on correctly.... the place should make you question if the walls might fall down if the music gets any louder and the dance floor should be small as JUKE JOINTS are usually kinda small!!!!!  Somebody please educate these folks on JUKE JOINTS.... Meanwhile, let me tell you about Chars.

If you're looking for absolutely NO pretentiousness, NO frills, Tables that don't cost $600, or basically the opposite of clubbing in Scottsdale .... Chars is your spot.  If you are interested in Rhythm and Blues and Soul covers and a rocking good time.... Chars is your spot.  If you are looking for a live music venue where people dance AND mingle with each other and actually speak and talk to you just because... Chars is your spot.  If you have stumbled upon my review because you are looking for a decent time.... Chars is your spot.  

 I absolutely LOVE Chars for everything that it is AND for everything that it is NOT.

Sure, you kids have got your Rain and your Pure and your Snoopy Dog parties, but in keeping with my old lady name, I prefer some of the simple elderly pleasures in life...like bingo. Okay, so maybe I went to keep my mom entertained for a couple of hours...and maybe I've accompanied my mom on many a bingo excursion before, but this was the first to Gold Coast's bingo hall...and I'm more than a fan. 

Picture this hypothetical scenario: you've already withdrawn your $300 for the day, the blackjack tables haven't treated you so well, and you're in dire need of a drink. Hypothetically, of course. Well, for a mere $10 you get unlimited booze (you don't even have to wait for the cocktail gal, you can get your free booze directly from the bar) and the chance to annoy old folks and win a few hundred bucks. 

Sadly, the bad luck wasn't shaken by an afternoon bingo session, but five vodka tonics later...I left there one happy bingo-er.

Three Birds left and pounds of Steel makes for good target practice! 

The Pittsburgh Steelers have one of the best records in football history. They have won 5 out of 42 Super Bowls. Only 3 teams have won 5 and that is the Steelers, the Cowboys and the SF 49's. Seeing the Steelers are the only one of those three in the playoffs, they could break all records this year, by winning 6 Super Bowls. IF they go to the Super Bowl again this year, it will be their 7TH appearance.

IF, is the biggest word in the English language. If my grandmother had 4 wheels, she would be a box car. 

I was not thrilled when Bill Cowher left the Steelers, but I must say Mike Tomlin has done a fine job and we were blessed, to have had two great coaches. 

I have been an avid collector of autographed sports memorabilia for many, many years. I have quite a lot of autographed Steelers merchandise, including a football jersey signed by the Steel Curtain. 

I can't help but admire that more and more each week and think of how Mean Joe Green and LC Greenwood will be watching the games, with nerves of steel and how Ernie Holmes and Mad Dog Dwight White will be smiling down upon Big Ben, Willie Parker, Hines Ward, Troy Polamalu, Harrison, Holmes and the rest of the team. 

This week the Steelers have home field advantage of a ridiculous time of 6:30 against the Ravens. The Ravens play hard and rough and my fingers are crossed that we beat them for a third time this year. 

Everyone is thinking of how great it would be to have a PA. Super Bowl. I went to Heinz Field for the 2004 Eagles/Steelers game. I drove from Philadelphia along with Eagles Fans galore. We won and it was an awesome ride home. 

GO STEELERS!! You rock my world! Give me one for the other hand!

Yep. David B. Once again the wise sage atop Mount Yelp. I called another locksmith who never returned my call. I called Stagecoach and they said they could help me tomorrow. That's cool. I had a safe in my office and the batteries died and I was unable to open the safe. But you have to open the safe to put in new batteries. Suckky I know! Stagecoach called back and said they can be here in an hour. YEE HAW! Stagecoach to the rescue. I expected a horse and buggy with a rugged Michael Landon (post bed wetting problem, pre Little House on the Prairie...c'mon he was a hottie!) to pull into my parking lot and save the day. Well. That didn't happen. On accounta he's dead. But it was a man named Dean. Lean, mean Dean! No. Not mean at all. He fixed my safe. Installed new batteries at no charge. Yep. Free. Last time I got free batteries was at Castle Boutique when I bought a...oh...wait...my mom reads these reviews. Anyhoo. You got key issues. Lock is jammed. Or your office safe is on the fritz. Get out your ole rotary phone and give Stagecoach a holler!

A group of us came here for breakfast and really enjoyed D'lish.

We ordered their drip coffee and some bagels and found everything tasty.  The coffee was strong and HOT! If water boils at 212F, then D'lish serves it at 210F LOL  What was great about it?  It wasn't over roasted and burnt like the Green Mermaid.  Actually the three of us enjoyed our conversation waiting for it to cool.

The bagels were another surprise.  Given the small space of D'lish's building, I would love to find out where the get them.  My suspicion would be NY Bagel on Scottsdale Road, up near Shea Blvd.  But no matter, they were very good and hit the spot.

We'll be back for lunch.

I recently ventured into Filiberto's for the first time a few months ago. My wife was buying breakfast for her office (going green and car pooling), apparently her office staff loves this stuff. So I said I might as well try a burrito myself. My only problem was that I heard these burritos were only good if you're shitfaced or pretty close to it. 

I ordered the sausage burrito. I opened it up and saw all the gooey greasiness of it and ate most of the sausage and egg in the burrito, but not the tortilla. It was okay to stem my hunger pangs but definitely not my go to breakfast spot. My only regret was that I wasn't there at two O'Clock in the morning listening to the stumbling drunken orders at the drive up.

If you like less than mediocre food while porn is being thrown in your face, you'll find it here.  Seriously.

We never would have gone in here if we had any idea.  Seriously.

Corporate Suits in town wanted to take a few folks from my office to lunch and chose this place.  There's an hour of my life I'll never get back.  Seriously.

This place makes Hooters look very upscale and classy.  Seriously.  

And the food.  Huge burgers and fries are the only choices.  The burgers?  Think Encore Frozen Salisbury Steaks on a bun.  Seriously.

We left with the unanimous agreement that none of us would ever see the inside of this place again.  

Seriously.

You don't know how much I love you,
You don't know how much I care.

This review is way old but since I'm sick and have nothing better to do than stare at my feet and feel like crap I thought I'd catch up on old reviews before they are erased from memory.

Happy Hour is where its at son!
1/2 off Steaks (and a gnocchi I just couldn't pass up)

The vibe is straight up sexy, (I never use that word because I feel awkward saying it out loud) but its just dark, sultry and sleek and straight out of an old-school movie.  

The specialty cocktails are divine, the bartenders take their time and they know wassup.  Quality drinks cost money, but oh what a way to burn.

This is a nice casual place to get some fish. They cook it up anyway you want it (cue Journey), whether it be fried, grilled, blackened, etc.

I have ordered the Taco Mountain every time I've been there. You have a choice of other types of meat besides fish. I always go for the fish. I find that the fish is always fresh and cooked just right. The next time I go in there I'll have to order something different. Pro Tip - This place is a zoo during Fridays when Lent is in season. When you can't find a parking spot, you might as well go with Plan B.

What happened to you, Rain!? You're like a celebrity, once glamorous and incredibly popular, but that has fallen into obscurity. You used to be the posh spot, the happenin' talk of the town... but now you're overused, dirty, discarded. 

This review is long overdue and almost joined Rain by also falling into obscurity.

The layout is still cool, the music still poppin', but never in my life have I come across SO MANY ROAMING HANDS in one place. How shady can a place be such that at least 75% of the male population is trying to violate the females?!? I'd be dancing and suddenly a hand had appeared up my skirt and all the way up my thigh. I immediately moved away and noticed my lady friends were undergoing the same horror from other men. 

I was uncomfortable on the dance floor, and that NEVER happens. I love to dance and meet people and have a great time, but I'm not about to put myself out there for THAT. Gross!

Let's just say I won't be back. Ever. Unless they have a successful Perv Purge movement.

DATE TIP: Fellas, let me break it down for you. Women typically don't appreciate random hands up their skirts. At least buy them a drink first! Ha.

The house of Petrossian is known world wide for one thing; CAVIAR.  Before you jump down my throat, Petrossian only sells farm raised or sustainable caviar.

Hidden in plain sight off the Bellagio lobby.  Masked as a place to get a quick drink or take high tea while listening to live piano music.  No, no.  Ignore the distractions, stay focused on the prize.

Glassy green gray pearls shimmering with highlights of gold atop a mother of pearl spoon.  Delivery, then; the nutty flavor burst forth, a hint of yolky goodness, a creaminess coats the palate all finishing in a slightly briny oceanic wash.  A sip of chilled vodka to erase the flavor and begin the enjoyment all over again.

The caviar service comes complete with chopped egg whites, yolks, crme fraiche, onions, chives, and blinis but seriously, there is no better way to enjoy this treat than dive-bombing.  Extreme quality and freshness.

Want to learn about caviar and vodka pairings?  Try the three caviars (Royal Ossetra, Royal Transmontanus and Royal Siberian), three vodka tasting (Ciroc, Chopin, Level).  At $105, the tasting is a great way to sample the different flavors.

A dozen vodkas and a good selection of champagne if you must.  Vegas resort pricing.

Note: From Petrossian's website, a description of the flavors and types of caviar offered:  http://www.petrossian.com/caviar-1.html

"Champagne wishes and caviar dreams", maybe but then again consider, there are only three materials suitable for making caviar spoons:  24k gold, mother of pearl, and plastic.  Cheers!

Just moved into the area and went to this location. It was so busy but staff was very helpful as I'm not used to this store and couldn't find the things I usually get. One time I went to another store and there was a demo of waffles with pomegranate seeds and yoghurt on it.  At this store there was a  sample with Belgian waffles, strawberries, and whipped cream...delicious!  So I bought the waffles and they were so cheap! I also love their Mediterranean feast meal. They have so many different items and prices are very reasonable. I find that I go to Trader Joe's a lot because of the variety of products and the atmosphere. I highly recommend Trader Joe's.

Ok. So I've never actually been to Two Hippies BHOTAB...but I'm going to review it anyway. JUST KIDDING! I've had take out but someone else has always picked it up for me. You know. I have people for that. First off I must say for bong sake you have the longest restaurant name evah! Secondly I must say your pork tacos really hit the spot. Granted one side of the tortilla becomes a bit slimy by the time it reaches me (from my people) and the foil is unwrapped (again, my people) and I finally plunge that delicious hippie taco into my boca. The pork is moist (ewww, i don't usually say moist...OMG...I said it twice) and a little crunchy in parts. Perfection. Seasoned with love. Like a good hippie. A few beans, cabbage, cheese and tomatoes thrown in and I'm happier than a hippie at a Patchouli sale. Or happier than a hippie in a muraled van selling incense and bongs on Venice Beach. Or happier than....oh...you get the idea. All this love for under $2 a taco. Now I know why you are Outgrageous! I may tye dye a t shirt, get out the Nag Champa and pop in Dazed and Confused. Now. Damnit. Where is that bag of Doritos?

Okay, while I love Chris and I love his product I despise their group reservation policy. We called weeks ago for a reservation for 9 towards the end of May, they told me that we need to call one month to the date at 5 o'clock.. so today that call was made at 5 o'clock, the stupid matter of factly bitch told me that the reservations were gone at 4:30.. okay, if you're going to fuck around with the way you do things that's one thing, but being a dumb bitch about it is completely another. 

I think I'm finally over my love for this place.. I mean 3 weeks ago we showed up and was told the wait was 4.5 hours.. I don't wait that long for pizza.. while his pizza is great, its just fucking pizza.

Advice: get a bigger place!!

I visited Al-Hana for the first time today for an Unofficial Yelp Event with Rand H., Robyn N., Mike C., Jackie C. and the other Jon H. I enjoyed some great Hummus and Pita Bread plus my main course of Lamb Kafta for $8.99 and a can of soda for $.099; this meal set me back $10.75 today.

Prior to arriving, I perused some reviews and the menu. Pro Tip - this place is not located in the ghetto as some reviewers have mentioned. I did not have to use any of my martial arts training to get into and out of the restaurant. There was decent parking at about 11:10 when I got there. 

As I'm writing this review 4 hours later, I can tell you that I'm still stuffed. I really enjoyed my food along with conversations with my awesome lunch companions. Thanks to Rand for "inviting" me. I probably would have not tried this place otherwise.

From Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich comes an authentic, contemporary Italian restaurant.  It's good! 

This is not your "we import everything from Italy so we are an Italian restaurant", nor is it "I use my mamma's recipes and she was Italian so this is authentic".  B&B creates classic Italian flavors using what is available seasonally, in the area.  From fresh herbs and produce to house cured salumi, it all goes into creating outstanding authentic food.

Antipasti features a simple but perfect braised tripe alla Romana.  Tender, with no off smell.  Vibrant acidity from the tomatoes add a nice foil to the mildly flavored tripe.  Perfect.  The grilled octopus, heaven.  Toothsome with a charred bitter edge that contrast well with the sweet, spicy, sour limoncello vinaigrette.  The lemony perfume is heady.  Sensory overload on a single plate.

Prima focuses around perfectly cooked, authentic pastas.  The bucatini all'Amatriciana is near Roman perfect.  Fatty, porky goodness of guanchale, bright acidity from pured tomatoes, a zing of acidity from some wine, lightly spiced and finished with pecorino cheese.  If that's too simple, the bone marrow ravioli is to die for.  Rich unctuous goodness surrounded by thin pasta bathed in a veal shank ragu that must have simmered all day.

Secondi proteins are different (lamb, rabbit, quail).  Experiment.  The deep fried sweetbreads, Win.   Crisp on the outside, pillowy on the inside; they pair perfectly with the sweet sour balsamic glazed cippolinis and the sweet bitterness of charred corn.  Don't think about what you're eating and you should be OK.

Massive Italian centric wine list representing DOC / DOCG throughout the country.  Good vintage depth for super Tuscans.  Vegas resort prices.

True Italian service, friendly with great pride taken in what they do.

"You can make the reservation, but you cannot hold the reservation."

Here with a bachelor party last Saturday night and we had a table reservation for the crew. We got there at 10:30pm and they told us we we were too late (claimed we had to be there by 10pm) and they had given our table away. After some bickering they let us in and we found that half the tables in the club were unoccupied and they were most definitely not sold out. 

With some pushing we eventually claimed a table and the night was saved. My poor friend who organized this part of the bachelor party weekend definitely lost a few hairs from the stress of the table initially falling through.

XS charges way too much money to screw up like that, so even though it's one of my favorite party spots in Vegas they only get 3 stars.

I would give them negative stars if it was possible! One star is WAY TO GRACIOUS! HAD A HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE WITH TIVEGAS! 

Upon coming back to our room after a wedding last night we found a disturbing man leaving OUR ROOM with a bag full of all our valuables!!! After confronting him, the crazed man grabbed my husband by the throat and ran through the SERVICE ELEVATOR ROOM, using the SERVICE ELEVATOR to escape! Those elevators have to have keys and the hotel receptionist said she has worked there 9 years and doesn't know how to work those elevators!! SKETCHY!!! 

On top of the terror, security was sluggish and ON OUR FLOOR witnessing the attack and did NOT RUN, they walked, strolled even, over to us allowing the man to escape and offering only to write a report "IF WE WANTED TO". Security then proceeded to try to persuade us to NOT FILE A POLICE REPORT!!! SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS SECURITY SYSTEM?! Isn't safety supposed to be the most important??? I don't think TI Vegas has that priority AT ALL. 

And to ice this cake of a stay, TI VEGAS Risk Management NEVER filed a note or report to hotel staff/management to inform them of the breach of safety, as well as REFUSED to compensate for the room for our stay. UNREAL, never ever coming back and you are all warned!

This is my favorite store in the entire valley. So many new things to look at everytime you enter the store, the staff is so friendly, trade in prices are fair and I love their cafe. Grab a book and a coffee or a sandwich and relax on a couch. I go there for my expanding video game collection as well and every time I go in there is so much new inventory I feel like its a whole new store to dig through. Check this place out. The classic nick nacks alone is enough reason to pop in and look around. There is absolutely something for everyone.

Well of course you're named after a Saint. After all, you are simply heavenly! I LOVED my visit to St. Francis. Just like I loved the first year of Charlie's Angels when Farrah was on. Just like I loved Chachi and not Joanie. Just like I love smooth and not chunky. I was honored to have a tour of St. Francis by Mr. Aaron Chamberlain himself. He pointed out the architectural details and history of his career. Right down to family serving spoons used in his grandparents restaurant embedded in to the brick near the front door. The sleek, glass garage door which opens up to Camelback. If you're sitting outside you have a panoramic view of the interior and if you're inside you get a bird's eye view of the street scape. 

The second story (which is in limbo and awaiting a mural and a more defined purpose) is structurally held in place by a "V" shaped collection of steel rods...unfreakinreal! The birch floors on the stairs, the gravel on the patio, the maple beams, the seemless glass front table...I'm having an interior design orgasm! 

Oh. The food? Yep! Yummers! Thin crust pizzas with a airy, pillow crust...tried an arrugula za and had one with figs! The signature salad with a homemade buttermilk dressing (DON'T THINK RANCH!)...it's so much more and the goat cheese brulee made my mouth, my tummy and my soul very happy! You can feel the love from the kitchen as well as an attentive, enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff.

You're like my foodie angel, arriving in CenPho to save fme rom Applebee's and Sweet Tomatoes! I say Halo St. Francis. Halo and welcome to the hood!

Yet another really good burger option for the Chandler/101 area!

Over the last few months we've gotten a Smash Burger and now a Burger21 last week. If UR into red meat, how can you go wrong?

I came here to grab something for a late night at the office and Burger21 hit the roof of my flavortown mouth. Sorry Fieri!  LOL

I kept it simple. The cardiac arrest Blue Cheese and Bacon burger for only $7.95 and a Chocolate Malt ($4.95) to wash it down. Both were good. 

Expect to pay $12 or so, if you order a soft drink. Don't  those iced cold beers looked good? There's a real high probably I'll be back with some co-workers real soon.

Comme Ca translates as not poorly or not bad ... and that's exactly what Comme Ca restaurant at The Cosmopolitan is ... not too bad.

The restaurant was empty and bar quiet when we popped in for some Happy Hour drinks and appetizers. Service was quick cause, seriously, there wasn't many other patrons.

Select cocktails are $7.50 during Happy Hour. I tried two. The Penicillin Cocktail with Scotch, Ginger, Lemon Juice, Honey, and an Islet Float was sweet and smooth. It could of used another 1/2 ounce of whiskey, but was fine. The lone vodka HH option is a cocktail called Fair Trade with Lemon and Simple Syrup. It was fair.

For nibbles, Olivia Z. and me split an order of the Grilled Beef Tongue ($6). The side of Lemon Aioli and sprinkles of Sea Salt really meshed well with the tender slices of tongue. We both liked it a lot even though the slices were a tad too thick. Oysters on the Half Shell are $2 each during Happy Hour. We got six with two different kinds. I forget the names, but one Pacific Ocean and the other was Atlantic. The Pacific were smaller, but better.

When it comes to Comme Ca for Happy Hour, it is kind of comme si comme ca.

I saw the fishbowl and I knew right away I was in.  
They hypnotize you 
They seduce you, every act more titillating than the next
They make you sell your soul to the man next to you
You forget everything
You wake up and the next moment you're sitting in a vat of writhing bodies
Will you obey?

I'm sore.  I guess that means I did.

PS- If you're looking for a conservative show, this probably isn't for you and your family.  But the crude humor, the scantily clad muscled men (wrap him up i'll take him to go) and barely there women.  This was definitely my kinda show.  Crazy moves, random stunts, perverted jokes...This was definitely perfect for me.

Don't get seats in the front rows if you don't want to be called on.  :)

Sorry to ruin the party concerning the high Yelp rating for this company, but this is my story. 

I called these guys and we agreed that they would come over to my house at 4pm for a regular service call. So I took off some time from the office to meet them at my house. I called them at 4:10pm and asked them what was going on, I had to leave a message. After a few minutes, they called me back and said they didn't have a technician near my house since they were in other parts of the valley so we would have to reschedule. WTF?

I rescheduled for the next week and while they called me about 15 minutes before the scheduled appointment, I told them that I was in another part of the valley and couldn't make the appointment. I then continued with my awesome lunch.

You want some bread to go with that cheese?

I'm immediately reminded of Chuck E.  Cheese, The Country Bears etc.

Cheap animatronics with some fire & water thrown in for spectacle, Fall of Atlantis is a free attraction located in the Forum Shops of Caesar's Palace.  King Atlas has to decide upon who his replacement should be to the  throne, his daughter who has special water effects, or his son who contributes the pyrotechnics.  Gods itervene & have some choice words for King Atlas & his offspring.  The climax brings about a dragon who lays the smackdown on all the Atlanteans & lays waste to Atlantis
http://www.vegas.com/attractions/on-the-strip/caesars-atlantis-fountain/

I know it's free, but I feel like the Fall of Atlantis cheapens the "baller" atmosphere of Caesar's Forum Shops.  I mean, with Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Louis Vuitton and Ferragamo attracting the rich clientele, you'd think there would be something more worthy of the demographic?  To me, the best part of the Fall of Atlantis is the large aquarium, with rays, puffers and other assorted marine creatures.  Of course, I grew up on Jacques Cousteau, so I'll always be partial to the sea ;p

Fall of Atlantis shows at the top of the hour, every hour, starting at 11am.  

I suppose if you were slurring your speech & crap-faced drunk, this show would be more entertaining.  All in all, I say let the tourists watch this lame spectacle of out-dated robotics & head over to something more worthy of your time, like the Bellagio fountains or one of the buffets.

1300+ reviews don't lie. This place is quite delicious. 

Why the one star? Because I ate here on Tuesday 4/23 and started having food poisoning symptoms two days later. It's been five days and I'm still in pain and have lost 13 pounds due to so much water loss. I had to visit the ER yesterday for dehydration. After multiple complaints from other patrons, Firefly was shut down today for a health inspection. 

However, this is not the first time I became ill after eating here. A couple years ago, I had their fish sticks and started violently vomiting soon after. After some time, I decided to give this place another chance. Everything was good...until now. 

It's such a shame because Firefly has delicious tapas and drinks. This was my go-to place for a long time. But apparently staff members aren't keeping clean and washing their hands or they're not handling their food properly.

I've already given this place a second chance. A third chance? I highly doubt it. Eat here at your own risk.

I had my first taste of Firehouse Subs today and decided to go with the Beef & Cheddar eight inch sandwich with a large Diet Dr. Pepper from their fabulous soda machine. That machine kind of reminds me of Rodney Dangerfield's character in the Caddyshack where he had that golf bag that played music, so versatile just like the soda machine delivering many different types of sodas. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3A9rLoz_0o

The Beef and Cheddar sandwich comes with bbq sauce and mayo. I got it without the mayo and it tasted fabulous. The only problem was that I felt a little hungry after eating it. So there's the rub, an excellent tasting meal with just a little bit of meat. Five stars for taste but one star for not putting out my 5 alarm hunger pangs.

The Showroom is located at 951 Wigwam Pkwy Henderson, NV. That's just off of 215 and the Gibson exit. Its kinda hard to find if you're not paying attention.

The showroom is really well setup and they have rocks and more rocks. flagstone, stones, gravel, soils and just about any landscape design info you could need. Way better than big box stores as they're locally owned and know the desert landscape and the best options.

Plus you can go to their website and see lots of rock examples and measuring tech info. Also they have a sister company that is Nevada outdoor Living with BBQ island and equipment, higher end patio furniture, waterfalls, statues, fire pits and more.
 
Prices seem high on the patio items and BBQ options but they mostly high end quality stuff that costs a little more. We got a deal on a small set and were happy. The rock options for the yard are still in the making but the prices are right and they deliver.

Staff was friendly and very helpful.

You will get a bunch of good ideas for your landscape dreams. Go in and check it out.

Not absolutely sure if this is the first business of this business model to open in the 702, but I am absolutely sure that it is the newest and only business of this kind currently in operation.

Cafe Teaze is what I would considered a hybrid business model combining a boba tea shop and a Vietnamese coffee shop (just Google or Bing it if you want to know more).  Specifically, the menu is what you would normally find at a boba tea house in California and the waitstaff are all bikini or lingerie clad women. The best part for me and I am sure for the target market is that these waitstaff are friendly and beautiful, and could easily transition from serving you boba milk tea to fitting right in at import model photo shoots.

What can you order here?  11 types of milk teas (from the simple milk tea to Ma-Cha Ice Cream Milk Green Tea with or without boba), 5 different iced flavor teas (Lychee Green Tea and Passion Fruit Black Tea are what look the most appealing to me right off the bat), 6 varieties of Flavored Snow Ice, 5 hot milk tea options and 9 snacks (popcorn chicken, fried wontons, and spiral potato just to rattle off a few).

Let's be frank here, even if your name is not Frank or Francis Underwood, I am here first and foremost for the eye candy, without getting hassle for doing the looking. That reality is what the proprietor is relying on in attracting new customers. However, the beverage and food are what the owners are banking on for lots and lots of repeat business after the novelty wears off a bit.

For me hopefully the novelty will never wear off :)

So kids, if you've been following along at home, you know Uncle Georgie thinks most fast food places can only strive for a 3 Star rating or worst. 

Uniformity at fast good places in my opinion make it impossible to offer a Four Star, or Eccck... a Five Star rating. Sorry, Yum Brands!  

But this isn't a ghetto location and the employees aren't brain dead. On the contrary, they're all very nice and friendly. Especially Mallory up front and Becky the Manager who went out of their way. Nice!

As for the food, it's okay. The Tacos were good, as for the cheese Pizza Hut pizza, while being slightly undercooked it was also A-Okay. 

BTW, I had no problems getting a cup for water. So that must have been an isolated incident the other reviewers had on their visit. 

So Three Stars, A-Okay

SLS = STAY THE F*CK AWAY

What, the acronym doesn't match? Well, it doesn't f*cking matter, because you should avoid this place like the f*cking plague.

Here is a (too long) list of things that went wrong during our less-than-48-hours stay:

1. The elevator in the attached parking structure broke down TWICE for extended periods of time.

2. LiFE Nightclub didn't let anyone in until about 11:30 Friday night despite a HUGE line outside because of an isolated power outage.

3. THERE WAS NO HOT WATER FOR AT LEAST 6 HOURS ON ONE OF THE NIGHTS. THIS IS THE MIDDLE OF F*CKING VEGAS WINTER AND YOU HAVE NO HOT WATER?! SERIOUSLY?!

4. Despite all of the above, it still took me and my dad hours of bitch-mayhem at the front desk to get our ridiculous $28/night resort fee waived.

5. Housekeeping was EXTREMELY cheap. Used up toiletries were NOT replaced the second day.

I would give this place zero stars if Yelp allowed it. But since I'm forced to give it at least one star, I will say that the hotel rooms do have cool illuminated infinity mirrors. But that's it.

Where other companies implode old hotels and rebuild something new and magnificent, SBE only slightly remodeled the old Sahara.

NEVER AGAIN.

I was scheduled to fly to Las Vegas on January 5, 2014, however, my Newark Delta flight via Detroit was cancelled due to the weather. The earliest flight I could get to Vegas was two days later from JFK on January 7. My original hotel stay was at the Planet Hollywood, but, because my arrival was delayed I had to find an alternative hotel.

I found the Quad, which was the former Imperial Palace on the strip. I never stayed here but, as a Total Rewards member their last minute room pricing was the most reasonable so I reserved a room. Big mistake.

When I arrived I found the taxi had to drop me off at the rear of the hotel due to the hotel construction still going on. I noticed a lot of young people checking into the Quad I guess due to the low room cost. My check-in was smooth. As you can see from my room pics, my room was ok, which was fine. 

My only complaint about this hotel is the construction going on in and around the hotel. Some areas of the hotel are still well worn. The hotel location is fine between Harrah's and across the street from Ceasar's Palace.

See the pics of my TR1724 room, which I paid $136 for the first night and $169 for the second night in early January 2014.

I would probably not return here. I much prefer Planet Hollywood or any of the other strip hotels, which do cost a little more.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 40/100

Quite a pleasure to see while visiting Vegas! There is a huge lake in front of the Bellagio hotel, which is where the water fountain show takes place every 15-30 minutes. My boyfriend and I recently watched it this past weekend and it was wonderful! The particular show we watched was played along to the song, "All That Jazz." 

As much as I loved watching these fountains, I still think that I wasn't as impressed as I could have been. I've watched World Of Color at California Adventure in Anaheim, CA, and I think that World Of Color is MUCH more impressive than the Fountains of Bellagio. Don't get me wrong, the Bellagio fountains are great and definitely the landmark on the strip, BUT they aren't the best I've ever seen.

Located between Binions and the Golden Nugget on four blocks of downtown Las Vegas is one of best marketing efforts this part of town has enjoyed in decades ... the Fremont Street Experience.

Fremont Street is covered in a long canopy called Viva Vision with 12 million lights and 550,000 watts of sound entertaining tourists with short free light and music shows every evening on the hour.

Current Schedule (Changes regularly)
  7:00 pm: American Freedom 2 (Fri/Sat. only)
  8:00 pm: Heart - Crazy on Vegas
  9:00 pm: Bon Jovi - Wanted in Vegas
10:00 pm: The Who - Miles over Vegas
11:00 pm: The Doors - Strange Days
12:00 am: JVH - Signs of Life
  1:00 am: A Tribute to Queen (Fri/Sat. only)

Along Fremont Street, you'll find 10 classic (old) casinos with dozens of restaurants and lots of cheap gambling opportunities compared to most casinos on the Las Vegas Strip. This historic street is where gaming began in Nevada in 1931 besides being the first paved street in the city or first street with a traffic light.

The Fremont Street Experience began in 1995 with the closure of the street to form a 7-block outdoor mall. It was obviously enhanced with Viva Vision 10 years ago.  What's next? Who knows .. a holographic Elvis, Michael Jackson, and Frank Sinatra trio?

When you bore of the fun options on the LV Strip, simply want to enjoy some free entertainment, or need to find a casino with lower minimum tables and slot machines, then Fremont Street Experience is waiting in historic downtown Las Vegas, Nevada.

For my birthday weekend, I simply could not refuse an all inclusive triple threat package offered by the esteemed Wynn resort, which included complimentary tickets to Le Reve, room upgrades at the hipper and edgier Encore suites, VIP access to XS and free buffet! I know, It was pretty much a no-brainer in my book.  

Upon arrival at the Encore, parking was a breeze! Complimentary valet had me out of my car and in the registration line in a snap! Speaking of registration, I was convinced to "upgrade" my existing upgrade to a 60th floor panoramic suite. I know, I'm weak, but i'm glad I gave in! The upgraded room was magnificent! It came with an expansive living space with two plush queen beds, large bath with shower and separate soaking tub and outstanding views of the Las Vegas strip!  And who can forget about the remote controlled curtains and bathroom TV ;)  Tack on top of that premium gaming options, the exquisite resort grounds, and exceptional dining options, which include sumptuous tapas at La Cave and spectacular brunch fare at Tableau, and you've got yourself one happy birthday boy!   VIP access to the hottest clubs on the strip like XS and Surrender and premium shopping at premier boutiques like Herms, Chopard & Louis Vuitton doesn't hurt either.  If golfing is your thing, Steve Wynn's got the largest 18 hole golf course on the Strip!  

Honestly, I practically spent my entire weekend here and rarely felt the need to ever leave the grounds. Now that's not an easy feat for any resort given all the tempting hotel and entertainment options out there!  

Happy Times!

Up until this past week it's been about four years since I've been to Corleone's. My wife ordered a chicken sandwich which she loved. So that was a major hurdle to satisfy the picky eater in the family.

 I had the sausage, greenpeppers and onions with the marinara sauce. Since I've been minimizing my consumption of bread lately, I just ate everything except the bun. The presentation of the meal is pretty impressive when you look at two large buns filled with stuff. But when you get into the meat of the meal you find that there's a lot more bun than meat. I have to say that I enjoyed the meal but thought the ratio of meat to bun was pretty weak.

I say this place is Yelped correctly at 3 1/2 stars.

The newest kid on the strip is still the sexiest!

Yup, as soon as you walk into the lobby, you are invited in with the allure of large glass columns with ever changing themes. Chic mirrors and chandeliers dripping with crystals from the ceiling and everything around you just seems to sparkle with a sleek, sexy flare that is all Vegas. 

I checked in for the July 4th weekend and got up sold by a very aggressive front desk clerk that insisted on getting me into the penthouse.  I settled for a 910sq. ft. angle suite on the 58th floor with additional Japanese soaking tub, terrace with a view of the Bellagio fountains, kitchenette with fridge & microwave and an additional full sized bath with shower. Not too shabby.   

The room I must say was very spacious, the view off the expansive terrace was breathtaking and i used the soaking tub practically every night after the clubs so it worked out great!

My only complaint was with housekeeping.  There's a circular red paper note you're supposed to leave on the bed to have your linens changed, which i did but every night i came back to the room, my sheets were done but not changed! It was ridonkulous! Even the dirty pillow that had some sketchy black skid mark smeared on it (that i never used from day one) remained in my room til the last day i was there....nuts!

Perhaps all the smoke and mirrors at the entrance lobby had me blinded by the hotel's sexy charm but with all due respect, my stay was very enjoyable and despite the minor flaws, I had a fantastic time... 

With that said, the hotel was conveniently located in the heart of the strip. It's steps away from the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood and Paris...and the Sahra Spa, brunch and pool were very enjoyable...and partying at the Marquee & Bond was priceless!


Happy Times!

Gorgeous pool where the mermaids play. It's such an idyllic setting with the cascading waterfalls and calm waters. Add an alcoholic beverage to complete the picture and you're all set. Relax in this beautiful scene or meet some fun people to party with. Anything's fair game in Vegas, after all!

There are plenty of lounge chairs if you just want to kick back and recover from a long night. Grab a towel and catch some sun. Make sure to wear sunblock anytime you're outside in Las Vegas. The desert sun will own you. Guaranteed.

If you've napped long enough, take your drink with you into the pool and meet some highly interesting folks. You know how it is. When everyone's drinking, anyone can become your new friend.

So whether you're seeking the water nymph of your dreams or just have some fun, this is the place to be!

DATE TIP: The huge waterfall may *seem* like a nice romantic idea, but it's NOT romantic to piggyback someone right under the waterfall's force and just stand there forever. Once you get to the other side though, it becomes a private oasis.

Stone Crabs ... We came to Joe's for the famous Stone Crabs ..., but they didn't have any. Why? Only Joe's knows. We should of left.

Unfortunately, Joe's was already our second choice of the night (after seeing the long line at Bacchanal) and we weren't going in search of a 3rd restaurant. We were hungry, so, let's eat at Joe's.

Luckily, the other food was pretty tasty. We started with some glasses of inexpensive Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon and a Colossal Lump Crab Cake ($17). I liked the big bits of crab that didn't require (or have) much other seasoning (4 stars). 

Equally, the Chilean Sea Bass with Miso Glaze & Bok Choy ($37) and 20 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye Steak ($53) were 4-star entrees. The sea bass was flaky and the miso subtle. Meanwhile, the juicy and tender rib eye was meaty despite not being an elite steak. As a side, we split a creamy Wild Mushroom Mac and Cheese ($11) that excited thanks to the mushrooms and disappointed with lame cheese (3 stars).

Sadly, the service was weak. We suffered long gaps between being seated, ordering, getting food, or service. We wanted to try the acclaimed Key Lime Pie, but chose to try a different place at the Forum Shops at Caesars rather than put up with the poor service.

Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab is famous in Miami for fantastic Stone Crabs and Key Lime Pie. We didn't get to try either. Instead, Joe's became a basic Joe Schmo steak and seafood chain with high prices for the average Joe.

I think my friends secretly hate me...I'll give the good, the drinks are pretty damn good. Some really nice eye candy.

The bad why is it so sticky??? I'm hoping spilled drinks and not body fluids......I understand college bar but ladies have some class as much as I love the hot outfits seriously pick a person not 8. I did actually buy 2 guys drinks for having the dirtiest pick up lines. I agree on other reviews if your're looking for a STD, maybe roofied this is the club for you.

Love the music.
Love the entertainer.
Didn't love the performance.

Michael Jackson One reminded me how much I love Michael Jackson music and also reminded me how much I miss the entertainer that he was.

This Cirque du Soleil show was still very good ... less because of the "story" or "acts" and more for the pure joy, inspiration, and energy hearing Michael Jackson songs brings. Actually the story of 4 misfits searching for the white glove, shoes, hat, and sunglasses of MJ was downright silly. I really didn't care for Shy or Clumsy (the other two are called Sneaky and Smarty Pants). Less of them and more of the music could of made Michael Jackson One a 5-star experience truly worthy of the $155/ticket (plus additional Ticketmaster fees).

A few highlights:

 * A hologram of Michael Jackson dancing to "Man in the Mirror" was like watching a cool movie of Michael up close. 

 * The "Bad" performance brings back memories of break dancing ...

 * "Billie Jean" features dancers in multicolored lit suits and acrobats around the theater.

 * "Thriller" filled with trampolines and zombies was ok.

 * More than once, the show shares messages of hope and equality ... especially during "They Don't Care About Us."

 * "Smooth Criminal" may of been my favorite ... because I love the song and the "lean"

Some of the songs were:

 - Beat It
 - Leave Me Alone
 - Bad
 - Smooth Criminal
 - I'll Be There
 - Human Nature
 - Jam
 - They Don't Care About Us
 - Earth Song
 - Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'
 - The Way You Make Me Feel
 - Dangerous
 - Dirty Diana
 - Workin' Day and Night
 - Billie Jean
 - Thriller
- I Just Can't Stop Loving You
 - Man in the Mirror
 - Can You Feel It
 - Black or White
 - Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough

Those are some memorable tunes ... Forget about all the distractions and story. 

      Go for your love of the music. 
      Go for your love of the entertainer. 
      Remember how much you miss Michael Jackson.

I've been awaiting a great eatery to replace the now defunct Chandler BBQ Company, and the wait was worth it.

I've had both the meat tortellini with bolognese and the marscapone with butternut squash ravioli, both made from scratch, both delightful.  I have huge expectations for their artichoke parmesan.  The restaurant does have a Facebook page when you can come and get a little extra info.  It's quaint and cute on the inside (seats 16) and they have a nice sized outdoor patio with ample seating, for al fresco dining.

The chef, Carlo, is friendly and excited for you to try his creations.  They have a chalkboard menu behind the counter, where you'll place your order, and a deli case with meats, cheeses and olives... soon to include desserts.

They offer hot and cold sandwiches, salads, pasta (with your choice of six sauces), and a few side dishes.  The beverage options include a fountain station.

Stop by for lunch or dinner.  Stay for the ambiance or get it to-go!

Carrot Top elicits such a negative knee jerk reaction from so many.  It's like asking people at a pizza joint if they want anchovies.  When was the last time you actually had anchovies??  The guy has been a Vegas headliner since 2005.  There's got to be a reason why he's been able to stick it out on the strip and fill seats in that theater for the long haul while so many headline comedians have come and gone.  One year they're at the Excalibur, then The Plaza and then there's their one way ticket to Laughlin. 

I didn't think I would enjoy the show as much as I did.  He opened the show at a frenetic pace going from prop joke to prop joke.  Didn't think the joke was funny?  No problem!  There's another one in 5 seconds.  It was like watching the biggest 5 year old wise ass with A.D.D. show off his box of toys.  Freakin hilarious!!  The rest of the show was just as great.  You'll definitely laugh a lot and have a fun time unless you don't laugh at cock jokes.  So yeah....eunuchs may be sensitive to Carrot Top. 

We sat in the second to last row.  There's not a bad seat in the house.  You can purchase the cheapest seats without hesitation if you're still skeptical.

If I could give Green Acre Dog Boarding no stars...I would.  Stay away from this dog boarding facility.  It appears that Yelp has been removing ALL of the negative reviews that this place has had, and I this facility is STILL taking in animals despite what happened two weeks ago (and Yelp saying they are closed).  Four of my five dogs died while under the care of this boarding facility.  I was "promised" that no more than ten dogs would be cared for at a time.  When we dropped our dogs off, there was only two "larger" dogs and about four small dogs at their house.  My dogs ran around the yard, and seemed to be OK.  We were going out of town for two funerals, and our five dogs (English Bulldog puppy, Manchester Terrier, Pit Bull, Great Dane, and rescue dog) were to stay at their facility for about ten days.  I received a call very late at night that four of our dogs had ran away and died from heat exhaustion (one of which being a six month old puppy and one being a 12 year old blind/deaf dog).  I later found out that my four "furry children" were only four of the twenty-some dogs that died under their care, and i was lied to...they did not run away; they were neglected.  I had NO CLUE the owners were going to be out of town, or I would have had ANYONE I could think of go pick them up.  On top of this tragedy, not once have we received any type of apology for our loss from the owners.  They met my family upon drop off, and knew we had two small children we would have to explain this to...no remorse...no apology.  Please don't take any animal here.  They shouldn't be allowed to care for animals.

Crab Corner brought me back to my childhood with their Maryland blue crabs. I cried tears of joy when I tasted them for the first time. I had searched high and low for crabs that were seasoned just like I remembered them from back in the day and I hadn't found exactly what I was looking for until I found Crab Corner. This is easily one of my favorite places in Vegas. I just wish it was closer to where I live! 

The guys that own the place are as awesome as their food is. They're very friendly and are helpful with whatever you need. Good service, good times. Bring a bunch of friends and have at it. Crab Corner has a casual atmosphere that is perfect to drink a few brewskies and get down and dirty with some crabs. Bibs and a hearty appetite recommended!

This review is dedicated to my late grandfather, whom I acquired some of my writing genes from. He passed away before the new year. I used to eat Maryland blue crabs by the swimming pool at his house in the summertime. I will miss him.

Do not order large drinks here. 

They use the same amount of coffee in all sizes. Coffee is the most expensive part of an espresso drink, selling larger drinks with the same amount of coffee at premium prices is dishonest. 

I know of NO other shop that sells coffee in this manner, a large drink always means more coffee.

One star until this policy changes.

EDIT: 

Just physically removed from Roosevelt Tavern by the owner Matt Poole (same owner of Giant) because: 

"You are an asshole. You proved it by not fixing your Yelp! review for over two weeks. You are not welcome in any of my places ever again." 

I responded that this was actually the first time I'd ever spoken directly with him, he said I owed him a phone call and that I didn't know how social media worked. By leaving a bad review I was stealing food from his children's mouth. ?? 

Also the owner of Matt's Big Breakfast, keep this in mind when you're deciding where to spend your hard earned money.

You know what? I watched the Pound Puppies too. I had dreams of rescuing one of those little Hogan's Heroes clones from their little prison, but in real life that isn't necessarily the best way to go.  Cooler never got parvo.

There is a lot of tramatic backstory to my dog ownership that i will spare you but lets say I have been scarred and it took a lot for me to agree to go here to even look.

Several kennels were full of dog shit...haha yeah dogs live there, no sick looking dogs laying in puddles of runny wrong coloured dog shit, it kennels with healthier looking dogs rolling around in the same sick shit. Yes I am being intentionally vile with my language to make the poit of how vile it was. SHIT!

We saw a dog that we loved. I said no; she said please...then a woman told us this dog was on "the list" yup his last day on god's green earth if he didn't get adopted so we took him. A day or so after we pick him up his little cough is turning into a scary and serious sounding wheez so we take him to the vet, over a thousand dollars later we are told the dog has both pnemonia and parvo...surprise surprise since we picked hi up he had dried SHIT in his fur (keep in mind he was not to be bathed for two weeks because of having just been neutered, yes a freshly operated on dog with dried shit in his fur)
 Oh and puppies don't really recover from that sort of thing so w paid the very nice vet to kill out dog...euthenasia...super....

As she bawls her eyes out I man up to call and let the MCACC know hoping they can take some preventative measures, ya know like not let other dogs roll in the shit that he left. (Parvo is super contagious). They let us know the only action they would take was to make note in our file so that if we went to adopt again they would know we didn't already have a dog in the household...yup...My next dog will be adopted from a much more responsible shelter. I understand low budgets and whatnot but how much does it cost to hose runny shit out of a kennel? GRRR.

I'd say the majority of Celine Dion music I've heard in life has been from dentist offices.  Needless to say, they aren't fond memories.  I clearly link "Because You Loved Me" to drilling sounds and a big light in my face.

But you have GOT to be dead inside if you don't feel something when she hits those big notes in tunes like "Power of Love" or "All By Myself" in a live setting. As a case in point, I heard a wife ask her husband what he thought of the show while exiting, and his answer was "eh".  He looked a shade under 139 years old!  Almost dead!

Not to say the show was all roses.  I found her version of "Live and Let Die" to be punchless and uninspiring.  Especially after seeing Axl's version multiple times a few weeks earlier.  

Glad I saw the show but no way in heck would I ever pay for this.  I sat stage left in the rear orchestra and a seat retailed for $175 before tax and service fees.  It's only worth it for big time fans.  Plenty of those were in attendance.  Watching people lose their minds to the "Titanic" song was very, very interesting.

The Mecca.  The holiest of all things burger.  It's a west coast operation, so I only get the chance to In-N-Out once every few years (insert joke here).  But it never disappoints!

The menu is as simple as it gets - burger, cheeseburger, fries, drinks.  But don't let that fool you, there's nothing simple about it.  I'm guessing the most popular menu item is the Double-Double...two patties with two slices of cheese.  From there you can go off menu and order any kind of burger you want.  The first number is patties, the second is cheese slices.  Haven't had the chance to try a 4x4 yet, but that will be happening in the next few months.  Beyond that, you can also dabble in the secret menu and get your burger protein style (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun), or animal style (includes grilled onions and animal sauce).  It's impossible to go wrong.

French fries can also be ordered animal style, but the plain version is just as good.  One of each is even better.  And as far as milkshakes, you have to go with Neapolitan...a combo of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.

It's that simple, yet that perfect.

Green has the best vegan food in Phoenix. Weather or not if you are vegan, there is something there for you. Very artsy inside, fantastic staff, amazing "soynamis" AKA a vegan DQ Blizzard. They have a small grocery area in the front as well, all vegan but all amazing. I always get their special without even looking and have never been let down. The spicy Po Boy, and the Mexicali Burger are my fav off the menu, you also get a side and I never stray from the delicious curry pasta salad. On top of it all, they are very fair priced, 2 meals, 2 drinks, and 2 deserts, usually runs about $20. That's great for in house made healthy food.

Hippies scare me.     So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy, which I have been taking for three days now.  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.

It was all for nothing. No hippies around, just a teenager behind the counter.  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level. I don't know how anyone under 7'6" could easily eat off of them.  

Anyways for $5 flat, you get a kick ass burger, a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries, and a can of soda.   It's true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick.

I'd be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say "it's organic, don't panic".  

Jerry's dead, but this place lives on.  Thanks hippies!

While I was in Vegas and bored outta my mind, I called my "friend" Chris who moved to Vegas a few years ago so we could "chat".

I was staying at the Cosmo so I told him to meet me at the Vesper Bar so we could have a drink and he could possibly slip me a quaalude *kidding*

People watching here is amazing.  The bar area is pretty much empty most of the time, but there are so many people moving past from the hotel.  All kinds of walks of life, from everywhere.  

The drinks all have interesting names and even more interesting ingredients.  Drinks are average prices, anywhere from 10-15 bucks, but they're worth it.  The bartenders are nice, and easy on the eyes.  

If you happened to see an Asian guy making out with a tall white guy...That was probably me...God I'm such a slut, at least Chris cured my case of boredom.

One of best hotels in the world. The Wynn hotel is located on the old Desert Inn hotel. It's the only hotel on the strip with a golf course. If you are a person who loves the European decor and beautiful artwork you are in for a treat. As we all know Las Vegas has a lot hotels from low end to high end. 

If you are a person who enjoys high end hotels you must give this hotel a try. The casino is done with outstanding artwork with great art finishing. If you are a high roller or a person plays the slot you will enjoy the great casino layout. The hotels is gorgeous from  A to Z. If you are a picky person when it comes to hotel beds you are going to love the beds here. 

If you are coming to Vegas you must give the spa a try. One of the best spas in the world. If you are buffet lover you will enjoy the outstanding food. I highly recommend  the Sinatra for high end dinning. If you are looking for something more low key check out the country club. You can have lunch over the patio that overlooks the golf course. 

Being a big fan of Caesars Palace for may years the Wynn is my new playground in Vegas. All the way around this is a 5 star resort.

Taiwanese ice, Vegas style.

Am I in hell?  It's 110 degrees.  The Prius says 125 outside.  I'm seat belted in and  on the 15 when I realize I'm still wearing a hoody.  AC not cooling s#!%.  Finally, the trailer.  Frost Bites Shavery and relief.  Within minutes cup in hand.  Scoop one, light, fluffy, COLD, ahhhh.  Scoop two, body temperature falling, I'm forgetting I'm still wearing a hoody.  Scoop three; NOOOOO, it's melting!!!

This is good stuff.  Hawaii yeeps, think Frostcity on steroids.  Ribbons of fluffy goodness are shaved  from blocks of highly concentrated. naturally flavored ice.  Light, fluffy, delicious for the first two or three scoops then the texture changes it quickly becomes wet and "mushy", the sweetness becomes cloying.  Stick to the smallest size.  You can always get another.  (went back four times in one visit.  Scoop, scoop, toss, order, scoop, scoop, toss... Things we do for yelp)  

Flavors are strong and delish while the ice stays ice.  Vanilla (cloying sweetness), mango (floral, intense, cloying finish), green tea (bitter sweet tea flavor, best once melted), black sesame (nice sesame aroma, different, cloying finish).

Toppings are akin to a froyo bar, ie big chunks of fruits, nuts, crackers, candy, and cookies.  They detract and overpower the ice.  Too much crunch or texture and flavor.  

Inexpensive ranging from $2.25 to $6.25 for a family size cup.

Very good but more of a sweet treat than a chilling refresher (I guess that's why we have beer).

Vegas' top sushi restaurant.

NOT an AYCE joint.  ZERO Americanized rolls.  PURE Edo style sushi.  

Before all my sushi loving yeeps book the trip; meaning no disrespect to the Vegas food scene, Kabuto is the best in Vegas, but does not come close to touching the perfection that is the two Michelin star Urasawa in LA.  Granted, it does not come close to the $500 per person price tag of Urasawa either.

Rambling food history lesson:  This is classic  Edo style sushi born from necessity (no refrigeration in the early 19th century).  Large fillets of fish (toro) wont spoil as fast at room temperature like small fish (saba) with their bacteria filled intestines or turn rancid from their oxidizing fat (ie anago).  Yummy thoughts.  So, big fish = raw, small fish = marinated, oily fish = cooked.  Most are brushed in shoyu  and include wasabi, to inhibit spoilage.

Culinary artistry / craziness has taken over and the humble street food is now served in minimalist zen surroundings,  beautifully sauced and presented the way the chef feels it should be.  Its considered disrespectful for the diner to alter the sushi.

Although you can order individual sushi, the omakase ($80) or nigiri sampler ($48) is the best way to experience the ideal progression of flavors.

Selections change daily depending on availability.  The seafood is sourced globally.  All extremely fresh.  The chu-toro and o-toro correctly graded and a fatty delight.  The giant clam and ama ebi cloyingly sweet with the perfect oceanic finish.  Firm texture.  The list goes on and on.

Very good quality, delicately seasoned, short grain rice.  Nice compaction, holding its form but not breaking the individual grains.  

For all its refinement, this is one bite finger food (don't expect pieces of fish so large it slides down your throat and sticks out of your mouth at the same time). Toss the chopsticks aside and dive right in!

Highly recommended.

Horrible Horrible Horrible!!!!!!

For a dedicated customer whose been loyal for over 10 years, I've never been more disappointed in an airline than JetBlue 

Our flight was scheduled to depart at 2:45 pm over the New Years weekend and while we were waiting in line to check in, our flight was suddenly cancelled due to inclement weather.  That's not all. The rescheduled flight wasn't set to leave until three whole days later! Holy moly, i had to get back to work! That being said, they made no attempt to accommodate me or pay for the inconvenience. No hotel, no taxi voucher or nothing. They did offer a refund if I didn't want to take the ridiculous flight that was leaving three days later. I think you can figure out the choice I made. The heavens were looking over me that day and I managed to nab a late flight leaving to LAX 8+ hours later that evening. 

I swore never again to fly JetBlue but when February came around, I had to make reservations for a business trip and because my Amex preferred airline was JetBlue, I just took the leap of faith. I flew out of long beach with no hassle but when it came time to flying back home, trouble was brewing yet again. 
This time, the flight gate was changed last minute without any changes made on the overhead flight monitors. I was chilling in the airport lounge and checking the monitors periodically, and there was no gate change announcement until I arrived at the gate to depart. To add insult to injury, they stated the 5pm flight was delayed until 7pm for maintenance issues. 2 hours later, they dropped the bomb on us and said the flight was cancelled. I scrambled again, just like I did in January to find another flight. Thankfully I found another flight with absolutely no help from JetBlue whatsoever. JetBlue emailed me and offered a 75$ credit towards my next flight. Hmmmmm, would you fly again with them when your flight was cancelled twice in less than 6 weeks? I think not. I tried calling and asking for a refund or reimbursement for all the inconveniences (ie having to find another flight same night, leaving at a much later time than my scheduled flight, no accommodations, driving from Santa Ana airport to long beach to get my car, etc) The rep responded with a resounding "No compensation, only 75$ credit towards another flight" I asked to speak to a supervisor, she again responded with "No"  I'm done with this airline and if you have any common sense, you should avoid them like the plague. Horrible service, no regard or consideration whatsoever for their customers and completely unreliable.

"What would you do if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key."-"With A Little Help From My Friends", Beatles

Beatles LOVE, with seating in the round, so not a bad seat in the house.  It's been showcased on the Strip for a long time now, and still draws the crowds nightly.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?select=z2BQr5kmAM5La12sRzvQSg#z2BQr5kmAM5La12sRzvQSg

We used Tix4Tonight to score some primo seats for cheap.  There's a part of the act where a surpise is brought out to the audience and we happened to be the very last row to participate.  I won't spoil it, but it was fun!

Pre-show, some clowns put on some comic relief by, literally, blowing smoke up people's arses.  Kinda creepy, kinda funny - it was great seeing people's reactions.

The highlights of Beatles LOVE, for me, were the aerialist during "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" & the act featuring "Strawberry Fields Forever".  Very touching.  I didn't care much for the halfpipes and rollerbladers.  Oh, and the music is on blast!  I'm talking loud!  So, just be mindful of that, if you have sensitive hearing.

Overall, a great show worth the money & time while in Vegas!  I highly recommend using Tix4Tonight for purchasing tickets the day before/day of.  Our seats were great & we saved a lot of money.  I'm generally not a Cirque du Soleil fan, but I highly enjoyed this eclectic & colorful show.

So as 4 of us were waiting in line to buy tickets at 9:15pm on a Sunday, a random, friendly girl gave us three tickets and in a flash she was gone.  We were in total disbelief.  I was still skeptical up to the part where they scanned the ticket.  Saved us $111!!  I owe her some Sprinkles at the very least if we ever cross paths again.  

Currently the largest observatory wheel in the world (wonder how much of a pain it will be when it becomes the 2nd), there's not much to say about the ride itself.  You go around for 30 minutes, see the strip, snap pics and it's over.  The waiting area before getting to the actual wheel is very Disney Worldesque.  

The "guide" is a guy on a video screen dishing out facts and bad jokes (420 ft! You're really high!!).   I wonder why they didn't have different performers from Caesars shows doing video segments instead?  Imagine what the Gazillionaire and Penny would say?!  They could do the "quiet tour" with Teller.

The biggest variable with how enjoyable your ride will be are the others in your pod.  Each pod is supposed to fit 40 people.  I saw a family with 5 small and loud kids on their rollerskate sneakers in front of us and I would have done almost anything to avoid being in the same pod including lighting myself on fire.  We rode with about 20 others that were fine and excited to be on the ride.  

Other things:

- Try to go for the seats on the immediate right upon getting into the pod.
- Nighttime has to be better than daytime.  
- Please go to the restroom before getting on.

I really like this place because it has a lot of potential. One of the tweaks I would make is to get a decent honey mustard dipping sauce. Also, I thought calling out people's name in the restaurant with their food order was annoying. I guess I find that annoying because I was trying to get some reading in during the lunch break. I did like their ketchup dispenser. No more worrying about ketchup splattering on your shirt. Next time I'll have to take a picture of it.

This was my first time in a Raising Cane so I decided to order the Caniac which consists of 6 chicken strips plus a bunch of crinkle fries and a soda for about $8 dollars. I thought you get a lot for your money. I enjoyed the chicken strips but they would have tasted much better with the honey mustard sauce.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 60/100

Pretty solid shopping mall in Vegas! One of the best ones I visited during my most recent trip. It's huge and actually feels like a real mall as opposed to some of the hotels who have a few shops (less than 20-30) and consist of stores that nobody would ever be interested in actually shopping at.

At the front of the mall, there's a smaller area that consists of several floors with an awesome winding escalator. On the second (or third? I can't remember), it leads further back into a whole other section of the mall...which goes on for forever! So many stores! They range from normal/average, to high end and luxury brands. There are also lots of restaurants and cafes located in the mall.

The one reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because I felt like I was getting kind of confused as to the layout of the mall. It's weird how there's the small-ish entryway area (reminds me of the big mall in San Francisco), and then on one floor it kinda just continues further and farther away from everything else. Also, the mall map directory was kind of confusing and I wasn't sure what direction to walk in.

I would say this mall is comparable to the Venetian's, except slightly different architecture! Both very European.

I love this place!  I noticed a lot of people there and wondered if it was worth the trip.  I wasn't disappointed.  On the day I went, I had a vegieburger and it was really good, came with a salad and blue chips. I brought half of it home and had the other half for dinner.  I also ordered a drink that was cherry and chocolate (delicious).  I am a big fan and would go more but it is a little expensive.  Also took a slice of the chocolate pomegranate cake (their signature dish) and it was really outstanding.  I shall return!

After surviving my first tornado scare in Madison, Wisconsin, my partner in crime, Daniel L. and I ventured out to this well known local BBQ hangout for some good old smoky ribs and all the fixings.

With the Midwest reputation of having some of the finest meats, it was a no brainer to order the 1/3 slab BBQ smoked ribs and pork shoulder sandwich combination dinner ($14.75). The staff mentioned the pork shoulder and the beef brisket were the top sellers besides the ribs.

The pork shoulder was pigilicious! The shredded meat was perfectly seasoned with the rub and then hickory smoked which gave its own taste without the addition of the BBQ sauce. It also impressed me because there were was no sign of grease on the pork. The bun was a standard bread bun compared to the sweet roll which accompanied the dinner combination. We took the recommendation of the staff and ordered the extra meat (additional 5 ounces for $3) since were feeling extra carnivorous! The BBQ pork ribs came with five succulent ribs with the meat just waiting to fall off the bone. Each bite had a generous coating of their famous award winning BBQ sauce. 

Our dinner combination came with two choices of side orders which we picked the baked beans and cole slaw. Both were served in a small styrofoam cups along with the BBQ sauce. It's easy to see why the BBQ sauce won numerous award because of it's rich, sweet and peppery flavor. I'm not a fan of cole slaw but this one exceed my expectations with its creaminess and was extra cold. The baked beans maintained a firm texture and should be ordered with any meal because the sauce was so addictive.

The cabin style interior holds 11 tables and is very close to the Madison airport. The actual BBQ pit is located a few miles away from the restaurant. So grab your dental floss and wet naps and eat some authentic BBQ at Smoky Jon's!

A 24 hour cheap hot sandwich place is a vegas jackpot!!!  I always find myself having sandwich cravings and i'd been spending weeks looking at the reviews. I had decided way before i stepped into the store at PH, that i would be ordering the Full Montagu- Roast beef and turkey!!! 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=pqiqUiWVESs9LubdKK2zcw
We were still full from breakfast, so i didn't get to try a second sandwich as i had hoped (i'm definitely getting the canonball meatball sammie next time). I'm sure after i try a few more different sammies here, i would upgrade to a 5, but based on just the one i had, i just needed a little something more. More mayonaisy sauce? Avocado? Not sure. But i am not craving it, as i do with Cooks, Mendo, Caps or Langers. But... I will be back for sure to get the cannonball and get ANOTHER brownie whoopie pie !! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=DbdvnjAtWRE2Hj0_MbX26Q

When it comes to parties, Steve Wynn's Encore Beach Club and XS Night Club are still the gold standard for the hottest spots in town.

I came to the Beach Club on Sunday at around 2:oopm to see Calvin Harris and surprisingly there was hardly no wait at all! I've heard horror stories where people were turned away even though they bought tickets for the show because the venue was beyond capacity. In any case, we got in, I was happy...

SCORE!!

As soon as we walked through security, I witnessed an ocean of skin filling the entire space! And this pool area was huge! 

Damn these people are beautiful! I suggest ordering drinks on the left side of the entrance cuz the drinks were bigger, stiffer and the same price!  

I tried the food as well and it was also very good! I recommend the grilled chicken sandwich and the steak sliders, both were mouthwatering good and excellent accompaniments to our drinks!

Calvin Harris came out about 3:00pm and the crowd was buzzing by now with anticipation! There was so much energy in the pit but it was all positive, no hating, no shoving or any nonsense like that...it was all love and good times and that's how it should be!

Bravo Encore Beach Club!

I had a slammin time and I look forward to coming back very soon!

Happy Times!

When Ken M told me about his idea to have a UYE for the Buffet of Buffets ($45.99) and do it in 1 day, I thought it was a great idea.....so I told him if he did it, I would be there.  Well, the day finally came and 7 of us embarked on a journey to accomplish this task on a Saturday in March.  I wrote a review for each buffet we went to (links to each review below).  The schedule is below:

Breakfast

9:00 am - Caesars Palace: Lago Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/lago-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:ab5b7QIzLhhN_ixM5s1yrQ
10:30 am - Flamingo: Paradise Garden Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/paradise-garden-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:gBCZai1zqnPpWw-q0zyt0w

Lunch

12:00 pm - Imperial Palace: Emperor's Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/emperors-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:t-h1fgV4T-Lvin80jWxbPg
1:30 pm - Harrah's: Flavors Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/flavors-the-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:5mGaPZ_ukWUoVg2GttnHZA
3:00 pm - Rio: Carnival World Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/carnival-world-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:8xW8Mr61rcZ9SsJyG8uK_w

Dinner

5:00 pm - Paris: Le Village Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/le-village-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:m2YKMThWKZYkLXtt_0zNpA
7:00 pm - Planet Hollywood: Spice Market Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-spice-market-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:T3hJAv1ROUL5uVY92C2o4A

I had a plan to pace myself so I could enjoy the entire day of buffets.....well, of course that plan went out the window with Buffet #1.....and it was downhill from there....I was stuffed by the time we were done with the Flamingo Buffet.  Needless to say, I gained 5.5 lbs after this ordeal.....and I'm still trying to work off the lbs in the gym.

Overall, it was a fun time and I recommend giving it a try at least once.  The schedule we had was perfect and we were on time for every buffet, except the last one.....but that was because there was a concert that night at Planet Hollywood and it made parking a little longer than expected.  If I was to do it again, I'd only go to 3 Buffets.....the Rio, Harrah's, and Planet Hollywood.  I'd have Dinner at the Rio & Planet Hollywood, and Lunch at Harrah's.  Those were the 3 best buffets out of the group and you can easily fit 3 of those in a 24 hour schedule.

The 7 in one day was very agressive and I won't do it again.....but I don't regret participating in the event.....all of the Yelpers in our group had a blast.

A good British steak house in the Paris?  Why not.

Love him or hate him, Gordon Ramsay is a multi Michelin stared chef.  Trying his London restaurants dispelled the myth for me that British food is bland and flavorless.  That said, at Gordon Ramsay Steak, the British signature dishes are the standouts.  As a steakhouse, it falls in the middle of the pack in price and quality behind Cut, StripSteak, and CraftSteak.

Two types of beef, limited cuts (epically if you are not sharing your steak).  28 day dry aged, prime beef is excellent.  Well trimmed.  Good marbling.  Beefy with the waft of umame.  The American kobe is feminine; tender, mild, almost sweet.  They claim the beef rates a BMS 10+ (Japanese A5), could be but it's nowhere near as flavorful as Australian or Japanese wagyu.

The signature dishes are outstanding.  Flavors are bold.  The Beef Wellington with a syrupy, red wine demi packs a flavor punch.  A classic.  The "Fisherman's Grill" is also exceptional.  Perfectly cooked lobster, mussels, scallops served with a silky curry sauce.  Oh yeah!.  

Sides meant to be shared.  The mushroom tart, gratineed spinach and blue cheese mac and cheese are good eats and make the perfect match to the dry aged beef by heightening the umame aftertaste.  Unfortunately their flavors overpower the kobe cuts.

My favorite part of Vegas - right here.

Sure it's nice to walk around in the daytime, but it's better in the night. Why? Because that's when everything is completely lit up! Keep those cameras handy when you're walking around here. You can even take some pictures of certain areas of the strip when you're walking on the "overhead" crosswalks. It's not just the lights to enjoy, but also some of the free shows that are available, including Mirage's Volcano and Bellagio's Dancing Water Fountains.

Be mindful of your surroundings when walking around, especially in the night. Sure it's touristy, but as what some other reviewers pointed out, there were some sketchy people hanging around (panhandlers, con artists, etc.). For this reason, I take away one star.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely be back here!

Bigger isn't always better, but sometimes it's exactly what you need. If so, the MGM Grand Hotel is especially good for a big group, conference, or event. It's the largest hotel resort in America (World #2) with rooms branded as MGM Grand, Signature, Skylofts, and The Mansion.

What you'll find at MGM Grand includes:
 * Largest hotel in Vegas with 6,582 rooms
 * Largest casino in Las Vegas
 * 380,000 sq ft convention center
 * 16,800 seat MGM Grand Garden Arena
 * 4 pools including ultra cool Wet Republic
 * A quarter-mile lazy river around the MGM Grand Pools
 * EDM playground Hakkasan Nightclub
 * KA by Cirque Du Soleil theatrical show
 * Brad Garrett's Comedy Club (Headliners vary)
 * Regular performers like David Copperfield
 * A dated activity called the CSI: Experience
 * Access to the Las Vegas Monorail ($5/ride; $12/day)
 * The Forever Grand Wedding Chapel
 * A Salon and a Spa
 * 11 Specialty Restaurants; 6 Casual Spots, a Buffet, and a Food Court
 * Popular: Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak, Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill, & Shibuya
 * Shopping options including Sugar Factory and small boutiques
 * A large (of course) Race and Sports Book
 * The largest bronze statue in the U.S. - Leo the Lion near the LV Strip Entrance

What you won't find includes:
 * The Lion Habitat that closed in 2012
 * The Wizard of Oz theme from the 1990s
 * Anything truly outstanding or unique, but plenty that's a-ok
 * An escape from long walks between areas of the hotel

The MGM Grand Hotel is big. In fact, it's the biggest and most spread-out hotel you'll find anywhere. Rooms range between 3-4 stars. The accommodations are better than they were 5 years ago, but still kind of average hotel rooms ... which is no surprise when you think of the volume of rooms and people they must accommodate.

Three stars means a-ok and the MGM is exactly that ... a boring, but very BIG A-OK.

I had my first taste of the Capistrami in Vegas and was so excited they opened a location in Beverly Hills, but after coming to this new location, i am reminded that i still like the set up in Vegas the best. 
It feels alot more family run and friendly here.
Place your order first with the cooks, grab your drinks out the fridge and chips to munch on, and pay at the register. Be generous and give them tip for their Beer Fund! 

I've enjoyed the Bobbie and the Slaw Be Jo, (the philly is too spicy for me), but i still love their Capistrami the best. This time we got a 20 inch of that, and 12 inch roast beef Slaw Be Jo. They have tastykakes here, which i have yet to try and i love their potato chip selection. 

If ur tired of buffet gorging or don't have enough money left to keep splurging, and had enough of Sonics, I def recommend trying their pastrami! 

* about 7 min from the strip a little past the Palms

We used these guys to cater street tacos for our daughter's 1yo birthday party.
If you have an upcoming event and need awesome food and great service at a great price, use Taqueria Guadalajara.  These are legit street tacos.
   Hector was my contact person, and he was very accomodating and professional. We ended up increasing the guest list significantly near the party, and it was no problem. 4 types of meat are included - went with carne asada, chicken, chorizo, and al pastor (pork). All four were good, but the consensus was that the al pastor was the best. 
   David came out to our house and set up about an hour before food was to be served. He started grilling, and set out the vegetable bar, which was huge. There were pickled onions, carrots/jalapeno, some sort of slaw, lettuce, pico de gallo, onions, and green and red salsas. David was extremely courteous, and stayed to serve until the last person was done eating - in 100 degree heat outside. Cleanup was great, you wouldn't even know they were there. 
  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because David did leave a "Tips" box out on the table. My feeling is that at a catered party, it is the host's responsibility to tip for good service. Expecting the guests to tip is a little awkward. Just my opinion, but not a huge deal. 
Would use them again in a heartbeat, as will many of my guests.

When the king of pop decided against "Beautiful Young Thing" for his epic 1982 album, Thriller, that set the wheels in motion for what we know today as BYT.

When this place is packed, and it gets packed, you'll be doing the moonwalk as patrons enter and exit by means of any open crevice between you and the other line-mongers.  Michael was so right... You Are Not Alone, but tough it out, because once you sink those bleached choppaz into your first bite, you'll Wanna Be Startin Somethin.

I can personally vouch for the carne asada, chicked and birria tacos, with the later being my favorite.  My wife and I split a carne, cheese and bean burrito.  My only complaint was the fatty chunks, and the gristle.  I wont ding them too hard, as they were totally slammed.

The biggest disappointment of the night came in a styrofoam cup.  The side of frijoles we ordered had to have been from a can... like a can of Rosarita.  I can see them needing a fallback with as  busy as they were, its possible they could have sold out of the good stuff.  I wont know for sure, until my return visit.  I use Elmer's Tacos or Rancho Market as my bean baseline, so be on your A game guys, because based on The Way You Make Me Feel will determine if I'm going to continue to Rock With You, or not... because I will Remember The Time.

I also polished off an order of chips & salsa, a Mexican coke and a large horchata... so I left pre-diabetic and pretty stuffed... so much that I almost didn't recognize that Man In The Mirror.

The year: 2010.
  
The episode: "Phoenix."

The Man: Adam Richman, himself.

The Challenge: Chompie's "The Ultimate Slider Challenge."

...12 Original Jewish Sliders: each one brisket-filled and gravy-drizzled, stacked as well with mini potato pancakes, Jack cheese, and onion strings.  Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.  Instead, I ordered the Combo.  And after tearing through an incredibly tasty two, alongside a cup of Matzo Ball soup, I was full.  Adam, however, he Manned-up!  Sadly, though, after a hard-fought battle, he--as many have before him--ultimately threw in the towel. The Challenge, it seemed, proved too hefty.  Food had won.

...However, if one, brave soul decides to accept this heaping challenge ($39.95) and conquers this plattered beast, it's free.  But not only that: upon winning, you will be forever immortalized on Chompie's "Hall of Fame" website (http://chompies.com/wall-of-fame/) and an "Ultimate Slider Challenge" T-shirt awaits you and your bragging self!! You bad!!  (By the way, there's no California representation on that website, zero, none, not one, nada...  Who'll step up?

This having been my first time to Chompie's, I was truly impressed!  A Yelp check-in offer allowed for a free bagel from their awesome deli/bakery; our very cool server, Trudy, brought out a few, free cookie samples for this first-timer; and our just-as-cool host made lunch suggestions, which we ordered verbatim.  As promised, those Sliders were "deli-icious."  And the Matzo Ball and Chicken soup hit the spot.  But I couldn't leave...not yet.  As full as I was, I couldn't head back to CA without first trying the carrot cake, could I?  I mean, you don't blame me, right?

So, "Man vs Food"...  That takes care of Phoenix: Alice Cooper'stown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/alice-cooperstown-phoenix?hrid=esDZwjuGZQlkpKrZAC_guQ), Los Reyes de la Torta (http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-reyes-de-la-torta-phoenix-2?hrid=nJiqRCfTtxs2bIoFrPdmkA), and now Chompie's.  On deck, LA.

Good food, okay service.

If you're looking for good authentic Asian food in the Venetian in Vegas, this is your place.  However, like many of the very authentic Asian restaurants, the service was completely lacking.  Our waitress visited our table only twice, once to take our order and the second time to bring the bill.  Otherwise a server brought our food, and no stopped by again to ask if we needed anything else. 

I tired to send back a plate because it wasn't what I wanted, and the hostess essentially told me "no", because they'd through the food away and it'd be wasted... so I just kept it and ate, but after a few more bites it wasn't all that bad after all  :-)

I guess what they lack in service they make up for in the food.

Chocolate is the Chuck Norris of sweets. It is possibly the tastiest substance ever created by mankind. Sure, chocolate can cure hunger, but it can also be paired with any food, stop wars, and, in many cultures, is part of mating rituals. Chocolate is like sweet edible sex.

If you're still reading, you can stop now cause ... ya, I know ... "I had you at chocolate."

No sane person could turn down chocolate if offered. When my wife proposed going to Max Brenner at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace for dessert, she knew from my drool that I was no fool.

We were greeted at our table by a hyper server. Dude was clearly choco-rushin' and bouncin' off the walls. I loved his energy, but never did quite figure out what he was recommending. Does it matter? Chocolate is a synonym for "yum."

The Chocolate Fondue and Choctails were tempting (of course); however, we opted for Max's Fried Dough ($14.25). This sweet icon is one huge thin crispy plate of Fried Dough drizzled with Chocolate Chunks, Toffee, Chocolate Ice Cream, and Milk Chocolate Ganache. The animated server said there was no way the two of us could finish it ... I laughed and dove in with both hands. He knows this is chocolate, right? It's a messy and filling dessert designed for a whole family to share...or not share. (4 stars)

We also split a Chocolate Hazelnut Milkshake ($7.95) with Vanilla Ice Cream, Milk Chocolate Ganache, Chocolate Hazelnut Spread, Milk, and Whipped Cream. The shake was smooth, sweet, & superior. If Vincent in Pulp Fiction was surprised by a $5 milkshake imagine how he'd react to an $8 shake. Who needs vodka? It's got CHOCOLATE. I don't know if it's worth $8, but it's pretty f-in good! (4 stars)

Max Brenner, I don't know who you are, but I do love chocolate. So, yep, I'm a sucker ... and a fan ... cause there are only two kinds of people in this world, those who love chocolate ... and those who love chocolate, but won't admit it.

This was my first time in Terminal 3 since I was flying Virgin America to LA and I do have to say that it's pretty awesome because it's new, modern, open, and spacious. Checking in is a breeze if you must do so. All the airlines are all lined up with awesome LED screens indicating each airline's specific counter. 

The security now has two separate lines - one for regular screens and individuals who have TSA Pre-Check. The TSA Pre-Check line moved pretty quickly even if it looks pretty long. Just remember folks, put all your stuff in your bag and don't have any metal like belts, coin change, etc. on your or in your pockets. It'll make the line move much more quickly!

After getting through security, there are plenty of screen to inform you of you arriving and departing flights. The terminal is pretty big with huge windows that let in plenty of light. In true Vegas style, there are slot machines around every corner in case you have extra time before your flight.

There are plenty of food options such as Pei Wei, Burger King, Carl's Jr., and Coffee Bean. I think there are a couple more options, but I noticed these just from looking for food. They also had your basic stores in case you wanted some snacks, reading material, Las Vegas memorabilia, etc. The bathrooms are also modern and clean, which is always a plus.

The terminal is very accommodating to tech savvy folks. There is free wi-fi for your use and there's also a dedicated charging station. It would've been better if there were chargers are each seat, but that's just me being picky.

If I have to fly to Las Vegas again, going through Terminal 3 would be awesome. It has everything I need to literally make the time fly! You will not be disappointed!

In every city, usually across the street or within a short walk of the High School there is a neighborhood hangout. 

The food can run from just average, to exceptional. Elmer's tends to be mostly in the latter camp over the former, what a wonderful surprise.

My two coworkers and I came here for a late lunch yesterday. From the outside, it doesn't look like anything special. Heck, even on the inside it doesn't either. 

Yes, Elmer's is a hole in the wall type place. One that probably wouldn't even make Guy Fieri's DDD list. But the food is good.

I ordered chips, steak burrito and a drink. The tab came to under $9 and if you look at the picture of the chips, it's kind of basic. The Salsa btw comes in plastic squirt bottles. LOL. 

But my steak burrito was the real deal and bomb! Take a look at my picture and know that Chipotle has nothing on this bad boy. It tasted as good as it looks and it's only $5.85.  Nice. 

Enjoy!

Vegas requires a surprisingly large amount of thinking. Does the club pay for the cab? Sometimes. One-guy-one-girl rule? Usually. Be sure to tip... or not. Buy her a drink... or not.  $30 cover?? 

Did I just go to a strip club or do my taxes?

I'm at a point in my life where i'm trying to find meaning and depth in the world... and this is the last place in the last city I should be in. It just doesn't do it for me. But it's always good to try new things, and thus lovable Yelper, AJ, made sure I didn't leave without getting my first lap dance.

Keane: So.. uh... what are you into?
Girl: *surprised look*
Keane: Uh.. I meant... things to do.
Girl: I've been going to a lot of late night clubs... Oh! You have really soft hair. What do you use?
Keane: ... shampoo.

So, all week before my Vegas trip I was super pumped about a schmancy $100 brunch reservation we had at some other restaurant. It turned out to be okay, but that night we went to Johnny Smalls for a $20 all-you-can-eat tapas dinner and it blew that fancy schmancy brunch out of the effin' water.

Seriously. This is approximately three billion times better than any buffet out there. I know some of ya'll are really into foie gras, caviar, and whatever other hoity-toitiness there is out there. You know what I'm into? Mac n' cheese, bacon, fritos, ranch dressing. What can I say? I'm a gal of highly refined taste, and Johnny Smalls has got my number

There was a 20 minute wait for a table, so we sidled on up to the bar and had dinner and drinks there all served by Anthony, the most kickass flair bartender/server EVER. And you know how I mentioned that $20 AYCE earlier? It really is AYCE. Anything on the menu. From frito pie (with kobe beef chili, of course) to pork belly to tuna sashimi to mac n cheese to grilled pb&j. TWENTY DOLLARS. Period. No extra. 

...word on the street is that they are upping the price to $30 for AYCE after the new year, but even if that's true this is still one of the best values for endless deliciousness around.

Why does everything have to be SO BIG?! Usually we Yelpers don't complain about that (ha!), but in this case it's just ridiculous. Not to mention the potential for inducing heart attacks is immeasurably increased. It must be part of the appeal / gimmick, but too bad larger sizes don't translate to better food quality.

We were here for breakfast at 8 AM after a long night of partying and gambling (we hadn't slept yet) so at this point everything * should * have tasted good, right?

My Grilled Cheese with ham was hearty and a decent size -- thankfully not a monstrosity. The "Hash Browns" were more like a plateful of overcooked potato chunks, most of which were too hard in texture to eat. The "Side of Bacon" turned out to be an overflowing platter of much-too-crunchy, strange looking meat strips.

Service was friendly when we arrived, but seemed more hassled as the room began filling up for breakfast. 

All in all, an okay experience but would only come back for convenience (a.k.a. when staying at the Mirage and cannot make it to a restaurant outside the hotel).

TIP: Size isn't everything.

DATE TIP: Size isn't everything. Wait, what?! I'm talking about the sandwiches!

EDIT 12/2/2014: Chef Hong no longer works there.  Booooooo

I will definitely be a regular now that Chef Hong (ex-Moko) is bringing out his inventive dishes at Kanji.  The former Geisha House location comes off like an Epcot Center restaurant for Japanese food.  The multiple teppanyaki stations, large sushi bar, block wood furniture, full bar, high ceilings and bright lights are very welcoming.  The complimentary sake bomb (one of the best Yelp check-in offers currently) only enhance that feeling.  

Like an amazing movie sequel (very rare), all of Hong's beloved edible characters are here: beef short ribs, 30 hour pork belly, shrimp risotto, in-house smoked fish etc.  They're now being presented with some new and interesting twists from his original, wizardly recipes.  What stay consistent are the flavors, quality and creativity.  There are also some new plates like the excellent miso glazed Chilean seabass and 7 hour pork shoulder.  Seriously.....find me a local sushi joint that's pushing out entrees like these and I will wear a Britney Spears shirt for a week.  

They don't offer AYCE sushi, but the nigiri I've tried has been of excellent quality.  We were informed that they receive fresh shipments every two days which is pretty remarkable.  Kanji also offers a killer late night happy hour from 10pm-2am Monday through Saturday that I plan on checking out pretty soon.

Who would have thought I'd find myself downtown at a rundown casino like Palace Station, but there I was on a late Sunday night enjoying one of the most satisfying dishes sin city had to offer! 

Yup, I'm talkin about the Pan Roast at Oyster Bar! 

Do yourself a huge favor and order the palace version with shrimp chicken andouille sausage and crab. I added lobster too. But either way, It's the bomb, cuz its all about that crazy good sauce! Keep in mind however, to truly enjoy this dish, you've gotta love your spice! Trust, each bite will be a scorching spoonful of fiery goodness! Chunks of meaty sausage, chicken and seafood in every bite and I bet you won't be able to put your spoon down! Well, except to wipe your forehead from the sweat cuz this bad boy is hot hot hot! But oooh soooo hot diggity good! I ordered a level 7 (1-10 being spiciest) and it was just right!

We started with 1/2 a dozen oysters on the half shell, and that was an excellent intro to our fantastic meal! The oysters were fresh and went down the hatch nicely with a swig of cold frosty Kirin! 

We also ordered the shrimp scampi. It came served with loads of succulent tiger shrimp, a heaping serving of fresh chopped garlic and noodles swimming in a pool of buttery glory. Although it was tasty, it simply couldn't hold a candle to the signature pan roast IMO! 

I'm tellin ya, order the pan roast and enjoy! Your taste buds and tummy will thank you for it!

Happy Eats!

We were sooo happy when Sam Fox opened one of his Zinburgers here in Scottsdale Quarter.  Our taste buds leaped for joy.  

We've always enjoyed their Biltmore location. And even though the service here could be better and the location enlarged, the burgers were...  great. 

We returned last evening for our fourth visit. I would plan on a thirty minute wait, but that will allow you to hit some of the nearby stores. The time went by quickly, with a band playing in the promenade.  Nice!

We started off with their yummy fried zucchini sticks ($7.00), adding the Chipotle Mayo dip to the Ranch was a great idea. I decided to try their Kale Caesar ($4.50). It was good, but needed a little more dressing. 

As for our burgers, we ordered the Breakfast ($12.50) open face and their house Zin($10.50).  Mine had an fried egg on top, with applewood bacon,
avocado, cheese, lettuce and mayo; while the Zin had manchego cheese, yummy zinfandel Braised Onions with lettuce and mayo.  Both were delicious.

I believe the secret to Zinburger is how they make their burgers.  Rather compacting the chopped meat and squeezing out all the air pockets. They form them gently. That way the smoky taste permeates the meat.

Expect to pay $20 each plus taxes and gratuities, including soft drinks and one appetizer or small salad each.

Enjoy!

I went here to see the Coyotes play my home town Chicago Blackhawks. The place was sold out and consisted mostly of Chicagoans. I had no problem high fiving fellow fans after each of the 5 goals that the hawks scored. And of course they won going away that night. I guess it's a sad commentary on society in general when you have to go through a metal detector to go into the stadium. 

I had excellent seats since they were about 10 rows from the glass at the faceoff circle. I was positioned near the Coyotes net to see most of the Hawk's goals. The lines at the concession places weren't too bad but I'm pretty ticked that the dude as we entered our section wanted to see my tickets. I guess he wanted me to juggle my food and drinks in the air while I fished out my tickets from my pocket. He saw my "Are you kidding me look" and explained that they were sold out. I explained to him that I've gone to plenty of sold out games in Chicago without the attitude from the Stadium staff. How can the management expect fans wanting to pay $10 bucks for parking plus $80 plus dollars per ticket and still wanting to endure the hassle of their staff inside? Management might want to think about that for awhile.

Pro tip about going to the game. Don't expect to get any free pizza from their cheerleaders when you're wearing the away team's colors. Getting out of the parking lot was fairly easy as well. Also, thank goodness that cell phone reception is a little inconsistent near the ice so you don't have to listen to people on their phones.

What a spiritual, uplifting Catholic Community!

From the opening notes of the hymn, "All are welcome in this place", I knew how special Saint Patrick's was to me.

"Let us build a house
where love can dwell
And all can safely live,
A place where
saints and children tell
How hearts learn to forgive."

There are so many things I want to share about coming here for 5 pm Mass. First is coming into their sacred space and hearing a first class Choir and musicians practicing . Their group also includes a pianist, a person on Keyboard and a very young College age drummer.  They were great, and not just for the practice, but throughout the service. They all worked well together and didn't overwhelm the senses. The music of Paul Hillebrand and the heavenly voice of their Cantor Jill Bagshaw are incredible and needs to be experienced to be appreciated.  

"Let us build a house where prophets speak,
And words are strong and true,
Where all God's children dare to seek
To dream God's reign anew."

Second is the friendly parishioners who sat around me, including some long time friends. Even though Father Eric was away on vacation, the folk at Saint Patrick's didn't seem to miss a beat. Their ministry to the poor of spirit here in the valley is well known, particularly their efforts at Justa Center.  But it's also the nearly four dozen other ministries, where they offering themselves as the hands and body of Christ, which makes you realize how special this community is.

"Let us build a house where love is found
In water, wine and wheat:
A banquet hall on holy ground,
Where peace and justice meet."

I've come to Mass here many times and the Liturgy is wonderful. I have never felt this way in any other Catholic Church.  It is so moving, to stand up and have the entire church hold hands for The Lord's Prayer, and I do mean everyone. It's special and I only wish I could convey how moving it is to feel the spirit in this church when it happens. It's just amazing to have over five hundred members standing, holding hands and reciting not a prayer by rote, but with feeling and love that makes it so special. 

"Here the love of God, through Jesus,
Is revealed in time and space;
As we share in Christ the feast that frees us:

All are welcome, all are welcome,
All are welcome in this place."

I was reading in my IBD yesterday that Zoe's Kitchen was going public today. So why not write a review.

My first experience with Zoe's Kitchen was a couple of years ago at a CMYE at this location. I thought it was good but unfortunately too far from the house or work. Well, since the office moved nearby, I go here about once a week.

I order the 2 Chicken Kabobs which comes with a Greek Salad, rice and a few very small pitas. I really enjoy this meal even though I think it's a bit too pricey. I saw a couple of dudes enjoying the Steak Kabobs the last time I was in there, so I'll probably order that next time.

"My eyes adored you,
Though I never laid a hand on you,
My eyes adored you.
Like a million miles away from me,
you couldn't see,
How I adored you.
So close, so close and yet so far." - "My Eyes Adored You", Frankie Vallie & the 4 Seasons

I loved "Jersey Boys"!!  The musical retelling of how the group last known as "The 4 Seasons" came to be, starting at the humble beginnings of standing underneath a streetlamp in New Jersey.  I'm a big fan of Franki Valli's music & getting to see how he became the multimillion selling, international hit singer had me hooked from the moment the lights came on.

The actor who portrayed Frankie Valli was dynamite!!!.  He hit those high notes like a champ.  To me, he resembled the Brazilian race car driver, Helio Castroneves.  The supporting cast also did a magnificent job during the show.  We had primo seats, 5 rows from the stage, in Row D.  Looking around, all the seats seem to have a good view, but I must say I loved my vantage point.  

FYI, there is typical "Jersey talk" used during the show, aka profanity, & there is also some gun action/blood.  Therefore, I wouldn't recommend taking the little ones.  There is an 8 minute intermission with a handy countdown timer displayed on the stage, for those wanting to make sure they get back just in time.

I defy anyone not to sing along & have the catchy songs of Frankie Valli & the 4 Seasons in their head for the rest of the night & the day after, as well.  I immensely enjoyed "Jersey Boys" at Paris Las Vegas from beginning to end.

I highly recommend you come & catch a performance of one of the greatest shows on The Strip!

I love Public House this was my second time here. The restaurant is located in the Venetian hotel. Let's keep this simple. 
Food we ordered all appetizer.
Poutine with duck confit and Stout gravy was delish,but it wasn't the best. Make sure to add  a fried egg to it. 
Lamb Meatballs was awesome. The tomato sugo,and the herb bread crumbs was on point. The lamb meatballs was cook perfectly. Highly recommend.
Steak Tartare. This for me was my favorite dish. The tenderloin was super tender. The capers beer mustard dressing was wonderful. What made the dish even more was the perfectly poached egg. That made the dish rich and creamy. Get this dish with the poached egg extra ($2.50).
Southern Fried Quail was fantastic. The quail fried perfectly crispy layer and very moist in the inside. Had a lot of great flavor going on.
And lastly The Foie Gras Torchon. This one I was a little disappointment with. So past on it. 
As for the drinks Huge selection of wonderful craft beers. 
The service was great and helpful. You'll see me around public house again.

I like Firehouse Subs for their premium tasty sandwiches, they're absolutely outstanding!  

Recently I've found it somewhat harder to swallow their premium prices.

Years ago, the late Clara Peller became famous for her TV commercial "Where's the Beef?", while complaining at a burger place called, "Home of the Big Bun".

While Firehouse isn't that bad, they are close and Which Wich isn't too far behind either for the same reason.  I'm tired of trying to figure out who is giving out 3oz, or 4oz of deli meat on their subs.  

What I truly enjoy is a creative, well made sandwich, that has er, some beef on it, or in Firehouse's case, some meat.  

Quiznos went though bankruptcy, I believe because they forgot that consumers could see them weighing the meat on a scale, and then removing a slice or two when it was too much.

Okay, here's my beef (pun intended).  A group of us came here for lunch and universally found our checks in the $11.00 range.  So that's a sandwich 12" long, meat, chips and a drink.  How much does a 1/4 lb of the most expensive deli meat cost at Fry's or AJ's?

Sadly, we've found it easier just going to Jimmy Johns down on Chandler Boulevard, asking for double meat and paying $9.50 for the same setup.

I give the manager of this location high marks for draining the liquid from the heated pastrami/corn beef NY Steamer after it came out of the oven.  I was in a Firehouse in Florida recently where they forgot to do this and the sandwich just a mushy mess.

In summary, "Yes, I am a Fan" of Firehouse Subs, particularly for all the local Outreach they do for our Bravest. But I only hope they consider taking their thumb off the scale and put some real meat on those sandwiches. 

Enjoy!

I was here shopping in Scottsdale's Old Town just around lunch time. I got hungry so I checked the best place for lunch in the area on Yelp and found The Mission, was highly rated. It was across the street from where I was standing so we headed that way.

When we arrived we were able to get a table in the outside courtyard in the front of the restaurant. We informed the waiter we had very little time for lunch. The three of us ordered margaritas with salt at $8 each. They charged an extra $2 for one with Cointreu. We ordered two Almejas Al Vapor stews for $14 each and one shaved Kale salad for only $10. The shaved kale salad consisted of aji amarillo vinaigrette, baby heirlooms, blood orange, goat cheese & marcona almonds. My friend loves kale. The Almejas Al Vapor is a peruvian clam stew, rock shrimp, chorizo, pan de yucca, aji amarillo & roasted corn. I especially enjoyed the unusual appearance and spice of the stew. See my pic. The stew made me want to go to Peru for some more. I have never been to Peru. 

The waiter was very expeditious in serving us.

My total bill for the three of us for lunch was a very reasonable $69 without gratuities and we were all happy with our meals, margaritas and service.

Why'd the chicken cross the road?
To get to Food Truck Fridays in Downtown Phoenix!

I know that all you business Yelpers go out for lunch on Friday's, it's basically a rule if you sit in an office, a cubicle, or behind a desk somewhere from Monday through Friday; don't believe me, check the company hand book you were given on your first day of work. Somewhere between how to comb your hair, what you shouldn't wear, and please don't come in smelling like Nair, you'll find it. While Yelping about your Friday lunch is purely optional, I certainly hope you do ;-)

During your weekly 1 hour exodus into the space beyond the cubicles and plaster walls, ending up in the open air of Food Truck Friday will kick off your weekend right. It's not just for Burger King people, it's time to get it your way! 

Pick your favorite food from, Gourmet Hot dogs with Short Leash, or Mexican with Luncha Libre, Smoothies and Salads with Mojo Bowl, to Pies with Mama Toledos, and Creme Brulee with Torched Goodness. Bring your friends and your favorite gal; they can choose their own favorite too. Don't worry about bringing cash, everyone here will swipe your plastic just as easy.

This is your lunch hour, kick back and forget about work while you're here, if only for 45 minutes. Listen to the DJ's spinning popular music through their thumping sound system while you dine on your fine food. Chill out in the seating area which is cordoned off with misters, fans, and swamp coolers; bringing down the temp from a roasting 108 to a palatable upper 90's. 

This is your Downtown business Yelpers, it's time to kick off those business casuals, and make Friday lunch your own!

Woof woof, *pant*, *pant*, *pant*, woof woof  (I'll get back to this).

Keeping it real, this is an eatery created by a marketing group for a TV personality rather than a chef driven restaurant.  Words like fresh, farm raised, organic are replaced by outta bounds, awesome, righteous,  slam dunk, mack daddy.  The flavors are very bold, bordering on over the top.  Most components of a dish compete rather than compliment.    Not a big deal if you spent the evening smoking a couple of cigars or killed your pallet on a packs of cigs.

For "shareable",  respectable "sashimi won-taco" (fried won ton skin shaped like a taco shell filled with ahi mixed with a mango jicama salsa and topped with an odd sweetened soy and a wasabi aioli).  Passable but the aioli adds a flabbiness to the dish and obscures the flavor of the fish.  The "fondue dippers" are bizarre.  Breadsticks are wrapped in pepperoni then self dipped into a fondue of  oil stabilized provolone, sausage, and tomato.  Fans of a greasy pizza will be right at home.

On to the sandwiches and burgers:

"Come Rod.  Come here boy.  Sit.  Awww that's a good boy.  Now shake hands.  Awww Rod's a good doggie".

Contrary to what my ex might say, I'm not a dog.  I don't expect my meal to be tossed on a plank, burger falling over, only half on the bun, toppings and sauce spilling everywhere and fries thrown on for good measure.

A "big dipper" features tender slices of prime rib, smothered by melting pepper jack cheese, topped by over seasoned deep fried onions in a garlic spread with excessive, bitter horseradish.  Impossible to pick up, grease and oil mask the flavor of the beef.  The "off-da-hook smash burger" sports a decent mix of beef but obliterated by the cloyingly sweet, excessive bourbon bbq sauce.  They claim the bun is brioche, honestly the sauce kills the taste buds.  Finally the "mac-n-cheese bacon burger"  Cloying, greasy, way over the top.  The overstuffed burger is impossible to pickup and messy to eat.  A side of flavorful but soggy fries accompanies all selections.

Props for service.  Fast and attentive.  

Great for the Vegas tourist looking for the show.  Locals and regulars look elsewhere.

Vegas, day 50.  Final day of a successful WSOP.  Celebratory / farewell dinner for my poker buds.  Only one place fitting enough for this meal; Gourmet Magazines number one Thai restaurant in North America. 

It's unpretentious in an unassuming neighborhood. Looks can be deceiving, be prepared for a true culinary adventure.  This isn't your average neighborhood Thai restaurant.  Tamarind paste, not ketchup in the pad Thai.

Tip:  The menu is huge.  Expert on Thai food, study it in advance else let the servers guide you.  Allow the servers to suggest spice levels as well so dishes compliment not over power each other.

The meal usually consist of numerous dishes served at once.  It create a play of complimenting and contrasting flavors that collectively make the experience. If forced to find standout dishes:

Issan Sausage (a grilled sour pork sausage.  The natural sweetness of the pork shines through in this simple yet perfectly balanced sausage).

Sua Rong Hai (broiled beef tenderloin in a spicy, sweet sauce.  Tender with the spices bringing out the sweetness of the beef).

Plar Dook Kar-Prow Krob (Deep fried whole catfish topped with sauted fresh chili, garlic, and basil.  Earthy, fiery, absolutely delicious against the crisp, slightly overcooked catfish).

Charbroiled prawns (Extra large prawns grilled and served with a spicy, tangy tamarind sauce.  Beautiful balance again with the spices heightening the natural sweetness of the prawn.  The charbroiling adds a good bitterness).

Garlic prawns (lightly battered, deep fried with shells on in a fresh, peppery garlic sauce.  Just good eats).

Massive wine list (Wine Spectator Best Award of Excellence) with over 600 selections.  Heavy emphasis on Germany and France (Rieslings).  Very inexpensive.

And to the annoying ladies dining next to us commenting on our unrefined choice of utensils and wasteful over ordering:  (1) Thai etiquette dictates you use your fork to put food on your spoon and only put your spoon in your mouth,  (2) you don't ask for chopsticks, and (3) it is rude not to leave some food on the serving dishes and your plate.

Always a great culinary adventure.

OUTSTANDING seafood.

"That was really good.  What was it?" asks my Midwest white friend

"Spicy jellyfish with bean curd" is my straight face response.

"Huh?  So what is this?" he stupidly continues.

"Um, sea cucumber with abalone"; again straight faced.

"What?!?" With great exasperation in his voice.

"And this is Santa Barbra Spot Prawns with their egg clutch, deep fried crab with fermented black beans, steamed live fish with ginger onion, and the soup was made from tiger shark fin".

"I think I'm going to be sick" is all he can say.  Sorry I can't help but to explode in laughter.

Joyful House is a Cantonese seafood restaurant for the initiated.  I'm not sure if I should even write this review.  It's one of those places that long time Asian Vegas locals cherish.  Yes its won the "Best of Vegas" from the Review Journal but that barely speaks to it's hidden greatness.

So maybe they need to get to know you before they reveal their secrets, persist.  For example, you MUST ask for their spot prawns with the eggs.  Yes, they are now $12 each but they are worth every penny.  Eggs exploding in your mouth with the essence of fresh shrimp.

The spicy jellyfish was excellent.  Clean oceanic flavor accented by sesame and chili oil, and a touch of soy.  The sea cucumber with abalone, a tender sweet explosion of sea flavor.

Don't hate me but this is one of the few places that still uses real shark fin.  While I deplore fining and think it's inhumane, I couldn't resist.  It's been 12 years since I had the real thing.  Add a jigger of Remy XO, perfect.

This is not your typical Cantonese restaurant.  Yes, if you choose, they make great Americanized favorites (beef broccoli. shrimp fried rice, "Peeking duck", lemon chicken, shrimp with honey walnuts) but ultimately only those in the know will experience it's greatness.

Shhhhh.  Not for everyone.

I had this crazy fantasy that Mario Batali himself was in the back grinding up Carnevino's riserva, ribeye and porterhouse cuts to be made into patties.  Not exactly the case but the guys behind one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas definitely know beef.  So a visit here was inevitable despite the mixed reviews.

Before B&B burger opened, Batali himself said "The food will be easier to accept if you've never heard of me."  Everyone comes to expect so much with his name on the front.  

My verdict: a damn good burger!  We ordered what most reviewers got and also what the servers recommended.  The "Morning After" was everything I want in a good burger.  The patty was a very juicy medium rare.  The egg on top looked and tasted so perfect upon my first bite which then turned into a beautiful mess of yolk everywhere.  The bun itself was excellent with a kind of croissant quality to it.  I was only able to notice it after eating part of the bun separately though.  The royale with cheese was also very good and my wife preferred this more with all its caramelized onion glory.

I still would have paid more for a riserva patty though :)

I don't really want to put art, and the experience of it into text. Because good art transcends it. 

It won't do you much good - for me to oooo and aaaah over the hours spent wandering through a large poignant building of installation art pieces. Describing in extreme detail all of the sounds, sensations, and lack of both which I experienced in each art piece. 

Nope - it won't do either you or me - any good.

Especially when I have a word limit here.

Cause you won't be able to picture what I type. No matter how hard I try. I'll ruin the surprise of certain exhibits. The mystery.  And it will only frustrate me - that I can't convey how intrinsically cool and alluring the Mattress Factory is.

I mean the name alone is cool. Sexy even.

But. I will tell you that you should go.

If you're in Pittsburgh for even a couple of hours. Don't waste time on things like food, sports, or anything else you may have planned on doing. Just go to the Mattress Factory. 

Go alone if you have to.

But even better.

Find someone that you enjoy spending time with. Someone who lets you say "that's so cool...." over and over again about every exhibit. Someone who may even see each piece the way you do. Or maybe not.

And then just pass away the day at the Mattress Factory. Wandering and experiencing. You won't have to worry about uptight museum people following you around. Or tired tourists. Or "is that it?" art. Or sterile marble floors - which echo with every step. You just don't need to worry about much when you go here. 

The Mattress Factory is the perfect place to let yourself slip. If even a little.

It's a special, one of a kind place, nestled in a random neighborhood, away from the hustle. Away from packed bars. 

Away from it all.

I went here on a Friday after work for some dinner. The parking can be a challenge so have some patience. 

I have had this place bookmarked for several years but I have never really found myself in the area to take advantage of this place. I was trying to decide on a couple of Korean dishes. There was one that was cooked in a skillet with rice and the dish that I finally chose was the Spicy Korean dish with beef and noodles. I'm really not a more spicy the better aficionado. I don't mine a little heat as long as it compliments the meal. I thought the spiciness to this dish was just right. They give you a huge portion and our waiter was always there to refill my water glass because my mouth was en fuego at times.

The cost was under $12 and a good deal for the amount of food received. The service was excellent and my wife really enjoyed this place as well. I will be back!

I have been somewhat flummoxed over how to rate Which Wich.

I believe Which Wich does a nice job making a pricey average sandwich in a quirky feeling store (see photo of the Arrows).

We have been here several times and came yesterday after receiving a coupon by email for a free Regular (Small). My friend used my punch card for a free tenth one.  What that means is that they credit your bill for $5.50.

We both ordered the brown, thinly sliced roast beef. Which Wich defines their sizes as Regular 7", Large 10" and Super 14" You have the option of adding various veggies, or toasting it a la Quiznos. Like Quiznos, Which Wich weights how much meat you get and I would imagine that Regular has about 3 ounces. 

It's only a guess on my part since there is a five foot wall separating you and the person preparing your sandwich.  Why would you not want me to see how you are preparing my sandwich?

My friend's sandwich didn't weight that much when I picked it up.  I ordered the Large 10" (photo) with double meat (a $3.00 up charge). It felt like what a regular would feel like at Jimmy Johns or Jersey Mikes.  So you are paying $5.50 for a 7" sandwich which has about the same meat that Subway puts on their $3.00 six inch.  Yep I know, it's not really a 6 inches.  

In summary, that's $8.50 for a sandwich which would be $5.95 at Jimmy Johns, or $6.95 at Jersey Mike's (all prices do not include taxes).  Good thing they were comping me $5.50. LOL

My suggestion...  drive a little further down FLW to get a better sandwich and a better deal. Sorry.

With suitcases in hand we checked this place out to satisfy my curiosity about Michael Mina. I've heard his name thrown around here and there when the conversation is about restaurants. Why is he famous? Why does have so many restaurants??

NEW ENGLAND CRAB & LOBSTER ROLLS ($17) - 3 pieces of warm bread with crab & lobster goodness on top. Scrumptious!

SEARED FOIE GRAS ($25) - It was perfectly seared and buttery. It also had an apple compote that made it super sweet, super yummy!

FRENCH FRIES ($7) - Perfectly salted and perfectly crunchy.

BEIGNETS ($9) - So warm, so soft, and so sugary! Then I dipped it in the chocolate caramel sauce....ohmanohmanohman, I was in pure ecstasy! The salty caramel ice cream was a delightful bonus to this dish!

CHRIS-TINI ($14) - There was something beyond sweetness, something odd and sour that made me a bit dizzy. I liked it!

SUMMER FLING ($14?) - So good yet so bad...The first sip wormed its way into my brain and made me giddy!

SERVICE - There was 1 to 2 people standing in each corner watching the dining room. At least they were on it when we needed something. But as the restaurant got busier, we saw less and less of our waiter. We had to flag him down when I wanted to order dessert, when we wanted more drinks, and when we were ready to pay. But my tummy was happy so I wasn't upset with the wait. And props to the manager for hiding our suitcases in his office.

After a few appetizers and drinks I kind of understood why Michael Mina is known by a lot of foodies. AHHHH...dining here was a great way to end this Vegas trip! Now I'm curious about the other Michael Mina restaurants!

Went there on opening weekend on Saturday.

1.  A billion stair-steps everywhere.  I had fun watching drunk girls trip and fall all over the place.  TROLOLOLOL, loads of laughter.  Someone is going to fall and die and they will get sued and eventually shut down.  You would think being built by Asians, this place would have better engineered walk-ways and lighted staircases, but NOPE.  Instead they hire a bouncer to hold a flashlight to shine each and every staircase.  Kids, this is why you go to college.

2.  Do we really need an Asian themed club?  AS IF THERE AREN"T ENOUGH ASIANS IN VEGAS CLUBS.  Yeah I said it, I'm Asian too, UMAD?  Can we have some diversity?  This way, we won't scare all the White girls and Hispanic girls, you know, the ones actually capable of flirting and talking to strangers instead of the circle jerk AZNs.

3.  No outside patio!!  Some times I just want to connect with a smart girl and stare at her big, beautiful eyes, and tell her my awesome stories instead of just getting bumped by Rotunda and have armpit sweat slapped on my face.  Can't beat XS' outdoor patio.

4.  They don't give out tap water!  The bottle water is 9$!  I didn't come here to drink and get stupid, I came here to flirt, and being the stingy Asian that I am, I think 9$ for water is a really bad deal.  My six pack requires a lot of babysitting and no thanks alcohol.  Asian girls: don't ask me to buy you a drink or if I have a table... especially those of you coming from LA.  It makes you sound really classless and ghetto.  You're not a princess and you're not entitled to free things.  Mommy spoiled you too much.

If you're a nerdy Asian guy who is tired of being BETA and put in the FRIEND ZONE by your rude bitchy Asian female friends and you want to be alpha, aesthetic, and learn how to pick up girls in Vegas or anywhere for that matter, hit me up.  Here is a video of me in Vegas.

When in Rome, eat pizza.

If you're in Buffalo, NY, you must have wings.

West Tropicana and Jones Blvd??  Chicken fried steak.  

I'll call it CFS from here on out but "Chicken from Satan" might be a better acronym.

It's rare that I get out of bed early enough on a Sunday to check out any of the dizzying array of excellent brunches around Vegas.  So when my first 2 planned spots went to hell, I chose to eat my feelings at the Black Bear Diner.  Anyone that works here will tell you that CFS is the most popular dish.  They were coming out of the kitchen and into the packed dining area like an assembly line.

Beef that is breaded and deep fried like chicken is kind of a mind blowing thing for non-Americans.  I had to repeat how my entre was being prepared to my Japanese wife twice.  It was a lot to wrap her head around and it should!!  According to BlackBearDiner.com, the CFS with hash browns, gigantic biscuit and 2 eggs totals 1580 total calories, 70 grams of fat, 20 grams of saturated fat, 4870 mg of sodium and 170 grams of carbs.  Holy....fucking.....shit.  This is the exact opposite of Crossfit.  CrossFAT!!

Funny how "comfort food" always makes me feel like death at the end.  Good thing the urgent care center across the street stays open late.

Buh, whaddaya mean you don't have chocolate cactus? ;p

Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden is a free & worthwile distraction when you want to be away from the Strip for awhile, but still close enough to head back to continue availing yourself of sinful debauchery and/or losing your entire savings account.  

The Cactus Garden greets visitors as they arrive.  When I went, I admittedly wasn't a huge cactus fan.  I dunno - maybe it's the spines, maybe it's the phallic looking Saguaro cactus.  Cactus just wasn't my cup of tea.  Ethel M has an assortment of cacti on display, which I've read are adorned with lights during the Holiday season.  My horticultural buddy, who collects cacti, has given me various fruiting cacti like the Peruvian Apple cactus, which has made me appreciate the hardy & resourceful cactus.  If I were to go back, I would look at the garden with a more loving glance.

The Chocolate Factory is a self-guided tour.  Visitors read the various displays on the voyage of a caocao bean into fancy packaging.  The highlight of course, free samples!  Halfway through the tour, visitors get their choice of sample - milk, dark or white chocolate.  I may have obtained a couple samples via a few well-timed out walkthroughs ;p  The tour ends in the chocolate shop, with the chocolates fetching a pretty hefty price.  Looking for more familiar choices?Then, on the left is.............

M&M's World!  Purveyor of all things M&M.  Lots of cute lil knickknacks for the M&M lover.  I remember seeing a chess set, which is pretty dope.  It was interesting to see all the items available to buy, but nothing that I wanted to take home.  Now, if they had M&M colored nipple stickers, then M&M's World would be in business.  I'm Asian, so they'd be milk chocolate M&M's ;p
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Overall, a cool free place to check out while you're in Vegas.

Recommend!

I moved from a condo to a house 6 streets away but wanted to use movers to move the heavy furniture. I found the glowing reviews on Yelp and decided to give them a try.

I called to schedule my move in date 5 days before my move and they were able to accomodate. The representative on the phone was very nice and knowledgable, explaining everything about the process and an estimated cost based on the size of my condo and number of furniture.

They called a couple days before the move to affirm the date and time, and then the movers called an hour before the scheduled time to let me know their arrival time. The movers were all very professional, very nice, and very attentive. Any items they weren't unsure about where to place it, they asked before moving it in. They also moved a couple pieces of furniture around since I wasn't completely sure where I wanted everything to go.

Finally, I decided that morning that I wanted to switch out the washer and dryer between the condo and the house. Without hesitation, they said they'd be happy to do that, so they swapped them out and hooked them up in the two places without any complaints.

Given that I was only having them move my furniture and I moved all my "stuff" myself, I did think it took them quite a while to move everything, but that's because they wrapped all pieces of furniture in plastic wrap before loading them on the truck and were very careful with all my furntiure. I had an antique large bookcase that they successfuly moved without any wear or tear.

If you're looking for a cheap and quick place to move your stuff, this is not the company for you. But if you have good quality furniture that needs gentle care in moving between two locations, I would definitely recommend them.

Well Happy New Year everyone!

I was in the area and remembered there was a Luke's of Chicago nearby.  Sadly, to paraphrase Shakespeare's Hamlet: "Alas, poor Luke (Yorick)! I knew him" well!  

Seems the Chicago dog placed closed a while ago, replaced with the 5 minute pizza place Fired Pie. We have a Fired Pie up on Northsight in Scottsdale.  It too has moved into a former Chicago dog place, in that case Al's Beef.

I arrived around 1:45 and had only a few folks ahead of me in line.  I ordered their Tomato Basil (see photos) adding saut onions and mushrooms.  It came to only $7.75 which has to be a steal.

There was a nice amount cheese and sauce, with a hint of garlic.  It had a nice flavor and made me think of more expensive pizza places like Pomo's Cucina. The only drawback is that it's an "ultra thin" pie which they press out ahead of time (again see photos).  On the plus side, Fired Pie also has a small wine and beer list

So Four Stars, and yes I am a Fan.

As I walked up to will call about thirty minutes to showtime, I was astounded at the line of people to the right of the Crown Theater entrance.  "Damn! Is it like this every night?" I asked the box office person.  "Every Saturday night." he said.  You'd think that the actual "King of Pop" himself was about to hit the stage.  Fortunately, I had golden circle seats and avoided all of that.  Maybe tip the guys working the front to get in early and dodge that whole debacle or fake an injury, start limping and tell them you need to be seated immediately.  It was 90 percent full.    
    
MJ's Live?  Four different cast members play him throughout the week.  We were fortunate to see Justin Dean.  The moves and mannerisms were as believable as they could possibly be.  To his credit, I had a hard time telling when he was actually singing or lip-synching.  He would switch from singing into his headset mic and then to a regular handheld throughout while still wearing the headset which was kind of weird but whatever.

The audience took everything over the top.  One guy at the table up front was sporting a full on MJ Jheri curl hairstyle with sunglasses that he wore the entire time.  At another table was an adorable 3 year old with his own plastic mic that danced his face off, and even did some pop star poses with the guitar player.  Then there were the folks looking for a complete suspension of disbelief and going batshit crazy the whole hour.  "OMG! We luuuuvvv you Michaaaaaaaaal!"  Someone needed a Pepsi.

I can't find the exact word for all of it, but there was a fun, schlocky, "am I really being entertained by this right now?" vibe to the whole deal.  Kids would love it.  3.5 stars.

ToGo isn't quite the new kid in town, but they are trying hard to make a go of it in the Valley.  

ToGo's origins are NorCal, with a huge following there.  Here, they've met with mixed results so far, closing some locations including one in Scottsdale. 

Their choice of locations have been somewhat puzzling, with no natural customer base like a school or large office park nearby. The other nearby Togo's location (Chandler/Tempe border) is tiny and shoehorned next to a Fry's.  I've driven past it many times not knowing it was there, but this one is much larger. 

My two co-worker and I made a trip here for a late 1:30 lunch one Friday. There was only five or six other here. So it gave us time to chat with the Manager and have him give us a nice introduction and overview to Togo's.

The subs were very good. But the bomb is their Pastrami. It's a killer. Expect to pay $8 including a drink for a small sub, or $10 for the large waist buster. LOL

There's also a frequent diners card and an email club you can join to get online specials. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free drink, see photo. 

So the three of us are now Fans and enjoyed our Four Star meal.

Oh Ma Gawd! Samantha needs to get her sweet little ass to Talavera. Then she would have her best meal so far. This certainly ranks as one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. From the lobby of the masculine Four Seasons (like Ralph Lauren masculine, not Martina Navratilova masculine) to the bar to our own private dining room, everything was simply outstanding. 

Chef Frank Robertson had prepared a special seven course meal for our party, we just had to select our own entree and the decision was agonizing. I went with lobster served with corn, baby squash and cabbage. Perfection! Preceding my entree we had three amuse bouche; Blue Fin Tuna Poke, Sesame, Avocado ; Heirloom Tomato and Burrata, Basil, Orange Olive Oil, Balsamic and I'll be darned if I don't remember the third.

 Did I mention we had predinner cocktails? Belvedere and freshly squeezed grapefruit juice for me and a round of Absolut LA drinks for most of the others. And the wine. It was pouring like Morton salt. My favorite was a Carneros Pinot Noir. Like drinking liquid velvet! Other foodies raved about the filet, the scallops and the sea bass. Prices for entrees ran from high 20s to mid 40s. Worth every penny. Dessert for us were several plates of sweets...small pieces of various delights from truffles to cakes and pecan bites. I felt like Lucy on the chocolate factory line. Dare I say I stashed a few in my cleavage for the ride home? 

Misc:
Service was five stars all the way. Thanks to all who made our party special.
The long fire "pit" outside is fabulous.
Views of the Valley....uh...maze...ing!
Cloth handtowels in the restrooms. Nice touch. Cotton is afterall the fabric of our lives. 
Chocolate does tend to melt when nestled between your shirt and your chest. 

Cheers my yelpitas. Here's to a fabulous winter in Arizona!

The four of us came here for lunch and had a great time.

Spinato's has a nice ambiance as you enter and you will notice a great many Chicago posters, such as Illinois Central, Chicago Worlds Fair and B&W photos of the bridges crossing the Chicago River. Nice!

The food is equally good. The four of us each ordered different pizzas but really enjoyed the flavor.  This not your classic Chicago deep dish place, so you might be surprised by the thin crust cut into squares.  We really enjoyed it, and reminded us of the Edwardo's chain.  http://www.edwardos.com/

The pizza also has that sweet tomato sauce they served in St. Louis.  My friend Marvin A. is right, "it's over the top" sweet.  And it will surprise you when you first try it, but it works well.  In St Louis, they use Provel cheese which has a more buttery and creamy taste.  But here the manager Tim assures me they use mozzarella.  Still, it was very good.  

We enjoyed Spinato's and will be back.

Enjoy!

Well well well... I'm the first to review the new Dick's location. Of course I am. I can already hear this review screaming ROTD and I haven't even written it yet... 

1. I'm not gay. This is probably the fourth Yelp in which I've disclosed this. It's not important because you should care what my orientation is but so that you can get a sense of this place from the hetero-perspective.   

2. Many people think I'm in the closet. So if you're rolling your eyes at number one, you're not alone. 

3. Granted, my speech patterns and flamboyant style are confusing, especially if you're from the midwest.* 

4. People are gonna think what they want and life is just really, really good anyway. 

5. I was DD one night and we were driving from E. McDowell to Cenpho. Someone, who shall remain nameless, screams from the back seat, "DICKS!" 

6. We go.

7. The two ladies I "brought" loved it. 

8. One of the dancers is "huge." I want one of those. 

9. I can appreciate male beauty. There were maybe one or two pretty dudes but the rest were just ridiculously fit. Six packs and the like... 

10. Apparently, three more minutes of the grind and my lady friend was gonna not be not actively orgasming. She was with the "huge" dude. 

11. She went back the next night. 

12. My other friend's personal dancer said, "I think I'm enjoying this more than you are." I hang with some sexy ladies. I'm very lucky. 

13. It's fully nude if I haven't made that clear. 

14. There is a no cell phone use policy, which I had no idea they would enforce. 

15. Punishment for using cell phone: The most twinkish dancer among them came over and started grinding in my crotch with his ass. Like........ yeah. If that wasn't bad enough, he kept screaming "Pull my hair!" Dude. "Don't call me dude!" Sorry, Dude. "Don't call me dude!!!" "Smack my ass!" 

16. They make straight dudes pay to get in. Remedy that immediately, please. If I'm there with 2 or 7 women, and your gaydar doesn't go off, hook a brother up. 

*Just kidding middle America.

Potbelly's makes a tasty little sandwich for $4.80, and an even better one for $5.00.

I was here today with some friends for their Pre- Grand Opening slated for tomorrow. A suggested donation of $5.00 went to Scottsdale Christian Academy Baseball Team (see photo). After giving my donation, I won a free shake on their spinning wheel.  All the places were food items.

Potbelly is a yummy Midwest sandwich place that has live music in all of their shops.  The older locations have tall ceiling where a banjo, or guitar player sits on the top of the booth area while playing away.  This location has a guitar playing in the corner on the right as you come in. Very cool.

As for the food, Potbelly is known primarily for their their Wreck sub which is $5.00.  It's made with salami, roast beef, turkey and ham along with swiss cheese. They also have two similar subs called:  "Italian" with capicola, mortadella, pepperoni, salami with provolone cheese, also $5.00; and a "Pizza Sandwich" which has many of the above cold cuts but with marinara sauce.  I've had both before and they are good too.

Those are their three upscale sandwiches for $5.00, but their regular ones for $4.80 are equally good.  I particularly like the Roast Beef (which I had today, see photo), but the Turkey Breast, Smoked Ham, Meatball are all delicious.  
  
I've been told by Jim their JV Manager, that their 30% larger sandwiches, called "Bigs", will be rolled out later in the year.  Nice. You also need to try their hand-dipped shakes and smoothies. Delicious!

Enjoy!

Lord knows how many businesses have come and gone at this address over the years like Underworld, Black Label, and Emergency Room etc.  Its transformation into Gyu-Kaku has been nothing short of amazing.  The ultra cool lit entrance begged the question...does Tron eat here?  Being seated while a female sung cover of Savage Garden's "Truly, Madly, Deeply" at 300 BPM's blared through the stereo made me think it possible if he were drunk.  

We considered the course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 for a moment but saw a lot of filler that would have ended up untouched like cheese wontons, chicken cheese fondue, house salad, fried chicken (ok,ok, maybe one piece), calamari and S'mores.  Our initial server, Keiko, recommended we start with the spicy cabbage salad over the kim-chee.  Thankfully, we listened.  Crispy, spicy and dare I say refreshing?  It was a fine way to whet our appetite.        
 
Standing out among with meats was the beef tongue and harami skirt steak.  Quality matched the price and both delivered on what decent yakiniku should be.  We also enjoyed the kalbi short rib and although the Angus beef ribs were a little too fatty for the wife, I happily devoured it.  The mushroom medley cooked in an unbeatable combination of soy sauce and butter was a nice side dish.  

The only letdown was the "Spicy Kalbi Bibimbap".  They got the stone pot right but the rest of it?  It was as if it were made by a northern Swedish resident with no knowledge of Korean cuisine attempting to replicate it through hearsay.  I would have rather ordered the sliced duck breast, an atypical yakiniku offering, or dessert over this pointless filler.  

Despite that, I know I'll be back and stick to grilling.  It's yet another welcome dining choice around Spring Mountain.  3.46729311238987 stars.

In 24 hours...

You are committed to getting your dinner, midnight snack, breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, pre-dinner and dinner again.  Well, that was my original plan when I first heard about this deal but here's what really happened...

8:11pm dinner - Caesars Palace's Bacchanal Buffet.  This is the hottest spot in town for buffets right now.  If you decide to dine here, there is a supplemental charge of $15 on top of what you already paid.  And it's for each time you decide to dine here within 24 hours. (Retail value $49.99)

9:30am breakfast - Paris Le Village Buffet.  Such a darling place to dine at. (Retail value $20.99)

3:30pm lunch - Flamingo Paradise Garden Buffet.  All the grannies and pappies dine here.  I believe they are locals.  But they have an amazing desert spread and the food was not too shabby. (Retail value $19.99)

6:15pm dinner - Planet Hollywood The Spice Market Buffet.  We were still full from lunch but forced ourselves to sit and eat more crab and nibbled on everything else.  Since this was our last buffet stop, I made sure I enjoyed as much crab as I could squeeze into my already bloated belly. (Retail value $29.99)

Did I get enough to eat?  Yes
Did I get my money's worth?  You bet I did
Was the supplemental charge at Caesars worth it?  Yes, it was
Would I do this again?  Hell no!

We planned our entire day around making it to these buffets and it added in some unnecessary stress.  I did it, I loved it, I won't be doing it again.  But for those of you who love to eat buffets, then this is seriously the best deal in town.  Go for it.

Cost savings analysis!
Paid $49.99 + $15 = $65
Retail value $49.99 + $20.99 + $19.99 + $29.99 = $120.96
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAVINGS!!!!  $55.96 

OR

$65/4 meals = $16.25 for each buffet (winning!)

Just don't throw up afterwards, then you'll really get your values worth :)

Who you callin a Byatch! Bow down for your master! 

I read my first reviews of Bachi a while back and bookmarked it away for a Vegas trip.

Thanks Dave G. and Craig R for enlightening me to the way of the Bachi Burger. My journey is now only 1/2 complete as this young grasshopper is ready to fly, again the voices of Dave & Craig come creeping into my mind. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=TECziqmB2XZ4E5psSvvKJw#TECziqmB2XZ4E5psSvvKJw

You must first journey to the East. Search for the Windmill and the Bermuda, the masters told me and you will find the truth.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=qU4VbIgVxtgDi-E6M_KF-w#qU4VbIgVxtgDi-E6M_KF-w

As I drove up with my top down I could smell good things going on inside. 
The masters again spoke to me. " Put up the ragtop or your rent a car will get stolen dummy"  https://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/photo/1PZEIhmTjSzNrMhMfWU6IQ/l.jpg

Finally this journey must come to an end or is it a new beginning?

FOOD:
Kiki's Burger ... Angus Beef, Sauted Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese and Garlic Chili Aioli
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cPIFhziwSrVw3V_b4mTs-Q&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

Oxtail Chili Fries ... Oxtail chili with Garlic Aioli and a Fried Egg
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-nVIFwtfBMzOLjjubXv4MA&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

TASTE:  HELL YEA!
Kiki's Burger ... one hell of a bad boy, a large burger sportin an eartty mushroom taste like an ugly redheaded stepchild at an Irish fair. This was one great burger! A true 5*****Star 

Oxtail Chili Fries ... I've had oxtail spaghetti ragu, soup, pho and even a Jamacian oxtail jerk, but never had it as a chili base before. Its marrow/ gelatin rich flavor is an awesome boot in the pants to an otherwise plain beef chile. I reccomend this for anyone going to Vegas.. It kicks tail!

My masters are calling me back to Anaheim. http://www.yelp.com/biz_user_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA/upload?upload_finished=1&successful%5B%5D=JqImqMytH8fVTrxRkv14mg

SERVICE:   here is off the hook, you know they got a good thing going and make sure you do too. Clean, polite and willing to help you find the right food for your taste.

I'll be back to try so many things that my stomach would not let me this time.

I over heard that one is opening in LA sometime soon, Bachi Burgers, On Sawtelle in W. LA., Sign me up masters!

Rosati's Pizza is my go to pizza joint. They are basically a carry out place. I live too far away for delivery. So that tells you how far I'll travel for an excellent tasting pizza.

They currently have this special where you buy a large and get the medium (excludes the toppings) 1/2 off. I hope I haven't let the secret out on that special. It's been going on for well over a year. I always bump into a lot of Chicago people when in here. I always get a bigger pizza than I can eat since it's the perfect breakfast food. After all, who can resist some reheated pizza the next morning for breakfast!

I really like the thin crust but my family prefers the deep dish. So I'm stuck eating deep dish all the time, lol. This is the best tasting pizza I have had in Arizona. The Cenpho folks might want to venture out of their box and try this pie. This is something even the east coasters would enjoy. 

Once in awhile they'll even mess up your order but they are quick to rectify it if you give them a chance. And once in awhile they'll even burn your pizza a little. Even with these rare annoyances I keep coming back to this Rosati's location every time.

Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat

Marquee Nightclub was packed. The music was thumpin' and the drinks were flowin'. Who cares if there were more dudes on the crowded dance floor than ladies? We were there to jump and dance ... and after quickly staking out a spot in the middle near the front, that is exactly what we and a few hundred of our new best friends did.

Tip #1: Stay at the Cosmopolitan. Go online and book a room because it includes free admission to Marquee through a much shorter line. It'll also give you a place to freshen up before hitting the club and crash/party afterwards. Ask for a room in the East Tower for convenience to Marquee.

Marquee Mondays makes Marquee a reason to stay in Sin City an extra day. The EC Twins and Nadia Ali performed on the Monday before Christmas and this was like an early gift from Santa.

Tip #2: Get on the main dance floor early cause by midnight it was wall-to-wall people with almost no one getting in or out. Many "couples" were frustrated with the tight quarters, so, come prepared for bumpin' and jumpin' with people from all around the globe.

DJ Lisa Pittman worked it at the pool while Eddie Makabi and another DJ pumped up the beats inside before the headliners came out around 12:30. Nadia did a 30-minute live set which had the crowd frothing and then the energy reached a peak with the frenetic twins.

Tip #3: Get a table if you aren't planning to stake out a spot on the crowded dance floor. If you are just wanting to chill at a club, the outdoor pool vibe and tables may be best or get one of the prime spots inside so you and your crew can dance in your own area.

Drinks are expensive ... of course, and table service is crazy expensive. Plan accordingly.

Marquee was a blast. We loved the vibe, the confetti, foam light sticks, blasts of cold air, and non-stop beats. If you get free admission to Marquee while staying at The Cosmopolitan then it is easily a 5-star night for any EDM fan.

We really liked Hopdoddy's fresh new variety, but found the burgers themselves a little bland.

One hiccup on our visit, as others have noted, is the service. Too many unsupervised newbies and not enough chiefs on the floor. When we arrived, we were told to wait for our greeter who would then take us to our table.  Then we were told to walk up to the counter and place our order. Grrrr

The problem was exasperated, since there was no permanent greeter. The longer we waited, the more the folks behind us started getting upset since they were outside in the heat and didn't understand the holdup.  I hope it's been fixed by now.

BTW, we very much liked the updated Philip Johnson style glass house architecture. Who would have ever thought of building a glass restaurant in the desert?  Incredible. 

Hopdoddy has a bunch of interesting choices on their menu. And, it's those choices that provide the taste for their burgers, not the meat itself. The food is very good and reminded us a great deal of a Fox Concept's Zinburger. Both offer something interesting for the palate. 

Expect to pay $20 each for drinks, burger and one appetizer.

Finally!! 

I've had the Charcoal Room on my list of eats since I moved out here a few years ago.  My neighbor, some co-workers, and even friends/family from California even recommended the Charcoal Room to me. But when it came to other Yelpers, most haven't been here or reviewed them.  The Charcoal Room has a lot of pros and very little cons.  You don't get what you pay for here, you get more.  And if you're having steak, you get a lot more.  I got their petite filet and it was delicious.  Their petite is about 6 oz, juicy, and most importantly, very tasty. Don't let the price fool you.  For less than $30, I had a steak that rivals some of the 5 star steak houses out here.  My filet was so tender that I think I used a butter knife to cut through it.  I had my steak with a side of their Caesar salad, lobster corn chowder, sauted mushrooms, and asparagus.  All portions were huge and I ended up with leftovers. My GF opted for their roasted chicken and baked sweet potato.  Her meal was hooked up too.  I swear she was served half a chicken and a football sized sweet potato.  She said her meal was good as well.  

I have no complaints about the service.  We were seated right away, our orders were taken, and our food was served in a timely manner.  I left the Charcoal Room very satisfied and my only regret is not coming here sooner.  We got a lot of food and paid less than $100 for it.  Yes...I'm sure I will be back.


PS: No pictures of their steak and no pictures of their fabulous forks.  I was focused the night I ate here....focused on my beautiful date.  1OAK!

***The rotating and constantly moving stage of Ka is very impressive; also impressive are the many cinematic elements that Ka employs, making the show feel dramatic, exciting and unique***

Ka was my first Cirque show and I enjoyed it.  The production values were great and the stage and theater were both very impressive.  The show feels like a real spectacle and with the amazing stage, Ka feels like a show that you could only see in Vegas.

There are other good things about Ka.  I really liked how they made the show cinematic.  With the music and the great lighting, there are moments in the show that feel like you are watching a movie on the big screen (the best example is when they make the stage look like its underwater and with the curtain and lighting, it appears that one of the performers is saving someone from drowning and rising to the surface--very well done).

They try to tell a story with Ka too.  It is not a great story, but the story elements kept my interest in Ka more than Mystere (which was more like a series of disjointed vignettes).  Still, after a while, I felt like I had seen enough and I got a little bored.

There are definitely some strong acrobatics, but you might not see the big and more traditional acrobatics like you would see in Mystere.  Still, there is a piece with huge moving spheres that is very exciting, suspenseful and fun.

Ticket prices for Ka are not too bad.  You can typically find tickets for a lower price than O.

The theater is nice (with a good temperature) and they had some decent concessions.  The theater is also roomy enough and does not feel as packed or hot as Mystere's theater.

I enjoyed Ka.  I am not sure if I am ever going to be a huge fan of Cirque shows, but I thought there were mainly elements of Ka that will stick with me (much more than Mystere).  With the very nice venue, the amazing stage and the great cinematic elements, Ka feels like a special and worthwhile show (definitely worth considering if you are in Vegas and looking for a good show).

Ka is in the MGM Grand, which features free parking (both valet and a parking structure--very easy to find a spot in this parking structure).

Recently I was invited to a dinner which featured several of the most famous Las Vegas Japanese restaurant owners. It was unanimous in their opinion that they believed RAMEN TATSU was the best TOKYO RAMEN-YA in America. Yes, you heard that statement correctly. TATSU is NOT a Kyushu Ramen-Ya, it is a TOKYO style Ramen-Ya that specializes in Shoyu style broth. If you don't believe me, ask the owner himself. The owners name is Wayne and he is a very respected man in the LV Japanese-American community. 

RAMEN TATSU is unique in the fact that all ingredients are natural/organic style. Wayne uses three different types of natural chicken bones for the broth in his Tokyo style ramen. He also uses three different types of natural pork bones for his Tonkotsu ramen. No other ramen-ya in Las Vegas goes this far out of their way to produce such a rich broth. Many Japanese yelpers express that the reason California(Sawtelle Blvd) ramen is so much better than LV ramen is because the California places use this style of cooking. The cook and owner has been the force behind many of the popular ramen-yas in Los Angeles. He was the man responsible for the recipes which have now achieved notoriety, the same recipes from the LA ramen-yas that attended this years Ramen festival at the Rio Casino. 

The signature dish at RAMEN TATSU is the Shoyu-Tonkotsu fusion. This variation of ramen has become increasingly popular in modern day Japan. It's origins stem from the Kobe area, where it has become a new subregional variation of ramen. On account of the fact that Wayne is from Kobe, he has many years of experience preparing this subregional variation.  The recipe at TATSU remains unchanged from the recipe from Kobe while Monta's Shoyu-Tonkotsu is not the authentic recipe, instead it is merely an invention of the Kurume cook(who is now a Brazilian dude), who mixes his Kyushu broth with a generic nonaffiliated shoyu broth. What I am expressing is that RAMEN TATSU has the only authentic Shoyu-Tonkotsu in LV. And, this is the item you should order during your next visit.  

The Curry- During your next visit at RAMEN TATSU, you should not neglect the Japanese Curry. TATSU uses their own secret recipe which facilities a unique taste which upon my assessment is superior to CoCo Ichinbanya and Kaba Curry. In a demonstration of unique cooking styles, the Chicken broth from the ramen is used as the backing for the curry. Wayne's own particular Gram Masala is then instilled into the broth, and combined with three different types of vegetables. The resulting product is curry that is as addictive as Mr. Zenbayashi's recipe. And during a recent conversation with Mr. Zenbayashi, even he verbally approved of Wayne's recipe. That is a major compliment coming from the man who runs the highest rated Curry-Ya in yelp history. 

They also have Shio Ramen which is great for older Japanese folks. A lot of older Japanese people like my Dad refuse to eat Tonkotsu and Miso Ramen, and eat nothing but Shio. 

I will argue that RAMEN TATSU is the most authentic Japanese Ramen-Ya in America. It remains true to the regional recipes in Japan, and the owner refuses to submit to western pressures to "Americanize" his recipes(as you can see, many of the negative reviews are due to the fact that the recipe is not americanized). For example, Wayne recently terminated contracts with noodle suppliers because he felt they were not completely authentic to Japanese standards. For the last few weeks, several Japanese noodle companies have been competing for the contract, while Wayne assesses and samples them all to determine which is the most appropriate. The whole reason that Tsukemen is no longer on the menu is because Wayne demanded his distributors send noodles which were 100% authentic to the dish and made in Japan. He would not accept anything lower, and would NEVER serve an item that wasn't 100% authentic to the traditional Japanese recipe. Tsukemen will return shortly from my understanding. This establishment represents the Japanese culture very proudly and will not give into the pressures to westernize the menu. This is the reason there is no Togarashi. This is the reason there is no Srirachi. This is the reason why there is no cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon. Just like the owner of Kabuto, Wayne won't breech protocol which was established in Japan by the Japanese, for the Japanese. And I respect him a lot for this. Complaining that there is no  Shichimi Togarashi at a ramen-ya is like bitching to the chef at Kabuto about why there is no California rolls while you soak your chutoro nigiri in a mixture of shoyu and wasabi that you plan on eating with a fork. I have to say that I vouch for RAMEN TATSU and encourage all the Japanese-American residents of LV to support this business. 

Just a final note- The music they play here is the theme music to the Final Fantasy games, and old school anime like Cutey Honey, Candy Candy, and the Miyazaki films

Probably the best Pad See Ew I've ever had, but let's start from the beginning...

Immediately upon walking in, I was given... bar none... the most hospitable reception in my short history of dining.  It was comprised of a greeting (including being called by name) and a hug from the cutest little thing, who I had just met.

We started off with a chicken satay app, which was accompanied by a creamy peanut sauce and cucumber salad.  Removing the delicious skewered meat from the wooden spears brought me back to days of yore, when I would covertly poke my little sister in the closest appendage, with the sole purpose of evoking a squeal, all the while under the auspices of my no-nonsense parents.

My go-to Thai dish is Pad See Ew.  I've seen it spelled differently, but I'm hip.  This dish was one to be savored.... no, to be fawned over and then savored.  Using my meticulous chop-stick skills, I pampered each delicate noodle into my quivering mouth... which evoked blissful visions of lazily floating down the Chao Phraya river... and mind you, I've never even been to Thailand.

I'm not saying the dish was laced with opium, but at some point, I do recall fancying a ride atop an Asian Elephant passing through the seven levels of the Candy Cane forest.

My lunch companion, Chris, ordered the basil fried rice, which was more akin to an architectural wonder than an entree.  Using his meticulous spoon skills, I witnessed him moving mountains... of succulent rice and fixins... never to be seen again, for at least eight hours.

And just when I thought our culinary journey was disembarking, the same vision of loveliness appeared to my right, presenting a showpiece comprised of cake, cream and maraschino cherry.

Knowing my chop-sticks would only make a mess of things, I grabbed a spoon.  It had been so long... but it felt good in my hand.  A little cold.  I raised that utensil to the sky, and with an intense bellow, I cried "By the power of GreySkull, I shall have you as my own".  As I started my initial swipe, I noticed Chris had already gotten 2 or 3 bites in during the fanfare.

BAM!  The cake was bursting with coconut gusto, or maybe it was the ice cream.  I'm embarrassed to think of what I probably looked like as I descended into that dessert feeding frenzy.

I'd like to offer apologies to any staff and/or patron within line of sight.  I don't get out much, and unfortunately whenever my taste buds are stirred up like that, its plain and simple mob mentality.  I cant get in their way!  I wont!

After paying the tab, I bid a fond adieu to the huddled kitchen crew, and noticed their horror stricken faces.  The audible syllables "Mujumbo hielan friacah" lilted through the air as I passed... which I believe meant: "Great manly warrior"... no, my bad, wrong dialect... it actually means: "Portly destroyer with awkward shirt cleavage".

I look forward to my return visit, where I will exercise self control... or maybe just exercise

Swankified and fun atmosphere, especially when you have DJ's like Afrojack and David Guetta in the house! This is a nightclub that seriously knows how to party.

Guide to having a good time at XS:

1. Go on a night with topnotch DJ's whose music you can groove to for many hours.

2. Get a VIP table + bottle service if you can fork up the money. IT'S WORTH IT.

3. Look around. Lots of interesting/strange characters!

4. Dance. Laugh. Have a good time.

The layout at XS is great because you get a great view of the DJ from almost every angle. The outdoor area features a pool where crazy antics take place. There is minimal seating for the general public -- gotta stand if you don't pay up. If you're okay on your feet for hours you'll be fine, but ladies know it is SO worth it to have a table. Not to mention service from the hostesses is excellent and they're also pretty cute.

My favorite part of the night was dancing up on the cushions of our booth seats (happy feet!). It was comfy as well as an awesome vantage point. We could see: 1) all the oddly dressed and/or super drunk people around us and 2) AFROJACK+GUETTA as they dropped those beats!

DATE TIP (Gentlemen): Make a note of the paragraph above regarding seating. The ladies will love you if you have a table. Or at least visit you to rest their feet. ;)

DATE TIP (Ladies): Cushion dancing is awesome, but at an elevated height one is much more prone to creative pickup lines. A small price to pay for the view you get!

Like other Yelpers, I found out about this hole-in-the-wall via another Yelper.  I have had it bookmarked for a while!  I haven't gone before today because they only accepted cash!  You guessed it, they accept plastic now.  Whoop.  Awesome.  

I tried the beef tongue, carne asada and chicken tacos.  I thought the tacos were amazing.  I am definitely a food venturing American and I am ashamed to admit that I just love the insides of tacos, but I usually leave the shells.  Either I was super hungry today, or those shells were amazing because, I ate all 3 shells too.  

While the tacos were great, the salsas and pickled veggies were amazing to me.  They have a salsa bar stocked with whole roasted jalapeos, pickled veggies, and regular, chipotle and green salsa.  The salsa was so yummy that I am pretty sure I ate enough of the regular salsa to have been charged for a bowl of salsa soup.  Just fantastic to me.

One nice thing, this retaurant has expanded and can accommodate small groups for lunch or dinner.  

The parking lot is small.  I saw strange things happening at the businesses mext door and I saw some kids walk in large bowls of what looked like was food for someone, I just hoped it wasnt for serving in the restaurant.  Alas....

My return factor for this place is 100% and it could very well be tomorrow!

Excalibur Hotel is child's play compared to the elite hotel resorts of Las Vegas ... at 1/2 the price tag ... making it a deal for you bargain hunters or families on vacation. If you have children or need a "beginner" hotel for the whole Vegas experience, choose Excalibur.

Welcome to the future site of a cool five-star Vegas Mecca. Once they tear this down and build a new mega-resort, you can tell your grandkids that you stayed here back when it was Excalibur. 

Until then, here's what you'll find ...

 * Hotel Rooms ... nothing fancy, but you've slept in worse (probably)
 * A Casino with lower table limits and more frowns
 * A small Sports Book for Dad to prove he was right about the home team
 * Food is like choosing a restaurant at your local mall
  ... Excalibur Buffet ($23 for dinner and less for breakfast or lunch)
  ... Buca di Beppo - American chain of Italian-style re-heated food
  ... Dick's Last Resort - The Applebee's of Vegas
  ... A Steakhouse with $41 Rib Eye Steak or a 3-course Sirloin meal for $37
  ... Baja Fresh - Mexican Fast Food
  ... Food Court with Krispy Kreme, McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Cinnabon, & more
  ... Octane Lounge (Fri/Sat) & the "Lounge" are bars for adults to reminisce
 * Entertainment is great if you're letting mom plan your trip
  ... Tournament of Kings: Jousting banquet ($66) using your hands to eat
  ... Thunder From Down Under: Mom's/Girl's Night Out ($57 - $67) - chiseled abs
  ... Australian Bee Gees - Tribute show ($45-$60) not as fun as Fallon & Timberlake on SNL
  ... Fun Dungeon is a huge arcade full of games (10am-10pm)
  ... Pool with bar & food service full of kids taking a Dungeon break
  ... Shopping is limited to mall-style boutiques for kids and mom's
  ... A Wedding Chapel - Good luck.
 * That funky aroma you smell is annoyed disappointment ... or weed

For now, Excalibur survives as a low-end property in the MGM Resorts brand (with the MGM, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay, Aria, Vdara, Mirage, and Bellagio). Its prime location on the South end of the Vegas Strip at the corner of Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd is the future site of something much, much better. Til then, Excalibur has accepted it's cheap existence and you should, too.

Surreal pool party experience. Vegas does it unlike anywhere else, and Wet Republic is no exception when it comes to getting WET!

So you know what you're getting into:

1) Getting tickets in advance substantially cuts down waiting time.
2) Arriving early (before 1pm) does the same.
3) Cabanas cost $1,500.
4) There are lockers available to stow your stuff.
5) The bar sells drinks in enormous lidded cups. Get these and you won't regret it when the splashing starts! Unless you like chlorine as part of your alcoholic mix.
6) It is calm and beautiful when you arrive early and hardly anyone is there. It gets increasingly more chaotic and cramped up through peak pool time (~3pm).

* * * Now, so you know what you're REALLY getting into: * * *

Be prepared for a poppin' party. And when I say poppin', I mean POPPIN'. Super crowded, off the chain, dope beats, crazy splashing. Beach balls are constantly flying, some that may come your way and bonk you on the head while you are distracted, completely unaware. Good thing they're only beach balls! Then the huge inflated whales start coming out. These are much heavier than the beach balls and have more of an impact on your head. But everyone is too busy dancing and having fun to care. NOTE: You can't ride the whales. You can try, but it's impossible.

By the time the headliner DJ (Steve Aoki) takes over, it becomes so rowdy both outside and inside the pool. Outside the pool, a large crowd is clamoring up by the DJ booth. Aoki sprays the crowd with champagne and even throws a large cake with white frosting at them. He is carried overhead by the crowd. Rafts and inflatable animals (flamingos, ducks, and monkeys) are deployed. It's a hot, hot mess on land!

In the pool there is so much splashing that tidal waves are straight up rolling. One guy was so ecstatic to be in the pool that as he thrashed around, he brought his hand down (with his phone) hard onto my forearm. Thanks for the enormous bruise! Of course I didn't feel it until the next morning, probably because of the booze and adrenaline. Before I know it, 4 hours have passed and the drinks and music are still flowing. Wet Republic sure knows how to make it last!

TIP: Be ready to party. Go hard or go home!

DATE TIP: You can most certainly find a date here. Enormous margaritas + dancing in the water + people in swimsuits? Oh yeah, no doubt.

Vdara is a nice hotel, but it is not a 5-star one (as advertised). Some features are nice like the in-room kitchen (that you probably won't use), electronic housekeeping and privacy status, and 2 TVs. It's the little things that make a hotel 5 stars and it is the combination of a lot of small mis-steps that lower Vdara to 3-stars.

 * Check-in/check-out - quick check-in and easy TV-based check-out 4/5

 * Room - decent size with entry kitchenette, and bed on one side of entertainment console/desk and sofa on the other 4/5

 * Bed - King size bed is standard. Couch can be a 2nd bed (good for kids?) 4/5

 * Bathroom - Seperate shower & tub (deep, but narrow with stopper in middle) with 1 sink 3/5

 * Housekeeping - 2 days didn't clean room without calling; 2 bottles of water included, but missing 2/5

 * Amenities - very basic amenities. Bonus: ask for slippers & robe 3/5

 * Pool - basic Vegas pool with stellar service. Older crowd 3/5

 * Parking - Valet only. No Self Parking 2/5

 * Location - you are off the Strip and must go thru Aria, Bellagio, or Cosmopolitan to get to the strip. Why not just stay at one of those? 2/5

 * Atmosphere - Quiet... Really quiet. Does smell great inside & is smoke free 2/5

 * Casino - none. Go elsewhere or stay elsewhere for fun 1/5

 * Restaurants - one lobby bar which is ... a lobby bar 1/5

 * View - we had a partial view of Bellagio fountains and Paris hotel 3/5

 * WiFi - "free" with $25 resort fee; worked in room, pool, and lobby 4/5

 * Value - $25 resort fee + $3 Tax adds up. So do taxi rides to actually go anywhere else. Plan at least $20/day for those, too. 2/5

 * Oddity - On 2nd day, a stranger opened our door with a key and then quickly apologized and left. Called front desk to warn them and was told "it happens sometimes." Well, not to me it hadn't before...

 * Overall - Vdara met our needs for a quiet place to sleep, but it also felt isolated and boring. We spent much of our time going to other hotels ... Hotels we could of stayed at for just a little more than Vdara.

Living up to the hype.  A warm and contemporary Italian American eatery that delivers great tastes with the energy that is Vegas.  

This is not an authentic taste of Italian regional specialties rather refined and prettied up versions of Italian American favorites.  All good, it works.

The majority of the menu centers around small plates of antipasti shared family style.  Flavors are very complimentary so ordering a wide variety of dishes works.  An incredible simple grilled broccoli rabe natural bitterness is enhanced by hints of char and smoke but brought to life by a spicy, chili vinaigrette.  Sweet peppers stuffed with a tangy goat cheese and peppery olive oil create a very well balanced dish exploding with freshness.

For seafood antipasti, do not pass on the lobster arancini.  Dressed with a spicy pomodoro of Calabria chili and a touch of a herbaceous basil aioli that elevates the sweetness of the lobster.  Slightly cloying mouth feel but great flavors.  

Great selection of well made salumi.  Try a variety.  The Bresaola and finocchiona as good as any in Tuscany.  Add a selection of cheeses with perfectly paired condiments (Mozzarella with a citrus chili pesto,  Parmigiano with honey).  

Small selection of pastas.  The lobster ravioli excellent.  Perfectly cooked sheets of pasta surrounding chunks of barely cooked through lobster perfumed by tarragon.  Richness on richness but it works.

The only weakness of the restaurant are the mains.  A mustard, walnut, and raisin crusted rack of lamb, while perfectly cooked was one dimensional, needing more herbaceous, lemony gremolata.  A bone in "Tuscan" rib-eye topped with a sunny side up egg did not make sense.   The yolk did nothing to elevate the flavor of the beef rather giving it an unpleasant yolky aftertaste as it cooled.

Service is a work in progress.  Slow and lacking confidence.  This will definitely improve with time.

Decent wine list at Vegas resort prices.

Guys, admit it, Giada turned you on to cooking shows.  Now the chance is here to try the food you know you never cooked.  Worthy.

My parents taught me, "when you don't have something nice to say, then don't say anything at all."

Yelp has taught me, "when you don't have something nice to say, tell it like it is."

Sorry mom and dad, Yelp FTW!

I like my restaurants how I like my style, un-cramped; unfortunately, this place is packed full with wall to wall tables and chairs leaving about 3 inches in between you and the guy at the table next to you. Don't plan to come here during the lunch rush with a big group, you're lucky if you can fit one or two people through the door. The parking isn't that appealing either, you are practically parked in the middle of 16th street traffic. :-/

La Condesa makes a pretty good taco, and their salsa ain't bad either. To their benefit, they do have some fairly unique salsa's to choose from, such as strawberry, peanut, and pecan; but in my opinion, unique doesn't necessarily = awesome. Any of their tacos will do you right, but my favorite is their pork.  

In my opinion, and lets face it, if you're reading my review, that's exactly what you're looking for right? La Condesa over stated when they went with Gourmet in the name. Sure, everybody likes their taco's but who wants to pay $9 for two tacos and leave feeling like they were packed in like sardines in the middle of a seedy neighborhood? If it isn't obvious yet, I don't plan on coming back soon, I can take or leave their salsas and tacos and wouldn't be bothered either way.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, hope you find that hidden taco gem you've always been searching for.

Best way to relax in Vegas before your flight home! They definitely know how to pamper you here. Two words: Free B&B (Buffet & Booze).

The lunch/dinner buffet offers light, delicious options. The highlight for me were the super tender **Braised Short Ribs** served over slow-cooked creamy polenta. Warm, savory, and juicy! Also delightful were the **Spinach & Ricotta Gnudi**, perfect little dumplings with a dash of tomato and basil. A fresh corn salad, roasted zucchini, and arugula salad were flavorful and healthy side dishes. The **Vanilla Honey Panna Cotta with Summer Berries** gave the meal a smooth finish.

A whole array of cocktails welcomes you at the bar. Just take your pick and go relax. Love this perk!

You can get some work done in the conference area or in one of the more private work booths. Or sit back and watch TV in the lounge area. Or take a sweet nap on the comfy reclining personal couches. We opted for #3 -- nap.

The decor is very mod and clean, while the setting is quiet and relaxing. My only complaint is that at one point, two employees began talking pretty loudly in Spanish. The serene vibe was slightly ruined, but I was already so content on my cozy napping device that I dozed off anyway.

Overall the service was phenomenal. You will want for nothing.

TIP: Open to AmEx members only. One-day passes are $50, or complimentary for Platinum members. Thank you, travel buddy!

This Villa Pizza is located inside the food court at Red Rock Station. I would doubt anybody makes a special trip just to eat the pizza here, but it does work out nicely after getting out of a movie for grabbing a quick bite. I wouldn't eat at the chain Villa Pizza for years since I grew up on the locally owned original, but sometimes you have to stop being stubborn which is exactly what I did. 

When I walked by I wasn't sure if I wanted to eat here or at Rubio's, then I saw a fresh cheese pizza come out of the oven and knew that I wanted a slice. The girl behind the counter was nice. A "Cheese Slice" cost $3.79 before tax. For being in a food court and a chain, the pizza was A-OK. I didn't think the price was bad, but I also shared my husbands drink from Panda Express (panda has a decent medium and large size for the price with free refills). Definitely not the best pizza in town, but is decent enough for a quick dinner. They have table and half table/booth seating in the food court area.

I have been to Marquee a few times already, but this time is THE WORST experience ever. Yeah, the lines are extremely long, the wait is probably 1-2 hours, and it was crowded in the venue...but all this still won't make me as mad and as disappointed...

Basically,  two of my friends and I had a couple drinks at the bar, then we went to the dance floor and started dancing. My friend and I decided to take another shot at the bar...While we were walking to the bar, we got stopped by the security and asked us to follow them. At this point, I thought that, "I guess I am really fucked up and I'm going to get kicked out!"

So we continue to follow the security, which leaded us into a room. Next thing the security in the room yelled at us and said, "Where is the E? Why are you guys selling E?"  The fact that we did not have any E or drugs, my friend and I were really confused. We told them we didn't have any drugs, but the security kept yelling and questioning us and even said that they got us on tape for evidence.

At this point, I was EXTREMELY frustrated and felt very disrespected, so I took all my belongs out from my pocket and told them," Find the fucking E if you can!!!"  Since they couldn't find E or drugs, you would think that they would apologize for the mistake and let us go... HELL to the Fucking No... They said, "Here's the deal: you guys are banned from Marquee, Tao and the Cosmopolitan property forever." Then, they took a picture of us, and released us from the back door... is this a fucking joke?

First of all, your asses did not find any drugs from my friend and I. Second, you guys were even trying to threaten us with all kind of tricks: "We have everything on the tape!" "We will call the police!" and other bullshits as well, to forces us to admit something we did not do! Where is the fucking justice?!

I'm going to have to side with the vinyl on the window.  NLS does open at 10am M-F, and thankfully for me, my second excursion to this unexpectedly spacious scuba store was fortuitous.

Walking in, I executed the traditional panoramic overview, sweeping my head from left to right, at which point I noticed Sheldon.  Throwing him a head-nod, I offered up a "What's up?" that probably sounded more like "S'up".  That is the bane of being raised on the streets of suburban Massachusetts, where the kids who weren't allergic to bee stings called the shots, and would gut you as soon as look at ya.

I mean, I wasn't actually raised ON the streets, but I did spend a fair share of my time playing near them.

I've been to a handful of dive shops here in the valley, and NLS has one of the larger showrooms.  Their assortment of gear isn't as vast as say, Sports Chalet, but its not a corporate conglomerate... and although I'm pretty sure I used that word incorrectly, as an adjective, it provided the appropriate amount of disparagement.

Interesting note... purchases over $700, if made through an approved GE Capital line of credit, will enjoy a full Gregorian calendar year of deferred interest.  Combine that with the 10% discount extended for being a club member, and that, my friend, spells savings.

For example, the regulator, oct (the yellow line and breather), wireless tank transmitter, and gigantic wrist computer I'm looking at run about $1900 combined.  Subtract the 10%, and divide principal-only payments over 12 months, factor in sales tax... minus the amortization, carry the two...

OK, I think we can all agree, I'm no math whiz.  But, if you purchase a regulator, you'll get the Equipment Specialist course for free.  That's a total prize package worth over $160 US... and I'm gonna do it... and not just because I said I was going to do it in this review... although that is mostly the reason.

And if lake diving aint yo thang, then stop by the trip and travel kiosk, located conveniently in the west wing.  NLS hosts monthly trips to San Carlos MX for only $599 pp based on double occupancy.  Here's the kicker.  You ain't staying in some musty hotel.  No my friend, your accommodations are located in an oceanfront luxury home.  That's how Antonio Banderas would roll, and gosh darn it, why should your roll have any less butter than his?  Two days of 3 tank dives are included, with an available third day of room and diving for a modest up-charge.

Have a little more chang-chang in your pocket, then consider Honduras.  Not only are they know for cigars and the flesh trade, but their diving is unparalleled.  Two words: shark diving.  Get up close and personal with the spiney blast-bots of the sea.  Only $1650 pp based on double occupancy.

All trip deposits are $500 min.  All gear can be rented at NLS.  I'm happy to have a shop, close enough to my house, to call my own.

P.S. That same GE credit card can be used at Global Bikes too.

Consider me a big fan!  

I was perusing potential spots for dinner last night and then I saw My T's picture of the 5 spice game hen and it..waS...ON.  They bake the game hen and THEN deep fry it!  Why don't more spots bake and then fry things?  It tasted even better than it looked.  The side of tomato rice was really good too.  I almost never rave about eating bird but I will be having this again.   

Another favorite was their shaken beef salad.  I was shaken up after my first freakin bite!  The beef was so juicy and so tender and only $12!  The hot grilled beef mixed with the cool lettuce, onion, tomato and spices made for one of the best salads I've had in recent memory. 

The Mekong River noodle soup was just ok.  It looked great and was filled with lots of fixings like fish balls, pork tenderloin, quail eggs, veggies and shrimp but the pork based broth fell short for me.  I saw a lot of customers going for the bone marrow soup and holy shit what a spectacle that was.  HUGE bones!  Me would feel like caveman and raise bone like champion (grunt!).  Check out the pics of it.  

But man oh man so much other stuff I want to try like the slow braised pork belly entree, crispy bird nest noodle and more shaken beef!  They're located in the old Cravin Cajun spot so it's great for groups.  I hope they get their liquor license soon.

Recommendation:  Take it all off!  Get in the bed nude!  (Stop it.  I'll get back to this).

Note:  This review is for Aria Sky Suites, the hotel within the hotel.

One of only 83 Forbes Five Star and a AAA Five Diamond award winner, Aria Sky Suites is the pinnacle of "rentable"  Vegas experience (once again, stop it).  This is the home of the much talked about Sky Villas.

The experience begins with complimentary airport limo service.  Arrival through a gated, private entrance.  Extends to a private checkin where your daily news paper choices are noted, your personal itinerary discussed (if you used the concierge book shows and make dining reservations - best seats and impossible to get tables included) then  you are swept to your suite.

Suites and villas are contemporary with excellent finishes.   Yes, you will probably play with the kitchen faucet for five minutes before finally figuring out how to turn it on, another five staring at a 5'x5'x2' "cube" and wondering who would want to sit on that until you try it and yet another thirty trying to program your room kicking yourself for telling the bell man you could figure it out on your own.  In the end, high tech and comfortable.

Master bathrooms are massive.  Each bedroom has its own.  Marble and glass throughout, his and her vanities, separate area for the ladies to pretty themselves up, separate tub, steam shower, separate water closet with heated seat and washlet, and full walk in closet with a safe large enough for most full size notebooks..  That little zip-lock bag slowing you down at TSA?  Forget it.  All toiletries are provided.  Teeth too good for Colgate?  Contact the concierge and have whatever you want ordered to your suite.

No worrying about throwing used towels on the floor to be replaced.  If it's used it's changed (including your sheets), not once but twice daily with turndown service.   The bedtime chocolates are wonderful.

Friendly and professional service throughout with no air of snootiness. 

Suites start around $600 per night for high level mLife members.  Book through the mlife.com for the best rates.  You do need to pay the dreaded "resort fee" but for the budget conscious, there is a 24/7 private lounge that provide all the bottled water, juices, soda, coffee, tea, and fruits you want.

Oh yeah, the sleeping naked tip.  Just do it.  Sheets are softer and more inviting than any clothes you probably own.  Turn down the AC and enjoy the cocoon of comfort.

Have you ever looked at the every day girl that rings your order up at Starbucks, or the semi-cute chick at the bank and wonder what they would look like topless and shaking their money makers on a stage? Is it just me that has that kind of imagination? Anybody? Well, if you have wondered about that, go to Bandaids to find out. 
I had the opportunity to visit Bandaids and I don't regret that I did. We were allowed in after a quick bag check by a bouncer. Another bouncer was nice enough to get us a few tables front and center stage. The service was good and fairly quick considering the number of people in the bar. Some of the guys are a bit pervy of course...offering to buy drinks or lap dances for you in the slight hope that you might be interested in giving them a private dance. No winners that night! Besides, I was there for some boobage! 
The women of Bandaids aren't perfect, they don't have fake boobs, they don't have perfect bodies. They are every day women that happen to strip for the dough. I wasn't left panting over any hotties unfortunately, but I was impressed at the bravery of some of the women that got up on the stage and worked it. I felt A LOT better about my body after going to Bandaids and seeing some of the girls there. 
Will I go to Bandaids again? Yep! It's a chill place and the girls aren't pushy and I didn't feel at all uncomfortable. It would be nice if they improved the bathrooms for the girls, but that's a small detail. Just hover and you'll be fine! I guess you could say I'm a fan of the dive bar and we were treated very well there. Is it a fancy Scottsdale strip club? Nope. It's your friendly neighborhood strip club to grab a beer, see some boobage, and move along.

For brunch we decided to come to  Bouchon, and it didn't disappoint. From the get-go the service was top-notch. Our( forgot his name) waiter did an amazing job. He explaining the special they had that day and for his services. But I had to give it to the manager Jonathan. He was so professional,and friendly. He kept on coming by to our table and asking if the food  tasted to our likening. 
As for the food their pastries were fabulous. It was fresh and was  still nice and warm, and not to sweet. Highly recommend the pastrie platter.
The special omelette with skirt steak and potato was just ok. Nothing to fancy  about it.
Their chicken and waffle is a must try dish. The chicken was so moist and well season. The waffle with bacon bits and chives was awesome.
In the end it was a great brunch, and amazing service from start to finish.
Thank you again Jonathan for your hospitality, and your staff for an excellent service, and the wonderful food.

Like ancient Rome, Caesars Palace is old, but still impressive.

Caesars has done a decent job of upgrading rooms, restaurants, and entertainment in an effort to keep up with best of Vegas. Sure, for similar prices you can usually find a 5-star Las Vegas room, but staying at Caesars in the middle of the strip does have benefits.

The hotel has a wide range of rooms to fit just about any budget including classic rooms, tower rooms, fancy "Nobu" rooms, multi-room suites, spa suites, exclusive "Laurel" rooms, and, of course, Forum Tower Emperors Suites for bachelor parties made famous in Hangover. In room amenities vary depending on the class of the accommodations. Don't forget about the mandatory $28 Resort Fee per day when booking your stay, too.

Headliner acts often do short stints at Caesars so if you are a fan of Celine Dion, Jerry Seinfeld, Elton John, Shania Twain, Jeff Dunham, Rod Stewart, or one of the other star acts then purchase tickets online early. Absinthe is an adults-only show five nights a week that blends a cabaret vibe and raunchy humor with acrobatic skills.

Even if you don't stay at Caesars Palace, the dining and shopping options are worth a visit. The Forum Shops is a huge indoor mall of stores and restaurants under a blue sky. It's an experience to see at least once and take in the architecture, statues, and animatronic performance at the large fountain. 

For eating at Caesars, Bacchanal is the current "it" buffet with lines and prices that will make you wonder if "it" is really worth it. There are dozens of other options including chains like The Palm, Spago, Joe's Seafood, Cheesecake Factory, and such. Other name restaurants to consider are Guy Savoy, Nobu, Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, and Gordon Ramsey's Pub.

Obviously, Caesars Palace is much more than a casino. The gaming areas are relatively clean and smoke-free. Slot machines seem everywhere or sit down to play poker or blackjack for awhile.

Self-parking is free in the structure behind Caesars while valet is convenient (except when they are busy). Because Caesars Palace is in the heart of the Las Vegas strip, it is convenient to the Bellagio, Paris, Cosmopolitan, Mirage, Treasure Island, and the Venetian.

Caesars Palace has remained remarkably relevant for over 50 years. Even though it isn't among the elite hotel resorts in Vegas, the "Spartacus meets Rodeo Drive" vibe is well maintained with plenty of attractions, restaurants, and shops to attract visitors and guests.

LAS VEGAS RESTAURANT WEEK!!!

$20.00 3 course lunch!!!

I wanted to hit a bunch of places for LVRW, but i could only make it to this one plus dinner at Del Friscos. I read some previous reviews that this place used to be alot more high end, and made some changes to make this more of a tapas place with a bar. It definitely looked more price friendly and $20 for 3 courses was a steal!

I started off with a nice caesar salad, complete with a tiny anchovie and yummy fontina and brioche croutons http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=i2U5iJLxkTWXSHQAdivVNA

The shortrib sandwich was next http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=LcQPsvafLFyw9GLqWZMl9Q.
It was almost like a bahn mi. Bread was yum and shortrib was tasty. I enjoyed it better when i put some of the coleslaw into the sammie. 

Lastly was some tasty sorbets for dessert http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=rWJOt4nICtNbUqEqtZaIIQ

We also added an order of the Cuban Panini. I wished we had ordered the tuna tacos instead. The panini i think would have tasted better with some bacon in it. hahaha. The bread was a little too heavy. HOWEVER the FRIES were amazing!!! I think they were twice fried in duck fat or something, cuz i seriously started to break out after i ate some. But it was yummy!

I don't write many updated reviews but I believe The Parking Spot deserves some Yelp love.

 I've been using this place for about 4 years and the service is consistently superior. There's covered parking so your car is not baking in the sun so you're less likely to come back with an unbearably hot interior. You get a USA TODAY paper when you enter the facility and a bottled water for each occupant of your car when you leave the facility. That water really hits "The Spot" after being subjected to the heat when you're coming back from a temperate climate. You can sign up for thespotclub which you can link your credit card for payment and keep track of the points you use which can be redeemed for free parking. In fact, I called the customer service people at their corporate headquarters because I changed my email address and couldn't get into the site online. For some reason my points were gone too. But they restored my 2,000 plus points within minutes. I guess they thought I was inactive since I hadn't been on the website in years.

All the shuttle drivers are friendly and take care of your luggage (commercial here, Please tip your drivers). They give you a card to remind you which parking space you parked at such as I211. They respond quickly at the terminal when you call and say you are ready for pick up. I usually fly out of terminal 3 so they pick you up at door number 5 on the North side. The vans are air conditioned, what more do you need.

Also, the people that are at the booths are excellent as well. When you call, they know how to answer your question properly. They direct you where to park and take care of your payments at the booth. The Parking spot advertises in the magazines in front of you on your airplane. So you can usually find a coupon for 20% off. I believe a 24 hour stay is $10.95 without coupon. Also, you can get three hours of parking by showing your AAA Card. So if you want to meet people inside the terminal and don't want to pay for airport parking this is what you do. And if you decide to park for more than 3 hours you can use your AAA Card for a 10% discount. They have another service where they'll wash your car by the time you get back. 

There's a Parking Spot 1 and a Parking Spot 2. This review is for Parking Spot 1 on Washington street.

WHAT? I can't hear you!
Grace? Died 30 years ago!
Good luck conversing.

I don't review many chains, but I am going to take a stab on this one.  Been meaning to check out a Yard House ever since Josh A's glowing endorsement on the Talk boards awhile back.  102 tap beers sounded right up my alley.  Didn't think I had ever been to one before, but it was pointed out to me that I was at one in San Diego in the Gaslamp Quarter a couple years ago.  Remember really having liked it.  Probably would have gone 4 or 5.  Low 3 on today's visit.

The music was blaring loud this evening.  I'm sorry, but Matchbox 20 was not meant to be played that loud.  They are not even that good as background music.  I thought the waitress was going to kiss my mother on the lips as she was leaning in so close to hear the order.  Do they really think people like the music that loud?  Most of the customers were either parents with kids or gray-haired snowbirds.  No one was rocking out to it. 

Had two Uinta Hop Notch's which I have never seen anywhere else before.  Quite tasty.  The menu is very extensive both on beer and food.  Got the Mediterranean flatbread as an appetizer.  It was not good.  No sauce whatsoever, just toppings on crust.  Would have also been much better if the tomatoes were sun dried.  Would not get it again.

The blackened swordfish tacos were pretty good.  Little light on the fish, but excellent flavor with a healthy dose of guacamole.  I would definitely get these again.  Also had a couple bites of the Vodka Shrimp Pasta.  Think I will get that the next time I go when they open at West End in St. Louis Park.  Hopefully, they will use the volume dial on the music more prudently.

**Sleek, upscale and reminiscent of the flashy places on Sunset Blvd in West Hollywood, The Cosmopolitan attracts a young crowd and feels much more distinct than the other nearby and new casino/hotel Aria***

I did not stay at The Cosmopolitan hotel, but I did spend a little time in the hotel (including the rooms).  The Cosmopolitan is the new hotel that is adjacent to the CityCenter but not part of it (one of the towers, from the outside, looks similar to the Ritz Carlton at LA Live).

Like Aria (located in the CityCenter), The Cosmopolitan is less themed than other Vegas hotels (like Bellagio, Venetian, Mirage, Paris, and so on).  So if you are not a fan of those themed places, you may like The Cosmopolitan.

I can see how some people would find The Cosmopolitan a little boring when compared to some of the other Vegas casinos.  Luckily, The Cosmopolitan does have a few noticeable advantages over Aria and provides a much more unique experience.

First, the decor is nicer.  Very upscale, sleek and contemporary.  The atmosphere throughout the hotel and the casino floor reminded me of some of the nice and trendy places you may find on Sunset Blvd in West Hollywood.  I felt there was a sense of style and point-of-view with The Cosmopolitan while Aria felt much more sterile.

The Cosmopolitan (which was designed to bring in some residential business) also features bigger rooms with more apartment-like features such as kitchenettes.  All the rooms I went to had balconies, which were nice (haven't seen that on The Strip).  The balconies were also thoughtfully designed to prevent accidents.  Depending on which side of the building your room is located, you may get treated to a great view of Paris, Bellagio and the Bellagio Fountains.

Finally, The Cosmopolitan was bringing in a lot of young people (at least right now).  That might be a plus or negative depending on your life stage.  Place was definitely crowded and hopping.

Several of the restaurants at The Cosmopolitan have locations in L.A. (Scarpetta, Comme Ca and STK).  I think they also have some upscale shopping boutiques, but I did not check them out.

The Cosmopolitan is a nice hotel and it is one I would consider staying at if the price was right.  The balcony is a nice touch and the rooms were also nice.  It also has a great location by being near other big casinos like Bellagio, Caesars Palace and MGM Grand.  And unlike Aria, it is much closer to The Strip.  If I wanted to try one of the newer hotels out (in the CityCenter or near it), I think The Cosmopolitan would be my first choice.

I saw valet parking here.  I am not sure if they also have a parking structure for self-parking.

Lo-Lo's is a nice experience in southern cooking without leaving Phoenix. You can see why everyone raves about the place.

Three of us came here for breakfast last week and really enjoyed ourselves.  The only drawback was that we arrived at 8:15am. Yelp had the opening listed incorrectly as 7 am.  Lo-Lo's  OPENS AT 9 AM! I have posted a updated photo, with the correct times from the front door.

We ordered two coffees and a iced "fruit punch" Kool-Aid for $3.00 each to start. I had the #8 Betty Boop for $8.00. It comes with one piece of southern fried chicken breast, along with a plate covering waffle. It wasn't bad, but mine was a little mushy and didn't stand up well to the syrup. 

As for the chicken, I regret that it was somewhat dry and not juicy. The smashed sides of two sausage paddies for $2.00 was great and it had a nice flavor.  I would come back just for the smashed sausages and Kool-Aid anytime!

My two friends ordered the #14 CJ's, which is one waffle, one egg, and a small bowl of grits for only $6.00 (a steal); and the #11 Kimbo for $7.00, which is two giant waffles. My friend reported that his waffles were cooked longer and they looked golden brown. 

Spending some time in the south, I really miss having Grits. Oatmeal is not the same thing. The Grits at Lo-Lo's are very good. If you have never tried them before, Lo-Lo's would be a good introduction. But skip the cheese on top. The best I've ever enjoyed came with small pieces of bacon in it. Yum! Now, which way is the Mayo Clinic? LOL

Our bill for three including taxes, but before gratuities ran us $34.86. Overall the food and service was very good. I would say Three and Half Stars good, rounding up to Four.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 42/100

I am HUGE lover of the city of Paris and anything related to it. My apartment is Paris-themed with Eiffel Towers, macarons, bonjour signs, etc. everywhere. I was disappointed that my boyfriend couldn't get us hotel reservations at the Paris Hotel, but after visiting it this past weekend, I was actually kinda glad that we didn't end up staying there.

This hotel looks beautiful on the outside. The huge Eiffel Tower, of course, is a smaller, fit-to-scale version of the real thing in Paris. The building with all of the rooms in it actually looks like many of the buildings in Paris. They also have the Arc de Triomphe which is quite a spectacle as well.

My bf and I came here to dine at Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant. Because of where we parked in the garage, we had to walk through a bit of the shops and restaurants to get to where Steak was located on the main casino floor. It feels as if you are roaming the streets of Europe, but nothing inside the whole shopping/restaurant area really screamed PARIS to me. It was just like European-esque, but not really Paris. Also, I felt kind of claustrophobic in there because although the Venetian and Caesars Palace have the same thing where you feel like you're walking in Europe and there's a fake sky ceiling above, I feel like the ones in Paris are much lower and it just felt...busy and stuffy. 

The smell from the restaurants was slightly nauseating. It gave me gross flashbacks of bad quality, overpriced Italian from Disneyland near Pirates of the Caribbean. That is super specific but it was not bringing back good memories for me. Kinda like the smell when you first start riding on Pirates and you pass by the Blue Bayou restaurant...hahaha.

Overall, this hotel just seems dated to me...and not really that big to accommodate large amounts of people. There was some sort of marketing convention going on while we were there, which made it even more busy and claustrophobic than usual. 

3 stars for a nice outer appearance, Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant, and having a good location on the strip!

Friday night and it's 4am.  You've been drinking with your friends since at least 9pm.  It's Scottsdale, so nothing is open and you've exhausted all the fun you can possibly have laughing at drunk idiots gobble down subs at The Philadelphia Sandwich Company (one of my favorite pastimes).  As you drive down Scottsdale Road you see Zorba's and flash back to your senior year of high school, when you and your friends would go into these places and giggle like the innocent little girls you used to be.  I decided it was high time I revisited this Old Town institution. 

Maybe it was the vodka, but I have never felt more comfortable and welcome in a sex shop before.  Usually I get that paranoid feeling that everyone is watching me and keeping tabs on the things that peek my interest.  

I asked the nice young gentleman behind the counter to give my friends and me a tour.  He let me ask stupid questions like:
-"What's your best seller?"  While holding the largest double dildo I have ever seen in my life.  Apparently Zorba's sells a lot of those, just is case you wanted to know.
-"How often do you clean these things and are you the one who has to do it?" In reference to the obvious jack-off rooms.  He kept saying something about no touching being allowed.  He showed me how the little window separating two private rooms will unfog when both rooms are occupied.  So, let that be a warning to you... unless you're into voyeurism I guess.  

He continued to indulge my inane questions so that I could get a good laugh.  Maybe he was bored and got some entertainment out of it too.  Thanks Zorba's for being such a good sport.  I hope you will be entertaining Scottsdale's youth for generations to come.

Those who live by the sword...

We came here last evening around six for quick bite and walked in on a crazy house.  You couldn't tell it by the two other couples eating here.  It was only when we got to the counter and discovered they couldn't stop taking telephone Take-Out orders to take ours. LOL  

We actually didn't wait too long, maybe ninety seconds.  But the phones were ringing off the hook!  China Jade is basically an old style Chinese Take-Out place, doubling as a restaurant.  Gaging by the phones ringing every thirty seconds, there's no need to change their setup.  You don't fix things that aren't broken.

China Jade's weakness isn't the food. It's the hurried service to get back to the phones.  I am not exaggerating this point.  It was almost bye-bye cell phone as they nearly spilt the soup in their rush. And, since China Jade is built for takeout, you'll find a lot of plastic plates and utensils. The soup BTW was served in a  plastic 16 oz "To Go" container (photo).

From our standpoint this is all minor stuff, if the food is good.  Last night the food was very good and just short of Four Stars. 

We had the Hot & Sour Soup (photos), eight Fried Dumplings, Sesame Chicken with Fried Rice and a soft drink; all for just $18 including tax. Nice! 

So, Three and a Half Stars "A-OK" and we'll be back; most likely for Take-Out. LOL

My family and friends have been getting together for a few years here to grub. That will be happening no longer. The last 3 visits were terrible and the last visit specifically was not good. I'm sad about this because I really loved the food before, but now it's just not consistent. On this last visit we were the only customers in the restaurant yet it still took over an hour to receive our food and the food came out staggered. My niece only wanted Egg Drop Soup and they totally forgot to bring it to her and only did so after asking a 3rd time about it. When she finally got her soup it was like a bowl of gloppy gel. I loved the soup here before, so I have no idea what has happened, but it wasn't even edible. What I loved ordering here most, Strawberry Chicken, tasted awful. One thing that wasn't easy to ignore was the nasty smell inside. It smelled so badly of like sewage or something. Then at the end of the meal we noticed roaches on the floor! OMG I was so ready to leave. Drinks come in cans and refills aren't free. After loving this place for so long it's a major disappointment to see New China Cuisine go so downhill.

To all who love this restaurant, I offer an apology. 

It's been several hours now, and my ability to taste is just returning. We have been waiting four months to try this new Szechuan place, and now... well. 

The reviews were universally good, one might even say great. So we were excited that we found ourselves in Chandler and only a few miles away. 

We weren't starving, so we decided to order light. I spied the Spicy Wontons on the menu and thought they would go nice with the Hot & Sour soup. While my friend ordered the Beef Stew and Pot Stickers. 

First, bare in mind that Miu's idea of a small order of soup, is one that comes in a huge, one quart bowl! No way anyone was going to finish that.

I asked for some hot oil from our server and took some pictures. The soup was very good, though not very spicy. So I added a teaspoon dollop of the oil to my bowl. Nice!

As for the Pot Stickers, they were deep fried, not pan fried and somewhat bland. Next up was my Spicy Wontons. They looked very much like some wontons in hot oil. I tried a few and found the dish had an odd taste that I couldn't place. Saffron?  By my third wonton, I couldn't feel the inside of my mouth and everything just tasted like sand. 

The dish itself wasn't spicy, maybe a 6 on a 10 scale. But I haven't been able to taste anything for the last five hours. It was like a trip to the dentists office, everything was numb. I hope someone else might be able to identify the mystery spice or ingredient.

We may be back at some point, but it will be a long while before we do. Sorry!

I hate buffets, but I had heard so many good things about Bacchanal I said I'll give it a whirl for breakfast ($28/each).  We had:

Freshly squeezed juices like carrot and cucumber
Smoked salmon & cold shrimp
Steak & egg
Biscuits and gravy, sausage and cheesy tots
Fried chicken and waffles
Sorbets:  Thai tea; fig & balsamic; mango chile lime; and blood orange

There were also your basic fare of eggs, bacon, hash browns, waffles, and an extensive array of desserts.

The juices were excellent and full of flavor.  I had four:  5 Stars.  In addition, the salmon and shrimp were fresher compared most buffets:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the hot dishes disappointed.  They were not warm.  In addition, the biscuits were not that moist, the sausage in the gravy was not crumbled well, and there wasn't enough pepper:  2 Stars.

On the other hand, the sorbets were really good and flavorful, with the mango chile lime being my favorite.  You could really taste the chile:  5+++'Stars for the latter flavor.  The woman who served me was from Puerto Rico, and we struck up a conversation in Spanish which was cool.

The remainder of the service was spotty.  Although there were many open tables, it took a while to be seated.  The group in front of me thought the same.  Additionally, we had to ask for water, and our glasses were not refilled.  Lastly, we told one server that we were going to the restroom.  However, when we returned, someone had cleared our table:  2 Stars.

I would come back here for breakfast.  However, I would not come back for dinner ($55), and wait an hour or more.  There are far better things to do in Vegas, than wait in a buffet line.

After reading MaryLou D's review on Yelp, a group of us from my office decided to come here for a late afternoon lunch.

We were blown away by this Mom (sorry, no Pop) place. Nana is cooking up some really tasty food. I had the Carne Asada burrito, which was huge.  Take a look at my knife and fork (photo) next to this bad boy. 

Second, the flavors were outstanding and we couldn't get over the amount of meat that she gave us.  Even at $6.50, there must have been well over a cup and a half of diced Carne Asada. Wow. 

While she was making our food, we got a chance to catch up on our favorite Mexican Soaps on the flat screen TV, munching on some chips with some really good and flavorful homemade salsa (with four alarm heat), and all the while enjoying a 16 oz bottled long neck Coke. Atmosphere. Atmosphere. Atmosphere! We didn't want to go back to work. Time moves slowly here, but not Nana. She's always hustling!

Expect to pay around $11, including a very generous Tip to Nana for this incredible meal. Four Stars and yes, we are Fans. Thank you MaryLou!

Alot of things go into a fabulous experience at a club.

You need a fabulous space.

Fabulous people.

Fabulous prices.

And lots of fabulous space to bust out your fabulous moves.

Tao - was an impressive fabulous space, but the people and number of them crammed into one dance space (the downstairs area was much less crowded, but not much was happening) were short of fabulous, we couldn't score a seat unless we had ordered bottle service, and the price of entry for the guys in our group as well as the drinks once inside were far from fabulous.

So overall Tao was not the fabulous experience we had hoped over.

There were two creepy baths, boasting two naked women sitting in rose-petal water as we entered. Both women looked bored and unimpressed, and at the moment I knew our night at Tao was not looking up. The music was erratic Top 40 stuff, like most of the clubs in Las Vegas, and once we made our way to the second floor dance area, we were bombarded with throes of pushy girls. 

With no room to dance or move, we managed to squeeze our way into the VIP section and ended up partying the night away with some friendly Welsh guys, which helped the night pass a little smoother, but after about an hour and half we couldn't get out of Tao soon enough.

If you're OK not being able to bust out your fabulous booty shake move, cause you'll probably boot out five girls from the dance floor in one shake - you have so little room to move - then come here - you'll probably have a good time. 

But if crowds aren't your thing - ask the locals for a good club recommendation that night - and go there instead.

Trust..

Don't tell anyone Christopher. But I have a serious crush on you and your elegant eatery and your fabulous Crush Lounge. This could rival my Scott Baio crush in the 70s. Or my crush on arrugula, beet and goat cheese salad in the 80s. Or even my 90s crush, yep, again, Scott Baio. 

We were greeted by a lovely host person who gave us the 411 on our dining options. We chose the restaurant kitchen bar which had happy hour prices on food and drink. No sooner had Rickie and I bucked up to the bar did we have our server take our drink order: two iced teas and a large flat water. Soon to follow was some delicious pillowy yet crunchy French bread with a ramekin of soft buttah!

While we waited for our food it was most entertaining watching the kitchen staff prepare for what was sure to be a very busy Valentine's weekend. And since I was already with my Valentine, I was most happy. 

We had a delicious cheese plate with herbed chevre, Manchego, Pecorino Romano and a mild cheese I won't even try to spell. I had a crispy, creamy pizza with goat cheese, roasted garlic and oven dried tomatoes. Very good though I kept thinking of my favorite flat bread delight at St. Francis. Hmmm...Rickie had a burger he enjoyed though the top bun was very doughy and not pleasant to eat. Yam fries were tasty though a dipping sauce would have been fun. All that was only $36!

Now. Is it just me but does every new restaurant try to out do the next guy with the jazziest bathroom sinks? Well, I'd have to say, Christopher's takes home the gold. A huge communal sink with a wall in front of you that shoots out water below as you rub your hands over hundreds of little rocks. Enjoyable! 

And now in the 2000s I have a new crush. And it's a sink. Sorry Scott. 

OMG...I think I just finished my 400th review! Cheers my yelpitas!

BurGR is definitely a fun place.

I'm not a big fan of GR's TV persona or schtick.  Though there is something positive to be said about his mercurial nature and focus on detail.  So, given our short eleven hours in Vegas, we decided to come here.

At the heart of BurGR, you'll find some good food and I believe GR poking fun at himself.  The restaurant has several photos, as does the menu, of him hands up in a fit of mock anger.  I believe, there's a wee sparkle and impishness in those eyes.

So, what about the food you say?

It's good!  Very good in fact.  And, those BurGRs are worth every penny of the $14.00 to $17.00 you'll pay to enjoy them.

The reason isn't too hard to understand.  Given that mercurial nature, GR chose to cook the food: "Paying special attention to not only the ingredients but the method, beef patties will be cooked over an open flame fueled by hard woods."  

So it isn't too difficult to see why they have a complex smokey taste, that layers nicely with the various toppings and ingredients. 

We had the American and Euro BurGRs.  The Euro (photo) came with truffle aioli, goat cheese and arugula, while the American came with american cheese, butter lettuce, tomato, pickles and red onion.  Both were delicious, though the Euro was more interesting on the palate.  GR's focus to detail even shows up on the selection of the bun. Nice!

Another WOW if you will, were the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Seems the BurGR fries are "hand-cut and thrice cooking will ensure extra crispness" and they use Kennebec instead of Russet potatoes  which "offering a lighter, less starchy and crisper fry"  

Okay, we agree.  But what makes them special, is the hair like shavings of parmesan cheese (photo) with a special aioli oil sauce for dipping. Ohh, are they good.

So, with a glass of wine, a nice pint of Leinenkugel on tap, a couple of BurGRs and some of those wonderful Truffle Fries, expect to pay around $27.50 each, not including gratuities or taxes.

Enjoy!

Maybe ramen really is the new pizza!  It's kind of mind blowing how I was dying for just one legit ramen joint in Las Vegas only a few years back and now I could do a week straight without going to the same spot.  I'd also have to chug 500 gallons of water during said week but still....

I was looking for a basic, no frills ramen and their "Tonkotsu Assari" fit that bill perfectly.  Our server also mentioned it was his favorite.  Assari consisted of pork broth, chashu, green onion, egg and bean sprouts, but the thick noodles were the clincher for me.  Most of Jinya's ramen offerings come with thin noodles which I am usually not down with although I didn't ask if they would substitute.  

It's a good thing they put me at a corner table since I slurped my face off.  From top to bottom, it was solid through and through.  There is better chashu to be had in town, but this was still a nice bowl of satisfaction.  I'd also skip the salad (dressing was gross) plus gyoza add-on and opt for another tapas dish instead.  

To my knowledge, Jinya is also the first and only spot in Vegas to do takoyaki the right way.  I've had so many awful versions of it since moving from Japan that I had given up hope.  I was delirious after my first bite!  The light crunch, generous chunks of octopus with its signature sauce, mayonnaise and dried bonito flakes put my taste buds on another planet.  It was a terrific dish that I will be having multiple times in the future.  Love that they're open until 3am!!  

Good call with giving only the ladies the nice Toto toilet.  :P

El Dorado Cantina is one of my favorite new restaurants in town.  This definitely rivals Javier's at Aria for the "high end" Vegas Mexican cuisine market, but the prices are way more reasonable.  Chef Paco and his staff are churning out some really good stuff.  

Want a great way to spice up a weekday dinner?  How about doing as the Aztecs did back in the day (century) and start off with some grasshoppers?  Yes, sir!  EDC's "chapulines" can be prepared sauted either in garlic lime or habanero.  For the uninitiated, the closest thing to compare them to would be crispy shrimp tails but juicier.  The habanero order offered terrific heat and not in a painful, shoot me in the face kind of way.  At $7.50, it was a large portion that could have easily satisfied a party of six.  Not for everyone by any means, my wife was literally one and done, but I enjoyed it and had plenty to take home (fried rice, anyone?).

"Imperial Shrimp" was everything I look for in an appetizer: seafood stuffed Pacific wild shrimp wrapped in bacon and then lightly fried. The creamy heat (sounds gross, right?) from the chipotle ranch dressing that accompanied the dish was awesome.  More things in life should be wrapped in bacon!  I should start a national campaign.

We chose to split the humungous carne asada entre.  The citrus marinated steak was medium rare perfection.  I loved the big slabs of grilled cactus that it came with.  We probably boxed up 70 percent of the plate.  Goddamn nachos and salsa....

You'd think that would prevent us from ordering dessert, but the flan and tres leches cake somehow made it to the table.  The latter was plated nicely and the rum flavor made me feel like I was on vacation.  It was a great end to the meal and I can't wait to try more.

Las Vegas residents should feel privileged that in our town we have the very best Ramen-Yas in America. I grew up in the largest Japanese Districts of Los Angeles county where the so called "best ramen" comes from. Nothing in Little Osaka or Little Tokyo can compare to the Ramen we got here in Las Vegas. Back in LA, all we had were Hakata Ramen-Yas. There were literally a thousand of them. We had two Tokyo Ramen-Yas(Koraku and Chin-Ma-Ya), and one gigantically overrated Sapporo Ramen-Ya named Santouka. Here in LV, we don't got a Santouka but we got something that is a million times better, RAMEN SORA! 

We all know by now that the 3 Major Ramen Variations are: Sapporo(MISO), Hakata(TONKOTSU), and Tokyo(SHOYU). Here in Vegas our Ramen scene does not follow that generic formula. The scene is dominated by an extremely rare Osaka Ramen-Ya(Fukumimi), and a unique Kyushu variation from Kurume(Monta). The only traditional Ramen-Ya we have is a Sapporo one, which of course is SORA RAMEN. For decades, SORA has been a very popular ramen-ya in Japan. Yoshi-San, who owns and operates many of the better Japanese restaurants in town, decided to make a deal with the owners of the original SORA and acquire the rights to the secret recipe. Thanks to the great Yoshi-San, the most popular Miso Ramen recipe has finally come to America. And to make things better, it came to Las Vegas! Thank again Yoshi.

I wanna give credit to Ian, for always providing excellent service to us. Ian has incredible ramen knowledge.. maybe even more than me. 

For the longest time, SORA was the only Ramen-Ya in Las Vegas that served Shio Ramen(recently Koraku came to town). But, nobody cared because the only people who eat Shio ramen are geriatric Japanese people who bitch about how Miso isn't supposed to be in ramen(My Dad). But, in all seriousness, there is actually a reason why many Sapporo/Hokkaido Ramen-Yas serve Shio. A while ago I was talking with a local Japanese hero at Sushi on Rainbow, who told me that there is a port city in Hokkaido that is world famous for their unique version of Shio ramen. And today many Sapporo Ramen-Yas will present a "knock-off" version of this unique recipe. We always assume Hokkaido Ramen is Miso, but I guess that's not entirely true.  So don't feel embarrassed to order Shio at a Miso ramen restaurant, you are still being true to protocol. 

Curley noodles! Miso Ramen is supposed to have curly and thick noodles. SORA is the only ramen-ya I have been to that gets this right. Santouka has straight noodles even though they claim they are Sapporo. Monta, recently decided to get their act together and began serving "curly" noodles with their miso. I appreciate their attempt to be more authentic to the Sapporo style, but Monta's noodles are way to thin for Miso. 

The Killer Spicy Miso Ramen is what I usually get here. Out of the 10 times I have ordered it, there were 2 times when I couldn't finish it. When you order this, you need a lot of water refills and extra napkins. The spices make you sweat profusely. When Ian is working, he will remember that you are taking on the Killer Spicy challenge and will come around often to refill your water. The other servers unfortunately don't, making the experience more difficult. 

People in Los Angeles think they know what good or "authentic" Miso Ramen is. In reality, they have no clue. We here in Las Vegas have the very best Miso Ramen-Ya in America. In the past, all the big name restaurants in Japan decided to open up their American locations in LA, so it was really awesome to finally get one here in Las Vegas for a change. We got lucky this time... and yeah, f*ck you Los Angeles!

This place is awesome!  If you've never had a pasty, think of it as a huge empanada.  If you've never had an empanada, think of it as the biggest and best gourmet hot pocket ever...and maybe think about trying some new restaurants :)

Choices, choices, choices!!  So many fillings to try.  My wife got the Veggie Chicken Tikka Masala.  Their faux meat of choice is a British brand called Quorn.  It's not as firm as Gardein but blended really well with the curried sauce, potatoes, peppers and had great texture.  I got the Veggie Cottage Pie (Quorn vegetarian ground beef, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar. With a side of HP sauce.) that really hit the spot as it was savory and just got better bite after bite.  We also got to see the guys make a set of pasties by the bar and it looked as homemade as you could get.  

I'd say this would be an ideal place for lunch but you'd be seriously missing out on one major thing...their beer list!!  That is unless you can get away with being buzzed and having beer breath at work.  If that's the case, please PM me your work address so I can apply.  There are a ton of great beers from Joseph James to Chimay to a lot of British brands I have never heard of.  I got a beer that tasted like banana bread.  The bartender told me he didn't like it, my wife hated it, I loved it!!!

Then there's the whole atmosphere...really cool!  No video poker at the bar.  No TV anywhere!  The Cure and Sex Pistols blaring from the speakers.  Very refreshing!

Okay, I've been beaten into submission. Yes, you can enjoy a wonderful dining experience in a restaurant that serves only buffet.  Jasmine Tokyo is that place!

Our merry little group included ring leader, buffet master extraordinaire Rand H, along with Robyn N, Mike C and myself.  As noted elsewhere, Jasmine Tokyo is located in the old Claim Jumpers space, near the corner of 70th Street on Shea.  

Both the exterior and interior hasn't changed that much either.  The only difference you'll notice are the huge buffet stations that run down the middle of the restaurant.  On the right side, as you come in, they've re-positioned the bar to the back and added a huge sushi station. I have posted a zillion pictures online.

The food was extraordinary.  It wouldn't have been better, if it was prepared individually in the back.  Everything was fresh and served in smaller, more manageable portions.  This is one of those restaurants (buffets) where you can only take a small amount of food on you plate, because you want the opportunity to try everything.  According to Rand, they have nearly 130 different choices, including eight different gourmet ice creams.  The ice cream by the way, is the only food item that is served to you upon request.

My bill was $11.99 before taxes, less a "20% Yelp Discount" that came to $10.66 including taxes, but before tip,  Our server Mirian F was outstanding and always there refilling our glasses or cleaning our table.  Very nice.

Enjoy!

Wynn wins in my book, as far as buffets go.

I am not much of a gambler or a buffet person, but I come here to increase my odds of being a winner.

Since buffets are almost always a quantity over quality compromise, this place is not for everyone.  I'd rather dine at Michael Mina's, where I can get a lobster pot pie and their Kobe beef with seared foie gras.

My attitude is that I am not going to eat like a pig so that I can get my money's worth.  I simply enjoy their wide selection of food presented in a classy way and savor the beautiful experience.

Certainly, you will see some diners, like Yelpers Cat C, Janice C, Flora C and Angelique Q, pigging out on the crab legs and prime ribs for a few hours.  

I, on the other hand, love to sample a little of everything.  Think of the buffet as one HUGE INTERNATIONAL SAMPLER PLATTER, which includes salad, fried rice, shrimp cocktails, bacon, soup, Mexican food, crme brulee, crepe, fruits, dim sum, sushi, prime rib, king crab legs, fish, grilled meat, and gelato/ice cream.  Plus bottomless champagne!

The fiddy-dollar meal is not going to break anyone's piggy bank, so don't overstuff yourself.  Save $12 for their brunch.

If you are a buffet fanatic, this is your first choice destination.  Bellagio takes second place.  Third comes Rio.  

The staff is very attentive and friendly.  Seating is comfortable, but there is a long line to get in during peak hours.

Most importantly, the bathroom is close by.
It is true that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.
So did my #2.  Wooooosssshhhh!

I dedicate this review to Janice C.  She's half-Chinese.

*** Mmm-mmmm .... 
      That IS a tasty burger. Vincent, ever have a Holsteins burger?
      Wanna bite? They're real tasty Holstein Beef.
      Well, if you like burgers give 'em a try sometime.

Olivia and I gave Holsteins a try and were impressed by two amazing burgers and great service. It's not cheap, but totally felt worth it. We split two and added a Fried Egg ($1 extra) to each at the recommendation of the bartender.

Burger 1: The Rising Sun ($17) with Kobe-style Beef, a Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Tempura Avocado, and a Spicy Mayo with a pile of Thick-cut Onion Rings. Simply delicious blend of beef, avocado, egg, and sauce.

Burger 2: El Machete ($16) with Fire-roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions and a Spicy 'Machete' Aioli with a side of Steak Fries. The Fried Egg really made this a great and messy burger. Even though it wasn't spicy, I still devoured it.

 *** Which burgers are Holsteins Burgers? 
       Well, they're the ones with Bad-Ass Burgers printed right on the menu.

Both Holstein masterpieces were such tasty burgers, we tried to go back the next night, but they had closed about 10 minutes earlier :(. We even knew which two burgers we were gonna get: a Big Fat Greek Burger ($17) with Lamb, Feta Cream, & Tatziki Sauce and a Billionaire Burger ($28) with Kobe-style Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, & a Truffle Mayo. Next time.

*** You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?
      Ah, hit the spot.

Besides burgers, Holsteins is famous for its dozen or so Bam-boozled Shakes loaded with liquor. These three sound like especially tempting: Frozen Grasshopper, Crme Brle, or Red Velvet Cake Shakes.

Holsteins Shakes and Buns is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel near the East Tower and the Las Vegas Strip. If the place is busy, my suggestion is to get the burgers and shakes to go and then take them back to your room to enjoy them with your own tasty beverages and entertainment.

I never expected to give Holsteins 5 stars ... and it may truly be between 4 and 5, but compared to other burgers and disappointments in Vegas the super service and juicy, messy, and flavorful burgers of Holsteins stood out. Like Ahhhnold, I'll be back.

Wicked Spoon is simply over-rated. The desserts are the best part and do leave a good last impression, but compared to the elite buffets of Vegas, Wicked Spoon doesn't have the quality, service, freshness, or variety to be considered 5-star. It's a-ok which is totally a-ok.

Sunday night dinner: 3 - 3.5/5 stars

There were no stations for fresh, made to order items like pasta, crepes, salads, etc. Instead portions are placed into small bowls like a cafeteria. There were no fresh sashimi or sushi offerings except two California rolls. The Snow Crab was average frozen fare. Salmon was meh. No XLB. Asian food looked like Panda Express.

On the positive side, Bone Marrow was cool (though not spectacular). By far the most spectacular section is the desserts. 2 flavors of macarons were chewy fun and Red Velvet Cookies were worth a try. Save room for the Gelato and get a couple of the huge Chocolate-covered Strawberries.

Service was fine. Our waitress brought drink (Mojito) re-orders and cleared plates as expected. She earned her tip.

If you are at the Cosmopolitan or nearby hotel then the Wicked Spoon is an a-ok option when in the mood for an AYCE Buffet

***Aria is very generic, but the rooms (especially the bigger ones) are comfortable and very nice; it also has a good location, but you really have to walk to get to The Strip***

Aria is one of the new very tall hotels at City Center in Las Vegas.  Here is a rundown on the pros and cons (a pleasant experience overall).

Pros:

--Nice rooms.  Contemporary, clean and comfortable.

--Location.  City Center is near a lot of the action (with casinos like Caesars and Bellagio closeby).

--Lots of places to eat in the hotel.

--Because of its newness, the smoke smell is less strong.  Still, I feel Bellagio and Wynn are better at clearing out the smoke.

--A different option.  Not as "theme-like" as other casinos.  This could be a pro or con depending on how you feel about those "theme-like" casinos, but at least it provides an option for those who are looking for something else.

--The interior/decor of the hotel/casino (like the rooms) are modern and sleek.

--The exterior is pleasant to look at and all glass (very similar to the Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott at LA Live).

Cons:

--While Aria is located on the Strip, it is a little bit of a walk to get down to the sidewalk to visit other casinos.  I like walking in Vegas, but this may be a con if you are not wearing comfortable shoes (or need to get somewhere quick by foot).

--The rooms are small.

--I think their rates are a little higher than other serviceable hotels nearby.

--I only tried one food place (Cafe Vettro) and it was not good.

--While this place is a different option, the lack of a theme or style gives the hotel kind of a too simple feel.  Once again, good or bad depending on your perspective.

I haven't stayed at many hotels in Vegas so it is hard for me to rank Aria, but my experience at Aria was pleasant overall.  Since Aria is near a lot of casinos I like, I would come back, but I would do so only if I got a good deal.

Note: They have little packaged accessories (such as an iPod auxiliary cable and charger) next to nuts and candies on the counter.  These are obviously things (expensive things) you can buy (like the minibar).  The items are weight sensored so if you pick one of them up, the hotel automatically charges your room.  So you lift it, you bought it.

They will take it off your credit card if you picked it up to just get a better look.

Trivia: Aria was featured on a recent episode of ABC's The Bachelorette.

XS is a gorgeous club, no doubt. Plus, it's huge and you can go outside when it's getting cramped inside. However, like most clubs in Vegas, the cover is expensive ($30 for guys, $20 for girls and Encore guests - there's no guestlist), the drinks are nearly $20 a pop, and terrible, terrible DJ. I personally cannot stand mash-ups of terrible hip hop songs, but I guess the majority of club-goers are down with that and/or have short attention spans. They seriously need to get some good celebrity DJs in there -- they make enough money to have one every night.

The doormen and staff are actually really nice, and luckily we got to bypass the insane line. It looked like the line was rather quick though, and they started letting people inside on Friday at around 9:30pm.

The huge pool area is a nice place to lounge, and you can get bottle service out in the cabanas as well. The bartenders work fast, so getting drinks from the bars isn't a problem. 

There are a lot of beautiful people (ow! 8/14 gallery, page 6 http://www.xslasvegas.com/flash/index.php), and the go-go dancers are pretty hot... so yes, there are a lot of things that make XS way better than all of the other big clubs I've been to in Vegas. It definitely feels glamorous, not trashy. Expect to spend around $100 per person. But then again, money ain't a thing when you're in Sin City!

I'm always up for Ramen wherever I go.  You don't really think of eating ramen when your in Vegas but there are several good places in sin city.  I tried Monta when they were part of the crappy ramen festival last summer.  I got a bowl but by the time I got it I did enjoy it very much.  I wanted to give them another shot so I decided to hit this place up for a fresh bowl of noodles.  Like most ramen houses the place is small and the night we went there was a slight wait.

Gyoza ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=q9h7EAzC1fSN5TIRBSwEtQ#q9h7EAzC1fSN5TIRBSwEtQ Of course you have to get some because it just goes well with Ramen.  These were pretty good with a crisp char.

Kuro ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#d9BleP8jELt3GECw45RQyA Which is tonkotsu with black mayu (garlic oil).  Because its tonkotsu/hakata broth the noodes are the straight white ones.  Broth was good.  Not really salty.  The black mayu brought out a nice garlic flavor.  Good amount of kikurage and bamboo shoots.  The chasu had a good equal amount of fat and meat with a good flavor to it.  It didn't come with ajitama so I had planned to order one on the side but totally forgot.  Would have liked to taste it to see how it compared to other places.

Shoyu ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/monta-ramen-las-vegas-2?select=2J_aZpdjND0tilpICKmk4Q#2J_aZpdjND0tilpICKmk4Q  Friend ordered the shoyu.  It had a great tasting broth.  The noodles were the yellow chijiri type.  It was slightly overcooked but it was pretty good.

Service was hit and miss.  Usually you get your gyoza before ramen but we got it the other way around.  We also had ordered ice tea and soda but that never came.  It was taken off the bill.   Overall it was a decent bowl of ramen.  Since this is the first ramen spot I tried in Vegas I cant compare to the other places in the city.  I will stick with a 4 star for now. 

Eyes ~ Small place with lots of hungry peeps!
Nose ~ Smells good!.
Ear ~ Happy diners chatting and grubbing!
Mouth ~ Ahhhh Ramen!!
Tummy ~ Satisfied.

Imagine two college roommates, one an all-american kid raised on classic fast food fare, the other a Korean foreign exchange student with an overprotective mom preparing meals weekly from home, and then picture some pothead next door raiding their refrigerator one night and throwing their leftovers together in one massive pile for a meal of his own.  That may have been my first impression upon glancing at the menu, but after finishing my first meal here I am convinced this is the work of some evil mad culinary genius.       

Went and checked out this place over lunch with a friend and decided to sample their two most popular items: the #1 (Beef Buldogi hotdog)  and the Angry Kimchi Fries

The beef bulgogi dog is a 100% premium beef dog covered with an avalanche of Asian cole slaw, grilled onions, generous strips of beef bulgogi (marinated beef with Korean seasonings, finished off with a dusting of sesame seeds and a light drizzle of house mayo.   The first bite of any hot dog usually begins with a naked end devoid of bread or toppings, and one can tell that the Buldogi dog has been grilled to that perfect smokey char with a nice firm "snap" of the casing that explodes with mouthwatering flavor.  The contrast in textures and flavors from the tender bulgogi, crispy slaw, smokey onions, creamy mayo, and toasted sesame seeds surprisingly round out one another in harmonious balance.

The angry kimchi fries was a whole other beast.  Wheras the oxtail chili cheese fries at Bachi Burger look better than they taste, the Angry fries here taste better than they look.  Start with a bed of sweet potato fries, add a layer of pork bulgogi, throw in some cooked kimchi and melted cheese with diced green onion and jalapeno, and then finishing the whole concoction with a sunny side egg, I found myself unable to stop with each progressive bite since something so wrong apparently seemed so right!  There's a stroke of brilliance with the choice of sweet potato for the starch since the natural sugar cuts through all the spicy and savory components and the richness from the cheese and runny egg yolk cleverly binds all the distinct bold flavors together  (pro-tip: break the yolk immediately upon being served otherwise the heat from the other ingredients will continue to cook the egg)

If I had one minor critique, it would be the lack of beer and the ambience inside is a bit drab since I think the food has heavy flavors that go well with beer in the company of friends with a sporting event in the background since I would totally attend any stadium or ballpark which served these items.    It looks like they may have attempted to expand previously but the other location appears closed on yelp, but hopefully their following will grow to be successful on a repeat attempt in the future.

I came across this place on yelp and wanted to check it out. We used to have some Hostess outlets in the NW part of town (since closed) that I liked and was hoping to find something similar to that in this place. I found much more than I expected! Walking in I was greeted by a friendly cashier who asked if I had been in before. When I told her I hadn't, she went over the different sections and said to ask if I had any questions. They mostly have Entenmann's, Oroweat, Thomas, Grandma Sycamore's and Sara Lee goods, but they also have other stuff like Bear Creek soup and Boboli pizza crusts. I got a loaf of Sun Maid cinnamon raisin bread for just $1.75 and Texas Toast for the same price. Bagels were $1.99 and I picked out some pizza crusts, english muffins and other pastries. The prices here are drastically lower compared to buying these items at the grocery store. Not even Walmart has a "rollback" like this! 

When I got to the register I was given a stamp card. You get a punch for every dollar you spend. Once the card is full you can get a free item by the brand listed on the card. For every $9 spent you also get to pick something free (changes everyday) from the premium section near the front door. I also received a $1 coupon to bring back towards my total purchase for a future visit and the cashier told me I can combine them! The $1 coupons can only be used during the month on them so make sure to pay attention to that. You get a $1 off coupon for every $8 you spend.The cashier said what is sold here isn't leftover stale stuff from the grocery stores like most people think. She says Bimbo is the largest bread supplier and the stuff sold here is leftovers, but fresh leftovers that grocery stores, etc. had no shelf room for. Nothing I purchased was past a "sell by" date and was soft and fresh. This bakery outlet isn't anywhere near where I live, but I work in the area once a week and will make a point to stop and load up on delicious savings.

So I tried going to Drais MDW. That was a fail. I shall literally break it down.

It was after midnight Saturday night when I text the promoter Kim Paul, asking him the price for entry that night. $30 for men, $20 for women is what he said. So awesome. We were set to go. Everything else that night was over $100 for men.

We reach the cashier. Chelse, blonde, thin, early 20s. My girlfriend pays $20 cash for herself. Left is me, 1 other girlfriend and her boyfriend. I was going to pay with my card and they were going to give me the cash. So she rings me up for a total of $70. Sounds right: 20 + 20 + 30.

No. She says "now what about her?" (Referring to my friend right beside me). I said "yeah, $20, $20, $30." N she looks at me like I'm stupid. "No it was never $30 for men. It was actually $40 and that was before guestlist which closed at midnight so it's $50." I tell her "the promoter Kim Paul just told me it was $30. So I want my money back." She says "sorry, there are no refunds" all super bitchy like she owns the place. Lol. So I said "ok well bring me a manager on duty." She says "sure."

Comes back with another doofus and after I explained the situation, he said nothing. Just went to tapping on the screen. After 10 minutes, I get a "void check testing admission" receipt but total said $0.00. I ignored it and left assuming he should've known what he was doing. I'll check my account tomorrow. Silly me.

So here I am back in California calling everyday asking for a manager. On Monday I was able to reach Victor Drai's assistant. Woman. Don't recall her name. She took my name and phone number and also check number from my receipt. Of course they aren't going to call me back, so I call once a day asking for Victor Drai not knowing he was the owner. Just hoping it was the person who would post void the transaction already.

Well he was not happy to hear from me. He answers with his strong Moroccan egotistical accent "how the fuck did you get my number" and "what the fuck do you want" and "give me your fucking number my assistant will help you, not me." So I say "well she's the reason why I call asking for you because she was not able to help me." He says "you're making that up" and again "I'm not going to help you. Give me your number. Do you want to be fucking helped or not!?" I respond with a "Wow you are ridiculous" and he clicks.

I call back and finally a normal person answers and asks how did I get Victor's number. I simply said I didn't. They transfer me when I ask for him. So he new guy gives me the general manager's email so they can help me. I pray to God this is the end of it.

By far the worst customer service experience ever.

I attempted when they were in Henderson, but was a day late and a cup of shave ice short. They were apparently moving over to a spot in Chinatown (now open!) and I would have to wait a couple more weeks. While on a taco trek UYE last week I was told that SnowFlake Shavery would be added as one of our stops and was thrilled! This isn't ice cream and it isn't a sno-cone. I know there is a lot of confusion to what shave ice is and I am learning myself, but you wont find any artificial syrups here! If you haven't had it before, it is something you need to experience first hand. The appearance, texture and taste is something special. SnowFlake Shavery uses fresh and all natural ingredients. Flavors range from chocolate, vanilla, cantaloupe, mango, coconut, green tea, black sesame and depending on the season you might be lucky enough to try the banana! I missed out, but heard it was fantastic! 

Sizes: Regular ($3.49) Large ($4.75) Monster ($6.49)

Step 1 - Choose your flavor and size
Step 2 - Choose your toppings priced 50 cents each
Step 3 - Choose sauce priced at 25 cents each (first sauce is free) 

I ordered the "Ex-Straw-Binary" (regular) and it had strawberry snow, strawberries, strawberry sauce and I had them add chocolate sprinkles and extra strawberry condensed milk. The strawberry condensed milk is SO good! The shave ice is very light. The portions are big and even though the regular looks like something you wont be able to finish, give it a try because it wasn't filling at all to me. It was just refreshing and yummy. I will be back to try other flavors!

The employees are very friendly and willing to answer any questions you might have. If you aren't sure about a flavor just ask and they will give you a sample. Don't forget to ask for a rewards card because when you buy 10 you get one free!

Sprinkles is at The Linq (between the Flamingo and the Quad). Cupcakes are $3.75 each and an additional 50 cents if you want it in a box instead of a wax bag. They have more than one door. The left is cupcakes only while the right side is both cupcakes and ice cream. They have prices and flavors posted and only offer certain flavors on different days of the week. You can check their website or download the Sprinkles app to find out what flavors they have that day. 

I just went to the cupcake side on this visit, but plan on trying the ice cream in the future.  I ordered a "Doggie Cupcake" priced at $2.50 that is sugar-free and has a yogurt frosting. It had a cute little orange bone on top. My dog, Brownie loved it! She licked the top off first and then ate the rest. I had a "Lemon Meringue" that was very good. The lemon cake had graham cracker lining and delicious tasting lemon curd in the middle. The top had toasted marshmallow that was good, but had a chewy outer layer that was tough to eat, so that was all that was left of the cupcake I didn't finish. They have tables and chairs outside of the store. As I was sitting there eating my cupcake, Candace Nelson the founder of Sprinkles came outside to greet customers. She was very sweet and signed autographs and took pictures with people, including myself! They have a decent amount of tables and chairs outside, but they were pretty filled up and the inside of the store was busy yet the line moved along smoothly. 

There is a cupcake ATM outside (near the ice cream side) on the patio and it's open 24 hours. The cupcakes are still $3.75 each, but come boxed so you have to pay the extra 50 cents. Hubby had a strawberry cupcake that I tried a bite of and liked, so I got one of those from the cupcake ATM to see how it worked. The ATM is user friendly and the screen allows you to see your cupcake coming to you from inside the store to when the door lifts open on the ATM revealing a pink box. I thought it was cool and even though the store is open late, it is neat knowing you can get a Sprinkles cupcake at any hour. 

Hours:
Sunday - Wednesday 10 am to 12 am
Thursday - Saturday 10 am to 1 am

A lifesaver during my last Vegas trip. My first mistake: assuming everything there would be fattening and unhealthy like every other crepe place. But wait! They have fresh cleansing juices. Oh my! I've never been into juicing but this place changed my mind for sure. 

Have you ever become FITTER during a Vegas trip?!? Well, it happened to me. I was very pleased with the surprising results. How did it happen?

All hail the **Detoxifyer**! Densely packed with kale, celery, apple, beet, ginger, and lemon, the juice is delicious compared to many of the healthy concoctions out there. Of course it can't compare to a sugary juice, but it does soooo much more.

I had arrived in Vegas knowing I would be attending a pool party at Wet Republic after 4 days of eating terribly. There were no vegetables or good salad options anywhere around. So I had a feeling I'd gain weight by the time I had to don a bikini. But hey! Detoxifyer to the rescue! One juice once a day for 3 days was enough to do the trick. On the 4th day I put on my swimsuit and was actually impressed. I couldn't believe it.

If you need something more substantial to eat (I did), try **The Fitness** crepe and add Alfredo chicken to the mushroom spinachy mozzarella goodness. I split one of these with with my friend and also had the Detoxifyer.

The only thing I'd change about this place is the system to indicate when orders are ready. They have to shout the order number out and then people come up and take items without having to show a receipt. Maybe a more automated system that shows a number and patrons have to show proof of purchase. My order was stolen twice! Granted the MGM Grand was overrun by about 15,000 people from my company's convention. But still, such a system would help even on a daily basis.

Overall I love Blizz for introducing healthy juice options to me. Thank you to the clerks for the recommendation! And special thanks to the Detoxifyer! You've really opened my eyes.

DATE TIP: The Detoxifyer will definitely get you ready for your next hot Vegas date. 

TIP: [[[ T.M.I. Alert ]]] Remember that what you put in must also come out. You may have to use the restroom slightly more often than before, and things may look the same color as when you consumed them. The Detoxifyer is a vivid pomegranate color. Haha, I told you it was TMI. You've been warned!

The owner of Primp and Blow, Melodi Harmon, left me with such a horrible taste in my mouth, I had to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, something I've never done before. Here are the problems I experienced with the services:

-When I booked my appointment for a facial, blowout and makeup application, I made it clear I needed to be done no later than 4:30 p.m. and also mentioned an Arizona Spa Girls special I was doing when I booked my appointment. The person who booked me gave no indication she wasn't aware of the special, and she told me to come in at a certain time so I'd for sure be gone by 4:30 p.m. since I had dinner reservations. The makeup artist was late, so the facialist graciously started applying my makeup for me, even though she wasn't who I was booked with.

-When I checked out, right at 4:30 p.m. when I was supposed to have been gone by, the guy at the desk ran my card incorrectly twice and supposedly refunded the purchase--the third time it was ran, it was locked out because Bank of America froze it for fraud because it was run so many times in a row. Also, the owner, Melodi, (who called another Yelp user a pig in an e-mail---not surprising) puzzledly asked me at the desk about whether I was sure about the special--something that was not only insulting to me but also showed her lack of customer service and communication with the organizations she deals with. She said she'd e-mail me a receipt and get payment later, since I was late and my card was now frozen. I was unable to use my card the rest of the night and the next morning and had to rely on my friends to pay for me. I then had to spend more than a half-hour talking to Bank of America to unfreeze it.

-After saying she'd e-mail me a receipt that weekend (and telling me in a phone message that she had e-mailed it twice more), Melodi then called me and told me I needed to call my bank again to ask about the charge. I e-mailed her a screenshot of the statement from Bank of America showing there was still a pending charge from her, which my bank said she simply needed to push through. I spent another half-hour talking to them about this, being placed on hold, being transferred, etc. I spent more time combing through more than 1,200 spam messages in my Gmail to find the supposed three receipts Melodi sent me--nothing came up, and when I called her about this, she had someone at the front desk call me to get my "correct" e-mail--she had never sent me a receipt like she said.

-I tried to explain to Melodi that the time I had spent trying to fix the problems she caused (maybe 3 hours or more) made me feel like it was unfair to pay for the services I received. I would pay for my Clarisonic facial brush I bought once I got a correct receipt. She e-mailed me two more incorrect receipts, showing her lack of conscientiousness and unawareness in general. She then threatened to call the police and press charges against me for stealing--though the whole reason why I didn't want to give her my credit card info again is obvious (I didn't want her to freeze it again), and I wanted to know the correct amount of cash to bring to the salon.

I support local businesses immensely and would never steal from one. Her unwillingness to remedy the situation demonstrates her cluelessness as a business owner. I'm disappointed because of her inept ability to deal with customers effectively.

UPDATE: Primp and Blow posted this on their Facebook page. They don't care about Yelp users.

"We just needed you to pay for the stuff you took and the services you had. It has been over a month. Did you really think you could get away with not paying? It was sad that it took me threatening to call the POLICE on you to get you to pay! Thanks for paying it was the right thing to do. :-) Who cares about yelp!I I do not. ;-)"

From a master of seafood comes; well, nothing new.  And, it's a good thing.

Mina's flagship restaurant.  The dining space exudes a warm, contemporary elegance.  The excellent service, practiced and friendly.

Tip:  The restaurant offers a special vegetarian tasting menu, 

Tip:  Pass on the tasting menu and opt to order a la carte.  Larger, more complete portions and many signature dishes are not featured elsewhere.

To start, the caviar service.  Three types of osetra caviar are offered.  Opt for the least expensive (the preparation will mask the subtleties of the caviar).  Have it prepared as a parfait (a potato pancake topped with crme fraiche, cold smoked salmon and topped by a mound of caviar).  The nutty, yolky goodness of the caviar enhances the oceanic flavor of the salmon.  A shot of vodka pairs perfectly, striking the palate clean between luxurious bites.

Wanna give the perfect gift to your favorite sad, pitiful, unfortunate foodie from Cali?  "Whole Roasted Foie Gras".  Literally a foie roast, the entire foie is pan roasted and carved table side accompanied by a brioche pain perdu (custardy French toast), an assortment of pears including one sauted in brown butter, a sweet date puree with strong notes of cinnamon, allspice, and anise, sauced by a red wine reduction and dusted with foie powder.  Perfect flavor combination.  Well balanced richness. 

For mains, pass on steaks.  You can get them anywhere.  Focus on the sublime Maine Lobster Pot Pie; tender, juicy poached whole Maine lobster in a truffle lobster cream and root veg.  The phyllo crusted sole, perfectly cooked, perfect textural contrast of the phillo crust surrounding a moist, clean flavor of the sole.  The fish sits atop a rich crab brandade (crab mixed with potato and olive oil), the peppery essence of the olive oil adding complexity.  Both components are tied together by a tangy mustard sauce.  Finally the Miso glazed Chilean sea bass.  Simply put the best, most refined miso fish you've ever had.  Nuff said.

Outstanding wine list.  Typical Vegas resort prices

Tip:  Reservations for prime tables and times can be hard to come by.  Book a month in advance with open table.  Platinum and Noir mLife members book through the mLife site for a guaranteed table on short notice.

Simply put; worthy.

FOIE GRAS...F-orget O-ther I-nsignificant E-xperiences G-et R-eady (for an) A-mazing S-andwich at Goodwich.
That is what possessed me to drive from Henderson to Downtown with a growling stomach looking for a unique lunch and not settle for everyday boring because my usual lunch date has stomach issues.
I get to this little shack around 12pm with normal looking people standing in line...not a weird downtown crowd at all. I didn't know what everyone meant by "OG"...until I looked across the street and saw OG Topless Bar (good landmark)...maybe where the bad witch lives lol.
I walked up to order looking at the simple menu (with descriptions of ingredients, yay) knowing I was going to try the much talked about "Foie" even though I had a lot of apprehension from never having eaten foie gras in my life. I was bewitched by all the positive descriptions everyone posted about this sandwich that I had to have it...good, bad or otherwise I was going to try foie gras today. The gentleman who took my order was very reassuring that it would be a treat for me and that at $9, it was a great way for me to try it and not break the bank. I found an empty chair to eat that made me feel like I was a young student at school having my favorite sandwich at lunch.
As you can already tell, I LOVED it! Such a strange combination to put together but it all works. Foie gras mousse/terrine that had a creamy texture with light earthy, almost truffle-like hints (not at all gamey), this very crispy thick chicken skin (like when you hit the crispy skin jackpot on a perfectly roasted chicken), chopped almonds, and pickled purple cabbage that made sense as a necessity to cut the richness of the foie gras, all inside a grilled crunchy white bread that scrapes the inside of your mouth a little. Creamy, crunchy, savory...I couldn't believe this taste explosion that I enjoyed with each bite to the last. Oh yes. I finished the whole thing! I was really blown away how
 much I enjoyed this sandwich. It was life changing lol. It would be wonderful to see Goodwich occupy a space in the upcoming Galaxy Market in the Arts District...a space for artisanal foods, craft brews and aspiring restauranteurs.

If this is a new trend of having tasty steamed buns ("bao" if you read it in Cantonese) following a foot race I'm loving it!  

I had the pleasure of ordering and eating from this food truck (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/great-bao-las-vegas?select=IYXd86zCnkTdXHihCywYNg#RRkCwVYiUUhxC2gY4bScQA) back in December after participating in the Las Vegas Great Santa Run as it and another dozen or so food trucks were all lined up in the race assembly area ready to feed the nearly 10,000 Santas who turned out for the event.

The Great Bao truck was easily one of the more popular trucks with a steady line of people ordering food and another group waiting for their orders.  I waited too, but it was until the crowds diminished before I put in my order.  The menu was pretty simple (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/great-bao-las-vegas?select=IYXd86zCnkTdXHihCywYNg#nLQH80BQIF9oW2S7iGVl1g).  They basically had four types of steamed buns, bagged chips and refreshments.  The buns were pretty inexpensive at $3.50 each or 3 for $10.  The 3 bao combo also included a drink and a bag of chips!

I'm not sure what I was thinking when I placed an order for 2 buns instead of 3.  I didn't realize my mental breakdown until I had paid for my order.  Maybe it was the temporary meltdown of having run hard for a short distance race or maybe I was just wacky from seeing all that red from the people in Santa suits at every direction I turned.  Anyway, I ordered 1 Roast Duck bao and 1 Pork Belly bao and nothing else since I had collected an armful of race refreshments from other event sponsors.

By this time the staff had their routine down to perfection, and my made to order steamed buns (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/great-bao-las-vegas?select=IYXd86zCnkTdXHihCywYNg#Sd1ztJyGREFdt-vAbJi7ng) were ready lickety-split.

The Roast Duck bao was delicious.  The plum sauce was just sweet enough as to not overpower the taste of the roast duck, and I loved that they included a piece of green onion which reminded me of the Peking Duck and steamed clamshell buns we enjoy at Chinese banquets.  The piece of duck I had, however, was a bit dry and slightly burned as you can probably notice in the photo that I've posted.

I lucked out on the Pork Belly bao as they gave me a huge piece of pork belly with very little fat on it.  Even though there was a sauce, a smidgeon of what looked like minced pickled veggies and a sprig or two of fresh cilantro all I could really taste was the delicious pork belly and the subtle sweetness of the steamed bun.

This was my first experience with any Las Vegas food truck and I liked it ... a lot!

Finally a solid option in my neck of the woods. I've never been to a Barro's Pizza until a few weeks ago when they opened up one a couple of miles from my house.

They have a spacious dining room with a self serve soda machine, including Diet Dr. Pepper, and one flat screen TV in one corner of the room. They might want to consider getting another TV. You order at the cashier and they bring your food to you. My wife and I go here when we don't feel like cooking.

Major kudos to Barro's Pizza for not price gouging on pasta like a lot of places. Seriously, I've been to casual restaurants that want to charge $10-$12 dollars for penne with meatballs. At Barro's, you can get a small plate for less than $4 dollars. And that's plenty to fill an adult up at lunch. I tried their Calzone for $8.95. It was okay, nothing to write home about. It included a couple of toppings. They certainly don't make the world's greatest pizza but it's decent and very economically priced. My wife loves the garlic bread, but it's a bit too garlicky for my taste. Note to management, start serving artichokes for pizza and don't chop those onions so small.

Most of the time my wife and I spend about $7-$12 dollars to eat here unless we order a pizza. They have sandwiches which I haven't tried yet. I am eating my way thru their entire menu so I'll eventually try all their offerings.

I gave away our card with 4 stamps at the end of the meal.  THAT'S how sure our group was that none of us would ever return.  

This isn't sushi in the Japanese sense.  These are crazy freakin rolls/inventions that contain some raw fish in, on or around them.  Calling this Japanese is very misleading.  The typical roll on the menu sounds like this:

"Tastes and smells like your bitchy ex-mother in law's 1st semester college sophomore roommate who did the whole lacrosse team on a dare and got Hepatitis C roll:  Baked inside out roll stuffed with eel, cream cheese, bbq sauce, avocado, super super super white tuna, chopped yellowtail and spicy tuna, shishito peppers, scallop, garlic and salmon on top with orgasm, yum yum, and fuck me in the ass sauce on the side."

As you can see, they used the whole "I Love Sushi" concept and took it way over the top.  This could be a potentially fun dinner (as many Yelp reviews can attest) trying all the insanity but there were enough misses to warrant my negativity.  It wasn't fun, but it sure was funny.  

- Sushi rice was off.  Slimy?  Low quality?  I don't know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.  I see a lot of reviews raving about sashimi though.
  
-Speaking of sauce...what's up with drenching sauce all over nigiri?  Several pieces of nigiri came with sauce on top as a default.  We actually had to request it without.  Freshness of the fish was ok.  None of us died afterwards.  

-Pretty sure that was shrimp cocktail drenched in a soy sauce base and topped with scallion advertised as amaebi. 

-1 order of green tea was not green but it might have been due to the lipstick contamination on the side of the cup.  The liquid was a very, very light brown.  The server claimed it was green tea despite my protest.  Magically, the next cup of tea was suddenly very green.  So that's where Dirk Arthur has been performing all this time!!

- I didn't know uni came in so many colors.  The most suspect pieces were left on the plate.  The server didn't even question it.  She just took them away like she knew.

- My native Japanese dinnermates found the tamago presentation to be hilarious.  A tamago house!

At least the unagi was good.  Congratulations on well cooked eel!  Have a good life.

Fuck this place.

Yes, I said it and even after 6 years, I will still say it.

So the girls and I are on a tear it up Vegas weekend. All very cute and sessy gals for the record and all gals who appreciate the less than finer things in life like fake boobied strippers, over-priced drinks and titty bars. 

So we cab it over to the Crazy Horse Too after hearing that THIS was THE place to go. We roll up and instantly get static at the door. You can't come in without a date. Um, okay, well we are a bunch of girls with lots of money to spend? NO! But...? NO!

So we walk a few feet away and regroup while trying to keep the temper of one Drunky MaGoo down to a manageable level since the a-hole of a door guy was especially rude to this one girl in our group. I suggest grabbing a few guys and rollin in with them. I mean who cares, we can ditch them at the door but at least it gets us in. So we latch onto said guys and walk up.

Door guy says, NO!

I say, "You said dates, these are our dates. We are in love, let us in." (Mind you I'm drunk and his anger is amusing me at this point)

Door guy says, "fine you can come in, but that one stays out!" (pointing to my friend)

I say, "Come on, don't be THAT guy, did mama raise you to be THAT guy? She just really wants to see some boobs, surely you can relate."

Apparently he couldn't, but I also think he was suffering from mama abandonment issues and clearly wasn't loved enough as a child, but I digress...

He then decides that none of us should be allowed to come in. Fine, I'd rather not go if my friend is going to not be let in, so just give us our money back and we will go spend it elsewhere, right?

Apparently this is when the poor chap lost all sense of hearing as i became invisible and mute in his eyes.

"Excuse me, I said we'll go. Can you please just give us our money back?"

"Hello?"

"Umm"

"Yo!"

Retard Roy then starts smirking and it is quite clear that the four of us who "got in" will not be getting our money back, even though we technically never even entered the club. 

I then followed up with calls to the establishment the next day that were (to no surprise) never returned. Maybe they are in cahoots with Prime Time Shuttle as their customer service seems to be pretty dead on.

So if you are a girl don't go here. If you are a guy, have at it, but why waste your money on a place that won't let cute girls in who might actually go home with you for free. Just sayin.

Straight out of Cali and family owned. This location was originally built to be a Dunkin' Donuts, but DD never opened. I'm glad Tom's swooped in! You will find a variety of options on the menu here from burgers, tacos, burritos, sandwiches, bacon & eggs, pancakes, steak, pork chops,  fish & chips, salads, smoothies, and Mediterranean & Greek options, and believe it or not much more! They have some pretty good all day specials if you like breakfast.  Seniors 55+ get a free cup of coffee with any breakfast or lunch purchase.

Hubby and I decided to split the "Pastrami Sandwich Combo" priced at $9.59 plus 40 cents for cheese. The combo came with fries and a drink. I also wanted to try the "Zucchini" priced at $3.99 and it came with a side of ranch. The pastrami sandwich was SO good. The bread held up the sandwich well and the mustard and pickles were just right. I know this is something that I will for sure be back for. Good pastrami in Vegas is hard to come by. The fries were excellent. I wasn't actually crazy about the zucchini. The ranch that it came with was a decent size though. They make the onion rings and zucchini from scratch. I want to try the onion rings next time, but will pass on the zucchini again. 

They have a drive-thru if you don't want to eat inside. The burgers are made fresh to order and the steak and chicken is hand trimmed on site. There are a lot of things I want to try here at Tom's so I will be back!

Probably my mother's favorite place for siu laap!  Since she lives in Glendale, I'm often asked to be the delivery gal to bring her roasted duck, boiled chicken with the head still on, and roasted pork whenever she needs to do some Chinese ceremonial tradition.  If it's not me she's forcing to do the grunt work, it's one of her co-workers.  Regardless, even if it's on the east side, it will always show up to Mommy W. fresh!

I first came across this place when my friend invited us out for dinner.  It seemed to have all your Americanized and authentic foods.  Service can be a bit of a wait but it's definitely worth your time.  Kudos to the chef for making such amazing flavorful food.  Prices are reasonable and the place is clean.  I haven't tried any of their lunch specials but my friend says they're pretty decent.  They make a delicious Mussels with Black Bean Sauce and their Salt & Pepper Shrimp is pretty amazing as well.  And there's nothing like some rice soup [aka porridge] when you want something warm.  It's the Asian chicken noodle soup [comfort food].  I stick with either the pork with the century egg or the fish fillet porridge.  Momma W. makes it best but Best Hong Kong Dining is a close second.  

The only reason why I don't frequent here as often as I should is because parking is always a pain.  There are some other eateries and a grocery store in this strip plaza so parking can be pretty sketchy.  You know us Asian drivers.  Look out!  :P

We had a wonderful evening here last night after sitting outside in our heated car for forty minutes. LOL

Well as you might known, it's been cool here in the valley lately. And, sitting outside for a table to free up wasn't an option. Which BTW, I believe sums up nicely our thoughts of Basil & Garlic. Who would wait forty minutes in the cold, for a table unless it was something special?

And special it was, owner Nadine came over and welcomed us.  She was sweet and warm, both to us and everyone in the restaurant. That was how the evening went and you can understand why so many people flock here. 

We started with a salad with a home made Italian dressing for only $1.50.  For dinner we ordered the Chicken Parmesan with Angel Hair for $15.95 (photo) with a side of Sausage ($2.85). The cutlets were huge and very flavorful. We also ordered the Lasagna for only $13.95. It too was huge and meal for two. 

I cannot convey how wonderful the evening was and how pleased we were with the food and the warmth of our host.  The food was Four Stars plus and the value over Five Stars.  Our bill came to a very fair $36.75. 

Enjoy!  We look forward to our next visit.

The fanciest Afternoon Tea i've had so far!

Awesome view-= can see the strip from the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel near the Aria and Vdara Hotels. 
We came to our reservation a bit early and luckily being the first ones there, we got the best seat in the house, on a couch right in front of the windows! The lounge is not very big and it's right next to the check in desk lobby, so it's not a ideal place to come with a big group. 

Three of us got the Classic English Afternoon tea set at $36.00. 
Tea service is daily 2-5pm. 

You get a choice of tea, 4 tea sandwiches (smoked salmon, egg salad, curried chicken salad sandwich, and black forest ham), 2 small scones served with a very thick cream cheese like Devonshire Cream, pineapple marmalade and strawberry jam, and a selection of petit desserts.

Presentation was superb. Although everything was petit, i thought it was very filling. The sandwiches were yummy. (They are flexible with the sandwiches if you have food restrictions). I didn't love the salmon one, as it had a strong herby flavor. 

The teas were my least favorite. From the last 4-5 afternoon tea experiences, I have loved my tropical black tea choices. When i saw mandarin orange black tea, i was excited. However, when i drank it, it has a strong chinese herbal flavor to it, which i wasn't expecting and kind of clashed with the sweet desserts and sandwiches in my taste... We tried the monkey picked oolong and white tea, and none of them really had us craving to have more. 

Despite not loving the tea flavors, the experience was great and we enjoyed the view. The lounge itself is pretty gorgeous with all the colors. Check it:

Level 107 Lounge is on the 107th floor of the Stratosphere Tower. That's the best thing ... and worst thing ... about Level 107 Lounge. The bar is great because it's near the top of the tallest tower in Las Vegas offering a vast 360 view of the city and dessert ... while it's bad because the Lounge is in the subpar Stratosphere. 

It earns 3-4 stars for a pair of reasons.

** Reason #1: Free
You can ride the elevator up to level 107 without purchasing a ticket to the top. Why pay $$ to go to the observation deck on level 109 when you can go to level 107 for free? The Lounge is close to the center of the tower and you can't get next to the windows, but the view is the same Vegas.

** Reason #2: Happy Hour BOGO
Happy Hour occurs twice per day at Level 107 and serves a limited selection of "signature" cocktails 2-for-1. Early Happy Hour is 4:00 - 7:00 pm and (really) Late Happy Hour is 1:00 - 4:00 am. Each cocktail is $15 and both must be the same. The 10 cocktails available for the special include Lemon Drop, Blue-tini, Cosmic Cucumber, Chocolate Masterpiece, Last Tango, Mango Madness, Summer Mint Margarita, Razz Jito, White Peach Margarita, and Summer Sangria. You can also get some appetizers for half price during the early happy hour.

My wife and I popped in for some happy hour drinks and to catch sunset. It was easy to get to the top and even easier to order. To see the LV Strip, sit on the side with the Bar. We chose $15 Chocolate Masterpieces with Van Gogh Chocolate Vodka, Godiva Chocolate Liqueur, and White Chocolate Liqueur. Round 2 was two $15 White Peach Margaritas with Sauza Silver Tequila, Peach Schnapps, White Peach Puree, and Sweet & Sour Mix. Both drinks were SUPER sweet as you'd expect with names like that. It was happy hour and I was on vacation with my sweetie, so, I guess it was ok to throw back a few sweet cocktails, too.

Note that it didn't seem "required" that drinks were purchased either, so, I guess you could just go to Level 107 Lounge for the view (I think). Self-parking is free at the Stratosphere.

The view from the Observation Deck may be better, but instead of spending $18 for the elevator ride to the top, spend $18 ($15 plus tip) on a couple cocktails while enjoying the view relaxing in the Level 107 Lounge.

There are few places that I make a decision to NEVER step foot into again. Yasu has earned this dubious distinction from me. 

First, let me give you my background with sushi since this came into question from the manager himself. I have been eating sushi for about 11 years. Some really bad sushi, some amazing sushi. I have mentioned in previous reviews that I have had sushi fresh off a boat in Hawaii. While I don't claim to have had ALL the sushi in the world, I know what good sushi and what good sushi service is. 

Second, let me tell you that I have had omakase (chef's menu) in several locales, so I know what it entails. 

I was with a group of friends on my highly anticipated visit to Yasu Sushi Bistro. We had made a reservation and were seated immediately. We quickly decided to indulge in the omakase menu. We wanted the best that Yasu Sushi Bistro had to offer! I always say "Hit me with your best shot!" 

Well... if you have nothing to do, and aren't hungry...you should do the omakase menu. It took Thirty Minutes between courses. And please don't think we were given platters full of food. This is more like 2 small oysters per person, A plate of 1 shrimp, a couple slices of King Claim, a dollop of Spanish mackerel tartar on a bone chip.... So think tiny gourmet food. So think how hungry and irritated I was Two HOURS later. In a 3.5 hour visit, we had consumed Four tiny dishes. I really tried to be patient, but this is absurd and unacceptable! I finally asked for the check as we wanted to leave and go eat elsewhere. I expressed my displeasure at the slowness of the meal. 

Now before you Yasu lovers roll your eyes and shake your fingers at me. Let me put it in perspective. At ANY restaurant, it is unacceptable to be the first table to arrive, watch subsequent tables seated, and fed, and watch them leave and you're still waiting to be fed... you would be ticked off too. Now add to that a condescending manager who comes over to talk to you and asks if you have ever had an omakase experience before and tries to piss in your pocket and tell you that it's raining. Unacceptable. Now, add to that the restaurant sending out another dish after you had already asked for the check and then CHARGING you for that dish even though you said you didn't want the dish. 

I have nothing against the food, though it wasn't very imaginative on the SUSHI level. What killed the entire visit was the slowness of the courses, the response of the management, and the lack of ethical treatment in regards to the check. 

I will never visit Yasu Sushi again and I bet my stress level will be all the better for it.

So long Pink's, hello The Wiener's Circle! I was sad to see Pink's go, but the location was never going to work with the jacked up prices and confusion with the names they gave the hot dogs compared to what they are actually called at the original location in California. So, The Wiener's Circle enters in its spot. Will it last? Time will tell! I must admit, I did watch the TV show they had on a while back and found the games they played with the customers (at night they curse at the customers and play crazy ass games... It's intended, expected to all customers and hilarious) funny. I was surprised they opened up in Vegas, but hey it saved me the trip to Chicago for the moment! The original location in Chicago has been in business for over 30 years.

Looking over the menu board, I was surprised at how fair the prices were. The prices here range from about $2-$3 higher depending on the item compared to the Chicago menu. Being in a casino we can expect higher prices, but they weren't too outrageous. I ordered "Wieners in a Blanket" priced at $4.99 for 6. They are made fresh to order. I had my choice of sauce and chose honey mustard. That honey mustard had a real good flavor and paired nicely with the tasty blanketed wieners. They also come 12 to a order, but the 6 was good enough for me. Priced at $4.99 I also ordered "Cheddar Fries" and wow were they good! The fries are fresh cut and come 1 pound per order. The cheese they put on top was very good! Hubby and I split a "Char Polish" priced at $6.99 and came with mustard, relish, onions, pickle, tomato, celery salt and sport peppers. It was pretty good. Next time I would ask for a lighter char, but a decent hot dog with nice toppings. All the burgers and dogs come with those toppings unless you tell them to leave it off. They are happy to customize your order so just ask! If you are in a pinch for time you can phone your order ahead and just pick it up. Aside from lunch and dinner they also serve breakfast and offer Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

Vegas local, here. I live at MGM/Signature.

SLS is at the very last Monorail stop at the far north end of the strip where the old Sahara hotel used to be. SLS definitely isn't 'ghetto'. I try to reserve that word for hotels like The Stratosphere and Circus Circus that truly are low-class, both inside and out. But let's just say the SLS is underwhelming. You can probably skip this place on your next Vegas trip.

The whole establishment gave me a really negative feeling inside. I'm not a New Ager so I don't really buy into the idea of positive and negative "vibes" or "energies"... but I've gotta say, something felt off about the place. Other things just left me scratching my head.

One of the head scratchers is the hotel's theme. What's their target demographic? Who are they trying to appeal to? They had a Pancake Griddle in there with a line of senior citizens out the door. The wait time must've been two hours or more. But then adjacent to that, they're trying to promote a nightclub. I can easily envision a late evening scenario where the long lines of seniors (some with walkers, wheelchairs, etc.) who are waiting to eat at one of the restaurants gradually gets intertwined with the twenty-somethings waiting for the nightclub. Seems like that could be awkward.

The floor in one area of the hotel was covered with what appeared to be fur or hair. I suspect there were farm animals in the hotel at one point. But why?

The part that bothered me the most though was the massive, rather intimidating security presence on the casino floor. Felt like I was in Ferguson, MO. or something. I took out my iPhone to video one of the restaurants that I thought had a really interesting decor, thinking I'd post it on my Facebook -- but within seconds, one of the guards approached me and said that no photographs or videos were permitted in the hotel. The dude wasn't messing around and I'm not exactly an alpha male who's prone to challenging people, so I quietly complied and then subsequently deleted the video.

He was professional and respectful to me and went out of his way to let me know why no photos are allowed: "because of 9/11". Really? Because of 9/11? I was tempted to give him a "What'choo' talking' 'bout, Willis?" because every other strip location I've visited seems to have no prohibitions on videos/photos (unless you're trying to video a card game, etc.) -- but whatever.

Anyway, I kind of feel like the SLS views all of their patrons as suspects or potential threats. I hightailed it out of there and likely won't return. The whole thing makes me realize how important it is for me to stay in my "safe zone": Caesars, Mirage, Aria, Cosmo, Mandalay, Fashion Show Mall, and of course my home base at MGM. People seem to like me at those places and value my business (or at least they do a good job of faking it) but man, if I stray a bit too far north, it's downright hostile! 

My recommendation is to skip SLS. So many great hotels in this town. No need to waste your time here.

On a recent trip to Las Vegas we stayed at The Cosmo for two nights. I had stayed there once before and wasn't a fan but had a much better experience this time around. Our room was beautiful. It had a balcony and a huge tub over looking a great view of Vegas. The room was very nicely decorated with a Jonathan Adler feel. 

The gym had great equipment and a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. But they did not offer bottled water, only a water machine with cups, which is not easy to drink while working out. 

There aren't that many breakfast options, which I found frustrating. The main breakfast restaurant had a long wait each morning and the grab and go food only consisted of pastries and coffees. Nothing healthy or fresh. 

The restaurant options in the hotel are quite vast for lunch and dinner. Milos is by far my favorite for lunch and dinner. We also had a nice lunch at China Poblano. 

*Tip: Milos offers food to go, so if you want to eat dinner in your car on your way back to LA get Milos to go rather than having to stop for fast food!

I had been wanting to give this place a try for sometime now. The location on Eastern is 5 star all the way, but the same vibe isn't felt at this location for me. The menu board above the register is painful to look at because it's awkwardly hanging. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu and checking on us while eating. I ordered a "Pizza Puff" combo priced at $4.50 plus 50 cents each for the addition of chili and cheese to the fries, onions were free. The pizza puff had cheese, sausage and sauce inside. It did taste ok. It reminded me of something you got for school lunch when you were younger, but in a very slightly better way. The basket of chili cheese fries is over $4 alone, so upgrading your combo with the addition of chili and cheese for just a buck makes it cheaper for the same size. The fries were good and the onions very fresh. The chili was not god though. I have had canned chili that tasted better. The basket of fries was a huge amount, but I really didn't eat but a few bites and then just couldn't eat anymore so a lot was wasted. I'd give the food here a 2 star rating alone, but I'm factoring service and cleanliness inside, so 3 stars seems fair. They do have some seating outside with umbrellas on the tables for shade. There is a bar with maybe 6-ish stools to sit at or you can sit at a table, but the tables are small (most seat 2 people) and if you get stuck sitting along the back hall area it can feel cramped. Currently on Tuesdays they offer wings for 50 cents each.

A very good friend told me about this Irish pub not too long ago, and since then this family-operated establishment has been one of my go-to destinations for live music and Irish cuisine. The atmosphere is dim lit, bustling, and equipped with several TVs for local sports fans here and there. The dcor starts with an open patio, and a horseshoe bar surrounded by a score of booths and tables. Last Friday the Sullivan's were on hand to provide the live music that rocked the house.

The Jinky's Famous Chicken Wings ($8.99) arrived with ten sizable drumettes and they were spicy delicious. The meat was a tad on the dry side, and I wished there were a number of actual wings that could appear on the plate. On the other hand, the explosive flavor was quite striking, addictive, and good to share. This is a good dish to order during game day.

Their Corned Beef and Cabbage ($11.99) came with prime pieces of corned beef, boiled cabbage, potatoes, carrots, horseradish sauce, and mustard. The thick cuts of corned beef was a tad chewy, but there was plenty of flavor to go with the creamy horseradish and pointed mustard seeds. The cabbage and potatoes were sensational. Portions were generous and good for two meals. This is one dish that I would recommend.

The Grilled Basa ($9.95) came with a strip of perfectly buttery blackened basa. The fish was tender, flavorful, and had great moisture so it was easy to fork into. This dish also came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes nicely whipped with a mix of potato skin here and there. Fia thought the fish was a tad too salty, but we both really liked the mashed potatoes. 

Service was friendly, efficient, and fast. My drink was not refilled the first time, but service was much improved during my latest visit. The atmosphere really picked up once the Sullivan's came on stage. Eventually it got a bit too loud and hard to chat across the table. A cool spot to catch a game and enjoy their live music. I would be interested in coming back to try their Fish 'n Chips and Irish Whiskey Bread Pudding.

I have been stopping by here for lunch and like the subs I have had. Inside is very clean and the employees are friendly and say hello when I walk in. They have plenty of tables if you want to eat inside, but I get my food to-go. The meat is sliced fresh and the sandwiches are made to order. Sometimes they can get busy around lunch time and since I'm on a time limit for lunch, I just call in my order for pick up so that it's ready when I arrive. 

Hook and Ladder - A medium costs $5.99 and includes a pickle. The sub has smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham and monterey jack cheese. I like it "fully involved" which means it comes with deli mustard, mayo, onion, lettuce and tomato. Per my request they leave the lettuce off. The subs are served hot and this sub is my favorite of them all. Usually I don't like deli mustard, but there is something about it on this particular sub that just makes it taste great. 

Firehouse Meatball - A large costs $8.49 and depending on your appetite could be shared between two people. This sub has Italian meatballs, provolone, marinara and Italian seasonings. I usually order this one "sweet and spicy" which means they add pepper sauce and red pepper flakes. I really like this meatball sub a lot. It's always hot, the bread good, meatballs good, melted cheese good, but..... there is a consistency issue with the taste of the sweet and spicy part. Sometimes it's just right and sometimes they put so much pepper sauce that it's too hot. When this sub is good it's very good, but when it's drenched in pepper sauce it's hard to taste anything else. 

The medium sub is just perfect for my appetite. If you are the type like my husband who eats 1 footers, you might want to order the large sandwich. They also offer catering.

My sister and I were debating between restaurants and finally settled on Tonkatsu Kiyoshi. We took a little long in deciding and ended up arriving at 9:55- they close at 10. I really didn't want to be THAT jerk, but I was so set on katsu at this point that I poked my head in and asked if they were still open and they graciously gave us a table. The owners here are from Hawaii and the service definitely reflects that- genuine, helpful, and you can tell they take pride in what they're putting out.

The potato salad we started with was more vinegary than I'm used to for Japanese style, but delicious nonetheless. It was smooth with cubes of crisp apple and cucumber throughout, and distinctly eggy from the shredded egg lacing through it.

The katsu was a work of art, truly. Perfectly cooked cal rose rice with crispy golden sliced katsu over the top. My sister had the chicken and ebi combo while I opted for the katsu curry. Miso soup comes with all meals here, and it was definitely a robust version. 
The chicken and shrimp came with cabbage salad with Yuzu to dress it on the side, as well as some pickled shallots. The cabbage salad was a perfect fresh compliment to the crunchy fried katsu goodness. Everything was cooked perfectly and the shrimp were gigantic and absolutely incredible! The menu stated that they use black tiger prawns and they weren't kidding.
The katsu curry was very flavorful and the curry itself was thick and could stand up on its own. This dish came simply with pickled ginger and was enormous! All portions here are enough to make two meals out of, unless the katsu is so overwhemingly addicting that you just eat until you pseudo-hate yourself.

Being that it was my first time here, I was a noob to the whole sauce bit. I've never ground my own sesame for katsu sauce, it's just always arrived with my meal! The waitress saw me and came over to explain how it worked and got it started for me. She also had to open my bottle of Ramune for me =( A+ for service, but next time I come in I'll be pro!

I wish I could give this place 6-stars. I even changed my last meal on earth in my profile to Bacchanal Buffet- it was that good.

Weekends are WAY more expensive because of brunch. We had a little mishap when we called and asked for prices and were given the wrong information. When we told the cashier that- she said that we should have called the buffet and not the hotel. WTF- you work there, right?

Anyways- it was off-season in Vegas, so we only waited about 10-minutes before being seated. Because it was brunch, mimosas were complimentary and we were going to get our money's worth. We 

I seriously could list out all the food that I ate, but that would be a super, super long review. If you want to know- you can see the photos I posted while here. Everything was scrumptious!

A couple of standouts:
- Beef brisket: It was smokey, tender and came in a big slab on your plate. You could break apart the meat with your fork with little effort. This one of my favorite things.

- Eggs Benedict with skirt steak: A small individual portion served in a cast iron skillet. The egg yolk was calling my name from across the restaurant. I ate two without any effort, but had to contain myself before going back for a third. They also have this same dish with fried chicken instead. I wanted beef. The meat is tender and has that nice grilled flavor. Break the egg and it's like a slop of heaven soaking into your bottom piece of English muffin.

Quail egg flatbread: This came lathered with small little over-medium eggs and bacon. The outer crust was crispy and you heard that crunch when you broke it apart or took a bite. It definitely had that wood-brick oven taste, though, I'm not sure how it was cooked. 

I am just going to say that you HAVE to eat here at least once. Like a tourist destination, you should make it a PRIORITY. Screw the bodies exhibit, screw the Grand Canyon- you need to go to Caesar's Palace for their Bacchanal Buffet. It's seriously worth it.

I decided to check out Commonwealth for its opening weekend and I'm glad I did- this place is amazing!  Located in Fremont East right next to Le Thai, locals have another bar they can hop to during the course of the evening.

Get your ass inside and find a beautiful, expansive space with plenty of seating.  Admire the art and lighting while enjoying a craft beer or fancy cocktail.  Or, better yet, admire the beautiful bartenders pouring your drinks.  I was thoroughly digging on the boys in suspenders.

There is also an outdoor patio area upstairs if you want to smoke or enjoy the view of Downtown.  I believe there is another bar up there as well.

To get an idea for drink prices, my husband ordered a draft beer (Alley Cat Amber, which was really good) and I had a well drink.  They came out to be about $7 a piece.  Someone next to us ordered a sidecar (that looked yummy) and theirs was $9.

The crowd was diverse and included hipsters, cool kids, and quite a few guys dressed in suits.  Everyone was friendly and enjoying their time at Commonwealth.  Someone even bought the bar a round of shots (before it got too crowded, of course).  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the crowd stays the way it is and doesn't get overrun with bros.

We got in around 9:00 or 9:30 (on a Saturday) and it wasn't too busy and we were able to find a seat at the bar.  An hour later, however, was a completely different story.  There were wall-to-wall people and standing room only.  Depending on if you want to just chill or you're out to mingle, you should keep this in mind.

What made me fall in love with this place so much?  Was it the gorgeous atmosphere?  Was it the friendly crowd and staff?  Was it because they stole my iPod to create their music playlist?  Maybe it was just the cute boys in suspenders?  Well, whatever it was made me fall pretty hard for Commonwealth and I'm anxiously awaiting our next date.

Pizzeria Bianco isn't just a restaurant, it's an institution.  Ever since I moved to the Valley of the Sun five years ago, I've watched peoples' eyes glaze over as they ramble on and on about how amazing the food is there; many argue that it serves up the best pizza in Phoenix (if not the country).  Why it took me so long to get there is a mystery but after going today, I can unequivocally say that the rumors are all true - it is fabulous!

LOGISTICS: Nestled in the Southeast corner of Heritage Square near the Arizona Science Center, Pizzeria Bianco sits in a rather small brick building with an outdoor patio and charming little bar.  While the space restriction makes for a more intimate dining experience, I could easily see this place becoming swarmed with diners during peak hours; so perhaps coming before or after the main lunch/dinner rush would be a good idea for those who are patience-challenged or in a time crunch.  Park in the structure off of 5th and Monroe - the restaurant validates your ticket (I ended up paying $0 instead of the usual $12).  

FOOD: Wow!  Just wow!  I ordered the Market Salad, which consisted of fresh local cantaloupe and honeydew melon, cucumbers, mint, red onions, and peppers served in a yogurt dressing; it was hands-down one of the most creative and refreshing salads I've ever had!  They serve their sodas in old fashioned glass bottles and bring freshly-baked bread with olive oil to your table - haven't had olive oil that good in ages!  If you can't decide on one pizza combo, they're great about doing halfsies.  I ordered a half Margherita, half Rosa (red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, and Arizona pistachios) pizza - both were sheer perfection!  Crust is heavenly, ingredients are beyond fresh, innovative toppings - who'dve thunk pistachios would taste so good on a pizza?!      

SERVICE: Pizzeria Bianco runs like a well-oiled machine.  The service staff is amazing - both friendly and fast.  They greet every single guest who comes and goes - pretty impressive! 

I don't really think you can go wrong here.  I came in skeptical but left a believer; somehow they worked their magic over on me - another happy Pizzeria Bianco customer.  A thousand flies can't be wrong!  ;)

In a word, Twist.  

The mere idea of the word is enough to send your token foodie's stomach into a conniption fit of pure desire.  The mere whisper of the word is enough to trigger endless blogging and tweeting due to sheer sweaty-handed anticipation.  The mere realization of the word is enough a road trip all the way to Lost Wages to see what all the fuss is about.  

And so it was done.  Off to the south Las Vegas strip we would go in search of langostine (among other things), prepared in the manner of a man who pretty much put langostine on the map.  

Being the gastronomic simpleton that I am, I decided I couldn't pass up a grand opening invite to the first ever dinner service at Twist by Pierre Gagnaire (December 5, 2009).  But in lieu of a ginormous appetite, what I really should've packed was my brain.  Food this complex, this multi-layered, and this (pardon my crude undertone) "weird", simply can't just be engulfed.  It requires several hours of thinking, ruminating, pondering or whatever-the-hell-it-takes to justify paying $400 a head for arguably one of the fanciest and most thought-out meal you'd ever dream of having this west of the Mississippi.  It's been days since engulfing this meal and I STILL can't wrap my head around it (and my stomach definitely had its work cut out for it too).

Surprisingly, it took nearly 5 hours to complete this marathon of a 6-course tasting menu plus 6 courses of added appetizer supplements (note: every single thing I ate is pictorially posted here).  And don't you dare go on thinking that I'm slow and that 12 courses aren't all that much, because under Pierre Gagniere's roof, that really means like 36 presentations.  Do the math.  

Throughout this marathon dinner complete with cocktails and fine wine, Voss water and a few $8 diet cokes sprinkled in "here and there", I began to realize the perplexity as this:  Pierre Gagnaire is, quite truthfully, an enigma of a man.  Forget that he's Michelin starred-this, iconoclastic-that.  Forget that he practically invented all that we have come to realize is "fusion" cuisine.  And just forget that his so-called eponymous "other" location on Rue. St. Balzac near the Champps Elysees is thought of as being the "3rd best restaurant" in the world by Restaurant Magazine (El Bulli in Spain is the 1st).

Pierre Gagnaire creates an inspiring vision for this type of weird food, which is, not surprisingly, just weirdly delicious.  He's even a lovable weird guy himself, so appropriately charming and entertaining us like a "crazy uncle" might do during his brief cameo at our table.

And as we were appropriately informed by our server David, the whole idea is to "taste and experience" all the ingredients which God put on this earth, which might occasionally occur in 1 singular dish.  This is most evident in the first of 3 presentations of Gagnaire's "Shellfish Royale" - somewhat of an oyster extravaganza with a backdrop of toasted beef gele and shallots, as well as his last presentation of "King Sea Bream", a curiously concoction of a "bonito-shellfish gele" with mozzarella ice cream.  I loved the fact seared scallops aren't even safe from Gagnaire's innovative antics as "black olive gelee" provides a certain Mediterranean setting, but then squab breast and foie gras come in to steal the show.  The end result of these seemingly contradictory flavor combinations and layers is this:  each bite resembles something that you have never ever tasted, with few ways to describe them, save for these vague examples --  My first time eating Pierre Gagnaire cuisine allowed me to taste 5 different representations of the langostine, including the unmistakable "head", allowed me to taste (and like) seafood mixed with cheese mixed with meat, and allowed me to eat something that tasted like the splendor that exists in a tidepool.  

Overall, do I have any idea what this means?  Not on your life.  The only thing I can muster up is that a dinner under Pierre Gagnaire's roof is absolutely positively unlike any other eating experience you will ever have.  Ever.  Go there, and you will see.  The originality of it ensures that you cannot and will not be disappointed.

Protip: BUY the groupon!! 1 admission for $12; 2-people admission for $21; and 4-people admission for $42 as of 2/24/2014. Yes, it gets cheaper if you buy more. There is almost always a groupon going on for this place! Always check!! Beats paying $20 per person there. 

*ALSO* if you buy a groupon for 4 people, but you just want to go by yourself/just with one other person, they will write a coupon card with the remainder! This way you can use your remaining groupon visits each time you come in with the card! So go with a friend or by yourself, they're accommodating for whichever groupon you purchase!

This is a korean spa tucked away on Sahara and Maryland. Not visible from the major streets. Ample parking.

I absolutely adore this place! You walk in, pay, and you're free to enjoy the saunas or pay extra for their facials/other spa services they offer. If you've never been to an asian sauna, (I know I was confused) here's some helpful step-by-step tips:

FIRST: After paying, they hand you a waterproof wristlet key for your locker; towels; baggy T-shirt + pants to change into for sauna. There's also disposable razor blades. Feel free to ask for extra towels and slippers! Some of the room floors are HOT. Trust. 
Go to your gender segregated room; take off your street shoes please!! Look for your real locker after the tiny shoe lockers. Deposit your stuff and bring any bath stuffs. Undress completely. Yes, it's one of those spas. You're nude. Get used to seeing other nude people as well. Haha.

If you're body-shy, wrap yourself with your itty-bitty towel. Head to the shower place room past the lounge area with the sinks/mirrors. There's rows of showerheads/mirrors along with generic shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispenser in case you didn't bring your own tote. Pull up a stool and have fun manipulating the temperature. To get a hotter water temperature, just know there is a red button to push in as you slide it toward you. It's a safety measure. Can you say unlimited hot shower?!

After, you can enjoy their 2 hot bath pools or their cool temp pool. Please don't go in without scrubbing/washing yourself proper! You're meant to go in nude for sanitation purposes. There's a dry sauna in this room as well.

Head back to your locker and change to your baggy T-shirt and pants. As you're barefoot, marvel at how clean everything is or just wear the slippers you asked for at the front desk. Head upstairs for the co-ed saunas now! 

There's a caf, lounge area with korean TV playing, and the sauna rooms. 

ROOMS: The clay ball room has giant tubs filled with tiny clay balls that are HOT as you get in. It is a bit noisy as you get in and out. Careful not to slip when you get out! 

The jade room is a room with large mats. Lie down with a friend, plug in your headphones, relax to the herbal-infused air here.

There's a water dispenser where the food bar is. Be sure to drink plenty of cold water!! Plenty of fluids are lost when you're sweating this much.

The red clay room is one of faves as well. Be warned, the floors are searingly hot as you step in. Clean house sandals/flip-flops are the way to go! The red domes each have a mat and a light control switch in there. It doesn't get too bright though. My friends and I play card games crammed in one dome haha. Easily the hottest room, sure to sweat your heart out. 

*Look for the wi-fi password listed outside this room!*

FOOD: The caf does have pricey food. I believe it comes with banchan (multiple korean side dishes like kimchi) with whatever meal you order. We normally get the hard-boiled eggs ($1 each) and the delicious sweet rice drink. Super refreshing. Hand them your key # and you pay when you return your key at the front desk.

One of my favorite rooms is the frozen room. Small. Feels like sitting in a mcdonald's freezer, only without the gross frozen McRibs and the self-loathing. Very nice change of pace from sweating.

After all that sweat, it's a good idea to head back downstairs, strip again (throw your sauna clothes in one of the large chutes), and take another shower. They also have standing showers at one end if you want a lighter shower. 

AMBIANCE: it's never super crowded whenever I go, especially during the weekdays. Very soothing. Quiet normally. 

Have a hangover? Stressed out? Come here. It's fun to go with friends. It's slightly awkward being naked around each other at first, but it's also a great place to bond, hang out, and have a girls' day. You know it's love when a friend scrubs your back! Also a fun date idea. My skin always feels amazing when I leave. Super affordable, fun, and a great experience! Absolutely my favorite place to detox and relax.

Coco Donuts is locally owned and opened recently. After seeing the pictures on yelp, I just had to try one of their cronuts! Walking in there was a nice sweet smell in the air and the inside was clean and colorful. I saw there were cronuts left and asked the woman behind the counter to go over the flavors with me, which she did and explained the prices. Hubby and I chose to get a 1/2 dozen donuts and a cronut to try.

I chose the "Raspberry Cronut" priced at $3 and wasn't crazy about it. The icing was just too overly sweet and the raspberry filling reminded me of Welch's jelly. I could only eat a couple of bites because it was just too sweet. The cronut was also tough and not flaky like I'd imagined. If this is what Dominique Ansel's taste like, I'm not missing out. Next time I will try one without icing and see how it is.

-Raspberry Filled.... Same Welch's style jelly and the glaze was just too sweet. 

-Apple Filled... This one was good. There was a good amount of tasty apples in the center and the donut was very soft.

-Sugar Twist... Very soft and good, but nothing spectacular. 

-Cinnamon Roll... Soft, a bit too sweet and again, nothing spectacular.

-Chocolate Long John... This was very soft and delicious. It was also a decent size. 

-Chocolate Iced Bavarian Cream... The bavarian cream had no flavor, but the rest of the donut was good.

The donuts here are very, very soft. They are also a good size for the price, but this is just an average donut shop to me. Nothing really stood out and even though I love sweets, too many of the donuts here were just too sweet for me. The woman behind the counter was nice enough to give is 4 donut holes to try and again, they were melt in your mouth soft, but the glazed were just too sweet while the cinnamon sugar believe it or not was perfect. They have a punch card so if you are here buying donuts by the dozen the card will benefit you. The regular donuts are currently 95 cents each and the coffee prices $1.75 - $2.50 so I plan on stopping back by and trying out the coffee with a different cronut or donut to see what it's like.

Half Dozen $5.50 - $5.75
One Dozen $9.50 - $9.95

Specialty and Fancy donuts range from $1 - $3.50 each.

Monday - Friday: 5 am - 6:30 pm or sell out 
Saturday - Sunday: 5 am - 3 pm or sell out

Whoahhhh!!! Now this is what i call a throw down!

Of course, i'm referencing Bobby Flay's inventive cuisine at his southwestern themed restaurant in Caesar's palace, Las Vegas.   

It was our first night and after winning a grip of change form the slots at Caesar's, my friend suggested eating at Mesa Grill for din din.  I wasn't too familiar with the restaurant but when I realized it was Bobby Flay's joint, my interest was certainly piqued.  

Truth be told, i'm not a Flay fanatic by an stretch, but a little star power never hurt anyone IMO.  With that said, there's always the pressing issue of hype over substance which in turn had me proceeding with cautious optimism.  

As we made our way across the bustling casino and stepped into the restaurant, I definitely felt the warmth of the contemporary Latin theme throughout the communal dining space, which was flanked with rich reds and soft golden hues. 

Within moments, the hostess greeted us and proceeded to lead us to our seats.  Our server wasted no time in taking our orders, as well.

In record time, we got our beautifully plated appetizers and entrees. 
Let's just say my doubts melted away with my very first bite! Wow, this food had big, bold flavor and the quality was incredible! 

Here's a rundown of what we had:

Shrimp tamale - Plump, juicy and mouthwatering gulf shrimp in a fresh corn meal that was both rich & flavorful. Outstanding! 

Tuna nachos - Fresh chunks of seasoned ruby red tuna in a sweet & tangy sauce that had a pleasant citrusy finish. The crisp corn tortilla added a nice contrast in texture to this refreshingly vibrant dish! Lip smacking goodness in every bite!

Pork tenderloin - This dish was absolutely phenomenal!!! The meat was like a perfectly cooked filet! It was soft, buttery and rich. Perfectly decadent and oh so flavorful! Honestly, the meat was so tender, i kept asking my friends "Are you sure this is pork?" 

Spice Filet - Buttery, tender and succulent beef filet with a pleasant kick from the house spices! Scrumptious!

Lamb chops - Beautiful crust and perfectly pink inside. Boasting a magnificent charbroiled flavor that was absolutely addicting! Seconds please!

Corn - Fresh cuts of corm kernels with explosive flavor and fantastic texture. This is a side you don't wanna miss!

After consuming all that delicious food, we simply had no additional room for dessert. Besides, wehad our minds set on some chocolate decadence at Max Brenner's afterwards (review forthcoming)

Overall, service was attentive, friendly and fast. The food, of course, was incredible and most importantly, it didn't break the bank either!

Why? Because this birthday boy didn't have to pay...lol

Happy Eats!

Forgive the lateness of this review. Usually when a new ramen-ya opens up in LV, I line up outside the door on opening day. Problem is that I've recently entered a PsyD program that has completely consumed my life. I'm lucky to sleep 2-4 hours a night before having to go to work and then school. 

I actually didn't have time to come here today, but one of the students in my learning group really wanted to try this place out and he even offered to pay for it. I couldn't say no to a free lunch. 

So, we have a lot of odd ball ramen-yas here in Las Vegas. Typically, in other cities in America, the most common variations of ramen are: Sapporo, Tokyo, and Hakata. But, here in LV we have a rare Kurume ramen-ya and an Osaka ramen-ya which dominate our ramen scene. I've lived in the Japanese districts of Los Angeles county and have never seen a Kurume or Osaka variation. But, even though Las Vegas has so many rare variations of ramen, we have never had a Tokyo ramen-ya.  And back in Los Angeles we had 100s of Hakata ramen-yas but only one lonely Tokyo ramen-ya. And that LA Tokyo ramen-ya just happened to be......KORAKU. So, you can see why I don't know what a good Tokyo ramen is supposed to taste like. But, after reading Hooto's review, I knew it had to be good. If a man who is from Tokyo is vouching that a restaurant has a good Shoyu ramen, then it erases all my doubts. 

The prices here are very low compared to the KORAKUs in California. My bowl of Shoyu ramen was only $6.95, compared to the $11 I paid 5 years ago when I last went to a KORAKU in California. 

The first thing Japanese people do when they enter a new ramen-ya is ask "what regional variation of ramen is served here?". When I asked this at the California location, the server said " I is... don't know". When I asked here, the server immediately answered "Tokyo". I was really happy that the servers had a lot of ramen knowledge. BTW, I miss the days when Japanese restaurant owners used to force their non-asian workers to learn to speak Japanese.

KORAKU gives a free slice of Naruto-maki with each bowl of ramen! Sora, Fukumimi, and Monta don't do that. 

My Shoyu broth was perfect. My Dad grew up in Hawaii, and he used to tell me that Shoyu broth is best when fish bones are used instead of traditional chicken. KORAKU's  broth did have a hint of fish, but it wasn't very noticeable. Anyway, I thought it was very good and much better than Monta's Shoyu. 

I loved the thin yet slightly curly noodles. Shoyu is always supposed to have thinner curly noodles, but no other place here in LV does that. Sora has curly Sapporo noodles but they are way too thick for Shoyu.  

I liked the ramen so much that I called my Dad in California and told him that I found the best Tokyo Shoyu Ramen-ya in America. My Dad is one of those guys who insists that ramen on the mainland can't compare to ramen in Hawaii so he told me to shut up.

A friend told me that KORAKU had Tan Tan Men. When I showed up, it turned out it was Tanmen. I can't count how many times in the last 10 years this has happened to me. 

It sucks how this place had to open up during the same week as Monta part 2(which many of us Sansei/Yonsei have nicknamed "Monta Strikes Back"). I noticed that Monta 2 is always extremely busy while KORAKU usually only has 2-3 people in it. For some odd reason which I will never understand, people here in LV have this idea that Monta is "the best" and that all ramen should be compared to their Tonkotsu. This is far from the truth. I've only met a handful of Japanese people who think Monta is "good ramen". Most Japanese people I know think Monta is one of your typical Las Vegas "tourist traps" and cannot compare to Katsu & Daisuke's Fukumimi or Yoshi's Ramen Sora. 

I encourage all Japanese-American residents of Las Vegas to support KORAKU. I know that these days there are only like 5 of us left in this whole city...but just do it anyway...

It's in the name. They like to smash burgers! The menu says they use 100% certified angus beef. The burgers are fresh, never frozen, and cooked to order. If you prefer chicken instead of burgers you can find that here too.

Yesterday I picked up my favorite the "Avocado Club" (crispy chicken) for lunch priced at $6.99 and it was delicious. The all white meat crispy chicken has nice flavor. The sandwich had bacon that was freshly cooked, not microwaved or something questionable. Also the sandwich has lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing on it. I love the fries! I'm not picky about how skinny or fat my fries are as long as they are good and these fries paired with the garlic they put on them makes for a nice side to your sandwich or burger. The "Fried Pickles" priced at $2.29 are not good at all here. I have tried them twice now and they are way too greasy. 

They offer a few different salads if burgers and chicken aren't your thing. Also on the menu is the "Spicy Black Bean Burger"  for you veggie burger eaters. For dessert (like you have room) they offer Haagen-Dazs shakes! They range in price from $3.99 - $4.29 and you can get classic vanilla, chocolate and strawberry or you can go for a oreo or nutter butter shake. The "Nutter Butter" is super tasty. There is a kids menu and they serve Coke products (yay coke) and beer. 

I must admit that I only ever come here with a coupon. I signed up for the e-mail club and for my birthday I get a free shake and throughout the year I get coupons for BOGO on entrees. I always present my coupons before I place my order and have never had an issue. There is a offer with your yelp check-in for 10% off any SB meal, but they wont let you combine it with a coupon you already plan to use so I haven't even redeemed mine yet. Nice lunch spot especially with a coupon.

I finally made it over to Pink Box Doughnuts to see what everyone has been raving about. I will say one thing, you cannot compare Pink Box to places like Dunkin' Donuts or Winchell's because they are simply different. After having Pink Box, I can't see ever going to one of those chains again when I can go to a locally owned shop and taste the love in each bite. These doughnuts are made from scratch daily.

They have the doughnuts broken down into 3 different types: classic, specialty and gourmet. The classic such as "Glazed" or "Buttermilk" are $1 each. The specialty doughnuts like the "Bavarian Creme" are $1.25 each and gourmet favorites like the "Fat Elvis" or "Date With A Nutty Pig" are $1.75 each. They have half and full dozen boxes (pink of course!) with prices ranging from $8.50 - $12.50 for those.

I saw on Facebook they were now selling "Cronuts" so of course I asked about those. They were sold out! I spoke with Lance behind the counter who said they had made Cronuts 3 times that day already. I went just after 11 am so apparently people are scrambling to try them. Not having tried the original from NYC, how can I really compare it though? I guess I just want to taste it and get some sort of idea what it might be like. I will try again! Lance says you can just call ahead and if they have the menu item you are looking for then they will hold it for you. 

So I decided that I needed to try the "Fat Elvis" after hearing about it and I am kicking myself for not trying this sooner. DELICIOUS! It is just flat out good! The Fat Elvis is topped with chocolate icing & a caramelized banana, and filled with a homemade peanut butter & banana filling. This doughnut had me feeling stingy since I didn't want to share a single bite with hubby, but I had to darn it!

The 'Apple Fritter" needs some work. The texture is perfect. It is soft and chewy inside, and crunchy on the outside where it needs to be. The thing that gets me is why it's called an apple fritter if there are no apples in it? I didn't bite into a single apple! Boo-Hoo!

When I saw a Doughnut with fruit loops on it I had to give it a try. I was told by a worker that this was called the "Fruit Loop Doughnut" and I get the fun concept, but it just doesn't work. The long glazed doughnut is really good, but the fruit loops they put on top just absorb the glaze they rest on so they are soggy and chewy. 

Last and certainly not least is the "Cinnamon Tornado" and I have to tell you, it lives up to the name. When I took the first bite it was like a tornado of instant flavor, and it seriously melted inside my mouth. Very yummy.

There was a sign out front that said they are now open 24 hours on weekends.

Dang, Cantina Laredo - I wanted to like you so hard!  Like a hot date that ends in a restraining order, like an incredible hike that ends in poison oak or skunk spray - I've walked past this place for years, imagining a swanky, high-end Mexican food joint behind the dark windows and high prices; sadly, what I found was a very regular, uninspired restaurant serving up some rather meh Mexican food.  This was a 'man behind the curtain' Wizard of Oz moment for me.

Good things?  Mmmmmm - the warm spicy salsa which they serve along with another milder cold one (not so good) and chips is the reason this place gets 2 very enthusiastic stars from me - SO DELICIOUS!  It was hook-me-up-to-a-feed-bag delicious.  Service was quick and pleasant.

After that though, it all goes downhill.  Being vegetarian, I can 99% of the time find something meatless and tasty when I go out to eat but there were very few such options here.  I ended up selecting the Enchiladas de Espinaca and subbed in a Cheese & Onion one to shake things up a bit (I know, I'm very exciting).  When my meal came out, the waitress said she had the kitchen put zucchini alongside my Mexican rice instead of beans (wtf - who in their right mind opts out of beans for zucchini at a Mexican food restaurant?!); so began the first of my meal modifications - I might note here that while being veggie, I am a pretty low-maintenance diner.  So, just as the black beans are being brought out, I realize the sauce atop my cheese enchilada consists of red chili with beef chunks - again wtf - in my 31 years of life on this earth, no Mexican food joint I've ever visited has ever converted a cheese enchilada to a meat one via the sauce!  The waitress said they could make me a new cheese & onion with sour cream sauce atop (cringe).  The mushroom and spinach enchilada was kinda gross - something about the oil they used to saut the spinach in gave it a strange taste and the button mushrooms looked like they had been plunked into it straight out of a can.  The zucchini and cheese & onion enchilada were nothing I would ever want to order again.  Black beans were alright - hard to mess those up though.  

In defense of Cantina Laredo, if you're a big meat eater, perhaps you might have more luck here than I.  The place was clean, the workers were nice, the one aforementioned salsa is killer.  But this place is neither authentic nor new-agey Mexican, not worthy of the steeper price points, and certainly lacks any great ambience to carry the lackluster food.  Don't think I will be auditioning this place for a second date or hike - would strongly consider rolling around in poison oak or getting skunk sprayed over coming back - it was that bad.

I have been wanting to try Due Forni for a while so I was glad to finally try it. Here they offer pizza, appetizers, salads, mozzarella bar and have a selection of wines.  They have 2 different ovens for 2 different types of pizza. The "Neapolitan" had a crust that is more soft and thick and the "Roman" had a crust that is thin and crispier. 

Since I was here having lunch with a fellow yelper who has been here several times, I asked her suggestions as far as portion size and what was good. She said the pizza was huge and filling so we decided to split a pizza and salad. I can't remember the name of the salad, but it was the special of the day and delicious. The figs were very tasty and I'm usually not a fan of arugula however everything paired well and tasted great. Then came time for the pizza. We ordered the "Quattro Formaggi" priced at $15.99 with the roman crust. This pizza had buffalo mozzarella, parmesan, fontina fontal and ricotta on it which made for one cheesy delight. All the cheeses were perfect together and tasted very good. This pizza usually comes white, but we requested red sauce made with san marzano tomatoes be added and the sauce is boss! The crust however I wasn't a fan of. I found the roman crust very chewy and tough to eat so I would try this pizza with the neapolitan crust next time. Another thing is I was still hungry when the bill came so I wouldn't share again since I could have easily eaten 3 pieces of the pizza and all of the salad *oink oink*. Service was great and I will definitely come back to Due Forni.

How much would you pay for a popular & busy buffet with hundreds of quality choices?

   A: $54
   B: $74
   C: $94
   D: Anything ... just let me in the freakin' buffet already

Be prepared to pay any of those prices at Bacchanal Buffet cause this is the current "It" buffet in Vegas. Caesar's Palace can pretty much charge whatever they want. The line is KuRAAAYzeee. We tried to go for dinner Monday before Christmas and the line was 3 1/2 hours long. That's over 200 minutes. We read on Yelp about an "Express" option for $20 extra, but it wasn't available that night. We left.

So, we came back on Christmas Eve for a late lunch. The set-up was different and line much shorter ... because it was a 25-minute line to put your name in for a time slot 3 1/2 - 4 hours later. The registration part is cool if you can wait. I can't. Luckily, the "$20 Express" option was available at that time. Whew! Seriously, I would of paid anything to skip the wait. So, after paying $74 for lunch per person, we headed to ... the next line. It took another 25 minutes to get seated with express. 

      This better be one hell of a buffet!

            It was. 

Here's what I pigged out on for a couple hours ... 

Meats & Seafood
 - Chilled Shrimp
 - Chilled Crab Legs
 - Warm Crab Legs
 - Rack of Lamb
 - Oysters on the Half Shell
 - Prime Rib
 - Sausages
 - Chicken
 - Ribs
 - Mussels
 - Chinese-style Crab
 - Crawfish

Sides
 - Caprese Salad
 - Sliced Pineapple
 - Pho Noodle Soup
 - Turkey Pot Pie
 - Charcuterie Meats
 - Cheeses
 - Steamed Dumplings
 - Creamed Leeks & Lobster
 - Sushi Rolls
 - Cranberries
 - Sliders
 - Bread
 - Crab Benedict
 - Chinese Broccoli

Desserts
 - Fresh Crepes
 - Red Velvet Whoopie Pies
 - Gelato
 - Creme Puffs
 - Vanilla Creme Brulee
 - Chocolate Creme Brulee
 - Buttercream Pops
 - Cheesecake Pops
 - Berry Mousse Tarts
 - Fresh Cookies

Bacchanal Buffet really is a great buffet. It is, of course, overpriced and hardly worth the wait, but if you want quality and choices like this in Vegas you have to either pay for it or have the patience of a very bored saint to stand in line. When you do finally get into Bacchanal, go nuts on the seafood and meats so at least you feel like you're making it worth your money/time.

If their Shanghai Xiao Long Bao  is the only item on their menu, I would still be dropping by this latest Chinese restaurant to open up in Las Vegas's greater Chinatown area. Now before you all go crazy and question why it is only getting 4 and not 5 stars on Yelp, let me explain.

It is good, not the best I've ever had, but I enjoyed it. In fact, after my unplanned XLB crawl of the 2 newest restaurants that serve it to open up on the west side, I can say A & K Chinese Restaurant (aka Heng Long Chinese Restaurant, if going by their name on the credit card receipt) was the clear winner of the head-to-head XLB CHALLENGE over Edamame Restaurant on Wednesday, May 7th, 2014.  

You don't have to take my word for it though. What I think is "good" could be "that is the worst, flavorless blah blah I have ever had!"  (Funny random thought: what if water is being judged right now?)

Anyway, seems like we are blessed with more and more XLB options in Las Vegas, which means to make it, the chefs all have to up their games. Translation: consumers are the winner. Yay!

I also had their Three Treasures Dumpling  (12pcs) per order and it was pretty good too. The fact they hand make these is just wonderful.

On my first visit I also tried their Pan Fried Pork Bun  (8 pcs) $7.95. If you go by yourself, this item alone will be enough to send you home with a full belly. It was just okay, the doughy bun on the outside is thinker than what I have had in Taiwan (which was THE BEST  at that busy night market), so maybe not fair comparison.

Beef Pancake Roll  $7.95. Decent. There are better ones I have had within a 2 mile radius.

Hot Purple Sweet Potato Juice , small $2.25. It was an experience to try this. It is basically purple sweet potato drink, not really sweet, but a creamy dessert alternative beverage.

Service overall was good.  I happened to have been there when they were not busy, so that might have helped too. Plus I can speak enough Mandarin Chinese to get by in restaurants, so that certainly helped.

Decor/Ambiance was pleasant. Music playing in the background was not Chinese, but instrumentals of popular American songs, which you probably wouldn't even pay attention to unless you focus on it.

Price/Value: I think it was good overall. 

Note: this is NOT your typical Chinese takeout restaurants. I must admit I am not familiar with most of their menu offerings, because I am not at all an expert on Shanghainese cuisine. But they also described their cuisine as  (New style of Jiangsu and Zhejiang - per Google Translate, which is still like Hexcodes to me). But come for their XLB, and if you are adventurous enough, you can explore their other menu items.

Expect an UYE for Xiao Long Bao  crawl and another one to just explore this restaurant's menu (yeah, I am definitely gonna need backup).

Bonus: Love that American Express is accepted along with other forms of credit card payments.  :)

***I was disappointed with O; it could just be that I am not a big fan of Cirque du Soleil shows, but I felt this one had quite a few boring parts and it was expensive (but understandable considering its popularity); there were definitely some great spectacle moments, but not enough for me to truly enjoy this one***

The first Cirque du Soleil show I saw was Ka and after having seen Mystere and O since then, I think Cirque du Soleil is not for me.  I liked Ka though I thought it was a little slow in parts and did not have much in terms of high flying acrobatics.  Mystere had more acrobatics, but it had no story (only a series of vignettes) and it just kind of meandered and did not have the spectacle of Ka.  O is kind of like a cross between Ka and Mystere.  It has the spectacle of Ka and the disjointed series of vignettes with no story of Mystere.

The signature element of O is the water, of course.  It is nicely done, but it does get repetitive with all of the synchornized swimming.  They do a lot of nice diving elements including some very high dives that is impressive.

Despite the uniqueness of using water (which definitely goes well with Bellagio given their fountain show), I actually preferred the stage at Ka more.  I found that much more interesting and that along with some stylized touches and uses of curtains and lights made Ka feel much more cinematic.

Ka also had a storyline.  While it was not a great story, it did connect the scenes fairly well.  With O, there is no story.  It is much more like Mystere where there are just a series of acrobatic vignettes including mini-sections with clowns (while I did not love the lightly comedic clown elements of Mystere, I thought they were better than the clowns at O--the scenes were slow, uninteresting and not funny).

While there was no storyline, I think they could have done a better job of tying the vignettes together given the underlying connection of water.  There was not really an embracing of the water.  There were horses, a safari landscape and men dressed in long red coats and white wigs (they seemed to come from a different show all together).  There was even a maid, who pushed a laundry cart, and picked up the clothes (left thrown on the floor after a performer clothing change on-stage); pushing the cart was kind of all she did (I did not get that one; for all I know, Bellagio housekeeping could have just accidentally wandered onto the set).

I think more ocean-themed vignettes would have tied everything together though it could have potentially resulted in cheesiness if not done right.

Still, there were bright spots.  The first trapeze vignette, high above the water, was really interesting and I have not seen a trapeze act quite like the one at O.  It created kind of a nervous and exciting anticipation that was truly special.  The diving was good.  It did get a little repetitive, but there were some great dives--both from high up as well as exciting moments where divers were launched across the stage like rockets).

The arena was beautiful.  There was a greatly lit blue dome above seating and the opening and closing of the red curtain was nicely and very interestingly done.  Seating was comfortable too.

Ticket prices are expensive.  Because of O's popularity, it is hard to find discounted prices for O.  You could probably find similar tickets for Ka at maybe half the price and even less for Mystere.

O might be the most iconic show on The Strip so it is definitely one to consider if you are traveling to Las Vegas for the first time or are a big Cirque du Soleil fan.  If you are not a big Cirque fan or have never been to one of their shows, I would suggest seeing one of their more price friendly shows like Ka or Mystere first to see if this is the type of entertainment you really enjoy before paying the high prices for O.

Like other Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free and self parking.

I've had this Bosnian restaurant bookmarked for some time and finally my friend and I were able to stop by for dinner. Located in a tiny strip mall, the dcor was neatly arranged with cultural artifacts, white table clothes, and the atmosphere was spacious and cozy. 

The menu was smaller and more affordable than my visit to Saraj. We decided to start off with a Home Style Bean Soup ($5) filled with light tasting Bosnian beans and chunks of beef here and there. Very hearty as the bowl warmed the belly. The beans boast wonderful flavor with hints of beef to render depth. The owner was very generous to give us a second serving so there was plenty to share.  

Next, the Stuffed Cabbage ($5) arrived with boiled cabbage stuffed with ground beef that came with onions, peppers, and other seasonings with a dollop of sour cream on top. The cabbage was soft, naturally sweet, and easy to bite into. The ground beef had some pop due to the seasonings with a nicely broth to bring to a finer note. They were much bigger than the ones at Saraj as there were plenty of ground beef to fill the center. So delicious, it's something I'm eager to have again.

Their highly recommended item, the Bosnian Sausage Sandwich ($7), came with 10 pieces of small Bosnian sausages sandwiched held in-between two thick fluffy fried breads. The bread was slightly browned and crispy on the outside and spongy on the inside. The sausages were savory delicious and wonderfully seasoned. The sandwich also came with creamy red pepper sauce and raw onions to ignite sweet and sharp contrasts.

The extra fried bread for the bean soup was superfluous. Service-wise, the server was Bosnian but not particularly knowledgeable about the cuisine. The owner, however, was very warm, friendly, and managed to come out of the kitchen to greet us and address questions. Interested diners should know that they also have authentic Bosnian items that are not listed on the menu. 

4.5 stars. Cheaper, bigger, and better than Saraj. This is one of the most overlooked places in the Valley. I would love to come back to try their veal and assortment of desserts.

I'm a fan of Papa Murphy's. Some people are weird about buying pizza and sides that they have to bake at home, but that's just some people being weird. There is usually some type of deal going on and they send coupons in the mail, so with any type of deal it is really worth it considering what a frozen pizza costs and tastes like. You can call your order ahead or stop in and watch them make it fresh. You can choose lighter or extra sauce, cheese and toppings to customize the pizza to your liking. The employees inside this Papa Murphy's are friendly and helpful with going over specials, but when I went on grand opening day, the people there from Sunny 106.5 were very rude and didn't help represent Papa Murphy's well. I was actually relieved to find out it was the radio station being so rude and not the actual Papa Murphy's employees because it would have detoured me from going back. I did score a free pizza (the very last one, nice!) because they were giving out 100 free pizzas to customers that day. 

They have pizzas of all shapes and sizes. They have the mini-murph pizza kit to take home so your kids can put together a pizza for themselves and then see their creation after it bakes. The pizzas also come in signature, pan, delite and stuffed crusts. Most of the pizzas bake at 425 and only take around 10 minutes aside from the stuffed pizza which takes around 25 minutes. The pan pizza is definitely good, but beware when cooking the pan pizza and keep your eye on it because there is butter or something at the bottom of that one and it can burn easy if you let it go too long and when you take the pan pizza out of the oven it's really hot, so let it stand for 5 minutes before slicing. The cheesy bread comes in regular and thicker sizes, both being equally delicious. With a coupon I usually pay about $6 or $7 for a pizza and adding 2 sides it's $6, not including the thicker cheesy bread. One thing I tried on my last visit that I hadn't before is the s'mores dessert pizza. Wow that thing was good! I preferred the s'mores pizza much more than the chocolate chip cookie dough they offer and it is a great price as one of the 2 sides you can pick. My hubby likes the cookie dough here, but I personally do not. If you are signed up for the e-club they usually send you a coupon for free cookie dough on your birthday. They also have pumpkin shaped pizzas at Halloween time and heart shaped pizzas for Valentine's Day, usually at a special price that I like to pick up. All in all this is a decent take-n-bake pizza spot.

YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!! FINALLY! This location has been set to be a Tommy's for a longggggg time, but I guess there was an issue with the billboard being too close to the building or something. Who cares why it is open now!!!!!

There isn't much parking directly out front of this Tommy's (there is handicapped parking) however this Tommy's shares the whole parking lot with the rest of the shopping center and it isn't a far walk at all. If you are a true Tommy's fan the few extra steps wont kill you and since you are likely to be eating chili here you can use those few extra steps! There is also a drive-thru. It appears that because the drive-thru has little space that they only put in the few spots up front to detour accidents and want customers to park in the shared shopping center spaces.

It didn't surprise me to see this place packed when I walked in. There was a long line of hungry customers. I got in line while hubby kept an eye out to snag a table. The girl who took my order was very friendly and repeated my order to make sure it was right. I then made my way to fill up our drinks while the order was being made and grab some good ole Tommy's napkins. The napkins here are more like paper towels and necessary when eating here! 

The food was ready and I was ready to dig in! I ordered a #4 "Chili Cheese Dog, Fries and drink" priced at $8.55 after requesting my drink be a large and adding chili, cheese, mustard and onion to the fries. Yum! I had to cut the chili dog in half and share it because it was hearty. The fries were delicious and held up the chili and other toppings perfectly. Hubby ordered the "Caliente Burger Combo" and gobbled it up. Our friend ordered a "Chili Tamale" priced at $3.25 and he really enjoyed it. We left very full and satisfied! 

Anybody who has been to the original location at Beverly and Rampart knows the nostalgia that goes with that location. There will never be another like it, but we can certainly be thankful to have a location right here in Las Vegas to go to and make memories. Thank You Tommy's for branching out of California and making your presence in Nevada!  

 "If you don't see the shack - take it back!"

My new favorite place for Mexican food! When I heard there was a new Mexican restaurant serving a taco with a fried avocado on it, I knew I had to give it a try! When hubby and I walked in we were greeted by a woman who took us to a booth and took our drink order. When you walk inside there is a decent size cantina on the right and the dining area on the left. I noticed the dining area half full of customers so I took this as a good sign. The chips, salsa and bean dip brought to the table were delicious. The salsa could have been a bit more chunkier for me, but it tasted very fresh and good. 

I ordered "Tacos Del Campo" priced at just $8. This was 2 tacos with beer battered fried avocado, jicama slaw and pico de gallo in them. It was just so yummy! This wasn't like any dish I have tasted before and I will be ordering it again for sure. It also came with rice and beans. I'm pretty picky about rice at Mexican restaurants and really liked it here. The rice was moist and had great flavor as the beans. All this fresh tasty food for only $8 is a great deal. Hubby ordered the "Casero Burrito" priced at $13 and had some issues with the order accuracy of his food, but enjoyed it and really liked the tomatillo salsa that came on it. His food also came with a side of guacamole and since he is weird and doesn't like 'cados, I scooped it right up! That guac was definitely fresh made and freaking tasty! Our server was great and checked on us for refills regularly. 

Jalisco Cantina has a few different options as far as catering. They can host up to 100 people at the restaurant with live music and either a sit down dinner or buffet style dinner. They had other options too, but I can't remember them all so you can call for more info.

Currently they are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Middle Eastern food on the strip!  SLS players club offered $30 off of $60 during my birthday month so that made it a clear choice on a recent Monday night.  It was packed at 8:30pm with quite a few people waiting outside.  I'd suggest making a reservation.  Being the middle ground between casual eateries at the resort (Umami) and high end (Bazaar Meat) makes it easy to see why Cleo is so popular.

The menu offered a lot to ponder over, but my mind was already set on one thing....falafel!  It's not easy to find a good version of those deep fried balls of chickpea/fava bean heaven around these parts, but the ones they're serving up here are falawesome.  The light crunch of the exterior went into delicious, warm legume center that was well spiced.  My only regret was not ordering the side of hummus since the amount that arrived with the plate wasn't even enough for three balls let alone seven.  

A minor complaint was that while six of the balls were dark green on the inside, one was very pale green.  It didn't taste much different...still... can you imagine if Robert DeNiro's character from the film "Casino" saw this?  He would have ripped the chef a new one and then made sure he personally saw to every falafel that came out of the kitchen!  

"Kibbeh Nayyeh": chopped raw lamb accompanied with mint, bulgar and lebaneh, was my wife's favorite dish.  It was unlike any other tartare I'd ever had.  The creaminess of the lebaneh (Lebanese yogurt cheese) blended so well with the meat and the toasted parmesan crackers to spread it on.

I found the shawarma portion to be very small for $8 and would definitely pay more for a full lamb entre or just get kebabs instead.  The moussaka was below average and we didn't even bother finishing it before ordering the impressively rich and decadent sticky toffee dessert.  

There are plenty of other menu items worth checking out on a repeat visit like grilled octopus, flatbreads, and multiple mezzes.  I don't plan on being a stranger.

I ate here during "Restaurant Week" and am so glad I did! I enjoyed every bite of my meal and the service was fantastic. Hubby and I were seated at a roomy booth and our drinks were never empty. A basket of warm bread with butter came out quick and tasted great. The price for the RW menu was $50.14 per person and I enjoyed the following for that price before tax:

The Famous Original Spinning Bowl Salad - This is made right at your table. Our server, Ms. Huang had 2 metal bowls that spun as she added the dressing. The salad had lettuce, beets, hard boiled eggs, croutons and their signature vintage dressing. I haven't ever tasted a salad like this before. It was suggested that I add some of the Lawry's seasoning that was on the table, so I did. The salad tasted so fresh and delicious. Very good.

Mashed Potatoes - This was a nice addition to my plate. The mashed potatoes are whipped with butter and milk and tasted perfect. The brown gravy that came on it was good. 

Buttered Peas - Yum! Being on the same plate, the peas ended up with brown gravy and au jus on them which I like. Plus, I just like peas!

Yorkshire Pudding - This comes in a skillet by itself. It tasted great and was perfect for soaking up the last bits of gravy on my plate. it was soft and really good. 

Prime Rib - 8 ounces of pure heaven! A carver came to the table with a cart of prime rib and let me pick how I wanted it and then carved it right in front of me. I like mine a little more done and that's just what I got. The prime rib was so tender and literally fell apart. It had such great flavor. To say I didn't leave here stuffed would be absolutely wrong! Everything tasted good, but the prime rib was the true star.

Creme Brulee - This had fresh berries on top and It tasted so good, but I could only eat half because I was so full. 

Coffee - Tasted great and was a perfect way to end the meal. At this point I just needed a pillow for a nap!

I can't say enough about our server. She was fantastic and took great care of us. The manager on duty, Wendy came over and chit chatted with us for maybe 10 minutes and she was warm and friendly. She let us know a little about the lunch menu which sounds like a winner. This was a great RW experience and I will be back!

The chefs of today may well be the Van Goghs of our time. The care and precision of modern food presentation has made some of the creations on our plates incredible edible works of art.

The Japanese have the art of food presentation imbued in their food culture and they really put their heart and soul into making their food a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.

On my visit to Las Vegas last September, I was starting to feel a bit jaded about eating at the big corporate named restaurants on the strip and sought out a dinner spot more in keeping with being a locals' favourite. A Yelp search threw up Raku and a quick check with local Yelp friend Emily R confirmed that it was one of her favourite spots in town.

I was especially drawn to their kaiseki menu, where they create a unique menu based on the best ingredients available that day. A quick phone call secured  my dinner reservation and as requested on their website, I pre-ordered the kaiseki menu.

My taxi dropped outside Raku, which is located in a non-descipt small off-Strip mall. Any initial fears about the unprepossessing surroundings were soon dispelled by the warm welcome I received on entering the restaurant. There was a general hubbub of conviviality in the restaurant all evening with many customers obviously being happy regulars.

I bagged a seat at my favourite place to sit in a restaurant - at the counter watching the chefs at work. I was able to chat to the main chef all evening, who was very happy to engage and explain things to me about my unfolding gastronomic adventure.

Every dish was a work of art and there were quite a few new flavours for my palate to savour.

1. Mountain potato croquettes in dashi broth

2. Eight mini treasures, including creations such as tofu skin with wasabi and egg with sashimi

3. The house signature homemade silken tofu with salmon roe and homemade green tea salt and soya sauce

4. Fluke sashimi and liver with spring radish and grated onion dipped in ponzu sauce

5. Japanese/Spanish mackarel marinated in yuzu

6. Foie gras/egg custard/summer truffle served in an egg shell

7. Eel with shisho pepper

8. Uni with egg

9. Kobe beef on hot rock flamed with Hennessy XO sauce

10. Mixed tuna over rice

11. Panna cota

As you can see, the list of ingredients is like a who's who of the best ingredients to pass one's lips. Everything was a delight to eat.

 I love the way that Japanese cookery has given exquisite food presentation to the west but in return, the has given them ingredients like foie gras to cook with.

Service was always with a smile all evening.

The final touch of class came at the end of my meal when the chef confessed that normally, they don't do the kaiseki menu for only one person due to the large amount of prep time involved but as I was visiting from London, they made an exception.

Arigato, Aburiya Raku!

Of all the Roberto's locations around Vegas this 'berto's location is one of the more consistent. It's located between Home Depot and Capriotti's. I have been coming here on my lunch break and more recently yesterday after a trip to Home Depot. The inside is clean and the guy at the register who has taken my order each time is friendly and actually goes over your order with you to make sure it's right if you customized anything. Like the other locations in town, you can get your chicken taco fix for only 99 cents on Wednesdays with a limit of 12 per person at that price.

The "Adobada Taco" at a cost of $2.75 each was good. It had marinated pork, guacamole and fresh salsa on it. There was meat falling out of the taco because they weren't stingy with the fillings. One thing I love here is the "Rolled Tacos" that come in different options. You can choose chicken, beef, sour ream, guacamole or just cheese. I don't like their guacamole that much, so I just got the rolled tacos (beef) with cheese. The rolled tacos with cheese cost $2.35 and are easily a meal by itself for me! So darn cheap and it tastes good. I love the "Carne Asada Fries" here, but only get them when I have someone to share with because it's such a huge portion. The asada fries cost $8.10 which is a great price for the size of it. We are talking fries, beans, sour cream, salsa, cheese and a pile of carne asada. It does come with guacamole, but I asked that it be left off. The menu here has many options for everyone. 

Inside there are plenty of tables and a small salsa and veggie bar. It has been filled with customers when I have been here, so I am going to start calling my lunch order in to avoid the wait time. If you are on a time crunch and it's Wednesday, calling in your order is smart as well because more people are there that day loading up on the 99 cent chicken tacos.

An incredible steakhouse.   Outstanding food.  Solid wine list.  Excellent service.  Stellar value.

(Sorry this review is long, there is a lot to share).

It's in Luxor.  Stop laughing.  Once you get past the lobby (hey, you can't hide the fact you're in a giant pyramid), renovations have made the casino as contemporary as any.  

Five years and 120+ visits;  Tender continues to impress.  Innovation keeps the menu exciting.  Rapidly changing seasonal specials showoff the chef's commitment to freshness.  

For summer, the heirloom tomato salad with over a dozen varieties of fresh, vine ripened tomatoes dressed in olive oil and sea salt with micro basil and slices of uber fresh, milky mozzarella just incredible.  A full blown tomato party in your mouth.  The salad is large enough for two.

For bison month, a charred bison carpaccio topped with a spicy aioli, arugula salad with roasted peppers and sweet corn finished with a touch of sea salt.  Incredible!

Other killer starters, the charcuterie of game and deli meats (bresaola, finochietta, wild boar sausage, pork coppa, lamb prosciutto and antelope pastrami) with cornisons, assortment of olives and mustard, an excellent take on the classic.  The chilled salmon tasting, a true standout; hot apple wood smoked salmon topped with black truffle "caviar" on a bed of pesto, edamame, and sea asparagus.  Wow!  An explosion of flavors, oily salmon, earthy truffle, herbaceous basil, the back taste of the pine nuts, the crunch and oceanic flavor of the sea asparagus.  Perfect.

Outstanding steaks at all quality and price ranges.  The Bison ribeye is very hard to pass.  Deep meaty flavor, low fat.  JAPANESE KOBE A5 WAGYU.  The real deal.  $95 / 8oz.  I doubted it, I saw it, I tried it.  Yes, yes, yes.  Extremely well trimmed.  Request it cooked below rare.  It's an ethereal experience, seared goodness on the outside, chilled, tender with melting fat on the inside.

Something different?  Wild game platter remains excellent.  Berkshire kurabuta pork chop (order this medium) near perfect heritage pork flavor.  Sweet, tender, and porky!  Finally the bison osso buco; tender perfectly braised, deeply flavored bison on a bed of enriched mashed potato and tangy bbq onions.  Incredible balance.  The marrow is a special treat.

Tip:  check out the sides.  Roasted bone marrow glazed with a veal demi an insane value at $5, Hudson foie for $10.  Add it to any steak or have it alone with some bread as a starter.

Sure, missteps do happen but are always corrected with no fuss.

For the absolute best service on a casual night out, eat at the bar.  Friendly, very knowledgeable bar staff who aim to please.  The music in the lounge a little loud, but it keeps the energy up.

Great wine program with the lowest markup on the Strip.  Huge by the glass pours.  Wines by the bottle near retail.  Check out the Captains' List for clearance wines below retail.

Snub the Luxor all you want, you will be missing a great restaurant.

Maggiano's can sometimes feel like an endless party. 

I remember working in the Sears Tower when we first heard that Chili's (Brinker Intl') had bought the rights to the concept. In short, we were all bummed and felt they would goof it up. 

Well so much for our misgiving's, they sold off Macaroni Grill and made a decent attempt at allowing a little bit of Chicago's Italian scene to come alive for the rest of the country. 

Now don't get me wrong, this restaurant isn't perfect, as they were this past Friday evening. Yes, the Hostess station still seems confused as Laura M noted in her review last year. But where can you get a good meal for two, including appetizers, drinks and dessert, along with two especially prepared take home entrees for $55?  Really!

So we started with a glass of Merlot ($8.00), Soup ($3.95)and a Sausage appetizer ($8.50 which was a meal in itself, see photos).  For out entrees, we had their Classic Pasta for $12.95 and Mama's Lasagna $14.95.  Both were very good, though the entrees came first and our server's boss was indifferent at best while being distracted with a larger party.  Our server Hannah was outstanding, but so much for our easy going, pre-Christmas romantic meal.

For dessert, we shared two of their petite samplers for $3.50 each and coffee.  Their Apple Cobbler and dark chocolate Truffle balls were delicious and worth the trip.  We highly recommend them.  The regular sized dessert are good, but way over the top in size.

The bill came to $66.16, less a $10.00 off coupon from their email list.  So if we stopped here, it would be a fair $55.37 and not a bad deal, right?  But Maggiano's was still offering their buy two, take two home special. Nice! So we had enough for a second dinner sometime this week.  All and all, a delicious option. 

Enjoy!

While in the area, hubby and I decided to stop here for lunch. They have a drive-thru and chairs/tables outside. Their location on Decatur has only a drive-thru and walk-up window (seating outside), but at this location you can walk inside to order and they also have a dining area. I noticed a $14 for $20 yelp deal upon checking in, so I purchased it. The guy who took my order was very nice, but had some issues figuring out the yelp deal. He called the manager and it all got straightened out. 

The portions here are big, so hubby and I shared. We started out with "Fried Mozzarella" priced at $8.69 for the large and side if sauce. These weren't bad at all, but not the best I've tasted either, above average. I've had the "Garlic Romano Fries" from the Decatur location and loved them, so at $4.59 I ordered them with a side a Sammy's Sauce. The fries here were consistent with the ones I had previously, so they tasted great! Next I enjoyed my half of "The L.A. Pastrami" priced at $10.79 for the large. The pastrami was very tender and had good flavor. It also has mustard, pickles and cheese on it. This sandwich even comes in a extra large size! Even their small sizes are fair, so if you get a medium size or larger, it's very possible you could share with someone depending on your appetite. This place is definitely worth giving a try!

My first Arepas and is was Viva Las Vegas good!

I had to try this place after reading Craig R's review.  I've never had an Arepas before so I was looking forward to trying it.  This place is a stand alone shack on the corner at the end of the north side of the strip.  Seriously its a shack, you cant miss it cuz it sticks out!!!  They have some tables set outside so there are places to for you to eat there.  Saw a few that just swung by and got it to go.   

An Arepa is a flat, round and soft patty made out of cornmeal, which is grilled, making it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and then it can be stuffed with beef, chicken, ham, cheese, beans, shrimp, and many more. These delights are gluten-free, and wheat-free.  Aside from arepas (hot/cold) they also serve empanadas and hallacas which are like tamales.

SInce I was having a really late dinner I decided to try 2 and got a #5 and #7 with a mango drink to wash is down.  I sat down and waited about 10 min and the guy brought it out. 

#5 Roasted Pork Butt  (Pernil) which is Slow Cooked Marinated Pork, Fresh Tomato Slices and cheese.  Damn this was tasty good.  Great flavored pork, tender and juicy.  The cornmeal was grilled perfectly with a crisp!

#7 Reina Pepiada which is Shredded Chicken Breast, Avocado,  Mayonnaise, Cilantro, Green Peas.  Was like a chicken salad as this was a cold version.  They look small but they are actually pretty big and was only able to eat half of this one as I was totally full. 

The guy told me about the 2 homemade sauces they have on the table.  One is green and a milder version but with a really good flavor.  I would buy some of this good stuff.  The red was obviously spicy and so I didn't really use it but it was good.  

This place may look questionable but let me tell you this is a great hole in the wall place to hit up when your in LV.  It's way off the strip so you wont have to deal with lines and strip prices.  They have great tasty food 

Eyes ~ Ok its on the corner and the seats are pretty much on the sidewalk.
Nose ~ Not much to smell when your outside and the wind whipping!
Ear ~ Cars cars cars!
Mouth ~ Damn tasty arepas!
Tummy ~ Stop stuffing more food mouth, I'm freaking full yo!

Honey Salt is the newest restaurant to open in Summerlin, tucked away in the corner suite that was once occupied by Nora's Wine Bar at the NW corner of Rampart and Charleston.  Offering a menu inspired by comfort food with farm to table ingredients, as well as a seasonal cocktail menu, I can easily see this restaurant becoming a locals favorite.

There are three menus that are available depending on the time of day you dine in.  Lunch is served from 11:30am - 3:00pm (http://honeysalt.com/menus/lunch-menu/), dinner is served from 5:00pm till closing (http://honeysalt.com/menus/dinner-menu/), and there is an "in-between" menu served between lunch and dinner that seems to be a scaled back offering of the lunch options.  I stopped in during lunch and dined at the bar, where I started with a Midnight Rambler: a specialty cocktail made with bourbon, bitters, honey and orange peel.  The honey added just the right amount of sweetness to balance out the drink without overpowering the bourbon; my kind of drink!

For lunch I had their Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich: creamy slaw, durkees dressing, brioche roll, served with a chopped salad (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/honey-salt-las-vegas?select=lQ4mQi9Nm-ycsd6-r2kDIQ#lQ4mQi9Nm-ycsd6-r2kDIQ).  This is a very, very good chicken sandwich.  There are two pieces of chicken that are lightly breaded and very juicy, which gets complimented by pickled and mustard flavors from the other ingredients.  It's one of those dishes that is so good that I'll have to convince myself to order something else the next time I visit...

A big surprise was the salad that is served with this sandwich.  Don't let the "chopped salad" description fool you, it's a salad served with cubed cheddar, edamame, carrots, radishes, avocado and I think kale.  Very good salad that came together well texturally; I would order this on its own if I wanted a lighter meal.

Overall Honey Salt screams quality.  I'm pretty darn sure this review will get bumped to 5-stars after I try some more things on the menu.  Will they be successful?  Time will tell.  Or you could listen to me and eat there now, before word spreads and you're no longer able to walk in without having to wait for a table.

Bacchanal Buffet, the highly touted buffet in Las Vegas I coveted. Family and friends have indulged. It was my turn =)

No wait time! Wednesday at 6pm. YES!!

I was seated immediately and my drink order placed. It was time to indulge. 

I scoped out each station, taking mental notes of what looked good. 
I decided on the seafood station for my first plate. 
My second plate was from the carving station (BBQ & Prime Rib this evening)
My third plate was from the cheese & cured meat station. 
Last but not the least, Dessert. 

My food rating of each dish:
GREAT DISHES
*Lamb Chops - tender, perfectly cooked medium rare, yum!! Get the mint jelly too. 
*Shrimp Cocktail - Big pieces of shrimp. Not over cooked like most shrimp cocktails, perfect. 
*Goat cheese with fig - wow, wow, WOW!
*Mushroom & Truffle Soup - this was decadent, creamy with that earthy richness, Yum!!

GOOD DISHES
*Oyster Shooter - the oyster was just okay, but the liquid it came in was delicious. Cucumber juice?
*Brisket - I asked for the fatty part, yum!  Melds in you mouth goodness. I didn't see any BBQ sauce though. 
*Polenta - the only thing I got from the Italian station. 
*Wagyu Slider - delicious. It would have been better with mayo. (Which I found after I ate it)
*Mango Pudding - the coconut jelly made this dish good!!
*Coconut Calamansi Dacqoise - I don't know what a "Dacqoise" is, but it was like a macaron to me. Lol. 
*Beignet - great with coffee, just too sweet. 

OKAY DISHES
*Raw Oyster - it would have been better if it was sucked better. The oyster was still attached to the shell and a lot of shell bits in the oyster itself. 
*Prime Rib - the medium rare parts were good, other parts were very chewy. 
*Creme Brle - not too sweet, yum. 
*Goat cheese with basil - good flavor!!

BAD DISHES
*BBQ Pork Spare Ribs - too salty & not tender. 
*Jonah Crab Claws - even though they were pre cracked, it was still hard to eat. The crab meat was stuck to the shell. Over cooked. 
*Mint Gelato - first gelato I asked for was pistachio, I got "Mint" instead. Since I ask for 3 other flavors, by the time I got to my table, the mint had started to melt and ruined the other 3. Oh, I don't like mint ice cream / gelato. 

Info: The plates are HOT. Super hot. Be careful. If you want cold plates, get them from the salad station. 

Service was good. 

Suggestions: it was hard to get some of the dishes. For example the soups. The clearance between the pot and the shelves on top of it was too low. It was hard not to spill the soup because the ladle was hitting the shelving. 

The flow of some of the food station was also a bit off for me.

I didn't get anything from the Chinese & Mexican stations, I was too full. Lol. 

The food here was good, I definitely indulged, okay, over indulged. Lol. 

Solid 4 Stars. 
Try it for yourself and decide.

I read about this new attraction in the Las Vegas Sun and decided to make a trip down to Fremont Street to give it a try.  Since my Son was off of school today, I brought him along.  The attraction is located on the far East side of Fremont Street, which is closest to Las Vegas Blvd.  The best place to park is the parking garage on the corner of Fremont Street & Las Vegas Blvd.  It's pretty cheap for parking....we were there for 2 hours and paid $3.

I posted a video on YouTube if you want to see the experience:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxzOl3TXeJs

The ticket office for this attraction is on the Fremont Street level next to the Walgreens.  Tickets are $15 each for 1 ride, $25 for 2 rides, $30 for 3 rides....that's per person.  In other words, 3 people riding once will pay $45 total.....capiche?  Cool....

Since we didn't know if we'd enjoy it, we paid $15 each for the single ride.  We should have paid $30 each for the 3 pack.....because we ended up riding a 2nd time.  The girl was cool and only charged us $10 each for the 2nd ride as if we paid for the 2 pack....not sure she'll hook you up like that though, so don't expect that.  (see pics for full price list and all day discount pricing)

The launch pad is I think 60 ft in the air and you access it by going to the 5th floor (roof) of the parking garage, which is the same building the ticket office is located.  We made our way up there and waited in line.  Everyone in line was pretty nervous, including myself.  I'm not a fan of heights, but wanted to give this a try.  My Son was pretty brave....he wasn't nervous at all....until we got up to the edge of the platform.

You get strapped into a harness and get some instruction.  Here are some tips:

- Don't wear flip flops or sandals with no ankle straps....if you do, they'll make you take them off and put them in a netted bag.

- Purses or bags without secure straps will not be allowed on the ride.

- Don't wear anything with loose pockets or if you do, don't put anything in them because it could fly out easily.

- Don't wear loose sunglasses.  They could fly of easily with the airflow generated during the ride.

- They don't allow pictures to be taken during the ride, for obvious reasons...ie your camera could slip out of your hands and seriously injure someone on the ground.

It sounds like a lot of rules, but it's common sense.  Knowing this in advance will save you a trip back to your car or hotel room.

The zipline can handle groups up to 4 people at one time.  A quick hint if you want to get on/off the ride fast.....ride as a single.  They're always looking for a single to fill up a group of three, which happened often while we were there.

We were nervous on the final walk up the stairs to the launch pad....when you get up there the instructor will attach you to a cable until you're secured on the zipline.  Each person will be hooked up to the zipline and given instructions on what to do.  I admit, I was nervous all the way up until the launch of our 1st ride.  It looks much higher from the launch pad than from the ground.

After everyone is given instructions, he releases the safety clip and you lift up your legs and your body weight launches you down the zipline.  If you want to go really fast, tuck your knees up to your chest like a cannon ball dive in a pool.....you'll pick up speed right away.  If you stay in this position, you'll maximize your speed all the way through the ride.....this was a tip given to us by the instructor.

The ride itself is very fun.....you feel like you're flying above everyone, because you are.  It was very exhilarating and I felt free.  The landing is the roughest part.....you slam into a padded stopping mechanism and your momentum swings you up quickly while an employee secures your line with a rope.  I was amazed at how fast we came in on the landing.....the 2nd time around I nailed the employee in the shoulder with my knee....I'm surprised he didn't go down.  He said it happens all day long.....I wouldn't want his job.

After your ride, you get your picture taken and you have the option to purchase pictures of your ride.....prices are $10 each for the 1st 2 pics, then $5 a pic after that.  I paid for 4 pics since we couldn't take any on the ride itself.....nice to have as a souvenir for the 1st time, won't pay for it again though.  I didn't post those pics because I don't have a scanner.  The pics I posted of people on the zipline were other riders.  The pics from the launch pad was from my perspective....I put the camera away just before launch.

Overall, it was an exhilarating ride and we had a blast.

Will we return?  There's no doubt about it.....I'm taking all of my friends who visit from out of town to ride.

I stopped in to pick up some dinner to-go. After walking in, hubby and I were very confused since they have no signs saying to seat yourself or anything pointing you to a place for to-go orders. The most confusing part was no employees in sight and no menu board?!?! There wasn't anybody else eating inside either, so I had to wonder if this place was really open for business or not. After a couple minutes a woman came out and asked asked if were were eating in or taking out, so I told her we wanted to place a order to-go. She handed us menus and we sat and looked it over. After only a minute she came back to take our order, but I told her we we hadn't been here before and needed a little extra time to look over the menu. She then comes back I swear less than a minute later and asked if we were ready. Ugh. I felt rushed which made no sense since there were no other customers. I just went ahead and ordered some things that caught my eye.

Bean and Cheese Pupusas ($1.95) - The price was great, but not the taste. I wish I tasted more beans and cheese inside instead of the pasty corn flavor this one had. 

Al Pastor Taco ($1.95) - I enjoyed the taco and they were generous with the fillings, but it tasted more like chicken and certainly doesn't stand up against some of the other al pastor around town. 

Fried Plantains ($2.50) - Yum! This was the best part! I really enjoyed the nice sweet flavor.

The lady who helped us was friendly, but pushy about getting our order taken. I really feel they need to put a menu board up and some signage showing customers if they should seat themselves etc. Price was on point and the plantains were good, but everything else was a miss for me.

You have got to be kidding me!!!

What narcissistic nincompoop came up with this idea?

This has just topped my list of "Most Asinine Restaurants in all of Las Vegas." and my list of "Stay the hell away - far away!" at the same time.

3 people, no drinks, one order of tacos each (4) and a very small Queso Fundito appetizer for $75 - THAT'S SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS FOR A DOZEN STREET TACOS AND BLAND CHEESE!

First off, the restaurant is so cold I was shivering - AND I'M FROM FARGO 'FRICKING' NORTH DAKOTA.

The the Queso Fundito came to the table luke warm, which meant the cheese was already almost solid. We got the one with mushrooms, and they didn't taste bad, but cold Queso Fundito just sucks, period. It came with a spoon, which is absolutely the worst utensil to use when trying to cut semi-hard cheese.

Question: does anyone besides me remember when you could order your entire meal at the beginning and the kitchen would have enough sense to send out the appetizer first and give you some time before sending out the rest? Boy I miss those days. 

We ordered our appetizer, but weren't ready to order the tacos. The waitress kept coming by (without our appetizer) to ask if we were ready, so we politely ordered, hoping enough time had passed that our appetizer could arrive and we could have a few minutes to enjoy it before our small table was overrun by plates.

Boy were we wrong. Not more than 1 minute after the Fundito arrived, I got my tacos - just mine, apparently no one thinks people like to eat together anymore. So now my tacos are getting cold while I try to finish the Fundito before it turns back into a hard brick of cheese. 

The other orders came 5 to 6 minutes apart. These people are completely incompetent.

I will not say the food was bad, but I will say that Pepe's Tacos offers MUCH better tacos at 1/3 the price. 

This place is PURE SHIT, an absolute waste of a great location and an awesome remodeling by Red Rock. I can already see by the other Yelp reviews that most people agree. 

Pay $75 to have some tourist on the Las Vegas Strip slap you three times in the face, it will be a much better use of your money.

Had the most Mind blowing Experinece here!

This place rocks!  Seriously they have hundreds of gems, fossils, rocks etc etc. I wish they were closer to get to.

So my friend Dawn R. who flew in from Portland for the Yelp Spring Break had been looking for 6 gems for a Feng Shui thing in the living room.  Everything on the internet was just a online store and not a business that you could walk into.  When it comes to gems and minerals you want to hold and see.  Think about a diamond for example.  Wouldn't you rather see it and touch in person before buying!   Well the Yelp Ap came to the rescue again.  

This place is on the outskirts of downtown and easy to get to.  I wasn't sure want to expect since there was less than 10 reviews but WHOA when we walked in it was like DAYUM.  They have A LOT of stuff.  They have the place organized by the minerals, gems and fossils in the front.  When you go to the back you can find even more minerals, gems in all type of sizes and shapes and even a sections of beads.  Another smaller room where they have Buddhist statues.  I was totally impressed with the amount of items this place carries.

I personally was not looking for anything in particular.  I was looking at some pendulum and I tried out a few.  There was one answering me even when I was not holding it so I getting it.   I also purchased a Moldavite http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavite.  Something I had never heard of until that day.  I was curious to know more about it and Miguel was the one who took the time to explain what it was and how people use it.  Being that I had by Reiki 1 & 2 done and he was a Reiki Master and had also done theta healing I knew exactly what he was talking about in terms of energy work.  I could totally feel the warmth from this one gem from holding it in my hand.  I felt like what one may feel when having a hot flash.  It was pretty odd how this little gem was giving off that much energy.  There are only 3-4 mines and it is estimated that it will all be gone in the less than 10 years so I thought I should get one.   So I picked a pendant http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jMrpr92nMEhe4cC4FF00VQ?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#hddvoHue4g2iC-Tv6KuvRA and a chain I like and put it on.  The pendant sat right between my heart and throat chakra and I could immediately feel the warmth in my chest area.   

Now this is when things got interesting.  As we were checking out, Miguel had left to the back room to grab a bag for my pendulum.  When he returned he told me to put out both hand and close my eye.  Hmmm that is a strange request but I obliged.  He then put a good size spirit quartz in both hands and told me to hold on an feel.  I seriously never ever ever felt so much energy and vibration coming from gem before.  It was so intense my hands were shaking.  It shot up through my arms and straight to my chest and was pounding right were the Moldavite pendulum lay.  I was totally speechless and all that came out of my mouth was Oh Shit, Oh my goodness, Oh Damn Oh my god etc etc.   A minute or so into it Miguel proceeds to share with me a message from my spirit guide to not be so hard on myself and to take things slowly and to take my time.  With the massive energy and vibration going through me and what I was hearing I teared up big time.  This was so unexpected and a great surprise.  It was one of the most amazing experience I had in a store!!!  Now this is not to be expected with every person that comes in but I was totally opened to it and was ready for it and so I welcomed it.  Freaking amazing.   I was feeling that energy pretty much all day, it was freaking great!!!! 

Anywho, if your' looking to buy a few pieces for feng shuei or maybe even by a Moldavite and you happen to be visiting sin city you have got to stop by this place.  It's a gem of a place!

Locale ~ Downtown 
Offerings ~ Gems, Minerals, Jewelry, Statues
Extras ~ Ask for Miguel,  He is very knowledgeable and helpful!

When Jared asked me what I wanted to do for my birthday, my reply was "dinner at Modern Steak."  So, that's exactly what we did... and I couldn't have asked for anything more!

We walked in and were immediately impressed with the extremely glamorous atmosphere.  Like, over the top, swanky, cool, but not quite overdone - almost like Vegas decor.  Ruthie was our server and she was fabulous!  I knew exactly what I wanted when I walked in... Jared took awhile longer.  But Ruthie was patient and sweet.  

I started with a dirty martini.  Jared ordered a glass of Cabernet a little while later.  We ended up ordering a bunch of stuff and sharing.  Yes, I was the birthday girl, but I did manage to snag a copy of our receipt.  This is what it looked like:

-Meris King Crab App - $24
-Asparagus - $9
-Rst Mushrooms - $10
-Ketel One Martini $13
-Chopped Salad - $9
-Chilean Sea Bass - $$35
-G_Manifesto (J's glass of wine) - $12
-12 ox Meyers NY Strip - $30
----------------------------------------
Total before tip - $152.21

I loved loved loved the chopped salad... lots of chopped up veggies and the perfect amount of Champagne vinaigrette.  And the beautiful thing about sharing at Modern Steak is that they split everything in the kitchen... and the portion sizes were still quite generous.  The king crab app is served warm and is melt in your mouth delicious but it literally comes in a jar full of a butter sauce so be forewarned.  The mushroom and asparagus sides were amazing also.  I honestly enjoyed every bite! In addition to what is listed on the bill, we enjoyed fresh baked potato and parmesan herb bread... delicious!  And the sea bass was fantastic and the steak was perfectly done per our request.  We skipped desert but ended up having another drink in the bar with friends.

What a perfect way to celebrate my birthday!

This will for sure be a go-to place for special occasions in the future.  

Oh, and if you go, make sure to pay a visit to the rest room - it's adorable!  Lastly, a hidden Yelp tip, courtesy of my dude: "if you buy $100 worth of FRC gift cards, you'll receive $120 worth in return. That is a pretty good immediate return on your money; much better than my stock portfolio... enjoy!"

This ain't no Hometown Buffet, yo!

FYI, I am NOT a fan of buffets! When my brother wanted to spend his birthday here out of ALL the other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I wanted to say, "What?!?! Are you serious?!?! What the heck is wrong with you?!?! Do we really need 3000 calories in one meal???"

But hey, he was paying for our dinner at $36.95/person so I just kept my mouth shut. I'm sure my bratty face showed how I was feeling anyway. While dining here, I realized that the food was much better than most buffets. Actually, it's the best buffet I've been to so far.

Excellent dishes:
Thai Beef Salad
Crab legs
Smoked Salmon
Chicken with some kind of mango salsa
Pepperoni Pizza
And so many more but I can't remember cuz I was in a food coma.

Not so great dishes:
All the sushi rolls - rice was old, dry, tough. Sushi is never good at a buffet. I know this but I was curious, I just wanted to try it.
And some other things but I can't remember cuz I was in a food coma.

Then there's the dessert area....EEEEEEEEEEEEKKK!  It was HEAVEN!!! A crepe station, gelato, cookies, carrot cake, cheescakes, cupcakes, mousse, chocolate-dipped marshmallows, etc. The creme brulee was my favorite! I think I tried almost ALL of them. YAY for sugar!!! I had about 10 desserts on the table in front of me. WOOO!

Service was excellent! I wish I remembered the name of the guy who helped us with drinks and other things cuz he was really patient with the 18 of us. We needed more utensils, napkins, drinks and we changed the seating for the kids, our requests seemed endless but we didn't have to wait long to get them. When my family realized he was Filipino, they were all over him and kept asking him questions: "Where do you live?" "Where's your family?" "How long have you been here?" "Can you take our picture?" "Can you take one more?" "Okay, one more picture?" I felt sorry for the guy but it didn't look like it bothered him at all. He never stopped working or smiling while he was answering a billion questions...and thank you for taking 50 pics of us!

I had so much fun trying so many different things! I'm glad my brother celebrated his birthday here. For a buffet, this is really good!

Wicked Spoon was at the top of my list of places to go in vegas and i actually got a little depressed at the end of the meal when i didn't feel that 5 star feeling... I had been drooling over the pics posted by friends weeks in advance and I found myself enjoying it, but 5 days later, i can't really think of too many dishes i would go back for... 
But no surprise to SY, i would still give this place 4 stars. Mainly because compared to most of the other Vegas Buffets, they do have a cool concept of serving most dishes tapas style,a large selection and you can't beat the price. $29.00 for dinner is a great deal!!!
Things i liked: cute sweet potato fries basket: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=iPghhy9N4azg0lP_S5HrkA
Salad (yes salad): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=hdhBFzkgK6B6235Cd9EpDA
That they have a mac and cheese bar: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=M2_4E_aQ9CKhPjH1w-2--Q
and surprisingly the brussel sprouts were deelicious. 
Loved eating out of the little pans : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=Ym-lY0eK698v546Q_AzDTg
Crunchy tacos were good.

Sad they didn't have the raved about pork belly bun and XLB. They only had 3 types of sushi and they were all generic rolls. Crab legs were small crab claws. I had Bone Marrow for the first time- thumbs up. 
The desserts looked beautiful and were plenty : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=xDoLAU2S10POWue58tlXBw
and i grabbed a whole plateful :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=zxZDmDpWsDs2rcaWQa0ZEw
But the only thing i really liked was this lemony jelly dessert thing that was served inside of an eggshell topped with a baby macaron (mac was not great tho). Gelato was yum. Chocolate covered strawberries are always nice. 
I did enjoy the desserts here more than Wynn Buffet. But i remember liking the Bellagio desserts the best (but that was years ago)

A little disappointing overall, but service was friendly (our waitress took the time to take pics for us and make conversation about our trip), everything was beautiful and how much fun was it to take some pics in the shoes and by the dog statues around the way.!

I had read some great Yelp reviews about this place and anything Keller has got to be good. So I figured when in Rome....

Or is it when at the Venetian do as the French do?  Very confusing. So as I swaggered out of the hotel in the morning to my trade show at the convention center I made a 6:30 dinner reservation for later that night. Oh man it smelled good, I almost stayed for breakfast.

After a long day at the convention center, it came time for dinner and man I couldn't wait to dive into Bouchon and do a French belly flop!  

I was immediately seated and my first (of many) waiters came to get me started off. I'm not much of a wino so I asked about the beer selection they had to offer and settled on a dark pumpkin spice number.

The 2nd was  bringing some bread shells and pistachio's  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouchon-las-vegas?select=w-8xsdNVt1DXAJhXaGNLsw#gQ8-2YOTknwRmAxwp1fVEw   as the 3rd waiter was showing me the menu. A newsprint deal that wrapped around the cutlery and napkin.  Crap! I told the waiter I don't have my glasses and can hardly see. The restaurant was dim and oozed romance too bad I was alone and blind. But waiter #3 to the rescue! He had a mini LED flashlight and I was able to read the menu and find some choices for my dinner!

STARTERS: 
French onion soup ... What else? I love FR Onion soup and Bouchon's soup is no slouch. It kicked ass! One of the best I've ever eaten. 4.5*****Stars http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=yXvxjUxdZxTXkv4b1pp6HA&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw
I finished every drop!
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_ncmx4f7Cpjk-12I0buXgQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

SALAD: ... Salade Marachre au Chvre Chaud
I can't even pronounce half of that, but it was a great fru fru salad with a tasty hunk of goat cheese and a delish red wine dressing, I ate every leaf of that bad boy. 4.****Stars
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=iK0praadEO0s1HXWN_P5iA&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

ENTREE: ... I ordered the Steak Frites. OMG that steak was heavenly! Melt in my mouth tender, juicy and  topped with caramelized shallots & matre d'htel butter (light garlic butter and caramelized onion medley). One of the best steaks I've ever eaten. The mountain of shoe string fries never got limp or soggy and were a perfect match for my steak. 5****Stars
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lilGGLerloMXwscZ4D2TCg&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

DESERT: ... I managed to strike up a conversation with the guy to my left, who it turns out was the Keller resturants IT guy who was visiting for work, he suggested the Poire Belle Hlne for my dessert. OK I'm game I said. The poached pear and hazelnut ice cream with a chocolate sauce was spot on. Too bad my camera died, but my tongue was working overtime on this insider tip. 5*****Stars

The restaurant is impeccable and the service here is top notch!  I had a great experience here and can't wait to come back again.

Cue Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue", because the curtain just went up yesterday on a new Five Star food experience!

For most Chicago food lovers, Portillo's holds a special place.  Yes, there are several hundred Italian Beef and Char Dog places up there.  But it was Dick Portillo and his family who first capitalized on turning Chicago comfort food into a culinary science.  Then they made it into a destination stop with all of the visual entertainment of their theme restaurants.  Very simply, the food was very good and it was a fun place to go.

This Portillo's is no different.  Here they have a 50s/60s Retro Theme.  As I waited in line last night, it was more like a carnival atmosphere.  Of the nearly four hundred ahead of me, there was ne're a raised voice or a sad face. Everyone was laughing and telling stories.  

As you entered the restaurant after forty-five minutes to an hour outside, and then realizing you had another forty-five minute wait inside -- you looked around and saw nothing but a sea of happy, satisfied customers chowing down on their favorite food.

I was ordering for three, since I had two hungry somebodies waiting at home for my food delivery service.  For myself, I ordered the Big Italian Beef wet ($5.95) with sweet and hot peppers giardinera ($0.90) and Mozzarella ($0.50) and a Jumbo Hot dog ($2.99) with everything on it.  Boy, did if goof.  The prices for the food are outrageously fair and reasonable.  Heck, I left thinking they got my order wrong with all the food they gave me. 

Their beef sandwich was nearly a foot long and I needed to cut it in half.  There was no way any human being could finish something this big and I didn't.  The amount of beef on half, was more than double what I have had in the past at any other restaurant! They could have easily sold my half sandwich for the $5.95 that I paid.  My jumbo dog was also very good, but I should have ordered it charred instead.  It was worth the wait, everything was delicious.

The other items on my family's order, were two Beef 'n Cheddar croissants for $5.25 each, another Jumbo Dog with an order of large Fries ($2.19) and onion rings ($2.09), along with four hot giardiners ($0.45) and one pop.  Our total came to $35.95, including taxes and could have easily fed four.  As I said, I goofed and over ordered by a mile!

Other items on the menu that we didn't try are: the 1/3 of pound Char Burgers for $3.95, or the double for $6.19. They also have a Halibut  or Tuna sandwich $5.19, and a Veggie Sandwich for $5.35. Portillo's is famous for their Garbage Salad which is $7.69.  They also have a Chicken Caesar for $6.59.  Their Shakes are $2.69/ $3.39 and Malts $2.79/ $3.59. For something completely different, they also have Tamales $1.89 and a Tamale in a Box for $2.99.

In Yelp-ese, a Four Star experience is "Yay! I'm a fan."  A Five Star is "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"  Before tonight, I would have said Portillo's was a Four Stars. But NOT after this evening.  To even the toughest critic or curmudgeon, they would have to admiit that this is as good as it gets!  Five Stars.

Enjoy!

Tucked away in the strip mall, this small Cuban bakery has been overlooked and undervalued by many who don't frequent the area or knows very little about the cuisine. Once inside, there are only six small tables. The red tablecloths, glass dessert counter, tiled floors, and bright natural lighting coming through the doors nicely accentuated the dcor. Fellow Yelper Kurdy S and I were the only non-Spanish speaking customers during this afternoon. Like many of the nearby restaurants, the atmosphere was fitting as a casual lunch spot.

For appetizer, we shared the Tostones Rellenos de Roja Villeja ($4.49). The plate came with four fried green plantains holding a small scoop of tender shredded beef on top. The plantains had great texture on the outside to add to the soft green banana flavor on the inside. The beef was tender, flavorful, complex, and very nicely seasoned. I can eat these all day long.

We also had a side order of Plantanos Maduro Fritos ($2.49) that came with soft bananas served piping hot, perfectly fried, and sweet. It was nicely glazed, but also unexpectedly oily. 

Next, the Cuban Sandwich ($6.95) came with shredded beef, ham, and mustard. The bread had an awesome crunch with an excellent secondary chew. The sandwich was big enough to share and the dish also came with French fries. The way they kept it simple without all the fillers made this one of the best Cuban Sandwiches I've had so far.

Finally, the Filete a la Plancha ($9.99) came with a big serving of grilled sole, black bean rice, and salad. The sole was fresh, moist, tender, and had good flavor but slightly over salted. The black bean rice had great flavor and moisture--much better than the one at Victor's 1959 Caf. The lightly dressed salad provided a nice change of pace to the sole.

Antithetical to the cuisine's longstanding stereotype of being bland, this place simply rocks. Service however, was friendly but also inattentive, offbeat, and at times awkward. For instance, the food and bill took forever to come, and our water was never refilled even though the restaurant was not busy. Despite the shortcomings, interested diners should still come for the impressive lineup of dishes and great prices. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their other seafood and chicken items followed by their great looking desserts.

Perched atop the 64th floor of the majestic Hotel at Mandalay, Mix boasts some of the best views of the south strip in Vegas. Once you set foot inside the lavish ivory themed dining room, you know you're in an Alain Ducasse restaurant. The space simply oozes the charm and elegance of his signature opulent style reminiscent of the dining room at the Hotel Plaza Athne in Paris.  The glitz and glamour of Vegas is also quite apparent and you can't help but be dazzled by the contemporary and elegant atmosphere that envelops you.

With the beautiful weather I had been  experiencing over the weekend, I opted for patio seating with a direct view of the Vegas strip below. 

After glancing through the menu, I decided  to try Chef Ducasse's signature Tasting Menu with wine pairings.

Breads came out soon after with a selection of focaccia, French baguette, dinner rolls and sourdough with unsalted and an interesting "peanut" butter. The breads were room temperature and butters were cold so spreading was not pleasant but the breads served their purpose of filling my gullet til the main courses arrived. 

Amuse

Foie gras royale with port reduction and mushroom foam 

- this enticing little number exhibited a pleasant airiness and irresistible aroma from the mushroom foam and the interesting mix of flavors and textures married well together lending a savory yet earthy element to this whimsically fascinating dish

Gnocci
With Parmigiano Reggiano, veal jus and sun chokes.

Not the best Gnocci I've ever had but satisfying nonetheless. This dish had an incredibly comforting feel to it. I especially enjoyed the contrasting textures from the light & crispy chips and tender enoki mushrooms served with the dish. Warm, rustic yet subtle and familiar flavors were easy on my palate. 

Main lobster curry with coconut basmati rice 

- it's hard to go wrong with lobster, especially when you infuse thai flavors into a dish. The perfectly cooked lobster was bathed in a pool of curry and served stop luscious coconut rice. A delectable marriage of flavors.

Filet mignon Rossini with foie gras and black truffle sauce 

- this was easily my favorite dish of the night. The combination of filet mignon, foie gras and black truffle is like the holy trinity of fine dining.  The result will almost always result in endless drooling and licking the porcelain off your plate. 

Predessert

Coconut foam and mango rum cocktail. An exhilarating drink with bright notes and a sweet finish. Excellent palate cleanser and a perfect way to prepare my taste buds for the sweet finale.

Baba a la marnagnac

Unfortunately I wasn't as impressed with my dessert.
The liqueur for the cake was too strong and pungent while the flavors were just were too heavy handed. I may have myself to blame for that, as I may have given the cakes too heavy of a pour of the accompanying liqueur.

Overall, food was good but I must admit that I expected more from a multi Michelin star chef like Alain Ducasse.  IMO, the dishes lacked that wow factor that I was eagerly anticipating.  Service was also on the clumsy and awkward side the night I dined, as well. For instance, my wine pairing for one of my dishes was completely forgotten until I reminded the sommelier. Additionally, the wait staff seemed a bit hurried and rushed.  The furniture itself, which has probably seen better days, was in desperate need of an update, too. During my dinner one of my guests had to change their seat out because the chair was collapsing. For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected a bit more, at least chairs that weren't falling apart at the seams. 
With that said, they changed the chair out without a hitch and there were some redeeming factors which included the stunning views, beautiful setting and expansive bar next door.  
3.5 stars for now and hoping the restaurant makes some improvements on the menu, furniture, and service in the future.

Until then...

Happy Eats!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 52/100

Stayed in this hotel with my bf for the first time a few weeks ago and absolutely LOVED IT!

I had never heard of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay before. Apparently it's the nicer of the two towers at Mandalay Bay, and consists entirely of suite-style hotel rooms. 

My bf had booked our stay about four months in advance through Expedia, and he only paid around $110 per night for a HUGE suite for the two of us! It was amazing and you definitely get a bang for your buck!

Parking is free, as with most if not all of the hotels in Vegas. The parking garage is HUGE and has stairs, escalators, and elevators. There's also valet parking and a taxi drop off/pick up area.

Check-in was quick and easy. Lines weren't long and it took us around 5 minutes.

Decor/ambience is really great in this hotel. It doesn't really have a theme like a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's just modern, classy, and trendy. I really liked it!

Elevators were kinda confusing since depending on what floor you're on, you have a certain set of elevators you have to take. However, the elevators are AWESOME and INCREDIBLY fast! We stayed on the 20th floor and it only took a few seconds to get from our room down to the lobby and back!

Our suite was AMAZING. There was a living room area that had a couch, desk, chairs, coffee table, and a huge television! There was also a guest bathroom located right by the door if you have people over. It's a 1/2 bath so just a sink and toilet, but still really awesome! There's also a mini-bar area, but make sure you don't touch any of the items there because they are monitored with a weight system, and you are automatically charged for anything you pick up. 

The bedroom area of our room was really nice. We had an incredible king sized bed with a HUGE wall unit that had a TV in the middle, and his and hers closets on either side of it. The closets even had lights inside to see your clothes, and robes, slippers, hangers, etc.!

Our main bathroom was HUGE! It came with two sinks, toilet, a big shower, and a ginormous bathtub that could fit like 3 people in it. My college dorm room was honestly smaller than this bathroom...it was crazy!

The Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson show plays at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. We didn't watch it, but we plan on watching it during one of our future visits! 

The MIX Lounge at the top of the hotel is supposed to be da bomb. We didn't end up going up there but we saw a ton of people waiting in line to go up.

The ONLY things I didn't love about THEhotel were:

1) LACK OF WIFI IN ROOMS. I think they only had ethernet but that is useless when you only have your smart phone and iPad with you.

2) NO REFRIGERATOR IN SUITE. The bf tried to create a makeshift refrigerator with our ice bucket. Didn't really work...

3) LOCATION. That it's on the far south end of the strip. Like literally the last hotel. Fortunately we drove to Vegas so we used our car to drive further up the strip, but if you don't have a car I can imagine it being a huge issue. It's quite a long walk from THEhotel towards the middle/north end of the strip.

I would definitely stay at THEhotel again and highly recommend it! 5 stars!

**Review #600: The single best meal I've ever experienced**

To celebrate our one year wedding anniversary, my wife and I ate a feast fit for  royalty at Chef Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak. 

Located inside the MGM Grand, Craftsteak is a dimly lit, elegantly decorated high end steak house. 

The menu at CS is littered with amazing sounding salads, sides, steaks, seafood, desserts and more. Instead of trying one or two things, my wife and I decided to make this meal a memorable one and partake in their Domestic Wagyu tasting, which included a grand total of FOURTEEN dishes in three courses.  Ready?? Here we go;

Course 1- The Warm UP:

Yukon Gold Potato Puree W/ Chives http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=HM1EcDG60PgkrUeCMoDxow
Brussels Sprouts W/ Smoked Bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=Zgjpe4i2DSMbof64EhjJqA
Butternut Squash W/ A Maple Bourbon Glaze http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=WoM4UglD5nnYyT144_IW5A

Course 3- My Favorite Stuff:
Cinnamon Monkey Bread W/ Brown Sugar Sour Cream Ice Cream & Pecan Toffee http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=12a18ImEp5GMU4k417Nt0Q 
Guava Sorbet & Vanilla Bean Ice Cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=_vXAXf8OBLrJBrVgAS_02A 
Flourless Chocolate Cake W/ Blood Orange Sorbet & Tangerines http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=c0AWtBt9_3y1-WoR_BXkAA
Farmers Market Fruit Plate  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=iPcZn31A-sZQZdAPIT5Yzw

Everything and I mean EVERYTHING we ate was phenomenal. Not one dish disappointed me. I've had many meals in my life and this one now ranks as the biggest and best yet. The salads were great. The meat was juicy and melted in my mouth. The sides were fantastic and the desserts were mind blowing. I did have some favorites, which I'll list below. 
My favorite dishes in the first course were the tartare and the warm Frise salad.
My favorite dishes in the second course were the Wagyu ribeye and the Yukon Gold Puree (best mashed potatoes EVER). 
My favorite dessert was the cinnamon monkey bread.

The service here was top notch. We had two separate servers, both of whom were friendly and attentive. Both answered any questions we asked and trust me, we had a few.  

The price for the Wagyu tasting menu was $140 a person, which was not bad considering the massive amount of incredible food we received. In all honesty, I could not afford to do this on a weekly (or even monthly) basis but since I got lucky the night before at the Roulette tables, this meal only set me back about thirty dollars of my own money. Thanks, Vegas. 

If you ever have the opportunity to dine at Craftsteak, even if you can't afford a steak tasting (tastings start at $100 a person), then just order off their regular menu. I can't highly recommend Craftsteak enough. This truly was THE BEST meal I've ever had in my entire life.

I've never written about him before, I have a gay father. Well, technically he's not my real father but a man who I met some years ago. Coming out for me was pretty tough, married, house in the suburbs and a wife who I loved deeply. After coming out to her, my family and friends, my therapist suggested I quickly join an online support group for married gay men, and that's where I met Larry Johnson. A kind older man, Larry immediately took me under his wing; living in San Francisco it was easy for him to show me more about our mutual passion, food.  

Over the years we've exchanged thousands of emails and I've visited him in SF as often as I could, Larry taught me a great deal about fine dining. Including how to have food adventures and about getting the most out of life's pleasures. While my mom will always be my first food hero, Larry will always be my gay dad and has helped to make me who I am today. 

So when he comes into town for a visit I'm always a little stressed out about where to take him for dinner. This visit was easy, I decided to choose something basic and straight forward like steak. Opened 60 years ago, Durant's is not only a Phoenix institution but is also a great steakhouse. While the trend of new steakhouses in the Valley has finally started to taper off, Durant's classic approach is commendable and endearing. I'm talking about fantastically tender steak, understandable sides and professional service. 

Steakhouses in general are probably some of the most expensive restaurants in town. So I was ready to spend a mint on dinner but did notice one thing at Durant's, the steaks aren't ala carte. This means when you order a steak you're not only getting soup or salad but you're also getting your choice of accompaniment, what a value.

Entering Durant's from the rear will take you right through the kitchen, dont worry about this, its all part of the charm. You'll see that the kitchen is spotless and most of the cooks turn around and give you a warm smile and a happy hello. Once you get into the dining room its all old school. Black leather booths, crushed red velour wallpaper and dim lighting all set the mood for a relaxed and subdued dinner experience. 

Ordering the 16 oz Ribeye Steak ($39.50) was an easy choice for most steak lovers. The ribeye for has the perfect amount of marbling to meat ratio, this means that the meat will be really flavorful without being too fatty. I have to tell you, the ribeye at Durant's was one of the best steaks I've had in years. This thick juicy steak was everything that a steak should be, slightly salty with a distinct smoky char and perfectly tender. I also upgraded my side to the Stuffed Baked Potato ($4.95), think twice baked potato. 

Larry's 8oz New York Strip ($29.50) and loaded baked potato were delivered. Not only was the steak perfectly seasoned, it was expertly cooked at medium-rare as requested. 

A silence fell over the table as we enjoyed our meals together. Durant's not only impressed me and me made look good, but they made me proud of our restaurant heritage here in Phoenix. Durant's, thank you.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 39/100

My boyfriend and I were on a mission to try all of the Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas this weekend! BurGR was our second stop of the trip!

BurGR is located literally right inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel. SUPER easy to get to from the lobby! They have this AWESOME glass window display with a metal structure emitting a bunch of flames all over it. It's really interesting and a great storefront display! They also have a bunch of Gordon Ramsay merchandise at the front such as t-shirts, cookbooks, glasses, etc.

We were able to walk right in and get seated immediately. However, a few minutes after we had been sitting at our table, I looked over to the front of the restaurant and there was a HUGE line! We got super lucky that there was nobody there when we entered at around 11:15am.

The decor of this place is super trendy, modern, and basically a sports bar with all of the large screen TVs on all of the walls displaying football and other popular sports. There are also lots of flames everywhere (I'm assuming are related to Hell's Kitchen) and a photo of Gordon Ramsay.

Waiter service was great, as usual. Our waiter immediately came to us and asked if we wanted to take a look at the drink menu, which is an iPad 2 that they give you to look at. It is an interactive menu that has all of the drinks sorted by category (beers, cocktails, red/white wine, etc.), descriptions of each drink, and even photographs. There's also a tab with Gordon Ramsay's biography and photograph, which I thought was pretty cool.

We ordered two waters, a cup of coffee, and then took a look at the menus. The menus were pretty amusing because they, too, had a giant photo of Gordon Ramsay that surprises you when you first order them :P

My bf and I ended up sharing the Shake #4 - creme brulee pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie. THIS WAS AMAZING! I had seen photos of the shakes on Yelp and was curious to try them because I've never had a shake infused with pudding before. Thanks to this shake, I am a HUGE fan of the pudding + shake combination from now on :) So yummy! The two flavors look separated (with creme brulee on top and oreo on the bottom), but surprisingly when you sipped on it, the flavors were combined and complimented each other very well. I would love to come back to try the other 4 combinations!

As for burgers, I ordered the Uber Cheese Burger (fontina cheese + raclette cheese + goat cheese), and my boyfriend got the American burger (american cheese + butter lettuce + tomato + pickle + onion). As a HUGE cheese lover, my burger was absolutely PERFECT for me! It was literally just the patty + 3 types of cheese, which was exactly what I wanted. My bf nearly inhaled his American burger and said it was super good. We unfortunately decided to skip out on getting fries because we didn't have the appetite to eat that much food! I would definitely like to come back to try the truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries.

When we received our bill, we were given an iPod that had a little survey/questionnaire for us to answer based on our dining experience at BurGR. The Yelp Elite in me naturally reached for this and began answering the questions like crazy :P I thought it was pretty cool how much they integrated the use of iPads and iPods at their restaurant!

Overall, 5 stars for a really trendy, hip atmosphere, great service, and delicious food! I would love to come back during my next visit to Vegas! :)

My first visit being so-so, I decided to give Teriyaki Madness a second try to see if I liked it any better. For me it was still the same so-so experience and I don't get the hype over this place. Inside is very clean and they have plenty of tables to choose from and the booths are spacious which is nice. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu. Some of the food I ordered was really good and some of it was not so good. I do get coupons in the mail sometimes for BOGO offers, so I can see coming back with a coupon and probably will since the rice and chicken are pretty darn good and I work in the area, but I can't see making a point to come here often. 

Spicy Chicken Teriyaki Plate ($8.99) - I took the white rice that came with it and mixed it with the chicken. I liked the flavor of the chicken a lot. There was a good portion of both rice and chicken. I'd order this again for sure. 

Spicy Beef Teriyaki Plate ($9.49) - For an extra $1 this time I chose noodles instead of rice. The noodles were a bit dry and lacked flavor. The beef was tender and tasted good, but I tasted teriyaki flavor and no spice which was a bummer because I had enjoyed the spicy chicken and the chicken actually kick. The overpowering flavor of teriyaki on this one will most likely mean that I will stick to the spicy chicken instead.

Chicken Egg Roll ($1.99) - Inside I saw tons of what appeared to be black pepper yet the egg roll really had no flavor. It was filled with a generous amount of chicken, but it was greasy and flavorless. 

Chicken Pot Stickers ($3.29) - These were a greasy and overcooked mess. On the menu these are described as "crazy good" and I got 5 of them that were crazy greasy and hard. The inside tasted not so great. I will stick to the stickers elsewhere. 

Stir-Fry Veggies and a Green Salad are each options for sides. The salad came with a sweet dressing that tasted good. The veggies were basic yet tasty and fresh. 

Orders are made fresh so if you are on a lunch break or crunched for time then call your order in so it's ready or at least being made while you are on your way to pick it up.

I had been eyeing this place for a while because I heard the pastrami and corned beef was good here. Wrong! Maybe it used to be? First, they have no signs posted showing where this place is. They have the usual signs saying which way to go for what, but nothing for Zoozacrackers Deli. I finally looked up the number for Wynn and called to ask. I explained that I was standing in the casino and needed help finding this place! The woman who answered was polite and guided me to the correct place. Zoozacrackers Deli is attached to the sports book. The music being played is so loud that hubby and I had to yell at each other to have a conversation.

I walked up to the line that was somewhat long, but it moved fast. The woman who took our order was very friendly. Priced at $12.79 I ordered the "1/2 Deli Sandwich & Soup Combo" and because I wanted a Reuben it was $2 extra. I wanted to try their lemonade, but not at $5.50 a glass with no refills! The sodas are $3.79 each and you get free refills. The food took a while to come out, but when it did I couldn't wait to try it.

Reuben Sandwich - This was just flat out gross. All I could taste was swiss cheese and grease. The corned beef had no flavor. It looked good at first until I started to eat it and noticed the meat changes from a good color to fatty parts and gray colored parts. It just didn't look or taste like quality corned beef and the grease was all over my hands. The sandwich is supposed to come with sauerkraut yet it was in a small dish on the side of the sandwich. What the heck? Why wouldn't they have just put it on the sandwich to begin with since I didn't ask for it to be left off or anything? Weird. Also what is up with the size of this sandwich? I know I ordered the half sandwich, but when you have places like Greenberg's and Carnegie in town putting out the type of sandwiches they are, I can't see why anyone is coming here. Where's the beef?!?!?! I felt sick in my stomach from the grease and right after leaving ended up feeling sick through the night. No good.

Tomato Bisque - Size on this is great. The taste is blah. 

I expect more from a place inside the Wynn and was surprised at how dusty and dirty this place was. I did see a lady going around sweeping the floor, but a rag on the surrounding stuff would be awesome. Our total was $38.76 for 1 sandwich, 1 half sandwich, 1 bowl of soup and 2 sodas.  With other places that put out a much tastier sandwich and portion and the fact that I got sick and felt the price for what I got wasn't good, I wont be back.

After an evening of nonstop Vegas-style partying, the only words I managed to utter from my dry raspy voice the following morning was...water please!!!

In addition to replenishing my body with much needed liquids, I was feeling mighty peckish, as well!  After much deliberation, our group decided on a calm & relaxing sit down Saturday brunch at Thomas Keller's Bouchon. 

Located on the 10th floor inside the Venetian, the restaurant embodied what I've come to expect from a fine French bistro. The vibe was chic & refined yet relaxed and unfussy.  There were comfortable banquettes throughout the main dining area as well as outdoor seating in the patio area. We were subsequently seated inside. At 12:00pm, the sun was beaming from the patio, so our location filtered the intense light perfectly, which suited me and my solar sensitive eyes just fine. 

Complimentary house made jam was magnificent! The jam is freshly prepared each day and depending on the chef's mood, a different flavor variety is served. Today, he was feeling strawberry, which is my personal favorite! They served us an Epi baguette to share and it was fantastic, as well. Warm, buttery crust with perfectly chewy texture. Coupled with the soft butter and sweet pucker inducing jam, it was a match made in the stars.

The entrees were orchestrated perfectly as we didn't have to wait long at all.

Chicken n waffles - The waffles were made with bacon n chives and sourdough batter. It was airy and crisp with a lightly sweet flavor and a savory finish. It was so good i almost forgot to use the syrup!
The chicken was roasted perfectly and it was insanely moist & tender! The chasseur wine sauce was rich and flavorful with an alluring aroma. Some of my guests enjoyed the savory flavor so much they poured the irresistible sauce over their waffles, too!

Pork belly was fatty and incredibly flavorful and juicy.  Accompanied by the creamy hollandaise sauce, it was absolutely delicious!

Corned beef hash was phenomenal! Well seasoned pieces of corned beef mixed with all the traditional fixins that will impress any die hard corned beef hash purist!  Trust, this was far from canned! 

Short rib was tender, the fontina cheese was fragrant and the whimsically tiny jingle bell peppers added a pleasant little kick to this fantastic dish!

Beignets were served fresh out of the oven but they were quite dense and tasted more like doughnuts IMO Overall, they were very moist and with the added raspberry preserve filling, they added a sweet finish to our savory entrees.

Our service throughout the meal was very consistent with coffees, water, and juices always filled to the brim.

By the end of the meal we were absolutely stuffed!  But I didn't mind at all :D

My friends and I had a wonderful time and it was great feeling totally replenished and revived with good quality food that was masterfully prepared with fantastic service to boot. The strong coffee didn't hurt either!  I'm not quite sure if this particular location was ever awarded a Michelin star but IMO Thomas Keller deserves praise for a dining experience that was unpretentious, comforting and very enjoyable!

When we all left, I was sated, 100% refreshed and ready to take on the world, well at least another round of partying :) 

Hey, it's Vegas for crying out loud.

Happy Eats!

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Imagine you had a long day. And you wanted to relax and indulge in something incredibly scrumptious, delectable, and sinfully good.  Well... Think Sow.  Salty Sow.

We were over near the PV Mall and we decided, spur of the moment, to get something nearby. We thought of sushi and a few other places. But then we saw the three golden neon arrows pointing to the front door of the Salty Sow. 

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
The Salty Sow has that nouveau feel to it. The bar is off to the left as you enter, with a large kitchen straight in front of you. You see a lot of wood and interesting lighting (photos). But the feeling is very intimate. Even with other diners nearby, you cannot hear their conversations. The clientele is mixture of millennials and older, with a dozen or so sitting at both the bar and the dinning area. 

MENU:
Like most places in the Valley, the Happy Hour menu is a jumping off point for the  Dinner menu. When you are seated you are given both menus. There seems to be no pressure to order off of one or the other. The focus of the food is all things pork. So if you love bacon, then you have found your Nirvana in this life. LOL

Almost all the items on the Happy Hour menu are $5,00 and you find things like: Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries, Truffled Deviled Eggs, Pork Belly Tacos and Braised Beef Tacos and much, much more

SERVICE:
Everything is relaxed and our server Holly was excellent.  Folks stop by and ask about your meal and dishes are bused quickly

FOOD:
Okay, the best thing we tried was the HH Fried Chicken that came with a honey glaze and a large sweet potato biscuit (photo).  Even here there was bacon on the underside of the chicken.  It was moist, flavorful and delicious!

We also order two tacos which were equally good that came with a fried egg on top (photo).  But you must try the Duck Fat Fries, which were seasoned with herbs and salt.  It also comes with a poached egg yoke on top (photo).  Great stuff.

PRICES:
Everything at Happy Hour is $5.00 and it ends at 6:30 with the ringing of a cow bell.  Ahh, "we need more cow bells!"  LOL  Our bill came to $37.50 before taxes and gratuities, including two items to go and a soft drink ($2.50).

Debbie Downer:
Just before the check, we asked our server if we could order two items to go.  We also asked what the up-charge would be.  To our surprise, she said it would be the same price.

As we were leaving, the Culinary Manager approached us and said: 
"We normally don't allow people to order off the Happy Hour menu to go."  As I stamered to say we had checked first with our server, she said: "I'm going to let it go this time, but don't do it again."

NIGHTMARE ON FREMONT ST

My driver dropped me off at the hotel in the back and when I say driver I received a ride alone in a short bus from the airport. I was staying in the Carson tower and when I walked in I was informed to go to the Carson tower registration. 

So I started walking through the craziness of a Vegas Casino. Maneuvering around tired people who are drinking a lot and losing too much money. They are like rats trapped in a box for 4 days and 3 nights and are in no hurry to go anywhere. But I pushed on and made my way past the mayhem while dragging my suitcase to get to the Carson tower for check in.

When I arrived at the Carson registration desk there was a sign that said Desk closed. Check in at the Rush Tower. What? So now I had to go back through the mayhem again. I pushed through and when I got to the Rush Tower there was a sign that informed me to check in at the Gold Tower registration because the desk was closed. What?

At this point I felt like there were hidden cameras laughing at my every move. I took a deep breath and decided to look for the Gold Tower registration. I asked the lady running the high roller Keno room and she pointed me to the VIP check in door. I knew this wasn't correct but I was frustrated and I was going to make it work. 

So I walked in with my frustrated face and informed the staff of my wild goose chase I had just been on. I also dropped the Keno ladies name because it's always good to drop a name. I believe they took a little pity on me but the staff was very unapologetic to my dilemma. They were also very unfriendly and it was probably because I wasn't a high roller VIP. I did ask them if it's normal to send guests on a scavenger hunt to check in and they looked at me like it wasn't a big deal. I then asked if they were going to fix the incorrect signs and they told me no. After 10 hours of no sleep and traveling I had no more fight in me but I do know this was wrong. 

Upon walking to my room I finally walked past the open registration desk for the Gold Tower. I will say this was a frustrating way to arrive at a hotel. 

So I get into my room and start unpacking my bag. I then go to the bathroom to wash my face and realized someone had used the bathroom. Yes someone sat on the toilet seat, used the toilet paper, unwrapped the soap and used a clean towel. I'm too exhausted for this. I called down and spoke with the front desk. I also asked if I could be moved to a new room. Of course my request was denied and a maid was sent up to clean my room. A housekeeping manager walked in and told the maid to clean my whole room including the sheets. She was actually nice and hard working. So I left my room for an hour to let the maid do her job. 

Day 2...I wake up early and leave to get my work day started. When I arrived back 4 hours later my room wasn't clean. I spoke with the maid in the hall and she said they would clean my room by 1pm. She even wrote me on her list. I came back to the room at 2pm and it wasn't clean. I called Housekeeping and they said they would send someone up. I got back to my room at 5pm and it was still dirty. I called and spoke with a manager who promised to take care of it and my room was finally cleaned at 6pm. Honestly is it that hard?

Day 3...It was my only day to sleep in and the maid bangs 5 times with the vacuum cleaner even though I had a "Do Not Disturb" sign on my door! Was it necessary to ram my door that many times? It was just rude. She knew what she was doing. 

Day 4...The room was prepaid by my client but for some reason the hotel decided to charge my credit card. I called down to the front desk and they were no help. The girl on the phone was rude and unhelpful. Then when I went downstairs that same girl was there. She was mean to me because of our phone call. I asked her to only see a copy of my bill. She printed me a bill with my credit card charged. She then slid open a drawer where she had her personal cell phone and started texting. This was incredibly rude & why would you do this in front of an upset customer. I did snap a photo of her displaying this unacceptable behavior. I really believe the staff needs to go through a hospitality travel course because they don't get it. 

The hotel staff doesn't have any good customer service. The employees seem unhappy and it translates into the bad customer service I received. In all of my travels, I've never seen a more incompetent  staff, then here. 

On another note: the room was nice. I was expecting dirty old gross Vegas but that is not what I received. The casino was very modern. The pool had a shark tank in the middle which was really cool. You could even water slide through the middle of the sharks. This place wasn't what I expected. It's just sad that the customer service isn't there. I score hard on being treated nice and the Golden Nugget failed on every level.

Located inside the newly erected SLS Hotel in Vegas, Jos did not hold back with construction on this massive restaurant.  Once you pass the grand entrance, drama abounds as you're invited into a dimly lit space that's very much like the Bazaar in Los Angeles with interesting chachkes baubles and distinctive chandeliers of various shapes and sizes.   

While our table was being prepared, we opted to sit at the bar and enjoy a few fascinating cocktails crafted by the bartender. 

Moments later, we were escorted to our table where our server Nick introduced himself. 
Nick was warm friendly and offered some thoughtful suggestions from the menu. On that note, I'd have to say my experience was elevated to VIP status because he was quite the accomplished server. He was very attentive and made every effort to check with us throughout the evening and ensured our experience was nothing less than top notch. 

Foie Gras Cotton Candy - A classic at The Bazaar that is not to be missed, especially since it's been banned practically everywhere else!

Bagel & Lox
Plump salmon roe served with soft cream cheese in a light and crispy cone. Briny yet smooth and creamy with a crunchy finish, phenomenal!

Grissini Wagyu Beef Carpaccio - 
Fragrant onion infused breadsticks wrapped with thinly sliced wagyu beef that's so insanely soft & tender, it will virtually melt in your mouth.  Served with a decadently rich and flavorful Parmesan espuma dip, your mouth will be savoring the rich permeating flavors long after you've devoured every morsel of this fantastic dish.

King Crab & Shrimp Cocktail - 
Served chilled on a bed of ice, I quickly noticed generous portions of chunk king crab & plump shrimp bathing in a bright red cocktail sauce. My mouth quickly started to water and once I took a bite, my eyes lit up. Bright acidity from the sauce coupled with the fresh juicy and plump king crab meat & shrimp made for a light and refreshing cocktail that was refreshingly substantial down to the very last bite.

Oysters 
Kushi, Shiboku, Blue Point - 
Fresh, briny, perfectly sized with a plump and juicy mouthfeel and went down the hatch beautifully.

Foie Gras floating island - 
Served in a small tea cup, this flavorful dish was far from dainty. It was actually quite rich and velvety smooth with a spectacular nutty finish. Foie gras lovers will revel in this richly satisfying dish.

Robuchon Potatoes - 
With the signature Robuchon name stamped on these potatoes, I was confident I was in for a treat but words simply can not describe the out of body experience that you'll have when you try these amazing mashed potatoes. Buttery smooth and decadently rich. Simply divine. 

Roasted Corn - 
Don't let the diminutive size fool you, these snappy little guys don't only pack an irresistible crunch but a surprisingly spicy kick, as well! 

Skirt Steak - 
A beautifully cooked steak with a perfectly pink tender and juicy flesh.

Kobe - 
Easily the best cut of steak ive ever had. Buttery, juicy, fatty, tender and infinitely satisfying. You'll literally shed a tear of joy when you enjoy this outstanding cut of premium beef. And trust, this beef is legit! They even prove it with an actual certificate of authenticity that's handed to you at the end of your meal! Now that's rich ;)

We ended our meal with a selection of the restaurant's fine desserts presented in a beautiful red pastry box. 

I'd have to say this was one of my better dining experiences in Vegas and much of it came from the wonderful service and of course, inspiring cuisine!

Happy Eats!

I wanted to try a new place for dinner and am glad we found this one. Here It's worth it for just the drinks alone! This place used to be a Pizza Hut, but once you step inside you forget about all of that. Inside was very clean and they offer plenty of seating. You walk up to the counter to place your order and then they give you a number to place on your table. When your food is ready it is brought out to you. Our food didn't all come at the same time which seemed odd. The girl who took the order was very nice and offered me samples of their freshly made drinks. 

Watermelon Agua Fresca ($2.50) - Very tasty and refreshing. I couldn't put it down! They have many other flavors just ask for a sample to see which you'd like. 

Mini Taco Al Pastor ($2) - This has onions cilantro, salsa and a fair amount of meat. I thought the tortilla tasted good and the taco was decent. Not as good as some of the street vendors I have been to, but decent for the price and nice flavor. They also have tacos similar to "Los Tacos' that are $4.50 each, but come with sour cream, rice, rice, beans, cheese, salsa and avocado.

Rice and Beans ($2) - Sadly, they were out of rice. I said that it was ok and I'd just try the beans. They apologized and gave us an extra side of beans instead. I was hoping with a place called Frijoles, that they would have amazing beans. I just thought they were ok. They weren't bad. Just nothing wow and could have used more seasoning or something.

Chips and Guacamole ($3) - I love that they use fresh avocados here! The guac tasted great, but could have used a bit more salt. The chips were very good.

Cheese Quesadilla ($2.50) - Simple yet tasty from the first bite. The tortilla tasted good and it wasn't loaded with cheese, but what was there could be tasted and it was good. Simple can be very good sometimes! 

I'm glad we tried this place and look forward to coming back and trying more. The only downside, they have no salsa bar. They need a salsa bar!

What an amazing experience from start to finish! Locals are in for a treat and I have no doubt that word is about to get out. I'm considering myself lucky to be amongst the first set of patrons. 

I have found myself a new favorite sushi spot in Vegas! Got my megaphone out and I'm spreading the good word, starting now. I'm making a prediction that I'm about to become the Duchess of Soho Japanese Restaurant. I'm ready to duke it out for that crown so bring it! ;)

Unreal! These prices are too good to be true... especially for the quality you get! The sushi quality is comparable to high-end restaurants on The Strip. I highly suggest running, not walking, to check Soho Japanese Restaurant out now.  

Took some friends here and every single thing we tried was excellent. The chef hit the ball way out of the park! 

Some things that I recommend trying are:

Ty Ku Coconut Nigori Sake... only $21 for 720 ml (WOW! I'm moving in!)

SOHO Tostadas - Tuna - Hawaiian Poke Sauce (pictured)

Beef Tataki (probably my favorite dish but I'd be hardpressed to choose a favorite, pictured.)

Rock Shrimp Tempura with 3 different sauces (faves were jalapeo aioli and the sweet banana sesame)

Spicy Tuna with Crispy Rice (pictured)

Soft Shell Crab Roll (second favorite, pictured)

Crme Brle (pictured... all of the desserts were really good though so don't mean to leave them out. Just ask my stunt double, she knows all about it! *wink*)

If there's something you usually order that is not on the menu, ask and you might receive. I get the impression that they are still gauging what people would like to see on their menu and/or they're willing to make it if they have the ingredients and it's not. 

I would have taken more pics but everything looked so good it was hard to get everyone to wait before going to town on the food. Our guests were extremely impressed with Soho and it didn't break the bank to take them here. I cannot believe all that we ordered and what we ended up paying. It was especially cool when the owner himself, Mr. John Lee, came out to welcome us. He made us feel like true VIPs and he was really personable and funny. He told us about his plans and I like what he is trying to do with his place. I wish him nothing but the best. 

I have no doubt that Soho Japanese Restaurant is going to do well. The news is going to start spreading like wildfire, mark my words! 

I'm eating there again tonight. Yep, it is THAT good!

Update: As you can tell by my checkins I go here quite regularly. Recently, one of my dining companions needed to eat gluten free because she has celiac disease. Chef John Lee hooked up many options for her. My guests were so impressed! Thanks Soho Japanese Restaurant and John Lee for all the extra special things that you do.

WED, MARCH 27, 2013 // 12:00PM-2:00PM 
                 PRICE FOR 2: $63.98 (TR price) + $5.18 (tax) + $10.84 (tip) = $80.00
                 WAIT: 15-20mins
                 SERVER: DAWN - (4/5). She looked frazzled but always made time to check up on us. Asked me if I wanted more Peachy Tea when I finished, refilled our waters, & brought us 2 carafes when we asked for coffee.

FRI, MARCH 29, 2013 // 5:00PM-7:30PM
                 PRICE FOR 2: $99.98 (TR price) + $8.10 (tax) + $16.42 (tip) = $124.50
                 WAIT: 25-30mins
                 SERVER: IRANDA - (1/5). We had to chase her down 3x, she ignored our table completely. When we asked for coffee, she brought us 1/2 empty cups (spilled coffee all over the saucers). VINCE (4/5), not our server, was friendly, paid closer attention & cleared our table multiple times.
_________________________

Bacchanal can be overwhelming since there are a LOT of dishes to choose from. Between Bacchanal & Wicked Spoon, if you only have time for one and care more about the selection - go to Bacchanal. (Save room for the CREPES!) 

THINGS I CRAVE: 1.) Lasagna, 2.) Prime Rib, 3.) Crepes, 4.) Machaca, 5.) Posole.

Personally, though, Wicked Spoon still wins in just a few minor areas: a few key dishes that are well executed, bone marrow at dinner, and smooth creamy gelato as opposed to the grainy ice cream at Bacchanal. It's also slightly less expensive, less crowded, and comes with much more consistently reliable service.

CONSENSUS: Would try to make time for both on my next trip to Vegas - Bacchanal for lunch, Wicked Spoon for dinner.

First and foremost this is my first review and I cant believe how absolutely appalled I am.  But, here it goes.....So my wife and I are in town for a family emergency and decided to have lunch because we had a lil time on our hands. We drove past HAG on LV blvd and it caught my eye because of the name and I love a great burger. Upon entering I was excited and looking forward to it the place seems almost like a Hooters but for Burgers. The smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicky for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear items that others have wore before but I figured hey WTH the waitress we had was very personable and  nice but was new. the prices were very high for such a simple menu. My wife ordered the smallest burger and fries and I was talked into the Quad bypass burger. with like 20 strips of bacon! I asked our waitress if the restaurant offered military discount as I often do when I am on a budget and travelling. She said "Let me ask" upon returning she said "No sorry" I was thanked her for asking. Either way I though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so I was looking forward to the food regardless. At this point I was very excited and amused on the place and was talking to my wife about how this place should/would be a goldmine. They offered malt liquor (Strange in a restaurant)in a can I ordered a Tecate she a sugar Coke.
Now for the twist of events..... Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes which is great but I was skeptical, The Burger was massive and looked so good but it was warm to the touch at best I had approx 3 bites and noticed the bacon looked as if had been microwaved from being cooked days ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistency-(Gross) The cheese was not melted, The fries looked like they were cooked in old oil due to the almost black color in nature. I tried my hardest to stomach this but I couldnt. I proceeded to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cooked to order at first she replied yes and then said something that made me raise an eyebrow, she began on informing me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old because of the way the owner is. I asked her to elaborate and she said he is so cheap that he makes his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut costs. She also informed me she almost walked out her second day on the job because of what he acts like in his day to day operations. She looked excited when I asked to speak to him about the quality and preparation of my food. When the Owner/manager Jon came to the table he sat down opposite from me and was very hostile. At this point I was pretty much amazed I would assume he would address my concerns in a professional and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimidation and apprehension. I said I would please like another burger due to the dissatisfaction of it not being fresh. He looks at myself and my wife and says' " In six years I have never comped a meal and it won't be today!!" I proceeded to inform him I simply wanted another burger and I am not looking for a comp. He then informed us that he would call the police if we didnt pay I said I would not pay for a burger like this especially one that i didnt touch. From his demeanor at this point I wanted to leave so i said look I will pay for my wifes and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this quality of food.
At this point I felt threatened and was basically being held against my own will. I said fine Please call the police. He proceeds to lean over and say, You know what " you started it when you asked for a discount" I was like "What"? He then says I cant stand the "F" ing military I was so appalled that he was addressing me like this in general and then he begins to say, I'm from Oxnard, Ca. and we used to beat the "S" out of filthy mexicans like you! At this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief He leaves and the table next to me were also expressing there disgust in the food and as he saw us speaking with them he said to leave right now we were trespassing! As I leave I attempt to tip my waitress and he rips the money from my hand! My wife and I wait outside for the police THE WHOLE TIME WE are waiting quietly the owner is harrassing us going on a tirade about my race and my occupation being totally distasteful in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up (LVPD) I provide them ID and they are in absolute disbelief they resolve the issue after questioning and bottom line it does not matter the police officer said I had to pay I totally understand and uphold the law but requested that I receive what I pay for (At least I gave it away to a homeless man.
BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: 1. DO NOT GO THERE FOR QUALITY OR FRESHNESS  IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS NOT 2. THE OWNER IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING. 3.YOU ARE WARNED. PLEASE DONT BE ROBBED OR DEGRADED LIKE ME  GO ANYWHERE ELSE.

I shouldn't give this place a two because the description says, "Meh.  I've experienced better."  Well, I haven't experienced better because this is my only experience with a male strip club.  

I should give this place a big fat ZERO because I'm pretty sure the bartender roofied me.  

Why do I think he roofied me?  Let me tell you.  

A friend of mine had her bachelorette party in Vegas and her maid of honor thought up this brilliant idea of making us all wear corsets- bridesmaids/friends in black and the bride in white.  Well, I'm rather busty, but luckily I saw my drunken future and prepared for the inevitable.  More about this later. 

So, we make The Olympic Garden our first stop and right away the guys bombard us.  They cornered us individually so that we couldn't consult on who everyone was buying lap dances for, and thus we all bought multiple lap dances for the same people.  This is when I learned that lap dances make me uncomfortable, especially if I haven't even had a damn drink yet.  I actually made the poor guy so uncomfortable he asked me if I was feeling ok.  I just don't find guys who kiss their own biceps while gyrating on top of me sexy... I find it funny and maybe a little sad, but not sexy.  

After I was dance raped, I made my way to the bar where I recognized the bartender.  My dad owned a bar and I knew this guy had totally worked for him (Note to self- my dad must be a real asshole if this guy did indeed roofie me [sorry daddy, but I'm sure you stopped reading at dance rape if for some reason you stumbled upon this review] and also, this is a small, small world).  So, I asked the guy and after finding out who I was he started pouring me shots.  I had about three the entire time we where there.  Trust me, I can handle three shots and this was all I had to drink for the rest of the night.  Not only that, but he was the only person who came in contact with these shots other than my mouth.  

This is where my memory gets fuzzy and eventually it just goes dark, but before I forget who I am I decide it'd be fun to call home and tell my dear old dad who I ran into.  Thank God my brother answered and screened the call.  I don't even know what I said to him, but he told me I was pretty out of it.  Last memory from here on out is an image of the limo pulling up and my friends piling in. 

The next day.  I wake up in my hotel room with a start.  I have no idea where I am at first.  I have no idea how I got there and I have no idea how I got out of the corset from last night.  This is where my friends and my boyfriend at the time fill me in.  Luckily, he just happened to be there for the bachelor party, but unfortunately my near death state forced him to miss out on all the stripper action.  Haha, sucker.  

So, apparently I was completely gone like I'd never been before.  I fell down multiple times in public places and even knocked a friend into an open trash can.  It was so bad that a security guy at MGM Grand offered me a wheelchair, but my friends were afraid he was just some random guy trying to molest me so they continued to lug me around.  I had horrible bruises all over my body the next day to prove just how embarrassing this all must have been.  Here is where my good planning for a drunken future comes in.  I knew that my corset had a tendency to slip, so I wore a lace cami underneath just in case I got too drunk to pay attention to wardrobe malfunctions.  This proved rather smart because all the falling down pulled my corset right off of you know what.  If I hadn't been wearing that cami I would have looked like I was dressed for a topless review. 

I also puked in a cab at some point.  The cab driver started yelling in another language and a girl I barley knew caught my freakin' throw up in her hands.  IN HER HANDS! 

Once they got me to the room, I was completely out.  I mean, dead to the world.  Well, until I guess one girl got on my nerves enough to wake me out of my stupor.  My friends told me she was complaining about everyone wanting to wait around a bit to make sure I was okay.  So, I popped my head up long enough to say, "Be cool, bitch."  That was the last thing I would do or say until the morning.

My poor boyfriend got wind of the state I was in and said I looked like a dead person when he went up to check on me.  He missed out on the rest of the night for fear I would stop breathing.  Apparently, I was completely non-responsive.  

The next day, I wanted to kill myself.  I have never felt a hangover like that in my entire life.  It was HORRIBLE.  

In conclusion, I have no way of knowing what was in those drinks.  All I know is that no amount of binge drinking ever rendered me completely unconscious and without memory of an entire night worth of events.  Everything after leaving the strip club is like a dark hole in my memory- it's just blank, as if the rest of the night didn't even exist.

P.S.  I highly identified with The Hangover... for obvious reasons.

The food is outstanding but you have to wait for it. Is it worth it?

The Oyster Bar is inside the Palace Station Casino. The bar only has 18 seats. 

We got here at 8:30 pm on a Monday thinking we could avoid the infamous wait. No such luck, eleven people ahead of us in line. The line did not move for 40 minutes. When it finally moved, it went quick. At the one hour mark, we got seated. Yay. 
Well not so fast. 

After you're seated, you're given a sourdough roll and butter. Thank you, thank you thank you. We were starving and that helped a lot. A few minutes go by and they take our order. We waited so long I memorized what we wanted a half an hour ago lol. 

40 minutes later our soup comes out. 
An hour & 15 minutes from being seated we got the oysters. 
At the two hour mark from being seated we got our entrees. 
3 hour 15 minutes from waiting in line to finishing our meal. 
Was it worth it?

Here's the rundown:
New England Clam Chowder - Delicious. The bowl was full of clams and the soup was just outstanding. 

Oyster (a dozen) - was so so good. Cocktail sauce, horseradish and lemon accompanied the oysters. One of the best oysters I've ever had. The chef was having problems with one of the oysters (didn't want to stay in the shell) we were playfully teasing him about it and he was such a sport about it. We all had a good laugh and he put an extra oyster in for us. A bakers dozen, all delicious. 

Plaza Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab, chicken and andouille sausage. It's my first pan roast and it was delicious. The brandy and cream was a good combination. All the proteins were cooked perfectly. I specially liked the andouille sausage, a little hint of spiciness worked well with the broth.  I got a number 7 on the heat scale. It was not spicy for me at all. I could not finish my bowl, it was so rich and I had a lot of oysters. Lol. I will have a good lunch tomorrow for sure. 

I was also able to taste the following dishes. 
Combo Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab and lobster. My Mom's choice. Zero on the heat scale. It was as good as mine. Tasted the lobster and that was very good. Good amount of it too. Lol. 

Bouillabaisse - was so good. My brother's dish. 7 on the heat scale. It was spicy. Ouch. But it was really good. The broth was clean and very flavorful. It had shrimp, crab, lobster, mussels & clams. Great broth. I would get this next time. 

Service was excellent. The chef was friendly and entertaining. 

The wait. It didn't bother me at all. It was more entertaining than anything else. I got to talk to other people waiting in line and making fun of the situation we were in. I even got to meet a couple of local Yelpers and she told us about a Korean/Mexican fusion restaurant (Komex). The 3 hours went by really fast. 

It's an experience I won't soon forget and isn't that why we go to these places and go through all the hoops. Lol
Was it worth it?
I say Yes!!

We had great service
We had great food. 
We had great conversations
We had a memorable night. 

I'll definitely be back

I just literally got back from there and I have mixed emotions. I would say my experience was bittersweet. Let me explain.

What is it about bacon that makes everything good? The saltiness? The greasy goodness? Maybe its the fact that it is really not good for you that it makes it taste that much better. Well, the fact that this place has a bacon theme is what sold me.

With that said, I came with my wifey to check it out. I ordered The Cure and she ordered the Man Candy. We also got the Garlic Parmesan Fries because I love garlic. Then, we capped it off with dessert by getting the Panookie.

The Cure (13.95). Pork Belly with 2 Fried Eggs and Tomato Jam on a French Baguette. 
This entre was a bit overwhelming. First off, it is very messy, as soon as you pick it up, you have grease and/or egg yolk running down your arms. The pork belly itself was more belly than pork. A lot of fat with some slivers of actual pork. It tasted decent, but a lot of the fat turned me off.

Man Candy (6.95). Glazed Bacon with Cayenne accompanied by Maple Syrup to dip it in. 
Now this masterpiece is a magnificent piece of art that has been placed in a jar for your eyes to feast on. Dip it in the syrup and you will be in bacon heaven. Now this entre alone is worth the trip just to come here. I recommend getting this no matter what you or your party decides on getting. 

Garlic Parmesan Fries (4.95). French Fries sprinkled with grated Parmesan Cheese and Garlic Powder.
Now this I was a bit disappointed. To me, if you are going to serve the best Garlic Parmesan Fries, use real bits of garlic and sliced parmesan/romano cheese. The best I have had is at another restaurant that I will not mention out of respect for these guys. Message me if you are interested in that place.

Panookie (5.00). A niced sized Cookie baked in a aluminum dish topped off with Whipped Cream, Ice Cream and Chocolate Syrup.
It's exactly as described. Ours was a bit burnt on the bottom so it was a bit hard. I think it was a bit overcooked. It probably would of been great it it wasn't burnt.

Service was decent. Our server was on point with order taking, refills, etc. which it should of been because it was just us and another party of 2 she was serving.

Ambience: Since it's called "Bacon Bar", you have to picture a typical bar scene with people hanging out and of course, smoking. Even though we were seated in the "Dining Area", we weren't really sealed off from the smoke coming from the bar. So basically you will be inhaling second hand smoke guaranteed. At the bar you have to be 21. But you can bring your kids to the dining area. Now this to me is a big negative. You and your party will be exposed to secondhand smoke.

So my 3 star rating is a bit generous since my original thought were 2 stars. Like I mentioned earlier, the Man Candy alone warrants a visit here. For you not so bacon lovers, they have other things like Pizza, Wings, Pasta, etc. for your other dining options so bacon doesn't have to be your default choice.  Also, they are open 24 hours which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. Next time I will try the Bacon Burger and I will see if it can be bumped up to 4 stars.

An award winning dining experience that will leave you sated and infinitely satisfied!

As soon as we stepped inside the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the restaurant manager who proceeded to lead us to our seats by the window. 
Located inside the newly erected Augustus tower of Caesar's Palace, the restaurant embraced a contemporary elegance that was refined yet simple and unfussy.  With warm tones from the rich wood panels, ceilings that soared high up, and large glass paneled windows with a peek a boo view of the Bellagio fountains, the ambiance was nothing less than magnificent!
  
The sommelier was helpful and knowledgeable as he started us with some bubbly and as soon as I saw a bottle of vintage Krug, I knew I was in for a treat!

The server was equally friendly and suggested The Chef's Signature Tasting Menu, which showcased the restaurant's acclaimed dishes.  Frankly, It goes without saying I went with the chef's signature tasting menu.  When in Rome, right folks?

Amuse Bouches

Foie gras with black truffle
Crisp toastettes pierced together with creamy smooth foie gras and irresistible black truffle was a decadent play of flavors and textures in the mouth. 

Parmesan waffle
Light fragrant and perfectly crisp and a delightful start to a sumptuous meal.

Cold zuchini soup with diced Radish & celery seed powder - very refreshing with a pleasant bite from the diced radishes

Fingerling potatoes with cream cheese and ham and topped with watercress. A charming little surprise that came with the cold zucchini soup.  This accompaniment rounded out our amuse plates wonderfully but something was telling me it probably wasn't the last surprise of the evening!

First Course

Heirloom tomatoes wedges with watermelon and tomato gelee - refreshing and vibrant! the addition of the frozen tomato added just enough saltiness to the sweet heirloom tomatoes and the addition of the crisp basil was surprisingly delightful!

Surprise #2 A tomato tartar topped with a pomegranate gelee and  basil drops was lightly flavorful and beautifully plated.

2nd dish

Colors of caviar - elegant and perfectly composed with layers of complex flavors and rich textures that paired beautifully with the champagne and meant to be savored slowly

3rd dish

Fish with ratatouille - Perfectly cooked, and the fish was imported from the southeast of France...Si Bon! Presented with its natural jus foam, the flesh was supple and soft to the touch with my fork. The ratatouille added the perfect amount of rustic flavor to this light yet incredibly flavorful fish

4th dish
Foie Gras - Considering its recent ban in California, I have found my new mecca for foie gras...Vegas baby! Served with a side of duck jus in a shot glass steeped in chopped fresh beets, green tea with crispy rice, the foie gras was absolute perfection. It was decadently rich and the orange zest cleansed the palate perfectly! Without a doubt, one of my favorite dishes of the evening!

5th
Black Truffle Soup - served with a warm buttery brioche that tasted like a flaky pastry. We were encouraged to dip the brioche into the velvety smooth soup. Infused with an incredibly rich depth of flavor imparted from the black truffle shavings and Parmesan flakes, this well composed soup was absolutely sublime and left my taste buds dancing long after i finished it!

6th dish
Filet mignon tenderloin with bone marrow was simply exquisite. The filet was insanely tender and very flavorful. The bone marrow that topped the filet was buttery soft and paired nicely with the filet. The shoulder cut of beef wrapped in delicate ribbons of carrot exhibited a briny flavor that added an earthy element to the dish, as well.

Desserts

Dessert Amuse Bouche - Apricot sorbet and with diced apricot. Tart, refreshing, and an excellent palate cleanser

Coconut 6 ways - An splendid little dessert with an interesting mix of textures that made it a sheer joy to eat!

Chocolate ganache with praline cream. Divine & a chocolate lover's dream come true!

Everything ended with a citrusy sorbet with creme fraiche as a final palate cleanser...

But our sweet journey didn't end there!  A large dessert cart was then rolled out for us to choose to our heart's content. We went with a variety of the server's tempting suggestions and then came the cheese cart! Seriously, the dinner lasted over 3 hours, but i hardly felt the time pass because i was enjoying myself so much!

At the end of the meal, we were greeted by the chef and left with complementary muffins to enjoy the following morning.

In short, the wait staff was kind courteous and very informative. Food was brought out at a very good pace and we never felt rushed or felt like we waited forever between dishes.

I would highly recommend Guy Savoy for any special occasion. It will leave you with an unforgettable experience that you will cherish for years to come.

Happy Eats!

I really enjoy the Sicilian pizza from the Cugino's across town, so when I noticed this location I wanted to check it out. Before walking in, I noticed a sign at the door promoting their current specials. When I saw they offered a 2 slice Sicilian special with drink I knew that would be what I wanted to get. I have been in more than once and the same sign is out front with several different specials on it, but they don't always have them all available. So far each time I have been in (even at dinner time) they don't have any Sicilian ready unless you order a whole pizza. They only have had some regular slices available. When I asked the guy behind the counter about it, he said that it just depends what time you get there and says they sell out quick. If people like it so much why not have more of it ready? Oh well I do agree it's tasty! I ended up getting the 2 slice special with a drink. For just cheese slices it's only $4.99 and with pepperoni it's $5.99 which isn't bad at all. The slices are decent size and like how the crust is thin yet has just the right crispness to it. I have eaten inside, but I have also taken my lunch back to work with me and I like that the pizza is still nice and warm and the crust isn't soggy by the time I drive back and eat it. This is a plus because let's face it, not all take-out tastes the same once you get it home vs. eating it right when you get it. The inside is clean and the employees are friendly. Definitely better than average pizza, so if you are in the area give it try.

I never have been a huge fan of Johnny Rocket's, so when I found out The Wiener's Circle would be taking the spot JR was in, I was happy. A lot of the signs say it's near the bowling alley when it's actually closer to the doors near the buffet. I have enjoyed my experience at The Wiener's Circle inside Red Rock, but there is something about this location inside Santa Fe that was just better to me. If you are familiar with the original The Wiener's Circle in Chicago, then you know they have a different attitude when it gets dark. Here at this location they don't sling any insults (they play games with customers and sling expected insults at the original location after a certain hour even handing out free food and shirts sometimes) or play any games, but what I have experienced is great customer service. The guy who took my order was very nice and patient while I went over the menu. He also told me about different combo deals that include fried and a drink. I have to give them props as far as the menu prices go. Being in a casino usually means marked up prices and sometimes not the same product you'd expect, but I found the prices to be fair and the food tasted great. I've been back a few times now and will be back plenty more! 

Char Dog - I got the combo priced at $6.99 that came with fries and a drink. The dog had onions, relish, mustard, pickles, tomatoes, peppers and celery salt. I asked that the dog be lightly charred and that's exactly what I got. The cook even came over to our table to make sure I liked it. I had them add cheese to my fries and the cheese sauce is thick and delicious! I could eat a huge pile (they already give you 1/2 pound with your order) of just those fries covered in cheese and my taste buds would be happy. 

Chicken Fingers - As a combo it was $7.99 with fries and a drink. They also give you a choice of mustard, ranch and honey mustard to dip your fingers. I really like the honey mustard here it goes well with the fingers. The fingers didn't look to plump or appetizing when I first saw them, but they really had good flavor and the chicken tasted good enough with out any sauce to dip, but trust me and pair it with the honey mustard. 

Wieners in a Blanket  - These were $4.99 and tasty little bites! They come 6 to an order, but when I got my order I noticed I had 8 of them. Score! You can choose a dipping sauce for these so I obviously chose honey mustard. I don't think these would fill someone alone, but they make a great snack to share along with your meal or nice portion for a kids meal. 

They have booths and tables or you can get your food to-go.

Wow!  Now that I've been to Rose.Rabbit.Lie, I understand how the whole thing fits together and works.  I had a free ticket for the show last night and I made a dinner reservation, too.  The website said they were fully booked, but when I called the Cosmopolitan, she made a reservation for me.

I got my ticket at the box office on the second floor and went to the Rose.Rabbit.Lie entrance at 6 PM for my reservation.  There was a couple in line ahead of me.  They weren't yet open.  There's a lot of security and ear pieces in this area across from the Wicked Spoon buffet.  When they opened, the woman asked me if I wanted a table or to sit at a bar.  Since I was alone, I told her the bar.  She asked which one I wanted to go to and I couldn't answer.  I let her choose and she took me to the Library Bar.

There are several rooms behind closed doors after you enter the main door.  On the left was the Library, a small room with about 8 tables and 8 or so seats at the bar.  I took the end seat and I was so glad this was where I was.  We could hear the music from next door--it turned out to be the Music Room--and the bartender who waited on me was Anthony!  He was perfect--knowledgable about the menu and he made some great recommendations to me.  

Most of the dishes are tapas style.  I ordered the Brussels sprouts with crispy chicken skin. Manchego cheese and Spanish paprika.  I also ordered Tte de Cochon--pig head with a slow cooked egg.  The pig head was cooked and the meat was seasoned and formed into a small rectangle.  It was lightly battered with panko breadcrumbs and lightly fried.  Served with a soft poached egg, it was delightful.  Breaking the egg and letting it run over the pork was so very good!  The Brussels sprouts were wonderful!  I could not have had two better recommendations!

I chose desert on my own.  I ordered the butterscotch pudding with a chocolate and hazelnut "stone".  The dessert was a perfect ending to the meal.  The butterscotch was salted and the "stone" was very tasty!

Service was excellent and sitting at the bar was a show in itself.  Anthony showed me and the gentleman seated next to me the 3 kinds of special ice cubes they make for Rose.Rabbit.Lie.  Quite interesting and creative.

From here, I was shown to the Music Room where I listened to a 5 piece combo play.  There was a singer who walked on the bar in the Music Room.  One of the entertainer/ushers--a friend of mine--came in to work.  I had no idea he had gotten a job here.  He told me that we'd be shown into the Ballroom (another place to eat and drink) and then we'd go to the showroom.  The combo and the singers went into the Ballroom and then the doors were opened to the Showroom.  

The show is called Vegas Nocturne and although the website lists it as 70 minutes, it's more like 95 minutes in length.  There are two types of chairs and I got seated in a row that had the hard folding chairs.

The show is a milder version of its cousin, Absinthe.  The acts are lower key in a way because of the low ceiling.  The acts are very good, the comedy is quite funny, and it was a perfect end for my evening.  Katy Perry was in the audience.

This was a wonderful evening and I'm so glad I went.  I'm not sure I'd pay the full price for the show.  It's a bit steep considering the other entertainment available on the Strip but as part of an entire evening at Rose.Rabbit.Lie, it was just perfect!

***Bellagio has many iconic Las Vegas elements like the fountains, their seasonal gardens, the popular Cirque du Soleil show O, and high-end cuisine; these features make Bellagio a must visit to at least just take a look; however (on my visit), my room was not as nice as other upscale hotels I have stayed at on The Strip***

When I first visited Las Vegas a long time ago, Bellagio was the most talked about hotel and the most upscale hotel (or at least near the top) on The Strip.  Since then, there have been many new hotels that have joined The Strip and some as elegant or even more elegant than Bellagio.

Bellagio definitely has a beautiful exterior with the impressive and vast lake as well as the signature fountains.  Inside, you will find the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens--a constantly changing (with the seasons) exhibit that makes for a good photo opportunity.  Bellagio also features quite a few notable fine dining spots including Picasso, Le Cirque and Michael Mina.  There is also a gourmet French patisserie (Jean Philippe) though all of these great things are open to the public and do not require a room stay, which is expensive though often less expensive than The Cosmopolitan, Wynn or Encore.

My room was nice.  It was fairly contemporary though there were a lot of traditional touches with the bedding and furniture.  The room did lack the sleek and modern look of the rooms at Aria.

The bathroom was nice--very spacious with standalone showers and bath tubs.  There were a few areas where the room could have been better.  The TV was an old fashioned deep TV and not a flat screen.  I often never turn on a hotel room TV though I imagine some would be disappointed to find such an outdated TV in an upscale hotel like Bellagio.

The other negative, which was a big one, was the room temperature.  The A/C unit was not that good and even after having maintenance look at it, the room just never got cool enough, which can be a concern here due to the very hot summers.  It seems other Yelp reviews indicate the same issue regarding poor A/C units.  However, I believe Bellagio has been refreshing the decor in their rooms so maybe these outdated elements and poor A/C units have been (or will be) improved (I think they have moved onto flat screen TVs).

Also included in the stay was access to the fitness center, which was nice.  The pool area was also nice--many different pools and lots of greens, fountains and other scenery if you are just looking to lounge around.

Service was friendly and prompt.

Room rates are high at Bellagio, but there are times of the year where you can find reasonable room rates.  Bellagio has a room rate calendar on their website, which makes for a useful tool to help you pick a time to stay at Bellagio (best room rates are often during the week though and several top Vegas shows are dark and high end restaurants are closed in the early part of the week).

I wished I liked my room more at Bellagio.  I actually liked Caesars Palace more.  I have heard the quality of the room really varies at which tower you stay at Caesars Palace, but the room I had there felt nicer, more elegant and more comfortable than Bellagio.  And even though my first stay at Aria was at a very small room, my second stay there was at a much bigger room and its modern and sleek look felt more upscale than Bellagio.

If you can get a good room rate at Bellagio though, it can be a good hotel choice on The Strip.  It is still a nice hotel and it has a great location--right next to Caesars Palace and The Cosmopolitan, which is a real hot spot right now.  Even if you do not stay at Bellagio, it is a must visit for first time Las Vegas travelers to check out the Fountains of Bellagio, the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens and some of their food (either a more cost friendly option like Jean Philippe or one of their upscale restaurants like the good-for-Vegas Picasso).

Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free valet and self parking.

As they say, "time marches on".

The original POMO was a very special pizzeria, that transported it's diners back to Italy. It was located further south along Scottsdale Road in the Borgata Shopping Center, next to Blanco's. Though small, it had an intimate feel where you could have an easy conversation with you server. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz/pomo-pizzeria-napoletana-scottsdale-2#hrid:DP4ygw0P_5831sjXGX5ecA

The "new" Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria feels like a concept restaurant, sort of like Fox's Olive & Ivy or North, which is not a bad thing. But gone is that old world Italian Grotto elegance and feel. I guess it's only fitting that it's in the former Blooms space. 

Also gone is any mention of POMO's being a certified Napoletana pizzeria, from either APN (Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani) or VPN (Verace Pizza Napoletana). But in truth, the pizzas are still very good and they now have a new, much larger wood fired brick oven. 

The square footage feels three times larger. At times it seems like a dozen or so wait staff are rushing around, delivering pizzas to almost forty tables and that is just inside the restaurant. The outside space is equally large, with a heavy duty tarp covering the diners. I eyed at least two Culinary Managers on the floor keeping track of the staff and food. Nice!
 
The three of us arrived around two o'clock on Black Friday. We were seated pretty quickly, with a good view of the pizza oven. I would highly recommend the location and view. The menu has been updated. And yes it may seem more expensive, given the pricier location near Gainey Ranch and the Hyatt Regency, but it's not. 
http://www.pomopizzeria.com/pomo-scottsdale-menu.pdf. 

I started out by ordering a Cappuccino ($4.00) which was as good as anything I've had at the green mermaid. It had a nice taste but lacked foam. My friends ordered a diet soft drink and a black ice tea, both $2.50. 

Since we remembered how tasty the bruschetta was at the old POMO's we decided to start there. We had the Sorrentina for $7.95 (see photo), which was very good with a hint of garlic. 

Next we decided to share two pizzas. One was their famous Regina Margherita.  It was as tasty and good (though somewhat smaller) as it's predecessor.  I've posted two pictures, a before and after if you will. It was priced at $12.95, same as before.  

The other pizza was their Amatriciana, which comes with saut onions and tiny amount of diced panchetta. It too was very good and priced at $14.95. I believe the key to their delicious tasting pizzas, is the constant and watchful eye as they cook in an over 850 F oven. 

A new addition not found in the old Restaurante, is a grab and go sandwich annex, called "Forno Fabbri, an Italian Market & Mozzarella Bar".  It's to the left as you come into Pomo Cucina and very similar in size and setup to the ones found in Olive and Ivy or the Herb Box. It's a major plus for a quick weekday lunch, one which I will try in the near future. 

Our total for three came to $48.42, including taxes but before gratuities. It seemed fair and the food as I've mention is very good. So Four Stars and yes, we are a Fan of the new Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria. 

Enjoy!

Originally hubby and I were going to try a different place, but it was too packed so I decided to look up what was nearby on the yelp app. I had Fat Boy bookmarked and it was only a couple of blocks from where we tried to eat first, so we headed to Fat Boy.

Walking inside there wasn't much space and there were plenty of customers. There are maybe 4 or 5 tables and we were lucky enough after ordering to snatch one up. The food is made to order and since it was busy we had to wait our turn for our food to come out, but I was patient since it smelled of yummy pizza throughout the place and the vibe inside was awesome.

I asked the man who took our order if the bacon was made fresh since this would alter if I would order it or not. He said that indeed was! I ordered a "BLT Sandwich" priced at just $3.24 for the sandwich by itself, or $6.23 to make it a combo with fries and a drink. I made mine a combo and substituted regular fries for "Chencho Fries" which was a very smart decision. The BLT came out on a burger bun with fresh shredded lettuce, tomato and mayo. I was surprised at the amount of bacon on the sandwich for the price. I was pleased with the flavor of the BLT and would happily order it again with a little extra mayo. You can order the Chencho Fries with skinny or fat fries. The cashier suggested the skinny fries so I went with that and hubby had the fat fries with his. The Chencho Fries have a little bit of chicken with green sauce and cheese. Yum! I loved these fries! Get over here and try these fries! Hubby had a "Pastrami Boyger" and couldn't stop talking about how good the pastrami was so we came back a couple days later for dinner again!

This time hubby went with a full on "Pastrami Sandwich" and loved it. I knew after smelling the pizza a couple days before that I had to give it a try. They have a pick-up only special where you can get a 14" one topping pizza for $5.49 so I was all over that! I ordered a cheese pizza and a side of ranch to dip it in. The owner (turns out this was who took our order the first time) came over to our table and talked to me about the pizza and how he makes the dough from scratch everyday. The pizza was cheesy and the sauce and crust tasted great. I just can't believe how good it tastes for such a great price. I don't live near Fat Boy, but it's worth the drive and I will absolutely be back! 

They offer a good variety of menu options from pizza, boygers, wings, fingers, salads, sandwiches, milkshakes, bottled drinks and fountain drinks. They also offer boyrritos, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas and even serve breakfast! They have different specials and family deals too.

Five of us had dinner at The Carlton last night and it was a wonderful dining experience. 

For appetizers we had: 1 jumbo lump crab cake, 1 beet salad, 1 lobster and crab gnocchi, and 2 house salads. The Jumbo Lump Crab Cake which I ordered, was meaty with crab and was very rich sitting atop of Julianne vegetables. The Dijon Cream and fresh herb sauce it came with was just delicious. The gnocchi was tender and mild which allowed the lobster and crab to predominate the flavor profile. It was served in a Spinach, Caramelized Onions and Tomato-Ketel One Cream base. Very tasty indeed.
Salad eaters, house and beet, all said they were great as well. These were all very good size appetizers so you might save some for taking home if you plan on heavy entrees and tend to fill-up fast.

With the appetizers we also finished off two lemon cream martinis, one sour apple martini and one Grey Goose on the rocks with a twist, and one Arnold Palmer (AP refills aplenty). All drinks were made well. The had a nice martini list, a pretty good wine by the glass list and a full wine list which comes out on an iPad. Pretty cool approach. I am not counting but they say they have over 500 wines on the list. Enough to match any taste or meal. Later for dinner we wanted some rich, creamy full mouth Chardonnay so the proprietor suggested Sonoma-Cutrer for us. This was delicious and great match with our food.

Dinner entrees were hard to choose from the extensive menu which includes some great daily specials which they say usually change every day. Sticking with a theme, I went the seafood route all night and choose the Florida Grouper which was prepared oven roasted and was fresh Parmesan crusted and served with Lobster Pierogies, Spring Vegetables and Roast Garlic Butter. Oh my was this meal ever rich and tender. The Grouper was completely melt in your mouth fresh and tender, and I exaggerate not one bit. The Pierogies were moist, tender and full of lobster stuffing and it went so well with the Grouper. Boy this was a satisfying choice.
 
Three people, were enticed by the 14 oz. medium to medium rare Prime Rib. They all came out looking absolutely beautiful. Jody who is the real Prime Rib  connoisseur said that his ranked up with the best of them. Jody has traveled and lived or visited may cities for extended stays.  He has lived in Las Vegas so he had the opportunity to eat a Lawry's Prime Rib several times. To which I can say when I ate there with him a time or two, and I thought it was the best I ever had. So that puts The Carlton up with the best prime rib places in our judgment.
Linda went for the Ahi Tuna entre, which she said was extremely fresh and tender with the fabulous Tuna flavor one seeks in the best sushi. But it doesn't come naked. It's preparation is fresh Wasabi-Panko crusted with the Ahi Tuna seared rare and served with Curry-Coconut Orzo, Asian Greens, Hearts of Palm-Julienne Carrots and Yuzu Butter. This was a beautiful and tasteful preparation. Had enough to bring home and it served as a special breakfast this morning.

I have to say that everything was really outstanding at The Carlton. Topping it off with some personal service, Kevin Joyce, the owner stopped at our table to see if we were enjoying or meals.  Have to hand it to Kevin, his professional staff, and especially Executive Chef Mark Swomley who has been there for 16 years. The Carlton itself has been around for 27 years which I think is a real testament to its enduring quality and service. You can not go wrong here.

When I was asked to dine at a AAA Five Diamond, Forbes Five Star, Three Michelin Star, Wine Spectator Grand Award and Chef of the Century's restaurant, the question wasn't IF...It was WHEN!

My last night in Vegas marked the unforgettable occasion and as soon as I opened those shiny glass paned double doors, I knew I was in for a treat!  As I walked across the foyer into the main dining room,  I left the hustle and bustle of the frenzied casino behind me and I was instantly transported into a luxurious 1930's style French bistro with a huge crystal chandelier cascading above me. Honestly, this place was dripping with opulence!
Truth be told, I do get a bit uncomfortable in fancy schmancy restaurants.  Perhaps it's the well pressed white table cloths or the half dozen stuffy staff serving my every whim, but this place was not like that at all.  The servers were warm, friendly and present without being overbearing, which was really nice!  Add to that the elegant yet inviting atmosphere and I was feeling like a king! A hungry one at that!    
 
As soon as we were seated and handed our nicely bound menus, I instantly knew in my mind that I wanted to try the 16 course tasting menu.  Heck, you only live once, right? 

Because we were in a festive mood, we decided on a bottle of bubbly and for me, a bottle of Veuve Clicquot fit the bill perfectly!

Then came the famous bread cart in all its glory! Wow! It was a sight to see! There were more than a dozen breads to choose from to start the meal and i think we tried almost all of em!  Three magnificent breads, however, stood out from the pack.  Those being the buttery cheese brioche, savory bacon epi, and chewy cheese baguette.  

Then, of course, came the food! Honestly, it was so beautifully plated there were times I simply felt it was a shame to eat it! But I got over that hurdle fairly quickly. 

Now, I don't plan on boring you with the entire 16 course blow by blow, but I will focus on the dining highlights which made the evening extra special for me!

Amuse Bouche "sangria emulsion" refreshingly light citrusy blood orange cream emulsion above a chilled jam in a whimsical dry ice bowl with small chunks of apples and berry sangria gelee.  Lip smacking tartness with a delightfully smooth & creamy finish! Excellent way to awaken the palate!  

Trio of Caviar 
Caviar with Asparagus - Although not the most interesting pairing of the evening, the flavors of the fresh green asparagus and salty caviar played well against each other. 
Salmon Tartare with Shiso Sprouts and Caviar - The textures were delicate and the flavors were refined.  
Daikon Cous Cous with Caviar - The thin delicate slivers of cool daikon wrapped around fluffy cous cous and topped with caviar was an exhilarating finish to an interesting play on Japanese cuisine.       

Lobster - Topped with fragrant black truffle, the langoustine ravioli was magnificent! The grilled lobster was simple yet beautifully presented. Subtle flavors but hey it's lobster! Sometimes a good thing shouldn't be messed with! The smooth & creamy sea urchin fennel potato puree was inspiring and texturally inviting, as well.

Chestnut Soup over Foie Gras Foam - Rich frothy and flavorful with savory bacon bits. The chunks of roasted chestnuts added a subtle sweetness to this warm and rustic soup. 

Bone marrow - One of my personal favorites! The marrow was luscious, rich and supple in texture. It also exhibited the most irresistible aroma! The popcorn added a pleasant textural dimension to this delightful dish.

Sea bass - Beautifully seared, this magnificent piece of fish came bathing in an irresistible butter sauce. The artichoke balanced the flavor profiles nicely. 

Birthday Cake - As the evening came to a close, the staff came out with a cart embellished with lavish decorative baubles and a small sign that read "Happy Birthday" The accompanying birthday cake was extraordinary! Perched on a large black pedestal, it was absolutely majestic but all I could think of was digging into it!  To my surprise, it was a mango meringue ice cream cake and although we couldn't take it home with us, we did indulge in two large decadent slices and it was fantastic! Bravo to the dessert chef!

If that wasn't enough we were given free reign of the mignardises (dessert cart) that had a vast selection of petit fors, small cookies and yes...macarons!

They boxed up the cookies and gave us an additional box of marshmallow treats to take home with a copy of the menu and a nicely bound colored brochure documenting the magical evening.

I'd have to say this was by far the most amazing dining experience
of my life.  Would i do it again? Someday. 

But for now, I'll just revel in the fine memories of an unforgettable evening that will leave my palate in infinite bliss!

Happy "Birthday" Eats, Part Deux!!

My favorite buffet in VEGAS!!! 

I came here close to when it opened years ago and remembered loving it and finally got a chance to return and i was happy it was still as good as i remember. 

Off the strip, i came here with my family after outlet shopping on a wednesday lunch. We heard about a senior deal for people over 50, but unfortunately THEY ENDED THE SENIOR DEAL. Still, it's a great deal as we only paid $16.00 per person and they have one of the biggest selections and also UNLIMITED WINE AND BEER AND GELATO!!!

PRICES: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=aVc7XXpYbfEx0zQX1169bA

Lunch M-F 10:30-2:30 $16

Seafood Dinner  Fri: 4pm-10pm $34
                               Sat/Sun 2:30-10pm $34

Recommendation: Go for a late breakfast and stay for lunch items, which is plenty of food!

If u want crab legs, don't bother going during the weekday lunches (not sure if they have it during weekday dinners) cuz they dont' have any.

BUT, there's so much stuff! Everything was pretty good except for the sushi, which was terrible that day. Really hard rice! :(
However, i enjoyed DESSERT the best as you can see from my pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=-2R7iQN7p-BTqDGQACzHXA
Creme Brulee, meringue cookies, carrot cake, RV cupcakes, panna cotta, tiramisu, mousse cake, chocolate cake. GELATO of many kinds, tarts,

Others: small selection of chinese food/mediterranean/mexican /indian.mussels, seafood ciopinno, shrimp scampi, baked ziti, BACON, fried shrimp, fried mushrooms, fried chicken, mash, asparagus, sweet potatoes with marshmallows, cream corn and spinach 

Sad to see some of the prices have hiked up since i originally went, but i would definitely recommend this place if ur tired of waiting in huge long lines and paying the same price or more and getting charged extra for drinks. 

Located in the M Resort- that blue building u see off to the right before you get to the strip. A great place to stop on the way home!

Located in Old Town Scottsdale, this gastropub has been one of my favorite restaurants due to their superb ingredients, consistency, originality, and service. The location is easy to miss on the street corner, and strangely I haven't had problems with parking in the amount of times I have been here.

They open in the late afternoon and dim the lights once dinner hours kick in. The interior is underscored by a full bar in the middle surrounded by rows of tables and booths dressed in white tablecloths and small candles. Even though the atmosphere gets loud later in the evenings, the venue is a nice date spot or small gatherings.

For appetizer, their Original Chopped Salad ($12) is a must get. The firm couscous, fresh arugula, corn, aged asiago, and smoked salmon was a delicious combination that gave pop and texture in every bite. I highly recommend it.

Among the entrees, I top two dishes are the Smoked Duck Breast ($28) and Roasted Buttermilk Chicken ($20). The Smoked Duck Breast comes with two thick cuts of duck breast served tender and medium rare. The pieces were very soft to cut into with refined seasonings to go nicely with the sweet potato hash and braised greens. I wished the sweet potato could be a tad sweeter for a change of pace, but the greens were fresh and delicious to couple with the succulent duck. 

Kudos to the chef, I'm not sure how the Buttermilk Chicken came out so tender and full of flavor! It was served with corn-butter bean succotash, roasted Brussels sprouts, truffle oil, and pecorino Romano on top. The thick cut was grilled and impressively moist with a refined buttermilk flavor in the backdrop. It was simplicity mixed with complexity. This is a dish for those who do not like to take risks, but it's also one that will impress both foodies and non-foodies alike. 

The Fair Trade Short Ribs ($30) came with coffee rub, dried cherry BBQ sauce, roasted parsnip puree and seasonal veggies. The ribs lacked a desired smoky flavor, but it was nevertheless complex and cuts at the touch of knife. The ribs were moist, and the tangy and zesty cherry BBQ sauce gave it an added dimension. The parsnip puree round out the flavors to go in-between the meats. 

The Lamb Burger ($13) came with Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion tzatziki, and fries with house-made ketchup. The lamb was tender, super moist, with a detectable seasoning and good lamb flavor. The soft rolls held the burger together nicely, but for a dish this good, the fries could come with a few innovative dipping sauces other than ketchup. 

For dessert, I was not all that impressed with the Choco-Chile Bread Pudding ($10). The chili flavor could be more pointed to add to the scoop of tortilla ice cream and dulce de leche. The quality of the bread pudding was rather stiff, flavorless, and one-dimensional. I wished the bread pudding could have more flavors embedded, so it does not create a distinct separation between dull and rich flavors. Since the bread pudding came highly recommended by the server, I got the sense that dessert is not really their specialty.

Service was very friendly, responsive, attentive, personable and knowledgeable. My meals were always nicely orchestrated, and the servers were extremely knowledgeable about the menu. One time I had a two year old at the dinner table and they were very accommodating with everything he needed. 

However, I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups. I tried to organize a large dinner and the person on the phone was not friendly and required a hefty minimum for drinks. Her requirements were quite unusual since I had organized many other dinner events at other restaurants in the past. Other than that, there's plenty to like about this place. I'd be happy to return to try their Happy Hour menu and other items such as the Grilled Cheese Sandwich and Mac n Cheese.

Thanks to fellow Yelper Kurdy S for finding this place!

After doing some shopping, hubby and I decided on coming here to Jayde Fuzion for dinner. We didn't leave hungry! We were greeted with a warm welcome and our server was fast as we sat at the table to get our drink order. The service was excellent here. Our drinks never went empty and our server answered all of our questions.

The menu is very simple without having a ton of items on it, but it was still hard to decide was to order since it all looked so good. The prices are also very reasonable. We decided to get different items from the menu and just share it. 

Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($8) - These were pretty good. I personally prefer a crunchier lettuce, but it was good. The menu said this dish was spicy however there wasn't any kick to the dish all. The chicken still had good flavor and it is worth the price. It came with 3 lettuce cups and when I asked our server for more it was no problem.

Cashew Chicken ($15) - My favorite dish of them all! It was a great portion of chicken and put over white rice it was perfect. There were plenty of cashews and this is a dish I would probably order every time. 

Gochujang Pork ($15) - Apples are in this dish, but I didn't taste them. That's OK because whatever flavor it did give the pork, I loved! I will say that this was also supposed to be a spicy dish and there was again no kick at all. It's sort of frustrating when a dish says it will be spicy and it isn't, but it did have great flavor and I would eat it again. As with the other dishes it was a decent portion. 

Honey Walnut Shrimp ($18) - I don't eat seafood. I didn't try these! The menu says it was supposed to have a creamy mayo sauce, but hubby said the shrimp tasted more like a really sweet orange and wouldn't order them again. I thought they were presented well and nicely sized. 

Yuzu Doughnuts ($7) - These are yummy! The doughnuts are very light and not greasy at all. The doughnuts were filled with tasty yuzu glaze and more glaze with pistachios were on top. The refreshing citrus flavor and light texture of the doughnuts made for a nice dessert. 

They didn't open until 5 pm (when we happened to arrive) and people were already waiting to get in. You might want to call ahead and make a reservation. And come hungry! There is also a sushi bar.

I attempted Cafe Zupas on opening day and the line was so long out the door that I decided to wait. It was worth it! Cafe Zupas is kind of like Panera Bread, serving sandwiches, soups, salads and bakery stuff. The only thing different is Cafe Zupas is much fresher and tastier! 

When you first walk in they have large easy to read menu boards. You place your order telling them what you want on what, pay for your food and find a table where your food is brought out to you. They have a pretty good amount of seating offering tables as well booths. 

Sandwiches by themselves are $4.99 each, salads by themselves are $4.99 for the half size and $6.99 for the large size, soups are $3.99 for the half size and $5.99 for the large size.

There is a  "Try 2 Combo" priced at $7.99 where you can pick from two of the following:
- Whole Sandwich
- Half Soup
- Half Salad 

I ordered the "Honey Bacon Club" and "Summer Chicken Salad" from the try 2 combo. The portion size was great. The honey bacon club is a grilled panini with turkey, ham, bacon, tomatoes, muenster cheese and honey mustard. So good! I will order this one again for sure. The summer chicken salad has chicken, fresh strawberries, cashews, dried cranberries, grapes, mixed greens and strawberry vinaigrette dressing. The salad tasted to fresh and yummy! They have over a dozen salads to choose from so there is a nice variety to choose from each time. A really nice touch was the chocolate covered strawberry that came complimentary with my meal! Hubby got one with his too! Hubby ordered a "Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup" that was put of this world delicious! I ended up getting a spoon and sharing it with him it was just so good. The soup is whole heads of cauliflower blended together with cheddar and pepper jack cheese. Bacon was added for an additional 59 cents. Fresh bread also comes with the meal so it was nice to dip in the soup!

So I saw a dessert in the case that called my name. It was the "Sinful 7 Chocolate Cake" priced at $4.49 and I got it to-go. This cake is any true chocolate lovers dream come true! It lives up to it's name and is sinfully good.

The drink bar offers 16 different fountain drinks with free Italian Soda flavorings. If you have a device that needs some juice then you can take advantage if the recharge bar. They do offer catering, but if they offer online ordering I didn't see anything about it. There is a sign that says they do not take tips, but will gladly clean up your dishes (yep they use real dishes) and table when you are finished. The customer service was fantastic and the inside was very clean. I will be back!

As i rubbed my overstuffed belly, dude said it's ok if i want to unbutton. I told him i unbuttoned already about 30 min ago!

Wowee, i think i consumed more food here that i did at the buffets. 
I brought my relatives here to treat them to a nice steak dinner, without breaking the bank. 
For restaurant week, they were doing a great deal (which is pretty much half of their power couple meal). For $50, you get a 3 course meal. Most of our table ordered that, while my dude and uncle just got their manly bone in Rib Eyes. The deal came with a Petit Filet and crabcake, along with salad and dessert. But ur allowed to tweak your meal and don't necessarily have to stick with the written options- a few items, u have to pay extra for. 
You start off with huge sesame seed bread served with butter. Not the best bread steak house bread i've had, but it was soft and yummy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=0BlIFseV-5Hd16I-PcRrXQ 

My Del's salad was awesome!. Mainly cuz it came with two huge pieces of delicious thick but crisp bacon on top!!! I got mine with an avocado dressing which was so good! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=Gl37AEprIq227kFoigLohw

The petit Filet was pretty filling and cooked nicely med rare.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=fNMin5UVASwyyFBm_eMUlg
The bone in Rib Eye was good as well, dude loved it as he's had it before. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=HyA9h7GFL35u0YrUgi3uvg  It was good, but i felt it lacked that buttery char that i love on my rib eye. Mastros i say still does a better Bone In Rib eye. 

For sides, the staff comes around and spoons out the sides you ordered, which come in large portions that u could share them. 
I tried the spinach (creamy with bacon!), and mushrooms were ok. 
The baked potato looked good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=_fxRw3wX86gejNGyy2rAWg

The crabcakes were pretty good. 
My uncle got the Salmon and said that the Tchoupitoulas sauce it came with was delicious and light. 
My aunt got the seared tuna steak- which was good but not great. She enjoyed the crab cake more. 

We all let out some gasps when we saw the humongous desserts!
We were too stuffed but couldn't resist the yummy looking desserts. 
The bread pudding was the best-  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=J4y4JWu2Kzjwv4Q_Ein0cQ
Strawberry cheesecake was huge and very cream cheesy than sweet 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=NiuW7t29bUx5BSZYH-8DKw
Chocolate mousse was delicious. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=PU3xnSpdx9YjuOQpNiNikQ
One dessert, i think is big enough to share between 3 people, esp after having a huge dinner already. 

Service was outstanding. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and took his time explaining everything and made us all feel very comfortable. We saw atleast 10 different wait staff come to our table, either refilling our drinks (even after one sip!) or bringing out our dishes. 

I signed up for their rewards card which racks you up points for dollars spent for gift cards. They charge u an initial fee of $25.00 which they reinburse you in the form of a giftcard for later. You can also sign up online before going there, so you can use it on your first visit. Be sure to let them know of any b-days, as u will get a comped dessert!

I had my hopes up for this place. Walking in it seemed like a fun atmosphere, but quickly it felt like more of a tourist attraction. From the start our server was trying to get us to buy raffle tickets. It didn't stop there. When she would check on us, she was saying things like "if you like the taste of that, we sell it in our gift shop" and at the end of the meal even asked if she could walk with us to the gift shop (we told her that we didn't want to go earlier and thanked her for the info) to pick somethings out so she could meet her goal since she was in the lead for some sort of competition with the other employees for work. To put people on the spot so many times is rude. Ask once and if the customer is interested they will tell you! 

What encouraged us to come here was because I have family here in town that is hosting an exchange student from Germany and I thought she would not only like this place, but maybe feel a bit of home. We sat at nice long table that is shared with the other customers. I don't personally like that, but that's the theme here so it was fine. There was live music being played which was cool. 

Priced at $19.99 we started out with the "Sausage Tower" at the suggestion of our server. She said it was a "hidden" menu item since it isn't on the menu and it would give us a good taste of the different sausages they have. Sounded good to me! When it arrived, it looked like a tower of heaven. There were 3 dishes. 1 dish had chicken bratwurst, pork sausage and veal bratwurst on a bed of sauerkraut. The 2nd dish had krainer, grilled weisswurst and a frankfurter with potato salad. The 3rd dish had 2 fresh baked pretzels with 2 types of dipping sauces. Of all the sausages I only really liked the taste of a couple of them, so it was nice to be able to sample it all instead of just ordering a certain sausage dish that I might have had a type of sausage in it that I wasn't to find of. The pretzels were pretty good and the mustard sauces had good flavor. For my meal I had priced at $4.95 a "House Salad" and priced at $14.95 the "Grillhendl" which is a chicken dish. The salad was average, but the chicken dish was above average. The chicken was roasted and stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions. The chicken was crispy and had a good flavor. It also came with a side of potato salad that was decent. 

I certainly didn't leave hungry! I didn't leave feeling like I would come back though either. The vibe inside just screamed "gimmick" and "tourist attraction here" which our guest from Germany agreed. The server was just too pushy about trying to get us to buy different things. My husbands meal was a joke especially for the price, so I lucked out with the chicken dish I ordered. I'm glad I experienced Hofbruhaus at least once.

Fine Dining while watching the open kitchen here was one of my favorite dining experiences in Vegas. We had made reservations for the L'Unique menu which was designed for people who wanted a complete meal but had limited dining time (such as before a show). For $59.00, we got to enjoy a fantastic meal of an app, entree and dessert- all served within about 15 minutes. 
Started with a bread basket that i'm sure would make Anthony N's bread basket notes. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=wcB4tCCHDP-MVZgumBWRIw It was served with 3 kinds: baguettes, country rolls and croissant rolls. The croissant was my favorite. They give u generous pads of butter and will give u extra bread- so eat up! You will be hard pressed to find better bread baskets. 
For the L'unique menu, we got to choose from two different items for each part of the meal. Between the bf and i, we got to try all of them. 
My dish: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=WtpRh5soYH-ievHYOznn7g
Everything was beautiful and tasted amazing. They gave a pretty good amount of lobster with the sole and the sauces and vegetables were perfect. The salmon and tuna tartare was yum and tasted very fresh. The dessert was light and delicious and so very pretty :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=_t-FoXFZtmghxSyON9UZzg
Dude had the flank steak (cooked perfectly) with buttery mash potatoes, asparagus and the lemony berry dessert. Dude dislikes veggies, but he loved every bite of his meal.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=IDFSuLaOxP67CEmLH10DuA
The best part of this experience is watching the chefs making these beautiful dishes. Every chef had their special tasks in making each dish complete to perfection. We even saw a chef using tweezers to carefully place pieces together of a salad. Although the chefs and servers move swiftly to try to complete your meal in the promised 15 minutes, you never feel rushed or see anything done hastily. Our waiter checked on us just enough times to make sure everything was great and took the time to make conversation as well and answer any questions we had. 

Dude is a notoriously slow eater, and i had surprise tickets for him to see the Jabbawockeez after dinner. While he was busy taking photos of the decor and watching the chefs- i was afraid we were never gonna get to the show in time at the rate he was going, not even having touched his bread yet. But as dinner was served- to see his reaction to finally finding a vegas hotel restaurant that he truly enjoyed (he always complains they r never great)- from him watching the chefs, to enjoying every morsel on his plate, was well worth the price and nervousness!!!

SCAM!

Yes, that's right... I said "SCAM!"

The Spearmint Rhino has always been a place that's come up as one of the top strip clubs in Vegas. Of course I had to go check it out while in Vegas this weekend with my friend. 

First off, we knew about the free limo thing, but weren't able to work that one out. We ended up taking a cab and also paying the steep cover to get in. On the surface, this joint made a decent first impression. A bevy of beautiful girls. You couldn't really go too wrong here looks-wise. Girls here are so consistently good looking, you would think you walked on to a strip club movie set. 

It didn't take long though before we started to see the cracks in the foundation here... and they run deep.

Before we could even take it all in, I get accosted and molested by this tall blond Eastern European girl who tried dragging me back to VIP. I had to say "no" half a dozen times and yank my arm away from her before she took the hint. 

She kept touching my dick through my pants while trying to pull me to the VIP lounge talking about 200 dollars and how I didn't want to sit at a table because it's no fun there. Well, maybe I like sitting in the main room having drinks and talking to people. Maybe I don't want to go have a private dance with a complete stranger. 

That shit is awkward. I would like to get to know someone a little bit first. What if I find out your personality is shit and then I'm stuck in the VIP room with some hot asshole and 200 bucks lighter? Plus, I don't really want some stranger touching my dick instead of a handshake... I suppose I'm weird that way. 

My friend and I walked around the club a few times looking for a seat. They let too many people in here. Absurdly too many. I was told to go talk to a guy up at the front if I wanted a seat. He put my name on his list and said he would try to find me something and to just keep checking back with him. I wandered around some more and had 3 more girls come up to me and touch my dick and try to drag me off to the back room. It got quite annoying rather quickly. Let me fucking sit down for 5 minutes. 

My friend and I decided to just sit at one of the two bars and have a drink while we wait. Another girl comes up to us and guilts me into buying her a drink. I hate that. I don't buy girls drinks at bars. I buy my date drinks. I buy my friends drinks. I don't buy strangers drinks because they are pretty... or in their bra and panties for that matter. 

She did turn out to be useful though because she informed me that if I don't give the guy at the door 100 bucks, I won't get a seat ever. She was kind enough to walk around the place with us looking for open seats. We ended up lucking out by asking a guy if we could sit at his table with him. It was a great spot too. Things were turning around for us. 

Then my friend asked the girl who ushered us around the club if he could buy our new friend a dance for sharing his table with us, and she said she didn't do $20 dances - she only did VIP. We all immediately lost interest in her and sent her away. That kind of attitude was just a buzzkill. 

This became the standard pretty much - it seemed that most girls there refused to give you a $20 dance on the floor, but would only go back to VIP. I don't want to go to VIP - it's creepy. I don't want to get any more intimate than just the standard lapdance. Looking around, we noticed very few dances on the floor going on - just a long-ass line to the VIP area. 

I even had one filthy blond scam artist liar tell me she was under contract and couldn't do $20 dances. She kept coming up to me throughout the night trying to drag me off to VIP. I kept saying I didn't want to go and she kept insisting. I felt like I was trying to wander off a used car lot and a sleazy salesman in a bra and panties wasn't letting me leave. 

I had a Larry David moment with this girl. She finally guilted me into going back to the room. She insists I give her the money first - her counting it took up the first song. Then she started doing the worst half-assed standard boring soulless yawn-inducing lapdance without going anywhere near my lap. I stopped her after about 30 seconds and told her I felt swindled and cheated. I wanted to leave and get my money back. 

Long story short - It became a big embarrassing ordeal for everyone, but the manager ended up giving me 40 bucks back. It was the principle of the thing for me at this point. We promptly left after this.

Spearmint Rhino has attractive girls, and some of them were actually nice. It's possible to have a good time. However, most girls here seem to only do the VIP room and scam you out of your cash. Drinks are overpriced, it's too dark inside, and they pack it so full it's standing room only. 

Arizona clubs give better dances for half the price, the girls don't act like they're too good for the job, and they let you get to know them a bit before you decide you want to go to the VIP lounge with them.

Michelin Stars #38-39

Oh Vegas, such a perfect town for indulgence and gluttony. Guy Savoy (not pronounced how you'd think) was chosen as a nice special dinner for my wife and myself, for no reason other than to live it up. 

Being an old married couple and knowing dinner could be 3+ hours, we took the earliest reservation at 6pm. The space was grand and empty upon arrival and we were seated with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains to the south. The mostly white decor was only interrupted but the occasional ultra-bright piece of "art," all of which I loved. After a quick glance at the menu, the only option worth considering was the full Innovation menu with a shared wine pairing. And now on to the show!

1. Foie and Toast Amuse: 
What's not to love about foie anything, truffles, and some crisp bread to add some texture. A perfect way to say hello while having your ear licked with taste.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#q-5nZctMRztBoHuzI-9IiA

2. Waffle and Parmesan Amuse: 
Kind of a weird one but god damn if that wasn't one of the best bites of waffle I've ever had. Another wow bite. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#k-HfOiDwUHjQDk2yS_A-Ug

3. The Bread Cart: 
Dude, they make this every single morning. I guess it's less impressive when you consider the small army of people in the bowels of these hotels that are there 24/7 doing everything. But somewhere down there is someone making over a dozen different types of artisanal bread just for Guy Savoy. We tried over half the selection over the course of dinner and they were all amazing and better.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#CeIpoN0mqYabwMCCuRhM2A

4. Tomato Amuse:
And the "ooos" and "aaahhs" just kept coming from us with this one. They must have made five or six different types of intricate tomato preparations just to combine into something that took two bites. Every area of tomato flavor was highlighted, from the sweet to the vinegar, and it was masterfully finished with a nibble of a tomato chip.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#kgqj-Czz4DtXuRe4HMI7wg

5. "Concass" of Oysters:
Concasse is the French culinary word for crushed or ground up. Here it was a dish of oyster pieces topped with seaweed and an amazing lemon granite. Bite after bite was amazing, we couldn't get over how perfectly well the chopped oysters worked with the crunchy lemon ice. It was everything you could ever want from an oyster dish. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#gVFhIUDM1qU2dkxH3XxtsA

6. Langoustine in Cold Steam:
At this point we were sure they couldn't keep up with this level of amazing food, but they did and did so with one of the more over the top presentations I've seen;

Click play - http://instagram.com/p/dsw_tpTRCa/

Basically what you have here are two preparations of langoustine on a perforated plate, over a bowl of dry ice, that then has a nori broth poured into it creating the "steam" effect. What it really did do was to add a lovely and visible aroma to the place of amazingly delicate langoustine sashimi. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#HVKWHN7wRaciqzmZzUiHFw

7.  Asparagus, Caviar and "Fresh" Cheese:
The title of the dish pretty much gives it away. Though again, the presentation was beautiful, the flavors all wowed, and the cheese foam was closer to a meringue in texture. But hot damn, that was some damn fine caviar. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#5ubR8rXxh6w0WRwNHKzo2Q

8. Salmon Iceberg:
This is the first time I've ever had a chef "cook" something tableside on a block of dry ice;

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#71j9M9W4E8w5KRyMX73O9w

Served by head chef Mathieu Chartron, he graciously rattled off the thinking behind this unique preparation as he plated our ice cold salmon and proceeded to top it off with a very hot broth. The resulting hot/cold mixture was divine. Hard to say for certain if the dry ice treatment really did much, but it was very fun and ended in more oooos and aaahhs from us. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#wGN_mNDWyRB53ISlRUzaqg

9. Lobster:
I really need the before pic to show how this one played out. Basically a nice piece of lobster was presented with a few cylinder shaped veggies on the parameter. Then the servers went on to unwarp each of the veggie rolls and layer them atop the lobster, then topped it all with a wonderful smoked butter sabayon sauce. The result wasn't as pretty as the start, but the flavor combination worked its magic once again on us.

My hubby has a birthday coming up and he wants Texas de Brazil for his special dinner. Since we had been to TDB before, and not tried Via Brasil even though it is in our area, I figured we could give it a shot. I did have an A-OK experience, but I am glad it wasn't his actual birthday dinner or I would have been disappointed we didn't go to TDB. 

The "Rodizio" dinner is priced at $45.99 per person. A 50 plus item salad bar is included, and you get to try 18 different meats that meat carvers bring to your table on skewers. You can choose if you want what they have and how much. If pink meat isn't your thing, you can request any of the meat be cooked to to your liking. They give each person there own round paper disc that you turn to green when you are ready for more meat and then you turn it to red until you are ready for more or are simply done eating. I was impressed by the fact that the side dishes were included with the meal. They had like 16 to choose from and you can pick as many as you like. That is a nice touch! They ask that you tell them your sides when you first get there so they can start preparing them. 

So I am not a vegetarian at all, but I don't eat a whole lot of meat. Tonight was my night to shine as the carnivore I am not. I absolutely succeeded! I first went to the salad bar. I wasn't impressed. There were a lot a seafood options which is great, but not for someone like me who doesn't eat seafood. I didn't feel there was a lot of options for a salad however the veggies they did offer were fresh and delicious. I put some "Caprese Salad" on my plate and that was actually very good. As we finished up our salad, the sides we ordered arrived. The "White Rice" paired nicely with the "Sauteed Mushrooms" and the "Fried Banana" was good. Then the meats started coming! I have to admit that the "Top Sirloin" known as "Pichana" that they claim is the star of the meal was not good at all. The meat was tough and flavorless. The "NY Strip", and "Prime Rib" were the same, tough meat and flavorless. Then came the "Bacon Wrapped Turkey" and THAT is delicious. I'm a huge fan of bacon and the bacon really added a nice flavor to the turkey. Then came the "Garlic Filet and "Bacon Wrapped Filet and these two are the star of the meal to me. The filet was so tender and flavorful. I like my meat cooked well done so the server took note of that and made sure to bring me pieces with no pink. I liked my meal, but can't see coming back and paying full price again. Maybe if it were a deal they had going on or something. The meat at first was not good, and the salad bar was not great. I know this isn't TDB, but I do have to compare it because they both have the "churrascaria" thing going on. And the salad bar at TDB is worth just eating that alone. The sides were decent, but I only enjoyed a few types of the meat so I'd rather spend the extra to have TDB. 

There is a Happy Hour here at Via Brasil Monday - Sunday from 5-8 pm in the patio/bar. Every Sunday they have a "Sunday Brunch" from 10 am - 2 pm and have different specials for the brunch so you might want to call and ask if there is a theme for that day. They have several options for events and banquets too.

Amlee Chinese Cuisine is a local family run business. They have been in business for over 30 years. I remember eating here when I was a teenager and really enjoying the food and lunch specials at Amlee Chinese Cuisine. After going to the movies at nearby Galaxy last week we passed by here so, I suggested to hubby that we come back and try this place and see if it was still as good as I remembered. With a fellow yelper in tow we headed for dinner here last night and wasn't disappointed. 4.5 stars!

Walking in we were greeted and taken to our seats. Water and menus were brought right to our table right away. We shared "family style" and picked out somethings we all like. Food is brought out on a cart and served to you. 

Fried Wontons ($5.95) - These came 12 per order and I liked them. Light, yet crunchy with a small bit of chicken in the center. It came with a sweet and sour and spicy mustard dipping sauces. 

Szechuan Chicken Salad ($10.95) - Yum! The salad was tossed in front of us. The portion was huge and there was plenty to go around. I really liked the flavor of the dressing best and the fresh carrots stood out.

Vegetable Fried Rice ($8.95) - I felt there could have been a little more flavor in this dish. The size was perfect especially if sharing, but the carrot and peas didn't really stand out flavor-wise. The rice was cooked just right though.

Szechuan Beef ($16.95) - So good! The beef was so tender and the whole dish together just tasted great. The huge fresh mushrooms were tasty.

Orange slices were brought to each of us at the end of the meal. I felt the charge of $3.95 for a soda was steep. Free refills, but almost the price of an appetizer. The service was great and we left full and pleased! The owner stopped to talk to us for a moment and she's genuinely passionate about the type of food they are putting out as well the type of service they provide.

They offer delivery so call to check the areas they cover. You can also place your order for pick-up if you don't want to dine inside. They have lunch specials that range in price from $7.95, $8.95, $9.95 and $10.95 depending on what you order and it includes soup, egg roll and choice of steamed or egg fried rice.

SHUT IT DOWN!

I was incredibly disappointed when we went to grab dinner here last night. Chef Ramsey would have been so upset at the lack of customer respect. It was like they really didn't care. And I found this unacceptable. 

The hostess took us to our table which was a very cool table but it was not very comfortable for our group to have dinner at. It was so low, that there was no way we could even eat or cut our meat. If we were just drinking then we would have hung out here all night. I asked the hostess for a booth, which was right next to the original table. 

She told me that the 4 empty booths were reserved and we couldn't sit there. I asked the hostess how embarrassed would she be if we sat at the uncomfortable table and no one showed up for those 4 booths in the next hour.  She ignored me and didn't respond. 

She then told me that this was the only table we could have. The sad part is that 60% of the tables were empty and she refused to seat us anywhere else.  I told her I wanted to speak to the manager. She went back to the hostesses station told the other girl and the second hostess rolled her eyes. Honestly I'm the customer.  I don't need to see that. The hostess made a phone call to the manager, who never picked up his phone.  She then went in the back and when she came back she gave us one of the booths we had requested. Wow! What changed?

First, why did it take me 10 minutes to get a booth in a restaurant that was only 40% full. Secondly, I asked to speak to the manager and the manager never came out. Why? Completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Really where is the manager and why didn't he come over to talk to us. 

On a side note: At 10:22pm, we were seated and at 12:19am the booths were still empty.  In fact, nobody ever sat in any of those booths for almost 2 hours. It became apparent that the hostess completely lied to us by telling us they were reserved. Who is training the staff to act like this?

Plus we sat at our table with no service for about 10 minutes. I believe the hostesses probably thought it was funny to send no one over.  We all discussed leaving but decided to stay. 

At 11:52pm all of the lights went full blast, during our meal. It was so bright it hurt our eyes. I spoke to the guy cleaning the tables and he went to speak to the manager and the lights went back down after 5 minutes.  We were just trying to finish our dinner. He came back and said, "the manager had no idea who turned all the lights on!" I think the manager might need a visit from GR and he may have his lights turned on. The waitress told us the lights go full blast every night at that time. I think it must be on a timer, like last call for alcohol. But it should not blast all the lights in the dinning areas. It was not a fun feeling as we ate our dinners. 

My first drink didn't look like the picture in the iPad menu. And I was told by the waitress that the drinks never look like the photos in the iPad. Then why do we have photos of the drinks in the iPad? Again this is wrong and not right. GR would be screaming at someone. 

I went to order another drink at 12:00am but was informed that the bar was closed. I said really and why didn't someone tell us it was last call. There was no response. I told the waitress that I was just having a wheat beer and it shouldn't be a problem to pour a pint. All the bartenders were still there. She went to ask and came back with my pint but I noticed that the Orange slice was missing and about an inch of beer was also missing.  I asked where was the orange slice (this beer is suppose to come with it) and I was told that it was wrapped in Saran Wrap and put away. I asked her to grab me a slice and she said that it wouldn't be possible. Why is this dinner so painful?

I'm so mad that I haven't even got to reviewing the food yet.  The best thing we had here was the fingerling potatoes. It was a side dish but it was the star of the show. My buddy was not happy with his lamb. It was covered in a cheese and he felt it was over powering. I liked my PEI mussels and clams but didn't love them. They came with chorizo, carmelized fennel and lemon zest. I've had better mussel dishes elsewhere. I will say that the shellfish was fresh and only two clams had some sand in them. 

Would I come back here again? Probably never! So you're saying there's a chance? I would only probably ever eat here if Chef Ramsey was actually here running it. This place needs to be on one of those Restaurant Rescue Food shows and its only been open 4 months. I was also informed by the staff that GR had only been there 5 times in the last 4 months, since this location opened. If that is true then, he really needs to spend some time here fixing the many issues. I think the loser of Hell's Kitchen might be running this place?

I let my love of GR influence my choice to stay! Next time I will follow my brain and not my heart. We should have all walked.

I purchased a yelp deal ($12 for $20) a while ago and attempted to eat here close to a month ago, but the power was out so the girl who was inside said she wouldn't be able to serve us since they had no power to cook with. Bummed since I had this place on my radar due to all of the positive yelp reviews and the the food sounded good, I understood and figured we'd just come back another time. Fast forward to a few days ago when hubby and I decided to give this place a try again. This time the power was on yay! Walking in it is confusing because there is no sign saying to seat your self or to wait to be seated. After standing there for a few minutes and seeing no employees I decided we would just seat ourselves. There were already a couple other filled tables, so I figured the employees might have been taking care of their orders in the back and it turns out there was just one girl working the whole floor and one cook in the back. Once she noticed we were there she did check on us often and was very friendly. Inside has mostly purple walls and bright red booths. It's obvious they are going for a Mardi Gras theme, but it could have been done better. Most of the decor has signs on it that say "for sale" since they are closing at this location.

I ordered what was probably the most simple thing on the menu, but it was what sounded good. Priced at $6.95 (regular size) I ordered the "Royal Street" and priced at $2.95 the "Bananas Fosters Rue Royal" for dessert. 

My sandwich came with a side of Cajun Fries and Coleslaw. The coleslaw was crunchy and had just the right amount of dressing tossed in it so it wasn't dry or soggy. The problem with the coleslaw though was it had absolutely no flavor at all and after three bites I put it aside. I was surprised at the side of fries since the menu said it came with a side of "Cajun Chips" and after seeing the pictures on yelp, I was really looking forward to trying them. Now let me get to the fries. The fries were absolutely perfect! The fries were cooked just right and whatever seasoning they put on them tasted really great. I wished I had no coleslaw and all fries. I don't know what the Cajun Chips tasted like, but i'm sure the Cajun Fries I had made up for it. 

The sandwiches come in regular and large sizes. The Royal Street is a grilled cheese with tomato sandwich. If you want your sandwich "dressed" you will get the addition of lettuce, tomatoes, mayo and pickles. Since I ordered a grilled cheese I wondered how that would turn out, but our server said it was one of her favorite sandwiches on the menu and it is really good with the additions, so I went for it. I have to first say that I really did enjoy my sandwich and would totally eat it again. Now let me say that the sandwich just wasn't what the menu described. There was nothing grilled about it. The bread was extremely good. I mean the bread was so soft and tasty and still held the fillings in nicely. I did order a grilled cheese though and the bread had no grill marks and there was nothing crunchy about the bread. The kids menu even mentions that if your kids have a hard time eating crunchy bread to let them know, but a kid would have no problem eating the bread on the sandwich I had. I also kept hearing the microwave going off and the door opening and closing and when hubby asked me how they got the cheese on both pieces of bread melted if they didn't grill it, the whole noise of the microwave came to my mind. I don't know that's what they did, but the sandwich wasn't at all a grilled cheese. 

When I ordered the Bananas Fosters Rue Royal for dessert and I heard our server tell the cook the order, I heard the microwave start up again. I think they were heating up the bananas maybe. This was a decent dessert. I wish there was more bananas it it, but hubby and I both enjoyed sharing it and there was a nice big scoop of ice cream in it that was perfect for sharing. 

I asked our server about the chips/fries switch up and she said that they signed a 6 year lease, but wont be able to stay at the location they are in because the whole building will be coming down with the expansion of the freeway. She said that the owner is unfortunately going through some health problems right now and between that and moving locations (if they can find one she says) some of the menu isn't available right now. If you are craving alligator or Cajun chips you are out of luck. They wont be serving them and some other items until they figure out where and if they are moving. The girl was very nice and like I said I did like my food aside from the coleslaw, but it would have been better for the server to let us and every customer know what is and isn't available on the menu so they aren't disappointed when they get something else on their plate or have to pick something else to eat and look over the menu again. I hope they do find another location and work out the kinks because I'd try them again in the future.

I came to Fogo during Restaurant Week 2013. After trying to make a reservation the first weekend of restaurant week, I was denied because they were already booked. Since this was going to be one of my birthday meals, hubby said to call back and ask for something towards the end of the week so he could take the day off for it. I called back asked about Friday, August 30th (last day of restaurant week) and the woman on the phone said 2 pm was available so I reserved the spot. When we arrived on the 30th the parking lot seemed dead. For a place that was booked the weekend before, why did it seem nobody was here? I soon got my answer on the front door. They stop serving lunch at 2 pm and pick dinner back up at 5 pm. Fogo called as well e-mailed me conforming the reservation, so I was baffled. 

Entering Fogo we were greeted and taken to our table. We sat for a few minutes and then our drink order was taken. I then headed to the salad bar where I was surprised at how some stuff looked very fresh and other stuff looked like it had been sitting there untouched for a while. There was food scattered about along the salad bar and the ranch dressing had a ladle from another dressing inside of it and the ranch ladle was just laying on the counter. I avoided having ranch (my fav) on my salad because there was just too much of a mixture of who knows what inside of it. I went with a few things that looked fresh like tomato, mozzarella, croutons, parmesan and the basil dressing I put on it was delicious. 

I wasn't able to have anymore salad, but will explain about that later. So, the meats started coming. The servers were nice, but I don't know if they understood us or what. I told them what type of meat I would like and they would bring something else. They asked how I liked my filet and I said closer to well-done and I get brought a piece of raw red meat. The meat was seriously hit or miss. Some pieces were either very flavorful and tender while others were too raw or nothing but grizzle. The best thing here isn't the beef, but the sausage and bacon wrapped chicken. They do cook those 2 things right and the bacon wrapped chicken might just be the best I have ever eaten. Included with the meal were sides. The 'Mashed Potatoes" were just average. The "Cheese Bread" was dry and disgusting. The cheese bread tasted like a old biscuit. The "Carmalized Bananas" were actually very good, but the "Crispy Polenta" wasn't for me. I don't know if this experience was due to the time of our reservation or not. I wouldn't have even picked the time if it weren't suggested to me by Fogo. 

Then dessert came. Fogo claims the "Papaya Cream" is their most requested dessert. Most requested by who?? Sure it looks pretty upon presentation, but this dessert had zero flavor. I could have opened a jar of baby food (the dessert was that consistency) and tasted more flavor. Everyone at my table left their dessert unfinished. 

Too bad I didn't try more from the salad bar before we got cut off. The server came to our table and said that the salad bar was going to be closing so the employees could eat. WTH?!?!?!?!?!?!? The RW menu price was $30.13 and included an all you can eat salad bar, endless meats and a dessert. By this time we had only been seated maybe 20 minutes and were the only customers. I felt like we were the ones intruding on the employees eating since it was several of them at the salad bar and sitting at the tables near us. I first must that I think it is a great perk that the employees get to eat a free meal. They work hard and if the food is going to waste anyway then why not let them enjoy it too. I just don't understand why paying customers get cut off so they can have that perk. Dinner didn't start until 5 pm and it wasn't even 2:30 so these employees could have let us enjoy our meal and then stuff their faces. I contacted Fogo about this and got a call back from Whitney, who said they do let the employees eat, but they should have waited until we were finished. Whitney never once said she was sorry on behalf of Fogo and never returned the promised phone call the following day. Just because the small salad I was allowed to eat tasted good and the bacon wrapped chicken was to die for, doesn't mean everything else was acceptable. I would much rather give my money to Texas de Brazil.
