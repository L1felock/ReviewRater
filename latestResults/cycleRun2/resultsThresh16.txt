Was essen Syrer respektive was erwartet mich in einem syrischen Restaurant? 

Mit diesen Fragen betraten wir das Alibaba und bevor wir auch nur einen Bissen gekostet zu haben, weiss ich nun, dass das syrische Essen hier beliebt ist. Doppelt gebucht sind am Wochenende die Tische, so dass wer ohne Reservierung aufschlgt, erstmal keine Chance hat. Dass wir doch noch zu zwei Tellern fanden lag an unserer Hartnckigkeit, daran dass die Mdels mglich machten, was irgend mglich war und sicherlich auch darin begrndet, das wir bereits um 19 Uhr aufschlugen.

So fanden wir nicht nut einen Platz, um uns rum war es sogar ziemlich leer und wir konnten uns in Ruhe   dem Alibabataller (Kufta mit 5 Vorspeisen) sowie der Grillvariation widmen. Dazu kommt Brot und wir hatten noch eine zustzliche Vorspeise - wer bin ich, dass ich Hummus widerstnde!
Extrawnsche in Sachen no bread, no milk waren kein Problem, die Speisen, die dann kamen waren interessant gewrzt, leicht suerlich mitunter, nussig und mit gutem l angereichert.

Cafes sind ja eine Kategorie fr sich.

Es gibt die gemtlichen und die schnieken, die mit eigener Konditorei und die die eher auf Kleinigkeiten setzen. In manchen gibt es sogar selbstgemachte Pralinen.  Und Omas am Nebentisch. Andere wiederum sind eher mit WLAN ausgestattet und bieten im Home Office arbeitenden eine nette Abwechslung.

Das Cafe Jck ist eine fr sich. Der Kuchen in der Vitrine sieht verboten gut aus, gleiches gilt fr die Pralinen und Kleingebcke. Das Interieur quietscht dagegen zwischen allen Stilen. Gemtlichkeit will nicht so recht aufkommen, aber dafr fhlen sich hier unterschiedlichste Menschen willkommen und schaffen gemeinsam eine Atmosphre des aus der Zeit gefallenen Oase fr diese Momente, fr die noch kein Ort geschaffen.

Mein ortskundiger Begleiter tat gut daran, mich hierher zu fhren und sorgte fr seine Bestellung "eine heisse Schokolade 66" fr mein Erstaunen - ja, hier kann man seinen Kakao in Prozent bestellen von milchschokoladig bis dunkelzart. Fr Leute wie mich, die der Milch und dem Gluten fernbleiben drfen fand sich auf Nachfrage in der Vitrine ein Florentiner. Der war eher unspektakulr und ich beneidete die Begleiter um ihren saftigen Himbeerkuchen.

Der Service - well, der Service wre das Argument, das fr mich gegen einen Besuch spricht: Muffelig und alles andere als den prallen Ssswaren gerecht werdend, wurden wir begrsst, bedient und abkassiert. Schade!

I really like the pedicure at Furama, and they're the only salon I let put glitter polish on my piggies.

Sometimes their state of the art massage chairs alternate between goosing and squeezing my bum.

Sometimes, when you order the callous removal, they grate a hole in your foot with that cheese grating tool, and sometimes they don't... but the pedicure is so good you'll be back.

Their tagline should be: Furama Nails - So good, you wont care when we cheese-grate a hole into your foot.

Yeah. Something like that.

Words of Advice:
Don't bond with a stripper right before you are going to get a lap dance.  Knowing about her kids, drug habits, preference of deoderent and relationship with her father does not make the dance more erotic.  I felt like I was getting grinded on by my slutty younger cousin. And that's weird.

The strippers are very nice here and there is a nice mix of real boobies and fake boobies if you like variety.  And if you are a girl you might or might not leave with a hickey for free.  Bonus!

Regrettably, I have to admit I've been here more then a few times over the years -- as well as their facilities on Shea Boulevard and Thunderbird.

All the Departments are excellent, as are the surgeons.  You may not be in Rochester, MN but these folks are the best!

My best advice is to stay healthy!  

But, if you must be sick, find yourself in need of an operation, wake up one morning with the knowledge that you have Radiation treatment in your future, or Chemo; then there is no better place to seek help!

BTW, Patrick in Spiritual Care is very good and, life doesn't suck!

Dillards clearance center and me were destined to meet. Any time you can mix great quality, name brand clothes with low, low  prices it is a recipe for shopping, and Dillards Clearance has perfected the recipe. 

The store is huge with racks upon racks of earlier / last season items straight from the racks of Dillards. This center and the one in metro center mall both receive merchandise from all southwest US dillards stores, according to one iffy sales representative.

I scored with a 5 discounted Murano, Calvin Klein, and Perry Ellis shirts, 2 or 3 sweaters, a jacket, a pair of dress pants, 4 packages of new mens "under garments", and a pair of dockers shorts for about $150 after tax. A bargain shoppers delight - you just can't go wrong!

This Outlet is very similar to Tangers located near Arrowhead.

For the most part, they have all the same stores with a few exceptions.  Two that come to mind is Ralph Lauren Polo and Tommy Bahamas.  

RLP is massive in size and at least two to three times larger than any other of their outlets.  The selection is outstanding.  From what I can deduce, they are taking their department store inventory and just cutting them out entirely.  The merchandise is marked down across the board by 30%, see photos.

Tommy Bahamas Outelt is new to me, though I have shopped at their stores in Kierland and Scottsdale Fashion.  The quality of their merchandise is outstanding.  Another plus to this location is the Saks Fifth Avenue, Off 5th outlet store.

This is probably the easiest trail that you're ever going to hike besides walking around your block. You only go up an additional 400 plus feet in elevation during the hike. I believe the total loop is a little over 4 miles. This is a great hike for beginners and hiking in groups where you can have casual conversations. There are some rocky parts but mostly this is a dirt trail. This hike at a slow walking pace is about a two hour hike. There are some nice vistas so bring your camera.

Visitors who don't hike a lot and who are just looking for a casual and a good workout hike, read this. I repeat, read this. This part of Camelback Mountain is for you. Only do Echo Canyon if you are up for hoisting yourself up with your hands and climbing boulders. This hike doesn't have that. This hike is simple hiking up a mountain. It's best to wear hiking shoes to help with traction, but the most strenuous part of the hike is getting a stair master workout with climbing up over small rocks. Parking can be tough so it's best to go during off hours or park further away and walk. Dogs are welcome and on a clear day, the views are nice!

Best shop in town.
Every employee at Dyno-Comp is well-informed and treats the business like their own. This translates to quality work and attention to detail, as well as attention to the client.  Nobody is trying to screw you or upsell, and the work they do is bar none the best available.
I personally have dealt with Richard, Ken, and Ron, and could not be happier.

My heart HEARTS Dr. Battersby. And, well, so does the rest of me. What? A doctor who actually spends time with me? A doctor, seemingly, genuinely concerned? A doctor who takes my blood pressure and doesn't leave it to the nurse? I was a bit nervous upon entry, as the waiting area, is, well, it's kinda ghetto. Perhaps not ghetto. But sort of like someones basement TV room. But it's the nurturing that counts and Dr. B is the man! He wrote my prescription for my soaring blood pressure (hey, it's genetic! BACK OFF!

I'd rather spend my $ at Earls. if ur a lobster freak, it's worth a looksie as they have many items like lobster grilled cheese, with waffles, lobster rolls- which are $22 for the large ones.

Yep, we got water here.

This Walgreens is conveniently located between several hotel-casinos, including Treasure Island, Venetian, the Wynn, or the MGM Mirage. It's stocked as well as any Walgreens in a suburban area, and just as spacious. We stocked up on H2O, orange juice, and cranberry juice. (Uh, call us fruit juice enthusiasts.)

This was one STINKY place. I'm sorry. It was hard to stick around and peruse the material past of strangers. But. It's Goodwill, so I can't give it one star. And I bonded with my MIL that day. So add a star.

Good? Probably. Will? I go back? 

Please no. Don't make me. Unless the MIL is back intown.

After being in Portland for quite some time, I've been craving for the good ol' In-N-Out Burger!

I convinced my grandma to make a pit-stop here for my usual:
#2 with grilled onions + fries + strawberry shake = happy tummy!

Service here was quite superb! Friendly, fast and no frills! This location is very close to the 215 freeway, so you can't miss it! 

Thanks, In-N-Out for satisfying my cravings!

Just like in the Goodwill commercial! I swear! You've all seen the commercials right? The customer arrives, ask where, oh, a power drill would be...Goodwill employee says in the tool section and points. Then we see the giddy customer trying on hats, sipping air from a coffee mug, settling into a recliner and finding a backyard croquet set. 

Upon check out the same employee asks "Did you find what you were looking for?" Cut to the giddy customer with a cart heaping full of Goodwill goodies...or as I call them...Goodwillies...and he replies rather happily, "Nope!"

Rickie and I were looking for a bicycle. Did we leave with a bicycle? Nope. But I scored some fabulous seemingly brand new throw pillows for ten bucks. 

Good? You betcha! Will? Will I go here again? You betcha!

P.S. And props for the store not smelling like a nest of moths died under an angora sweater.

I always try to make a stop here to check out their display. This time, they had a fun easter garden. It's a great place to take photos and kind of get away from the whole mode of sitting in front of a slot machine pressing buttons. There's also a Jean Phillipes around the corner.

Tommy Bahamas Outlet is new to me, but we were very impressed with the offerings found in this high quality clothier.

I've been to a few Tommy Bahamas over the years, mostly on the west coast.  Their clothes are of a very high quality and trendy.  Particularly if you you are walking off a beach or are in the island setting. That is not a snarky comment, but a statement on their style and appearance.  I like the look very much and was surprised that they had an outlet store.

Virtually everything in the store is marked at 50% off, see photo. I also liked the steel drummer playing as you come to get you in the mood.  Very nice!

Thank goodness I am a total barfly. I was waiting for IcePics to open, and got tired of sitting in my car. So I decided to drive around the area.

Just a few doors down, I found Standard Restaurant Equipment. I did a Dukes of Hazzard-like screeching turn around a broken down bus and careened into the parking lot.

I love kitchen gear. But I am underemployed, and was afraid I'd spend a lot of money inside. But no. 

Check it. For under $20, I got a half sheet pan (on sale for $6 -- down from $23!), 2 squeeze bottles (72 cents a piece!), a muddler, a turner, an ashtray, and a dough scraper.

Hell yeah! It's Williams-Sonoma for welfare losers like me.

This chain store proved to be a lifesaver during my trip to Vegas.  What does this place have that no other stores on the strip have? 

CHEAP LIQUOR AND SOUVENIRS! mmm. 

While the prices of handles and fifths are about 10%-15% higher than those at BevMo! (in California),  thirsty vacationers will find themselves settling as there are no other liquor stores on the strip that sell anything besides beer. Because clubs and bars drive the prices of drinks up to the extreme, it's very wise that you stock up on bulk alcohol here to save yourself a ton of money. 

This is also a good place to stock up on liters of water that sell for 1 buck, as opposed to paying 2 bucks for small bottles elsewhere. 

Thank you, ABC store!

Over the years, I've been in a lot of sheet metal; Ferrari, Porsche, Bentley, you name it.

I've also been fortunate enough to have driven at the Charlotte Motor Speedway when it first reopened in several different cars.  But I have no idea what to say about Tesla, except something humorless about their cars not needing a cigarette lighter.

I've seen quite a few around town. And yes, it's a very nice car but... $122K for a Model S? I'll admit there's certainly a je nes se qua to them that attracts folks.  The stock price is another story. Really.  

The showroom also seems to do a brisk business in shirts, hats, et cetera.

But I hope they survive, live long and prosper.  If only because I don't want to hear about them being an electric deLorean.

Enjoy!  If you can.

Have you Heard?

Numerous clean, airy galleries highlight and display ancient to modern American Indian artifacts and art in tastefully designed, well-lit spaces. This private, nonprofit museum has earned an international reputation for its thorough and sensitive portrayal and presentation of Native cultures, heritage and lifestyle, in particular, those in the Southwest.  The Hopi Katsina doll collection must be one of the largest and most complete in the nation. These dolls, or "visible prayers", are as beautiful to see as they are complex in description. The 1910-1945 Goldwater-Kibbey Collection is a must-see for its historical importance and cultural representation. For more information, as well as collecting tips, visit: www.heard.org/katsinadolls

In addition to providing residents and visitors an unparalleled source of Southwest American Indian cultural information, this museum offers a learning center, shops specializing in Native gifts and books, student art shows, a library and archives, a pleasingly cool courtyard, two gardens and a very decent caf where I had one of the tastiest chicken quesedillas I've found anywhere.


P.S., there is no need to correct my use of the term Katsina over "Kachina". Though they're the same thing, the pronunciation of "Katsina" more nearly approximates the Hopi language. So who says I'm culturally inept, ignorant or insensitive?

Now you've heard...and the word is Heard.

The food was dry and pointless. The atmosphere was useless. I could see the people at all the tables making that face of disgust. Each plaint appeared on the table as though it was just thrown together but a terrible team of kitchen workers. 

If there was one chef in the kitchen then things probably would have been better.

Mama Mia! Fast food Italian. Who woulda thunk it? Well. Somebody incompetent and passionless. I would rename this place Yuckoli's. Fits better. 

I knew I was treading on dicey turf going to this joint. But it was in Rickie's old hood and the culinary establishments were limited to fast food and chain restaurants. So I went basic with spaghetti and meatballs (oh God, really, for the love of balls, these circular beef objects were filled with some sawdust like material and blander than Jennifer Aniston's movie career). Not good. We also tried a chicken Alfredo like dish that apparently was made with Elmer's glue. 

Pasty. Bland. And, yes, it does stick to construction paper. 

I wasn't expecting much. But I wasn't expecting to be grossed out. All I can say is "Mama Mia, papsa a pee'ah, daddy's got the diarrhea". 

There.

I'm sorry. I know this is a discount store. I'm not expecting cappuccino and Evian while shopping, though it would be a lovely touch.  But could you sweep the floor? I mean you sell brooms for God's sake. 

I did score a coffee bean grinder for twelve bucks. But I was covered in cardboard box grime. It's cluttered and hard to navigate the filthy aisles.

Vanguard has been at the forefront of the low cost/ low management fee mutual fund movement started by John Bogle some forty plus years ago. 

Bogle's philosophy was based in part on the concepts put forth by the University of Chicago Nobel economist Harry Markowitz. It stated that the stock market was truly efficient, and therefore impossible to outperform through stock selection.  Instead, Vanguard offers an Index approach to overcome this conundrum.

Today, the equity markets have embraced the Index fund movement.  No longer is Vanguard just Index'er, but have grown to include ETFs and annuities as well.  Though headquartered back east in Pennsylvania, their Scottsdale complex is huge.  I've found it equally impressive driving past there at 6 am and seeing the entire parking lot full.

As Harry Markowitz proved, it is was impossible to outperform the market by timing your purchases of stocks, so consider an index instead. Yes, I am a fan.

There are three free tram systems that operate on the west side of the strip. They're a great alternative to the $5 a ride monorail that runs on the east side. Working north, you can get from Mandalay to Excalibur. Get off at Excalibur and cut through New York New York. Enter the Monte Carlo and jump the Monte Carlo to Bellagio tram. I think this one is the more impressive of the trams. While you're waiting for the Monte Carlo tram you can ogle people lounging around Monte Carlo's pool. 

Beat that Toronto Transit!

After getting off at the Bellagio, you can cut through Caesar's Palace and get to the Mirage. At the Mirage you can board the third tram north to the pretty damn ghetto Treasure Island. And from Treasure Island you can then cross the road to the Fashion Show mall.

We hired this company recently to unload a Broadway Express trailer on a very hot Sunday afternoon in July.  Thankfully, Conrad was happy to provide a crew for our move despite it being on a Sunday and despite us not knowing an exact start time.  Both Conrad and Jessie were great on the phone and were so kind and flexible with our situation.  When our crew arrived, we were thankful for their hard work and their desire to make sure we were satisfied.  Rene did a wonderful job and we really appreciated the hard work of the crew.

Took the mom and sister here for a cool down today and WOW! I had the Vesuvio, which had the ability to literally fill my mouth with flavor bursting from each little paddle full of goodness. Thankfully I chose the single scoop, because honestly it was so rich that I probably  would have gone in to an embarrassing moaning fest if there had been any more in my cup. Mom had the Light Mint Chip - a refreshing choice on such a hot summer day. Sister brazenly went for two scoops of Caffe Espresso paired with Chocolate.  Other than the much discussed PITA parking situation complements of LGO, there was not a single deterrent from the perfection of this experience.

The two carne asada tacos I had were basically two of the smallest tacos that I have ever seen. The taste was so so. They have a great outdoor patio and plenty of room in the dining area.

But I don't see myself coming back to America's Taco Shop.

THEHotel is pretty on the surface, but, like Vegas itself, lacks depth and character. Mandalay Bay has a tropical vibe, but it's so half-assed it's barely noticeable. THEHotel is far from the pool and spa, and Mandalay Bay is far from center Strip.

A group of housekeepers chilling in the hallway talking about the harshness of life isn't something you'd expect to see in a hotel this swank, but it was the most refreshingly real thing I saw on my trip.

And you can keep placing "THE" in front of things.. it doesn't make it any more spectacular:

"I jumped in THEBathroom and took a wicked dump in THEToilet before hopping in THEShower."

They made the show look more like the movie rather than the original Broadway show... =) I'm just disappointed that they had cut a lot of the singing out compared to the original version..probably to get you onto the casino floor 2 loose more money 2 the casino..hahhaa... =)

The BEST Thai in town. Not just in my hood, but the best period. I'm not usually regretful but I'm seriously upset that I just recently discovered this gem. 

The Massaman curry is amazing. With big chunks of sweet potato and buttery avocado, "It's the best Jerry, the best!" Spicy #7 is ALL I can handle. They do 1-10 on the spicy scale and we're talking serious heat here. If my Thai food doesn't cause a runny nose, I don't wanna eat it. David Wong's does the trick every time. If you order spicy #5 at your usual Thai joint, you probably wanna cut that down to about a #2 at Pan Asia. 

If you LIKE Thai food, try David Wong's, and you will LOVE Thai food.

Rooms at LVH are inexpensive, additional amenities are very much the opposite (wireless is thirteen dollars a day, a single quart of Crystal Geyser is four), rooms are clean and pleasant, et cetera, you can read about that stuff in any of these reviews. 

More important than any of that is the sheer amount of nipple slippage going on outside. If you are lucky enough to have a room facing the pool, park yourself in front of a giant picture window 'round happy hour and check out the free boob show*.

Amex's Centurion lounge gets 5 stars not only for being very accommodating during my  6 hour delay, but for being one of the finest domestic airport lounges I've had the pleasure to enjoy in awhile. 

From a computer fax station, full bar with premium beer, spirits and wine,  gourmet buffet including Scott Conant of Scarpetta fame's fine cuisine, coffee and refreshments,  to multiple spacious lounge areas with cushy loveseats, private lounge pods with charging stations, kids play zone, chaise lounges looking out into the Tarmac and more, this lounge is pretty much has it all. I know ill most likely be frequenting this one as opposed to the smaller Club VIP Lounge located in the same terminal. Additionally, I'm allowed up to two guests as opposed to a 25$ charge for additional guests at the other lounges. 

It's one of the great perks you get being a valued Amex card member.

You have to love Costco Tire and Automotive!!!

About two years ago, I had to replaced all four of my tires after 25,000 miles. At the time, I thought I would go to my car dealer or Discount Tires for replacements. But decided I would give Costco Tire a shot. 

Here I am today, twenty-seven months and 25,000 miles later in need of four new tires. Bridgestone gave me a 65,000 miles warranty -- which would mean I would be getting a $75.01 credit for each tire!

The cost of four new Michelin's, which would have been $483.96 instead cost me only $213.06, including all taxes and tire disposal. 

Here's the best part, the new Michelin's come with a 90,000 mile warranty. Nice, eh!

It's definitely not the Encore or Wynn. The spa is lovely. The gym has great equipment but no bottled water. The rooms were okay but seemed dated. The whole sunken living room idea seems very 1970. Getting help from the concierge was a bit frustrating as they were at capacity. They were able to accommodate a late checkout, which was appreciated but I would not choose to stay here again as I think there are several Vegas properties that are much nicer.

Occasionally you can score some hottie 2xist undies. But the real gospel. Is found in housewares.

Usually go for the sub, but on a whim, decided to order a Chipotle chicken wrap.  Why do they call it a wrap, because essentially, its a sandwich, in a burrito.

I'd much rather be eating a "Sanrito", which makes me think of Hello Kitty.  Conversely, the "Burwich" makes me think of Burma, now called Myanmar, which makes me think of self-immolating monks... which brings me right back to the roasted chicken in this here wrap.

I'm all about supporting small local businesses but I was lied to by John Mull employees about something I consider important.

I called once and asked if they carried grass fed, pasture raised beef. The woman who answered the phone said yes so I went down and purchased two steaks. I verified one more time before purchasing that the beef was grass fed and again I was told yes. The steaks tasted great, but grass fed beef has a particular taste.

Feeling skeptical, I called again today to see if they had any more in stock and to get the name of their supplier. The woman who answered the phone consulted with someone else and told me they don't carry grass fed beef, nor have they ever.

A bar with one of the best views around that serves up amazing cocktails as well?! If I lived in PHX, I'd be taking all my dates here. Gorgeous, cozy, romantic... LOVE IT!

The bartenders are all very friendly, and they are fantastic mixologists. I absolutely loved my Bourbon Sidecar. And you can get a little piece of SF here - yes, they have Fernet!

Located at Sanctuary Resort, you can enjoy drinks inside the swanky lounge or even better - take your cocktails outside onto the secluded patio, get comfy by the fire pit or under a heat lamp and star gaze.

SWOON.

Here's a list of things I could hypothetically do in the amount of time it takes Pura Vida to make lunch:

- Read a few books on the subject of restaurant ownership
- Build an organic  farm in my backyard
- Grow an entire crop of fruits and vegetables
- Learn to cook an entire menu's worth of vegetarian recipes
- Get a restaurant business license
- Get a small business loan and lease a suitable property
- Grow a full, luxurious beard

I had a lunch reservation at 1:45. At 2:30 they called me up to tell me that they could not have my food ready until 3:15. I ordered a quesadilla and some soup, not The Great Pyramids of Egypt. 

Instead of apologizing for wasting my time, the chef immediately got defensive and indignant with me. The whole restaurant got to watch a soap opera moment unfold as she blamed her employee for poor time management, then she blamed me for not being flexible. Dinner and a show! 

I do not recommend you to go to Pura Vida Bakery & Bystro.

They had a BABY JESUS pencil topper set!!! OMG, I think I died and went to heaven. 

Plus they had a photo booth and pirate cupcake wrappers, and oh yeah, they had candy. I found it to be a novelty store that happened to sell candy and other eccentric knick knacks. But whoa, what a bunch of poor reviews I see here. I found Smeeks to be a delight. The scene on a Saturday afternoon was kind of a mob scene -- about a dozen or so people kind of crowded the place.

I spent $5 on my Baby Jesus pencil toppers and found prices on other things to be just right -- it's an independent local business selling specialty goods, people.

So go ahead -- spend your money at another chain to save a buck, kwitcherbitchin and move to Buckeye. Thank you. The End.

This is SO unfair. How could I possibly give a bad review to an organization of volunteers whose main purpose is to save our cute canine comrades from the electric chair? Well....here goes. 
It's a very well organized store. I would say it's 85% women's clothing, 10% furniture and accessories and 5% men's clothing. So, really not much for me too look at. And no, I don't have any drag events coming up. Rickie, however, did find a beautiful vintage dress, black lace with a pearl satin lining, that he, no doubt, will turn into a priceless gown. 
But I definitely had to step outside, as the store smelled like the back of my Aunt Helen's stale, mothball riddled closet. Yes, I used to play in her closet....she had more pumps than a truck stop.

I would like to try this place, but they are unresponsive to customers.  It seems that they tried to advertise with Groupon, and then didn't actually like it when customers tried to redeem their Groupons.

--Did not answer the phone repeatedly
--Actually spoke to her once, and she told me to text her.  I texted, got no reply.
--Showed up at the restaurant at 4:30PM on a Saturday, and the doors were locked.  No answer to knocking or calling the phone.  
--Other customers were outside, waiting.  One couple actually had a 4PM reservation, and was still waiting outside nearly an hour later.

Tina's Ethiopian Cafe is not treating their customers with respect, and this is unacceptable.

I have to say the most annoying person on TV right now is Flo. You know that perky bitch pitching for Progressive insurance. UGH! I just want to smash her face in because her voice is like chewing on aluminum foil while scraping your nails on a chalkboard. 

That said, I almost want to get rear ended again. Get your mind out of the gutter folks. I was stopped at a red light recently when the man behind me decided to go and ran his Mercedes right into me.

Within ten days, Hamilton, my now buddy at Progressive, came to my house and cut me two checks for damages to my car and damages to my back. 

If I wasn't so happy with my little gecko insurer I would consider Progressive. Course they'd need to dump Flo. Dump Flo? Ewww...that sounds gross...

If I hadn't already fallen in love and married Rickie, this would be my mother's second choice.  Holy Casserole! She loves this place. This place will seduce even the most novice of chefs. From the best spatulas in the world (yes, I said the world) to the special stove top cleaner my mother needs that's only available here, SLT, has everything but the kitchen sink. Pun, brutally intended. And as Rhonda J reviewed, the knife section is mesmerizing. And if you've ever used a quality knife and then used, oh I don't know, some piece of crap from Ikea, you will NEVER go back. You may as well slice that cucumber with a rubber band. Great staff. Great inventory. And it makes mama happy. And if mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy. Hmmm...isn't that a refrigerator magnet somewhere? Bon apetit yelpers!

NYPD makes a decent pie and is a perfect place to go for a quick lunch.

A colleague and I came here last week and had a nice time,  Cheese slices are $2.25 and Sausage and Pepperoni (photos) were $2.90.  So $5.57 for a quick lunch seems very good to me.

Don't get me wrong, this is not gourmet pizza or a wood fired pie by any stretch, but it was good, fast and cheap.  Fired Pies over on Ray couldn't fit our time window, but NYPD did the trick.

Loved this! How many offices would you actually take a tour of?

Say what you want about the Downtown Project, Zappos itself is a company I would love to work for. If you have ever (or are currently) working in a shite office for a company that makes you feel like you're just a statistic, than you should check out the culture here at Zappos. From the tour alone, I learned about the transparent corporate ladder, saw open workstations, casual dress, Batista's, free food, supplemented food, 'quiet floors', outdoor areas and a life coach. A LIFE COACH. If that's not caring, I'm not sure what is. 

Seriously, check this place out. It's really great to see a company investing in its own employees once in a while.

Dear Mike, 

As Debbie Boone said in the mid 70s for over 52 weeks, You Light Up My Life. As Elton John belted out so many times, You're Like A Candle In The Wind. And as the Doors famously sang Come On Baby Light My Fire! 

We all know it's about the accessories right. And Mike, girl, you sure know how to decorate. Thank you for prettying up our restaurant with your votives, vases and va va voom! Your votives provide just the perfect lighting for our guests. Kinda like the soft back lighting Barbra Streisand demands in any film she makes. 

And a visit to your showroom....was like...nirvana baby! I totally wanted to play house like I would do at furniture stores when I was a kid. Ok a teenager. Ok Ok...like I did last week at Crate & Barrel. Sheez! 

And yes. If you want to introduce Kathy Griffin to me, I suppose it's ok. Obviously her career could use a boost and I think it's important to help those out that are less fortunate! 

Kisses, 
Thomas

I have taken my dogs here for ever and loved the vets and staff. 

My dog suddenly became very sick on a Wednesday ,morning and I knew that the office opens at 7:30am. 
We got there early and waited. The receptionist opened the doors on time and I struggled to get my 100lb dog into the building. 
My dog collapsed on the floor barely breathing and she tells me that the vet will not be in for another 30 min!!!!! 
Why would you open a veterinary clinic without a vet present!? 

I had to have someone help me get her back into the car and by this time my dogs tongue was blue. 
We got to emergency and she died less then an hour later. 

Thanks Prestige for the help on one of the worst days of my life. I hope it was worth sleeping in...

I'm a beach babe at heart and this is the closest I can get in Arizona without planning a longer journey. The lake is very calm. I like to hang out at Butcher Jones Recreation Area because it has a large beach and the water is shallow, good for hanging out with friends or family. We brought our dog last time, which I guess you're not supposed to do, but I kept him on the leash and there were no problems. 

FYI- No campfires in the summertime! Bring a grill or sandwiches. :0) Also if you plan on drinking, make sure one person stays sober. There will be cops looking for you on the way out. Going to the lake and getting a DUI would definitely ruin a day at the lake.

OMG LADIES! I am HUGE on the bus.  I've been riding it to work for 2.5 years, and am horrified that you guys aren't pushing the benefits of commuting and mass transit in this city!

I love Valley Metro. I ride the Rapid bus, every day, twice a day.  The rapid shuttle is part of Valley Metro, but it is a  very different bus line then the city buses that I think some of you have been riding on. There are 4 Rapid Routes...1 from the west valley, (I-10 west from Avondale) 1 from the north (I-17 from Bell Road) 1 from the East, (I-10 East from Chandler) and 1 servicing the 51, from the 51 and Shea.  

If it were not for these rapid shuttles, I probably would not have a job, and probably have lost my mind by now. After I moved here, within 3 months, I had busted a windshield, had someone do a hit and run on me on the expressway, and basically sat in traffic for a ridiculous amt of time, so much that I was commuting an obnoxious amount of time.

Finally, a fellow co-worker told me that she commutes in half the time from the same place using the bus. Since I started riding the rapid, I've been hooked.  My busses are on time, my commute is 1/3 of what I was doing when I was driving, and the amt of money I have saved on gas is unbelieveable.

After having to wait 3 weeks for a opening when I get there he looks me up and down and says "blowout wont work on your kinda people hair". Mind you I'm wearing a hat he has NO IDEA what my hair looks like all he saw was my brown skin. I am appalled and will be getting my living social refund and placing SEVERAL complaints! It clearly states works on ANY hair type in his ad. Also there are plenty YouTube videos with mixed girls getting Brazilian blowouts , he needs to get real!

I can only offer praises... yes, it can get busy, but it's worth the wait.  The spa pedicure has everything I could want... callous, sugar scrub, hot towel, and my personal fave... paraffin.

They accept AMEX, Visa & MC, but appreciate cash for gratuity.  I think they'd prefer cash for the whole shebang... I know I would.

They also have no qualms with putting a bright coat of hi-gloss on your little piggies... they will call your bluff... so know this before wandering down a bad path.

And when your done, strut those newly pedicured feet down the asphalt runway to Inta'Juice for a little wheatgrass action.  No one's gonna spoil your party, not today!

In the age old debate of length v. girth, Sky Harbor is clearly a proponent of length. I swear this airport is three miles long. And if you have a connection... well, good luck running across the entire airport from people mover to people mover. It's one long, long, long, long, line of hallways and people movers. 

Over and over and over and over again. But... they've got free wifi! ...oh, that only works about 60% of the time. Well, it'll do. They do have clean-ish bathrooms and loads of options as far as airport eateries go. 

But if you take one thing away from this review, let it be this: Length isn't always the answer.

Of the thousands of yellow cabs hailed in NYC and other locations, this was the single most offensive cab ride I've ever had. There was a line-up at McCarren after I landed and I was directed towards a cab. The man took my bag and I hopped inside. Told him I was going to the HRH. His reaction... "F U! I waited for 20 min and you go the the f'n HARD ROCK. THE HARD ROCK. Why do you go there? This is bullsh*t."
Me: Are you talking to me?
Driver: **huge belch** f*ck you...

He dropped me off and was shocked I didn't tip him. 

Me: You should be nicer to people when they come into town.
Driver: F*ck you

I took the $5 tip I was going to give to him and immediately threw it into a video blackjack machine. It turned into $20 after two hands. #Win 

Skip this company if you can. The other reviews don't lie.

This place really is quite special. It's a natural tourist trap, so expect to see plenty of pasty, obnoxious Canadians and so forth, but from what I hear it is a sort of local landmark. 

I went for my birthday this year at the recommendation of a few work friends, and I had an incredible time. The pizza gets alot of flack, apparently, but I enjoyed it just fine. It's not likely to be mistaken for gourmet brick-oven pizza that snobs in Sedona eat, but it's still rather good from what I remember.

The organ was incredible. Gigantic. Played by a really good musician. The song selection is pretty universal, showtunes and the like, but just seeing the thing in action is remarkable. I highly recommend it. Now stop bashing the pizza!

I almost feel bad giving a mediocre review to a park. Yea, you know a place with trees, grass, picnickers and such. Like how can it defend its poor dried up self. It's like picking on Phyllis Diller. But seriously, Phoenix, this is our big main park? This is our Central Park? Ugh! Well, let's just say SISP needs a makeover more than Ty Pennington needs to put down that damn megaphone. Yea. More than that. I've been here for many events. Most recently to walk our beloved Emilie. Oh. She's a dog by the way. This massive inner city urban park was completely empty on a Sunday afternoon. Mind you it was 158 degrees out. So how about making some water-type activities available. And I don't mean the sludgy pond with the homeless man peeing in it. Dare I say, a water slide. Or putt putt golf where it mists on you all the time. Or the world's largest slip n slide. Let's be creative here. The grass was crunchier than a Berkley lesbian. The landscape was as desolate as Jessica Simpson's mind. Just sad. I want a park. I want a landmark park. Any ideas yelpers???

Toys R Us is to kids as Bass Pro Shops is to adults. If you love firearms, camping, knives, fishing, golfing, hiking, boating, hunting, ATV's, archery, or all of the above, this store is for YOU. Literally, every time we go to Vegas I have to stop at this Bass Pro Shops to stock up on ammo. Conveniently found next next to I-15 on Blue Diamond Road, Bass Pro Shops is my welcome committee to Las Vegas from California.

On my last visit we walked the store and found our way towards the giant aquariums and the mermaid painting exhibits at the Silverton Casino connection. What can I say, my wife likes mermaids. After looking at mermaids and stocking up on ammo, I found my way towards the crossbows on the second floor. I fell in love with a Parker Compound Crossbow. I think I found my new hubby to compliment shooting.

If are visiting Vegas, love the outdoors, and have not been to Bass Pro Shops, stop by and enjoy a good walk through this great store.

H&M. Must stand for Happy and Man. Cuz that's what I was after my shopping spree here recently. We scored three pairs of pants and three or four shirts for $150. And I'm talking styling threads dudes! Not some Buffalo Exchange leftovers. Loved that the men's section is on the entire first floor, right when you walk in. It's kind of divided up into three sections, with plenty of merchandise but not so cluttered you accidentally brush up against a strangers boobies while navigating the aisles. Would have liked a better selection of sunglasses (HELLO THIS IS ARIZONA) and belts (HELLO...Oh, I don't really have an end to this one...). 

H & M. Hot Merchandise. Holy Moses. Happy Man! Yep! Can't wait to return.

One of my new favorite restaurants in my area.

Being vegetarian, I love the chinese vegetable quesadilla with their delicious hot sauce drizzled all over it. I normally get this with a refried bean burrito (combo), white rice and refried beans on the side. This is a ton of food. My girlfriend & I normally split this meal and are plenty full afterwards.

The finishing touch of a snickerdoodle cookie is fantastic. Love this place.

My Oceans 11 experience.

I did not just finish robbing a casino of millions of dollars but I stood in front of the fountain wishing I had millions.  I was then slowly awakened to reality from the mist from the fountains.  

You cant pass this place up when your visiting Vegas.  Whether its your first time or not.  The Fountains of Bellagio puts on a spectacular water show.  They are synchronized to music from classical, country and pop.  

Show times vary but once it starts there is a show that happens every 15 minute till it ends at midnight.

Locale ~ On the Strip baby!
Extras ~ Great show, Nice to be outside it!

22" wiener, $27, meh. 
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=4ZfcCa4m5RWvO4EFzfYm1A

I know it's unfair but I have to compare all hot dogs to what you can get at Costco for $1.50. And in this case, I would have happily forwent the baguette, chili, bacon, cheese, kraut, etc. etc., for a dozen Costco dogs and Polish dogs. 

Here, the massively long and narrow wiener was overcooked to the point where the skin was starting to crinkle and pull away from the meat (that's what she said? Ew). Add too many par toppings and you have an overpriced novelty dog at an equally novel bar-type thing. 

Fun if you're an Alice Cooper fan or need a bar to get sloshed and watch games at. But this review is just for the dog.

Beautiful show; loved the intimate settling.

Reminds me of O show but the stage is a round circular shape; lot smaller & more intimate feeling making you feel like you're closer to the stage. 

Vivid & passionate colors used throughout this show.

Loved the beautiful flowers that bloom at the end of the show.

Highly recommend this show; this is one of the better Cirque Soleil shows in Vegas. =)

FYI, you can buy discounted tickets on day of the show at Tix4Tonight but you have to go in person to buy them; they have plenty of booths & locations within casinos so don't worry.

I've been a customer of Yuppie Puppies for over two years now. Brooke grooms my babies and she is, without a doubt, the best groomer in Vegas and my picture perfect dogs prove it. All of my friends that have dogs go to her too now because she rocks! 

I have a maltese and a chinese crested, who aren't the easiest dogs to groom because they are white and both get tear stains, but Brooke does a great job consistently every time. 

The bow & bow ties she stylizes them with are always so cute. I've never seen them done up the same way in the two years that I've brought them in (unless requested). She even had a creative bow and matching bow tie made up for them for the Super Bowl and dressed them up to the nines for a special event I hosted. 

It's the extra special touches like this that makes me proud to be a customer and I will always sing her praises to all that will listen. 

Bring your dogs to Yuppie Puppies and watch them transform your mangy mutt into their inner showdog. You may want to get a doggy agent on speed dial because your dog will look so cute you'll contemplate turning them into the next Toto, Lassie, Benji, Spuds McKenzie, or insert your dog's celebrity lookalike name here. Don't say I didn't warn you!

The highlight of my weekend in Vegas was GBDC. 

Confetti blasting, smoke, crazy dance music, costumes,  funky sunglasses, beer bongs, drinks overflowing in cups, pinatas,whistles blowing, dancing on tables, and tons of beautiful people of course. 

It started off pretty slow but once alcohol was set in motion the place went cray cray!! I was on a guest list and girls received free two free drink tickets which was NICE. I spent the entire afternoon on the dance floor getting day drunk and enjoying the view of Vegas from the 55th floor. The view was even better with my beer goggles on! :)

I'm reminded of a Doctor's reading of an x-ray when he comments "unremarkable" when reviewing Lucky Boy Burger Shop. I order a burger which comes with fries and a shake since they don't have free refills on their sodas. The shake was the best part of the meal. The burger was "unremarkable". The fries were meh.

I think they should just close the dining area and make it drive thru because they don't have a restroom for their customers. Meh. I've experienced better.

Let it be known... flash mobs are not allowed at Scottsdale Fashion Square.  I learned this the hard way and I am no longer allowed to set foot in my go-to shopping mall for the next year.

Despite the "no flash mob" rule, I've been a loyal customer for years.  SFS is a shopper's paradise.  It has pretty much everything you might be looking for from Nordstrom, Neiman's and Macy's to Crate and Barrel, Banana Republic, Anthropology, Hugo Boss, Tiffany, etc... They also have a movie theater and food court and lots of other restaurants to choose from including Z' Tejas, Fred's at Barney's, Modern Steak / Modern Burger, Grand Luxe, and more.

356 days left until I can set foot in Scottsdale Fashion Square again... until then, I'll be spending my $$ at local boutiques, the Biltmore Fashion Park, Scottsdale Quarter, and Kierland Commons.

Feel free to PM me for a link to the aforementioned flash mob if you haven't seen it yet... and happy shopping!

Nathan's $7 Cheeseburger Has Really Got Nothing Much More On A $1 McDouble

SITREP

It certainly has nothing On TWO $1 McDoubles.  And what would anyone rather pay for very similar fast food hamburger- metrics?  $7?  Or $2?

AIRPORT "COST" METRICS

"Since we're an airport location, everything has to be more expensive!  *BULLSHIT*.  Nothing justifies more cost.  But GREED always comes into play with "captured audiences", also like concert or festival sites, malls, etc.  It's all *Bullshit*.

SERVICE

And what I can't abide is attitude given by the cook when I remind him he said the burger "would be out in 5 mins", more than 15 mins ago.  And then he said (again) it would be out in "5 mins".

*Shrug* Sometimes you don't win.

And sometimes therr are just times you feel like an explanation of logic & common measurements of time, would have more impact if shared with a brick wall.

THE LOWDOWN

2-Stars at least for the burger, cause it didn't suck.  But cost, time & attitude *supernova* the remaining stars.

I really hate to give out my annual award for "Best Response From a Business Owner" this early in the year, but I really do think I've found a winner. Here's most of the message I got in my Yelp inbox from Melody H. about my experience:

"Hi Catherine, I remember when you came in and your horrible attitude. I cannot believe you would be so stupid and make-up lies as you did here. I thought to myself when you came in and spoke with me that you were strange. I just had one thing to say after you left and I told the girls there is only so much lip stick you can put on a PIG!"

It's just pure awesomesauce covered with cherries on top! Congrats to Melody H.--you are truly one in a million (and I mean that in the worst way possible, heh).

Never Again!

This was a place that we made a point of going to every time we were in Vegas, as we've always enjoyed their tapas and blood orange mojitos.  Then we ate there on 4/23/12 and were among the 200+ people impacted by salmonella poisoning due to the fact that these morons don't know how to store food, prep food and wash their hands (see the 5 page, 44 point violation report filed by the Southern Nevada Health District).

As to the other reviewers saying that it is closed for renovations, they are misinformed.  This place was not closed for "renovations".  It was closed for making over 200 people violently ill.  If they do reopen (and I seriously hope they don't), avoid this place at all costs.  The violations show a complete lack of control from management and this place does not deserve your business.  There are way too many great places to eat in Vegas that actually know how to properly store meat.

Thanks for the week of vomiting, dehydration and pissing out of my a** Firefly!

OH MAH GAWD!

Normally I don't *love* tamales because they are relatively dry, but when I saw The Tamale Store selling Tamales at the Downtown Public Market I just had to try one. They have three regular vegan options in addition to two dessert vegan options, and 5 vegetarian options.

So, I decided to get a hot Southwest Chipotle and ate it at the market, and got an additional 6 frozen; a combo of Southwest Chipotle, Pumpkin, and Sweet Corn.

Well, these tamales are freaking delicious. Incredibly moist and flavorful, but with very few ingredients, and you can pronounce all of them! 

Their website touts "We use only the freshest produce and extra lean meats. We never use lard or shortenings. We never use preservatives!!" It is OBVIOUSLY true.

I love The Tamale Store!!!

I had a wonderful experience here while in Vegas. As other reviews note, the service is excellent. We had a table right outside over looking the fountain. It was 80 degrees that night and so lovely to be outside and watch the fountains dance to the music. 

We opted for the prix fixe menu. Started with the oysters then had langostines and finally tai snapper and dessert. The cheesecake on the dessert menu is phenomenal. 

What I loved about this whole experience is that it wasn't stuffy. It was relaxed and extremely professional.

So I went to this Harkins for the first time recently. I was sure to park illegally in a handicapped spot and to leave my dog in the car. It's not like it's hot out and really how many people in wheelchairs go to the movies...

OK. Sarcasm and current events aside I had big hopes as we strolled into the theatre lobby. Big. Grandiose. Clean. Helpful staff. Then....

I. Entered. The. Theatre.

Gulp. Um. What the heck? Why are there at least a dozen random seats covered with big black garbage bags? I sat on the edge of my seat the entire movie. And not because it was a cliffhanger. I just felt dirty. Not soft porn dirty. Silkwood dirty. 

Just seemed ghetto and reminded me of the skankhole Harkins on Thomas and 36th Street. 

I may stick to red box and my clean sofa at home!

The food and ambiance were fantastic.  We all enjoyed our dinner of albacore, yellowtail and salmon sushi, chicken yakisoba, beef teriyaki, a spicy tuna and philly roll, and red snapper sashimi with olive oil, black pepper and green onions.  The friendly, helpful staff was also a plus.  I know this wasn't a very descriptive review, but I'm about to be called to a poker table!

Again, upon Adam Richman's heels...  

As a continued fan of "Man vs Food" and after having bookmarked a few of Adam's noted, Phoenician eateries--Chompie's, Alice Cooper'stown, and Los Reyes de la Torta--I saddled up, traversed over 350 sun-scorched miles, and with extreme prejudice negotiated terms of surrender with a literal powerhouse of a Mexican sandwich--one piled high, layered thick, and respectfully ordained "Del Rey."

Muy delicioso!  Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, hot dogs, omelet, chorizo, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce: all hail the King!  Ok, it's true, I may be a bit biased--after all, who am I to contradict Adam?--but unwavering confidence and grandeur shoulder this reigning torta.  My job, put simply: tossing confetti.  How am I doing?  =]

The rundown:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KjOMCauQYI.  (By the way, I visited the West Indian School Rd. location, while Adam opted northward to Sunnyslope's haunt on North 7th St.)

What was even better was being treated like kings, ourselves, while we were there.  We really were.  The service was supreme!  My only regret was not taking a picture of the Elvis statue in the window!  Yes, the King himself.  But I'll get it next time.  Trust me.

Adam...lead on!

[REVIEW FROM THE ROAD]

Oh my god.  (Rental) Trucker Heaven!

SITREP

Shift-change, and I'm riding shotgun once again, so I can say what an awesome travel-center I found Petrol to be.

THE SET-UP

We got gas, but I went inside to buy a small cooler size of ice.  Pedro of Petrol, "you got your own container - and keeping things green with a reduced carbon footprint - so get the ice you need!" - and so I did!

THE AMENITIES

Perhaps it was because we were just outside Vegas, or perhaps because we were traveling that stretch of I-15 to Salt Lake City with a kicked-up truckers' presence, but dam if this place doesn't bring tons of services:

* Private Shower stalls you can use;
* A Full Washer & Dryer Center;
* An Arcade Center;
* A Slot Machine Center;
* A Large Swanky Diner; and,
* Of course, the Drink & Munchie Center

Pretty pretty impressive for what basically amounts to a 1st Class Gas Station / Truck Stop.

THE LOWDOWN

Great Stop for unexpected Munchie fun!

OK. Just so you know. When they arrive at your door with your ice, they've already heard "OH!. THE ICEMAN COMETH"! Or "OH, IT'S SO nICEEEEE TO SEE YOU"! Or "ICE ICE BABY ICE ICE BABY"! Hey, I'm just looking out for ya. I have to say, AZ Iceman has saved my icey ass on more than one occassion. Usually the ice machine next to my office is so loud producing cubes I fear a major hail storm has moved in and nobody has alerted me. Lately. Not so much. She's a tempermental one, that ice machine. So a call to AZ Iceman yields an always polite employee who quickly dispatches the Iceman. Soon my cocktails, teas and sodas are fizzy, happy and cold once again. Like Liza Minelli on her wedding night. I don't know what kinda deal you would get, but I shelled out around $70 for 400 pounds of ice. Yes. You heard me. Four hundred pounds. It's like having Carney Wilson delivered, only in the form of ice cubes. I c u soon.

An initial good sign of any business is proper, friendly and enthusiastic phone answering skills. Budget delivered. Another good sign is the person pronouncing your name correctly. "Yes Thomas how can I help you?"...as oppossed to "Yes Tom how cany I help you?" I totally don't care you called me Tom, hell, you can call me Nancy Drew for all I care, but it shows you are LISTENING! A lost skill, don't ya think? I gave Joe my request. Which was pretty unique. I needed decals applied to a tinted window on my patio. Something to spice it up. We tried ourselves and those little decals bubbled more than a flapjack on a hot griddle in Atlanta in Julyyyy! I've never been to Atlanta or referred to pancakes as flapjacks. Something I just channeled so it seems. The work, by Jeremy was excellent. The follow up by Joe and his wife, visiting my establishment was unsurpassed. And greatly appreciated. So look for the good signs in any company. Politeness. Good work. Follow through. It happened to me. It will happen to you with Budget Signs.

This may be the first review that I've awoken from a deep dream of peace to write.  Ok, first I had to make a pit stop, but then it was time to pen my thoughts and aspir... ooooh hoooold on, brb...

Now, where was I.  Here's a fun fact... the human body can hold up to a quarter of its own weight in disposable fluids, whose liberation can be mobilized by Arriba's own spinach enchiladas.  Ole!

That's right, the green leafy vegetable made famous by a marble-mouthed sailor, now compels me to blow my own ballast tanks... again and again

But I have to say, this couldn't have come at a better time, with tomorrow being the inaugurate outing of my office's hiking group.  Magic 8 Ball says "Signs point to yes" that I'll collapse 27 minutes into the trek from dehydration, and possibly require professional extrication.

You know what doesn't require professional extrication?  The cauldron of dysentery brewing in my lower GI.  Spiiiicy!

But to be fair, its not all waterloo, Arriba's.  I really should thank you for lightening my load, even though I've really never felt more bloated and irritated.  *quizzical look*

And if I ever nurture the desire to tarry in your cantina, which is somewhat reminiscent of The Blue Oyster on tango night, I'll be sure not to waste the opportunity, and schedule that pesky colonoscopy for the following morning.  Osmoprep's got nutin on you, honey.

Delicious! The Hey Joe Special is comprised of perfectly tender and moist chicken (served on the bone, slightly awkward/messy but really really perfectly done), beautifully seasoned pork, and lumpia for $8, along with a pinch of salad and a healthy scoop of rice for the sides. The lumpia were (was? i don't know Filipino food) crispy and savory - I'm glad I splashed the sweet/spicy sauce Brian recommended on them. The pork had an intriguing citrus flavor which I loved. 

The Hey Joe truck will be at 18th Ave & Deer Valley on Mondays from 11-1 for the foreseeable future (your best way to find them is to follow them at twitter.com/heyjoetruck), and I will be there w/ an appetite.

Slot machines (see pros)
TSA was not very efficient
Planes taxi on runway for ever!

A Sweet Review for a Sweet club...

1. It was my boy Kent D's birthday and he wanted to party like a Rock Star...indeed we did...twice over.  We got bottle service inside the club and in the middle of the madness which is the best way to rock it out at XS. 

2. Before we got blitz and started fist pumping, we tipped the 300 lb bouncer so he can keep an eye on us and our table. Luckily we did because some guy tried to help himself to one of our Goose and the bouncer put a smack down on his A$$. 

3. There was plenty of talent and a few bums. Get rid of the bums (thanks 300lb bouncer) and keep the talent.

What happened in Vegas was on a few cameras... need to find and delete...

"Just Say No!" has been around for years to protect our children from drugs.  Well, if you are over 18 there is one drug you must try...Absinthe, the best show at Caesars Palace.  If you want to hear Celine...watch Titanic.  The best entertainment at Caesars is this "trip" of a lifetime, without a drug test. The venue is a 1800's wooden/stain glass tent from Belgium, set outside at Caesars Palace.  The interior is dark and mysterious with wooden chairs around a small stage and a bar.  The air is that of a freak show and you are waiting for the Elephant Man to come out. Go early and enjoy the whole venue, which includes a very eclectic outdoor lounge filled with artwork and sculptures that are a cross between a haunted house and Alice in Wonderland. The New York Times has called this show Cirque du Soleil meets Rocky Horror.  The acts are so intensely entertaining that you are either crying from laughing or praying on your knees that nobody gets hurt from their amazing feats of acrobatics and stunts.  This show is by no means for the timid.  The performers are so talented and death defying, you experience that sensation of driving by a car accident where you don't want to look but you just HAVE to.  Just say YES to Absinthe!

This Costco Gas & Diesel, is easy in... easy out.

Over the past few weeks I've hit a few Costco Gas stations in several different states.  Surprisingly, most of these Costco service stations are conveniently located near most on/off ramps of major Freeways. 

This one is less than a mile from the 101/FLW. So it's almost as easy as the dedicated stations along those interstates. It only requires a little planning ahead of time. LOL

That said, this Costco is near our house.  It is slightly more expensive than the other locations in the Valley, such as Paradise Valley Mall, and Phoenix. But when compared to other gas stations in the area, well... there is no comparison.  

Besides getting gas here, as you drive out on the left you can get your car washed.  Nice!

This review based on my experience in their gas station, this one only got like four or five gas dispenser.  That is like half compare what I used to in other location.  This reason is probably why there is very long line when we came here. The other problem, there were only one gas dispenser in the line.  Seriously, they need to add more dispenser.  This is one of the cheapest gas station near the strip is probably another factor why is so crowded, having less dispenser is not helping at all.

Creme Brulee Gelato. They close at 11pm, so from Paris hotel, we hauled ass to Bellagio to get my fix. The alluring sight of the chocolate fountain art was still accompanied by a line of people ordering last minute crepes and cakes. Ordered my gelato in a waffle cone, and about 8 bucks later, i was a happy MT.

Crikey.  Why Am I Being Diverted To Phoenix?

SITREP

Okay.  So I probably should have paid closer attention to the flight-schedule when my uncle and I were making reservations for my return flight from Spokane to Sacramento.

But a layover in freakin PHOENIX?!?  Jiminy.  It takes much longer to fly to Phoenix than to Sacramento.  And THEN, it's also longer to fly to Sacramento from Phoenix than it would have been to fly between Spokane to Sacramento directly.

INSULT TO INJURY

Talk about getting the ultimate run-a-round.  What would be a normal hour and 45 minute flight now takes six (6) and a half hours!  [Welcome to my world.]

GRAND CANYON

Okay oKay.  Now what mitigated these circumstances a bit was the fact that we flew RIGHT OVER the Grand Canyon and we got to see a lot of the beauty and expansive reach of this wonder of nature.

Take a look at the pictures and get you sense of the feel I had fun seeing it.

THE LOWDOWN

So I may not have enjoyed the total waste in terms of overall "flight & layover time", but on this occasion what a treat to see the Grand Canyon for the first time, so thank you.

Fantastic change of pace. I loved their Swedish meatballs with mashed potatoes, and their Pork Schnitzel is also amazing. All dinners come with a multitude of delicious sides. Unfortunately, the atmosphere here is about as romantic as a K-mart -- Luckily they are moving to a new bigger and better spot on Baseline very soon (hopefully without the florescent lighting). Bonus: The new spot with also have a bar - the owner showed me the plans.

Lions and cougars and manthers! Oh my! Yep. I might as well have been on a safari....the cougars we're thick as thieves. We were here for an event and this joint was jumpin'! Thankfully, it must hold 10,000 people...it is enormous. Lots of different rooms, patios and lounges for the cougars to make their attack. I had VIP service so I can't complain about that. The food was a buffet and was actually quite good. Of course I could have eaten a dish rag and been happy as I needed something to soak up the free Patron. Yep. Free Patron. The crowd was typical for this neck of Scottsdale. Hello stereotype! Could you be any more accurate. I had fun mingling, people watching and leaving. Yep. Leaving. We made a quick escape after I was called a fag in the bathroom by some gelled up, steroided out cardboard head dude. Sorry, just cuz I tried to share a urinal with him. Jeez! What's up with that.

I used to love coming here, until the girls at the front desk were completely rude to me. (The brunette in particular.) This is not the first time that it's happened.

When "discount outlets" started appearing about 20 years ago, they were great!  Now, not so much. 

In the beginning, it was a great way for stores to get rid of their overstocked merchandise. Now, they have just added extra lines just for this distribution channel.  See my review of Coach Outlet. http://www.yelp.com/biz/coach-factory-outlet-glendale#hrid:aIViAW1uXVxHIBB12qoIAA

Polo is no exception. Men's button down Oxford shirts are advertised as $64.99, less a special store discount of an additional 30% off. I have never been here when there wasn't a special store discount of 30% off!  

Okay, so about $46 or so. Both, Dillard's and Macy's have nearly the identical discounts and pricing. Second, rather than the heavy duty 100% cotton Oxford shirts, they are now carrying a lighter weight blend for similar prices. A knock-off if you will of their own product. Wow!

So why shop at an Outlet, when your favorite major retailer can meet or beat these prices?  

In the future, I will take a pass.  Sorry!

On a recent trip to Orange County I had an issue with my checked baggage.  I flew during the December rain storms and when I picked up my bag at baggage claim, it was soaking wet.  I realize that bags are outside for a period of time during transport, so I didn't think much of it, until.....

I got home and discovered that the inside of my bag was soaking wet too!  All of my clothes were soaked or damp.  I was trying to figure out what happened when I realized that my flight was delayed 2 hrs in Orange County and it was pouring rain....the bags must have been sitting on the runway exposed to the rain.  I didn't mind the clothes getting soaked, but I had 2 textbooks that got damaged.

I promptly called Southwest Airlines and they asked how much they were worth.  I told them I checked on Amazon.com and that the replacement cost was $117 for both books.  They checked on their computer to verify it....once they did, they said "come on down and we'll write a check for $117".

The next day I brought my damaged textbooks to the baggage claim office at the airport and they promptly wrote me a check for $117 after verifying the damaged books.  Awesome!

One quick tip:  If you fly Southwest and have any issues with your bags, you have 4 hours from the time your flight arrives to report the issue, otherwise you can't file a claim with them.  I was lucky that I noticed right away and called them in just under 2 hours.

Kudos to Southwest!

Prepare for a shift in perspective...

Too many times, Mexican food is rather typical.  In fact it's likely that, with few variances and exceptions, predictions prevail.  Not that Mexican food isn't super tasty, because it is.  It's just that it isn't usually served with much explosive flair or out-of-the-box creativity.  (I mean, we've all come to know what to expect.)  That is until you've visited the Barrio Caf.

When here, forget what you've known, what you've grown up with.

At the Barrio, Chef Silvana's sophistication and assertiveness with the culinary traditions of Mexican cuisine challenges any and all notions of south-of-the-border authenticity.  Imagine: apples, pears, dried apricots and pecans nesting harmoniously amidst savory chicken, enveloped in a roasted poblano pepper and finished with a light almond sauce, the colors of the Mexican flag (cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds) artfully decorating the myriad of flavors...

"Chiles en Nogada," as explored by Guy Fieri's "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives," is the signature dish that brought me to the artistry of the Barrio.  And it is also the "Chiles en Nogada" that has forever now changed what I thought Mexican cuisine could actually be.  Chef Silvana certainly has an eye for presentation.  To visit Barrio Caf is to appreciate that vision.

*Sorry*  Couldn't help myself.....whenever we go to the Bellagio Fountains, I can't get the Andrea Bocelli song out of my head.....it was used for their ad campaign when they opened and it's burned into my memory for life.

Since it's been almost a full year since my initial review for Allure, and since I've probably dropped about $600 or more at this local business since then, I think it's about time for an update!

I continue to drive out of my way to go to Allure (specifically Michelle and Rose although I've also trusted Nina, Richie, Lindsay, and Jen when in a bind) for my mani / pedis.  I always get compliments on my nails.  They are gel on my real nails but oh so much prettier and last oh so much longer than regular manis.  I keep them short so I can type, lift weights, etc...

If you're looking for a mani and/or pedi, give Allure a call.  And if you need proof before doing so, check out my nails next time you see me :)

Wow. What a trip. The quintessential ladies who lunch spot. I thought for sure I'd see June Cleaver here. These women shop and lunch for sport. I'm sure they lettered it in back in the day. A lovely shaded and flowered patio full of wine swilling dames, swapping stories of infedility, recipes gone bad and where to go for botox. These are things I actually eavesdropped, er, um overheard. I had some delicous rolls before the famous strawberry salad. Salad? Hmmm. Pretty damn good. And in the if you can't beat 'em join 'em category. I had a split of Pop. A French champagne served with a straw. Yes people. A straw. Makes the bubbles fizzier and the buzz quicker. Highly recommended. A great place to take mom, granny or your favorite tranny.

WAY WAY WAY too crowded, lame layout, a hassle getting in, employees with attitude on power trips, expensive drinks even for Vegas, plus a TON of people got their phones and wallets stolen out of their purses (while they were holding them on the dance floor!) the night I was there and I see from other reviews that it wasn't an isolated incident! Too bad because I'm a fan of several of the DJs that are currently residents there. 

I won't be going back and I suggest you stay away as well.

Genius. That's the word that completely describes Frank Lloyd Wright. Everything about this place is genius. Even the location is genius. 

There's something here for everyone. A bit nerdy? No problem, you'll be fascinated by how FLW designed things. What looks simple is actually quite complex when you examine it closely. Into the beauty? Also no problem; he has no problem using bright colors to please the senses.. Into landscaping and the desert? Got it covered. 

I recommend the 90 minute guided tour for full impact.  It'll be the most peaceful and educational 1 1/2 hours you've spent in a long time.

Tip: If you buy tickets online (go to their site) you can save a few dollars.

Next month, I'll be crossing off the 49th state to enter the Union. Alaska, doncha know? And because my friends are planning on taking me to see the Northern Lights, it's gonna be seriously cold. Like 20 below if I'm lucky. So I need gear. Where else to go but Bass Pro for their huge selection and reasonable prices?

I managed to find some inexpensive boots and socks that will keep my feet warm, a good hat to keep my head and face toasty, and a few other odds and ends that should be good for the Arctic weather I am expecting.

Bass Pro also has tons of other goodies, like hunting and fishing equipment, camping gear, exercise wear and of course, everyone's looking for their Duck Dynasty goodies. Here's the place for all of it and more. Need an ATV or an outboard motor? How's about a kayak or a tent? Yep, Bass Pro has it.

I'm writing this review while in a zen zone, having just come from a body flow class at Sutra.  While the studio has a hip, cool, welcoming vibe, and the owner is sweet, I have to say the class I took was a bit lacking...  a bit of my constructive criticism follows:

I'm hoping the instructor is a beginner since she botched a couple of the names of the poses we did.  (IE: she put us into a pigeon pose and referred to it as swan pose and she put us into a happy baby pose and referred to it as child's pose).  In addition, the class did not flow very well.  In the middle of class, the instructor started a song over... I think she may have been trying to choreograph the moves, but it didn't go over so well.  She also screwed up the queues for left and right a few times.  

Nonetheless, the concept of the class is a good one and I would return for some of the other classes on Sutra's schedule if I was in the 'hood.  I noticed Danielle and Dena are both instructors at Sutra and I've taken their classes elsewhere - they are fantastic!

I hope this review didn't come across too harsh.  Sutra has a lot of potential and perhaps it was just an off class that I was at.  Or is it still Mercury retrograde?  That could be a good explanation for anything that may be off...

Yep. David B. Once again the wise sage atop Mount Yelp. I called another locksmith who never returned my call. I called Stagecoach and they said they could help me tomorrow. That's cool. I had a safe in my office and the batteries died and I was unable to open the safe. But you have to open the safe to put in new batteries. Suckky I know! Stagecoach called back and said they can be here in an hour. YEE HAW! Stagecoach to the rescue. I expected a horse and buggy with a rugged Michael Landon (post bed wetting problem, pre Little House on the Prairie...c'mon he was a hottie!) to pull into my parking lot and save the day. Well. That didn't happen. On accounta he's dead. But it was a man named Dean. Lean, mean Dean! No. Not mean at all. He fixed my safe. Installed new batteries at no charge. Yep. Free. Last time I got free batteries was at Castle Boutique when I bought a...oh...wait...my mom reads these reviews. Anyhoo. You got key issues. Lock is jammed. Or your office safe is on the fritz. Get out your ole rotary phone and give Stagecoach a holler!

I used to live on Long Island, so I know a little bit about bagels. This was good, but it wasn't a classic Brooklyn bagel. Maybe it's the water here in the Charlotte area? It was still a good bagel, toasted with some scallion cream cheese.

The coffee was good too.

Nice that they have a free wifi. Comfortable seating area, maybe a nice place to chill with a laptop for a bit.

My only complaint is that when the gal asked me for the combo, it looked like it's supposed to come with a couple of mini-muffins. No biggie - I don't need that many more carbs!

My whole family comes to Dr. Tran and I recently had the pleasure of seeing her myself. The location is perfectly convenient and seeing all the 5 star reviews from reputable Yelpers is a plus!
Dr. Tran's office certainly earns a 5 star review. They are open late until 7pm some nights which is great for people with regular work schedules. They have a large selection of frames and their contact lense pricing is better than Costco. The staff is friendly and very accomodating. I had the pleasure of chatting with Tom, who was a delight and offered me the best deal on my contacts.
Dr. Tran is very knowledgeable and thorough in her exam. She was helpful in answering my questions and concerns;  she even gave me good info on a future laser correction procedure that I'm still getting up the nerve to do (being awake and coherent while looking into a laser beam is not the easiest concept for me to embrace yet). What's great about Dr. Tran is that she also looks ahead to offer you the best solution that takes into consideration factors like your age, your habits and lifestyle. For example, she recommended I under correct one eye so that it doesn't impede on my close up vision possibly reducing future dependancy on reading glasses. I will continue to see Dr. Tran and entrust her to be my co-doctor once I'm ready for Lasik.

OK so the bf is a few years younger than I. Just a tad. OK. So, he's 17 years younger. Oh my god! I'm like, a gay male cougar. I'm a manther! Anyway. I digress. A bunch of his same aged buddies wanted to meet at Kobalt. Rickie and I arrived first and discovered a bright, well kept, no dartboards kinda bar. No smell of stale beer. No problem finding a parking spot. It was actually. Civilized. And it's a gay bar in Phoenix? Wow! After having a few rounds of drinks and perhaps forgetting that I was the elder of the group, one of them exclaims...."Yea. This place is pretty cool. Too bad there's so many guys over 40 here." 
Wow. I was one of those guys. But, hey! What? just because some of the hair on my head has made its way into my ear canal and lower back. And just because I  know Harvey Milk was a slain gay rights activist and not a type of dairy beverage. I can't have a place with a piano, a granite bar and a barstaff that truly knows how to make a Gibson. Thanks Kobalt. I'm blue no longer.

A little over a year ago I was in Edinburgh Scotland with my family to check out Edinburgh Castle.

After our tour of the castle we were famished, so we just walked around the Royal Mile looking for places for lunch.  We found a great place for pizza and then spotted this little patisserie because of its amazing window display.  We decided to go in and try a few things.

We shared a piece of carrot cake and cheesecake and they were both delicious.  Check out my photos.  

I would love to stop by for another dessert if I am ever in Edinburgh again.

Steve is fantastic! I generally consider myself a fairly self-sufficient homeowner. I can fix running toilets, drill holes and grease garage doors myself lol but my squeaky front door that had worsened and expanded during the rainy season was driving me nuts. The hinges were looking crazy and I knew I had to do something about it.
 
Of course I searched Yelp and I found Steve's business with excellent reviews. I called his number, left a voicemail and promptly received a friendly call back a few hours later. He was courteous, professional, timely and charged me a very reasonable rate.

I definitely recommend Steve and will absolutely call him when I need additional home repair done. Thanks Steve!

Four stars with a caveat, DO NOT ACTUALLY GO TO THE RESTURAUNT,---ONLY ORDER BY PHONE!  

Inside is way nasty, it's old, kinda dirty, with an old man sleeping in a chair in the next room, etc. etc.

Food was very fresh, full of vegetables and the chicken and shrimp were both better than PF Changs, IMHO.  I'll order by phone next time and forget that I ever went inside that place.

I stayed here with my friend while we were attending a convention down at the Phoenix Convention Center.  Staying on the 16th floor with a downtown view after a long day at the convention was Heaven.  The beds are soft, the rooms are quiet and spacious, and the wifi is free.  Although we had to pay for parking, it's no different than paying to park by the convention center.  It pretty much evens out.  

The scenic elevator was that of Los Angeles' The Westin Bonaventure.  You get a view of the hotel lobby and atrium before it shoots through the roof and you get a view of the great outdoors.  The lobby is decorated nicely and check-in/check-out is speedy and friendly.  There are a lot of eateries at the hotel and nearby so options are plenty.  

Most importantly:  There's a Starbucks nearby.  Huzzah!  It makes convention time go by more smoothly and makes me a happy camper.

HEALTH IS HAPPINESS

  The Peccole Ranch Walking Trail (PRWT) is an unsigned Summerlin trail system in the neighborhood bounded by Hualapai Way to the west, Charleston Boulevard to the north, Fort Apache Avenue to the east, and Sahara Avenue to the south. After experiencing PRWT, I see it as three connected concrete trails winding through a continuous linear park. Trail 1 starts at Hualapai Way to the west which is 0.4 miles north of Sahara Avenue. A tunnel carries it under Grand Canyon Drive. After intersecting with a spur trail, it heads northeast. A second tunnel carries it under Red Hills Drive. Leaving the tunnel it parallels Apple Drive up to it concludes at Trail 2 near Charleston Boulevard. This is the physical fitness trail. Fitness stations with cooresponding descriptive signs adorn the parkscape. They include a vertical ladder, chinning bars, and squat-stretch bench. If health is happiness, this is the trail to happiness. Trail 2 runs south of the commercial and residential development along Charleston Boulevard from Hualapai Way to a couple hundred feet east of the Apple Drive tunnel. Trail 2 weaves through a linear disk golf course. Trail 3 is the spur trail off Trail 1, which continues the due-east direction of PRWT past a surface crossing with Preakness Pass to the easternmost point at Fort Apache Road.

  In late November, I spent a couple of hours enjoying an adventure on PRWT. It reminded me of its sister linear parks in Summerlin: The Pueblo Park and Cottonwood Canyon. However, there were a few characteristics that separated PRWT from its sister linear parks. In comparison, it is a more compressed space bordered by walls instead of larger homes up on hills; with the exception of the trail east of Preakness Pass,  the landscape is golf course green grass; and parking lots are nonexistent. 

  My adventures along PRWT color me impressed. Graffiti is nonexistent. Mature pine trees and colorful trees that left sprinklets of fallen leaves on golf course green grass attracted birds. Birds were everywhere. Many of the adjacent backyards have humingbird feeders. The white concrete trail is a work of art that gently weaved between the bordering walls of the linear park and under picturesque tunnels. Green streetlamps complimented the parkscape. The gentle inclines added texture to the trail. And the fitness stations are a celebration of good health.

  This is an unadvertised trail. Signing and parking lots are nonexistent. My advice is to park at either the Sahara West Library parking lot or Hualapai Commons Shopping Center anchored by Smith's at the southeast corner of Charleston and Hualapai. To reach PRWT from the Sahara West Library, you will walk north on Grand Canyon Drive for 0.4 miles until you reach the overpass. The Hualapai Commons is adjacent to PRWT. Both parking lots are a relatively short distance east of the 215.

  After spending a couple of hours exploring PRWT I felt uplifted and a few pounds lighter than when I came into the trail. I felt healthy! As the sign says on the fitness trail "health is happiness. " And because this is the season of giving, I want to give people happiness by recommending an adventure on the Peccole Ranch Walking Trail.

Ok. So they're not organic. Not green. They don't take competitors coupons. And, OMG, yes, they are located in a strip mall. Thankfully it's right right down from my beloved A.J.'s. This is a dry cleaner that does it right. My previous dry cleaner ruined two shirts and did nothing to correct the errors. So High Society Cleaners, er, um, wait, I guess it's just Society Cleaners, but whatever, is the real deal. Prices are right. Oh. Oh. I forgot the most important part. The lovely young lady who's always helped me actually has a smile and a warm greeting. Yea. She must be new as the chemicals have yet to permeate her skull and make her rude, scowly and unattractive.

You are not trippin'. It's June in Vegas and over 100 degrees out and it is straight up snowing. Snow ice that is. I don't really know how to explain it, but here it goes.

It's creamy, but not firm like a gallon of ice cream that breaks your spoon or fork or whatever your ice cream weapon of choice is. It's a light creamy.

A light creamy like that of Common's skin. Yes, he is some HOT ass Chocolate. Not light like an ice slushy.

Light like when a girl lightly tip toes out of the bedroom and away from her lover in the morning to brush her teeth and wash away the drool so she looks fresh. 

None of that has anything really to do with Frost Bites, but I don't care. I love Frost Bites for being that delicious dessert I never knew I was missing. At 150 calories for a kids size I think I found my summer crush.

Whenever I'm craving that bean water when I'm visiting my parents, It's A Grind is the place to go --- mainly because it's the closest coffee shop by their house!

I've only had their Nutty Cow with soy, the Caramel Macchiato with soy, and this hot spiced cider drink they serve around the holidays.  It's A Grind always brings warm fuzzy memories of grabbing cider with my older brothers on Christmas morning.  I feel for the baristas who work on Christmas, seriously.

The atmosphere at this coffee shop is casual and low-key.  Think Starbucks but with less wannabe hipsters and more zombie-like adults trying to get through the day.  They have stacks of newspaper for you to borrow to read, plenty of outlets for your electronics, and a wide selection of biscottis for purchase to dunk into your drinks.  They're not stingy with the A/C, they don't mind if you sit around for a couple of hours, and the music ain't bad.  Two thumbs up for It's A Grind!

Really amazing fish entrees, and the fish tour was a nice touch (ask for it!). I also thought the lamb chops and grilled octopus were delicious too. Our group was on a bit of a tight schedule and the staff was in tune with that (though due to timing of our entrees we were eating right down to the wire). Only complaint was the restaurant was filled with light smoke by the end of our dinner, not sure the root cause but hopefully that's not a regular occurrence.

YES! I finally got to experience this fabulous show. Being as the Beatles remain my all time favorite band I have been wanting to see this show forever. And i was not disappointed. We had seats in the front row but up on a ledge. I personally think this could have been the best seats in the house. The portray  of the Beatles era was spot on. The dancers were very talented. My favorite set had to be to the song Strawberry Fields Forever. The entire room went red and they had an array of various performers blowing all different types of bubbles. it was visually arousing. There was also an awesome guest interaction they put a huge white sheet over the crowd and pastel colors shown through. I highly recommend seeing this show. Especially if your a Beatles fan.

I just undertook a tour of ALL the porn shops in Vegas -- all 30! And I am here to tell you, at the end of my research...

...this store is the Best of Las Vegas! Adult Superstore is a chain with multiple locations, but this one is the best A.S.S. in town (even better than *MY* ASS, LOL). 

On a practical level, the place is right off the freeway, with discreet parking in the back of the building, out of sight of prying eyes. It is clean, well-kept and feels safe.

Two stories, huge selection, reasonable prices (better than Deja Vu's prices, for sure). Two-screen theater and arcade upstairs for those who like to jerk it in semi-public. Amazing selection of rubber vaginas and creepily life-like masturbators ("20 pounds of pussy!")...Mexican pocket pussies...giant dongs...cringe-inducingly-circumferenced buttplugs...

I could go on and on, but it would be like trying to describe the contents of the Library of Congress. Futile!

You must be 18 to enter, which is a real shame....because instead of Bar Mitvah-ing and Quinceanera-ing our teens, plying them with useless shit like Last Dolls and wristwatches, a MUCH MORE PRACTICAL rite of passage would be to take them here and buy them a dildo/pocket pussy. I mean, we want to keep the teenage pregnancy rate down, right?!?!?!?

After a three night stay at the Cosmopolitan and three nights checking out Bond, this small bar near the LV Strip Entrance did not live up to hype. It's a-ok, but was dead all three nights except for some people gambling on machines at the bar. 

This Bond was nothing like the cool suave style of a sexy British spy. 

It was more like Double O Disappointment. Hey-yo!

We must of went during an off period because there were no DJs or dancers any of the nights. It was just a nice, clean bar. Again, it's fine, but nothing exciting or really special if there aren't dancers or DJs.

I have a theory. I think that every resort in town tells active and inactive travelers alike that before they leave, the one thing they need to do is climb Camelback Mountain. I completely 100% agree...BUT you must be prepared before you go, especially if you do Echo Canyon. Camelback Mountain is by no means a hard climb for the serious hiker. Expert climbers would laugh at the thought and I've known some professional athletes to hike the mountain multiple times in the middle of the summer for training purposes. But, that's for the experienced hiker, not the visitor who hasn't experienced nature or a hike before. One thing you must know is that the Echo Canyon side has a lot of climbing. When I say climbing, I mean that at times, you hoist yourself up rocks and boulders and there are metal poles for assistance in some areas, should you need it. Imagine it like doing the stair master at a high level. The hike is a good workout but when you get to the top, it's well worth it. 

In summary, this is my advice. If you are a visiting and would like to do a leisurely desert stroll during your stay and are set on Camelback Mountain, do the Summit Trail. It's dusty, but you aren't climbing boulders. If you like to hike, you're ready for a climb and don't mind jumping over and onto boulders, check out Echo Canyon. My 20 pound Cockapoo made it to the top with me and I think you can too, but again...know what you're getting yourself into! I was climbing Echo Canyon one day and a group of 10 out of towners were stuck half way up the first group of rock boulders and they were too afraid to go up and too afraid to go back down. Don't let that be you. :)

Crystals opened its doors to the public on December 3, 2009.

From an architectural standpoint the interior of this brand new high end retail and entertainment district designed by architects Studio Daniel Libeskind and David Rockwell located at the new CityCenter complex along the Las Vegas "Strip" is simply magnificent.

Like the rest of the buildings that will make up CityCenter Crystals is a prime example of the new wave of sustainable architecture that is gaining in popularity throughout the world, and while the specific technical aspect of green buildings probably bores some readers the visual aspect of this project is very pleasing to the eye.  In many ways the features of this building are magnificent works of art.

There are live flower gardens, an interactive water sculpture and a "living" ice sculpture inside.

Over 20 high end retailers already exist inside with another dozen or so to be opened in 2010.  Leave your cash at home because plastic will probably be the name of the game at Crystals.  Some of the businesses already open for business include Bally, Bulgari, Cartier, Ermenegildo Zegna, H. Stern, Louis Vitton, Mikimoto, Porsche Design, Roberto Cavalli and Tiffany & Co.  

Crystals will eventually house a collection of fine restaurants leading off with a pair from Wolfgang Puck with Brasserie Puck and The Pods.  Desperate Housewives' Eva Longoria Parker is slated to open her first Las Vegas restaurant, Beso, as well as a lounge simply titled Eve.

Crystals is located between New York, New York and the Bellagio on the "Strip"although its properties overlap the Monte Carlo.  The free tram that runs between the Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino and the Bellagio now has a stop at Crystals also.

I've broken up with frozen yogurt.  Boba? Boh-bye.  Haagen Dazs can go fahrvergngen themselves.  This is it!  This is my go to dessert destination in Las Vegas.

There have been so many glowing reviews by a lot of reputable Yelpers that it seems ridiculous that I could add anything else into the mix.  Even though my review of their business when they were known as "Frostybites" expresses my sentiments clearly, I love the Ex-Straw-Binary that much to say it again.

It's probably not the most popular flavor but for some reason, it's the perfect sweet spot for me.  When you combine their shaved strawberry ice with strawberries and then strawberry condensed milk on top of it all, it's like the strongest, sweetest musical note.  

If the Ex-Straw-Binary were a guitar solo, it would be Adrian Vandenberg's solo from the Whitesnake classic "Is This Love".  The tone, the sustain, the subtle power of it all.  I eat it up.  It IS love!!

I do feel a little looney sometimes getting the same thing over and over (I've gotten the pumpkin twice with graham crackers which is a solid 2nd place) but I get over it and get it again.

Late November...
The desert air, crisp and clean on a Sunday morning,
And I'm surrounded.
Surrounded by multiple games upon multiple screens,
Lions and Pats, Cards and Hawks.
Friends of old sitting across from one another, stories--once told,
Now again and again--flung casually about, bouncing
Here and there and here and there...
The fireplace aglow, and another on-tap round,
Orange-slice garnishings.
Cheers were in order, and the Verrado Grille,
Also relaxing in the mid-morning sun and welcoming any and all
Who have the luxury of lazy, weekend afternoons,
Hosted.

Here, you recline.

And at noontime sharp,
Our Happy Hour,
Suggestions, recommendations, libations...
Fives and sixes, listed mixes,
And fondues and sliders
And caesars and ritas.
Truffles and pretzels, wings, quesadillas...
Verrado Grille makes your stay easy.
The game's not over, however.
So stay awhile.
Enjoy
The moment and the
Smiles
Surrounding
You.

If you're Asian with the sudden urge to see a fellow Asiaman to feel a sense of belonging in the lonely state of Arizona, go to Myst. Weren't much, but this is where we saw the most Asians in one place throughout our trip.

If you're tired of wallflowers and want to experience something called floorflowers, go to Myst. Apparently, the thing for guys to do here is to stand in the middle of the dance floor and gawk at girls. Hello! Please do not stand right in front of us and stare. We can see you. Not slick at all!

If you're patient and don't mind being hollered by the same guy whom you declined more than once, go to Myst. They got some persistent fellows here.

Although we didn't stay in one of the rooms at Wynn, we spent a lot of time there. Le Reve was spectacular, Okada was amazing, Blush was swanky, The Buffet was decadent. All the staff we encountered was wonderful and friendly. Whether it was waiting in the buffet line, or sitting out by the valet while waiting for a friend to pick us up, we were brought water while we waited. If only they offered us cocktails as well, I would give them a 6th star. 

Wynn glows like gold in the sunlight and makes a bold statement at night. It's amazing that Steve Wynn was able to design it, being nearly blind. Yeah, maybe some of the decor is flashy and colors clash, but it must be hard to dictate colors and patterns to him.

Luxurious and glamorous, you wouldn't expect anything less from the man who transformed The Strip.

Used Creative moving about a month ago. What a great, family-run business. The guys were on time, courteous, and professional. They don't drag their feet - their goal is to get the job done right and as efficiently as possible. As a matter of fact, they came in UNDER the estimate! Not one broken item in the whole move. They carefully wrapped and padded our furniture, and took great care to avoid dinging walls, etc.
Would use Creative again in a heartbeat, and will be recommending them to everyone we know. Could not be more pleased after you hear so many negative things about other movers.

Whoa, what an incredible... list of bourbon!  Well hello nurse.  I mean, such hard to find bourbon.  OMG, really, how do they do that??  Uhhhh. What???

A speak easy from the 1920's, and while sure, Vegas Strip'esque (you walk up to a seemingly innocent bar only to be escorted into a fantasy world of beautiful women), it serves up the best bourbons the States has to offer.

Angel's Envy, Elijah Craig 21, E.H. Taylor Small Batch, Pappy's 23yr old Grand Reserve (which they are currently out of).  It's all there for the taking if you're willing to pay.  And pay your will.  Very high  Vegas markups.

Minimum charge for a seat or table ($50 if you want to stand), but well, well, well worth it for the burlesque show.  Not too racy, very suggestive.  Good audience mix from guys to gals all having a good time.

A true hidden gem of a night spot and one deserving of a try for any bourbon enthusiast.

Wait, what were we talking about...

HUH....

Pizza A Metro in CenPho is branching out! For those of you on the East side, you will pleased to know that they are ramping up their new location in the next few weeks with some invite only soft-launches. If you want to be included, stop by the Thomas location and give them your contact info...  The hard launch is scheduled for October 1, 2008.

I sat down with Maurizio today during lunch and got some of the particulars to whet your appetites -- 

The new location is larger, much larger. They will have a wine room, a bar that will seat approximately 25, and the dining room with seating for 80+.

Some of your favorites will appear on their menu, but Amarone will include a lot of new items which are more in line with the larger kitchen and the more upscale flavor of the new site.

Amarone will be open from 11:00 to Midnight.

For anyone that hasn't had the pleasure of meeting or dining with Maurizio, you are in for a treat. This man LOVES food and experiences obvious pleasure from sharing it with others!

East-siders, mark your calenders and get ready for Amarone!

"You get what you pay for"

If only that were the truth.

Let's see....  We got there and:
1) The elevator from the parking structure is out - so we hoof it from the 4th floor all the way to reception with our bags in tow.  

2)We got booked into a smoking room when we specifically asked for a non-smoking room

3)We got transferred to a non-smoking room (after a few hours) with a view of the Airport.... well, there would have been a view if the windows weren't so damned grimy

4)Uncomfortable Bed

5)Tube TV that kept cutting out every few minutes, which wouldn't have been bad on its own, but the batteries on the remote were dead.. HAH!

Okay, at 25 bucks a night, I might have agreed that we got what we paid for and it might have been a So-so 2.5 to three stars.  MAYBE.

But when you tack on an additional UNDISCLOSED $15/day "Resort Fee"  (What resort? it was 40 freakin Degrees out!), No Wi-Fi AND $15/day wired internet fee??  ....

Umm... Yeah ... 1.5 stars and I'm not even going to round it up to two.


PROTIP: Hooters appears to be where failed Import model wannabes with bad boob jobs go to die. - Enjoy.

Would I spend $300 per night on a room? Hell to the no. Will I sign up for their text message promo list and get a code to get a room at about $90 per night. Fuck yeah.

I got just such a deal for a 700 sq ft HRH suite with two queen beds over Christmas weekend. And I've gotta say these are pretty nice digs. Two big TV's a ginormous swanky bathroom (complete with kickass deep soaking tub), comfy beds, roomy couches, and a sweet bar area... this is how you do Vegas right, kids.

Sure, it's kind of a bitch to take a cab whenever you want to go to the strip, but with Hard Rock being directly across from Hofbrauhaus and Double Down... well, color me happy.

You would think the highlight of my recent Arizona vacation would be spending hours by the fabulous Clarendon Hotel & Spa pool. Or the complimentary foot massage. Or even taking my traveling mates to their first drag show.

Nope.
 
Pinots Palette stole that thunder! What a FUN evening...We brought wine, chocolate and our smiling Minnesota faces and couldn't have had a better time.

The staff is Bed, Bath & Beyond friendly, outgoing and really good dancers. Yep. Drinking wine and painting does lead to dancing!  

They supply you with everything you could possibly need from art supplies to wine glasses to music! And dancing. Did I mention the dancing?!

So brush up on your artistic talents, call your buddies and head to Pinots Palette and paint the town red!

Remember the movie Brokedown Palace with Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale? And all of the Thai people were so mean to them. 

Oh. It has nothing to do with this review. I was just asking if you remembered that movie. Anyway, you won't find mean Thai people here. It's definitely a team  effort here and everyone was very helpful and most friendly. 

Seating is rather awkward as their isn't any signage indicating what to do, wait or sit. Or order inside. But I was quickly invited to sit wherever. Before I knew it a cold, crisp, simple salad and a menu was place in front of me. Yay! Free salad. The dressing was SO good. I bet Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes didn't get free salad. Course they were too busy being pistol whipped by the prison guards. 

Anyhoo...I ordered the pad thai and it was fantastic. Though I would have loved more tofu. It came with the cutest little spring and a wedge of cold watermelon. YUM! Love watermelon as it so refreshing. 

All this for around eight bucks. I bet you Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes...oh...never mind. Just get your butt to Thai Basil. Where you will be greeted warmly, served efficiently and probably, won't get pistol whipped by a lesbian Thai prison guard.

Hands Down The Most Enjoyable Cirque Experience EVER!!!

If you're a fan of MJ and all his amazing work, this show is a Must See!

From the very start of the show to the very end, the performers had the audience engaged with hands clapping and toes tappin' 
Honestly, even if you have two left feet, you will feel compelled to get up and dance! 
The vibe of the entire show is lighthearted yet thoughtful to MJ's extensive body of work. It embodied the best of MJ and his dedication to music, children and equality.  

I truly enjoyed this show on so many levels and I'm not even a huge MJ fan.

Now, be warned, if you're a Cirque Du Soleil purist looking for the obligatory acrobats this show may not be for you. However, if you love a high energy, creative and unique experience, "One" will not disappoint! 

I guarantee you will leave the show feeling gooooood!

Happy Times!

You would have no idea which show I was referring to if I said I saw it in Las Vegas and it starred a group of fairly attractive women doing dance routines to prerecorded music while topless.  That not only describes "Sydney After Dark", but also current strip shows like "Fantasy", "X Burlesque" and "Crazy Girls".  

Australian accents aside, there is nothing new being offered here.  As I watched the prerequisite cowgirl scene, I wondered how/why THIS had become the formula for Vegas topless shows?  Maybe having a girl that sings makes it classier than a strip club?  There has to be a more creative way to present half naked girls!  Oh!  They have a girl in a leotard doing an aerial scarves act!  That was so cool and original like 10 years ago but a snoozefest today.  A topless comedian would have been much better.    

Keeping with the Aussie theme, they dance to mostly native artists from the "lahnn daahn undah" like AC/DC, Tina Arena, Sia and INXS.  I can only guess their sultry version of "Locomotion" was inspired by Kylie Minogue.  They even did an aboriginal routine which left me feeling cultured and educated.  That's a lie. 

The few people in attendance (15% capacity at best) were all moved up to the best seats so buy the cheapest ones if you're going to pay.  I would recommend "Fantasy" at Luxor over this.  The girls are hotter!

if you're a Beatles' Fan this one is for you.

Now i'm not going to say i'm a Beatles' Fan.. but i do enjoy listening to their songs. THere were some songs I did not recognize. Overall i enjoyed every single second of it. 

Interesting stage
Great performance

This show will definitely make you want to sing and dance along.

if you're not a Beatles' fan... i guess you can pass this this show. But if you are a cirque show fan..then i think it's worth seeing just to see the difference between this one vs. the usual cirque du soleil shows.

Useless, overpriced GARBAGE!  

 I came in really wanting to buy something, but as I looked around the store and picked up the items, they looked very cheesy and poorly made for the amount of money they were charging.  Novelty items and ugly cheaply made clothing alike.  $100 for a clutch, and when I opened it, the magnetic clasp seemed flimsy and ready to fall off.  It was hilarious.   

But what can I expect,   trash in exchange for money -- that's who the Kardahsian's are anyway, right?? Lol. 

Another thing that I will have to concur with another reviewer.  I did notice that they were selective about who they gave their Kardashian shopping bags to.  If they don't like how you look or don't think you fit into who they're trying to market their store to by carrying their bags, then no Kardashian shopping bag for you, you get a Mirage bag.  They'll gladly take your money, but they don't want you associated with shopping at their store.

I say pass this store.  You'd find cuter, better quality items at the flea market.  And you won't be discriminated against and denied a shopping bag.

Even though this would pretty much be a one and done for anyone living in Las Vegas, I highly recommend checking out the Neon Museum.  Having the lights on definitely added awesome effect to the signs for the 7:30pm tour.  My wife and I both agreed this was much better to see at night.

Our tour guide, April, was chockful of great information.  She really enhanced what would have been a 10-15 minute walkthrough sans guide to an hour tour full of history and fun stories.  That alone made it well worth the locals admission of $22.  Some of my favorite signs included Sassy Sally's, the humungous Treasure Island skull, the H tile board of the Horseshoe and the creepy at night looking Jackpot Motel sign.

Tix 4 Tonight is a must for those wanting to catch impressive discounts on shows, attractions & meals.  Customers can save up to 50% off the premium pricing that Las Vegas attractions demand.  I utilized Tix 4 Tonight to purchase vouchers to Beatles Love, Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, Donny & Marie and Flavors buffet at Harrah's.  Once I acquired said vouchers, I just had to go to the box office of the particular show to secure my tickets.  Let me tell you, I scored primo seats for Beatles Love and Donny & Marie.  For Beatles Love, the show is in the round, so good seating is available throughout.  The only catch with Tix 4 Tonight is vouchers can only be obtained either the day of or the day before, since it's a discounter that's attempting to sell unsold tickets.  If you want to make sure you secure tix to a show or you want the very best seats, then I suggest buying them ahead of time through the box office or vegas.com.  However, if you're looking for something to do in Vegas, then I highly recommend visiting one of the many Tix 4 Tonight locations located on the Strip.

I guess I should've looked at Brian S's review before I dropped off my clothing at Prestige.  Or, maybe I should've listened to my boyfriend when he told me to ask at Prestige how much each item would be for dry cleaning.  Of course, I didn't... and for that I was punished when I received the bill.

$16 to dry clean a Banana Republic dress that probably cost me $50 to purchase.  That's ridiculous!

Ready for more insanity?
1 shirt/blouse - $14.10 (it had beads on it but still!)
1 dress (another sundress) - $18.40
1 pair of capri pants - $9.10
1cotton blouse - $8.10

Total damage - $65.70

Yes, I am extremely embarrassed that I wasted so much $$ on dry cleaning that I could've had done at the $1.99 cleaners instead!  I would have saved $55.70!  That is a lot of money!

Needless to say, I will not be back to Prestige unless I go to pick up Jared's shirts there.  I guess that's the only decently priced item.  He gets them laundered for $2.25 a pop.

Good luck to you and your high prices, Prestige Cleaners!

$10 house cocktails - the good. 

$100 minimums on the blackjack tables here - the cray cray.

Great spot to end a gambling night with a Bourbon. This bar is all about the whiskey and dark spirits as there is no beer here. Really good selection of whiskey. A list of cocktails to choose from that are reasonably priced. I'm a bourbon guy so "Whiskey In The Jar" and "One In The Chamber" were my drinks of choice here. Tasty and made right.

It's a nice spot to wind down the evening right on the casino floor, but it's not a boisterous loud bar. It's more of a leather couch and quiet conversation place to kick back and relax with a well made bourbon drink. Dimly lit and low key. 

Sure, there are some tables inside here to play a few hands but with the high minimums I viewed only one brave soul throwing down the Benjamins. Not me! I'll head to the $10 blackjack table! With my bourbon cocktail of course.

Ahhhh....Jenny's. Good ole Jenny's. Gay as gay can be. Depending on when you are there of course. I've found myself at Jenny's post bar rush stuffing my pie hole with a club sandwich, fries and many glasses of Coca Cola. 

Then there's the late morning, early afternoon call from friends who want to gather at Jenny's, eat greasy food to soak up the previous evening's booze and dish about who fell down, who got arrested and who will end up on dirty.com! Of course, we all secretly hope it is us!

I love diner waitresses. They get it. They have the patience of a saint and the sass and swagger of a sailor. All the while delivering my hot plate of eggs, shredded hash browns (can you say Ore Ida!?), various meats and extra butter on the toast please. God bless 'em. God bless them all! 

So Jenny's has a place in our hearts. Not on Valentine's Day. Not on the books for New Year's Eve. But, dayum, if I'm not grateful to have you Jenny on that famous CenPho corner, we call 7th Street and Camelback.

I got waxed!

And it was fantastic!

I've been having an inclination to head out to LA to visit Grauman's Chinese Theater & Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum for awhile now.  While in Vegas, we had time to kill so we decided to check out Madame Tussaud's Las Vegas.  I used Tix4Tonight to purchase ticket vouchers for $18/piece, saving myself cash money, which is hard to do when you're in Vegas.  Here's the lowdown-

I had such a good time!  The resemblance of the wax figures to their real-life counterparts vary from spot-on to roughly vague.  Here, posing & touching are encouraged.  Check out my Yelp page for some of the pics I took.  Some I didn't post were a bit on the raunchy side (Fergie & Jenna Jameson, I apologize for my actions that day).  I'm not interested in Nascar/Indy Car racing, so that wing didn't appeal to me & I didn't check out the Scream Haunted House wing.  There was a plethora of wax figures, some w/ props that patrons can use when posing for the camera.  Celebs vary from Tony Bennett & Dean Martin to Katy Perry & 2pac.  Everyone of all ages should get a kick out of the celebs featured here.  There weren't too many people when I was there, so it felt like I had free run of the place, which I gleefully took advantage of.  

To reiterate, I had a blast visiting Madame Tussaud's Las Vegas.  I look forward to visiting the LA location to see whom they have exhibited there.  I remember the old Hollywood Wax Museum that used to be open in Buena Park, and MT blows that out of the water.  I recommend everyone come by and check out Madame Tussaud's for themselves.  You won't regret it!

Good times!

My illustrious "baseball" career began with t-ball. There I was, stranded out in no hitsville right field waving to my parents. Well I'll be doll garned a fly ball is coming my way. My parents waving turned to them pointing earnestly at something behind me. What in the heck were they pointing at I thought? Turns out it was the ball rolling towards the fence just recently hit. I retrieved that ball, with shame, and threw it to the 2nd baseman, and managed to wave once again to my folks in the stands. 

That said, I love stadiums. I love the feeling you get entering an arena with thousands of people all in one place to have a good time. That's the energy I like and feel in most stadiums. Chase was no different. I love how the field is so open from all points in the concourse. For a domed stadium, it indeed feels very open. View was great from the 1st baseline. And the food choices were fantastic. 

Now the fans. Seriously. You'd think we were at a Xanax festival. And I love seeing the father and son teams. Very nostalgic. And indeed it was my dad's birthday, so I was struck by that and it brought back so many amazing and loving memories. But jeez.. We must have been in the "I don't talk to me kid during the game" section. These were very serious fathers. Or overly medicated.

Can't wait to go back. Take me out to the...oh, never mind, I'll spare you.

Awful service. Disrespectful staff. My husband ordered a beer from a waitress, gave her 100. Never came back with beer or change. When my husband, a combat veteran, complained he was grabbed by "security" and told to leave. 

I spoke to manager for several minutes who told me there was nothing he could do. It was the waitress' word against my husband's. So yes let's take a stripper's word over a combat veteran who fought and served our country. 

My sister was charged twice for one lap dance. 

Another friend was told he wouldn't get his ID or Visa back until he signed the check which included 240 worth of bullshit charges. 

I didn't expect much but I was seriously shocked at how shady and underhanded everyone was. 

Two thumbs way way down.

Imagine my horror when I dined at Tottie's recently and she quoted from my last update..."I'd like to roll her up in one of those lettuce leaves, garnish with mint and cilantro and dip her right into that amazing fish sauce.

Yep. That's what I said. It was preceded however by how delightful she is. And believe me, she is. Such a good sport. We had a good laugh.

We ate here Sunday afternoon after attending the ridiculous Warehouse Sale at Mojave Middle School in Scottsdale (think Ed Hardy vomiting in a gymnasium). So we were hungry and ready for Tottie's Rolls. We consumed THREE orders! Fabulous as always. Potstickers were perfection as was the Hot n Sour soup. Serve was spot on, friendly and playful even!

So Tottie. You rock my dim and my sum! Can't wait to go back!

Much creamier, smoother, denser & better tasting than Luv it custard. But it started to melt pretty quickly after receiving it from the front cashier. 

Got the caramel pecan concrete custard very creamy. The pecans were yummy & gave it a great texture to the custard. It was a bit on the extreme sweet side. 3.5 stars

Chocolate malted walnut was pretty good but the malt gave it a funny taste & the walnuts were not fresh. 2.5 stars

Lime rickey was yummy tasted like a lime & cream popsicle.

Overall taste: B - (can be a too sweet...after a couple bites, I was on a major sugar rush). -1

Service: A (helpful) 

Inside decor: A (very kool with all kinds of 50s memorabilia)

Overall great place to visit on a hot day. =)

We came to St Francis early for brunch and had a very nice time.

St Francis is about the food and the ambiance.  It's one of those restaurants that you wish you lived closer to, so you could become a regular.  The service is friendly and the wait staff has a effusive manner.

We ordered the Eggs Benedict with the standard english muffins and hollandaise sauce, skipped the potatoes for $13.00, along with the Farmer's Frittata for $10.00.  Both were very good.  The Frittata's taste lingered well after our meal, but in a good way.  It was light and had a nice mixture of flavors.

All the food came promptly and we had time to sit back and enjoy our meal.  It also gave us an opportunity to  browse the efforts of the interior designer and architect on the space.  I think I would call it light and breezy, as was our meal.

Enjoy!

This year. I went to  Pride. With my mom. My 74 year old, deliciously and overwhelmingly, unconditionally loving mom! Easily one of my favorite days I've ever spent with this saintly human. She was accompanied by her 60ish year old female cousin. Yep. They played lesbians! They thought they were the shit. And they were. While no tonguing occurred (thankfully, that would have been scarring), they did hold hands at one point and giggled. 

I've attended LA, SF, Long Beach, San Diego and NYC Prides. I have a soft spot for our little desert Mayberry Pride. I wish the walk from 3rd Ave and Indian School to the main gate wasn't such a hike. I was exhausted by the time I reached the front gate. But a perfect reason to run straight (ha ha, I said straight) to the beer stand. 

Beer was cold. Brats were hot. Bears were hairy. Twinks were rail ass thin. Lesbians in Wranglers. Port a potties were CLEAN but SO FREAKIN' HOT! 

Second best part next to being with mom and my man....NTUIT's performance. If you haven't seen this dynamo duo, you MUST get their CD! I am biased as I love them both. Oh. And I have a cameo on their last track, Celebrity Life...

Pride. Proud. Budding recording artist. And yep Gay as ever!

As my first venture out after being diagnosed celiac I was not disappointed with their gluten free items! Walking into Greens & Protiens has a very homelike clean feel. It almost seems like it should be in Southern California. They have a large assortment of healthy items on their menu such as shakes, salads, pizzas and sandwiches. I decided to try the green leaf berry blast shake (carrots, kale, berries, spinach, soy milk, agave nectar, and vanilla extract) I've been every day for the past 5 days since for this shake its so delicious! I also tried the Greek pizza on gluten free crust.. YUM! Hummus, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta and kalamata olives. The crust is actually amazing too it's almost like a flatbread. I will be suggesting this place to everyone and I can't wait for their 2nd location on Flamingo and the 215 to open! See you all there :)

Three Square Food Bank is the local non-profit that supplies food and household items to area charities for distribution to those in need.  They don't distribute directly to families, instead they collect all of the items, sort it, and sell it to organizations who serve the needy.

My family has been volunteering here for over 2 yrs.  My Son spends many hours during the Summer and my Wife and I volunteer when we can.  There are many jobs that you can work.  Most of the time we help in the warehouse area sorting food and household items.  It's monotonous work, but if volunteers don't do it the work doesn't get done quickly as there are so many items to sort.

The facility is large and well kept.  The workers there are passionate about their job and are very patient with us volunteers.  With so many volunteers that rotate in/out of the place they must have a lot of patience to train us.

I encourage everyone to consider doing it.  It's really easy to sign up.....fill out a form online and then show up on scheduled dates/times.  Here's the link to more info and to the online volunteer form:
http://www.threesquare.org/how-to-help/volunteer/

We enjoy working here and will continue to volunteer as long as we're a part of this community.

This Las Vegas buffet is permeated with familiar comfort foods prepared in the freshest manner exploiting the finest ingredients. With more than 500+ dishes to choose from daily, every guest is sure to satiate their immense craving at Bacchanal, whether it's one for prime rib, chilled king crab legs that are already cut for you, grilled lamb chop, made to order tacos, and baked-to-order pastries. 

It represented the decadence of a Roman feast set within a fine dining atmosphere. Super chic environment with Sparta theme surrounded by the Greek goddesses or Roman emperors for a huge feast. I've been to Wicked Spoon, The Carnival Buffet, Wynn Buffet, and many others in Las Vegas. This one didn't impress me to an extend. I had super high expectation but it didn't exceed it. I guess all the hype isn't just a bluff. I will have to pass on this one but this deserves 4 stars.

Dollar Blackjack...Wah?! I'm there
The dealers are ornery but I don't care.
Everyone says this place is run down but I don't think so.  It seems good to me, maybe a bit dated with their decor, but I'm here to gamble and get drunk.  Who cares what it looks like?
I always win so every time I'm in Vegas I come here for a bit to make me some money.
*rubs card on nipple*
I always end up paying for the gas because everyone else lost :(
*shakes fist at Vegas*

I got super drunk one time and peed in the corner...and then ran away.
Sowwwwwwrrrrryyy

Tons of protein in their smoothies - organic & all natural fruity ingredients..... which is a very nice change from the ice cream, treaty-like smoothies I'm used to seeing around

Sandwich wraps, salads, & soups that offer many veggie options as well as gluten-free to boot - woot!

We've tried their Quinoa Salad as well as their hummus & pita - both yummy

Energy bars are - "homemade" every day - Pumpkin Walnut was okay - the hummus & quinoa were better

Can't wait to come back for more smoothies & lunchie items ... I feel healthier already

As fast food burger places go, this BK location isn't too bad. 

For a long time BK was a one trick pony, with their Charbroiled Whopper sandwiches. But now,  you see Chicken, Breakfast, 60% healthier fries, Big King, a Big Mac like double burger, and the not too healthy cinnamon buns have all been added. LOL. 

Still... they are no competition for the Oakbrook, IL folk, but BK is getting their corporate act together. Some might say finally. 

The employees all seem nice and helpful; while not looking too close at those just expired coupons. LOL I agree with fellow Yelp'ers Andrew and Javier in their assessment and call your attention to their Reviews. 

So Three and a Half Stars, and A-Ok in my book.

Not a good place for anything more than drinks. They have a very limited menu and were out of many of the items when we sat down. Those available were all small slider-like sandwiches which appeared preprepared (not made to order). It's an ok nook to grab a glass of wine, just don't drop in with high expectations. The waterfall and outdoor seating make it more distinct than other bar options nearby.

Loved my stay! 

My aunt and my uncle have a timeshare, and the Hiltons on the strip were booked, so we ended up here at the one by the Convention Center. It was only about 5 minute drive to the strip, it was quiet and very comfortable. 

We were on the 11th floor in adjoining rooms and it was super comfy! One room had a full kitchen, big frig, dishwasher, dining table, washer and dryer, couches and TV, a separate bedroom and restroom. 
The other room, which i was in, had a huge, very comfortable soft bed, a tv, couch, table, dresser, closet, kitchenette with small fridge and a bathroom. Bathroom had a tub and nice oversized showerhead for shower. 

The only things that i would note that was negative was the doors inside the rooms got stuck. The bathroom door would not close correctly and would made a horrid loud sound every time you tried to get out. The middle door adjoining the rooms got stuck too. 

Other than that,  if you are staying for more than a weekend, this place is really clean and comfortable!

Never in my Yelp career have I started, saved, deleted and restarted a review more than I have this Bashas review. One would think "This is just a grocery store, why all the trouble?"

Bashas is more than just a grocery store; it is a facilitator. A facilitator of what we need as consumers to fuel our lives and contribute to our happy memories or to help us wash away the bad ones. 

Bashas facilitated the best Champagne Sunday that ever existed. It has provided the chlorine that I so desperately needed so many times to keep my pool from going green. Here I found the curry paste that started my affinity for cooking. The cake that ended up all over my living room at my sister's 21st birthday? That's right: Bashas.

So many events and critical moments in our lives revolve around the tangible items we spend our hard earned cash on and we don't even realize it. We may complain about how long we have to stand in line or the fact that Bashas may be a tad more expensive than some other grocery stores, but we cannot deny that we need this Bashas. 

I need you, Bashas.

The bartender I had here was pretty dang cool.  It's so nice to talk to a female who knows about beer.  I sat at the bar and chatted with her and another server that was doing silverware at the bar, they were so friendly.

I can't remember what I had but I know it was delicious and that I should go back for more especially because it was so reasonably priced. The decor is pretty cool. Small and laid back.  Great addition to the downtown good scene!

Alright Tao, you've redeemed yourself in my book! Unlike some other wannabe hotspots in Vegas (rhymes with Insanity), Tao gets it and treats the ladies right!

My girls and I bypassed the line and were led to a VIP table without any attitude. We also got hooked up with open bar for an hour. The bartenders were friendly and so were the rest of the staff.

We had a plush area to lounge in and a platform behind us to dance on top of. The dance floor filled up quick, so it was nice to have our own area to shake our booties. 

Music was 90's hip hop early on in the night, so we had a fun time before we left for XS.

Thanks for the awesome VIP treatment, guys!!

Morton's, was without a doubt one of the original esteemed statehouse restaurants in America, often emulated by others.  Great they were, with superb steaks, outstanding service and old club style ambiance. This was always a top place for business and special occasion dining. Now it is not as much as it was for my money and taste based on a recent visit.
They are taken over by a very large mega restaurant chain corporation. Landry's, who are owners of over 35 restaurants and chains many you would be familiar with now own Morton's too. Morton's no longer has a focus on their original identity, meaning and purpose but are being changed in a modernized way. On my last visit changes were visible. Some changes and cost cutting and commercializing has begun. The menu is changed to include items which will appeal to a broader clientele. Now profits and growth are a bigger part of the strategy. 
Gone is the famous GM Bill. Bill was as much an institution as the restaurant he ran. Changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks. Our ribeyes were not a recognizable ribeye cut and the taste was not there as we remembered. One of three steaks came out drastically overcooked although the error was quickly remedied with a properly cooked replacement.
I just hate to see the continuing commercialization of our esteemed restaurants in America.

I don't mind the cover charge at all (go to a club in a major city this is cheap) The drink prices are super reasonable, when you finally get waited on /: Gotta admit the music is really hit or miss.

We had dinner here last night with some friends and I'm raising my rating by one star to three. 

Everything I wrote about in my original review is still present and I agree with the Yelp'er who thought Nick's as over rated at best. 

The wine list is sad, with only three choices of Italian reds, all Chanti. No Barolo's, Valpolicella, Sangiovese's, or any super Tuscans. I do realize that chantii is made mostly from the sangiovese varietal, but a simple sangiovese would have been nice. 

Where Nick's has improved in is their fish offerings and the baked Lasagna. Both were very good. But their meat Lasagna, which is made with a flavorful Bolognese sauce, was delicious and worth a trip.

I have been coming to Pane Bianco since before the twins were born and before they expanded.  I love my fresh Mozzarella sandwich.  I had an appointment in downtown PHX, so I could finally get a fix.  It had been a few months since I had been able to go and get my sandwich.  I do agree with Iain B.  $10 for a sandwich is pretty hefty, but I cannot help but stop by when I am without the twins.  I was able to sit down at one of the picnic tables outside, yes it was hot, but that is why I live in AZ,  and enjoy my book while I ate my yummy treat.  My husband usually gets the Market sandwich, I had a taste of a few, they are really good, but nothing beats my choice.

"Get fcuked up, and eat pizza" - Old Eugine Proverb

Some old Chinese fool tried to jack that shit from me and use it as his own.

I'm going to lay it down on how to get to this place.   Do not deviate from these directions.

-Walk by all the squealing Asian girls coming out of the club that think they're cuter than they actually are.  Actually...thinking they're cute at all is wrong.
-Five steps past the white girls riding the escalator barefoot.  
-Make a right when you see the Latinas showing off their newly acquired neck art ... hickies.
-And when you see an angry black chick....run the other way.  Fcuk the pizza.

Was the pizza really that good?  I don't remember.  My buddy liked it. I guess I did too.  Not as much as the Reyka tonics I was guzzling down at a frantic pace earlier. Evidently I waxed two slices, made it back to the room, and gracefully blacked out.   I woke up in the middle of the night with a shivering case of mud butt.  That means two things:  

1. It was greasy
2. It was good

I do faintly recall burping up pepperoncinis while on the throne.  I love those things.  Both the pepperoncinis and the porcelain La-Z-Boy.

4 gleaming stars might be a bit too generous, but hell, aren't you all generous and shit when you get shitfaced?  

Yeah...thought so.

BESTEST CREPES. ME LIKEY.

I've experienced quite a few...multiple times...
These guys have mastered the Art of Crepe. Yes. It's a thing. 
Spot-on thickness. Splendid texture, akin to the dense-quality of a good pancake, yet not so doughy. Plus they've got an oh-so-delicate sweetness that allows for versatility as far as making these beauties sweet or savory.  



*Dark chocolate, caramel, sea salt crepe - FAN-frickin-TASTIC. My most-ordered crepe from here. The one that I dream about at night. I no lie. 

*Pumpkin mascarpone pecan crepe - SEASONAL, sigh. 

*Lemon curd and whipped cream crepe - in the words of my dear, econ-majoring friend: "THE TANGENCY!" (for the mathaphobes out there - this is code for: she loved it)

*Apples and caramel and pecan crepe - one of their greatest. (certainly on par with the dark chocolate one I crave every waking moment of my life) the sugary deliciousness of the caramel...with the sweet crunch from the apples and the indulgent flavor of the pecans - love.

*Smoked prosciutto spinach parmesan scrambled - this is the one savory crepe I've dabbled into, though this was my friend's order so I only took a few bites. Tasty nonetheless. 



As far as beverages: I've had their peppermint tea. Check mate. And their chai latte can't be beat. The Art of Crepe carries over to the Art of Latte/latte art - they've got this down man. Delicious AND beautiful bevvies. 

Basically, I love you Bradbury. One of my favorite spots - to study/chill/gastronomically indulge - in Madison.

Hanny's ... you have quite the tasty Riesling. 

But...your service leaves a tad bit to be desired.

On the flip side, you have hot hot hot bartenders, so I really don't mind the wait (sorry DG).

My favorite thing about you is your bathrooms. I mean, I really really love the bathrooms. 

Actually, I love the entire place. If I were going to open a bar, I would want it to look exactly like Hanny's. Well, except the meat cutter at the bar, because I am vegetarian. Perhaps I would get an industrial strength cheese cutter. (ha ha ... cheese cutter!)

Ooooo another bonus... you are right off of the light rail and you normally have parking available right outside... therefore I consider you to be in a good location.

Yeah, Hanny's ... I love you. Quite a bit. Let's go steady.

This is the perfect place to wander into after a long night, and all you want is a greasy pizza with the 1 dollar bills you have left in your pocket you purposely created from your $5.00 so you can play more penny slots. Instead of being left with those .16 cents ticket redemption stubs you can't even play, save those dollars to be spent in the rabbit hole- with no directory name or signs, the fun part is trying to find this place!
But i'm not going to spoil your fun by telling you where this place is- but will give u one clue. If u see a pool table, you're warm. So warm, you will be burning the roof of your mouth in 5 minutes biting into that hot cheese. You've been warned.

I hate being a hater but that was a 2 star experience.  They can't compete with the big boys down the street.  

My wife got the tonkotsu ramen and while the broth was decent, they gave her thin noodles which she didn't like at all.  The server didn't even offer a choice and the thick noodles in my deluxe were way better.  The deluxe definitely wasn't skimpy on ingredients but the broth was bland and the charsiu was just OK.  I would have ordered the deluxe with tonkotsu ramen or shoyu (soy sauce) if I could do it again.  

What's up with no music in the restaurant?  I felt like I was eating ramen in a library.

Is 3 stars the new 2 stars?  Even the 3 star reviews are telling readers to go elsewhere.

If you're going to watch one Cirque show in Vegas, make it this one!

Trust, it's one of the best Cirque shows i've ever seen on the strip!

From the breathtaking panoramic scenes, amazing set changes, and jaw dropping acrobatic performances, this show is a MUST for any Vegas goer.

The water element was what took this show over the top for me.  Much like Le Reve (not a Cirque Du Soleil affiliated show) it was incredible seeing how the set dynamically changed from dry to wet and even wetter!

Just do yourself a favor and do not, i repeat Do NOT purchase tickets for the front rows. You'll eventually end up breaking your neck trying to see all the aerial performances! For me, the sweet spot for any Cirque Du Soleil show is middle and center. You're able to see everything comfortably from this vantage point and that IMO is priceless!

With the combination of the inspiring live soundtrack, exotic sets and spectacular performances, i can guarantee you will have an unforgettable experience that you will treasure for years to come!

Happy Times!

I really wish I could have my money back. And I'm kind of embarrassed that this was a gift activity too.  I'm writing this review actually, as I stand in a Disney-length of line to partake in a simple and probably overrated video game activity. Pretty sure the website hyped this up much more than needed. The "times of entry" that you purchase tickets for, are overcrowded, for one... And for the first 45 mins you are here, nothing is happening.

There is a ratio of 5:1 kids to adults. The age of these kids!? 3-6 years old. The rules and FAQs do specifically state that this experience is for older kids and adults. And sure enough... A kid is crying next to me while the mother yells at the poor staff member because her kid is too small and unable to activate the video sensors. 

For the price of $30 per person, and then paying $10 for parking... You too can enjoy crowded rooms full of snot nose kids, screaming parents, long lines to pathetic "experiences" and a marvel themed caf!!! 

... A kid just threw himself on the floor in crying hysterics next to me

NISHisHOT doesn't take shit from NOBODY.

NO body.

Especially at restaurants.

So if you want to offer a ginger infused lychee martini.  And it tastes like the vodka that comes straight out of my freezer.  Well . . . 

It SUCKS.  It gets it's ass sent back to the kitchen. 

And if you want to offer Mackerel on your sushi menu that's as stale as the Talk Threads on Yelp.  Well . . . 

It's UNACCEPTABLE.  It gets it's ass sent back to the kitchen.

But if you offer. . . tiradito and lobster and oysters and sashimi and black cod and lions and tigers and a baby gorilla (it's Vegas, baby.  Vegas) . . .   that break-dances on your tastebuds and plays the drumline on your tonsils.   

Well . . . It gets it's ass sent to my dancing buddha belly.  Happy buddha belly.

5 Stars.  A couple mishaps that got sent back to the kitchen and off the check.   But the other food more than made up for it.  Including the baby gorilla.  And the excellent, good looking service.

And about that check.  Well.  Shocking.  Stabbing.  No that's not my heart.  It's my wallet exploding.

So  . . . 5 Stars to my boyfriend for always knowing that I'm always better at being a drama mamma than ever paying for dinner.  

(Okay!  So I had to wash his underwear for a month.  It's Vegas, baby.  Vegas)

Three Square has to be in my top 3 favorite charities in Las Vegas. Their mission is simple, feed local families in need. At school, at home, at work, on weekends... Three Square is there to help feed members of the community. They are savvy enough to throw some great event while fund raising, so check out their website for upcoming events. Also take a look at the volunteer schedule. There are opportunities almost every day and it's an easy process to get a group signed up for a day of volunteering. The Yelp volunteer day was on a Thursday morning and we ended up packing weekend bags of food for children. It was an easy gig (there were children and seniors helping out) and overall we packed over 3200 weekend meals in about 2 hours. Not into volunteering? That's OK. This is one charity where your money is well spent if you feel like donating some green bills.

Considering the location of Bally's on the strip, it's pretty decent for the price you pay. This hotel is located right in the smack middle of the strip and is a short walking distance to most hotels. Back during the partying-on-a-budget days, my girlfriends and I would walk from Bally's all the way to Wynn/Encore in our FM heels with our classy red solo cups in hand no problem .

This hotel needs a renovation though! Some of the rooms still haven't even been upgraded to a flat-screen TV and the furniture is outdated.

The casino floor is chill and I love playing Wheel of Fortune in the "high limit slots" section. Let the dyke security guard strike up a conversation with you and she'll give you drink tickets for the bar :)

I never thought I would be thanking French colonialism for anything, but Vietnamese sandwiches are a really fucking good idea.

Buttered baguette topped with delightful roast pork, veggies, peppers and cilantro? Brilliant. Just $2.85? I'll take three. 

Plus, at Lee's, you can eat your tasty treat in an eerily efficient, sterile cafeteria. Trust me, it adds to the je ne sais quoi of the whole thing. Throw in a super-sweet, super-creamy iced coffee and a trip to Lee Lee afterward, and you've got yourself a pretty perfect afternoon.

So yeah, L'Indochine francaise may have set the stage for the Vietnam War. But it also gave us delectable sandwiches at low, low prices. Let's just call it even.

I don't tend to hate on other Yelper's reviews but really, how can you not give Le Vieux Montreal five stars?! I'm questioning your review skills all of yous who deemed this historic center and old port four stars. 

For those who've never been, Le Vieux Montreal is the old part of Montreal consisting of an area made up of cobblestone streets, amazing restaurants and ever so hip pubs and bars, the St. Lawrence River, museums, beautiful old churches, European architecture, art galleries, and so many more uncovered gems. I have spent days walking along these streets and enjoyed every second of it. I have yet to be during the summer but, even in dead of winter, with snow blanketing everything, and the cold numbing your face, I can't imagine a more special place in a North American city. You fall in love with everything around you. Yes, it can be touristy but, that's because it's f*%&$* amazing.

We dropped by here for an after dinner cafe.  I have been to Espressamente in Italy as well as here, and at the V.

I like the selection of cafes, sandwiches, crepes, macarons, desserts and gelato.  In addition, the Vegas locations are open until 1 am.  What I don't like are the prices.  A large cafe is $5, and it isn't that large.  Sandwiches are $10, crepes are $12, and the portions are not that large.

Nonetheless, you have to give Espressamente credit for its offerings which are quite extensive.  If there were one by my house, I would be a regular.  Plus, I love the color of the rainbow offerings w/ their gelato which I found to be very good on previous occasions.

Tickety Tacky in only the best way possible.  I actually really like this place.  The neon lights reminds me of my mothers make up in the 90's.

Nick the waiter was a sweetheart.  I am ridiculous in my requests sometimes, but he managed to cater to all of them.

The portions are huge!   My steak and spinach salad was delicious!  The steak was tender and medium rare just as I requested.  I asked for candied walnuts in it and Nick brought me a bowl of them!  That's what I call service.

Yes - Gabi K is reviewing a smoke shop on Yelp... 

Why? You ask?  Because I went in late Sunday night after the OYE and after our stop at Mojo, so Jared M could show me his old stomping grounds.  I guess he worked at this Trails back in the day.

While I'm not in the market for a pipe, specialty cigarettes, incense, blunt wraps, sexy costumes, rock t-shirts, etc... I had fun looking around for a few minutes.  I did not purchase anything, and I have no intention of returning anytime soon to do so.  But I guess if anyone is looking for any of the products I mentioned above, Trails is worth a visit.  I learned that they have around 10 valley locations too... 

I am sure someone out there will find this review useful?!

Happy Trails to you!

Well. Like Depends undergarments. 

Houston's. Solid. Dependable. And you know what? Damn tasty! Rickie and I had a pre Slumdog Millionaire lunch and shared the Hickory burger and the oh so famous spinach dip. First off, I have to say I forgot how much I LOVE the fries at Houston's. Totally my fave in all of fry land. The burger was cooked MW as Rickie requested and come out MW. I'm more of a MR kinda guy, but even at MW, this burger did not disappoint. 

Service is really great. We all know that. It was less robotic than I remember and for that I was grateful. God, I hate those forced, learned corporate bullshit greetings! Ugh...folks here seemed to actually have their own personality! Wow. Thank you Stepford Houston's. Have you loosened that Bolo tie recently?

The crowd was uncanny for a Sunday afternoon. Rickie asked me if there was a hooker convention in town! Seriously. It was like a slut buffet parading around. 

Thanks Houston's. Good to know we can depend on you still.

Absinthe comes highly recommended! Quite possibly one of the best (and most affordable) shows on the strip.

This cabaret style show is the perfect balance of cirque (and by cirque I mean circus), comedy and variety show. The Gazillionaire is your Master of Ceremonies / ringleader for the evening. You'll come to love the grease and slime of his swagger. And his sidekick Penny Pibbets is so cute and adorable the sexual outbursts won't bother you a bit. The execution of all the curse words, sexual innuendos, racist jokes and back flips is so entertaining you won't find it the least bit offensive. And if you do--too bad. Your not getting your money back so you should probably mope back to your hotel room and grow a sense of humor.

On top of the laughs, the flippy bits and various circus acts are thoroughly entertaining. However, there was a strange one involving Angel Porrino and a bubble that I couldn't quite wrap my head around. I've seen the show thrice and I look forward to all the outlandish wackiness every time I go. (Thanks to my friends for hooking it up with tickets) but I would pay actual dinero to see this show myself. Its under $100 and probably the best bang for your buck show on the strip. Suitable for both men and women. Maybe not mom & dad--unless you just hang with your parents like that.

This is entertainment gold my friends. If you can only see one show in Vegas, see Absinthe. As long as you're not wicked conservative or shudder at the slightest bit of obscenity, i.e. a total prude, you will thoroughly enjoy yourself and laugh for so long  you'll waltz out of here with aching abs and lifted spirits.

This review could go either way. Part of me wants to give it 5 stars...but in the interest of helping people, I had to be honest, not ironic :-(

This joint is FABULOUSLY atmospheric if you're looking for a place to settle down for a crack binge...or if, as I was, you are looking for a gross, shitty motel room in which to do a photo shoot. But if you're just looking for a clean, safe place to stay in Vegas....there are plenty of vastly superior options -- and for cheaper, too!

CONS: As the other reviewers mention, the place is shitty, roach-infested, grungy and in a crummy part of town populated by crackheads and whores (and people who "smoke pots"). The a/c units wheeze and groan and don't fit properly; the doorknobs are loose, and the bathrooms are pretty janky.

PROS: The place has history -- it's been around since the 1940s or so, and thousands of wads have been blown in its hallowed rooms. And that's just since June!! 

The best part about the Desert Moon Motel is, the TVs in the rooms offer FREE 24-hour XXX movies. During my brief one-hour stay (one of MANY brief, one-hour stays in its history, LOL), the TV happened to be showing a clown (in full circus regalia) fingerbanging an Asian chick with a full, 1980s bush. At the end, instead of jizzing on her....he covered her bush with Silly String!!!!!!

I just don't see getting that kind of ambiance at the Bellagio. I mean, there's dancing fountains.....and then there's jizzing clowns. 

Which would YOU prefer?!!

Hands down best dim sum in the Valley. I've taken different groups of friends here on EVERY Sunday in the past two months, skipping only Easter, and have eaten like it's my last meal on Earth every time. All of my friends including Alex loved it and agree that it's the best dim sum in town right now. It's totally worth it even with the long drive from North Scottsdale and ridiculous weekend highway closures. Looks like I might be there again next Sunday...

This is your typical Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen gas station location, but serving up some decent chicken. 

There isn't a great many free standing Popeye's locations here in the Valley, while it's former corporate sister Church's, seem to have nothing but free standing places. 

I have a friend who use to own two franchises in the Midwest back in the day. He and everyone who ever met Popeye's founder, Al Copeland thought the world of him. Copeland had this NOLA style, Horatio Alger story. Rags to riches, back to rags... well, not quite.  But in the end, Copland had enough to leave a bunch of money to LSU.  Not bad for a high school dropout.

The secret, as most Popeye aficionados will tell you, is to come here when they are running special. Like Tuesdays, when the special is 2 pieces of chicken, biscuit and a drink for $3.99. Otherwise, it can be just as expensive as the Colonels' place. But Popeye's chicken is better!  

Oh, how I miss the MSG laced Cajun Sparkle.  It was better than coffee. LOL. Three Stars, A-Okay.

Winter in Phoenix, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. When I am sweating in 120 degree summer weather, I think longingly to the 7 months out of the year that are a delicious 75 degrees. 

I love the smell of winter in Phoenix, yes the smell. It smells like orange blossoms and this perfume scent surprises me with every twist and turn. 

While I hate how they drive (can we please have a driving lane designated for snow birds?), I love how they make the streets come alive and make the businesses, events and festivals come together for entertainment of every shape and size. 

I love that I can wear sundresses in December. 

I love how I can climb Camelback Mountain in the dead of winter wearing nothing but shorts and a light pullover. 

I love all the events that happen, including the Fiesta Bowl, WM Open, Barrett Jackson and Spring Training. 

I love waking up in the morning and opening up my doors to a fresh breeze and birds chirping. 

I love that I can host parties on my patio in December. 

I love that I can read a book on my patio in December. 

I don't live the cost of living in the winter, but I do love that because of the tourist population in the winter months, the resorts can offer steal of deals in the summer for their loyal locals. 

I don't care what your opinion of Phoenix is. This city has amazing weather the majority of the year, tourists flock here to visit and we have every type of terrain just a drive away. #liveandlovelocal

Since I'm in a Eugene O'Neill frame of mind, I'm going to title this review as "A Moon for the Misbegotten."

In my review of our return flight from BOS, initially on American and ultimately US Air to PHX, I called it: "A Long  Days Journey into Night."  That was due to the scheduling mishap and "equipment issues" experienced on that trip. We were moved from a connecting flight on American, to a non-stop on US Air

After arriving in PHX, our bags were somehow where misplaced.  The AA folks in BOS promised they would get word down stairs to the baggage handlers to move it over to US Air.  Well, we arrived on time, but with no bag in the carousel as you would say.

The nice thing about traveling today, as opposed to twenty years ago is all the technology the airlines use.  They were able to locate our bag, since it was scanned in our original connecting airport of DFW. Wow. But, they weren't sure where it was just now. Ugh.

They took all our information and promised they would find it and deliver it to our front door. Hmmm I thought, but they were very reassuring and sincere about it.  So yesterday around four o'clock our doorbell rang and yes, there was our bag.  Looking no worse for it's side trip to DFW.  

But now we have a mystery.  Why did our bag have a United Airlines tag, over the original American Airlines one?  Sometimes, life is about not asking too many questions! LOL

The Arizona Railway Museum is a fun afternoon for kids all ages.  That includes those who ask for Senior Citizens discounts!

If you have ever been to other railway museums like Union Illinois, the setup here at Arizona Railway Museum is similar, though more modest. They have a very large collection of rolling stock. Along with one of the largest Union Pacific fleets outside of a UP's train yard. It's a very impressive and kids get to have an up close, hands on experience!

As I mentioned in my Yelp Tip, admission is a reasonable $2.00 and they're only opened on weekends, from Noon until 4:00 pm. The gift store is also well stocked with train magazines, train whistles, old time engineer hats and other collectibles. 

What's really nice are all the enthusiasts who volunteer here who are willing to share their love for trains, along with the history of railroading. 

When you are done, plan to stop at Roy's Train World. http://www.yelp.com/biz/roys-train-world-mesa#hrid:hwZIL_Nby6LbKvw6paeUQw  It's just a few short miles up the road, at 1033 S Country Club Drive in Mesa. They carry various HO, O and N gauge models of everything you'll see here 

BTW, don't forget to bring your camera.

Enjoy!

Jack Black may be known for the "Get That Corn Outta My Face!" meme, where he slaps two ears on a stick from Esqualito's hands.  It was probably because Hector scored the offending vegetable from America's Taco Shop, which has an embarrassingly bad rendition of this barrio sensation.

I shall be known as the "Get That Corn Inta My Face!" guy, after ordering elote from the Joyride app offering.  I am the Albexican, and know good corn Mexican.  Yeah that rhymed, I do it all the timed!

Another win for the vegetarians comes in the Garden Variety Burrito, enchilada style... sawed in half, with competing red and green sauces covering each dismemberment.  Snicker's could never satisfy like this

Lil tip... when you order, say, a... pineapple auga fresca... drink it quickly.  If you let it sit, the ice will melt, and you'll end up with a watered down agua fresca... and your heart will be sad.

Finally, and potentially the most important aspect (depending on if you're actively on laxatives or not)... the bathroom scene.  Let's taco bout it.

There's three doors.  Choose wisely, don't doddle.

1. Guys & Gals (The most spacious of the three.  Like driving a Chevrolet Cordova)
2. Gals & Guys (This is the middle child... we'll call it Jan Brady)
3. Gals  (VERY CRAMPED... because gals get cramps?  I dunno...)

Really gays? What has happened to us? We've become so serious. So mainstream. So. Oh dear. How do I say this...so, so heterosexual! GASP! 

Strollers. Parents. Pets. Lacoste shirts. Topsiders. Soccer moms. Soccer dads. And in my best Sarah Palin voice, "Joe 6 packs". Just normal folks don't ya know. You betcha. 

Where are the inappropriately dressed men in Speedos, glitter and nipple tassels? Dykes on bikes? Minors tripping on E? What has happened to our luster people? Have we become....um, boring? 

Well, I"m not sure. But the Rainbows Festival is darn fun. A small town feel, in a lovely urban setting, filled with the usual food vendors, t-shirts booths and local organizations hawking their wares and services. But overall, the genuine feeling of fun, love and celebration permeated this event. 

Lots of smiles, hugs and waves. And yes, lots of families of all types. And, really, that is what it's all about right. We noshed on turkey legs, tacos and swilled Bud and fruity vodka drinks. Ten bucks to park, but free to get in. How cute and small town is that? Well, not the parking maybe. But who doesn't love a free party? 

Rickie and I had a blast and at the end of our Rainbow, we found a bag full of condoms, lube and free minutes for a gay sex site. Ahhh, my people! Girls and gays just wanna have fun! See ya next year. And don't forget the nipple clamps!

I like this park. Rickie hit a home run in this park. Just. For. Me. 

I like this park. It has trees for shade. Though I would like this park more if they had WAY more trees. I would like this park more if the concrete bleachers were covered. And how about some hot dog vendors!? Beer? The ice cream guy just wasn't cutting it!

I like this park because softball wives are allowed in the dugout during the game. Yep. Covered. With a bench. Cold water. Ha! All the saps out in the sun, melting like Melanie Griffith's face. 

Really though the road leading to this park is pretty ghetto and lined with trailer parks, piles of cars and piles of tires. So I was not looking forward to the park. What a surprise. Very clean. HUGE. Great parking. Restrooms...not too bad...I mean it's not The Plaza but there was soap and working hand dryers. 

I like Cesar Chavez Park. I'm returning Sunday. Where Rickie will hit yet another home run. Just. For. Me.

It was a spur of the moment thing and happy that it happened! I met up with Rand H, Norm R & Scott W to try the Reign of Thai buffet on a Sunday afternoon.

Every item in the buffet looked delish and fresh,  I tried a variety of things and enjoyed them all, egg rolls, chicken won tons, pad thai, beef massaman curry, chicken pangang curry just to name a few.   Massaman curry is my favorite curry, and normally I chose chicken but the beef was good too!

Service was friendly and learned from the server that it was her aunt and uncle who cooked all the dishes.

Sundays buffet was 10.99 and it is very much worth the price! If I am ever in the area again you bet I will be back!

Here are a few of my favorite Timo things:
~ The brunch flat bread ($10): bacon, eggs, burrata - the crust has the perfect, ever-so-slight salty crunch that is perfectly complimented by the toppings. I would eat this for breakfast, lunch OR dinner!
~ The mimosa flight: a steal at $9 with samples of orange, grapefruit and cranberry & St. Germain. Shockingly (to me anyway), my favorite is the grapefruit!
~ La fin du monde golden (beer -9% alc.) $6 here, now also found in my fridge at home! Thanks for the introduction!!
~ The day drinker ($9) a magical grapefruit flavored adult beverage and the Irish Sour ($): trust, don't be afraid of the egg white. ($6 at Happy Hour!)
~ That they're always cooking up different things in the wood fired oven - from bacon and eggs to fish and lasagna! 

These are just a few... there's a lot to love about Timo!

Ever had a piece of Broccoli that made you re-evaluate the vegetable entirely? Well I did, and I bought it from Phx Pub Mrkt. Beautiful verdant luscious dark green colour, crunchy savory and earthy, it even kept in my fridge far longer than I'd have figured an organic piece of Broccoli bought in an open air market should've kept. This broccoli made me a believer in this place. Nowadays I only shop for my seasonal fruits and veggies here, and the fact it's within walking distance from my shack only gives me further incentive. The market itself is not too big, they offer some hippie entrees at a lunch counter made by kids with tattoos and piercings and humble courteous faces. The veggies, fruits, and most of the merchanise is eihter a.)local b.)organic c.) expensive or d.)all of the above. However I love everything this market stands for and is trying to accomplish, I can only sing it's praises and shell money at it, hoping it grows into the little shop of horrors it was meant to be- with giant 7 foot anthropomorphized campy Little Richard like broccoli heads with a taste for blood and musicals.

Oh Capriotti's make your way across the Pacific Ocean so I can eat a Capastrami again!!

Being in Las Vegas and craving for a solid pastrami sammie I ask Elite Bruddah Nelson Q. for the go to place. I already have been to Rocco's Deli (another suggested place by Nelson) and wanting to try something a little different Capriotti's was my choice.
We arrived to a clean small eatery with a simple menu, the smallest Sub is a 9 inch.

Nothing wurst than a bad weenie. No bun intendend. But every so often I get a hankering for a hot dog. A Chicago hot dog at that. In the windy city at Milwaukee and Devon sits SuperDawg and it is a site to behold. But I ain't in the Windy City. I'm in the Hot Blistering Sweltering City. And I didn't know where to go. And then I drove down Thomas and saw the Vienna Beef sign! That was it. That's what I needed. The universe had answered my calling. You ever enter a restaurant and immediately have the instinct that you should turn your ass around and leave quickly. Yea. Well I didn't listent to my gut. Cuz it was rumbling with hunger and I could smell the hot dogs steaming. The place wasn't clean. Ok, it was dirty. Stained floors, rec room style paneling with splintering chunks of wood and vinyl chairs with duct tape. Hmmm...still not enough for me. So I get home with my Chicago style dog, with pepperoncini, neon relish, celery salt, tomatoes in a soft poppy seed bun with krinkle fries. Ate it in 90 seconds. Spent the next 40 minutes in my bathroom. You get the picture. Thank God for that Reader's Digest I found under the sink cuz I would have been real bored.

If I could give a zero star I would.

I have NEVER been so discriminated in my life at any business until I went here. I went with a group of friends to check out their nightclub and upon entrance the bouncer pulled me aside asked me my name where I lived then ACCUSED me of being on drugs cause my eyes were big. I have natural big eyes. Next he ACCUSED me of being too fucked up and I can never enter the club again. I was sober and told him to breathalyze me or do a drug test and I'll test negative. He refused and just kicked me out. He said I was walking weird, I'm pidgeon toed! He was then mocking me with my big eyes by opening his eyes wide and talking really slowly like as if I'm stupid. 

I have never ever felt so discriminated. Hakkasan ruined my experience and I am NEVER coming back here. If you're in vegas looking for a club to enter please go to Marquee or XS. This club needs to enforce better bouncers.

The head  baker here is a bad  mutha--shut yo mouth!!! 
I was referred here by an unnamed source who decided they'd had enough of me and my so called diet and boy was this a diet buster
First off, the thing that impressed me out of nowhere was the tres leches. Usually buying tres leches from somewhere other than a Mexican bakery usually ends in a sugary wet disaster, but when they pulled it off, I knew we could be in business

The cream of the crop, at least to me were the mini pies. I always love eating pies by myself so making one smaller was only the next logical step, and I must say it almost brought a tear to my eye. Me and my food brother took bites out our pies and then gave each other that look that only a fellow secret food beast will understand. Needless to say those pies went off to the great bakery in the sky
Long story short, get here, eat some pastries then walk out like a boss

The one thing I love about coming to Crate & Barrel, is to watch them wrap things!

Someone told me that there's an old Jimmy Fallon skit, called Crate in a Barrel.  It purports to show the OCD lengths employees go to wrap something, so it will not break on your way home.  I love the concept.  I only wish we've had movers over the years who showed the same skill set.

This store is one of their modern two story varieties, with bedding and furniture downstairs,  Upstairs, they have a wedding planners dream.  Or, is it a Bride's dream list.  No matter, they have an electronic wedding registry here.  All very cool if you are planning your big day, or if you want to restock the kitchen or house after the kids moved out.  LOL

They have glassware, stemware, plates, dishes, knives, runners for the table and just about every kitchen gadget known.  I love their soups in a box, sauces and the mojito starter kit.  Just add crushed mint leaves.  Last week we purchased some closeouts. The pickup door is located conveniently outside near the Starbucks.

"You cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass." - Isoroku Yamamoto

All the men that work here have served their country. Tip them well! 

70 years after D-Day I came here to celebrate my daughter's high school graduation. I opted for the D-day package while my daughter had the G.I. Jane. 

We were picked up by an authentic military humvee. No A/C but I was told by the mid of June all the humvees will have doors, a roof, and A/C. The driver and my trainer were beyond courteous and very welcoming. The training is thorough and you are given the opportunity to load and cock your own weapon. In addition, the trainer makes sure there are plenty of photo ops. You can also take pics with the helicopter and vehicles outside. 

When I think of World War 2, "Saving Private Ryan" and "Pearl Harbor" come to mind. So many have made the ultimate sacrifice. Their weapons have always fascinated me and in this moment I was able to shoot the same weapons our American soldiers used to fight the Germans and Japanese. The M1 Garand is an amazing rifle. Plenty of power and by far my favorite weapon because of it's historic value and accuracy. I got all head shots! The Thompson looks so easy in the movies. But once you pull that trigger and let the auto loose you are spraying the target. Oh what a blast that was! 

My daughter did well. Head shots and red targets. Her favorite was the Colt M4 because of the scope and it reminded her of playing call of duty. 

The weapon selection is extensive. P90, MP5, ACR, Scar, MG, and so on and so on. There's so many to choose from! There are about a dozen packages available. Even one for the kids with weapons using .22. I can't wait to come back and try a .50 sniper rifle. This is a definite adrenaline rush and an experience you can't miss! Boom!

We never would have gone in here if we had any idea.  Seriously.

Corporate Suits in town wanted to take a few folks from my office to lunch and chose this place.  There's an hour of my life I'll never get back.  Seriously.

This place makes Hooters look very upscale and classy.  Seriously.  

And the food.  Huge burgers and fries are the only choices.  The burgers?  Think Encore Frozen Salisbury Steaks on a bun.  Seriously.

We left with the unanimous agreement that none of us would ever see the inside of this place again.

OK. This is it people. This is why we are here. Right? This is the time of year we phone relatives back home, donned in flip flops, board shorts and Ray Bans. We say things like, "Ohhhh, I forgot it's 32 degrees, snowing, sleeting and you have dark dismal clouds looming overhead." "I'm by the pool flipping burgers in my new swim suit I got at Marshall's" (ok, I wouldn't reveal that, I would say Saks 5th Ave., but work with me people!). Even though we're still "struggling" with these unseasonal temps (a la upper 80s's), our relatives, friends and family we left behind are snuckering down (did I say snuckering?) in their moon boots and parkas. Us? We? We're still chillin' in our favorite T's, shorts and sandals. The point for this review? Hmmmm. to review us. To review the weather. And the jab at the rest of the good ole US of A. I know Phoenix is waiting for a heartbeat. I know there are newbies who don't get us yet. And that's ok.  I feel the energy of the desert. I feel the energy of a new city emerging from the ashes. I feel the uncomfortableness from this nasty ass IKEA chair on my butt. While I know it's time to sign off and find comfort elsewhere, I just had to say....I LOVE Phoenix and if you don't, go somewhere else, drop the negativity and find your mojo within yourself!

Beautiful & Hella Crowded!  But Wait!  Now With FREE WiFi!

SITREP

I did NOT want to be here.  I kept wondering, "Where is Mr. Rogers?  This is NOT my neighborhood!!!"

THE SETUP

I was on a Spokane to Sacramento trip...BY WAY OF FUC'n PHOENIX!  "Way to add 5 hours to a 2 hour flight, SouthWest!"  But it's kinda hard to blame the lovely Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport that turn of events.

[And in the end, it was even hard to get angry at SouthWest since they DID have the courtesy to take us right smack over the top of the Grand Canyon - a sight I'd never seen before - so THAT in itself was an ironic treat.  "Hey Mom!  Yeah, I know I was going to Sacramento, BUT guess what?  I saw the Grand Canyon too!"  Now THAT doesn't happen every day.]

AIRPORT METRICS

Sky Harbor is such a beautiful, large airport, with lots of different terminals, lots of different automatic walkways, and - get this - LOTS of Laptop Bar & Stool set-ups.  During my 2 1/2 hour layover, where I also switched planes, I got to charge my laptop, my camera, my iPhone, and my external battery charger:  I was set!

WIFI

Free!  That's all I need to say!  I was able to connect quickly and upload all of those pictures I had just taken of the grand canyon to Flickr, Yelp and Facebook.  I also did some blogging to boot.

IN SUM

I have no idea what the traffic was like to get to the airport... since I landed there.

I have no idea what the parking situation was like at the airport... since I landed there.

I have no idea what the TSA Checkpoint situation is like at this airport since....yeah, you guessed it, I LANDED there.

But you know what?  As a guest of the airport who galavorted from one terminal to another terminal as a transfer to catch my next flight, it was not a bad deal.

THE LOWDOWN

The Sky Harbor Airport makes for a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

Can't wait to come back to Vintage 95 for a date night!

Very romantic atmosphere, lots of comfy furniture, and live music on weekends.

Sarah R. and I tried a glass of the Coto de Hayas from Spain. Believe it was the Tempranillo Cabernet? Memory a little hazy, this was our last stop after a night of drinks. 

Would totally order the bottle, though. 

Their wine selection is pretty extensive, lots of $5/glass options, and I know within a certain timeframe, you get a charcuterie board if you purchase a bottle. 

Full bar for all those that aren't wine lovers. 

Throw this one in your back pocket for date night, guys!

Forget the fireman.

All I want all night every night is the MILK MAN!! 

No joke... the milk man was HOT! And it wasn't the bangin' body I was digging, it was his smile (*wink, wink*).

I've been to a few male reviews in Vegas and I'd have to say this one is my favorite so far. The guys are super cute and pretty personal! Plus they're all really from down under and have the cute accent! 

Highlights for me included:
* The bar with really stiff drinks and drink specials! 
* The milk man
* The Birthday Girl (my friend) going up on stage
* The milk man
* The group pictures where we made them do asian poses! 
and of course

We came here last evening to listen to that great voice which is Mandy Patinkin. Wow it was even better than we could have imagined.

His vocal range is incredible. He started with some old old Broadway tunes from the 40s and 50s. Then moves on and starts softly speaking these words without music:

Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see

So you say to yourself. No!  He's not going to sing it. And, he doesn't. He just leads into the middle of another old Broadway tune. So you think, what was that?  Well, it was a tease. 

He starts having a dialogue with the audience about his marriage and wife.  But then comes back to it. Now accompanied by Paul Ford on the piano. He sings the entire song. Bohemian Rhapsody. All the parts. Wow! Freddie Mercury would have been proud!

That's how the evening went. Interspacing old show tunes with some more recent melodies.  He sang a few from Steven Sondheim's "Sundays in the Park with George".  It was a show he was nominated for a Tony.  The best of the night, was his singing of Oh Shenandoah. What made it special was his stopping midway to recite the first part of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. He goes back to Oh Shenandoah, then finishes the second half of Gettysburg Address and the last verse of Oh Shenandoah. Absolutely beautiful.

Surprisingly no tunes from Evita. A show he won the Tony for his role of Che, and made famous with Patti Lepone.  He finished the evening with a tune from the movie Ragtime and the music of Randy Newman. 

There were two curtain calls. He and his pianist Paul Ford looked exhausted after a non-stop ninety minutes. We left feeling as if we had just enjoyed something special. This was our first time to the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts and we were very impressed.

"....and I think to myself, what a wonderful world." - "What a Wonderful World",- Louie Armstrong

Great show by a talented performer!

I watched the beginning of Terry Fator's meteoric rise to Las Vegas headliner on America's Got Talent several years ago.  To describe Terry - he is a singing impressionist ventriloquist comedian.  He does spot-on impersonations & sings better via ventriloquism than others do through their own accord.  It was w/ great anticipation that I finally caught his Vegas show in his very own theatre.

To be frank, this show may be not be everyone's cup of tea.  He is, after all, using puppets.  However, I'm a big fan!  His impressions of past & present performers, such as Cher, Dean Martin, Stevie Wonder & Adele are brilliant.  His comedy sketches are witty & current.  I thought it may have became a little edgy for some w/ one of his puppets "coming out the closet", but I thought it was hilarious.

Terry also sings a few original songs sans puppets during the show.  One entitled "Horses in Heaven" & the other a tribute to the troops.  "Horses in Heaven" is based on a true story of a child w/ cancer.  He mentioned to the audience that the Las Vegas powers that be thought  the song was too heavy & not appropriate for a Vegas show during it's development.  He defied the powers that be, and I enjoyed the song, which made me think of my own experience w/ cancer.  

Our show just happened to be the very one that surpassed 1 million guests to see Terry Fator's Vegas show.  Even better, everyone in attendance received a Terry Fator reusable bag w/ the following contents-

Terry Fator playing cards
2 for 1 at Mirage's Cravings buffet
$10 Free Slot Play w/ the Mirage Player's Card

I took that $10 Free Slot Play & magically turned it into $66 on a $1 slot machine!  Oh yeah, I'm good :)
It was my last night in Vegas, and capped an already great trip.

I highly recommend catching Terry Fator's show at the Mirage during your next trip to Vegas.  I laughed, I was moved & I had an absolute great time.

Excelsior!

I use to come down to Coolidge quite a bit and one of the cool things I use to do was come over here and visit the ruins.  A great piece of Arizona history!  Do you remember the Five C's?  Well, this is cotton country.

The Park Rangers will tell you they don't really know how old the ruins are, but most guess at around 600 years plus.  But thanks to a forward thinking US Government, the ruins are now protected by a 70 foot high shelter.  Trust me, it comes in handy in July and August, the two months I seem to visit here most.  LOL.  I would also recommend a visit to the bookstore.  It stocks a variety of First Nation history, as well as info on the area.

http://www.nps.gov/cagr/index.htm

While you are in Coolidge, I would recommend the Gallopin' Goose for drinks or bar food, and Tag's for dinner.  Both are great!

What happened to you, Rain!? You're like a celebrity, once glamorous and incredibly popular, but that has fallen into obscurity. You used to be the posh spot, the happenin' talk of the town... but now you're overused, dirty, discarded. 

This review is long overdue and almost joined Rain by also falling into obscurity.

The layout is still cool, the music still poppin', but never in my life have I come across SO MANY ROAMING HANDS in one place. How shady can a place be such that at least 75% of the male population is trying to violate the females?!? I'd be dancing and suddenly a hand had appeared up my skirt and all the way up my thigh. I immediately moved away and noticed my lady friends were undergoing the same horror from other men. 

I was uncomfortable on the dance floor, and that NEVER happens. I love to dance and meet people and have a great time, but I'm not about to put myself out there for THAT. Gross!

Let's just say I won't be back. Ever. Unless they have a successful Perv Purge movement.

DATE TIP: Fellas, let me break it down for you. Women typically don't appreciate random hands up their skirts. At least buy them a drink first! Ha.

Good lunch option for Vegas! 

We started with the Japanese Wagyu Gyoza and all I can say is, wow! This little pockets pack a ton of flavor. I kind of wanted to order another round but I refrained. 

The yellowtail sashimi tiradito was also wonderful. Thick slices of fish came in a bed of lemongrass and jalapeno sauce. 

The let down were the rolls. We ordered the green envy and the lima and both were a little weird. I'd say avoid the rolls. The flavors were just off and coming from LA where you can find fantastic rolls at many places, I wouldn't order rolls at Sushi Samba again. 

The place was packed so service was a bit spotty, but I'd come back again and stick to the tiraditos and gyoza.

As one of my fave English bands, ABC says, "It's so hip, so hip it hurts"...hurts...but in a good way. Like a naughty spanking. Not a big toe contusion hurt. First off, this place smelled delightful, like vanilla and lavender with a little Nag Champa thrown in...no weird old Auntie's closet smell here! We were greeted by a young Carol Burnett look alike which is awesome! Especially since Carol Burnett grew up in Hollywood and went to Hollywood High School.  But the flow of the store and the quality of their wares is top drawer! 

Overall, very well organized. Good flow. Did I mention it smells good? Amazing selection of purses. No, I'm not looking to buy a purse. I'm a he man after all. I just thought some were so cute I wanted to squeeze them. Um. Anyway. The mens section is not bad, lots of XL and not so much small  though...wondering who sold them these clothes? Big, brawny bowlers? Not sure.

And for you nun collectors, you can't miss out on an entire area of nun bric a brac! Very fun! Like book stores, card shops and Hello Kitty Conventions, I could spend hours in here! 

Hollywood was my home for many years. Great to have some of the glam and glitz here in Phoenix!

While I don't think there is a river or a mirage anywhere near this place, there does always seem to a large puddle of water in the parking lot. At least I think there is, unless, it's a mirage. Hmmm...What isn't a mirage is a restaurant full of local Latino families and a sea of blue haired, varicose veined, AARP folks from Sun City. I should know. Cuz my Sun City living mom and dad love Rio Mirage. This is where me and mom let loose and bond over a couple margs. While dad sips his ice tea and flirts with the waitress. I've had good luck ordering the same thing here. Carne Asada with beans and tortillas. I kinda put the steak in the tortilla, roll it up with some fixins. Chew. Smile. Chug more margarita. Mom loves the grilled quesadilla and dad's finicky ordering style is accommodated with "ground beef tacos. Hard. Nothing fancy." We always get great service and I love the local vibe. And the margarita buzz gets me through an entire game of bridge with Big Daddy and Momma Jo!

All I kept thinking about when I stepped into Zia Records was, like Wow... they've taken a 60's head shop and mixed it with a record store and POOF!  "Let's Do The Time Warp Again!"

The Zia chain is a used Record/ CD/ DVD/ Book/ Speaker shop that has incense burning to set the mood. I would imagine, though I didn't ask, that you could purchase rolling paper here too. So I began to wonder where are they hiding Bill and Ted as I walked around the store?  LOL

Don't get me wrong, I really like the concept and the prices seemed pretty good. If I was going off to college again, besides IKEA this would definitely make my list. This is a Geeks, Geek place. 

They have dorm posters and lots of cool toys from TV's past and present.  Everything from the robot from "Lost in Space"(photos), to a fairly large statues of Leonard Nimoy's Spock, both Matt Smith's and David Tennant's "Dr Who, as well as bendable toy figures from CBS's "Big Bang Theory". And yes, they have both Penny and Leonard. But let's not go there okay! LOL

So yes, I'm a Fan of Zia Records, and yes I'll be back. Now where did I leave my Tardis?  Beam me up Scott D!

I'm not going to lie, I think I prefer the rival of Coca-Cola but my dad and my brothers are big Coca-Cola fanatics.  Whenever I stop into Sin City and my dad's birthday, Father's Day, or Christmas is coming up, I'll stop in and see what else I can add to his crazy collection.

Connected to M&M's World, Coca-Cola offers all sorts of wondrous items.  They have playing cards, piggy banks, the cutest and softest polar bear plushies, and other items you never knew you needed.  For example, I have a swanky Coca-Cola bottle opener magnet on my fridge as we speak!  Does it work well?  Sorta.  Did I badly need it when I saw it?  You betcha!

They also have an Around the World soda selection upstairs that I haven't tried yet but I really want to.  You can also take a souvenir picture with a polar bear mascot for a price unless you use your camera/phone but all you get is a green screen backdrop.  Want more fun?  Too bad.  That's pretty much all there is to the World of Coca-Cola.

Stop in and take a gander!  There's lots to see and touch and if anything, you can buy yourself a nice cold soda while walking The Strip to give your poor liver a break.  Mmm, Fanta!

Just moved into the area and went to this location. It was so busy but staff was very helpful as I'm not used to this store and couldn't find the things I usually get. One time I went to another store and there was a demo of waffles with pomegranate seeds and yoghurt on it.  At this store there was a  sample with Belgian waffles, strawberries, and whipped cream...delicious!  So I bought the waffles and they were so cheap! I also love their Mediterranean feast meal. They have so many different items and prices are very reasonable. I find that I go to Trader Joe's a lot because of the variety of products and the atmosphere. I highly recommend Trader Joe's.

Well of course you're named after a Saint. After all, you are simply heavenly! I LOVED my visit to St. Francis. Just like I loved the first year of Charlie's Angels when Farrah was on. Just like I loved Chachi and not Joanie. Just like I love smooth and not chunky. I was honored to have a tour of St. Francis by Mr. Aaron Chamberlain himself. He pointed out the architectural details and history of his career. Right down to family serving spoons used in his grandparents restaurant embedded in to the brick near the front door. The sleek, glass garage door which opens up to Camelback. If you're sitting outside you have a panoramic view of the interior and if you're inside you get a bird's eye view of the street scape. 

The second story (which is in limbo and awaiting a mural and a more defined purpose) is structurally held in place by a "V" shaped collection of steel rods...unfreakinreal! The birch floors on the stairs, the gravel on the patio, the maple beams, the seemless glass front table...I'm having an interior design orgasm! 

Oh. The food? Yep! Yummers! Thin crust pizzas with a airy, pillow crust...tried an arrugula za and had one with figs! The signature salad with a homemade buttermilk dressing (DON'T THINK RANCH!)...it's so much more and the goat cheese brulee made my mouth, my tummy and my soul very happy! You can feel the love from the kitchen as well as an attentive, enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff.

You're like my foodie angel, arriving in CenPho to save fme rom Applebee's and Sweet Tomatoes! I say Halo St. Francis. Halo and welcome to the hood!

Outstanding cuts from a true artisan butcher shop.  

The high fell below 95, it's time to grill.  Yelp ROTD to the rescue.  The Butcher Block.  USDA prime, wet aged selections including a great boneless NY strip, and filet, and outstanding porterhouse.  All are very well trimmed and tender.  They also offer butcher cuts (sirloin and flat iron steaks).  Good beefy flavor.

Dry aged selections are OK but lacking the deep flavor expected of a craft aging room  Mild umame and nutty flavor.  Not too pronounced.   Good fat and marbling.  UDSA prime rib eye aging so subtle the flavor is robbed by the charcoal grill

Pass on the American Kobe style wagyu.  All cut totally miss the mark in fat content, marbling, looks and most importantly, flavor.

Lamb; great selection of chops, tenderloins, legs, shanks, Frenched racks, and ground lamb.  Good strong lamb flavor throughout.   

They do offer frozen, the game meats: antelope, buffalo rib eyes, chuck roast, burgers, rack of elk, elk tenderloins,  quail, wild duck, rabbit, venison, gator, wild boar.  Beyond the scope of this grilling session.  Will update after trying a few.

Finally their home made sausage.  Just get them and try them.  Flavorful, well seasoned.  Excellent.

Fair prices (better than Whole Foods).  Call ahead to avoid disappointment

A foodie and griller's heaven.

The chef bangs the bell and then everyone yells PAELLA!!!!!!

And with that, I knew the "Arroz Con Costillas De Cerdo Ibrico De Bellota" (made with the ribs of the famous, black-footed Ibrico de bellota pigs of Spain) was ready and would be coming my way any minute.  The paella was rich, flavorful and I gnawed on every rib until nothing was left.  

I semi contemplated another order but then the manicotti/lasagnaesque/alfredoey pork and foie gras canelones with bechamel sauce shut me the heck up :)  My wife wasn't a fan of because it was too cheesy and creamy but I am down for anything foie gras related.  

The seared fresh squid with squid ink sauce, artichokes and pearl onions was delectable.  Nice presentation!  It's rare for a place to serve the whole squid with innards and all.  I initially thought it was stuffed and couldn't put my finger on what was in it until our friendly server informed us.  I'd totally have squid ink as a hot beverage by the way.   

Bottom line is I need to come back here with a bigger group to sample more stuff like a heckuvalot more black foot pig.  If they ever make Pulp Fiction 2, Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace might have a discussion over the $20 gin and tonics.  Oh wait, he was killed.  Nevermind.  I am ready to go to "e" asap!

Mama Gump had the right idea when she said, "Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get." 

What would've been more helpful advice though, is what to do when your Fido EATS the box of chocolates. YES. I came home one night to find my dog curled up in bed after having YOLO'ed way too hard over an entire box. As in, more than one piece. 

So what's a concerned pet owner to do? 

1. Panic. 
2. Google "Fatality rates for dogs after eating chocolate." 
3. Call a friend. When he says this has never happened to his dog, panic more.
4. Consult Yelp for a 24-hour vet.
5. Drive like a maniac. 

I called ahead to see if I could get a ballpark on the service, but without seeing my canine, it was pretty up in the air. The vet was quick to explain the what they had done - induce vomiting, give him painkillers, etc., then walk me through what to expect during recovery, leaving me much more at ease. 

More than $100+ later, I learned my lesson that my pet sure loves instant gratification. I'm pretty sure he learned his too - THE MORNING AFTER SUCKS LIKE A MOFO.

A Geno's cheese steak.  A pastrami from Katz Deli.  A French dip from Philippe's.  A brisket and tongue from Carnegie Deli.  A godmother from Bay Cities Italian Deli.  A "Fluff and Nutt" from the Goodwich.  

Unfair compression?  If you're going to charge me $3.00 for something I can make at home for $0.50 or claim to serve foie de pate for only $9.00 you better be able to compete with the big boys.

A great concept, chef inspired twist on the classics but in the end, these are greasy, unhealthy, bizarre sandwiches.

- PBB&J (peanut butter, bacon, pepper jelly and rosemary).  Bizarre but it works.  Peanut butter and bacon, a match made in heaven is complemented by the herbaceous aroma of the rosemary.

- "Ruben-ish" (corned beef, Swiss cheese, thousand island dressing, fennel kraut) A paltry amount of somewhat dry, corned beef that initially pairs well with the anise flavor of the kraut.  The kraut quickly becomes overpowering with each bite.

- "Foie &" (Foie pate, crispy chicken skin, cabbage, almonds)  Chicken skin is excellent while the sauted cabbage adds vegetal sweetness and almonds, crunch.  I doubt their claim that they are using pate de foie gras.  French law mandates the pate be made of 80 percent foie.  The mouth feel is off and the mineral flavor leads me to think this is chicken liver pate.

Supermarket quality white, wheat or rye breads.  All becoming dry from toasting.  Making them "Monte Cristo" (a dip in egg before being griddled) just makes them more greasy and less appetizing.

Excessive Yelp hype aside, in the end, just an average sandwich.

Great experience, never have had a problem and they give Yelp discounts. Yes!

We've used Blue Sky many times and the service is pretty straight forward. Almost all the spaces are covered, a clear plus for those 110 degree summer days.  For the most part, it takes about ten to fifteen minutes from when we park our car, to when get off their shuttles bus. Pretty quick!

So, yes "we're a Fan"!

Ugh...This place made me pee from my butthole...

I didn't like this buffet at all...

I dunno...Even though there was so much food around, I didn't feel like anything caught my attention or made me want to eat it.  The meats were overcooked, everything was fried or covered in gross batter, and a lot of stuff had like barbeque sauce or a tomato based sauces on it.  

I literally had more gelato than i did food.  That's the only good thing I somewhat liked.  "Somewhat" is the key word there.  

I didn't even eat that much here and yet I felt so gross and sick afterward.  blah no me gusta (I especially hate buffet sushi...wtf...what's the point?  I always wanna give them a chance and I get some and it makes me vomit in my mouth.)

ps.  I've had better food at Hometown Buffet, and that's just sad...

Unfortunately, after living near the canal for 5 years, I haven't seen a dead body.  Seriously, it's my dream to find one.  I can see the TV crews and cameras now...
The Grand Canal is now paved from 7th Avenue East.  I rode it with Robert M and Bacon all the way down to McDowell, and the paving continued.  No traffic to deal with, except for when crossing streets.  
We saw some cool pottery, super-sized, as decor.  There are also several little parks in CenPho along the canal.
I've read/heard that the city is actually going to start utilizing the canal as more of a park.  They'll be putting up more lighting and trees and little shops along the way.  I can't wait for that part!  
I still need to see a floater, though.

I was first introduced to Tomos in celebration of my brother and my girlfriend's birthday.  Since then, it's become my favorite sushi joint in the west valley!

Tomos keeps their restaurant dimly lit and there's plenty of bar space [sushi and alcohol] available.  I've only been here for dinner so I have yet experienced their lunch or Happy Hour special but I can't imagine those being anything less than delicious.  

For appetizers, their monkey balls, soft shell crab, the ninja jalapenos, and oyster shooters are delicious [warning:  raw quail egg].  Some of my favorite rolls are the Passion of Fire [pity they don't bring this lit on fire anymore], the Dysart Roll, Crunch Roll, Cowboy Roll, Dragon Roll, Spider Roll, and Popcorn Lobster.  The sashimi is always thickly cut and Ocean Salad is great too.

While Tomos isn't the absolute best place for sushi, if you're in the west valley, it's probably your safest bet for fresh sushi.

I've gone to this Great Clips for the past 6 months twice a month for hair cuts. I keep my hair short. Generally haven't had a problem and the girls are good. The one thing Im starting to dislike about all great clips tho, esp this one, is that when they cut my hair they want to give me a military cut every time!!! This past time I told the girl keep the sides and the back low as I hate military cut. Well guess what happened? 2 seconds after I said that her first swipe with the clippers went way higher than I like. She said "oops I guess I'll try to work with this." My hair looks ridiculous. She pretty much shaved it all over but this tuft of hair up front. I'm so angry that I will never go to another great clips ever again.

For my 725th review, I wanted to share a dope alternative to a club in Vegas.  We stopped by here for a drink before having dinner at the Cosmo.  Chandelier is tri-level, w/ the 2nd level being the best in my opinion.

Top shelf drinks were only $10, vs most places that charge $15.  The place is very swanky, w/ a bar on each level, and lounge seats on the side.  In addition, the bartenders and clientele are chill.  We didn't feel any arrogance, and no one cut in line vs Marquee.  Lastly, the vibe is low key vs a lot of clubs in town.

Chandelier is highly recommended for a drink before or after dinner, or if you prefer something more chill vs a club.  A great place to hang out w/ friends or impress a date.

Let me give you this little tip:

Do not attend a Vegas Strip Club with your brothers and/or male family members.  Under any circumstances.  No ifs, ands or butts.  Just don't.  Seriously.

It's awkward.  And upsetting.  And awkward.  

Little did I know that while my cousin Lauren and I watched our respective brothers get lapfucked by a pretty pair named Pilot and Perfect, that our benefactor had already paid for us to get our own laps snizzed on by Mercedes, a tight little tan blonde.

She sauntered over, asked the boys of the group that weren't busy getting jacked in a backroom somewhere to buy her a redbull (redbull is stripper cryptonite) and then sorta draped over us...

And that's when we both got felt up. 

Mercedes:  You guys both have really big boobs!

Rachel and Lauren: ...

*Stripper grabs our boobs*

Mercedes:  Are they real?

Rachel and Lauren:  *nod simultaneously* 

: |

Mercedes:  Mine are fake.

Rachel and Lauren:  *shock and awe* You don't say?

*Rachel and Lauren get the hell out of Spearmint Rhino*

Getting felt up without dinner or even a drink purchased for me beforehand felt wrong, but watching my brother enjoy a lap dance a little too much was enough to hurtle my nice seafood dinner out of the depths of innerspace onto the floor.

I'll give it up for the strippers super soft skin, though.  It's nice.  And they smell good too.  Lauren and I are thinking about creating a perfume called "Stripper".  It will be a blend of cucumber melon and coconut nectar with glitter.  Lots of glitter.

Oh, and they have pretty nice fake boobs. 

If you like that sort of thing.

I've passed by Regio's plenty of times and I wish I had tried them sooner! Tucked right next to the 51 on Indian School, Regio's is far from an optimum location, but I can agree with most of the other reviews so far and say that the food is poppin'! I got a gordita plate from them on New Year's Day, and I was way surprised! It was delicious, and it helped settle my stomach after a night of properly ringing in 2011...

I want to go back as I write this to try their sopes! If their carne asada and their al pastor gorditas are any indicator, I will sure be in for a delicious treat! If you live in Central Phoenix and fancy some good, cheap Mexican food from a local joint, get your buns over to Regio's. I personally think I found my new regular spot for some Mexican chow.

I LIKE BIG DONUTS AND I CAN NOT LIE.

But how to feed the crave?...a fritter from Greenbush will more than suffice.
Blueberry, apple...'tis no matter. If it's got fritter in the name and it's from this place you are sittin pretty. They are $5, bigger than my head, and sooooo good. Eat the whole thing, as I often do (it's hard to share)...and you will start twitching. Really you will, but it is absolutely worth it.

If you're new to the donut cult, first of all, welcome. From now onward, visions of sugary balls of dough will forever dance in your head. Your thoughts will evermore be occupied with sweet musings and that is alright. Know that you are in good company and that Greenbush is here to fuel your donut needs. And yes, it is a need. 

Fritter awesomeness aside, what sets Greenbush apart is the fact that they are open at such odd hours. And by odd I mean that they are open from 6am until at least 11pm during the week and from 6am to 2am on the weekend, if not later. Talk about a constant temptation.

I've had the pleasure of experiencing quite a few of their donuts since my first Greenbush encounter, and while most of them have been glorious (especially the Old Fashioned varieties and the Oreo filled), the fritters still rock my world.

Oh and each donut (besides the fritters) are $1. Deliciously preposterous.

In December, I  went on a short tour of all the most popular California Ramen-Yas, and the weirdest thing was that I really could not find one that was better than FUKUMIMI. I believe that we Las Vegas folks should feel privileged that we have the very best Ramen-Ya in all of America. 

There are two owners here: former Osaka native: Katsu-San. And, Torrance native: Daisuke-San. Torrance is the Ramen Capital of America. I lived in Arcadia most of my life, and I always remember the Japanese residents driving all the way to Torrance whenever they wanted Ramen(and that's a pretty long drive). Believe me, there is not even one bad Ramen-Ya in Torrance. And, any Japanese chef from that town is going to be an expert at perfecting a bowl of ramen. 

The Japanese-American community here in LV believes that FUKUMIMI is a Hakata Ramen-Ya. But, Katsu-San informed me the other day that it is actually an Osaka variation. I have never in my life seen an Osaka Ramen-Ya. No wonder the broth is so unique with it's Tonkotsu fusion of Miso, Shio, or Shoyu. 

What makes FUKUMIMI the greatest Ramen-Ya in America is that it's Tan Tan Men is a Tokyo Chuka Ryori variation.  There are other Ramen-Yas in LA that serve Tan Tan Men but apparently it is a Yokohama variation(Yokohama having the giant China town). Chin-Ma-Ya is the only other Ramen-Ya in America that features a Tokyo variation, but on Jan 20th Chin-Ma-Ya closed it's doors, making FUKUMIMI the one and only place in America to get this variation of Tan Tan Men. I asked Daisuke-San why the Tan Tan Men at FUKUMIMI is almost identical to Chin-Ma-Ya, and he informed me of the close connections he has to the owner of that establishment. Apparently, it is a shared recipe.

I just want to point out that every Japanese Yelper but 2 have given this place 5-Stars. And the 2 J-yelpers who didn't give this place a 5, gave it a 4-Star rating. Isn't that proof enough that this is the best Ramen-Ya in America?

You don't know how much I love you,
You don't know how much I care.

This review is way old but since I'm sick and have nothing better to do than stare at my feet and feel like crap I thought I'd catch up on old reviews before they are erased from memory.

Happy Hour is where its at son!
1/2 off Steaks (and a gnocchi I just couldn't pass up)

The vibe is straight up sexy, (I never use that word because I feel awkward saying it out loud) but its just dark, sultry and sleek and straight out of an old-school movie.  

The specialty cocktails are divine, the bartenders take their time and they know wassup.  Quality drinks cost money, but oh what a way to burn.

With the wide array of Asian fare available in Las Vegas beyond the strip, Japanese cuisine continues to lead the pack in terms of variety and innovation.  With heavy emphasis on presentation in Japanese dishes(often to create the illusion of more with less), they inevitably begin to resemble works of art.  If Japanese small plates in Las Vegas were to be represented by famous artists I would label them as the following:

Raku= Picasso- the old master, consistently brilliant and timeless with indisputable genius and imagination

Kyara= Cezanne- transition between the traditionalists and the modernists pulling in influences from various sources 

Ichiza= Warhol- iconic and often overhyped/controversial in public opinion

With Yonaka, Rene Magritte comes to mind:
-Magritte is from Belgium (the signature appetizer is the crispy "Brussels" sprouts with puffed rice, coincidence?)

-Often overlooked and underrated (much like Yonaka's location off the strip in an unassuming retail center on Flamingo and Decatur) 

-Challenges convention while giving new meaning to the familiar (compressed watermelon with house made fish sauce and thai basil? But of course!)

-Much like his most famous work "The Son of Man" (http://uploads2.wikipaintings.org/images/rene-magritte/son-of-man-1964(1).jpg) there is  frequent juxtaposition of fruit in unexpected settings at Yonaka, like the dynamite combination of orange supremes with salmon and tobiko or the tender cuts of wagyu served with peach salsa and slices of georgia peach, which all work in surrealistic harmony.

-Pierce's Brosnan's title character in "The Thomas Crown Affair" takes inspiration from Magritte's "Son of Man" to pull off a seemingly impossible art heist at the climactic conclusion, and the happy hour menu offered at 5-630PM and 11-2AM offer food and libations at such low prices/great value, your bill will seem like the steal of the century.

Perfect for a first date, gathering of friends, or an intro to the local scene for an out-of-town visitor, Yonaka is modern Asian cuisine executed to perfection, and the food does in fact tastes as good if not better than it looks.

Rock of Ages is like watching fireworks made of diamonds, jizz and Aqua Net explode in the night sky, while a choir of leather-clad angels pour sunshine joygasms into your ears, and the naked Thunderbirds fly by overhead, trailing clouds of cocaine and pure cane sugar. IT'S THAT GOOD!

Every single thing about it is fantastic and well-executed. The costumes are hilarious, the staging is fantastic, the music will rock your sox off (even if you don't like 80s metal, you'll recognize almost every song), the band is amazing, the theater is cleverly decorated with vintage signage (hello, Budweiser ladies!) and the cast goes BALLS-OUT the entire way.

Even the book is fan-fuckin-tastic -- usually with these "jukebox musicals," the plot is paper-thin and basically just an excuse to string together a bunch of old songs. But Rock of Ages actually manages to make SENSE, and even to be genuinely witty along the way. And this is coming from someone who despises Broadway musicals and Vegas shows in general.

Kudos to the writers, set designers and costumers...but the real accolades go to the cast, which is astonishingly fantastic (and trust me, I DETEST showbiz people). In particular, special shout-outs must go to narrator/comic relief character Lonny (the indescribably fabulous and hilarious Mark Shunock); evil German developer Hertz (the fabulous Robert Torti); his son Franz (wacky Kevin Hegmann); and club owner Dennis (a sort of Jeff-Bridges-as-the-dude-y Troy Burgess).  

But top kudos must go to the beautiful monstrous freak who plays badass rocker Stacee Jacks. I know they say Tom Cruise did a great job playing this character in the movie (which I haven't seen)...but I honestly can't imagine ANYONE doing this better than Kyle Lowder, who sort of looks like a Barbie doll on steroids and is just side-splittingly/mouth-gapingly/unbelievably AMAZING in this role. 

I can't stress enough how much I enjoyed this fantastic, bombastic spectacle! Such a relief to see a show that doesn't take itself too seriously -- this shit is tongue-in-cheek, all the way. It WALLOWS in gratuitous cheese. RUN, don't walk -- and check this show out before they replace it with some more Cirque du Bullshit!!!

I was referred to ProtoGym by a good friend and have been extremely satisfied. The gym is owned by the trainer and it is pretty much a one man operation. You are given a scanner key and are able to access the gym 24/7/365. Being that the gym is relatively new (6 months or so) the member base is not huge yet, therefore most of the times I have gone I have had the entire gym to myself. It felt pretty exclusive except the prices are far from it. The gym offers all of the equipment you would need for successful circuit training and cardio. 

The really neat function is the protogym software in conjunction with the gym. When you go in, you go up the the kiosk, scan your key and it brings up your personalized work out. You click for your work out to be generated,  print it out and don't have to worry about what you should be working on that day. The exercises for the day also have instructional 30 sec videos that show you exactly how/what you should be doing. The equipment is well kept and well stocked (medicine balls, mats, boxing bags,  weights, stability balls, balance trainer, cones, high cable stations, etc etc). The website lists in full everything offered at the gym. Mike, the trainer/owner is extremely friendly, knowledgeable and will kick your butt in his boot camp classes. I kind of want to be selfish and not let the word out about this awesome and innovative gym, but at the same time I want him to succeed and stick around.

He offers month to month, no contract memberships, as well as membership options that includes boot camp classes. He doesn't do any third party billing, so when you ask to cancel your membership he will do it without any hassle or headache (I am looking at you 24 hr fitness...).

If I was a girl I would *so* want to buy everything here and dance around the house in my lingerie all day long.  The place is a visual treat whether you are capable of buying something for yourself of picking up something for someone you know who has boobs.

The staff here is wonderful as well.  The first interaction I had with them was a conversation about my tattoos rather than being pestered about whether I was shopping for *someone special* followed by the hard sell.  In fact they seemed to be happy just having me browse around the shop taking in all of the bras, panties, riding crops, and whatever.

Just a Note:  girls with big boobers should not shy away from this place.  They have a very nice selection of items for sizes that are normally not carried in the other big name lingerie stores.

"The Only Las Vegas Ultra-Dive Bar" might make you dive out the window into the Venetian lagoon below. First of all, f* you for calling anything an 'Ultra-dive' bar. You contain none of the features found in a good dive bar or an ultra lounge. You are a sports bar, Rockhouse. Own it (or take down your 80+ tv's playing sports). 

Unfortunately, they fail at the sports bar elements too. Drink prices at $8/shot and $12/cocktail? Huh. Why are you here? I can get a (better) $12 cocktail at a reputable joint somewhere else in the Venetian. Isn't this a $5 pint of Jack 'n coke type of place? WTF? The food was a fail for me as well. The grilled chicken and avocado sliders should be renamed "wood chip served between a sawdust bun" as they were dry, tiny and tasteless. Sure, you can come here with good company (as I did) and have fun, but that can be done anywhere in the area. 

Oh yea, they have a mechanical bull. Ride it. NEXT!

Hippies scare me.     So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy, which I have been taking for three days now.  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.

It was all for nothing. No hippies around, just a teenager behind the counter.  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level. I don't know how anyone under 7'6" could easily eat off of them.  

Anyways for $5 flat, you get a kick ass burger, a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries, and a can of soda.   It's true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick.

I'd be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say "it's organic, don't panic".  

Jerry's dead, but this place lives on.  Thanks hippies!

Via  Brazil was a 3 star restaurant in my previous review 3 days ago.  That's nothing to be ashamed about.... it just means the restaurant was nothing great, but not terrible TO ME.  Yelp is a site for posting your opinions.  But some guy named Dustin J. had to send me a private message saying:

"We are very sorry that Our Happy Hour is too expensive for you. 
Please visit McDonalds, Taco Bell and other fast foods if this is too expensive for you"

It took me a minute to figure out what restaurant he was referring to, but when I found 20 photos for Via Brasil, I figured it out  Congratulations, guys, I will never return to your restaurant and will make sure nobody I ever talk to does either.  Worst marketing ever.

Is this the trail to Payard's Place, was all I said
This concierge has heard that question lots before
We strolled through Caesar's Casino and marched straight ahead
It was on a corner curve
From an inside counter serve
It was there where we saw the macarons.

The waitress poured our water into tiny cups
She got the caprese sandwich from the fridge
She took crepe batter from a tin and whipped it up
Added mushrooms, chicken, cream
It was a Paris cafe dream
Expensive, but ended too soon

Those summer nights, when we were free
Four-day vacation for wifey and me
Travel eaters, travel eaters
And in our quest for macarons
We stumbled on these DESERT MOONs
Vegas dreamers, Vegas dreamers
Of DESERT MOONs
Of macarons
Of DESERT MOONs
Of macarons

Caprese sandwich mozzarella fresh and light
Basil and tomato so mixed well
The chicken crepe needed something to make it right
We got mojito mint cheesecake
Too rich for me to take
And then we got to our macarons

I've never had a macaron I've liked before
Europane has the closest to me heart
But when I tried this Payard disk, I wanted more
The fillings not too sweet
A flaky cookie treat
These desserts made my tongue and heart swoon

Those summer nights, when we were free
Four-day vacation for wifey and me
Travel eaters, travel eaters
And in our quest for macarons
We stumbled on these DESERT MOONs
Vegas dreamers, Vegas dreamers
Of DESERT MOONs

I would give them negative stars if it was possible! One star is WAY TO GRACIOUS! HAD A HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE WITH TIVEGAS! 

Upon coming back to our room after a wedding last night we found a disturbing man leaving OUR ROOM with a bag full of all our valuables!!! After confronting him, the crazed man grabbed my husband by the throat and ran through the SERVICE ELEVATOR ROOM, using the SERVICE ELEVATOR to escape! Those elevators have to have keys and the hotel receptionist said she has worked there 9 years and doesn't know how to work those elevators!! SKETCHY!!! 

On top of the terror, security was sluggish and ON OUR FLOOR witnessing the attack and did NOT RUN, they walked, strolled even, over to us allowing the man to escape and offering only to write a report "IF WE WANTED TO". Security then proceeded to try to persuade us to NOT FILE A POLICE REPORT!!! SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS SECURITY SYSTEM?! Isn't safety supposed to be the most important??? I don't think TI Vegas has that priority AT ALL. 

And to ice this cake of a stay, TI VEGAS Risk Management NEVER filed a note or report to hotel staff/management to inform them of the breach of safety, as well as REFUSED to compensate for the room for our stay. UNREAL, never ever coming back and you are all warned!

Best buffet on The Strip! Not to mention it's also located inside the best hotel in Vegas. Prices vary on the day of week, but the brunch buffet on Tuesday was only $22, which included unlimited champagne. What a deal!

Their international selection is absolutely mouthwatering. Your eyes will definitely be bigger than your stomach, so make sure you pace yourself. Hightlights included pastas served in mini skillets, fried chicken wings in mini fry baskets, awesome carving station, giant made-to-order omelettes and a beautiful array of desserts.

Save the buffet for your last day. Perfect cure for those hangovers!

Lost in translation?

What it should be:  A working businessman's meal.  100g-150g of high quality, heritage pork, coated in fresh bread crumbs and fried golden brown.  The small portion is accompanied by AYCE rice and cabbage.  Do it yourself sesame based sauces for the tonkatsu and to dress the cabbage.

What they offer:  A simple menu.  Choice of either the softer, less fatty tenderloin of the slightly more firm loin from an everyday pig.  Served traditionally or as a donburi or with curry.  Rice, miso soup, and cabbage completes the meal (not AYCE).  Make your own sauce, grinding your sesame seeds and mixing in the house sauce which has a good dark soy background and hints of plum perfume.  

What I got:  Tried both the tenderloin and loin.  An oily, excessively thick eggy crust of not freshly made breadcrumbs (taste like store bought panko) surrounding an over cooked piece of pork.  Hawaii yeeps, think L&L quality.

Ultimately it's better than your average plate lunch place and not a bad deal for the novelty and price.  Tonkatsu snobs, look elsewhere.

Book & Stage is a small bar near the lobby of the Cosmopolitan. After spending 3 nights at the hotel and hitting the bar a couple times, it was a-ok as a hotel bar, but there wasn't any live performances in the evenings, the book portion is small, and there are better bars at the Cosmopolitan. 

The bartenders are nice and all ... like most drink slingers in Las Vegas. No complaints about the service; however, both visits we left and headed elsewhere cause the place was practically empty. When there aren't any live performances on the small stage, then perhaps the niche Book and Stage fills in as a quieter bar choice than other Cosmopolitan hot spots.

From Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich comes an authentic, contemporary Italian restaurant.  It's good! 

This is not your "we import everything from Italy so we are an Italian restaurant", nor is it "I use my mamma's recipes and she was Italian so this is authentic".  B&B creates classic Italian flavors using what is available seasonally, in the area.  From fresh herbs and produce to house cured salumi, it all goes into creating outstanding authentic food.

Antipasti features a simple but perfect braised tripe alla Romana.  Tender, with no off smell.  Vibrant acidity from the tomatoes add a nice foil to the mildly flavored tripe.  Perfect.  The grilled octopus, heaven.  Toothsome with a charred bitter edge that contrast well with the sweet, spicy, sour limoncello vinaigrette.  The lemony perfume is heady.  Sensory overload on a single plate.

Prima focuses around perfectly cooked, authentic pastas.  The bucatini all'Amatriciana is near Roman perfect.  Fatty, porky goodness of guanchale, bright acidity from pured tomatoes, a zing of acidity from some wine, lightly spiced and finished with pecorino cheese.  If that's too simple, the bone marrow ravioli is to die for.  Rich unctuous goodness surrounded by thin pasta bathed in a veal shank ragu that must have simmered all day.

Secondi proteins are different (lamb, rabbit, quail).  Experiment.  The deep fried sweetbreads, Win.   Crisp on the outside, pillowy on the inside; they pair perfectly with the sweet sour balsamic glazed cippolinis and the sweet bitterness of charred corn.  Don't think about what you're eating and you should be OK.

Massive Italian centric wine list representing DOC / DOCG throughout the country.  Good vintage depth for super Tuscans.  Vegas resort prices.

True Italian service, friendly with great pride taken in what they do.

Got tickets from Tix4tonight for tickets on the same day of the show... they seat you based on 1st come 1st served unless you upgraded & paid more $$ to be in the VIP sections.

Had so much fun here, the show is kinda cheesy but it's all clean fun with HOT HOT guys! =)

The guys here are HOT HOT HOT!! =) +1

I like the way the stage is setup here..not only is it the front stage but there's a part of the stage where they can walk out into the audience more. +1

The guys interacted with the audience a LOT LOT more than at Chippendale. +1

If you want to sit closer to the stage or in the middle of the seating area, you have to pay more for those seats. =(

The main guys knew how to dance but the ones at the end of the line were just there for eye candy; that's just fine with me.. =) +1

Great for bachelorette parties/ just girlie get togethers =)

How do I describe my Fukumimi experience? SILENCE. And lots of it. 

When you're on a first date, this is probably not the first red flag that you need to run to the bathroom and call your BFF to call you back in 10 minutes with an emergency to bail you out. "Mayday! The night is going downhill stat! MAYDAY!" 

But if you were like me and brought a parent whose seen more than his share of bowls of ramen in his lifetime, then the silence is welcomed. It's a stamp of approval. A gold star. It means that the bowl of miso tonkotsu ramen my dad ordered and the bowl of salt tonkotsu ramen I got delivered on generous portions of noodles, aromatic broth, and some righteous slices of chashu pork. 

The service is here is quick and to the point, but not brusque or overbearing at all. They didn't ask us if we knew about their punch card, so I approached them after having perused a few reviews on Yelp, and now I'm two out of four bowls of ramen away from a free side of gyoza or chicken karaage. What a great day.

Sidenote - I had to drop my dad, said Senor Silence, off at the airport after our meal and we made it with more extra time than we anticipated. So an even better day.

I had a member of our household sprain their ankle on Friday afternoon.  While we kept the ankle iced and elevated, the pain and swelling did not subside Saturday evening.  What to do?  The 800 number on my insurance card does not have customer service who mans the phones in the evenings on the west coast or weekends.

I turn to Yelp to find the Urgent Care facilities in my area.  While FastMed was not my initial first choice. FastMed's website had everything I needed to confirm.  Their website showed my insurance was covered.  It also showed that they could handle a broken bone if needed.   My initial first choice who is part of my MD's medical group could not confirm this same information on their website.  

We walk in on a Sunday a hour and a half after they opened.  We find one other party in the lobby.  The lobby was very clean, bright and the temperature was very cool.  After filling out the required paperwork, the young lady behind the counter brought us a ice pack for the injured ankle.  They were very prompt with initial meet with the doctor to x-rays to the diagnosis.  No break which was good news.  They recommended medical supplies from braces to crutches and where by no means pushy at all on us taking the recommend supplies for the injury.  

I would tell my family, friends and fellow Yelpers to give FastMed a shot.  If your regular MD is not available.

Guy Savoy was impressive, very impressive.  I have not even eaten here, but it does not really matter.  Guy Savoy is hospitality personified.  I came here for one reason, Krug.  I had called to see if a reservation was required to have some bubbly at the Bubble Bar (where they poured Krug by the glass) and was told that it was not necessary and that they look forward to having us.  When we arrived, we were told that the Bubble Bar was sold out for the evening.  The hostess was quite gracious and apologetic when I told her about the phone conversation I had regarding reservations.  She suggested we talk to the manager and then guided us to the restaurant.  

I approached the manager who was at the front desk, informed him of the situation and without hesitation, he led us to their private patio. It was beautiful and romantic. The manager served us personally. He brought us two glasses of Krug and surprised us with three canapes.  They were delicious.  

This is the mark of a great restaurant.  We were in Vegas, we wanted an experience at Guy Savoy, and without hesitation or pretense, they gave me exactly what I wanted and more. 

I will be back in a month or so to have dinner, I cannot wait.

Make whatever jokes you want about the name as if you're a homophobic 7th grade boy, but Dick's Hideaway has really got a great menu of American food.  
Might not be a burger, fry, and shake diner, but New Mexican cuisine is American all the way, and as a matter of fact, among their many southwestern tinged dishes, they've got a superb thick, juicy burger, grilled up on an open flame right in front of you as you sit at the bar, with some great fries AND a nice full plate of dark green salad for somewhere around 11 bucks-ish (last I was aware).

I got some promo tickets from a promoter in the Quad and went to this show on a whim.  I was not sure about spending $100 on Le Reve in Encore, so this is what we ended up doing.  Let me say this, what a super fun show!  I was laughing so damn hard.  I will say that Frank Marino is really engaging and hilarious.  Just a side note, he talks in rapid fire, stand-up style and throws a lot of show biz references and jokes that some generations/foreigners may not get.  So brush up on your current events and pop stars!  

There are a lot of drag performers performing as stars like: Beyonce, Madonna, Shania Twain, Mariah, Janet Jackson...Cher was prob my personal fav, but all the acts were great.  It is nice that you can sing along and that the audience is so carefree and chill.  There were people of all ages there and the place is so small that you really don't get a bad seat.  I recommend the middle though and not the left and right sides. My upgrade tickets were $20 and drinks were under $10, so this is totally affordable for a show on the strip.

The kinda naked male dancers did the majority of the dancing.  There was one guy who was 2-3 beats off from the rest, but after a while you got used to his dancing being off. lol.  Oh and the end gets you too.  It is all funny, but they show a serious side as well. Go Divas!  Great, great show!

What an awesome place to on the weekend or during the week for dinner.  You can't go wrong with their Happy hour menu.  The ramen here is delicious and it is only $5 on the Happy hour menu.

While if you are looking for an awesome place to go for HH in downtown you should check out this place.

Popped in to give this place a try as I've heard nothing but good things about their chicken. And the raves are correct. This is really good chicken. A meaty chicken breast that was moist with a very crispy batter that wasn't so thick that it overwhelmed the chicken.

I got a two piece dinner, which came with a dinner roll, a small tub of cole slaw, some tater tots, some hushpuppies and the previously mentioned chicken - one wing and one breast. The tots were excellent. Not too greasy at all, but I was glad to have the one packet of ketchup for dipping.

This was a serious "fried" plate. If they could fry the cold slaw and the dinner roll, I'll bet they would have done so.

Note: This place is TAKE OUT ONLY. There is no dining area that I could see.

Dare I say that I like Amore's deep dish pizza even better than the pizza I had in Chicago? No need to hop on a plane to go all the way to Gino's when we have Amore Taste of Chicago here in Vegas. My favorite thing about it... It's hard to narrow it down to only one so here's a few. Their sauce is so flavorful and made from real crushed tomatoes. The ingredients are extremely fresh. Their thick crunchy cornmeal crust is never oily. Every time I have ordered from here, my pizza has been perfectly cooked. 

I love this pizza! I'm just mad that I tried it because now I'm hooked and I'm going to get fat. When I become too out of shape and have to give up modeling because of this guys, I blame Amore! It's all their fault! Don't say I didn't warn you. ;)

These ladies are pressing up the most delectable dietary delights in Las Vegas! It's a five star experience all the way to organic nirvana.

HPP means high pressure pressing. All USDA organic, non GMO. A lot of their produce is sourced from California, which means a smaller carbon footprint. Their bottling is either glass (all class) or plastic, and the plastic bottles are, of course, BPA free. What's not to love?

If that's not enough to entice you, the radiant ladies they have behind the counter (or the adorable Queen Bees that are wandering the floor this afternoon) are incredibly friendly AND knowledgable. Their concept goes beyond trendy. When they began to tell me about how certain vitamins will be absorbed 100% because of the pairings with other vegetables, and a mention of trace minerals (87 in BeWhealthy, if you're counting), I knew I had come to the right place! It's a breath of fresh air having nutrition that makes sense and does work for you, instead of just adding chia seed to everything and calling it healthy.

Their selection of smoothies are limited to a mere four, but they run the gamut of every avenue of nutrition you need. Fruit based, protein based, veggie based, and fat based (think coconut, avocado). They have superfood add-ons as well such as chia, hemp, flax, coconut meat, bee pollen, spirulina, nutritional yeast.. The list goes on. I've tried all but the protein smoothie and can confidently say they are delicious and filling! I love my liquid lunches on the go.

The space itself is gorgeous and inspiring, the branding and bottling is sexy, the juices are not only good for you, but specifically crafted to be delicious while beneficial to your health. Bee well!

If you haven't figured it out by now, what makes this pool memorable is the Lazy River section.

If floating around and mingling with others is not your kinda thing or if you have the family with you, MGM definitely has many other pools to relax in.  

During my last visit here, there were kids in our group. Most people would tell you to leave the kids by the other pool, but they weren't my kids so it went kinda like this ...


Water Gun + Adorable 6 year old + Lazy River + "Shoot Her" = Ultimate Wingman


Get there early, snag a spot in the shade or somewhere near Wet Republic, hop in the lazy river then drink and mingle the day away.  


I can't think of a better way to spend a hot day in Vegas.  

I'm lying. I can but this is definitely top 10.


PS - don't be lazy. They have a ton of restrooms

This is my favorite store in the entire valley. So many new things to look at everytime you enter the store, the staff is so friendly, trade in prices are fair and I love their cafe. Grab a book and a coffee or a sandwich and relax on a couch. I go there for my expanding video game collection as well and every time I go in there is so much new inventory I feel like its a whole new store to dig through. Check this place out. The classic nick nacks alone is enough reason to pop in and look around. There is absolutely something for everyone.

At the risk of sounding like an ad for an Adam Sandler movie where they interview audiences outside of the theater, I have to say that my face hurt from laughing so much after this show. I'm not what you'd call "easily offended." I'm a pretty thick-skinned gal and I'm not averse to foul language or nudity, but wow, I was even surprised by the amazingly offensive hilarity at this show. 

You know how most cirque-type shows have the acrobat act followed by the clown act. And the clown act is some foofy French shit that is mildly humorous at best, and mostly evokes an, "Aww, that's cute." Well, the "clown" act in Absinthe is totally different. The hosts are absolutely hilarious, and while I know a lot of it is scripted, they are on point with their improv too. 

The acrobat acts were 80% fantastic too, there was one that was whatevs, but just wait for the tightrope walkers. Thanks to the super intimate venue, you get to see tightrope walkers closer than you ever have before. It's pretty spectacular. 

Absinthe is my number one recommendation for Vegas these days. I'm not much into clubs, and I'd be more into shows if they didn't all run more per ticket than my car payment. But Absinthe, oh Absinthe. It's a must-see. And for the price (especially with the plentiful discounts around town), it can't be beat.

PS It's true. Be careful about sitting in the front row, you will more than definitely get teased. It's pretty hilarious, but if you're still recovering from Little Tommy teasing you in 4th grade for having hairy legs, well, maybe sit a few rows back.

Stevey P:" Shopping for a jock strap in a former Albertson's seemed weird...:

I do not. Know. How. To top. That. 

Those who know me, however, do not see me as a top anyway, so I will move on...

We walked into this mammoth sports store with two things in mind; water shoes for Rickie and new tennies for me. Although the store was full of merchandise, the signage was clear and viseable. BOOM. Men's shoes to the right.

Grabbed Rickie's shoes. Found a pair of $69.99 Asics marked down to $39.99. Tried 'em on. Little slivers of pillow heaven. My toes for the first time spoke to me and said, "Thank you. Thank you, you cheap fool. What took you so long?" Kinda bitchy, but I understood. 

We were asked for help, though never needed it. Arrived at cashier and was asked if we found everything we needed. Yes. Was the answer. There less than 10 minutes.

In N Out. Fast food. Fast shoes. Great service. 

BTW Stevey P...I hear Unique On Central has some rhinestone jock straps...just an FYI.

Finally a gelateria that rivals those of Firenze or Roma; almost.  The Italian spirit is alive and well.  A myriad of made fresh daily gelato, a warm smile, tastes of this and that offered enthusiastically. 

Product Pros:
- Made fresh daily.
- Good density and smooth texture of the gelato.  Near creamy, texture for the sorbetto.
- Well extracted, clean, concentrated flavors.  Fruit flavors in the mango and strawberry excellent.  Both taste and smell like the sun ripened fruit.  Pistachio, avocado, and white coffee (a baked rather than roasted bean that has the flavor of roasted nuts and an herbaceous tea like finish), all aromatic and deeply flavored.
- The gelato base flavor, fior di latte (milk's flower), milky, creamy, fatty in a good way.  Well controlled sweetness.
- Great savory flavors.  Well balanced flavors.  The rosemary and EVOO, classically Italian with the hint of rosemary aroma and taste finishing peppery with the flavor of olive oil.  The chocolate with pasilla and red chilies; brooding, almost bitter chocolate flavor with a spicy kick on the finish.

Product Cons:
- Pasteurized milk and the terrior is not evident.
- Sweetness of inventive dessert flavors mimics the real dessert (ie peach cobbler).  High and cloying.

Note:  They make gelato for several restaurants including Novecento Pizzeria.  Freshness matters.  Make the trek to experience the best.

Enjoy it now as the Vegas temperatures climb into the 70's. In a few months when it's 110 outside, you'll be looking at a puddle in seconds and that's just sad

I had my first taste of Firehouse Subs today and decided to go with the Beef & Cheddar eight inch sandwich with a large Diet Dr. Pepper from their fabulous soda machine. That machine kind of reminds me of Rodney Dangerfield's character in the Caddyshack where he had that golf bag that played music, so versatile just like the soda machine delivering many different types of sodas. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3A9rLoz_0o

The Beef and Cheddar sandwich comes with bbq sauce and mayo. I got it without the mayo and it tasted fabulous. The only problem was that I felt a little hungry after eating it. So there's the rub, an excellent tasting meal with just a little bit of meat. Five stars for taste but one star for not putting out my 5 alarm hunger pangs.

Decor and atmosphere is so attracting, I'm having fun just walking in :) Service is always hit or miss though, especially when they're really packed late at night. You get seated then wait for your food server then along comes a cocktail waitress from the Fireside Lounge. Food has always been great especially with their large portions. If theres a long wait, I suggest moseying on over to the Lounge and have a drink while ya wait :) Peppermills definitely a spot to check out while you're in Vegas even just once.

Jt's Bar & Grill is exactly what I have been looking for in the Valley! Neighborhood dive bar where everyone seemed to know each other, insanely friendly service (shout out to Kerri!) and killer bar food and chicken wings of epic proportions! 
I am a chicken wing connoisseur, and frankly Jt's may have the best chicken wings I have EVER had! They deep fry those baby's, sauce em and throw them on the grill. They have several choices of sauces the best was the works which featured all of their sauces mixed together minus their suicide sauce which produced a delicious and not too spicy wing! I like my wings ultra spicy so I ordered a side of the Suicide sauce, which I personally loved - definitely spicy but not so that your mouth is on fire. Their wings will set you back $7.50 for a dozen ( Which makes me love this place more!). 
They have a pretty large beer selection on tap and every liquor you would want! This place is def going to be apart of my repertoire and it should be for you too!

OMG DD! OMG! I'm eating my roast beef sandwich now, typing this review and pounding my hands on the table like Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally...moaning, groaning and achieving culinary orgasms. 

Now that's a pretty picture for ya!

House roasted roast beef with a blue cheese horseradish spread, red onion, tomato and my favorite green next to Brian Austin Green...arugula! All served on a yummy artisan roll. 

Such a cute place with a case FULL of delicious looking temptations from crab cakes to mashed sweet potatoes to chocolates and cheeses and VINO!! Great staff...friendly and helpful. Why I'm even a proud card carrying member of their sandwich club. And I'm sure it won't take me long to earn that free heavenly sandwich!

An AYCE sushi restaurant for those who don't like sushi.  Jjanga is about sushi drowned (literally sitting in a puddle)  with sauces that mask  the taste of the seafood.

Typical AYCE quality; previously frozen, gassed and thawed fish and color added fish eggs atop mediocre quality, sticky, seasoned, over compacted short grain rice.  

The nigiri rundown:  Maguro, hamachi, and salmon previously frozen, tako rubbery (not tenderized prior to cooking), the amaebi previously frozen, sticky, ammoniated taste, beef tataki tough, tamago over cooked.

Appetizers are in line with other AYCE joints.  Bought in gyoza and shumai, mayo coated baked mussels, overcooked but flavorful scallop and shrimp skewers, OK teriyaki chicken drowned in cold sauce, chewy steak, overcooked but well seasoned grilled mackerel, and the ubiquitous elongated shrimp tempura (shrimp split lengthwise, heavily coated and fried crisp).

Vegas style rolls are a disaster.  The "dragon roll" (Cali roll with a liquid mayo filling topped by rubbery eel and drowned in a cloyingly sweet, sticky, soy concoction) and the "Jack Pot Special" (Oily shrimp tempura, crab and cucumber surrounded by oil soaked rice topped with spicy crab, shrimp avocado, tempura cast offs and eel with a watered down spicy mayo spooned over all are enough to stop you from trying more.

Fun ambiance.  Fast service at the sushi bar.  $20.95 lunch, $25.95 dinner.  There is a time limit for ordering.  It was not enforced on two visits.

Falling below the pack of AYCE options in Vegas but an option if quantity is all that matters.

Whoot for things I didn't buy in Japan years ago, but are now down the street from me. I will have to physically stop myself from buying everything in here; and I mean, they have everything you could want to be a nerdy Japanese lover.

For one, they have an entire section for Sailor Moon. Enough said on that.

Two, they have all the little knick knacks you could want for bento boxes, and anything remotely cute that you wouldn't otherwise need (I have recently discovered I now must have mini pandas to put on my sandwiches). 

Three, they have a section of imported foods, mostly what you can normally get at any store now that has jumped on the pocky bandwagon- but the most important part about this is that they have Green Tea, Orange, and Hazelnut Kit Kats. Most people will be more interested in the Green Tea ones, but personally I found the orange ones to be very tasty. 

They also carry a section of Japanese imported hair products and such (ie: Electric white hair dye) and some regular Japanese imports like Geisha dolls and dishware. 

It is a very small shop, but most people will be able to find something here to scream about.

I've been hearing about Tee Pee for years; it's considered a Phoenix landmark, I think!  George W Bush has been there afterall!  But it wasn't until my husband purchased a groupon for this place, that I was forced to go check it out.  

My quick summary:
*chips and salsa - meh, nothing special, kind of stale tasting to be honest
*guacamole - nasty
*Bud Light - A-OK
*Chicken Tostada - decent
*House Salad - decent but simple (it's just lettuce and tomato)
*Service - friendly and attentive although it did take awhile to get ice water, and when we finally did, we were handed a pitcher and 3 glasses.  I realized it was 3 glasses for the 2 of us because 2 of them were stuck together - classic!

Bottom line: I don't eat Mexican very often, but when I do, I'll likely go elsewhere.

Ichiza was shut down by the SNHD on June 30. 
http://vegas.eater.com/archives/2014/07/03/japanese-favorite-ichiza-shut-down-by-snhd.php

Ugh. If you like to play Russian Roulette with your health, keep reading. But personally, I'd never come here again, because they don't practice basic hygiene yet they serve raw fish and raw beef. Yuck. 

The food was decent, 4 stars. It reminds me of a smaller, dirtier Honda-ya in Tustin.  They've got typical Izakaya-style items on their menu, such as sashimi, yakitori and ramen. I really enjoyed the kimchi buta and the famous honey toast. I also got the beef tataki, which was decent, but now I feel queasy that I ate it. . 

The decor isn't much. It feels like an authentic Japanese Izakaya; small, cramped, with a decent sake list and faded pieces of paper taped to the wall. 

Service was ok, it wasn't packed on a Thurs. night when we went. 

Decent place, but with the health concerns and so many other good places to eat nearby, I doubt I'll ever go back here again.

We like AJs, and generally enjoy shopping in them. 

We were over this way and decided to stop in for a couple of items. As the three of us wandered the aisles, we were more than taken aback by some of the prices. They seemed even higher than our local AJs. It  never occurred to me that different stores, had different prices.

Well this led to an interesting discussion on how to rate this AJs? In terms of hard to find upscale products, or for variety, hands down all AJs are Four Stars. Particularly, if price is no object. 

But in the real world, where price and value do matter; they're the Needless-Markup (Neimann Marcus) of food retailers. For instance, a bottle of wine which I normally pay $18.99, was going for $24.99 here.

So, Two Stars for price and value, and yes, we've experienced better. I wonder if Oakville will ever considering coming back?

I was very excited to be chosen for this event, and not just because I got a sneak preview of J-WoW's sweater.  It was also to be the first time the lunch bunch would meet our cyber friend, Kazi, in person.

The venue was fantastic, located between 2 parking garages, next to an outdoor ice rink.  Upon arriving at the registration table, I spied the Santa photo op, so I grabbed Kazi for her first ever Yelp Elite photo (show some love and friend our newest Elite)

While at the bar, I indulged in a cherry vanilla porter, and I liked it.  The trio of ample hummus bowls were a delight, and I'm not ashamed to admit returning for seconds.

The hot chocolate was the finest I've ever tasted, especially after adding peppermint syrup and a heaping mound of whipped cream. 

While the food and beverage was delightful, the conversation was the high point, and I was lucky enough to spend a few minutes with the beautiful and engaging Kazi.  I loved seeing my friends... and meeting new Yelpers face to face is the icing on the cookie! (which there were a lot of)

I witnessed my first ever ugly Christmas poncho when J-WoW's +1, Linh, made his grand entrance.  Santa Sat on my lap, and my cheek was kissed by a pretty little lady who disappeared into the crowd. 

All in all, a pretty good night

Not a build your own disaster place.  No teriyaki or yakisoba garnish.  BurGR is not about reinvention but about creating the every day burger on steroids and what a great burger it is.

Take a flavorful, plump, juicy, fire grilled burger put it in a good brioche bun, top it with greens (arugula instead of lettuce), cheese (fresh European instead of Kraft singles), onions (as jam), tomato (oven roasted) sauted mushrooms (chanterelles); you get the picture.

The chanterelle burger is delicious. Pungent chanterelles, spicy arugula, and the onion jam compliment the char flavor of the beef.  The Euro burger equally good.  Earthy truffle aioli, tart goat cheese, peppery arugula, and sweet oven roasted tomato.  As with the chanterelle burger, the toppings bring out the flavor of the beef.

The two meat burgers are creative and delicious.  Props to the farm burger with its slightly gamy duck breast "bacon", sharp English cheddar and fried egg.  A great interpretation of the Midwest classic.  Ooey, gooey, juicy and messy.  Delicious.

For sides, parm truffle fries.  Nuff said.

Somewhat inconsistent service and probably the reason for the burgers arriving over temperature.

Tip: use your Total Rewards card to get a minuscule discount (don't bother getting a card if you don't have one).

Never thought I'd see the day when a British chef honored our humble burger.  Cheers!

Flour. Sugar. Butter. Egg.

Big.

Friggin.

Whoop.

Didn't go in, but they were delivered to my office.

Had two flavors - both were okay, but so sugary that they tasted pretty much the same.  Frosting tasted distinct at least, and was decent frosting, but there was actually too much of it piled up there.  (I hear an elderly Jewish man in the background of my review right now, saying in a most stereotypical Jackie Mason voice, "I should have such problems.")

I guess this is a clear example of an establishment setting a higher standard for itself with their pricing point, presentation, and marketing, and then not being able to live up to that standard.  

A $0.50 cupcake from a girlscout bakesale may not have the prestige or cachet, but I'd bet that the girl or her mom at least stirred the batter properly before putting it in the little cups.  

One of my cupcakes had the unstirred situation happening -- where one bite was flour-y, the next almost tasted baking soda-y for some reason.  

Inexcusable.

There is a sliding scale for judging those places that charge premium prices.  That means this cupcake gets a 2 star rating, while the bakesale homejob from the box would get 4 stars.  

Because it's not trying to be something it's not.

Flour. Sugar. Butter. Egg.

Take that, lemmings.  Bourgeois be B&.

Last night I learned that I should have applied myself to ice skating at a young age. I am a naturally graceful and beautiful figure skater. I skated backwards, I did twirls and even executed a highly skilled jump, and I have not even been on a pair of skates for sixteen years.

The pro shop did not have gloves, but quickly after getting on the ice I realized that I wouldn't need them because I was going to spend my time upright versus laying on the ice like I had anticipating before realizing how highly skilled of a skater I am. 

$8.25 (I think) paid my admission for two hours of skating and got me some sweet rental skates. I really wanted some graceful white ones, but I got brown. Fortunately I had leg warmers to complete my ensemble and tie everything together. Brown has never looked so good with sparkly gray tights before. 

There were plenty of places to pop a squat to put on your skates or take a break and they have lockers to stash your shoes and hand bags. It also appears they have a snack bar and vending machines, but I did not partake in any of those offerings. 

I did, however, partake in some libations at the Ice House, located at the east end of the rink. I love that my friends and acquaintances sat inside the bar sipping their bourbon watching us skaters from the comfort of their warm seats. I'm certain they were too intimidated by my amazing skating skills to join on the ice.

If you thought THAT was impressive, just you wait... I am going to take lessons and next time we have an ice skating #pfn I will blow all of you away with my triple quadruple axle spin jumps.

"Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound?
That only echoes through the night."

The French Canadian with pipes like an angel, the gifted Celine Dion.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#Kbvx9GtNiElinZ0HzpQ_Lw

Celine looked absolutely stunning, captivating the Friday night audience with her melodic voice & touching lyrics.  I felt quite a few goosebumps as she sang hits such as-

"But when you touch me like this,
and when you hold me like that.
I just have to admit,
that it's all coming back to me."

Our seats located in the rear orchestra had a great view of the stage, off center left.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#w6Yz3Dx-Wgzi0dRHERURxQ

Celine did several covers of other artists' songs, but I would've preferred if she sang more of her music library.  She even performed 2 hologram duets, one of which was interestingly enough, with herself.  Can't say I didn't get the most Celine Dion for the dollar ;p

"Cause I am your lady,
and you are my man.
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can."

Of course, the song that everyone anticipates, "My Heart Will Go On", lived up to all expectations & mesmerized the fortunate concert goers.  Towards the end of the song, Celine was surrounded by falling water that artistically cascaded down to make a magical experience, both audio & visual.  Think Fountains of Bellagio in reverse.

Can't have a concert w/o merchandise
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#84ZlgUYEgyq-PDy-eNr-YA

A true showstopper & deserving of headlining the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace,  Celine Dion puts on an extravagant show that will pull the heartstrings & touch you to your very soul.  Her powerful voice wil captivate & strike you with awe as to how such strength can come from such a small frame.  A tremendous show that absolutely has to be experienced before her run is done.

Highly recommend!

This chocolate heaven at the Aria hotel just makes me so happy. As soon as i saw those chocolate flowers on the wall http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=zqVvDm_-ikgvhPMZrUK3Lg, i was giddy!
There was the gelato bar with a great variety of flavors: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=7K-QKzgV0XdrlZOX9aMRng, a crepe station, sandwiches, cakes galore, pastries, chocolates and lots of fun and cute stuff - from wedding cake favors http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=wzlynGBt9AZbLQevhF8jjg to Thrilla
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=ZRq2lJn-JoOHLqUOZNYQVg
It was almost impossible to pick which cake i wanted. We settled on triple chocolate cake (so decadent!) topped with a fab macaron. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=HfgazxGFRJ6nZO2MXGcNsQ
We also shared a tasty crepe: rich and very indulgent. Loved it! 

One thing i didn't love was when I asked a worker if they sold individual macarons and the guy said yes and pointed me to the coconut macaroons. I was even more annoyed when I saw labels for the rose macaron cake say macaroon. However the prepacked macarons were labeled "French macarons".  Anthony N pointed it out to me that macaroon is the English translation for macaron; but seriously at Jean Philippe I would like to see it labeled Macaron, especially when they ALSO sell macarooooons. It's like a prestigious french restaurant having "fat liver" on their menu instead of foie gras. Luckily my annoyance quickly dissipated when i took a bite of that triple chocolate cake!!!

Butter. Sugar. Eggs. Flour. (BSEF) That's all you need to bake your basic cupcake.

But what if you're flying from SFO to LAS to visit your peeps, and you not only don't have any B,S,E or F, you have no time? You call The Cupcakery for a quickie delivery of some of the finest cupcakes east of the Cali border!

While cupcake delivery is a big, pricey splurge (almost $70 for a dozen... half of which is delivery charge), it' well-worth seeing the look of "Ohhh, man that's one good yummy piece of cake" on everyones face as they take a bite of these moist-caked & creamy-topped gems. I was impressed!

Plus, cupcakes are a delightful alternative to flowers, don't you think?

For the record, the Red Velvet was really good, and while it's usually my favorite, I really loved the Vanilla, too!  

It's nice to know the greater Vegas area has a place like the Cupcakery handy... especially since it's so close to my peeps!

I'm glad I had the chance to ride the High Roller, but at $21.95 during the day & $36.95 at night, I find it to be too pricey for just a souped up ferris wheel.  I recommend the High Roller as something to take a pic of from a distance, with or w/o selfie.

"To me, life without veal stock, pork fat, sausage, organ meat, demi-glace, or even stinky cheese is a life not worth living."   Anthony Bourdain

This little shop has it all:  wood chips, charcoal, wine, beer, spices, BBQ sauce, all-natural dog treats, and many cuts of meats from all sorts of animals.  Truly living up to their shop name, it is meat and spirits galore [mainly meat though].  So on our recent excursion, I bought some andouille brats and jalapeo & cheese brats to grill up.  I wanted to grab a jar of sauerkraut but Mr. W. voted against it.  What a stick-in-the-mud! Anyways, after boiling the brats and tossing it on the grill, we feasted, and it was delicious --- especially the jalapeo one. This place is a bit pricier than your average vanilla supermarkets but that's the price you pay for freshness and quality. Next time, I'm getting me some steaks.

Walking into this shop makes me feel like a caveman.  All that meat and beer!  But then I realize I'm wearing heeled booties with jeggings and it stops me from chestbumping every guy I come across. Just kidding... I chestbump the ladies. *sassy hair flip*

Ohhhh, Wow. 

What an absolute incredible experience, that you must visit to fully appreciate.  The time, the effort, the money, that went into creating this world class museum, makes the Musical Instrument Museum a must stop for anyone living, or visiting Phoenix. 

One of the great things that made our visit special, was the integrations of the high-tech head sets that activated whenever you approached a exhibit. It is similar, but slightly different to the ones found at The Getty in Los Angeles. 

Upstairs you will find a geographical, country by country musical instrument experience, with the largest being the United States. One of the helpful visual aids is the world map showing the countrys' location.  I don't care how knowledgable your geography may be, you'll be stumped more than once. 

Downstairs is devoted to individual musicians, such as John Lennon, Toby Keith, Elvis, The Police, Leonard Bernstein, Taylor Swift, Carlos Santana, Roy Orbison and much, much more.  They actually have Roy Orbison's hand written words (see photo) of Pretty Woman. Nice!  Let's face it, only at the MIM could you mention all those artists in one sentence.  If you are into guitars, the Fender exhibit is a must stop. 

Parking is free and Admission is only $18.00, an absolute steal. Expect to spend at least two hours plus upstairs and another two downstairs. The Caf Allegro at MIM is open from eleven until two.  Their self serve Caf is open during museum hours and serves Starbucks, soft drinks, beer, delicious cookies and some lighter fair. 

Trust me, whether you start upstairs or down, the Caf will look like a oasis from all that walking.

Enjoy!!

I wished Bellagio had an electroshock therapy vendor to administer temporary memory loss.  That way I could forget about every other Cirque show I've seen and "O" would blow my mind like it did the first time I saw it in 2002.  Sign me up and please hand me that rubber thing that stops me from biting my tongue.

The writer and director of the show, Franco Dragone, is freakin brilliant!  How in the world does one conceptualize a show like this and then explain to others how it's all supposed to work without being shoved into a windowless van with a one way trip to the funny farm?  I can only imagine the conversations he had before it got the green light:


Dragone: "So honey, it'll be a stage that will change from a big assed pool with 1.5 million gallons of water and back into a dry stage that can be walked on  throughout the show.  And then there will be a ton of synchronized swimmers and the theatre is going to look like a 14th century opera house.  I was thinking during dinner last night that there should be a guy in the show that will set himself on fire."

Mrs. Dragone: "Yes, dear. (rolls eyes)  Don't forget to mow the lawn tomorrow.  We have company this weekend."    


Later in the day....


Dragone: "Aerialists! Clowns! Contortionists! Trapeze! People on a Russian swing and swimmers everywhere!  Sometimes it will all happen at the same time!  Lots of leotards too!"

Dragone's ex-college roommate: "Yeah, yeah.  Sounds sweet.  Pass the bong already."


Sure, there are detractors that say it's too pretentious and artsy fartsy.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  After all these years, "O" is still inspiring, a welcome escape from reality, and a "can't miss" show in town.

Just an Overrated breakfast spot in Vegas.

They seem to focus more on presentation than flavor. The portions are big but the flavors are way off. 

Positive:

*The presentation looked great.

*Big portions for the price.

Negative: The taste 

*There was nothing special about the waffles even with the bacon inside. Just Tasted bland.

*The chicken breast had no flavor. Seemed like they focused on the crust and forgot to season the chicken.  

*The scrambled eggs tasted funny. How do you mess up on scramble eggs?  The eggs Tasted very generic...it's  like they added some type of filling to make it seem more. 
Me and my friend both looked at each other with disappointment after tasting it.

I should have Go Go gadget my ass out of there when I had the chance!

Little Darlings = FAIL

Heard this place could be a great fun spot for couples & has VIP booths with Hookah's but I guess I'll never REALLY know.

- Called & spoke to Hostess to set up a VIP Booth Package which includes Limo Pick up

- Limo driver called to confirm pick up time (12am)

- Limo driver called 45 min late & apologized he is running behind but he is on his way.

- Hour 1/2 Later Limo driver yet again apologizes and offer's discount on package

- 2 HOURS later.. almost 2am, LIMO driver NEVER SHOWS UP and DOESN'T PICK UP PHONE OR RETURN CALLS.

What pissed me off the most is this was all for my Fiance's Surprise 30th Birthday! Luckily the TOP CLUB of VEGAS "Spearmint Rhino" came through and their Limo picked us up in 5 minutes!

If you want to take your chances and risk getting stood up then by all means go to Little Darlings. But if you want A+ Customer Service in a flash go with Spearmint Rhino instead. 

Your loss Little Darlings... was going to spoil my love rotten that night at your club. :oP

I came here to celebrate my nephews 3rd birthday. The park is nestled in a neighborhood of houses. Since the park is dog friendly, I brought my dog, Brownie along for the party. I walked her on a trail that went around the park as well took her over to the large grassy area the park has to interact with the other dogs there. The grassy area isn't fenced in, so I was surprised at how many pet owners had their dogs off leashes, tsk tsk. The bathroom is large and has entry on either side of the building for males and females. They have an area where the kiddos can get wet, but unfortunately the day we were there the wind was blowing and it was cold, so most of the kids played at the playground. The playground is nice even though the swings were roped off for repair and I am a girl who loves to swing so that was a bummer! The park was clean and the area that was reserved for the party was spacious enough with a shade structure and the nearby bathrooms, BBQ grill and trash cans were convenient. They also have a small skate park too, but I didn't make it over to check it out fully. The water fountains were clean and lights came on in the park after a certain hour and lit everything up fine. All in all a decent neighborhood park.

I spent my morning at Echo Coffee doing some work and conducting some interviews... I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly the staff was when I walked in (even though Steve, the owner, gave me shit about how I ordered my coffee drink).  Thank goodness he warned me that a large americano at Echo comes with four (yes, four) shots of espresso.  I am good with two!  It turned out great and energized me for hours... and no sweetener necessary.

I noticed that in addition to the pastries in the case, there is an entire menu dedicated to sandwiches and salads and everything can be special ordered since there is a chef on premises.  I also met the biscotti maker when I was there.  How impressive that there is an entire team behind Echo, right?!

There is free Wi-Fi and outlets scattered around, plenty of seating, and clean restrooms to boot.  This may just become my new "go-to" coffee shop!  See you soon, Echo!

Look...I'm sorry...but I just don't get it. I like water, I like nature, intertubes are A-Ok in my book...so why do I loath this place. Well...here are a few reasons why:

-Drunk Assholes...everywhere. I can't stand annoying drunk people, and this place is a mecca for it. Whether it's the overweight frat guy or the backwoods overly-tanned middle aged yokul...everyone is drunk; and everyone is f*cking annoying as all hell.

-Dirty Water. I mean...seriously, I couldn't wait to take a bath once I left. Someone else in another review talked about getting a band-aid that was floating in the water stuck to them...doesn't surprise me.

-Getting burnt. I don't care what anyone says...you can slather on SPF -1000 sunscreen every five minutes...you're gonna leave here hurting. Blistering summertime heat in AZ...floating down a river for hours and hours...common sense says this just isn't a great idea. 

-Scratching your ass on rocks. If you've been there you know about this...sometimes while floating, the water level gets a little low and you have to really make an effort to lift your ass out of the middle of the intertube to avoid jagged rocks beneath...or else pain awaits...if you don't heed this advice...sorry...you're leaving with a bloody asshole that day. 

Well...I could keep going here...

Bottom Line: Just go to Sunsplash or Waterworld for God's sake...this place is not worth the hassle. The Lazy River at any waterpark completely OWNS this experience in my opinion.

Forget about those other foot massage places that "waste" your 1 hour treatment time by soaking your feet for half an hour. This no frills, straight to business foot massage business is the real deal!  No "happy endings" here, unless it refers to satisfied customers with their full body therapeutic massages.

I actually dropped in on a whim, as I was feeling very uncomfortable with severe neck and shoulder cramps. I did the quick Yelp search to see which massage places are still opened and picked one of the closest ones.  I parked at the massage place next door by accident, but am very glad I walked the last few feet to Good Season's Foot Spa () for their "ancient professional reflexology".

My therapist was Tom, and I learned that he has been doing this in California for 12 years. He was definitely an old pro at helping customers feel better with his expert hands.  If all you are expecting is a good foot massage, Tom will probably be overkill. If you walked in with sore shoulders and back, Tom is the one you should seek out.

I am so satisfied with my first experience that I made an appointment to go back in 12 hours.  Now if that is not a ringing endorsement, I don't know what else would qualified.

Note: $15/hour grand opening special applies before midnight, after that it is $20/hour. Visa and MasterCard accepted, but American Express is not recognized ($1 per swipe surcharge).

Crab Corner brought me back to my childhood with their Maryland blue crabs. I cried tears of joy when I tasted them for the first time. I had searched high and low for crabs that were seasoned just like I remembered them from back in the day and I hadn't found exactly what I was looking for until I found Crab Corner. This is easily one of my favorite places in Vegas. I just wish it was closer to where I live! 

The guys that own the place are as awesome as their food is. They're very friendly and are helpful with whatever you need. Good service, good times. Bring a bunch of friends and have at it. Crab Corner has a casual atmosphere that is perfect to drink a few brewskies and get down and dirty with some crabs. Bibs and a hearty appetite recommended!

This review is dedicated to my late grandfather, whom I acquired some of my writing genes from. He passed away before the new year. I used to eat Maryland blue crabs by the swimming pool at his house in the summertime. I will miss him.

4pm check out time, at no additional cost. In Vegas? Yes, it does exist, and it exists at Trump. It's an excellent buffer after going all night long, because the thought of getting up at 10 or 11 is just plain awful. 

The bathroom is huge and includes a shower large enough to fit a party of four people (if that's your kind of thing) and a bathtub deep enough to store all your winnings. And there's a TV in the mirror in the event you want to bathe in your money and catch some prime time.

The rooms are spacious and though there's no casino to amuse you, it's walking distance from some of the more desirable entertainment locations of the strip.

Your nose will also appreciate the distinct (and pleasant) smells in the lobby and elevator.

I agree with the other 1 star reviews. This place is a scam. 

Went there last night after a nice run at the craps table. I got duped into going into the VIP. Only after paying the $500 fee was I told that there was a drink minimum of $200 on top. Of course this was after the dance started and now I can't get my money back. Then the stripper told me that I needed to add a tip for the server and her. Now the $500 dance was going to be more like $800. I got up and demanded my Id and credit card back. They refused to give it back unless I signed off on the $200 hidden drink fee for drinks that never even arrived. I ended up leaving my I'd and credit card. 

Low and behold today I have a $400 charge on my card. I have already filed a dispute with my credit card company and plan on doing whatever I can to make sure other people are not scammed. 

This place engages in unfair and deceptive trade practices and should be shut down. 

Bottom line don't go there. If you do go, do not go in the VIP room and DO NOT pay with a credit card.  Stay away from this scam of a place. Go to spearmint rhino or sapphire if you are looking for some adult entertainment.

Last Sunday I slept in and missed the 9am yoga class that I was planning on going to at my gym.  Rather than skip yoga completely, I jumped online and noticed that Sumit's new Biltmore location (in the Town & Country Plaza) had a 2pm class taught by Beri (one of my fave yoga teachers), so I planned my day accordingly.  I really needed a sweat after spending the entire previous week eating and drinking my way through San Fran.

I was pleasantly surprised by how clean the studio was... and the bathroom had a nice shower too although I opted to go home to shower after class.  The class itself was the same format I've taken at other Sumit locations... a combo of flowing poses with some music in a very HOT room.  I look at Sumit's yoga as a combination of a regular flow yoga class and a Bikram class.  It is pretty intense and it was so hot last Sunday that I had to sit out a few poses.  I left dripping wet but I felt amazing! 

Instead of paying $18 for a drop-in class, I chose to pay $2 more to take advantage of the $20 for two weeks of unlimited yoga.  Unfortunately, packages from other Sumit locations don't transfer.  Have I been back? Not yet but I still have another 8 days to take advantage of it!

Salmon Craving Satisfied in Vegas - Who'da Thought!

SITREP

I found myself hitting the Happy Hour here at Red Square (located at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino) and it did not disappoint.  

THE SETUP

My sweet dance partner and I were jone'sin for some munchies before we hit a dance competition event, but there was not going to be any food there.

Interestingly enough, we had just talked about our uncles - how they both hail from Idaho - and hers is sportsman who catches Salmon from the Snake River.  So as we arrived into Red Square, two (2) menu items just JUMPED OUT at us, like 2 Chinooks, and so we "jumped on them", so to speak.

LE MENU

The items had Salmon on them!  So for us, this was meant to be:

(1)  I saw the Siberian Nachos, which consisted of Salmon, Crispy Potato Gautrette, Sour Cream, and Caviar, believe it not.  Absolutely delicious, and probably the most singularly different nachos I've ever had; and then,

(2)  We were BOTH intrigued by the Smoked Salmon Pizza, which consisted of generous strips of smoked salmon & pickled red onions.  [The flavor of the pickled red onions  was a bit much for Cassandra, but we resolved that issue by picking them off.]

THE LOWDOWN

Definitely plan on coming back to Red Square again when I hit Vegas again.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 37/100

The bf and I paid a visit to the Conservatory & Botanical Garden at Bellagio this past weekend :) It was all decked out for Chinese New Year, with festive decorations everywhere, incense burning, a tree made out of gold coins, and a giant mountain with practically full-sized horses in honor of the Year of the Horse. It was wonderful!

I hear they re-decorate it to match whatever season/holiday is going on at the moment. I would love to see each of the rotations in a calendar year!

The Conservatory is located just past the lobby in the Bellagio hotel - very easy and quick to get to. It has wonderful natural lighting coming in through glass panes in the ceiling, and has beautiful flowers and plants planted everywhere. Great photo op spot as well!

It actually wasn't as big as I remembered it to be when I came here as a child...but nonetheless, definitely something worth seeing during your visit to Bellagio!

There is a garden gift shop nearby where they sell nice souvenirs and trinkets :) There's also a store that sells the beautiful glass flowers hanging from the ceiling in the lobby of the hotel, but I'm sure they cost an arm and a leg just for one!

OK. So I was a little put off on a recent visit to Roscoe's. I chose yelp to rant and update my previous positive review. Two words. Chili Cook Off. Wait. I think that's three. Nonetheless I was a judge at Roscoe's chili contest and I have to say I HAD THE BEST TIME EVER! If I'm not invited back next year, I will stalk them until they give me a plastic spoon and 25 cups of chili to savor. The staff was amazing, helpful and very fun. Shout out to David for making me feel instantly welcome as it was a madhouse I tell you. Though I'm still picturing one entrants presentation, which was a toilet bowl, yep, you heard me, a toilet bowl and having gag reflexes, it was a clever way to display his chili. And funny. Did I mention funny? So thanks Roscoe's. You are THE sports bar in town and a great place to hang. P.S. You may want to have a jar of Tums on hand next time!

I'm ashamed to share that my 10-year old bike still has the hair on the tires, AND the tires were flat from having been in my storage shed for 6 years. Figured it was a good idea to get a tune up (and a helmet) before trying to ride again! 

The shop owner was so nice! $40 for the tune up and even though it was going to be ready later that day, he advised I leave it a bit to make sure the tires didn't need a new tube (they didn't). 

He patiently showed me how to put the bike rack on my car - even though I didn't buy it from him, I just brought it from home. 

He didn't try to sell me the most expensive option of the accessories and in the end, I got a tune up, a helmet, a bike lock and a headlight for $128 (including tax). 

He taught me about the gears on my bike and gave me a map of all the bike paths in Phoenix! All the while, charming banter. I feel like I've made a new friend! 

Not only can you buy bicycles and any accessory you may need for your bike at this little shop on Hatcher Road, I understand you can rent bikes here too; and, the shop is right by the canal so if you don't already own a bike but feel like riding, this would be a great launching point. 

Of course, I SAY that... let's see if I actually get on mine now...

Ted's is a Phoenix original by way of Buffalo and has probably fed tens of thousands ASU students and teachers over the years.

Ted's history is similar to that of other Hot Dog pioneers like Paul and Betty Pink, Nathan Handwerker, and Dick Portillo. All who started with just a Hot Dog cart, and grew their business into something very special. 

But Ted's is the immigrant story of Theodore Spiro Liaros, who came to the US from Greece at the turn of the last century.  

One of these days, someone will take the time to write the history of all the hard working Greeks who came here with just the shirt on their back, to start a restaurant or food business.

But I digress, because you come to Ted's to enjoy the charcoal grilled hot dogs and hamburgers and all the friendly conversation on line. Ahh, and those charcoals are white hot (see photo), which makes their food oh so delicious.  

They have Hot Dogs, Hamburgers, Brats, Italian Sausages, French Fries and home made beer batter like Onion Rings (photo), along with Milk Shakes and Malts.

Ted's is really just great food, served simply. I can highly recommend those afore mentioned All Beef Hot Dogs, Sausage and Onion Rings. All the tube steaks are $3.79 and you can take home some of their special bottled mustard for $5.39 as I did.

Enjoy!

Sorry to ruin the party concerning the high Yelp rating for this company, but this is my story. 

I called these guys and we agreed that they would come over to my house at 4pm for a regular service call. So I took off some time from the office to meet them at my house. I called them at 4:10pm and asked them what was going on, I had to leave a message. After a few minutes, they called me back and said they didn't have a technician near my house since they were in other parts of the valley so we would have to reschedule. WTF?

I rescheduled for the next week and while they called me about 15 minutes before the scheduled appointment, I told them that I was in another part of the valley and couldn't make the appointment. I then continued with my awesome lunch.

Go Go here for happy hour! From 4-7pm you can delight in their half priced apps and specialty cocktails. Their sushi rolls are meh, but their teriyaki ribs are falling off the bone, finger lickin' good! The cocktails seem to be concocted for little Asian girls (which is odd since there are no Asian girls in Scottsdale, especially now that my BFF and I are gone) - fruity with cutesy names like "Hello Kitty," "Harajuku Lover," "Shiso Horny," and "Kinki Kooler" just to name a few. My favorite was the "Turning Japanese" which was like biting into a vodka infused pear.

Service at the bar was wonderful - Victoria is the one of the cutest bartenders in Old Town (guys, go pay her a visit). Drinks were flowing and the food came out quickly.

In addition to the happy hour and Victoria, make sure you check out their restrooms and private karaoke rooms, complete with "entertainment" poles. If you end up spending a long time on their Toto toilets, people will understand why. Seat warmer and a bidet? You'll want to take your business there on a daily basis.

Last night, I had the realization that I am a true Scottsdale girl and I'm quite alright living in my Scottsdale nightlife bubble. 

Here are some differences I noted: 

Scottsdale: If you look good and are female, you get in for free and probably drink for free. 

Hurricane Bay: If you look good and are female, thug looking dudes will stand outside of your car making sex faces, causing you to make your male friend come and get you for fear of what happens if you open that door and walk out there alone. Then you pay $10 to get into a not so hoppin Halloween party. Guys hump your ass without asking and without buying you a drink first. 

Dress code for males in Scottsdale: Nice jeans, button down shirt, shaved or carefully groomed, and they usually smell like nice cologne. 

Hurricane Bay: wife beater and jeans that haven't been washed in weeks. Hair that says I just got out of jail and tats to match. Standard cologne called BO. 

Drinks are strong but their well vodka has to be a step above Gordon's. 

Also, I think there may be dealers right outside selling rohypnol. Needless to say it is a creeper's paradise. 

I'll stick with Blue, thank you!

Leave it to me to go to Las Vegas - a Foodie Mecca - and order a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch.  Granted, this sandwich was ordered while suffering from a food hangover from a fancy dinner tthe night before AND 6 am nachos earlier that morning, but work with me here and see me for the rough & tough PB&J (not P & BJ) gal that I be.

$3.95 for a freaking sandwich.  What a bargain!  At the sandwich place by my office in San Francisco, this pretty little focaccia & peanut buttery goodness would have set me back ten big ones.  Instead, I left with almost six dollars to blow on the wheel-of-fortune slot machines that call my name in their sweet, sweet way.

The $3.95 special was off the Kid's Menu, but I batted my eyelashes in an epileptic way that I haven't done since I ran a red light during my driving test and really, really, REALLY needed my license.

Two PB&Js later, Lindsey and I headed up to our room to prepare for another chaotic evening.

It seems as if I'm here once a week. 

When we moved to the Valley, our new house came with a pool. In other parts of the country this has always been a negative, but not here for obvious reasons. 

Mike, and everyone at Leslie have been sooo helpful in our transition of learning how to take care of our pool.  We did have some local pool services. But they only lasted 6-8 months before they sold the business to someone else.  That said, Leslie has always been here for us.  

The killer for me are the O-rings.  They're everywhere in your pool.  From the pop-up water blowers on the bottom, to the electric pump and filters. But here is where a dedicate pool guy like Mike is invaluable.  He takes what you bring him. Asks where it came from and then he goes over to his book -- BAM!  He gets you the part and tells you how to install it.  There is also an option of Leslie coming to you house to do the work for you.  Very nice!

I would also recommend that you sign-up for their email blasts and catalog delivery. It's a good idea because they will send you 10%, 15% and 20% off coupons once a week.  Delivery is usually free, but I like going to Mike who also accepts them.

The people complaining about the way Chars looks have no idea what a Juke Joint (or a Honky Tonk if that's your flavor.  Dive Bar if you can relate to that) is supposed to look like.  The lights are supposed to be dim.... the place is supposed to be small... The place will have a band that doesn't care if their makeup is on correctly.... the place should make you question if the walls might fall down if the music gets any louder and the dance floor should be small as JUKE JOINTS are usually kinda small!!!!!  Somebody please educate these folks on JUKE JOINTS.... Meanwhile, let me tell you about Chars.

If you're looking for absolutely NO pretentiousness, NO frills, Tables that don't cost $600, or basically the opposite of clubbing in Scottsdale .... Chars is your spot.  If you are interested in Rhythm and Blues and Soul covers and a rocking good time.... Chars is your spot.  If you are looking for a live music venue where people dance AND mingle with each other and actually speak and talk to you just because... Chars is your spot.  If you have stumbled upon my review because you are looking for a decent time.... Chars is your spot.  

 I absolutely LOVE Chars for everything that it is AND for everything that it is NOT.

I was staying with a bff for the week and on my last night in Vegas, we decided to go bar hopping downtown. He lived in N Las Vegas so we decided to get a room and not risk getting a DUI. I booked a last minute deal through a phone app and scored a room for pretty cheap.

The room was clean and modern-ish, but was the size of a walk-in closet!! A Kid Rock concert was happening right on Fremont and we happen to get a room on that side. It didn't matter since we weren't gonna be in the room anyways. If you old folks need sleep, don't stay here!

Over the last decade, we've had a few problems with our Lexus cars.  And, now for the rest of the story...

About eight years ago I was driving our five year old RX-300 from Seattle to Chicago, so one of our kids could use it at college.  We were outside of Bismarck, ND when all the lights on the dash lit up warning us that the car was about to fail.  The nearest dealership at that time was in St Paul, MN.  Yeah, I know LOL.

So after calling Lexus for advice, off we drove very nervously to MN.  We arrived safely around 5pm and waited nearly three hours for them to look at the car.  It was confirmed that the RX had some sort of unknown oil sludge build-up in the engine and that the engined needed to be replaced!  Replaced? Eesch!

We were asked various questions on where we had our service work done.  After verifing that we had all of our work done at the dealership in WA state, they offered us a Loaner.  Ummm I said, we're driving on to Chicago.  Not to worry, they would flatbed the car to us when it was repaired and to keep the Loaner.  Out of pocket costs?  Nothing!

Now, that story is eight years old and it reminds me of our current experience with our ES.  Seems the NAV & bluetooth link doesn't want to accept the new iPhone.  Yeah, I know, Apple right? LOL. After several attempts by us and the dealer, they are now replacing the entire system. Out of pocket costs?  Nothing!

We have owned other cars and have spent lots of $$$ with replair work, but no one backs up their cars like Lexus.  No one. Peace of mind? Priceless!

When Mimi's was bought by the French company LeDuff America, Inc. ("LDA") a US based subsidiary of Groupe LeDuff SA, headquartered in Rennes, France over eighteen months ago, I thought wow, finally they'll fix this place up. D'oh

If you don't know Le Duff America, their brands in North America and France include Brioche Doree, Caf Del Art, La Madeleine Country French Caf, Bruegger's Bagels, Timothy's Coffee and Michel's Baguette.  We fondly remember La Madeleine from living in other parts of the US and had such high hopes for our dinner here last evening

So... what Yelp rating would you give a french themed restaurant that forgets to add the bacon and cheese to their Quiche Lorraine?  

That's right. No Gruyre, or even Swiss cheese.  Just a fluffy egg mixture in a crust shell (see photo). I could go on and discuss the absent-minded, exceptionally slow service or a variety of other issues. 

Let just say I do not enjoy writing One Star reviews, and leave it at that.  

They do deserve at least one star for their delicious muffins.  Otherwise, it would be a zero. Sorry!

I'm the Duke so I'm not not a fan. 

Pros: 
-It's just $10 a month and serves its purposes. $20 if you desire massage and tanning machine privileges and other things that $10 more gets you.
-No commitment. You pay monthly and cancel anytime.
-Lots of cardio machines which include treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, stairs, etc. I'm guessing at least 40 machines for cardio so you're not really waiting to go running or walking.
-Clean and well maintained equipment. PF is still pretty new but I'm always seeing gym users and employees wiping down equipment and cleaning. If something ain't working its usually fixed asap.
-Almost everything is in pairs. If someone is using the 10 lbs dumbbells there's another set of 10 lbs dumbbells. If someone is using the leg extension machine there's another one. 
-Equipment are organized and spaced out. Arm equipment are grouped with other arm equipment, back equipment, chest, legs, abs, etc.
-Lots of TVs at least 20.
-Showers always a plus.
-The staffs friendly.
-Temperature and environment is set right.
-Gym is open 24/7 and the staff is there 24/7.
-The Lunk alarm keeping lunks in check.
-Ive never seen it too busy.
-Free pizza and donuts once a month!!!

Cons (not really cons its more like limits or what they're not offering):
-If you want to bench your options are smiths machine or max out with 75 lbs dumbbells.
-Free weight barbells limited to 65 lbs.
-You bring your own towels, soap, shampoo, etc. Its not a motel.
-You can't drop weights, they'll scold you or you'll set off the lunk alarm. 
-No sauna, swimming pools, basketball courts, scales to weigh yourselves.
-Cardio machines don't have USB connections so can't charge ur phones while running a long time. Sorry Android users with bad batteries.
-No free weight Olympic bars.
-3 showers.
-No classes like LVAC, 24hr fitness, or Gold's Gym.

I'm giving the Bobcats 3 stars because I don't love them, but yet I don't hate them.  Unless they are playing the Magic or the Heat...  I still don't hate them then...  I just don't want them to win.

I was able to see the Bobcats play the Magic in the playoffs back in 2010 in Orlando and it was such a fun and wonderful experience.  Luckily, my team (the Magic) won and we beat them by a pretty decent margin.  The final score that night was 92 - 77.

I did enjoy seeing the Bobcats play.  I love the NBA and I'm on a mission to be able to see every team play in person.  Hopefully I'll be able to accomplish that in my lifetime.  What was really super cool about this game is that Michael Jordan himself was there!  I was SO stoked about that!  I kept pointing and telling my husband throughout the entire game, "There's Michael Jordan!  There's Michael Jordan!"  I mean, I didn't get to meet him or anything as awesome as that, but we had great seats and I was able to see him the entire time.  I'm not sure if I did more basketball watching or Michael Jordan watching.  LOL

Even though I'm not a fan, the Bobcats are a good team and I'm still very happy I was able to see them play in person!   =)

Dropping my rating from a two star to a one star DISASTER!

I just wrote a review for the Citizens Kitchen & Bar last week.  I mentioned that the waiter George was "AMAZING!"   I retract my statement.  He is unethical and unprofessional.  He automatically included an 18% tip in our bill (see my original review) and not tell us about it (he got a 40% or an $80 tip on a $210 total bill).   We would have been OK with the 18% tip for a party of 8, but just tell us about it so we wouldn't double tip you!

We just checked our credit card statements, and George DOUBLE CHARGED us when we asked him to split our bills.  This means that he charged us 150% for our food and drink bill!  UNETHICAL!  Here's a summary of this horrible restaurant:

1)  We weren't told that Waiter George included an 18% tip on our bill.
2)  We added an additional 20% tip, raising his tip to $85+ on a $210 bill.
3)  We were charged an additional 50% for our food, bringing our total charge to $300+ on a food tab of $168.
4)  To top it off, the food is HORRIBLE here!

AVOID!  Shame on the owners and wait staff of Citizens Kitchen & Bar!  We're working with the credit card companies to resolve this mess!

Fukuburger, Fuku so good!

Located inside FAME at the LINQ, Fukuburger offers innovative Asian-inspired burgers, fries and loco moco for those looking to tantalize the palate.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#k0iG_a95OyoEJpJz9Fumsg

When I saw the Tamago burger ($7.99), I knew I had to have it.  I'm an egg slut from way back.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#gr4jTA0IVQkD2Pw7J-Qd9w
Fuku-patty with furikake & teriyaki, finished with crispy onion rings & fried egg.  The first bite was like a rainbow shining down on me. Like Willy Wonka farted candy into the air.  Runny egg oozing over the delicious patty, the sweetness of the teriyaki married together with the crunch of the onion rings.  A fairly sized burger, I felt the pricepoint was a decent value, considering it is Vegas.  I relished each delicious bite.

Service was okay.  It took a while for my burger to be cooked, but I know it's made fresh to order so I can't complain.  There is bar seating directly in front, with tables insided & outside FAME.

Free jelly candy!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#DNzhAcLMgJFh-kOR8wLL_w

Fukuburger, I'm a big fan!  The Tamago burger was the real deal & one of the highlights, of many, from my trip to Vegas.  I hope you come back to SoCal so I can satisfy my cravings for your Asian-inspired delectables again!

Highly recommend!

Like the 80s group ABC sang "It's so hip, so hip it hurts"... But hurt in a good way (you know, like nice, naughty spanking) and not bad hurts like the sound of Lindsay Lohan's voice. Are we clear? I was an Urban Studies/Architecture major in college and I love this whole 50s style meets mid modern meets Scottsdale. From the lobby to the grounds to the pool to our charming, color splashed, glass brick adorned room, this was a major score in the Staycation category. I was initially intimidated by the pool crowd as I noticed NOBODY was actually IN the pool. Just posing around the pool. Were they looking at my pasty white Scandinavian skin? My extremely, freakishly small nipples? Or the Hello Kitty towel I brought from home? Hmmm..fBack to the room....the glass brick divided the room from the shower...and what a fabulous shower. Nice, big, pulsating head. Honestly, I'm not trying to go all pg13 on ya! Bed and bedding were cozy and spotless. A great place to crash after Rickie's headlining collection at Phoenix Fashion Week. The room was at one point spacious enough to accommodate Mr. Gonzales, the stylist, the assistant and anywhere from three to eight models. I was comfy on our fabulous bed with a glass of wine watching it all unravel in front me. Who needs TV? It was very entertaining. And when I needed to escape we had our own private patio. Wait? Wasn't that a B52s song? So Valley Ho...you are hip. But you're also great deal. A great venue. And yes, maybe even, OK, I"m getting a little vaklempt, a great friend....

REVIEW # 100 !!! 
Blue Man Group, at the Venetian Hotel in Vegas, was entertaining, educational and musical all the same time. I had the pleasure of attending Blue Man with my entire extended family and I have to say- I think this was the best situation to see the show.  

The show was interactive and even slightly captivating at times. Audience members are escorted to the stage to participate and the members of the show walk through the aisles, and sometimes even climb over the seats.  You can't get much more interactive than that.  

There are two shows, one at 7 pm and one immediately after it at 9pm.  I dont know how those guys do it, they have to clean the entire theatre after having just trashed it.  

I have to say- I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more paint involved.  It seemed more of a comedy/music show that I thought.  So much emphasis had been put on the pipes and paint, but very little time was actually dedicated to them.

Would I see it again?  You know, I think Blue Man Group is a treat to see once but seeing as the show hasn't changed at all since it opened, it will almost positively be the same if you went back again.

This little restaurant is a gem of a find! There might just be a bit of confusion about the name, because the signage in front says "Bisteces", with "Cuban Bakery & Restaurant" appended to it, while their business card (and facebook page) says "Cuban Foods Bakery & Restaurant." 

 I had lunch here with Rand H., Mike C., Scott W., and Jose C. and it was a really enjoyable gathering. Our hostess was so friendly and gracious, and the food was great! We shared some delectable croquetas for appetizers and I ordered my favorite ropa vieja - it was such a savory delight. It came with a side of moros y cristianos - black beans and rice, made even more flavorful with pork cubes (sorry, vegans). I'll let my other friends tell you of their orders in their reviews, but this restaurant is certainly one to return to often - and I will, because it is so near where I live, and the prices are really good.

Grab your fork and knife.  No slices here.  True Napolitano pizza in Vegas (or as close as you're gonna get without a trip to Italy).

So it's a small chain of restaurants, all good.  Quality ingredients atop a perfectly blistered, chewy, well seasoned crust served by a proud and friendly staff.  Win!  

This is the real deal.  They even follow the the standards laid down by the Italian government that define such trivial things as the basic ingredients of the crust, its thickness, and the cooking temperature.

The Margherita DOC is excellent.  The standard to judge all Napolitano pizza by, a simple base of crushed, ripe, acidic tomatoes, fresh milky Mozzarella, fresh basil, and a splash of EVOO.  Near perfect.  The diavola with its fennel flavored, gently aged finnochiona, sweet roasted peppers, garlic and mozzarella equally good.  Too simple?  The pizza Capricciosa with its aged, porky porsciutto, oil poached artichoke hearts mushrooms olives basil all atop the same sweet, acidic tomato pure topped with fresh mozzarella, outstanding without being overloaded with toppings.

The only weakness, the namesake Settebello.  The sausage lacked the aged, umame flavor so characteristic in Italian cured meats.  A minor point considering.

Very inexpensive for the quality.

Now if they would just move the tables much closer, encourage chatting it up with your neighbors, get some disposable paper table coverings and serve an abundance of wine....

As a gay man, I came here to support one of my best friends at a bachelor party. Even though I informed every stripper that approached me that I am gay and not interested, two of them proceeded to give me simultaneous lap dances against my will. I told them to stop, but I couldn't exactly push them off of me without getting into trouble with security. Then they had the nerve to charge me. Yes, I was at a strip club, so I kind of brought this all on myself, but I feel the need to comment because, geez, if the strippers are that pushy with an openly gay dude I can't imagine how pushy they would be with a straight dude who didn't want a lap dance. 

There are guy strippers upstairs but the club has a strick "NO GAYS" policy, so gay guys really aren't welcomed here. If you have a group of ladies/bachelorette party and plan on inviting gay friends, you should call ahead and make sure they will be allowed in with you upstairs (perhaps OG might make exceptions if notified in advance, but I honestly doubt it).

Maybe its just me, but can we get with the times people? It's 2013; gays and straights hang out together. I'm not saying cater to gay people, just make us feel reasonably welcomed if we come with a straight group.

I've been a patient of Dr David Matter for over ten years, putting up with a twenty-plus minute drive since moving from Gilbert to Chandler.  I didn't enjoy the drive, but I really liked him, so my eye never wandered... until one day a fancy mailer caught my eye.  I recall seeing the phrase "paraffin wax", and baby, that's all she wrote.

After walking into the unassuming office, which faces Alma School (you'll park on the opposite side of the building), I excitedly anticipated which part of my anatomy would be waxed.  The office is adjacent to a colon hydro-therapy business, so I really didn't know what to expect.

Mesha greeted me, and suggested I take a seat.  After blurting out something about spa treatments, she summoned Dawnie, who I immediately took a shine to.  She was utterly charming, referring to moi as "sugar" and "honey".  Where's the tip jar, cuz daddy's ready to slap it down!

After being ushered to one of their "relaxation rooms", and seeing an ultra-modern massage chair, I shifted focus to Dawnie and let out an "Oh Mama!".  She coaxed my shoes off, and had me dip my paws into a crock pot of translucent wonder.  First the palms, then the backsides.  Each hand was bagged and summarily placed into a soft mitten.

I was led to the chair, which had foot massage apparatus, which I have never seen before.  Asking for a photo, I realized my camera was tucked into my front pocket.  Dawnie, realizing I was about to try and stuff my baker-sized oven mitt in my jeans, offered to take the photo and text it to me.  The massage chair was activated, and I spent the next 15 minutes in Pamper-ville.

Tessa, my hygienist, came to fetch me.  She even carried my clod hoppers to the cleaning room.  Total sweetheart.  After completing the cleaning, I had the pleasure of meeting Dr Caryn Lee.  The whole experience was one pretty woman after another.

I love ya Dr Madder, but these breezies got me on lock.

ps. They have the ability to mold your crown in-house, same day, so NO TEMPORARIES!!!  YAY!

You know what? I watched the Pound Puppies too. I had dreams of rescuing one of those little Hogan's Heroes clones from their little prison, but in real life that isn't necessarily the best way to go.  Cooler never got parvo.

There is a lot of tramatic backstory to my dog ownership that i will spare you but lets say I have been scarred and it took a lot for me to agree to go here to even look.

Several kennels were full of dog shit...haha yeah dogs live there, no sick looking dogs laying in puddles of runny wrong coloured dog shit, it kennels with healthier looking dogs rolling around in the same sick shit. Yes I am being intentionally vile with my language to make the poit of how vile it was. SHIT!

We saw a dog that we loved. I said no; she said please...then a woman told us this dog was on "the list" yup his last day on god's green earth if he didn't get adopted so we took him. A day or so after we pick him up his little cough is turning into a scary and serious sounding wheez so we take him to the vet, over a thousand dollars later we are told the dog has both pnemonia and parvo...surprise surprise since we picked hi up he had dried SHIT in his fur (keep in mind he was not to be bathed for two weeks because of having just been neutered, yes a freshly operated on dog with dried shit in his fur)
 Oh and puppies don't really recover from that sort of thing so w paid the very nice vet to kill out dog...euthenasia...super....

As she bawls her eyes out I man up to call and let the MCACC know hoping they can take some preventative measures, ya know like not let other dogs roll in the shit that he left. (Parvo is super contagious). They let us know the only action they would take was to make note in our file so that if we went to adopt again they would know we didn't already have a dog in the household...yup...My next dog will be adopted from a much more responsible shelter. I understand low budgets and whatnot but how much does it cost to hose runny shit out of a kennel? GRRR.

When you get tired of DJ's and electronic music and you're ready for some authentic music made by actual musicians, this is the place for you.

The minute you walk in you realize that this isn't some honky tonk dive, this is a very dark, classy place, with a large bar and plenty of seating. The stage is well appointed and there's even an area next to the stage that looks to be a VIP lounge.

This is the type of place that you would normally find in NYC, LA or Nashville, so its a great addition to Scottsdale. It reminds me of the type of place where you might have found Johnny Cash, Frank Sinatra, or George Jones taking the stage back in the day. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if this becomes the place where national musicians go to play a few unannounced sets when they are in town.

Gotta say, in just one visit The Western has become my favorite new place in town.

"You can make the reservation, but you cannot hold the reservation."

Here with a bachelor party last Saturday night and we had a table reservation for the crew. We got there at 10:30pm and they told us we we were too late (claimed we had to be there by 10pm) and they had given our table away. After some bickering they let us in and we found that half the tables in the club were unoccupied and they were most definitely not sold out. 

With some pushing we eventually claimed a table and the night was saved. My poor friend who organized this part of the bachelor party weekend definitely lost a few hairs from the stress of the table initially falling through.

XS charges way too much money to screw up like that, so even though it's one of my favorite party spots in Vegas they only get 3 stars.

I love the juxtaposition of Modern Steak. A straight forward, steak house type menu in an Elton John over the top decorated space. My goal, one day, is to swing from chandelier to chandelier while chowing on my Kobe burger. 

Our service was swift, friendly and well...practically perfect. The soft sour cream and chive butter with the foccaccia style bread is a total knockout. I was smearing it on my lips like Carmex. We started with the lobster chowder which was served in these hot metal bowls. Chowder was ok. Not amazing and definitely could have used some seasoning (nutmeg, allspice!?)...lobster was adequate, if not a little chewy. Mac n cheese was also good, but nothing to make me do my Meg Ryan from When Harry Meets Sally impersonation. 

The Kobe Burger? Total home run! Outstanding. Perfectly cooked. Love the homemade 1,000 island, the applewood bacon...all yummy yummy. As were the fries which were served with a side of ketchup. Missing was the trendy aioli that so many other restaurants seems to offer now. 

Modern Steak gets a solid 3.5 stars Love the textures and colors and am looking forward to swinging by again soon.

I came here yesterday for the first time and thought, wow Culver's has merged with Portillo's. Then my food came and realized it was more like a takeoff of Steak 'n Shake.

The atmosphere at Freddy's is very much like a cross between Johnny Rockets (lots of shinny nickel) and Steak 'n Shake. Actually when I think of it, Steak 'n Shake is more like Johnny Rockets, LOL. 

I believe my friends Kay and Monica are both right; with reality for me somewhere between their two reviews.  Granted I only had a Chicago Dog ($3.39), a Chili Dog ($3.59), a medium drink ($1.79) but the tab was a bit pricey at $9.48. 

Because the tube steaks are Vienna Beef, their taste is very good. The Chili dog was tasty, but I'll skip their Chicago interpretation next time. It comes on a Nedick's (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nedick's) like toasted slice bread bun, where the dog is trying to escape the toppings (see photos) 

The hot dogs also appear to be only #10s (10 to the pound), so I'll go with the burgers next time. If Freddy's was only a hot dog place, I probably would skip it in the future. But I enjoyed myself and want to try those steakburgers. Again, think Steak 'n Shake but without the Five-Way Chili

So Three Stars "A-Okay and I'll give Freddy's another try in a few weeks.

Let me start this Yelp by saying I've never given the business to a stripper. Are we clear? Ok.

I'll tell you why this place gets five stars... Because not one but two of the dancers offered to go home with me. 

One for $250. She said "If you have $250, we can go somewhere together." And then she licked my ear and showed me her guns. Her shift was over and she was in street clothes, mind you.

So guess what happened next? 

Stripper two (who actually did leave with me - long story) said, "Gross, some skanky girl licked you and her breath was terrible." I was embarrassed, yet psychologically removed from that experience.

What happened with Stripper two is a great story but I don't know that I want to share it here. But if you go to this club, one piece of advice (Useful alert!): the less attractive dancers require money to leave with you. The self-possessed hotter ones do not. However, if you get her naked in your bed, do no verify pre-coitus that she is not, in fact, a prostitute, because she will leave and call you names as your front door slams behind her. Or so my buddy tells me. Such trifling arrows of human amusement are not found in this man's quiver of irresponsible behavior.

"Time to make the Donuts!"  "America runs on Dunkin!"   I just love TV jingles.

We have been coming to this Dunkins since it first opened nearly three years ago. The family who owns the franchise works very hard and is customer friendly. The coffee is very good and it doesn't have that burnt taste like SBUX.  On most days, they give the green mermaid a real run for her money and mine. 

On the downside, the coffee sometimes can be either too strong or too weak.  I'm assuming it has to do with employees pulling the coffee from the urn too early when the Drive-Thru backs up. But otherwise, it's the same great Dunkin experience you would expect in the Midwest or New England.

Also, if you sign up for their email blasts, you will receive early notices of sales and discounts.  Recently, they had a special of two one pound bags of any of their coffees for only $12.99. Nice!

Eh cuz, we go grind!

Food from the 808.  Well kinda.  More like Korean take out and a spam musubi on the side for good measure.  

Rant:
1.  Hawaiian food and the iconic plate lunch is NOT Korean take out with four choices of vegetables.
2.  Stop throwing pineapples on everything and calling it "Hawaiian".
3.  Just because they say it on Hawaii Five-0, calling me "brah" or asking if I "hang ten" does not make you cool, it just makes you sound stupid.

How does it stack up?

Excluding the more traditional Korean items, these are island flavors.  Heavy handed on the salt and MSG, lots of sweetened shoyu (soy sauce) infused with ginger and garlic marinades.  Portions are West coast sensible, no two pound plate lunch.

Kalbi, meat jun, BBQ beef, BBQ chicken all greasy, oily, and deeply flavored.  Two scoops rice, macaroni salad, some Korean style veg.  Done.  Hawaii Yeeps, think Yummys.
 
A bowl of saimin (not ramen) with slices of spam, egg, kamaboko maybe some won ton and green onion in a supercharged MSG based bonito broth taste like Shiro's.  Exactly as it should.  The fried version, oily, salty and plain.  Hawaii hotel banquet quality.

A-OK.  Kanak attack.  Out.

- Three check-in lines (outdoor wait list, indoor wait list, confirmed reservation).

- Franco / American caf menu at reasonable prices.  

- Great selection of French wines by the glass or bottle.  Glass prices are VERY high.

- Friendly, bordering on unprofessional service (faked French accents for some tables, Parisian style silence for others).


The food is below average.  High point;  the baked brie starter.  Served in a hot baking dish, accented with hazel nut oil and honey that perfumes the air.  Unctuous.  Rich.  Just good eats.  Unfortunately, the escargot is the opposite.  Tender morsels of snail dressed with hard parsley stems.  Ack.

Mains fail to deliver. A paltry two ounce, steak sandwich served with an overly reduced, sweet onion au jus.  A croque monsieur made with pressed deli ham.  Very low quality (sub USDA choice), albeit inexpensive steaks.  Frites that accompany almost every dish are terrible.  Some crisp, most soggy, rubbery, and oily.

Worth a single visit to enjoy a bottle of wine and see the fountain show.  After all, the Parisian authenticity is enhanced by the confetti of playboyesque images on cards that litter the sidewalk below and well lit mobile billboards of  scantily clad "Hot Hot Hot Ladies" crossing your view.

The Cycle Pub Crawl took us here as one of the stops but we wish they hadn't. For a chain restaurant, their prices are designed to gouge the nearby tourists. $16 for one Coke and one poorly crafted margarita. This is what you'd expect to pay at a nightclub, but not a crappy chain restaurant.
We all ordered drinks upon arriving and a couple of us had to flag down servers for a missing soda and margaritas. We watched the bartender keep dropping his drink recipe notes. The nachos were disgusting. It tasted like stale chips with what looked like dog food on top...I wouldn't feed this to my dog. The servers had no idea who ordered what and settling the bill was a monumental task for them. Make sure you count your change before you leave.
A very disappointing experience.  I wouldn't waste my time or money since there are plenty of other better places to go nearby.

Do not order large drinks here. 

They use the same amount of coffee in all sizes. Coffee is the most expensive part of an espresso drink, selling larger drinks with the same amount of coffee at premium prices is dishonest. 

I know of NO other shop that sells coffee in this manner, a large drink always means more coffee.

One star until this policy changes.

EDIT: 

Just physically removed from Roosevelt Tavern by the owner Matt Poole (same owner of Giant) because: 

"You are an asshole. You proved it by not fixing your Yelp! review for over two weeks. You are not welcome in any of my places ever again." 

I responded that this was actually the first time I'd ever spoken directly with him, he said I owed him a phone call and that I didn't know how social media worked. By leaving a bad review I was stealing food from his children's mouth. ?? 

Also the owner of Matt's Big Breakfast, keep this in mind when you're deciding where to spend your hard earned money.

The service and selection at Churchill's is as good as it gets! 

A friend of mine bought me a humidor from here as a gift. There was a continual problem with the small humidifier that attaches to the inside of the lid. 

After many attempts at fixing the issue, they made the decision to upgrade me to the next size, almost twice as big as well as upgrading the humidification system inside the box. 

Every time I walk in I'm greeted with a hello and if I need anything they're right there to take care of me. 

I drive out of my way to go here and this is the only place in town that I'll buy my cigars from.

I have to interrupt my chain of wedding related reviews for this one... I've always been a huge supporter of animal rescue organizations, and while I rescued Minnie from a small rescue site seven years ago, I've supported the Humane Society through the years with monetary donations as much as possible.  But yesterday, I did something different...

I started my day (just like Melissa H) by rolling over to look into Minnie's eyes and be reminded how lucky I am to have an incredible dog that has become my family... After our morning walk and breakfast, I teamed up with a group of friends and we made the trek out to Dobbins Road and 19th Avenue to volunteer at the Humane Society.  I had no idea what to expect and I hadn't seen the reviews that came before mine, but I was extremely impressed at the size, cleanliness, and friendly staff at this fabulous facility.

During our three hours on-site, Kathy Chumley gave us a tour of the building,  told us about the history of society, and educated us on how they operate, the animals they care for, the staff they employ, the volunteers that help, etc... We saw the cutest dogs, cats, bunnies, and horses and we helped with feeding the horses, petting the cats and bunnies (I guess this helps socialize them), and putting leashes together too.

If and when I adopt another animal, the Humane Society is where I'll go to do it... and I highly suggest checking this place out if you're looking to add to your family as well.

Probably the best deal you can get in Vegas.  For the price of one hand of blackjack you can get a nice hot sandwich and a full belly.  

I came back twice just because I liked it so much.

I dug the Veggie (lent) and it was pretty awesome!  I also had the full Montague and it was delish as well.  The meat is perfection, nice and rare and juicy, I just wish I could have a huge pile of the meat!

The Caprese was okay, I kinda felt like it was an afterthought.  And their was only one piece of basil for the entire sandwich....I'd skip that one next time.

Someone should open up a franchise in LA because it would make a killing.

Not worth it at all!

Unless you have a half-off coupon, Wicked Spoon was barely par with the $20 buffets at the cheap hotels. Sure they have some fancy "looking" items, but they all fell flat. And at the premium price point, you'd expect some crab legs or a big seafood station but not here nor there was it found. 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=gSJmRozD1spFYGe8yhzPQA#gSJmRozD1spFYGe8yhzPQA

It was definitely the worst "fancy" buffet in Vegas I've been to.

It's been a few months strong, but I am still in love with Pleaissant Croissant Patisserie!  How can you not be? 

The minute you walk in, you feel as if you are at a caf in Paris!

I now have had time to try the many items they offer, from flavored croissants, breakfast croissant sandwiches, salads, coffee, water, tea.

Every single time, the croissants are soo light, buttery melt in your mouth good! I have worked my across most of the flavored one, though the Cherry Cream is my favorite all of them are so very delish!!

So happy to have found this little bit of heaven!

Okay, while I love Chris and I love his product I despise their group reservation policy. We called weeks ago for a reservation for 9 towards the end of May, they told me that we need to call one month to the date at 5 o'clock.. so today that call was made at 5 o'clock, the stupid matter of factly bitch told me that the reservations were gone at 4:30.. okay, if you're going to fuck around with the way you do things that's one thing, but being a dumb bitch about it is completely another. 

I think I'm finally over my love for this place.. I mean 3 weeks ago we showed up and was told the wait was 4.5 hours.. I don't wait that long for pizza.. while his pizza is great, its just fucking pizza.

Advice: get a bigger place!!

Sorry but I'm still fuming mad!!

A coworker tried to make out with my boyfriend at happy hour here and I still freaking love it! I mean, what a great time, right? Sake bombers, sushi, random drunk broads coming on to your boyfriend because you spent too much time playing with the toilet controls in the bathroom?  Seriously girls, be careful in there.

Thankfully, my boyfriend did not give in to Drunky McSluttersons advances. However, the fact that she even had the gall to attempt it is really a testament to how awesome Geisha A Go Go's happy hour is. Chick was wasted. Hard not to get drunk when everything on the damn drink menu is half off! I think we were drinking $3 beers and $1 Sakes. $1! Truly wonderful.

The "House Maki" is half off also, which usually means basic rolls like California and Tuna, but nothing fancy. Geisha A Go Go's "House Maki" includes quite a few of the fancier roll selections, including one of my faves, the rainbow roll.  The sushi is really nothing to write home about, but when you got a nice buzz going on with aforementioned $1 Sakes, you don't really notice.

To recap: Happy Hour is awesome, Sushi is Okay, Bathrooms are time consuming, Don't take slutty coworkers.

This location is in Green Valley just off the 215 freeway.

TOTAL meltdown in service. Slow and non apologetic about the service from the management. Wasn't just me, it was all tables and they keep filling em up no matter what. Was there 1 1/2 hours and couldn't even get dessert. CRAZY!

Huge food portions, blah nothing to taste but presentation of the food was nice.

Lack of leadership with excuses. Didn't really care too much about excuses as I'm the customer and went with an expectation of quality food and professional service.
Neither was delivered on this visit.

I may or may not go there again

Suffering from dysania?  Get yo'self outta bed and into Lush for some eye-opening products!  Just breathe.  It smells so pretty in here~

The moment they opened Lush up at Chandler Fashion Center, I rejoiced.  No more trips out to Scottsdale or ordering online to get all my bubbly needs!  But with that comes a significantly lighter wallet.  Help me.

I love everything about this shop.  The sales people are always so stinkin' sweet and they let me play and touch everything.  Always quick with product selection and are walking product-know-it-alls, they recommend some of the best items ever without being pushy.  We all know what I mean:  those sales rep that scare you into buying their goods... it doesn't happen here!  It's a spacious shop with lots of goodies and it's always an exciting and divine-smelling trip.  Where else will a friendly face offer you a facial or hand massage while scrubbing some dead skin off you?

I love their bubble bars [Blue Skies & Fluffy White Clouds ultimate fave], their Dream Cream, the Popcorn Lip Scrub, Floating Island body melt, It Started with a Kiss lip stain, Honey I Washed The Kids soap, the limited edition Rose Jam shower gel, et cetera. There's just so much to love, so much to buy!  Don't forget to ask for some free samples when buying some goodies.

Not absolutely sure if this is the first business of this business model to open in the 702, but I am absolutely sure that it is the newest and only business of this kind currently in operation.

Cafe Teaze is what I would considered a hybrid business model combining a boba tea shop and a Vietnamese coffee shop (just Google or Bing it if you want to know more).  Specifically, the menu is what you would normally find at a boba tea house in California and the waitstaff are all bikini or lingerie clad women. The best part for me and I am sure for the target market is that these waitstaff are friendly and beautiful, and could easily transition from serving you boba milk tea to fitting right in at import model photo shoots.

What can you order here?  11 types of milk teas (from the simple milk tea to Ma-Cha Ice Cream Milk Green Tea with or without boba), 5 different iced flavor teas (Lychee Green Tea and Passion Fruit Black Tea are what look the most appealing to me right off the bat), 6 varieties of Flavored Snow Ice, 5 hot milk tea options and 9 snacks (popcorn chicken, fried wontons, and spiral potato just to rattle off a few).

Let's be frank here, even if your name is not Frank or Francis Underwood, I am here first and foremost for the eye candy, without getting hassle for doing the looking. That reality is what the proprietor is relying on in attracting new customers. However, the beverage and food are what the owners are banking on for lots and lots of repeat business after the novelty wears off a bit.

For me hopefully the novelty will never wear off :)

Today, Hubby and I rode from Jefferson and 12th St. (the stop closest to our house) to Mill Ave. and 3rd St. in Tempe to check out the Metro Rail and have lunch at Rula Bula. Christ Almighty, it was crowded. Both ways we waited for the next train because there was no room on the first one. There was really no room on the second one either, but it was squish or not bother going. I can also see that there will need to be some training of Valley passengers regarding rail etiquette:

1. Give the people getting OFF the cars a freaking second to do so before barrelling in. 
2. Don't sit on the floor of the car. Not only are you more likely to get stepped on (especially if the conductor sucks, and the one on the return trip had a lead foot), but you are also taking up 2-3 times the space of someone standing. 
3. Wear deodorant, people.
4. There's no need for you to stand on the edge of the platform and crane to see the cars coming. It will not make the Metro Rail come any faster.
5. Be considerate of others, and maybe not rap loudly about "it's yo' birf-day, so I'm a-gonna kill you," on a crowded rail car. 

Now, I do have high hopes for the Metro Rail, and Hubby and I already have plans to use it again this week- but we'll be waiting until the free days are over. Full? I hope it will be. Crazy, chaotic, and dangerous? We hope that will not be the case regularly. There were many people around us who admitted they were riding it with no destination at all, just back and forth, up and down. Wish I had that much free time.

Up until this past week it's been about four years since I've been to Corleone's. My wife ordered a chicken sandwich which she loved. So that was a major hurdle to satisfy the picky eater in the family.

 I had the sausage, greenpeppers and onions with the marinara sauce. Since I've been minimizing my consumption of bread lately, I just ate everything except the bun. The presentation of the meal is pretty impressive when you look at two large buns filled with stuff. But when you get into the meat of the meal you find that there's a lot more bun than meat. I have to say that I enjoyed the meal but thought the ratio of meat to bun was pretty weak.

I say this place is Yelped correctly at 3 1/2 stars.

When I first started buying BB I thought it was the greatest thing EVER!! 
I got tons of beautiful produce and I loved going early to help distribute the Baskets. 

Little by little my basket became more and more unusable. The quality went down hill. 
I would be getting the same things week after week, things that were next to rotten upon receiving, everything was sooo dirty and some things that I would just never use, like 6 onions and 6 bell peppers. 

I recently switched to all organic and I thought I would order one of the organic baskets this week for a change. 

I've got to tell you I feel robbed. Honestly this basket sucks! Most of the items weren't even labeled as organic and I wasn't able to volunteer this morning so I don't know for sure if they even are. 

I don't know about you but I don't need 3 bundles of celery. Again the filth that these veggies are covered in is inexcusable. 

I spent $18 last week at the OTFM and got so much more CLEAN organic produce. BB charges $25 for their organic basket of junk. 

I will not be ordering these again. You really could do better at the grocery store or farmers market if you want produce and then you can choose to buy locally or U.S. grown veggies.

Horribly sweaty girl is hungry after Critical Mass.  Cheese on the mind.  Critical Mass ended by going down Central and I had never been to Cheuvront before.  Luckily, I was with Ayesha and it took nothing to convince her to go there.  
There were 7 of us and they were extremely quick in pushing table together for us.  They didn't even mind our sweat and water bottles.  The server even filled Ayesha's for her.  
I took one look at the menu and my eyes stopped at the bottom: macaroni and cheese.  I rarely eat it, but as soon as I saw it, I wanted.  Badly.  Ayesha said she liked the bleu cheese.  SOLD!  I effing love bleu cheese.  
For $8, I think it was a good value.  It was a good portion, but not too much.  Rich and creamy with gargantuan hunks of genuine bleu cheese, that had started to melt.  It was incredibly filling for the size!
Downfall: Unisex bathrooms.  What the hell!  I don't care how nice a place is, guys still piss all over the place.
The mac and cheese is $5 during the week during happy hour.  I will be back for it, most definitely!
Huge points for the server who took Amy in stride when I told him I'd spank his ass for something.  (I don't remember, as it was 109 degrees and I had been on my bike for over 2 hours.)

This review is for Sundays Xs Nightswim with Wolfgang Gartner. Man what was amazing site. It's just surreal to see half of the people wearing club attire , and the rest wear swimwear. It's just whole different vibe on a Sunday. Xs nightswim has a cool,crazy, and chill atmosphere all at the same time. Hat's off to the Wynn amazing pool . A perfect place for the pool party. Beach Club by day, and Nightswim by night. For me the best is to get a cabana so you have your space to hang out, and going in and out of the pool.
Wolfgang threw down a crazy set. His up beat music was insane. People were splashing to the beat, and that was amazing site to see, so awesome. 

The bottle service was top notch. Great service very friendly. Highly recommend doing the Nightswim Sunday's. Definitely trying to go back before the summer ends, and if don't make it back, you'll see me back here next year.

Vegas marches on and in a few months, Osteria del Circo is closing.

Part of famed restaurateur Sirio Maccioni's empire.  Circo offers Italian inspired food with a few hidden gems of true authenticity.  But first:

RANT:  In whose mind is this an "osteria"?  An osteria, the simplest, most austere type of Italian eatery.  Pastas, grilled or roasted meats, endless glasses of house wine. Good, simple living.  With it's beautifully crafted dishes, whimsical, lake side dining room, 900 selection wine cellar, this is not an osteria.

Searching for the authentic, an excellent fritto misto.  Lightly coated, perfectly cooked, crisp fried calamari zucchini flowers with a vibrant cherry tomato sauce.   The Antipasto del Circo per La Tavola is equally simple and delicious.  A good selection of Italian cheese, cured salumi and fruits.  

For secondi, the most classic of pastas shine.  The Buccatini al Amatriciana near Roman perfect.  Toothsome, fresh pasta enveloped with an acidic sauce of pancetta, tomato, wine and pecorino romano.  Not to be outdone, the Gnocchi al Pesto Gratinati.  Perfect pillows in a warm, herbaceous pesto tossed with Parmigianino.  A velvety rich bite accented by toasted pine nuts for texture.

Finally the Bistecca alla Fiorentina.  Although not from the famed Chianina cow of Tuscany, the 40 day aged porterhouse for two, cooked very rare and dressed simply with olive oil is excellent.  Festive, fun to eat.  Nuff said.  The rack of lamb with a pecorino and thyme crust is equally good.  Very meaty, well trimmed, tender and perfectly cooked throughout.  

Good plate of flavorful biscotti and some vin santo make for a classic dessert.

Very good, friendly and efficient service.  Excellent Italian centric wine list with many reasonably priced bottle from a wide variety of DOCGs.

As we sip our amaro, the words of Anthony Bourdain ring true:  "Into each life a little bitterness".

Farewell Circo.  Ciao grazie.

I've zoomed passed this sign so many times, but never thought to stop. My friend wanted to take some fun photos in front of the sign, and it made for a really fun photo op!

Electric Daisy Carnival is not just a destination, a place, a celebration, a setting, or a music festival. It's a life changing experience, an adventure... a magical wonderland! It was an ethereal, surreal journey. 

This year EDC is my first and I would not change it in any other way because of the memories we created together with friends and the new. So much fun/cool experience! 

There is no way I can describe EDC because you have to be there in order to feel the experience with other 350,000+ people. 

The goods: 
-The largest rave in America stretched out approx. 1.5-2 miles apart with over 350,000+ attendees. Holy. 
-Spectacular decors and stage set ups. I loved the Kinetic Field set up the most! That celestial castle mimicked Little Mermaid's castle of gold or Disney's Sleeping Beauty castle or some form of cathedral structure! Very remarkable and incredible. THE LIGHT INSTALLATIONS ARE PHENOMENAL! Now I can understand why Insomniac spent over $35 million dollars+ toward the productions. 
-It goes from dusk to sunrise. 
-Free water, but the line can be cruel-some. Stay hydrated please!
-65+ carnival rides are fun to ride with your friends and make good memories. 
-The artists! Hardwell, Tiesto, Calvin Harris, Dash, Avicii, Kaskade, Carnage, Alesso, and all of the biggest EDM DJs you know. 
-You'll meet some of the friendliest people on the planet. I got to PLUR with some of amazing new friends! 
-THE FIREWORKS. 

-The bads: 
-Beer is overpriced.. $8 for a can of Budlight? 
-No cell signal, so don't rely on catching receptions. Bring some walkie talkies.
-Parking. It's the worst when trying to get out of Speedway. 
-Traffic. It takes minimum of 45 minutes to 4 hours to get to the carnival from the Strip. 
-Running out of toilet papers in the rest rooms, so bring some for yourself. 

All in all, I had the best experience with friends I will forever cherish! This is something everyone in their 20s should experience once in their lifetime.

Thank you Pasquale Rotella, CEO and Founder of Insomniac Productions, for making this happen every year. It was literally the BEST WEEKEND OF MY LIFE surrounded with good and positive vibes. Rolling bowling balls. Awesome kandis. Oh my gawd, awesome DJs. PLUR. Sleep is for the weak. #insomiac. EAT SLEEP RAVE REPEAT!

See you next year under the electric sky!

If this place wasn't 10miles from my house I would frequent it all the time!! I went on the road trip here seeking Pomegranate Molasses...yes it is a thing.  They had 4 kinds to choose from!  Mind you I had been to Fry's Marketplace, Whole Foods and Trader Joes trying to find the stuff!  As a side note the Trader Joes 'guy' told me to come here after doing a bit of googling!  FYI Pomegranate Molasses is $27 on Walmart's website!!! At Baiz they have four kinds ranging from $2.49-3.99!  So they are extremely reasonable.  The vegetables section is very fresh with a great variety of vegetation.  If you are making anything from scratch Baiz has amazing ingredients and obscure items to make exotic dishes!  The customer service was very friendly; there were only two cashiers open and decent lines.  But really no big deal, I was tantalized by the yummy looking foreign chocolate bars surrounding the register, but somehow managed to resist!  

Just being in Baiz Market inspires me to want to cook more!!  I will be back.

I initially had my closets designed by another company and they did a nice job but I soon realized that what they had designed for me was not functional for my needs. There were way too many shelves and not enough hanging space. I had hired a professional organizer and she was in the process of helping me put my closet back together. Once she had evaluated what needed to go where, she suggested getting rid of most of the shelves and instead adding several pull down hanging racks, a few extra hanging bars as well as some pull out belt racks. She contacted California Closets for help. She was only in town for a short time and expressed her interest in having someone come out right away so she could finish this project the way it should be done. Fortunately enough, California Closets was able to accommodate me and sent someone out to my house the very next day. My new closet is finally perfect. I was so impressed with them and the fact that they saved the day that I'm going to hire them to organize my guestroom closet once I'm ready. Thanks again for everything California Closets! :)

Hubby and I got suckered into a presentation for thei Westgate Vacation Club while on vacation in Las Vegas last week.  We got free dinner and a show for our 2hours of time.  

All in all the presentation was good, the condo units seem pretty nice, and the idea is a great one for people who want to travel more.  

However we do not make any snap decisions and told the sales people that, well you would have thought the world was ending....all of a sudden the higher up sales person accuses us of not being truthful with them, of not making sense since we want to go on more vacations and wanting to spend more time with family....why would we not want to buy into their vacation club....we had to suffer through 2 other sales people and say NO like 10 times before they would let us leave.   

It was more stressful that it should have been....and after being treated that way will never buy anything from Westgate Resorts...  You just don't treat people like that.

Love the SLS.  Period.  Wonderful service, wonderful restaurants, and wonderful pool.  It's a boutique, not a monstrosity.  Just what I want from a Vegas hotel.  What doesn't it have?  A great casino, and a little far down the strip so you are forced to drive, taxi, or monorail out.

#1 - Get here while it's affordable.  Whether you use Travelocity.com (like I did), hotels.com, or book direct -- there is amazing deals to be had right now.  On average, $139/night.  Again, amazing.

#2 - Restaurants.  Whether you dine at Cleo, Bazaar Meat, Katsuya, or casual dining spots like the SLS Buffet, Griddle Caf, 800 Degrees, Umami -- all are beyond great experiences.  Less so: Perq the coffee spot (it's okay), and Ku Noodle (very casual, has shu mai but not potstickers).

#3 - Service.  Wonderful and friendly, it was warm and extra nice for the moment I arrived.  Kudos.

#4 - Pool.  Cabanas are pricey, so I was able to get a soft and cushiony bed just inside the pool.  Cool music with outstanding looking pool hostesses and bartenders created a relaxing vibe that was also titillating.

#5 - Rooms.  The hallways are definitely hip near gothic, and the rooms were elegant and modern.  Lots of mirrors.  Ooh la la.

Overall, I loved my 3 night stay.

Came in here for a 3 night stay since my client used my product on this remodel of what use to be the Sahara casino and hotel. I enjoyed the convenience of either valet parking at two different valet stations or self parking which had easy access to the rooms unlike the competition on the strip.  Checking in was effortless possibly BC it was a Monday afternoon.

My room was located on the 19 floor, modern & Chic and the usage of border lit mirrors opened the room up. The bed was comfy and the bathroom contained  a shower that was glass enclosed with a high pressure rain forrest shower head. The room also had a safe for valuables and a fully stocked bar & snacks.

I was able to experience dinning at two of the many eateries -once at the Unami Sports Bar & Beer Garden and several times for bfast at the Griddle Cafe. All of the three times were solid and convenient.  The hotel spa contains an adequate fitness center and is open 24 hours to work off all those excess calories you're bound to indulge in. The casino is on the smaller side, but I actually found it enjoyable since it is quaint and less congested. 

I was here to visit clients and usually avoid staying away from the strip but my stay at the SLS proved just the opposite and I would definitely return again in the future.

This is the most welcoming and diverse religious group I've found in Las Vegas.  I use the term "religious" loosely because many, including myself would argue that Buddhism is more of a philosophy for life and well being.  Much of Buddhism does not fall under the general "religion" rules.  No prosthelytizing, no supernatural beliefs or dogma and no belief in a "heaven and hell" or all-knowing higher power.

The SGI-USA Buddhist Center focuses on a particular brand of Buddhism known as Soka-Gakkai, which is the most established and followed form of Buddhism in the United States.  I was told that the President of the global organization donated some of his personal money to cover much of the costs of construction because he felt the Las Vegas area was a crucial place to have a presence.

I went to the community center a few months back to check it all out.  Luckily I got to see one of the monthly valley-wide meetings that everyone attends.  You're likely to hear a lot of chanting, perhaps a video from an SGI presidential address in Japan, and lots of people talking about how Buddhism has improved their lives.  What struck me most is the diversity.  You'll find people from all ages, races, and walks of life.  No formal dress code.  Just come as you are.

There are plenty of volunteers who are there to explain SGI Buddhism  to newcomers.  Much of the day-to-day and weekly experiences involve attending smaller meetings with people in your neighborhood, often hosted at a member's home.  I haven't been back much since I'm still exploring other forms of Buddhism.  But those who are interested will find this as an excellent starting point.

Everything about this place is out of the norm in a very good and inviting way. Major points on the curb appeal from rock wall to innovative use of nostalgic wooden letter blocks as signage. The attention to detail is refreshing and appreciated.  The interior is welcoming and the creative use of space is impressive. How does one fit a lounge, bar and dinning area in such a tight space and mitigate claustrophobia? This is worthy of an HGTV episode.  Tuck has done it & done it well!
 
The menu is just as creative and unique in its own right. I've enjoyed the roasted grape crostini, chorizo stiffed dates, mac & cheese w/lobstah, special meatloaf with potatoes & chorizo and the chocolate cheese cake. All hit high marks for flavor, portion and presentation. The service is consistently impeccable from courteous host to attentive but non-intrusive servers. I always feel welcomed and appreciated!  

Tuck Shop is in my top five places I love and enjoy introducing to friends, co-workers, and out of town guests. It holds a very warm place in my heart with many fun and special memories.

[DISCLAIMER: the rating of five stars for Bandaids does not directly correlate with the intentions of the establishment, instead, the volumes of unintentional comedy and unsolicited astonishment that may be had at this specific joint]

Walking into Bandaids was like witnessing the sneak premier of the cinematic masterpiece 'Showgirls' -- and what I mean is, one is piqued with curiosity, wonderment, the promise of mindblowing mockery, and the anticipation of an inevitable Spidey exit.  This is where the comparison to showgirls ends.  Actually, I don't rememer.  Did showgirls feature a stripper in her 3rd trimester?

Whereas the tagline for Showgirls was "Leave your inhibitions at the door", Bandaids follows up with "... and your guns, knives, nerve gases, babies, peg legs, raptor jesuses, gold crown deodorizers, and herpes."  Although I think most in there ignored that last one.

So, upon entrance, you are greeted with a very Judge Dredd-like chain-link protected cashier who takes your Abe Lincoln and motions you over to the bar.  One thing about strip clubs in general, is, you don't really wanna schooch by anyone ... but at Bandaids, they make this awkward dream a reality for everyone!  The walk up to the bar is like cutting to seats 34 and 35 at Giants Stadium.  I felt like Tyler Durden contemplating whether to give the vatos the butt or the crotch as they stare blankly at "the talent".

Whoa boy.  This place has talent like the old Washington Bullets ... but shorter, fatter, and more pregnant.

I gave one of my buddies a dollar to snap into one of the monster's string and she gave him a "whusssuuup" that featured her sweet gold grill.  To appreciate this, you must know that my friend is quite possibly the sweetest guy on the planet, and gave a friendly "Hi!" to her in return before about-facing to our bistro style table where 8 Coors Lights were posting up our jaws.

This was a nice, natural cue for a quick exit, rattled our half-drained beers into the bins and shot out.  We couldn't stomach anymore of anything.

But wait.

On this page you will notice Jason C., and along with the others in our laughter-induced group, came his big mouth.  This was his opportunity to mock the sawed-off, convertible, primer-gray Chevy Blazer parked mere feet from the entrance/exit to Bandaids, and although the details are lost as to the specifics, mentioned something about "check out THIS fucking thing!", which was the perfect timing for one of the busted, ghetto-flab strippers to walk out and proceed to angrily say something like "Fuck you.  That's mine.  What of it?"  In response, and generally because he's a giant puss with scary strippers, said something like, "Oh.  Its nice.  I like it." before shitting himself.

I'm sure the rest of the group howling with laughter really set her mind at peace.  

Anyway.  That's the Bandaids story, and you can have one just like it if you give it a chance.

I was number E-31

I arrived at 1:45 or so to get a replacement card.  It's been a while. Almost thirty years since I lost my original one. LOL  Since everyone is so security conscious these days, I thought I should get a replacement.  Just in case someone would want to steal it.  I never had a reason to before, still don't. One of the side benefits of working for the same company for so long.

I arrived and was asked by the armed security guard if I had any pointy objects, knives, guns or a cellphone. I said no, no, no and yes. I was told to mute the cellphone. LOL  I said thank you, hit the touch screen for my number and proceed out the door to Del Taco for lunch.  

I came back an hour later and they were at E-94. Fearing I had missed my number, I went up to an open window and I was told no. Forty five minutes later they did call my number. I handed her my pre-printed and filled out form. She asked for my Drivers License, and a few questions. I had to swear that all the information I gave her was the truth under penalty of incarceration. 

She was very pleasant. I wished her a nice day!

Step into The Parlor said the hostess to the guy...and while I wouldn't say we stepped in (it was more of a skip)...we did find ourselves immediately pleased with the decor. Herb garden lining the sidewalk, bar windows wide open, fireplace straight ahead and an interior that may rattle my heavenly friend, St. Francis. Get it? Heavenly? Saint? 

Um...well...anyhoo...the few times I've been there was always that awkward post lunch-pre dinner time (around 2ish)...we were always greeted and seated immediately. That can be an easy time to be forgotten in a restaurant.

I had dreams about the Pesto Pasta after my first visit. It was weird. Pesto Pasta and I were on a cruise where Chaz Bono was performing Send In The Clowns. She kept throwing chunks of Parmesan at us from the stage calling us Parlor Gays. Then a huge unicorn came from above and ate her. 

I don't know what that means. But that has to be one full unicorn. 

Spinach salad and calamari are big weiners here...wait, I mean, winners here. Winners. Love the tropical ice tea. Service was a solid B+. LOVE the 2 price options on the pasta dishes. I try to eat my cheat foods in fist size portions. Ok. No fist jokes from the randy gays. Please. 

Welcome to the neighborhood said The Culinary Comedian to The Parlor.

WHERE: Located on Durango, between Dessert Inn & Sahara. (It's in the same vicinity as the Storage place)

WHEN: They are conveniently open Monday through Sunday =D.

WHY: To get your eyebrows did, and all that unnecessary hair you don't want and need... haha

WHAT:  Sooo... I was reading about local eyebrow threading places on yelp, and this one popped up during my research.  The reviews I did read were all really positive, and luckily when I pulled up my groupon app, there they were! So what does repetitive exposure/advertising do to me?! Correct, I get suckered in to trying it! =D. 

The first time I stepped foot into the shop, I was nicely greeted.  I have been coming here to get my eyebrows done for several months now, and I keep coming back.  This is a family-owned business & family is what I feel like when I am here. =) I now bring my family along with me every month. My mom and aunts love it, and are always excited for our eyebrow-threading field trip.

The woman who does my eyebrows ($10 to thread by the way) is such a sweetheart! It's like going to a nail shop and talking about everything and more with your nail lady. Instead, it's with my eyebrow lady! =D, she's my favorite! She is extremely patient, informative, and has become like family to me!

Don't get me wrong, they not only thread eyebrows, but the entire face! I believe they do waxing as well. And! They do eyelash clusters for a great price (I haven't personally tried it yet, but I will soon!)

I leave you with this...
If you are looking for a waxing/threading spot, come in and try it out! You will not be disappointed! =D

"Oh come on.  When I said I wanted soup, I thought you'd pick ramen.  Tripe, tendons, beef knee bone, tongue, oxtail.  Seriously?" whines my Midwest poker bud.

"Be adventurous"  I say, choking back giggles.

"Adventurous?  It's not fair.  The worst my people got is Rocky Mountain Oysters, and you like those."

E-Jo is all about authentic Korean beef bone soup.  Heavily extracted, boiled for hours until gelatinous and milky.  Incredible beef flavor with garlicky undertones.

Simply select from a flavorful list of brisket (well braised, stringy), tongue (braised and tender), knee (clean, gelatinous tendons), oxtail (fall off the bone with melting cartilage), tripe (well cleaned, no off smell, tender), or all of the above then adjust the seasoning with the provided salt, fermented chili paste, chili powder and scallions.  Done.

Only three banchan.  In-house made, incredible Napa cabbage and radish kim chee.  Deep flavor, good heat and just the right tingle of fermentation on the tongue.  A plate of fresh shishito peppers adds a vibrant, mild spice, green pepper foil made even better when dipped in a light but flavor enhancing soy garlic sauce.

There are a few other non soup items (spicy pork, chicken, etc).  Have not tried them.  

Prices for the soups are very reasonable ranging between $10 - $15.

A short list of shoju and Korean beer rounds out the meal.

Mom and pop Asian service.

An incredible bowl of deliciousness.  Oh yeah, "Mikey liked it".

So I got asked if I wanted to see the O show or the Fantasy Show. I could tell from their faces that they wanted to see topless girls so I agreed to go to the Fantasy Show because I'm not a prude. 

You know what? I really did enjoy this show. It was tastefully done and not trashy as I thought it would be. These girls were so beautiful and so mesmerizing throughout their performance. I'm not a lesbian but this show has made me become bi-curious? Okay, not really but I have to admit they were sweet eye candy.

The host/singer has an amazing voice and she kept everyone entertained. She had some of the audience participate in singing, which was awesome because some of them sounded like a dying cow. Lol.

I didn't get to see Sean E. Cooper but they had Lisa Sundstedt (from Chelsea Lately and appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno) take his place. She was so friggin' hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing at her jokes. :)

Some of the guys in the audience act like they've never seen naked chicks in their lives. When they see topless girls...they start going crazy by hooting, hollering, and making disgusting comments. Seriously, those perverts need to go to a strip club instead of coming to this show because they're ruining it for the people who sit next/close to them.

Anyways, you guys should definitely go to this show if you're not embarrassed or ashamed of seeing half naked girls. Ladies, you should be a good sport and bring your guys here for some entertainment. ;)

I was scheduled to fly to Las Vegas on January 5, 2014, however, my Newark Delta flight via Detroit was cancelled due to the weather. The earliest flight I could get to Vegas was two days later from JFK on January 7. My original hotel stay was at the Planet Hollywood, but, because my arrival was delayed I had to find an alternative hotel.

I found the Quad, which was the former Imperial Palace on the strip. I never stayed here but, as a Total Rewards member their last minute room pricing was the most reasonable so I reserved a room. Big mistake.

When I arrived I found the taxi had to drop me off at the rear of the hotel due to the hotel construction still going on. I noticed a lot of young people checking into the Quad I guess due to the low room cost. My check-in was smooth. As you can see from my room pics, my room was ok, which was fine. 

My only complaint about this hotel is the construction going on in and around the hotel. Some areas of the hotel are still well worn. The hotel location is fine between Harrah's and across the street from Ceasar's Palace.

See the pics of my TR1724 room, which I paid $136 for the first night and $169 for the second night in early January 2014.

I would probably not return here. I much prefer Planet Hollywood or any of the other strip hotels, which do cost a little more.

Yodel -Le - He-Ho!!!   Been dying for some food to remind you of the French Alps? Yes? Well I have got a beautiful place for you to try ... a bit of  yumminess right here on Bell rd... Crepes, Tartines and Fondue ..what more could you ask for ? How about an ice cave ? Yes just when you thought that you'd never see an ice cave for comedians and what not ..there it is...  Seriously... right on the Bar side of the restaurant... Okay new place to try kids and it is really tasty. Husband and  I had the Scallop/Mediterre  Savory Crepe which was lovely  and the Jamon Frankekuchen --which translates loosely   "tasty ham / pear pizza with crescent roll crust  " super delicious ... now the shocker was the over hazelnutation of the  sweet  crepe...   wholly  nutella folks  ...too much ... but yet we ate it all. 
The interior begs for you to take this place seriously as a french
 /swiss alps restaurant  and to be honest it does remind me of a bistro we ate in Lucerne, Switzerland... , there  really is a fake ice cave ala the matterhorn area of Disneyland ,which the owner plans on using as a stage for comedians ..I am laughing already. 
There also is a crepe cam  which shows the making of the crepes in the kitchen  and is televised to the bar  area..ah.. neat.   

Call me and lets go get a crepe together!!

I have eaten here a few times now and am surprised at how much I like it. I'm not a burger person, so I can't comment on that. The last two times I have ordered the "BLT" priced at $1.49 and can't believe how good it is for a fast food place. They aren't shy on the bacon and it tastes good. I also had a small order of their "Famous Seasoned Fries" priced at $1.69 and found them to be a bit crunchy and overcooked. Priced at 2 for a $1 the "Cinnamon Apple Pie" I had for dessert was a nice finishing touch. The employees here are friendly and they have a dual drive-thru. Even though the fries could use some work, fans of Checkers and Rally's shouldn't be disappointed with the cheap prices and food put out here.

I had an "herb box" in college I remember. Kept it under my bed. Or in the back of the closet. Or in a shoe. Gee, that was some herb I can't even remember...

This Herb Box however, I shan't ever forget!!!

Butternut Squash Enchiladas. White Bean Chicken Chili. Crab Cilantro Dip. The Zucchini soup of the day...ALL...outstanding!!!

Now that I've moved back to DC Ranch I'm so glad to see the Herb Box and even more excited that this is my new "Cheers". Sorry Gallo Blanco, though I miss you madly...I've found another relationship. And no it's not complicated!

Quite simple in fact. Delicious, fresh ingredients. Delightful, warm staff and a cozy and bright spot on Market Street.

I've been here with family. With friends. And even a date. Herb Box, if I stick around AZ long enough, I just may ask you to marry me!

So step outside of your "box" and head to The Herb Box. But call me first and I will meet you there!!!

Thbbbbb. Thumbs down. It's places like this that give Scottsdale a bad name.  I must divulge that I'm not basing this rating on an actual review of the club, because they never let me and my friend in. The door man readily let all of our female friends in, and stopped us. The men in my group were a minority, two men with six ladies. The ladies in the front of our group entered with their momentum, and the last two stayed with us. A steady stream of flesh baring ladies entered one after the other beside us. We explained that we were with a group (admittedly, trying to work the fact that we were with women to our advantage) and the velvet rope boy demeaningly stated that "every guy out here is with 'lots of women.'" I never want to use my girlfriends as currency!

We went next door, all of our girlfriends left Narcisse and joined us, and I'll never go back!

Ugh! Totally gross. I just moved to town and this place appears to epitomise all of the materialistic things about which I'd been forewarned regarding Snottsdale.

What do you expect with a bar called "Narcisse"?

I'll add: in the 1/2 hr or so my girlfriends were in the bar, two of them were groped by "manthers", referred to in Connie's post below.

Have fun!

Incidentally, being new to town, I am looking for pubs/clubs in greater Scottsdale and Phoenix where humans can go, with their friends. Suggestions?

Henry, oh Henry. 

Long line at the popular Pizzeria at the Cosmopolitan hotel?
My friends decided to split up to order food at a couple places. Do you like how we multitask in getting crazy amounts of food?

2 bitter champagne cocktails + 1 spinach artichoke dip = $50+

Service was non-existent, yet rushed. The waitress kept asking if we were done with the menus when we did not even give her the order.

My friend had a to-go box from another restaurant, and they threw it away. When we asked about it, they defensively replied, "IT'S NOT OUR FAULT."

1 extra star because they open late and they let us eat our outside food (cosmo pizza) inside the restaurant.

Medicore for breakfast. The buffet was pretty pathetic looking, especially considering this is Vegas, land of the endless buffets with all you can eat lobster and pancakes (yes together and yes it's weird). I've seen better breakfast buffets in LA. 

We decided to just order. My fiance ordered an omelette and I ordered cereal. It took forever to get our food and when it arrived it wasn't anything special. Almost everything on the breakfast menu seemed heavy. The only reason we ate here was because we had the breakfast credit from American Express, but honestly, next time I'd rather pay for breakfast and go somewhere decent.

I've seen a few Michael Jackson tribute shows and have been mildly entertained by them and in some cases left my head shaking.  Michael Jackson ONE blows them all away!  After a few mediocre shows on the Strip (BeLIEve, Viva Elvis, Zarkana), this is Cirque du Soliel's comeback to brilliance.

Whether or not you're a fan of Michael Jackson, I'm pretty sure you'll be thoroughly entertained.  It's not like a pure Cirque du Soleil production like KA, Mystere, or O, but it's more in the realm of a tribute show like LOVE was for the Beatles, where the focus is mainly on the music, choreography, and vision inspired my Michael Jackson.

A few highlights of note:

- Make sure you make it to your seat before curtain call so you can get to see some of the pre-show activities.

-The music has been totally remastered in which the instrumentation sounds brand new and follows the dance routines very well.  Like the LOVE theater, the seats have front and rear speakers to totally immerse you into the show.

- The choreography is very well done!  You actually start cheering on the dancers when you see many of MJ's signature moves and routines.

- The stage is pretty awesome with wall-to-wall projections along with some 3D holograms. --  http://bit.ly/1oXQifY

I can go on and on about ONE, but I'd be giving away too much.  Right now, this IS my favorite Vegas CdS show.  It blew my mind!  And it also got me a little misty-eyed simply because this is probably the closest thing I'll ever get to a Michael Jackson live performance.  And like what other Vegas shows like Beatles LOVE and Elton John's Red Piano, it rekindled my interest in Michael Jackson's music and had me listening to his songs weeks later!  I would definitely see ONE again for sure!

I had no idea WTF paddle boarding was, but my boyfriend invited me... and my life philosophy is to say "yes" to everything. 

I was kinda hesitant because I am EXTREMELY uncoordinated and un-athletic. I was always the last picked for volleyball and all that in school, so I was kind of afraid to make an ass of myself in front of my jock b.f. But I sacked up and tried it anyway....and surprise!! It's super easy!!

Basically, it's a giant surfboard you stand on, and paddle around with a long oar, like a canoe. It's shockingly easy to keep your balance, and not too hardcore a workout. I paddled pretty much around the entire lake, and wasn't even sore the next day.

The Lake itself is just the right size to paddle around...about a mile and half long from end to end. You can paddle right up to the docks of the pretentious asses who live out there (bonjour, Celine), or cruise past golf courses and a fake Italian village. At the other end, the landscape is pretty much just barren desert...which is much cooler, in its way.

As far as the actual paddleboarding business, the staff was super cool and gave me a quick beginner lesson before sending me on my way. It's something like $30 for an hour, but you also get access to the Westin pool (super nice) and 20% off your food and bev purchases there. So not a bad deal!

On a final note, I was especially careful not to fall overboard while paddling, since the water in fake-ass Lake Las Vegas is treated wastewater from Vegas. YUCK! The last thing I want to do is flounder around in Vegas's leftover piss and amniotic fluid...no matter HOW much they claim to treat it!!

Craft cocktails at the Linq!

Blvd. Cocktail Company is the latest pre-prohibition style offering from the folks behind Commonwealth, Park on Fremont, etc..  Blvd is at home in its touristy Linq setting and is probably the best option in this Linq area for quality, craft cocktails.  The bar is tended by a combination of stellar mixologists and adequate bartenders...be sure to order from the stellar mixologists (choose wisely, one of the best in town is here) if you are going off-menu in the craft direction though.

A hipster design firm vomited all over this space and as a result, the setting is hip and trendy with POF wallpaper and paintings, while a giant light bulb chandelier dominates the center of the room.  Live music is cranked out of far too many speakers at an exceedingly high volume entirely mitigating your ability to enjoy conversation...but the music does seems to be on point as far as quality goes.  There was a fantastic artist playing the Saturday night we came down and I heard great things about the previous weekend as well.

It is a challenge for me to rate Blvd.  I would give out 3 stars for the tourist trap setting of the Linq.  It would be 2 if based on the volume of music....Maybe as high as 4 stars if judging simply on  the interior and theme of the bar.  But an easy 5 stars for the drinks from Juyoung.  You can do the math, that's a 3.5 Star average...it could go either way, but I'm going with a weak 4 Stars.

I had no idea what to expect as I pulled up to the Gangplank office just before noon today... 

Perhaps a bunch of techy computer nerds that didn't speak my language?  That was my fear.

But I was pleasantly surprised - everyone was warm and welcoming and although they may speak in a crazy tech language to each other, I was able to communicate amongst the group just fine. 

As the other reviews state that came before this one, Gangplank is an open workspace that anyone is welcome to pop in on... they have weekly events and presentations, such as the brown bag lunch that I presented at today.  I have a feeling if Gangplank were not located all the way in Chandler, I'd be a regular - but I do plan on making the drive again soon for sure.

The people that work from Gangplank seem like the 'people to know' if you are looking for an awesome local techy community that is creative, smart, and fun. Check it out for yourself... maybe i'll see you there!

LOVE this place! With the gimmick of "wine on tap" your going to have a hard time finding a better casual wine bar in town. I cant get away from the Gernache Blend. Its a California Red, and wow is it amazing. It reminds me of a soft cab, but with a heavy finish. Ive tried the Riesling, pinot grigio, and one other red, im blanking on the name, and all of these wine choices were great. My boyfriend tried a few beers and loved them as well. 
The manager Kat is a doll. she provided us with great service. They dont have any gluten free options on their menu but if you ask the cook nicely he will make you a sandwich in a lettuce wrap instead. I had the turkey and brie, wow that was yummy. 
Its a very small space but they make do with what they have. This was by far the best service and wine selection in the Container Park.

So much potential for this place. They have been only open for a few months so obviously there needs to be room for tweaking. But, it is what it is and I have to give an honest opinion. 

The owners get their ice cream from Treat Ice cream company in San Jose. Treat has a ridiculous yelp rating over there. That means it should be 5 stars as well.. Not exactly.

Taste wise, only a couple flavors really put me away, the tin roof sundae and the taro. I forgot what was in the TRS, but there were a whole lot of goodies that went extremely well together. Let's talk about the taro, or as I like to call it, them taro ice cream... Probably the best taro ice cream I ever had! It was well balanced, smooth, and the taro flavor was very pronounced.

So what up wit da 3 stars u say?? Well, most of the ice creams that are served there are extremely icy! You can actually hear the crunch if you chew it. Not only does that distract from the flavor, but it is very unpleasant as well. I checked the reviews for Treat Ice Cream and they don't seem to have this problem. I don't know if this is due to the transportation of the ice cream or from the storage. But, all the flavors are really well balanced.. The texture is off.

The employees are nice and the store is well maintained. I would come back here just for the taro.

Located on the third floor by the pool table in the Cosmo, you'll find a long dark hallway flanked with vintage record covers leading to a small pizza joint serving freshly baked pizza pies. It's really no secret that the secret pizza puts out some of the best late night eats this side of the strip! But most importantly, if you're staying at the Cosmo, there's no need to trek out in inclement weather or battle the strip crowd for good grub either.  

Thankfully, on the late night I stumbled in, the line wasn't too obnoxiously long. Be warned, on certain nights when the Marquee or Chelsea has an event, you could be waiting for quite awhile for your slice, so plan accordingly! 

Overall, the pizzas are very tasty. Thinly sliced NYC style (for you to fold and eat)
with a variety of topping options. My personal favorites are the works and white pizzas. They've got loads of condiments like oregano, granulated garlic, cheese, chili flakes etc for you to customize your pies, well. 

Happy Eats!

Next time, light some candles and play Marvin Gaye before you screw me.

I've been here before, but for some reason I decided to give it another chance.  Kind of like that ex-boyfriend who dumps you but then happens to call you out of the blue when his friends are visiting (he wants to show them he's dating someone really cool) and tells you to wear heels and a short dress and then introduces you as his trophy GIRLFRIEND but dumps you AGAIN when his friends fly back home and you end up feeling even WORSE than when he dumped you the FIRST time.  

Phew, you catch that?!

Anyhoo... this is the second time that the hostess wouldn't seat us outside when all of the tables were available.  Pretentious waitstaff, rubbery pizza, wilted salad, tasty bread (but they'll only bring you one piece, so grab a big one from the basket), prices in line with the area but NOT justified by the lack of quality fare.

I should have learned my lesson the first time.  

--end rant--

The espresso bean gelato was delicious.

Today was my first time here.  Yes, I know, I am a Big AL(big-ass loser.  You'd know this if you've ever taught middle/high school).  Anyway, I was meeting up with Tony, aka Lightrailblog for a late lunch.  I knew I wanted the elote.  I've been hearing everyone scream about the damn elote for months.  I started out with an iced tea (I am an iced tea FREAK!) that was flavored - I think mango.  Then I got an Arnold Palmer.  This was the BEST AP I've EVER had!  (Sorry, FEZ!)  It was made with freshly-squeezed lemonade and was plenty tart.  I also had huevos ranchers.  I like that they asked how I wanted my eggs cooked.  I HATE fully-cooked yolks.  Unless it's a hard-boiled egg, then it kinda has to be that way.  Came with a side of refried beans.  The salsa on top was awesome and not store-bought.  
Server, Steven ("Esteban") was awesome...as soon as he figured out that everything I said was a joke. I mean, come on, am I *really* gonna put my ice cubes on your nipples?  Well, not in public, and not until you buy me dinner.  HA!
Downfall:  THE FLIES!!!!  There were at least 4 flying around our table.  *shudder*

Yet another really good burger option for the Chandler/101 area!

Over the last few months we've gotten a Smash Burger and now a Burger21 last week. If UR into red meat, how can you go wrong?

I came here to grab something for a late night at the office and Burger21 hit the roof of my flavortown mouth. Sorry Fieri!  LOL

I kept it simple. The cardiac arrest Blue Cheese and Bacon burger for only $7.95 and a Chocolate Malt ($4.95) to wash it down. Both were good. 

Expect to pay $12 or so, if you order a soft drink. Don't  those iced cold beers looked good? There's a real high probably I'll be back with some co-workers real soon.

I've been awaiting a great eatery to replace the now defunct Chandler BBQ Company, and the wait was worth it.

I've had both the meat tortellini with bolognese and the marscapone with butternut squash ravioli, both made from scratch, both delightful.  I have huge expectations for their artichoke parmesan.  The restaurant does have a Facebook page when you can come and get a little extra info.  It's quaint and cute on the inside (seats 16) and they have a nice sized outdoor patio with ample seating, for al fresco dining.

The chef, Carlo, is friendly and excited for you to try his creations.  They have a chalkboard menu behind the counter, where you'll place your order, and a deli case with meats, cheeses and olives... soon to include desserts.

They offer hot and cold sandwiches, salads, pasta (with your choice of six sauces), and a few side dishes.  The beverage options include a fountain station.

Stop by for lunch or dinner.  Stay for the ambiance or get it to-go!

Cirque du Soleil performances are already a bit more sexy than the average show, but Zumanity takes it to a whole new level. If you'll notice, most of the 1- and 2-star reviews are from people who called it "raunchy" or "gross" - umm, prudes! Do you research before you go to any show. If they already require spectators to be at least 18-year-old due to "mature content," you bet your ass you're gonna see T&A - and maybe even more. 

You still see the amazing Cirque du Soleil high flying tricks, acrobatic stunts, dancing, singing, and prop sherades - but with super-sexy costumes and adult humor. Would I see this show with my parents? Uh, hell no. But our group of gals enjoyed the show.

As for the venue, there really isn't a bad seat in the house. EXCEPT - if you choose the balcony, DO NOT get the first row of seats on the balcony. You might think you're getting a great view, but the balcony bar will be in your way - whether you're tall or small - so pick the row just behind it. And unfortch, the ticket box office doesn't warn about this obstructed view. Secondly, floor seating and love seating does involve audience participation, so if you easily shy away from the spotlight, sit on the balcony. Oh, and go early for the pre-show. Kinda sets the tone for the night.

Another swingers club. Oy vey! After escaping the skanky and famous Green Door, I did NOT want to go next door to this place next to the gay bar, it looked like another weird unsanitary adult entertainment place, but my adventurous friend was like, oh come on, let's look!

The owner personally gave us a tour. Skanky exterior, gorgeous interior. I don't know how the hell they hose that baby down after a night of orgylicious whatnot, but it's all here, flat screen TVs, handcarved wood furniture, rugs, curtains, nice!

The spa is super clean and contemporary furnishings with pleeeenty of space for voyeurs to sit around their super clean looking jacuzzi. The bathrooms and lockers appeared clean too.

It was pretty dead the night we went, but it was before their soft opening, very very new club, can't wait until it becomes a scene. I was informed that this is a very safe club, no one can touch you or they get booted, no booze allowed, but they sell soft drinks and coffee. I still wouldn't make out at a swingers club, not my style, but I wish them luck and I'll be back to visit and gawk like the nerd I am.

I finally understand what it means to be a crack addict and why it's so hard to quit - withdrawal is a bee-yoootch, and that's exactly how I've been feeling the last few weeks as I went without any SnowFlake (ne Frost Bites) fix. 

The menu stays pretty faithful to what Mike and Will were previously offering out of their original truck in Hendertucky in a self-guided, 4-step ordering process, though it looks like now that they're in a permanent venue they're offering more toppings.

1. Choose a size,
2. Choose a flavor,
3. Add a topping (+$0.50),
4. Add a sauce (free for the first, +0.25 each afterwards), and VOILA! 

As I opened the doors and prayed to Jesus thanking Him for bringing this place out of the wilderness to join the rest of us in society, I made a beeline for the counter to try their limited edition cantaloupe flavor. Friends, I don't even LIKE cantaloupe, but that's how much of a SnowFlake fan I am - I still had to try it for myself. Ultimately though, the natural ingredients used to produce the flavor were so authentic that I still opted for my go-to black sesame with condensed milk, this time topped with egg pudding. 

What can I say, old habits die hard.

After a car accident in Utah just over a week ago I was in need of a car rental while my car was getting repaired. This location is near my house which is why I chose it. I reserved the car online for pick up. They open at 8:00 am Mon-Fri and 9:00 am Saturday so I recommend scheduling your pick up for that time if you can because they have very few cars on site. Luckily I was first to be helped so I got my rental but others had to wait until more vehicles could be brought from another location. The woman who helped me was friendly and courteous after I told I wouldn't tolerate her being rude or hurrying me along like she had been. When I made the reservation online it said nothing about what I needed to bring in person. Obviously you need to have your drivers licence but you also need a current utility bill showing the address matches what is on your DL. I don't know how many people usually carry their utility bills in the car because I pay mine online. After finally getting a copy of my power bill to them all was fine. The car ran good and would rent from this place again if I had to.  

*Have your drivers license and a current utility bill with matching addresses on them.
*If you book for longer then 5 days you get a discount.
*I was also told they keep the top 2% of their vehicles with low mileage to sell and anybody can walk in or call for details on cars they currently have for sale.

OMG get the chorizo omelet!!! 
The place is cutely decorated and the service is super friendly, though a little slow. I am a booth girl, so I was happy to see that most of the seating up front was booths. I don't like tables and hate chairs.
When I see biscuits and gravy on a menu, I am already in love. Also, they don't have it on the menu, but try the chorizo gravy on your biscuits. We only knew about it because Joe himself came to our table. In face, he visited a lot of patrons while we were there.
The potatoes weren't anything fancy, but man oh man, that omelet was amazing. I am still thinking about it!

If you want to experience the REAL Vegas, go north on the Strip til you pass the Stratosphere. That's when the REAL fun starts: strip clubs, porn stores, pawn shops and derelicts! Don't be a puss -- check it out!

The jewel of this portion of LV Blvd is Showgirl Video, an adult store with a moderate-to-severe case of the grunge. Bare concrete floors, rack and racks of DVDs with titles like "German Piss-Orgy," dirty magazines and an assortment of dildos, dongs and pocket pussies to enjoy them with.

The walls are lined with ass- and tit-imprints from some of the world's biggest names in porn -- just like at Hollywood's Chinese Theater! Even better, in the back of the store, you can pay $1 to go through a turnstile to a little peepshow area. A marquee shows you who's dancing today -- usually about 4 different girls. Then enter a booth, insert $5, and the shade goes up to reveal who's on duty at that particular moment. It's like a crapshoot -- will it be a scabrous Russian? A meth-addled Floridian?? You never know at Showgirl!!

If the girl really turns your crank, you can pay extra and take her down the hall to the Private Peep area: a series of little booths where she will dance for your eyes only. A menu is posted out front: "Anal $60, Anal w/toy $80," etc. It's a riot!

All in all, a truly unforgettable experience. And, girls -- if you're down on your luck, they'll let ANYONE dance here...even just for a day or two. On my visit, the manager told me about these two co-eds from Colorado on Spring Break, who had lost all their money gambling and needed to earn cash to get home. They wandered into Showgirl with their bikinis, and in three short days they had earned bus fare back to Denver.

This little parable tells me one of two things.. either the bus is a LOT more expensive than I remembered... or there ain't much money in peepshow dancing!!!

Pomo Phoenix is near perfect in every way. 

We came here last weekend before a play at Herberger Theater and it reminded us sooo much of their original on Scottsdale Road. Great ambiance, with the owner hovering around, making sure everyone was having a good time. Nice!

We started off with some bruschetta and plate of Carpaccio. Both were delicious. We shared a Regina Margarita and it just took us back to their old location. Wonderful. 

They say you cannot go back, well this Pomo's is pretty darn close to the original. Four and a half Stars rounded up to Five. Expect to pay $45 for two, including taxes but not gratuities. 

Enjoy!!

Did you know the north central Phoenix community of Sunnyslope includes the first subdivision built in the Phoenix area and has existed since before Arizona was a state?

Originally settled by poor tuberculants who spent their last dime traveling to a drier climate, Sunnyslope was filled with tents and cottages with porches. In 1911, retired architect W.R. Norton (who had already been living in the area for four years) planned a subdivision and named it "Sunnyslope" inspired by his daughter's remark, "What a pretty sunny slope!" after seeing the morning sun on North Mountain.  

By the 1920s, Sunnyslope had grown into a small yet diverse community of prospectors, homesteaders, writers and musicians, among others. Today, the population tops 51,000 and is still very diverse, representing various gifts, ethnicities and socio-economic groups.

Perhaps the most notable quality about Sunnyslope is the community's strong sense of independence, characteristic of its unique sense of place. Residents tried several times to incorporate, finally relenting in 1959 and allowing the community to be annexed by the City of Phoenix. Still, despite being located in the middle of a large metropolitan area, Sunnyslope maintains a unique, small town atmosphere with an active and engaged resident base.

Besides its cool history, other unique elements of Sunnyslope include:
* One of the few places in Phoenix where in-fill development opportunities exist.
* Diverse housing stock and elevation - from living room windows you can see downtown.
* Lots of outdoor amenities: Murphy's Bridle Path, the canal, North Mountain preserve and more than five city parks.
* 9 public art installations.
* Easy access to downtown Phoenix.
* John C. Lincoln Hospital, the community's largest employer, acts as convener for community meetings and events such as a community policing meeting, the Sunnyslope Fall Festival and the Sunnyslope Art Walk.
* Sunnyslope Village Alliance hosts regular meetings with elected officials representing the community. All are open to the public and there is no cost to attend.
* Sunnyslope Historical Society is housed in what was once the People's Pharmacy building. This building's claim to fame is that is was the first drive-thru window west of the Mississippi.
* Authentic Mexican food representing regions including: Oaxaca, Mexico City and Sonora.
* The best patio in Phoenix (Bomberos Caf & Wine Bar). 
* A free neighborhood circulator where you just wave down a shuttle and it will stop (plus there's a transit station for the city bus). Light rail plans to stretch to 19th Ave. & Dunlap which will be a bonus!

While Sunnyslope did experience a period of decline, a result of older housing stock and poorly maintained rental properties, people who have called this place home have remained vigilant in advocating for their neighborhood and care about their neighbors.  Sunnyslope is experiencing a renaissance and is getting more attention for its best qualities; but, truly, if you ask anyone who lives here they'll probably tell you the very best thing about Sunnyslope is the people!

Posting so other yelpers know how this place works and have a good time.

1. Come by car.  Fees are added for the taxi and/or limo drivers who bring guest to the Rhino.

2.  Come with locals.  Nevada residents are free.  No local ID, you pay what they want to charge you. Locals might be able to get you in.

3.  Don't flash a roll.  You will get picked up right away by a hostess.  Better to look first and make your choice.

4.   You don't get to see unless you pay.  $20 is the rate for the dance.  Don't get fooled.  

5.  If you reject a hostess, she gets annoyed quick.  IRRITATING.

6.  VIP back room fee is a minimum of $100.  That's all you should expect to pay.  The girls can charge you whatever they like so keep that in mind.  Negotiate first.  You don't want to get in it with a bouncer.

REMEMBER, THE GIRLS DO NOT DO ANYTHING THAT YOU COULDN'T ALREADY DO TO YOURSELF.

Follow these tips and you will have a good time.  Oh yeah, the girls are HOT!

Voodoo vs Boodoo?  Plenty of both.

The Voodoo -- how you disappointed me!  True, the best part was the amazing 270 degree view on the 51st floor (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/voodoo-rooftop-nightclub-las-vegas-2?select=8KOKKHh-ITOkOUNyTPpuiw#JneCro3pSd90aCsxYVqmDw), but it's also windy and cold.  Second best thing, great music from Lady Gaga to Eddy Grant (still love "Electric Avenue").  Third, no cover.

The Boodoo -- people are able to smoke inside; ratio of guys to gals 5:1; $17 for a red bull and Skyy Vodka -- that's just sad.  On a Thursday night at 930pm - it was ages 50+ and I was the spring chicken in the room (cougar alert), seriously, WTH!  At 1030pm, the gogo dancers began...and 25 (or so) gents stood around and finally had something to drool over (okay, 24 + 1 you might know).  I was dressed up a bit, but clearly, the posted dress code was not enforced...guys, especially were very casual. 

After giving the place a try for 90+ minutes, I don't plan to ever return.  It's a 2-star, but a bonus for the view, the music, the cool bartenders doing tricks like Tom Cruise in Cocktail, and the quite delicious gogo dancers.

I've only been here for lunch but based on some reviews regarding breakfast I may be missing something.

The first time I went in here I was kind of overwhelmed by all the choices. It didn't make it any easier trying to decipher the menu plastered above the grill area, that was kind of awkward. I'm not certain if they have a paper menu.

I struck up a conversation with a regular and he pointed me to the Gyros special. I ordered that and didn't really dig it too much. The next trip I tried the pastrami and was not too impressed. Both meals BTW, were ginormous. Next, I said to myself if this was an IQ Test and you had to choose something from a place that was called the BURGER Factory what should you choose? Burger, dummy. Yes, I tried a burger the next time through and liked it. So I would rate the burgers a 4 and the rest of the stuff a 2 to average out to a 3 star rating for the total body of work.

Also, they take credit cards. So this is not a cash only place.

Well this is typical Circle K Store. It is a bit pricey has a gas station attached and a bunch of parking. However, this Circle K is a bit unusual as it isnt attached to a Union 76 gas station, it has an Arco gas station.

Every other Arco that I have ever seen is attached to an AMPM not a Circle K. SO I found this to be pretty unusual but other than that it is exactly like every other Circle K around.

The inside of the store is pretty clean. They obviously clean the place regularly, dont have any spectacular deals, but all of the stuff that they advertise as sales marks their pricing back to normal. The restroom was fairly clean, compared to California stations for sure. 

The staff was very friendly and there is lots of parking available for folks to just use the circle k instead of getting gas as well. We got some drinks and ice for a football game we were headed off to, so it was pretty kewl to have a decent place to pick up everything that we needed without having to drive around to a bunch of places at a premium.

Definitely a place worth stopping off at, if you cant go to a regular store. It was nothing extraordinary mind you, but definitely nothing worse than what you would expect from a circle k 7eleven or ampm...

That awkward moment when a club is suppose to show off what it has on opening night. I guess it was to bad I was a dude. Arrived late because honestly everything starts at 11pm anyways, to be told, as almost ever other guy in line, the would not be letting anymore males in. This happens at most places in Scottsdale but given the fact it was me and three women I thought I would be fine, but was very mistaken they were told they could go in, but without me, cause that made sense.

None the less, I guess I will not be spending my money here.

Maybe they should call themselves "Spice Dispensary".  

Feeling like all the meat in my fridge was naked, I knew all they needed was some seasonal healing.  I almost laughed as soon as I walked in at the number of spices on the racks.  I told the friendly attendant (owner?) that I wanted some jerk for my chicken.  I tasted the dash she sprinkled in my hand and I was sold.  1.86 oz for $3.91 and it comes in a plastic baggy.  

I was able sample a few others like their four onion dip spice mixed with sour cream and that was better than any bag of onion soup mix I've ever bought at Smith's.  I also liked the Chinese 5 spice and paprika Spanish.

They also have a huge selection of chili/hot spices for those that kind of hate themselves in a loving way.  240 spices to choose from based on the list they provided me when I left.  I saw some rarities (at least for me) like cubeb berries, zhatar (just wtf IS that?) and porcini mushroom powder when regular mushroom powder just won't freakin cut it.

6 stars when they start selling "El Pollo Loco" and "KFC" spice?

Leonardo Da Vinci - Genius.   Me - Not so much.

Clearly, I am not a mastermind like Da Vinci because I actually paid for the Da Vinci - The Genius exhibition at the Venetian Hotel's Imagine Exhibitions Gallery. Olivia and I thought we were getting a deal, but even with a $5 coupon (from those little "welcome suckers...I mean tourists" booklets in all the taxis) the discounted $22 per person simply isn't worth it.

The 20 minutes it takes to walk through the display slowly while reading each description means you are paying more than a $1 a minute. So, what exciting DaVinci artifacts do you see for that rate? None. Like most things in Vegas, the exhibits are just replicas or small versions of the real thing.

The exhibition has two narrow rooms with the first detailing the timeline of historical events during Da Vinci's life and then exhibiting modern replicas based on some of his drawings. Many of the exhibits are hands on, so, be ready to touch and play. Da Vinci was a true genius and this portion makes it very clear.

The second room has a large wall projection of the Mona Lisa and a list of secret facts uncovered during an HD image capture of the famous artwork a few years ago. Is it cool to see sections of the Mona Lisa highlighted and oddities pointed out? Sure. Is it nice to see what the painting probably looked like before age faded her beauty? Sure. Is it worth $27 (or just $22)? No, it isn't. The last part of the final room has a large wall projection video of DaVinci's Last Supper painting. It was short and didn't offer any new insight. It seemed to be experiencing technical difficulties with playback and color when we went through.

Everyone should admire, celebrate, and respect the life and creativity of Da Vinci. His impact as an inventor, artist, architect, engineer, and true renaissance man is probably unparalleled. My advice is to do so, but just not at the Venetian Hotel Imagine Exhibtions Gallery unless you are super bored with everything else Vegas has to offer for fun, entertainment, or relaxation. 

I'm not sure if Da Vinci was the first to say "There's a sucker born every minute.", but he probably was. Don't be that sucker by forking over cash for the Da Vinci - The Genius exhibit.

OHHH look rednekz it's a NASCAR reproduction of the M&Ms sponsored ride... go take a picture or see if you can put it in your suitcase... wouldn't it look good up on blocks in front of the trailer with all the dogs shading underneath it?

I had my first taste of the Capistrami in Vegas and was so excited they opened a location in Beverly Hills, but after coming to this new location, i am reminded that i still like the set up in Vegas the best. 
It feels alot more family run and friendly here.
Place your order first with the cooks, grab your drinks out the fridge and chips to munch on, and pay at the register. Be generous and give them tip for their Beer Fund! 

I've enjoyed the Bobbie and the Slaw Be Jo, (the philly is too spicy for me), but i still love their Capistrami the best. This time we got a 20 inch of that, and 12 inch roast beef Slaw Be Jo. They have tastykakes here, which i have yet to try and i love their potato chip selection. 

If ur tired of buffet gorging or don't have enough money left to keep splurging, and had enough of Sonics, I def recommend trying their pastrami!

It really pains me to give this place a two star rating. The owner and the staff are really nice people but my emotions from this place has ranged from not bad to this sucks over the last few visits.

The last time I was there my burger and fries were gnarly bad. The fries were not cooked and tasted like oil and the burger had me thinking what was I thinking by coming here for lunch. Well at least I got a free soda by checking in on Yelp.

As painful as it may sound, even hippies must retire one day.

Acrobatics, singing, comedy, incredible costumes, dancing, lots of sexual innuendos, men with rock hard abs and women's boobies. Lots and lots of women's bobbies. Yup, this shows got something for every adult out there. 

Before you call me a perv, my wife is the one who picked out what show we were going to see while in Vegas, so call her the perv. 

Like I stated above, Zumanity has something for everyone. Contrary to what you may have heard, Zumanity is not all about sex. 

Well, it actually is but not in a pornographic way. It's sexy, sensual, seductive and most importantly, tastefully done. The choreographer of Zumanity did an amazing job at making sure this show is as steamy and racy as possible without crossing any major lines. Of course there were a few folks in the sold out arena who were not prepared for what they witnessed and actually left during the performance but for the most part, the crowd was really into what was taking place on the gorgeous stage. 

Some of the highlights of Zumanity are these two incredibly beautiful woman swimming in a fish bowl, a very attractive red headed girl doing amazing things with silver hula hoops, two super sexy dudes battling it out for a woman's affection only to fall for each other during the brawl and of course all the crowd interactions. 

I couldn't believe the things the two hilarious MC's would get the audience to partake in. They took two random people from the audience and pretty much made them dry hump each other on stage while their significant others watched from their seats. HILARIOUS. 

If you're the type of person who gets uncomfortable in risque situations than this show is definitely not for you. If you're into risque situations, dirty jokes, intimate, steamy scenes, sexy men with rock hard abs and stunning woman with their breasts hanging out for the world to see, than Zumanity is a MUST SEE. If you look hard enough on the web, you can get good seats for reasonable prices.

Your mileage at Cartel will vary, based totally on your expectations and what you want in a cup of coffee.  If you are concerned about where your coffee beans are grown, how they are roasted, fair trade practices, and the difference between a French press and an aeropress, then this is definitely your place.  If you are looking for a coffee drink that involves a blender, whipped cream, and caramel drizzle, then you'll be disappointed.  I'm not judging either group, because depending on the day of the week I've been in both.  

The day we hit Cartel was for a much-needed caffeine injection.  The coffee menu is very limited, but iced Americano was front and center.  The barista informed me that even though that was a menu option, I was better off ordering an iced coffee that was cold brewed specifically for that purpose.   She went on to give me all of the nuances in great detail.  And she was right, it was an excellent choice.

They also offered homemade pop tarts, which were a must try for me.  They ended up being more like a frozen Pillsbury toaster strudel, just a lot greasier.  

If you're a coffee snob, this is a place you will love.  And rightfully so.  If you just want a cup of coffee and Cartel is closer than Dunkin' Donuts or 7-Eleven, then you may feel overwhelmed or intimidated.  The employees at this location don't do it on purpose, they are just very passionate about their coffee.  And that's never a bad thing.  Now the employees at the Cartel at the airport?  That's a different story, for a different review.

Well it's another weekend and another Sam Fox Concept restaurant to try.  Life is so boring here in the Valley.  LOL

There have been quite a few "premium priced" burger places popping up lately.  So, in many ways Zinburger's only competition in this category has been Hopdoddy. Both are upscale $10 plus burger places, that have interesting choices of tastes, add-ons, buns, etcetera. 

The food at Zinburger is very good. It's served fast and you won't feel like your wallet took a major hit. Our bill came to $33.00 before taxes and gratuities, which is expensive when only compared to the "In 'n Out" and "Habit Burger" of the world. But for us, it's the Zinburger's taste which we feel is unique and worthy of their premium price that makes us want to come back and we will. 

We tried their Kobe Burger ($15.00), Sam Burger ($11.00) and Zucchini fries ($7.00) and blown away the experience. The Sam had applewood smoked bacon, cheese and 1000 island dressing, which all worked well together. But the star was the Kobe, which is served simply with cheddar cheese, mushrooms and mayonnaise.  You have to try it, it's delicious. Really!

Enjoy!

If you LOVE TO SHOP, this is pretty much a MUST STOP for you. But if you're like me who would rather gamble and eat in vegas than spend hours in a mall, this place is pretty intimidating. If it wasn't for the goal of finding Vosges chocolates at the most furthest point possible from where we were, i would rather be taking a nap with those men waiting for their women on the benches. The bad thing about this place, is if ur not interested in most of the stores, to get to one end to the other, you pretty much have to go through all the same stores you just passed, to get back if you want to stay out of the sun. I was looking for a secret passageway that would just transport me back to the casino (cuz i can walk miles through a casino if i wanted) but i couldn't find one. And that "show" is a bit creepy- u know what im talking about!

I give 4 stars though for housing Max Brenner Chocolate Heaven. 
Next time, i have to walk through this place, My first stop will be to get my Chocolate cookie from Max Brenner to make the backtracking more bearable and find Payard Patisserie.

A good British steak house in the Paris?  Why not.

Love him or hate him, Gordon Ramsay is a multi Michelin stared chef.  Trying his London restaurants dispelled the myth for me that British food is bland and flavorless.  That said, at Gordon Ramsay Steak, the British signature dishes are the standouts.  As a steakhouse, it falls in the middle of the pack in price and quality behind Cut, StripSteak, and CraftSteak.

Two types of beef, limited cuts (epically if you are not sharing your steak).  28 day dry aged, prime beef is excellent.  Well trimmed.  Good marbling.  Beefy with the waft of umame.  The American kobe is feminine; tender, mild, almost sweet.  They claim the beef rates a BMS 10+ (Japanese A5), could be but it's nowhere near as flavorful as Australian or Japanese wagyu.

The signature dishes are outstanding.  Flavors are bold.  The Beef Wellington with a syrupy, red wine demi packs a flavor punch.  A classic.  The "Fisherman's Grill" is also exceptional.  Perfectly cooked lobster, mussels, scallops served with a silky curry sauce.  Oh yeah!.  

Sides meant to be shared.  The mushroom tart, gratineed spinach and blue cheese mac and cheese are good eats and make the perfect match to the dry aged beef by heightening the umame aftertaste.  Unfortunately their flavors overpower the kobe cuts.

Service is friendly and very efficient.

Very good international wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.

Note:  Use your Total Rewards casino card to get a slight (5-10 percent) discount.  Tier does not matter.

Dueling pianos? In Vegas? You wouldn't think this is a way to have fun in Sin City, but it is. After losing a few bills at the tables, eating a belly-busting buffet, and seeing the Vegas show du jour, you're going to want a place to simply drink and feel comfortable. That place is The Bar at Times Square in New York New York Hotel & Casino.

My wife is from Asia and loves Karaoke. The Bar at Times Square is not about karaoke. It's about dueling pianos, sing-a-long songs, and customer requests. She calls it "White people fun" and I have to admit the crowd was like 97.3% Caucasian. Maybe she's right. 

The crowd was also 92.1% drunk and that's exactly where I fit in. I may not know all the songs, but I do know how to shout "another round over here." It took awhile to score a seat, but once we did ($$), I was totally having a blast listening to other drunks belt out classics from the 70s and 80s like they actually remembered the words.

With so many "fake" things in Vegas, its surprisingly refreshing at the Bar at Times Square to see people having fun, laughing, and singing in a way that not only felt natural, but was natural.

The idea of paying for a self-wash seemed a little silly, but after trying it at home and making a big mess -- only to end up with the dog outside in the mud within minutes after the bathing, and leaving them so moist that a funky smell develops as they dry -- it became an obvious and worthwhile choice.

My first experience with self-wash, at a nearby competitor, was horrible, but my time at Wag&Wash was so much better.

The facility here is clean and fairly spacious.  The stainless steel tubs are sturdy, and the spray equipment and drains all worked well.  They had a rubber brush to use on the dog's fur while sudsing and washcloths available for cleaning ears, etc.

I did have a little trouble with the suction-cup-leash that was supposed to hold my 70 lb dog secured to the front side of the tub.  
It didn't.  
A wet dog jumping over the edge of a slippery wet stainless steel tub that's elevated several feet over a slippery wet tile floor is not a healthy combination for the poor dog, who pulled a "Bambi on ice" and comically (but i'm sure painfully) spread all four limbs out in all directions and landed face first on the floor.  I asked for a non-suction-cup leash and secured him to a bar at front of the tub afterwards, but damage done.

Just go with the basic wash; the pricing options for various extras aren't worth it.  Why pay an extra several dollars for a specific scent of shampoo, when there isn't a conditioner with the same scent, since the conditioner is what the dog ends up smelling like afterwards, not the shampoo?

The blow dryers were powerful enough to blow out not only the water, but lots of leftover hair.  Sometimes the nozzle end blew off the hose, but i'd rather have the blowers be too hard than too soft.

I feed rawmeatybones, so i didn't shop the food selection much, but the premium brands offered are expectedly pricey.  I did pick up a rubber brush for cheap de-furring.

I will be back to use my frequent washer card.

Check out the pic of poor, wet, sad Doogie.

"We don't fit in" says my poker bud.

"What are you talking about" I say.

"Look around, everyone in here is Asian" he whispers.

"And what are we?" I answer dumbfounded.

"No, I mean they are like Wong Fu Asian.  You know, guys in skinny jeans carrying around stuffed animals for girls who weigh 90 pounds or less and take pics with whisker fingers" he continues.

Laughing uncontrollably "Shut up and eat your menu".

Sweet Raku is about hand crafted, refined, JAPANESE desserts; delicate flavors and natural, subtle sweetness.  This is not the diabetic sugary desserts most Americans are familiar with.  A fresh fruit would have the same amount of sweetness as their offerings.

Tip: Opt for the three course tasting.  Widest selection and best value.

Standout examples:

Mt. Fuji - A neutral chestnut sponge cake topped with lightly candied chestnuts robbed in ribbons of airy chestnut cream.  An ode to the chestnut.

Ringo - Modern take on the apple pie.  Barely sweetened apples sandwiched between flaky, slightly salty crust atop white chocolate.  A blown sugar apple filled with cream and an aromatic, slightly bitter sweet honey ice cream, all dusted with powder sugar finish the plate.  

Good selection of coffee and tea drinks.  Well chosen wine list.  Great off Strip prices.

And yes, the menu was delicious.

Have you ever watched those dumb/boring/nerdy space documentaries that tell you lies regarding the impossibility of time travel? Some dude with a talking computer tells you "...currently, there is no way to deviate from the space-time continuum"... Lies! I'll tell you how to do it.  You don't even need to buy a time machine on eBay like Kip Dynamite. Just get into your car (no, it doesn't have to be a Delorian) and drive to 7th Ave and Thomas Rd (just south of Thomas on the E side), and BAM! You, my friend have entered another dimension.

You walk into this place and you expect to see Cowboy Biff sitting at the bar. Unfortunately, all you see is elderlies shuffling about. Well, they must know something that we all don't. Like an old man/woman secret that they only tell their peers. You, my friend, have just learned their secret! Sit down and order yourself a Black Bean Burger. What? You say you don't like vegetarian food? Well, neither do I! Trust me. Do it!

While you wait, you can imagine you are your grandpa at 12 years old. Just stopping into the local soda fountain shop to get a smooth refreshing malt. Being a 12 year old in the 1930s, you notice how modern and sleek the decor is in here. Ice cream adverts everywhere... Makes you want to stay 12 forever.

"Mom, can I have some ice cream?" Oh, I mean "Sorry, can I get a strawberry malt with that Black Bean Burger? Ahem, thanks..."

I've been to Erased three times now. Time for my review and I'll post some before and after pics. I echo previous reviews in the location being clean and nice. Erased uses the NaturaLase QS 2J laser which is state of the art. Contrary to popular belief, It doesn't hurt as bad as you would think. The technology has come a long way thankfully. I had a black tattoo removed many many years ago and that was full blown torture... and that was WITH numbing cream and I have a high pain tolerance. Couldn't imagine it without that cream... Geez! The doctor had to physically hold my foot down and it took everything within me to not kick that doctor in the face it hurt so bad! And you could smell your skin burning in the room. It was downright awful! I'm so appreciative of the fact that the tattoo removal experience is not like that anymore because to be honest, I don't know if I could do it again. Certain ink colors hurt worse than others and if the tattoo is near a bone or on a sensitive area, you might feel more pain but it's over so fast, it won't even phase you. If you could handle getting the tattoo in the first place, you can definitely handle the removal process so don't be a puss people! If you want to get it done, do it! And better yet, do it at Erased!

I'm saying goodbye to "the only tattoo that mom's like" (Tigger & Winnie the Pooh) along with a daisy with a peace sign in the middle on my butt and a daisy on my toe (the friendship tattoo curse). Sayonara to all these mistakes! I'm not regretting this decision one bit. I promise to post pics of my progress along the way for all to see.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 40/100

Quite a pleasure to see while visiting Vegas! There is a huge lake in front of the Bellagio hotel, which is where the water fountain show takes place every 15-30 minutes. My boyfriend and I recently watched it this past weekend and it was wonderful! The particular show we watched was played along to the song, "All That Jazz." 

As much as I loved watching these fountains, I still think that I wasn't as impressed as I could have been. I've watched World Of Color at California Adventure in Anaheim, CA, and I think that World Of Color is MUCH more impressive than the Fountains of Bellagio. Don't get me wrong, the Bellagio fountains are great and definitely the landmark on the strip, BUT they aren't the best I've ever seen.

Ok, for me if there's one thing that comes close to Buffet, it's a fried chicken place!  Thus, I wasn't about to miss the opportunity to get together with Robyn N. & Arlin B. today & have lunch today at this busy little place.  It was my first visit, & here's how it struck me:

*  Funky, unique, fun atmosphere & vibe about the place.  It's a screwy building to start with, then your water or beverage shows up in a quart canning jar, & so on!  FUN IS GOOD!!

*  Our service was prompt & attentive, & the staff members made it clear that they were glad we came here to eat!  These really nice people helped make the experience special.  FRIENDLY IS GOOD!!

*  Somewhat unusual (for me anyway), very tasty food overall.  DIFFERENT IS GOOD!!

*  Then, OMG, the chicken!!  TERRIFIC FRIED CHICKEN IS GOOD!!     :-))

Did not know you could Zipline in Vegas!!! 

Buddy Ken C told me that you can zipline down Freemont Street for about 20 bucks. This definitely peaked my interest, but when the time came, i didn't feel like it- maybe it was the fear of getting stuck in the middle of the zipline and having to wait for someone to come fetch me, while i hang over hundreds of people (which did happen to a girl we saw). The wait on a friday night took a very long time, over an hour. But from all the smiling faces i saw ziplining above me while i watched, it looked like a lot of fun. We videotaped our friend coming down - they sell pictures of you ziplining for $20.00. 
If ur lucky, you might get to zipline during the Queen show, where they dim the lights a bit and play "We Will Rock You". You can zipline at the same time with 3 other people, so it would be a cool group activity (you can get group prices). Maybe next time, if i get buzzed enough, i might take the "leap". I'll be sure to take a considerate plastic bag with me.

Get the Banana Cream Pie!!! (5 stars!)

Hope to come back here soon to try dinner and more of that pie, but i had to yelp about the delicious pie. For one order, they give you a pretty big portion. My friend got it to go, and it still held up after a couple of hours. We dug in and i loved the crispy crust with the creamy custard. The bananas and chocolate combined with that makes it so dreamy. 
A MUST GET if you're dining here (or passing by!).

"It's like a jungle sometimes, 
It makes me wonder, 
How I keep from going under..."

hopefully Gallo Blanco doesn't go under anytime soon..this spot has been the home of many failstraunts, you know..the places that just can't hang. i really hope more for wee lil' Gallo Blanco.

the menu is straight forward, not overly complicated with too many items to choose from. really easy to fall in love with the simplicity. the 2.00 tacos are really good. and if i ate fish, i could try to settle the long lasting debate on if PHX really has Culture or not...fated by Fish Tacos

but alas, that question still lingers. i can say tho..that if culture was fated on Pork or Beef tacos then i could confidently say that PHX has mad culture. cause the tacos here are awesome. 2 bucks for 3 bites of a fully loaded soft corn tortilla. totally money well spent.

the corn on the cob is freaking amazing. i don't typically order corn on the cob in restaurants because i don't want to be picking corn out of my teeth while having dinner conversation...but these...these right here..these right here are totally worth it. get all that corn up in your chompers and enjoy.

4 stars for great food, comfortable atmosphere.

i took a star from the bland horchata and semi remote location.

PSYCHO

We were walking through casino from Paris to Bally's when we saw a giant bronze bear that was almost 7 feet tall. We decided to go in and check it out. An older gentleman approached us with a really cool mustache. I inquired how much is the bear. 

He looked at me and said, "4250!" 

I then said to my buddy, "He said 4250!" 

My buddy, Tony M said, "$42.50!" 

The guy then went ballistic!!! He looks at us and says, "I'm raising the price for you to $43,000!" We laughed thinking the guy was being funny with us. 

He then said, "If you don't have $43,000 in your wallet then get out of the store!" He then took his hand and slapped himself as hard as he could into his bald forehead. I realized that this guy must be crazy!

A second salesman came up to us to smooth things over but we were done. We weren't spending our hard earned money on a giant bronze bear. A couple of other customers walked out with us. We all talked about how crazy the sales guy was and wondered does anyone ever buy anything there?

We never made it past the giant bronze bear but I'm sure everything in here is overpriced for the high rollers or recent casino winners. We won't be coming back but we will always remember the day we survived the psycho bronze bear salesman. Welcome to Vegas!

When you're far from home, the minute you see a familiar face out in that huge sea of people, you instantly smile. That's how I feel everytime I see the Hawaiian Air Las Vegas ohana... They have that island style spirit that our Hawaii is so famous for. You can tell that they miss home too, in the islands and for them, like us, it's nice to see familiar faces. Hawaiian Airlines has always been my go to carrier when traveling to the west coast and Vegas. They've since moved operations from the old International terminal and now operate out of the new Terminal 3, D concourse. Access by a high speed tram is so easy. The new digs also offer us travelers access to new shops, concessions and yes, slot machines! But getting back to our Hawaiian ohana, it helps to have friendly staff with the Aloha spirit since a lot of times we as travelers need assistance at the gates, etc. I have never felt guilty of like I was bothering any of them whenever I had a question or concern about something. Traveling can be intimidating for some, confusing to others and just downright unpleasant. It sure helps when you have a friendly face to talk to at the beginning of a long journey home and a smile. That alone will cure your anxieties! Keep up the good work Hawaiian!

Oh, and btw, be sure to download the Hawaiian Air app if you have a smartphone, it's so convenient and easy to use. Check in, change seats, upgrade, do it all from the app! You'll never be scrambling to find a computer anymore!

Best.Bowling.Ever. Well... not by me. I bowled terribly, but I pretty much had the best time ever doing it!

$11.85 for all you can bowl for four hours plus shoes on a Friday night?!? Bargain! $2 beers (Bud Light). I don't drink that piss water but everyone else seemed happy. 

Kick ass DJ rockin Van Halen, Michael J, Phil Collins and The Temptations!? Chickity Check!

Quite possibly the biggest parking lot in the world. I doubt it has ever been filled up.

The bartender was slower than the second coming... literally. I must have missed two round of bowling waiting for my drop top. This is the only reason I am giving it four stars and not five.

SO, yeah... I have my own shoes and ball. I'm a geek, nerd, dork, whatever. Unfortunately the sole of one of my shoes broke off in transit so I had to borrow some from the alley. They were pretty dope. I actually considered leaving the one shoe they take in collateral so I could take those awesome bowling shoes home!!

All I really have left to say is that this is the best bowling alley I have ever been to!

It was only two or three weeks ago that Lee told me she was working on licensing to expand, so it came as a sad surprise to read on FB today that she decided to sell the business AND close shop.  The status update mentioned that the flavors will soon make their way to grocery freezers, but not even the pretty and kind Gina knew about this when I stopped by at the shop this afternoon*.  [I had plans to go from massage to happy hour at a new place (to me!) when I decided I'd stop by and speak to someone at the shop itself about the sad news...]

Doors close tomorrow evening at 7 pm, so hurry and stock up on your favorite flavors!  Psst!  The Red Velvet Scotch was tasty!  (The cake's recipe is one of Paula Deen's.)  The flavor was a tad sweet, perhaps, but I definitely could discern the scotch and red velvety treasure there.  Plus, it's so pretty!!  :)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lees-cream-liqueur-scottsdale?select=I5PSw4fpFZdIWCG_3wkbng#I5PSw4fpFZdIWCG_3wkbng

Some of my favorite yelpers have been displeased with the antics of one Miss Lisa G. So needless to say I was a bit nervous when meeting Kristin S for lunch recently. Will one of their famous "balls" be hurled at my head if I use the wrong fork? If I take too long to dine will I be ejected by a rogue mob of hospitality lesbians? Upon entering the tiny, sparse yet comfortable space I was immediately greeted and seated. My beverage order was taken quickly and delivered promptly with a smile. Hmmm...now. I'm waiting for Kristin S. Is this where I will be sneered and jeered at by anxious table turning servers? Nope. The menu is limited to sandwiches and salads. Not even a soup. I chose the tuna salad with a Dijon caper dressing...fantastic. Kristin S had the veggie sandwich and said it was good as well. The decor is clean, warm and modern. I could do without the pictures of children on the wall. Really. Was this a day care before? The balls? I guess I'll have to try them next time. Though eating balls made by a lesbian does make me a tad nervous. Lisa G? Gee I think I'll be back.

While it's expensive and far from flawless, Rose. Rabbit. Lie. is the most unique venue I've ever been to. I can see people having a love/hate relationship here, but trust me, it's worth going just to find out which camp you belong to. 

As mentioned earlier, drink prices are absurd. $16 a drink, including beers. Yes, I bought my friend a $16 Stella. Gross. However, this isn't just a bar. There are a ton of roaming entertainers, including a a piano player, an 8-bit band(?), a burlesque dancer, tap dancers, magicians, a beatboxer, aerialists, etc. performing every 15 min or so. So you're paying for an overall experience, which is cool. I spoke to some diners about the performances and they all said they were welcome distractions and didn't take anything away from the meal. So there's that...

Take some time to explore the different rooms and all of their features. You'll find little quirky things all over the place. At midnight the venue opens up and there's a small show with many of the roaming performers. In the end, I dropped $100 on drinks, but was entertained thoroughly for 2.5 hours. Sure, that $$ could've bought a Cirque tik, but this is a totally different experience.  

Full disclosure: I didn't eat a thing nor did I see a ticketed performance (midnight show only).

Within my first hour at Beacher's, I saw:

- A woman with the biggest boobs I'd ever seen crush beer cans, a watermelon and 3 wooden boards with her massive chest.  
- Midgets attached to a harness flying over the club delivering bottles to tables 
- A girl puking into her friend's hand as they were sprinting out of the club (true friendship)
- To my shock and surprise, my wife being excited to see Pauly D (is it 2010 up in here?)
-Lots and lots of confetti

It's a club without a dance floor.  If you're not getting bottle service, you're kind of screwed since there isn't really anywhere to hang otherwise.  It basically turned into a sea of humanity around 1am.  The music was mainly 90's hip hop/R&B with some splashes of EDM.

So the DJ rocks out for about 15 minutes and then there's a "show" which ranges from midget wrestling to magic to a Pee Wee Herman impersonator and then it goes back to the DJ.  Most of the "shows" weren't that great.  I felt like most of them actually killed the momentum of the party.  Everyone is up on their feet jamming out to a fun tune, then they stop the music and everyone has to sit down to watch the show.  

I think people might have loved this stuff 10-12 years ago when Jeff Beacher first gained notoriety for his traveling band of freaks but not when Rose Rabbit Lie has stepped up this kind of game to a whole new level.  The midget bottle delivery was still damn funny though.

What happens at Dick's Cabaret stays at Dick's Cabaret as far as I am concerned... at least (most of) the details do!

So, for all of you that said you were "in" last night to the Dick's Cabaret UYE and didn't make it, let me tell you - you really missed out!  

It looks like Ali beat me to the punch with her UFC review, but to add to what she shared, I will say that when I return to Dick's (and I'm sure I will), I'll make sure to go a little later in the night (we hear it gets going closer to 10 or 11) and I'll have a few drinks before hand too.  Nothing like sitting on stage with three almost naked men dancing and grinding all around you, being told to "smack that ass" and being completely sober!

Before last night, the closest male entertainment I'd seen was "Thunder Down Under" in Vegas and maybe a stripper at a party or two - but Dick' was different... while the place may not be the classiest I've seen and the dancers may not have sparkly outfits or high heeled shoes, these guys take it all off!  Thanks for the entertainment, West Coast, Cal, and my favorite - Rocky!

Thanks for some of the best entertainment I've had in a long time, Junior and company... and thanks to the rest of you yelper friends for joining and being such great sports.  What a fun night!  Oh, and I now own my very own "Got Dick?" tank top souvenir.  Maybe I'll wear it to the next OYE!  (It's so cute!)

**Disclosure statement: Names of the innocent other yelp attendees have been omitted - I'll let them share their own reviews if they choose to do so!

This is my "Go To" spot for exchanging foreign currency.  Whenever I travel abroad I do some research on exchange rates in the country I'm visiting vs this joint.  9 times out of 10 they are very competitive with their rates and I'd rather exchange large sums of currency in Vegas than in a foreign country.

I was here the other day to convert some US Dollars to Chinese RMB in preparation for an upcoming trip to China.  I called prior to driving down here and asked what the exchange rate was.  They were offering 6.53 RMB to 1 USD.  Luckily, I had a classmate in Beijing that just exchanged some currency the day before and she said the exchange rate at banks in Beijing was 6.45-6.75 RMB to 1 USD.  Not a bad deal!  I'll pay the small vig for the convenience of dealing with someone in my home country where communication is easy.

One of the bad things about this place is the parking.  If you're a visitor, you have to park in the underground parking garage.  That's the last place you want to walk to after converting a lot of currency.  

Which leads me to my second complaint about this place.....there's no privacy.  There is a large counter in the office where you conduct your transactions and a large window facing the street where people can look inside and see what you're doing. (see pics)  Not a cool situation if you're counting a lot of money on the counter.  I've always felt uncomfortable in that sense.

Overall Value - they offer great exchange rates, I'm always satisfied with the value they offer.

Will I return?  Unless a better option presents itself, there's no doubt I'll be back!

This is the exact place I love to hate. But I can't. I cannot hate you, Lodge. I just can't!

In fact, if this place didn't have taxidermied animals (yes, I just made a word up) and antler headpiece things as chandeliers, I would probably be giving this place 5 stars....... I KNOW! I can't believe it either!!

My first experience with The Lodge was as Yelp Bachelorette. I was hammered (give me a break; it was the most important day of my life so far) so I didn't think it was fair to review after not really "being there," if you know what I mean.

My second experience was last night with THE Bachelor himself, Dallas G. Yet again, the staff was incredibly friendly, quick with the service, and willing to accommodate my vegan, gluten free existence without fault. They have an amazing black bean veggie burger and orgasm inducing sweet potato fries.  DG could learn a thing or two from those fries.

Just Kidding. 

Now, here is the BEST part of all: THREE DOLLAR SKY VODKA DRINKS FOR THE LADIES.

You don't need to know the rest.

The success of Hash House may be directly related to the frequency of hangovers in Vegas. Just the sight of their leaning towers of fried chicken and waffles could cure your hangover faster than IV hydration (which, freakishly enough, is a service you can find easily in Vegas). 

Opting for a fork & knife remedy over surgical needles, our experience at Hash House was thoroughly therapeutic, and still very Vegas-y. The ambiance is not much different than your local Denny's: big booths, neon colored cocktails in tumbler sized glasses, and smiley waitresses. They do have some outdoor seating and a fun 90s playlist in the background, but the real selling point is the MENU. 

It'll be hard to order anything but those famous sage-fried chicken & bacon-stuffed waffles everyone is Yelping about. But in case you're anti-poultry or gluten-free, you'll still find something to drool over on their gigantic menu. Homemade biscuits, big salads, scrambles, benedicts, crab cakes, griddled cheese, and meatloaf are all part of the uber-American offerings. Prices are also huge: $18 chicken & waffles, $15 cocktails, for example. But, be wise and share everything. These are party portions, and you've had enough of that. 

Shout out to our waitress who was SO cool, and happily split our check 4 ways without an inkling of annoyance. And hooray for fresh grapefruit & pineapple mimosas for $7... because quitting cold turkey isn't good for anyone.

They INTERPRETATE the music so well!!! 
(Holla at ABDC season 1 fans!)

It was very difficult keeping the show tickets a secret from my dude- a huge Jabba fan. Bought them about a month in advance, we got 3rd row seats for about $70.00 each. Pricey indeed, but it was so worth it to see them live, so close and their 1.5 hour show was packed to the brim with Jabba-ness. When i could finally reveal the big surprise of the tickets, we were full of giddy smiles the entire time. From the very entertaining preshow until the end, we were fully ENTERTAINED!!!! 
Actually reading some of the things in the negative reviews made me sad and little butt-hurt that they were not ENTERTAINED! These are no skinny lizards- but some of the baddest mofos i've ever seen dance. I didn't give a f*ck if some of the story was a little odd or didn't really make sense to me the whole time. I was just happy to see them recreate some of their ABDC performances as well as a whole slew of new routines. ABDC fans will recognize special guest appearances by SuperCr3W members, which was awesome. I loved the playfulness of the glow in the dark sequence, the oldskool segment and the Single Ladies ofcourse. I especially liked the KB solos and it was fun spotting the individuals behind their masks, like Phil's booty shaking and Rynan's impressive headspins. 

A MUST SEE for TRUE Jabbawockeez fans!!!
Great show for hip hop music/dance fans.
Hit or miss for those unfamiliar.

Get seats in the front or center aisle and you may get picked for audience participation!

Sexy Museum!

On my last trip to Vegas I was trying to find stuff to do that is fun and cheaper than gambling. Additionally this is a non profit place so its tax deductable LOL seriously! 
In an attempt to limit my time spent on slot machines and card tables, I yelped some alternate things to do for fun and found this place. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ev1SC6q8AolQWix0n577sg?select=YO2XeytGnySkqj0MRiwuyg#nS2C-9-m1bWaMhm8qvb8aA

Ok so curiosity killed the cat but I had to find out what this was all about. And let me tell ya this place is a gold mine of goodies that has something for everyone.  

From vintage porn movie posters for the foodies of Yelpland http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ev1SC6q8AolQWix0n577sg?select=YO2XeytGnySkqj0MRiwuyg#zuLMyqtb0ZJ-t1wPGnR5N  to sexy vintage shoes for the footies of Yelp  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ev1SC6q8AolQWix0n577sg?select=YO2XeytGnySkqj0MRiwuyg#lFm7eYqnjLUUAA6561OMwA

The place has a huge display of all sorts of things pertaining to sexuality from brutal stone tribal deflowering tools to vintage sexual stimulators to modern day sex toys. 

There are tributes to modern day sexual pioneers like Hefner and Flynt as well as homage to todays porn actors and actresses.

They even have a reverse theater in the round featuring movies from the 20s thru the 70s. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ev1SC6q8AolQWix0n577sg?select=je9yXDiPizYyFRHcE_lyXg#zCw6wzIFVaK_qfPeuOqIMQ

The art collection upstairs (sorry no pics) has some truely amazing works of art and photography, including a fantastic vagina picture picture collection (Petals) that runs along a complete wall and highlights both beauty and contrast. Ever seen a 4 foot golden penis? Minature carved ivory Japanese sex idols? 

And hey the gay community is not left out, there are vintage films, book collections and some beautiful lesbian erotica paintings.

There was an interesting collection of newspaper clippings highlighting the continual run ins our polititions, clergy, and public figures have with the law.

This would be a great spot for a date night ... really. And if your date goes really, really, really well they have a special wedding chapel/honeymoon deal they rent out. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ev1SC6q8AolQWix0n577sg?select=je9yXDiPizYyFRHcE_lyXg#DG3AFR9MNLcoZxxBQisVPQ

They have a small gift shop and a private library for students. This is a pretty cool place I'd visit again. They even have the Yelp sticker of approval on the door. And I owe this cool discovery to my VBC Canadian friend Yvonne F. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ev1SC6q8AolQWix0n577sg?select=je9yXDiPizYyFRHcE_lyXg#QiNoFi8JAQJ1Lfv4G4hAJA
So go give them a visit and dont forget to UFC (FUC) this review!

Cronuts & Yelpers are what drew me to this place. Saturday morning and all a buzz with the breakfast crowd. Just walking by, you want to come in and be a part of this hip looking establishment. My inner sweet tooth wanted to climb over the dessert window upon entering. This is no average bakery. The desserts are plump and inviting and not the standard grocery store baked goods that are a dime a dozen.
Today we came for the much anticipated CRONUT that I couldn't wait to try and even called to make sure they had them. Dominic was nice enough to set aside some for me. Well my proverbial eyes were much, much too big to handle what we would encounter. In doing a little research on the cronut, I thought they would be manageable sized "croissant donuts". So I told them to hold 6. Lo and behold, we get to the counter and see that each cronut is sliced and layered in between is a rich vanilla custard. 6 was an overkill. The girl at the counter was nice enough to take back a few when our eyes bugged out at the $30 tab. The cronuts were much heavier and more dense than I would have liked. They tasted good, but I didn't want to waste my whole weekend's caloric limit on 1 cronut. I would have preferred them much lighter and similar to a croissant texture. But I'm glad we tried Bread & Butter as this may become our weekend breakfast spot.

Vegetarian?  Here's a pickle.  This is the carnivore's domain.

Note:  Everything I know about BBQ, I learned on TV.  I've been to Memphis, Kansas City, and Dallas and never had a lick of the stuff.  Even better, growing up in Hawaii, we boiled our ribs before grilling them.  I'm quite the expert.  But...

The wafting aroma of sweet hickory smoke.  The earthy, mild spice rub that has deeply penetrated the proteins; a moist, beefy rib with tender sinew and rendered fat;  fall off the bone baby backs; "suckably" delicious cartilage of toothsome spareribs, and glistening slices of brisket.  The acrid, bitterness of the smoke ring in strong contrast to the almost sweet meat.   Food porn!

The sauce has a good vinegar kick that helps to cut the one dimensional flavor and cloying, richness that becomes more difficult to take the more you eat and the colder it gets.  

Their signature, bigger than any human's mouth, stuff falling out, BBQ sauce on your face "outlaw" burger is good eats.  Brisket, sauteed onions, peppers, fried onion strips, slaw, veg, cheese and a chipolte aioli; what's not to love?

Remaining menu items less successful.  The breaded catfish and shrimp are both overcooked and rubbery.  The smoked meatloaf, excessively smoky and bitter.  Deep fried sides often oily with one exception, the outstanding cream corn nuggets.  Crispy on the outside, rich creamy corn goodness on the inside.

Prices are very reasonable for the quantity.  The $24.99 AYCE a winner; anything on the menu, one price.

The worthy indulgence is not without cost.  Suffice it to say, remember waking up from a drunken stupor after having smoked your first cigar?  All the mouthwash in the world...

A nice 
place 
to go 
somewhere 
else 

Charlotte- Douglas is one of my very favorite airports and a very pleasant place to stop over for a while between flights on the way to somewhere else. 

It's not only clean but sparkling and squeaky clean. Things actually shine and it looks like you could literally eat off the floor. Pretty amazing with all those people thumping, thomping and thudging though it. 

The inside of the the airport is actually fun to explore and walk around, with line of trees, some very cool rocking chairs and little airplanes hanging overhead. Lots of corners to hang out in and plenty of little restaurants and shops scattered about. Even a people mover and escalators to play on although the things move too slowly to really have fun on. 

Sure it's an airport and everyone is in a hurry, some people are grumpy and the typical airport chaos does happen, but overall the folks I have meet here were are friendly and very hospitable. A nice contrast to the abrupt hostility sometimes found in employees of other airports. I'm always happy to see that my flight has a stop over in Charlotte- Douglas because I know I can have fun and will have no trouble killing a few hours here while waiting for another flight. Maybe someday I'll actually get out of the airport and see the city.

Another of the mutiple Starbucks locations located at MGM. This one is in the Studio Walk mall area and is a perfect spot to grab a cup o' joe on while walking around to the pool area, exploring the massiveness of this casino/resort, or on the the way to the monorail when heading out to the convention center.

Since most casinos won't put a coffee machine in the rooms we are stuck heading down to the main floor or these areas to score a cup of much needed morning caffeine. It's one of three locations in MGM alone! MGM is that big.

As I was here these past few days attending a convention along with thousands of others the lines at this one never seemed that long and  they moved pretty quickly. Normal Starbucks menu and the baristas were good. Yet, it seems as if they are a bit pricier than normal. Must be that casino inflation!

Want married men to buy you drinks while shamelessly flirting with you in front of their buddies?  One eye on you, and the other eye on basketball bets they can't afford to lose?  Come here during March Madness - or any day that ends in a "y."

Of course, our chances of meeting the single guys of our dreams were slightly soiled due to the Miss USA Pageant being held at our Hotel.  Rats!  Gosh darn pretty folk.  Try lounging poolside in a bikini, reading your John Grisham novel, when Miss Tennessee and Miss Georgia approach, block the sun, and ask if the seats beside you are taken in their  "ya'll cain't say no tuh us" drawls.  *suck in stomach? check! stick out arm? check!  feeling like hamburger next to steak? check!*

Since the Planet Hollywood was unable to do a complete overhaul of the Aladdin, they cut a few cost corners.  For example, my Hollywood-themed room had a genie lamp and some crazy swirly carpet.  Same great price and reliable everything - just painted purple and with giant PH symbols everywhere.

But the mall is still there!  There's nothing better than walking down to the lobby in the morning, taking 5 kamikaze shots, and then stumbling around the attached mall and spending the money in your "I'll get fired if my boss reads my Yelp reviews" savings account. 

They had nice ashtrays, which Lindsey and I glamorously threw up in on way to the airport the last morning.  See?  PH brought us a little closer to being Hollywood starlets.  

I look forward to seeing what else has been remodeled - in seven months, when I'm allowed to be within 100 yards of the property.

I see why Amy Winehouse doesn't want to go back to Rehab - - 'cause I don't want to either.

That being said, I voluntarily chose to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel, and willingly signed up to attend the douchebag/dirtyskank party at Rehab last Sunday.  It reminded me of those Spring Break parties you see on MTV, where the girls are having tickle fights on platforms next to a big pool and vodka redbull drinks are served in plastic cups with big straws.

I freaked out a little when my pink sundress wouldn't fly and was forced to walk around in my string bikini...  BUT, nobody vomited at the sight of me, and since everyone was wasted, I suspect I looked pretty damn fine.  In fact, I think it's safe to say it doesn't matter what your body looks like, as long as your outfit and hair/makeup are well assembled.

Kudos to the lifeguard who jumped in and rescued me from the 12 foot deep end .  He couldn't see my head (it was underwater), but had noticed my Rehab Souvenir Drink Cup sticking out of the water (I paid $25 for that, I wasn't gonna let it drown with me).  He dragged me to the shallow end, where I wiped the mascara off my face and promptly headed back to the bar for a refill.

As hotel guests, we had our own entrance, which allowed for easy (and free) entry/re-entry - - and for convenient 6:30 pm scrambling to our room to pass out.   

Note: Watch out for photographers.  When I removed my bikini bottoms in my room, a sopping wet  "Spy on Las Vegas - view pictures here" business card fell out.   There go my political aspirations.

Too many sweets to choose from!

I got a pleasant surprise today when the other half showed up with a bag from this bake shop! I've been sick & feeling crabby so this did the trick! To my surprise he got a lot of incredible goodies! 

Brownies that are so moist and come with a thick layer of fudge! A beautiful tiramisu that almost looks to good to break into. A vanilla cupcake because I'm obsessed with plain ones. A cream puff filled with decadent custard! Macaroons, a Nutella cookie, black & white cookies & chocolate covered strawberries! Talk about a way to a girls heart! 

I have no idea how we're going to eat all this stuff but we'll give it a good try! Everything I've ever tasted from this place has been great. Be prepared because it's very pricey but the quality is there.

This is my favorite Fox Concept restaurant.  I couldn't believe it.  The place is beautiful and so far the food we have tasted has been amazing.  My husband cannot get enough of the Korean skirt steak.  I took a few bites and I almost wanted to order that.  I rather save my calories for the drinks and dessert.  The Fig and Ginger mule is my favorite, specially when Tanner makes it, although Christina did a really good job also.  I cannot have enough of the Croissant Bread Pudding, it is a diet buster, but so worth it.  Next time I am going to have the salmon appetizer, the person sitting next to us at the bar recommended it highly.  It looked delicious.

I love this restaurant!  Just had dinner last night.  The pizza was outstanding.  You can pick your own ingredients and I picked Gorgonzola cheese, roasted chicken, spinach.  It was outstanding.  The staff was very efficient and had my meal in what seemed like minutes. Since I wanted dessert, I shared my pizza with my friend and will have the saved pieces for lunch. For dessert, I ordered the Tiramisu which was also outstanding. Will definitely visit this place again. The atmosphere is very nice, muted colors.  Great for a date or after work.

When the king of pop decided against "Beautiful Young Thing" for his epic 1982 album, Thriller, that set the wheels in motion for what we know today as BYT.

When this place is packed, and it gets packed, you'll be doing the moonwalk as patrons enter and exit by means of any open crevice between you and the other line-mongers.  Michael was so right... You Are Not Alone, but tough it out, because once you sink those bleached choppaz into your first bite, you'll Wanna Be Startin Somethin.

I can personally vouch for the carne asada, chicked and birria tacos, with the later being my favorite.  My wife and I split a carne, cheese and bean burrito.  My only complaint was the fatty chunks, and the gristle.  I wont ding them too hard, as they were totally slammed.

The biggest disappointment of the night came in a styrofoam cup.  The side of frijoles we ordered had to have been from a can... like a can of Rosarita.  I can see them needing a fallback with as  busy as they were, its possible they could have sold out of the good stuff.  I wont know for sure, until my return visit.  I use Elmer's Tacos or Rancho Market as my bean baseline, so be on your A game guys, because based on The Way You Make Me Feel will determine if I'm going to continue to Rock With You, or not... because I will Remember The Time.

I also polished off an order of chips & salsa, a Mexican coke and a large horchata... so I left pre-diabetic and pretty stuffed... so much that I almost didn't recognize that Man In The Mirror.

Well in the end not all Filiberto's are alike. 

I came here for a late lunch, around two-thirty. The outside had a modern look, similar to the one on Indian Bend, near the 101 Loop. 

Once inside, I noticed the walls were bright and freshly painted (photo).  The seats however were dilapidated. Almost every single one was ripped, with exposed cushions and springs. One had a jagged piece of metal sticking in the air.

The food on the other hand was good standard Mexican fair. I had two huge bean burritos, which were filling and made on a flaky grilled tortilla.  They were only $5.28 before tax. 

There is nothing wrong with the food, or the employees. They were all very nice and friendly!  Too bad they have to work in such a dump. 

The owner needs to blowout the seating and take a little more interest in the store!  

I might be back, but only at the drive-thru window.  I should have gone to Los Betos across the street. Ugh!

To paraphrase Carl Sagan..."In order to create fillipino/mexican fusion cusine, you must first invent the universe"

   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc

You will want to give that vid a look and a listen...preferably while enjoying some roasted piggy prepared by the utterly adorable Karey and friends:)

I had lunch with friends today at Karey's:)

A little lunch, a little solving of the worlds problems (without benefit of alcohol, this time:) even a discussion of the the galactic issues that confront us all (did you know that there is an excellent chance that the Milky Way Galaxy...our home...will collide with another galaxy (Andromeda), soon?!?!?

Less than 3.5 billion years...things could get very dicey!

Until then, whistle over to the SE corner of of 40th St. and Thomas Rd. and drop by and visit Karey.

She gave us samples (since who among us understands what fillipino/mexican fusion really is?

I will tell you what it is...it is really good!

I enjoyed samples of chicken coconut curry, pork adobo, the aformentioned piggy, beef mechado (no I didn't do that from memory...I took a menu:)

I was sorely tempted to to have the "all the above" platter, but I controlled myself:)

Pork adobo, Beef mechado and garlic rice, along with a shared order of lumpia egg rolls...just delightful:-)

I am happy to report that Karey's was busy during the entire lunch hour...I am also happy to report that Karey brought us a delightful little dessert cake to try...I did enjoy my lunch today:)

In the universe I've invented, single malt scotch flows like water, I have no need for tax attorneys and fillipino/mexican fusion cooking at Karey's Kitchen is here to stay:)

When you invent your own universe, be sure to include Karey's Kitchen...I might want to visit with you at lunch someday:)

Ladiessssssss....hold tight to those purses!

If you're a woman standing on the dance floor with a purse, you're a target. There's some kind of crime ring happening that can ruin an entire Vegas trip if they get their hands on too many personal items. They appear to be pick pocketing cell phones and if they can wiggle a wallet out while they're at it, game on. A handful of girls in our group noticed their cell phones were missing about an hour into the night and once those of us that still had ours started flashing the ground to see if we could find them, ladies dancing around us jumped in announcing that their cell phones had been swiped, too.

Sadly Hakkasan's security guys couldn't do anything about it, because their job is to keep the fire lanes clear and keep bottle service VIPs away from the commoners. It's a shame because if they had just put a few more security guards on the dance floor after the many complaints we sent their way about the situation, some people could have been safe from the thievery.

Losing your phone or ID on a Vegas weekend is probably one of the worst scenarios you can think of because your whole life is put on hold and you have to jump through hoops (while on vacation) to get everything back in order.

Props to securing kick ass DJs and the unlimited confetti budget, but there's a serious issue taking place under Hakkasan's roof that needs to be addressed. And fast.

I went to Rose.Rabbit.Lie. with my best friend, Leandra T., and I think she was correct when describing RRL as "just the right amount of wrong"  la the Cosmopolitan's tagline.  After seeing several billboards and taxi tops marketing RRL as a grand social experiment, our curiosity got the best of us, and we ended up catching the 12AM show.  I was taken aback when entering the venue, because I was anticipating Vegas' generic club scene, but my speculations were completely inaccurate.

We were seated by an usher in the center ring, and a show of human beat boxing, contortionists, dancers, singers, and a variety of performers appeared on stage one after the other.  My friends and I sat utterly bewildered when the pleasant surprise of a show appeared before us (as opposed to a bunch of drunks bumping & grinding--but that comes later, of course).

I'm giving my five stars solely on the show and club that presented itself immediately afterwards.  The performers grab you on the floor, and what was previously the stage turns into a dance floor.  I have yet to indulge in RRL's dining or cocktails, but I suppose that gives me an excuse to venture out to Las Vegas again soon. :)

I highly recommend visiting RRL when you're on the strip.  It's a beautiful mix of classy and bizarre.

Geez!  I've been dreading this review for the last couple of hours.  If this is the last review you see from me, it is because I have upset someone and they have killed me.

Cash Only? WTF! The hot dogs are barely good (flinches, looks over shoulder).  YEAH I SAID IT!  Its not so much the food I have a problem with, its the staff and the hype.

I mean, I had a feeling it wouldn't live up to the hype.  How could it?  Its a hot dog joint that has the reputation of a 5 Star restaurant.  The dogs are good. Thats it, good.  The staff and functionality of the restaurant, however, was not. Plus, they charged me for an extra order of fries! Hey! My 20 month old can't eat two orders of fries!

I ate at Ted's for lunch on Sunday with my wife.  We both got the Jumbo All Beef dog with all the toppings (Catsup, Mustard, Onions, Relish, and a Pickle)... The problem was, while in line for only 5 minutes the staff managed to screw up 3 different orders.  That was like 40% screw up!  They were not apologetic, and the customers were getting irate!  This isn't the atmosphere I look for when eating lunch.  Irate customers and hasty cooks are not a good combo.  The onion rings were just a knot of messy fried mystery.  Don't get me wrong, I ate them!

Unfortunately, I can't give this place more than 3 stars.  And with this review I will be buying a handgun for protection.

I'm told that E. Carson St. in the South Side of Pittsburgh has one of the highest concentrations of bars per block in the country, and I can definitely believe it.  But while E. Carson St. itself is home to a plethora of sports-, beer-, and dive-bars as well as any combination thereof, which attract locals and tourist alike, the South Side side streets (try saying that 5 times fast...especially if you have the slightest of lisps - like me :) ) contain more than their share of hidden gems.

One such bar is Jekyl & Hyde.  From the decor to the beer selection, this establishment could not be more faithful to its terrifically terrifying theme.

The exterior is that of a haunted castle, complete with a [presumably] empty suit of armor guarding the front gate/door.  Once inside, you're assaulted by skeletal remains, ghoulish rubber heads, and spiderwebs on all sides.  But in a good way (especially if you're an avid Horror movie fan).

A chalkboard lists upcoming events such as karaoke nights, live music (some of which I was fortunate enough to witness and was extremely impressed by), and free pool night.  The bar and tables are lined with flyers listing appropriately named specialty mixed drinks.  They also have an excellent beer selection, due largely to microbrewers' penchants for scary names for beers and J&H's proclivity to stock such beers.

The night that I came (largely due to my Welsh bladder and the need to use their restroom) their bartender was attentive, fun, and easygoing. The music, both live and from the jukebox, was entertaining, but what really set this bar apart from any bar I've been to -  was its faithful following of its frightful theme. 

Staring around me at the assortment of people around me, my lungs slightly sore from belting out to Rock Band, my eyes itching from my brother's cigarette smoke, and my hands cold from my bottomless mug of water (which the bartender was on point at continuing to refill) - I couldn't help but sigh in perfect contentment.

In the inception of my Yelping I was giving away five star reviews like U of A was giving away TD's to ASU!  I am now learning that four stars is now my high score unless I am totally blown away and is why I am updating my review.  Yin's Chinese Restaurant is a throw back.  Their interior decor is a bit dated but adds to the ambience of the experience.  This little gem is family owned and always prefer it to a corporate spot at all costs.  The most important this about Yin's is the customer service followed but the delicious menu and topped off by the cost!  Big Bang for the buck here.  The valley has changed throughout the times but when I lived in this area in the early 90's it was really nice.  Do not let the area scare you off by giving them a chance.  Support this Mom and Pop's establishment to ensure we don't lose another.

Life's funny. 

Not HaHa funny. Just funny how you can go back to the same restaurant fifteen months later and end up ordering the exact same meal, though not intentionally. LOL

We came to the Blue Burrito after a movie in January, 2012. The only reason I know that is the Tip I wrote on Yelp:

"Make your own burrito bowl $7.99, Chicken Torta $7.99 and one ice tea came to $19.59. A very tasty meal and a great deal!"

Not a lot has changed since then. The above meal ran us $15.25 this time. The Chicken Rice Bowl was reduced to $6.59. The food was okay just nothing special. 

The photos of the Chicken Torta on the menu look good, but for some reason they do not toast it as they show in picture. The bottom piece of bread is soggy and beaks apart. It's impossible to pickup.

Till next time then.

Sorry!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 36/100

Beautiful hotel! Probably the nicest one I had visited this weekend, other than THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. It was a vintage, regal and expensive look to it. I have not stayed here, but I was really impressed by my visit this past weekend and would love to return.

LOCATION:
Excellent. Right in the middle of the strip for easy access all over

EXTERIOR:
Beautiful. Especially the beautiful lake in the front which gives it a little bit of distance from the actual street

INTERIOR:
Like I said earlier - regal, fancy, stunning
Entryway has beautiful glass flowers all over the ceiling

SHOPS:
Not too many. Most were very high end stores such as Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Louis Vuitton, etc. More eye candy, but they definitely match the expensiveness of this hotel!

WHAT TO SEE:
Flowers in the entryway
Window shop in the expensive designer stores
Conservatory & botanical gardens (decorated every season!)
Jean Philippe patisserie - home to the "world's largest chocolate fountain"
The famous water fountains out front! Shows either every 15 or 30 min. depending on day/time

I would love to stay at the Bellagio if I could afford it. I think I was expecting the Paris hotel to look more along the lines of Bellagio. Kinda disappointed over there...BUT Bellagio was simply beautiful!

An exclusive restaurant in a restaurant serving outstanding teppanyaki.

No knife juggling.  No onion volcano spewing fire.  No shrimp tails flying through the air.  This is about modern Japanese teppanyaki made with the freshest, highest quality, visually stunning ingredients.  No "ugly" produce; a perfectly formed, evenly colored eggplant, baby bok choy with no holes in the leaves, you get the idea.

To start, the spicy octopus is incredible.  Lightly grilled with slivered jalapeno peppers, sweet, spicy, tender.  Borrowing from the menu of barMasa, the otoro with osetra caviar, absolutely phenomenal, the salty, brininess of the caviar enhancing the fatty fish.

Australian wagyu for mains.  Two cuts (fillet or rib eye), both approaching A4 quality.  The fillet is well trimmed, the rib eye, less so,  If you like to savor the fat around the edge of your steak, this cut is for you.  Tender, juicy, cooked to temperature, served with a spicy cilantro verde that brightens and intensifies the sweetness of the beef and a spicy red chili and soy that brings out the savory, beefy flavor.

For sides, it's hard to pass the maitake with truffle butter.  An umame explosion that works well with the beef.

Finally, the wagyu fried rice (a filler) is different and over the top.  Black and red rice are combined to create a nuttier flavor.  Fat from the wagyu adds richness, onions sweetness. 

Service is excellent with two servers assisting a single table.  

The restaurant shares the same outstanding sake list as barMasa.  Vegas resort pricing.

While not up to the standards of Michelin rated teppanyaki restaurants of Tokyo, Tetsu delivers a solid, authentic experience at a far more reasonable price.

Located between Binions and the Golden Nugget on four blocks of downtown Las Vegas is one of best marketing efforts this part of town has enjoyed in decades ... the Fremont Street Experience.

Fremont Street is covered in a long canopy called Viva Vision with 12 million lights and 550,000 watts of sound entertaining tourists with short free light and music shows every evening on the hour.

Current Schedule (Changes regularly)
  7:00 pm: American Freedom 2 (Fri/Sat. only)
  8:00 pm: Heart - Crazy on Vegas
  9:00 pm: Bon Jovi - Wanted in Vegas
10:00 pm: The Who - Miles over Vegas
11:00 pm: The Doors - Strange Days
12:00 am: JVH - Signs of Life
  1:00 am: A Tribute to Queen (Fri/Sat. only)

Along Fremont Street, you'll find 10 classic (old) casinos with dozens of restaurants and lots of cheap gambling opportunities compared to most casinos on the Las Vegas Strip. This historic street is where gaming began in Nevada in 1931 besides being the first paved street in the city or first street with a traffic light.

The Fremont Street Experience began in 1995 with the closure of the street to form a 7-block outdoor mall. It was obviously enhanced with Viva Vision 10 years ago.  What's next? Who knows .. a holographic Elvis, Michael Jackson, and Frank Sinatra trio?

When you bore of the fun options on the LV Strip, simply want to enjoy some free entertainment, or need to find a casino with lower minimum tables and slot machines, then Fremont Street Experience is waiting in historic downtown Las Vegas, Nevada.

This is a nice Costco, that doesn't seem to be as busy as the North Hayden location.

The Costco model is simple enough to understand.  Whatever they pay, you pay that price, plus 14%.  How's simple is that?  If you choose to be an Executive Member ($110), over the $55 a year Gold Star (individual), you receive another 2% as a rebate at the end of the year.  We have been members of both over the last twenty years, depending if we are going to make a large purchase.  BTW, you can switch to Executive at any time.  Just pay the extra $55.00 at Customer Service.

Granted both Costco and Sam's Club (Walmart) are competing for the same customers.  My experience has been that you are usually a fan and dedicate to your Wholesale Club over another.  Though members of BJs back east are the most fanatical.  I have found, that you will also believe to your last breath, as Yelp'er Andre E says, that your Club has: " Great Deals....clean aisles.....Great Service....reliable products....Great customer Service."  It's almost takes on an religious article of faith!

All of Costco's Kirkland brand products are execellant.  I have found their Wine section to be unparalleled.   In the past Costco has sued various States to get the lowest price for it's Members. 

BTW, I try coming only during off hours. This helps to minimize the nonsense that Yelp'er Marisa S wrote about that goes on in the parking lot.  Sadly, civility tends to go out the window when you are looking for a parking space.  Just watch any Seinfield episode. LOL

Currently, Tuesdays @ 10:30 or 11 am seem to be the best time.  I just take an early lunch.

Enjoy, and drive carefully!

Always Time For a Coffee Stop!

SITREP

I was in a rush.  Not a RUSH rush.  But a RuSH to get situated at my gate since boarding was to start happening in 10 minutes.  

THE SETUP

I like to give myself some buffer time when standing in line at an eatery/coffee shop because you never know really how long they will take to get your order done - I certainly didn't need a repeat of my Nathan's burger situation at McCarran airport in Las Vegas where my "5 minutes" (as clearly annunciated by them in the King's English) turned into 25 mins w/ a large side of attitude from the 2 staff there.

In addition, when given the chance, I like to try a different coffee branding (other than my go-to "Starbucks") that I may not have tried before, and that also looks inviting.

SPEEDY

Luckily, Cartel was smooth sailing with getting my large mocha-to-go for my Southwest flight back to Sacramento.  AND they did my Mocha as a sugar-free option, which I appreciate.

ON PRINCIPLE

However, whether here, or Starbucks, or Peets, or a fast food place, etc., I get really torqued for any shop that charges nearly $5 for a mocha that I should - and do - get for between $3-$4 at a non-airport location. 

Please note:  just because you (inset business name) are at an airport location 
doesn't justify nor support the business metrics for overcharging customers.  

This is along the GOUGING you see at the Coachella Music Festival charging $6 for a tiny bottle of water or a Movie Theater charging $6 for a medium soda.  Somehow the notion came along that "Trapped Audience = Demographic to Abuse".  I'll never accept that.

therefore, this is a minus one-star whomever the over-charging business is, just to be clear.

THE LOWDOWN

A great coffee stop in Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport!

Consistently outstanding Sapporo ramen 5200 miles from the source! (If it doesn't sound far think of it as a minimum of two layovers and 16 hours flying.  Bam!)

Sora is simplicity at its best:

- One bowl of perfectly cooked, slightly chewy ramen.

- Two choices of  flavorful broth (salt or miso).

- Three topping combinations:  basic (excellent chashu, soft boiled egg, and veg), Sapporo  (basic plus butter and corn),  or "American"  (basic with three times more chashu and/or nori).  

- Like it spicy?  Add a Thai garlic chili paste.

- Sides?  OK fried rice, OK chashu bits on rice, OK curry on rice, Good but oily gyoza. (NO TONKATSU)

Efficient service.  It's Japanese fast food after all.

Pushing the limit for Vegas cheap eats at around $9.00 a bowl but well worth it for the quality and uniqueness.  Try it soon.  It might not be so great when its 110 outside.

After a long and tumultuous affair with Buffalo Exchange (first visit, circa 1993), I've had it with them. I brought a bunch of OK stuff (neatly folded, clean, and wrinkle-free) in a laundry basket as well as a couple of worn but still very desirable and in fashion Tory Burch shoes. As soon as I saw the overweight rockabilly chick doing the buying, I knew I was screwed. Those girls, with the dyed black hair, Bettie bangs, red lipstick, and loss of sense of time, are universally angry and aggro.

Rockabilly went through all my shit and proceeded to wad it up into crumpled balls after she pissed on it as being too uncool or from the wrong store or whatever. She put her powdered nose waaay up in the air over the Tory Burch's, sniffing that they had soooo many already for sale. OK, I didn't see a single pair, but I did see all kinds of nasty Target and Old Navy items that would have probably been more appropriate for a Maryvale garage sale. I didn't even find a single thing that maybe I would consider trying on. Garbage.

So I go to the counter to get my ID back and collect my cash and I am so pissed that all the rejected stuff was now wrinkled all to hell. They gave me something like $80 for the stuff they deigned to take and they had to write me a check. Really? You don't have $80 in cash in the register? The giggling dingbat behind the counter said she had to find the manager to sign said check. While she's gone, I'm steaming and am ready to ask to speak to said manager about the shoddy way the rejects were tossed back into the laundry basket....

....but the manager turned out to be Rockabilly.

Sigh.

So instead, pointing to the basket, I suggested to the Giggler that, should they ever have, like, a staff meeting, maybe they should discuss taking the extra three seconds to fold someone's things to resemble their original condition. She giggled and handed my check over and acted as if I hadn't said a word.

Unbelievable.

I don't care how young you are, how punk rock you think you are, or how badass you think you are. You treat your customers like CUSTOMERS.

Bye-bye, Buffalo... it's been a long and painful road.

The year: 2010.
  
The episode: "Phoenix."

The Man: Adam Richman, himself.

The Challenge: Chompie's "The Ultimate Slider Challenge."

...12 Original Jewish Sliders: each one brisket-filled and gravy-drizzled, stacked as well with mini potato pancakes, Jack cheese, and onion strings.  Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.  Instead, I ordered the Combo.  And after tearing through an incredibly tasty two, alongside a cup of Matzo Ball soup, I was full.  Adam, however, he Manned-up!  Sadly, though, after a hard-fought battle, he--as many have before him--ultimately threw in the towel. The Challenge, it seemed, proved too hefty.  Food had won.

...However, if one, brave soul decides to accept this heaping challenge ($39.95) and conquers this plattered beast, it's free.  But not only that: upon winning, you will be forever immortalized on Chompie's "Hall of Fame" website (http://chompies.com/wall-of-fame/) and an "Ultimate Slider Challenge" T-shirt awaits you and your bragging self!! You bad!!  (By the way, there's no California representation on that website, zero, none, not one, nada...  Who'll step up?

This having been my first time to Chompie's, I was truly impressed!  A Yelp check-in offer allowed for a free bagel from their awesome deli/bakery; our very cool server, Trudy, brought out a few, free cookie samples for this first-timer; and our just-as-cool host made lunch suggestions, which we ordered verbatim.  As promised, those Sliders were "deli-icious."  And the Matzo Ball and Chicken soup hit the spot.  But I couldn't leave...not yet.  As full as I was, I couldn't head back to CA without first trying the carrot cake, could I?  I mean, you don't blame me, right?

So, "Man vs Food"...  That takes care of Phoenix: Alice Cooper'stown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/alice-cooperstown-phoenix?hrid=esDZwjuGZQlkpKrZAC_guQ), Los Reyes de la Torta (http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-reyes-de-la-torta-phoenix-2?hrid=nJiqRCfTtxs2bIoFrPdmkA), and now Chompie's.  On deck, LA.

"SAKE SAKE BOOM BOOM !
SAKE SAKE BOOM BOOM !"

Oh, not right now? Well, if you had a fun group like we did and everyone was doing sake bombs then that is what you would be chanting before you take your group shot. Remember to out-do any groups surrounding you.. That's what we tried to do. Tip: Try their pomegranate one ;)

I have been here before when it was Geisha House and it did NOT impress me so I am glad that it is now Kanji. If you have never tried teppanyaki before then I suggest trying it here so you can see it done right.

The staff is attentive, hilarious, and will drink with you. 
Pro Tip: Do the Ji Shot (thank me later).

My favorite starter was the Beef Tataki, great presentation and tasted amazing. The egg rolls and shrimp tempura were also ordered and shared amongst all of us. 

Our teppan chef was Joshua, who was very skilled and entertaining. He kept our group cracking up the whole time he was cooking our food on the iron griddle. Thanks for giving us food shaped as a big heart, Spongebob, flowers, and all the other things you came up with during the cooking process! It was all so delicious, especially the steak.

I will be back for more and to try out the Green Tea Cheesecake that I was too full to order!

If you're visiting you should know the inmates booking number and the only things you can bring with you are a key and an ID.  Also, visiting is over a black and white monitor and phone, no more in person visits.

The ideal candidate for a job with the jail is highly insecure.  The MSCO remedies this insecurity by giving them a badge on their uniform and control over a small population of people who have already been stripped of any rights or privileges- basically powerless.  When you give sad people like that any kind of power, they automatically abuse it because they don't get any respect in their pathetic real lives.

Unfortunately, when you visit someone in jail, you have to interact with these mental midgets.  I've been here to visit someone and they didn't know if they could accept a passport as acceptable identification.  A group of them had to huddle together and weigh in on it before they decided a government issued identification was acceptable.  Another time I came, they said they couldn't let me in because they couldn't find me in their "system" which I thought was a good thing.

Most recently though, the Chaplin made a special arrangement for me to see my brother in person when our father passed away.  I didn't ask, he offered.  On my way to the jail I prepared myself for some type of hullabaloo with the dum dums running the visitors station.  Sure enough, as soon as I told them the Chaplin sent me they informed me that the Chaplin doesn't run the Maricopa county sheriffs office.  I reminded him that I never suggested anything as ridiculous as the Chaplin running the sheriffs office but merely that he called me and told me to come see my brother.  After about 20 minutes of talking as slow as possible to 5 different detention officers, I gave up and walked out. It's like they all share one brain and the brain calls in sick all the time.

Low expectations. That's what I had when we stopped to have a bite before a movie. Not a big fan of deep dish, we were delighted to see "flat bread" pizzas offered. The sausage pizza, while could have been crunchier, was quite good. Service was great considering our friend was so dehydrated from being overserved the previous evening, he must have had a dozen ice tea refills. 

The ambience at these places kills me. It's like Oregano's married Cracker Barrel! There is crap all over the walls. Hey. Who's dusting this stuff anyway. I did notice quite a bit of dust and grease on the light fixture above our table. 

We attempted to try the pizza place a few doors away, but they were closed. I suggested Hooter's but before I finished saying it, we all squealed in all of our gayness...."Ewww...boobies!". So Uno it was. 

But I couldn't help think of that card game Uno. Damn that's a fun game. And I also couldn't get a guy from high school outta my head. His nickname was Uno. He got it one day in the locker room after gym class. You figure it out. 

I'll go again if I'm ever at the AZ Center. I just might bring my Windex and Endust however.

Old school yo!

We're talking salad bar with beets, sunflower seeds and cottage cheese yo!

We're talking prime rib of Flintstonian proportions! 

I met a group of good friends here recently. We were seated in a back (non window) room and my claustrophobia almost got the best of me. It was a pretty tiny room. Soon I decided it wasn't tiny. It was cozy. And soon the Coronas were a- comin' and the conversation was flowing.

Our server, a delightful woman, was efficient and friendly. And a shout out to her just for handling a group of a dozen or so yelpers! Can you imagine waiting on us lol!?!?

My prime rib and baked potato were pure perfection. The salad bar was fresh and fully loaded. 

Much like myself towards the end of the evening.

The decor is all muraled-out if memory serves me. So there's a lot going on! 

So Feeney's you got a new fan! Great place to take my folks, out of towners or anyone I think is worthy of the Feeney charm!!!

I just can't.

I can't write about the amazing po' boys. The glorious boudin. The succulent fried green tomatoes. I especially can't write about the to-die-for peach cobbler a la mode.

I can't write about it because I can't eat it anymore. I'm a little verklempt, please give me a moment...

Ahem. Okay, that's better.

Try the gumbo if you want to live dangerously, it's spicy! And the crawfish boil is one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten, if also one of the messiest.

Go and eat all of the things. When you do, please have a shrimp po' boy for me.

I'll just be over here, hoping for a miracle drug that allows me to ingest gluten. If that dream ever becomes a reality, Flavors of Louisiana will definitely be my first stop.

UPDATE: I received the following message from the owner:

Hi Beth, Man do i have good news for you. We have a lot of Gluten free items on our menu!!! Yes i was a nurse for 25 years before opening my restaurant and Celiac disease was just becoming a known thing. So we can blacken any of our meats for you with our gluten free blackening seasoning. Also we fry in a mixture of corn meal and corn flour so no wheat flour goes in it. Just ask for your fried foods to be done in the cornmeal mixture instead of the flour. We have french fries, cajun chips, potato salad, cole slaw, dirty rice and red beans are all gluten free. Also if you come on Monday we have our Jambalaya and that is gluten free as well. So come on back and let us feed you some good and i mean real good gluten free food!!

3.5 STARS

What makes MGM Grand so GRAND?!?!
Is it because the building and all it's splendor is emerald green?
Is it because the gold gigantic lion out front can be spotted a mile away?
Is it because there is some connection to the Wizard of Oz?
Is it because they hold boxing matches here? 
Is it because they are the head company that pretty much owns a couple other casinos down the Las Vegas Strip?!

I remember staying at the MGM when I was younger and had some fam bam trips to Vegas. The rooms were decent and filled with your typical amenities of a hotel room. I think the rooms are much better in quality compared to Luxor & Excalibur. When I stayed at the MGM, the Skylofts & The Signature (luxury boutique hotel rooms) were not built yet. But nonetheless, a decent stay at the regular rooms. 

RESTAURANTS
[SUPER SWANKY]
* Joel Robuchon (French - 3 Michelin Stars)
* L' atelier de Joel Robuchon (4 Michelin Stars)
* Tom Colicchio's craft steak (For all you carniwhores & Top Chef fans!)  

[SWANKY]
* Diego Mexican Cuisine
* Emeril's New Orleans Fish House
* Fiamma Trattoria & Bar
* Nob Hill Tavern (Michael Mina)
* Pearl (Chinese)
* Sea Blue (Michael Mina; currently renovating and will open 2013)
* Shibuya (Japanese)
* Wolfgang Puck
* MGM Grand Buffet
* 'Wichcraft (Tom Colicchio's Sammie shop; not as swanky as the others)

PARTY ROCKERS & PRE-PARTY HOT SPOTS
* Hakkasan Nightclub(debut 2013)
* Tabu Nightclub
* Wet Republic Ultra Pool
* Centrifuge (crafty cocktails)
* Rouge Bar
* Zuri Bar
* West Wing Bar

ENTERTAINMENT
* Brad Garrett's Comedy Club
* Hollywood Theater
* David Copperfield
* Ka Cirque Du Soleil
* Boxing matches at MGM Grand
* Concerts at MGM Grand Garden Arena
* Conference Center and Ballrooms (on the other side of the casino)

Given this laundry list of items, you can imagine how large this casino would be! It took me a good 30 minutes to get to the conference center as it is located on the opposite side of the casino! The food catered at the conference center was quite upscale and top notch! Consider it 100x better than what the Holiday Inn would serve you in a banquet! I wouldn't mind coming back to the MGM for a conference nor staying at the hotel. It's pretty decent if you're looking for something in the middle of the strip.

If I lived here I would probably be dead in a year. LOL! Walk the strip and view the freak show that is AMURRICA!

Sure, when in Vegas it's almost mandatory to take a walk on The Strip to view the sights. To me it's always better at night when everything is lit up in all it's cheesy glory! Plus, if there during the summer season walking The Strip in the day is inviting heat stroke! Damn, it's hot over here. 

Don't get fooled by the optical illusion thinking that the casino you want to walk to is close as after shlepping a half hour you realize you should have taken a cab, the monorail, or the shuttle that runs along The Strip. Still, the views of the massive casinos all lit up and the free shows make it worth a trek up and down The Strip. The Pirate Show at Treasure Island, the Volcano at the Mirage, the Dancing Waters at the Bellagio to name a few.

Hey, at least you are allowed to drink in public here so load up a cold one and have at it as you walk by the hordes of tourists, Eurotrash, bachelor and bachelorette parties, and assorted middle America white trash WalMart crowd that seems to gather here. Don't forget to view the crazies, homeless, porn card slappers, bad street performers, drunk blotto people, and those annoying characters in knock off costumes posing for money. The craziness never ends! It's almost like being in Times Square NYC!

The Las Vegas Strip is an amusement park of kitschy weirdness in itself. I love cheesy and approve totally!

Guys, do you have a problem approaching beautiful women?  Afraid of rejection?  No idea how to start a conversation without cheezy pickup lines?  Maybe you need to feel like a man again after being beaten down at the office or just want to feel like a 10 when ladies at the club call you a six?  Two words gents, Caf Teaze.

For less than half of what it cost for a dance, you can have all that plus a great milk tea.

To be clear, this is NOT a strip club!  Just a bunch of Asian ladies prancing around in their underwear doing everyday things.  You know, like serving tea and making conversation. Normal stuff.

About the conversations, it's slightly deeper than what you expect at the Rhino or Sapphire ("Where you from?  Really?  Me too!") but not by much.  They are however, experts at stroking your ego.  (Stop it, it's not a euphemism).

Before you go all sexist on me, I respect the servers for doing what they need to, to make a living. Tips, from what I gave, must be good and if you got it, use it.

Am I a fan of the concept?  No.  It reminds me of the countless bars in Shibuya Japan staffed by beautiful women who, for a metered rate, talk men into feeling better about themselves.  I guess it's cheaper than a shrink.  To each his own.

Almost forgot, the teas are good.  Brews are strong, especially the flavored teas (the Passion fruit black tea borders on bitter).  Milk teas can be ordered hot or cold.  Good ratio of tea to "milk".  Boba is well cooked.  tender throughout.  The hot taro milk tea is excellent.

I take the fifth and refuse to say anymore after all, what happens in Vegas...

Chiploplo, Chipoodle, Chipotopolay

Looking for a pre-show meal, we saw the nearby choices of A)McDonald's, B)Panda Express or C)Chipotle.  Considering I don't like McDonald's, Panda Express is on my usual restaurant rotation & I haven't had Chipotle in a few years, the time was ripe to give Chipotle another go.

My choice - the barbacoa bowl.  

My 2 cents - It was..........how do I put this?  Boring.  Boring like the scene in "Ferris Beuller's Day Off" where Ben Stein is going "Anyone..........?  Anyone.........? Beuller........?Beuller.........?"  Boring like having a CSPAN viewing party on Valentine's Day.  Nothing says "sexytime" than Senate hearings in HD;p

Now, it wasn't bad, per se.  It's just, as I get older, I want my tastebuds to be titillated!  (I just said "titillated" *giggle*)  The portions were good.  The price was reasonable.  Also, kudos to the staff for efficiently moving the big Las Vegas line along.  Wait was minimal.  To me, I'd rather go to a local taqueria for some authentic and cheap fare, w/o the line of hipsters, Beliebers and Twi-hards.  

Chipotle is situated in a primo location to lure in the tourists.  The restaurant was clean and the staff knows how to handle the crowds coming in for sustenance, like me.  

Chipotle has it's fans, and more power to them for liking what they like.  I may return if I'm walking by, the next time I'm in Vegas.  It's convenient and the prices are reasonable, considering the dining options in the casinos.

I'm with Barry W.  Housekeeping: you need to get your act together because when I checked into my suite today, I was mortified.  You should be too.

Refer to my pics.  I  called for the Executive Manager of Housekeeping, who arrived with two other staff members.  It took no fewer than seven phone calls because apparently there was also a technical difficulty with my telephone.  Read:  my phone was busted.  

Upon their arrival, I showed them the disaster zone and  they agreed that the wet bar was filthy and in a whispered conference in the bedroom made the decision to change my room.  

Brilliant.  

I then had to wait around for Bell Service to transfer my luggage (and by now, the germaphobia and revulsion for the state of my room was joined by frust-arvation).  

Housekeeping professionals tsk-tsked and continued their hushed conference in the bedroom area, while I paced.  They advised that had I any further concerns, I should contact Casino Services.  Which I did.

FD:  "Front Desk, how may I be of service?"
KD:  "Hi.  I have to change rooms because of unsanitary conditions and I would like to know what your protocol is to accommodate guests for the inconvenience."
FD:  "We change you to another room."
KD:  "Okaaay... My particular situation was extreme, and I'm just following up as Housekeeping suggested-"
FD:  "Ma'am, are you looking for compensation?"
KD:  "What?"
FD:  "I can offer you a $50 food credit."
KD:  "Uh, I'm pretty sure there was more than $50 worth of food scattered about my wet bar when I checked in.  If this is how you keep the rooms, where I can see everything, what makes you think I want to eat in your restaurants?"
FD:  "Ma'am, I can give you the $50 food credit, take it or leave it."
KD:  "Alrighteee, then.  Thanks."

I did speak to Ms. Shum, Assistant Front Desk Manager who was attentive, gracious, and glanced at the pictures I'd taken before settling on a more appropriate gesture for the inconvenience caused by the negligent Housekeeping Staff.

She gave me her card and was rather professional about the incident.

I continue to have requests to engineering get "lost in the ether" for an hour... my follow up call resulted in me holding in excess of five minutes and then being asked to hold again.  I told the Front Desk Rep that 90 seconds is the ceiling in a Hospitality Setting where you can respectfully ask for your guest to wait.  Beyond that, you get back on the line, inform them that you will track down the answer and contact them.  

I'm stranded on Incompetence Island in a 950 sqft Suite of Despair.  

Send help.

Today I had an appointment for a "cake tasting" (for the wedding) with Julia Baker Confections.  I had no expectations going in and didn't really think too much about a cake at all prior to today.  I didn't do any research, I just went with the flow.  Jared opted not to participate, so it was just me, my mom, and our wedding planner.  

I was super impressed from the moment i set foot in Julia's office.  Not only did Julia herself greet us at the door, but the cakes on display were like pieces of art!  I learned about her business as I admired the cake creations and luxury chocolates that surrounded me.  Not only was everything incredibly breathtaking to look at, but I didn't take one bite of anything that I didn't absolutely love!

(Yes - the wedding diet was on hiatus during my visit with Julia today!)

I sampled the passion fruit chocolate and it was amazing.  My mom commented that the caramel truffle she chose was like an orgasm in her mouth!  Then it was on to the cakes: we had the white traditional cake with raspberry gelee and swiss meringue buttercream filling and american buttercream frosting, the chocolate cake with chocolate ganache filling and chocolate ganache frosting, and the red velvet cake with sweet cream cheese filling and american buttercream frosting.  OMG - divine!  All of it! (And I don't even consider myself a 'cake person.')

I won't say which one my favorite was but I will say that Jared loved the same one I did when I brought him samples later in the day.  Our guests are in for a real treat...

Since our meeting, I did some research only to learn that Julia's sweet creations have garnered her notoriety as the "Chocolatier to the Stars" and singer/songwriter Alicia Keys has called Julia "breathtakingly talented." Among the many celebrities Julia has made chocolates for are Bono & U2, Paris Hilton, Jennifer Aniston, and Britney Spears.  None of this surprises me, other than not understanding how Julia keeps her girlish figure while she's surrounded by sugar and amazing fresh ingredients 24/7!

I am so excited for Julia to create our wedding cake!  If you're looking for a custom creation made with passion, check out Julia Baker Confections.

Clever name, a take on the sub-genre of Western films, except with a "y" at the end. Possibly to sound more "Americanized", like they did when changing the spelling of the last names when immigrants arrived through Ellis Island. The menu pays homage to the old films with sandwiches named after them, like "Hang 'Em High" and the "Magnificent Seven". 

Greeted at the door by Andrea, he immediatley started telling me all about the meats and cheeses in the deli case. A thick Italian accent, and a very enthusiastic sales pitch, we started talking about where he is from in Northern Italy, he went on to tell me all about his products in the store. The place is small, but they have a pretty extensive menu. 

 One of my favorite things in life is a charcuterie and a cheese board, complete with a glass of wine. I now have this in my neighborhood. Pretty large selection of imported Italian cheese as well as imported cold cuts like: speck, prosciutto crudo, soppressata, mortadella and your usual salami and pastrami. The cheese is what really peaked my interest, the gorgonzola was off the charts delicious. A strong bite, this is not your usual gorgonzola that we are used to. Fontina and Asiago rounded up my tasting. 

They have an assortment of pastas, some made in house, some imported from Italy (they are frozen) as well as house favorites like eggplant parm and steak milanese. Also available are some housemade desserts (try the Tiramisu, it was fantastic) as well as imported Bindi Cakes. They do have beer and wine available as well. They offer seasonal specials, like rice arancini, which I will definitely come back to try. Andrea said they do cater, and they also offer cheese/cold cut trays. 

This is a true Italian Deli, don't come in looking for a turkey sandwich and complain that they don't have it. It's not Subway. "Whattsa matta you"!

$80 Yoroi Menu:

Grape Sake Cocktail
Jack Mackerel in Sweet Vinegar
Sashimi Course:  Bluefin Tuna (Spain,) Ocean Trout (Scotland,) Jack Mackerel, Young Yellowtail (Japan), 3-year aged Soy
Grilled Course:  Spanish Mackerel with Miso, Kobe Beef with Kumquat, Flying Fish with Salt
Sushi:  Deep Sea Porgy, Yellow Grouper, Cornet, King Yellowtail, Triangle, Sea Urchin over Salmon Roe, Sea Eel, Sweet Omelet
Toro Handroll
Fish Miso Soup
Matcha
Green Tea Cocoa Cake
Strawberry Layer Cake

The main event of the evening, a seat at Gen-san's easily missed Kabuto, finally arrived and true to the rumors the $80 Yoroi Menu would not disappoint; easily the best deal on fresh sushi in the Vegas area and, with a focus on edomae-sushi plus fish arriving 4-7x per week from Japan (depending on demand,) a truly authentic experience in a city where 'authenticity' is generally questionable at best.

All clean lines and zen, blonde woods and flowers, a small slit window at the entrance and a couple of tables the action here is clearly a seat at the sushi bar and placing oneself in the hands of the itamae in order to bear witness to the incredible knife skills as piece after piece of fish arrives perfect and smooth, the rice fragrant and warm, with ample description of province and the occasional anecdote.  Featuring fresh wasabi, house-made aged soy and creamy miso, plus an extensive sake list and dessert program responsible for the best mille crepe I've had to date my only regret in visiting Kabuto is that I did not book an earlier reservation and order the longer menu; a mistake I'll not make in the future.

Retro chic from the bygone era of American classic films collides with reinvented American cuisine to create an interesting; ummm unique; ok, different, dining adventure.

The food sounds familiar but the updated approach to their preparation is not.  Sometimes, grandmas recipes can be improved upon but sometimes its best to leave a classic alone.

The seared foie with a vanilla French toast and cherry chutney is perfectly balanced and delicious.  Use the toast to mop up the foie fat and wow, the flavors are sublime.  Successful reinvention!  Then there is the steak tartare with a lemon crme fraiche and an olive tepenade that mask the raw beef flavor and instead heighten the metallic flavor. Eek.

For mains, top props to the fried free range chicken drizzled with a honey-sherry glaze.  Juicy, crispy, and a finger licking good sweet / acidic glaze.  The crispy Korean style pork belly is OK.  The accompanying kimchee fried rice is not.  Flat flavor and oily.

Finally, the steaks, the servers claim their prime but they are definitely not top prime or well aged.  A little tough.  A little lacking in beefy goodness. 

Service is very good.

Nice selection of wines.  The 50 under $50 list is well chosen and offers some good value.  The Captains List has some great finds if you are willing to look but the lack of organization and obscene overpricing of top wines make it hard for any connoisseur to take seriously ('00 Mouton $2900 [$1200 over retail], '00 Lafite $5800 [$3300 over retail]).

The Barrymore fills the void, providing a Strip like, exclusive dining experience without the Strip prices or hassle.  Is it worth it?  That's for you to decide.

I have had chicken. I have had waffles. And now, I've had chicken AND waffles. 

Prior to today, I didn't realize the distinction. Prior to today, I never had cause to consider the combination. Prior to today, I didn't realize what I was missing.

Now let's be clear: this isn't the place for dieters. It's not a place for any pretentious behavior. The place has "Chicken & Waffles" in the name, OK? And that's what you're going to get. In abundance.

Cheap as hell. I had the #1, also known as KK's. Three huge-ass pieces of chicken -- breas, thigh and mutant leg. All battered and fried to perfection. Two waffles the size of Vermont. A bucket of grits with some egg/cheese/onion concoction on the side. OK, I could have done without the last part. But hey, when in a chicken & waffle place...

I'm still full. I won't eat dinner tonight. I crashed out for an hour in post-prandial bliss. And I'd have typed this review faster if I could have stopped sucking my fingers like a four-year-old.

Damn.

Skip the primi, dive into the secondi.  Scarpetta excels at pasta.

While it is true, a recent trip to Italy has forever altered my perception of Italian food (the reason for the loss of a star), Scarpetta delivers with an Italian chic dcor, light spirited service, contemporary plating, and Italian cooking sensibility.

Straight to the pastas.  Plated as a secondi (second course before the main), portions are smaller.  Do like the Italians, save your bread to mop up the left over sauce once you finish the pasta.  Trust me, do it, you'll understand.

The tagliatelle with a truffle zabaglione and guanciale, a take on carbonara is excellent.  All the flavor of carbonara are there, just lighter. The pasta is toothsome and near perfect.

Duck and foie ravioli.  Thin sheets of translucent pasta around packets of duck and melting foie.  Glazed with a sweet marsala and duck stock reduction.  The sauce is enriched with dribbles of foie fat as the little packets are broken open.

Finally, the spaghetti with tomato and basil is a take on amatriciana.  Simple, fresh pure of tomato, hint of fresh basil.  Clean flavor.

Although I'm happy with two or three pastas, most think I've gone foodie crazy so if you must, the  mains.  The spiced duck breast with endive, preserved orange, and cipollini onions is excellent.  Perfectly rendered, the skin of the rare duck is crisp with no cloying underlying raw fat.  It's earthy, ducky flavor cut by the sauce of preserved orange and duck jus creates a very well balanced dish.  Not to be outdone, the fennel spiced black cod.  Hints of licorice taint the delicate flavor of the cod, the acidity of tomatoes and the briny, salty flavor of olives elevate it.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find the mantecato of baccala the menu promised.  All good, the dish worked.

Great wine list.  Heavy emphasis on Italy.  

Is Scarpetta truly Italian?  No.  (You should still tip your server; I miss Italy).  It does however, deliver a great experience.

"Wait till you try some of MY sauce?" says the chef to two ladies while standing over a pile of rice shaped like a dude's junk (The balls are even sprinkled with black sesame seeds).  Welcome to Musashi.

Great spot to unwind with good teppanyaki prepared by talented, sometimes lewd, chefs in an unpretentious, fun atmosphere.

The classic teppanyaki "show" is almost flawless in execution from years of experience.  Chefs effortlessly carry on a fun conversation while creating very consistently flavored and accurately cooked food.  Something very difficult to find in teppanyaki joints.

Steaks are cooked to temperature and served with eight dipping sauces, many made on the teppan cook top.  Prawns and lobster tails are sweet and cooked right.  Well cooked veg.  Tasty fried rice (no comment about the chef's sauce).

Dinner sets offer the best selection and value with most sets below $35.

Other menu items?  Who knows.  This is a TEPPANYAKI restaurant.  Get your sushi fix elsewhere.

Open till 4am.

Note:  The Travel Channel's "Steak Paradise II" featured Musashi for their use of "imported from Japan Kobe beef".  Since the import ban of 2010 it's  no longer available.

I came & tried to give this place a fair shot but it's really a dud!  Now you pay just a little less than Sweet Tomatoes used to cost, but you only get to go through the salad line once, & you don't even get to put your own dressing on!  Then, remember the selection of 6 soups (& up to 10 at one location in the Valley).  Well, now we're down to 3 soups!  On top of that you have to spend about the same amount again to get an entree unless you want to go somewhere else to eat when you leave here!

In summation:  Poor dining plan, a way high price, & while we're about it, lousy architecture in the newer Field Kitchen locations that are opening in the Valley, of the six.  They're like 3-story high metal barns inside...  or are they airplane hangars?  

What are these people on??     :-O

I can't help it that I'm addicted to sweet potatoes. So that's why I have been gravitating toward Boston Market lately. My two sides are always sweet potatoes, or should I say my main course is the sweet potatoes and the chicken is my side. The food is excellent, although sometimes the chicken can get a little scrawny looking.

My only complaint about this place is that I'm constantly approached by employees to either sign up with my email address or being asked how's my meal. Last time I was in there I was asked how's my meal twice by the same guy and then a manager came by and asked the same thing. I get the touchy feely customer service thing. But PLEASE, dial it down a bit.

There's nothing else like this in Las Vegas and you should go now because who knows if they'll be able to sustain the air of coolness (hope!) it has once everyone knows.  If you combined the whole craft cocktail scene that's emerged in the last few years, off kilter shows like "Absinthe", the lurking human oddity stuff that's popped up at some club spots and the fucking jadedness to the $3k bottle service/fist pump crowd, Rose.Rabbit.Lie is like a culmination of all of this and seems so right for right now.  It's really refreshing!  There was also this whole underlying "Eyes Wide Shut" feel to the whole thing in a good way.   

Thanks to Edwin P, my wife and I were able see the 8pm show of "Vegas Nocturne".  I won't go into any details of the show but I thought it was terrific.  This is what I imagine vaudeville shows were like but with some added modern nuances.  If you liked Absinthe, you will like this.    

We hung out for a while in their "music room" which was fantastic.  I am not sure what genre to technically call the band but it was like an old school New Orleans band with horns playing modern hits.  One of the funniest performers in "Vegas Nocturne" belted out a psycho version of "Blurred Lines" that had everyone on their feet.  There were some really unique performers after her too.  

I had a chance to look at the dinner menu which looked great.  We definitely plan on doing that soon.  Caviar tacos, foie gras, steak and some really interesting dishes I fail to remember due to the cocktails.  Can't wait to go back!

I love going here for lunch!  I have been there several times because it is close to work and I have to get out of the office!  I love the soups here. Just had the vegetable and the ingredients were so fresh.  The salads are also very good.  I have tried the blueberry wrap and that is one of my favorites.  I have heard from the owner that she will even be delivering to office buildings in the area.  This is the best place to go if you like everything fresh.  Perfect vegetarian spot!

Cute! 

If you love funky, exotic, expensive chocolate, this place is a good place to check out. They have these fun, funky chocolate bars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LpJvitnw7vU5UW-3KE9kjA?select=AgIkITFbopwNhh8aTyzBVQ you can find also at Whole Foods and some candy shops: Bacon Chocolate being their most famous i think. I've had it before and it's pretty good salty sweet. 
If i didn't have so many sweet places to hit, i would have liked to have had more time (and MONEY) to try their different truffles. A cool stop at the Forum Shops for a unique chocolate fix.

Vegas reviews= DONE!!! until i go back in sept :)

Buh, whaddaya mean you don't have chocolate cactus? ;p

Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden is a free & worthwile distraction when you want to be away from the Strip for awhile, but still close enough to head back to continue availing yourself of sinful debauchery and/or losing your entire savings account.  

The Cactus Garden greets visitors as they arrive.  When I went, I admittedly wasn't a huge cactus fan.  I dunno - maybe it's the spines, maybe it's the phallic looking Saguaro cactus.  Cactus just wasn't my cup of tea.  Ethel M has an assortment of cacti on display, which I've read are adorned with lights during the Holiday season.  My horticultural buddy, who collects cacti, has given me various fruiting cacti like the Peruvian Apple cactus, which has made me appreciate the hardy & resourceful cactus.  If I were to go back, I would look at the garden with a more loving glance.

The Chocolate Factory is a self-guided tour.  Visitors read the various displays on the voyage of a caocao bean into fancy packaging.  The highlight of course, free samples!  Halfway through the tour, visitors get their choice of sample - milk, dark or white chocolate.  I may have obtained a couple samples via a few well-timed out walkthroughs ;p  The tour ends in the chocolate shop, with the chocolates fetching a pretty hefty price.  Looking for more familiar choices?Then, on the left is.............

M&M's World!  Purveyor of all things M&M.  Lots of cute lil knickknacks for the M&M lover.  I remember seeing a chess set, which is pretty dope.  It was interesting to see all the items available to buy, but nothing that I wanted to take home.  Now, if they had M&M colored nipple stickers, then M&M's World would be in business.  I'm Asian, so they'd be milk chocolate M&M's ;p
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Overall, a cool free place to check out while you're in Vegas.

Recommend!

Carrot Top elicits such a negative knee jerk reaction from so many.  It's like asking people at a pizza joint if they want anchovies.  When was the last time you actually had anchovies??  The guy has been a Vegas headliner since 2005.  There's got to be a reason why he's been able to stick it out on the strip and fill seats in that theater for the long haul while so many headline comedians have come and gone.  One year they're at the Excalibur, then The Plaza and then there's their one way ticket to Laughlin. 

I didn't think I would enjoy the show as much as I did.  He opened the show at a frenetic pace going from prop joke to prop joke.  Didn't think the joke was funny?  No problem!  There's another one in 5 seconds.  It was like watching the biggest 5 year old wise ass with A.D.D. show off his box of toys.  Freakin hilarious!!  The rest of the show was just as great.  You'll definitely laugh a lot and have a fun time unless you don't laugh at cock jokes.  So yeah....eunuchs may be sensitive to Carrot Top. 

We sat in the second to last row.  There's not a bad seat in the house.  You can purchase the cheapest seats without hesitation if you're still skeptical.

Tandoori Times

Volume 1, Issue 1, Number 1.  Limited run.  Copyright 2009, Mejimbo Enterprises.  All Rights Reserved.  

Dateline 7 May 2009
Scottsdale, Arizona

    Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S.  Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, "That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff."

    Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, "I really like the onion naan."  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.

    The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was "...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger."  This has not substantiated, however.

    Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was "Yummy."

    Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.

    An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.

    Jim W's blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; "...ears haven't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.  I really liked the food but I wouldn't go back on a night when they have dancing again."

I'll make it simple.  Come for the food, and stay to shop.  Or, come here to shop, and stay for the food!  Either way, you cannot go wrong!

Their home made Italian sausage sandwich is $6.85 and deliecious; while their equally yummy Chicken Parmigiana sandwich is $7.50. Both are great!  

But if you come, stay & shop in their imported Italian foods section. Their meats & cold cuts are outstanding!!! Try the Capicolla at the deli counter.  It costs only $8.00 for a pound and is much better than the Boars Head brand.  They also have a decent wine selection of Barolos and Chiantis, though a bit pricier than Total Wine or BevMov.

We came here to pickup some Italian delicacies recently and stayed for lunch and glad we did!

Enjoy!

"What would you do if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key."-"With A Little Help From My Friends", Beatles

Beatles LOVE, with seating in the round, so not a bad seat in the house.  It's been showcased on the Strip for a long time now, and still draws the crowds nightly.

We used Tix4Tonight to score some primo seats for cheap.  There's a part of the act where a surpise is brought out to the audience and we happened to be the very last row to participate.  I won't spoil it, but it was fun!

Pre-show, some clowns put on some comic relief by, literally, blowing smoke up people's arses.  Kinda creepy, kinda funny - it was great seeing people's reactions.

The highlights of Beatles LOVE, for me, were the aerialist during "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" & the act featuring "Strawberry Fields Forever".  Very touching.  I didn't care much for the halfpipes and rollerbladers.  Oh, and the music is on blast!  I'm talking loud!  So, just be mindful of that, if you have sensitive hearing.

Overall, a great show worth the money & time while in Vegas!  I highly recommend using Tix4Tonight for purchasing tickets the day before/day of.  Our seats were great & we saved a lot of money.  I'm generally not a Cirque du Soleil fan, but I highly enjoyed this eclectic & colorful show.

"Come on guys" whines my Midwest poker bud as a bowl of soup, with a Flintstone size, sawed open beef bone is set before him; glistening, wobbly bits of bone marrow evident everywhere.   "I need some non Asian friends", almost pouting.  Then silence.

"Hey, let me try..." I start, only to be cut off.

"Get your own" the only reply.

Not your typical Vietnamese eatery, instead an updated approach fusing other Asian flavors and  using ingredients more common in the States.  Hawaii yeeps, think Pig and the Lady done right.  Oh and it's a gastropub.

Lobster pho.  Your typical pho dressed with a whole lobster (it's head sticking out of the bowl).  "Wash out" the head fat into the broth, some sriracha for heat and consume quickly.  The lobster, sweet and perfectly cooked when it first arrives, it rapidly overcooks in the hot broth.  Very complex.  The braised oxtail pho, with its almost gelatinous broth equally good.

Pass on the Vietnamese American crab boil.  Instead try the wok tossed Dungeness crab in tamarind sauce (messy, the sweetness contrast with the tangy tamarind), or the diver scallop sashimi topped with tobiko, Serrano pepper, tomato and onion, mint, and a  tangy citrus soy sauce.  Oceanic candy!

Into clams?  Steamed clams with basil and lemongrass, grilled clams or the stronger flavored razor clams with crushed peanuts and scallion oil, razor clam dressed with a soy truffle infusion topped with Serrano pepper slices, garlic flowers, and chives, with a side green papaya salad, or a spicy (similar to XO flavored), giant, wok cooked surf clam.

Not perfect; the clams border on being over cooked, the "Vietnamese beef carpaccio" cooked from sitting in the citrus soy too long, and the braised pork belly (similar to Japanese kakuni) using coconut water instead of sake, over braised and crumbling.

Casual vibe.  Off Strip, Asian service.  Large selection of reasonably priced beer.

Simply put, intriguing.

Wow. I can't believe I waited this long to check out Postino's. I mean what is wrong with me? It's like why did Liza wait so long to divorce her gay ass husband? Or why did it take so long KFC to come up with grilled chicken? Or why, why did it take so long for The Ghost Whisperer to be canceled? I ask you. Why? WHYYYY!!

Putting that aside I have to say I was UBER impressed with Postino's on every level. I triple love the bar opening up to the intimate patio, the charming, airy and open dining room with the fireplace and cozy vintage sofas. Love it. 

Now let's talk BRUSCHETTA 101! OK. They have nailed it. Nailed it like Levi Johnston nailed Bristol Palin! My faves were the brie and apple and the ricotta with pistachios and dates. The bread is perfectly crunchy on the edge with a soft middle. Kind of like my Uncle Larry but don't tell him I said that. 

We over ordered because we definitely didn't each need our own sandwich. The Niner (I think that's the name) was gigantic and served on delicious focaccia bread...crispy bacon, juicy chicken...so so good. Side salad was, um, interesting. While I appreciate the pine nuts and the cheese I just wasn't feeling the dressing. Kind of sour. 

Not to worry. Nothing could spoil this fabulous foodie rampage. Service, at first a tad slow...was friendly and efficient. 

It won't take me long to return to you Postino's. I want to be a regular so that when I walk in everyone yells THOMAS!!!

The negative reviews on here are pretty hilarious. Do you guys even have any idea what you're actually in the market for when you are shopping for a product? Are these people the same people who complain about a lack of organic vegetables at a Texas BBQ restaurant? Or no top-shelf liquor at the local dive bar? Do you get upset that your Kia doesn't have premium leather seats and doesn't go 0-60 in under 4 seconds?

Fergawdsakes people, this is a Chinese-style, budget massage joint. It's $20/hour. Yes, people are all in the same room, and yes, you'll have to strip down to your underwear and get under the covers in a unisex room (I wonder if the same people freaking about 5 seconds of immodesty are the same ones wearing sexy swimsuits at the Palms or Hard Rock pools in summer). And yeah, maybe your masseur or masseuse doesn't speak English that well (while hipster Yelpers loooove it when no one in the restaurant speaks English; it's apparently a problem when the person with their hands on your back doesn't know the difference between subjunctive and conditional tense).

Trust me folks, I've been to China many times and been to their massage joints. You're getting an authentic and legit experience (well, except here in Vegas no one is smoking in the room). If you don't like it, don't downvote the joint because you're too ignorant to know what you're getting yourself into. Otherwise you're the Yelper who gives the  Indian restaurant one star because "I don't really like Indian food". Can we at least agree that those people suck?

Whoa, I am in heaven. 

A recent review for a place in Chandler made me NEED some Filipino food. Let me back track a few years. 

I worked with a guy who was in charge of hiring for a drug wholesaler, he liked helping friends and family. He was a Polish Filipino. Some of the family he hired were Filipino and would bring Pancit, Lumpia, adobo etc to the potluck type lunches we had. I would even go to family functions with them. I love Filipino food. 

There was a place near me that closed down and I was left with no where to go. I drove past CFB but at the time it was only a bakery...lame 

After seeing the review for the place in Chandler, I had to find a closer place. SO I YELPED... sure enough there it was CFB. It is only 6 miles from work...sweet. 

I roll in and expect to see a dive but instead see a very clean, and larger then expected dining room. Attached was a bakery full of delights. 

I ordered the Pancit with chicken and veggies. It was freaking good. No soy or spicy sauce ALL the normal flavors. I also asked if I could sample some of the Lumpia and it was perfect, fresh, hot, and awesome. 

I will be back for some Adobo and some pastry's. 

They have karaoke on Friday, and a live band on Saturday. So you are warned.

"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster." - Henry Hill in Goodfellas (and secretly most guys watching the movie)

The Mob Museum was better than expected (3.5 stars), but, at $20/person, not exactly an offer you can't refuse. Here's what Wise Guys know:

 * Open 10:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. (8:00 p.m. Fri/Sat)
 * Adult: $20; Child (10-17): $14; Under 10: Free; Seniors/Military: $16; 
 * Nevada Residents can save $6 ... so $14 and $10
 * $30 Tickets for 2 Museums available: Neon Museum plus Mob Museum
 * Parking Lot next to Mob Museum is $5 ... or use a downtown casino lot & walk
 * Located inside the historic (1933) Las Vegas Federal Courthouse & Post Office
 * The self-guided tour takes a couple hours and covers 3 floors
 * The Mob Museum shows how Prohibition led to the expansion of the Mafia
 * The real wall from the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago is there
 * Exhibits cover legends Al Capone, Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel
 * Also Sam Giancana, Lefty Rosenthal, Mickey Cohen, John Gotti, & Whitey Bulger
 * The FBI & government get props for their battle against the mafia
 * Weapons, crime scene pics, and mob stories are everywhere
 * Lots of photographs of real mobsters and stories of their "real" families
 * The history of Las Vegas in the pictures/displays was very interesting to me
 * There's as much memorabilia of Las Vegas as there is for La Costa Nostra
 * Original casino/bar photos were fascinating; my how far Vegas has come
 * Liked displays on connections between mob families in different U.S. cities
 * One floor is dedicated to the actual Courtroom used for a Kefauver Hearing in 1950
 * Of course, Mob Movies are highlighted/celebrated, too.
 * No food/beverages, professional cameras, or large bags ... and no weapons
 * Small Mob Museum Gift Shop had some friendly people working there

At times, the Mob Museum feels like a romanticized Hall of Fame for organized criminals and law enforcement catching them. Because it is relatively modern, many of the displays keep your attention. It's not in the "must-visit" category for a Vegas vacation or weekend, but if you're tired of the casinos, clubs, shows, and action on the Las Vegas Strip then you may consider the Mob Musuem to "see what everyone's not talking about."

My name's Yee Gan and despite a fear of heights, I'm an adrenaline junkie. I love roller coasters and have even done a tandem skydive

So, when I saw that the Stratosphere Tower in Las Vegas had a new extreme experience - the SkyJump, I couldn't resist. It's not cheap at $109 per jump with filming costing extra

They're smart in allowing you to watch from the landing zone on the roof of the main building - you can see the jumpers falling from the 108th floor with their descent being slowed down by 2 zip wires on either side of the jumper. You can also watch their entire descent on a TV monitor inside the shop where you sign in for your jump and buy merchandise.

Although I love my thrills, the thought of jumping from the 108th floor was terrifying and it took me quite a while of watching and finally almost forcing myself to sign up.

After a safety briefing and ride up the tower, you're ready to enter the jump room with the opening to the outside and a jump into oblivion! A few people have got up here and have then been unable to enter the room. I must say that this was the most scary part of the experience as you look down a very long way at what appear to be toy cars.

Then, all too soon, you on the edge of the platform, ready to jump. It definitely takes a lot of bottle to actually step off the platform - that's the hardest bit but the descent was a little disappointing. The wires arrest your descent almost immediately and you don't come anywhere near terminal velocity like on a skydive. The big painted target on the landing area comes up quite quickly though and you're soon on terra firma.

It is a unique experience and adrenaline rush to step off the 108th floor of a building but the descent doesn't quite deliver the same rush and it's the same price as a good show in Vegas, so you have to decide whether it's worth it but it's certainly a unique experience

SCUM BAGS! I wish i could give negative stars. came in here for them to fix my AC in my Mercedes since it all of a sudden just stopped working. The guy behind the counter told me he had put a ultra violet wash through my AC to see where it was leaking. That was 82$ My AC worked for about 4 days and once again went out. So i brought it back and the guy (at the same location) told me they couldn't see where it was leaking from. He started using his "mechanic talk" and told me he could fix it. 162$ later i paid in cash and it just so happened their printer wasn't working so i couldn't get a receipt. Then as i was leaving the other guy behind the counter (skinny, shorter) asked me if i had weed in my car. I said No and he said "Damn i was going to ask if i could buy some from you" uhhh WTF! 
And once again, my AC went out 3 days later. I ended up going to a different mechanic and told them about the UV flush. This mechanic took me into the shop and put up a black light and no trace of UV was seen. He ended up putting the flush through my car and 2 weeks later i took it back and he put the black light up again, you could clearly see the neon residue everywhere and where it was leaking.
I called the Big O Tires and spoke to a manager. I told him about what happened & he said there was nothing in the computer about me coming in the 2nd time, or paying any money. He also said their wasn't anything in my file about a UV flush. I felt so cheated and deceived. I really hope this review gets out there and lets everyone know to STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.

What a crust!  

OK so it's from a small chain pizzeria.  But hey, this is Vegas, this is the Strip.  They are going to copy the NY original like no other place else can.  Classic 1200 degree coal burning ovens, formulated water with identical pH and mineral content of NYC water (not sure if this is a good thing).  All leads to what is undoubtedly one of the best NYC style pizza crust.  It's blistered,  well seasoned, just the right thinness with the perfect chew, with the perfect hint of smoky bitterness.  

Dirt cheap for the Strip.  $9 for a personal 12" red sauce pie $10 for a garlic white sauce or pesto.  Add $2 per topping including some great spiced meatballs, sweet Italian Sausage (American style), tender oven roasted peppers and milky mozzarella.  Mild intensity to any of the sauces to let the toppings show through.

Calzones are excellent.  Same great dough as the pies, same great filling in a hand held pouch.

True NYC pizzeria feel with the manager, hostess, and bartenders loudly shooting the breeze right at the door (when it's not too busy).  

A well chosen  selection of wines focusing on Italy, most offered by the glass or half carafe (500ml or 2/3 of a whole bottle).  Reasonable prices.  Half off all wines on Tuesdays.

A welcome, affordable addition to the Palazzo.

Overpriced, mediocre food. Bland atmosphere. Completely out of place and awkward feeling. Peculiar Rabbit is what happens when you have no vision of what you want to do, but decide to try and capitalize on the success of other businesses in an area. None-the-less, considering who owns it, I'm sure they will spend all the money they can to try and turn it into the go to spot... Even if people only begrudgingly go there.

Case in point: After a dismal turnout for their first 2 months, they decided to start paying $2500 a month to buy up 210 parking spots (far more than necessary for a business of this size) that were previously used for free community parking for all businesses in the area. Now, these spots have been turned into $5 premium parking spots. As a reward to anyone who pays $5, you get a $5 credit at Peculiar Rabbit! Nice, right? No, because you can't just swing by for a drink and get back your money... They expect you to build up a $50 tab at their overpriced restaurant first, before getting that $5 credit. Needless to say, the $50 catch isn't posted on the signs when you pull into the paid parking area. This is the bait and switch mentality of a failed business idea being forced upon a thriving neighborhood.

None-the-less, find some free parking and check out some of the great bars and restaurants in the area who don't need to turn their customers upside down and shake them to get a couple bucks. For breakfast / brunch, I suggest checking out Zada Janes, Bistro La Bon, or Soul. For lunch / dinner, I suggest Midwood Smokehouse, Soul, Dish, Diamond, Fuel Pizza. For drinks, check out Elizabeth Billiards, Twenty Two, Common Market, Thirsty Beaver, Snug Harbor.

Don't waste your time here.

Sushi Samba was the perfect spot to fill up on tasty food after a quick shopping spree at The Shoppes at The Palazzo with my fashionista girlfriend. We went straight for the $16 Chilean seabass bento box, which was the best deal on the lunch menu. It came with miso soup, field green salad, tuna roll and oshinko pickles. 

The three skewers of miso glazed seabass, along with all the sides, was a nice amount of food (though could've been a little small for a big appetite), but I seriously could have eaten three more skewers. The seabass was amazing! That miso marinade was to die for. I suppose I could've gotten the entree portion, but for lunch, it was perfect. Plus, $29 is a bit much to spend on a lunch entree. There were six tuna rolls, so that also made the bento filling.

The funky decor was really cool, and reminded me a little of Blowfish in the bay area -- but much bigger and with Latin influences intertwined. The staff was awesome, and the food came out quick. We were in and out in a flash, and back to the pool before our guys even missed us.

Gorgeous pool where the mermaids play. It's such an idyllic setting with the cascading waterfalls and calm waters. Add an alcoholic beverage to complete the picture and you're all set. Relax in this beautiful scene or meet some fun people to party with. Anything's fair game in Vegas, after all!

There are plenty of lounge chairs if you just want to kick back and recover from a long night. Grab a towel and catch some sun. Make sure to wear sunblock anytime you're outside in Las Vegas. The desert sun will own you. Guaranteed.

If you've napped long enough, take your drink with you into the pool and meet some highly interesting folks. You know how it is. When everyone's drinking, anyone can become your new friend.

So whether you're seeking the water nymph of your dreams or just have some fun, this is the place to be!

DATE TIP: The huge waterfall may *seem* like a nice romantic idea, but it's NOT romantic to piggyback someone right under the waterfall's force and just stand there forever. Once you get to the other side though, it becomes a private oasis.

Place is bomb dot com
Must visit when in Phoenix
In my top five joints 

Long before Yelp or the Travel Channel, my go to source for finding the best places to check out when travelling was a book called "Eat Your Way Across the USA."  I think this was only one of two places in Arizona that the book featured.  Went to Richardson's for the first time in probably the late 90's or early 2000's and have been hooked ever since.  It is among my absolute most favorite restaurants.

A couple years back, the original location was destroyed by fire.  This was my first time in the new location which is right around the corner from the original spot.  The interior looks almost exactly like the old location.  They now have mandatory valet, though, which I am not crazy about.

In the past, I have gotten the huevos rancheros and the enchiladas.  Best I have ever had for both.  Today, I got the Trio which was Swordfish, Salmon and Mahi Mahi.  Came on a tortilla with asparagus and carrots.  Outstanding!  They have five dollar mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys during brunch hours.  Had one mimosa and one bellini.

I wish I had just come to Richardson's straight from the airport when I arrived last Tuesday.  It is that freaking good!

What happens when a Croatian family, 2 gays and a brood of CenPho peeps head to the westside for a birthday brunch at...*gasp*...a chain restaurant. Well, I'll tell ya what happens. Big Fun. That's what! We had at least 20 people and took over an entire room in back. That was smart of them as we were a "lively" group. Granted it took quite a while to get drinks out to us, but I'm a restaurant person and forgive easier than others. We had strawberry mimosas served with a split of Freixenet. Fantastic! I had the cordon blue crepes with ham, Swiss, onion and eggs topped with Dijon cream sauce...seriously...they were heavenly. I was last to be served so I was nervous my crepes would be petrified. They were piping hot! Also on my plate were fresh grapes. They were chilled & snappy. Kind of like Angelina Joilie's personality. I have to say the place was pretty messy, including the restroom, which oddly smelled like the men's restroom at the Esplanade. I'll remember you Mimi. Next year, when I'm visiting the westside again, I may swing by for those crepes. Oh. One weird thing happened. After a few of us had ordered our third strawberry mimosa, we were told they had no more champagne left. Really? Cuz it feels like you're cutting us off! Whatev! We had consumed plenty but got a chuckle out of being cut off in a room full of coffee swilling seniors!

What a deal, $13.95 per adult and $8.00 per child at lunch.  11-3 Monday-Saturday.  We enjoyed the lunch pricing and enjoyed a $47 bill for 2 adults and 2 kids.  What a great lunch.  Where else you going to eat for such a low price and eat white truffle oil infused ravioli, duck pot stickers, duck legs, prime rib with Au Jus sauce, mash potatoes and gravy, shrimp, oysters, scallop low mien, pistachio gelato , cheese cake, apple pie, banana cream pie, and plenty of other deserts that I could no longer look at.  Delicious calories waiting for me to fill my belly.  
Seriously I almost ate all of that at lunch.  This buffet totally blew my diet and it should with so many great items on the menu you should find something that you will like.  In fact you should like it to the point that you will have to loosen you belt a notch to make room.  This could be the best buffet in Arizona, I have to agree with Rand H. on that one.

A new American diner serving up end comfort foods.

We're talking salads with heirloom this, organic that, quality sandwiches with aioli, pesto.  No fries or steamed veggies.  Instead fried Portobellos, and roasted cauliflower.  Fried fish?  No. Wood roasted salmon, sea bass, cod, halibut.   Oh yeah, BUTCHER'S CUTS.

Straight to it, Butcher's cuts are some of the most flavorful cuts of beef.  Tougher, less even marbling, strong mineral and beef flavor, uneven thickness, Never cooked above medium rare to the disdain of the have it your way folks.  

Good offerings.  All fire grilled with a good sear and smoky bitterness that enhances its natural flavor.  They have been seasoned, rubbed, or marinated to mask some of the characteristics some find off-putting.  Request all cuts seasoned with simple salt if you want to do a natural tasting.

The cuts from highest to lowest fat content and lowest to highest beefy flavor:  rib cap, skirt, tri tip, flat iron, and hanger.

Traditional steak cuts of grass feed beer are also offered.  Well trimmed, grass fed flavor, decently tender but BORING compared to the butcher's cuts.

Other mains just OK.  Fish is cooked at too high a temperature resulting in visible albumin and tougher flesh. 

"Small plates" (can be used as starters or sides) include a great dish of roasted heirloom carrots, seasoned roasted cauliflower with chili de Arbol, shallots and onions, and portabello fries with their meaty, mushroomy goodness in a crispy coating.  All perfect foils to any steak.  

Short but very well chosen wine list.  Service befitting a diner; friendly with some lapses.  Great prices with mains priced less than $18 and Butcher's cuts less than $23.  Bottom line; all good!

On a perfectly mild sunny day in vegas, it was a great choice to eat on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi overlooking Las Vegas Blvd. As soon as we entered the restaurant from the casino entrance, from the dark interior, it was like stepping into a whole different world once we got seated on the patio. 
Usually when servers rattle off the specials of the day, it goes out the other ear for me. But after looking over the menu and half heartedly deciding on the spinach and gruyere omlette, I heard the server mention Bacon and Spinach Eggs Benedict and i was sold! Quiche Lorraine with bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=4Ua39HREZlvlYbEf3EP_ew for the dude and my friend got the dish i was thinking of originally http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=5luau0SKUmjSVfXBalxsMQ. We all agreed that my dish ended up being the best: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=T3jPSmE56xcETgTqjegttw.
The quiche had a nice crust, but was kind of monotonous. (i love breakfast sides and this had none). The spinach omelette was ok- i enjoyed my omelette at Max Brenner much more. 
I've only had eggs benedict a few times elsewhere and i have to say this one was very yummy- the eggs were perfectly runny and the bacon (i believe it was applewood) was nice and crispy. 
We were too sweets wasted this time to order the pancakes, french toast etc, so next time i would like to try those or the steak dishes with a side of their onion soup!

Lychee lemonade and fried chicken- island style!
I've been stalking this place since their signage went up in the Trader Joe's plaza months ago- they finally opened to the public today! Mochiko chicken is a Japanese-Hawaiian fried chicken that is marinated for 24 hours and breaded in sweet rice flour prior to frying. (According to Wikipedia)

Menu offers a few plates, bowls, and salads-  basic menu with different dipping sauces and a la carte chicken options. Ordered The Cali plate: two pieces of chicken, fries and coleslaw, with a Hawaiian roll and a drink. Interior is minimalist and modern with neutral colors, save for a beach painting on one wall.

The fried chicken here tastes more baked than fried, and has a slight sweetness with good crunch and a very fine breading. Dipping sauce was light yet flavorful. Fries are lightly seasoned, similar to a Cajun style. Coleslaw is not mayo-based which automatically made me like it over other varieties, and roll was soft and sweet.

But what really makes them stand out are the service and the lychee lemonade- Sandra was super friendly and upbeat, running the counter and telling me about the company. They are also getting word out about their opening with jelly bracelets supporting breast cancer research, as she is a survivor. 
The lychee lemonade is alongside the other fountain drink options in a tea dispenser, and it will. blow. your. mind! The sweetness of lychee with the slight tartness of lemon, I would probably bathe myself in this delicious drink. Be sure to get it when you go!

This Swiss bakery has been my go-to spot for cakes and macarons. I first noticed this bakery on Yelp, and the owner makes everything from scratch with natural ingredients. Foot traffic is rare, and the interior encompasses large glass cases, tiled floor, and colorful chocolates and European pastries to fill out the dcor.

The quarter sheet Custard Cake ($29.98) came with soft spongy cake, custard, and airy textures with moderate sweetness. My friends raved about its light-tasting qualities and I really enjoyed it too. The website says the cake can feed 15-20 people, but I always have leftovers to share with others.

The quarter sheet Tiramisu ($29.98) came with good moisture and mascarpone flavor, but the consistency of the custard needed to be more refined. The overall flavor was borderline bland, and without rum this cake could use another anchor such as an aromatic coffee to render that special effect. It was a solid cake, but I have had better.

I absolutely loved their Macarons ($1.50). It all started with a crisp airy texture, followed by a soft chew and persistent flagrant ganache at the center. I have tried the Red Velvet, Pistachio, Chocolate Orange, Pumpkin Pie, Almond, Blueberry, and Coconut flavors. They were all striking, memorable, and the fruit flavors were particularly delectable. The textures and flavors on these Macarons were consistent on each of my previous visits. It never fails.

Each time the service was forward, efficient, and responsive. I find it helpful to communicate directly with the owner, as he is knowledgeable and always finds ways to meet my expectations. Eventually I'd like to order off the menu and try the Saint Honore Cake, Poppy Seed Bread, and other Macaron flavors.

Here's why you should go -- Their pull pork sandwich is very good!  House specialty BBQ is very good!  Fries are good!

Here's why you shouldn't go and all of you out there that ever worked in the food industry can relate.  Don't treat your employees like Poop! Especially, not in front of me or any other patrons of the restaurant. 

Story: We place our order with the counter gal and she relays the message one at a time to Ric. Ric yells, "How bout you tell me how many burgers total instead of telling me one by one"!  Then asked everyone else in the restaurant "Does anybody else want a burger!" while shaking his head. The gal was mortified and was holding back her tears. I felt bad! I felt so uncomfortable sitting there eating. Needless to say my burger was over spiced and too salty!  Why? I ask would you do such a thing!?  Does it make him feel empowered by such actions!?  It was uncalled for!

You, yes you out there that ever worked in an environment with a crappy boss knows what I mean.  Overall the food was pretty good, but in the end Ric left a bad taste in my mouth! - Enjoy!

Being an Arizona native, walking into Black Bear Diner the first time was a surprise.  Whoa.  Did I get transported to Redding, California or something?  It was like we stepped out of the concrete jungle of Goodyear and into a log cabin in the woods.  Hansel, get Gretel out of the oven!

I've visited this location for the past five or six years and the food is always great whether you come for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  The portions are generous and the food is always brought to you hot.  The chicken fried steak is one of my favorites and the chicken pot pie is pretty solid too.  I haven't tried their tempting desserts since I'm always beyond-stuffed by the time I'm finished with my meal but they got a delicious maltshake.  Malts... so much better than regular milkshakes!

Black Bear Diner is a cute rustic-looking eatery with friendly service and good food.  Come and give them a try!  I'd take BBD over Denny's and IHOP any day.

My little brother and I decided we were hungry, so I quickly yelped what was near me, and Fat Boy was one of the first to show on my nearby list.  I quickly read a couple of reviews and found that all were 5-stars. My curiosity sky-rocketed, I looked up the menu online, and we called in to order. (They were going to close in 20 minutes, but were still undoubtedly happy to take & make my order. THUMBS UP!)

WHEN: They are open & available from 10am-9pm. Dine in, take-out, delivery!

WHAT WE HAD:
-Guacamole Boyger: This was my pic, and yayyy!! I did it!! This burger was satisfactory indeed!!! If you are a fan of avocado, this should be your pick!
-Hawaiian Boyger: This was my brother's choice and of course I had to snag a bite!! This burger was like CRACK! I seriously wish I chose this burger as my first pick! It had the perfect amount of pineapple, plus that bbq sauce! Gotta love that bbq sauce on a burger!
-Chencho fries: Now this is a must try!!! You can choose either fat or skinny fries! It is drenched in that delicious green sauce and covered in melted mozzarella! NUM NUM NUM

WHY: You will not be disappointed!!

*NOTE: I was chatting it up with the dude that worked there, and I was explaining what yelp was to him. He said he gets a lot of yelpers!! Muahaha, YELPERS SPREAD LOVE!

I've been to the Brat Haus a couple of times. It has so much potential but I'm going to have to pass the next time I'm in the area.

The patio is a great feature. They have some excellent beer as well. I think their brats are good and I like the bun that they come on. But $7.50 for a brat with a la cart sides is pretty expensive in my book. I had the German Potato Salad for $3.75 and the ratio of potatoes to sauerkraut on the plate was about 10 to 1 in favor of the sauerkraut. While I can certainly appreciate a restaurant wanting to jazz up an old standard dish. I think the Brat Haus strucked out on this one. German Potato Salad should have a lot of potatoes in it, dunkoff. The dish was good, but don't call it German Potato Salad. My bad for not reading the menu and assuming that German Potato Salad mainly consisted of  potatoes. I also had the ice cream float which I thought was a complete waste of 5 bucks. 

Another factor which puts my rating in the 3 star zone is that our server was so busy trying to upsell that she didn't deliver the "German Potato Salad" with the Brat. She forgot to put the correct order into the kitchen so I was basically done with my brat by the time the side was delivered. To her credit, she admitted to her goof up.

One suggestion that I would make is that the Brat Haus create individual plates for the roasted pig. I think you would sell a lot of those roasted pig plates.

My Sweet lovers guide to vegas treats!!

Jean Phillipe patisserie is a must. They have two locations, bellagio with the famous chocolate fountain display  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=5CTu6r-oMEnATEqkMQFtYg and the one at Aria  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=zqVvDm_-ikgvhPMZrUK3Lg which is bigger and has an area to sit down and indulge. U can have a variety of cakes, gelato, chocolates, crepes, pastries.. They do not sell individual macarons but u can buy a packaged set. The crepe, mousse cake and creme brulee gelato I had were all excellent!

Max Brenner @ Caesars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=VM3v-ly8TaqF6Gi21XOCTg is chocolate lovers dream! The chocolate smell wafting alone is intoxicatingly delicious. They not only have a boutique of chocolate treats, u can eat a fabulous meal here and make sure to get a chocolate chip walnut cookie: the best I ever had! 

Check out sugar factory at PH http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pNR0cAPdO4RHulVTFssn-A?select=eFmRocS3vcKGcJNlBTibOQ if u love gummies, lollies etc. but the cupcakes, macarons, gelato looked pretty ordinary.

Bouchon bakery at the Venetian  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=U4VwyUcdlz4Mlsl3hqb5Ug is a great stop if you've never been to any of the bouchon bakeries. It's a small stand as opposed to a shop. Signature bouchons r always great, their macarons r not my fave but huge and pretty. A new fave for me is their carrot whoopie pie!

Vosges at the Forum shoppes is a cool place to check out if u like exotic flavor chocolates. But it can be  pricey.
If u like banana cream pie, the one at Emerils at MGM is awesome!

I went to Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmo http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=v2QzpbqjH_ok7MlKhQsnpw expecting awesome desserts but altho beautiful, I was not too impressed.

Didn't get to check out Payard at Caesars but they have macarons there, altho i'm sure they don't beat Paulettes (now called Lettes) in LA.  Dessert at Wynn buffet  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=IAjMHTukj1EFSbL6WILEgg was disappointing

Other highlights of vegas eats for me was Cosmopolitan pizza, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon@ MGM and Earl of Sandwich @ PH.

Shows: Jabbawockeez at Monte Carlo was super fun and very memorable!

If ur going from LA, if they r open, make sure to visit My Delight Cupcakery in Ontario on the way home. They have the best cupcakes around!!!http://www.yelp.com/biz/my-delight-cupcakery-ontario#query:my%20delight%20cupcaker

*thanks ken c & janice c.for some of the recs!

I have to go w/ five.  I can still remember every, even the most subtle flavor, starting with the bread and oil, the Ginhound cocktail, followed by the salad (we chose the salad Pavle talked up, and we were not disappointed).  As we munched on the salad, I commented to my dining partner that we were eating a lot of grapefruit - both the Ginhound and the shaved fennel salad featured the fruit, but neither were overly bitter at all.  It was the ideal way to start the meal.

We elected to carry on with the Spigarello (delicious- excellent balance of garlic and a slightly buttery taste) again per Pavle's recommendation, along with an order of the mozzarella w/ an egg over braised leeks.  This was my favorite dish (well, tied with the salad and dessert...).  The mustard breadcrumbs added a little tangy flavor along with a fantastic texture.  

Finally, we decided to split the bread pudding dessert.  Made w/ chocolate/cherry bread from the Phoenician's bakery (available at the Old Town Farmer's Market in Scottsdale), it was decadent.  

All in all a fantastic meal - everything was perfect.  The atmosphere, the service...  It was fantastic.  You won't regret going there.

I bought a supposedly comfortable pair of shoes for Vegas.

Comfortable? Comfortable?!!!

I'd like to see the Nike ColeHaan "geniuses" behind these so called comfy shoes, walk the strip in the boots from hell.

Anyways - after a night full of painful foot issues, and chaotic club lines - we decided that the three Miss Yelps were in dire need of some pampering.

And so after doing some Yelp research beforehand - we decided on Qua. 

Just like Nicole C - said - Qua Spa is the Ultimate.

The treatments are a little pricey - but I've heard they're well worth it.  (Connie loved her massage). Nicole and I decided to just use the facilities. For about 40 dollars, you can get access to the dream facilities that make up Qua.

For forty dollars you get access to big Romanesque indoor pools of warm (Tepidarium), hot (Caldarium) and cold water (Frigidarium), with sensual overhead rain showers.  Pure aqua bliss. You can spend all day dipping your body in each, and once your body is relaxed and revitalized by the mineral enriched waters,  you can grab the latest gossip magazine and lounge on the reclined hot stone chairs, which heat up your core - allowing for one of the best naps you'll ever take.

If you're done sitting poolside, you can then head to the lounge area, to grab some fruity hot and cold teas (all teas throughout the spa are organically grown with only natural ingredients and flavors ). 

One thoroughly hydrated, you can wrap your robe tightly around you, as you make your way to the next heavenly phase in the adventure - the Laconium and Arctic Ice Room.

The Laconium room is the sauna. It's the perfect place to clear your pores and sweat out any vodka and redbulls injested the night before.  Lying back on the wooden benches, you feel your body become lifeless, as your forehead heats up. Once throughly warmed - you head to the Arctic Room.

The Arctic Ice Room has heated floors and benches where you can sit perched as you watch snow fall before you. It's soothing, and magical, and takes you back to the excitement you felt when young. Utter awe at the early signs of resh falling winter.

Feeling the chill, you emerge from the brisk world  - back into Qua reality  - an amazing shower with high quality shampoo and conditioner (Qua even has a handy contraption to get the water out of your bathing suit in a matter of seconds)

Feeling alive, awake, and amazing  - you slather yourself in moisturizer, brush your hair, get dressed, and leave Qua a better and healthier person.

If you're going to Vegas - go big. 

Go to Qua to forget the craziness of the night before, and to get ready for the craziness that lies ahead.

I stop at Chloe's Corner about once a week for a quick bite.  They do a nice business because they're the only sandwich place in Kierland Commons, for those of us who work nearby.

Like Sarah Y, I love their Egg Salad sandwiches.  It's creamy without being slopping with a hint of Coleman's mustard.  Another joy is just sitting at the counter and having a fountain drink (see photo).  Besides the Egg Salad, another one of my favorites is their rare Roast Beef sandwich (photo).  Both are delicious.

Chloe's is very reminiscent of the old days, when you could buy a sandwich at Walgreen's.  That how they started off, as a small drugstore serving sandwiches and fountain drinks back in Chicago.  Clearly they grew well beyond that concept.  For those from the east coast, it's like the old Chock-full-of-nuts coffee shops.  By the way, the soups at Chloe's are amazing.

Most of Chloe's sandwiches are in the $6.50 to $7.50 range and are delicious.  Don't forget that they also offer a freshly brewed cup of their signature coffee for only 50 cents!  A bottomless cup as they say.

Enjoy!

After visiting the Neon Museum, I wish I had a time machine to go back to the 1950's and '60's to see what old timey Las Vegas was like. No mega hotels/resorts, no football shaped drinks and no video poker in a bar. This was a time when people actually got dressed up to go to on a Vegas vacation 'cause gambling was a special occasion.

Such a cool exhibit and informative tour - guides take you through a curated maze of old, rusty neon signs (you can look, but don't touch!) and provide some interesting tidbits about Vegas history. As many have mentioned, it does take an hour or so and you must be escorted with an employee... no random wandering.

Plenty of photo opportunities, especially for those who love changing their social media profile pics on the regular. Though I don't think a camera phone could really do this place justice, as the signs are quite impressive and I'd rather take a mental picture to remember. 

And yes, this also doubles as an event space. I can only imagine how cool it looks at night with some of the working signs lit up! 

$18/person if you aren't a local. Worth the cost, as they're a 501(c)3 and your tour ticket is tax-deductible. Plus, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see Vegas history.

Downtown Pizza Lounge is a nice place to pop into if you're looking for a quick slice of pizza.  The basic set-up is that there are 6-8 varieties of pizza daily, and once you choose the type you it is reheated in the oven for you.  On the day we stopped in, the fresh pies were coming out of the oven so we were able to have fresh pizza, versus the reheated version.  Slices were good, and they have a few different lunch specials to choose from.  If we had gotten slices that had been reheated, I don't think they would have held up so well.   So like most other things in life, timing is everything.

The menu is fairly limited, with buffalo wings and house salads being the only other options.  But if you're in need of a quick pizza fix, go for whichever variety is coming fresh out of the oven and you'll leave pleased.  Overall, closer to 3.5 stars.  Three if you get reheated, four if you catch them fresh.

Fabulous find. 

We were leaving Macy's and I asked "where do you want to go for lunch?"  We remembered there was a Habit Burger across the street, so off we went.

So here we are walking past Garbanzo. It was very dark inside with their tinted windows and the signs on the window said "Space Available." So I thought "Wow" that was fast, didn't they just open?  Well, another Phoenix business has closed. 

We get to Habit and the line is out onto the sidewalk. D'oh!  But just then, someone leaves Garbanzo and the lights inside tell a different story. Yes, they're open.  It turns out the sign "Space Available", was for another store.  So the heck with burgers, let's eat Greek/Middle Eastern.  Sorry Habit!

Garbanzo Mediterranean Grill is like the Chipotle's for the Gryos and hummus crowd. It's actually more of a fast food version of Pita Jungle. The food is really good and fresh!  Lunch ran us under $20  and we left very impressed. 

Enjoy!

Yep, I am officially in love with Haute Chix and it has soared up on my list for top clothing stores. 

A few tips: Make sure you follow them on instagram @hautechixvegas to get the first scoop on brand new items and the daily deal.. whether it is 20% off of certain items or certain colors! Very fun idea and I am happy to know that they still care about doing these things to show appreciation for their customers. Word on the street is: alterations here are fairly priced and they come out looking fantastic. Also, check in on Yelp before you checkout ;)

I rushed over here because I fell in love with two dresses posted on their instagram and my trip ended with me snagging up both of them along with some cute accessories. I love that they took the time to wrap my necklaces in tissue paper so it would not end up a tangled mess in my bag. Whenever I am done checking out, I feel like I just gave myself a nice gift. Cute, brown kraft paper bag with my newly purchased goodies inside topped off with tissue paper. It can easily can end up being a gift bag if it is a present for someone.

They have a lot of unique jewelry pieces/clothes that you will not find easily distributed like per se Forever 21. I love shopping here and knowing that you will only be finding my top or outfit on very few other individuals. And again, I must stress that if you love that item, BUY IT! It will most likely be gone before you can even think about it lol.

Yes, Four Stars.

Actually Qdoba is pretty close to Chipotle in taste and setup (see photos).  You get in line, tell them either Burrito or Taco, what beans, onions, guacamole, et cetera you want, and before you know it you are enjoying a flavorful meal.

I found Qdoba is trying very hard to stay relevant in a very crowded "fast casual Mexican food" segment. and seems doing a good job and business.  I came here a few weeks ago on a whim and enjoyed myself.  It was around 2 pm and they were just recovering from a busy lunch crowd.

I believe some of the pluses that standout from that visit is the diversity of the food menu and variety of choices when you are ordering.  One example is their Queso.  Yes they have it and it's as delicious as anything you can make in your microwave at home. LOL

So Four Stars and "Yay! I'm a fan."

Enjoy!

"The noblest of all dogs is the hot-dog; it feeds the hand that bites it. " - Lawrence J. Peter.

After having Short Leash numerous times at events around the valley, I finally gotten around to visiting their place and boy am I full!  Strolled in today after a dramatic parking adventure with Linh L. and we ordered a delicious meal.  Between the two of us, we had a root beer, a ginger ale, corn dog bites, the Igby, and the Sunny.  Our bill came out to about $30 before tip for the both of us.  Admittedly, it's a bit of a splurge for wieners on naan bread but hey, it's Friday, I paid my student loans, and I wanted some good eats.  It's always good eats with Short Leash!  The Bear caught my eye but I was thinking I wanted something with some greens.  That Sunny... pure bliss.  It had pear with some honey, prosciutto, goat cheese, arugula, cracked black pepper, with a chicken wiener on fluffy warm naan bread.  Savory-sweet [with a hint of bitterness from the arugula]  wins me over every time.  I think it's more than just puppy love...

Other yummy items that have crossed these lips:  The Bear, Mac Daddy, fried pickles, jalapeno poppers, the pimento cheese dip, and the brat-stuffed pretzel.  Yum!  Try to save room for their dessert items.  If I didn't feel like passing out right on the spot from that food coma, I would have loved to split the orange-glazed and pistachio doughnut or the maple and candied bacon.  Gimme gimme!  More reason to arrange lunch again with some friends, right?  *cough, hint, cough* Mike W., Laz C., Brett B., Melodie C., Meghan L., and Linh L.

Friends ask: What's your favorite car?

I say: Hands down, super cars!  Who doesn't drool for the exotics?!

Friends go on to tell me that there's a track in which you can drive them as fast as you want, yadda yadda. 

Me: No Brainer! Of course I want in!!
 
If you can't be behind the wheel for whatever reason, hey, you can be a back-seat driver! As I was waiting for my turn I saw a few people riding as a passenger alongside a real race car driver.  I felt their excitement just by looking at their expressions as they got out of the car. They sure got the ride of a lifetime! 

Most of the employees here are a friendly bunch. They know what they are doing and seem to enjoy their jobs. The owner was on duty that day and noticed we were waiting for quite a while, so they offered my friend a free upgrade and tried to move things along as fast as possible. He paid for the regular Ferrari and got to drive the scuderia instead. I notice that they keep adding more and more cars to their garage! How I wished they had a McLaren when I was there!

Okay, okay. I'll leave you all with a cheesy picture. Here's a photo of me in a ridiculous helmet but in a white lambo:

A $19 cobb salad with a $3 PBR. Well, let's be real here...eventually we learned of buckets of PBR, six for $15. DEAL! SOLD! The cocktail list is lively, fresh and inventive and pricey as one would expect at a resort. 

We took shelter in our private cabana and had stellar service from AJ. We were served a fruit and veggie platter along with other things we ordered...nachos were delicious...as was my cobb salad.

The cabana was comfortable with a u shaped seating area with complimentary bottled water (well, complimentary my ass...it's part of the $200 that was paid for the cabana...but I digress) and of course plenty of clean, fresh towels. 

The entrance, the grounds, the main pool...everything just so vibrant, clean and utterly breathtaking. The crowd was so NOT douchey. It was a nice mix of old and young, gay and straight and black and white...you get the picture. We met a lot of fun people during our six hours there. 

Now. The best part. My friends, young as they are, were staying for happy hour. Well I had my limit of PBR's and had a Schnauzer in diapers waiting for her afternoon walk, so I decided to split. The concierge directed me to the bellman and said he would help me get a taxi. The bellman asked if a towncar would be ok? Um. Hmm. A pristine, shiny black town car or a roll of the dice with a skanked out taxi with a sweaty, hairy, stinky driver. Yes. Town car. 

It. Was. Perfect. I was sunburnt. Tipsy. And on my way home. The drive down the 51 is so beautiful. When he pulled into my driveway and said it was $29 (a deal!)...I gave him two twenties and thanked him. Cuz that's how I roll.

Back in 1999, Kenny Guinn declared this part of Spring Mountain as "China Town" because apparently all Asians in Clark County are Chinese. Sure, you can argue that all Asian people did originate from the Chinese, but thats not the point. 

The Chinatown Plaza was the very first China themed mall in Chinatown. And today the Chinese community of Las Vegas is very honored that the most famous resident of Chinatown is Floyd Mayweather.

This shopping center has a Filipino Restaurant, a couple of Pho places, a ton of Korean restaurants, and a huge shopping mall to buy Chinese gifts and Beckoning Cats. Like only 30% of this shopping center actually features Chinese businesses.

Remember that Chinese food has a 5000 year history. So that's why so many of our favorite Japanese and Korean dishes look so similar. Every other Asian country stole their cuisine from China. A lot of you know that Ramen originated in China, but did you know that Sushi also originated in China  as well?

Most of us use this shopping center as a place to park because the shopping center with Ichiza, Yagyu Yakiniku, and Anime Ramen has no parking spaces. I've never been towed, but recently they hired this gigantic Native-American parking enforcer who looks f*cking scary!

When I first moved to Las Vegas, I immediately noticed that all the different ethnic groups of Asian people hated each other. There was a gigantic and vicious inter-Asian rivalry going on. I didn't like this one bit because as a young child, I grew up in Arcadia, where one of the most brutal concentration camps for Japanese-Americans once existed. As a child I remember seeing Chinese-Americans get told to "go back to Japan". During the LA Riots, many African-Americans in the area used to say racial slurs to Chinese-Americans, telling them to go back to Korea. My point here is that we as Asian-Americans all had to suffer together because they just don't care what specific type of Asian we are. Vincent Chin made this argument a fact when he was murdered.  

The very first documented Asian-American was actually Filipino. But, the very first large migration of Asian-Americans were Chinese. They paved the way for all the rest of us. Since they first set foot in the United States, they were hated and vilified for no reason at all.  In the 1850s,  a legislative was passed that made Chinese men unable to testify in court, in 1862 California residents voted that all Chinese residents should be taxed for being Chinese, 1878 the United States Government revoked every Chinese immigrants citizenship as Americans even if they were born in the USA, they were also prohibited from getting married, and in California it was NOT illegal to assault a Chinese man, in 1882 all Chinese immigrants are banned from entering the USA. Most of these laws were not repealed until the 1940s!! 

Frequently, I walk around in Chinatown and see a "westerner"acting completely disrespectful and making racist jokes towards every little Chinese decoration in the plaza.  The reason they do this is because the Chinese people are too polite to them and allow them to do this. These "westerners" should thank God everyday that they didn't do that in a Vietnamese district like Westminster California, because I guarantee that some Vietnamese guy would have beaten the living crap out of them, abducted them, and brought them to the backroom of a Pho restaurant and force them to play Russian Roulette. Yeah, it's called "Russian" Roulette, but the Vietnamese are the only people who are Man enough to play it. 

All I ask, is that you treat the Chinese with some respect when you come here. You don't see Chinese people  come into stores like "EXTREME John Smith's HARDCORE Dirt bikes, Surfboards, and Skate Shop" and disrespect you guys.

It really doesn't get any better than Crescent! I have been saving up all these wonderful things to say in a review about Crescent Ballroom but, if I wait any longer I will never write it...

Every show, every experience at the bar, every encounter with the staff, it all just gets better all the time. Something in the water perhaps? 

This venue is the tits! The show room is so intimate. You can get up close and personal with your favourite artists or chill back in the stadium bleachers There's not a bad spot to stop and listen in the whole place. The sound, the lights, the temperature! Its all oddly perfect. You are never really standing on top of someone else and I really love that. But some sold out shows do get packed.

Los Dias de la Crescent was such a stand out event for me this past year. Really a unique experience at a venue other than a park. 

They have a good beer selection! Though they don't have Hop Knot on tap I can order it in a can or, in lieu, grab an Odells on draft. 

I have not had a chance to order food from the cocina but I have tried the nachos and they do not disappoint!

I try to see at least two shows a month here. No reason not to! So many great artist and at such an intimate venue. Stop over at Stinkweeds, pick up some tickets and get your bottom to a show!

OTFM was a zoo today (in a good way).  I've never seen it so packed with people, but it's refreshing to see that so many people are looking to buy local lately!  I was lucky enough to get one of ten seats for the kick-off of The Farm Sessions... what a treat.

For those that don't know, The Farm Sessions will take place each week at the Farmers Market from now through the end of the season (May 29, 2010).  Each Saturday, a local chef will demonstrate (to a group of ten people), as they shop the farmers market and prepare a dish using fresh ingredients.  Viking is the main sponsor, and I believe the space itself is there thanks to the Chef's Loft as well.  But The Farm Sessions' concept is thanks to Joe Garcia, who brought his vision to fruition - kudos for that!

Today's session was led by Chef James Porter of Petite Maision.  He did an incredible job, keeping the session fun and interactive.  I learned a ton and I scored one of the eco-friendly totes as well.  Chef James made it look easy to create a gourmet meal of pork chop with salad and goat cheese and a fresh melon drizzled with honey and goat cheese for dessert.  

Our group of foodies followed James around the market and found the ingredients from the following vendors:
-Made By Bees
-Triple V Farm
-Rhiba Farms
-On the Vine
-Seacat Gardens
-Queen Creek Olive Mill
-Pork on a Fork

While today was free since it was the first one, going forward, the cost will be $40 per ticket and participants will receive enough ingredients to prepare the same dish at home for two, a recipe card, shopping/resource list and a market shopping tote.

I am excited to see the line-up of chefs that are participating for future sessions - I am sure this will sell out each week, so plan on purchasing your tickets early!  (You can do so on their website).

My four years at Arizona State University (2003-2007) were some of the most interesting times of my life - during this time I made some amazing friends, grew tremendously as a person, and even spent about three years working for the University (and absolutely loving it for the most part). Why then, might you wonder, am I giving ASU such a low rating?

Simple.

The quality of education is lacking at best, and laughable at worst. Granted, my experience is going to be different than someone who majored in the hard sciences, law, business, engineering, or any of Michael Crow's other pet projects. I had the misfortune of dual-majoring in Psychology and Women's Studies, both areas of study that fall under the Liberal Arts. 

The University, by the way, refused to confer my Women's Studies degree because the numerous advisers I met with neglected to tell me that I had missed the cutoff deadline by about a semester. So, despite doing all the work and finishing my thesis, I was awarded a minor, alongside an invitation to take fifteen completely unnecessary credits to get my second degree. When translated to cold, hard, cash, that comes out to the tune of ~$9,000. 

In the end I decided to forget about the second major - an undergraduate degree in the Liberal Arts from ASU isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Do not take this to mean however, that good professors don't exist - I've met plenty of fantastic professors during my time at ASU, but I also saw a number of them leave, disgusted by Crow's vision for the college. 

As an employee, I got to see the ASU that a lot of students don't - I had the opportunity to talk to many professors at staff meet and greets who simply couldn't deal with what they'd come to refer to as "bureaucratic bull****". I've talked to no less than half a dozen professors who left, tired of frustrating tenure requirements, narrow minded research-oriented policies, and uneven allocation of educational funding. So, really, it's not just the students-at-large that are treated like second-class citizens at the university. The teachers present get their fair share of abuse too. 

In addition to the education, there are a host of other things wrong with ASU - astronomical parking prices, overemphasis on new dorms, mandatory meal plans (for on-campus students anyway), and terrible student/alumni support, to name a few. 

Make no mistake about it. Michael Crow's ASU couldn't care less about the quality of education that you receive at this "university". If you want to get the best education your money get get you, look elsewhere.

New American at it's finest.  

Combining globally sourced ingredients and flavors with classic American cuisine then trying to achieve the broadest range of taste results in incredible good eats.  It's all done without molecular gastronomy. 

For starters, the wagyu beef tartare; great beef flavor and just the right accompaniments to balance the usual cloying fatty finish (pickled mustard seeds, capers, the usual coddled egg yolk, and CHOCOLATE).  The bitterness balanced the entire dish.  

Not to be missed, the foie gras custard brulee; excellent.  Cherries for the requisite acidic sweetness, toasted cocoa nibs for bitterness and a twist, salted brioche.  Imaginative.

Finally, the roasted sweetbreads; stunning.  Bacon fat (from a thick cut piece of bacon) provides the seasoning to the airy sweetbreads they blend well with polenta and wafting umame of trumpet mushrooms.  Slightly one dimensional texturally but good eats for sure.

Salads are anything but common.  How about a heirloom tomato salad with smoked peaches and baby fennel accented by lemon pickled cucumber.  Vibrant acidity, complexity from the licorice fennel, sweet bitterness of the peaches.  Perfect.

For mains, the Iberico pork loin, cooked medium, tender with a pronounced heritage pork flavor.  It contrast well with a piece of crispy pork shoulder.  Served with a sweet, smoked date pure that makes the perfect accompaniment heightening the natural sweetness of the pork.

The 36 hour braised wagyu short rib, equally good.  One of the best braised short ribs I've had (the best being Craftsteak).  Served with an earthy horseradish potato pave and caramelized onions, glazed in its own braising liquid.  The braised beef, rich and melting the sides providing a sweet, earthy balance.

Excellent and efficient service.

The wine list remains excellent.  Vegas resort pricing.

Truly a foodies playground!

Very Cute and Cozy Place! 

The Food was AMAZING! 
Seriously I have been thinking about it all day and whether my diet likes it or not I'll be returning very soon! 

I got the Appetizer Platter which came with a Pupusa, a chicken meat pie, a chicken tamale and beans. (see pics) 

Everything was wonderful and fresh and oh so Delicious! 

I would have to tell anyone who has never had this kind of food, do not be intimidated, go for it you won't be sorry, my particular meal wasn't spicy or greasy it was just the best thing I have tasted in weeks and it's definitely budget friendly!

So, all week before my Vegas trip I was super pumped about a schmancy $100 brunch reservation we had at some other restaurant. It turned out to be okay, but that night we went to Johnny Smalls for a $20 all-you-can-eat tapas dinner and it blew that fancy schmancy brunch out of the effin' water.

Seriously. This is approximately three billion times better than any buffet out there. I know some of ya'll are really into foie gras, caviar, and whatever other hoity-toitiness there is out there. You know what I'm into? Mac n' cheese, bacon, fritos, ranch dressing. What can I say? I'm a gal of highly refined taste, and Johnny Smalls has got my number

There was a 20 minute wait for a table, so we sidled on up to the bar and had dinner and drinks there all served by Anthony, the most kickass flair bartender/server EVER. And you know how I mentioned that $20 AYCE earlier? It really is AYCE. Anything on the menu. From frito pie (with kobe beef chili, of course) to pork belly to tuna sashimi to mac n cheese to grilled pb&j. TWENTY DOLLARS. Period. No extra. 

...word on the street is that they are upping the price to $30 for AYCE after the new year, but even if that's true this is still one of the best values for endless deliciousness around.

When Rickie mentioned going to the Thai Hut, I thought, that's funny, I'm really not in the market for neckwear. Then we drove by and it looked so cute. Like a Thai diner with lots of booths lining the windows which overlook McDowell around 3rd Ave. Obviously not a lot of money or design when into the reincarnation, but the energy of the room and the super friendly staff warmed me instantly. I swear the server telepathically took our app order as the spring rolls arrived to the table, hot and crispy, before I had even squeezed the lemon in my water. Along with the chicken satay, they were both good, not out of this world however. Rickie's "chicken noodle" soup was flavorful, yet the chicken was hella funky. Oddly shaped bland, poached peices of poultry particularly unpleasant. The sizzling beef was Thairiffic. Really. Thairiffic. My obligatory phad thai, although missing the tofu, was very dee lish. Prices were affordable. No beer however and that made me sad. I mean I was just costume shopping at Easley's and really could have used a large Thai cerveza. Rickie loved his Thai iced tea (me? not a fan of that beverage...sort of tastes like lawn clippings and cream). The service is outstanding...attentive, friendly and efficient. That pushes them from 3 to 4 stars easily. Great energy, good food, smiling staff. I'll be back.

Review Noir

It was one of those nights when every drinking party ends in a fight.  A desert wind was blowing through the streets that night.  It was a hot wind that pulled insistently at your clothes and made the hair on the back of your neck stand up.  The streets were quieter than a dead cat under the guardrail aside a moonlit mountain road.

I was wearing my olive drab shorts and a black "Kill Your Television" t-shirt, I was sober and I didn't care who knew it.  I was everything an after-work regional manager ought to be and I was calling on Best of Italy.  She was exacting, charming and ruthless in the size of her slices.  I was feeling like a kid that likes to pull the legs off of spiders.  No more sense of morals than a downtrodden puppy.

She's a grifter, a voice barked from the back of my mind.  Maybe she is, I thought, but what does this five-dollar special want?  Behind the flash, behind the smile, was there nothing but poison under that sauce?  I had to know, even if it meant the big sleep by morning.

I tried her slices and they were good.  No, they were more than good and held that inner truth.  You know the truth I'm talkin' about.  The truth that makes you aware of just how aware you are. You know the world belongs to men like you, men who act as if it's a right to great pizza.  Pizza like this.  The truth that tells you the world would be a better place and not too dull to live in if there were more pizza like this around.  Because you're a part of it now, see?  The crust and the sauce and the cheese and the toppings...they're in you now and you can't go back.

This review is long overdue! A friend of mine gave me a gift certificate for a pedicure so I called for an appointment and got placed with Tami. 

My experience was relaxing from start to finish. Tami (the owner) is very friendly and good at what she does. She had recently opened after years of working in the hotels doing luxury pedicures. She has brought her experience in that arena to the strip mall. If you're looking to be pampered with a high end spa quality pedicure without breaking the bank, this is your place! 

The pedicure that I had was amazing! The products that they use are high quality along with the heavenly smells... Let's just say I could get used to treating myself to a pedicure at the Mirror Mirror Salon on a regular basis. I really loved the fact that this salon uses hygienic liners in the bowls where you soak your feet. It's so important, I can't stress this enough! I contracted flesh eating bacteria at a high end nail salon in NYC and I could have lost my toe or worse. After that, I refuse to go anywhere that doesn't use them and finding places that do can be difficult. If I were you, I'd consider going to Mirror Mirror for that fact alone... 

Now as for the high quality products I was mentioning, I'll give you a little play by play. They use a callus softener on your feet followed by a brown sugar souffl scrub. Then comes the glycolic acid mask and healing foot mousse. After that I received one of the best foot massages ever with a rich, moisturizing body butter followed by their yummylicious vanilla paraffin wax.

I made sure I thanked my friend profusely for the gift certificate. I'll definitely return and I recommend checking out this salon. If you do, make sure to say hello to Tami for me. She's great!

Looking down & spying the bright "Red Velvet Cafe" sign from the upper floor of the Fashion Show mall had me doing a quick search for the closest escalator. If one wasn't nearby, I was considering jumping over the rail and Spidermanning it down to this beacon of red velvet in the middle of a mall. Was I bored with shopping? Sure. Was it time for Red Velvet? It's ALWAYS time for red velvet, foo.

Well, guess what? This isn't just any old corner bakery red velvet cupcake or Grandma's Christmas cake either. It's a Vegan Red Velvet Cake. Yep, VEGAN. Giddy-up cause I'm getting one to eat right then and there. The lady at the counter brought it to our table with two forks and couple glasses of water. The individual cake costs $5.50 and is perfect for sharing or just eating by yourself. Olivia Z. and I split it since we were heading to a buffet in a couple hours.

Soooooo... how was it? Oh, you mean the Vegan Red Velvet Cake. It was great. I don't know how they do it without butter and such, but the flavor was rich, the cake moist, and the frosting near perfect. If you are sick of the uber-sweet fake red velvet at your local supermarket, the Vegan Red Velvet Cake at Red Velvet Cafe is a treat. 

Sure, they have other stuff like sandwiches, salads, coffee, and juices, but save room for a healthier and yummier take on a classic American dessert - the Red Velvet Cake.

Most of the time I am a tourist and eat on the strip when I come to the Ninth Island (Vegas).  However, on this trip I had my car and I wanted to eat where the locals eat.  Japanese Curry Zen is on Spring Mountain Rd, in the Seoul Plaza strip mall West of the 15.

They specialize in authentic Japanese curry here, that is hand stirred and silky smooth.  Curry and rice is $5.95 and you can add chicken or pork cutlet ($3.50), kushi (chicken; quail eggs (3); & zucchni - $3.50), and a variety of other toppings for an additonal charge.

We ordered the tempura oyster app ($3.60 for 3), tonkatsu ($9.45), and the foregoing w/ kushi ($12.95 - not pictured).  A can of soda was $1.

The oysters were excellent.  The tempura was cooked very well, and the oysters were fresh.  I have had overcooked, not so fresh oysters and they disintegrate when you bite into them.  These were nothing like the foregoing:  5 Stars.

Likewise, the curry was excellent.  You could see and hear the chef constantly stirring the curry sauce to perfection.  Secondarily, the color was perfect.  In addition, the pork cutlet was cooked properly.  It was not dry like other places I have experienced.  Lastly, the portion was a bargain for the price.  BTW, I ordered 3 out of 10 for spiciness, and I was SMAO:  5 Stars.

The service from our waitress was also excellent.  She was super nice, described how the menu worked, and really attentive:  5 Stars.  The ambiance is very basic, but it works for this small place.  Although the place is small, there were separate, clean restrooms:  4 Stars.

If you have a car, forget the overpriced, Americanized Azn food on the strip, and head to Spring Mountain Rd (I would compare to Garden Grove Blvd in OC).  In addition to Japanese, there is Vietnamese, Chinese and Korean.  The food is way better, and less expensive especially at this gem, Japanese Curry Zen.

As I walked up to will call about thirty minutes to showtime, I was astounded at the line of people to the right of the Crown Theater entrance.  "Damn! Is it like this every night?" I asked the box office person.  "Every Saturday night." he said.  You'd think that the actual "King of Pop" himself was about to hit the stage.  Fortunately, I had golden circle seats and avoided all of that.  Maybe tip the guys working the front to get in early and dodge that whole debacle or fake an injury, start limping and tell them you need to be seated immediately.  It was 90 percent full.    
    
MJ's Live?  Four different cast members play him throughout the week.  We were fortunate to see Justin Dean.  The moves and mannerisms were as believable as they could possibly be.  To his credit, I had a hard time telling when he was actually singing or lip-synching.  He would switch from singing into his headset mic and then to a regular handheld throughout while still wearing the headset which was kind of weird but whatever.

The audience took everything over the top.  One guy at the table up front was sporting a full on MJ Jheri curl hairstyle with sunglasses that he wore the entire time.  At another table was an adorable 3 year old with his own plastic mic that danced his face off, and even did some pop star poses with the guitar player.  Then there were the folks looking for a complete suspension of disbelief and going batshit crazy the whole hour.  "OMG! We luuuuvvv you Michaaaaaaaaal!"  Someone needed a Pepsi.

I can't find the exact word for all of it, but there was a fun, schlocky, "am I really being entertained by this right now?" vibe to the whole deal.  Kids would love it.  3.5 stars.

Is this place selfie worthy?  Why, oh yes!!!

I didn't think I would like this place because I hate their commercials.  I feel like swinging punches when I hear that awful club music...but anyway, this place is actually gorgeous!  Weird and gorgeous.  Class meets obnoxious, that's the best way I can explain the decor.

The moment you walk in, you are greeted with a very perfume-y aroma, it smells luxurious and clean...not like a Vegas casino. We walked by the Book and Stage bar.  It is a lounge with a Library theme, and you can count on the Cosmo to make a library look hip and cool.  The books are not real, but projections of books on glass walls and pillars.  Awesome!  

The hotel has all kinds of nooks and lounges to rest your feet, with plush seating and gorgeous, rich colors.  The Vesper bar reminds me of a bar Superman would go to.  It reminds me of his icy lair.  We've found several giant stilletos and a group of dog statues on the same floor.  So unusual and memorable!  Strangers (drunk at noon, like us) were egging me on to get in one of the giant stilletos and pose for pictures, I'm surprised I didn't fall out!!

The Chandelier bar is the heart of the hotel, it is definitely a must see when you go to Vegas.  I've also heard of the Secret Pizza lounge, but we were already too messed up from the drinks at the Wicked Spoon and at the Chandelier bar to find it.  I heard it's inside a hallway with vinyl records and that the pizza is the bomb!  Too bad we didn't find it, but we will definitely check it out next time!

I love that it's hyper local. I love that they get creative with the brews. The look of the place is very modern compared to other tasting rooms, which tend to be smaller and more traditional. Oh yea, and there's some solid beer on the menu!

About the only problem is the seating space. There isn't much of it. Also, is it a tasting room? A bar? Not sure. I've never seen a tasting room with flat screens playing sports.  Plus, it was tough to squeeze people in here on a Friday eve. Should this stop you from coming here? Hells no. But if you're with a crew, def call ahead or come on an off night. 

Beer novice? The servers are helpful and can guide you through their various brews. I suggest going for the 5 beer sampler for $10. Not only do you get a chance to taste half of the menu, you get some specialty popcorn, which is certainly welcome in between beers. My favorite was the dill pickle. 

I'm happy to have these guys in DTLV and I can't wait to taste all the future brews from BB. Well done!

Protip: Call and find out when it's 2for1 growler fills. I believe it comes out to $11 for two growler fills. That's an insane deal. Also, take the tour!

Seriously good  Japanese comfort food (robata grill) combined with outstanding artistry.

For starters, agedashi tofu.  Sublime; fried house made tofu bathed in a heavenly flavored dashi base topped with briny salmon roe.

From the robata grill, Kurobuta pork cheeks (face, not butt, sweet porky goodness),  enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon (smoky richness), "Kobe" fillet with wasabi (tender, wasabi brings out a mineral earthiness and sweetness), "Kobe" skirt with garlic (razor thin slivers of garlic mixes with melting beef fat), and if they have it, teriyaki foie (orgasmic flavor explosion that goes on and on).

Finally, the kaiseki meals are incredible.  They feature small portions of the best of the robata grill mixed with delicacies not offered anywhere else on the menu.  Some of the dishes are out there.  One night offered sea snails another foie chawanmushi.  Both surprisingly delicious.  Keep an open mind.  The progression of courses in flavors, textures, and temperature is well thought out.  Well worth the $100 or $150.  

Note:  three day advance reservations required for the kaiseki and all members of your group need to order it.

Tip:  always ask if there are any off the menu specials.  Depending on how much they "like" you, you may be in for a real treat (sorry, it's an Asian thing).

Good selection of sake at all quality and price levels. 

Needless to say, highly recommended.

My favorite free attraction in Vegas.  Yes, even beating the street people giving out cards with naked women on them J/K ;p

The Fountains of Bellagio are located in the heart of the Strip, where visitors can enjoy a beautiful display of water being shot high into the sky, in tune with music.  
http://www.vegas.com/attractions/on-the-strip/bellagio-fountains/

Strolling along the Strip, especially at night, it's a great sight to behold, whether with friends or your significant other.  Last time I was there, we saw the Fountains with Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" playing.  Later on, on the way back to our hotel, we saw it again with Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On".  Such an extravagant spectacle for the senses!  There's just something about an oasis of moving water right before your eyes in the middle of the searing desert,  music tickling your tympanic membranes.  All for free!

Great views from the front of Bellagio, or when dining at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  The show runs every 15-30 mins, with the start times depending upon the day.  

You can't miss this attraction at the Strip, literally & figuratively.  I know when I'm in Vegas again, I'll certainly enjoy checking out the Fountains of Bellagio several times more.

Highly recommmend!

I was very impressed with ZiKiZ and found it because of its great reviews on Yelp. I'm normally a little reserved when it comes to trying new things like the concept they have going on here, but I'm so glad I finally gave this place a shot. 

I had a bowl with ZiKiZ rice and steak. I added a little hummus and tabouli together with jalapeos, tomatoes, red onions, green pepper. I topped it off with the ZiKiZ sauce that was a sort of garlic vinaigrette. After my first bite I was sold. All of the ingredients went so well together. And this is coming from a food "separatist". I'm never a "mixer" and now I may have to rethink that whole strategy because I've probably been missing out.

Thanks ZiKiZ for making me see the light. Speaking of light, the food here is lite and healthy. It's a refreshing change when eating fast food. They also sell some gluten free, protein enriched desserts which looked tempting. I will definitely be back.

This place is amazing. I'm not sure if i loved it so much because of how much i drank or if it really is as good as i remember but either way it hit the spot! 4 friends and i were leaving a concert at the boulevard pool and decided to finally try this place out. We got a large cheese pizza with banana peppers and sun dried tomatoes as toppings. So good. It was a bit greasy but after blotting that away it was near perfect. some of the best pizza in Vegas for sure. I like the whole gimmick of it being a "secret" too.

When Ken M told me about his idea to have a UYE for the Buffet of Buffets ($45.99) and do it in 1 day, I thought it was a great idea.....so I told him if he did it, I would be there.  Well, the day finally came and 7 of us embarked on a journey to accomplish this task on a Saturday in March.  I wrote a review for each buffet we went to (links to each review below).  The schedule is below:

Breakfast

9:00 am - Caesars Palace: Lago Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/lago-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:ab5b7QIzLhhN_ixM5s1yrQ
10:30 am - Flamingo: Paradise Garden Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/paradise-garden-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:gBCZai1zqnPpWw-q0zyt0w

Lunch

12:00 pm - Imperial Palace: Emperor's Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/emperors-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:t-h1fgV4T-Lvin80jWxbPg
1:30 pm - Harrah's: Flavors Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/flavors-the-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:5mGaPZ_ukWUoVg2GttnHZA
3:00 pm - Rio: Carnival World Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/carnival-world-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:8xW8Mr61rcZ9SsJyG8uK_w

Dinner

5:00 pm - Paris: Le Village Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/le-village-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:m2YKMThWKZYkLXtt_0zNpA
7:00 pm - Planet Hollywood: Spice Market Buffet
http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-spice-market-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:T3hJAv1ROUL5uVY92C2o4A

I had a plan to pace myself so I could enjoy the entire day of buffets.....well, of course that plan went out the window with Buffet #1.....and it was downhill from there....I was stuffed by the time we were done with the Flamingo Buffet.  Needless to say, I gained 5.5 lbs after this ordeal.....and I'm still trying to work off the lbs in the gym.

Overall, it was a fun time and I recommend giving it a try at least once.  The schedule we had was perfect and we were on time for every buffet, except the last one.....but that was because there was a concert that night at Planet Hollywood and it made parking a little longer than expected.  If I was to do it again, I'd only go to 3 Buffets.....the Rio, Harrah's, and Planet Hollywood.  I'd have Dinner at the Rio & Planet Hollywood, and Lunch at Harrah's.  Those were the 3 best buffets out of the group and you can easily fit 3 of those in a 24 hour schedule.

The 7 in one day was very agressive and I won't do it again.....but I don't regret participating in the event.....all of the Yelpers in our group had a blast.

Return Factor - 80%

So the crowds and general euphoria seemed to have died down since the opening of Sidebar six months ago. After more than a dozen visits to this lounge, I'm confident of my four star rating. In agreeing with what Kristin told me once, yes, Sidebar is very much what would happen if Roosevelt and Fez had a baby, at least design-wise.

The environment, decor, and drink offerings rock. A few quick notes to illustrate:
* Exposed brick and stairway entry that would make any East Coaster drool. 
* Cozy C-shaped booths for lounging. 
* Requisite absinthe dispenser in the middle of the bar and TV screens showing old films to indicate urban trendiness. 
* Kim Crawford sauvignon blanc by the glass, Anchor Steam by the bottle
* White space-age-ish 4-seater tables and multi-colored LED panel thrown in for good measure.

In a few birthday parties here, I have gotten different results. For mine in January, they gladly reserved a booth for my besties and me on a Friday at 9 pm. Of course, no signage or anything, so it was a bit of a hassle to say the least as the owner, Josh, gladly asked people to move. The next month, we ran into some resistance on reserving, but were able to manage it due to our own efforts.

Overall, service has definitely improved. Although, be sure to watch your drink as ambition can get the best of them - they took away several of our half-finished glasses when we weren't looking.  One complaint to the bartender, and this was fixed. 

A new and appreciated detail is their drink menu featuring some unique cocktails. One request would be to beef up their appetizer offerings.

There's dining in the dark, and then there's wining in the dark. Yes, it's so dark in here that you won't want to bother trying to read their bible of a wine list - just ask your server for some recommendations. And because it's so dimly lit in here, it's a great spot for getting cozy and romantical with that someone special. The space is quite hidden, but once you make your way inside, you'll find a pretty huge space. There is tons of seating, so it's also a nice wine bar for gathering with friends. 

There's live music or a DJ on a nightly basis, so you not only get wonderful wines here, but a fun atmosphere. It's one of those places that you can spend hours on end at, but mix it up and have a nice dinner before or after at their sister spot around the corner, Cowboy Ciao. Makes for a perfect date night!

Try their Boom Boom Syrah and get a mix of cheeses and meats to nibble on. Great thing is that you don't have to worry about having purple teeth or food on your face. Your date won't be able to notice it at all!

We really liked Hopdoddy's fresh new variety, but found the burgers themselves a little bland.

One hiccup on our visit, as others have noted, is the service. Too many unsupervised newbies and not enough chiefs on the floor. When we arrived, we were told to wait for our greeter who would then take us to our table.  Then we were told to walk up to the counter and place our order. Grrrr

The problem was exasperated, since there was no permanent greeter. The longer we waited, the more the folks behind us started getting upset since they were outside in the heat and didn't understand the holdup.  I hope it's been fixed by now.

BTW, we very much liked the updated Philip Johnson style glass house architecture. Who would have ever thought of building a glass restaurant in the desert?  Incredible. 

Hopdoddy has a bunch of interesting choices on their menu. And, it's those choices that provide the taste for their burgers, not the meat itself. The food is very good and reminded us a great deal of a Fox Concept's Zinburger. Both offer something interesting for the palate. 

Expect to pay $20 each for drinks, burger and one appetizer.

I love America. I love tacos. Not always in that order, but let's continue. I've been a few times already. And have yet to order a taco. That's because America's Taco Shop could easily be named America's Quesadilla Shop. But, we know, that wouldn't stick. I've had the carne asada quesadilla with lettuce, guac and monterey jack. Definitely on the smaller side, but hey, it's $4.50. And then there's that Mexican Coke. Pricier than the U.S. Coke. Oh. Wait. We're talking beverages here folks. I left the 80s behind years ago! Yep. Mexican Coke has REAL sugar and not HFCS. I"m not a real anti HFCS kinda guy...but let's just say, this Mexican Coca Cola really rocks my meats and cheeses! But, it's $3. So you gotta feel in a fancy lunch mood. My last visit I added an order of chips and salsa. All said, with tip, was over $13. 

A little pricey. But I didn't mind. Kind of like buying Kiehl products at Neiman's. Or a brick of brie at AJs. Or the expensive toilet paper with chamomile and lotion. Worth it! Especially the latter. I"m just sayin'!

Great service. Friendly, if not a bit too aggressive. Last visit Miss America herself was there with her cute and chatty daughter. I loved it! Though my kids are limited to a Schnauzer, I like seeing family together in the biz. 

America. America. God bless your tacos. From sea to shining sea. From 7th St. to 7th Ave. God shed your guac on me....

FOOD POISONING

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, especially after being a huge fan of this place. But 3 out of 4 people in our dinner party Tuesday night ate the hamburger sliders. My fiance..who has an iron stomach had a little stomach ache Wednesday night, but my friend and I at about 2 am both were doubled over in severe pain and I finally went to urgent care. All symptoms I have been experiencing point to E Coli...if I am wrong on that its still definitely food poisoning bad enough I was put on antibiotics and told not to return to work until Monday (I work in a kitchen and its health code) besides I barely still have enough energy to walk my dog let alone work. I have lost 600.00 in wages due to this and been completely miserable. I called the restaurant and they were very apologetic and tried to be accomodating saying they would take care of us the next time we came in...but I am still out basically a whole months rent because one of their cooks didn't abide by proper cooking procedures and health codes. I am worried how many other people are sick from them this week and IF Firefly did in fact take the sliders off the menu until they could investigate the situation as they told me. Please contact me if you see this and were also hit with a case of food poisoning or better yet contact the health department. If FIREFLY is resolving their situation and fixing this then they wont have a problem with the health department. But if they disregard this issue then more people could be at danger which is why they must be contacted. More than 2 cases of food poisoning from the same item on the same day is considered an outbreak...I have 3 cases already. Lets protect our tourists so they want to come back. I promise that if I find out they have fixed and followed proper procedure I will update my yelp and encourage people to go back but for now I just cant.

When I'm at the New York, New York Hotel & Casino, I use to always walk by Gallagher's Steakhouse and marvel at the row of rib eyes that dropped along the top of their dry-age coolers. I promised myself that the next time I return, I'll throw a ridiculous bet on the hardway's with a couple of black chips in hopes the dice will hit the 10-1.  Haha, well don't get too excited cause it didn't happen, yet, that is...BUT instead I scored something just as good as I was kidnapped to celebrate a quick birthday overnighter in Sin City and to finally try one of Gallagher's steaks. 

So why this place...?
Dry-Aged beef is what we're talkin' bout peeps...that's right, not sticking a piece of meat in a vacuum-sealed bag that apparently also "ages" faster and in hopes to trim and reduce its water weight, hence the controversy of why very many steakhouses don't use the classical dry-aged process. As we all know time is money. Catch my drift...? 

At Gallagher's, its old school "aging'...We're talking countless hours and days of beef being stored in a special dry-aging cooler where a complex chemical reaction process that involves an intricate equilibrium of time, temperature, and the right humidity so that the beef's enzymes begins to break down and tenderize the meat. In return, Gallagher's delivers to you one of the utmost tender and most flavorful steak you'll ever eat. BOOM! 

The Eats:
Main Course:
Dry-Aged New York Sirloin $43 
Cowboy Rib-Eye Steak $45     slightly burnt edges (-.5)
Sauteed Wild Mushrooms and Carmelized Onions $2 each
Yukon Gold Potato Puree $8  meh. (-.5)

Ambiance:
Dim lighting, tranquil noise level, semi-formal attire (Sported a Hawaiian shirt =P)

Customer Service:
Product Knowledgeable, Friendly and Professional.

Tip: Make reservations. Its packed!

Peace!

This is the first (hopefully last) show I've ever attended where the headliner lip-synced the majority of their performance.  I knew going in that would be the case, but it still bugged the crap out of me.  There are a ton of Yelp reviews that mention it.  Almost none of them care and joyously devour her show like it's all you can eat ice cream.
  
Just being in the same (albeit very large) room as Britney Spears, wafting in her aura and celebrity is where their satisfaction is.  She could have been brushing her teeth on stage for all they cared.  My wife argued that I would go see Red Sox designated hitter David "Big Papi" Ortiz if he did a Vegas lip-sync/dance show and it's nothing different than this.  She's right.  I totally would.    

The scene was a sea of ladies dressed in club clothes, packs of gay men that knew the words to every song, Eurotrash, and significant others like myself that questioned whether the metal detectors at the entrance were for Britney's safety or to prevent a person like me from shooting/stabbing myself mid-show if she sang (ummm...performed?) a song like the inadvertent sex change anthem "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman".  The energy in the venue was palpable when you combined all that with the $45 "Work Bitch" caps, the homemade costumes worn, and people pre-gaming big by double fisting their $12 cocktails.

Of course I got a bunch of dudes a row up that refused to sit at any point during the show. Ballads, dance interludes, parts that she wasn't even in; they were all "Fuck it!  We're standing!  It's Britney, bitch!"  That meant we couldn't see anything unless we stood too!  So even when the majority of people were sitting during certain parts, I was still out of my seat which probably made me look like a really big fan of Miss Spears.  Puke.  I actually shelled dough out for this show so I'd be damned if I were to miss a wardrobe malfunction.  

Songs were....stage was...dancers were....screw that!  Go read other reviews for that stuff.   I didn't cross this show off my bucket list, I crossed it off my fuckit list.

Someone told me, that every time they write a Fast Food review, an Angel cries.  LOL

So with that warning, I like this Del Taco, the employees and location. I haven't decided yet if I prefer Del Taco over Taco Bell. 

The reason is their predominance of potatoes in many of their dishes as a filler. Btw, if you like French fries with ground beef and cheese on top, then this is your place. 

Like TB, Del Taco has gone down the rabbit hole of gourmet burritos, which they call "Epic". It's similar to TB's Cantina offerings, which also come in bowls if UR doing a protein diet. 

They have four offerings called Cali Steak & Guac, Grilled Chicken Fajita, Chicken Chipotle Ranch and Steak & Potato which are all priced around $5.50 and with a drink are $6.70. 

I had the shredded Steak Cali which wasn't bad. The rest of the menu is pretty basic, with the usual offerings including breakfast.   

So far my stomach is doing okay. Btw, I love the 50s tunes they play. If it wasn't for all the colorful seats and chairs I would feel like I'm in the movie Pleasantville.   LOL

Jimmy's is a long way from home for me. Even my GPS refused to find this place for me. But a quick phone call helped straighten out the directions. This place is owned by a nice couple that used to live in Chicagoland. There was about a 20 minute wait on a busy Saturday night; not a big deal for me.

Thanks to Robyn N. for telling me about this place. I was jonesing for some Chicken Vesusvio. I guess Chicken Vesusvio is a Chicago creation dating back to the Depression. So I was excited to actually have one of my favorites since I haven't been to Chicago in a few months.

I thought the pricing was fair and the dish itself was good (3 1/2 stars) but not the greatest. I would  probably try some other dishes before I ordered it again. For example, their Pizza looked awfully good as all the families seemed to have ordered pizza. I thought the service was excellent as well.

Yeah...notsomuch.

Sprinkles is sooooooooo not worth the wait . Or the chaos. Or the hype. Or the attitude from the morons who work there. Other things that are terrible about Sprinkles include...

- The cupcakes are not that great. I ordered two. The vanilla was okay, the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it.

- This place is a disorganized mess. 

- There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process. My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes. Just stupid.

- The owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions. No sane person could possibly work here without being like "um...there might be a better way to do this..."

- Also, the employees were rude. Did I mention dumb?

So get this: I attempted to order a bottle of water. I told the clerk it's 100+ degrees outside, I walked there and I'm realllllllly thirsty. The idiot at the counter told me "You can order a water here but you must wait for your name to be called to receive the water and pay for it." I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasn't anyone currently paying or using the register. Couldn't she just sell me a water? She said "NO" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word "water") on a cupcake order slip. She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up.

I was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!" 

I said "It's quite simple. Just hand me the water and I will hand you money. End of discussion." (There are the actual words out of the mouth!)

She looked really mad and also possibly terrified of me and my 5'4" 110 lbs of fury. Thankfully she handed me my water so I did not have to stab her. Which was good because I was waaaaaaaaay too thirsty to stab anyone. 

I must be properly hydrated in order to commit crimes of passion. And I'm mad crazy passionate about my cupcakes, yo.

P-ay-stee, P-ah-stee, or P-aaaa-stee, however you say pasty- it is good stuff.  When I went here with a large group of work friends, we found many interesting ways to say "pasty" and after the beers started  flowing even more ha!  If you are very hungry this is the place to go!  A pasty is similar to a calzone or an empanada but with a thin-ish pastry dough as opposed to a bread/pizza dough around the outside.  You can fill it up with any kind of yumminess you would like and the menu is full of delicious options.  

The drink menu is decent with a good selection of beers and I am a fan of their house cocktails considering 3 out of 4 of them have gin :)

The service can be slow, but they are generally nice and informative.  The patio is great for groups with bench style seating and picnic tables.  Two historic homes make up the building and  inside there is a view of the kitchen and the staff usually waves hi, which is very pleasant and inviting!

I really like this place because it has a lot of potential. One of the tweaks I would make is to get a decent honey mustard dipping sauce. Also, I thought calling out people's name in the restaurant with their food order was annoying. I guess I find that annoying because I was trying to get some reading in during the lunch break. I did like their ketchup dispenser. No more worrying about ketchup splattering on your shirt. Next time I'll have to take a picture of it.

This was my first time in a Raising Cane so I decided to order the Caniac which consists of 6 chicken strips plus a bunch of crinkle fries and a soda for about $8 dollars. I thought you get a lot for your money. I enjoyed the chicken strips but they would have tasted much better with the honey mustard sauce.

I was about to start a new weight lost challenge, but knew before that was to start I wanted something sweet and good!  I was in the area for lunch and saw that there was this sweet looking bakery at the end of the shopping center, so I knew that's where I was headed to!

I ordered the Salted Carmel Mocha cupcake to go, just from looking at it I was already drooling! You could clearly see the salt crystals on the top of the drizzled caramel!  Its my new craving, salty/sweet! Can't get enough it!

Got back to work and got to try it out! Let me tell you! The cake part of the cupcake was amazing! It was a moist chocolate with chocolate chucks inside! Yes!! Chucks!!! Yummy!!! The frosting, omg, you get a nice blend of mocha, caramel and salt!! OMG HEAVEN!!!!  This was a perfect cupcake for me!

Also for you ice cream lovin fools (I'm more of cake brownie person) they serve thrifty ice cream, I remember back in the day, that was the bomb ice cream!!  And if you have a crazy sweet tooth, they also have for sale shoots of frosting!!! Forget the cake and go straight to the sweet stuff!!!

At the very last minute before driving to Lost Wages, I booked a single room at the Microtel Inn & Suites ($70 on Orbitz).  Having never heard of the chain, I pretty much felt I was rolling the dice with this one.  But since no true tourist in Lost Wages ever spends more than a few hours in the room, I figured, what the hell?  It can't be any dingier than my last stay at Excaliber.

Well, this joint (obviously new or newly remodeled) is light years ahead of the MGM, Excaliber, and even the Mirage in cleanliness and the bed and pillows are waaaay more comfortable.  Rooms are modest, but decor and amenities are up-to-date and modern.  Amenities range from flat screen Vizios, microwaves and even a mini fridge to store your booze in to drink before hitting the casinos.  They even do free breakfast until 9:30am!

However, the BEST part about this hotel is that it's 100% NON SMOKING, so you don't get that nasty smoke stench that (despite Febreeze) seeps into the walls, carpet and draperies over time (*ahem MGM!).  It's also a few miles just south of the main strip off of Las Vegas Blvd with simple, no hassle parking right in front.  This makes it super mellow for getting in and out.

Overall, I highly recommend this place if you 1) want to save on cash, 2) don't mind staying outside the strip, and 3) want a non-smoking, super mellow place to get in and out of during your weekend of ephemeral debauchery.

Note:  No King beds.  They only do Queen Sized.  Check out is at 12pm (not 11am like most hotels on the strip)!

The Wife and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner in a relaxed environment and she suggested we dine at Verandah.  Located in the Four Seasons @ Mandalay Bay, this restaurant is a great getaway where you don't feel like you're on the Las Vegas Strip.

After browsing the menu, we decided to order:

Salad
Caprese - Beefsteak Tomato, Campania Buffalo Mozzarella, Pesto
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=KdUUseaYZ5I3jPuDCwhiWA

Aragosta - Lobster, Frisee, Seasonal Vegetables, Truffle Vinaigrette
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=3OCmQkKjb43sK0JY_bC66w

Entrees
Penne Alla Arrabiata - Smoked Mozzarella, Spicy Roma Tomato Sauce

For Dessert
Warm Italian Donuts, Lemon Curd, Chocolate Ganache

I had the Caprese Salad and the Penne Alla Arrabiata.  Both were amazing!  The Penne Alla Arrabiata was made al dente, which is how I love my Pasta and the Arrabiata Sauce had a nice kick to it....just right.  The Caprese Salad was not overdone with Oil, unlike some restaurants.

The Wife enjoyed her Lobster Salad and Striped Bass.  She passed on Dessert, but I couldn't resist the Warm Italian Doughnuts, so I went for it.....they were so good, I forgot to take a picture of them and they were gone by the time I remembered....:)

The service was impeccable.  The servers were friendly and attentive.  They were also very knowledgable about the menu and had great ideas for dinner.

Overall, it was an another awesome experience here.

I was reading in my IBD yesterday that Zoe's Kitchen was going public today. So why not write a review.

My first experience with Zoe's Kitchen was a couple of years ago at a CMYE at this location. I thought it was good but unfortunately too far from the house or work. Well, since the office moved nearby, I go here about once a week.

I order the 2 Chicken Kabobs which comes with a Greek Salad, rice and a few very small pitas. I really enjoy this meal even though I think it's a bit too pricey. I saw a couple of dudes enjoying the Steak Kabobs the last time I was in there, so I'll probably order that next time.

CHEESE AND RICE!!!!

If you only make 3 muhfuggin things, you'd better make those 3 muhfuggin things gosh darned well, by golly!

The burger was only a buck-69, sure, but it was dinky, and it wasn't going to matter *how* I used it; there just wasn't enough meat.
[insert joke about how "I'm not used to that" here...bahdumbump]

GOT DOWN SAT ON A BENCH!!!!!

I sat as the first car in the drive through, after having paid and gotten my drink, for literally 8 minutes, knowing full well that I'd only ordered a single burger and fries, wondering what the creative curses the poor folks behind me were hurling at me for thinking that I'd ordered the whole store.
Sure, it was 12:30-ish, but I watched about ten orders go out the front counter in this time.  Again, no exaggeration.   If the orders were in fact being passed out in turn, and the inside counter had gotten that backed up, that's a pretty sad thing.
Finally the food...

fuh-DANG-ah!!!!!!!      
Dem buns was greeeezy!!!

I first noticed that the inner wrapping paper had acheived that completely see-through window effect that Dr Nick recommended Homer look for as his ticket to gaining enough weight to achieve Disability status.  

I unfolded the drippy paper to find that I could literally squeeze drips of grease out of the bun like a saturated sponge, but only on one half, mind you!  The other half of the bun had edges that were hard enough to warrant 'bird-food status' for any bread product in my household.

The one napkin I'd been given was useless, since it had been purposely draped over the french fries, presumably to keep them warm(?)  Luckily, I had a stash in the car....of NAPKINS, silly.    `,8^}   

I will say, since I found that slimy thing and the cool limp fries that went with it inedible, that the girl inside was quick to offer my refund, but also quick to make it clear that she wasn't really listening to any of the comments I was providing, but instead was chosing to blow me off as Mr Angry Customer.  

I guess I had already shown my cards by letting slip a comment similar to:
 "If you only make 3 muhfuggin things, you'd better make those 3 muhfuggin things gosh darned well, by golly!" 
(but not verbatim~ahem~)

Despite the warning from a Yelp friend I had two cupcakes here.  One I really liked, but the other one not so much.

Actually, I came about this place not knowing it was the one star wonder that Janice C had previously reviewed.  I was headed toward the Monte Carlo to Bellagio tram when one of my friends spotted it.  The store was about 10 minutes away from closing so I stepped in and purchased two cupcakes at $3.75 a piece.

Most of the cupcakes here are decorated in glitter.  That alone was enough to turn away my two friends who probably thought I was kidding when I voiced the desire to actually walk in for a cupcake.

Still in my San Francisco Giants-loving mode I selected The Julius (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-pN44P-_PjRpcj4Rk2wMOg?select=os6ho_qd-sCDWrHQ7sFOKg) with its swirl of orange and vanilla buttercream on top of an orange and pineapple cake, and a Grasshopper (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-pN44P-_PjRpcj4Rk2wMOg?select=sfW64iixXLiMb9hthriMCQ) because I love the combination of mint and dark chocolate.

The characteristics of the two cupcakes were completely different from one another.  It was almost like they were created by different bakers.  The cupcakes were both dome shaped on top so the amount of frosting on each cake looked like more than there actually was.

The Julius was just bad.  While the cake wasn't too sweet, almost buttery in fact, it was a bit dry and had little to none orange or pineapple flavor.  There were itty, bitty bits of substance in the cake that I'll assume was pineapple.  The super sweet buttercream had no orange flavor either but tasted somewhat chemical like with an odd, bitter aftertaste.  My friend suggested they used actual foil to create the glitter and that was the taste I was experiencing.  I won't buy into that suggestion, but he may have had a point.

The Grasshopper, however, was very good.  The dark chocolate cake was super moist, super chocolaty and not very crumbly.  The mint chocolate buttercream tasted great but it was much thinner than the orange-vanilla buttercream.  As soon as I bit into the cupcake the mint chocolate buttercream began to roll off of the cake.  The shiny green glitter on this cake had no chemical aftertaste.

They were definitely two very different cupcakes.  Could be this is the Jekyll and Hyde of cupcake boutiques.

Vegas' top sushi restaurant.

NOT an AYCE joint.  ZERO Americanized rolls.  PURE Edo style sushi.  

Before all my sushi loving yeeps book the trip; meaning no disrespect to the Vegas food scene, Kabuto is the best in Vegas, but does not come close to touching the perfection that is the two Michelin star Urasawa in LA.  Granted, it does not come close to the $500 per person price tag of Urasawa either.

Rambling food history lesson:  This is classic  Edo style sushi born from necessity (no refrigeration in the early 19th century).  Large fillets of fish (toro) wont spoil as fast at room temperature like small fish (saba) with their bacteria filled intestines or turn rancid from their oxidizing fat (ie anago).  Yummy thoughts.  So, big fish = raw, small fish = marinated, oily fish = cooked.  Most are brushed in shoyu  and include wasabi, to inhibit spoilage.

Culinary artistry / craziness has taken over and the humble street food is now served in minimalist zen surroundings,  beautifully sauced and presented the way the chef feels it should be.  Its considered disrespectful for the diner to alter the sushi.

Although you can order individual sushi, the omakase ($80) or nigiri sampler ($48) is the best way to experience the ideal progression of flavors.

Selections change daily depending on availability.  The seafood is sourced globally.  All extremely fresh.  The chu-toro and o-toro correctly graded and a fatty delight.  The giant clam and ama ebi cloyingly sweet with the perfect oceanic finish.  Firm texture.  The list goes on and on.

Very good quality, delicately seasoned, short grain rice.  Nice compaction, holding its form but not breaking the individual grains.  

For all its refinement, this is one bite finger food (don't expect pieces of fish so large it slides down your throat and sticks out of your mouth at the same time). Toss the chopsticks aside and dive right in!

Highly recommended.

I was very fortunate to be able to stay in one of the Caesars Palace Hotel's suites a few years ago. Not only was I taken back by their amazing hotel room, but their entire Rome themed property surrounded with beautiful pools, tall marble columns and life-like statues.  I've been coming to this hotel for years, and the atmosphere never ceases to amaze me.

The property boasts tons of restaurants from gourmet to casual dining including restaurants from famous well-known name chefs such as Bobby Flay, Gordon Ramsay, and Nobu Matsuhisa along with more casual family dining such as The Cheesecake Factory and Planet Hollywood.

They also have lots of gaming space, including an immense Race and Sports Book area where you can bet on your teams or just follow the action on one of their oversized flat screens or LED board.

You could also dive into one of their five spacious, elegant pools, enjoy some relaxation in their spa, indulge in a drink or two at one of their bars or see their live performance show with the famous Celine Dion singing her greatest hits.

Another reason I enjoy staying at this hotel is for the shopping found in their Forum Shops.  You can pick up the finest apparel, jewelry and other gifts there from stores like Banana Republic, Bebe, Bath and Body Works, Christian Louboutin, Coach, H & M, MAC Cosmetics and Tiffany.  They even have an Apple store!  Okay, so I only named a handful of MY favorites, but you get the point.  They've got everything!  I will definitely be back the next time I'm visiting Las Vegas!

It is with pleasure that I bestow upon Marcellino Ristorante my coveted 5 star review                                                                                             
                       
                                    *  *  * FANFARE *  *  *             
     
Where do I begin?  How about with the amuse busch (to build anticipation in the palette).  Moments after we received the menu a plate arrived with a couple wonderfully pungent olives, several small slices of some kind of salami and 4 small chunks of what I believe was pecorino cheese.  A delicious start and we had barely opened the menu.

We shared the Gamberi e Feta antipasti.  Two HUGE jumbo shrimp (I didn't think the word jumbo really did those bad boys justice) grilled perfectly...tender and juicy.  They were served on a square of lightly fried feta cheese and a bed of cabbage.  The arrangement was so nice that I didn't want to disturb it.

After that we shared 2 entrees:

The Fagottino di Pollo and the Salmone in Crosta di Porcini con Cognac e Porri.  I am not a big fan of salmon but I could become a fan of this salmon.  Flaky, delicious fillet with a wonderful cognac sauce.  I was less thrilled with the chicken.  It was split chicken breasts layered with proscuitto and fontina cheese and smothered in a brown sauce.

Here's the thing about the Fagottino di Pollo.  When I say I was less thrilled I mean it was 4 star chicken.  Everything else about the food and service was 5 stars.  Flat out.  

We shared a couple desserts - a tirimisu and a dark chocolate mousse.  The tirimisu had all the right flavors working - mascarpone cheese, chocolate, espresso, rum, lady fingers.  Delicious.  The mousse was also very good.  Dangerously good.

Along the way we had a very well rounded chianti ( Chianti "I Sodi", Badia Morrona ) and a very nice white ( Albana "Colle Del Re" ).  Even the brewed coffee I had after dessert was very good.

Service was outstanding throughout the evening.  All in all I would place Marcellino Ristorante on the short list of Phoenix's finest restaurants.

Venturing out and trying new AYCE spots in town! 

I am really anxious when trying new places, because very rarely does it surprise...in a good way at least.  But Naka does well!

Some highlights :

Great quality nigiri here!  They had very fresh Ahi, Sake, Fresh Sea Scallops and Hamachi.  I was surprised they had Anago on the AYCE menu, and it was pretty fresh.  The Uni was a bit watery in consistency but it still had a smooth flavor/finish.

Fresh Oysters....these were great! Love the ponzu like sauce and hot sauce combination!

Soft Shell Crab appetizer. This was a large crab, cooked well, and surprisingly meaty! Yum :)

Sashimi Salad. Lots of great tasting ahi with a tasty dressing and greens. 

Fried Jalapeno Popper...surprisingly spicy! Loved the spicy mayo concoction on top.

Service was fast and friendly.  I say if you are on this side of town, you should give it a go!

The Stand is simply delicious!!!!
They will hook you up with amazing tacos, impressive burgers and all natural fries. This place is a must visit!! The service is phenomenal, ever so friendly as well as informative!! This places delivers quality and value!! My favorite is the Standard with cheese, it includes two house-ground patties offering crisp hand-leafed lettuce, fresh tomato, sliced onion, crinkle cut dill pickles, american cheese and their special stand sauce with added grilled jalapeo peppers. AMAZINGLY GREAT!! Oh and lets not forget the side of fresh cut fries and an iced cold Horchata. 
SIMPLY PERFECT!! :)

If you think the service and food is bad, just wait until you write a bad review for this disgusting, dirty poor excuse of a restaurant. My boyfriend and I gave it try because of a groupon he had purchased, and like many others that attempted to redeem it...they treated us like we were trash. I don't think they understand the concept of coupons, otherwise they would have tried to make more of an effort. The fact of the matter is, businesses use coupons and promotions to gain a regular population of customers and bring in revenue...but here at Tina's, they use it as a scam. Well it worked, my boyfriend bought the groupon and Tina's found a reason why we couldn't use it EVERY time we tried to use it. They also have little children working there so maybe they should be checked out concerning child labor laws. My boyfriend has been getting harassed non-stop for giving his honest experience with this business on yelp, not only over yelp messaging but by text message also (apparently their business phone is a cell phone and when he called to make sure the messages were from an employee they saved his number after cussing him out). They continue to be unprofessionally vulgar with the language, threatening and were very racist in their messages (calling him a dirty mexican--when he's not even hispanic) which is UNACCEPTABLE. I am ready to hear the racist and demeaning words they have for me, but I think the world should know how disgusting this place is. DO NOT SUPPORT BUSINESSES LIKE THIS, THEY SHOULD NOT GET AWAY WITH TREATING PEOPLE WITH SUCH A LACK OF RESPECT. There are so many other well-deserving, hard working, personable businesses/restaurants that deserve your time and money. And please believe me, when I get the treats and disrespectful messages because of this review it is going straight to the yelp offices and all over the internet.

Oh and btw, the person harassing us is an employee there and has written a five star review, so I wouldn't trust any of the good reviews on here. This place needs to get shut down.

Potbelly's makes a tasty little sandwich for $4.80, and an even better one for $5.00.

I was here today with some friends for their Pre- Grand Opening slated for tomorrow. A suggested donation of $5.00 went to Scottsdale Christian Academy Baseball Team (see photo). After giving my donation, I won a free shake on their spinning wheel.  All the places were food items.

Potbelly is a yummy Midwest sandwich place that has live music in all of their shops.  The older locations have tall ceiling where a banjo, or guitar player sits on the top of the booth area while playing away.  This location has a guitar playing in the corner on the right as you come in. Very cool.

As for the food, Potbelly is known primarily for their their Wreck sub which is $5.00.  It's made with salami, roast beef, turkey and ham along with swiss cheese. They also have two similar subs called:  "Italian" with capicola, mortadella, pepperoni, salami with provolone cheese, also $5.00; and a "Pizza Sandwich" which has many of the above cold cuts but with marinara sauce.  I've had both before and they are good too.

Those are their three upscale sandwiches for $5.00, but their regular ones for $4.80 are equally good.  I particularly like the Roast Beef (which I had today, see photo), but the Turkey Breast, Smoked Ham, Meatball are all delicious.  
  
I've been told by Jim their JV Manager, that their 30% larger sandwiches, called "Bigs", will be rolled out later in the year.  Nice. You also need to try their hand-dipped shakes and smoothies. Delicious!

Enjoy!

Thank you, Lonie. I appreciate you taking the time to reply. And you know my review wasn't malicious, just a factual accounting of how the visit unfolded. My brother's tip $? I wasn't aware, but I think that's how he expressed his feeling of also being non-plussed. 

Curiously, I did receive a Yelp "compliment" from a certain male related to Nosh & Swig soon after my review. This compliment simply stated, "You're a bitch." So you might want to check with your cook-husband (or other partners?) to see if they felt the need to reach out to me in that particular way. [Definitely not returning, now... Who knows what would befall my food.]

Lastly, I've had no less than 10 "thank you's" from fellow Yelpers regarding my review. Safe to say that I'm not alone in wondering where the overly generous 5-star reviews are coming from. Good yelpers aren't so easily impressed. 5-stars are rare, and usually hard-earned; saved for the highest level of culinary (and consumer) enjoyment.

Good luck and continue with the improvements. Make sure you let the good reviews happen organically and honestly. And maybe take the Yelp keys away from whomever thinks its ok to be nasty to us patrons.

OK. So I've only had a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese. I'm not a New Yorker. I'm not a bagel expert. I know the yelp debate on this culinary disc can get more heated than a black leather seat in Phoenix in July. But each time, it's perfect. Cream cheese is spread evenly on the bagel. Bagel is cut in half and wrapped in white paper. I hate the places that serve you cream cheese in a little squeeze packet. UGH! I never get all the cream cheese out and end up cutting it open and licking it out. Like the lady in the commercial squeezing ketchup packets at home into her ketchup bottle to save money.

The gentleman behind the counter is friendly and remembers my name even when I don't. The menu has pastries, hot breakfast and hot lunches. You can also grab fruit, yogurt and Snapple. There's plenty of reading material and the decor is simple yet comfortable. 

It's tucked away at City Square Plaza (gee, thus the name)...next to the Light (De)Railed Cafe. Yep. It's 86'd. 

Thanks City Square Cafe...for allowing me to make a pit stop on my way to work. Those three blocks can be grueling in the summer and it's refreshing to cool down a bit before walking 200 yards to my job.

"My eyes adored you,
Though I never laid a hand on you,
My eyes adored you.
Like a million miles away from me,
you couldn't see,
How I adored you.
So close, so close and yet so far." - "My Eyes Adored You", Frankie Vallie & the 4 Seasons

I loved "Jersey Boys"!!  The musical retelling of how the group last known as "The 4 Seasons" came to be, starting at the humble beginnings of standing underneath a streetlamp in New Jersey.  I'm a big fan of Franki Valli's music & getting to see how he became the multimillion selling, international hit singer had me hooked from the moment the lights came on.

The actor who portrayed Frankie Valli was dynamite!!!.  He hit those high notes like a champ.  To me, he resembled the Brazilian race car driver, Helio Castroneves.  The supporting cast also did a magnificent job during the show.  We had primo seats, 5 rows from the stage, in Row D.  Looking around, all the seats seem to have a good view, but I must say I loved my vantage point.  

FYI, there is typical "Jersey talk" used during the show, aka profanity, & there is also some gun action/blood.  Therefore, I wouldn't recommend taking the little ones.  There is an 8 minute intermission with a handy countdown timer displayed on the stage, for those wanting to make sure they get back just in time.

I defy anyone not to sing along & have the catchy songs of Frankie Valli & the 4 Seasons in their head for the rest of the night & the day after, as well.  I immensely enjoyed "Jersey Boys" at Paris Las Vegas from beginning to end.

I highly recommend you come & catch a performance of one of the greatest shows on The Strip!

This show features so much pussy! 
And by pussy, I mean kitty cats. 
Sorry, I couldn't resist. 

Popovich Comedy Pet Theater runs mid afternoons Tuesday-Thursdays (closed Wednesdays) in the somewhat low budget, not too spectacular V Theater inside the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile shopping center. 

If you're a pet lover then you'll probably enjoy this show. Popovich personally trains every animal that appears on stage and what's even more impressive is all the animals are rescued.  

As far as the show goes, it's just a hair over an hour in length and has some pretty cool moments. Besides being an excellent animal trainer, Popovich is also an experienced juggler. 

However, there are quite a few dull moments in this show. Popovich also had a few guys in his show who try their best to entertain the crowd but they are nowhere near as entertaining as Pop. 
Also some of the animal segments are a bit boring. The highlight of this show is definitely when the cats are on stage. It's amazing that Pop has been able to train these kitties so well. 

Normal price of admission is about $42 a person. Luckily for my wife and I had a coupon for buy one ticket, get one free. I'm glad we had that because I would have benn disappointed if I would have paid $100 for this show. 

I don't regret watching the show, I actually had a pretty good time, I just think $100 would have been way too much for a not so amazing Vegas show. I'm so thankful we had that coupon. If you're an animal lover or are looking for a kid friendly show, check out Popovich and his show.

I went here to see the Coyotes play my home town Chicago Blackhawks. The place was sold out and consisted mostly of Chicagoans. I had no problem high fiving fellow fans after each of the 5 goals that the hawks scored. And of course they won going away that night. I guess it's a sad commentary on society in general when you have to go through a metal detector to go into the stadium. 

I had excellent seats since they were about 10 rows from the glass at the faceoff circle. I was positioned near the Coyotes net to see most of the Hawk's goals. The lines at the concession places weren't too bad but I'm pretty ticked that the dude as we entered our section wanted to see my tickets. I guess he wanted me to juggle my food and drinks in the air while I fished out my tickets from my pocket. He saw my "Are you kidding me look" and explained that they were sold out. I explained to him that I've gone to plenty of sold out games in Chicago without the attitude from the Stadium staff. How can the management expect fans wanting to pay $10 bucks for parking plus $80 plus dollars per ticket and still wanting to endure the hassle of their staff inside? Management might want to think about that for awhile.

Pro tip about going to the game. Don't expect to get any free pizza from their cheerleaders when you're wearing the away team's colors. Getting out of the parking lot was fairly easy as well. Also, thank goodness that cell phone reception is a little inconsistent near the ice so you don't have to listen to people on their phones.

I'm so grateful we have a new children's museum in Las Vegas. This one is definitely my favorite family friendly activity and a step up from the previous museum (Lied Children's Museum) in every way. First off, it's located in a much nicer part of town. They have their own free parking structure. No more parking your car in the triple digit heat near a questionable area. Much more square footage and many more exhibits that engage the minds of our next generation. It's on the pricey side so I'd highly recommend the annual pass. It's worth it. There's two lines when you enter, a members line and general admission. Not really sure why they separate the two since they both seem to move at a glacial pace. I think having more staff at the front would be very helpful. 
It's easy to lose a few hours here. There's so much to do and see. Smith's, Jamba Juice, a mechanic shop, bank, airport, veterinarian, puppet show, pirate ship, the traveling exhibits...my kids just love it here. Water world, young at art & toddler town are especially popular with my kiddos. I like that they kept some stuff from the previous museum. The tornado simulator & the demonstration "Cold Science" were always crowd pleasers. I just wish they would've made a larger picnic area or included a cafe. A few tables and a soda machine are not what I had expected.

This review is for the casino and restaurant areas only.

I came here to meet two friends at the Griddle Cafe the morning they were open.  After breakfast, I took the time to roam the property and see the restaurant selection and make note of places I want to come back and try.  

The casino area was not very crowded until I was leaving because i had arrived so early.  The line for The Code--their slot club--was very long wqhen I left.  The casino is rather small compared to what it was when the hotel was the Sahara.   The emphasis here is less on gaming and more on food and entertainment.

The place has been nicely redone.  The porte-cochre is completely different and has a sculpture called SAM, for Philippe Starck's idea of Sam Nazarian.  It, along with much of the interior was designed by Starck.  He's not a fan of traditional Las Vegas slot machine toppers so he designed the faces that have tongues.  He also used Nazarian's girlfriend as a model for the entrance to Cleo.

This is a place worth coming back to for restaurant trying.  I'm not sure the LiFE Club would be something appealing to me and it wouldn't be my first choice for gaming.  But the restaurant lineup looks enticing on its own.

Suck it up.  I have a love/hate relationship with this place.  I love their quirky drink names, the sleek packaging, and how there's more than just boba [gobi poppers and nunu yummies] you can add into the drinks but man do I hate the way they run things!  

This place is always busy and the line spews well past their awkwardly placed pillar and into the rest of the food court.  They should probably utilize some kind of name system or order number because if you're not paying attention, someone can walk away with your drinks.  Two smooch-sized [large] drinks costs about $12 which is like $2 more per drink than any other boba house around the valley but you pay for the convenience of having bubble tea inside a nicer shopping mall.  

Since it's always so busy, their bobas are always soft and chewy --- I dig the freshness.  I'm loving the yogurt gobi poppers.  Explosive!  Another good thing about the place is you can choose what kind of sweetener and creamer for them to use.   Truvia?  Non-dairy creamer?  Yes please!  The menu isn't as large as everyone says but since they did go with a clever naming system, you can't just go, "I want a taro boba."  You would have to comb through the menu and see that it's called a Purple Haze.  This can be a bit confusing but you'll get the hang of it.

Anyways, Boba Tea Company is definitely a trendier bubble tea place and I'll probably come back again and again when I feel like standing around for 15 minutes to order and receive some drinks.  YOGURT GOBI!  WOO!

Let me first get one thing out of the way: you don't come here for ambiance, as the restaurant has a very basic look both inside and outside. But if you want really good, authentic Sichuan and Cantonese style cuisine, this is the place to go. You'll find many intriguing dishes listed in the menu and the staff will be more than willing to help you out with the less familiar dishes, but you will definitely be pleased with what you'll get. The prices are very reasonable, considering the quality and quantity of the food you'll get. And remember that if you find the spicy boldness of Sichuan cooking a bit daunting, you can always choose the more delicate and highly flavorful Cantonese dishes.

 Be aware that the entrance to the parking area in the rear is easy to miss. The restaurant entrance itself is at the back of the building, just beside the parking area. And if you don't care to drive, here's good news - especially for the ASU people who would love to have excellent Chinese food at a nearby place and who are on a limited budget: the restaurant is just steps away from the Apache Blvd / Price Rd / 101 station of the light rail, across the street from its park-n-ride, so it's easily accessible! http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_Dvh5A3C9EOzil1C6YeJUw/l.jpg

Maybe it was just an off night but I'd have to agree to disagree with all the glowing reviews of this place. I think people might be fans because of the HUGE wraps. I saw them making one and I was amazed at the portion size! But lots of food ain't my style... especially if it is lots of crappy food! Tasted both of the shawarmas and they were drier than the Sahara desert plus gristle. Adding tons of tzatziki couldn't even save my meal. Their food didn't seem fresh to me at all, which is one of their selling points on their website. Either things have gone downhill, or it just wasn't in the cards for me tonight. I was really disappointed with their food and what I ordered. I really wanted to like Parsley Mediterranean Grill since it's local and I heard good things but I probably won't be back. The extra star is for the service and the chocolate dessert as both of those were good.

The reason I stay at the MGM Grand is that I'm familiar with it. 
Things I like
Housekeeping is friendly and efficient
Great view of the strip from most rooms 
The Studio Caf for breakfast- Best Lox ever! 
Many really good restaurants 
Maintenance crew responds well.
Photos of yesteryears stars hanging on the walls-Wow did they know how to dress. 

Things I don't like
Horrible water pressure- unfixable
Nasty looking couches in our room
Broken shower handle, so no hot water- until I called for maintenance
Broken hair dryer
Broken lock on our door- until I called for maintenance
No Internet until I called for maintenance 
Requested a King bed, got two queen beds 
Room service doesn't pick up in a timely manner. Wine glasses in hall for 3 days. 
Poor hotel maintenance- Ice cream drips on the beautiful brass elevator doors, never cleaned in the 5 days we were there 
Robot staff at front desk.  
Real Lions on display in a glass enclosure -I get the connection, just don't approve
The rainforest area with all its dusty plastic plants.  
I don't expect cheesiness at a hotel of this caliber 
I also expect to be pampered in a Hotel like the MGM. 
Things seem to be going downhill at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. 

But all in all, I had my family with me and that makes everything perfect 
We had a blast playing together. Happy 21ST Birthday Grandaughter 

Now please excuse me I need another nap.

This marathon has gotten a bad rap. 

I have many friends & co-workers who have run the Rock n' Roll marathons in other cities. Most of them would probably unanimously agree that the Vegas is the one of the worst. Their opinions are ones I trust. 

This was my 3rd year running the half. Is it chaotic? Yes. Disorganized? Expensive entry? Yep. Would I run it again? Absolutely. So if it's so bad, why am I giving it 4 stars? It's just that fun!

When I read the other reviews to see what most people hated, don't get me wrong, they are legitimate complaints. What's my biggest suggestion if you're reading this, thinking of running it for the first time or trying it again next year? READ THE EMAIL. They send runners a final informational email to explain everything, showing maps of where to park to explaining where families can reunite with the marathoners they finish. Is everything strictly enforced, like the corralling? No. Do they have the best course support? Probably not. But a lot of the headaches can be avoided by reading your email and planning ahead. If you race, you know - something always unexpected happens on Race Day!

There's nothing like running down the Strip at night. I'm going to run other cities in the future and enjoy it for what they offer. This is what we offer and I just appreciate that we can hold something so unique. It's one of many things that makes Vegas... VEGAS!  That's just me, take it for what it's worth. I have fun and if you run it, you can make it a blast, too!

The Signature at the MGM is another great place to stay. The hotel is a smoke free hotel and that was a huge plus for us. The staff were all wonderful and friendly. Another good thing was that it was connected to the MGM so you walk through the towers.
Our room UPH( upper penthouse) was on the 38th floor with a beautiful view .The room was very nice and up to date. It has a wonderful king size bed with a pull out couch bed. The bathroom had a jacuzzi, shower, and  his and her's sink and small flat screen tv. The room also has a small kitchen area. 
The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 star was that the housekeeping was lacking. We had to call 3 times for towels. 
Another than that The Signature is great place, and I would stay with them again in the future since Vegas is our second home.

The Chelsea Ballroom is located on the fourth floor of the Cosmopolitan. I came here to see a little band know as the Black Keys!!! The venue however is excellent even for a makeshift music venue. The acoustics weren't too bad, and for GA, you can get pretty up close and personal to the stage. There were seats as well, but really for a band like Black Keys, you want to do GA and rock out! Not stuck in a chair!! 

The bar scene: one large bar in the very back, two smaller bars on the side. Drinks are normal Vegas price. $7 for guinness.  $7 for fat tire. $7 for Sierra Nevada. $12 for a shot jger. Some of the bars take cash only and some take credit cards as well, so make sure you are in the right line!

The band:  Big Boi opened up for Black Keys and Black Keys were amazing!!! Such a great live band, I would definitely put them up as my top 5 favorite band to watch live. The drummer played his cymbals with a tambourine and the guitarist played his guitar with maracas!! Amazing!! If you ever get a chance to see them, please do, you won't regret it!

Oh and almost forgot to mention...tickets are purchased thru the cosmopolitan website which means no ticketmaster which means NO FEES!!! So to see the Black Keys just cost me $35 plus $0 fees!! 5 stars just for that!

I've stayed at Mandalay Bay twice and been to shows, dinner, or gamble several times and it is a solid 4-stars ... a notch below the elite of Vegas and a step above the mediocre. It's large with the full Vegas experience under one roof if you aren't wanting to explore ... with multiple pools, a plethora of restaurants, the Michael Jackson show, other concerts, standard shopping, and, of course, a casino. Resort is a better name for Mandalay Bay than hotel.

The rooms aren't elite opulence, but they are nice with functional, yet cozy furniture and large bathrooms. If you can afford it, be sure to upgrade to one of the upper floors because the views of the Las Vegas Strip are better from there. Since Mandalay Bay is currently near the South end of the Strip, rooms with a view facing north/east will be the best. The location is also really close to the airport and 15 freeway.

Overall, Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino is a solid option when visiting Vegas. If you get a good deal on a room or are looking for a one-stop shop for a large group with diverse needs then I definitely recommend Mandalay Bay.

I moved from a condo to a house 6 streets away but wanted to use movers to move the heavy furniture. I found the glowing reviews on Yelp and decided to give them a try.

I called to schedule my move in date 5 days before my move and they were able to accomodate. The representative on the phone was very nice and knowledgable, explaining everything about the process and an estimated cost based on the size of my condo and number of furniture.

They called a couple days before the move to affirm the date and time, and then the movers called an hour before the scheduled time to let me know their arrival time. The movers were all very professional, very nice, and very attentive. Any items they weren't unsure about where to place it, they asked before moving it in. They also moved a couple pieces of furniture around since I wasn't completely sure where I wanted everything to go.

Finally, I decided that morning that I wanted to switch out the washer and dryer between the condo and the house. Without hesitation, they said they'd be happy to do that, so they swapped them out and hooked them up in the two places without any complaints.

Given that I was only having them move my furniture and I moved all my "stuff" myself, I did think it took them quite a while to move everything, but that's because they wrapped all pieces of furniture in plastic wrap before loading them on the truck and were very careful with all my furntiure. I had an antique large bookcase that they successfuly moved without any wear or tear.

If you're looking for a cheap and quick place to move your stuff, this is not the company for you. But if you have good quality furniture that needs gentle care in moving between two locations, I would definitely recommend them.

Quality, authentic, hand pulled noodles and hand cut noodles in the middle of the desert!

If you're on a low carb diet, STOP READING.  Also, this is not for you if your idea of "authentic Asian cuisine" comes from a place that serves general tzo's chicken or beef with broccoli chow mien.  Skip if you enjoy eating rehydrated microwaved noodles from a styrofoam bowl.

This is the real deal.  Extremely glutinous, al dente noodles with just the right amount of surface imperfections to hold the sauce or soup.  Enough, it's just good eats!

The sliced pork and mushroom hand pulled noodles that other yelpers rave about is THE standout dish.  Loads of meaty mushrooms and tender pork.  Very flavorful, not too oily.  The beef noodle soup is also a worthy try.  Fresh herbs, ginger, garlic, chilies, and five spice create a very aromatic base for tender beef, mushrooms, and noodles.

Ultimately, the strong flavors, lack of acidity, and the lack of textural contrast fill you up quick.  Avoid the "eyes bigger than the stomach" syndrome.  Nothing worse than a carb brick in your stomach and a cloying flavor in your mouth for hours.

Note:  They use MSG with no apology.  You've been warned.

Service is OK.  Prices very low.

One of the best kept secrets in Vegas so shhhh, recommended.

I like this place for a once in awhile go to for homemade matzah ball soup! You can get it without noodles and just enjoy the goodness of soup. Probably best in town. They try to give you that deli feel we get back home but they don't put pickles on the table anymore and it's gotten further away from a NY deli thru the years. The sandwiches however are nice and thick loaded with fresh meats. The bakery section is quite small compared to others and the challah is better other places. But the food is good and enjoyable, if you get deli food, not a burger.... (Like someone at our table did....)
The customer service has been variable the times we have been there and the cleanliness has varied too. Not sure if because of how long they have been there or what but hasn't been remodeled. Depending on when you go, you can be waiting awhile too as the place is quite small. I like this place and the local business but overall it's changed a lot thru the years!

Don't let the "I used to be some sort of restaurant with a drive-through" appearance fool you - Dozo is a GREAT spot for Japanese food.  A place where the food is tasty, the staff is friendly and it is not over-styled and trying to be a nightclub.  The word dozo can be translated as "please", as in "be my guest".  My friend and I have certainly been made to feel very welcome on (multiple!) visits.  

Sushi?  Oh yes!  Consistently fresh and nicely presented.  Try the yellowtail sashimi, albacore tataki or maybe a Dynamite roll stuffed with slightly spicy scallops.  Your taste buds will thank you.  

Not a fan of fish in the raw?  No problem!  Dozo has an extensive selection of cooked items, including a to-die-for hamachi kama (yellowtail collar) served with a light, citrusy ponzu.  Wait, forget that part.  Don't order that or there won't be enough for me!  :)

If you like loud music, shot girls and lots of California rolls topped with gooey sauces, Dozo is not for you.  That is why I like it.

Five things you can do while waiting for your Showtime Shuttle to depart...

1) Learn how to crochet and make your not yet born child a blanket. After that you can procreate and give birth in the shuttle.

2) Research your entire Vegas trip via your Yelp app, as well as plan your next two vacations and 20th wedding anniversary. Sure you haven't gotten married yet, but you really do have the time to kill.

3) Give a lecture on the meaning of life to complete strangers and form your own shuttle cult. Make sure you give everyone their own glass of Kool-Aid. It's really hot and who doesn't like drinking Kool-Aid?

4) Write your New York Times best selling book on theory of time travel. Because guess what, you're never going to get this hour back unless you know that white haired doctor from "Back To The Future."

5) Write your Yelp review about your less than stellar Showtime Shuttle experience.

On a positive note they do operate late at night when other shuttles are not running, plus it's way cheaper than taking a cab. BUT the next time I'm in LV I'm definitely going to take a cab so I can get on with my life. It was a 45 minute wait until we departed and then they stop at many, many, many hotels until they drop you off.

Can I just say.....

Expedia dot cooooooooooooooooooooom

Hell-to-the-yes! I'm totally and completely in love with Expedia. I am a walking advertisement for that website and the customer support there because of the trip I just took to Vegas. After scavenging the World Wide Web for deals to Vegas for a friend's birthday I came across a few killer packages through Expedia. I ultimately called to speak with an agent and told him what we would like to spend. In about 15 minutes he had us booked in a JR Suite at the Signature at MGM, a brand new hotel that consists of three towers, 2 of which are for hotel guests and 1 for residences. Our room was on the 29th floor with a view of the strip and the room was absolutely amazing. The hotel is just off of the strip, however it is connected by an underground walkway that spills out into the MGM pool and casino entrance, as well as the entrance to the monorail. The hotel was lovely, the JR suite had a kitchenette, huge bathroom with his and her sinks, jacuzzi tub, plush, comfortable king-size bed, a Starbucks in the lobby, and three pools to choose from. The main pool is located in Tower 2, along with the Delights Cafe and each tower has it's own lobby lounge. For the price (about $200 per night), and the gracious staff, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The only thing I would mention is that they do require a $350 pre paid incidentals fee upfront that can be used to charge back food/drink to your room.

Aloha! Mele Kelikimaka! Don Ho! That's pretty much all the Hawaiian I know. I'm delighted a little bit of our island state has reached Central Phoenix. And I say little because, clearly, this is not authentic Hawaiian, nor are they trying to be. Let's start with the ugly. Cuz there's lots of good stuff to like about Hula's. Probably not the New York Steak Sandwich. Which I quickly renamed the Rhode Island Steak Sandwich. Cuz it was teeny tiny. And that's not so bad, except it was served on a large hamburger bun slathered in Hula sauce and a couple slabs of Monterey Jack and loads of Maui onions which were outstanding! It fell apart quicker than my Aunt Helen when I told her I was a mo. Wait? Have I used that line before? Anyway with the sandwich I had the cole slaw which had fresh ginger in it and I loved it! Rickie's Cajun burger and field green salad was delicious as was our friends Cobb Salad complete with diced fried Spam! And just like the islands' friendly culture, the staff here was spot on with service, smiles and suggestions. Prices on our food hovered around $10 a plate. 

Now. The space. LOVING IT! Think Brady Bunch decor meets Hawaiian lore. There's a large, kickass photo in the dining room with some 60s/70s hipsters sipping bubbly around a pool with a Camelback Mountain lookalike in the background. Sort of looked like a still from an episode of McMillian and Wife (ok, this is where I lose anyone born after 1975!). 

Much like St. Francis, I love the textures. From the tiny tile on the wall near the restrooms, to the horizontal wood paneling, the nifty lighting above the bar and of course, the dozens of tikis lining the room. Eventually the two glass garage doors were opened to a beautiful AZ breeze and we could almost feel the slight heat from the fire pit on the patio. Though I did get a bit of a stench from about a dozen gnarly, pimpled skateboarders on the sidewalk. 

This is a 3.5 review FYI Hula's. Welcome to the desert! Welcome to CenPho. And as they say in Hawaii...um...hmmm...well...I dunno....Aloha?! Yep. Aloha!

I'm a little perplexed as to how to write my review for Jerry Seinfeld's show at Caesar's Palace.  Reason being is that I won my 2 show tickets (along with my 2-night stay at the Octavius Tower) from KOST1035.  Free makes everything 5 stars!  I'll try to type something from the viewpoint of an actual paying customer.  Here goes-

Having not watched Seinfeld ever, even though it was part of NBC's "Must See TV" lineup,  I wasn't familiar with his style of comedy.  I've seen Jerry on TV every now & again, but nothing substantial to where I can form an opinion on him as a comedian.  

The Colosseum was the show location, the same place where Celine Dion performs.  I forgot the name of the opening act comedian (something Schmidt), but he killed.  I actually thought he was funnier than Jerry Seinfeld.  He made witty observations about subjects such as his mother, the 99 cent only stores and doctor's appointments.  He supposedly is a regular on "The Tonight Show", but I  haven't seen late night talk shows in a long, long time.  His set was short, but definitely wasn't filler.

Jerry himself also killed.  He made hilarious observations on relationships, marriage, kids, coffee and even restroom stalls.  He didn't resort to foul language or gross-out humor, which is a plus for me.  Shows more creativity.  I LOL'ed many, many times and felt great doing so.  After his set, he came back out & had a mini Q&A session.  Jerry was a class-act that evening.

I checked the price for tickets at Tix4Tonight when buying tickets for Donny & Marie, and they were being sold for $66.  For that price, I would recommend attending Jerry Seinfeld's show.  However for the regular $125+, I would pass.  I enjoy comedy, but not for that much money.  I'd rather see a musical act, Cirque du Soleil or impersonators for that money.  However, I did enjoy my evening and still have some of his one-liners in my head.

Excelsior!

Fantastic fries ..., but the Farm Burger was flavorless & dry. It should be renamed the Farm BoreGR. The famous Farm was totally not worth our 30-minute wait in line.

Luckily, a Hell's Kitchen Burger was much better ... thanks to add-ons of Duck Breast Bacon and a Fried Egg (both of which are on the Farm BoreGR) which complimented the Hell's Kitchen Jalapeo, Tomato, and Avocado.

Truffle Parmesan Fries (Lunch $10) 
... featured large Potato Cuts that were exhilarating without the normal oiliness of French Fries. The flavor blend of Truffle Parmesan, Truffle Salt, and Truffle Aioli was Truffletastic. Of course, at $10 you'd hope these were better than your normal burger joint fries ... and they were. (4 stars) 

Hell's Kitchen Burger (Lunch $13) 
... is one of the popular burger choices with Asadero Cheese, Roasted Jalapeno Peppers, Avocado, and Roasted Tomatoes. It would of been 3 stars except we added, for a few $ extra, Bacon and a Fried Egg. (4 stars with add-ons)

Farm Burger (Lunch $14) 
... was probably the most hyped burger on Yelp; however, despite the goodness of Bacon and ooze of a Fried Egg, this was a dry blah disappointment. Olivia wanted to return it, so, I gave her half of my HK Burger. If you get the Farm BoreGR add Avocado and Jalapeno Peppers to add any flavor. (2 stars)

Batch 19 Beer ($7)
... Bold and hoppy like Gordon Ramsay himself, this Coors-brewed Pre-Prohibition Style Lager helped take the edge off. If I go back to Gordon Ramsay ... and there is no line ... then I might just plop down in front of one of the TVs and relax with an order of the Fries and this brew.

With a slow wait and overpriced BoreGRs, the cool factor for Gordon Ramsay BurGR isn't enough to elevate this burger joint among the elite food destinations in Las Vegas.

***The rotating and constantly moving stage of Ka is very impressive; also impressive are the many cinematic elements that Ka employs, making the show feel dramatic, exciting and unique***

Ka was my first Cirque show and I enjoyed it.  The production values were great and the stage and theater were both very impressive.  The show feels like a real spectacle and with the amazing stage, Ka feels like a show that you could only see in Vegas.

There are other good things about Ka.  I really liked how they made the show cinematic.  With the music and the great lighting, there are moments in the show that feel like you are watching a movie on the big screen (the best example is when they make the stage look like its underwater and with the curtain and lighting, it appears that one of the performers is saving someone from drowning and rising to the surface--very well done).

They try to tell a story with Ka too.  It is not a great story, but the story elements kept my interest in Ka more than Mystere (which was more like a series of disjointed vignettes).  Still, after a while, I felt like I had seen enough and I got a little bored.

There are definitely some strong acrobatics, but you might not see the big and more traditional acrobatics like you would see in Mystere.  Still, there is a piece with huge moving spheres that is very exciting, suspenseful and fun.

Ticket prices for Ka are not too bad.  You can typically find tickets for a lower price than O.

The theater is nice (with a good temperature) and they had some decent concessions.  The theater is also roomy enough and does not feel as packed or hot as Mystere's theater.

I enjoyed Ka.  I am not sure if I am ever going to be a huge fan of Cirque shows, but I thought there were mainly elements of Ka that will stick with me (much more than Mystere).  With the very nice venue, the amazing stage and the great cinematic elements, Ka feels like a special and worthwhile show (definitely worth considering if you are in Vegas and looking for a good show).

Ka is in the MGM Grand, which features free parking (both valet and a parking structure--very easy to find a spot in this parking structure).

What was once 3 stars is now 2. It's the natural evolution of hotels I guess. New York New York Hotel and Casino is only 15 years old, but it looks 25 now with worn carpet, furniture, and matching down-trodden atmosphere. I've had some of my best casino wins at New York-New York, but don't feel drawn back despite generous player perks.

Once you've stayed at a few of the nicer hotels in Las Vegas, it is hard to go back to normal-size rooms, motel furniture, and basic amenities. Even so, I don't hate New York New York Hotel. It is what is has become. A lower priced hotel option with plenty of $10 tables to work your gambling magic. It is convenient to MGM and most other places on the strip. 


If you're looking for a "reasonable hotel with a cool theme" for a first visit to Vegas, then New York New York may be a great choice. It also is probably a decent option for families since kids can hit the arcade, food court, and roller coaster on their own. Otherwise, if you are a Vegas regular, foodie, or have the $$$ to spend on something nicer then you can find better hotels in LV than NY-NY.

On our receipt from yesterday's visit, we noticed: "Tell Us About Your Experience?" 

I blinked at the following question: 
"Please tell us why you were not Highly Satisfied? Be as specific as you would like?"

Here was my cut 'n paste response:

"Please know, there are many choices in the area for sandwiches.  Jimmy John's, Corleone's, Jersey Mikes, Vermont Sandwich, just to name a few; along with Al's Beef and Luke's of Chicago (next door).  We rec'd a text upsize message and decided to give you another try.  

"On our first visit, the meat (roast beef) on your Slaw Be Jo was dark brown.  On our second visit, there was garbage on the floor. I still have the pictures and your employees did nothing, when I told them about it.  It was in the Prep area btw. 

"Last night, we ordered two upsized sandwiches which were very good... Meatball & the Bobbie, along with one drink.  But, $18.26 seems at least $4 too high and that is taking into account a larger sandwich.  I really, really want to like your place, but I find it hard given the above."

Okay, here's a funny aside...  At the end of their questionnaire, they asked which social media do I use.  

The usual suspects were there, such as Facebook, Twitter, My Space (who uses My Space anymore?) and Fick'er, but no Yelp.  

I had to write Yelp as "other". D'oh!!

***update***
Our original posting was deleted by Yelp. Now this posting went from being "recommended" to currently hidden at the bottom of the "not recommended" reviews... So far, 21 users thought it was useful. Why are you hiding my review, Yelp? Could it be because I gave a NEGATIVE review based on my OWN experience? So much for being able to trust your site for unbiased reviews.
*********

Our previous review was deleted by Yelp for "violating their guidelines" so I'll post another review that only relates to our personal experience with their boarding facility.

We used Green Acre Boarding in Oct of 2013 for a 3 night stay. This place was presented as a great place for dogs... Free roam and lots of kids to play with your pups.  

This seemed like a great scenario for our 1yr old golden but our 11 year old sheltie just needed a safe place to stay. When I dropped our dogs off, I told MaLeisa that our sheltie didn't enjoy playing with other dogs (she would run away from her own loving, gentle, golden retriever brother at home) and that she just needed a quiet place to rest & observe during her stay. I was assured by MaLeisa they could accommodate that and that she would be fine.

Upon picking up our dogs we were told by MaLeisa that our sheltie "was playing in the yard with another dog and having a great time and next thing she knew, Todd was carrying her in because she had blood on her." Our dog had blood oozing from her ear, cuts across her face, was dry heaving and could barely walk. (And, "they had already washed her.") Our Sheltie collapsed in exhaustion once we got her into our vehicle. Unfortunately, our sweet girl had to be put down the following week as she never fully recovered from her injuries. 

Green Acres makes you sign a contract saying your dog will be dehydrated and exhausted upon returning home but that these are all normal results of a boarding experience. Add to that your dog will reek (which was explained away as being from the flood irrigation they use.) 

We had already pre-booked another stay at Green Acre for later in the month but obviously cancelled that stay after the injuries to our sheltie. I'm sickened and sad that I ever entrusted my dogs to the care of Green Acre.

One of the great things about living in the southwest, is how all the food traditions have followed us here. 

Want a Philly Cheesesteak? Forgetaboutit!  New Yawk deli? We've got dat too!  A Chicago dog? Abs-so-freakin-lootely! LOL  How about that Aaron Rogers and George Wendt commercial?  Grill Class, I love it!  

It seems Chicago style, Vienna Beef places are all over greater Phoenix. What you don't see too often, are these family owned places. In Chicago you have Mom and Pop places all over. Each one trying to create their own piece of heaven for their loyal customers. 

Well I believe Dazzo's is one of those places too. You come in, you are greeted by one of the Dazzo family members. Warmly! None of that phony baloney stuff. Just, "thanks for coming in!  First time here?  Where are you from?"  They also have family pictures all over the wall, going back to when they first opened. Nice! 

And if UR interested, they also have a nice collection Chicago team Sun Times clippings, mostly of the Bulls and Cubs stuff. 

Okay, this is all great Georgie, but what makes it so special?  Well, the food!  Grilled Jumbo Dogs, Red Hots, Fire Dogs, Brats, Italian Beef -- they have them all and they're cooked fresh, just for you. Delicious!

Another plus are their French fries. They're exquisite and topped with a nice mixture of seasoning salt. I'm not a big fries guy, but I might come back for some more of them. 

But when I do come back, I'll bring more Cash because they don't accept Plastic. 

Enjoy!

The Mecca.  The holiest of all things burger.  It's a west coast operation, so I only get the chance to In-N-Out once every few years (insert joke here).  But it never disappoints!

The menu is as simple as it gets - burger, cheeseburger, fries, drinks.  But don't let that fool you, there's nothing simple about it.  I'm guessing the most popular menu item is the Double-Double...two patties with two slices of cheese.  From there you can go off menu and order any kind of burger you want.  The first number is patties, the second is cheese slices.  Haven't had the chance to try a 4x4 yet, but that will be happening in the next few months.  Beyond that, you can also dabble in the secret menu and get your burger protein style (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun), or animal style (includes grilled onions and animal sauce).  It's impossible to go wrong.

French fries can also be ordered animal style, but the plain version is just as good.  One of each is even better.  And as far as milkshakes, you have to go with Neapolitan...a combo of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.

It's that simple, yet that perfect.

Fact: I schedule meetings here once at week 
Fact: I call 'timeout' during the meetings so that I can enjoy the food, free of chatter or negotiation
Question: How can I schedule more meetings?

Across from the new container park, eat. is a casual spot to grab some solid lunch and breakfast fare. I'm a sandwich first, ask questions later kind of guy, so I've yet to test out the breakfast, but everything I've had on the lunch side of things has been excellent. The free range chicken sandwich is served on a light, crunchy ciabatta with a juicy chicken breast and fresh toppings. The reuben is large and the best I've had in Vegas, the veggie burger is made on-site and the passion fruit iced tea is unsweetened, so it just has a hint of tropical flavor in it. Sold? I thought so. See ya there.  

Pro Tip: Expect to wait for a few around noon

Looking for comfort food.... Away from home.....  Where to go? Well. First, check out yelp reviews in the area, and you may be pleasantly surprised as to what you will find. I'm trying to find a place to eat outside of the infamous LV strip and I see Mike O's review which solved my quandry.

Located on Decatur, tucked away in the many warehouse and strip mall type buildings is Mr. Mama's. Simple menu, simple interior, open kitchen, friendly service, most times a wait for your table, good food! Good prices! And great and friendly Mr. Mama! 


Okay Mike !!! Chicken Fried steak. $9.75???? And enough left overs for another meal!
and the tuna melt! Whole chunks (not flakes) of albacore... Choice of cheese and a choice of soup or salad, and the clam chowder ? chowder flavored with oregano... Filled our table and tummies!

Yelp deal?  Get your deal before you go!

I'm going to have to side with the vinyl on the window.  NLS does open at 10am M-F, and thankfully for me, my second excursion to this unexpectedly spacious scuba store was fortuitous.

Walking in, I executed the traditional panoramic overview, sweeping my head from left to right, at which point I noticed Sheldon.  Throwing him a head-nod, I offered up a "What's up?" that probably sounded more like "S'up".  That is the bane of being raised on the streets of suburban Massachusetts, where the kids who weren't allergic to bee stings called the shots, and would gut you as soon as look at ya.

I mean, I wasn't actually raised ON the streets, but I did spend a fair share of my time playing near them.

I've been to a handful of dive shops here in the valley, and NLS has one of the larger showrooms.  Their assortment of gear isn't as vast as say, Sports Chalet, but its not a corporate conglomerate... and although I'm pretty sure I used that word incorrectly, as an adjective, it provided the appropriate amount of disparagement.

Interesting note... purchases over $700, if made through an approved GE Capital line of credit, will enjoy a full Gregorian calendar year of deferred interest.  Combine that with the 10% discount extended for being a club member, and that, my friend, spells savings.

For example, the regulator, oct (the yellow line and breather), wireless tank transmitter, and gigantic wrist computer I'm looking at run about $1900 combined.  Subtract the 10%, and divide principal-only payments over 12 months, factor in sales tax... minus the amortization, carry the two...

OK, I think we can all agree, I'm no math whiz.  But, if you purchase a regulator, you'll get the Equipment Specialist course for free.  That's a total prize package worth over $160 US... and I'm gonna do it... and not just because I said I was going to do it in this review... although that is mostly the reason.

And if lake diving aint yo thang, then stop by the trip and travel kiosk, located conveniently in the west wing.  NLS hosts monthly trips to San Carlos MX for only $599 pp based on double occupancy.  Here's the kicker.  You ain't staying in some musty hotel.  No my friend, your accommodations are located in an oceanfront luxury home.  That's how Antonio Banderas would roll, and gosh darn it, why should your roll have any less butter than his?  Two days of 3 tank dives are included, with an available third day of room and diving for a modest up-charge.

Have a little more chang-chang in your pocket, then consider Honduras.  Not only are they know for cigars and the flesh trade, but their diving is unparalleled.  Two words: shark diving.  Get up close and personal with the spiney blast-bots of the sea.  Only $1650 pp based on double occupancy.

All trip deposits are $500 min.  All gear can be rented at NLS.  I'm happy to have a shop, close enough to my house, to call my own.

P.S. That same GE credit card can be used at Global Bikes too.

"You better cut the pizza in four pieces because I'm not hungry enough to eat six."   Yogi Berra

Nothing beats a cheesy deep-dish pizza with all your beloved toppings.  That original pan crust is crazy delicious.  It's always busy here for a reason.  I personally love the BBQ Chicken.  If you grab it to go, make sure you toss some fresh cilantro on top for even more flavor.  Their wings are also incredible and they even throw some Parmesan on top of the Garlic Parmesan Wings for more cheesy-goodness.  Nello's pies are flavorful and packed full of calories so if you're on a diet, leave it outside and indulge.  This 30+ year-old award-winning establishment is made of love.

I think of dieting for the new year and then I eat Nello's pizza.  No shame.  No regrets.

I was in the unfortunate circumstance this past weekend of having to wake up at 630am to drive and pick up my Bountiful Basket from Ahwatukee. To help offset the sleep, I decided to grab an iced coffee from the king of coffee, Dunkin Donuts.

As I walked back to my filthy, dusty car, I got the overwhelming desire to wash it. Now, folks, on the rare occasions when I want nothing more than to clean my car or house, I try to monopolize on the opportunity, so I drove around to three different car washes in an attempt to get my baby cleaned... but as luck would have it, not one god damned place was open.

Just when my will to live was seconds away from being squashed, I suddenly remembered that there was a Groupon special a week ago for Clean Freak, and I felt like it was a moment of Nachos (see Dallas G.) so I decided to see if the Nachos Gods were on my side this day.

Well guess what, Clean Freak was open! And I was excited because that big blue tunnel was just fascinating! And what is this? $10 for the most pricey wash that cleans my tires too?? AND air freshener?? SCORE!!! And to boot, the cashier dude was in holiday spirit wearing his Halloween costume!

Now, here comes this crappy part... the wash really wasn't that good. My windows weren't clean and there was still grime all over my tires. I had to buy window cleaner. None of the dead bugs came off my grill, either.

Oh.... and the vacuum's... I honestly believe that they could have sucked an unborn child from my womb had I been carrying one. But instead it got one of the many pieces of my stereo console. I'm sure that is going to cost me good money to replace. Thanks.

Next time I have to make such an effort to get my car washed, I will just live like a filthy slob until I can find time to make it over to Danny's Family. It may cost $25 but at least my car is clean and I don't have to worry about losing my uterus.

Luci's can leap from Two Stars to Four, in a single visit!

Jaek and I recently hung out at a table in the open garage-door, inside patio type area of Luci's, and we both had a great time. (see photos)

A big reason for this was the friendly and helpful demeanor of Braden, a barista/juicista/pastryista behind the counter.
After eyeballing a red velvet cake slice with cream cheese frosting dolloped up on top that actually had *GLITTER* covering it, I asked how they made edible glitter, or if those were just for show.
He explained about pulverized polished sugar, and after I shared that I have a bonified, legit case of picaphobia (glitter - it's little tiny sharp edged peices of metal or hard plastic, you know, with a mind of it's own, an inability to wash off, a tendency to get men in trouble for indiscretions at the boobiebar, and a seeming ability to reproduce.  I think it may be alive and evil, actually), and that I was taking a huge psychological step in overcoming it by having decided that I was going to get one of those slices and actually eat my psyche's penultimate nemesis, he congratulated me and said that it was on him.  

Well, since he comped that glittercake, I felt allright splurging for a tasty, but still overpriced, big glass of fresh squeezed OJ.

I tried, but couldn't find a single expired meat or cheese item in the fridge case.  I still say it's a weird conglomeration, and a bit pricey, but if I was a local without a car, being able to walk here every couple days would be wonderful.

Oh yeah, the fine folks at Luci's have put up a nice plaque thanking the local firefighters who saved their place from destruction during Richardson's recent burn.

THIS PLACE HAS BEEN ON THE TOP OF MY LIST OF CLUBS TO PARTY AT.

THIS PLACE GIVES ME A HEADACHE
There are like freakin' 4 separate lines, how the f are you suppose to know which line you're suppose to get into. Even the staff are confused, they sent my friends on a wild goose chase and had them going up and down the stairs. 

THE STAIRS OF DEATH
When we walked in, we walked in to find that we have to walk up 3+ flights of stairs!! DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO WALK UP THAT MANY FLIGHTS OF STAIRS IN 5.5 INCH HEELS???? When we got to the top, we were ALL out of breath and my calves were on fire (it was worse than the stair master)!! 

SWEAT DRIPPING EVERYWHERE
The first floor we went to was the ever so tiny hip hop room, be prepared to have people wipe their sweat all over you because there isn't ANY room to dance. It was almost impossible to maneuver your way around the dance floor, you either had your elbows in somebody's ribs or somebody else's elbows were jabbed into your ribs. Also since that room is so freakin' tiny, it's hot as shit in there and you know what that means..EVERYONE IS DRIPPING WITH SWEAT. And what do they do when they walk by you with their sweaty asses, they wipe it all over your skin and clothes. GREAT THANKS! I wish they had a bigger hip hop room because that was just ridiculous, if not pitiful. 

UNCE UNCE UNCE
The house music area/ floor was a lot bigger and is outdoors and wasn't nearly as painful as walking through the hip hop room, thank God because I was irritated at that point. What does more room mean? It means there was more room to dance but not a lot of people were,  most people were just standing around and I believe we were the only group of people who were actually dancing (and I don't really like house music too much). O.o 

CONCLUSION
BOTTOM LINE, I'M NEVER COMING BACK HERE EVER AGAIN.

I was really excited about this place. The reviews were solid. 
When I looked on their site I was drawn to Justin's work for specific reasons, especially the way he tattooed trees.
I went there with the intention of talking to him and setting up an appointment.
As I started talking about what I wanted (a tree coming from my mid forearm down onto my hand, lots of detail, etc), he basically just cut me off and explained to me that he hates tattooing trees. He said he gets at least one person a week inquiring about a tree tattoo and how he just hates them and doesn't feel inspired doing them. One of his co-workers walked in and Justin said something along the lines of, "Oh he hates doing trees too" and the guy said, "uhghhh I f*cking hate trees". 

Now lets be realistic, I am sure if I were a tattoo artist I wouldn't be too jazzed about tattooing the american flag on someones shoulder or a bald eagle on their back but I wouldn't put down someone's interest. I would simply explain that I would recommend someone else, but I wouldn't just blatantly make someone feel like an idiot.

He recommended me to go to someone else at the shop but I was so put off by the experience that I decided to go elsewhere (Ian at Club Tattoo on Country Club/US 60 is a lot nicer and actually talked to me about what I wanted).

The only part of getting tattoos that I hate is dealing with jerks who think they're far too awesome to be nice to someone with differing interests.

I suppose if I were to cross paths with Justin again I would suggest him to take down the pictures of his work involving trees because I'm sure that's what is drawing people  interested in tree tattoos to him.

Okay, I have a some rules. 

Fast food places cannot earn Four Stars. My logic is somewhat simple and straight forward; it's  due to their uniformity and universal blandness. How can one Mickey D's, be better than another or differentiated?  Close you eyes and tell me where you are. Try it sometimes. 

That said, this one is real close to being Four Stars. The folks behind the counter, Patti and Maria in particular are all very nice. They will go out of their for you and seem to really like their jobs.  Wow

I come here a couple of mornings each week, not for the Egg McMuffin or Big Breakfast; but to order two egg whites. That's right, egg whites. They're only $0.98 each, and they'll allow you to substitute them on any sandwich for free. Throw in a coffee and you'll be out the door for less than four bucks. Nice!

It UR on a diet, or just want to eat healthier, I would highly recommend it.  So "A-Okay", bordering on "yes, I'm a Fan"

This is not a big space, which is not surprising since it is tucked away in a corner of the newly-opened Camelback Whole Foods store. Therefore it might be a bit tricky to get a seat during peak hours especially if you come with a group. But the service is friendly and reasonably fast and  the food you order will come from the very active food stations of Whole Foods, so there isn't much of a wait between placing your order and getting  your food. The food itself is good, and there is a more than decent selection of drinks available. Since they're newly opened, there are still a few kinks to work out. Our group had to share menu sheets for food and drinks; there didn't seem to be enough to go around for all of us. But hopefully these small details will be remedied soon as the staff adjusts to the pace of the business and the clientele.

Not exactly what I expected ..................I liked it. 

I was thinking some sprawling ranch house with wood floors and saw dust everywhere, maybe some old west artifacts on the walls and grumpy old waitresses. 

What I got was a cool little funky building, with cool interior and neat things on the walls. More of a sports bar atmosphere with a good sized dining area. Killer staff and great food. 

I had a burger, I believe flat grilled, cooked medium rare and I could tell it was good beef. They said they grind it themselves. The fries were great as they are a fresh cut type. The beans were different. They were a lighter vinegary type of bean with onion and bacon. I liked them but could not eat the whole pot that came out. 

It ended up being a little expensive. 9 for the burger and Fries, 2.50 for the drink and 1.50 for the beans. Tax and tip it was an 18 dollar lunch.

I'm sure this place is a great hike. However, I've only been to this mountain for the Lori Piestewa Memorial Services. And that is what this review is about.

I remember what it was like when Lori Piestewa was declared a prisoner or war and how my family got calls from Hopi inlaws asking us to pray in our way for her safe return. There were many things online, in our newspapers and on tv - we were so afraid. And then the inevitable came, the news we didn't want to hear.

I don't know if any of ya'll know this, but Tuba City and the Hopi Nation are small places. Both are tight knit communities where everyone knows one another. And the devistation felt by her loss was incredible. I remember a cousin of mine recalled it as "you could hear the cries in the streets". Every Native in the country probably went to bed hungry that night in honor of her.

And as for the name Squaw. I always knew it was bad. It was something you never said,  you never needed to say it. It was always something terrible. Once when I asked my grandfather what it meant he said "a terrible, terrible woman who's unfit to get married." I later learned that it meant, to his tribe, a women who was raped as a child and was deemed no longer fit to bear children. That was the interrpretation I grew up with and that is how I equate it today. I know of the mainstream meaning of that word, as a derogitory term for a vagina. But know that different tribes view it differently. but all meanings are terrible.

I've only been called a squaw once. and unfortunatly, that person knew what it meant and used it in that context. And inspite of my education, eloquence and empathy - I was nothing but a mere squaw to this person and to this state and so was it's mountian. And I gotta admit, it stung a little to hear Squaw Peak Freeway or Squaw Peak used so... lightly. 

It was a wonderful day to hear Governor Napalitano decide to change the name to honor Lori Piestewa. I found it ironic and fitting. An elder once said, "Jessica may have gotten a movie, but Lori got a mountain!" And though she lost her life fighting for the freedoms of all Americans, she won a major battle in the war against using hurtful names from Indian Country's past to casually name things such as: mountains, sports teams, etc.

This little indian girl who cried when she heard that Woman Warrior died is now a young woman who does what she can to push for change in America - and a big part of what inspires me and other women of color (not just natives) was the renaming of this mountain. This Peak is more than just a place for a great hike, it's the beginning of a movement. I have never forgotten that everytime I've traveled to it's base to honor the woman who inspired the change. And I know this woman, where ever she is, smiles down knowing her daughter doesn't have to live in the same world where she once did - where Native women were constantly being cursed at when asked for directions. Where signs all over a city sliced through you like knives. Where you'd try not to whince whenever a non-native on TV spoke about the traffic. It's a wonderful world, I only wish Lori could see it.

We were sooo happy when Sam Fox opened one of his Zinburgers here in Scottsdale Quarter.  Our taste buds leaped for joy.  

We've always enjoyed their Biltmore location. And even though the service here could be better and the location enlarged, the burgers were...  great. 

We returned last evening for our fourth visit. I would plan on a thirty minute wait, but that will allow you to hit some of the nearby stores. The time went by quickly, with a band playing in the promenade.  Nice!

We started off with their yummy fried zucchini sticks ($7.00), adding the Chipotle Mayo dip to the Ranch was a great idea. I decided to try their Kale Caesar ($4.50). It was good, but needed a little more dressing. 

As for our burgers, we ordered the Breakfast ($12.50) open face and their house Zin($10.50).  Mine had an fried egg on top, with applewood bacon,
avocado, cheese, lettuce and mayo; while the Zin had manchego cheese, yummy zinfandel Braised Onions with lettuce and mayo.  Both were delicious.

I believe the secret to Zinburger is how they make their burgers.  Rather compacting the chopped meat and squeezing out all the air pockets. They form them gently. That way the smoky taste permeates the meat.

Expect to pay $20 each plus taxes and gratuities, including soft drinks and one appetizer or small salad each.

Enjoy!

After surviving my first tornado scare in Madison, Wisconsin, my partner in crime, Daniel L. and I ventured out to this well known local BBQ hangout for some good old smoky ribs and all the fixings.

With the Midwest reputation of having some of the finest meats, it was a no brainer to order the 1/3 slab BBQ smoked ribs and pork shoulder sandwich combination dinner ($14.75). The staff mentioned the pork shoulder and the beef brisket were the top sellers besides the ribs.

The pork shoulder was pigilicious! The shredded meat was perfectly seasoned with the rub and then hickory smoked which gave its own taste without the addition of the BBQ sauce. It also impressed me because there were was no sign of grease on the pork. The bun was a standard bread bun compared to the sweet roll which accompanied the dinner combination. We took the recommendation of the staff and ordered the extra meat (additional 5 ounces for $3) since were feeling extra carnivorous! The BBQ pork ribs came with five succulent ribs with the meat just waiting to fall off the bone. Each bite had a generous coating of their famous award winning BBQ sauce. 

Our dinner combination came with two choices of side orders which we picked the baked beans and cole slaw. Both were served in a small styrofoam cups along with the BBQ sauce. It's easy to see why the BBQ sauce won numerous award because of it's rich, sweet and peppery flavor. I'm not a fan of cole slaw but this one exceed my expectations with its creaminess and was extra cold. The baked beans maintained a firm texture and should be ordered with any meal because the sauce was so addictive.

The cabin style interior holds 11 tables and is very close to the Madison airport. The actual BBQ pit is located a few miles away from the restaurant. So grab your dental floss and wet naps and eat some authentic BBQ at Smoky Jon's!

My friend and I have wanted to go to the Butterfly Wonderland for a while and the time came to go! We met up on a Sunday morning and got our ticket to check them out!  

What does Butterfly Wonderland got going for them? Well they are the only butterfly atrium in the valley and they say they are America's largest butterfly atrium too. , they say the butterflies inside the conservatory come from butterfly farmers from Costa Rica, Malaysia, Ecuador, Thailand & the Philippines as well as within the US and another fun fact Arizona is home to 344 species of butterflies.  Here comes the sticker shock: its 18.95 plus tax which equals to 20.26 I think it was.  

Once you pay your ticket you walk inside and have to wait in a hallway because you will be directed to watch a 14 minute movie on the migration of the Monarch Butterfly in 3D, we had to wait a few minutes because there was a show already playing.  The movie is cool; you follow a year in the life of a few Monarchs. 

Once your movie is over you are shown into the conservatory, now this is where the fun is it, so many amazing beautifies fluttering around, some look like they are in a game of tag, some just seeing what everyone else is up to, if you stand still and make small movements you might be blessed to have a few land on you, also was told if you wear bright colors they will be attracted to you too, You are not allowed to hold out your hand or try to touch them, but they are allowed to land on you.  I had a few land on me and also had a few fly too close to my face and gave me a butterfly smack or too! Haha  I could spend hours in the conservatory just watching the butterflies enjoying the sun light.

A few things, the conservatory is a tropical rain forest, its humid and misting water is happening, so dress for the rain forest, leave your bags & purses in the car, no need for all that, watch where you are walking the butterflies land everywhere and just make sure you don't step on them. Also inside the conservatory you will see a Koi fish pond, I thought that was cool but also thought hey don't they eat bugs that might land on the water,aawwee poor butterflies that became fish food .

Once you leave the conservatory you go into a smaller room and check to see if you are smuggling any butterflies, and I know that sounds funny, but there were a few that tried to escape before we went through the door. 

Then you get to check a cool ant farm, some fishes and other stuff, and even stick your hand in a tank to touch a sting ray, and yes I did that, but I have fed sting rays before too, it's a cool experience.

This was an enjoyable time, we spent maybe 2 hours enjoying everything, do I feel its worth the 20 buck entry fee, no I don't, but will I be a sucka and do it again yep I will haha.

How do you give four women simultaneous (food) orgasms?

First take them to Vegas.  Then take them to Rio and stick them in a long-ass line, make them watch the same loud, lame show twice (and considering that show starts every hour, that gives you an idea of exactly how long that long-ass line was), and force them to see the same freaking faces all around them as they get hungrier and hungrier and crankier and crankier.  Basically the equivalent of taking them to see the English Patient on a first date.

When you have about 30 minutes to go, shake things up a bit by getting two of them hammered off one drink from the casino bar.  (After all, it doesn't take much to get them going if their stomachs are *that* empty. http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/wHN6nbeG3TPvQlEAq1jQKw/l)

Get them *just* to the point where they're saying, "goddammit, this better be damn good!" (http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/xg4EfS0b8ZOaYD0xwiBL1w/l)

...then let them loose.

No foreplay, NO FILLER!!!!!!

Get straight to the point and take these women to the CRAB LEGS.  We're not talking costco style, salty-yet-still-bland, cut up the side for easy access crab legs...we're talking succulent, taste-like-they-just-came-out-of-the-wild-Bering Sea amazing morsels of heaven.  

Seriously, food has never given me such pure joy.  Pure, pure, unadulterated crustacean-induced happiness.

My dearest Village Buffet, you were so memorable, almost 2 months later, I'm still trying to figure out how to quit you.

Not counting price I like this store and the service. 
My favorite, a fellow I call Scotsman the meat counter man. I don't know if this gentleman is from Scotland or not, but his language reminds me of one I know. But the key distinguishing factor for him is his superb service and great attitude. He is just  short of your personal butcher. He takes his time with you, and he does not rush you on. Listens, gives advice and is extremely helpful. When necessary he will look in the back to satisfy your request . He alone could keep me coming back. Oh, and also the meat counter is excellent overall. Great selection,  and good cuts.
What else, well the cheese section is outstanding, the prepared foods are plentiful and tasty. I like the baked goods also. Another nice feature is you can eat right there, which I do sometimes so I don't food shop when starving, which always costs me more somehow.

This review is NSFW (Not Safe For Work). You might just end up reading it, calling in sick, *cough*, *cough*, catching a ride (cab, light rail, uber, lyft, friend, bicycle, skateboard, roller skates, shoes, or slippers) and spending your day at Hanny's instead.

Hanny's has a special place in my heart. Oh, Hanny's. You're close enough to my house to be an easy light rail destination, and just far enough for me to stay away most of the time. "Dangerous curves ahead" doesn't even begin to cover the tepidness one should take while ordering your $5 martini's, especially when you order them on the rocks, in a tumbler glass, and a couple of limes to dress it up instead. Your $5 martini special is always special and that's just why I like you, you make every hour happy and not just the hours between 3pm and 6pm ;-)

The one complaint I hear from most people and many reviews is that at Hanny's, there's no Happy Hour, I think you just have to know to order their $5 martinis. I generally consider happy hours to be happy only when they come coupled with a decent drink selection AND food selection, but those martini's, they make up for it.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, set your limit at two, possibly even one, be sure you've got a DD and have the happiest of hours.

Ra Sushi is just your basic average sushi joint. Nothing really special about this place. The sushi here is mediocre at best. We came around 930pm on a Sunday, and the place wasn't that crowded. Their service is very poor and slow. We had to ask many times for water refills, and they even forgot to bring out the wasbi and ginger for our sashimi and rolls.
Let's start with the good stuff.
Yellowtail sashimi was the only best dish of the nite. The cuts were perfect and thick. It's wasn't the best,but it pass.
Viva Vegas Roll how can they like this. The roll barely had any spicy tuna mostly imitation crab,and it was to sweet for my taste buds.
Crispy Onion Albacore was a mess on the plate. The albacore looked like it was cut by a dull knife. Plus they drowned it with so much ponzi sauce were you couldn't taste the fish anymore.
Tropical Roll was ok. It was something different. Great presentation but no Wow factor there.
The only reason it made it to 3 star instead of 2 is because of the yellowtail sashimi was good.Other than that there's better places to get your sushi fix.

I had to wait a few days to write my review of the Phoenix Art Museum because I thought I would be able to process everything I saw during a recent visit.  I was wrong.  I think I need to go back again and again because there is so much to take in... it was my first visit but it certainly won't be my last.  

They have so many amazing exhibits and the 4 stories hold so many diverse pieces, i was literally in awe during my tour.  Shout out to Mark P and a huge thank you for walking me through your second home!  I don't even know where to begin, but a few of my favorite areas were the sculpture garden (it's manicured perfectly), the fashion design collection (I learned about the real meaning of 'couture') and the contemporary art collection (specifically 'Mass' made of burnt wood, wire, and string as well as the mirrored, sound proof, LED lighted room (talk about getting lost in time).  There is so much more that I'll have to go back to see more of and the exhibits are constantly changing...

Phoenix Art Museum also offers a ton of events and activities including films, workshops, demonstrations, and discussions.  There is also a really great area for the kids and teens as well as an Arcadia Farms on the premises.  Next year they will be celebrating their 50th anniversary, so I'm sure there will be plenty more unique festivities around that as well... don't wait to go though, go now!  I had no idea what I was missing out on until I went - you should too!

I had a little problem with the turbocharger on my car (and I think we would all agree that life without "turbo" is pretty nearly unbearable! :-)
Turns out the turbocharger wastegate solenoid was sticking...man I hate it when that happens! 
But my trusty mechanic at Radiator King (Steve may truly be an automotive genius) quickly, expertly (and inexpensively:) diagnosed and repaired said wastegate solenoid while I went and enjoyed lunch!
Delightful!
I wandered across the lot trying to decide between Andreoli Italian Deli and Vermont Sandwich Company.
I decided on VSC, because when you think about it...a whole company, devoted to sandwiches! :-) 
Geez! What a good idea!
What if other companies devoted themselves to what they say they do?
What if US Air and United Airlines were really in the business of expertly flying people around?
What if GM and Chrysler were  truly in the business of building adequate and serviceable vehicles?
What if AIG had actually been in the insurance business?
What a world this could be.
Happily, VSC is the real deal. 
Their devotion to sandwiches and the related accouterments is real and touching in its sincerity:)
Walking into the establishment, you are confronted by an almost overwhelming array of choices...fear not, they will (with a smile, BTW:) help you navigate through the menu.
The place itself is very "Vermonty"...an eclectic blend of painted 2x4 stud walls and 2x4 tchotchke shelves with all manner of toy cars, salt and pepper shakers, small pictures, etc.
That's juxtaposed with Deadhead posters, Phish memorabilia, Dave Matthews Band paraphernalia and Live In Brooklyn playing in the background.
I ordered a "Long Trail", a very Vermonty reference to the Green Mountains of Vermont and the hiking trail through those mountains (an incredibly beautiful hike, if you ever get the chance:) with a frosty hand squeezed lemonade...lunch as it was meant to be:)
The Long Trail is a softball size wad of house roast beef, shaved super thin and served on 9 grain bread (in my case...I don't really care for sourdough, but VSC will happily customize for you:), with fresh tomatoes, lettuce, horseradish mayo, pickles, gruyere and...wait for it...crumbled bacon! 
It was a nearly perfect roast beef sandwich!
It came with potato salad...really good potato salad!!...not far from what I would make for myself:)
A word about the sides at most sandwich shops...that word is "crap":)
Too often the sides are, at best, uninteresting afterthoughts...at worst, something inedible, bought in 55 gallon drums from Costco:(
Not here!
They make their own potato salad, slaw and pasta salad...all are fresh and tasty!
I felt like I had taken a pleasant little trip to Vermont in the summer and found myself a great little sandwich place off the Long Trail...and I didn't even have to endure the garbage scows of the skies at US Air to get there:)

On the scale from 1-10, 10 being the jankiest of janky casinos, I would say this casino is about a 9. It's dark, dim, smoke-infested, and small in here. If you catch this place in the morning, you'll meet the night crawlers and it's not pretty here at the Ellis Island..

But once you reach the restaurant, you'll literally realize, the grass is always greener on the other side. 

Steak & Eggs: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EAwh1OmG6t6p3nRaZOW_AA?select=qcM6QdCRzuf-BDTznRHR2w
$4.99! Uh, what?
The steak was pretty delicious and tenderly cooked to my medium-rare option. Is it odd to say that I'm "an egg person?" I'm pretty much a sucker for anything egg and a fan of the runny yolk, on the top, side, or bottom of my food.  The 'taters were crispy golden brown and tasty. The sourdough bread toast (drenched with buttah) hit the spot.  So seriously.. $4.99?

I know there are tons of places on/off the strip for cheap steak, but this is by far one of the places I can agree for its mind-blowing value. You can also opt out the egg, for a "steak dinner" - $6.99.

Oh yes, this place is also a brewery, so our order of house Hef was $2. My mimosa was  $5 and it was kinda huge.

So.. our 4 steak orders and 2 alcohol drinks under $30?
If you lost your soul in what Jay B calls, "Lost Wages," come here. Your wallet will surely thank you, then give one swift kick to the groin.  
Ellis will save you!

A three star rating per Yelp means A-OK. I think that fits for this restaurant. I think all of the employees are polite AND helpful. They are always willing to help out the newbies coming into the shop. The sandwiches are okay, but nothing which will blow you away. The only exception would be the Beef and Cheddar, which is really good. I dig the two soda machines that they have so you're never waiting to fill up. They have those new machines where you use the touchscreens to pick your drink.

One source of aggravation for me as a customer is that businesses are always asking the customer to donate something. In this case, they ask the customer if they want to round up their purchases. I really just want to buy lunch and move on. Let me decide how I want to spend my Charity budget on my own terms.

Walked here after having dinner at Liberty Market, since I couldn't have any of the desserts offered there.  After the friendly and very helpful female host helped to phone the pastry chef to address my food allergies, I placed my order of a slice of "Dangerous Dilemma" and a chocolate-covered walnut strudel and was seated at a two-top next to a window with a view of a parking lot.  I decided to while away the wait on the dessert by looking at the baubles on display by the entrance.  A few moments later, the host notified me that the strudel had cornstarch, so it's a no-no for me, and that  I would not be able to dine inside since I should not have been seated with an "outside drink."  "Would this be a problem?," she asked. I said no, paid for my to-go dessert, and settled on a bench outside the cafe.  While the two forkfuls that I tried of the multi-layered dense cake (cookie crumb bottom layer, dark chocolate fudge cake, white chocolate mousse, another layer of dark chocolate fudge cake, and then topped with raspberry coulis) were delicious, I inadvertently became the meal of ghost mosquitoes (so I had to pack up and leave, yet again).  All because I had a lidded to-go cup of Liberty Market drip house coffee with me.
The $6.54 (tax included) cake slice was tasty (although almost a bit too sweet), and I can't fault someone for following house rules, but I wished my drink could've been overlooked.  (There were only two occupied tables out of 12 to 15 tables.) Heck, I could've ordered a glass of wine, or another cup of coffee, with my dessert had I not been turned away...

Found out through Shannon E. The Fractured Prune's Grand Opening was today, and wasted no time hustling over on my break! 

Apparently, some other guy didn't either: "I drove all the way out here from Apache Junction for a dozen!" 

When I walked in I was immediately greeted by Marilyn. She talked me through their custom donut process: Selecting a custom glaze and toppings before handing off your card to a doughnut designer.

Think combinations like Dreamsicle, Chocolate Covered Cherry, Maple Bacon. 

Decided on two Mint Chocolate Chip doughnuts: One for me to scarf down at work, one for Andrew C for later. 

Because he might murder me later for going alone. 

And I'm not a self-centered, lameface lady friend. Doing "Nice things" goes both ways, ladies. 

These donuts aren't sitting around in a case, either. Custom means made when you order. 

Got back to work and took a bite. Still piping hot, minty, chocolatey, practically melting in my mouth as I ate it. 

This is really a four star review masquerading as a five star: I love the custom concept; however, I'm more of a "classic doughnut" gal: Think Old Fashioned Kruller with some chocolate on it. 

The customer service is what bumped the rating up to five stars! 

Now go, take a doughnut break. Meanwhile, I'll resist inhaling Dude's while waiting for him to pick it up!

When it comes to parties, Steve Wynn's Encore Beach Club and XS Night Club are still the gold standard for the hottest spots in town.

I came to the Beach Club on Sunday at around 2:oopm to see Calvin Harris and surprisingly there was hardly no wait at all! I've heard horror stories where people were turned away even though they bought tickets for the show because the venue was beyond capacity. In any case, we got in, I was happy...

SCORE!!

As soon as we walked through security, I witnessed an ocean of skin filling the entire space! And this pool area was huge! 

Damn these people are beautiful! I suggest ordering drinks on the left side of the entrance cuz the drinks were bigger, stiffer and the same price!  

I tried the food as well and it was also very good! I recommend the grilled chicken sandwich and the steak sliders, both were mouthwatering good and excellent accompaniments to our drinks!

Calvin Harris came out about 3:00pm and the crowd was buzzing by now with anticipation! There was so much energy in the pit but it was all positive, no hating, no shoving or any nonsense like that...it was all love and good times and that's how it should be!

Bravo Encore Beach Club!

I had a slammin time and I look forward to coming back very soon!

Happy Times!

Warning: Douche Bag level CODE RED!

Here's how my experience went ... 

Me: "May I have a Carmel Latte?" 
Employee: "No"
.... dead air ...
Me: "Ummm why not?"
Employee: "We don't have carmel"
Me: "Ummm I guess I'll just have a Cappuccino then"
Employee: "Just so you know it's a REAL Cappuccino"
Me: "Okay" (in my head I'm trying to figure out if I can legally punch this dickhead in the face or not).

So I sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how he'll be moving to downtown Phoenix soon. To which I just chuckled to myself as this person was FAR from cool enough to blend into CenPho. What a complete and utter douche bag. Stay in Tempe poser (and keep your employer there to!).

This experience was months ago, and now they have opened up a shop downtown. Guess what? I'm not going to check them out. Fuck you Cartel. You'll never be Lux, so just stay in Tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you haven't earned.

Complete FAIL. 

For my two cents, skip this place and go to Lux in CenPho/Mid Town right off the Light Rail. Authentically cool with ZERO attitude, great coffee and no douche bag employees. 

And as for great coffee ... try Conspire WAY better coffee and authenticly cool.

---- 
please read "owners comment" below ... here's my response ... 
----
Wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner ... I guess my new job  should be to "promote good coffee in Arizona" ... and I don't appreciate good coffee because I enjoy the combination of caramel AND coffee ... 

By that definition I guess I don't know good ice cream because I like hot fudge on it or good pizza because I enjoy pepperoni AND cheese or good music if it's not acoustic or a good voice unless it's A cappella ... thanks for proving my point. I wouldn't go here unless you are a total coffee snob ... (I guess) they don't need your business you poser!

This used to be called "The Gift of Lights" at Sunset Park, but has a new name and home. The now "Glittering Lights" at Las Vegas Motor Speedway was fun and free for a 2nd year thanks to yelp. There were a lot more cars this year compared to last year. It seemed like there were a few more lights up this year, but pretty much the same light displays just put up in a different spot. The difference I notice here at the speedway vs. susnet park is there is a lot more space for lights. I just wish they filled it all up! It's too bad more businesses don't get involved and set up a light display where it's dark. There is a sign at the gate telling you which radio station you can listen to while you drive through. I enjoyed munching on popcorn and hot chocolate that were for sale by the Boy Scouts at the entrance and seeing all the pretty lights :)

OUTSTANDING seafood.

"That was really good.  What was it?" asks my Midwest white friend

"Spicy jellyfish with bean curd" is my straight face response.

"Huh?  So what is this?" he stupidly continues.

"Um, sea cucumber with abalone"; again straight faced.

"What?!?" With great exasperation in his voice.

"And this is Santa Barbra Spot Prawns with their egg clutch, deep fried crab with fermented black beans, steamed live fish with ginger onion, and the soup was made from tiger shark fin".

"I think I'm going to be sick" is all he can say.  Sorry I can't help but to explode in laughter.

Joyful House is a Cantonese seafood restaurant for the initiated.  I'm not sure if I should even write this review.  It's one of those places that long time Asian Vegas locals cherish.  Yes its won the "Best of Vegas" from the Review Journal but that barely speaks to it's hidden greatness.

So maybe they need to get to know you before they reveal their secrets, persist.  For example, you MUST ask for their spot prawns with the eggs.  Yes, they are now $12 each but they are worth every penny.  Eggs exploding in your mouth with the essence of fresh shrimp.

The spicy jellyfish was excellent.  Clean oceanic flavor accented by sesame and chili oil, and a touch of soy.  The sea cucumber with abalone, a tender sweet explosion of sea flavor.

Don't hate me but this is one of the few places that still uses real shark fin.  While I deplore fining and think it's inhumane, I couldn't resist.  It's been 12 years since I had the real thing.  Add a jigger of Remy XO, perfect.

This is not your typical Cantonese restaurant.  Yes, if you choose, they make great Americanized favorites (beef broccoli. shrimp fried rice, "Peeking duck", lemon chicken, shrimp with honey walnuts) but ultimately only those in the know will experience it's greatness.

Shhhhh.  Not for everyone.

Greek restaurant in a German hotel on the Vegas Strip?  Why not.

Estiatorio Milos continues to impress.  Outstanding seafood that calls one back to the costal villages and towns bordering the Mediterranean.  And let's just say, you will pay 40 percent less for this level of quality and freshness as the "other" place in the twin parabolic, glass sheathed extensions of an eccentric, once vegan, billionaire's ego anchoring the North Strip.  Huh what?

Milos features extremely fresh and vibrant ingredients like Mediterranean seafood, air flown live daily.  Dishes are prepared with respect for the incredible ingredients.  Most seafood is simply grilled, dressed with a peppery Greek olive oil and a squeeze of sun ripened lemon allowing the flavors to shine.  Exemplary examples include simply grilled, uber sweet, live langoustines (the only other place in Vegas to offer this), salty, oceanic Portuguese sardines, and a tender braised then grilled octopus.  The razor focused flavor of each carried by richness of the oil and enhanced by the acidity of the lemon.

Grilled whole fish also benefit from the simple finish.  Simply tour the seafood bar, pick one out, pay by the pound and enjoy.

Finally, for lobster lovers, do not pass on any of the lobster pastas (the lobster pasta for lunch uses an American lobster, dinner choices include the deep sea Bay of Fundy or Mediterranean blue lobsters).  Perfectly cooked chunks of tail meat mixed in a mild but acidic tomato base served with the cooked head.  Be sure to scrape out the tamale and mix it with the pasta for the added briny oceanic finish.

Tip:  Lunch offers the best value.  Three courses beginning at $22.14 with a maximum $20 supplement for top selections.

Very good wine list.  Wine by the glass offerings mainly Greek and pair perfectly with the food.  Service is attentive and very friendly.

A restaurant that has vastly improved with time.

500 or 900 degrees.  60 or 180 seconds.  Yup, great Italian style pizza.

The pizzas.  Two styles of crust made from a lightly salted, uber elastic dough.  The pizza Romana has a distinct crispier bottom crust,  the pizza Napolitana a chewier crust with blistered / blackened edges.  Personally, I like the bitterness from the blackened edges.  Note: as the pizzas cool, the texture becomes the same.  Refrigerator or AC chilled slices in the middle of the night don't cut it.

Tried them all.  The quality topping combinations work well, there is just too much of it.  All the excessive "stuff" obscures the crust and isn't that the point of using these special ovens?  That said, the simplest is the best (the Margherita - San Marzano tomato, bufala mozzarella, fresh basil).

It's not just about the pizzas.  Great starters including the roasted beet salad (roasted beets, arugula, goat cheese, pistachios, basil pesto and drizzled with a fig vincotto).  A contrast in sweet, tangy, nutty, earthy flavors and textures.  Delish!  Do not pass up the polipo (braised octopus topped with a mint vinaigrette).  Fork tender with the perfect "octopussy" flavor (sweet, salty, briny, oceanic goodness).

The mozzarella bar a nice touch.  Three selections (classic bufala, smoked, and stracciatella - soaked in heavy cream) offered with various sides and pizza bread.  The classic pairs well with marinated artichokes.  The sour notes of the brine make the sweet milk flavor come alive.

50 plus Italian / Italian varietal wines by the glass.  Nice pours, prices are fair.  Friendly, off the Strip service.  

Bottom line, Due Forni makes it easy to have a good time.

FEZ is poshy and obnoxious, like the restaurants on Santana Row. Yet it was surprisingly inviting, mostly due to our awesome server.

We came here for late dinner. Our server was nice enough to extend the happy hour menu to us at the table since the bar was packed and we really wanted the bar bites!

Cheese fondue (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg?select=s-DoCgOwLo0-XoDuIhfBGA): Big portion. The cheese was gooey and delicious! The combination of grilled zucchini and cheese was surprisingly tasty! We loved it!

Deep fried poppers (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PVTfzxu7of57zo1jZwEzkg?select=rsusUomr1--LF_3qE3EN2A): I was quite intrigued by how perfectly round the poppers were. Sweet red peppers filled with cream cheese. A bit disappointed since they weren't spicy. The aioli did add a kick though.

Love happy hours! Especially late night! =D

Chef Daniel Boulud's triumphant return to Vegas.  This incarnation, a modern brasserie using the freshest, locally sourced, seasonal ingredients in updated, French classic dishes.  Intriguing elements in every dish brighten flavors and awaken the palate.  Add some beautifully imagined French craft cocktails; this is not your typical austere brasserie.

The requisite classics are there; a well made pate de champagne bourguignon with bits of this and that served with house made cornichons and whole grain mustard with bread, the authenticity of which is rarely tasted outside of Europe.  The obligatory shellfish plateau; a mountain of fresh seafood, begging for a glass of Sancerre.  The austere coq au vin, with it's perfectly braised pieces of chicken amidst lardoons, mushrooms and pearl onions.  All good but pale in comparison to dishes showcasing the chef's Michelin pedigree.

The artichoke veloute is incredible.  Velvety smooth.  Huge vegetal flavor of artichokes balanced with cream around a mushroom royale.  Bits of mushrooms provide texture.  A submerged "crouton" soaked in butter adds even greater richness.  Pair the dish with the "Bee's Knees" and be blown away by the complexity created by the sweetness, acidity, and richness.  The salmon rillettes, all the flavor of salmon, made smooth, rich, and creamy.  Hints of fennel add a wonderful anise notes, fried capers add texture and briny salinity.  Finally the dry aged Brandt ribeye.  Simply grilled served with a barnaise sauce, more acidic and with herbaceous notes than most that heightens the nutty, bleu cheese flavor of the steak.

Tip:  Lunch is a deal.  $26 for two courses, $33 for three.

Tip:  Match a craft cocktails with each dishes.  Cocktails are extremely complex with the use of many different bitters.  Most have great acidity.  Dare I say, perfect pairings work better than wine.

Very good wine list.  Heavy emphasis on France.  Decent vintage depth.   Best "value" in older vintages.  

Contemporary, bright ambiance.  Excellent, relaxed service.  You would never know the restaurant has been opened for only a month.

Definitely a welcome addition to the Vegas culinary scene.

Ever hear that saying "muscle weighs more than fat"? I don't know about you, but doesn't a pound of muscle weigh the same as a pound of fat?  You hear it all from time to time..."I'm not fat, I'm big boned", "it's baby fat", or "I weigh a lot because I have a lot of muscle" How do you know?  How do you really know if you've never been tested?  Yes, we can all do the eye test.  But if you're interested in knowing exactly where you stand with your body fat, you have to give Bod Pod a try. 

Bod Pod Las Vegas is located in Summerlin inside Anytime Fitness.  I've been tested before, but only through BF calipers.  However, there's about a 5% variance with calipers. In my opinion, that's way too big of a variance.  That's the difference between someone 15% BF and 20% BF.  The most affordable and closest to 100% accurate is the Bod Pod.  

Here's the process:
1.  Set up an appointment.  Cost is $50 for one test or $100 for three.  http://leanbodymetrics.com/

2.  Don't eat or workout at least 3 hours before your appointment.  Before you arrive, you will need to come prepared with the correct clothing.  Very important to wear minimal, form-fitting clothing such as compression shorts.  Women can wear a swim suit.  Both men and women have to wear swim cap, which they can provide if you do not have one. 

3.  Arrive at Anytime Fitness and complete a small questionnaire

4.  The Bod Pod is in a private room inside the gym.  You get weighed and then you sit inside the pod for 3 tests to ensure accuracy.  Dave is the best. He'll explain the process and later cover the data. 

5.  In less than 5 minutes, you get a print out of your body fat percentage, total body fat in pounds, and lean mass pounds/percentage.  From your numbers, you'll find out if you're risky (high body fat), excess fat, moderately lean, lean, ultra lean, or risky (too low).  Your overall numbers will also determine your resting metabolic rate (i.e. what your daily calorie intake should be). 

6.  You're done...Now, go eat and hit the gym. 

This is some pretty exciting and motivating stuff.  You don't have to be a fitness pro, bodybuilder, or athlete to be tested. If you're interested to finding out how much calories you need to gain or lose weight, looking to see if you're progressing in the right direction, or simply just want to know your true body fat percentage...then give Bod Pod a try. 


PS:  For me, it's no longer how much or how little I weigh.  It's all about body composition.  The scale keeps track.  But it's my body fat percentage that keeps score.  Dropped 5+ percent body fat since my last testing.  Yes, I'm keeping score and winning.  Yeah Buddy!!!

I really hope that the hype behind this place is that it once was much better and people are latching on to the nostalgia. This was one of the most mediocre restaurants I have visited. 
We made reservations for 8:45pm on a Saturday night and the place was packed. It is located in a small strip mall and would be easy to miss. We were promptly seated and that is when everything started to go downhill. It took ~15 minutes to even get acknowledged and place our drink order. Their gnocchi and pasta are not made in house. I am not sure what would compel someone to pay $12 for gnocchi out of a package when I can get delicious gnocchi from Trader Joe's and toss in some pancetta for $5. I opted for their Frutti di Mare ($21) which was linguini in runny arrabiata sauce with an assortment of seafood. The husband had their carbonara which ranks among the worst I have ever had in the states. I am not even comparing this to Italy standards. While two of the three members of the party were still eating, one of the people's plates got taken away to be boxed up. Awkward. The server ignored our table pretty much most of the time and then rushed us out at the end. I would not come back nor recommend this place. It is all hype.

The Palazzo was everything we imagined it could be. We chose the Palazzo primarily for its location. 

The check in line was long upon arrival, but it moved in a steady pace and we were checked into our luxury suite rather quickly. All of the rooms here are suites, but we upgraded for a luxury suite to get a nice view. Our room was on the thirtieth floor overlooking the pool and the Strip. It wasn't much to look at during the day, but at night, it was breathtaking. 

The room was well appointed with a king size bed, full bathroom with quality toiletries. There were three TV's and a separate living area with sofa and loveseat. The sofa was a sleeper, we could've had two more people stay comfortably since the room was over seven hundred twenty square feet. 

The Palazzo is connected to the Venetian which was another plus. There is a Walgreens connected to the Palazzo on the bottom floor which made it extra convenient to get our bottled waters. 

We liked the fact that it's connected to the Venetian. With that in mind, the number of shops, restaurants, cafes, spas, and nightclubs are endless. I highly recommend the Palazzo if you want to take in as much as you can, on the Strip. 

Oh, and if you are environmentally conscious:
They recycle everything here!
The hotel runs on solar power, with thousands of solar powered panels on the roof tops, it's quite incredible! Everything is running off of the solar panels! 
There are employees who are in charge of separating all of the waste, from plastic, paper, and compost waste. 
Everything is recycled! 
Pretty cool!

Shhhhhh!  Don't tell my friends but one of the hottest guys in the show was gay.  I didn't realize this until he realized I was gay and offered me his lap to sit on for the picture.  There's nothing really telling about the moment.  It was just a feeling.

As I sat on his muscular legs, I was like "umm...this Jaymes Vaughan fellow is such a sweetie pie."  Then it hit me, he's most likely a southern gay.

He was a great emcee, full of charisma, warmth, and humor.  Not that a straight guy can't be those things.  But...yeah.

And he was hot, way hotter than his pictures--which captures his body beautifully but not his face.  That's a good thing.  Why wouldn't you want the performers to be better looking live for a live show.

Pleasant surprise.

And at the end of the show, he gave me a shout-out for being the only guy in the audience and said I would totally get laid that night by one of my three female companions.  Awkward heteronormative moment but not in the annoying way.  My friends got a chuckle because they knew better.

I thought this show was going to be so cheesy and homophobic but it's quite gay-friendly.  Audience friendly in general.

Nothing trashy.  

Very suggestive.  

And lots of great naked butts.

Really great.  

Expect women to go crazy.

Really crazy.

If Chippendales is something you're thinking of going to see, you really just should!  Put this expected Vegas experience on your list and cross it off.  I didn't necessarily find all the performers hot, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.

Doesn't matter if the dancers are straight or gay, it's fantasy.  I've always been a fan of thinking.

Thanks Kristin for hooking us Yelpers up with a deal for the Yelp Spring Break.

I don't really want to put art, and the experience of it into text. Because good art transcends it. 

It won't do you much good - for me to oooo and aaaah over the hours spent wandering through a large poignant building of installation art pieces. Describing in extreme detail all of the sounds, sensations, and lack of both which I experienced in each art piece. 

Nope - it won't do either you or me - any good.

Especially when I have a word limit here.

Cause you won't be able to picture what I type. No matter how hard I try. I'll ruin the surprise of certain exhibits. The mystery.  And it will only frustrate me - that I can't convey how intrinsically cool and alluring the Mattress Factory is.

I mean the name alone is cool. Sexy even.

But. I will tell you that you should go.

If you're in Pittsburgh for even a couple of hours. Don't waste time on things like food, sports, or anything else you may have planned on doing. Just go to the Mattress Factory. 

Go alone if you have to.

But even better.

Find someone that you enjoy spending time with. Someone who lets you say "that's so cool...." over and over again about every exhibit. Someone who may even see each piece the way you do. Or maybe not.

And then just pass away the day at the Mattress Factory. Wandering and experiencing. You won't have to worry about uptight museum people following you around. Or tired tourists. Or "is that it?" art. Or sterile marble floors - which echo with every step. You just don't need to worry about much when you go here. 

The Mattress Factory is the perfect place to let yourself slip. If even a little.

It's a special, one of a kind place, nestled in a random neighborhood, away from the hustle. Away from packed bars. 

Away from it all.

God help you if you're reading this review after you've booked a Spirit Airlines flight. If by some stroke of luck you're reading this before you buy, heed my warning: CLOSE OUT OF THE BROWSER NOW.

Ladies and gentleman, this for me was a lesson on the old adage: "You get what you pay for."

While I was stuck on the tarmac in Vegas, probably 100 yards away from my gate for 30 minutes after a 90 minute delay, I read reviews about how Spirit Airlines was the Greyhound of airline companies. 

This is an accurate representation of the flight. Everything seems old, I honestly thought the plane was going to fall apart a couple of times on the round trip. The seating is cramped, and you will be charged for anything under the sun.  Baggage claim was very annoying.

That amazing price is not so amazing after you add 70 bucks of baggage fees each way, plus 10 bucks to choose your seat (each way). Also don't bother choosing your seat. It really makes no difference, you are going to get screwed no matter what.

I told myself that If I won 600 bucks in Vegas I was going to just book a new one way ticket via any other airline back to Houston because I didn't want to experience Spirit Airlines a second time around.

At this moment, I'd give spirit 1 star because it was so bad.  Luckily they recovered for the return trip. Things went on without a hitch, kind of... There was still a delay, but it wasn't that horrible - typical really of any airline. I did feel like the plane was about to fall apart on take off and landing, but I guess I survived to tell the tale. Fine, you get 2 stars Spirit Airlines.

Bottom line: Make your trip to Vegas a fun one. Don't book Spirit becuase you end up spending the money you saved on baggage fees anyway. You'll also be annoyed with about 70% of the flight for various reasons.

tl;dr: This buzzfeed captures it perfectly: http://www.buzzfeed.com/sapna/what-its-like-to-fly-spirit-airlines

I want to warn everyone out there to NOT use this bakery for any special event!! I ordered 100 cupcakes for my recent wedding and confirmed my order (including the remainder of payment) with Slade, the owner, one week before. Slade assured me that although he would be out of town on the day of my event, my cupcakes would be delivered to the wedding site the morning of the ceremony/reception. On the day of the wedding, however, there were no cupcakes! They never showed up. According to a bakery employee (the day after the event), the person responsible for bringing them did not have a key to get into the bakery, as the locks had recently been changed. I can understand that these things happen, but what really upset were two things... 1)no one from the bakery bothered to call us or even the location where the wedding was held to help problem solve a new dessert; we were left on our own to scramble at the last minute. 2)I had to call Slade (when I returned from my honeymoon to NO message from him and NO refund of my money as of yet) to insist upon my money back. And, to add insult to injury, NOT ONCE did he ever even apologize or attempt to express even the slightest tone of remorse for the troubles his business caused us on my wedding day. If anything, he sounded taken aback that I was upset and put-out at my insistence that the money be refunded that day. I have never dealt with anyone who so blatantly cared less about his customers! I repeat... DO NOT USE THE WICKED WITCH BAKERY FOR ANY SPECIAL EVENT! 

One additional note... I called Slade back on Thursday (10/30) as no credit had yet showed pending on my account. He informed me that he had not put it through on Tuesday (as he had promised) but had "just done it this (Thurs) morning." When I stated that I was perturbed that he had not found it a priority to refund my $$ for services that his business did not provide, he became defensive and nasty once again and basically hung up on me! He called me back about an hour later (all nice and sweet this time) giving me the credit invoice numbers and told me that he "had just put them through." Sooo... not only did he not bother to refund my money the first time as promised, but then he lied to me about having done it Thursday morning before my call. This man can not be trusted!! I don't know about the rest of you Yelpers, but I think business integrity is more important than cupcake taste. I plan to stay faaaaaaaaaaar away from the Wicked Bakery.

Like most west valley Asians would say, Great Wall is a staple.  I've been to Great Wall a hundred times for dim sum and banquet-dinners since I was  kid --- heck, maybe even since I was born!   It's hard for me to even imagine how my childhood would be like without Great Wall.

From before their renovations to days before the kitchen fire, Great Wall has always served up delicious food.  As it is the only major Chinese restaurant in the west valley, Great Wall is always busy with a flurry of customers at any given time of day.  They have delicious hot dim sum and they have an even more amazing 10-course dinner.  If you don't understand Chinese customs, this place will always be LOUD!  Chinese people are loud.  We like to hear ourselves talk over other people's voices.  I think it adds to the charm of the restaurant.  ;)

Great Wall specializes in a lot of authentic off-the-menu dishes like duck tongues, fried pork intestines with sweet & sour sauce, fried fish heads with eyeballs the size of golf balls, and all the other stuff probably not palatable to people who didn't grow up around these kinds of foods but it's all reminiscent of  majestic China.  *wistful sigh*

Anyways, Great Wall will always hold a soft spot in my heart.  From sweet karaoke-infused memories to visions of old people dancing to terrible Chinese music.  Cheers!

WOW. THE ONLY THING THAT IS KEEPING THESE GUYS OPEN IS THEIR LOCATION AND FOOD NETWORK FAME.

Most of their customers are mainly gonna be tourists and first timers. Located in a busy part of the Fremont Street Experience, the name of the restaurant and the words "350 Pounds and Over Eat Free" are definite eye catchers.

The Heart Attack Grill or "HAG" as it's come to be known, has actually lived up to it's namesake with actual heart attack incidents. As a matter of fact, while I am typing this review, I find out the unofficial spokesperson for HAG has died from you guessed it, an apparent heart attack.

This place must be bad because I have gone at least 3 paragraphs before even having to mention their food. Ok, quick descriptions. They cook their beef patties and fries with lard. Their milkshakes have actual butter in them. Literally they have a little stick of butter right on top of it sticking out. Now I know the fat is what makes most greasy food taste good but in this case the grease is highly overpowering.

Service is decent. Yeah you got scantily clad female nurses as your servers but this is Vegas. Nothing should surprise you. Well, maybe except for when you see guys getting spanked by them with wooden paddles because it's their birthday. You can actually get spanked if you ask nicely. No special occasion necessary.

Of course everybody's number one complaint is that they take cash only. Of course there is an ATM available but you get charged up the arse just in fees alone. FAIL.

So overall, most people come just for the shock value. Meaning they are shocked when they shouldnt be when they find out there has been several heart attack incidents. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

The 9th Island:  Portuguese sausage, spam, jalapeos, pineapple and mozzarella pizza?  I'm so there!

Enter Buddha Belly Deli.  Aside from the odd tribute to Hawaii, essentially a mish mash of Asian flavors creating new Asian comfort food in Hendertucky.  And it's good.

In general, individual components to each dish are well made with the slightly over pronounced flavors.  Dishes lean towards South East Asia but with well controlled spice heat.  A series of house made chili sauces and concoctions can definitely make dishes thermonuclear without masking flavor if desired.

The pho dip lives up the hype.  A banh mi dipped in a flavorful beef pho broth.  Fresh baked roll loaded with five spice rubbed, rare, sliced beef and just the right amount of still crisp pickled been sprouts onions cilantro and basil slathered with hot, pungent Chinese mustard.  Simply put great eats.  The char siu pork roll equally good.  Juicy but not excessively fatty char siu topped with an Asian slaw and hoisin on a sweet bun.  Need I say more.  All sandwiches are accompanies by a side of their house made chips that provide a great textural contrast and neutrality between bites of the flavorful offerings.

A very good clam.  Basically tom yum kung with clams.  Aromatic, herbaceous, rich and warming.

The fries topped with Japanese curry (no coconut milk or aggressive spices of Indian curry) and a fried egg and strips of nori (laver), is and outstanding take on the Midwest classic.  Creamy, messy, and just plain good.

Finally, dragon breath fries.  Not spicy but a good wallop of garlic will remind you of its goodness for hours.

Although not destination worthy from the Strip, a great neighborhood, locals kind of fast food restaurant with a very friendly staff.

Encore Beach Club is G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S. Kaskade Sundays is what's up. Like Wet Republic and Rehab, it's all about scene and be seen - you will be surrounded by beautiful bodies. Unlike Wet and Rehab, you will NOT be afraid to get into the pool! 

Mr. Wynn did an amazing job getting this luxurious beach club built in a matter of months. It's located at the front of Encore - I don't even recall them being under construction when I was there in April. The layout is beautiful with three pools and two levels of cabanas, and rainfall "cages" with a stripper pole in the center if you want to show off your skills. 

Kaskade definitely brings the party on Sundays, but the vibe is definitely more chill than Wet and Rehab (hence the cleaner pools). He's set up right in the middle in front of Surrender (the nightclub) and there's a small area for people to dance. 

We got in for free (doesn't hurt to know the promoters), however cover is $30 for women and $50 for men. You'll easily drop $100+ on drinks, so you might want to consider reserving a lounge chair ($150 drink minimum) or if you can splurge, reserved a day bed or cabana (some with your own personal see-through pool), which will run you thousands. Otherwise you can grab a towel and post up along the edge of the pool.

There are two bar areas, a few tables to gamble and "The Grill" to order food. Share a few salads, which are huge, and the turkey club wrap - the more healthy options on the menu. Food babies are not attractive here.

They say good things come in small packages. Well this has to be the smallest Peter Piper that I've been to yet. 

What I really like about this place is that they actually have pizzas lined up and ready to eat.  A fair share of Triple P's aren't ready for the 11:30 lunch crowd and hardly have any pizzas available. I chalk that up to poor management. They're usually too busy making pizzas for the carry out crowd instead of the dining room. This place is the exception and seems to be managed correctly.

Another thing that is very cool about this location is that they give you one of those flashing buzzers when your customized pizza is ready to go. So you don't look like an ass when you're cutting in line to get your special order. I hate when I order a pizza and it's half way eaten by the time I get up there.

As far the taste, of course Peter Piper is an average tasting product but it's a cheap lunch. The only thing is that this place can get pretty crowed since it has a relatively small dining room. But they do have plenty of parking.

I was fortunate enough to spend my NYE with the extremely talented and greatest eye candy of all, John Legend. I found out he was playing at The Pearl for NYE, I informed my girlfriends and we were all in for a NYE with John Legend!!! 

We decided to go all out and got 5th row middle seats...I'm pretty much broke now, but it sounded like a good idea at the time. And looking back at how much fun I had, it was worth every penny to see John Legend up close and personal! 

The venue itself, fantastic! Located inside The Palms Hotel....smaller more intimate setting, and from looking around a really great view from wherever you sit. The bars outside had limited selection of liquor and beer, but the bartenders are super nice and will try to mix you up something yummy with what they have. 

The acoustics were great, Johnny sounded fantastic, and I sang duets with him throughout the evening....Love that man. 
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wByqlwP3G8jJe3cPn7HmTg&userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg

As we walked out of the venue, there were people passing out hats, crowns,  beads and noisemakers for NYE, we had just enough time to get to the bar to grab some drinks and have a view from our suite of the fireworks on strip. NYE + John Legend + Fireworks = HAPPINESS!!

See the amazing family  attempt to eat vegan!! 
Watch the brave kids eat fake burgers!! 
Observe the care and balance of the waiter/server/host  who attempts to amuse the meat eating group as they  balance the high wire of going green! 

We had a fun and adventure trying out the local vegan place that we would love to love.. but it's just not  in our future. 

Fresh and bright inside , the decor screams: I am earthy , and healthy and well thought out .  I give it two thumbs up for the refreshing design. ( except that blasted TV with "SuperiorMaster"  TV channel from a Satellite Planet located somewhere near the moon of vegan. 
The place was empty at 4 , I hope they have more business later , they really need a better location and more informative signage. 

We gave a shot trying out Vegan burger with fries, they tasted okay from all accounts but not enjoyed. My husband had the only winner at the table "Cha Cha Chicken"  tasty and good texture. I would order it if you made me go back . My meal was the loser ..it had 5  fake shrimp and big huge bright green bean pods ..very snappish ..I felt well Beaned.  
 Youngest kiddo avoided the whole adventure with a bowl of 
rice ..wimp. 

We all decided if we were vegan we would like this place and be happy to come back .. but we are  steak loving, dairy drinkers with our eyes on the leftovers in the fridge when we came back. On to another adventure!

huh.... #1 on "Hot on Yelp" on the Yelp homepage for Las Vegas. I was expecting some expensive 5-star restaurant. But when I think about it, Earl of Sandwich is something I always crave on my Vegas trip.

Not only is it the best drunk food (opened late), it's also perfect for lunch and dinner. It's located in the casino part (not the mile shops) of Planet Hollywood. 

Every time I come here, my go-to sandwich is the cannonball. Delicious bread, meatballs, marinara, and gooey cheeeeese. Simple, yet gorgeous.
My boyfriend and I shared one as an after-club snack and on the last bite of my boyfriend's sandwich, he dropped the last meatball on the floor. In all honesty, it was the saddest part of our night. So sad that we talked about it the next morning, very true story.

It's that good, man.

This is NOT the buffet that used to occupy this building. This is a full-service restaurant, and although it also uses "South China" in its name, it is the antithesis of the 2-star buffet establishment that used to be here.
After you are seated by the friendly hostess, you are given two menus. The shorter "American" menu lists dishes familiar to diners used to "Americanized Chinese" restaurants: beef and broccoli, lo mien, chow fun, and the like. The longer "Hong Kong Style" menu lists dishes characteristic of the more authentic Southeastern Chinese dining establishments.  For example, you'll find Hong Kong style roast pork and roast duck, veggies such as choy sum and sweet pea shoots, various kinds of seafood and tofu dishes, and even dishes that are daunting for the less adventurous American diner (example: fried intestines). 
My friend and fellow yelper John M. (lucky guy, he lives near this place) and I thoroughly enjoyed our orders here. The ingredients were really fresh, the shrimp and fish so succulent and tender, the sauces very flavorful without being overly seasoned, the deep-fried tofu still silky and tender within, the fried rice treated lightly so that it was not greasy. Great food at good prices - most of the entrees are in the $7.95 to $11.95 range.
Glad to have this establishment here, especially since I'm in the Melrose District often.

I finally had the chance to have a piece of cake from Barb's Bakery and although the five pounds I gained from the cake hate me, my sweet tooth thanks me for finding yet another fabulous Phoenix bakery! Holy moly. If you are a fan of cake and cake that's soft, moist, sweet, creamy and perfect all in one bite, this is your spot. 

Barb's is an adorable bakery with a storefront full of everything from cupcakes and pastries to donuts and cookies. But it's her cake that gets her the five stars in my book. My youngest nephew (2 months) just celebrated his baptism and so of course that called for a celebration. I told my sister about Barb's so she grabbed the cake from there and brought it to the party. I could have started and ended with just the cake it was so good. 

The cake was the perfect size for our group and they did a wonderful job of decorating it in honor of the baptism with white and blue frosting, his name, date and blue crosses. It was a three layer chocolate with vanilla frosting cake. I originally asked for a sliver but when I saw how delicious it looked, I opted for a normal size piece instead. Is it bad that I consumed every last crumb in under five minutes? I don't think so at all. I would do it again in a heartbeat! 

So with that, I'm officially adding Barb's Bakery to my list of sweet spots.

Try saying Bobby Q three times really fast in a southern accent. It sounds like you're saying Barbeque.

I can't believe that I've been living in this area for a few years and I just started patronizing Bobby Q's. There's definitely a happening vibe to this place after dark. The place is packed and the air is buzzing with conversations and laughter. They have ample seating inside and outside. We met some friends that have never been here a few weeks ago and they became instantly hooked.

We ordered steaks, pulled pork, ribs and brisket. Everything along with the sides were fabulous. My brisket was tender and the flavor instantly transported my taste buds to a happy place. The pulled pork was equally as good. I've had the ribs on other trips to Bobby Q and have always enjoyed them. I got a big thumbs up on the steak from my dining companion so I'm going to have to try that next time I'm in the house. The tab for four people without alcohol and before tip was $70. 

This is definitely my favorite BBQ place in the metro area.

Ok, I'm upgrading this Sandwich joint to 5 Stars.....why?  Here's why:

I stopped in for lunch and saw their recommended Sandwich of the Week.....a Nachowich (Black Bean Patty, Cheese Whiz, Salsa, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Jalapenos, Avocado)....total with tax & a bag of Chips, $7.95.  It pique'd my interest and went for it, despite not being a Vegetarian.  Of course I added a few things....Pepper Jack Cheese & Hot Pepper Mix.

After a short wait, they called my name and out came my Nachowich.....I took one bite and was in Heaven!  Damn, that's a great Sandwich!  As I said before, I'm not a Vegetarian and unless I'm fasting, I rarely order a Veggie dish.....but took a chance on this recommendation and loved it!  It left me wanting more....I should have went for a 14" bad boy in this 'Wich!

They deserve the 1 Star bump.

Will I return?  Now I know where to go when I do my annual fast....you can bet on it!

Arizona's okay. 

Arizona when drunk is awesome.

When coming to Shotgun Betty's, your perspective will probably be influenced greatly by your expectations and also your gender. And, the time of day you visit.

If you're a guy and you just want to get drunk at a bar (and don't want to get dressed up to do it), Shotgun Betty's will satisfy your cravings both for liquor and eye candy.

The girls who work here are pretty much all 9s and 10s in a porn video sort of way (I mean that as a compliment), and they are all friendly enough, especially if you have a roll of dollar bills.

If you hand out fives and tens you might earn a nice, Cointreau-flavored kiss, depending on the girl.

It's crowded because it's such a low-pressure bar and they let in everyone. The drinks suck, but it's a dive and the girls have a "but I'm pretty" excuse going for them.

A huge percentage of the patrons will be total dirtbags and creeps, but what do you expect when the girls gyrate on stripper poles and there's no cover charge to get in.

If you're a girl coming to this bar, you'll be in the minority because most of the patrons are boozed up men, whose attention will be given to the hottie dancing on the bar in her Daisy Dukes and cowboy boots. 

If you come in for a boozer-nooner, and enjoy a meal at the bar, you'll find that the girls who work here are not mindless airheads. Not that they're going to work on the space station sometime in the future, but they're really cool.

Mixed drinks are much better during the day because there's not such a huge crowd, it's light outside, and the girls probably have more time to gin the tonics and coke the rums.

The music is mostly rock and roll, with bits of metal and country thrown in for good measure. Such a soundtrack always bangs, but after your fifth Jaeger bomb it's positively orgasmic.

So, when you come back to your real town, and your friends say, "Hey man, what did you do this weekend?" And you reply, "Went to Arizona," and they come back with, "Oh, sorry..."

--you can hit them with, "Yeah I went to Scottsdale."

"Did you go to Shotgun Betty's?"

"That's why I went to Scottsdale."

Who would have thought I'd find myself downtown at a rundown casino like Palace Station, but there I was on a late Sunday night enjoying one of the most satisfying dishes sin city had to offer! 

Yup, I'm talkin about the Pan Roast at Oyster Bar! 

Do yourself a huge favor and order the palace version with shrimp chicken andouille sausage and crab. I added lobster too. But either way, It's the bomb, cuz its all about that crazy good sauce! Keep in mind however, to truly enjoy this dish, you've gotta love your spice! Trust, each bite will be a scorching spoonful of fiery goodness! Chunks of meaty sausage, chicken and seafood in every bite and I bet you won't be able to put your spoon down! Well, except to wipe your forehead from the sweat cuz this bad boy is hot hot hot! But oooh soooo hot diggity good! I ordered a level 7 (1-10 being spiciest) and it was just right!

We started with 1/2 a dozen oysters on the half shell, and that was an excellent intro to our fantastic meal! The oysters were fresh and went down the hatch nicely with a swig of cold frosty Kirin! 

We also ordered the shrimp scampi. It came served with loads of succulent tiger shrimp, a heaping serving of fresh chopped garlic and noodles swimming in a pool of buttery glory. Although it was tasty, it simply couldn't hold a candle to the signature pan roast IMO! 

I'm tellin ya, order the pan roast and enjoy! Your taste buds and tummy will thank you for it!

Happy Eats!

While waiting for my daughter to finish a magic the gathering tournament at the nearby Little Shop of Magic, I wandered into Carlos' Kitchen and the connected Spectator's bar  I will review Specator's separately.

The menu in both locations is supplied by Carlos.  Carlos is a former instructor at Le Cordon Bleu and I am glad he came out to discuss Burger philosophy and general cooking techniques with me.  He truly loves the art of cooking and I enjoyed meeting him.

I started with onion rings which were lightly battered and fried to a golden glow.  The batter was unlike other batters as it had a sweetness to it.  I followed the rings with a bacon cheddar burger.  Now I have been searching for a truly great burger since I moved here.  I ordered the burger medium (I knew I was in for a treat as most places don't even ask).  The burger was perfectly cooked Angus beef with just the right amount of pink without being undercooked.  Carlos takes pride in the quality and flavor of the meat and it shows.  The bun was crisp on the outside and soft inside and the cheese was melted so it covered the top and sides but didn't fall out onto your hands.

This is one of the best burgers in the area and the price is right.  Burger, fries and onion ring appetizer cost me only $17.00.

I can't wait to come back and sample some of Carlos' other creations.  This is a diamond in the rough.  Don't miss your chance to meet Carlos!

The Brits have an expression, "Smart by half.' 

I was driving up Scottsdale Road and noticed this new location. I have been on Which Wich's mailing list for a while and remember getting a "Reverse Happy Hour buy one, get one free offer through August 15th" email .

I ordered two medium turkey sandwiches, with extra meat ($3.00 up charge) and a soda.  My thinking was that one would be free and the bill would be around $10.00 or so.  Instead I was told it would be $19.16. Seems the offer reads "order any regular size Wich and get the second Wich free".  Silly me.

The two mediums weighted almost two pounds each.  They felt really, really heavy.  I was impressed. But without that credit, it would have been nearly $27 for those two subs and one drink. Wow

So yesterday I thought I would try the same exercise, but with two "Regular" sized sandwiches.  Without ordering a drink, my bill came to $6.41 and the two subs combined weight barely a pound.

At this point I'm giving up on comparison tests. I'll be sticking to Jimmy Johns or Jersey Mike's.  BTW, both places were empty and it took nearly ten minutes to get my order. So maybe, "Subs, So Slow You'll Freak?" LOL

Sorry, Two Stars and  "Meh. I've experienced better."

After the Yelp event, I met Tony T. (The duke of Caf Teaze) in the lobby and he told me some of the Yelp crew ere going to the caf.  Off I went on Spring Mountain Road and after looking for a bit on the second floor of this mostly Asian food mall, I found Caf Teaze on the west side of the building.  

I also noted that Roger T. was already checked in here and he had created a UYE to celebrate Tony's birthday.  I opened the door and walked in to Caf Teaze to see lovely ladies and some Yelp friends.  I had been a bit reticent to come here alone, so now there was safety in numbers.  Soon others arrived and we had a fine time.

One of the ladies came for my order and I got an iced taro milk tea with boba.  Tony told me that was his favorite drink--hot--so next time I'll try it that way.  The tea was excellent.  It's served in a mason jar with a handle.

I soon learned that they have snacks and I got the chance to try some popcorn chicken Taiwanese style.  Wow, great!!  

The concept is fun and the ladies certainly provide great eye candy serving wearing only lingerie.  It's difficult to keep from staring and that's OK because that's part of Caf Teaze. I guess you could call it no guilt ogling. 

I surely won't get the number of check ins Tony has, but I'll be back--for the food, of course.  Oh, and the tea!  It's sort of like getting Playboy solely for the articles.

To see the ladies, look at Tony's photo, the first one.

After getting an ad in the paper for Lowe's I decided to stop by and check out the deals they were advertising. 

The store was clean. I checked prices on a couple work supplies I usually get at a different home improvement store in town but Lowe's prices were slightly higher. I grow a vegetable garden every year and wanted to check out the garden department. I was glad did! They have this nifty plastic rolling basket that has a handle you can pull up to pull along if you don't want to carry the basket. The rolling basket is also nice and deep to carry your plants. They have a nice variety of flowers and they were priced good. They had a nice variety of veggie plants that looked very healthy and had good structure. I never understand why some nurseries put out weak and frail plants so late in the season so it was nice to see these ones all healthy. 

I'm a girl so of course my review about this Lowe's is mostly about gardening and kitchen appliances! They have all your general home improvement needs as well it is just a matter of price checking to see which home improvement store at the time has the best deals. They have truck and tool rental as well. Lowe's does offer the higher end kitchen appliances but not at the best prices when it comes to the smaller kitchen appliances like blenders, mixers, processors etc. The smaller stuff can easily be found much cheaper at a variety of places. The bigger appliances like washers, dryers, & vacuums however are priced better then say Best Buy would usually offer. There were enough things I did like about my experience to come back so that I will!

I really love winding down a long night out and about on the town at Gentleman's clubs. My last trip staying out way too late (the kind where sunglasses are needed), my girlfriends and I found ourselves here. Usually, a male is needed in every group to enter and there is a cover; thankfully, my friend knows the manager, we were able to enter as an all girl group, no cover, and he bought our first round of cocktails. 

My friends and I found a lovely cushiony table by the main stage, perused the menu, ordered some food, and chatted with a lot of the ladies. Most of which were just hoping for some conversation at 7 AM on an late Thursday night/early Friday. 

I really fancy CH3 and was a bit bummed when my friends out voted me to come here, but it was a pleasant surprise. The Rhino is very dimmly lit, I even tripped over a few chairs. The club had an old boy's club kind of feel. I felt like I should be drinking a whiskey neat and purchasing a cigar and all the men should be lounging around in robes.

The girls were stunningly gorgeous. I didn't feel they were overally aggressive and quite a few of them came over and sat next to me and my friends and loved having general chit-chat. My favorite was a the entertainer named Vanilla. She was sweet, all-natural (I don't like anchor scars or other silicone parts). I definitely could watch her dance for hours.

I definitely loved The Rhino and will be back. It's definitely classier than CH3, but I like my girls a little dirty.

How can anyone complain about the ONLY service I'm aware of here in Vegas that will deliver food to you, while you dictate from your living room dressed in nothing but panties?

Really? I'm sorry y'all. I'm not following you here! You have a better solution, let me know. For now, all of my bets and money are with Road Runner Food on this one... For their excellent service and price for what they offer, I am truly a fan.

If it wasn't for them, I would have never gotten my ROTD on Yelp for reviewing Amore Taste of Chicago Pizza. Roadrunner was singlehandedly responsible for introducing me to this amazing restaurant. I always give credit where credit is due, and it is is definitely due here. All of this transpired from the comfort of my own home, while surfing the net in my panties. And yes, I'm gladly putting my own name and rep on the line by telling you that Roadrunner really rocks! I cannot stress this enough!

Sure, I have to put clothes on to answer the door but who cares? I still got to order in my panties and I relish in that fact! And to think that I just killed every guy's fantasy about delivering the "extra large sausage pizza" to my house in those last few sentences. Haha! I'm sorry.

Special thanks to Vicki for handling my order and making my day. This girl definitely deserves a raise! *a little hint hint nudge nudge for the higher ups that may be reading this*

I drank the punch, now after five visits, I'm either have an addiction or I'm a fan.

From the city that invented a Fre Kin Gud sushi roll and yum yum sauce springs Yonaka Modern.  The food is playful.  A fusion of Japanese / Peruvian / Argentinian cuisine popularized by Nobu Matsuhisa.  From the flavors to the presentation, this is the poor man's Matsuhisa (Beverly Hills, LA).  Oh yeah, it's good!

Dishes deliver a punch.  No monochromatic plates here.  Bold flavors that try to push the boundaries of sweet, sour, bitter in a single dish.  Excellent use of texture.  It is not uncommon to have a deep fried leaf sitting atop a piece of delicate fish.

Order an assortment of small plates and share.  

I won't ruin the "joy of discovery", besides the menu changes as specials come and go.  One day, teriyaki foie nigiri topped with candied quinoa, live uni another,   The menu staple, deep fried Brussels sprouts with lemon, chili, mint, and puffed rice is amazing.  It looks a mess but as a dish, it's comforting. Vegetal, sweet, sour, bitter; the perfect match to beer.  Ingredients are fresh and seasonal.

All nigiri sushi comes with a twist.  A sauce of this, an unusual garnish of that (hamachi with a spicy jalapeo miso and a cilantro leaf; unagi with togarashi and a leaf of Thai basil).  The rice is good and the fish fresh. Go crazy, order one of each.

Service is very good; friendly and attentive.  Prices are very reasonable.  Two happy hours (17:00-18:30 / 23:00-02:00) make it even more inviting.

One of the best in Vegas on or off the Strip.

A quick check list on what makes Mandarin Bar so awesome.

Floor to ceiling windows- CHECK
Best view of the Las Vegas Strip- CHECK
Gorgeous bar with a super sexy vibe- CHECK
Delicious cocktails and tasty small bites- CHECK

Located on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental, Mandarin Bar is a classy bar/lounge that boasts arguably the best views of the Vegas Strip. Seriously, the view alone should be enough to bring you here, especially if you visit once the sun has gone down and the lights on the strip are shining bright. 

My wife and I recently came here for a late night cocktail. This is what we ordered;

Lychee Smash- TY KU Liquer, Lychee Liquer, Pear Puree, Simple Syrup, Fresh Lemon Juice & Mint Leaves

The Golden Leaf- Hendricks Gin, Aperol, Muddled Mandarin, Pineapple & Lime Juice & Simple Syrup

I'm not going to lie, the price tag for one of their specialty cocktails is quite high. My wife and I each had one drink and our tab came to $36 without tip ($18 per drink). 
But in all honesty your not only paying for the wonderful cocktails, you're paying for the stunning views and the amazing atmosphere. Even if the drinks would've been $25 dollars apiece I still would've come here. To be able to sit back, relax, sip on a fantastic drink and take in the beautiful views with my wife was worth every penny. 

Check out the Mandarin Bar if you're visiting Vegas. Trust me when I say that it's a must see, even if you only stay for one drink like my wife and I did.

Hubby and I decided to stop here to have a drink and share a dessert after having dinner somewhere else. I have really wanted to try this place for a while, but it was not what I had hoped. I ordered a "Banana Mango Margarita" priced at $16 and it came garnished with a few banana gummies. The drink tasted good and I liked the banana sugar that rimmed the drink, but the banana gummies were so rock hard that they couldn't be eaten. Bummer. Hubby ordered a "Reese's Martini" also priced at $16 and it was rimmed with peanut butter. I tried a couple drinks and thought it looked much better than it tasted. 

We ordered the "Sugar Factory Fondue" priced at $21.95 and was disappointed. You can choose white, milk or dark chocolate and we decided to go with the milk chocolate fondue. It came with gummy bears, homemade marshmallows, white chocolate bread, brownie bites, strawberries and bananas. The gummy bears were so hard like the banana gummies that we didn't bother with them. The homemade marshmallows and strawberries and bananas were actually good, but the bread and brownie bites were dry and bland. 

We sat near a window so the Bellagio water show made for a nice view. Our server was nice, but our total including tax was $60.86 and that is just way too much for 2 cocktails and 1 dessert that were nothing special. I came, I tried, I doubt I will be back if I am picking where to eat.

Thanks to Preston's UYE at Lobbys, I now know the spot for a great burger in Tempe!

One of the things I love about Lobby's, its locally owned, and the owner takes pride in his shop!

After studying the menu for a minute I went with a cheeseburger & fries and was told to get some of that Lobby Sauce, I also heard that the Italian beef is the bombdiggity, I'll have to try that next time for sure. 

My burger was perfectly cooked! And it was messy too, but in a good way, everything on the burger tasted fresh too! Great flavor! The fries were delish too! Dip them in the Lobby Sauce and its game over! So good!

Glad to have tried Lobby Burger and plan on coming back soon!

5 Stars for the intimate Study Bar Alone... the best craft cocktails in Vegas!...yes that's a bold statement...Still, the rest of RRL is on point as well!

rose. rabbit. lie. is the latest happening at The Cosmopolitan.

It is billed as a "rebirth of the social club" and a "grand social experiment."  so, there you go...I'm sure that explains it perfectly.  Essentially what they have done is broken down the walls (some of them anyway) between typically separate venues like a restaurant, club, cocktail bar, and a live entertainment theater and brought them together in one spot.  The club doesn't start until after the last show, the restaurant is semipermeably divided from the entertainment, but the interplay creates a unique experience for sure.  There are several bars in the space as well--including one sensational place for quintessential cocktails...The Study...

The Study...  This niche bar is a small secluded treasure inside of rose. rabbit. lie.  They offer well-crafted, often boozy, but always balanced cocktails.  The Study serves up many classically inspired drinks as well as offering several modern variations.  The staff is staff here is elite and will work off the menu to delightful results as well.  The drinks start around $16 and are worth the price.

Nocturne is the show at RRL.  It is a whimsical interplay of circus acts...wait...or is it side show acts?...you'll have to find your way into the Cloak Room to know for show.  The shows are different at each time slot, but similar in concept.  I found the 8pm & 10pm shows to playfully fun and amusingly cheesy.  The individual acts range from tap dancers to contortionist; tight wire to burlesque; balance acts to aerial ropes.  In the same way that Coldplay is Radiohead Light, Nocturne is Absinthe Light.  Great in it's own right, but falling short to purists of the original.

Probably the best Pad See Ew I've ever had, but let's start from the beginning...

Immediately upon walking in, I was given... bar none... the most hospitable reception in my short history of dining.  It was comprised of a greeting (including being called by name) and a hug from the cutest little thing, who I had just met.

We started off with a chicken satay app, which was accompanied by a creamy peanut sauce and cucumber salad.  Removing the delicious skewered meat from the wooden spears brought me back to days of yore, when I would covertly poke my little sister in the closest appendage, with the sole purpose of evoking a squeal, all the while under the auspices of my no-nonsense parents.

My go-to Thai dish is Pad See Ew.  I've seen it spelled differently, but I'm hip.  This dish was one to be savored.... no, to be fawned over and then savored.  Using my meticulous chop-stick skills, I pampered each delicate noodle into my quivering mouth... which evoked blissful visions of lazily floating down the Chao Phraya river... and mind you, I've never even been to Thailand.

I'm not saying the dish was laced with opium, but at some point, I do recall fancying a ride atop an Asian Elephant passing through the seven levels of the Candy Cane forest.

My lunch companion, Chris, ordered the basil fried rice, which was more akin to an architectural wonder than an entree.  Using his meticulous spoon skills, I witnessed him moving mountains... of succulent rice and fixins... never to be seen again, for at least eight hours.

And just when I thought our culinary journey was disembarking, the same vision of loveliness appeared to my right, presenting a showpiece comprised of cake, cream and maraschino cherry.

Knowing my chop-sticks would only make a mess of things, I grabbed a spoon.  It had been so long... but it felt good in my hand.  A little cold.  I raised that utensil to the sky, and with an intense bellow, I cried "By the power of GreySkull, I shall have you as my own".  As I started my initial swipe, I noticed Chris had already gotten 2 or 3 bites in during the fanfare.

BAM!  The cake was bursting with coconut gusto, or maybe it was the ice cream.  I'm embarrassed to think of what I probably looked like as I descended into that dessert feeding frenzy.

I'd like to offer apologies to any staff and/or patron within line of sight.  I don't get out much, and unfortunately whenever my taste buds are stirred up like that, its plain and simple mob mentality.  I cant get in their way!  I wont!

After paying the tab, I bid a fond adieu to the huddled kitchen crew, and noticed their horror stricken faces.  The audible syllables "Mujumbo hielan friacah" lilted through the air as I passed... which I believe meant: "Great manly warrior"... no, my bad, wrong dialect... it actually means: "Portly destroyer with awkward shirt cleavage".

I look forward to my return visit, where I will exercise self control... or maybe just exercise

Oh how I love wine country... and now, thanks to Oakville Grocery, we've got our own little taste of wine country right here in the Valley!

While I anxiously anticipated the opening of this unique little gem, I finally made it in for a visit over the weekend... and there isn't too much more to add than what Aimee and Linda already wrote.  (Those bitches beat me to the punch!)

While I went in just to get a drink and check it out, I wanted to yelp about it sooner than later so more people will know about this recently opened grocery.  I can say, without a doubt that I'll be back soon.  One visit to this place is not enough.  Their salads and sandwiches look fresh and delicious, their pizza and prepared foods do too.  I love their espresso bar area and especially that they carry Julia Baker Confections.  Whether you're looking for a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, a snack or a full meal, to dine in or to take out, this place has something for you.

While I'd much rather transport myself to the original Oakville Grocery in Napa Valley, I'll settle for Scottsdale Quarter in the meantime.  Cheers!

If you have a longish lunch hour, go.  I went around 5pm tonight and there was nobody in front of me.  Took me 5 minutes to get my fish burrito (Thanks to Chris T for the recommendation!)
It was HUGE and came with a little cup of two salsas: green and red.  I cut it in half to enjoy the salsas separately.  
Filled to the brim with rice, cheese, beans and the fish and smothered in some sort of sauce, it was delicious!  
Service was super-friendly and everyone had a smile on their face and said "Amy, your fish burrito is ready!"  I mean, the personalized service was great.  Maybe hitting them at a slow hour was what did it.  There is a little retail spot where you can get incense (they're hippies, get it???) and posters on the wall to peruse while waiting.  I took mine home, but the patio is lovely.  There's even a vintage bike parked out front with little baskets filled with potted plants.  How adorable is that????

UPGRADE TO THE TOWER ROOMS!!!

if ur main goal in vegas is to eat eat eat, sleep sleep sleep, gamble and more eating, your room might not be of the most importance if your budget is ruled mainly by eating good food. For me: I just wanted a decent place to stay, close to the City Center, without spending a fortune on a room, that i would just use to sleep and shower. We took advantage of booking early to a discount and I spent about $230.00 for a fri-mon stay. The upgrade says Widescreen TV, but we didn't really care about that- the main difference from the other rooms is that it looks a little more modern. Beds were decent and comfortable : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o7AiTlyWUrBSzdz6oMHj5w?select=hEzxVsEJzj4_Bdm1CJoQFQ
Bathrooms were clean. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o7AiTlyWUrBSzdz6oMHj5w?select=ez1T5FamJ8MzAvyp94Zueg
I have crashed in some pretty ugly looking hotel rooms in vegas, and for the price and convenience, it was pretty decent! 
Check in was smooth, signing up for the Mlife playing card was a breeze since i registered ahead online, staff was friendly, but slots were not. 
They have a convenient food court http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o7AiTlyWUrBSzdz6oMHj5w?select=mvxEq1vTcSsHPYC5Kzwrnw.
There's always Thunder From Down Under (been twice for bachelorette parties!)- which is pretty decent too!

I used to think this venue was named for the dress size of girls in minidresses who lined up to get their butt cheeks stamped in exchange for free admission.  But, after making my way here last Monday, I'm guessing the name stands for Excess.

Because they spared no expense, friends.  This place is huge, the vibe is sexy, and the people are as beautiful as money can buy.  Especially on a Monday in Las Vegas.  It's industry night, so expect to shake it harder for free perks.  

We arrived shortly before Midnight and paid a cover charge ($20 for me; $30 for him).  Then, on a hunch, I dropped my name to a dude with a clipboard, he checked the guestlist (sign up free on the Wynn's website to be contacted soon by a promoter: http://www.encorelasvegas.com/#/nightlife/xs_reservations/) and then REIMBURSED us for the cover charges.  That's right, they said, "you shouldn't have to pay" and actually put $50 BACK on our card... which paid for a few vodka sodas for yours truly.

A cute gal wandered around with tequila and vodka-guava shooters.  Might want to ask how much they are in advance, since $12 a pop adds up when you offer to buy a round for your friends.

Fun Tip: Find the Las Vegas Weekly photographer on premises and get yourself featured in the online photo album here: http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/photos/2010/jan/26/128774/

We danced until 3am to hip hop mash-ups and had a blast.  Warm vibe from everyone on the indoor/outdoor dance floor - which helps when you fall on your face from 4.5" heels that weren't intended to be walked in and need strangers to pull a Humpty Dumpty and get you upright again.  Hypothetically.

Five divinely XSessive stars.

What I am about to say is going to be both hard to believe and incredibly shocking, but true. Completely, utterly, and brutally honest. Ready?

I would rather Z Pizza than any other thing on this planet. More than food, fame, wealth, love, sex, beauty... need I go on?

I have heard some less-than-stellar things about Z Pizza, so I have been giving my business (not THE business) to Pizza Heaven, but one fateful night I took an elevator ride with a Z Pizza delivery man who explained that they have both gluten free crust AND vegan cheese. It was awkward being that I had a Pizza Heaven equivalent literally right in my hand, but the delivery dude handled it with poise and handed me a magnetic business card.

Well, today it is rainy and I'm drunk and I was hungry and I didn't want to drive, so I gave Z Pizza a chance and I am so happy I did because my life changed today. 

Let me repeat that: MY LIFE CHANGED TODAY

This pizza, despite it being abnormal in every way possible, was the most delicious culinary specimen I have put in my mouth in MONTHS. Get the Mexican (sans chicken and sour cream, of course)... you owe it to yourself. You really, seriously do.

I love this pizza so much that in future trysts, I will fantasize about this pizza instead of my lover. I really will.

I hate this review because I cannot even articulate the words to do this pizza justice. I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy!

Oh, and PS... when I ordered they told me 45-60 minutes and it was here within 30. That's better than finding a rich guy that dresses well, doesn't have mommy issues, and is straight up hung. 

Did I just say that?

Excalibur Hotel is child's play compared to the elite hotel resorts of Las Vegas ... at 1/2 the price tag ... making it a deal for you bargain hunters or families on vacation. If you have children or need a "beginner" hotel for the whole Vegas experience, choose Excalibur.

Welcome to the future site of a cool five-star Vegas Mecca. Once they tear this down and build a new mega-resort, you can tell your grandkids that you stayed here back when it was Excalibur. 

Until then, here's what you'll find ...

 * Hotel Rooms ... nothing fancy, but you've slept in worse (probably)
 * A Casino with lower table limits and more frowns
 * A small Sports Book for Dad to prove he was right about the home team
 * Food is like choosing a restaurant at your local mall
  ... Excalibur Buffet ($23 for dinner and less for breakfast or lunch)
  ... Buca di Beppo - American chain of Italian-style re-heated food
  ... Dick's Last Resort - The Applebee's of Vegas
  ... A Steakhouse with $41 Rib Eye Steak or a 3-course Sirloin meal for $37
  ... Baja Fresh - Mexican Fast Food
  ... Food Court with Krispy Kreme, McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Cinnabon, & more
  ... Octane Lounge (Fri/Sat) & the "Lounge" are bars for adults to reminisce
 * Entertainment is great if you're letting mom plan your trip
  ... Tournament of Kings: Jousting banquet ($66) using your hands to eat
  ... Thunder From Down Under: Mom's/Girl's Night Out ($57 - $67) - chiseled abs
  ... Australian Bee Gees - Tribute show ($45-$60) not as fun as Fallon & Timberlake on SNL
  ... Fun Dungeon is a huge arcade full of games (10am-10pm)
  ... Pool with bar & food service full of kids taking a Dungeon break
  ... Shopping is limited to mall-style boutiques for kids and mom's
  ... A Wedding Chapel - Good luck.
 * That funky aroma you smell is annoyed disappointment ... or weed

For now, Excalibur survives as a low-end property in the MGM Resorts brand (with the MGM, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay, Aria, Vdara, Mirage, and Bellagio). Its prime location on the South end of the Vegas Strip at the corner of Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd is the future site of something much, much better. Til then, Excalibur has accepted it's cheap existence and you should, too.

I stopped by here for lunch and tried out their lunch special, 2 slices of cheese and a 20 ounce bottled soda for $5.95 including tax. There were 3 employees inside when I walked in who all greeted me and were very nice. They have tables inside and a TV. I sat at a table while my food was being prepared and it wasn't long before it was ready. I also asked for a "Cannoli" priced at $3.25 to be packed to-go and it was made fresh to order. The pizza was just so-so to me. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. The price was certainly right! The Cannoli was actually very good and one of the best I have had. Those alone are worth stopping by for.

They offer delivery to a wide range of the valley.

Similar to Alice entering another world by simply falling walking through the rabbit hole. Or John Mayer singing about his ladies "wonderland"s. As soon as you walk into the doors of L'Atelier you feel as if you are emerged into a colorful kaleidoscope, a seemingly whole new world. The shockingly colorful display of: shaved carrots, sliced cucumbers, bunches of on- vine tomatoes, and other produce set the frame for the ironically steely cool heartland, the kitchen. The colors of the produce are so vibrant that one can easily come to the conclusion that L'Atelier uses only the finest and freshest of ingredients.

There is no crap here.

The kitchen is somewhat somber and serious. Yet it is open and visible to almost every seat of the intimate restaurant. The numerous stations within the kitchen boastfully display; an army of methodical perfectionists that seem to express themselves not through emotions but through the bravado of flavors of each plate. The counter that serves as a moat keeps the regular people patrons at bay, and only seats about 20. The other seats in the establishment are geared for larger parties. But no worries, grab a seat at the counter and enjoy the show.

L'Atelier amused my mouth with a lovely foie gras with a port wine reduction and parmesan foam. The decadent, flavorful, and savory amuse bouche rolled off my tongue like butter.

We then moved onto a surprisingly refreshing buffalo mozzarella with vegetables. Basil, zucchini, sweet sundried tomatoes with spears of basil pesto.

Our next course was quail stuffed with foie gras and truffled mashed potatoes. (This was an additional dish not included in the $75 winter tasting menu).

Deep fried langoustine with basil. The paper wrapper was fairly thin and crispy so if I were you (instead of a fork and knife) I would opt to pick it up by the toothpick and stick it in your mouth pronto.

Hanger steak with onions. Be aware that L'Atelier cooks their meat the exactly the way you ask for it. My steak was a bit too rare for me.

Did someone say cheese? Fromage!

The sorbet and ice cream selection. Variety of tarts and cheesecakes to conclude our meal.

The highlights of my meal: foie gras parfait, mozarella and vegetables, quail and foie gras, langoustine, and tarts.

The executive chef, Steve Benjamin, reminded me of the Queen of Hearts. Luckily L'Atelier has 4 AAA Diamonds and a Michelin star to back it up. L'Atelier, your kitchen is a wonderland.

When I tell people where I grew up they often respond with "I didn't know people grew up in Las Vegas." True, it's a transient town but whenever I get together with fellow natives I find it hard to resist the pull of the buffet. 

This much I've learned: Atlantans have fried chicken. New Yorkers have bagels. Bostonians have lobster rolls. And we Las Vegans have the buffet. Though I managed to be in LV for less than 48 hours, I made sure a trip to the buffet with a couple of old friends was on my itinerary.

On Sunday morning we waited about 20 minutes in line for the chance to gorge ourselves on prime rib, mashed potatoes, creamy corn chowder, soft serve ice cream with Butterfinger pieces on top, shrimp, roast turkey with gravy, slices of cheese, sushi, grapefruit segments, champagne and a lot more that I cannot recall at the present moment.

But as I dug into my plate I looked across the table at my friends and said, "Now I feel like I'm home. . ."

I'm paraphrasing here, but this is how the typical customer service call went in almost all my experiences.

Cox - Hi, how can I help you.

Me - I am having trouble connecting to the internet at the moment. I've just finished resetting my computer, my router, and my modem. I checked all of my network cables, I'm able to communicate with other computers that are behind my router, and I just can't get to the internet. Is there a reported outage in my neighborhood at the moment?

Cox - Sorry to hear that. Can you please try unplugging your cable modem, waiting 15 seconds, and plugging it back in?

Me - Uh, yes, like i said, I just did that like a minute ago.

Cox - Oh, can you just try again for me anyway?

Me - I'm pretty sure there's a problem with the internet, can you just confirm if there are any reports in my neighborhood at the moment.

Cox - Are you sure it's not your wifi? Can you try plugging your computer directly into the modem?

Me - (getting upset at this point) Sure, I'll plug my laptop into the modem. ... still not working. Is there a reported outage in my neighborhood? I'd just like to know if there's an outage that is getting worked on or not.

Cox - I'm showing that everything is online and no outage. I think maybe you should try resetting your modem again.

Me - Really, do you have to ask me all these questions before you can answer if there is a reported outage in my neighborhood or not? 

Cox - Yes, we need to go through the troubleshooting steps first.

Me - FINE - I'll reset the dang modem again, for the third time.
Yep, still broke.

Cox - I think there is a problem with your cable lines, have you ever had trouble with mice? I know that sometimes animals can chew through the lines. If you'd like I can send a line repairman out to your house, but there will be a $100+ minimum charge to fix the cable lines in your house.

Me - are you serious?

Cox - Yes, I have seen this before.

Me - no, ARE.. YOU.. SERIOUS?
Do you have a supervisor I can talk with?

Cox - My supervisor is busy at the moment, and they will tell you the exact same thing I am. I have the same information they do.

Me - I really don't care, is your supervisor's supervisor available?

Cox - I'm sorry, why don't you try resetting your modem again.

Me - GIVE ME YOUR SUPERVISOR NOW, please. I no longer wish to speak with you.

Cox Supervisor - Yes, I'm showing there is a reported outage in your neighborhood and the service truck is actually working on it now. If you look down the street at the X and X intersection you should see them doing scheduled work right now.

Me - ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?! YOU'RE DOING SCHEDULED LINE WORK ON THE CONNECTION IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AT 7PM ON A WEDNESDAY EVENING? THIS IS REDICULOUS, AND WHY COULDN'T YOUR OPERATOR JUST TELL ME THIS WHEN I CALLED 45 MINUTES AGO?

Cox Supervisor - I am sorry sir, there is no reason to get upset at me the way you are.

Me - PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR SUPERVISOR CAUSE YOUR BEING BELIGERANT WITH ME RIGHT NOW.


Cox, this is the reason I dislike calling you, no this wasn't a one time, unique experience, I've had very similar conversations over multiple calls. I'm so glad the relationship we had has finally moved on, and I'm not looking back!

Move over Kuma, there is a new sheriff in the snow ice game, and his name is Frost Bites Shavery. Opened just a week before Kuma opened, this snow ice is taking it to a whole 'nother level!

I found out about this place from the KTNV news website. They were doing a piece on Jet Tila's Kuma that just opened up. Over on the comments page, a few people were writing in that there was another place doing the snow ice, and it was over in Henderson. After a so-so experience at Kuma, I decided to check this place out the next day.

Frost Bites Shavery is a freestanding food truck that is located in the same shopping center as Friendly Donuts on Boulder Highway.. You can usually find them across from the China Inn restaurant. 

When I saw the menu, the first thing that popped out were the flavors, more particularly, black sesame. The owner, Mikey, gave me a sample to try. Let me tell you, I had an epiphany. Here is why. 

When I went to Kuma, I randomly ran into Tony T. As we ate our snow ice, he told me that it originated in Taiwan. He also told me how to tell the difference between OK snow ice, and an exceptional one. The most important thing is the texture. When you eat snow ice, it is supposed to melt in your mouth, almost like freshly fallen snow. At Kuma, when you eat it, you can taste the crunchiness as you chew, almost like a sandy texture. At FBS, after a couple of bites, it melts away.

 Mikey, the owner, told me it took him months to figure the recipe out, and he agreed that it should be smooth, and not a sandpaper feeling. He was also cool to let me try any of the flavors that I wanted. I took samples of the green tea and mango, and they were much superior to Kuma's. 

I ordered the black sesame with mango, and he even put condensed milk on it for no charge. The mango was perfectly ripe, and had a bright flavor. For the black sesame, Mikey actually grinds real black sesame into the milk, and lets the flavors infuse before preparing the ice, and it is phenomenal. It was a stunning snow ice.

I'll be back here because of the great flavors, an awesome, generous owner, and the best snow ice in the Valley!

EDIT 12/2/2014: Chef Hong no longer works there.  Booooooo

I will definitely be a regular now that Chef Hong (ex-Moko) is bringing out his inventive dishes at Kanji.  The former Geisha House location comes off like an Epcot Center restaurant for Japanese food.  The multiple teppanyaki stations, large sushi bar, block wood furniture, full bar, high ceilings and bright lights are very welcoming.  The complimentary sake bomb (one of the best Yelp check-in offers currently) only enhance that feeling.  

Like an amazing movie sequel (very rare), all of Hong's beloved edible characters are here: beef short ribs, 30 hour pork belly, shrimp risotto, in-house smoked fish etc.  They're now being presented with some new and interesting twists from his original, wizardly recipes.  What stay consistent are the flavors, quality and creativity.  There are also some new plates like the excellent miso glazed Chilean seabass and 7 hour pork shoulder.  Seriously.....find me a local sushi joint that's pushing out entrees like these and I will wear a Britney Spears shirt for a week.  

They don't offer AYCE sushi, but the nigiri I've tried has been of excellent quality.  We were informed that they receive fresh shipments every two days which is pretty remarkable.  Kanji also offers a killer late night happy hour from 10pm-2am Monday through Saturday that I plan on checking out pretty soon.

It may be Tryst or Pure or whatever "Sexy name" club on the strip for you during your Vegas trips, but for for a dive barrin' gal like myself, it's the Double Down. ...well at least it is from now on.

Always expecting dives to be at list a smidge too hot and muggy, I was pleasantly surprised by a blast of cool A/C when I walked in and remembered that A/C is an absolute must everywhere in Vegas - even in dive bars. 

And it is a dive. Through and through and through... although with surprisingly clean floors. In fact, after reading about the Double Down and having knowledge of a drink called "Ass Juice," I was actually surprised at just how clean the Double Down was. DOn't get me wrong, it's not pristine, but they keep it in pretty good shape. Must be due to all that puke insurance they offer.

"Puke insurance?" you ask. Yes, puke insurance. For a mere $20, my friend - if you puke, you are not responsible for cleaning it up. Somehow I don't think this is offered on my AAA policy. 

Now, on to the (in)famous drinks. The Double Down falls under my philosophy of "Just because it's the 'original' doesn't make it the best." And that's sadly how I felt about the "original" bacon martini. It wasn't that bacon-y... but at least it was super vodka-y, so you get your $6 worth. 

The ass juice... well, I was thinking of it wrong. When I hear "ass juice," before you're even finished saying the words, I'm already grossed out. So I was expecting something pickley and briney and gross... turns out it's a girly drink with peach schnapps in it. I've decided that it's gotta be called ass juice, as in "Dude, I'm going to get so much ass with this juice."

Strong drinks, ridiculous names for drinks, puke insurance, semi-surly barkeeps... all things for a strong 4-star dive. What bumps 'em on up to 5? Pinball. Not just any pinball - the Playboy Pinball machine. One of my faves. I was bummed that the flippers didn't quite work all the time, but I'll take what I can get... plus they had a photobooth and pool to add to the mix too.

Next time I've been wiped out at the Blackjack tables in Vegas, you'll know where to find me.

24 hour buffet run...It sounded like a good idea on paper....But after one meal, I vow to never eat again...lol

The theme of this place is so adorable and cute.  We went for brunch so we could get a taste of lunch and breakfast.  I didn't think anything was really a standout, most buffet food tastes the same to me.  

I stood in line at the crepe station for a long ass time...it wasn't really worth it to me, but it was still pretty good.  

There was so many different eggs and breakfast meat/sausage type things, I always wonder why white folk come in hoards for breakfast...it always tastes the same to me...

One of best hotels in the world. The Wynn hotel is located on the old Desert Inn hotel. It's the only hotel on the strip with a golf course. If you are a person who loves the European decor and beautiful artwork you are in for a treat. As we all know Las Vegas has a lot hotels from low end to high end. 

If you are a person who enjoys high end hotels you must give this hotel a try. The casino is done with outstanding artwork with great art finishing. If you are a high roller or a person plays the slot you will enjoy the great casino layout. The hotels is gorgeous from  A to Z. If you are a picky person when it comes to hotel beds you are going to love the beds here. 

If you are coming to Vegas you must give the spa a try. One of the best spas in the world. If you are buffet lover you will enjoy the outstanding food. I highly recommend  the Sinatra for high end dinning. If you are looking for something more low key check out the country club. You can have lunch over the patio that overlooks the golf course. 

Being a big fan of Caesars Palace for may years the Wynn is my new playground in Vegas. All the way around this is a 5 star resort.

If you're looking to be wow'ed by a Las Vegas buffet, look elsewhere, toots.

The Feast Buffet located in the Palace Station Hotel & Casino is very affordable for those looking not to spend a lot of money for an AYCE.  Here's my 2 cents on my mealtimes, in chronological order-

Lunch - A step-down from your local Hometown Buffet.  There is a grill where diners can ask for slices of roast beef/turkey, burgers, hot dogs & brats.  Located next to it, is a pasta station where pasta is made to order with whatever choice ingredients the diner desires.  The rest of the hot/cold foods were decent, but nothing extraordinary.  The dessert section was nice w/ various cakes, cookies, sweets and the obligatory nonfat froyo machines.  Overall, meh.

Dinner - See lunch, but w/ a few extra items scattered hither & thither.  Not worth the extra cost, IMHO.

Breakfast -  Now we're talking!  Several egg dishes, mounds of bacon, biscuits & gravy, country fried steak etc.  There is also an omelette station where diners can have an omelette their way.  The dessert section had most of the same items from lunch/dinner, plus various doughnuts and other items.  

The Feast Buffet is an affordable, no-frills buffet.  I recommend breakfast over lunch & dinner for those interested in checking this buffet out.  I had free buffet vouchers, but if I had to pay, I would stick to breakfast.

Excelsior!

About a year and a half ago Yelp hosted a Non-Profit "Yelp Helps" evening downtown in Phoenix.  It was an incredible event that in some ways changed my family's life.  

You see, after putting on my name tag and riding the elevator up to the event, I was greeted by our Yelp Community Manager Lindsey, who in short order handed me the cutest Chihuahua named Christian.

Christian was so small and clearly very frightened by all the noise.  I walked around the various organization booths, stopping at the Lost Our Home area while hold Christian.  At some point Lindsey asked for him back; and sadly, I said my goodbyes to the little guy.  

The next day, I found myself searching on-line for the Lost Our Home website.  Looking over their requirements and of course, the pups.  Don't get me wrong, I call all dogs pups.  And guess what?  I found a cute little Morkie  named "Chloe" on their Adoptions page.  See photos.

A Morkie, I learned, is a Maltese and Yorkie mix.  I made a few phone calls and arranged for one of the Volunteers to stop by my home with Chloe to see if she would feel comfortable with our other dog, Oliver and our two cats.

That Sunday, Chloe arrived and she seemed to fit in really well. After the volunteer left we had our family discussion and it was a go!  Later that week we adopted Chloe and she was dropped off at my office soon after.

What you need to know, is how straight forward and easy a process adopting a "foreclosure" animal is from Lost Our Home.  They have many Veterinarian who offer their services on a per diem/pay as you can basis.  It will change your life.  trust me!

BTW, they are looking for Volunteers.  Hint. Hint.

From Chef Marc Sgrizzi of Parma comes an outstanding pizzeria.  Wow!

Note:  This is the sister restaurant to the original opened in Centennial under the name Novecento Pizzeria.  Same menu, same phenomenal quality.

Chef Marc's passion for sharing his craft shows.  Truly Italian.  It results in great food and a light atmosphere.

The pizzas are crafted in the Napolitano way as set forth by the Italian government.  Personal pizzas, 11 inches in diameter, thicker crust than Roman pizzas baked in a wood burning (they use almond hardwood) at 900 degrees  for literally 90 seconds.  The extremely glutinous 00 flour from Campania  creates a very chewy, well blistered crust.  

Sauces are well made, with the classic crushed San Marzano tomato puree being very good; not to thick with sweet, acidic tomato goodness.  A spicy version has good heat and chili flavor.

Toppings are designed for the quick cooking.  Quality throughout with excellent house made sausage and its hints of fennel, moist and toothsome meatballs, sweet seasoned eggplant, tender artichokes and fresh mozzarella.  Of cause, being America and being trained by a place whose slogan was "have it your way", there are a large number of other toppings that can be added.  Want peaches, figs, pineapple, even smoked salmon and pesto, go for it.

Simple starters including a delicious chopped salad loaded with salami, oven roasted peppers, and gorgonzola and dressed in a zesty red wine vinaigrette, oven roasted escarole and beans dressed in olive oil and house sausage.  

Very friendly counter staff.  No waiter service.  

Despite its greatness, authenticity, and low price, it is still eclipsed by Settebello Pizzeria Napolitano with slightly better seasoning, crust flavor, quality toppings, ambiance, and wine program. 

Regardless, Wow!

Three words... bone-in-filet or is that really two? I'll leave it to the more talented wordsmiths to do the math. Last Friday I had one of the better filets of my life. Cooked to medium-rare perfection you can't really get a better steak. Also watch out.. their pretzel bread is insanely addictive, just say no (actually say yes, eat a couple, then have them take the rest away). I'm a steak purist and it's worth noting they do add some butter to the steaks after they're cooked, if you're like me just ask to opt out. 

Service was good, but know the ambiance is a little old school. The musical act in lounge reminded me of that two person band in the movie Swingers... cheesy, but you don't really hear it in the main dining room.

Sweet Addiction has done something amazing here -- they managed to scoop up the nostalgia of Thrifty ice cream, smother it between some freshly-baked cookies, and smack me in the face with deliciousness.

The folks here weren't kidding around with their store name. There has to be something around here to satisfy even the sweetest of tooths. They have a variety of items here, including something more unique: frozen hot chocolate. However, for my initial visit, I had to try their signature cookie ice cream sandwich.

I went with strawberry cheesecake ice cream with some oatmeal raisin cookies. The cookies literally just came out of the oven. They were warm, soft, and wrapped around the ice cream nicely. The ice cream slowly fused with the cookie as it slowly began to melt. Combining these two powers seemed unreal. I was expecting Captain Planet to come around at any second.

I took a bite and was floored by shock. This was delicious.

It's not often that I'm excited about a new place, but an amazing staff, coupled along with an extremely reasonably priced (and delicious) menu is enough to keep me coming back for more.

Pro-tip: Check to see if any cookies just came out of the oven. Those go so well with the ice cream.

Since we were staying at Palazzo, it was ideal to do some pre-partying at LAVO. As hotel guests, I'm sure the Concierge could have hooked it up for us, but as I knew a promoter, my girls and I got a VIP table and open bar from 11pm-midnight. Really, the BEST way to pre-party on a Sunday night.

LAVO is a really nice spot for lounging, especially for a group of girls. The whole space is very chic and intimate, with the restaurant on the lower level and the club on the top. The cocktail servers are all gorgeous - loved their hot corset dresses - and very attentive. Once we were out of a drink, they were right on it. 

The crowd was very mixed - an all ages kind of spot. While it was awesome to see a female hitting the decks, the music was also very mixed and after Mariah Carey's "Fantasy" came on, it was our cue to leave. Not that I have anything against Mariah, but I like singing that song at a karaoke club.

Tip: The promoters all hang out inside the restaurant, and they're pretty easy to spot as they're the guys in suits on their Blackberries surrounded by women.

Where do I begin... well, let me start by saying you don't matter to Mandalay Bay unless you're a 'whale' (their term for big time gamblers).  If you're here with your family for a vacation and just looking to have fun -- sorry, even if you can afford it, you're not getting a cabana.  You're lucky to even get a chair.  They will -- as they've personally told me -- physically remove you from a cabana if one of their 'whales' so happens to desire the cabana you're in.  It's their policy.  They might make up for it by giving you a lawn chair out in the 110 degree heat with no sun protection... you know, where you belong!  Equivalent to 'let them eat cake' in my opinion. 

Furthermore, let's say you're like me and you do happen to gamble a lot.  Maybe you've even made their second highest status (Platinum) like me... yeah, that doesn't matter either.   In fact, on two separate occasions now it has yet to matter.  They say Platinum members are given "priority cabana reservations" ...  What they mean to say is, "you can call us at a special VIP number only to have someone say 'sorry, get lost' in a little nicer tone".  It's a complete joke.  They only care about you if you are losing the kind of money that could run most cities for weeks.  

If you are spending money on dinners and shows and suites and whatnot... get lost, they don't want your business.  If you have a chronic gambling problem and don't mind paying the electric bill for Vegas while you're there... Welcome to Mandalay Bay -- let me kick this family out of a cabana that they should never have been allowed in in the first place!

Just as an aside -- I've only had this experience at MGM properties.  The Wynn, The Cosmopolitan & The Palms actually apologized to me for the treatment I received from MGM properties.  I can tell you honestly they don't treat their guests this way.  Nobody should!

I don't get to Five Guys as often as I should, mainly because they started out my way on the east coast and are pretty much everywhere.  So I basically ended up with a case of burnout.  But since it was National Cheeseburger Day, and we were on a tight schedule for lunch, we decided to stop in since it was only a block or so from our hotel.

The thing to realize about Five Guys is that a "little" cheeseburger is actually a normal-sized burger anywhere else.  A regular burger there is actually two patties.  So from there I went with a little bacon cheeseburger, with all of the fixings.  And I immediately realized my mistake in overlooking how good Five Guys is.  It was just a delicious burger, perfectly moist, and bursting with flavor.  Hotdogs have always seemed to be a weak spot and that was still the case at this location.  For as complex and delicious as the burgers are, the dogs are always plain and one note.  Even loading them up with toppings doesn't help.

Note that an order of fries is a massive portion.  You can choose between regular or cajun, but either way you'll have your fill of carbs for about a week.

But don't make my mistake and overlook FG.

How many bites does it take to get to the lamb filled center of a gyros-pop?

I'd say one, cause if you can't find gyros on the first bite, there's probably something wrong with your order ;-) ... are you sure you didn't order the chicken?

And you thought I was going to say something deep and meaningful, you obviously don't know me that well.

Cypress Grill is my favorite place for a gyros in Central Phoenix. There's a handful of them around (gyros spots that is), but if you're looking for a gyros and within a few miles of this place, I'd say skip all the rest. I've tried at least five or so spots that serve em nearby. You'll spend a couple bucks more here than at the other places, with a gyro running you about $8, but I'm happy to conclude that Cypress is my favorite gyro in town.

The hummus here is good, so is the spanikopita and dolmades. For those of you who are carb counting, you can get your gyros in a salad too. I've done that a few times myself. All in all a solid choice for medditeranean dining - one of the better spots in the area. 

Happy Yelping Phoenix!

I used Bryant Pest Control after moving into a new house. The guy who came out to do the service spent about 20 minutes spraying the inside and outside of the house, even taking time to show me the "hot spots" where the cockroaches were hiding out and the different varieties of cockroaches taking residence in my house/yard (ick... but cool to get the knowledge). I signed the paper saying that the service was complete and the guy left. No issues whatsoever with the actual service performed. 

Later that evening, I got 6 text messages from the guy who sprayed my house (must have gotten the number off the service order because I sure as heck did not give it to him). He was saying some very inappropriate things about me and his "desires." I text back saying that I had a boyfriend. He then, sent me 5 more text messages that were equally, if not more, inappropriate as the first set of texts. 

The next workday, I called in to the office and spoke with one of the owners, letting her know what happened and my concerns. She stated that she had "known him for years and couldn't imagine him doing something like this." I felt like my concerns were blown off over the phone, and never received a follow-up letter or phone call, which I believe would have been good customer service, especially in this situation. I have since been receiving calls about once a week to schedule another appointment despite me asking them to stop calling. 

I now am using another company for my pest control needs.

Authentic, Home Cookin' Korean!

As you can see from my photo, I'm a white dude, but growing up around lots of Korean friends and culture, I definitely know my way around a few H.O.T. albums and jars of kimchi in the garage.  The food at Mashisoyo is homey and authentic in the best way.


The owners greeted me with sincere smiles as I walked in for dinner on a Thursday evening with a friend.  We sat down in front of a TV playing some K-pop stuff, which is still entertaining, even if your Korean isn't so good.  

We ordered the Seafood Soon Dobu (tofu soup), and the Haemul Paejun (scallion and seafood pancake).  The Pancake was HUGE, and full of lots of tasty shrimp, calamari, and octopus.  I like my Paejan crispy, and because of the size of this one, some parts could have been cooked a little longer, but it was still very tasty.  The soon dobu was delicious, and had more seafood than Finding Nemo. Lots of mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari made this eat more like a stew than a soup.  It was hearty and spicy and wonderful. 

Mashisoyo is hidden in a small shopping center across the street from Walmart and next to a Tropical Smoothie place on Ft. Apache. 

  Make sure you come check out this repeat-visit-worthy, mom and pop tofu stop!!

After much delay, Autostrada is finally open, surprisingly with little fanfare.   The couple we were meeting had trouble finding the new Italian osteria in DC Ranch.  Apart from a large red "A" vinyl on the doors, there was no other signage.  It's located at the intersection across from The Armitage.

The menu is simple and straightforward at very palatable prices - nothing is over $18.  Food is encouraged to be shared family style.  All of which sounds like a great concept in a recessionary environment.

None of the antipasti piqued our interest so we jumped straight to the pastas. Fettuccine with scallops and mushrooms ($17) and orchiette with pork sugo and peas.  The marscapone sauce on the fettucine was deliciously creamy although a touch heavy handed.  The pork sugo was a bit too sweet and the dish just fell flat for us.

For the main, we shared the roasted sea bass with fennel and tomato ($16) and NY strip steak (pre-sliced for easy sharing) on potato and sunchoke puree.  Both were solid dishes.  Steak had great flavor but oddly it was not sliced across the grain and had a little gristle.

Our favorites were the contorni (aka sides). The tiella - baked layers of eggplant, zucchini & tomato topped with parmesan was packed with flavor and delicious just as Gabi said.  The baby artichokes were fried to a nice crisp on the outside contrasting nicely with the tender interior.

For dessert, we chose vanilla bean panna cotta with sliced strawberries and the marscapone tart with poached pears and spiced walnuts.  Again both were solid dishes.

The interior has an industrial cool vibe to it with a long metal bench running along the wall and a stainless steel walled kitchen that runs across, separated by glass so you can get a full view of the action from most of the dining room.  There is an equal if not greater number of seating outdoors including tables for up to 8.

Autostrada serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It is Chef Aaron May of Sol y Sombra, Over Easy and The Lodge fame's latest dining destination.

We had Melman bucks. So we came for dinner. Just four of us. But holy shit. They fed us like we we're three hundred pound men. Don't get me wrong. I love food. But there's enough, and there's just too much. We split a pasta as a first course. It was adequate, taste wise. But portion wise? How one person could even think of ordering it for dinner is beyond me. I would blow up. Wafer thin? I think not.

We followed with baked clams which were pretty darned good. I like to put a little finely grated lemon rind and romano in my homemade version. I tasted both in theirs. I may sue.

We moved on to a chicken saltimbucca, which was actually quite good. We followed with a salad. I could see the dissapointment in the servers face. When we only asked for espresso after, she seemed sad. 

I almost felt sorry for her. I guess she's used to people who live a week off the leftovers. We did, however, enjoy some very nice wine. So I think that may have made her feel a little better.

We came here for a cup of coffee and decided to order some eggs and bacon. Clearly bacon is their strong suit and the coffee was really very good as well.

I decided to come back the next day and see if yesterday was a fluke. Since we generally liked our original visit over a year ago but at the time we found things somewhat uneven.

Well the good news to report is that since my first visit with fellow Yelp'ers and Pepper Head Mark, things have improved. Service can be a bit slow during busy periods, they have definitely improved. The sad sausage I had eighteen months ago has been retired. It's been replaced by a very flavorful one (see photos).

Today we ordered the French Toast and the Oink's French Toast. The latter is just over the top sweet and a bit too much for this gourmand. While the regular French Toast would be enjoyed by every Gourmet as being just right. Look that up in your Roget's. LOL

Expect to pay $15 each if you don't order a 4 piece (1/2 flight) or 8 piece (full flight) of their absolutely delicious thick flavored bacon. If you do, and I would recommend that you do, then expect to pay accordingly, around $22-$25.  But ohhh, but it's sooo worth it!

Enjoy!

The Lion's Tail Tavern is a drink-forward, gaming bar with one of the best names around!

Billed as an American style cocktail bar with a Vegas twist, The Lion's Tail Tavern fits right in at Village Square.  It's a locals kind of establishment where I could easily see regulars coming to gamble a little while they get their drink on.  They are classier than the typical Vegas neighborhood bar, but still maintain a warm genuine feel. 

The Lion's Tail Tavern is straightforward in their approach--serving quality drinks (with some elevated options), lots of seats for gaming, big screens to watch the game, and of course... Golden Tee to keep things real.  Those familiar with this area of town may know Danny from Three Angry Wives.  One of the nicer bartenders around, he knows how to take care of players and is now the general manager at TLTT.

I also understand that you will be able to order from Bachi Burger (next door) to satisfy your hunger needs, and that they will bring your food over to you!

I don't frequent gaming bars, but had an enjoyable experience here.  5 stars for drinks, gaming, viewing and purity of focus.  If you're not into gaming this is probably not a spot you'll be dying to come back to, but if you're looking for another option to incorporate into your weekly routine they are solid option to play on West Sahara.

:::::PROS:::::

Clean, clean, clean.  The cooking environment, the floor, the condiment area, the tables - all spotless.

Cheap, cheap, cheap.  Most burritos are in the 3-dollar range, and you can't beat the quality for the price.  The chicken burrito incorporated medium spicy shredded chicken done just right, and the breakfast burrito used eggs, ham, cheese, onions, and green peppers to get it done.

Breakfast served all-day!  I know other Mexican restaurants do the same, but given the fact Fiesta Burrito is tantalizingly tasty, it just sweetens the deal.

Great Pico De Gallo, and Red Sauce at the condiment bar!  Need I say more?

:::::CONS:::::

None.

Fiesta Burrito is nice and bright on the inside, and so seemed it's staff.  I believe the crew were truly enjoying themselves the day I went in and the smile on the man's face while washing the floor was refreshingly genuine and sincere.  Its obvious that its a well-run establishment, but its also one of those places that makes me wonder because the food IS so cheap...

Seriously.  How can places like J in the Box and McD's sell Chicken Sammies for a buck?  And the three dollar burrito?  I just can't see the profit margin...  But then again, I've never run a restaurant.  I mean - Fiesta's ingredients can't be that cheap, right???

Regardless, Fiesta Burrito is great bargain, and the food that I've tried so far knocked my socks clean off.  Check it out.

Mother Bunch Brewing was the place picked for November's Breakfast Club UYE, I had been excited to try this place out, I was one of the many in the valley waiting for Mother Bunch to open there doors. We were very surprised to find out when we arrived it was in fact the very 1st weekend of debuting their bunch menu.

Let's start with the place, it's a great space, I love the pews they have as seats for the long tables, like the openness of the bar. This place just makes you feel at home.
Like I said it was the debut of the brunch menu and boy did they have plenty to choose from and great deals.  Each deal comes with a choice of  drafted beer, mimosa,  bloody mary, sangria for either 10 bucks or 12 bucks, depending on what dish you order, I think that's a bangin good deal!

I went with the Tri Tip Eggs benedicts with a sriracha hollandaise sauce, home potatoes and a mimosa for 12 bucks!  The eggs benedicts was delish, the sauce was great just wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be, but ask for a side of sriracha and you can fix that for sure! The home potatoes were a perfect side for this dish!

They do not have a child's menu, but they do make exceptions, I did have my 1  1/2 yr old grandson with me and for him I ordered an egg, home potatoes and orange juice for a total of 6 bucks, WHAT?? Man he ate like a king too, it was supposed to be one egg scrambled (eggs are what he likes) but it was a huge plate of scrambled eggs, he demolished too! 

Mother Bunch is a great place for breakfast, very excited to have tried the menu and look forward to coming back for more!

Tourist trap alert!  Tourist trap alert!

That's what first came to mind when I dropped by to have lunch in the awkwardly-capitalized Gordon Ramsey BurGR in the Planet Hollywood hotel.

Even at 11am -- before the doors had even opened -- there was a *massive* line at the front door, wrapping along the ultra-sleek fire-and-glass exterior and extending into the casino.  My heart sank a little, since the prospect of a 3-hr wait did not appeal to me whatsoever.

The good news was the wait was only 5 minutes.  I skipped the line and went straight to the bar, which has open seating and serves the full menu.  (I recommend the bar to everyone trying to eat here.)  The interior is absolutely gorgeous, with no expense spared to make the atmosphere contemporary and hip.  Even the utensils are high-end.

The menu is long, and the portions are massive.  It's very easy for your eyes to overestimate your belly's capacity here, so choose wisely.

For lunch, I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and a side of Maui parmesan onion rings.  I was bummed at just how average they were.  The burger tasted like jalapenos and grease -- and nothing else.  I couldn't discern the beef, the cheese, nothing.  And at $14, this burger was wickedly overpriced.  I ate about half the burger before I didn't want any more.

The onion rings were better, but not by much. The crisp was nice, but the dish was underseasoned.  No salt, no pepper.  The dipping sauces helped a bit.  I preferred the aioli.

Service was fast.  Very fast.  Fast to the point that I was being rushed out of there.

I'll skip this tourist trap next time.

Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat

Marquee Nightclub was packed. The music was thumpin' and the drinks were flowin'. Who cares if there were more dudes on the crowded dance floor than ladies? We were there to jump and dance ... and after quickly staking out a spot in the middle near the front, that is exactly what we and a few hundred of our new best friends did.

Tip #1: Stay at the Cosmopolitan. Go online and book a room because it includes free admission to Marquee through a much shorter line. It'll also give you a place to freshen up before hitting the club and crash/party afterwards. Ask for a room in the East Tower for convenience to Marquee.

Marquee Mondays makes Marquee a reason to stay in Sin City an extra day. The EC Twins and Nadia Ali performed on the Monday before Christmas and this was like an early gift from Santa.

Tip #2: Get on the main dance floor early cause by midnight it was wall-to-wall people with almost no one getting in or out. Many "couples" were frustrated with the tight quarters, so, come prepared for bumpin' and jumpin' with people from all around the globe.

DJ Lisa Pittman worked it at the pool while Eddie Makabi and another DJ pumped up the beats inside before the headliners came out around 12:30. Nadia did a 30-minute live set which had the crowd frothing and then the energy reached a peak with the frenetic twins.

Tip #3: Get a table if you aren't planning to stake out a spot on the crowded dance floor. If you are just wanting to chill at a club, the outdoor pool vibe and tables may be best or get one of the prime spots inside so you and your crew can dance in your own area.

Drinks are expensive ... of course, and table service is crazy expensive. Plan accordingly.

Marquee was a blast. We loved the vibe, the confetti, foam light sticks, blasts of cold air, and non-stop beats. If you get free admission to Marquee while staying at The Cosmopolitan then it is easily a 5-star night for any EDM fan.

I'm not a gambler a drinker, so LV is not really my kind of town, unless I'm off the strip. The Rio is just that, a little of the strip and closer to where the locals go. 

Upon arrival, I was upgraded to a larger suite, SWEET!!!. The room was very nice, looked clean, didn't smell of yesterdays smoke, alcohol, or any flow play. The bed was a nice comfy size, king. Not sure why the t.v. is placed on the side wall, kind of difficult to watch in bed even have to do the head crank when seated on the couch, opposite the bed. 

The bathroom was fairly clean. I don't understand why hotels especially of such caliber don't wash their shower curtains. Upon inspection, I opened the curtain an almost hurled because of the sour smell the curtain spewed. It was nice to see that they automatically provided those little things you tend to forget, such as toothbrush, toothpaste and shower stuff. The vanity area is a bit odd, nice that there is a single cup coffee maker, but why put it on a shelf and one has to pull out and place on the vanity counter. Couldn't they just raise the shelf above to give the coffee maker enough room to open for water and the coffee packs? I was tempted. 

The casino itself is like any other, noisy and people everywhere. The downside is the HVAC. It must be the original unit since every time I walked out of the casino, I smelled of stale cigarettes. Yeah, I didn't spend much time there. I did, however, spend enough time to try their Pho restaurant. I will be writing a review for this place, so I won't say much here except, that was Pho? Blah. 

The room was nice and the price was good, should I go back to LV, I may consider staying here again.

This place ruined my weekend. I came to Vegas to get married and was told by a friend how incredible this place is expected to be. So I looked it up and on their website, this place looks phenomenal! 

I'm a firm believer in getting one chance to make a first impression and as soon as I park my car and unload, I realize the parking lot elevators are broken. As if carrying luggage down 4 flights isn't bad enough, we get to the check in counter and it literally took each front desk person an average of 20 minutes to check in each guest, us included. Finally, we get to the room and I will say the ambiance is nice, but the room sizes are tiny. Turning on the tv and it says it has a "server error" aka it doesn't work. I plan to ask the GM if we can cancel one of our nights so that we can relocate to the Venetian. 

I probably should have done my due diligence and checked the yelp reviews before booking, but I guess I didn't expect many flaws from a brand new hotel.

An all American steakhouse.  No Australian Wagyu.  No A5 Japanese beef.  Just USDA Prime Nebraska corn feed beef and American comfort food sides that bring out the best in the beef's flavor.

Rule one:  Stick to land.  Visit it's sister restaurant, Lakeside for well prepared seafood.  This is a steakhouse.

For starters, classic foie.  Served incredible thick cut, beautifully seared with slivers of apple, apple puree, tart huckleberries and vegetal celery leaves.  Beautiful balance. Pure decadence.  The charred steak tartare with the classic Worcestershire, Dijon, chives and crumbled egg is equally good.  The slight addition of the heat tightens up some of the beef and releases it's beef flavor.  Good texture and another flavor dimension.

To the steaks.  USDA prime, well aged, extremely well trimmed.  All steaks cooked to temperature, juicy and tender.  Top props to the 28 day, dry aged tomahawk.  Complex, nutty, slightly bleu cheese flavor of the dry aging and deep beefy goodness near the bone.  Win!   The porterhouse for two, the best way to enjoy both the filet mignon and the NY strip.  Less complex flavor but a steak lover's steak.  Once again, excellent beef flavor nearest the bone.

A well made variety of sauces are offered that enrich or brighten the steaks but then again, why rob yourself of the great American beef flavor?

Sides are very well conceived.  They enhancing the smoky, umame characteristics of the beef.  Top props to a great late season creamed corn topped with shaved black truffle.  Sets off all kinds of earthy fireworks when paired with the beef.  Sauted wild mushrooms (enhance umame) and grilled jumbo asparagus with the hint of vibrant lemon juice (contrasting flavor enhancing the beefs natural sweetness) all great choices.

Service is steakhouse familiar and efficient.

Excellent wine list. Good vintage depth.  New world emphasis.  High Vegas resort pricing.

Consistent.  Several repeat visits (thanks to the Wynn Classic tourney).  An American steakhouse that hits the mark.

After hearing I could get a Vegan Hot Dog, I finally made it down to food truck Friday. 
Let me tell you the anticipation was killing me. I saw the long line and knew it must be amazing, none of the other trucks had a line like theirs. 

I really had my heart set on a Vegan corn dog but was told that unfortunately the Vegan dogs don't stand up to the heat of going into the fryer, it was a sad day. 

I opted for a vegan dog with sauerkraut, relish and mustard, and although I was told that the bun/bread wasn't completely vegan as it had trace amount of egg in it, I went ahead and got it anyway. 

WOW, one bite and I saw the face of DOG! 

This was by far the most sinful experience I've had in a very long time, words cannot describe the magnitude of flavors that were dancing around in my mouth, it was completely euphoric. 

Short Leash Dogs are simply amazing, and as I write this, I'm already plotting my next visit and you should too! 

P.S. 
For all you non-vegans, don't worry, they have a fine selection of meaty wieners just for you.

The park looks small, and there are few amenities offered.

TIPS:
1. Complimentary towels are not offered to anyone; this includes gold pass holders and cabana guests. Bring your own.
2. There are VERY few lounge chairs available. Most are in cabana areas, you are expected to bring your own. You are able to bring your own lounge chairs.
3. If you went to Wet'n'Wild years ago, you'll be disappointed by the few rides that are available here. The size of the park is 1/4-1/2 the size of the original. Good news is that they have plenty of room to expand.
4. No outside food or drink is welcomed. This includes bottled waters. Call ahead to bring in food for any family members with food allergies and make sure you get the name of management that pre-authorizes your home brought lunch.
5. Very few areas for shade. Bring an umbrella.
6. Don't forget to bring a couple extra towels for your family and plenty of sunscreen!!
7. Leave your inner tubes at home, they aren't allowed even on the lazy river. They provide life jackets for younger children that may not be able to fit comfortably into rental tubes.
8. GET THERE EARLY IF YOU WANT TO RENT A TUBE! They go VERY fast, after 5 minutes of doors being open- they're gone.

Overall, this water park doesn't appear to be a full day event unless you have very young children. 6 hours is probably the max I'd stay, and that would give you time to ride most of the rides. 

Food offerings include Oasis cafe, Agave Grill, Dip'n'Dots, Auto Creamery, Fresh'n'Go Market, and Snowie.

I quite like this place - unexpectedly. A few people I know weren't really fans but after a couple visits, I think I'm a fan. Here's why:

- Their drink specialty seems to be brewed tea, combined with some form of milk and other subtle flavors. So far nothing I've tried has been over-the-top. Always subtle. The oolong, for example, gives a great aftertaste of oolong tea even though you might taste a sort of milk tea initially.
- Sweetness options are upfront and preset - meaning no percentage guesswork. You just say a term and they know what it means already.
- Customer service exists... and it's good! I was checked on a couple times each visit to make sure my drink was to my liking.. or they'd remake it for free until I did. This is unheard of for boba in Chinatown.
- Their boba has been perfect. Smooth on the outside, chewy to an exact consistency that I like. It's also honey-sweetened.
- I think nearly all their options are dairy-free, meaning no lactose! I like this.
- It's clean, and looks nice inside.

The only thing I didn't like was the taro drink. It wasn't the flavor I expected. I think most, including myself, are used to that artificial and intense sweet taro flavor and that's not what they serve.

Anyway, I think this is my favorite spot for tea-based drinks. They key here is subtle flavors and I really appreciate that. I'm going to keep trying something new every visit and keep this review updated!

When I was 21, young & dumb, I'd go to Vegas and engage in a list of shenanigans and feel unapologetic about it all.  Now that I am quite older, I have the rationality to know when I'm acting (a little) crazy.  After a long Sunday... yeah a Sunday night... I would like to the apologize to the following people at Carnaval Court:

1 - Sorry to the girl who got on the dance floor and 1 sec later lost her filled cup of booze to my flailing, electrified arm.  Luckily, she looked at me, stared, shrugged then went back to the bar.

2 - Super sorry to the 5 gals sitting at the round booth.  I am sorry I left my sweater there are forced you all to watch it and not spill anything on it as I repeated annoyingly that I would be extremely distraught if I lost the sweater.

3 - Apologies to the female whom I unkindly told that her boyfriend couldn't dress and that his vest look was 'so early 90s'.  I was even luckier that she did not slap me in the face (and I am pretty sure she dressed him).

4- All kinds of sorry to the security guard for putting up with a drunk and belligerent Asian with glasses.  This same Asian yelled over the music and danced spaztically around while happily ordering bartender's choice shots, then stood up, quickly gagging on them.  

In short, this bar is AWESOME! They check IDs, but there is no cover.  You can also DANCE outside to a live band which is actually a decent, talented group of guys.  More importantly, the bartenders are not only knowledgeable of how to pour a #$%^ drink, but also do it with some flair and a smile. Props to the bartenders working here! Drinks are normal price for The Strip, but they aren't weak pours by any means. Lots of the people were locals who were loyal fans / regulars.  I think I made 10 new friends... and whether they wanted to talk to me or not- does not matter! I was on a mission to have a good night and succeeded.

Visit 8/14/12

This little popcorn shop is located on the Eastern Ave corridor between Silverado Ranch and Serene. It's near BJ's and East Ocean. Parking is ok but can get crazy.

There's a lot of food and dessert options in the area. This store has a great modern style decor and good vibe.

I stopped in right before they were ready to close but no problem, the staff was friendly and not even trying to rush us. Plus they let you sample anything and try what looks good.
If you have tried it do the pickle flavor popcorn cuz it's just oddly a cool taste.and you'll buy it aftre the taste settles. I LOVE NEW STUFF!

The store has very good displays of the actual products which is good to visualize. Plus menu boards and easy to understand descriptions and prices.

Prices a little high if you just say I'm getting popcorn, but worth it.

All around great experience and good small business.

This was the second time I have been to Ajo Al's.  The first time was about 10 years ago when I first visited Phoenix.  I remembered it well.  I like the atmosphere.  Warm and welcoming, lots of cool are and things to look at.  I did not know this was a chain until I read the other reviews.  This is no Chevy's though.  This is far better, in my opinion.  The chips and salsa are fresh and flavorful and plentiful.  The basket they bring you is huge!  I had chicken flautas and they were delicious.  They topped them with guac and pico de gallo.  The rice was fluffly and moist and the beans were good too.  I only had ice tea but that was some of the best ice tea I have ever had.  I don't know what made it so good.......I mean it's ice tea, but I downed two glasses of it in no time flat.  

I know there are tons of other non-chain mexican places in Phoenix and I will try them all!!  I love mexican food!!  But I will come back to Ajo Al's too.  I'd like to try a margarita next time.  :)

From the Italian powerhouses Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich  comes... a burger joint???

How does it stack up?  Accepting that Hubert Keller's Burger Bar with it's selection of top grade beef and well prepared, gourmet toppings is the supreme high end burger and Bachi Burger at the other extreme for delicious creativity, B&B Burger fits right in the middle.  (Sorry, clowns and kings don't even count as food in this burger arena).

Breaking it down, the burgers are firm and juicy, with a good blend of different cuts of beef, aggressively seasoned, cooked to temperature with a good outer sear.  Small selection of well made toppings (sauted mushrooms, fried egg, avocado, caramelized onion), decent selection of cheeses, great sauces (jalapeno pesto, balsamic mustard, Chianti mustard, garlic aioli, truffle aioli).

Order as a "build your own" or from preconceived selections that feature "The Drive-Thru" (take on In-n-Out's burger, griddled patties with processed American cheese on a sesame bun in a paper wrapper)  slumming it on the Strip or a great "Morning After" (sauted mushrooms, Fontana, egg, truffle aioli and frisee) AKA Midwest heart attack.  Both are good eats, classic, comforting.

A selection of Heroes for the non burger eaters.  The crispy cod is very good.  Deep fried, crisp, moist cod with a refreshing slaw and spicy jalapeno tartar.

OK sides.  Chips crisp and flavorful, onion rings, sweet with a crisp coating, fried pickles good acid but excessive coating makes them oily.

Service not perfect but Strip friendly.  Well chosen selection of craft beers.  Vegas resort pricing.

The average tab, just ONE green check.  Hey, you're in the Venetian.

My favorite spot to chillax and unwind in Vegas! The only Korean spa in town, and they do a bang up job of keeping it awesome.

I've been here a few times in the past when I really need to get away. When the Groupon became available, I jumped at the opportunity. It may not look like much from the outside, but inside, it's high brow all the way.

After checkin, always make sure to give them your ID in order to get a pair of slippers to use around the gym. And shower before using the spa, hot tub, and before going upstairs to the communal area (and please dress in your given uniform before heading up!)

Upstairs in the communal area, there are a bunch of rooms heated to high temperatures to get you to sweat out the toxins. My favorite room is the one with the little balls that you can lie on! When it gets too hot, head on over to the ice room to cool off.

There are recliners and tv's where you can chill. In addition, there is a small cafe where you can buy food items. After sweating out a lot, I like to pass out on a recliner :D

Great fun, and you can stay from opening to closing if you want, but a few hours should be more then enough. Great to go with friends and family as well!!

You can take the boy out of Chicago but you can't take the Chicago out of the boy. Being from Chicago, I've been meaning to try this place for ages.I mean what a cool name, Chizona, pretty easy to figure it out, some McHenry, Illinois guys running a CHIcago place in ariZONA.

I was jonsing for their pizza since it smelled so good but after having pizza two days in a row, I opted for the Gyro and fries. The gyro came with onions, tomatoes and tzatziki sauce plus cut fries with the skins on them. I love the fries, they give you a very generous amount. The gyro was great as well, My wife loved their Italian Beef and said it was better than Al's Beef (sorry Al). My only complaint is there isn't a self serve soda machine, just cans of soda for a dollar. I'm definitely coming back for some pizza because it sure smells good.

I've just finished my own personal challenge of writing 100 reviews in 2012.

This is more of a rebuttal and a little update to Bautista's K (the owner?) review since I was mentioned in it.
 
----"As for Shirley B. - was very surprised to find this review redundant. As if it was to sabotage a business and give a review only on the 3rd day of "soft opening" -"----

Am I understanding this right? I am being accused of sabotage? I sure hope not.
 I cant take this unwarranted accusation lightly and feel the need to address it.
 
I normally do write ups after a first visit to new places but my review was based after a second visit (2/10) to this place a week and a half later, not on the 3rd day of soft opening (Jan 30) that Bautista K comprehended. .  Go over and reread my review again, 4th paragraph where I mention my 2nd visit.
  
As for redundancy, I cant help that since both visits when I ate there, temperature wise, the food was not hot enough. Which by the way is fact since it was reflected in SNHD inspection a day later coincidentally after my review was written. Update:  I'm happy Bautista's  took proactive steps and corrected it and now rockin the A grade.

For the most part my review was positive as I mention food tasted good, prices reasonable and friendly staff. Some people think I'm way too nice and too generous with the ratings I dish out. Sorry you take the overall review as sabotaging your business but I still stand by my original review.
 
I sure hope the accusation is just a misunderstanding. All who know me know I am a big advocate and supporter for businesses in our community and only want to see everyone succeed.  Even your business here in Vegas Bautista K!  Happy to hear you are doing great with all the new dishes I see you are now offering  and possibly look forward to trying them one of these days.

Forgive me Joe for i have sinned . i visited your little restaurant a month ago for breakfast and never reviewed it..Yikes!!  Well here is the scoop I really enjoy the food, ambiance and downright hipness of Liberty .Can I can you Liberty?   The breakfast was super tasty and now I have eaten dinner here as well.  Hubby and I ventured out to Gilbert on our way to Pinetop ..yeah it's on the way. 

We split two entrees . Plus one had the Apricot Chicken, yummy  and generous with a grilled /slight char and a tasty apricot glaze that didn't scream sweet. The veggie with it was asparagus also grilled and a interesting sweet potato mash with a savory taste that I ignored because I kept loving the stuff on my plate.   For me I had a flat iron steak with a Chimchurri sauce that made me smile. I also had a garlic mash potato   which you cant go wrong with  and tasty grilled carrots . 

We also had the red velvet cake which had a smooth texture and a light cream cheese frosting that really made it. 

As always the service was friendly and prompt and made me want to come back.  

Love the decor so updated modern farmy , how do they do that? I also love the unisex  bathrooms with recipes on the walls, yes I took pics hope the recipes turn out!

I've always had mixed feelings about the Cheesecake Factory.

I am not much of a cheesecake aficionado, and they have always struck me as an icon of american food excess.  The few times we've eaten in one, we have always left with a bagful of leftovers capable of feeding a third world family for a week.  A slight exaggeration, but not by much I believe.

On the positive side, Cheesecake Factory makes some really interesting and tasty dishes.  I have also found that I have become susceptible to subliminal messages while watching Sheldon and Leonard discuss their BBQ Burger on Big Bang Theory. LOL

So here I was shopping at the Mall and wondering about lunch, when I walked passed Cheesecake Factory and thought of Sheldon and Leonard's discourse.  See link: http://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/series-1-episode-5-the-hamburger-postulate/

So instead of their preferred BBQ Burger, I went with the Classic Burger for $10.50 (see photos). Wow it was huge (maybe a 1/2 lb.) and very, very good. 

A couple months back we were in LVS and had an enjoyable dinner at Gordon Ramsey's "BurGR". This burger is a close second to that carnivorous experience. I'll say it again, wow. 

Cheesecake's Classic Burger is grilled on an open flame and it picks up all that smokey taste from the grill. A nice touch was the sliced grilled red onion which is served on top. 

In summary, an absolutely Four Star Plus experience; and yes I am a Fan. Maybe next time I'll try Sheldon's BBQ Burger. Hmm, I just realized my review feels more like a Chuck Lorre vanity card. LOL

Enjoy!

I went here on a Friday after work for some dinner. The parking can be a challenge so have some patience. 

I have had this place bookmarked for several years but I have never really found myself in the area to take advantage of this place. I was trying to decide on a couple of Korean dishes. There was one that was cooked in a skillet with rice and the dish that I finally chose was the Spicy Korean dish with beef and noodles. I'm really not a more spicy the better aficionado. I don't mine a little heat as long as it compliments the meal. I thought the spiciness to this dish was just right. They give you a huge portion and our waiter was always there to refill my water glass because my mouth was en fuego at times.

The cost was under $12 and a good deal for the amount of food received. The service was excellent and my wife really enjoyed this place as well. I will be back!

October 15, Florida stone crab season OPEN!  Crab lovers rejoice!

Why?  Simple; sweeter than an lobster, tender, juicy, never stringy meat.  Dip them in a tangy mustard concoction and it's fireworks in your mouth.

The facts:
- Available October 15 - May 15.
- Sold by size (medium, large, jumbo, colossal), price increases with size.
- Size matters for texture not sweetness.  Buy the largest you can afford.
- 2013 harvest starting at the lowest in history.  Astronomical prices ($12/claw large, $25/ claw jumbo).

For other menu items, stick to basics; KISS.  Great place for a casual, shared meal with friends.  Solid preparations for grilled lobster tails, steamed jumbo Alaskan king crab legs, classic oysters Rockefeller, and pan seared diver scallops.  The colossal lump crab cake excellent, moist, sweet.  Almost all crab with lumps sticking out in all directions.  Pick it up and eat it with your fingers.  

Good selection of steaks.  Two grades, USDA choice Angus and USDA prime.  All prime cuts are bone in.  Cuts are gently trimmed leaving some of the outer fat in tact.  Old school, fat is flavor style.   Even grilling and cooked to temperature.  It's beef, nothing fancy but it doesn't need to be.

Diverse side meant to be shared.  The grilled tomatoes are the perfect foil for the stone crabs.  Tart, acidic, blistered and  just warmed through.  

Save a little room for dessert.  Home made key lime pie.  They are known for it.  One of the best examples I've ever had.

Short but very well chosen wine list.  Whites perfectly target the clean seafood flavors from Spain, France, Italy and New Zealand.  Modest (2x-2.5x retail), Vegas resort pricing.

Casual, friendly, efficient service.

Seven sinful months in Sin City never tasted so good.

I'm horrified by my experience today. It. Smelled. Awful!

And here's the thing. Gyms probably naturally smell awful. But it's the staff/gyms job to not let that smell linger. Of course there's going to be sweat, B.O. and God knows what else lingering long past your work out. But I'd think it should be one of the main objectives to keep it smelling fresh, because you'd want to keep people coming in.

But here's the thing. I'm paying for not only the use of the machinery, but also the actual space. Do I want to work out in a place that smells like stale B.O.? No way! I want to work out in a clean, properly air conditioned and comfortable space. None of these things are happening here right now. 

That brings me to my next point. Every summer the place suffers from stale and poorly ventilated air. What does that mean? It's freakin' hot in herre! I'd understand you wouldn't want to work out in an ice box. But this isn't a sauna either. It's awful and you can tell it's not supposed to that way. 

I'll leave you with this final fact. I hopped on the elliptical today and there was gum on the front part where you'd put your cell phone. Seriously?? That's rude for the person that did that, but rude that no one would clean that up. I'm honestly disgusted at this point. 

I hope they clean up their act (literally) or I may take my sweat somewhere else that does a better job masking it.

Our first Fox restaurant was Sauce, which we like very much and continue to go back for both lunch and dinner.

Since then, it's been mostly down hill. We have been to Blanco twice, North once and now The Greene House.  My feeling with each of these places is that they're one or maybe two food items good.  The rest is just m'eh!  

Clearly the Fox group knows how to make a very good, flavorful taco. Four Stars good, both here and at Blanco. As for the rest of the story, to paraphrase Paul Harvey....  

We came here yesterday for a light lunch. I spotted the Tuna Tartar tacos on the menu and knew I had to try them.  At the time, I hadn't seen any of the posted pictures on Yelp. Too bad .

The tacos were three tiny, minuscule things about three inches wide.  Our server did try to warn us they were small and asked if I wanted a fourth?  Sure, I said. So three tiny tacos for $13.00 and the fourth for $4.50. Were they good?  Yes. Were they better than the ones down the street at Tommy Bahamas? Sadly no. 

My lunch partner had their Fish and Chips for $15.00 and was very unimpressed.  "Bland and nothing special, mushy and greasy" were his exact words.

The lunch bill for two came to $38.75, along with one Iced Tea.  A little pricey for a Two and Half Star experience.. 

Sorry!

The Ogden is a great place to live if: a) You work for Zappos or b) You work for or are otherwise affiliated with Downtown Project. I fit neither of those categories so I didn't have a great time living there.

During our time here I had other residents ask me if I worked for Zappos or Downtown Project or if I knew Tony Hsieh or whatever. When I told them I didn't, the response was invariably the same: "Then why do you live here?" After a while, I began to wonder, too.

The building is very nice and clean. The units are spacious and well-appointed, and there are amenities like a nice pool and gym. Most of the concierges are pleasant and helpful. This is where the second star would come from if I was feeling generous, but I'm not. There is also a pet relief area outside but as is typical among apartment dwellers, many residents did not clean up after their dogs.

The HOA is obnoxious. We would get emails constantly announcing that this or that was no longer allowed- like how pets were only allowed in the freight elevator? What?

The typical resident is young and parties a lot. They all seemed to get along amongst themselves but for those unaffiliated with the scene revolving around Hsieh and Co., it is difficult to meet people and socialize. There is a residents' only mailing list that my husband asked to join... he was told he could not have that information. There is also a constant rotating stream of guests who use the building as a hotel. We had some on our floor for a while who kept leaving garbage outside their door instead of taking it to the trash chute, like a maid was going to come clean it up or something.

Finally, the security. The security guards here are universally awful and on a continuous power trip, but one in particular is just terrible: Jason. Say hi for me if you see him. Here's my favorite Jason encounter: My husband parked in the loading zone in the garage for a couple of minutes while he ran upstairs to get something and, you know, LOAD it into the car. Jason told me we could not park there and told me to move the car. I did not have the keys.  I tried to explain this but he escalated the encounter and eventually threatened to have me arrested and removed *from the building I lived in.* (He knew us and knew we were residents.) On another occasion, while parked nearby, security told us to move because we couldn't park there... and then it turned out they wanted us to move so someone affiliated with a Downtown Project-backed business could park there instead. Classy.

Anyway, I hated living here. A lot of people like it and it's certainly the nicest place to live in downtown Vegas, but the culture of the building (Zappos dorm) is obnoxious, unless you're into that sort of thing. I probably would have liked living in Las Vegas a lot more if we'd just bought a house.

Headed to the Windsor for bunch for June's Breakfast Club UYE, with a turnout of 17, one of the things that made Windsor a hit from the start for me was the fact that I was able to make reservations! WOOT WOOT! It makes everything so much easier!

I can't lie before I even got the Windsor I had checked out the brunch menu and was 95% sure I was going to go with the Windsor Eggs Benedict, and even though they have a Bloody Mary Bar for 5 bucks, I wasn't going to tempt myself with that because honestly Bloody Marys are not my sort of thing.

After sitting down and looking at the drink menu, I saw something that looked interesting and needed a try and it was a bloody mary drink too! I was mind blown that I was going down that path, but It's The Verde Bloody Mary, made with cucumbers, roasted poblano, cilantro & watercress, damn this drink was DELISH!  They do have a bloody Mary bar with all your fixings, pickles, spices, salts & garnishes but for me, this drink was perfect, it didn't need anything. It was spicy, it was heaven!  If you do not like spicy don't order it, for me damn it was great!

After sipping on my Verde I no longer was interested in the benedict and wanted a spicy dish to go with my drink, so I went with the Matador, two eggs over easy ontop of griddled cheddar potatoes, crispy tortilla, salsa verde & avocado relish, while waiting for everyone's plates to come out I spotted some of the benedict dishes and was starting to get plate envy, they looked soo good!  Then the Matador made it to me, this dish was amazing, the salsa verde was great the egg & potatoes combo with the avocado relish was just explosions of flavors hitting your tongue, and it went very well with the Verde Bloody Mary, the only thing  I didn't really care for was the crispy tortilla, but it was a great dish for sure!

I am happy to have tried the Windsor for bunch, look forward to checking them out at all different hours, and I know Ill be back soon because I am already craving that Verde Bloody Mary.

Rosati's Pizza is my go to pizza joint. They are basically a carry out place. I live too far away for delivery. So that tells you how far I'll travel for an excellent tasting pizza.

They currently have this special where you buy a large and get the medium (excludes the toppings) 1/2 off. I hope I haven't let the secret out on that special. It's been going on for well over a year. I always bump into a lot of Chicago people when in here. I always get a bigger pizza than I can eat since it's the perfect breakfast food. After all, who can resist some reheated pizza the next morning for breakfast!

I really like the thin crust but my family prefers the deep dish. So I'm stuck eating deep dish all the time, lol. This is the best tasting pizza I have had in Arizona. The Cenpho folks might want to venture out of their box and try this pie. This is something even the east coasters would enjoy. 

Once in awhile they'll even mess up your order but they are quick to rectify it if you give them a chance. And once in awhile they'll even burn your pizza a little. Even with these rare annoyances I keep coming back to this Rosati's location every time.

3.5 stars

I guess you can say I have a little bit of chef-crush on Tom Colicchio.  I mean, he's not the only one.  I guess another one is Hubert Keller.  But I digress.

Creeping in the shadows of his Las Vegas fine dining eatery, Craftsteak, is it's more laid back, little brother, 'Wichcraft.  Nice play on words, Tom, nice play.

The layout and decor is pretty laid back and simple, which obviously is the point of a casual eatery.

They have a decent variety of cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, paninis, salads, and a couple of soups, as well as a couple of sweet items.  I eventually decided on a panini that had roasted pork, coppa, pepper relish, and fontina cheese on country bread.  It came simply wrapped in parchment paper but did not include a side, no chips or anything.  Oh well, whatever.

I opened up the paper and it appeared somewhat simple and smelled pretty good.  Upon first bite, the pork was pretty good and not dry and the fontina cheese was good.  The bread was not too crunchy, thus the top of my mouth was saved from being ripped to shreds.

While it wasn't the best panini I've ever had, it was still pretty good and I hear the breakfast sandwiches/paninis are pretty good, so next time I'm in Vegas and find myself at the MGM, I would probably stop by again.

I HAVE URGES... 

"There is a human urge to clarify, rationalize, justify", said Leonard Bernstein. 

That sounds like a good description of Yelp, doesn't it, but that's not the urge I have. 

This definition is a better fit: 

a. An impulse that prompts action or effort. 
b. An involuntary tendency to perform a given activity. 

I have an urge to go to Las Vegas pronto. 

Do I like to gamble? Yes, sometimes. 

Do I like seeing some great shows? Definitely. 

Do I like going to the International CES, the world's largest consumer technology trade show? Oh, yeah, so much fun. 

Do I like staying in some great sexy hotel room on the Strip? You better believe it. 

But none of these are the reason for my urge. My urge is to go to a little nondescript shack located in a questionable, seedy area away from the Strip. The only strip this place is close to is the Olympic Gardens Strip Club that offers male and female strippers, and where lap dances go for 20 bucks. 

I need to go to Vegas because I want me some ice cream from Luv-It Frozen Custard NOW! 

Frozen custard is French style ice cream. It's lower in butterfat and calories than ice cream, and is made with eggs, which gives this indulgent concoction a creamier texture. It also has much less air whipped into it, and there are two types of air I don't like: people full of hot air (no, I'm not telling now) and ice cream full of air. 

I don't even like Sundaes, but at Luv-It Frozen Custard I am simply hypnotized by everything they have. Western Sundae, their most popular - vanilla custard, caramel, salty pecans and hot fudge? Give it to me now, before I get arrested for yanking it from the hands of some unsuspecting Japanese tourist! Bumble Berry Sundae? What's in it? Wait, I don't care, just pile it on! 

Everything is homemade, frozen custard flavors change every few days, so check their website, if you want to know what specific olfactory and oral pleasures to look forward to. Even their website looks hokily homemade, which in this case is just charming and consistent. 

So, if you want some frozen nirvana, if you're tired of seeing same old, same old corporate clones that look identical in LA, Johannesburg, Vegas and Moscow - this is the place for some instant bliss. 

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas...   I wish Luv-It frozen Custard didn't.

It was our second day in Vegas we wanted to get a pedi.  Although we were staying at the MGM we did not want to try their Spa and was looking to find a place off strip that was reasonable.  Yelp app to the rescue!  Found Elan Nails and Spa.  They didn't have a lot of reviews but the ones they did have were all really great.  

We came in about 11:30 and asked for a pedi.  We really would have liked to have done a mani as well but we were meeting friends at 1:00 and didn't think we had time.  The place is way off strip and more into the residential area and is in a strip mall.  It's a small place but they had about 6 massage chairs against one wall and the other side where they did mani.  The staff were all young and friendly.

Picked out our colors sat in the comfy chair and got our foot soaking for a good 5min before they went to work.  Let me say one thing about the chairs.  They massage your butt!!!   

My nail person Christina was awesome from beginning to end.  I didn't do the gel thing but the color didn't chip and had stayed on 2 weeks with no problem which show how well it was painted on.  The cost was very reasonable at $22 and they worked pretty fast.

Locale ~ Way off strip on the Westside!
Services ~ Nails, Facials, Eyelashes and Waxing.

At last, Mr. Lee's Woonam Jung adds AYCE Korean BBQ to their menu. Ordering their tender, delicious Kalbi a la carte certainly put a hole in my pocket. As tasty as it was, I had a difficult time paying $30 for a plate of it on top of whatever entree I ate. Sura has some serious competition now that Mr. Lee threw his hat into the AYCE KBBQ ring. 

For a measly $26 at dinner, you can fill your three stomachs with all the Kalbi you want and your other three with bulgogi, chadolbaegi (thinly sliced beef brisket), samgyupsal (pork belly), dak (chicken) bulgogi , deh ji (pork) bulgogi plus the steamed egg and doenjang jjigae (soybean soup) traditionally served with a Korean BBQ meal. Given you have six full stomachs and still have room to spare, all of this and more is 'bottomless' and you still get a 5-star worthy selection of fresh banchan. 

Think of those pricey front-loading washer/dryers. Yeah, those shiny, fancy ones that are so quiet you can take a nap in the laundry room. They're considerably less annoying than their top-loading ancestors. Where am I going with this? Woonam Jung uses the fancy front-loaders of BBQ hoods--nearly silent and 1,000x more efficient. You won't have to project your voice over a noisy fan and you'll go home smelling like your perfume of the night instead of grilled meat. 

While Woonam Jung doesn't look like much from the outside, the inside is nicely decorated and has this Asian tranquility thing going for it. In short, it's a more luxurious establishment to stuff your face. If you want to up your dining experience or fancy up the act of over-eating, Woonam Jung's food presentation, modern plates, and cute server uniforms will not disappoint.

AYCE BBQ is available at lunch-time. But I hope you like bulgogi because kalbi isn't served until dinner. And if for whatever reason you're not into the AYCE BBQ thing or great deals make you feel cheap, BBQ is still available to purchase a la carte and their other entrees are flat out delicious! The yukgaejang and dolsot bibimbap are two of my favorites.

LAS VEGAS RESTAURANT WEEK!!!

$20.00 3 course lunch!!!

I wanted to hit a bunch of places for LVRW, but i could only make it to this one plus dinner at Del Friscos. I read some previous reviews that this place used to be alot more high end, and made some changes to make this more of a tapas place with a bar. It definitely looked more price friendly and $20 for 3 courses was a steal!

I started off with a nice caesar salad, complete with a tiny anchovie and yummy fontina and brioche croutons http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=i2U5iJLxkTWXSHQAdivVNA

The shortrib sandwich was next http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=LcQPsvafLFyw9GLqWZMl9Q.
It was almost like a bahn mi. Bread was yum and shortrib was tasty. I enjoyed it better when i put some of the coleslaw into the sammie. 

Lastly was some tasty sorbets for dessert http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=rWJOt4nICtNbUqEqtZaIIQ

We also added an order of the Cuban Panini. I wished we had ordered the tuna tacos instead. The panini i think would have tasted better with some bacon in it. hahaha. The bread was a little too heavy. HOWEVER the FRIES were amazing!!! I think they were twice fried in duck fat or something, cuz i seriously started to break out after i ate some. But it was yummy!

Pita House is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. They've got me craving it often but I don't feel bad because their food is every bit as healthy as it is delicious. Everything is made fresh and in house including their bread. There isn't a can opener on site and nothing is processed.

I'm in love with their tabouli salad (see photo). It's been absolutely perfect every time I've ordered it. The beef kabob skewers are also great with their famous garlic sauce. It's a must try! I've ordered their gyros and those are yummy too. They serve theirs on a pita and not that thicker flatbread like I've had at Greek restaurants. Possibly because their food is Lebanese and this is a different style. I have no complaints though. Just wanted to point out that it was uncommon to me. Regarding the rest of the menu, I haven't gotten too adventurous with that yet so I can't comment. However, this is one of those places where I am willing to bet that everything on the menu is good. Next thing I plan on trying is their hummus. I was with a friend that ordered that and it looked amazing!

Service is excellent and staff is all friendly. 

Random Quirky Fact - Apparently the cast of TLC's Sister Wives are fans too. You'll see their autographed promo card near the cash register. And all this time I assumed they lived in Utah...

SUNDAY NIGHT FUN

I swung on in here while walking back to my room. I couldn't resist because of the lively country music that was coming out of this lounge. Vegas is full of entertainers and the band on this stage did not disappoint. 

It was a country band and they were playing very lively tunes. It probably helped that there was a girls weekend birthday party and they were all sporting wigs. The main guy on guitar was flirting away with them even doing a funny version of happy birthday. He was really working the ladies. I didn't stick around long enough to see if he scored. 

The rest of the band consisted of a drummer who did some great vocals. Look out Phil Collins this guy can sing. A lady on piano who was very talented with amazing vocals. I did find it weird that she was playing piano with a pair of red gloves on. I'm not sure why but she didn't miss a note. I really loved the fiddle guy but the stage was so small he had to stand near a blackjack table. Yes there are three gambling tables inside this tiny little lounge. You can not get away from gaming at this casino. 

So if your looking for a place to see some live music then I highly recommend this place. You will be kicking back and throwing your boots in the air not realizing it is way past your bed time. Nobody really sleeps in Vegas! Do they?

One of the most intimate and unique dining experiences you will ever experience in Sin City!

Having tried most of the fine dining restaurants in Vegas, I thought i'd seen it all til i was pleasantly surprised with a shiny golden ticket in the mail!

When that fateful evening arrived on Saturday October 13th, I was like Charlie waiting in eager anticipation to finally visit Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.  Truth be told, I wasn't quite sure what was in store for me but i had a feeling it would be something good! 

In fact, as soon as we stepped into Jaleo, we were cordially seated at the bar and kindly given the drink menu for the evening on a handy iPad! Since I was feeling celebratory, i decided on the wine pairing with my meal and  as soon as our server found out it was my birthday, he gave us a glass of cava on the house! Now that's service IMO! 

After that, we were escorted to a dimly lit and intimate private room with a semicircular bar surrounded by wooden card catalogs housing Jose Andre's eclectic tchotchkes, which he apparently collected from his travels around the world.  At this time, the chef introduced himself and proceeded with a brief explanation of the evening's events.  Without a moment to spare, the chef and his skilled staff worked feverishly on the first dish. Liquid nitrogen began to billow over the counter and within moments, we were presented with beautiful bite size pieces of food art. About 20 or more dishes followed in succession, each skillfully crafted to engage and amaze!

I must admit, I arrived with high expectations, but the chef and staff at  definitely did not disappoint. It was a truly unforgettable experience that was filled with intrigue and spectacle. An intimate showcase inspired by traditional Spanish dishes, masterfully executed by the talented chef and staff.  is bar none one of the most interesting and enjoyable dining experiences I've ever had in Vegas! With that said, it's an experience you should make when visiting the city because like magic, it could soon disappear!

Happy Eats!

So you are lost in Sin City and you want some sinning and debauchery... what will you do? Go down to the pool and hit on every member of the opposite sex till someone goes yeah lets hook it up? Or is that too blunt in yo face and chit? If it's the latter, perhaps a trip to Sapphire may be in order since it is a "klassy" establishment... 

Well at least they want you to think that they are klassy... marble columns, a portico faade, travertine floors/wall panels, sculptures and large vases, and a podium with security flanking that want to cop a feel before you can move further into the establishment.

Pro Tip: Free ride over for larger parties in a limo or limo bus...

So once you get inside, then you run into problems. If your group goes in without having purchased "bottle service" well you are screwed. There is literally no where you can sit except for a few seats surrounding the stages which were mostly empty or filled with ugly girls when I was there. So lets think this through... you want to go see some dancers and there is nowhere to sit down unless you spend ridiculous amounts of cash on a bottle of liquor. Like 5-10 times the normal value for said bottle at an average liquor store. Talk about a racquet, you know I don't think they would make as much running prostitutes hahaha well unless you want to get a "private room" and I have no clue what those things would cost...

So once you realize you are screwed without bottle service and finally purchase it, the "damsels in distress" errr girls on who knows what come over and beg for drinks and to give you a "private" dance better known as a lap dance.  Well most of the girls that I saw here were just not my type. Some were downright scary... was it ugly girls night at the Sapphire? I have no clue but it was not the typical exotic dancer experience that I have had in the past. 

The best looking women there seemed to be the waitresses and they wouldn't talk to you hardly at all unless you were buying a bottle or three at the ridiculously inflated prices that they were demanding. Overall, my friend who was a bachelor had a blast while we were there, but when we were brought in and expected one thing and pulled the bait and credit card charge swap for an extra $800 really sucked for the rest of us. Ohhh and that was for 3 bottles and mixers haha *SMH*

Consequently I am not a fan of this joint and do not plan on returning here... So yeah don't say I didn't warn ya... bait and switched...

Come get some of this Mexican goodness! I just finished my taco and peppers and I already can't wait to eat more. 

Note to you anal, debit card carrying people. CASH ONLY. That's how we do here in Little Mexico.

Small tacos are $1.50. Grownup size tacos are $2.50. He also cooks chimichangas, taquitos and fish tacos which are not on the menu. My boss said the fish taco was lightly battered and seasoned to perfection. She even liked it better than a taco shop that rhymes with Poopios. I had the large Carne Asada Taco which was fresh and delicious and had no grizzle and included large slices of avocado. 

The star for me is the hot sauces and the grilled peppers. I tried both sauces: RED which had a smoky hint to it and also the GREEN which tasted clean and not metallic like some do. Now to the effin peppers. He seasoned them with Lemon Pepper and I didn't pay attention to what else and then grills them. They are huge, warm, sweet and full of heat and flavor. I just want to order ten of those bad boys!  What I did was take the guts out of my taco and stuffed them in the peppers. Buh damn!

Did I mention he has his liquor license and clean, little tables set outside and a boom box? Yeah, I think I am changing my name to Hi-me and growing a stache like a true Ranchero in honor of Chuy, Three Amigos and Machete.

So what do you call a place that serves decent Mexican food, outstanding chicken dishes with some Asian influence?  Well, they call it Chino Bandido's!

Now I'll admit, I get a charge and some amusement by watching Guy Fieri of Food Network visit these local DDD.  We have also visited quite a few of Guy's places over the years.  The yummy Guatemalan place in Santa Fe, NM is probably the best, while there's been quite a few near misses, too.  But Chino Bandido's.... well we somehow missed that episode.

So when I saw that sign, with Guy's gargantuan smiling face (see photo) I thought okay, what am I in for this evening?  Well not to worry. As it turned out it, it was all for the best, as the Four Star review might indicate. 

According to Food Network: "Chino Bandido's Chinese-Mexican-Jamaican dishes have garnered lifelong fans. Guy loved the fusion, calling it one of the most original on DDD. The best part? The menu has more than 90,000 combinations. For a spicy option try the Pollo Diablo, Jade Red Chicken and Jerk Fried Rice. Pow!"  Ugh, I could have done without that pow. LOL

The first thing that's tricks you as you enter, is the industrial, high ceilings and plastic 10 foot folding tables and chairs right out of Sam's Club, or Costco. The other thing you notice is the re, Chinese "Great Wall" muriel with a panda dressed as a Via Zapata style bandido. Some things don't translate I guess. LOL

I do not believe Chino Bandido's is Chinese at all. Well, not in the traditional sense. Heck, not in any sense really.  Yes, I see a Fried Rice, Egg Foo Yung, Chinese BBQ Pork, and Teriyaki Chicken on the menu.  But no Asian soups.  No General Tso's, no Orange Beef or Chicken, no Kung Pow, no buckwheat noodles, I could go on.

What I see is a very strong Jamaican influence.  That Panda could easily be a photo-shopped for Bob Marley because of all the Jerky Chicken and Jerky Rice. Sorry guys, or should I say Guy. LOL

But there were some hiccups along the way, but I really love this place. And two hundred or of my co-workers who seem to come each day cannot be all wrong. LOL

For me, just order the Jerky Chicken (photo) and you'll see what I mean. Delicious. Expect to pay $8 or so. 

Enjoy!

The four of us came for the Buffett Lunch today and the food was generally good. It was nice to finally meet, Rand H who organized and hosted the lunch, along with fellow Yelp'ers Robyn N and Arlin B.

We met around 11:00, as the place was just opening.  I've have taken several photos of the buffet area. Its on the left as you just come in, near the bar.  The selections were pretty wide, including two types of soup. Everything was hot, as you would imagine it should be.

Buffets can be a difficult business.  You have to constantly gauge which items are being consumed the most and prepare the kitchen accordingly. For the most part, I believe La Fonda got it right and stayed on top of things.

As for the food, it was somewhat basic. But as they say in Yelp-ese, it was A-OK. 

The Chicken and Steak Fajitas, the cooked Ground Beef, the Shredded Pork, Cheese  Enchiladas and Chili Rellenos were all good, though not memorable. Our table agreed the cooked chicken breast was the weakest and brought down most of our ratings.

The tab, with a soft drink ran $11.93 before tip, but including taxes.

I've had the chance to visit Hakkasan and XS this past weekend and let me tell you that XS completely blows it out of the water on almost every level.  Sure Hakkasan has exclusive contracts with deadmau5, tiesto, and calvin harris but XS' 2013 residency lineup is nothing to scoff at: Porter Robinson, Knife Party, Avicii, Steve Angello, Eric Prydz, Afrojack, etc.   But an amazing club experience from a consumer's standpoint is more than just who comes on the decks at 1:30AM.  

There are a plethora of factors, both tangible and intangible, that these new clubs neglect that ultimately leads me to the conclusion that XS remains the best club in Las Vegas over Hakkasan and Marquee.  Here are a few reasons:

1) Hakkasan should be renamed Hakkastairs due to the massive amount of stairs that you cannot avoid and you MUST take to even get into the main dance floor.  This is also a major problem with Marquee's presale line as you HAVE to walk up like 10 flights of stairs to get to the main dance floor.  Have fun with that in your 5 inch heels ladies.

2) No outdoor patio area?!?!  Is this real life?  No pool? What is this 2006?

3) No gambling section?!?  No water fountain??  No I don't want to pay 9 dollars for your bottle of water.  And give me the option to play blackjack and lose $1000 but at least I get a couple free drinks.

4) With XS and Marquee, when you have a presale ticket, you never have to wait more than 10-15 minutes.   Hakkasan's presale line took approximately 1 hour. 

5) No re-entry stamps at Hakkasan....seriously?  But what if its just me and a couple of my guy friends and we get there at 9:00PM just to get stamps with the intention of coming back at a more reasonable Vegas club time at 11:30ish?  

6) Hakkasan was such a letdown that my friends and I left before the headliner even came on.  Hakkasan is like a nicer marquee (inside only as there is no outside to hakkasan).  To Hakkasan's credit, they have a very spacious dance floor and their production value of their lights and lazers is unmatched but a club experience is more than that and XS beats Hakkasan down badly when it comes to every other relevant factor

7) I've heard that Hakkasan charges 43% on top of your table minimum... Now I see how they are paying abnormally above market prices for deadmau5, tiesto, and calvin harris.  This is absurd.

Unfortunately the hype for Hakkasan was too big since it was supposed to be the XS killer but just like Marquee, they both fall very short of the top tier in which XS stands alone.

Now we get to see Light take its shot on Memorial Weekend.

TLDR; Hakkasan was overhyped and I was very underwhelmed.  XS remains the best nightclub hands down for a variety of factors.

I think I had the #7 and the #41 add tofu. My friend John had the #8 and the #38 complete with fish balls....who knew...fish...had balls? Or was it the #6 and the #39. I don't know. I was distracted by the ambiance. Old tiled floors. Really funny, faux velvet art deco chairs and tables that could have used a little Windex. We were greeted immediately, sat, received water and then...well...waited and waited. I didn't want to be to rude but finally flagged someone down. 

You could tell this was a family run gig...dad type figure bussing tables, little kids running around with rice falling out of their mouths (seriously, it wasn't gross, but kinda sweet) and the big mama just kinda surveying the scene. Meanwhile the younger men ran the floor. Our order was finally taken and food was delivered swiftly. The spring rolls did not dissapoint....so fresh, so delicious...who needs a fried spring roll any more? The menu was so huge and intimidating I basically just pointed at something and blurted out the number. 

Taking the safe route was kind of boring I realize but the noodles were yummy, the veggies crisp and the tofu was amazing. I watched the other patrons (i.e. anybody that wasn't white) to see what they ordered. It was Pho all around. Next time it's Pho for Pho sure! 

Great experience. Would totally order a tray of those spring rolls for a party. And next time in addition to Pho I'll have Alexander C.'s fave Banh. He says it makes him horny you know!? Oh. The prices were unbelievably low! I could have paid the entire bill with change from the cracks of my sofa cushions.

Now that a week has gone by, I feel I can write this review and not become unhinged. My beloved cat Pepper, who was my constant companion for the last 2 years, spent last weekend at this Emergency Animal Clinic. Our regular vet told us to bring him here as it was the 24-hour animal hospital closest to our home. It turned out he had a very serious bladder stone condition, and come Monday, when we were able to see our regular vet, we made the heart-breaking decision that putting him down was the best thing to do. 

However, if the staff at this EAC had managed to give us all the information they had, we might have been able to save Pepper a lot of pain and misery sooner and maybe us hundreds if not thousands of dollars. First of all, this place is ghetto. Nothing about the appearance and upkeep inspires any confidence. Secondly, they have rotating doctors and technicians, so you are always talking to someone new. And everyone has a different opinion, and most of them were inconsistent with what our vet told us in the end. The reception area staff was unprofessional. The first girl we spoke to stammered over how to ask when Pepper had last urinated or defecated. Um... how about learning and using appropriate terminology? The person entering my information transposed 2 of the numbers of my cell phone number. No wonder they had to call my husband instead. I verbally corrected it with them over the phone, but when we went in later that day, they still had not changed it on Pepper's  paperwork, so we took out a pen and fixed it ourselves. They neglected to call us when Pepper's urethra blocked yet again within the first 12 hours. They neglected to call us when his temperature spiked again and he became agitated. They said they told my husband the results of his blood tests over the phone, but he does not recall hearing that information. They did let us come see him several times, and while we were waiting to be led back to the cages, we were regaled with loud and stupid personal conversations, that apparently the staff did not care that the rest of us in the waiting room could hear. It just pissed me off that we were all in life-and-death situations and they were all into their petty gossiping. Not that I expect a medical practice to be a somber graveyard, but appropriate conversation at an appropriate volume would simply show respect for the clientele. 

When I told my boss, a fellow cat lover and downtown resident, what happened, she said that she too had once taken a cat to this EAC in an emergency. It was having severe upper respiratory problems, and they were having some trouble getting it out of its carrier. So instead of getting my boss to see if she could coax it out, they tied a rope around its neck. Around the neck of a cat who couldn't breathe. She took the cat somewhere else immediately.

I will also never go here again in an emergency, and have since spoken to a number of people who have given me other options should I find myself in need of immediate after hours care. Our bill (which had to be pre-paid, mind you) was nearly $2000. Outrageous indeed.

Our first 10 seconds in this place set the tone for our meal there... We walked in and were told to go order from the bar. Went to the bar to order and were told we needed to be ID'd bc we were at the bar, even though we had no plans on drinking and were just there to order. It was 2pm. Huh? Kinda weird. 

But what the hell, since we were at the bar anyway and I saw Ayinger Bru Weisse on the menu (spelled incorrectly), I ordered a brew. What came out was Anchor Steam Christmas Ale. Not. Even. Close. I get that they both start with 'A', but a bartender should know the menu. Strike 1. We order our food and move to a table. The table we sit at is so off kilter that one elbow on it made my beer spill out and all over my phone. Strike 2. 

The buzzer goes off and we go pick up our food. My gf's salad looked decent, but had a spicy dressing on it that wasn't listed on the menu. Like a good boyfriend, I didn't trust her tastebuds and tried it myself. It 100% had a kick. She went to return it and didn't get a full tude, but def a nice 'wtf' stare from the chef. The salad was remade and brought out with a new dressing only it lacked the avocado that we paid extra for and the chicken was way undercooked. Strike 3. 

For my meal, a half Cubano and soup combo, the soup looked like something you would be served in an airplane... flying coach. Progresso in a square plastic bowl. Eek. Saving grace? The Cubano was good! Would a full one be worth $12? NO. It's not a large 'wich at all. $12 can get you a yard of meats at Capriotti's. Instead, I recieved canned soup and half a sammie for that same amount. Weak. Strike 4. 

I want to 2-star it bc it wasn't the worst place out there and it's certainly appealing to the eyes, but I know deep down that in no way will I be back. 'Methinks not' is spot on.

Great Casino Buffet Restaurant & FREAKIN LIONS

SITREP

Every time I pop into the MGM Grand Hotel, it's a fun casual experience.

THE SETUP

I love their dining buffets because they are quick & efficient.  Lunch runs $19.99.  Dinner runs $29.99.  (I never do both on the same day since I eat like it's my only meal of the day!)

LIONS! 

The LIONS in their large area are fun to watch interact with one another and the people.  They bring a LOT of spectators who are fascinated by being so close to observe them.  But part of me feels this is not kind to them.  So I am conflicted about this to be honest.  [Update:  see note at bottom of this review about the Lions new whereabouts]  :D

SHUTTLE PICK-UP

MGM Grand is also one of the major drop-off and get-on locations for catching shuttles back and forth from Mc Carran airport.  Great place to know.

THE LOWDOWN

My casual hotel run-in / grab a bite / run-out and hit the strip place.

ADDITIONAL UPDATE - Owner Response within 24 HRS

Here is one of two messages I just received in less than 24 hours from the MGM Owners Group.  You can't see this personal message below since it's in my Yelp inbox.  However, there is a 2nd message that shows up on the Business profile attached to my review (though these messages are not viewable from one's personal Yelp profile page).  A great response below to the Lion Issue.  Now that was unlooked for!  Message begins:

March 10, 2014

Social M.
Owner

Dear Michelangelo:

Thank you for expressing your concerns regarding the MGM Grand Lion Habitat.

Several years ago, MGM Grand and Mr. Evans established means to ensure that the lions will receive proper care for the rest of their lives.

The lion will remain an icon and logo forever associated with the MGM Grand brand.  We truly value your comments and patronage, and look forward to serving you again in the future.

Sincerely,

A good Pho restaurant in Vegas?! Can it be??

Yess!! 

It's about time that I write a review about this place. I live right down the street so you'll find me here for dinner if I'm too lazy to drive out or cook for myself. Their location is great for me, but for the masses they are at a huge disadvantage. They are located on the south side of town, 20 minutes or so away from Chinatown, which is where most people who seek out Vietnamese or any type of Asian food will go. They are also hidden in a complex where there storefront cannot be seen from the street.

When it comes to Vietnamese food, I am quite spoiled. I grew up on my grandma's homemade Pho, so most Pho restaurants in Vegas don't even compare. Pho Annie though...hits the spot! Satiates that craving. 

When I order a bowl of Pho, I like it to be perfect without me having to add any of the condiments available. Hoisin and sriracha should be a dipping sauce for the meat not to flavor the diluted bowl of broth that some places try to serve. Of course everyone has their preferences but regardless the foundation of the dish has to have substance to begin with. 

Their broth is perfectly balanced...very hearty and full of flavor (but not salty) unlike many other restaurants that will serve diluted broth or broth that tastes like MSG. The noodles aren't soggy or undercooked and the vegetables are fresh. Everything just comes together. 

Service could be better, but Vietnamese restaurants are notorious for awkward service. The servers do not look you in the eye when they are talking to you or taking your order. They most likely won't be checking up on you. HOWEVER...you will get your food within 5-10 minutes...which is nice. 

If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food, seek Pho Annie!!

Nearly two years later, I returned to Tao.

A few[1] young women and I had no problems getting past security. I didn't receive nor witness any undesirable behavior from the bouncers[2]. A local friend of mine got us passes so the $20/girl cover was waived[3].

What an event! I had just as much fun as last time. Figured it was going to be a laid-back Saturday night (for Vegas, anyway), but I was wrong; it was bat-shit crazy inside[4]. A friend of mine from LA had a table, and generously shared drinks with us[5].

Table service was excellent. Server Joe (unsure of his name), offered to check on a member of our party who looked a tad inebriated, all-the-while keeping our waters refilled. Later that evening, server Tiffany approached me, pointing to a couple snogging in the corner of our booth (and doing a wonderful job of it, I might add). I assured our server that they were with us - the girl was, anyway.

Note for you shutterbugs: unless you're photographing for Tao in an official capacity, "professional cameras" (read: DSLRs) aren't permitted. Leave them in your hotel room - or bribe management for a press pass[6]?

Tao is still a fun venue to get your freak on, and if you have yellow fever, there's always a load of Asians there.

[1] More than two, less than ten.
[2] I thanked several for not being douches. They were appreciative.

Thank heaven for Shirley B.!  I learned about Sheffield from her, and immediately planned to visit before the store closed today.  I zoomed over there at 6:40, with 20 minutes to spare.  I met the Sheffields who own this one and only shop.  Personally, I always felt Vegas was missing a Spice shop (well, and a tea shop after Two Sisters closed) and have been ordering my spices online from the Spice and Tea Exchange, which is a national chain that I discovered in Portland.  I order my tea from many places online so if you want to talk tea, that is another long discussion with me!

As for this place, it was exactly what I have been looking for - the Sheffields told me they get spices, salts, and sugars from the same distributor as S&T (though some of the rubs and other blends are different).  This store also has flavored and varietal olive oils.  Upon entering, I was offered a sample of strawberry green tea brewed and iced, which was refreshing.  There are many nice teas here, including matcha, genmaicha, and green jasmine.  The store carries several flavored teas as well.

There are tea accessories, saltkeepers, spice jars, bamboo cutting boards and other related items.  Over 200 spices are available here.  Because I have an enormous spice collection as it is and no extra room, I only got powdered lemon peel, roasted garlic chips, and Jamaican jerk blend tonight.  However, when I need something, I will definitely be back here instead of paying shipping online!  I did ask if the store has truffle salt, which it does not.  The Sheffields seem open to special orders if there is enough interest, so if I do run out I will ask for it, but for now I am truffly good.  I am really curious about the habanero sugar.  Who wants to try it first?

The typical New American seafood restaurant, with the prerequisite fresh raw bar and delicious, fish offerings sauced and dressed to turn the good into the sublime.  Solid.

So why Lakeside?  One word:  lobsters.

Lobster lovers, this might be one of the few opportunities to try four of the worlds best cold water varieties side by side.  Grab a friend.  This tasting is four mains, over four pounds, and a $450 price (don't gasp, you know you paid more for other "services" in Vegas)

Simply roasted in a wood burning oven and served with drawn butter.  Light smoke permeates the dense tail meat, enhancing its flavor while maintaining its juiciness.  Pronounced flavor differences make for a mind blowing tasting.  My notes:

1. Maine - Classic.  Clean flavor with a hint of celery.  Well balanced sweetness.  Firm texture.

2. West Australian - Incredibly sweet.  Citrus and cucumber back flavor.  Not as firm as the others but far from soft, pasty texture of warm water lobsters.

3. South Australian - A powerhouse.  Complex sweetness mixed with a subtle hint of fresh seaweed and iodine (Hawaii yeeps, think ogo).

4. South African - A blank canvas.  Enhanced by anything on it (ie herb citrus butter).  Firm texture.

Deserving of mention, the grilled octopus with white bean salad, sherry vinegar, and roasted garlic aioli starter is a party in your mouth with its charred bitterness on the octopus, sweet and sour of the vinegar, heat from the garlic and a creamy, richness from the aioli.  

The decor is modern and not for everyone.  Request an outdoor table.

Service is good with the only distraction from obnoxious diners taking calls on their mobiles.

Good wine list.  Resort prices.

Indulge.  It's Vegas!

Last minute decision to finally drive to Montreal brought me to Hotel10 - thank you hoteltonight app. (I mean it was either that or watch Honeymooners reruns all weekend - Montreal won).

The location is perfect - walking distance from old town and port, right next to St Laurent with all its restaurants and bars, and close to St Denis if you want to do some shopping.

Design is modern chic, which I always loved. 
Complimentary bath robe, oversized rain umbrella and huuuuge shower are big plus. Keurig coffeemaker in the room is cool too.
It also pretty quiet - polished concrete ceilings (darn kewl), carpeted floors, and covered walls - good soundproofing. I saw college kids with party supplies go to room next door and was prepared for much noise - did not hear a peep.

Garage parking is convenient, and I am tipping my hat to most awesome valet. 
Free wifi - good speed.
Huge gym room, clean, spotless, with fresh towels and ice cold water.

Breakfast is Ok-ish, I rather prefer eating elsewhere. 
However, Jargo lounge at night is pretty decent to grab a drink or dinner.

One word to management and my only disappointment - is how they maintain it. Carpets on ground level need cleaning, headboards need to be dusted, and hairdryer bags need to be cleaned. I don't enjoy finding other peoples hair there.

Bacchanalia, a festival of merriment and libations, a riotous tribute to Bacchus, the god of wine and ecstasy. Intoxicated revelry, drunken orgies...the Romans had it good.

Contemporary visitors to Caesar's Palace aren't so lucky. They must queue up before indulging at the Bacchanal Buffet by checking in at the self-service kiosks. A piece of parchment with a wait time will be dispensed. 

At 3 in the afternoon on a Sunday, our wait was CLVI minutes. That's fancy for 156 minutes, which is, in other words, 2 hours and 36 minutes. Within an hour and a half, however, they delivered a message that our turn was up, at which point we were allowed 15 minutes to come claim our spot.

The price for dinner was LVIII dollars and some change. You're better off not deciphering that. For those who put in the effort to understand it, you'll probably want to know, was it worth it?

If you just want to load up on typical buffet foods like crab legs and prime rib, you can be satisfied somewhere else and pay less. The draw of Bacchanal is their dishes, prepared with the attention you may find at a fine-dining restaurant.

Many of their selections come tapas-style, on a tiny plate or miniature pan that you take with you to your table. They even provide silicon finger tabs so you don't burn yourself as you grab. The seabass on wasabi mashed potatoes was outstanding as well as the shrimp on grits. 

As for seafood, crab legs were available hot or cold and cross-sectioned for easy extraction. Raw oysters were offered but only half-shucked, and they weren't that meaty. 

Dessert items were hit or miss, but the chocolate-filled beignets were exceptional, and the chocolate macarons were on par with the ones from a nice bakery.

Although the price and wait time may make the gods gasp in dismay and tumble out of Mt. Olympus, the quality preparations would satisfy the pickiest of the pantheon. The god of wine continues to inspire cult-ish gatherings, this time in the name of refined gluttony.

Roberto's is a greasy mess and I love it! There are only a few places I trust after a certain hour and Roberto's is one of them. Roberto's is open 24 hours. This location is attached to a Fabulous Freddy's and has a walk-up window for ordering. There is a patio with tables and chairs where you can grub if you are on a lunch break or just waiting on your car to be finished at Fabulous Freddy's or Jiffy Lube. 

I like a variety of things on Roberto's menu. Today I ordered a "Chicken Taco" since every Wednesday they are only 99 cents! These chicken tacos are greasy and delicious. The chicken is all white meat that has a nice flavor to it, and the cheese and lettuce are shredded fresh on site. The "Rolled Tacos" and "Carne Asada Fries" are worth trying too. The carne asada fries can easily be shared with others. My hubby ordered the "Carne Asada Burrito" priced at $4.90 which isn't bad, until you add on the 95 cents for each additional item such as cheese and sour cream. It can get pricey if you customize what you want, but it tastes better with all that other stuff! 


They also have combination plates that include rice and beans. If you like Menudo they serve it on Saturdays and Sundays.

It was late and I was doing some early Christmas shopping in west Chandler and I stumbled upon Zos Kitchen. I decided to run in and grab something. 

But when I got back to my office after my pickup, I was really impressed. I've heard so many good stories, so I wasn't sure if it was going to live up to the hype. 

For my first try, I went with their Steak Stack for $7.59 with a Hummus 5oz side for $0.79(see photos). The damage came to $9.06 including taxes, which seemed pretty good for everything. 

What I wasn't prepared for was the tastiness of their bread. Don't get me wrong, everything was really very good. In fact, if they had used any commercial bread, this still would be a Four Star review. But the flavor of their rosemary bread was incredible. I would have paid $9.06 for a loaf of it. It was delicious! 

So, go enjoy, Zos Kitchen!  I will definitely be back.

No!

I placed my initial order with BS and thats what it is BS! They entice you with a food credit or free delivery, but you have to purchase a minimum amount which is always $20 or more. I ended up choosing Southern Style Eatery for dinner and was excited to use this service. I ended up paying 18.22 out of pocket.

Delivery guy Ronald was a very nice guy who delivered quickly, one of my entrees was incorrect so I contacted BS and was issued a refund for that one entree... come to find out it was a credit to my BS account. 

Everything went well until tonight. I placed an order for pickup from Chili's, I used my credit and paid for the difference. I sat there watching the tracker for 10 mins then finally started vacuuming. During this time BS contacted me and left a voice mail advising me the pricing on the menu was incorrect and if I had questions or needed help to email them or live chat. I immediately went to my laptop only to see they charged my card an additional amount, yet I never authorized this! When I contacted them via live chat "Andrew" stated the menu prices were incorrect and that was the additional fee. I'm fine with the fees, but I'm not fine with being charged without being asked or told. THAT'S A HUGE MISTAKE! I asked to cancel the entire order and to please be refunded and Andrew stated he will credit my BS account... NO.... NOOO! Stop crediting my account, refund my GD debit card you liars! "Sure in 3-5 business days" of course.

Bite Squad claims they do not mark up their food, THIS IS A LIE. I noticed Southern Style Eateries menu and the po boy I ordered was only 6.49... not the 8.49 I paid. Same with the catfish, I paid 10.99 for 3 pcs catfish and chicken and it should've only been 9.00.

When I advised Andrew, he told me to email support@bitesquad.com with any "inquiries"

AVOID THIS SERVICE.

**Addendum** One of the co-founders Arash emailed me to offer a $50 credit if I deleted my negative review so they can have a "clean slate" When I advised I could update my review, Arash said he would like for me to delete it instead. After 6 emails later, he said he would give me the credit AFTER I updated my review... based on what? During this time he stated the reason why businesses hate Yelpers is because we are all irrational and that 95% of Yelpers don't even leave reviews (Where do they come from?). When I would not come to terms with him and told him he was harassing me, he stated that I will soon be on the other side of the coin and that karma is a b****... This is also an issue in Seattle... Had this issue been taken care of when I first brought it to their attention, this would be a different story. One piece of information that he gave me was that soon enough BS Vegas will have "over 4 star reviews" Funny how 2 of the 5 star reviews are from patrons living in Seattle... where BS is headquartered. This is all too shady for me. Delete your review for a credit? NAH.

For my 125th, 5 Star Review I wanted to share a gastropub located in the V.  I had heard a lot about this place, and I like gastropubs so I said I gotta check this place out.  We ordered a light meal consisting of: 

Bone marrow ($15) w/ bacon & onion marmalade; Grilled octopus ($16) w/ fried chickpeas, chorizo, saffron-romanesco sauce & arugula; and Duck confit poutine ($11) w/ cheese curds, gravy & egg ($2.50 extra).

The marrow was excellent.  It was completely edible vs some places where all the marrow does not come off the bone.  It was nicely seasoned and the marmalade and bread were also excellent too:  5 Stars.  The octopus was outstanding.  It was way better than recently reviewed Black Hogg in Silverlake (LA).  The octopus was super tender, and the fried chickpeas and chorizo added texture and contrast to the octopus:  5 Stars.  Lastly, the poutine was the star of the evening and the perfectly cooked egg put this dish over the top!  The dish was nice sized, the fries were still crispy, and there wasn't too much gravy (poured on at the table).  This version was way better compared to Animal in LA:  5+++ Stars.

To drink, we had the Joseph James lager ($8) and a Speakeasy ($10).  The former is like a Stella (my go to beer), but w/ more malt.  The latter is a Belgian style beer, but not as sweet as some:  5 Stars for both.

Nicholas was an awesome bartender!  Not only did he introduce us to some new beers, he was also very knowledgable about the menu.  Lastly, he poured a tequila shot down the finished bone marrow for one patron.  The patron said he really liked it!  - 5 Stars.

The ambiance was very nice.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed the view.  The clientele were chill, and there was a whimsical sign by the bathroom:  5 Stars.

I will definitely be back the next time I am in Vegas to try more dishes, or have the dishes we enjoyed on this trip.  I would prefer to come here vs the overrated Delmonicos.

Have you ever experienced that moment where you realize you're not half as cool as you think you are? Yeah... well Crescent Ballroom did that for me. 

The first and only time I've come here, was to play Bingo. That statement alone should be enough evidence to myself and anyone else who will listen that my days of coolness have passed. If they ever existed at all.

This place is pretty sweet. I had dinner before Bingo because grandpa (me) knew it might be a late night and I didn't want to eat after I left here. Doing something like that would lead to a night of indigestion and no sleep. Psssh... who needs that in their life. Am I right? 

I tried the carne asada quesadilla and it was unexpectedly good. I would eat here again without a doubt. 

The Bingo was played in the concert area. I'm not gonna lie... it was fun. The event was put on by Jackalope Ranch and emceed by the National Comedy Theater of Phoenix. They did a great job. Funny people. Especially this guy Marcus. Hilarious.
 
They were all about audience participation. Like it or not. I was actually glad I never won a hand of Bingo because then you had to go up on stage and try to match wits with a trained comedian. I don't need that in my life. I'm the kind of person who thinks of a comeback 3 days later. It was a lot of fun though. 

Crescent Ballroom seems like it would be an amazing live music venue. I checked the calendar and there was not one band that I knew. Oh, wait... except the Toadies. You know the "hipster" line, you wouldn't know who they are... Well they're right. I don't. 

Bottom line is that this place is cool. A solid 4. Hopefully one day a band I know will play here and I can bump it to a 5. Until then I'll live in happy acceptance that my days of coolness are behind me.

This was my first time in Terminal 3 since I was flying Virgin America to LA and I do have to say that it's pretty awesome because it's new, modern, open, and spacious. Checking in is a breeze if you must do so. All the airlines are all lined up with awesome LED screens indicating each airline's specific counter. 

The security now has two separate lines - one for regular screens and individuals who have TSA Pre-Check. The TSA Pre-Check line moved pretty quickly even if it looks pretty long. Just remember folks, put all your stuff in your bag and don't have any metal like belts, coin change, etc. on your or in your pockets. It'll make the line move much more quickly!

After getting through security, there are plenty of screen to inform you of you arriving and departing flights. The terminal is pretty big with huge windows that let in plenty of light. In true Vegas style, there are slot machines around every corner in case you have extra time before your flight.

There are plenty of food options such as Pei Wei, Burger King, Carl's Jr., and Coffee Bean. I think there are a couple more options, but I noticed these just from looking for food. They also had your basic stores in case you wanted some snacks, reading material, Las Vegas memorabilia, etc. The bathrooms are also modern and clean, which is always a plus.

The terminal is very accommodating to tech savvy folks. There is free wi-fi for your use and there's also a dedicated charging station. It would've been better if there were chargers are each seat, but that's just me being picky.

If I have to fly to Las Vegas again, going through Terminal 3 would be awesome. It has everything I need to literally make the time fly! You will not be disappointed!

Grassroots rates 3 1/2 stars for me but I'll round up with 4 stars for this review. They serve the beer ice cold which I love. I started off with the appetizer of the pulled pork sliders which were delicious. For the main course I had the sliced brisket with some funky side to it which was forgettable as far as I'm concerned. They don't give you enough BBQ Sauce so you have to ask for more. The brisket was just okay for me, and for what they were charging it should have tasted much better.

The service was decent. This place is a great alternative if you ever get stuck waiting in line at that hip pizza place across the way. I would definitely come back and try some other menu items. Just when I thought it was safe to carry the Discover Card I find out that this place doesn't accept it. I think the Discover Card was rolled out in the mid 1980's. Hey Grassroots, if you want to be that upscale and sophisticated go to restaurant and bar then you'll have to accept all major credit cards.

You know that episode of Seinfeld where George eats a pastrami sandwich while banging his girlfriend? Well, if he'd been eating Pizza A Metro, I'd totally understand. 

So. Fucking. Good.

My friend and I split the cheese ravioli in a creamy tomato sauce and a pizza with sausage, broccoli and mozzarella for lunch.

The ravioli were like little pillows of heaven filled with the silkiest melt-in-your-mouth ricotta I've ever tasted. The pizza had that chewy-crispy crust thing happening, and the tomato sauce was incredible - simple, fresh, still a little pulpy.

Everything was homemade. And when I say "everything," I mean they make their own MOZZARELLA, people. Yes, mozzarella. I know how to make a lot of stuff from scratch -- bread, pasta, pastry dough, whatever -- but cheese? I've got no fucking clue. 

Not only does Pizza A Metro have a clue, but they're so goddamned nice, too. Case in point: After chatting with the owner throughout our meal, he brought out a slice of the tiramisu. No fanfare, no warning. Just set it down and walked away. We practically licked the plate. 

Go there. You won't be disappointed. 

But if you see me ordering takeout, just pretend you don't know where I'm headed with it.

Wings or prime rib?  Those are probably the two most common choices at this 24 hour restaurant located at the casino level of the Hooters Casino Hotel. The prime rib special is $9.95 all day and you can order 25 cents hot wings with a minimum order of ten from midnight until 6 AM.  The restaurant used to be Dan Marino's and quotes and images of the former NFL Miami Dolphins star quarterback are still a big part of the restaurant's dcor.  Apparently, the recent name change to Mad Onion Fine Foods and Spirits occurred just before Thanksgiving 2009.  

From a distance both specials looked decent, but I made a middle-of-the-night mistake by ordering their half pound Classic Mad Onion Burger.  The unique thing about the Mad Onion burger is having your choice of onions put on your burger.  I chose "carmalized" onions among the list which also included raw onions, sauteed onions, BBQ onions and chipotle onions.  The burger comes with fries also.

At least the fries were hot in temperature because the burger was not.  The food took an excruciating amount of time to come out of the kitchen and when it finally did not only was the burger just warm but the carmalized onions were ice cold.  The half pound sirloin burger did not taste like fresh beef either.  It was a bit too ground up in texture and had a peculiar taste.  I think I made the right decision by tossing most of my food and making a run up to a 24 hour Wendy's at a nearby food court instead.

The Mad Onion staff were nice though, but this place is avoidable.

Surreal pool party experience. Vegas does it unlike anywhere else, and Wet Republic is no exception when it comes to getting WET!

So you know what you're getting into:

1) Getting tickets in advance substantially cuts down waiting time.
2) Arriving early (before 1pm) does the same.
3) Cabanas cost $1,500.
4) There are lockers available to stow your stuff.
5) The bar sells drinks in enormous lidded cups. Get these and you won't regret it when the splashing starts! Unless you like chlorine as part of your alcoholic mix.
6) It is calm and beautiful when you arrive early and hardly anyone is there. It gets increasingly more chaotic and cramped up through peak pool time (~3pm).

* * * Now, so you know what you're REALLY getting into: * * *

Be prepared for a poppin' party. And when I say poppin', I mean POPPIN'. Super crowded, off the chain, dope beats, crazy splashing. Beach balls are constantly flying, some that may come your way and bonk you on the head while you are distracted, completely unaware. Good thing they're only beach balls! Then the huge inflated whales start coming out. These are much heavier than the beach balls and have more of an impact on your head. But everyone is too busy dancing and having fun to care. NOTE: You can't ride the whales. You can try, but it's impossible.

By the time the headliner DJ (Steve Aoki) takes over, it becomes so rowdy both outside and inside the pool. Outside the pool, a large crowd is clamoring up by the DJ booth. Aoki sprays the crowd with champagne and even throws a large cake with white frosting at them. He is carried overhead by the crowd. Rafts and inflatable animals (flamingos, ducks, and monkeys) are deployed. It's a hot, hot mess on land!

In the pool there is so much splashing that tidal waves are straight up rolling. One guy was so ecstatic to be in the pool that as he thrashed around, he brought his hand down (with his phone) hard onto my forearm. Thanks for the enormous bruise! Of course I didn't feel it until the next morning, probably because of the booze and adrenaline. Before I know it, 4 hours have passed and the drinks and music are still flowing. Wet Republic sure knows how to make it last!

TIP: Be ready to party. Go hard or go home!

DATE TIP: You can most certainly find a date here. Enormous margaritas + dancing in the water + people in swimsuits? Oh yeah, no doubt.

"Pinay ako!" That's the Filipino/Tagalog phrase for "I'm a Filipina." When I saw this place had Hello Kitty stickers with "Pinay ako" on their wall, I had a feeling this was a good place. (Hehe, I tend to like places with Hello Kitty...who would have thought ;). 

Anyways my first instinct was right because Kusina ni Loraine is great! They have a buffet filled with lots of Filipino food! If you've never ever had Filipino food ever, this would be the place to try it out! They have traditional favorites like Filipino pork bbq, beef steak, kare kare (Filipino peanut butter stew), sisig (sour fried pork) and pancit (noodles). . They also have items you don't see often at a Filipino buffet like fried chicken skin, chicken curry, picadillo (ground beef with potatoes) and molo soup (dumpling soup with noodles).  It's a great selection of savory eats and tasty treats! I really liked that I got a little taste of all of my favorite Filipino food here! There's nothing like eating a fulfilling meal of white rice topped with kare kare sauce and pairing it with pork bbq sticks! Yum!

Aside from the savory offerings, Kusina ni Lorraine also has some desserts. They have a fruit bar with grapes, cantaloupes and honey dew. The day I went they also offered a yummy Filipino dessert via ginataang totong (coconut dessert with mung beans). The ginataang totong was sweet and very good. It is like eating rice pudding.

The buffet here is $7.99. You can pay another $1.50 for the soda.
They also offer other treats here for an extra price like turon (banana eggroll), 3 for $2 and Filipino ice cream popsicles and ice cream drumsticks, $1.50-$1.99 each. They also sell a variety of different chichirya or Filipino snacks via chips, crackers and other goodies! (Oh and  they sell non food items like the  cool Filipino stickers with the Hello Kitty I mentioned earlier ;) and Filipino clothing)

Kusina ni Lorraine is a great place to try different Filipino food! Whether you are looking to eat a traditional meal or a light snack, you can find it here! I have found my new place for Filipino food in Vegas! Pinay ako and I love good Filipino food!

I appreciate French food and like it more than I should. 

I also love NOLA and their Laissez les bons temps roulern!

But, the French Grocery is really not a grocery store at all. You cannot buy any grocery items, like you might find in a typical Champion or Carrefour. No Carte Noire coffee, no Maille moutardes, et cetera

They also do not cook, nor serve food here.  Everything is pre-made, wrapped for sale and kept in a refrigeration case. The only exception is the bakery items and a small chilled salad deli case. 

When we arrived on Friday just before five, there were also very few items left in the refrigerator. There was no croissants, no french bread or much of anything in the bakery case except for some small $1.75 cookies.

There were a couple of small individual Quiche Lorraines (which didn't contain any bacon or ham) and a few small baguette sandwiches, like you would find in Gare du Nord. 

The French Bakery also has a wine section, along with a few French press coffee pots. As others have noted, the lighting is poor and makes the store feel dreary. There are a few tables scattered in this cavernous store. But I am unsure what they are used for since you cannot sit and eat any of the chilled items. 

I believe the French Grocery is set up to appeal to working couples on the go --who want something more interesting than the Take Out selection of Fresh & Easy.  Of the six items we ordered, the best was the chocolate Pot de Creme for $3.50. Our total including tax came to $32.11

But if you come to the French Grocery thinking of Le Pain Quotidien, Le Madeleine, or even local Amuse Bouche (Surprise), you might leave disappointed.   Sorry!

Fry's is one of the Kroger brand stores and it is clearly their best.

Every so often, we will pick up a few bottles of wine and grab one of those ecological friendly bags.  I took the time recently and noticed that they have printed all the Kroger stores on it's side.  Clearly someone in Kroger HQ was thinking beyond their area.  Realizing, that having one bag for all their stores, would save money and promote brand awareness.  Well, it did.

Turkey Hill, Smith's, Ralph's, QFC, Fred Meyer, Payless, City Market and Fry's.  These are all of the Kroger stores we've been lucky to shop in over several relocations, and they're all very good individually.  Fry's and this store in particular, seems to be the best!  

In the short five years we've been in Arizona, this store has had several updates. The books and magazine area was updated four years ago and then again recently. Same thing for the convenience food.  Three times in five years.  Now, they have a wine tasting, sushi maker on hand, bar area -- which is always packed!  At least a dozen shoppers watching a flat screen TV, drinking wine and eating some personally made sushi and pot stickers.  WOW!

This would all be a sidebar, if their prices weren't competitive.  And how do I know their competitive?  Because mammoth Walmarts is now airing TV commercials against Fry's and saying theirs prices are lower.  Incredible!  Who ever heard of Walmarts airing commercial against one competitor!  One competitor. Think about it for a moment.  

As our YCM Lindsey F wrote fourteen months ago: "Holy grocery store! I don't even know if the term grocery store can be applied to this Fry's. Imagine Target, Costco, AJ's, Fry's, Walgreens and Whole Foods all piled into one overwhelming massive store."  Our family agrees and we haven't even mentioned their $0.10 off a gallon of gas/diesel tie-in with Circle K or Shell.  So, why shop anywhere else?

A shout-out to Jeff in Bakery, Donnie in Checkout and Gloria in Deli.  They are friendly, helpful and willing to go out of their way to get you whatever you want!  Did I mention their great customer service?

Okay, I'm a Fan!  And, this is: "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"  Five Stars.

I had a wonderful experience here. I needed a new pair of running shoes badly. I am in the process of getting back into it after taking way too much time off...... (like 3 years)  I know, pathedic. Sometimes liquor and sluts take precedence; don't judge.
Anyway, I decided to do this on my lunch break and I was out in about 45 minutes with the most comfortable running shoes I've ever owned. 

As stated in previous reviews, the staff is extremely friendly and they know their stuff. The structure of my feet were looked at as well as how I walk. I have never been fitted for running shoes before so it was kind of strange but I knew what to expect. I found out my calves are extremely tight and if I don't start streaching more/better, I'll end up with repetitive motion injuries.... good to know! 

I was presented with 3 different pairs of shoes to try out and in those found the perfect pair. I felt like an ass running around out front with the diferent shoes on in business attire but whatever... I found a great pair of runners so I'm happy. 

All in all it was an interesting experience. I will be back to pick up some more gear as soon as I feel truely committed again. Not once did I feel pressure to spend money or make a quick decision. As a matter of fact price was never even mentioned until I picked the shoes I wanted. Of course my feet have champagne taste so they chose the most expensive pair.

I cant believe its taken me this long to find this place! stumbled upon this sushi restaurant while out doing some errands today and what a hidden treasure! Usually sushi bars have a very boring decor and bland music but this place was playing Trance music.. that is awesome! with beautiful decor to the wall art and the exposed pipes it has a very stylish/modern feel to it. I almost felt like I was in San Francisco. 
I ordered the seaweed salad. It was a very generous portion but my only gripe was it was completely covered in sesame seeds which i am not a fan but know next time to request them to be left out. The seaweed itself was very fresh and the right amount of dressing was used.
Then i ordered the Hawaiian roll with soy paper. It had albacore, shrimp, and cucumber inside wrapped in a Cajun albacore and avocado tossed with some ponzu sauce... heaven. Seriously one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had and I consider myself a sushi connoisseur. 
The popcorn scallops are amazing as well. they're little scallops deep fried and served with a wasabi ranch and honey mustard sauce. 
I had the all you can eat which was only $25 and that even included 2 oysters! Amazing deal especially for the quality. Ive already been 3 times in the past 3 days and Ill probably end up here at least 3-4 times a week. LOVE LOVE LOVE!

Oh! and the sushi chefs are awesome. :)

Michelin Stars #20, 21, and 22

Let me start by answering your questions;

"No" and "No."

For my 30th birthday present, my wife treated me (us) to our first 3 star dining experience. My hopes were sky-high as we rode in our complimentary limo ride into the back of the MGM. We were escorted through the private baller area of the casino to the main entrance of the restaurant. Once inside, we were greeted with what might happen if you filled Barney the Dinosaur with gold and velvet and then blew him up, a purple pantheon of out-of-placeness. 

Of course, when having a once in a lifetime meal, you never order a la carte, you go all out with the 16 course degustation menu. Which leads me to some of my major gripes of the meal; the amuse was counted as a course, there were no intermezzos, apritifs and digestifs to break up the heavy French food, and the amazing cheese cart was not part of the tasting!

I lack the energy to describe each course in detail as I often do, but most of it was really really good. A couple were jaw droppingly good, yet others were only okay, and only okay for any place. For the price and the reputation, I expected so much more. I expected the foie gras to shed new light on the start of the universe and for the veloute to show me god, but no epiphanies were had that night. 

Service was spot on, never smothering or pretentious, and the wine guy guided us well. The pre-dinner bread and separate butter carts were equally amazing. 

For the money though, we both agreed that we would choose Urasawa, Spago, or Providence in a heartbeat for another meal. 

So now for your questions;
Was it worth it? NO
Would we go back? NO

PS - No good pictures because my old cybershot took a shit that day, so I bought a Sony Nex-3 and had no idea how to use it for dinner =[

This place is great. I can't believe I've never been here before. I've been severely missing out. Old Vegas charm meets unglamorous dive bar. Perfection. This place gets it. 

Liam (Door staff) is one of the most genuinely nicest guys in town. He proves that you don't have to be a douche to control the door. **Other bars take note!!
I was told it's the oldest bar in Vegas, but technically there's a bar that's been open (consecutively) longer. I haven't been to that bar either, so as far as I'm concerned this is the oldest. I love the old style memorabilia. Bathrooms are surprisingly clean. 
This place rocks! Drinks are cheap and delicious. I was a little hesitant to order a dirty martini in a such a distinct dive bar, but I couldn't stop my mouth from saying the words. Not to worry, because it came out perfect. Absolutely perfect. 

Everyone is extremely friendly. Our waitress was adorable and attentive. She told me her name, but of course I forgot.

Patio:  Unfortunately the view isn't that great.. right now you are just facing a dirt lot, but it's still spacious and nice to have the option.  

Pros: Bike rake. I'm new to biking, so I'm on the lookout for downtown bars with bike racks. 

I didn't see a liquor store section, but apparently you can buy some of the bottles from behind the bar.

Can an establishment have a classier name?

I'm not sure if I should be writing a review for this place, or a review for my awesome wife that actually let me bring her here. Every vacation we go on some excursion, whether it be cave diving, zip-lining, dune buggys, etc. well in Montreal they don't have a lot of these things to choose from, but what they do have a lot of is kink, so this became our Montreal adventure. 

It took a lot of wine beforehand to convince my wife to walk up the seedy stairwell to the second floor, but she eventually mustered the blood alcohol level to pull it off. When the door upstairs opened we were greeted by two girls wearing nothing but their bras, okay I'm thinking, this is already a good time!

So you pay a fee to get in which basically covers entry, a private room, a couple free beers, and your choice of dancer. I was surprised when the lady we chose told us her name was "Mercedes". I thought surely outside the US these girls could get more creative with their stripper names, but I guess that's a global stereotype.

All I will give away is that it was an experience neither of us will forget, and we left both satisfied and probably a little embarrassed. It was a lot of fun and the girl we chose was very nice and made the whole experience comfortable. The owner was also really cool so feel free to call ahead like we did if you have any questions.

If you are looking for an experience outside the repetitive mechanics of a strip club, or the limitations we have here in the states, then this is the place to go.

GREEN PACKING

I heard about this place but I had to go check it out myself. It is a short 2 block walk from the Fremont Street experience.  My only advice is to keep your eyes open in the back of your head. It is a short but seedy walk. 

Once you arrive you are greeted by a giant metal bug at the entrance. It is made of recycled stuff. The whole mall is made of those metal shipping containers you see on boats, trains & trucks. I thought that was an incredible way to recycle and go green. It also reminded me of my days of being a child when I stacked blocks. I can not confirm this but the architect might be 5 years old. 

I was really happy to see this place get packed at lunch time which means the tourists are coming down here. There are plenty of outdoor tables and many people were eating at the various restaurants located here. There is a great outdoor stage which has various musical acts. I would check the website for up coming bands. 

There is an old caboose which has been turned into a barber shop. Bring the kids because I am sure they have never seen one of these in real life. So it's like visiting a museum while shopping and eating. 

I highly recommend getting out of the casino area and walking here. You will enjoy relaxing in the sun without the pressures of Vegas beating down on you. Trust me when I say, you will be happy you did.

A burger in Vegas?  Not what you'd expect to dine on with sooooo many buffets and prime rib specials available within a 1 square mile radius.  The Burger Bar is conveniently located in the shopping wing, Mandalay Place at Mandalay Bay.  It's not really so much a bar...it reminds me more of like an upscale ice cream parlor.  The place is pretty spacious with counter seating and wood booths with granite tables. They offer a wide range of beers, both domestic and imported specialties, along with their version of the 'six dollar' burger.  The burgers are gourmet style, courtesy of Hubert Keller and are actually worth their inflated price.  They use some real top grade beef...Ridgefield Farms corn fed beef to Black Angus beef to American Kobe beef...they have something to satisfy the most discerning beef lover.  Not fond of beef, try their lamb, buffalo, chicken, or turkey burger.  For something more healthy, they also have salmon steaks and a veggie burger.  I tried the Ridgefield Farms American Classic burger, which came with bacon, lettuce, and a tomato slice.  The surprise on the menu, next to the $60 Rossini burger (Kobe beef laced with foie gras and truffles), are the many condiments that one can add to your burger...over 40 different choices.  I opted for the jalepenos and peppered jack cheese.  And here, when you ask for medium rare, it comes medium rare...it came out perfect.  Also a surprise, the service...excellent and attentive.  Worth the splurge...go have one!

Went there on opening weekend on Saturday.

1.  A billion stair-steps everywhere.  I had fun watching drunk girls trip and fall all over the place.  TROLOLOLOL, loads of laughter.  Someone is going to fall and die and they will get sued and eventually shut down.  You would think being built by Asians, this place would have better engineered walk-ways and lighted staircases, but NOPE.  Instead they hire a bouncer to hold a flashlight to shine each and every staircase.  Kids, this is why you go to college.

2.  Do we really need an Asian themed club?  AS IF THERE AREN"T ENOUGH ASIANS IN VEGAS CLUBS.  Yeah I said it, I'm Asian too, UMAD?  Can we have some diversity?  This way, we won't scare all the White girls and Hispanic girls, you know, the ones actually capable of flirting and talking to strangers instead of the circle jerk AZNs.

3.  No outside patio!!  Some times I just want to connect with a smart girl and stare at her big, beautiful eyes, and tell her my awesome stories instead of just getting bumped by Rotunda and have armpit sweat slapped on my face.  Can't beat XS' outdoor patio.

4.  They don't give out tap water!  The bottle water is 9$!  I didn't come here to drink and get stupid, I came here to flirt, and being the stingy Asian that I am, I think 9$ for water is a really bad deal.  My six pack requires a lot of babysitting and no thanks alcohol.  Asian girls: don't ask me to buy you a drink or if I have a table... especially those of you coming from LA.  It makes you sound really classless and ghetto.  You're not a princess and you're not entitled to free things.  Mommy spoiled you too much.

If you're a nerdy Asian guy who is tired of being BETA and put in the FRIEND ZONE by your rude bitchy Asian female friends and you want to be alpha, aesthetic, and learn how to pick up girls in Vegas or anywhere for that matter, hit me up.  Here is a video of me in Vegas.

A smooth club promoter named Emmanuel approached us in the mall and dangled free champagne before us.

Now...

I am a champagne lush. I don't like much else... unless it involves fruit, ice, and well...a sophisticated combination of Baileys, Guinness, and Jamison - but I am all over...yes all over - anything having to do with champagne.

So after watching the incredible Le Reve - we made our way over to Blush, with our VIP bands, to get our bubbly on.

I have to admit that I didn't have high expectations for the space, so Blush exceeded any and all pre-conceived notions I had. There was plenty of room to move, good music, the bartenders and cocktail waitresses were friendly (and hot...), the space itself was glamorous and sophisticated, and as soon as we found ourselves in the picturesque and daintily lit outside patio area, some nice folks smiled at us and quickly made room on their table.

It was our first night in Las Vegas, and with our fake eyelashes batting, our brown skin hues pressed up the white chairs, and our bubbling champagne in hand - we couldn't help but bask in the sexy outdoor glow of the night. 

For any girls looking for a low-key way to start the night, I couldn't recommend Blush more. Unfortunately for guys, they do charge a 30 dollar cover, which Blush, though chic and beautiful - is not worth.

Also, while you won't have to fight your way through a glazed eyed crowd, one could even remark and find fault with how mellow the crowd is/was. 

When we were there, people were evidently interested in conversing and mingling. Very few people, in fact no people were dancing, despite the quality music flowing through the lovely space. 

I personally loved the low-key vibe of Blush, but if you're looking for your destination Vegas night spot  full of of table top-dance moves - Blush may be too timid for your liking.

We came here recently, when a friend bought us a couples massage.  Our most recent visit brought back all my memories of this great Hyatt locale, just minutes from our front door. 

As I've previously noted, with some minor updating: "The rooms here are amazing, as are the guest services. Looking for Spa Day? Well this Hyatt is the place!  Looking for a beautiful sunset dinner by a fire pit?  No question, then you have to come here.  

If you are lucky to be a Diamond Club member, their Regency Club is one of the best in the world.  I would rank this Hyatt alongside Brenner's Park in Baden Baden; the Savoy or Jumeirah Carlton Tower in London for WOW factor. Simply outstanding!  Stay and enjoy the sunsets and Gondola ride after dinner!"

Our couples massage began with a relaxed, tranquil time outside in their shaded portico (photo), sipping cucumber and fruited mineral water, overlooking the Spa's private pool. 

After a few minutes, we were escorted to our room by two massage therapists to select our scented oils. The hour slipped by ever so slowly and was over before we realized it. Wow, they were very professional and made us feel renewed

But that wasn't the end of our visit. Again we returned to the portico and some quiet time by the pool. One of our friends who was also here for a Spa Day soon joined us. We enjoyed some delicious flavored teas for the rest of the afternoon and some good conversation. The shopping in the Hyatt, though small is excellent. 

As noted before, "...we have stayed at this Hyatt Regency many times when we lived elsewhere.  But now that we live in the valley, it has become a fun place to go for dinning (See: Alto Ristorante e Bar and SWB Southwest Bistro)."  

Come, eat, relax, stay, visit; you'll be glad you did!  Five Stars, simply the best!

Enjoy!!

This is where we met up to start our taco trek UYE and the best of our stops in my opinion. I was so impressed watching them making fresh flour tortillas right on the truck! Nice! The line was long at Sinaloa so I found that to be a good sign. Sinaloa offers a variety of tacos, burritos, mulitas, tortas and quesadillas. Here are some of the current prices:

*Tacos*
- Asada (beef), Al Pastor (marinated pork), Cabeza (head), Chorizo (pork beef) are $1.50 each 
- Lengua (tongue), Tripa ( intestines) are $2 each.  

*Burritos, Tortas and Quesadillas* 
- Regular $5
- Lengua $6.50
- Tripa $6.50

I decided to try a "Al Pastor Taco" and after ordering it took about 10 minutes for my taco. They make everything you order from scratch so it might take an extra minute, but it is worth it. The fresh tortilla is worth it alone! The pastor had great flavor. My hubby noticed the condiment bar (salsas, sliced cucumber, etc.) right next to where you order, but I didn't see it! I think there were too many people standing in front of it for me to notice. While I watched my hubby make a Mexican flag with sauce across his 2 tacos, I was glad to just have the cilantro/onion mix on my taco. The pastor had such good flavor that it really didn't need anything more then a good fresh tortilla wrapped around it. 

They have Coca-Cola in glass bottles (score!) and there is even a hot dog cart right next to the truck. I don't get the hot dog cart, but there were a decent amount of kids eating hot dogs so whatever works!

"Whoa, what?!  Pinball Hall of Fame?  Are you serious?!" I thought when I saw the listing. "This can't be real."  But it was, it was!  

As a very serious adult type person, I decided to tell one of the coolest kids in my life about this.  After watching about 3 videos of the place, he was absolutely jumping up and down.  This may be an 11 year old's biggest dream come true, and there is no entry fee, no catches or gimmicks, just a whole lotta pinball machines, game machines, candy machines, even a moustache machine for some reason!  

Every day I saw him from the day I showed him the videos on, he asked, "Can we go to the Pinball Hall of Fame TODAY?  I have $20 in quarters!!!"  Tonight, I finally gave in and we made the trek down Tropicana to this nondescript, illustrious wonder of a place.  Upon entry through the door, the place was truly a wonder to behold.  Four double-sided rows (or more!) of pinball games, a solid row of old school arcade games (the original Punch Out, Tetris, and Super Mario Bros - even Joust!), multiple quarter candy machines (Reece's Pieces, cashews, gumballs), and even the claw games you can never really win (but you sure do try!)

We played Indiana Jones pinball, The Simpsons pinball, Super Mario Bros pinball, Ripley's Believe It or Not pinball, Flintstones pinball, Stargate pinball, and on and on until we had spent about $30 or so.  Lots of the machines had 5 balls instead of just three and extra game deals if you purchased more than one game.  It was fun remembering that if you matched the numbers at the end of the game, you actually won another free game!  We loved the games with multiball and really dug the games that gave you your ball back when you lost it too quickly (happens a lot during pinball, but you usually lose the ball!) 

He found an old school basketball game that was kind of mechanical and cool and a neat shoot 'em up game where you hit moving targets.  We played the last one together for a while and he loved the fact that there were actually moving parts instead of just an electronic screen!  (Ahh, back in the day, right?)  

By some magic, we made it out with quarters left, big smiles and ran right into a boatload of traffic on the Strip - but, it was entirely worth it.  Highly recommended entertainment and a real blast from the past - especially for us 80's kids turned "very serious adult type people" who remember the good old days when whatever was wrong in your life, a roll full of quarters and a good arcade could make it all better.

The Better Half and I visited this place for the 1st time last week.  I am a huge fan!  Here's why:

- Easy access off of Harmon Ave, which is off the Strip.

- The property has two entrances on the Strip.  You can sit at a bar or slot machine and have an awesome view of the street level of the Strip.  I bet this will be a great spot on NYE!

- I love the design and decor of the property (see pics).  Chandeliers, various designs in different areas of the casino floor are very impressive.  The artwork here is great too and all over the place.....you have to see it for yourself!

- Jason the Jeweler (designer of the Lakers' 2010 Championship Ring) has a store here.

- Although we didn't eat here, the food options look great.  We want to come back and try Holsteins & STK.

- The employees are very friendly and have a great attitude.  I know they just opened and you should expect that, but believe me it's hard to find that attitude here in Vegas.

- Parking was easy.  The self-parking garage is underground and has the meters that show you how many spaces are available on each level, bonus.

- The bars & lounges here are very cool.  We had drinks at Bond and the Chandelier Lounge.  Both places were comfortable and provided great people watching seats.

Overall, we enjoyed the place and have a bunch of places we want to come back and try out.  I hope they make it in this economy.

Will I return?  Are you crazy?  Of course I will!

I give it to our waiter, Christian and the steaks!

The outside is a bit "ghetto".. But soon as you come in, it's almost like a renaissance, back in the old days, touch of vampire feel.
Similar to the Artisan Hotel on Sahara.

We sat at the bar first while waiting for the infamous happy hour at midnight! I only did like one cocktail that night and it happened to be my friend's, the Pimms Cup - which had ginger ale, cucumber and lime. I usually don't like cucumber drinks, but this is the drink to try there! The other cocktails I had just had a weird after taste to me and so just wasn't a fan.

Midnight hits, we're seated at the table and so we ordered our steaks and other desired items. I ordered the 18oz Ribeye Steak with side of the Garlicky Spinach. Grilled to perfection, tender, juicy and oh SOO delicious! You can def taste the quality in the steak! My side on the other hand was, as you expected, garlicky. I had asked for it to be a little less garlicky, but nonetheless still a good side.

The group ordered Penne, Chicken Wings, New York Steak, Kansas Bone In, sides and more drinks!

Christian definitely accommodated our every need and was very knowledgeable of the items/ drinks on the menu! He even topped off our night with a complimentary dessert, which I couldn't, unfortunately have.

Nothing beats great service and food!

The first time I had Mangiamo's was for lunch one day when my boss sent me over to grab two $5 pies.  Considering it's a small cozy shop, this place sure does pack a punch!  A great $10-something spent!

The crust of the pizza is perfect.  I was anticipating a typical greasy pie like their competitors across the way but was pleasantly surprised.  It was crisp to perfection on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside.  They go light-handed on the sauce which my boss didn't like but I found it to be perfect.  If the sauce is flavorful, you don't need to drench the dough, right?  The toppings are fresh, the spices used are great, and overall it's a solid place for a quick bite. 

After stopping in a few more times, I can say that the consistency of their quality and taste is on point.  It's delicious and makes the tummy and wallet happy!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 60/100

Pretty solid shopping mall in Vegas! One of the best ones I visited during my most recent trip. It's huge and actually feels like a real mall as opposed to some of the hotels who have a few shops (less than 20-30) and consist of stores that nobody would ever be interested in actually shopping at.

At the front of the mall, there's a smaller area that consists of several floors with an awesome winding escalator. On the second (or third? I can't remember), it leads further back into a whole other section of the mall...which goes on for forever! So many stores! They range from normal/average, to high end and luxury brands. There are also lots of restaurants and cafes located in the mall.

The one reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because I felt like I was getting kind of confused as to the layout of the mall. It's weird how there's the small-ish entryway area (reminds me of the big mall in San Francisco), and then on one floor it kinda just continues further and farther away from everything else. Also, the mall map directory was kind of confusing and I wasn't sure what direction to walk in.

I would say this mall is comparable to the Venetian's, except slightly different architecture! Both very European.

I stopped in for lunch to check out this new pizza place. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta used to be here. I recognized the girl at the register when I walked in, so I asked her if they just changed the name, but she said that Mark Rich's recipes transferred over when the new owners bought the business in this location. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta still currently operates another location, using the same recipes and ingredients, but has nothing at all to do with Giani's NY Pizza and Pasta.

I ordered the lunch special for $5.95 which was 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The pizza slices were a good size. I didn't care for the pizza though. They might be using the same recipe the previous owner used, but it doesn't mean it comes out the same and it just didn't for me. The pizza was somewhat burnt and had a stale taste to it like maybe it was from the day before. This is a real disappointment for me because I regularly shop in the shopping center Giani's is in and enjoyed stopping for pizza. Good thing "Above the Crust" is just around the corner though on Ann Rd so there still is a solid pizza joint in the neighborhood I can go to.

My only dissappointment (actually there is one more and it has to do with cold balls...proceed with caution) with the Herberger was I thought it was called the Hamburger Theatre and was looking forward to a meaty snack. But alas. It is the Herberger. Not the Himberger. Or the Itsmyberger. The Herberger. Rickie was an "esteemed and prestigious" judge at the Miss Black Arizona Pagaent. A pagaent, mind you, that lasted SIX hours. So I was a frequent customer at the bar. And the restroom. So I can attest to good bar service. One time as I grabbed a cookie from the bar, he politely told me they were $1.50. Oops. Color me red. I had started out in the VIP lounge where everything was complimentery. Including the ice cold meatballs. But I digress. The restrooms. Clean. Really, really clean. The box office staff was friendly and helped find the right person who had my ticket. Rickie had already been seated. You know, as the "esteemed and prestigious judge". I was basically road kill at this point. Finally got my balcony seat and had a great view of the pagaent and could see Rickie writing and watch him texting me. Now back to the VIP Lounge. No bar set up. Which equals no adult beverages. Kinda sucked. And the food was COLD. I met the craziest pagaent moms. One lady, in fun, even told me to "talk to the hand". I kid you not. Oh. Parking you ask?  Across the street. I think we spent five bucks. I would most definitely return to the Herberger. I will remember to bring my own cookies and to ask how long the show will be. The art scattered about was enjoyable and the theatre itself was quite beautiful. Hopefully sometime soon the Pet Shop Boys will perform here. That's all I have...

I wish I could rate this place with 0 stars. 

Came here to see Hardwell and W&W for EDC week. My host put me under a guestlist and said to come by 10 because we had a group of guys. The rate they told us was $75 for males and 0 cover charge for the ladies. We got there before 10, and asked the guys with the suits with the mini ipads about the rates and they had said the same. fast foward 2 hours and we finally reach the front of the line to only be told  guys were $170 and ladies were $66. 

....are you serious? We could've just bought tickets, but the host personally said that he would put us on guest list and we would be able to get in with no problem. 

Anyways, we were trying to make a decision to pay the fee or not, another guy in a suit with the ipad in his hand shoved us out of the line yelling, "step off the line if you're not paying". Uh, hello. You clearly see us discussing if we want to pay or not. Not even a half second later, the same guy grabbed me and threw me off the line telling us off. Where is the professionalism? TRAIN YOUR STAFF PLEASE.

After what I went through with the staff,  I don't think I will ever come here again.

Las Vegas residents should feel privileged that in our town we have the very best Ramen-Yas in America. I grew up in the largest Japanese Districts of Los Angeles county where the so called "best ramen" comes from. Nothing in Little Osaka or Little Tokyo can compare to the Ramen we got here in Las Vegas. Back in LA, all we had were Hakata Ramen-Yas. There were literally a thousand of them. We had two Tokyo Ramen-Yas(Koraku and Chin-Ma-Ya), and one gigantically overrated Sapporo Ramen-Ya named Santouka. Here in LV, we don't got a Santouka but we got something that is a million times better, RAMEN SORA! 

We all know by now that the 3 Major Ramen Variations are: Sapporo(MISO), Hakata(TONKOTSU), and Tokyo(SHOYU). Here in Vegas our Ramen scene does not follow that generic formula. The scene is dominated by an extremely rare Osaka Ramen-Ya(Fukumimi), and a unique Kyushu variation from Kurume(Monta). The only traditional Ramen-Ya we have is a Sapporo one, which of course is SORA RAMEN. For decades, SORA has been a very popular ramen-ya in Japan. Yoshi-San, who owns and operates many of the better Japanese restaurants in town, decided to make a deal with the owners of the original SORA and acquire the rights to the secret recipe. Thanks to the great Yoshi-San, the most popular Miso Ramen recipe has finally come to America. And to make things better, it came to Las Vegas! Thank again Yoshi.

I wanna give credit to Ian, for always providing excellent service to us. Ian has incredible ramen knowledge.. maybe even more than me. 

For the longest time, SORA was the only Ramen-Ya in Las Vegas that served Shio Ramen(recently Koraku came to town). But, nobody cared because the only people who eat Shio ramen are geriatric Japanese people who bitch about how Miso isn't supposed to be in ramen(My Dad). But, in all seriousness, there is actually a reason why many Sapporo/Hokkaido Ramen-Yas serve Shio. A while ago I was talking with a local Japanese hero at Sushi on Rainbow, who told me that there is a port city in Hokkaido that is world famous for their unique version of Shio ramen. And today many Sapporo Ramen-Yas will present a "knock-off" version of this unique recipe. We always assume Hokkaido Ramen is Miso, but I guess that's not entirely true.  So don't feel embarrassed to order Shio at a Miso ramen restaurant, you are still being true to protocol. 

Curley noodles! Miso Ramen is supposed to have curly and thick noodles. SORA is the only ramen-ya I have been to that gets this right. Santouka has straight noodles even though they claim they are Sapporo. Monta, recently decided to get their act together and began serving "curly" noodles with their miso. I appreciate their attempt to be more authentic to the Sapporo style, but Monta's noodles are way to thin for Miso. 

The Killer Spicy Miso Ramen is what I usually get here. Out of the 10 times I have ordered it, there were 2 times when I couldn't finish it. When you order this, you need a lot of water refills and extra napkins. The spices make you sweat profusely. When Ian is working, he will remember that you are taking on the Killer Spicy challenge and will come around often to refill your water. The other servers unfortunately don't, making the experience more difficult. 

People in Los Angeles think they know what good or "authentic" Miso Ramen is. In reality, they have no clue. We here in Las Vegas have the very best Miso Ramen-Ya in America. In the past, all the big name restaurants in Japan decided to open up their American locations in LA, so it was really awesome to finally get one here in Las Vegas for a change. We got lucky this time... and yeah, f*ck you Los Angeles!

Woof woof, *pant*, *pant*, *pant*, woof woof  (I'll get back to this).

Keeping it real, this is an eatery created by a marketing group for a TV personality rather than a chef driven restaurant.  Words like fresh, farm raised, organic are replaced by outta bounds, awesome, righteous,  slam dunk, mack daddy.  The flavors are very bold, bordering on over the top.  Most components of a dish compete rather than compliment.    Not a big deal if you spent the evening smoking a couple of cigars or killed your pallet on a packs of cigs.

For "shareable",  respectable "sashimi won-taco" (fried won ton skin shaped like a taco shell filled with ahi mixed with a mango jicama salsa and topped with an odd sweetened soy and a wasabi aioli).  Passable but the aioli adds a flabbiness to the dish and obscures the flavor of the fish.  The "fondue dippers" are bizarre.  Breadsticks are wrapped in pepperoni then self dipped into a fondue of  oil stabilized provolone, sausage, and tomato.  Fans of a greasy pizza will be right at home.

On to the sandwiches and burgers:

"Come Rod.  Come here boy.  Sit.  Awww that's a good boy.  Now shake hands.  Awww Rod's a good doggie".

Contrary to what my ex might say, I'm not a dog.  I don't expect my meal to be tossed on a plank, burger falling over, only half on the bun, toppings and sauce spilling everywhere and fries thrown on for good measure.

A "big dipper" features tender slices of prime rib, smothered by melting pepper jack cheese, topped by over seasoned deep fried onions in a garlic spread with excessive, bitter horseradish.  Impossible to pick up, grease and oil mask the flavor of the beef.  The "off-da-hook smash burger" sports a decent mix of beef but obliterated by the cloyingly sweet, excessive bourbon bbq sauce.  They claim the bun is brioche, honestly the sauce kills the taste buds.  Finally the "mac-n-cheese bacon burger"  Cloying, greasy, way over the top.  The overstuffed burger is impossible to pickup and messy to eat.  A side of flavorful but soggy fries accompanies all selections.

Props for service.  Fast and attentive.  

Great for the Vegas tourist looking for the show.  Locals and regulars look elsewhere.

"Where should we go now?"

"I think Drift is nearby...have you guys ever been there?"

"No...where is it?

"Let me look it up on my phone....it says its less than a mile away..."

***5 minutes later...***

"Um, where are we?  This looks pretty residential....are you sure this place exists?"

"The GPS says to make a left, let's just keep walking..."

"Are those....are those Tiki Torches?"

"They are!  Thank you technology!" 

If you didn't know where it was, there is no way you would know it existed.  

I stopped in with Bonnie G, Erica O., and the Poop Guy after SMoCA and I really enjoyed myself.  We had a great little booth in the corner, ordered some very strong and interesting drinks that came in fun glasses, ate some yummy vegetable spring rolls, watched a drunk douchebag hit on the hostess (she's the hostess, she can't get away!), and talked about our television habits when we were 11.  The makings of a good night indeed.

The kitsch factor is high, which is good because I love me some kitsch.  Dare I say, its also surprisingly almost authentic touristy Hawaiian.   Our waitress was friendly and checked on us often and the food came out super quick.  I didn't think that the DJ was that intrusive.  It was good people watching (not as good as other places in Scottsdale) yet surprisingly laid back.  

I will say that they really should add Don Q to their "Exotic Rums" list.  That would have garnered them a 5 star review from me for sure.

Finally... a buffet where Quantity = Quality. Of course, it is still a buffet, so, don't come expecting this to be a 5-star dining experience or some romantic dinner for two. The Buffet at Wynn Las Vegas is a 5-star buffet experience ... with buffet being the key word.

We came for dinner and left about 2 1/2 hours later. I'm sure our waitress thought we were pigs. I know we felt like pigs ... and didn't really care because we loved the food so much.

 - Fresh-prepared food like a Pasta counter, Salad station, and custom Crepes 
 - Mounds of Crab Legs and Shrimp
 - Lamb, Prime Rib, & Game Hen
 - Try to get a table in the well-lit courtyard. It's a nicer atmosphere.
 - Gelato, Candied Apples, Profiteroles, and Chocolate-covered Marshmallows
 - Cheeses and Charcuterie
 - Dim Sum dumplings (so-so) and other Asian dishes
 - More, more, and more.

It may sound like every other buffet and while it is, it also isn't. The little things are nicer. The food is better. The buffet is better.

The food here is a solid 3 stars, but the consistently amazing service is enough to bump it up to 4.

This is NOT an authentic Mexican restaurant, it caters to the middle aged American palate. That being said, they do a great job with that. All of the usual suspects like combo plates with burritos, tacos, tostadas, tamales etc.. But also some dishes with nopales (cactus) and calabaza (pumpkin) to make some feel like maybe they're eating adventurously.

What stands out the most here is that they are all about the freebies, and I think that's really what draws the crowd here. Heaping baskets of chips with endless bean dip and salsa. Fideo soup to start every meal (they even asked me if I wanted more) and they gave me a side of vegetables with my dinner for free. They also have free grilled onions and jalapeos. They ALSO honored some happy hour prices for some patrons at the table next to me even though happy hour was over to which those people exclaimed "now that's service!" No.. It's not.. You're just jerks, and they're just really nice. A server who couldn't honor happy hour prices when it's been over for an hour isn't a bad server.

The fajitas are their claim to fame here, and while they are impressive upon delivery, I found them to be quite bland. The tall flame is a gimmick, but I think it's fun anyway. All of the food is solid.. But the check backs, friendly chatter, anticipation of your needs and presence of the servers without being overbearing is really impressive. Just don't come expecting something that your abuela used to make for you.

Any visit to Las Vegas would not be complete without a trip to Honolulu Cookie Company especially if you're a bit of a Cookie Monster.

Located inside the Venetian it may take some time to find but once it is a plethora of delicious little Cookies await in flavors like Pineapple Macadamia, White Chocolate Coconut, Lilikoi Mango and Chocolate Chip Macadamia. Now that Fall is upon us some new flavors have made it's way into store's - Ginger Spice and White Chocolate Ginger Spice. 
The store is small and well laid out with lot's of assorted boxes or you can create your own box, 5 Cookies for $4.95 or 10 for $8.95. They also had some large containers that hold maybe 20-25 but I did not see any pricing for those.
The staff are very welcoming and encouraged us to sample as many of the flavors as wanted until we had come to a decision which ones to get, the sample station is located near the door with jar's of little Cookie pieces you can help yourself to.

As for the Cookies themselves.. Yum! I'm a it of a snob when it comes to Shortbread being that I am British with a Northern background (where Shortbread originated) so trust me when I say these are really good! They're baked and imported from Honolulu which explains the slightly hefty price tag but they are worth it.

*TIP*
 Get a "Aloha Card" and receive a stamp for every $5 spent, 20 stamps gets you free Cookies! Also sign up for the ''Pineapple ERewards'' where you will get special offers throughout the year including one for your Birthday.

Virtual applause to you Portillo's for handling the masses so efficiently and smoothly! Word spread like wildfire when Portillo's announced that they were coming to Scottsdale. For months, Valley residents from all around waited anxiously for the doors to open. Just recently, Portillo's doors finally opened. Were they ready for the crowds? Yes they most definitely were! 

I've been to Portillo's in Illinois so I knew what I was in for. This Portillo's lives up to its roots. The exterior is bright and welcoming with tables all around. The drive-thru resembles that of an In & Out (in the ordering sense) and the interior reminds me of a 1950's booming diner. Everything is friendly and welcoming about Portillo's, including the staff. I heard that they brought in around 80 Chicago staffers to manage the launch of the Scottsdale opening which was very smart on their part. We visited tonight and although the line was wrapped around the restaurant, we ordered our food and got it within 15 minutes. What's their secret? Complete organization. While we were waiting in line, someone came up and took our order so that by the time we got to the register, all we had to do was hand them our ticket and pay. After that, we got a number and waited for them to call it. Within 5-7 minutes, they called our number and we were ready to feast! 

The food here is really as tasty as people say it is. It's all about the beef, the Italian beef that is. The beef is juicy, tender and flavorful and sits within a soft roll. The fries are delicious and the Chicago dogs are as good as any. I have yet to try the Chopped Salad or the milkshakes but I hear both are extraordinary so I will be ordering them next time. 

All I can say is, believe the hype and pay a visit to Portillo's. It doesn't matter if you've been to one in Illinois or not. Now we have one in Scottsdale and Shea an the 101 is a better place because of it! Welcome to the Valley, Portillo's.

If I could give negative stars, I would.  

THEhotel at Mandalay Bay was supposed to be the site of my wedding on 11/11/11.  2 months before the day, the O Suite (2000sqft penthouse) was booked and paid for in full.  A week before the day, I called to confirm.  The day before, I called to confirm.
  
The day of, 8 hours before the wedding, they had given the suite (as well as all other penthouse suites) to Manny Pacquiao and his entourage.  He was fighting the next night.  He had been set to fight 2 months prior when the room was booked.  He had been set to fight the week before when I called to confirm.  He had been set to fight the day before when I called to confirm.  THEhotel knew all along that this would happen, yet took my money anyway, and let me book the suite for my wedding day. 

My now husband was the one to get the news at check-in, then come tell me (thus ruining the whole not-seeing-eachother-on-the-day-of-thing) w/ tears in his eyes knowing how heartbroken/stressed/upset I would be. I cried.  ALL day.  This was a destination wedding, we had people coming from across the country and other countries in general.  Now we had a skimpy 800sqft suite (which they kicked someone else out of, I'm sure) to hold a 35 person wedding ceremony & reception in?  Luckily, our great friends searched the city for what turned out to be an even better penthouse suite at the Trump Tower 4 hours before the wedding was to start (go there!).

THEhotel only offered that other suite and another basic room to us, that's it.  There was NEVER an apology, just simply a, "we understand your frustration."  What they did was illegal, breach of contract.  There is a totally a small claims case there.  Finally, after PULLING TEETH we received our money back as well as a $400 comp to use at the hotel/Mandalay Bay (which we used to take all remaining guests in town out to lunch & I got a much needed 80min massage at their spa). 

While it all ended up working out and for the better (go to Trump Tower!), needless to say, I will NEVER stay here or give THEhotel/Mandalay Bay my business EVER again.

Four words:  Maine Lobster Pot Pie.

A puff pastry lid tops a "pot" filled with medallions of gently poached in what can only be called an enriched, buttery lobster bisque, uber sweet, Maine lobster tail and delicate claws.  Aromatic root veg and mushrooms balance the hearty dish.  Sensory overload as the dish is plated table side.  

Yes, you can get the same dish at Mina's flagship restaurant but here, it's comfort food, served in a less imposing, contemporary dining room.  American Fish is about outstanding seafood cooked in a simplified, almost rustic manner and it's good.

Standout starters include a refreshing, well balanced ahi tartare.  The natural flavor and richness of the fish is brought out by the tempered use of chili oil and fresh habanero peppers.  Pine nuts add an earthy balance.  Asian pears tone down the fiery spice and provide great texture.  The Seared scallop with Foie remains a winner.  The accents on the dish change with the season but always serve to contrast the sweetness of the perfectly seared scallop to the richness of the foie.

For other mains, the Mustard Marinated Black Cod is a top pick.  Asian influenced (think miso fish); moist, perfectly cooked through.  Simply put, good eats.  Finally, any of the wood grilled seafood on offer are excellent.  All perfectly cooked with no albumin visible.  The gentle smoke flavor adds a bitterness and complexity to the simply prepared fish that will have you longing for another bite.  Note, the wood grilled seafood is served without any sides.  The broccolini with lemon and garlic, complimented well with just the right vegetal goodness and acidic zing to bring the fish to life. 

Very good, relaxed service.  Outstanding wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.  Good happy hour.

Sometimes simple is best.  American Fish delivers.

My husband and I have been here several times already and like this place. We have always been greeted promptly at the door & seated quickly. We have had Kaitlin several times as our server and has always been on top of things. 
The food has been pretty good too! This last time we ordered and shared a house salad, the blackened chicken quesadilla and the venison chili burger. The favorites for me were the fresh & crisp house salad and the quesadilla. The venison burger was good but I wasn't a fan of the chili on top of it. 
In the past we've had the meaty wings, the Philly cheesesteak, Poblano Chicken as entrees. We've also had a large group here where we passed appetizers. The fried pickles, pork sliders & mozzarella sticks were all a big hit.  
One of these times I'm going to get Mom's Pot Roast. The smell alone makes your mouth water. 
As far as beverages, you can go wrong with a frozen mug of beer. My personal favorite is the Knotty Brunette. A great amber beer which you can get lady or man size. 
Being this location has had the hardest time keeping occupants I'm glad to see something here that will stay for quite some time.

After our first decadent evening in Vegas, the first thing on our minds was getting hydrated and nourished ASAP. Our party of four was staying at Paris so it was a no brainer that we'd pay the much praised Mon Ami Gabi a visit for a quick brekkie.

At 9:30am there was hardly any wait and we all were seated in the glass atrium overlooking the busy strip and Bellagio fountains. With coffee and o2 in hand, we were off to a great start!

Our server was congenial, efficient and helpful with the menu, as well.  

We went with the famous Croque Madame, traditional eggs and sausage with crispy hash browns, large mixed berry crepe, and corned beef hash & poached eggs, respectively.  

There was a bit of a wait but nothing too bad and the food was definitely worth the wait! Everything was fresh, nicely plated and the portions were very generous.

Our coffees were always topped off and waters constantly filled without asking, which was nice. 

Overall, a fantastic breakfast stop at Mon Ami Gabi. The food was solid, service was on point and the price was very reasonable for the location. 

Next stop, sippin on margaritas in our  poolside cabana :)

Happy Eats!

Lessaiz Les Bon Temps Rouler in Viva Las Vegas,

Came here for dinner with the BFF's to celebrate all of our belated birthday's. I've actually dined at several of Emeril's establishment and have been here twice before.  Each time I enjoyed a very good meal here.  

We started off with drinks and shared 2 different salads which were very good.

Pork chop was my entree http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=vyhbO6tDYlzAyZbCygzTkw#LC_f_i6ryK2FE9A0o1iX_A  This sounded really good and it was very good.   A nice double cut pork chop atop a very creamy and flavorful mashed potato. The sauce that accompanied the chops was perfect I wanted more of it.  It was a pretty big piece of pork chop.

Banana cream pie http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=vyhbO6tDYlzAyZbCygzTkw#JmSeIq-NF3TojwbkY71V9A  For dessert it is a must for me to get the Banana cream pie.  I first had it at Delmonico's in New Orleans and ever since the first bite many many years ago, if its on the menu at any Emerils resto I'm ordering it.  As you can see it not just all custard but it has slices of fresh banana's and the custard is firmer.  Its just tasty bite after bite!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/emerils-new-orleans-fish-house-las-vegas?select=vyhbO6tDYlzAyZbCygzTkw#4j2ZIrDR8_5Jkwid9ahUqA

Eyes ~ Lots of happy diners!
Nose ~ I smell something yummy.
Ear ~ Plenty of chatter but not too loud 
Mouth ~ Pork chops and Banana cream pie goodness!.
Tummy ~ So very stuffed!

This is a nice new watering hole for the area, which serves some Mexican inspired pub grub. 

We came for Happy Hour around 5 on a Saturday afternoon. Granted, it was probably unfair of us to come here after last week's foodie extravagance at Gallo Bianco in Phoenix.  But we found the food good and the drinks cold, always a plus. 

The atmosphere is a cross between a sports bar and a Mexican beach cantina. They have a large bar area which extends out onto the sidewalk. You can sit on bar stools outside, on a ceramic window area and still see the game on their two HDTVs inside. 

Salt and Lime is a bar where Dos Equis Lager, Corona Light or Modelo Dark are on tap for $4.00 and come in a pint glass, while their small wine list was $7 a glass. Salt & Lime doesn't carry or serve Sangria. They also had several margaritas on the menu starting at $6 and going up from there. 

The food was good and what you would expect. We started with Guacamole for $5.50 (photo) and shared an order of Nachos ($8.50).  The guacamole had some mango through it, which made it interesting; while the nachos were drizzled with several different types of cheeses. Not bad for bar food. 

Since these appetizers were filling, we ordered some Empanadas ($5.25) and a couple of Tacos for $3.25 each. The empanadas came with shredded chicken(photo) but were overly doughy and had a flour after-taste. The Carne Asada tacos were good, but admittedly we were spoiled from last week's adventure at Gallo. 

The bill came to $42.75 plus taxes and gratuities, so expect to pay $27 each unless you're very thirsty. LOL. 

We found Salt & Lime Three Stars, A-Okay

After having such a wonderful experience here with my cat a couple of years ago, I was incredibly disappointed with the treatment we got last April when my border collie, Queen, got sick.
They found a mass bigger than a grapefruit on her spleen.  She was so lethargic, I couldn't walk her around the block.  That was so unusual for her, especially with her breed.  This was a dog I could take on 10-hour hikes in the White Tanks and she'd still be ready for more.
I was told I could have her go through surgery and that if it wasn't cancer, she could have a year more to live.  Keep in mind, Queen was 12.  Ripe age for a very active dog.  If it was cancer (it would take two weeks to find out), she could go through chemo and have another 6 months to live.
I didn't feel that surgery or chemo were something that a) would give her the quality of life she had lived thus far b) was something I could afford or c) the best decision for her health.
I took her home (it was a Friday night) and decided to have her put to sleep the next day.  When I got up Saturday morning to let them know I would be in, it took about 10 minutes for them to call me back.  In fact, it was the actual vet calling, trying to talk me out of the humane treatment for Queen, and trying to talk me into spending time, money and emotional stress on my dog, just to have her for another year.  Selfish.  I couldn't bear to have her sick at ALL any longer.  He pushed a little more, and I informed him I would be in as soon as my Mom arrived from Payson to go through it all with me.
I felt like the care they were giving was more financially-based than humane.  
I'll never take any of my animals here again.

Where do I start? Cocktails! This joint has an entire section of their menu for Moscow Mule variations. 

That's it. End of review.

Nooo. I kid. 
But if you're a fan of Moscow mules take a Lyft here. Partnered with a drinking friend during Happy Hour we were able to sample four of the six available. All include ginger beer. $5 during HH!

Yes, FIVE dollars.
[Be still my heart.]

Happy Hour is sweet. Mon-Sat 3 to 7pm. If you come on Sunday a bottle of wine and pizza (or prime rib) is only $20. Monday 1/2 priced wine. Tuesdays offer $4 craft beers. 

My partner in crime narrowed our eating options to street tacos ($3/piece) and a $7 pizza. (What can I say? I'm a cheap date.) The tacos we had were amazing. I'd eat those again in a heartbeat. The pizza of the day was delightful.

This is a stunning restaurant. Outside seating for when the The Oven temperatures are not in effect. The bar has great seating. (You can comfortably enjoy a meal there.) Booths abound. Pink Pony has *tons* of baseball memorabilia. On the sidewalk is the original home base plate from the Scottsdale Stadium!

Being greeted like family at the door by the owner set the mood. I *adored* my visit to Pink Pony.

Oh no, not another Starbucks review. But, read on.

I come here two to four times a week, mostly to relax and have some quiet time. If you come here often, you might find that statement funny, since there's always a steady stream of folks coming and going.  But the line is never longer than three, go figure.

This is an above average location for Starbucks, in so far that you have the space to linger, sip your beverage, snack and read a paper. The wall spaces have a few 110 outlets, so you know who sits there.  But the beauty here are the spaces that come away from the wall, which are always free. 

As others have noted, the drive-thru is a mess. So I've never understood why more patrons haven't decided to come inside and see how friendly and inviting this store really is.  All the employees are great btw.  Fortunately most have decided to stay in their cars. Fortunate for me. LOL

I've found 6:30 to 7:30 am and 2:00 to 4:00 are good times to linger.  If you do, I'll be sitting at the big table near the door. Stop by and say "hi"! 

So, three and seven-eighths Stars, and yes, I am a fan.

The lunch specials are great here! I had the "Pineapple Chicken" lunch special priced at just $5.95 and it came with soup and fried rice. The "Egg Drop Soup" was fantastic! It was a comforting soup on a chilly day. The amount of chicken surprised me. It tasted very good. The outside was crispy and the center tender. The rice was cooked perfectly and there was a good amount of that too. I had a coupon that gave me 2 free "Egg Rolls" with a purchase of $15 or more. The egg rolls (veggie) were a bit on the greasy side, but tasted good. 

I was having lunch with friends and stopped in to order the food to-go. When we were about to have lunch and the food was getting set out, we noticed some "Fried Wontons" with our food that I didn't order. I have no idea what was in them, but they were greasy and good! Everybody enjoyed them so it was a nice and unexpected bonus!

They deliver and lunch specials are from 11am - 4 pm.

Like ancient Rome, Caesars Palace is old, but still impressive.

Caesars has done a decent job of upgrading rooms, restaurants, and entertainment in an effort to keep up with best of Vegas. Sure, for similar prices you can usually find a 5-star Las Vegas room, but staying at Caesars in the middle of the strip does have benefits.

The hotel has a wide range of rooms to fit just about any budget including classic rooms, tower rooms, fancy "Nobu" rooms, multi-room suites, spa suites, exclusive "Laurel" rooms, and, of course, Forum Tower Emperors Suites for bachelor parties made famous in Hangover. In room amenities vary depending on the class of the accommodations. Don't forget about the mandatory $28 Resort Fee per day when booking your stay, too.

Headliner acts often do short stints at Caesars so if you are a fan of Celine Dion, Jerry Seinfeld, Elton John, Shania Twain, Jeff Dunham, Rod Stewart, or one of the other star acts then purchase tickets online early. Absinthe is an adults-only show five nights a week that blends a cabaret vibe and raunchy humor with acrobatic skills.

Even if you don't stay at Caesars Palace, the dining and shopping options are worth a visit. The Forum Shops is a huge indoor mall of stores and restaurants under a blue sky. It's an experience to see at least once and take in the architecture, statues, and animatronic performance at the large fountain. 

For eating at Caesars, Bacchanal is the current "it" buffet with lines and prices that will make you wonder if "it" is really worth it. There are dozens of other options including chains like The Palm, Spago, Joe's Seafood, Cheesecake Factory, and such. Other name restaurants to consider are Guy Savoy, Nobu, Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, and Gordon Ramsey's Pub.

Obviously, Caesars Palace is much more than a casino. The gaming areas are relatively clean and smoke-free. Slot machines seem everywhere or sit down to play poker or blackjack for awhile.

Self-parking is free in the structure behind Caesars while valet is convenient (except when they are busy). Because Caesars Palace is in the heart of the Las Vegas strip, it is convenient to the Bellagio, Paris, Cosmopolitan, Mirage, Treasure Island, and the Venetian.

Caesars Palace has remained remarkably relevant for over 50 years. Even though it isn't among the elite hotel resorts in Vegas, the "Spartacus meets Rodeo Drive" vibe is well maintained with plenty of attractions, restaurants, and shops to attract visitors and guests.

How does this place not have a better ratting?! 

We reserved a cabana and sat outside with a stunning view next to the large koi pound. We had the Top Chef tasting menu and were blown away by several of the dishes. 

Of what I remember, my favorite things included the octopus, which was literally the most amazing octopus I've ever had. It was incredibly tender. I also love the rigatoni with seafood! Large pieces of lobster and a light tomato sauce made this dish irresistible. 

The Spanish shrimp were also swoon worthy. They were sweet and delicate and melted in my mouth. 

We had our ravioli's topped with white truffles because, hey, it's Vegas and if you are going to indulge anywhere, it might as be here. This was my favorite thing of the night and I was practically licking my plate. I think I would have licked the plate if no one were watching :)

Finally the fish we had in a salt crust with zucchini was up there with the best fish I've ever had. 

We were soo full but there was still dessert! And I am never one to turn down dessert. An assortment of 3 gelatos, 3 sorbets and 3 granitas nicely made their way to the center of our table. Next was a panna cotta, a rum cake and a lemon cake. The winner was a chocolate cake with banana gelato. Yummy. 

I was beyond stuffed but this was one of those times when it's well worth it!

Came here with a group of friends to see The Green perform.. While walking up to BB we saw a huge line of people and got worried but that was just the line for the box office.. If you had already purchased your ticket, you were able to walk straight to the entrance and head up the escalators... 

I really love the space of BB.. You are free to stand and listen to the music, get as close to the stage or as far away as you want, dance with your friends or go outside on the patio and hang out.. At one point one of my GFs and I were too drunk and wanted to sit down so we got a table in the restaurant section.. which BTW from our booth, we had a great view of the stage.. We ordered cheese fries which came out to be over $13 (a bit overpriced IMO) but service was friendly, especially the drink runner, Pons!

I will definitely be coming back to the Brooklyn Bowl and will hopefully be taking advantage of some of the bowling promotions that they do for locals~

HOT TIP: BUY YOUR TICKETS IN ADVANCE! It's cheaper and gets you in faster...

This review is for the 2012 Electric Daisy Carnival at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.  They should have called it the Electric Daisy Clusterfuck.  Nothing good can come out of 200,000+ people on drugs trying to figure anything out.  Here are a list of the pros and cons of the event:
PROS:
There were a lot of cool things to look at, including parades, rides, lights, and art installations.
Despite huge crouds, I did not personally witness any violence or riot behavior.

People were pretty chilll
CONS:

Traffic was a huge clusterfuck.  It took us 2 hours to drive the 20 miles to the venue on Friday, and 3 hours on Saturday.  

LInes to get in were also long and out of control.  We were sent to three different lines from staff when they told us to "go to the next gate, there is no line".  On the way, other ravers were walking toward us, claiming they were told the same thing.  

There was clearly no communication between staff members.

Hope you're not a fan of toilet paper or washing your hands after using a tiolet shared with tens of thousands of people.  The sanitation conditions are horrific.  

Not a single event staff member knew where water stations, bathrooms, lockers, first aid, or parking lots were located.  After each time we asked a staff member a question (like, which way to Lot 9?  Where are the lockers?  Where is the nearest water refill station?) we were met with an apathetic, "I don't know..."

Las Vegas PD clearly turned a blind eye to those who were endangering themselves and others- While stuck in traffic on the way to the LVMS, I saw TWO trucks with passengers riding in the bed of the truck drinking.  These people were not pulled over by police, which made me nervous as to what else was going on in plain sight.  I'm not stupid, I know that people go to these events to party and do drugs, but it scares me to think that there are people blatantly endangering themselves and others and no one is doind anything about it. 

The fact that the event was shut down at 1 am on Saturday didn't contribute to this shitty one star reivew- it is because of the obvious greed exhibited by Insomniac and Pasqual Rotella to oversell a venue to almost 300.000 people promising that it will be a safe experience.  I feel like they took our money and then said, "Thanks, and fuck you" since it was clear that there was no training what so ever for event staff, nor did they seem like they cared at all about any of us.  Personally, I will NEVER attend another Insomniac event.  Someone was injured Sunday night in an accident which is unforutnate, but I am glad (and surprised) that there were no deaths this year.  Fuck you, Insomiac, you selfish rat bastards.  

TLDR: Don't waste your money or time on this clusterfuck of an event.  Bottom line: I felt UNSAFE and taken advantage of during the entire experience.

A chip collector?   Are you a gambler?  A semi pro Vegas historian?

Then Spinettis is the shop for you.
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=WCyD3030jgcUJSpCJ-jgig&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

I have a friend who is an avid chip collector, he has cases of them, really cool display. He asked me to call him from Spinettis and let him talk to the guy there. Happy to help a friend in need.  I watched the guy started pulling a bunch of old $5 chips from the case and handed me back the phone. "Are there 17of them" my friend asked? I counted..1.2.3.4... Yup. " OK pay him $425 for the lot". WTF I thought for less than $100 wort of chips! My friend is a nut!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spinettis-home-gaming-supplies-las-vegas-2#TeeFv031vYLnN7cmjtNqDA

But as I looked at the chips and the hundreds of others I could see the appeal. These were some pretty unique chips with some cool artwork. I liked an Elvis one the best.

The guy working the chips was very nice and must really know his stuff, I certainly got a education on the chip collection game. He told me there are people with thousands of them and some go for mega bucks (thousands!). Sorry I left camera in the store. Borrowed these.

They got other stuff for collectors from ash trays to dice to cards from various LV casinos. 

They also have anything you may need to transform your house into a mini casino. Tables, chips, cards, dice, shufflers even bingo supplies, so rush on over there and get yourself in on some of the lucrative casino bucks. Why should Italians and Indians have all the fun?

So if collecting stuff like this floats your boat give this place a try, I'm sure you can find something for your collection too.

Already a fan of the location on East Tropicana, I was excited when Tia Shirley B. informed me that a new Taco y Taco would be opening in this part of Henderson, close to where I work, work out often, and have many friends who live in the area (including Shirley B.).  A friend and I headed here last Saturday after a long training ride, ready to get our taco on.
     Just after opening at 11:00am, we walked in to find a spacious restaurant complete with bright lighting, high ceilings, a bar, and staff that greeted us heartily; this used to be the Republic Kitchen & Bar restaurant, so it may be the nicest taco place I've visited. I was quite surprised to see a DJ mixing tunes at that time of day, but not a bad thing. There were a couple of other customers already eating and the place got progressively busier during our visit.
      Set up like the other location, there are stations where you can order tacos, burritos, quesadillas, bowls, elote (corn on the cob), fries, nachos, mulas, and vampiros.
     Meat choices: al pastor, asada, pollo, tripas, carnitas, cesos, cabeza, lengua, trompa, suadero, buche, and chorizo.  Vegetarians have an option of soy chorizo and panela (pasteurized cheese).   There's a salsa bar with lots of options for you to add to your order.
    I had two al pastor tacos with pineapple, a carnitas vampiro (two crispy tortillas with the meat and cheese inside), and Mexican street corn on the cob (elote) with the works (mayo, cheese, and chili powder)--I was hungry one minute and then full the next.  My friend had never been to Taco y Taco before and he gobbled up his food before I finished.   
   This Taco y Taco gets five stars from me for the location, the tasty food, and the service; I'll definitely be here a lot.  BTW, for those fellow Yeeps who've been missing Tia Shirley B. while she's been off Yelp, she's been here almost every day since they opened so you may see her when you visit!  Buen provecho, mis amigos--la vida es demasiada corta para ser descontento o comer comida mala.

My favorite hotel in Las Vegas hands down. The rooms are decor heaven with the best view on the strip. They also have balconies which is awesome and rare for strip hotels. 
The parking garage is also one of a kind. With each spot they have a pressurized sensor that either reads red for "spot taken" or green for "available spot" this makes parking less of a nightmare unlike a lot of garages.
 The Cosmo also has some of the best restaurants in Vegas. CHINA POBLANO by chef Jos Andrs created especially for Las Vegas showcases his personal take on Chinese and Mexican cuisines. Noodles and tacos come together in a festive, stylish setting. Ive tried the majority of items on the menu but my favorite are the chocolate tacos. amazing. STK is another one of my absolute faves. The bar is the centerpiece for this lively new aged steakhouse. This is a must visit place.
Marquee Day/Night Club- Vegas's newest hottest club on the strip. 3 stories of awesomeness and different themes for each, there is something for everyone here. The Library (3rd level) is my favorite. with the employees dressed up as librarians and the room rings true to an old fashioned library. 
The Boulevard Pool- Best place in Vegas for concerts. this venue is absolutely stunning with the palm trees and city center as the back ground. Its also pretty cool too because the crowd stands in the pool that s drained out for concerts, and the stage is up close and personal. very intimate setting.
Shopping- you cant forget the shops! DNA2050 is a one stop shop for the ultimate denim fit, style and trend. A boutique offering a unique and contemporary way to shop.
CRSVR Sneaker Boutique-Specializing in limited edition sneakers and men's & women's casually dressed up fashion.

All in all this is an amazing property and its def a must visit!!

A few weeks after my first visit, I went to Sweets Raku again since they have new menu items.  I took my sister here so we can try Mt. Fuji, Veil and Ringo. As for the tea, we tried Tokio (sweet berries green tea) and Sakurambo (Japanese cherry black tea) with our dessert prix fixe. I have officially tried all their desserts, yay!

Amuse:
Mango sorbet with mint jelly.  The mango sorbet was a little bit tangy but very delicious with the mint jelly. I had the strawberry sorbet the first time. Both flavors are very good since they're two of my favorite fruits. 5/5

Mt. Fuji:
Spongecake, chestnuts with chestnut cream, chestnut tuile, chestnut and chocolate. I grew up liking chestnuts and chestnuts in dessert isn't common in Western cuisine so, this was a no-brainer.  5/5

Ringo:
Apple pie with honey ice cream, white chocolate dusted with cinnamon. There's a sugar candy shaped like an apple that has cream inside. An American classic got exciting again. Break the candy apple with your spoon for cream to put on your apple pie. The apple pie itself isn't sweet so eat it with honey ice cream. 5/5 

Veil:
Stuffed custard pie is what i says on the edible menu so it doesn't sound so interesting. I really was hesitant to order this because how exciting is custard pie? But I must say, I saved the best for last. What you get is flaky pastry with custard on top and in the middle...on top of berry cream swimming in compote all wrapped in a web made of sugar. The Apollo (chocolate and raspberry mousse) is a safe and obvious choice for chocoholics like me but I stepped out of my comfort zone and I'm glad I did. This is the best item they have on their menu. Confetti and glitter! 5/5

Excellent service as usual and our server, Kazue remembered me from my first visit. I'm still in love with this place. It makes me feel like a kid again. Genius! I think I might be addicted to this place now. The best way to end my birth month. Remember to join their e-mailing list.  Sit at the bar (if it's available) so you can watch the action and talk to the chefs. It's $19 for the prix fixe menu (sorbet + your choice of dessert + petit four) or $12 for just dessert (Apollo, Marriage, Veil, Mt. Fuji or Ringo). If you get Apollo wit your prix fixe, you'll get cheesecake instead of the lava cake. For descriptions of the other dessert items, read my previous review.

ToGo isn't quite the new kid in town, but they are trying hard to make a go of it in the Valley.  

ToGo's origins are NorCal, with a huge following there.  Here, they've met with mixed results so far, closing some locations including one in Scottsdale. 

Their choice of locations have been somewhat puzzling, with no natural customer base like a school or large office park nearby. The other nearby Togo's location (Chandler/Tempe border) is tiny and shoehorned next to a Fry's.  I've driven past it many times not knowing it was there, but this one is much larger. 

My two co-worker and I made a trip here for a late 1:30 lunch one Friday. There was only five or six other here. So it gave us time to chat with the Manager and have him give us a nice introduction and overview to Togo's.

The subs were very good. But the bomb is their Pastrami. It's a killer. Expect to pay $8 including a drink for a small sub, or $10 for the large waist buster. LOL

There's also a frequent diners card and an email club you can join to get online specials. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free drink, see photo. 

So the three of us are now Fans and enjoyed our Four Star meal.

We get there. Reservations for six at 6. Half our party is there, half is on it's way. We tell them we're here. Can't sit until the whole parties there. I get that. But then the hostess adds "we have a party at 8 PM that's sitting at your table and you'll have to leave by then." I get that, sometimes you gotta hustle.

We sit at 6:15 with our whole party. Our server comes up without even a GREETING and says, "we have another party sitting here at 8 PM, so you'll have to be done by then." I don't get that....

That was just a little too much! I've never been anywhere that was so blatant about getting you outta there asap. I understand you've got to move people in and out, but don't tell us when we haven't even ordered a thing and are planning on spending money in your establishment! Even with taking our time we were done at 7:45 PM. Plenty of time to clean off the table for this important party. 

Too bad because the food was good. The service left a little to be desired...

Dining amidst anguished skeletons.  No, not our wizened elders who lost too much at video poker but rather huge unnerving bas reliefs prominently displayed in the unique dining space.  It sets the tone for an interesting meal.

This is not street food.  Mexican by design but SoCal in cuisine.  Outstanding ingredients create pumped up, exciting, familiar flavors unattainable in Mexico (Dungeness crab, Maine lobster, day boat scallops).  Get it?

Straight to it, the "Cabo Azul" is delicious and the best way to sample multiple seafood dishes.  (1) incredible, perfectly cooked, sweet Maine lobster enchilada enveloped in a creamy, slightly spicy pasilla pepper sauce.  (1) grilled relleno stuffed full with cheese, shrimp and Dungeness crab in a light, earthy, relleno sauce.  (1) outstanding Ensenada style shrimp taco in a lightly crisp, grilled flour tortilla.  All three plus the usual sides..  The beauty of it all, the flavors mix and match making it one great plate of food.

For scallop lovers, the "Callitos Mazatlan".  Pan seared in a creamy, chipotle sauce.  The mild chili flavor and heat accentuates the sweetness of the scallop while the rich cream, the oceanic flavor.  

Great surf and turf options.  The "Filete Costeno" marries a prime, cooked to temperature filet with a Dungeness crab enchilada (in cream sauce), and cotija / jack cheese stuffed chilies.  The flavors combine so well, you're almost tempted to cut everything into bite size pieces and mix it up.  Almost.

Vast selection of tequila.  Ordering a call margarita can be daunting.  Better to just enjoy a snifter of the best after dinner (yes, it's serious quality tequila).

Efficient and friendly service.

Prices?  Lets just say they serve complimentary, fresh, warm chips to accompany house made salsas.  It's Vegas baby!

Thank you, Velveteen Rabbit, for being a cocktail bar where consistent, craft cocktails come first.  The trend of style over substance at newer bars has been disappointing, and I'm happy to see that Velveteen Rabbit offers such a strong cocktail menu.  It's been a while since I've seen a drink menu that makes me feel like I have to try everything on it; after a couple visits I have three more left to try, and I can't wait.

The Crucifix in a Deathhand is by far my favorite on their menu.  It's a complex drink where almost every sip offered different flavors.  Highly recommend ordering this drink first, so that your tastebuds aren't dulled from drinking too much early on.  It's fantastic, and if you don't agree I'll gladly finish yours for you.  The other highlight for me was the Improved Whiskey Sour.  Since most every bar uses premade sour mix, it's not hard to improve on a whiskey sour; Velveteen Rabbit does better than that and uses cherry, lemon and cinammon flavors to round out the cocktail.  A real treat, easy to sip and probably more appealing to a wider range of palates than the Crucifix.

Velveteen Rabbit is easily accessible, with street parking and a small private lot available.  Same drinks made by different bartenders were consistent.  No bouncer hovering around the front door.  Music is not deafening.  Three visits over the course of four days.  Yeah, you could say I'm a fan.

I was initially looking forward to visiting this Vietnamese restaurant because of the high ratings on Yelp. The interior gave a modern feel as the red, black, and light wood dcor was spaciously arranged with slow natural lighting coming through the windows.

The Com Ga Nuong ($7.50) came with pieces of chicken grilled to perfection. It was marinated with ginger, lemongrass, shallot, garlic, and served with pickled veggies and steamed rice. The chicken was moist and juicy, but the flavors on the marinade and pickled veggies were faint. The dish had promise, but the flavors were kept too safe and failed to stand out. The dish also came with a bowl of over-salted soup which I could not finish. 

The server kept asking me if I wanted to order something else. Feeling pressured, I ordered the Taro Boba ($3.99) since he said it would be made with real taro. The quality of the boba was decent at best, but the drink was made with powder instead of fresh taro.

I then turned to the female server to inquire about the drink. She said they don't have fresh taro in the restaurant and that the drink was made with powder. Moments later, the sever came back to reassure the drink was made with real ingredient. I was visibly upset by then, so the server went outside for a few minutes before returning to my table to say, "We grind up real taro into powder so it can be mixed into the drink." Since I make boba drinks at home, I can guarantee you that such practice is not only unusual, but this guy must be delusional or in the midst of a cover up.

The owner of the restaurant noticed that I was extremely dissatisfied about being lied to, but did not address the issue to intervene. The second server was at fault too since she did not comp the drink or bring it to the ownership's attention. I told her, "I wouldn't have ordered this drink if I know it's not made with real taro."

I have been eating taro since childhood so I can distinguish those that are artificially made. To insist that they were telling the truth, after the second server had already admitted to the error, earned them a zero star for 1) up selling their customers, 2) dishonesty, 3) lack of intervention and apology to fraud, 4) indifferent ownership.

I would never come back to support this business and encourage the public to do the same.

Swankified and fun atmosphere, especially when you have DJ's like Afrojack and David Guetta in the house! This is a nightclub that seriously knows how to party.

Guide to having a good time at XS:

1. Go on a night with topnotch DJ's whose music you can groove to for many hours.

2. Get a VIP table + bottle service if you can fork up the money. IT'S WORTH IT.

3. Look around. Lots of interesting/strange characters!

4. Dance. Laugh. Have a good time.

The layout at XS is great because you get a great view of the DJ from almost every angle. The outdoor area features a pool where crazy antics take place. There is minimal seating for the general public -- gotta stand if you don't pay up. If you're okay on your feet for hours you'll be fine, but ladies know it is SO worth it to have a table. Not to mention service from the hostesses is excellent and they're also pretty cute.

My favorite part of the night was dancing up on the cushions of our booth seats (happy feet!). It was comfy as well as an awesome vantage point. We could see: 1) all the oddly dressed and/or super drunk people around us and 2) AFROJACK+GUETTA as they dropped those beats!

DATE TIP (Gentlemen): Make a note of the paragraph above regarding seating. The ladies will love you if you have a table. Or at least visit you to rest their feet. ;)

DATE TIP (Ladies): Cushion dancing is awesome, but at an elevated height one is much more prone to creative pickup lines. A small price to pay for the view you get!

Overall, my experiences with Vosges have been good.  I've had one of the best milkshakes I could remember there--distinct taste, hand scooped ice cream, refreshing.  I have also had the good fortune to get some of their chocolate truffles as a gift, which were great.  Their truffles were a lot like their milkshakes--they tasted good, but the flavors were also distinct and unique (not just rich, chocolately and heavy like many--though not all--of the truffles you will find at Godiva).

On my last trip, I ordered one of their milkshakes (the Wattleseed--kind of a nutty vanilla) and while the taste was very good, it was way too thin.  It was more like drinking cold milk than a milkshake.  For the price, the portion size was not that big.  This was made worse by the fact that they used so little ice cream in the milkshake.  Since this milkshake was so thin and not that big, I drank it quicker than probably any milkshake I've ever had.

Vosges is definitely not cheap, but the quality is good and the flavors are distinct and sophisticated.  I'm not one to send stuff back, but given that the service is good, they would have probably re-did the milkshake if I had requested.  I will still return to Vosges on my next Vegas visit, but I hope my milkshake will be better.

I will also have to splurge and take home some of those good chocolates.

Vosges is also known for their expensive, gourmet candy bars, which you can also find at Bristol Farms or Cost Plus World Market.

The best damn popcorn I've ever had. Seriously! 
The 505 is caramel popcorn coated in white chocolate and dusted with green and red hatch chilies.

The 505 is sweet, spicy and oh so addicting. I went through my big bag in ten minutes. 

Located on the south side of Vegas, Popped is a gourmet popcorn shop that has a huge amount of some of the most creative, insanely delicious popcorn I've ever had. They have at least fifteen different flavors (including specials) that you can sample before you purchase. And sample I did. Just look at all I tried. I tasted popcorn with white chocolate and coconut. Popcorn with jalapenos. Popcorn with caramel and apples. Popcorn with sea salt and vinegar. I truly got popcorn wasted. In the end, my wife and I bought four bags. This is what we took home with us:

505- Caramel popcorn coated in white chocolate & dusted w/ green & red hatch chilies http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OGQ_6nIn4QQL2U6t0XeHtA?select=chiThLLPBz2aAGrBzM1o3A

Dill Pickle Popcorn- Tasted just like dill pickles. This one's for you, Chris D. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OGQ_6nIn4QQL2U6t0XeHtA?select=Xh4sd5IkeabqzZpo-Dsa2Q
S'mores Popcorn- Caramel corn with graham crackers, marshmallows and premium Swiss chocolate http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OGQ_6nIn4QQL2U6t0XeHtA?select=giCcRVvmtaZBV3F02KorGA

Honestly, I've never tried popcorn this amazing, and I've had lots of different popcorn in my time. I'm actually going to buy some from their website to be shipped to my home soon. It's that good. 

The prices at Popped are cheap. A small bag ranges from three bucks up to five. Large bags range from five to seven or so. 
The girl working the day I went was so friendly and willing to let us try all we wanted. So cool. 

If you can't make it to Vegas to try this place, I would hop on their site and buy a few bags. Seriously, do it. You won't regret it.

We came here for a business lunch and left feeling as if we had just enjoyed something special. 

As our server Carlos bought us our menu and water glasses, I had already figured out what I was going to order.  I had been reading the Yelp reviews about their delicious Ceviche for $14.00. What caught my eye was the small cuts, almost diced portions of fish.  In some restaurants, it is almost like they are trying to overwhelm you with the size of the cuts.  Not here!  And yes, it was delicious!  Carlos asked how much spice I wanted before he mixed all the ingredients.  First class.

Also while we were checking in on Yelp, we found that there was $5.00 Off one Don Julio Blanco margarita. Thank you Yelp! They were also willing to substitute the offer for their Sangria. Nice!

My friend Richard S had the equally good breaded Coconut Calamari for $12.50. It was excellent!  

We split our bill and our lunch came to very reasonable $19.63, including taxes and tip. Next up will be coming here for their Happy Hour and Taco Tuesdays.

A seductive female devil sporting a two piece bikini, thigh high boots and a pitch fork surrounded by flames & palm trees got my attention.  While staying at the Monte Carlo on Las Vegas Blvd we thought we hit the jackpot having a Diablo's Cantina attached to the hotel.    

The food was kick-ass, I will give them that.  The guacamole was creamy, packed with just the right amount of heat and was topped with diced tomatoes & a sprinkle of fresh sea salt.  We also ordered the chicken nachos, holy shit they were huge.   They had to have weighed at least 5 pounds.  Fresh crisp tortilla chips layered with melted cheese, shredded chicken and lines of sour cream.  Seated at the tables closest to the side walks enjoying the people watching we were spotted by a couple we knew and they joined us for some drinks.  They asked the server to bring us another round clearly saying that the round was on them.  The server not only charged them, but when we received our bill, we were also charged for the same drinks.  I explained to her that you already charged the couple who left for those drinks, and as good as they were I did not lose track of how many $7.50 margaritas I drank.  She then played dumb and sent over the manager.  The manager showed up running his mouth like he wanted to fight. Already having had several drinks & knowing how little the LVPD tolerates patrons beating up a manager of a bar no matter how rude and obnoxious he was, I simply smiled, stiffed the waitress on the tip & left.

Until the incident with the blatant double charging of the drinks and the unnecessary attitude from the manager I thought the food, drinks & atmosphere were 5 stars!! Just a heads up to Diablo's staff, dumb clueless servers who hustles there customers with her pimp like manager's support gets you very few stars.

Pros: 
- Easy to make money if you lack a college education.
- A tourist economy that permits upward mobility among lower classes via tips. Also, it has become standard decorum in Vegas to tip in industries in that are not perceived as tip-worthy elsewhere (e.g., nail salons, car washes).
- Kitschy architecture and art that is unique to Vegas. 
- Affordable houses and townhouses. 
- Less racial tension than other larger cities.
- FREE PARKING EVERYWHERE!!! Parking lots are abundant, rarely do you ever have to park on the street, and parking lots are always free. 
- Cool place if you like to gamble and party.
- A truly 24 hour city - you can do your grocery shopping, hit the gym, or go out to dinner 24/7. 
- The winters aren't warm (it's a desert, not the coast), but snow in the winter is never an issue. 
- Never humid, with a little extra conditioner you can get your hair to do whatever the hell you want it to and never have to worry about it going flat or frizzy.
- Amazing shopping (think Chanel rather than Intermix). 
- Fine dining epicenter (housed in casinos only). 

Cons: 
- The women in Vegas are vacuous, uneducated, with bad style. Frosted pink lipstick, huge fake boobs, haggard ex-druggie face, baby-T's and distressed denim, and lots of sweat. I feel like I'm in an eighties porno. 
- Incestuous social circles. 
- No locally grown food, and the stuff that is grown here isn't organic (or particularly nutritious since there is no decent soil in the valley). Consequently, the food off the strip is prepared with ingredients that are shipped in from California. These ingredients are picked before they are sufficiently ripened, treated with chemicals to artificially induce ripeness, and therein lies the reason why food in Vegas is tasteless and the flavors are so muted. 
- Limited things to do if you don't drink, gamble, or go to clubs. This means that if you are under 21, you are at home getting high and playing video games (I know I was). 
- No cultural innovation, since anyone remotely talented or creative moves somewhere else. No available jobs for creative professionals. 
- Commuter university that doesn't lend itself to the establishment of a college town culture. 
- One of the highest high school drop out rates in the nation.
- One of the least responsive media markets in the nation. You will never see a film being released here that isn't being released in at least 100 other cities. 
- Highest teen pregnancy rate in the nation, a result of the insidious but ever-present religious power complex that exists in this city, constantly wielding its power to crush anything progressive or reasonable (like planned parenthood). 
- Lesbian community rife w/ gnarly uneducated women in cowboy hats or catty pseudo-hipster college students. 
- Huge population of people with limited or no education occupying high paying professions, meaning that the people operating this city are dumb as rocks. 
- Limited mental health care facilities, which translates into having a substantial percentage of the local population self-medicated and driving drunk 24 hours a day (hence the astronomical DUI rates).
- One of the highest domestic abuse rates in the nation. Conjoin a bustling drug trade, the 24 hour availability of liquor, and underscore it all with a cultural milieu that hates women (ala conservative religious and androcentric sex trade gender politics), and you get sky high domestic abuse rates. 
- The city attracts people who can't successfully live anywhere else, whether its due to their disaffecting personality, addictive behavior, or delusional relationship with reality. 
- It's a small town masquerading as a big city. People move here because they think the valley is the Strip, when in actuality, if you're not on the Strip, you're essentially in a strip mall somewhere in Arkansas.
- Downtown gentrification projects and new high rise developments are elitist, the cost of which prohibit young, creative, and innovative people from affording them. 
- All apartments have carpeted floors. Like I really want to live on a pile of fabric that has been lived on by innumerable other people that is impossible to sanitize. 
- The men in Vegas fall into one of three categories. A) a tourist who wants to get drunk and fuck, B) local who wants to get drunk and fuck, and then go home to his unknowing wife, C) Las Vegas native with severe addiction/mommy/daddy issues.
- Inconvenient public trans, grid system city planning, no "green" spaces, recycling services that don't serve apartments.
- Post-segregation town; segregation was an irrefutable social scourge, but it encouraged the development of rich cultural enclaves (e.g., Little Tokyo, Little Italy, etc.). Vegas lacks these rich cultural hotspots.

The grilling of food over an open flame is almost 125,000 years old.

And, the Habit Burger story is an interesting one. http://www.habitburger.com/story/  Yet the charbroiling of hamburgers and chicken is a cooking technique that many fast food places have yet to master.  Until now that is. We came here this past Saturday and came away thinking, Wow.

The menu is very familiar.  It will remind many of "In 'n Out" in it's simplicity and style of service.  Their Char-burger is $2.95 and the Double Char is $3.95. I don't know if you can order it animal style, but the burgers are delicious.  Yes, delicious.  It has that smokey char-boiled taste down to where you will want lick your fingers.

Other grilled Habit Burger sandwiches include, Chicken for $5.75, Tri-Tip beef $6.25, as well as Veggie options and Albacore Tuna.  The Sides include French fries, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and a salad range in price from $1.85 to $2.65.  

Besides a side of salad, Habit Burger also has six different Specialty Salads to choose from, ranging from a Garden for $3.95 to a Santa Barbara Chicken Cobb for $6.95.

A couple of burgers, a side of sweet potato fries and a drink ran us $12.68, including tax.  Wow.  Less expensive than "SmashBurger", slightly more than "In 'n Out"; but a lot better tasting.  Nice.

Enjoy!

Ohhhh myyyy goshhhh I LOVED this place! =)

So my friend wanted to go to dinner one lovely evening. I found this place on Yelp and it sounded really good. For the entree I ordered the Baked Artisan Goat Cheese Crepes. This thing was freaking amazinggggg... So good! It came with spinach, herb grilled wild mushrooms, roasted bell pepper sauce, and watercress salad. The special sauce that was on it was really good as well. For drinks, you HAVE to get the Bunny Slope. I saw a picture of it on Yelp and just had to try it. It comes with Vodka, Strawberry Cream Infusion, White Chocolate Liqueur. You wouldn't think it was that strong since it's on the thicker side but it was! So dam yummy! 

Not only was the food amazing but the service was spectacular. This place has only been open for a little over a year but I really enjoyed it. My only recommendation is maybe they need a little more decor in the place. The walls felt a little bit of plain jane. I will DEFINITELY be coming back for dinner, AND they have a happy hour that they will most likely see me at in the near future. =)

Ok, Ok, Ok another strip mall restaurant in Phoenix. I get it. We can be a fab place in a drab space. Wow, how cool, I just came up with a new motto. But let me just say, PCG, as the regs call it, is a FAB place. Voted many times as a local hot spot or a great neighborhood spot, PCG actually shines on many levels. Yes, the space itself is not inventive or trendy. But why do we go out to eat? Mostly for some killer ass food. Well, you got it here sister. Appetizer: bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with cotija....yowzaaa yowzaa Potsie. Yummy! The tenderloin rivals Ruth's Chris and any other high end steak place. The corn cakes are, well, let's just say I'd raffle off a limb for these babies. Pot roast is right off my Momma Jo's dining room table. The pork  tenderloin entree makes Miss Piggy cry and me, well I'm weeping already. Juicy, firm white meat with amazing sides. Services runs always a Bplus to and Aplus. Waitstaff knows everyone and is literally family to the owners and management. I LOVE it here. Now, the space. Yes, it's a mini mall. But they've made it iintimate and not sports bar like. The gang here has made a home run on  every level. It's like coming home everytime I eat here. EAT AT PCG people. It'll give strip malls a new meaning!

2.5 Stars

This is my first visit to Sushi Sonora(SS).  This experience left me in culture shock with never partaking in Mexican sushi.  Growing up in a half Mexican and half Cuban household being a glutton for Japanese food was a serious no-no until later in life.  SS is a very unassuming hole in the wall.  There is nothing fancy here but it is clean.  I came here with some coworkers for lunch and we were the only customers.  Let me be transparent with two things about SS, their rolls are expensive(none less than $10) and all their rolls have cream cheese.  I am not a fan of neither!  They had telenovelas playing on the TV along with Spanish rock which gives this place it's vibe.  

SS has many Mexican related treats that they fuse into sushi.  I saw a roll with carne asada or ceviche that did not catch my attention.  They also have one with a Sonora style hot dog just to name a few, BTW I did not get the above three.  I went with the Sinaloa roll $14(yikes).  It had tempura crusted shrimp, processed crab mix(I prefer crab stick), avocado and cream cheese.  The processes crab mix had a hint of tuna flavor which was odd.  Everything was fresh and I did not get sick so let's go with tuna in the crab mix.  I'm a bit embarrassed but the crab mix also appeared to be imitation from what I could tell.  The presentation was very nice but the plate had chips on it.  Am I being super picky, maybe but if I am paying $14 for a roll I want near perfection.  

So on this day I finally broke my Mexican sushi cherry!  Will I try Mexican sushi again, YES!  The likelihood of me returning to Sushi Sonora is slim to none until they drop their prices.  One more thing about SS, they do not sell aguas frescas!  What's up with that?  I am lucky enough to have many choices for south of the border sushi and cheaper prices in the metro Phoenix area.

On a whim, and because I thought it might provide for an amusing experience, I asked my cosmetologist daughter to wax my back.  I don't think she wanted to do it, as I was immediately provided with 3 reasons why it would be more expensive for her to do it than EWC.  Hey, I wouldn't want to wax my dad's back either...

I pulled up the website to perform a little recon, and noticed first-timers get a free waxing*.  Couldn't find what the star referred to, so I gave em a a call.  For guys, the free service could consist of an ear, brow or nose wax.  Booked!

Showed up, checked in, answered a skin questionnaire and awaited my mistress of pain.  Her name was Kayla, she was petite, had striking blue/green eyes, and is a talented artist.  After verifying that she had not yet detached any of her client's epidermal layers, and she didn't plan to make me the first, I let her approach my ears for the freebie.

Totally painless.  And since I had recently shaved, she had to tweeze some of the short hairs the wax couldn't pull.  I thought "this is going to be fun" as I removed my business blue button up long sleeve.

It wasn't until the 5th or 6th strip that I started to question my decision.  Ain't no funny @#$% happening, and it was starting to sting/burn/hurt.  Found out that some guys just get up and leave part-way through a back wax.  Probably because they aren't made to pay if they capitulate to a TKO.

Kayla suggested that I go to my happy place, and continued the depilation.  I winced with each spirited yank, like a captured spy who is continually open-hand slapped while bound to a metal chair.  Kayla, sensing my distress, or maybe noticing my perspiration sopping the protective paper table lining, would place pressure on the newly follicle-free area... and darn it, that helped.

It was rough, but we got through it together.  The $58 was rendered, along with a generous tip (how much should one tip a back waxer?) and I emerged with revealing, beautiful skin... under my dress shirt.  I was strutting, glowing, and feeling fabulous!  I took those 4 steps to gorgeous, and I never looked back.

However, when I fabulously strutted at home in front of the family, I was informed that there was a line of demarcation about two inches under my neckline which stretched from shoulder to shining shoulder.  It looked like a rip-curl of hair-nastys were about to white-cap.  Guess the neck and shoulders were not part of the full-back wax.  Must remember that for next time, or as I like to call it: 4 weeks out.

See you then Kayla, and this time I wont ask you to take pics

I remember when we went here for the first time
Saying "This is it! I'm gonna eat some chocolate so prime!"
This place is in the left wing of Caesar's Forum Shops
On our four-day trip this was one of our scheduled stops
Greeted on a semi-crowded Tuesday night, nicely
Seated to the souvenir shop's left and kitchen's right, precisely
We looked at the menu and were astounded by the selection
We needed someone to point us in the right direction

And ooooooooooh...I didn't listen to the waitress' recommendation (about maybe not getting the sampler)
And ooooooooooh...I better listen next time, I'm telling you
If we ever ever ever go back to Vegas we should remember
That we will get together together together with Max Brenner
We'll order the O.M.G. cookie
Order the milkshakes
Order food savory
So we may get together together together again with Max Brenner

"But shouldn't every chocolate dessert be 5-star here?", I think
And shouldn't all the flavors in their sampler be clear, and in sync
And while the milk and white chocolate bark "branches" were exciting
And the chocolate sauce and chocolate wafer balls made the ice cream inviting
The banana tempura had a strange batter and aftertaste
And the chocolate sponge cake had no chocolate flavor, what a waste
And while the waffle with fruit made me somewhat happy
The next morning I had a much better waffle with fruit at Mon Ami Gabi

And while the fondue was nice, it didn't fill my chocolate wish
They had to start the marshmallow grill flame twice because once it did extinguish
But however ever ever disappointed I was by this endeavor
I don't know if we'll sever sever sever our ties to Max Brenner
While we liked the bark branch
Liked the fondue
Liked the ice cream
We may never ever ever go back to Max Brenner 

And while the waitress was bubbly and endearing and sweet
The management had her working too many tables; she looked flustered and beat

While the concept is a clever clever clever cocoa endeavor
Should we ever ever ever go back to Max Brenner?
(Yelpers, please let me know if I should ever ever ever go back to Max Brenner!)

First thing you should know is you are "not suppose" to drink on this LED lit bar on wheels. It is "suppose" to only transport you from bar to bar to get your drink on. Here are my tips to make this experience all you ever dreamed of.....

*Pick only your coolest friends who know how to party. This is key to the whole equation equaling awesome.

*Load your ipod with all of your favorite gangsta rap and the Killers or whatever gets you in the mood to fuckin' rage. This crazy apparatus does not have tunes of it's own. All good, just come prepared.

*Adjust your damn seat. You may be too faded to hear the dude running the show point this out. If you are part hobbit like myself you have to lower that seat or you may not be able to sit like a normal human being for days and it will royally suck balls.

*Master the art of fake peddling. News flash: YOU DON'T HAVE TO PEDDLE IN REAL LIFE TO MAKE THIS BIKE MOVE. IT'S A MAGIC BAR BIKE YOU CAN'T DRINK ON. Pretending is always more fun. What's even more fun is if you look around at your friends really peddling like this is a high intensity spin class. Just smile and wave and do your fake peddling. It's Friday night and this is not the Tour De Vegas. It's like a booze cruise on the city streets.

*Tell the man in charge where you want to go. Otherwise he will take you to lame places like the Nacho Daddy or other lame tourist traps. Create your own destiny guys.

*Bring a "coffee thermos or something" filled with a tasty beverage that you can disguise as water or coffee or hot chocolate. That's all I have to say about that. If you can't decode that message than maybe you should just be home playing Candy Crush or something. 

That's all I got. Overall this is an amazing experience with the right group of people and the right music and right level of intoxication. Not 5 stars for me because the owner should A. Have his own music program. B. Negotiate drink deals with the local bars he drags you to. C. I wish it lasted longer. 

Enjoy the ride......

I'm seriously upset with myself for waiting this long to go get me some fried chicken :) KFC in my mind stands for Korean fried chicken and I have been looking for a place to match Bon Chon in New York and this place is as close as it's gonna get!  The chicken is extremely crispy on the outside and so moist on the inside it makes the white meat tastes like dark meat!  I love all the sauces they offer but the soy garlic is my favorite.  The family size is a huge portion and can easily feed 4-6 depending on ones appetite.  The dishes come with some ban chan (side dishes) and the cabbage salad with thousand island is a nice pairing to the spicy flavors in some of the dishes and chicken flavors.  We tried the bulgogi fried rice and that was tasty as well.  We also ordered the stir fried gizzards and I would have to recommend not getting it....not enough flavor and overly chewy.  But I'll overlook anything for good fried chicken or in this case SUPERB fried chicken.  Just two words bomb diggity! Similar concept to Soyo but with a cheaper price point.  The chicken beats the chicken wings at soyo and beats the fried chicken at Bazic.  Definitely give this place a try if you are a fried chicken connoisseur and perhaps you can head next door for a little karaoke action afterwards.

Holy Elephant Balls, Buddha! This place is incurrydible!!! Okay, okay I'll stop.

So my wife and I decided to hook up for lunch.  She works downtown so I decided to head down that way and pick her up.  I suggested Thai Elephant because I had never been, and she raved about the Pad Thai she had ordered a couple weeks ago.  It's located on Adams just West of Central Ave., and parking is scarce.  Make sure to have some change for the meter!

I knew I was at home when I saw the "People Love Us On Yelp" sticker on their door.  It was about 1 pm so the lunch crowd wasn't in FULL effect.  There were about 10 empty tables in which we had our pick. We sat by the window.  My wife ordered the Drunken Noodles with Chicken (a la medium), and I ordered the Green Curry with Chicken (a la medium).  A round of Thai Tea was also added to the bill.  Our food came out in about 4 minutes, which came as a shocker! Yes, I said shocker... I was pleasantly surprised!

The moment I slammed my chompers onto the emerald dripping chicken, I became green with envy. Envious of all the people who have eaten here in the past and had such a precious secret hidden up their sleeves.  I sniffled a bit, but not from emotion.  It was the green curry and its beautiful spices stroking my mucus glands in just the right way.  A bit of rice and a sip of the Thai Tea (I'll get into in a second) and I was right back on track.

The Thai Tea. Ooohhhh, the Thai Tea!  It was $2.50 and twice as large as the ones I order from The Street.  It was like being chosen by Ganghis Khan to sit alongside him in Xanadu and drink the Milk of Paradise (Rush Reference).  It was sweet, as you would expect paradise to be, and creamy. I began to float out of my chair and harpies wiped my nose as I sipped the golden brown goblet of goodness.

Service was Spectacular
Food was Fabulous
Portions were Phenomenal

Dare I say it? 5 Big Ones, Mr. Elephant... and I shall return!

I've always related better to older people.  When I was 8, I would abandon the boring, daft kids table to talk politics and play texas hold 'em with the adults.  When i was 12, I drafted a series of novels that were based on the life of coked out, wall street bonds trader and when I was in my teens, i dated a 30 year old.  I guess the last one is less charming than it is creepy but my point is, I'm great with the oldies but goodies.  I love talking to them, being surrounded by them and generally soaking in their lived-ed-ness. 

And this, my friends, is why I love me the Golden Nugget.  Not located on the glossy main strip, the GN is part of old vegas.  It's not shiny and new like the Bitchllagio or the Trampicanna (I know the Tropicana isn't new it just worked so well with word, Tramp!) and the likes but it has ten times the charm.  Okay, 5 times the charm...it's still Vegas after all and the words "charm" and "vegas" go together like "kevin spacey" and "straight".  The GN is where you can see Tony Bennett perform (yes, he's still alive.  and even he's surprised.  THAT SHOULD BE HIS NEW ALBUM TITLE!) and for all of you Swingers' fans, first of all, may god have mercy on your soul and second of all, this is the area where the movie was shot.  Downtown.  Not on the strip.  So every time you call something "money" (again, may god have mercy on your soul), you need to pour one for your homies over here on Fremont st.  Also, if you walk around this area late at night and you are a single lady, you might get raped and/or shot.  The Fremont Street Experience keeps it real.  THAT'S vegas, baby.  

I've been to the Golden Nugget quite a few times in my day and well, I don't mean to brag but, all of the delightful older gentlemen craps' dealers know me by name.  Or um, they know me by, "Dog Girl" because I am very unattractive and/or love to talk about dogs!   That's right.  I know Erich, Little John, Big John, Slow Hand John and Ed.  Plus, pit bosses Larry and Gail (she's my girl!  Holla!).  Man, I love the craps so much that if I were going to have a first born, I would name him or her, "BIG MONEY, NO WHAMMY!" or "High Low Yo!"  or "Swing batter batter, SWING!"  I like to mix my metaphors to play head games with my competitors.  And by competitors, I mean the other young tramps who set up camp at the craps' tables.  These are my older men, ladies.  The nickel sluts I mean slots are THAT WAY.  Bu-bye.

Please see my review of Binions to better understand my love of the game and also some super handy craps' playing tips.  Don't say I never gave you anything.  Signed, Laura "Useful" B.:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/Zzl4ffV9kFY3yOSSgyRUBQ?fsid=lK8DbTa3qaTHbq7_npkKQg

After a few trips to Churn, I decided it was time to try Windsor. I'd gotten a few tips from friends on what to order and everyone really enjoyed their food.
Kammie K was my lunch partner. When I got there, she had a bowl of pistachios in front of her. In. The. Shell. I love that! Good food always takes a little work, right? As we munched on the nuts (hahaha I am a nut muncher!) I saw something on the menu I'd been wanting to try for a couple months: kale chips.
The chips came with a ranch dipping sauce, but I only tried a little of it. They were perfect on their own! Garlic hunks and sea salt peppered each leaf perfectly. I can't wait to learn how to make them at home!
I also had bite-sized corn dogs. They were pretty good & came with a side of mustard, but some of the batter didn't cook all the way on a couple of the pieces.
The patio here is awesome. The misters really keep the temperature down, though I will have to really judge that in July.  
They have the BEST soundtrack playing, too. It's a mix of awesome 80s music. Oh, and their wall is covered in cassette tapes. Some of them are mixed tapes. FTW!!!
(Bring $5 for the valet. There is street parking, but it's hard to come by.)

I love, love Scramble! I don't know what it is about the place! Is it the sleek and simple decor? Hmm, is it the friendly, attentive service? Is it the supa yum food? Perhaps all of the above make me a fan of this joint! 

I so love Scramble ( Did I say that already?). On my first visit, I was with Mr. Hottie and we were Harley geared out . The staff didn't bat an eyelash at our rough appearances. They were warm and welcoming. I had the traditional eggs Benedict. I thought it was very good! I washed it down with a cup of coffee and was ready to tackle the rest of my day! 

On my second visit I had the biscuits and gravy. WHAT a huge portion! I wasn't terribly impressed by the dish, however. I guess I expected a little more flavoring in the gravy, but overall, the dish was satisfying. 

My third visit had me munching on the spicy and tasty chorizo and egg burro with extra avocado. Mmm... I couldn't eat the whole burro. I ate almost half of it and took the rest home. 

Each time I visit Scramble I am impressed by the staff. There is a person on the floor at all times checking on people and making sure their food is ok. Considering this is a walk up and order type of place, it's a nice change to not be forgotten after you receive your food. 

I know that Scramble will be a regular breakfast stop for me. It's nice to see such a great place take a chance on Sunnyslope. I think they'll come out winners!

It's hard to believe the 5-diamond, all-suite Venetian Hotel rose from the dust of the Sands way back in 1999. The opulent Casino, famous Grand Canal Shoppes, 24-hour Race & Sports Book, and large Suite Hotel Rooms (with sunken living room and Italian-marble baths) are just a few reasons the Venetian still reigns as a spectacular destination for an unforgettable Las Vegas vacation.

Of course, the Venetian is inspired by Venice, Italy (sorry, California). Several detailed replicas of landmarks from Europe's most beautiful city include Piazza San Marco (St. Mark's Square) with Campanile di San Marco (St. Mark's Campanile Bell Tower) and columns for the Lion of Venice and Saint Theodore. Other notable reproductions are Palazzo Ducale (Doge's Palace), Ponte di Rialto (Rialto Bridge), and Ponte dei Sospiri (Bridge of Sighs). 

Here are your best bets for a good time at the Venetian:

Rooms
 * There are more than 4,000 suites at the Venetian
 * Luxury Suites with King bed are standard & 650 sq ft
 * A 700 sq ft Bella Suite has 2 Queens for about $30 more
 * For either, about $40 upgrades to a Suite with a View
 * A Venetian Piazza Suite is 1400 sq. ft and only $150 above Luxury
 * Another $50 can get you a Venetian Prima Suite (1500 sq ft)
 * Rates get high for larger Renaissance & Penthouse Suites
 * An In-Suite Breakfast offer is available, but not my style
 * The Venezia Tower is newer, but may not be for everyone
 * Book online & check discount packages for the best deals
 * Daily resort fee: $25 + tax ($3): Fitness Center, Internet, & 1 coffee

Dining

Purchased this at the Paris buffet counter for $54 and some odd cents. The lady put the wrist band on for me so I couldn't keep it loose to take off when I sleep/take pictures (it's pretty bulky). You can't cut lines with the average ticket, but it's a real wallet saver! My cousin and I tried going to all of them, but after stumbling across Flavors at Harrah's, we decided to skip it and go back to Paris for our last meal. Here was our plan of attack:
8 Dinner: Le Village (waited an hour on a Wednesday) 
10 Dessert: Spice Market (couldn't resist the savory stuff though!)
8 AM Breakfast: Paradise Garden (took us an hour to figure out the buses to get there)
1 PM Lunch: Carnival Buffet (at this point food was starting to sound unappetizing... And I'm a buffet beast) 
5 PM Dinner at our favorite buffet (which will be Le Village. We want to go at 5 to not have to wait in line as long, but I'm not sure I'll be able to eat again in 2 hours!)

My biggest recommendation: by your pass for a late dinner and choose a buffet as a "snack" (tea time, dessert, elevenses, whatever you wish!) so you don't overload at all of them and still feel you got to go to them all. Also, these places can't fail a breakfast, so for buffets that have poor reviews (thinking flavors and paradise), go their in the morning to get made-to-order omelets, Crepes/pastries, waffles, etc. Good luck eating, I hope you enjoy it!

We enjoyed our brunch this Sunday. Arriving right in the middle of the rush, it was a surprisingly short wait. The tables turn over quickly here!

Even though they have tons of other stuff - sandwiches, waffles, salads - there are two pages of crepes on the menu - one of savories and one of sweets. Tough to choose!

After our waiter brought us two swimming pool sized cups of coffee, we chose one sweet crepe (the Apple Streusel) and one savory (the Crispy, which is cheese stuffed). Both took a little bit to be prepared, during which the coffee was refilled. Good coffee, btw. Even though they have lattes and cappuccinos and other 'elite' coffees, you can't go wrong with a cup of Joe here.

Both plates arrived looking excellent as you can see from the pictures. The apple crepe was massive and quite sweet. The "Crispy crepe" was excellent. Tons of cheese and lots of flavor. I think I made out better for having that one. Oh, and the side of potatoes? Heavenly!

Plenty of parking in the parking deck behind the restaurant or on the street if you can find it.

Dr. Susan Boyd almost cost me my life... 

She performed, well attempted to perform a normally simple laproscopy procedure going through my belly button to remove a cyst from my left ovary. 

This procedure she performed in a surgical clinic by her office near UMC. 

I was sent home about one hour after the procedure once my anesthesia wore off. 

I was home for two hours resting and I started feeling faint and my lips and face were turning blue. I felt like death, I knew something was wrong because my body was shutting down and I was slowly losing consciousness. 

My husband at the time called an ambulance and they rushed me to Spring Valley hospital where I passed out upon arrival. 

I don't remember anything other than waking up connected to lots of tubes, IV, and various life support machines. 

Come to find out I was bleeding internally and my organs shut down. 

Emergency surgery was done, following two blood transfusions. 

Rather than her performing the simple laporoscopy going in through my belly button and lasering away the cyst, she missed that completely and punctured my small intestines causing me to bleed internally. 

She did not remove the cyst, that I still have on my left ovary, in which she even goofed on the paperwork stating she removed a cyst from my right ovary which there is none. 

That is the irony of this, I went through hell in vain as the cyst is still there and was never removed. 

I ended up in surgical ICU for three weeks at Spring Valley hospital where I underwent a bowel resection to remove six inches of my small intestines she punctured through and damaged. 

I went through hell to say the least. I am LUCKY to be alive. This woman almost took my life. 

Thank you Spring Valley hospital and the two Doctor's called in as an emergency from other hospital's to save me. I was in such grave condition they did not have a Doctor on staff who knew what to do, or who could handle my emergency situation, so they called out for help from two hospitals in the east side of vegas. 

Her office placed a follow up call to my hubby and was aware I had been admitted to the hospital two hours after my procedure, not once did her staff nor her contact me or the hospital to inquire about my condition. 

They were rather nasty when my hubby went to pick up all of my medical records. They made him come back so that they could review them and make changes to them. That is not what they said but what they did. Dr. Susan Boyd attempted to cover up her mistake and by doing so she screwed up the documents all together. I was treated for a cyst on my left ovary, all of a sudden she states removed from right ovary which there was none? 

Yes Malpractice you say? It was however I signed my life away to allow a "simple" laproscopy procedure to be performed not knowing I was going to have my vital organs butchered. 

It took two years to recover from this ordeal. I have a real doozy of a scar from my breast bone clear down to my private area where I was split open for correction surgery, not once but twice. Basically ALL of my plumbing was redone. 

I was so close to having to use a colostomy bag the rest of my life. Luckily I had two great Doctor's perform my bowel resection as a team together side by side. 

It is a tragedy that Dr. Susan Boyd got away with this...she knew when she left me at the clinic that she had really botched this procedure. 

I wonder if she knew she perforated my intestines or as the result of it that I was bleeding internally? This I will never know... 

If I could rewind time I would, I can live with a cyst in which I am since she did not remove it. 

Karma is a you know what! 

She will get what is coming to her I am sure. 

She basically almost got away with murder and skipped out on a two hundred thousand dollar hospital bill. Three weeks in surgical ICU to keep me alive was not cheap! 

I am alive, physically and mentally scarred for life... I made it :) 

I am still here to share with the world, my love, laughter and smiles... 

This is just another example and reminder of some of the hell and life threatening close calls I have been through with "Doctor's" based in las vegas. I have only lived in Las Vegas 6 years and have had the worst outcome in dealing with Doctor's here. Yes a bad Doctor can be anywhere, yet I lived in San Diego and Los Angeles for years and had nothing but the best outcome and care from Doctor's and providers. Take warning if you have to have any medical procedure's done in Las Vegas.

I was 32 when this happened a few years back, I am alive because I was a fighter and was not ready to call it quits on life at such a young age. Especially not for the incompetence or at the hands of a Doctor who we are to trust with our lives!

Friday night and it's 4am.  You've been drinking with your friends since at least 9pm.  It's Scottsdale, so nothing is open and you've exhausted all the fun you can possibly have laughing at drunk idiots gobble down subs at The Philadelphia Sandwich Company (one of my favorite pastimes).  As you drive down Scottsdale Road you see Zorba's and flash back to your senior year of high school, when you and your friends would go into these places and giggle like the innocent little girls you used to be.  I decided it was high time I revisited this Old Town institution. 

Maybe it was the vodka, but I have never felt more comfortable and welcome in a sex shop before.  Usually I get that paranoid feeling that everyone is watching me and keeping tabs on the things that peek my interest.  

I asked the nice young gentleman behind the counter to give my friends and me a tour.  He let me ask stupid questions like:
-"What's your best seller?"  While holding the largest double dildo I have ever seen in my life.  Apparently Zorba's sells a lot of those, just is case you wanted to know.
-"How often do you clean these things and are you the one who has to do it?" In reference to the obvious jack-off rooms.  He kept saying something about no touching being allowed.  He showed me how the little window separating two private rooms will unfog when both rooms are occupied.  So, let that be a warning to you... unless you're into voyeurism I guess.  

He continued to indulge my inane questions so that I could get a good laugh.  Maybe he was bored and got some entertainment out of it too.  Thanks Zorba's for being such a good sport.  I hope you will be entertaining Scottsdale's youth for generations to come.

I was going to wait for an actual ABBA fan to write their 5 star review but it has been 3 weeks since the show started and people need to be informed dammit!!  My opinion comes off almost like a "significant other that gets dragged to the show" but my wife is not an ABBA fan.  I got free tickets through work. 

Also.....

- I generally despise Broadway shows.  "Rock of Ages" makes me wretch.  
- Never hearing "Dancing Queen" again would be a gift.
- Not familiar with the "Mamma Mia!" story.

The will call booth for Tropicana was a total mess.  It was 50 people deep 30 minutes before the show.  Definitely get there as early as you can to pick up tickets.  We ended up missing the first 15 minutes of the show because of it.  Tropicana either needs to employ more people or have an attendant weed out the people in line who are there to pick up or purchase tickets.  As we walked in, the usher didn't show us to our seats.  She just said "Sit anywhere! The show is about to go on again!".  Ummm..okay.  So I did what any person would do and took the first 2 seats closest to the stage.  The place was about 70% full and it took us about 20 minutes to figure out what was going on in the story.

All the performers seemed perfect for their roles and the singing was well done.  The stage set was pretty basic but you were able to get the idea.  I was most impressed with the live band behind the scenes.  Some of the transitions were tricky and I wished I had a backstage TV a la Le Reve to see them jamming out to "Money, Money, Money" or the almost made for a musical "The Winner Takes It All".    

Tropicana did a great job refurbishing the theater.  The makeover looks terrific.    The bar upfront shouldn't serve wine in actual glasses since I heard a couple of them shatter during the show which was distracting.  There was also 20 minute intermission midway through.

If you love ABBA, I see no reason why you wouldn't love this show.  I observed many attendees clapping along, getting pretty animated during some scenes and even reciting lines.  And if you're being dragged to the show against your will by that special someone in your life..bring a flask?

Now the last time I was at The Rooste, I was bedazzled in pink Hello Kitty cowboy hat taking home first prize. I think it was some kind of yelp sticker lol! And that's when I got the full flavor of this meaty, enormous yet charming country restaurant/bar/event facility/iconic Phoenix restaurant. We yelpers devoured the buffet and downed some free beer. This time, a little different...Let the sawdust fly!

Picture this. South Mountain. Covered in careening white mini vans and large American cars. Children. Everywhere. Like Children of the Corn. Octogenarians with walkers complete with two yellow tennis balls. Parents scrambling to keep their brood in order. Teenagers glued to their smart phones, completely unaware of the reason for this holiday. The stealing of land from the Native Americans. Yep. We Americans sure know when to party.

Picture this. Me. My mom and my dad. Two of the cutest things I've ever seen. Walking. Slowly. Navigating the "rustic" entrance to the restaurant. It's like they're trying to imitate Tim Conway. Me? Patient. Oh so patient. You see, I was psyched to have my folks all to myself. No cooking. No cleaning. But would the food be gross? Cafeteria-like? And the worst, cold?

No. No. And no.

From our warm biscuits and Indian flat bread to our entrees (we all chose turkey with all the fixins)...it was a fantastic meal for $20 a  head. Our server was efficient and delightful. If I remembered her name I would publicly apologize for my father's flirting. Heck. Maybe she liked it! She mentioned she was working from 9am to 9pm. God Bless her. Hope she's wearing sensible shoes. 

They were helpful with extras (can you say "More gravy please?") and with boxing up to go treats. We skipped dessert as I was serving pumpkin pie, chocolate coffee cake and coffee at my place.

The window booth we had (thanks dad for calling ahead) had those famous sweeping views of the valley, brown smog included. And of the large families swallowing the picnic tables outside below, chowing down and obviously having a good time. 

Other staff were energetic, friendly and helpful. 

I cannot imagine the pilgrims having a finer meal and a better time then me and my folks. 

Well, they did have those cute outfits. Not my folks. The pilgrims. Though mom was working her dangely Christmas tree earrings.

Oh. The. Holidays.

NO RETREAT!
NO SURRENDER!

Ohhh wait yes surrender to me please, insert evil laugh;  MUHAHAHAHA!

So yes I had some fun times here with a bunch of friends. I think that perhaps the biggest reason was that we prepartied like a bunch of drunks. We showed up at this place 5 sheets to the wind, not your typical 3! In other words, we were thankful for cab rides and cheap drinks. 

We were scattered across several guess lists but were all able to cruise in together once we arrived. I was on the Crowd Control LV guess list and was in for free. Thanks Chhen! 

Pro Tip: Do not plan on clubben in tennis shoes, hats, or douchey v-neck tee shirts.

When we showed up women were drinking for free and the guys had to pay $19-$23 per drink! That was ridiculous, but that is how LV clubs are unfortunately. They also had more tables than any club I have ever been to. 

Pro Tip #2: You can rest/sit down on the edge of the planters throughout the club. 

The main dance floor has a bar along one side as well as the entrance, a couple of stripper poles (only the staff gogogirls can use them though =\), a number of tables and the DJ booth. The best part was that they had some water cooling misters or something like that to help it stay a tad bit cooler in the 100+ degree heat.

Pro Tip #3: Beginning around 1am a number of the tables started to clear so we were able to snag one for our group

The music was good, lots of fun dancing as well. A place I would go back to so long as I prepartied and was on the right guest list for free! Fun stuff in the long run. Perhaps I will see you there...

This update is LONG overdue. 

Mabel's has become one of my favorite spots and is a solid part of my nightlife rotation. With that said, it has also become the cause and center of many drunken stories! And we all know drunken stories are the best stories...but this is about Mabel's, not my shenanigans. :) 

Music, whether live or spun by a DJ is always stellar. Makes me shake my groove thang and want to party like it's 1999! 

Service, every visit aside from my first has been top notch. Twice I've had table service with Holly as our server. She is amazing! They really take care of you when you have a group/event. Greg, the manager always addresses me by name and says hi when I'm there. Pure class. Also, they have some hotties working there I love to flirt with. (Yes, I'm talking about you, Silas...I may not have twitted you but I Yelped you! ;)

Drinks/Food, fantastic. They have great bubbly here. And bubbly cocktails. Yum. Of course they have all the top shelf liquor. Bottle service is phenomenal. They get creative with your drinks for you if you want and we had this grey goose/soda/ginger drink that was major yum. I've only tried a few of the items on the menu (deviled eggs, scallops, and something else I can't recall, too much bubbly! hehe) but they were all delish and perfect for snacking. I was told they revamped their menu and I have yet to try the new items but look forward to it! 

Now that the weather is cooler, they have started really enforcing dress code. You see a lot of guys in suits and ladies wearing their Saturday night best. Just the way I like it! 

I can't say enough good things about this place. If you haven't been to Mabel's, you are really missing out. Your Scottsdale nightlife will not be complete until you pay them a visit.

I love Mom and Pop run businesses. 

I was driving along Chandler Boulevard, saw the sign "Family Run Business" and decided to stop.  

There is so much homogeneity in our dinning experience today. Everything is so cookie cutter. 

Yet with that uniformity comes time tested (and test lab) food tastes, that makes us come back for more -- no matter which city or town we find ourselves in. 

But if you are tired of the "same old, same old" as I am, you keep your eye open for these places. Don't get me wrong Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ isn't perfect, but it's a nice change. 

Last night I ordered their Combo Dinner.  That's two specialty smoked meats, two sides, a soft drink and your choice of breads. I went with the Brisket, smoke polish sausage, garlic mash, apple cobbler and jalapeo corn bread for $10.99. They do the same thing for lunch at $7.99. 

I found Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ "A-Okay" and Three Stars good. The meat had a nice smokey taste that lasted after my meal, while the sides were little bland and the corn bread had no kick. BTW, what's with all this 4 Sq signage? I didn't even know they were still in business. LOL

I've been to Share probably 2-3 times in the past couple of years and it's pretty much the same thing every time. I think if you haven't been to Share, it's definitely worth going at least once so you can take it all in, so to speak. It's one of the only nice gay clubs in Vegas and although you might be tempted to opt for Marquee or Tryst, sometimes, you just wanna gay it up. It's by no means anything fancy, but it isn't trashy either. Located just a short taxi ride away from the Strip (I think I paid around $12 from the Wynn), it's a good option if you want to let loose and be fabulous. Again as other Yelpers said, it's best to go with a group so you can have a good time.

- Expect it to be kind of empty.
- Expect some good dancy upbeat pop/hiphop music.
- Expect the drinks to be around $10 (not bad for Vegas IMO)
- Expect some hottie gay-for-pay dancers that will probably spend more time hitting on your hag than trying to get your attention.
- Expect to awkwardly avoid sexual advances from the Vegas locals (they are aggressive and can bite, unless you like that)
- Expect to be standing the entire time (because the empty seats are reserved for bottle service, which NO ONE is paying for)
- Expect to leave happy you experienced it, but somewhat disappointed.

That's all folks!

"We came here for a quiet dinner but found ourselves in a middle of a loud and raucous Happy Hour. "

"That was our introduction to Crust Pizza & Wine Cafe. The wait staff was buzzing around. Constantly asking if you wanted something, or if you were done with that plate.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers, a salad and two glasses of wine. The food was excellent!"

I wrote those words about twenty months ago. It was through my own procrastination and laziness that I never finished my review  Not a lot has changed though in the interim. Just forty Yelp'ers reviews talking up the place and a even harder parking lot to navigate on a Friday night at 5:30. LOL

The place has a very New York feel to it and the pizza is very close to the real thing.   The only drawback was the over abundance of sauce, which made it sloppy. But the place has a good buzz to it. Things go smoothly and as I've noted the wait staff is on their game. It can be a very loud restaurant and depending on where you sit, you may not be able to hear your companion.

Tonight we tried the olives appetizer ($3.00), along with the white bean bruschetta ($5.00). Both were good. We agreed to order the twenty inch New York pie ($15.95) to eat and to bring some home. It was a good decision said our oldest!

The Kendall Jackson was a good choice and for $5.00 a glass an even better deal. A pint of their IPA was a steal at $3.00 and was a nice bitter. A Brit would be very happy here. Our bill came to $43.53 including taxes, but before gratuities.

Enjoy!

OM Heavenly G!!!  Who knew fried chicken and waffles went so well together!!!  My daughter was in heaven!!  She loved her chicken and she doesn't eat much meat at all but the crispy fried chicken had her knawing on the bone.  I ate my entire plate and so did my daughter.  And she has been asking to go back ever since.  And the sweet tea....YUM!!  It was just right, not overly sweet.  I don't know that a place like this exists anywhere in the Northern CA/Bay Area but someone should open one!  For now this is one reason I'm glad I live in Phoenix.....I will be a frequent customer.  

The inside feels like you walked into someone's house and I never would have known it was there since it's in a non descript part of town...kind of industrial.  We got there pretty early and by the time we left, the place was packed!  

I have been craving this chicken since we went there...I know we will be back!!!  And often!

See what happens when you wait too long to write your review!? Phoenix Magazine beats you to the punch and lists one of your favorite finds as one of the Valley's best dishes! 

Oh well, I guess I should just feel "validated."

Here's my take on this place:
For $12.50 you get a platter full of diced shrimp ceviche bordered by at least a dozen grilled regular sized shrimp and no less that a whole avocado's worth of wedges. It's served with crisp, flat, tostada chips and is plenty to share! A real value!!

If I'm dining alone, I generally get a couple of pupusas. Pupusas are like thick corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, beans or meat - your pick! They even offer a version stuffed with the loroco flower, which I understand is similar to a squash blossom. Myself? I'm a bean and cheese girl most of the time. And, I prefer them straight up: skip the tomato sauce and slaw topping. 

The chicken soup is flavorful and the portion size is significant, served with a couple of handmade tortillas.

Salvadoreno recently got a beer and wine license, and, a I can't think of a better beverage to wash down a pupusa than an ice cold beer!

Oh! I guess this can be my "scoop" - Salvadoreno is going to start offering a $7.95 lunch buffet from 11 - 3. Buffet items will vary depending on the day of the week.  I'm feelin' a pupusa eating contest as a lunchtime UYE!

You never know what you're going to walk into when heading to a Native American casino for the first time.  I've learned through the years not to get my hopes up and expect too much. Boy, did Talking Stick prove me wrong.  

The casino is absolutely beautiful.  Everything is new, clean, and everyone on the staff from dealers to floor personnel are as friendly as can be.  It's not a big place, but they offer all of the games you would want (other than craps).  We were there on a Friday afternoon, and they were also offering table minimums in every price range.  There was a large selection of $5 tables for multiple games.  

We weren't there long enough to play poker, but we still took a look at the poker room to see what they offered.  What we saw was a poker room that put 90% of the rooms in Vegas to shame.  The room itself was a massive, with 50 tables spreading all of the games (Hold' Em, Stud and Stud/8, Omaha/8 and Omaha Hi).  Not many places spread Omaha Hi anymore, so that was a pleasant surprise.  And the room itself was just immaculate.  Wall-to-wall TVs to keep your attention between hands, and tableside food service that looked wonderful.

If you're in the area looking to get your casino fix in, this is definitely worth the trip.

What a monumental shithole Treasures.

Cover charge at 4:30 in the afternoon was $33.00. Almost immediately upon entering you're besieged with hustling bitches trying to shake you down for table dances at twenty bucks a pop. Should you decline, they'll step up their marketing skills by offering you a package of five dances for only one-hundred dollars. 
God, they're clever. I think that works out to, oh wait, twenty dollars a dance.
As I said, clever.

When servers ask for your drink order, they'll immediately ask how you're going to pay for it, suggesting perhaps you may be homeless and without funds for such a wondrous event. 
The look on your face suggests you're experiencing a wtf moment. 

          " Cash or credit card?" she annoyingly barks while you're still in disbelief.

Shaken down at the door, now insulted, as if you were going to swill down a beer and beeline it for an awaiting cab without paying, you begin to reassess if any of this was worth it.

Whether your response is cash or credit, they'll demand payment up front prior to taking the order. I believe this is because, and this is only conjecture mind you, their default statement is to not trust anyone who graces their shit hole establishment for fear they're part shit hole too. It's a projection thing I guess.

Don't get suckered into a VIP dance in the back room by one of the many fleeting nubiles promenading about.. They're there for one reason. To take you to the 'back room'.
If you do get suckered into a back room dance, the fee starts at $100 with a $32 two-drink minimum, again, all paid up front of course. And god help you if you happen to get caught up in the moment, losing count of your five song 'deal'. The sixth song just shot the price up to $250 along with a now $50 two-drink minimum. 
It's like being penalized for getting caught up in the music and whirling tits!

You're now knee-deep in the shit, having unwittingly purchased the multi-dance package and guess what? This time, the dancer doesn't shake you down for loot, she waltzes you over to some guy bigger than all outdoors, whose tone of voice is lower than a 30" subwoofer and whose countenance is that of a guard at Buckingham Palace.

   "Two hundred fifty bucks pal, how you gonna pay?" 

I panic.
The eighth song just began playing and I don't know what the rules are. The seventh shot the price from twenty to thirty-five. After everything I've seen thus far, I'm thinking they're going to ask me to pony up a nut when song number eight begins playing.
I cut my losses and head for the door.

When you've had enough of their bullshit and want to take a cab back to the hotel, guess what, no cabs. 
Oh there are cabs, a cab line and a valet, but you're not going anywhere...not just yet. 
That's because you'll need to grease the valet, this or else wait in a terminally long line of losers who didn't have money to line the valet's pockets.

Here's what I did.
I saw an off-duty cab about 100 yards from their driveway entrance and started toward it.

   "HE'S OFF DUTY!" the valet shouts. 

    "FUCK YOU," I respond politely. 

I offered the taxi driver a fifty to take me anywhere as fast as he could. This so I could begin erasing the entire shitty experience out of my memory. 
He declines, saying he'll get in trouble with va-ray. (Asian)
I make it a Franklin.

  " Hop in" he says.

Everything about Treasures smells to high heaven, including the plethora of Russian whores in cheap perfume and glitter. You'll know who they are immediately.
They speak with the same dialect as that ugly bitch from Rocky & Bullwinkle.

I would only come back here if I won the lottery.

Here's a note: if you decide not to head our reviews and go anyways, make sure you don't have your boyfriend with you. Who knows, maybe he'll leave you at the 2nd floor to go down to the first floor to "drop off" that girl you weren't too sure about and end up "losing" him the rest of the evening only to find out that he made a move on her after "convincing" you that oh, no, she's "just a friend" and "I'm sooo not attracted to her" because she looks like "a cheap skank" (ok those last words were mine, but she really did look like a cheap skank).

I might not have paid the extraordinary amount (100 bones) to get in, but who the hell cares. It took forever. I stood outside wondering...ok, not wondering, more like stumbling...when the hell they were going to "take care of it" and let us in the VIP! Oh yeah-there is something you should know about this club. It has two floors of VIP, so you can be awesome sauce for one and smelly shit for the other. They also don't let you give lapdances on the couches downstairs (so what the HELL are they doing there?!), and that killed even the buzz I had which is weird because I was pretty fucking hammered.

One of their "waitresses" looked like an even cheaper version of Tila Tequila. Ew. (I'll love you Dani!!!)

There was NO dance floor...so again, why can't I give a lapdance to my NOW EX boyfriend?!?! 

At least the party I was with had money to buy the bottle service. Also, they had full length mirrors I couldn't stop looking at myself in.

Summary: You want to get cheated on? Totally take your boyfriend here. Just make sure you don't go to bed at 3am, wake up at 7, spend 18 dollars on a pack of cigarettes and a lighter and proceed to tell your journal that maybe you really are in love with him and its totally something you can get passed until you crawl back into bed with him and ask him to talk to you and suddenly next thing you know he told you to pack up get out and you're flights delayed while he trys to find a computer with internet to take you off his myspace page.

No, I'm not bitter--why do you ask?

I take the light rail daily to get from my place in downtown Phoenix to ASU.  As far as public transportation goes this is pretty good.  For the most part the trains come in predictable 10 minute intervals.  I've only experience an extended wait once.  I have waited 40 minutes in -5 degree weather for a T in Boston.  20 minutes is nothing to me.  Having disruptions in service along the way goes with the territory of public transportation.  Heck, it goes with any sort of transportation.  To complain that it is loud is just silly...it's a TRAIN!  I find it to be incredibly quiet when compared to the subway in NY or the T in Boston. Its not some rickety old high speed line or glorified trolley car.
 
Time wise and location wise its very convenient for me.  It takes me the same exact amount of time to get to campus as it would if I drove and it saves me $600 a year in a parking permit  I can take it to any number of local establishments, enjoy Happy Hour in Tempe without having to worry about a DD, and get myself to Chase Field in the summer when its too hot to walk.  (I live close enough where driving there is just plain dumb, but the 20 minute walk in 110 degrees is too much)  Which brings me to my next point, don't smoke crack.  Well not that, (but seriously, don't smoke crack) but I fully intend on using it in the summer.  I can endure standing outside for 10 minutes....if I can endure waiting for the T in a Boston winter, 10 minutes in a Phoenix summer is nothing. (And this will be my 3rd summer here so spare me the "you don't know the summer" lecture).
 
The 11pm end time does kind of suck, but it was 12 in Boston so its not terribly shocking for me.  It means you may have to take a cab home.  Of course livery regulation leaves much to be desired in this city but that is a different review entirely.
 
Now, I do think they could start to sell advertising inside, both for revenue and to give me something to look at.  I do wish the route maps were in better locations throughout the cars.  Placing them only in the middle means a large number of people (oh, like the entire rest of the car...) can't see them.  I also think the hand rails are awkwardly shaped.  The bike racks drive me nuts but I understand their purpose. 
 
But all in all I think it's a good start.  I'm happy to have it- I find it easy to use, clean, quiet and it gets me to where I want to go.  I would like some wifi for when I'm working on my laptop but hey, I'll take what I can get.

Oh my goodness! Oh my goodness! These burgers are delicious! 

I absolutely love burgers! My wife heard about this place and decided to take me here. I love her! We went on a Friday night and the place was packed! We had a 25 minute wait but it went by quick. (thank God for Angry Birds!) So the hostess came and took us to our booth. FYI walk slowly or you will bust your ass. Their floor is extremely slippery. I don't know if there's grease on the floor or what. 

We looked over the menu and started off with the Berry Lemonade and the Bourbon BBQ Sriracha Wings. They were both delicious! Next we both had the Standard Deluxe Burger. It's a burger with White American Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion and their House Burger Sauce. It was huge and outstanding! The homemade potato chips are really good also. 

I also like the fact that you can build your own burger in 7 steps . 

Step 1. Pick your burger. 

You have a choice of beef, chicken, bison, sausage, lumb crab or veggie patty as a burger. 

Step 2. Pick your bun. 

Next you pick your bun with Brioche, Wheat, Baguette, Focaccia, 
Topless or Full Monty Style as choices 

Step 3. Pick your rub. 

Choose from Angel Dust, Kona Crust, BBQ, Kingston Jerk, 
Cracked Peppercorn and Bayou Cajun 

Step 4. Pick your cheese for $1 more 

Choose from Cheddar, White American, Horseradish Cheddar, 
Sharp Provolone, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella, Smoked Gouda and Buffalo Cheddar. 

Step 5. Pick your sauce. 

Choose from Bourbon BBQ, Dijon Mayo, Banana Ketchup, House Sauce, Spicy Marinara, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Roasted Garlic Mayo, Sriracha Remoulade, Buttermilk Ranch, Spicy Ketchup, 
Whole Grain Mustard, Avocado Wasabi, Bleu Cheese Dressing, 
Buffalo Sauce, Relish and Chipotle Sour Cream 

Step 6. Pick a topping for $1 more. 

Choose from Fried Egg, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Avocado, Chicken Chili, Caramelized Onion Marmalade, Grilled Pineapple, Sauted Mushrooms, Maple Cured Ham, Onion Straws, Roasted Tomatoes, Grilled Onions, Brandied Peppercorn, Cabernet Sauce and Roasted Red Peppers. 

Step 7. Pick a free topping. 

Choose from Iceberg, Romaine, Field Greens, Baby Spinach, 
Arugula, Red Onion, Tomato, Poblano Peppers, Cucumbers, Banana Peppers, Bread & Butter Pickles and Jalapenos. Lots of choices and ways to customize your burger. 

Burgatory is my new favorite burger place!

Amazing.

Small and intimate, it's a delightful place.  A place to make new friends, be in a friendly and relaxed environment, and feel like something special.

Tip #1: You must make reservations.

Tip #2: Text the phone number.  Name, # in your party, and the date/time.  You will be texted a confirmation with instructions.

Tip #3: You enter thru the Commonwealth club.

Tip #4: Await further instructions, but the entry is not thru the locked freezer looking door.

Greeted by a beautiful and elegant girl, she was in a silver and black form-fitting dress.  She took my friend and I into a small room, explained what was going to happen, and then opened another door to let us in.

Wonderful ambiance.  A small bar that seats 6, chairs with a counter along the wall, and 4 tables with chairs.  Really intimate.  Chandeliers, wooden doors as a ceiling, and features the coolest bathroom ever.

Daniel came over and explained the little booklet of drinks, but that he would make anything we wanted.  Note: they don't have any beer or wine, but things with cocktails and spirits is the name of the game.  Flavored popcorn was great (and free!).

We sat at a table for awhile, and mosied over to the bar -- much better.  Made new friends, and got to know Daniel -- which was a treat.  A very likeable and talent guy.  Albeit he has limited space to work with.

At 10pm or so on Wednesdays, they have a piano player who is wonderful.

Truly fantastic.  It's a must.

Hey @KFC, I'm convinced that this is the worst KFC in Vegas, if not the world. Look at how many one star reviews this location has! I should have checked with Yelp to spare myself from the horrendous meal I just experienced.

For the record, I don't cheat on my diet often but when I do, I expect it to be both good and worth it. Not too much to ask for I don't think. After trying to go to another restaurant only to find out they were closed due to a family emergency, I wound up here. And now I'm so grossed out so much that I think I'm never coming back.

Don't go to this franchise! Whoever owns this place must be cheap and prefers to scam people instead of doing the right thing. Rather than saying they're out of gravy, they instead presented me with gravy that was the consistency of water and tried to pass that off as the real thing.

May I present you with Exhibit A? https://vine.co/v/MxbPj22t6Pl

Your honor, I rest my case.

As a last resort, I tried it hoping that at least the flavor was still there but unfortunately my gut instinct was correct. Indeed it was watered down gravy along with watered down flavor. Or maybe a disgruntled employee took a whizz in it. Who knows?! All I know is that it was disgusting! My wondering about what I had just ingested ruined my whole meal & appetite for a long time. As a result, I didn't finish eating and threw everything away. A complete waste of money as well as calories!

The manager, Jesus, was unhelpful and didn't seem to care. Overall an awful fast food experience that probably has ruined me for KFC for life. It was so bad that it inspired my very first negative fast food review. Congrats guys... this 1's for you!

The thing about clubs is that they can be hit or miss, depending on what night you go, and what the crowd is like. Fortunately for me and my girls, we went on Sunday night when they place was popping off and we met some really cool people.

First off, the staff is incredibly nice. As we walked up the corridor toward The Bank, we were approached by a promoter who got us to the front of the line (like I've mentioned before, it helps to know the promoters), and then we were greeted by the manager, who was very welcoming. The security guards are some of the sweetest I've ever encountered anywhere. I'm talking about the guys who provide security for the VIP tables on the floor. PRESTON IS THE MAN! Not only did he escort us to the women's restroom and back through the crowd, but he also made sure to scare away any shady looking dudes. We totally felt safe. And it wasn't even our VIP table!

The DJ was spinning hip hop beats - EVERYONE in the club was dancing. The space is not very big, and in fact, you feel pretty boxed in because of the rectangular multi-level layout. But that just forces you to get cozy with everyone, and for the most part, the people we encountered were pretty cool.

Every now and then they'll do a special birthday shout out that includes hot dancers and huge sparklers, and blast foam snowflakes from the ceiling. 

It was the perfect spot to end our last night in Vegas. Will definitely be back on a Sunday night!

Kj is probably the best dim sum spot in Vegas. I can say that for a fact. After dining here, and other dim sum restaurants in town, Kj is the only one I regularly return to. This also ranks up there with some of my favorite restaurants in the city.

After sitting down, I recommend that everyone orders the hot tea. It's not complimentary, I think it's like 3 or 5 dollars, but it's unlimited refills, and nothing goes better with dim sum than hot tea.

So there are carts rolling around the place that are loaded with goodies that you can just pick and choose which dishes you want. Definitely if you are going here, I would recommend ordering the har gow (shrimp dumplings), shumai, pork bao, and coeng fan (rice noodle rolls). And, save some room for dessert, their egg custard tarts are fantastic, as well as their green tea and taro buns. But, always be open to trying new things, that's the key to dim sum.

Not everything I thought was stellar. First, the XLB or "soup dumplings" are not very appetizing. There is hardly any broth inside, and it's basically all wrapper. And, the char siu baau is pretty average, with it tasting more of sauce, rather than pork. And sometimes another issue I have, not all the dim sum are piping hot, which I feel should be.

Overall, this place is really great, with the positives greatly outnumbering the negatives. Some people have told me that this place is comparable to some of the best dim sum spots in cities that have a large dim sum presence. I believe them because I really like this place, and will continue to come back here!

This is Michael Mina at his casual best!  An American pub;  Skeptical poker buds and I walk in ready to be insulted but were pleasantly surprised.  Straight to it, the food.

Remember, Mina is a master of seafood; namely lobster so...

There back!  Lobster corn dogs.  Incredibly sweet chunks of perfectly cooked lobster in a crispy, fluffy, semi sweet corn dog coating with a tangy whole grain mustard and crme fraiche.  Simply put, good eats.

Other starters such as the duck spring rolls with ginger chili dipping sauce, mint and cilantro (excellent with the earthy flavor of moist duck accented by a decent "Asian" dipping sauce that brings forth the flavor of the oily duck meat and a great, light, crisp tempura or maitake mushrooms in a soy, scallion dipping sauce are excellent.  As with all Mina's restaurants, try what sounds different.  While not authentic Asian, still very good flavors.

For larger plates, the Lobster roll with jalapeno creamed corn is excellent.  It's not Northeast authentic but who cares.  Rich, perfectly cooked lobster in a crisp, buttery roll surrounded by a very spicy creamed corn.  The flavor of the jalapeno brings a rich chili taste that contrast well with the sweet, cold water lobster.  The Korean BBQ salmon burger is also good eats.  Soy marinated, cooked medium, and accompanied by cucumber kimchi and ginger aioli is incredibly well balanced.  Complex texture.  Simply delicious.

Great pub style service.  Friendly and correct.

Nice selection of craft cocktails and infusions.  Solid but not too creative beer list.  OK wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.

A worthy replacement for Seablue.

Being a Yelper, I have anticipated my visit to Pizzeria Bianco for over a year.  I finally got the opportunity to go to night!  Fellow Yelper from Houston, Ryan, was in town for work again and invited me out.  We met up at the wine bar next door and got a cheese plate.  Three different kinds of cheese, all really good and tangy!  The thin bread the came with was a bit too crunchy to eat with cheese on it, but tasty nonetheless.  Finally, after a two hour wait, we were called!
We're in!  I'm going to Pizzeria Bianco!!!!
We had a really nice waiter.  He was there when we needed, didn't hover at all.  We started with a couple appetizers.  I had a prosciutto-wrapped melted cheese on a skewer.  There is nothing better in this world than melted cheese!  The skewers were served on a bed of "micro-arugula" and drizzled with olive oil.  Soooooooooooooo yummy!  
We ordered two pizzas to share: The Wiseguy and the Biancoverde.  The Wiseguy had sausage and caramelized onions on it.  Really good!  The Biancoverde, though, was even better.  Three different cheese and again, the micro-arugula.  I'm not a crust person.  I ate the parts with the toppings, but not the edged.  I never do.  The crust was thin and had soaked up some of the natural grease that comes with melted cheese.  Definitely got a wet spot from it!  
I'm full.  I'm exhausted.  I had had a strange and mildly crappy day, and this made it worthwhile.
I'll be back.  To me, definitely worth the wait!  I only wish my Buffalo sister, Jennifer, could have had such a good experience before leaving the Valley.

The Skinny: foodie porn for the fine dining crowd at extremely reasonable prices... and when I say reasonable, I mean it's almost f%$king ridiculous (5) service: excellent personal service, my only gripe was that they probably need to fix the price labels on some of the shelves because they are outdated (invariably cheaper than the listed price though!) (5), Value: Stocking truffles, Iberico ham, preserves, all the little doodads to convert your kitchen into a molecular gastronomy lab? Absolutely priceless. (5!)

We've been meaning to come here for a while after reading about this store in a news article many months back. We heard that they obtain the best of the best exotic items for all the fine dining establishments in town. When we saw a livingsocial deal, we totally jumped on board to check what this place is all about.

When I walked in I was impressed. I mean when you look around store, there are massive paper bags with labels like "Guy Savoy" on them waiting to be delivered.

I wouldn't say this is your ordinary grocery store by any means so leave your grocery list at home. They stock hard to find items like fresh wasabi root, vanilla beans from like 4 different countries, exotic anchovies, olives, oils and vinegars. Not to mention, duck breasts and foie gras piled high in the refrigerator. Up on the shelf, they also had an array of different additives (like agar,etc.) used in a molecular gastronomy kitchen. Have a sweet tooth? There are a large variety of gourmet organic preserves, honeys and spreads.

Best of all was their charcuterie selection. OMG! They stock Iberico ham... as in the whole freaking leg. Iberico ham is the pride of Spain and is arguebly one of the finest hams in the world. The heritage organic pigs gorge themselves on acorns during the fall season, permeating their fat with delicious sweet nutty flavour. After curing for two years, voila! it's now here at this awesome little shop.

Ordinarily, at a restaurant, a couple ounces will set you back $40. Here, try $39 a pound (you have to buy like a 5 pound slab though). Luckily for their retail customers, they have little 2 oz. packages which will only set you back $7.50 (although it is the tenderloin portion... a little less fatty than the leg meat but still!). Is this a deal or what?

They also carried a variety of truffle butters. Normally, at Whole Foods a small 3oz container will set you back over $10. Here, it's only $4.65. Say what? you heard me... more than half freaking price!

We also tried some organic, pectin free, sugar free gourmet jam (wild currant, fyi) for a $5.80.

Artisanal Foods, where have you been all my life? I think I'm in love. 5 starred review.

I came to grab dinner at this Japanese restaurant with fellow Yelper Kurdy S, and the experience was a big disappointment. I was initially impressed by the sleek, horizontal interior that included an outdoor patio, sushi bar, bar area, and a long stretch of booths and tables. The restaurant was relatively quiet considering the small and large groups of families that were dining there. They also have a few TVs for those eager to keep track of games and scores.

We ordered the Toyko Frites ($7) that came with shoestring fries sprinkled with seaweed and served with honey jalapeno and spicy aioli dips. The fries tasted rather ordinary and plain. The dips were very simplistic without hints of complexity. I don't think I would pay that much for fries to go with mayo-siracha dip. 

The Assorted Sushi Platter ($18) came with eight pieces of spicy tuna roll, and nigiri that included unagi, ika, sake, tai, maguro, white fish, and ebi. The fish selection was ordinary and on the cheap side. The flavors were rather bland with dry spots, and I thought the red snapper had already turned. 

I was particularly offended by my order of Ikura ($6) that was served half done! Apparently, the sushi chef had run out of salmon roe. He then had the audacity to serve a half way done Ikura and told me that I would be charged half the price for it. Presentation and precision are such a big part of the dining experience in Japanese cuisine. The restaurant should have let me know about this in advance and ask if there is anything else that I would rather have in its place. My face turned as red as the maguro when the order arrived at the table. I had the server to take it off the bill.

Service was grounded in Western paradigm and not very thoughtful at all. Prices were too inflated and the quality from food to service was sub par. I left in disappointment and will never want to come back here again.

Check-in: SLOW! even more than 5 counters were opened, still had to stand in line for a while. 

Self-Park: FAR! from the front desk. Feel like parking in different hotel? 

Room: High tech~ Once open the door with the key card, TV will turn on, lights will turn on and curtain will open by itself. Very cool~ Remote control pad on the night stand, so convenience. You can control TV, lighting, temperature, music, curtain, etc. Many outlets in the room, perfect to charge many electronic at the same time. 

Mini-Bar: The fridge is completed packed with the drinks they are selling. If you move it, they charge you because all sensors. They are charging $50 service fee per day if you use their refrigerator to store your own item??? I thought refrigerator is part of the amenities in the room?? 

Nowadays, more & more hotel recharging "resort fee". Aria is charging $25 daily which includes access to Fitness Center and WiFi through out the hotel.

It is an indeed a beautiful 5 stars hotel in Las Vegas. Many great restaurants in the hotel as well. 3 great restaurants have happy hour menu from 5-7pm. Very good price~

I got a promotion rate, $106 per day + $25 resort fee. They gave me $50 daily credit... yes, spend it all on FOOD!!

I have been coming to this location for a couple of months now. It's convenient when I am working in the area or meeting up with family at a nearby dog park. I love that there is a drive-thru. The inside appears clean and the staff is not only friendly, but they remember regulars and make time to say hello to my dog, Brownie when she happens to be in the passenger seat. Brownie also loves the free "Puppuccino" they give her! You can ask for one of those for your fur baby at any Starbucks. Inside as well the drive-thru can be long at times, but it moves along smoothly most of the time. My drinks have been made right and the bakery items I've tried have been fresh, quick and convenient on the days I only have a short break. This Starbucks is in a small trip mall and the parking can be tight as well pulling in/out of the lot can be a bit frustrating with the congestion of cars in it sometimes. 

If you aren't apart of the Starbucks rewards program yet you frequent Starbucks, it would be smart to sign up. I get a free coffee on my birthday along with freebies throughout the year based on my purchases and stars earned. After 12 stars you get any free food or beverage item! I go to Starbucks anyway so this is just a way to earn something back on something I'm going to purchase anyway. I also buy the coffee in the store and can enter star codes online from some of those products as well. They also e-mail you when they have a "star dash" promotion or any other promotion going on.

Pre-fixe single menu + 12 seats. I'm not uber head over heals in love but Omae serves some pretty good stuff. Plus, it's so affordable it's worth at least 1 visit, maybe 2, or 3--really it depends on the menu. Speaking of menus... Omae, please. I generally don't carry a magnifying glass with me. USE NON-SCRIPT FONT LARGER THAN 4pt. My personal suggestion, Helvetica. A classic.

I've been here twice on two different menus. Each had a chilled soup, a vegetable course + an entree. The chilled soups here are phenomenal. If you've never had a soup cold, this would be an excellent place to start and acclimate yourself. They're vegetable based, creamy, and amazing. One had an egg custard on the bottom which was phenomenal.

The 2nd course always leaves something to be desired. Not bad just not special. Visit #1 consisted of a deconstructed shrimp salad. It was a miniature vegetable plate with a prawn for substance. Visit #2 was a half of a carmelized onion w/ miso paste. Tasty but just eh. 

Here's where your meal is either worth it, or not. If you're ordering Omurice as your entree, you just got ripped off--badly. If you order something more substantial, i.e. Ramen. It's 100% worth it to eat here. Omurice = Fried rice wrapped in egg. I've had many a fried rice(s) and Omae does not make the best. If you need fried rice in your life, holla and I'll steer you in the right direction. There was also a Wagyu burger on the menu which, while tasty, was not all that special. Personally, I''ve found that the ramen is a guaranteed delicious time as well as the only way to get your money's worth. I've had chicken and pork based ramen here and they were both excellent. Don't let a chicken-based broth frighten you. It's much richer than it sounds. They also have thicker, chewier noodles. woo.

Call and make a rez.

WOW!!! what a disappointment! 
I was so excited to visit BFS --- i work 6 jobs... double and triple days... so my body really needed this massage.
Came last night at 11pm to do an hr session. With my schedule 11pm yesterday was the only time that worked best for me.
I was hoping for a women but a man walked in my semi private room...
everything started out great...
he start on my head... worked his way to my arms... then to my feet and legs...
I didn't know what to expect so I let him do his job...
This is where things started bad... he worked his way up my thighs then his hands slipped under my panties...
At first I thought it was a mistake... then he opened up the inner part of my legs and stuck his hand in 2 more times! I closed my legs upset... then he threw the towel back over my legs and went back to my feet.
He was rough the whole time! At the end of my massage... he pressed his fingers deep into the top of my spine pressing hard and deep into my bones... so hard and long that I woke up with my back feeling bruised!
I gave them $40 and they didn't want to give me any change since they were already done counting their money for the day. After my bad experience I didn't want to leave a tip... but everyone was in the front lobby giving me the creepiest looks so I didn't want to complain. It was such an uncomfortable feeling/experience.
I'll never go back!
Best Foot Spa! shame on you!

Hated it.
Yes, it was cheap. Yes, it's centrally located. Yes, it's disgusting.

A couple of friends and I went for a turn around trip to Vegas for the night. We knew we weren't going to spend that much time in the room because we were there to eat and play some tables. Who knew that we weren't going to spend that much time in the room because we didn't want to be in it? Granted, yes- it was off season and we only spent $15 for the room- but I wish I would have spent $15 more to stay at one of the nicer hotels. We were being cheap, and we paid for it.

I knew it was an older hotel, but come on... a little updating (and cleaning) wouldn't hurt, would it? Being on the main strip next to all of these other nicer hotels, you would think they would try to up their amenities a little. At least run a steam cleaner over the effing carpets.

It took forever to find the check-in from the garage. There was a place that looked like a front desk, but wasn't really a front desk? A maintenance person had to tell us where to go. Check-in was fun, too. The lady pulled out a map that looked like something from an Indiana Jones adventure and proceeded to draw our route to the room. We were really confused when we had to exit the hotel to get to our room. WTF. There was a separate section that resembled a Motel 6 from the 70's. That's where our room was.

Upon opening the door, we were greeted by more dilapidated furniture, stale air and heavily stained carpet. Either someone had a crazy orgy in here before us- or there was a homicide. Needless to say- I waited until I got home to shower and I refused to take off my shoes.

Yes, it's cheap. But spring a little more for a nicer room regardless if you're just there to party. I'd hate to wake up face down on that carpet.

If anyone has ever seen the Korean drama Coffee Prince, then you'll really enjoy Serenade. Everything about this place reminds you of a coffee shop in Korea from the atmosphere to the employees, minus the fact that you're in a dry, hot desert.The place itself is very cute with a tiny stage (I'm assuming they have live music) at a corner and the coffee area at another. There are seats outside also if it ever gets crowded. I came on a Sunday afternoon and the place was actually quite empty. I was greeted by 2 male baristas (very good looking might I add) and they were very patient in answering my questions. I'm definitely not an expert on coffee so I went with a iced green tea latte. I noticed that their menu included some dessert items (cakes, waffle), teas, juice/smoothies, and also bingsu aka Korean shaved ice so I'll definitely be back for those. The barista seemed very knowledgeable in preparing my green tea latte (I think). No chunks of powder or anything (ahem like Starbucks) and the matcha taste was very strong. The price was about $4.50 which is a little high but I would pay that for the atmosphere. Overall, this is a great place to come by and hang out with friends or even bring a date. They open until 2am in the morning for those who are still up and need a caffeine fix.

This place seems somewhat hidden behind McChevron. Walking in we were greeted and given a chance to glance over the menu. The food is made fresh to order and they have a free salsa and veggie bar. Priced just under $3, I ordered a "Cheese Quesdalilla" and a "Fried Beef Taco" for around $2. Can't say I was a fan of the quesadilla. The tortilla tasted store bought and the cheese was lacking and had a somewhat pasty texture. The fried beef taco wasn't bad actually, but the chicken taco at Roberto's, grease and all, is by far better and larger in size. They have plenty of tables inside and you can call your order ahead of time too. The employees were very nice and inside was clean, but with other nearby options for lunch that I have enjoyed more and this place tasting average or just under, I can't see coming back.

New hot spot alert! Buddha Belly Deli! You're gonna find sandwiches like Pho Dip and Chicken Katsu Club here!  Sandwiches, flatbreads, salads, and sweets with an Asian Fusion twist! 

This place is still in the early stages of their soft opening but they are open for business and ready serve up some good eats.
 
I was super stoked when I was reading the temporary menu laid out on the counter.  Love that they have gluten free and some vegan choices like housemade Taro and Potato Chips with Furikake seasoning.

I ordered 9th Island Potato salad as my side to go with the Char Siu Pork Roll. I also got to try a basket of Taro and Potato chips.  My sandwich looked so pretty and was pretty dang good too! It had marinated pork shoulder and these kimchee pickle slices. .the Hawaiian roll was made inhouse. The chips were super thinly sliced. The potato in the potato salad was cooked to perfection, not too crunchy or mushy. Love the medley of Asian seasonings and spices used in all the dishes. 
 
Staff is really cool and friendly. It's Chef Clint and Mark I bugged that day. They are two of the 3 owners I met. Both are the creative geniuses behind the Ono (Yummy, Good) eats! Judging from Thai Tea and 5 spiced Carrot cupcakes I tasted, Mark is a bakery whiz too! Oh wow, someone is going to gain a Buddha belly here for sure.
 
This visit was into their second day of soft opening so they still are in the process of setting up. The sign on the storefront is up but storefront tinted windows are still bare and give no indication that there is a cool place residing there. The previous place was East Coast Eats..right in the strip mall where Kohls is.  They did a good job with the reno so far. Not much to more to comment on yet till after a few more visits. 

Grand opening is next weekend I believe. 4.995 for now!  I know I'll be back before then and update this review soon. So excited! And you will be too!

After the last time of going to Cosmo and having my dog attacked by a dog who's owners couldn't control it, I didn't think I'd be back to the park (even though I had been plenty of times without incident) but I did go back this evening. 

I figured it had been about 6 months and I really do enjoy taking her. She loves it. I should have re-read my past review about telling myself I'd NEVER go back in the evenings. And here's why...

To be honest, I wasn't expecting anything bad to happen. My dog was having her usual fun time but within 5 minutes of entering, a small dog got attacked by a larger dog and all you could hear was crazy amounts of yelping and whining like the dog was being eaten. It was a horrible sound. The owner of the small dog started crying hysterically, running towards the dog, arms outstretched screaming like a banchee. Now, of course it's not her fault her dog is being attacked but she definitely was escalating the situation by acting this way. Don't any of these people watch The Dog Whisperer? Geez. :P Energy people. CALM, ASSERTIVE energy. Fuck, it's not hard.

So this fight between the two dogs is still going on. About 15 seconds into it, it turned into an all out brawl with 6 other dogs going ape-shit on this little dog and then each other. IAnd THEN, as if things couldn't get any worse...every dog in the park started running over to the scuffle. First thing I thought was, "It's time to get the FUCK OUTTA HERE!" 

The group of dog owners converged in the entry way to the park, apparently to talk out the situation, while hysterical lady kept crying. Some words were exchanged between owners & I decided it was time to excuse myself. Mind you, I had my dog leashed at this point. She was healing & completely under my voice command. I made her sit and stay at the gate, in front of all these people and their dogs. I went first and she followed, all on my voice commands. 

It made me feel like I accomplished something to have my dog under my control while there was complete chaos ensuing around me. 

If you can't even get control over your 10 lb. dog in most circumstances, please for the love of god, DON'T TAKE THEM TO THE DOG PARK. And if you don't have control of your 70 lb. dog, DON'T TAKE THEM TO THE DOG PARK.

Parents of children with disabilities, this is the museum for you. The staff here are very empathetic and understanding of their behaviors. For example, if you got an autistic kid who verbally stims, the staff won't tell him to be quiet. I'm giving LVNHM a 5-star review just based on how nice the staff is!!!

The admission fee is $10.00 for adults. I know that most yelpers dropped out of school, and $10 is a lot of money to you guys, but maybe cut back on the Yonaka and Snowflake for a couple of days and you can finally save enough money to come here. Hey, you might even lose some weight so you no longer have to take pictures of yourself at those odd angles where they can't see your body. I'm kidding..I'm kidding...Just busting your balls again. But, LVNHM does participate in a program that allows anyone with a BOA debit card in for free twice a month! So you can keep your Taiwanese shaved ice, bring it here to LVNHM, and eat it in front of the animatronic dinosaur. (note- btw I'm an Art of Flavors guy)

I brought the same kid from my review of "Tony's Container Park" here. He liked this place a lot better than Tony's park for 2 particular  reasons: 1st they didn't stigmatize him and accuse him of being one of the homeless children that live downtown. 2nd, there were no hipsters.

At 2pm we get to feed the sharks, and they even got those blind cavefish that can see things through their other senses. There is also a turtle, a big snake, and a scorpion.  And on the bottom floor they got Double Deck Blackjack, 15 slot machines, video poker and a full bar. Yes, bring all your nerdy Asian yelp friends over here, since you guys never understand sarcasm for some reason...

Since Christmas is coming up they decorated this place really  nice. They also put up a bunch of Hanukkah decorations. This is probably the best time to come. 

On weekends they close real early, so please after your next UYE at Poppy Den, skip Johnny Fontanes for one night and don't stay out till 5 am drinking. But, if you do spend all night drinking, remember to drive really fast because it decreases the amount of time you spend on the road, which equals more sleep! I'm a well educated gentleman so take my advice as fact.

Every time I drive by this place, I get a little thrill down my spine. MMMM! 
Where else can you go to experience a bit of heaven between two soft pieces of bread? 
I met Mr. Hottie and Foodie Bear for lunch one afternoon at Los Reyes. I will say that I'm not a HUGE fan of sandwiches, but when it's free, what the heck? I walked in to the strip mall establishment and was met by the aroma of grilled onions and meat! So far, so good! 
Once seated, I found my eyes wandering around the menu and wishing I could eat everything on it! 
After sipping on a delicious horchata, and pondering the menu, I decided on the Torta el Rey which means "torta that has everything but the kitchen sink in it" (loosely translated)! This AMAZING sammie came with breaded thin beef steak, ham, chorizo, fried egg, cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and jalapeno! This is CERTAINLY not something you want to feed a family member who is at risk of kicking the bucket due to heart or kidney issues. Consider yourself warned. I will say that if you eat this sandwich, you are bound to fall in love with it. It's a dangerous, forbidden love, but a love you will cherish nonetheless. 
One of the issues I have with sandwiches is the bread. In previous experience, the tortas that I ate had terribly boring bread, or bread that was way too hard. Los Reyes' bread was yummy! It was grilled and and crusty, but not so crusty that you cut your mouth or it's too hard. The ingredients of the torta were all well made and delicious. Everything was HOT where it needed to be and cold and fresh where that needed to be! Perfecto! 
So why is that 5th star missing? I want to head back to try another torta to be sure of a 5 star rating! 
Looking forward to it!

I'm having Vegas withdrawal and writing a late review to ease my post-trip depression!

Wow! XS has got to be one of the best clubs with gorgeous colors and exquisite decoration! I was super electrified to step in and got a chance to party at one of the best clubs in my entire life just right here at Las Vegas. Very lavish, strikingly beautiful with astounding atmosphere. It's a clubbers' dream to party up here at XS! You've gotta venture up here to complete your Vegas trip. 

My highlights:
- I stayed at the Encore on Halloween weekend, which this club is situated in, which was SUPER CONVENIENT! It was literally only a few minutes walk from our room. 
-Beautiful women everywhere from all of the 7 continents around the world. 
-Ladies, go dip your feet into the shallow pool to wade on. 
-No designated drivers needed if you stay at Encore/Wynn hotel. Go get wasted!
-No lines since we had VIP access due to our bottle service. Great bouncers! They do re-entries. 
-The music, EDM, dubstep-y, & hip-hop-ish. It was Kaskade DJ'ing on our Halloween night! I did not know who was our DJ lineup until I came in hella buzz knowing it's actually Kaskade playing.
-Our stunning $1,000+ table on a cabana with comfortable couch with cushions by the celestial waters! Seriously, GET A BOTTLE SERVICE! If you have money to blow for a table, get one. Gentlemen, ladies will come up to you like a magnet if you get a bottle service/table for them to sit next to you. Worth the investment. After all, it's Las Vegas and money ain't a thing! 

Negative aspects: 
-Expensive. Just be prepared to have money to blow! I saw a special Dom Perignon 6L bottle for $25,000! Oh my goodness. It's on their menu. We stick with the Hennessy Privileg, LOL.
- I didn't really order a drink from the bar since we had a table. I heard their drink is about nearly $20~ a pop!
-It can get crowded inside. Thank goodness we have a table outside by the pool so we have our own space and room to walk around! 

Do yourself a favor: dress to impress, drink up, dance the night away, and make it one of the most memorable night in Sin city.

An excellent Xmas day dinner!  This was upscale British pub food done really, really well.  I am already looking forward to the next visit. 

We chose to eat at the bar since a couple of basketball games were on.  That way we could also ask the bartender about their beer selection.  Our bartender let us sample a few and we ended up going with a pints of Innis & Gunn and Moa.  Those were $8.75 each but so was Pacifico and Corona so no point in going for stuff you can get anywhere else.   

The first entree was the "Dublin Brisket" which was set in a pumpernickel bread bowl.  The bowl was filled with hearty tender chunks of beef, cheese and sauerkraut that went well with the side of thousand island.  3 standard steak fries=1 fry here so you only get 4 of them which was enough.  

My wife wanted the "Shepard's Pie" and just hearing those two words gave me flashbacks of terrible school cafeteria mush, a poor man's English lasagna if you will.  But this was galaxies away from what I had in the past.  Savory was the word from the first bite.  Each spoonful filled with buttery mashed potatoes, carrots, peas and slow cooked beef and lamb.  A truly awesome dish that I would gladly have any cold weather day.  

We skipped all the good looking appetizers and small plates just to make it to dessert.  Everyone recommended the "Sticky Toffee Pudding" so that's what we had and it did not disappoint.  The perfect ending indeed.

It is really hard to believe that I have yet to write a review of The Lost Leaf. The Lost leaf used to be the place to be. I guess it still is. I love it anyway. Just not on a first Friday. Too many people on that night. I like it on a  Monday when Jiggle or Running from Bears might be playing a little something. Free jazz and there is no cover also. 

You wont find any fruity cocktail or smokey concoctions at this bar. Strictly beer and wine. I think they even have a few taps now. Love the craft selection. They have something for every beer drinker in phoenix. The wine selection is the tits as well. 

They don't serve food though so you should plan on eating before or after or not at all. There are a few good places around the way. And the bar tenders are super appreciative if you bring them tacos... hahaha. I like ending up here as we stroll through downtown Phoenix. Its not too casual but not too... stuffy (?) I guess. I can't find a word for it. But Its different. Its one of those places where you can make new friends and always run into a few old ones! Tells you who my fiends are... :D 

These bar tenders are my favorite though. Not to mention I found my love of craft beers 5/6 years ago at this very bar. So, it will always have a special place in my heart.

Sadly Al's Beef is gone but Fired Pie is a nice addition to the Northsight neighborhood!  

I came here today for a late lunch. There were no cars parked in front and the inside was cavernously and deserted. Fired Pie I've learned believes their market is providing "a fast, casual and customizable options for your pizza or salad desires. We use local brews, organic foods, cognizant of sustainability and the ..."  Yeah, yeah but do they make a good pie?  In a word, yes. 

This, in some ways, is the pizza world's answer to Jimmy Johns. In essences, "Pizza so Fast you'll Freak!"  LOL  They cook their pies in a wood fired 700 F degree oven, so they're done in less than four minutes. Nice!

The crust is ultra thin and the toppings are very good (see photos). I'm not sure if one individual 10" pie will satisfy you if you have a hardy appetite. But I thought it was very good and filling.  

I had the Tomato & Basil, which has the look of a Margherita pizza, but Fired Pie adds garlic and several types of cheeses for a nice taste.  

The cost was a fair $7.75 (not including tax) and seems like a good alternative to the sandwich/subs guys over near the 101 and Pima.  Specialty pizzas are $2.00 extra. 

So Three and half Stars+, A-Okay!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 42/100

I am HUGE lover of the city of Paris and anything related to it. My apartment is Paris-themed with Eiffel Towers, macarons, bonjour signs, etc. everywhere. I was disappointed that my boyfriend couldn't get us hotel reservations at the Paris Hotel, but after visiting it this past weekend, I was actually kinda glad that we didn't end up staying there.

This hotel looks beautiful on the outside. The huge Eiffel Tower, of course, is a smaller, fit-to-scale version of the real thing in Paris. The building with all of the rooms in it actually looks like many of the buildings in Paris. They also have the Arc de Triomphe which is quite a spectacle as well.

My bf and I came here to dine at Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant. Because of where we parked in the garage, we had to walk through a bit of the shops and restaurants to get to where Steak was located on the main casino floor. It feels as if you are roaming the streets of Europe, but nothing inside the whole shopping/restaurant area really screamed PARIS to me. It was just like European-esque, but not really Paris. Also, I felt kind of claustrophobic in there because although the Venetian and Caesars Palace have the same thing where you feel like you're walking in Europe and there's a fake sky ceiling above, I feel like the ones in Paris are much lower and it just felt...busy and stuffy. 

The smell from the restaurants was slightly nauseating. It gave me gross flashbacks of bad quality, overpriced Italian from Disneyland near Pirates of the Caribbean. That is super specific but it was not bringing back good memories for me. Kinda like the smell when you first start riding on Pirates and you pass by the Blue Bayou restaurant...hahaha.

Overall, this hotel just seems dated to me...and not really that big to accommodate large amounts of people. There was some sort of marketing convention going on while we were there, which made it even more busy and claustrophobic than usual. 

3 stars for a nice outer appearance, Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant, and having a good location on the strip!

I will never give this restaurant another dime as long as i live. 

I have spent countless hours and dollars here as well as refered many family members and friends here. The food is great, but the recent visits have been inexcusable. Friday night the place was semi busy but had 3-5 empty tables and about 8 open seats at the bar. We asked for a table and were told it was a 45 minute wait so we opted to sit at the bar, but were told there was a wait there as well. I told the hostess there were empty seats all over and asked if we should go somewhere else. She told me very annoyed that we could sit at the bar. Through out whole meal nobody else sat at the bar. I wonder who was waiting. 

Today i just returned for sunday brunch and was told there is a wait for a table, again plenty of seats open. So i said can i sit at the bar? She replied she was trying to keep those seats open "incase a large party comes in." i asked ok where can i sit prior to being told "just wait for a table." again i askes should i just go spend my money somewhere else? She then fumbled and said let me see what i can do. What can she do im thinking? What the hell there are open seats everywhere and nobody waiting and one of your best regulars wants ONE seat. Needless to say I walked right out.

In an economy where places are shutting down and losing their lease, id think you would hire nice and intelligent people. There are lots of over qualified people who need any job they can get. I dont know why i would spend my money somewhere where people are rude to me and incompetent. 

You lose, switch.

"I will remember these shrimp for the rest of my life."  This is what my mom said after tasting the bacon-wrapped shrimp at Wildfish.

I knew I had to come back for a full meal after swooning over the amazing appetizers at the Yelp Elite event.  So, when my mom came out to visit I had the perfect opportunity to prove that great seafood can be found in the desert.  Wildfish did not disappoint.

After consulting with our (super awesome) waiter Christian, we started off with two appetizers - the crabcake and the bacon-wrapped shrimp with goat cheese.  Both were just as fantastic as I remembered.  The crabcake is large and perfect for sharing and is served with a light remoulade sauce.  The shrimp come three to a plate, complimented with a small stack of light onion rings.  My mom really knows that I love her, as I declined her (feeble and halfhearted) offers to split the third shrimp with me!

The parade of deliciousness continued with the entrees - Roasted Sea Bass and Snapper Filet with Johah Crab.  Both were served with delicate sauces that enhanced, not overpowered, the flavor of the fish.  We shared a side of steamed asparagus with hollandaise.  All sides are served family-style and the portions are large but can be ordered in half sizes that are perfect for two.

5 star staff, 5 star food.  Overall it was a great experience in every way.

Despite being a bit of a sword fight (with a guy to girl ratio of about 5 to 1), XS was still a great club. It helped that I was with my wife and didn't have to compete with the testosterone throngs thrusting against brave ladies that venture onto the dance floor. The entrance fee on Monday night was cheap for XS standards at $30 for dudes and $20 for girls. But, we noticed that most single girls just got in for free if they looked hot with skimpy outfits. Olivia was jealous until I pointed out she was getting in for free (since I was paying ... ).

Once inside, XS was smaller than expected, but it still works. One major positive was the ultra clean bathrooms. The dance floor heated up about 15 minutes after we got there and we staked out a spot in the middle near the front. Morgan Page took over as DJ around 1:30 a.m. and then it became so packed you could literally not move to the beat without bumping others. Eventually you just kind of get used to the close quarters and people touching you on all sides. Hopefully, you'll know one or two of them.

If you don't get a table, there's no place to really relax except outside by the pool or squeezing in with another group. Because of the sausage-fest, ladies should have no problems making several friends. The bartenders were fast and made decent drinks. They ain't cheap, but you didn't go to XS to save money, right.

XS lived up to expectations and was a great way to dance off the Vegas buffet till the morning.

Simply amazing and completely fitting for a 500th review.  

I don't know that a more lengthy first sentence can do it any better. I'll spare you from the I went to Spain bullcrap, but I do know good Spanish dining on several different levels and Sol y Sombra overdelivers like a good night in the sack, and to help others this is completely worth the 30 mile drive north for Central Phoenix dwellers. 

If you walk away from this review with two tidbits, just know that the Tortilla Espanola (while basic-sounding and all) is the best $5 you will spend on a dinner. EVER.  With its huge impressive wedge appearance, it is more deliciously prepared and more filling than expected.  Also know that the wine list is lengthy and very comprehensive, but in an excellent way.  While I love Lola Tapas in Central Phoenix for its urban and sophisticated simplicity, this is one area in which it can't compete.

While the evening was more delightful because of our mailing-list 50-percent-off skillz, it should be even more noteworthy that such a thing is possible if you get off your duffs and give a brotha your email. 

Among other highlights would be the Pollo Colonial (a savory mix of sweet and spicy chicken curry), Grilled Calamari, Spicy Garlic Aioli Grilled Prawns, Grilled Asparagus.  But the most surprising of the night were the grilled brussel sprouts.  WTF?  I don't even like that shit.  But they grilled them with garlic, olive oil and seasoning, and if you do it that way it is ten times better than any veggie a teen would hate.  The Patatas Brava were just ok.  I still ate them, but they were a little more crispy than I care for.

The setting was impressive.  The dining room is grand, stylish and luxe in its understated way -- so symbolic of Madrid.  The layout and colors are complementary, trendy and tasteful all at once.  The patio is incredible if you can swing it.  There is not a bad seat in the house as the views from the second floor at DC Ranch are all great.

The host was accommodating given we were 10 minutes late (and called ahead) and the servers and sommelier were definitely helpful and steered us toward the right white wine we wanted for taste and value without trying to do the whole upselling crap.  The wine was excellent and was so fragrant and inviting that Melissa's purse had to have a taste.

Sol y Sombra is a definite five star destination restaurant that is worth it if you're coming from Central Phoenix, West Valley or SE Valley.

I went with another company when I first moved to Vegas and it was weird! One day the guy disappeared off the face of this earth and never showed up again. Didn't call, send me anything, never to be heard from again! Soooo... Yelp failed me on that one and it was back to the drawing board again. That's when I found Pitbull Pest Control because of all the great reviews they have on here.

Chance is the name of the guy who does my exterminating with Pitbull and he's great! Very thorough, always wearing a smile. He shows up on time like clockwork once a month. 

A little while back, there were black widows near the mailboxes and I got worried because I have 2 little dogs that I really care about. I was scared because I heard that when those spiders start multiplying they do so quickly and someone said that they could start hiding out in my bushes. I envisioned my dogs getting too close and getting bitten which would kill them and no way I'm gonna let that go down! Not on my watch! 

I called up Pitbull Pest Control and the next day they sent someone out free of charge to spray that area. Great company! 

I love that they have the organic stuff that they can spray on the inside and that all of their stuff is pet-safe. They have been my pest control company of choice since a little after I first moved to Vegas thanks to my discovering them on Yelp and I've yet to have an issue other than the black widow thing. And that wasn't even on my actual property line so technically it was nothing wrong that they did and not their fault. I'm just guilty of being an overprotective dog mommy and decided that you can never be too careful. I'm thankful they still obliged me. And for that I give them 5 stars. 

Plus, now that I can officially count on them, my abandonment issues I had from the last people up and vanishing have gone away. No years of therapy needed. Haha! Dr. Death was his name... I still wonder to this day if that dude died or something. So strange!

We came here last evening to celebrate our anniversary and we had a great time.  

Sure, it was 106 and we had to sit outside, but the food as always, was great, outstanding and delicious. Now where's my Roget's?  Just read my original review from last year. 

And, who would sit through a cool Arizona evening (LOL) as we did, on our anniversary, if the food wasn't delicious?  

We have tried almost everything on the menu, the fish taco, the shrimp, the Carne and everything is good.  But we comeback for the Carne Asada.   You've got to try it!  Their tacos are very good, but we much prefer the Burritos and highly recommend their white sangria. 

Expect to spend about $25 each for a three course meal including drinks, excluding tip. BTW, those are Happy Hour prices, which run until 6 pm including on Saturdays.  Most items on their menu are $1-3 off.

So Four and a Half Stars, up from Four.

Enjoy!

If there's a place in old town that you can rely on for quality in food and service, this is the place.  You get what you paid for.  Based on my last few visits, it seems to always be busy, which as you know is a great sign.  

This is a place where you come for a date, birthday or just about any type of occasion you can think of.  

These are what I consistently get and enjoy:

+ Chopped Salad: BOMB.  You cannot come here and not get this.  If you don't have a big appetite, this is a must.  The corn, salmon and dressing does it for me every time.  You just can't go wrong here.

+ Lamb Burger: Its very tasty and juicy.  It can be a little messy if you mishandle it.  So I suggest just slicing it in the middle.  

+ Kale Caesar Salad: BOMB.  Kale is a super vegetable that is packed with nutrients.  They make the Kale anti-bitter with a great balanced Ceasar dressing, served with a cheesy, toasty bread! 

Some things can break your wallet but if you manage to try to share your plates in your party, you will walk out okay.  Drinks aren't too pricey.  But if you want to keep the night going, I suggest heading up to their sister bar, Citizen R+D, a speakeasy that is around the building and requires a secret phone call to reserve a table.

There's not much to complain about really.  For its consistency and quality, I will always have them on my go to places.

This is the most real review on GC here, so read on:

Guitar Center is a festering disease that needs to be stamped out.  It's the wallmart of music stores.

It is employed by world class douche nuggets that think, just cause they work at guitar center, that they have some type of credentials in regards to gear purchasing.  Being a professional musician myself, I try to stay away from GC at all times in order to maintain sanity.  

Reason 1
As a professional musician, I find that GC doesn't carry anything I would purchase other than drum sticks, gig bags, and miscellaneous items.  Never will I buy a drum set, for they do not carry sizes outside of the butt-rock/heavy metal spectrum.   Never will I buy a cymbal from there, for they have none that sound good, and if there is the chance that they may have an ok K zildj, it's monstrously overpriced.  They don't even carry the drum heads I use.

Reason 2
The douchebags.  The last thing I need when I'm coming in to pick up some sticks, or a hardware accessory, is dude telling me what he thinks I should buy.  Usually I try to be nice, but once in a while I have to go off.  Like:
"You should check out the Dennis Chambers Stick", says Guitar Center Douche.
"No thanks, I like those peter erskine ride sticks quite fine", me.
"I'm telling you, if you're doing Jazz, those Dennis Chambers sticks are the way to go.  I always use them when I play Jazz." Guitar Center Douche.
"Oh really, when's that, at your house at night, cause I've never seen you out at any of the clubs playing." Me.
"yeah, well I mostly play metal." Guitar Center Douche.
"Yeah, will I mostly play jazz, as my job, so don't try to upsell me on sticks." Me.

This reasons is echoed throughout every musician I hang with.  The most recent horror story was about my friend try to buy a PRS guitar from them that they accidentally sold while it was on hold for him.  The floor clerk had this to say: "Sorry about that dude, how about I go grab a strat of the wall for you."  If you play guitar, then you know someone shopping for a PRS probably doesn't need another strat, and you'd think a professional guitar salesman would know too. 

Reason 3
They treat their product like shit.  I don't know how many times I've heard of people getting drum sets, and the dude wheeling out a damaged box, saying the drums are fine, only to find the shells being damaged when they got them home.  Also, I've seen one of my buddies go through 4 different premier kits, because the shells were out of round.  The GC dude says it must be the boat ride, we called Premier, and they said they ship all their kits via airplane.  If you buy a guitar there, take it into a luthier immediately, because GC doesn't tech any of their gear, they just put strings on and hang it on the wall.

Reason 4
Guitar wanking in the store...  There's nothing that makes me want to beat my head into a wall more than 3 to 6 dudes demoing guitars playing Metallica licks really badly.  This also goes for really loud crappy drum solo guy and couldn't play a melody on keyboard piano dude.

Reason 5
Their Pro Audio section is the least pro I've seen.  It's like mid grade.  Poor mic selection too.

Reason 6
Their online service has much better selection, way better prices, and a better atmosphere.

I understand that all the good ratings are coming from people that don't have such a critical sense of musical gear, but this is understandable for weekend warriors and hobbyists.  As a professional musician, I stand behind local shops like Milanos, where one can get some personal service from a dude that really knows his shit about drums, and pay into the community rather than this megalithic Douche Center.

Yay! I just happen to be their 100th reviewer!

First of all, shame on me for not coming here sooner because they have been here at least a year and half in this nice location across from the Cannery Casino. Old School Pizzeria is just that. Old school. They make everything from scratch right in front of you. 

I ordered the Rosemary Garlic Knots and a Monster slice of The Carnivore. 

The Rosemary Garlic Knots were exquisite! I have had garlic knots before but these babies are now the standard I will judge others by. Let me describe it. Please have a bib or a napkin ready because you will be drooling. These are not your basic garlic knots. These knots are baked with actual rosemary leaves and real garlic cloves tossed in a light olive oil. I had them sit in the oven a little longer so it would make the outside even more crispy. When you take that first bite, it's comparable to one of those scenes you would see in any basic movie when somebody has a flashback and relives all those fun, awesome times, all in fast forward because by then that first bite is on its way to your stomach. Oh, and don't forget about the ranch dipping sauce that comes with it. Definitely did not come from a bottle. I assume they made it fresh because it was really creamy and made me want to drink it.

As for the monster slice of The Carnivore, the description is very fitting. If you refer to my pic, I put a pepper shaker right next to it so you can comprehend its dimensions. Now I have had good thin crust New York style pizza before, but this crust was SOURDOUGH! Now sourdough bread by itself I am into, but as the crust for the pizza? Stupendous! As you can assume by the name, it has all the meats they have available. From my recollection it had sausage, ham, chicken, pepperoni, and bacon. Usually when I get to the end crust, I just put it aside, but this crust was so good especially dipped in the ranch dressing, that it would make other sourdough bread jealous.

As an honorary mention, I gotta say that their bathroom is nicely decorated, clean, and has a fresh scent to it. It's so nice that I hope to God that none of those idiot hooligans jack it up with their sharpies and scratch things up. Memo to those low lifes: What kind of jerk are you to vandalize things and make it a sight for sore eyes? Anyways, sorry I kind of strayed off the beaten path there.

So now that you got this far in my review, I just want to reiterate one thing. Whatever you get here, make sure the Rosemary Garlic Knots is one of them. The pizza comes in a very close second because it compliments the former. Sometimes, you just gotta go old school! Old School Pizzeria that is!

Within the restaurants of a 5 mile radius from where I work, Detriot Coney is one of the most delicious, cheapest and offers the best service.  I went there for a dog but I saw someone eating a juicy burger so I changed my mind.  Drink, fries and a delicious cheeseburger for all under $8 bucks.  The person who took my order explained that my burger order number will be called out and then they will ask me what fixings I want "like subway" he said.  I thought that was a pretty cool feature and they had a nice selection of burger toppings.  The guy who cooked my burger, served it to me at my table and then cleaned up my table when I was done, what a superstar employee.  I'm giving this place 5 stars because it was clean, the service was awesome and the food was very delicious.  For a hot dog stand this place is a cut above the rest!

We took a trip
Sedona way 
For three hot nights
And four days stayed

On our way home
Stopped in Phoenix
Met Daniel L
Gladly he picks

Walked through the doors
Nice ambience
The air was cool
Booth seats ensconced

Caught up with life
Ate a nice lunch
Our menu picks
We loved a bunch

We ordered the Chopped Salad
Also the Pigstrami
We shared a cup of squash soup
At the end we were happy

You know
I'm glad!  I'm glad!  You know it! (really really glad)
You know
I'm glad!  I'm glad!  You know it! (really really glad)

If a Yelper! didn't get my message right now
I'm gonna say it once again

The word is out
Chopped salad great
Lickety split
This salad ate

Nicely plated
Light dressing poured
The flavor mix
We did adore

Shared cup squash soup
Seeds, raisins topped
Gulped spoonsful few
Yet hard to stop

Pigstrami good
Yet bit salty
Langer's sandwich
Is best to me.

The Gladly servers are trained well
Helpful, thoughtful, polite
In terms of the "lunch experience"
The Gladly was out of sight!

You know

By no means am I a soul food expert but if the dish is fried, covered in gravy or sauce or all the above then COUNT ME IN.

It was pretty busy when we walked in on a Tuesday night.  They had the soul classics blaring through the speakers while the Lakers were on TV with their new lineup was tanking it against the Mavericks.  So far, so good!

Their menu offered all the soul offerings you would expect like fried chicken, ribs, fried catfish and all the usual suspects for sides.  My wife opted for the smothered chicken ($14) which was fried chicken drenched in gravy.  That was excellent.  The gravy was really good but we would consider ordering fried chicken with a side of gravy so we could enjoy the crisp of the chicken which was nonexistent post smothering.  

I opted for the turkey wings ($14) which consisted of 2 big assed baked turkey wings smothered in gravy.  Even though the gravy was the same for both, they tasted quite different based on the preparation of the meat.  

You get 3 sides per entree unless you get chicken and waffles.  3 sides is more than enough and all the ones we tried were on point.  That included collard greens in some amazing sauce, delectably sweet sweet potatoes, red rice and beans with great sausage flavor and the mac+cheese.  The cornbread they gave was in pancake form and went terrific with syrup.

No free refills on drinks and they charge $1.50 for water so you might as well get sweet tea, Kool Aid or lemonade for $2.

Breakfast menu also looked damn good.  I'd like to try that out sometime too.

Shave ice and Vegas are a match made in heaven. After shopping in the area, I suggested to my fella that we get a nice cool treat. 

The place was pretty packed for Monday evening, so there was a bit of a line, but they seemed to be pretty organized and the wait wasn't too bad. They have an enormous amount of flavor options for shave ice, as well as smoothies and coffee drinks. I'm a fan of all the tart flavors they had and I even saw pickle flavor which I had heard about before, but wasn't brave enough to taste this time. I opted for the pink Sweetarts flavor and my fella ordered The Congo smoothie. I enjoyed the texture and presentation quite a bit. The umbrella was a nice touch. The flavor wasn't as tart as I would have hoped, but it really did taste like a Sweetart. The smoothie was nice as well. A little too much banana flavor for me, but my fella was loving it. 

The texture of the ice is really nice. It holds the flavor very well and despite the heat, it took forever to melt which is a plus for me since I tend to be a pretty slow eater when it comes to dessert or cold things. 

They have color-changing spoons that change color when they are cold, which is adorable. I'm definitely keeping it to entertain myself. I know it's a chain, but I love having a shave ice place that is indoors that is conveniently located. I'll be back for sure.

Jack Norworth wrote be best sports related song in 1908, coincidentally it was the year the Cub's won their last World Series Championship.  Does anyone remember the "The Baseball Polka"...no just like the 1907 World Series Championship.

Take me out to the ball game

Take me out with the crowd

Buy me some peanuts and Crackerjack

I don't care if I never get back

Let me root...root...root

For the Cubbies(remix version)

If they don't win it's a shame

For it's one...two...three strikes you're out

At the old ball game

Spring training facilities in the last few years in the metro Phoenix area have put out a few new stadiums and none topped the Salt River Fields (Rockies & Diamondbacks) until Cub's Park.  This park has so much seating which is great when you compare it to Hohokam Stadium.  Parking is so much better!  Oh yeah, they have tons of bathrooms.  

I was lucky enough to get a ticket to open day which was also the opening of the park.  I snapped a few photos that are attached to this review.  The stadium is beautiful.  It does have many cues that remind you of Wrigley Field.  If there is one thing that I could tell Tom Ricketts to add to this park, it would be adding a vinyl wrap that looks like a brick wall in the outfield around the advertisement to emulate Wrigley's outfield wall.

Food and Beer, check.  The thing that stood out, no pizza sold inside the park.  My apologies if I missed it.  Most people are pointing out that there is no Old Style sold.   I can go a few hours without to watch a game here.  The food is just the normal stuff you will find at most spring training stadiums.  The one feature that I find way cool is that you will find three food trucks parked on the right field side next to the Dos Gringos tent along with some picnic tables, nice touch!  Chicago deep dish pizza places take note, you could make a killing by just investing in a food truck and getting a spot here!

If you choose to buy a general admission ticket, there are many great views that are standing room if you do not want to tan yourself in the outfield.  Let me say again, tons of seating.  The things that are works in progress are minimal and not worth mentioning and know the Cub's have a winner here.  I hope they use this park for fall ball too.

One of the best sushi places I've had! Location is a little strange and out of the way but well worth it. Yelpers were spot on with their raving reviews of Goyemon. The inside was very nice and clean and didn't smell :) It was a packed house which is always a good sign of a great establishment. We sat at the sushi bar and Ivan, our sushi chef was amazing. Of course we ordered the AYCE. Loved the fact we can order 1/2 rolls so we could try lots of different items. The nigiri was the perfect bite size. We enjoyed the Hurricane, garlic tuna, masago with quail egg, and I also tried the 911...spicy habanero HELL! We made friends with nearby patrons & started sharing but none of them dared to try the 911. I couldn't feel my face after eating it, thank goodness for the nearby sugar packets to help put out the heat.
To finish our meal, lychee sherbet...refreshing and light.
Definitely at the top of our list for sushi.

GAAAAAAHHHHH!

What can I say that has not already been said? Well, I can point out the dude that said these guys are awesome and proceeded to give them 3 stars? Yeah makes sense right? I think he had them confused with Kuma! OH SNAP! There I said what EVERYBODY else is saying or is agreeing to once they try this place out.

Remember this review and the ones before it. Its only a matter of time before these guys explode on to the all natural dessert scene. The owners Will and Mike, I can compare them to Bill Gates and Paul Allen when they first started Microsoft. That's right folks, I SAID IT. These guys have that kind of potential. When you guys look back at this review, the song "We started from the bottom now we're here" will be playing again and again in your head. Heck, I am picturing you bobbing your head right now.

Ok so now for the default part of the review. Yes they have different flavors. Yes they take cards with a 30 cent transaction fee. That's cheap if you ask me. Yes they are in a small trailer. Yes you gotta go over the river and through the woods past your grandmother's house to get there. Yes their customer service is more like, "Hay buddy! How you doin?" like they have known you for years.

The bottom line is, if something is really good, people from all over will come. These guys are sitting on a gold mine and if they go public, buy their stock! Heck start filling out an application so you can be one of the first to work there and maybe become one of the pioneering members that helped started it all while making some serious frost bitten paper! 

So once you're done with this 5 star review, move on down to next 100 or so others that are 5 star, well except for that 3 star dude and keep this little snowball rollin until its so big, peeps will be like, remember Kuma? *starts laughing. This could possibly be the first business that will average 5 stars forever. 

Lastly I will leave you with this, "BRRR! IT'S COLD IN HERE! THERE MUST BE SOME FROST BITES IN THE ATMOSPHERE!"

If you are steak lover and visiting Las Vegas you must give this place a try. I had the honor of dining here with several friends. Wow! What more can you ask for as a steak lover. I have to say you are going to be paying a lot for your meat. It's worth it all the way. I used to be big fan of Mastor's until I came here. Hands down the best steak money can buy.

If you are a person who loves great meat and outstanding dishes. What more can you ask for as a steak lover.  It's worth it all the way. I used to be big fan of Mastor's until I came here. If you are from NY and love Keens Steakhouse in Manhattan then you need to long no place else.

I highly recommend the bone in filet to the 8 ounce Kobe steak. If you are looking for great starters I would get pink Fiji peach salad or the butter lettuce. For side dished I would highly creamed spinach and roasted Brussels sprouts. Leave room for desert. The banana cream pie or the baked Alaska pear.

Service 10+
Quality 10+

i'm giving turf 4 stars for now, i expect 5 stars will be on a follow up.

first time here and i have to say i already love the place, its within a 7 minute walk from my apartment and that is something i have been dreaming of since i first signed a lease. my only full bar options are Portlands (meh) and carley's (good god no!!) and the bikini (way too far to stumble home, and HIPSTER) and sidebar (close, but not really stumble home close). so here i am meeting my roomie for drinks after work, i walk in and wow. i expected allot worse from the reviews from John V and Pierre. 

let me correct the misconceptions, its not in any way empty space, yes it's not overly crowded (yet) but i had a mental picture of the brickhouse empty. it is nothing like that. the floor plan is laid out with seating for sit down comfort..split with a bar and tall bar sit up tables. i was also expecting barren walls. but from what i can tell there wasn't a barren wall in the building.

as far as pierre, i havn't trusted a review of his since i read his review of Sing High (god awful) so his interpretation of a dive bar is completely off. after reading his review i expected to walk into an updated classy newsroom..but was surprised to find a complete opposite. just a nice bar with a really friendly staff.

the seating at the bar is attractive green tweed swivel stools. (tweed..what is more irish then that?) adjacent to the bar is a comfortable seating area with leather arm chairs and high back booths. the prices are far below what i expected. 8 bucks for a sandwich and fries. completely acceptable. this is certainly going to be my go to bar. i expect many years of being trashed and being sweeped out the front door at 2am. 

turf thank you for opening, and thank you for the quaint patio for the smokers of the downtown area. much appreciated.

after i get my shit together, expect me here weekly, in fact i'll forward my calls to this place like Norm on cheers.



5 star review surely in the future. bless you.

oh and since i know you will read this, it was nice to meet you Melissa.

come on downtown yelpers, this WILL be the bar you are at on a regular.

***Inexpensive tables in a not-too-shabby casino; South Point also features the popular middle-of-the-country burger chain Steak & Shake***

South Point is a lower priced hotel and casino near the Las Vegas Strip (a lot closer to Vegas than Stateline or Whiskey Pete's).  The casino features a wide variety of gaming and had several restaurants on-site.  I saw a lot of advertising for Steak & Shake on the drive in and maybe because of that, the restaurant had a very long line.  This is the furthest west I've seen a Steak & Shake (I thought they came only as west as Texas).

The gaming tables are low with $3 minimum bets, but they dispense mostly $5 chips.  Still, your money can go longer here (and I was fortunate enough to win here on this trip).  For a Saturday afternoon, the casino had a good number of customers, but it was not too crowded.  Because of the smaller crowd, the smokiness of the casino was not too bad.

The staff was pleasant.  And maybe somewhat surprising (to me at least) was that the cocktail waitresses (at least on this visit) seemed more attractive than the ones I saw at the big Strip casinos that same weekend.

South Point is a good last gambling stop before heading back to Los Angeles.  For non-gaming Vegas activities, you are probably not going to find much of that here.  For food, I am not familiar with a lot of the options (they may just be bad hotel restaurants) so you should probably try Steak & Shake first.  Good or bad, it will give you an opportunity to try a steakburger chain that is popular in the Midwest.

A large parking lot and a large structure are adjacent to the casino (free parking).

This place gets 5 stars for the excellent bar staff. I've been here a few times since opening. My friend absolutely loves this place  like ranting & raving about them... Until this visit I thought they were ok, about 3-4 stars.... But they just secured that final star and I'm so glad I waited to review. 

First my only real complaint from the first few visits was that it was really difficult to find out what kind of meat I was getting on my tacos. I'm allergic to pork, I know, I know The Horror! Anyway, my pork allergy puts me on edge when I don't feel confident the cooks understand what I mean by "I do not want any pork!" 

I had been complaining to my bf that if only they could update the signs to show what kind of meat.... And low and behold they did! Yay! It is was less stressful for me to order and try new things now. 

We decided to sit at the bar, and what a treat! The bar is small so if you ever get the opportunity, I say grab it! The bartender (completely forgot his name - cute young, hipsterish kinda guy) is awesome. He's fun, friendly and very funny. He made me this delicious pumpkin pie shot... Yum! Consider me converted.

This Jersey Mike's in located in kind of a cramped shopping center. I've stopped by this location a couple times now and and am glad to have a decent place to grab a sandwich for lunch when in the area. The employees inside are nice. I don't always remember my Shore Points Card, which accumulates points with each of my purchases towards free food, so it's nice that I can just give my phone number and they can look it up easy that way. I don't know if this is the only location that does it because I haven't seen it at other locations, but currently they offer a daily lunch special from 11 am to 3 pm that costs $6.99 and gets you any regular sub and drink. 

I like the "Original Italian" and "Club Sub" the best. Mike's way of course! The Italian has 6 different meats. I'd rather pay a couple dollars more to eat subs here rather than Port of Subs or Subway because the meats, breads and cheeses just taste better. They also had some "Chocolate Chip Cookies" which I never knew they had, so I got some and they are good!

You can place your order over the phone or online (you have the option to enter your shore rewards points online) for convenient pick-up.

When I hit a quarter of a century in years, I decided to go the uncharacteristically classy route and celebrate with something chi chi and razzdango. Exchange the morning after whiskey dents and zombie flavored scratch 'n sniff composure for a posh dinner out on the town.

Now I'm gonna share a secret with y'all. I'm no gourmand. I like a fancy pants meal as much as the next, but I'm in the cheap mo fo demographic, so I don't know dick about fine dining in the Phoenix area. I rely on you Yelpers to guide me down the path of good taste when it comes to nice shit and stuff.

Cha, cha, cha.

MEDIZONA.

It even sounds fancy, and I'm convinced it should be said with jazz fingers and maybe some light orchestral flare.

An upscale, Mediterranean-Southwestern fusion restaurant?

Intriguing.

Rabbit and fig baklava atop a pomegranate balsamic reduction, topped with a quail egg and surrounded by crispity parsnip curls?

Wicked fricken good.

It puts fig newtons everywhere to shame. Layers of airy, buttery phyllo filled with tender shredded fig and rabbit would have been much too sweet solo, but the addition of a tart reduction grabbed that figgy sweetness and tangoed round my palate! Although I'm convinced that the quail egg was just intended to be a cute little hat for the baklava. Whatevs. At least now I can claim that psh, yeah I've had quail egg before, no biggie.

Wild caught halibut with chorizo potato cake, haricot verts and carrots with orange caper cream sauce?

Melt in my mouth delicious.

Try to sneak a nibble of chorizo potato cake from my plate and I will fork you. Hard. You might pull back something a little stumpy. That was the most delectable little nibblet on the plate. The fish was super flaky and buttery, although the sauce was forgettable. And I think it's pretentious and hoity toity to call green beans "haricot verts." Merde!

Roast loin of lamb, moussaka tart, mashed taters, celery root, mint oil, and roasted red pepper sauce?

Eh. 

The lamb was ordered medium rare and prepared to perfection. Mint oil should be mandatory garnish for all baby lambs. Make em prance around the field wearing mint garlands until they're led to slaughter, where said garland will be compressed into the requisite drizzle of mint oil. Or something like that. Everything else on the plate was served cold though. Blech.

The service was impeccable, the patrons gripe worthy. Our waiter was well informed and personable, although he disappeared half way through the meal, was replaced and we never saw him again, which was kinda weird. 

The customers he was serving were pretty inconsiderate. There was a huge party of people with kids rip roaring around the restaurant off in the side room. The waiter apologized on their behalf, stating that it was an abnormal night and that kids didn't normally frequent the place, and at least they left soon after that. I don't go out to listen to the rip roar of impatient ankle biters. Instant plus two for the atmosphere as soon as they left.

But then a large group of older patrons came in and bitched about how they couldn't read the menus because it was too dark, so they turned up the lights, bent the atmosphere over the side of a chair and fucked it hard.

So I think I'm going to be a downer on the super streak Medizona's having and only give it a four. It's good but I don't think I'd ever go back. Too many other fancy schmancy restaurants waiting in the wings for an opportunity to knock my socks off. No need to return.

Easily one of my favorite hotels in Vegas.  I highly recommend this place to all of my friends and family who visit.  Here's why:

- Great selection of rooms.  You really have 3 choices of rooms & service here.....Mandalay Bay has mid-level rooms/service, THEhotel has great rooms/service, and the Four Seasons has excellent rooms/service.  The giant 2 bedroom suite at the end of the towers of Mandalay Bay are my favorite.

- Parking is easy.  The self parking and valet parking here is so easy.  The parking garage at the rear of the property has easy access from Frank Sinatra drive or Mandalay Bay Dr.  For locals or tourists it's an easy in/out.

- Great selection of restaurant choices.  From high end restaurants to cheap eats, there's something for everyone....and it's good food too.

- Lots of bars and lounges.  Everyone can find a place to have a drink and enjoy themselves.....from hipsters to regular joe's, there's something for everyone.

- Decent limits on table games.  You can find $10 min bet blackjack here on occasion.  There's also a good selection of slots and other table games.

- The vibe here is awesome.  I can't explain it, but I always feel good here.  The people and the vibe are always energizing.

- Great entertainment.  The House of Blues and the Mandalay Events Center always has great entertainers in their lineup.

- Walkway to Luxor.  If you want a different experience, you can easily walk to the Luxor via a connecting mall area without going outside.  This is huge during the sweltering Summer months.

Overall, this place has a little bit of everything for everyone....and they do it well.

Will I return?  You bet I will!

Born and raised in Vegas and have been to many, many 4- and 5-star restaurants all over town. If you're a foodie in Vegas, Giada is the place to be right now so I couldn't wait to go there for my wedding anniversary, 8/8. 

To sum it up, our experience was disappointing and way over priced for the style of food. I'm pretty desensitized to my hometown prices and this was still crazy given the service time and quality of food. 

Hostess was sweet, server was nice but highly sales driven. Both knowledgable about the restaurant but only mehh when it came to the food. Service was extremely slow. Antipasti came out at a good pace, but didn't get our pastas until 2 hours into dinner. Easily the slowest fine dining service I've ever had. 

Bread was good, but I wish it was served with olive oil or even butter. It's served with cheese, capers and pesto. I have a pine nut allergy and they had no substitution for the pesto. Cool for a $50 per person restaurant, not cool for a $125 per person restaurant. 

Meatballs, burrata, crostini antipasti dishes and the salads were fine. Pastas were 4-oz serving sizes, roughly $36 each and very underwhelming. The lemon spaghetti was too sweet for dinner, tasted like a lemon cookie. A little weird. 

Bought a dessert, which they placed on a "Happy Anniversary" plate. Who pays for birthday or anniversary desserts?! It's basically universal for restaurants to bring you a complimentary occasion dessert THEN ask if you'd like to purchase another. Best practices people. 

Virtually any Bellagio, Wynn, ARIA, MGM Grand contemporary or fine restaurant KILL Giada when comparing service and food quality. Most 5-star reviewers here must live under a foodie rock, or the namesake of Giada just overpowers their senses. Makes sense as people hate wanting things so badly and admitting disappointment.

When Denny's at 1am is the best meal you have had all day, you know something went horribly awry. 

Really I have nothing good to say about PastaBar other than I'm glad we didn't have a wait at 8pm on Friday night, but that is not saying much. 

The bread sticks they serve in the beginning? Dook 
Wine and beer selection? Also Dook. 

All three dishes we ordered came out lukewarm and the portions are really unimpressive, especially for the prices. I was not wowed one bit by anything, including the fried mozzarella. (which, btw, came AFTER our meal despite the fact that we ordered it first, as an appetizer....) 

Our server was a nice lady, but the service just wasn't good. The food wasn't good. I don't like the decor. I think its overpriced. 

I would really rather have gone to Olive Garden and paid $8.95 for the all you can eat pasta, salad and bread sticks. At least I would have been full when I left.

Thanks Denny's for saving my night.

What a let down this place was.

I came by here last week for a one o'clock lunch and was impressed by the quality and taste of their pizza. 

We've been to Crusts a bunch of times and have never made it over to their new quick individual pizza place near the PV Mall. It's actually few doors down from where the old Atomic Comics use to be.

I find MyPie is very similar in setup to Fired Pie on Northsight. http://www.yelp.com/biz/fired-pie-scottsdale#hrid:aWt21x1Kt7IlKg41opmbug  But the taste is better at MyPie in most instances and they excel -- way over the top at customer service. Crazy nice!

I went with the Margherita ($7.49) pizza (photos) with some sweet italian sausage ($1.00).  It was very good, so I ordered a regular one without sausage for home.  That pie wasn't as special as this, but overall slightly better than the one at Fired Pie.

Recently, the WSJ had an article on how Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. has quietly joined a growing group of restaurants aiming to change how we eat pizza. http://m.us.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304403804579264220659257040?ref=/news-lifestyle-arts-entertainment  

My friends in SoCal tell me these are very similar to Pieology: "Pieology prides itself on providing the best tasting, healthiest kustom pizza in the world. Using only the freshest ingredients, Pieology provides smoking hot pizzas in under 5 minutes."  

Whereas, Fired Pie says: "Fired Pie, a fast, casual, rich in flavor customizable pizza and salad made from scratch using fresh ingredients just the way you like it - all at a respectful price."

No matter!  I like My Pie slightly better than Fired Pie, but both are very good.  Expect to pay $10 to $12 for a very tasty individual wood fired pizza.  So Four Stars, and yes I am a Fan.

Enjoy!

I have to say I was impressed. I'm not a big crepe or pancake person but this place was nice. We shared the monkey, our company got the berry delight and a breakfast yum (can't remember which). They all were huge! Can't imagine finishing one by myself let alone the little one and I shared and we couldn't finish 
The strawberries, banana and Nutella was really a good combo without being overly sweet. We didn't want whip cream and the guy who took our order recommended adding strawberries to the monkey which was awesome.
The service was excellent, there was a mess made and the guys were helpful and quick to respond. You go up and place your order and get your drinks but they are quite helpful and attentive still
The only reason a star is missing as not enough seating during crowded times, we got the last table.

The worst sushi in Vegas.  

Overly creative, poorly executed reinvention, or a clueless chef?  Take your pick.  

The rice - chewy, almost cooked, well seasoned, so densely molded it's almost mochi.  

The seafood - limited with several high end selections out of stock or replaced by imitation.

The specialty rolls - A disaster.  Seriously?  Breaded shrimp for tempura, breaded and deep fried unagi (consistency of cold, fatty, chicken skin), rolls half stuffed with cream cheese, and imitation crab when the menu say real crab (hard to take when the roll is $17).  Finally, just because you were featured on a show about spicy food does not mean that a killer hot sauce should be drizzled on everything.  Ack!

Outright avoid the Fre Kin Gud, Crazy Mad Dragon, Wal Eye Knee, Yes Grasshopper, and Sexy Lady.

Service is laughable (remember, the glass is always half full).  On one visit, I asked the bartender for his recommendations and was told "I don't eat fish".  After staring dumbfounded for a minute he adds "I'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy".  How about a 45 minute wait for my starter (uni nigiri) only to be told it sold out.  Follow that up with a 10 minute wait for soy sauce delivered by an angry server who literally growled at the bartender "It's your job to give him soy sauce!"  In her defense, she did move one seat over before berating him.  

Limited wine list, small selection of trendy sake, inventive cocktails.  Vegas resort pricing.

Maybe the Chinese food they prepare is better but after just three visits, I'm not willing to be that guinea pig.

Note:  Added a star to their rating for the manager handling of my complaint and a long time bartender who mixed great cocktails and delivered excellent service.

This review is years overdue. I forget Yelp is for businesses beyond restaurants at times.

I'm obsessed with the Phoenix Knife House. I need to go there every once in a while just to hang out (and I always have to buy something). I've bought many a present here and I'm always itching to buy another knife for the house. 

Phoenix Knife House carries Japanese chef's knifes - which are only sharpened on one side. They're ridiculously sharp and so cool. We have a killer set of Wusthof's that we got for a wedding present that we don't really use anymore. And we just have a few knives from PKH. While we don't need anymore really, I have to get another soon. I'm going for the Sugimoto 8" chef's knife.

While they have some amazing, high end works of art (Damascus steel & such), they also carry a good selection of great knives that are super affordable.

Eytan, the owner, carries knives in typical Western shape and traditional Japanese form. He also has a bunch of killer kitchen tools. Absolutely love the kitchen shears he told us to get long ago and was excited to pick up a nice fish spatula recently.

This happens to be the place where many of the valley's local chefs do their knife shopping. Eytan has also expanded to carry some additional chef supplies so head over there if you need a chef's coat or clogs as well.

In addition to being an authority on knives, he's a master sharpener. He sharpens all kinds of knives, is super reasonable and has a quick turnaround.

In addition to the awesome product he has, Eytan is a major foodie. He is a former chef (SCI grad I think?) who worked at amazing places like Kai, Circa 1900, opened Fiamma here and did time in New York at spots like Aureole, La Cte Basque, and Craft.

He is also a great guy and a wealth of information on the local food scene. I'm always following up on  his recommendations.

Even if you have nice knives, you should check it out. Might get converted like I did!

FINALLY, a place for hipster wannabes from Assfucklandia to circle jerk!!!  It's ABOUT FUCKING TIME I was able to overspend for a drink and mingle with douchenozzles in ascots and Morrissey glasses...what took you so long, downtown Vegas?! Is there any way I can get a punchcard -- mortgage your house 10 times to buy drinks, get one percentage point free? Where do I sign up?????

I'm on the fence about all this downtown boosterism, but on the whole, progress is good... so I went in to support the new local bar. Sure, it SCREAMS douchetown from the outside...but I did go in with an open mind, I swear.

I bit my tongue while navigating the thug mooks manning the velvet rope out front (!). I bit it again when I shelled out $10 for a drink that costs 1/3 that right across the street. But after hanging out at this place for 3 hours, I ain't biting it no more.

So many annoying things about this place. There are these weird sort of security-types loitering around inside who can't/won't answer your simplest questions. The whole fuckin' reason I went here was to check out the upstairs patio, but it was closed. Why? No one knew. I wanted to order one of the hot drinks that are labeled "upstairs" drinks, so wanted to know if they were available though the patio is closed. No one knew. Finally found out from the waitress that they were NOT available, so ordered one of their corny specialty drinks...and it was served incomplete, without the special garnish that is an INTEGRAL PART of the drink. If you're gonna charge exorbitant prices for "mixology" drinks, at least make 'em right!! 

The other annoying aspect is the music -- it's so LOUD! My vocal chords were seriously strained after spending a couple hours here, trying to chat with my date. And that was before the DJ even started up!

Speaking of the DJ, he was the only cool thing about this joint. I expected a douchey hipster type, but he turned out to be an awesomely frumpy older dude with a beer gut, Coke-bottle glasses and stringy, balding hair. He looked more like a children's party clown/secret child molester than your average DJ, and for that I give him MAJOR props.

I actually do genuinely love this bar.......because it keeps all the pretentious assholes in one place, so I don't have to deal with them elsewhere on Fremont St.  So enjoy that $10 jizz fizz, asswad -- I'll be across the street. I'd rather drink among degenerate bluehairs in a smoke-filled casino bar ANY DAY! Hell, I'd rather drink Thunderbird out of a paper bag in the old Ambassador parking lot with that Santa Claus wino....GUARANTEED to be more fun than shouting til your vocal chords are raw with the stuck-up asswads in Commonwealth!

CES, the largest convention in the world, features the latest and greatest electronics at the World Trade Center Las Vegas (formerly the Las Vegas Convention Center).....some of the items featured here have not hit the stores yet.  It's one of my favorite conventions to attend here in Vegas.

With over 130,000 people expected at this year's CES I was prepared to battle crowds.  It wasn't too bad though.  I parked at the Las Vegas Hilton, which charges $30 a day to park there, but it's convenient to get in/out, so it's worth it in my opinion.

The registration process was very easy.  There was no line, perfect!

*TIP* - CES has a registration booth at the Las Vegas Hilton and it's not nearly as crowded as the main booth at the World Trade Center.....so come here to register.

I then headed over to the North Hall of the World Trade Center which is where all of the marquee companies are located.  I walked through the automobile electronics section, which was pretty cool.....think high-end and cool car stereo and entertainment stuff.  Then I went into the main hall where companies like Samsung, Microsoft, Intel, Sony, and other giants are located.  This year 3D TV's and 3D Entertainment seem to be the dominant theme on the main floor.  This really isn't groundbreaking as 3D has been around for a while.....I guess this is the year for the big push for it.  Lack of 3D Content is the big issue for these gadgets.  I also think wearing 3D glasses is ridiculous.....there's technology already out there that doesn't require them....it seems like it's already outdated, but companies are pushing it anyway.  I predict it will be a short term solution.

In the main hall, I also saw the new Samsung tablet...a potential competitor for the iPad.  I wasn't really impressed.  It worked well and looked nice, but not a game changer in my opinion.

After screwing around the main hall for a while, I headed over to the South Hall....I wanted to see the new Blackberry tablet, which is going to be launched soon to compete with the iPad.  I found it on the 2nd floor of the South Hall with a large crowd around the display.  After a short wait, I muscled my way to the front to get a demo of the tablet.....I was pleasantly surprised with the functionality, navigation, speed, and lightweight of the tablet.  The integration with the Blackberry phone is also impressive.  The tablet also has true multi-tasking capabilities....just like a computer, you can watch a video, surf the web, and launch another application with no hiccup in performance.  That was amazing!  In my opinion, it's not a big game-changer, but it puts Blackberry back on the map to compete with Apple and Android.  I like this product and will anxiously wait for it to come out.  I was told Sprint would be the 1st cell carrier to have it.  Can't wait! (see pic here: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ks43LokM7OWst3BJTtt-6g?select=b5ZtjUFv738j0I0Nki8ZQw )

After this, I was tired and wanted to head back to the Hilton to attend the CES Tweetup (different review).

Overall, it was a good show.....well organized and always impressive.

Will I return?  No doubt about it!

Some Tips:

- Wear comfortable shoes.  It's a huge convention and you will do a ton of walking.

- Bring a camera with a lot of memory.  There's a ton of gadgets and things to take photos of.  Don't miss out!

- Be prepared to pay for parking, up to $30 a day.

Can you say "food coma?"

OMG... I think perhaps I am in a food coma as I type this review... not sure what more I can add that the other 75 reviews haven't covered, but I'll give it a shot!

We went to Lo-Lo's today after the Phoenix 10k.  There was a group of 7 of us total and we arrived around 10:30am.  We were told there would be a 30 minute wait (which was pretty accurate).  Some of us went in and filled up drink cups with Kool Aid, Lemonade, Iced Tea or a combination - the sugar totally held us over!

We studied the menu as we waited so we all knew what we were going to order before we sat down.  Rasheeta was our waitress and she was awesome - there were a few other guys helping her out as well.  I had the "Nay Nay's" which came with 2 waffles, 2 eggs (i ordered them over easy), and grits.  Oh, and I ordered a side of fried okra as well.  (I figured I may as well go all out 'cause who knows when I'll be back).  The waffles and grits had enough butter on them to feed an army of hungry runners.  I also had a bite of Jared's Fried Chicken.  Everything was delicious...

So much for all of the calories burned during the 10k.  Thanks Lo-Lo's for my fix of Southern Food - it reminded me of the good ol' days I spent in Atlanta!  

I'm sure I'm missing some highlights from our meal, but since I was there with a table full of yelpers, hopefully they will fill-in what I missed!

Another afternoon in the Summerlin area, we decided to trek over to the Suncoast Casino for some grub.  I'm so happy we encountered this place that serves happy hour deals all day everyday!   Appetizers are half price in their large bar area.  The Tuscan Spinach Dip was served with fresh (warm) tortilla chips.  Their $1.50 bucket of fries weren't really served in a bucket, but were way worth it.  A high point of our dining experience was the sliders, each for $1.50 on the happy hour menu.  With a nice charbroiled taste and caramelized onions, we ended up ordering more.  A low point was my incomplete house salad.  This order usually comes with croutons, cucumber slices, and a garlic breadstick.  I pretty much had a small plate of just lettuce.  They did bring me a garlic breadstick later though.

Speaking of bringing it...all the waiters work as a team, tending to all patrons.  I must've dealt with six different waiters after we were seated.  Service was with a smile and diligence!  The drinks weren't bad either during happy hour.  I tried their Electric Lemonade which was like kool-aid with a little kick.  Their $5 Margarita, with 1800 Silver Tequila, was flawless.  

The next time I visit, I will partake in their Endless Soup, Salad and Bread Lunch Deal.  From 10am to 4pm, $4.99 will get you all you can eat soup, salad, and bread.  What a freakin deal.  Hell...I might just have to get a slider or two while I'm at it.

We order the 20" cheese pizza for $14.11 last night for dinner and thought it was very good.

Giant Rustic Pizza is located in the Safeway shopping area, next to after school learning center Kumon and Leslie Pool supplies.  This is a take-out only store that has seating outside.  Besides selling whole and half pies, Giant Rustic sells by the slice, along with salads and artisan breads.  The latter is mainly for the lunch crowd, but it seems to have attracted some of the parents waiting for their kids at Kumon.

The pizza is a very large twenty inch pie that is tasty.  The smaller 14" pies are called Large.  Although it is a thin crust, the bread is very chewy.  Our family of three thought is was a little too chewy, but that is a matter of taste. The dough they use seems above average, while the pizza sauce was not seasoned very much.  The light dusting of cheese on top was just enough to cover the pie.

Compared to the other pizza places within a few miles of this location, Giant Rustic's is closer to NYPD, than Ray's or Corleone's in terms of style.  NYPD tends to be chewier of the three.

We liked the pizza and all the energy and extras the new owners bring.  The prices seem in line -- somewhat less than Ray's and NYPD; but more than Corleone's for a similar sized pizzas. As I've mentioned, the 20" Giant Rustic Pizza is $12.95, while the 14" Large Rustic Pizza is $8.95. Additional toppings are $1.75 each for the Giant and $2.50 each for the Large. All prices are before AZ sales tax.

Giant Rustic also serves sandwiches that are made with their Artisan bread for $7.95.  They include Chipotle Turkey Slaw, BMT, Tuscan Veggie and Italian Bird (Turkey).

In the case next to the counter, they sell Giant Salads for $8.95, with names like Sonoran Chicken, Mediterranean, Italian Kitchen, California Dreamin and The All American. They all looked good, so I'll be back at some point for lunch.  So Three Stars, "A-OK".

Okay... Vegas may not be San Jose or LA's Little Saigon when it comes to Vietnamese food. However, with that being said, this joint really isn't too shabby either.

Pho Kim Long (that name will never cease to get a chuckle out of me) is the go-to late night spot to get your drunk grub on. I've been here way too many times for my own good, as my state of sobriety while eating here is usually (although not always!) questionable. Regardless, the food is solid and the locals seem to love it.

When I came to Vegas this past June for EDC (yep, as in the Electronic Daisy Carnival 2012 ---- suuuuch a crazy experience, btw), company preferred ordering family style dishes like shaking beef, ong choy, pork spare ribs etc. Everything was quite tasty and portions were ample, but I got the impression that this place catered more to American tastes. The dishes, while yummy in my tummy, were more like something you might find in a mainstream Chinese restaurant than authentic Viet food. Still, no real complaints as it was delicious nevertheless.

During my last trip over Halloween weekend, though, I ordered more "true" Viet fare like seafood noodle soup and Bun Bo Hue. I was surprised that the taste and quality were above average. Definitely better than Tung Kee Noodlehouse and probably better than a good portion of pho spots back home! I can see why the locals took me here so often because if *I* was local, I'd probably become a regular too.

However, here's the issue:

NOT being a local, I'm on vacation. And should be eating Vegas-y thangs. Elsewhere. Thangs that are NOT pho. Since I can get plenty of it. Authentic, at that. At home.

So...... basically......

Eat it if you're a local, eat if you're drunk and broke, eat it if you want Viet food while in Vegas. Heck, I'd do the same. If none of these things apply, though? And you have a choice to eat something else? I would. Because dammit, it's called a vacation. Feed me fancy things. Because that's what I want. Hence.... 3 stars.

I thought the Vdara was supposed to be on of the newer hotels? I booked the panoramic suite here for my birthday and this stay was by the WORST experience ever. Almost nothing worked in our suite and I assumed they service we received was so awful because we were young adults just looking for a good time. The TV in the main bedroom didnt work & neither did the Phone. We told guest services twice & not only did they not fix it, but didn't even bother to give us a new room! 

On top of our 3 day stay, i kid you not - every time we would try to enter our room, the key cards NEVER worked. So we had to call guest services once again and wait 30 minutes for someone to open our door for us. Then we would have to go back down to check in and get a new set of keys. THIS HAPPENED EVERY DAY for 3 DAYS. they tried to tell us "oh you must be putting it by your cell phone or credit card in your purse" WELL NO THAT WASNT THE PROBLEM. because after the 1st time it happened, we all put them in our shorts with nothing else so we wouldn't have to have the problem again. Really one of my hugest pet peeves are people treating you like your idiots. and what is the probably the BOTH cards wouldn't work?

But that wasn't even the worst part. My first night stay and i woke up with BED BUG BITES all up and down my legs! (PICTURE UPLOADED) How wonderful my 21st birthday and i cant even go to the beach club in my bathing suit. I was SO UPSET. I wrote an email, called. everything. Not one apology, reimbursement let alone a lousy response from Vdara!

I will NEVER stay here again. All the money i spent for a suite and i would have rather stayed at circus circus at that point. As long as everything functioned & id be comfortable sleeping in a clean bed. This place is a nightmare.

I had a really incredible lunch here that was a pleasant surprise. I almost didn't eat here due to the mediocre reviews but I am so glad that I gave it a chance! 

We were looking for a lighter, healthy lunch, not an easy thing to find in Las Vegas. We ended up at China Poblano as there weren't many other options near by. 

I thought it was going to be a mix of Chinese and Mexican flavors but it was actually just a combination of Chinese and Mexican dishes. 

The shrimp mojo was incredible. Eight shrimp were smothered in a yummy black garlic sauce that had a great kick with green poblanos. The tuna ceviche was another winner. Amaranth seeds gave it a nice crunch, but it was just a tad too salty. 

The beet salad was beautiful, simple and small. Pieces of beets, oranges and avocado were topped with slivers of pickled onion and an orange dressing. 

The golden pig dim sum was my least favorite item. They were super sweet and there wasn't enough meat in them. 

Overall service was very friendly. Food was great. It was surprisingly expensive as a lot of other reviewers have commented. I would come back but I'd skip the buns!

I know that some People really love Dr. Wilson. That is why I went to her in the first place. I have tried to wait awhile before reviewing this, so my anger would cool down.

Some people that work in her office are nice. Especially one of her nurses.
I cannot remember her name,but she is older and blonde and perhaps German. She is the best person that works there.
The rest that work there all act as if they are doing you a favor by being there.
The worst is Shannon. She is beyond rude!
I had surgery with Dr. Wilson about 6months ago now. I had the worst treatment of my medical life from this Shannon. Everyone I have ever talked to about this and has had dealings with her has said the same thing.
My pain medication was never discussed just given to me (in prescription). When I asked about not having heavy pain meds, Just perhaps a relaxer. She actually started raising her voice to me and refused to explain anything.

When I did have the surgery, I went to the Piper Center. They were wonderful Thank you Jesus. I do not know what I would of done if everyone had treated me the way I was treated at Dr. Wilson's office.
 After my Surgery, the Dr. did not speak to anyone in my family about it. To say if I was dead or alive, nothing. They were all there in the waiting room.
They saw her sail out the door and never return.
Not only did she not come to see me and check on me in the hospital the next day, she sent no one.
When I asked the nurses when the DR. was coming so I could go home. They said she is not, she does not do it that way.
No one ever came to see me, no one ever called me, or emailed ,or sent a letter, Nothing! I had a serious surgery as well.
My dentist called me the day after a crown to make sure I was alright!

When I went back to her 6 weeks later, I said no one ever came to see me, or call me to see if I was alright. She (the Dr.) said we do not do it like that.
I understand that she is good at what she does, but no bed side manner here at all. Her staff is the same way. 
They treat you as if you are a Welfare case. Which of course I am not, everything was paid for in full.     But, no one should be treated this way for any reason.


Before I was even dressed from the exam, they were in the room preparing it for the next Victim. That happened 2 times! On 2 separate visits! I am not kidding about that at all. Just walked in the room 2 of them with the door open and started getting it ready.


I do not care how good you are, you cannot treat people like this. I would NEVER recommend this office to anyone. You would have better treatment at the VET!

They say the middle of the road is a good place to get hit, but that's where I am with this place.   

The Bad: 
1. We were seated at the smallest table ever to be in a restaurant, I think the Guinness Book sticker was on the side of it. 
2. Then we were handed two large "book style" menus, a sushi menu, a drink menu, and a sinner special menu.    Just shuffling all that paper made us a little crazy.  SIMPLIFY PEOPLE!
3. One of the items we order was brought to us on a plate that was so large that it hung over the side of the tiny table. Very dumb because there was no reason other than "looking cool" in the kitchen when they made it.
4. A little pricey for what you get.

The Good:
1. The bacon wrapped scallops (only 2 for $8.50) were awesome. The best I've ever had.
2. The waiter was very helpful with drink and food suggestions. (Keep in mind that he seemed to see we were having a tough time flipping through all FOUR menus.)
3. The Red roll was out of this world.
4. The place itself is as nice as your gonna find in any strip mall in AZ.

See, 4 good points and 4 not so good points.  This one is up to you to check out and see for yourself.

If you're in Las Vegas and you're as awesome as I am, please spend an evening at Insert Coins. It sure beats a night out at one of those swanky Las Vegas clubs. 

Let's compare and contrast the two potential experiences.

The Cover at a Swanky Vegas Club: It tends to be free if you're a girl and $20 (or more) if you're a guy. Lame. Those clubs should be paying me for my presence.

The Cover at Insert Coins: It was free for girls and $5 for guys. Sort of lame, but it could be worse. 

The Winner: Insert Coins. It's the lesser of the two evils, which is why I voted for Barack Obama in 2008.

The People at a Swanky Vegas Club: The guys usually have enough gel in their hair to glue together two bowling balls. And they tend to wear tight t-shirts with metallic prints or a dress shirts with really big stripes and maybe a skull on the back. Either fashion choice shows off their steroid influence muscles and fake tans. And yeah, they will say they are 30 and look more like 44.

As for the women, you will usually see them caked with make up, Medusa like hair extensions, one size too tight dresses from Forever 21, and heels they got on sale at Macy's, but are one half size too big. They look sloppy. So they walk around in big groups so they seem more attractive. It's the Sorority Effect. Sure, they look great in a large group. But individually, no one really stands out.

The People at Insert Coints: The guys were in jeans and t-shirts. The girls were in jeans and t-shirts.  I actually felt totally comfortable wearing a Pac-Man t-shirt, jeans, and some Star Wars shoes. And I even got compliments from men and women on my attire. It's just that kind of joint.

Winner: Insert Coins. I'll take a laid back setting over a the Jersey Shore. 

The Entertainment at a Swanky Vegas Club: Some random DJ who is famous for playing music off his MacBook that usually consists of electronic dance music that hasn't changed much since 1995. Sigh.

The Entertainment at Insert Coins: If you're an old school gamer, hit up the old school arcades from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. I showed off my Pac-Man skills, then played some WWF wrestling game where half of the characters were currently dead, and then moved on to some Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat.

You can also play more current video games at the bar such as Madden, FIFA Soccer, and Tekken. And they have lounge sections with an array of choices to sit back, grab some drinks, and play video games with your friends.

In the background, there was some pretty awesome late 80s and early 90s New Jack Swing type music. So people could get up and dance the night away to New Edition and their spin off acts such as Bobby Brown, Ralph Tresvant, and Bell Biv Devoe. Best advice ever: Never trust a big butt and a smile.

Winner: Insert Coins. Duh.

Anyway, if you're in Las Vegas and want a break from the strip, head to Insert Coins. It's the perfect place to sit back, grab a drink, and be awesome.

On my last night in Vegas, I figured I'd hit the strip for some tried and true authentic Thai cuisine at none other than the famous Lotus of Siam. Located in a dilapidated old strip mall north of the main strip, you'd easily miss this place if you sneezed but make no mistake, this place is the real deal folks! At check in, we were told it would be a grueling 45 minute wait. We were then invited to the bar to pass the time.  Needless to say, we enjoyed a shot or two at the bar and made some new friends in some cool gals.  Before we knew it, our table was ready! Way less than 45 minutes I might add.

Our server was kind courteous and very helpful. She took our orders and within moments, our tasty dishes were basking on our table.

Sea bass drunken noodles - if you like chow fun, you will enjoy every bite of this phenomenal dish! Order it medium spicy and top it with the buttery sea bass and you'll be good to go! Satisfaction guaranteed!

Crispy duck - served with a coconut panang curry sauce, I was blown away by the incredible texture and zesty tang of the panang curry, awesomely delicious!

Garlic prawns - jumbo prawns served nice and crispy with the most enticing aroma I've experienced in years. It will make you drool at first whiff and the explosive garlicky flavor will keep you pining for another decadent bite!

Overall, awesome service, impeccable food and good times = A+++ from this guy 

Happy Eats!

This cake kicks other cake's @$$es, now queue the Rocky Theme Song!

Day after day, driving from bakery to bakery, looking for the perfect cake to present at the wife and my 30th birthday extravaganza. It was tedious work, but somebody had to do it. I felt a bit like Rocky Balboa, climbing up and down the endless flight of stairs and beating up on that hanging slab of meat. Except my stairs and cow was a fork and cake; plate to mouth lift, plate to mouth lift. You can work up a sweat just thinking about it.

It's wasn't easy choosing a bakery for that top notch cake. Chocolate cake, vanilla cake, marbled, and layered, filled with strawberry jam, raspberry ganache, topped with butter cream, cream cheese icing, fondant, rum infused; it's enough to make your head spin. I had to sacrifice and dedicate the countless hours of time to complete this task; but in the end, I got it done.

Good, bad, and indifferent, we made it through the first 5 or 6 opponents and ultimately found ourselves pitted against Kick Ass Kakes. Jay started throwing punches, left hook, right hook, upper cut, KO; I didn't think Rocky was ever KO'd in the movies, but maybe it was just a sugar coma - I'll go with that.

Jay got behind our crazy idea for a Hot Dog shaped cake; we 'were' catering Short Leash Hot Dogs after all and wanted a fun cake to go along!  Most other bakers we met with explained 'how difficult of a job it would be', how it would be 'better as a regular cake with hot dogs designed onto it', or lets 'craft little hot dogs and place them around the cake' instead. Jay was the only baker we met with who had the confidence to actually pull off what we were looking to do, and he did not disappoint!

You can check out the picture of our cake if you're interested; *view at your own risk* you might just get K.O.'d from looking at it. Ours is the cake that looks like a big hot dog! ;-)

Jay battered us silly with an awesome red velvet cake, filled with a perfect cream cheese icing, topped with fondant, and shaped to look like a Short Leash Hot Dog. It was a hit, everyone was knocked out with amazement at how cool the cake looked. This was the perfect center piece to our catered celebration!

Thanks again K.A.K's! You can bet we'll be around again for some of those cupcakes and macaroons you bake up daily, just let us recuperate a little before our next prized fight.

Ive tried to like this place, really! Ive put in a solid effort but time after time I'm just so disappointed. 

1st time- I sat at the bar for lunch. After waiting almost 15 minutes for the bartender to show up, I ordered a glass of Cab and the Carpaccio. The carpaccio came out 20 minutes later, and it was room temperature. Now after working in Italian restaurants for most of my life I know carpaccio is supposed to be cold, due to being raw meat. When i confronted the bartender about this all she said was "that's how its served here" I ordered another glass of wine and didn't touch my meal. When i got the bill i noticed i was charged for two glasses of Merlot. at $16 each & she didn't take the carpaccio off my bill even though it was untouched and I voiced my concern about it. 
When I asked her why the Merlot she said "Oh well that's what i poured you, and you drank it" I laughed paid the bill and vowed to never return.

2nd time- Firefly was too busy and my friends all talked me into giving this place another try so I did. It was a disaster. Bartender obviously had friends at the bar so we were ignored the majority of the time, and when we got our bill their were drinks on their that were obviously not ours... but couldn't help but notice the bartenders friends were drinking what was on our bill. Nice dude.. real nice.

3rd time- Came in here last night for the live music. And once again... 100% pure disappointment. We were seating in the lounge area and it was absolutely impossible to get service. The little Russian server was not only rude but we kept having to go up to the bartender for drinks because she was no where to be found.

All i have left to say now is... 3 STRIKES YOUR OUT.

A rainy day must! 11:30am and already a line waiting outside. What is this recent ramen obsession of mine? I used to be content eating Cup O Noodles with a cracked egg...don't judge, we've all been slummin' at some point.
A friend of mine recommended Sora and I'm glad to say I can still call her a friend.
First off, I appreciate the quick service and slightly more ample seating. The servers were on their game and quickly delivered the goods with a smile and thorough explanation of the menu. I initially expected to pay a la cart for tamago, chashu and spicy meat like at the other places. But for $8.50 I can get a SPICY MISO RAMEN with all of the above...what a great deal! Of course you can get extra portions of these items for just a $1 or $2...again not a bad deal considering some other ramen houses charge much more.
SPICY MISO RAMEN was perfect! I loved the spicy meat that should be a ramen staple...lean ground meat with a slight sweetness and once mixed into the rich, not too salty miso broth, completes the ramen experience. Chashu is a newly acquired taste for me as I wasn't a fan of fatty pork belly, but in a steamy bowl of ramen is now an unctuous treat I crave. Chashu, slow braised pork belly that takes hours to cook to achieve that tender, melt-in-your-mouth texture. The only thing I didn't like and will probably always have an aversion to is the fermented bamboo shoots..menma. I think it ruins my perfect bowl with its stinky presence...sort of like the uncle no one likes who keeps showing up at dinner. I must remember to omit it from now on.
I enjoyed the simplicity of Sora's ramen that didn't try to pack in everything and give you ramen ADD with adding things like black garlic, chili threads (offenders know who they are). Ramen is a simple bowl of comfort food meant to satisfy and warm the soul. Sora achieves this and is what a good Obaasan (grandma) would approve.

I already knew I loved @greendamon/Green because they offer a safe haven for vegans (and non-vegans) that realize being vegan or vegetarian does not mean you have to eat healthy, and that every meal doesn't have to be made of vegetables.

So, there are some majorly delish dishes... the artichoke gratine, the samosas, orecciette pasta with meatballs, the secret bbq chicken sandwich... and they always have some creative special.

Last night we stopped in after the Paso Robles wine tasting at FLEMINGS STEAK HOUSE... hey... we needed to counter all the flesh we saw being devoured.... 

and right before my eyes was the most magical and delicious creation known to man. Seriously. Like hands down best thing I have ever ever ever eaten. EVER!!

So, Green - if you don't put the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich on your full time menu, I think you are denying the good people of Arizona what they deserve: perfection.

An amazingly fresh and tasty roll topped with crispy bacon, chicken, mayo, fresh sliced avacado, CRISPY cheese, and jalapenos. Sure, doesn't sound that special...

BUT I ORDERED TWO. I wanted to order another. I want one right now. In fact, I cannot imagine a moment in my life where I won't be craving this amazing creation.

So - do yourself a favor. Try Green because the food is great, they care about all living beings, they have vegan blizzards, and one day they will have the best thing you have ever eaten on their menu.

I'm going to write a letter a day until they add it to their menu. I'm serious. I can be a real pest.

I love having this healthy option near home.  I have been here twice now and I enjoyed it every time.  I keep having the same thing because it was so delicious.  The local fish is a platter with grilled fish, any way you like it.  I always choose the south of the border, it is spicy, but not burn your tongue spicy.  I love it.   You also get the cole slaw and tomatoes and onions.  I never eat all my brown rice.  I was glad that the second time I got it, the amount of rice was smaller, I still left about half of it on the plate.  I am a portion conscious person and I think the piece of fish is really big.  My hubby had the seafood salad and it was delicious, I stole one of his grilled shrimp.  The first time the wait was a little long, but it was the first week they were open.  The second time the food was out within 20 minutes, which is very reasonable.  This will definitely be in my rotation.

I still can't get over this whole Chinese Mexican whachamacallit concept. 

Granted, the story of a couple combining their cultural backgrounds is lovely, but I cannot wholeheartedly accept this combination of cuisines.

First timers are given a taste tour of couple items. Little sample cups of their meats and rice. Out of their 14 main items, they include things like: carnitas, Chinese bbq pork, egg foo young, jade red chicken (sweet&sour), jen red pork (sweet&sour), emerald chicken (ginger&onion), etc. The menu: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A?select=BMDFYI4Hl-Vw7rsjvzbhVQ)

For those who are unaware, I am not a big fan of Chinese food. So imagine my dismay after realizing my options. And coming from the Bay Area where Chinese food is readily available and at higher standards, I did not travel all this way to have Chinese food, let alone...fusion Chinese food. But my friends were eager to try this, and so there I was.

Food can be ordered in the following options:
1) Rice bowl: Choice of a main item and steamed rice (too Chinese for me. Pass!)
2) Combo: Choice of two main items with steamed rice (even more Chinese. Pass!)
3) Quesadilla: Choice of a main item with cheese (had quesadilla already. Pass!)
4) Burrito: Choice of a main item in tortilla (my only option)

Jerk Chicken with Cuban Black Bean Burrito (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A?select=eap6hGNvq6Afm-xjso-nAA): The thought of putting sweet and sour pork or egg foo young in a burrito frightened me. So I opted for the safer choices. The jerk chicken was marinated with really hot peppers, which I did not know beforehand. And the black beans were also spicy. My mouth was on fire!!!! The burrito was $3.50. Added black beans and cheese. Plus a fountain drink, my total came to $8! The burrito was tiny! What the heck did I pay for?! Tastewise, the burrito was dry. And their choice of 'hot sauces' were a homemade black bean sauce or some sweet tangy egg roll dipping sauce. Bleh.

Each order came with a cookie (Snickerdoodle or Volcano) which was a nice touch. But how does a cookie tie into Chinese or Mexican cuisine?

One of the most confusing dining experiences ever. Oh yeah, it was another Guy Fieri DDD spot.

This Chino did not likeO.

Hate to say it, but Free Vegas Club Passes didn't exactly deliver as I had hoped during my girls weekend in Vegas. Now, we did plan our trip during one of the busiest weekends of the year, Labor Day weekend. That said, I booked my schedule more than a month in advance on Chris' website. Since you are required to party at the Palms on the first night, I signed us up for Rain and Moon for Friday. I also selected Tryst for Saturday and XS for Sunday. I knew that these clubs were among the most popular but they were listed as options at the time and I received a confirmation shortly after submitting my request. 

The confirmation did state that the info might change but I didn't hear anything in the following days that would indicate that it had. One week before the trip, I received emails that said the lists for Tryst and XS had been canceled, and we were now on a list for Cathouse at the Luxor for both of those nights. I appreciated the back-up plan, but we already had our hearts set on the other clubs, not to mention dinner reservations at the Wynn for Saturday night since we thought it was where we were going to party later in the evening.

Since there was no way in hell I was going to let my girls down, I quickly contacted another friend who was going on the trip to explain the situation. She worked her own contacts and got us on VIP lists for Tryst and XS on the same nights we originally wanted. 

We did stick with our Friday night plans regardless and went to Rain since DJ Pauly D was spinning. It was a GREAT time.

So will I use the service again or recommend it to friends? Perhaps. Probably. On non-holiday weekends, it's probably a great service. But I'd definitely be wary that things may not work out, so I'd probably come up with my own back-up plan just in case.

After reading MaryLou D's review on Yelp, a group of us from my office decided to come here for a late afternoon lunch.

We were blown away by this Mom (sorry, no Pop) place. Nana is cooking up some really tasty food. I had the Carne Asada burrito, which was huge.  Take a look at my knife and fork (photo) next to this bad boy. 

Second, the flavors were outstanding and we couldn't get over the amount of meat that she gave us.  Even at $6.50, there must have been well over a cup and a half of diced Carne Asada. Wow. 

While she was making our food, we got a chance to catch up on our favorite Mexican Soaps on the flat screen TV, munching on some chips with some really good and flavorful homemade salsa (with four alarm heat), and all the while enjoying a 16 oz bottled long neck Coke. Atmosphere. Atmosphere. Atmosphere! We didn't want to go back to work. Time moves slowly here, but not Nana. She's always hustling!

Expect to pay around $11, including a very generous Tip to Nana for this incredible meal. Four Stars and yes, we are Fans. Thank you MaryLou!

(This is an asian persons attempt at rapping, I'm sorry in advanced)

*Throws a beat*

Shit I feel like a balla right now...

I should have a prostitute on my left arm right now...

Where the prostitutes be at right now...?

Oh shit, this place is fancy right now...  

The prostitutes must be high class in disguise right now....  

Scanning the room looking for hooks and tricks right now....

I'm not quite sure why...but I thought it would be fun for right now...

I don't really know what me and the prosties would do, maybe grab a coffee and discuss how they got into the biz maybe...who knows?  *pictures Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman*  Naw I ain't that lucky...

This hotel is new, and with new things comes an exciting new smell.  Like buying a new jacket and wearing it out the store.  Or driving out of the car dealership in a brand spanking new Benz and sniffing the leather.  It's all about the small little things that matter.  And this hotel didn't miss one detail.  Everything was impeccable, down to the wallpaper, amenities, service, decor, rooms, staff.  No detail was left unworked.  Even the crystals in all the lights in the hallways made me smile as they twinkled.

The bars and shops inside this hotel were beautiful, except everything was honking expensive so I didn't really buy anything except drinks.  The pools are beautiful, the spa offers deliciously decadent services and massages.  I have no idea if they have a gym because I didn't go looking for one because I'm on vacay!

The room was like a mini apartment, careful for the mini bar though because if you move the bottles they'll try and charge you!  Make sure to check!

The bed was super comfy, the tv that controlled everything in the room was really cool, the balcony view overlooking the strip was stunning.

There are so many things to see and do in this hotel you don't even have to leave.  We barely left the hotel to do anything because its like a little city in here.  No need to venture out into the elements :)

Shhhhhh....  Don't tell anyone else about this place.  i don't ever want to have to wait in line or share this absolutely wonderful place!

Some call this modern Japanese, some call this fusion.  I call this the best of Japanese Cuisine and closer to authentic than I can imagine.

First of all, a disclaimer.  If you like big honking rolls of sushi with names like Dragon Roll, Rainbow roll, Tiger Roll and all these type of concoctions, then this will not be your real destination.  Why?  Because Soho to me is traditional Japanese because.....


a. Genmaicha - So far, most places I go to, when I ask for genmaicha, they either do not have it, or it comes in a tea bag.  Blah!  this place has the real deal, tasty and they refilling your cup.

b.  Texture and Taste - Why do I say tradition, because the art of Japanese style to be is simply, form, function and when it comes to food, it is all about texture and taste.  Everything I tried, was subtle, delicate, perfect combination of texture and taste.

c.  rolls - They did have some limited tools.

d.  Nigiri Sushi - Went with the standard measurable sushis for me.  Tobiko, Amaebi, maguro with sliced jalapeo and lemon.  All three of these are contenders for the best of class. 

e.  Chef - the chef came out to stop and talk to us a bit.  I was totally impressed by this.  He is so caring about the food and his desire for excellence. We were able to try some of his signature dishes that he comped us.  Uni , Hamachi in Yuzu Soy, Kuramoto Oysters.  All three of these were beyond my wildest expectations.  The uni was served fresh and without the sushi.  It does not get better than that.  the Hamachi in Yuzu Soy was absolutely a dream.  thinly sliced yellow tail, with a fried jalapeo and micro cilantro.  If you ever had steamed fish cantonese style, this Hamachi dish itself will bring back memories.

f.  And More on food.... We tried

- Short Ribs, okay not traditional, but really awesome.
- Amaebi - The shrimp were just perfect, and the fried heads were out of the world.
- Marinated Cod - So tender
- Edamama - Just right
- Soho Tostados - what an invention!
- Gyoza - Not bad at all, loved the sauce.

g.  Service = Absolutely committed and first class.

GK says, my new favorite place to go.

I hate reviews that rip off that Mastercard commercial but what the hell, I'm doing one as well:

VIP Table at Tryst : $1,000
Belvedere Vodka:  $450 per bottle (x 2)
Hookers:                  $300 (x 2)
Getting kicked out of Tryst:  priceless!

Yes, for the first time in my adult life I was kicked out of a club.  Why you may ask?  I'm still a bit unclear but basically some girls were taking a picture near our table, told me to get out of the way and I replied "This is our table!  You get out of the way!"  Well, something along those lines, it was 3am and I was not sober.  Turns out I said the wrong thing to the wrong person - one of the largest men I've ever seen told me that I had to leave.  The guy who escorted me out was really nice, he told me that I was leaving for disrespecting a member of the hotel staff. I wasn't about to argue with someone that large so I just kept my mouth shut and let him lead me away...I was half expecting him to go all Ocean's 11 on me and rough me up a bit but nope, just a nice walk out.  

Oh wait, the hookers...as I'm standing outside the Wynn a cute girl walks by and smiles at me.  I smile back and she starts chatting me up...turns out her and her friend were hookers.  And no, I didn't go there.  

That brings me to my Vegas formula:
Girls in club at 1 am smile at you:  they want you to buy them a drink
Girls on the street smile at you at 3 am:  they want you to buy them.

I'm still giving Tryst 2 stars because our waitress was really sweet and super hot and the dude who kicked me out didn't beat me up.

This unassuming little place is lots of fun!  Our UYE for lunch here today included Norm R., Jos C., Mike C., Scott W. and myself.

Now Jos is from Cuba, & so was my dad, so we each have some familiarity with Cuban cooking, but many of the dishes here were new to me.  You get a slight description of things on the restaurant menu, but the more important thing to know is that the food here is great & whatever you order you will probably like!  We chose all different dishes & everyone in our group enjoyed their lunch!

We all started with a shared tasty appetizer, Croquetas, and then for my meal I went with the Lechn Asado ($8.49), which is pork roast with a bit of gravy & cooked onion strings.  It came with a small side salad & a big serving of really good rice with black beans.  (Yes, you want THIS rice, not white rice...  It's good, trust me!).  They serve up awesome desserts too, if you have room (or take home for later), & they're inexpensive!

I can't wait to get back here & bite my way through more of the many surprises on the menu, and Cuban Foods here (aka Bisteces) gets 5 Stars!     :-))

"Everything sounds normal; prawns, scallops, uni, crab, beef, pork.  Nothing I haven't seen.  Is it your cooking techniques" begins my poker bud to the perplexed server.

"Uhhh, I'm sorry".  his replay

"What makes your meats bizarre?" he asks, as I loose it.  OK maybe I should have corrected him as he misspoke the name the entire afternoon but...

Bizarre it's not but a bazaar of flesh, yes.

Begin the meal sampling some of Andres best creations from Bazaar LA.  Modernist cuisine treats that tease the senses and palate.  Top props to the famous cotton candy foie with its unadulterated sweetness that heightens the rich, livery, flavor of foie.  Also worthy, the Asian taco (iberico ham on nori with flying fish roe).  Great complexity starting with the nuttiness of the ham, quickly building with the briny, oceanic caviar and finishing with a huge umame punch.  The liquid olives and giant chicharrons are also great.

The raw bar, different.  No shrimp cocktail here.  If in season, the lightly poached, head on spot prawn is to die for.  Uber sweet, it's flavor comes alive with the dusting of ginger salt.  Sucking the head fat, one of life's great pleasures.  The geuduck, candy from the sea.  Great texture, its natural sweetness well controlled by the addition of yuzu, soy, ginger and especially fresh lemon that brightens the dish.  Finally, an outstanding abalone.  Tender, served with a dashi gelee, and a lemon, soy  sauce.  Again, the strong citrus component and racy acidity brings out the natural sweetness.

Worthy of mention is their vittore 1950 tenderloin carpaccio.  Very traditional preparation, the mildly sweet sherry "dressing" with its nutty overtones perfectly expresses the beef's flavor.  A classic beef tartare equally good with just the right amount of anchovies to bring out the umame finish on the beef.  

A great selection of cured meats.  Stick to the imported jamon iberico de bellaota.  As perfect of an example of this great ham as any.  Beautiful pork flavor with the perfect nutty finish.

Finally the beef.  Sold by the pound (the thicker the better, share).  All well trimmed, wood grilled, and tender, cooked to temp.  All lack long aging, and therefore the umame finish.  Three breeds of cattle.  The black angus, good "American" beef flavor.  The wagyu, sweeter and mildly beefy.  The hybrid washugyu, the best blend of beefy flavor and sweetness that pairs perfectly with the bitterness of the grill.  Sadly, the top steak (A4 Japanese rib eye from Hyogo prefecture) is just OK.   Seasoned with salt then over cooked (ordered blue, served mid rare).  The joy of eating beef of this quality is to allow the fat to melt in the mouth, not be released on the plate.  Seasoning each slice right before enjoying it is also a must.

Very good, friendly service.

Very good wine list.  Typical Vegas resort markup.

A solid steakhouse that excels at non steak dishes.

IMPECCABLE.  Food, service, staff, ambiance...everything was just impeccable.

We chose the 6 course dinner each and we were there from 5:30pm to 10:30pm.
-The L'Amuse-bouche:  a small bite that excited my palate.
Bread cart approached me and oh how I tried to so hard to limit myself to 3...we were given olive oil and salt sprinkled butter to enjoy with the bread.
-Soup: Delicate tofu velout with lemon zest on warm seaweed gele, smoked and caramelized eel.  This has layers and layers of flavor.
-Appetizer: langoustine ravioli with truffle, cream and chopped cabbage
-1st Main Course: Black Cod with a yuzu daikon velvet puree
**after the 1st main course, I was pretty full.
-2nd Main Course: Duck and seared foie gras with sweet and sour cherries, fresh almonds.  This dish was very delicious, but again, I was full at this point, I could not finish my plate.  I still had a piece of foie gras, and almost 2 pieces of duck left...I had to tap out.
**we ordered some hot tea to help us stay awake.  When we were ready, the cheese cart came by.
-Fromage:  So many different cheese!  Our awesome server brought out some fruits for us to enjoy with the cheese.  He was also kind enough to write down our favorite cheese on a piece of paper for our future reference.
-Dessert 1: Strawberry Daiquiri with yogurt sorbet and pop rocks - yummy yummy joy joy for my tummy.  Who knew pop rocks will elevate such dessert...GENIUS.  I loved it.
-Dessert 2:Raspberry milk mousse, spiced raspberry sorbet, earl grey puffed rice krispies and pistachio foam.  Ahhh, the pop rocks...oh wait, I was going to write about the Dessert 2...it was different.
-Mignardises: Finally, the dessert cart.  Unlimited amount of macarons..all the items on this cart was just delicious.  Our server knew how stuffed we were so he packed us two small boxes filled with delicious chocolate delights in them.

Before we left, they gave us a gift bag with the menu, rosemary bread, and a booklet of Joel Robuchon Restaurant, with Chef''s bio, menus, etc.

Joel Robuchon at MGM Grand has to be the #1 Restaurant on my list.

I wanted to like this gym. I really did. It's gorgeous, after all, and their salespeople do a great job of talking it up. 

First off, I have a very busy and ever-changing schedule. This probably made me a poor candidate for this gym to begin with, as their hours and classes are limited. Anyway, I visited the gym in April and was impressed with the sales rep, the facility, and the quality of trainers. I had very limited time that day (the story of my life!), so I filled out a little card (I did not complete any membership paperwork) and left to carry on with the day.

In May, I began the stressful and lengthy process of home buying and got even busier! David Barton Gym began charging my credit card, and I was fine with that.

Come June, I'm still absolutely slammed and haven't been able to get to the gym. At this point, I had been getting repeated phone calls from these clowns asking me to come in and fill out the paperwork. With everything I had going on, David Barton Gym wasn't a priority. I was fine with them charging me the membership fee. I had no issues. But what did they do? They threatened me. They started telling me that I would be charged MORE because I hadn't filled out the paperwork...

Long story short, I decided this wasn't the place for me due to bad customer service and asked them to simply stop charging my card since I had never officially become a member anyway . I didn't ask for any refunds whatsoever. What did they do this time? They refused to stop charging me unless I filled out the membership paperwork. 

Huh? OK...well, long story short again: Silly me capitulated and signed the membership paperwork along with the cancellation paperwork at the same time, again never asking for a refund. However, David Rivera (who is great, by the way - I feel sorry that he works for that company because he deserves better) insisted that I accept a refund for May. That was a nice gesture. I kept telling him it wasn't necessary, but he insisted so I finally accepted.

Fast forward to July. No refund from David Barton for May as promised, and I didn't really care at that point. I had closed on my house and was in the midst of cleaning, preparing, and moving. It had been a CRAZY two months, and the David Barton Gym was the last thing on my mind.

When I finally got a chance to get my files in order after the moving process, I discovered that David Barton Gym had never STOPPED charging my card! I was in possession of cancellation paperwork that indicated no further charges would be made after May, yet I had charges for June and July.

Making a long story short for the last time, it's August 14 and I STILL haven't received a penny back. I'm left with the conclusion that this place condones fraud and tries to get away with it whenever possible. The General Manager, Greg Refner, has no customer service skills (and no desire to serve or be fair to people) and certainly no urgency for anything...unless it's getting someone to sign membership paperwork under duress. 

I am really appalled at the way in which this entire debacle was handled. I'd suggest staying away from this place at all costs, no matter how glamorous it may seem.

I was in Scottsdale for 1 night and the local Yelpers on Talk suggested I check out Pomo, so I dropped by for dinner and to add a Scottsdale Pizza joint to my Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition.  I was solo and there was a 15-25 minute wait for a table.  I didn't mind and waited until my name was called.

After a 20 min wait, I was seated.  My server's name was Michelle and she was very enthusiastic and helpful.  After browsing the menu, I decided to get the Don Alfonso (Tomatoes San Marzano DOP, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Italian Salame Piccante, Italian Sausage, Roasted Bell Pepper, $14.95) and a glass of house Cabernet ($6).  The Pizza is Napoletana Style....Google it if you don't know what it is.

After a short wait my Pizza was brought out.  I took a bite out of the first slice and instantly became a fan!  The Crust was soft and chewy and the ingredients were fresh....it reminded me of the Pizza I had in Napoli, Italy.  I finished the entire Pizza and still wanted more when I was finished.  The middle of the Pizza is soft and wet, so if you don't prefer your Pizza this way, don't come here.  You'll be missing out on some great Pizza though!

After dinner Michelle suggested a dessert.  I went for the Bigne Al Cioccolato (Cream Puffs Filled With Light Pastry Cream and Drizzled With  Chocolate, $7.95).  I'm glad Michelle suggested it, because it was fantastic!  The Cream Puffs were excellent and the Chocolate wasn't too heavy....just the way I like it!

Overall, it was an awesome dinner.  I'm glad I listened to the local AZ Yelpers.  Can't wait to come back.

Return Factor - 99%

Came here for dinner and left disappointed. It was a 15 minute wait to be seated which didn't bother me, but there were plenty of open tables and booths. We ended up being seated right near the entrance in front of the window. After asking to be moved to one of the other open tables we were told it would be a longer wait. WTH??? Our server was great, but running around taking care of too many tables at once, so I guess they were short staffed. 

I ordered the "Chopped Salad" priced at $13 and it had chopped romaine and iceberg lettuce, salami, cheese, tomatoes, avocados, cucumbers, celery and croutons. I asked that the red bell pepper and Italian dressing be left out. I wanted just extra blue cheese dressing, but my salad was tossed in the Italian dressing anyway and still had blue cheese dressing on it. I don't have an issue with the cost if the salad since it was a nice portion and had a lot of yummy sounding things in it, but all I tasted was a big pile of chunky bitter blue cheese, celery and really gross Italian dressing. Hubby had an overpriced $22 burger combo and said the burger tased frozen. The peanut butter shake he got I shared with him and that was actually good. I would just skip this place and go down the street to Tacos El Gordo!

A twenty dollar sandwich got me a red room upgrade, a sick view of Bellagio Fountains, a roll away bed, and a DAMN good time in Sin City!

Its quite simple actually.  Simply fold a twenty dollar bill in between your credit card and ID and ask if there are any available upgrades.  Obviously a little small talk is in order.  Use your charm and personality, but more importantly don't forget the magic words, "we'll take care of you!" to help seal the deal. 

All you really have to do is ask for what you want and let the sandwich do the rest.  Ask for ridiculous upgrades like a indoor gym, a penthouse suite, or mirrored ceilings.  Anything to make them laugh and break up the monotony of checking in boring tourist after boring tourist.  

After some small talk, you'll see them banging away on their keyboard.  Continue to chat with them and let them know how excited you are about the weekend and that all you want to do is have a good time.  Heck, invite them up to have a drink and let them know that you think they're awesome. TRUST ME...It pays to be nice!

Before you know it they'll show you a picture of the red room and let you know that its typically a $40 upgrade per night but for you its on the house.  If you're really nice and he or she likes you, then they'll probably ask if you need a roll away bed ($30 upgrade) and late check-out too. I took advantage of both, with a total savings for a 2 night stay reaching a whopping $110.  Can I get an Amen!

The TDS (twenty dollar sandwich) will pretty much work at any hotel or club so use it wisely and you'll be livin large baby!

It makes me sad to write this update, but it has to be done.

My very good friend Brenda celebrated her 50th birthday yesterday and she wanted to do two things to celebrate it:  have her favorite VPN pizza down the street at Village Square and then have her favorite chocolate cappuccino here at Sambalatte.  Simple, right?  Well, no, apparently not.

Anyone who knows me knows that I've been a big fan of Sambalatte since it opened.  I've been coming here for a while and I even introduced Brenda to this cafe and to my favorite drink, the chocolate cappuccino, which then became her favorite drink.
Now, I'd noticed already on prior visits that if you arrive close to closing time, your drink will be served in a to-go cup, which I thought made sense because they were about to close in a few minutes.  However, we arrived at precisely 7:54pm and they were closing at 9:00pm.  When Brenda placed her order, she was told that her beloved chocolate cappuccino would be served in a to-go cup. 
 "Why is that?" Brenda asked.  
 "Because we're closing in an hour.  It's the owner's policy," replied the Samba lady.
  "OK, but it's 7:54," Brenda replied. (We know this because the three of us all checked our cellphones right then.)
 "It says 8:00pm on my clock," "says the Samba lady.
  "OK, but it's only 7:54pm AND it's her birthday,"  I chimed in.
  "Sorry, but it's the owner's policy.  We can't change it. If we serve the drinks in the porcelain cups, people hang around."

Is this not a cafe?  If we wanted to-go cups, we could have gone to one of the chains.  If you don't want people to "hang around," why are you in business?  Is it too much trouble to wash your cups at night?
Now we know.  Brenda placed her Sipping Rewards card on the counter, we turned around, and went to the cafe at Tivoli Village.  They served us pleasantly and Brenda got her birthday chocolate cappuccino just like she wanted.
This may not seem like a big deal to anyone but us. Brenda just wanted to enjoy her drink with the leaf design and hang out for an hour as she's done on several prior visits.  There are lots of people who love Sambalatte as I have. They won't notice that they lost us as customers. I get it .  But, you don't treat loyal customers like that, especially if they're my friends.  End rant.

Afternoon with my daughter who was feeling under the weather and decided some good hot tea would be a good remedy...of course a honey toast wouldn't hurt either :) The cool Asian hipster coffee bar is a nice change from our usual Starbucks stop.
Plenty of seating with power strip along window tables and walls to encourage plug ins.
A small dessert display with a few tempting treats left. Menu is hand written in chalk and prices are mom & pop shop prices... $7 for a pot of tea...hmmm this better be good.
Be sure to download the Epoxy app, it works as a mobile stamp card. You get 1 free after 9.
My daughter ordered a pot of hot Fiji tea. It is brought out to our table in a pretty glass pot with a tea light holder. Fragrant green tea with delicate notes of papaya and pineapple. Soothing warm comfort, but a bit extravagant at $7.
I wanted something cold so I got the green SerenADE. It comes in a cute bottle with a cork cap and the most refreshing drink of green grapes. Why is this drink not on more menus?? It is like drinking summer in...so light and an "ahhh" in every sip! I would definitely get this over and over again. I can't wait to try the red SerenADE made with red grapes.
The honey toast was a legendary Yelp favorite that had me drooling as soon as I saw the pictures. Heck yes we were trying it!! Fluffy bread, vanilla ice cream, honey, butter...these are 4 of my favorite things. It was good...really good. Toasted cube of bread with a buttery soft center and a big scoop of vanilla ice cream with the added gooey goodness of honey drizzled all over. Yes, this was a sugar overload but my sweet tooth took over and then all that was left was a small puddle of vanilla ice cream among scraps of bread. I think my daughter managed to get some lol. We came home and both sugar crashed.
My wife got jealous we went without her, especially after seeing our pictures. So like the good wife I am, I will make the sacrifice and take her this weekend :)

My son in law & daughter treated myself and his mom to a Mom's night out down at the Celebrity Theater.  Now this review isn't about the show we saw, but more on the venue. 

I have lived in the valley for 13 years and never knew this place existed, crazy right?

We arrived an hour early so we went down into the club area and son in law & I had some drinks, this is a cool little waiting spot, it did fill up quickly, but didn't feel over crowded. 

Then the doors opened, and I have to say, I enjoyed the set up, we were only 6 rows back from the stage, but after looking around I can't honestly say there isn't a bad seat in the house, and this is a smaller more intimate venue where the stage turns, so everyone can get a great view.  

The seats were comfortable, the show was great. I truly enjoyed my night out with them! Definitely will be checking the event calendar to see what acts/shows will be coming because I don't mind going back!

I AM HUGE!  

This would be another great opening for a "that's what she said" zinger. But, at this buffet there is no denying that my stature was indeed grandiose.  Everything's served in miniature crockery, pans, fryers, cones, and cups.  I truly felt like the jolly yellow giant in jack's miniature string bean kitchen. 

This however is where the rubber meets the road and smaller in this case is not necessarily a good thing.  Because the portions are served in smaller individual servings, they tend to dry out pretty fast if you fail to get things as soon as they're put out.  While there were numerous items to choose from, over half of them were just too dried out or hard, which included:
- The pork belly sliders.
- The mac 'n cheese was too dried out and not cheesy enough.
- The al pastor tacos were quite disappointing and also very dried out (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=bTym4e_dO56vo_I-X0jVSw).
- The Prime Rib was a bit rubbery.
- The Korean short ribs were chewy and in par with the quality of a young dong tofu house.
- The salads a bit wilted and torn.

The miniature dishes that were really good:
- The miniature fryers of sweet tater fires (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=jeUB9sk3TPj5gLBViw6WFw).
- The creamed corn and red wine braised mushrooms were surprisingly tasty.
- The Pot Roast served in a miniature Dutch oven (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=gQSN3CUgWdMXuDi814bwRA).

I think the highlight were the desserts. And they were numerous (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=gYly1GSdQl1ivFLbLUS2FQ).
- Metallic-colored egg shells that were filled with egg crme and topped with miniature macarons (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=F4Tl5-voNvQV2OnOP_m1Vg).  
- Gelato, gelato, gelato - so many flavors to choose from and taste.
- Hundreds of cups of filled purees, creams, and genache of vibrant colors and tastes.  Some good, and some bad (almost like what were you thinking kinda bad).
- Chocolate covered strawberries were great.

I think we caught the dessert guy in his off day; very grumpy and stern.  However the help switches out often and you'll probably never see this guy anyways. 

So it was great to finally experience this miniature world and truly feel like a giant.  The prices are actually quite reasonable; $21 for Lunch and $29 for Dinner.  Food wise, this was a solid 2.5, but given the price, it's a 3.  But this is Vegas and Buffets are numerous.  So on to the next one!

FABU-nothing-LOUS-than-five-stars!!

Palazzo, you were so good to us during our Vegas trip! Let me count the ways...

1. The large suite was SAH-WEET!! 3 LCD TVs in the room (including the bathroom), one for each one of the Three Miss Yelps. Swank and modern decor. Velvet chaise lounges and sofas in our sunken living room for us to chill and use as fun props in our impromptu photo shoots. The beds were so comfortable, and the blackout curtains could have made us sleep until 3pm if some of us didn't have such precise internal clocks.

2. The service was top notch! Our request for extra goodies for our room were accommodated quickly, and a follow up phone call from the concierge was made to make sure we received everything we needed. One of the concierge, Angie, was so sweet and helpful. If it hadn't been for her recommendations, we would have missed out on dining at Okada in Wynn and Koi in Planet Hollywood. The doormen were also all super friendly!

3. The hotel is gorgeous! The newest resort/casino on The Strip, it offers the finest amenities, shopping and dining. Nestled between the fabulous Wynn and Venetian resorts, we were able to walk to each one easily (cabbed it to all other casinos, which is usually $10/way). The pool area is beautiful, and if you rent a cabana, it comes complete with a flat screen TV.

4. The room rates were a steal! Our 2 queen beds suite was a mere $209/night. Although wi-fi was not free, it was only $10/day. 

5. On our final day in Vegas, we decided that I would try my luck at the tables. We scoped out the blackjack tables, and as we were walking by, one of the dealers, Damion, asked us how we were doing. I got a good vibe from him and the rest of the players so I joined in. $15 minimum to play, I dropped down $40. Damion and the other guys at the table were super friendly and fun to play with. They even let me stay in the game when I only had $10 left. The player to my right gave me $15 of his chips to keep me alive when I lost my last chips. I walked away from the table 15 minutes later with $90!! You can call me Lady Luck. ;)

When we first moved here six years ago, we really liked going to Flo's. Their dishes were tasty and interesting to the pallet.

The two of us came for a late lunch and thought wow, things have gotten very expensive and the food was just okay. 

I agree with everything my friend Marvin A wrote in his updated review just a few months ago. http://www.yelp.com/biz/flos-scottsdale-3?hrid=TJuxgsGDqv6OjBCHJk7gpw   Also, my friend Scott D brings up some very good points as well. http://www.yelp.com/biz/flos-scottsdale-3?hrid=l4MSDHKXs1IDBvKn1TjaHQ  So I call your attention to both of their reviews. 

It seems Flo's no longer has a Luncheon Menu, only smaller portions of their regular dinner menu. We decided to start off with some pork Pot Stickers for $5.00. We were vanquished, so I decided to ordered two (if only to have some for later, or so I thought). These however were minis, barely half the normal size (see photo) and bland

Our lunch entrees were Chicken with Cashew for $9.00 and the Chicken Asian Peanut sauce over noodles for $11.50 (photos). Both were okay, just not memorable as we remembered eating in Flo's in the past. 

We were saddened to see the direction Flo's has taken. There is no je ne sais quoi anymore. So our return factor is pretty low, though we might give them another try at some point. 

Our lunch bill came in at $30.50 and our server Irene, was very good and kept our water glasses filled. So two and a half stars and barely "A-Okay". Now, where have you taken Flo?

Bachi has a breakfast restaurant?! What!! Obsessed with Bachi Burger as it is, and super disappointed by their ramen, I'm glad HLK lives up to the Bachi name. 

My friends and I are fatties and had the Bella farms foie gras de canard (torchon, jelly, marcona almonds, cornichons, cranberry walnut bread) as a starter. Delicious! It has a pretty thick layer of duck fat on top as well. Yeah, as disgusting as you may feel thinking about eating straight up fat, who cares? Spread that stuff on! 

I had the wild mushroom hash (potato, kale, gruyere, egg, fried onions, bechamel) as well as the corned beef hash (potato, brussel sprouts, onion, egg, bechamel) . No, not all too myself, I'm not that much of a fatty. Disappointed a bit, because none of us were asked how we wanted our eggs cooked. On both hashes they came over hard, which I hate. I love runny yolks, don't take that away from me! Especially on a hash. But other than that, they were both delicious. Corned beef had good flavor. 

Friend got the braised short ribs loco modo ( two eggs, fried rice, onion rings, orange lentil gravy). Looked bomb. Meat was tender. Braised for thirty six hours. 

Also tried the crispy sweet chili chicken and waffle (apple bacon, brussel sprouts, green onion waffle, curry butter). Chicken was very moist, and the sauce on it was delicious. Unfortunately they only put it on one of the pieces. Waffle was ok. Butter ess definitely the high point of the waffle. You get three choices of syrups (maple, coconut, blueberry). 

Overall, good experience. Great service. Thanks Adrianna! Definitely a come back spot.

Welcome to Part II of Dallas G's Improving My Life series.

You may recall in Part I of Improving My Life I reviewed Whole Foods. I talked about how I stopped drinking (haven't had a drink in over a month, which means my Yelps will no longer be funny) and switched from a vegetarian diet to vegan, which is going on about 2 months. I'm even considering a raw food diet. We'll see. 

In Part II, I'm going to be ridiculously effusive about Amen and the Amenzone Primal Workout. 

The deal with human fitness, at least for me, is that you don't realize how far you've let yourself go until you start working out rigorously and discover through pain, but hopefully not injury (be careful!), that you're not 18 anymore. Like many of you, I have several extra ELL BEE ESS's. I'm not obese, but I'm not the lean specimen of lady lust induction I'd like to be... In fact, my problem has been that my life was too good living with a mediocre body. My bird likes a man with a belly. And I still manage to have many wonderful friends despite my paunch. I AM FORTUNE'S FOOL! 

But I realize I'd be happier if I LOVED how I look naked. My sizable head could swell even larger. And most importantly I know I'd feel better because I've been in really good shape once before and it's amazing. 

So here's the meat:

Amen is a HIGHLY charismatic, energetic gentleman who is the creator and 5:30 AM inspiration for me and about 15-30 others of a "primal" workout that involves no weights, no machines, and no B.S. 

We use old tires. We use our bodies. Sandbags. It's intense. It's draining. It's honestly the greatest way you can possibly start your day. Almost every day of the week he offers some kind of training. There is now primal yoga. There are high intensity before and after lunch sessions. You can hire him for some one on one brutality. He has trained professional athletes and yet he's not gonna make you feel like an asshole if you can't physically do something. 

The first session is free. it's $20 for a drop in and if you buy a package it's about $15. So what's your health worth? I highly suggest you check it out. During my first session I had to quit with ten minutes left. It's seriously intense. I've since been able to finish but it's still as challenging as the first time. I've just learned to pace myself. If you are totally out of shape and haven't worked out in years I suggest talking to him about easing your way back into it. 

Seriously, try this. Thank me later.

Main ingredient, oh how your deliciousness overfloweth, and your food ain't bad either!

After getting suckered into a lunch with the guys from work, we flipped a coin and ended up aimed from The Main Ingredient. Let me tell you, there are worse places to end up for lunch. I wasn't sure how, but the coin was flipped between, Main Ingredient, Cartel, AND Upper Crust. I didn't realize there were 3 sides to a coin before, but apparently there is. 

I was torn between the Mac & Cheese and the the Red Goat. After some convincing my buddies and the waitress helped me land on the Mac & Cheese. Although, you can't really compare apples to apples here, being that the Red Goat is a salad and the Mac & Cheese is; well, Mac & Cheese, I really was torn. Let me tell you now, this was the beginning of the end for me, and I haven't looked back since. After that first bite I made an executive decision; I would be taking a vacation from my normal diet. Don't worry diet, we'll get back together someday soon, just not today and likely not tomorrow either.

The Mac & Cheese here was like a lasagne of good ol' hometown delicious cheesy goodness, expecting to see a piled scoop of cheesy noodles, I was pleasantly surprised! Cooked with loads of cheddar cheese and topped with green chile, this was pure Mac & Cheese bliss.

In real downtown Phoenix fashion, Main Ingredient is tucked into a renovated home, redone to give that home / cafe feel. Many of their dishes are served with a crispy crusted soft and extremely tasty bread and on a side note, ask them for a side of olive oil for dipping it in. Better for you than butter and in my opinion better tasting, and it adds a little European charm. 

Here's hoping your next coin flip ends all you up at Main Ingredient. Happy Dining Yelpers!

Over-priced, over-salted and thoroughly unimaginative. Package those adjectives up in a pretty little nutshell and you've got Arcadia Tavern. Arcadia Tavern is a family-friendly, bland and inoffensive, if not overpriced, alternative to Applebee's or TGI Friday's. 

I was seriously enthused when a tavern opened up within a five minute walk of my house. I like drinking and I like walking. Combine the two and you get stumbling, which can also have its high points, ripped jeans notwithstanding. But Arcadia Tavern is no tavern. No self-respecting tavern can commit the cardinal sins of happy hour and retain their integrity.

Cardinal rule #1: Thou shalt not end happy hour before 7 pm. 

Seriously. What is it with places trying to redefine Happy Hour as the hours between 3 and 6 pm? I understand that from a price point perspective the 3-4 or 4-5 pm hours are much cheaper than extending food and drink discounts to the 6-7 pm crowd. But I consider that the same as shining up a turd and calling it a custom made gift. Ooo, you offer three hours of happiness? Pity I can only make 15 minutes of it. 

Bottom line is 5 pm's whistle blowing time, gridlock makes a girl crave a drink and 6-7 pm is the prime hour for getting that drink on. To end happy hour before 7pm pretty much guarantees happy hour barflies will not frequent the establishment.

Flipside: Three dollar Dos Equis, all day, every day. At least there's that.

Cardinal rule #2: Thou shalt offer more than frozen food and canned items as appetizers, and if offering cheap frozen crap, it shall be reflected in the price. 

Fries, tater tots, onion rings, wings, mozzarella sticks, chicken strips, and the ubiquitous spinach and artichoke dip? Whoa. Don't strain yourself, TGI Friday's. 

My main gripe is with the monster nachos. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills, but the chips, seasoned shredded chicken and nacho cheese were all wicked salty. We're talking mouth-puckering, tastebud-slaughtering salt laden nachos topped with canned pickled jalapenos (gross), black olives (more salt) and black beans (respect).  I'm also biased against the unnatural plastic consistency of nacho cheese. It makes everything soggy and is a tacky substitute for the real deal. Cheese should crisp up around the edges and pull apart in delectable strings, not ooze sadly over a mass of chips and overpower everything else on the plate. I will say that the guacamole and pico de gallo that topped the nachos were delicious, tasted homemade and were a saving grace, but they were also woefully underrepresented compared to the macnasty nacho sauce. 

Flipside: The three mini sliders (albeit meager) and grilled veggies platter with hummus showed promise. 

Cardinal rule #3: Thou shalt provide affordable drink and nosh.

So what's that nacho monstrosity going to run you? Twelve bucks. Don't blink. You read right. Twelve dollars for salty garbage. Mozzarella sticks? 7. Dozen wings? 9! Completely unrealistic. Shave a couple bucks off each appetizer and you're in the reasonable price zone, particularly considering the cheap tasting ingredients. Taking that first impression into account, I don't think I'm going to shell out 10-12 dollars for a hamburger (without fries) when I could go to Delux and have my socks blown off with flavor for cheaper or to the Chicago Hamburger Co. for pennies in comparison. 

Flipside: There is no positive here. For the caliber of food offered, the prices are completely unrealistic. Even the desserts are overpriced. Six bucks for a root beer float? That's a big middle finger right there.

Arcadia Tavern, as a representative of the Happy Hour enforcement squad, I hereby declare you undeserving of your title. Four Peaks is a tavern. The Vine is a tavern. Icehouse is a tavern. Hell, even Carlsbad Tavern does it better and they have plastic bats hanging from the ceiling. 

I regret that I shall never again spend a happy hour in your warm embrace. Although you may still win me over with $3 you-call-its on Thursday after 9 pm. Particularly when accompanied by a little goldfish racing. 

I totally hate goldfish, too. At least share that in common.

Ah, Vegas. The life of excess. And, holy shit, did Encore do it right. Everything about this casino is amazing, from the smell pumped in through the vents, even to the cocktail napkins - which are by far the best cocktail napkins I've ever seen at a casino. That's why it's so fitting that their steakhouse is named after Botero, an artist whose signature is very, very rotund people in his paintings and sculptures.

Yes - I gave the shrimp cocktail place in Vegas five stars, I even gave the OC Fair five stars. So why only four at Botero? Well, because I also gave five stars to Del Frisco's in Vegas, and the steak and experience here just didn't match it.

I must say though, the decor of the restaurant is pretty damn cool though. With all the tables set up around one of Botero's largest sculptures or one of the largest ladies. We ended up seated right next to her ass, which made me feel better about myself with every bite of my calorie overloaded steak. Even the silverware is custom made to have that plump, Botero-esque feel.

Now, let's get down to the food and drinks. I had the ribeye with chimichurri on it, which was...pretty good. But you know what, I really should have gone without the chimichurri it didn't add anything good to the steak. What was absolutely delicious though was the mac n' cheese. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this was the absolute best mac n' cheese I've ever had in my life. I doubt this is the sort of establishment where you could just go in and order the mac n' cheese, but if you could....this would be on my list of stops in Vegas every time.

The desserts all seemed to focus on presentation more than taste. But it's actually kind of fun eating a bon bon lollipop after a schmancy dinner. (Just don't remind yourself that you paid $22 for a few bon bons.)

Worth the $300 pricetag for a dinner for two? Sure, you're in Vegas. You're damn right it's worth it.

Thumbs Up:
-Fab art from Botero as far as the eye can see.
-Your self esteem will skyrocket if you're seated next to the fat lady sculpture.
-Mac N' Cheese. Holy mother of god. Amazing.
-Of course, amazing service. You're at a Wynn property. Duh.

Thumbs Down:
-You know, it's really not bad, just as far as Vegas steakhouses go - it's not as good as Del Frisco's.

Have you ever looked at the every day girl that rings your order up at Starbucks, or the semi-cute chick at the bank and wonder what they would look like topless and shaking their money makers on a stage? Is it just me that has that kind of imagination? Anybody? Well, if you have wondered about that, go to Bandaids to find out. 
I had the opportunity to visit Bandaids and I don't regret that I did. We were allowed in after a quick bag check by a bouncer. Another bouncer was nice enough to get us a few tables front and center stage. The service was good and fairly quick considering the number of people in the bar. Some of the guys are a bit pervy of course...offering to buy drinks or lap dances for you in the slight hope that you might be interested in giving them a private dance. No winners that night! Besides, I was there for some boobage! 
The women of Bandaids aren't perfect, they don't have fake boobs, they don't have perfect bodies. They are every day women that happen to strip for the dough. I wasn't left panting over any hotties unfortunately, but I was impressed at the bravery of some of the women that got up on the stage and worked it. I felt A LOT better about my body after going to Bandaids and seeing some of the girls there. 
Will I go to Bandaids again? Yep! It's a chill place and the girls aren't pushy and I didn't feel at all uncomfortable. It would be nice if they improved the bathrooms for the girls, but that's a small detail. Just hover and you'll be fine! I guess you could say I'm a fan of the dive bar and we were treated very well there. Is it a fancy Scottsdale strip club? Nope. It's your friendly neighborhood strip club to grab a beer, see some boobage, and move along.

I love the 51 because, many years ago, I managed to lose a police helicopter that was following and tracking me with it's spotlight, in the middle of the night. I felt like James Fucking Bond 007. First of all because I have 0 respect for law enforcement officers and their Nazi-like "just following orders" arrests of people for victimless crimes, followed by locking them in government cages. Second of all, because I knew that the statistical chances of me ever being tailed by a Police helicopter and managing to lose it, at any time again in my entire life, approached 0. Third, because I spontaneously adapted an idea from an entirely different field.

Story time! Pull up a chair.

The setting: mid-late 1990's. Perhaps around 1996, 1997, when there was massive construction going on, on the 51. I lived downtown, on Roosevelt back then. Roosevelt then was NOTHING like it is now - most foot traffic was crack heads and transvestite hookers. But whatever, I'm from NY and I felt right at home. We're a tough breed. 

I had spent the evening visiting some people who were friends at the time -  if you remember The Congo, after it turned into the first Internet coffee house ("cyber cafe") in the Valley - it was the couple that made that happen.

It was late at night. I was driving home, tired. I just wanted to get home and into bed, so I was speeding. A lot. Next thing I know, there are light flashing all over my car. I look behind me and see nothing. Roll down the window and look up, thinking I'm about to be abducted by aliens in a Betty and Barny Hill type scenario. Nope! Just the Popos! They had their spotlight on me and were ordering me to pull over on the megaphone. 

First thought: Oh shit. I'm going to jail tonight. I had probably been smoking some high grade indoor sensimillia or something similar all evening. I know, dumb to do that and drive. I'm much more responsible now, so if you want to give me a hard time for being a dumbass at the age of 23, go right ahead and I'll probably agree with you - I was a with an outsized ego because I was... a computer programmer at the time. Sounds dorky but unless you've been in that world, you have no idea of the massively exaggerated sense of self worth a kick ass software developer can have. Now that I truly am that awesome, I look back and laugh. ;)

Anyway, I digress, Back to my police problem.

Brainstorm! Amazing what the chemically altered mind can come up with. 

I've always had an interest in military tactics and strategy, even though I never joined any army. I'm a history buff, and it makes history come alive. Only I didn't learn this tactic by reading about ancient armies prepping the battle field, or reading about their troop formations, or reading one of my all time favorites, Sun Tzu. I learned it by watching the Robotech and Macross cartoons. 

I remembered a tactic called Fokker's Feint, named after a German WWI flying ace. In a nutshell - you're being chased. You gain speed but then slow down rapidly, before your opponent in the dogfight has a chance to respond. He zooms past you, you get behind, and now he's in your gunsights.

Since my car wasn't equipped with heat seeking missile launchers, lasers, or other cool accessories, just a CD player, shooting it down wasn't really an option. 

Instead, a plan came together. The best part was, I realized that if it failed, they'd have no idea of what I was trying to do, so I had nothing to lose. Go big or go home! Or in this case probably directly to jail, not passing go and not collecting $200.

At the time, the 51 was under construction Well, lucky for me, this construction involved a long stretch of the 51 that was just ahead of me having no street lights at all. Also, there was an exit coming up - if I recall correctly it was somewhere between Northern and Bethany Home.  I'm thinking Glendale, but as I mentioned, I wasn't exactly sober and this is going back a ways, so I don't recall.

Calculations going through my mind: I am going fast. (prob 90+). Helicopter going same speed. Tracked by helicopter with spotlight, which uses my headlights to tell where I am. Street lights which illuminate the freeway - off. I have one chance to do this right.

I sped up another 15 MPH so I was going past 100. Helicopter speeds up to follow, megaphone guy goes nuts, telling me to pull over. Then.... as I approach the freeway exit.... I turn off the car headlights, slam on the brakes, and pull off the exit. I watch as the helicopter zooms right past me, down the freeway. It then starts circling the freeway to figure out where I went - I watched, parked with my lights out in a parking lot right off the freeway. 

My windows were rolled down and I'm pretty sure I heard helicopter guy drop the F bomb over the megaphone. I waited for the flying pigs to leave, then took city streets the rest of the way home, careful to drive the speed limit and obey all traffic laws. 

Whew.

Wow, generally speaking, this is probably one of the most crooked places I've been to in Vegas! Please note, do not buy the Groupon here, you will get hoodwinked!! I've never had so much trouble using one until I came to this spot.

First, I would like to say that the employees are not at fault for the confusion, I think the owner of this location is the main culprit in the poor customer service. They are creating ridiculous rules for their customers. So the groupon is for 5 for 10. On my first visit, the tall guy wouldn't add tax into the total price of the meal. I was like "fine". I was able to macguyver my ordering until the total before tax was 9.98. They guy was like "our minimum is 10 dollars before you can use it" I was thinking "what a great way to nickel and dime your customers"! The tall guy was rude and confrontational to a customer in front of me.


The next day, I came back to use up the groupon and fortunately the tall guy wasn't working at that time. I wasn't impressed with the food during the last visit, so just decided to order sides and dessert. I was then told that I could not use the groupon because it was not a "food item"....
...
.......
..............

So ice cream and sides aren't food? Apparently not I guess. He then told me the groupon is available only for the numbered items, 1-14, on the menu, no sides, drinks, salads or anything else..

I was about to bust out my Cris Carter, "Cmon man!"
The shorter guy with glasses proceeded to apologize saying those are the rules set by the management there. I understood.

Food wise, there is nothing to talk about here, everything is mediocre. Very bland and disappointing. I do have to say the Rose tea was really good.

I've done the math here. Mediocre food + shady, non-customer oriented iron handed management with a concern only with a bottom line = 2 stars!! And I thought I was being generous. In the words of Terminus "Never again".

My friends and I were ready to party, and decided to hit up Haze, just inside the new Aria/City Center. With the VIP passes in hand, we lined up and waited about 15 minutes before entering. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T64FH66qs4EN0d0ds2f5fw?select=AUKfTd2nLQcqk8Mn1hqc4g  I was impressed at how orderly the lines were, as the ropes separated the lines for the Girls, Guys, and VIPs or Bottle Service. There were bouncers, who answered questions and directed people where they should stand.

So, we have been the first to enter, but didn't mind since we scoped out a place to get situated as we opted out of the bottle service. Check out the tables with the bottle service http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T64FH66qs4EN0d0ds2f5fw?select=HuQqKeF5rkkcSQ-JpftF-g  

Club wasn't as big as I expected with two floors, with the smallish dance area on the first floor.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/T64FH66qs4EN0d0ds2f5fw?select=Ok_8epfJHBDz0ZLOOP0VmQ
Music was decent, with a mix of hip hop, r&b, etc., and my friends and I busted a groove. It eventually did get super packed and hot, so Li and I decided to mosey over to the downstairs bar area. There we hung out with our friends, and proceeded to even make new ones who were kind enough to buy us drinks :0  From what I recall, the wait for a drink was never longer than 5 minutes.
 
Bathrooms are clean and has all the girly necessities (hair spray, mints, etc.,) and thankfully, there was never a long line. 

Haze is a cool club, and the week before Leighton Meester made an appearance, and the day after I hit up Haze, Common was appearing. Duoh, talk about bad timing. Fail! Oh well, whatcha gonna do?

Anywho, I had a blast with my friends (old and new) and stayed out partying til 4am. I recommend getting the VIP passes and lining up early. The fellas should be prepared to pay the cover. As with most LV bars and clubs, drinks are not cheap. However, you might be lucky (like a few people I know) to not have to drop any cashola for one drink the entire evening.  

Cheers and party on til the break of dawn!

Eating at a buffet is all about choices and 500+ items automatically makes it 5 stars and the greatest daily buffet in Vegas history.  If you can't find at least 25 things you enjoy here, you might want to consider seeking professional help.  

They really excel at a lot of the buffet staples like pizza, sushi, and fried chicken.  A stand alone restaurant could be set up on each of these dishes and they'd average at least a 3 star Yelp rating for sure.  But you gotta love the unique food items like handmade tortillas, lamb chops, ribeye, ramen, kobe sliders and THEN the dessert section good lord!  My advice would be to check that area out first so you have some idea of what you may want to try before going for that 5th plate of Peking duck with a side of pasta.  I am not saying all the food is 4-5 star quality but Bacchanal Buffet is pretty amazing as a whole.  

Avoid peak hours or try to find a gambling degenerate friend with a 7-star players card to avoid the line completely.  I was there on a Wednesday night at 8pm and the line wasn't long at all.  

Bravo to Caesars Palace for finally having a buffet worthy of their resort!

So I tried going to Drais MDW. That was a fail. I shall literally break it down.

It was after midnight Saturday night when I text the promoter Kim Paul, asking him the price for entry that night. $30 for men, $20 for women is what he said. So awesome. We were set to go. Everything else that night was over $100 for men.

We reach the cashier. Chelse, blonde, thin, early 20s. My girlfriend pays $20 cash for herself. Left is me, 1 other girlfriend and her boyfriend. I was going to pay with my card and they were going to give me the cash. So she rings me up for a total of $70. Sounds right: 20 + 20 + 30.

No. She says "now what about her?" (Referring to my friend right beside me). I said "yeah, $20, $20, $30." N she looks at me like I'm stupid. "No it was never $30 for men. It was actually $40 and that was before guestlist which closed at midnight so it's $50." I tell her "the promoter Kim Paul just told me it was $30. So I want my money back." She says "sorry, there are no refunds" all super bitchy like she owns the place. Lol. So I said "ok well bring me a manager on duty." She says "sure."

Comes back with another doofus and after I explained the situation, he said nothing. Just went to tapping on the screen. After 10 minutes, I get a "void check testing admission" receipt but total said $0.00. I ignored it and left assuming he should've known what he was doing. I'll check my account tomorrow. Silly me.

So here I am back in California calling everyday asking for a manager. On Monday I was able to reach Victor Drai's assistant. Woman. Don't recall her name. She took my name and phone number and also check number from my receipt. Of course they aren't going to call me back, so I call once a day asking for Victor Drai not knowing he was the owner. Just hoping it was the person who would post void the transaction already.

Well he was not happy to hear from me. He answers with his strong Moroccan egotistical accent "how the fuck did you get my number" and "what the fuck do you want" and "give me your fucking number my assistant will help you, not me." So I say "well she's the reason why I call asking for you because she was not able to help me." He says "you're making that up" and again "I'm not going to help you. Give me your number. Do you want to be fucking helped or not!?" I respond with a "Wow you are ridiculous" and he clicks.

I call back and finally a normal person answers and asks how did I get Victor's number. I simply said I didn't. They transfer me when I ask for him. So he new guy gives me the general manager's email so they can help me. I pray to God this is the end of it.

By far the worst customer service experience ever.

In the ever evolving world of sandwiches, many claim to produce the best sandwich in the world.  Among the contenders are the likes of Capriotti's, Mendocino Farms, Which Wich? and many more. Among this iconic list of sandwich makers, there are droves of fans and haters alike.
But make no mistake, The Earl of Sandwich makes some of the most addictively good sandwiches i've enjoyed in a very long time! Tack on the competitive prices and it makes it even better! So it's safe to say i'm a fan when it comes to the Earl's cheap & tasty eats!


The Original with Roast Beef - 
The bread was excellent! As soon as I grabbed the warm bag in my hand, I knew I was in for a toasty treat!
The bread was perfectly crisp on the outside yet warm and fluffy on the inside. Not thick, bread-y, dry & spongy like most other places. The roast beef was piled high and it was juicy and full of mouthwatering flavor!

Jerk Chicken Sandwich
Filled with generous portions of chunk grilled chicken breast (not sandwich meat), red peppers and of course a good helping of zippy banana peppers, this zesty lil number was quite flavorful and surprisingly juicy (considering it was chicken breast!) but my favorite has to be the original for overall mmmmmm mmmm mm factor!

Dessert
Brownie Cream Sandwich
Imagine two chocalatey rich brownies sandwiching a decadent layer of sweet vanilla frosting...yup it's insanely rich and sweet! I advise you to purchase a glass of milk with this decadent number cuz you'll definitely need it!

Service was nifty & quick and they got us in and out in no time flat! Don't forget that all toppings are free with the exclusion of avocado, so pile it high if you so desire! And did I mention the prices? Only 6$ for a delicious hot sammie! That's a steal for a great sandwich on the strip I might add!

With that said, it's a no brainer...if you're out after the club looking for some awesome late nite eats or just strolling the strip, give EoS a try, you won't be disappointed!

Happy Eats!

Hmm, where do I put Jinya... That's the million dollar question. But after careful consideration, I believe 4 stars is accurate.
This is probably my toughest place to review, so bear with me...

First time I was here, I ordered the tonkatsu assuri, their cheapest ramen at 7.90. I thought the flavor was ok, but it didn't blow me away. My friend ordered a veggie ramen, he said that he liked it a lot, but I thought that was ok.

I came next during their HH and sampled the world renowned Jinya bun and crispy chicken, aka karage. Things were starting to look up!! The Jinya bun is a pork belly bao, and probably ranks up there with Wendy's ribeye bao. It's grilled with a delicate BBQ sauce, and it is extremely tender, and the fat is nice and melty. It's a little pricy at 3.00 during HH. The karage is a great deal during HH. This isn't your normal, popcorn chicken sized crispy chicken. These are 5 large hunks of chicken, that are super crispy and moist!! So good! I do have regrets of not ordering the quinoa salad that a neighboring table ordered, it looked very appetizing.

On my last visit, I was feeling full from a late lunch so I decided to get something small so I ordered the small pork chashu bowl. The best part of this bowl was the rice, it was perfectly cooked. I was disappointed in the pork chashu. It looked like the leftover bits from the Jinya bun meat. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great, there wasn't a lot of fat on it, but it wasn't dry. Overall, I thought it was kinda bland.

The service here is really good. They really do a good job of taking care of you. The ambiance is really great, especially the large communal table in the center. I don't know if this would be my go to ramen spot, especially with so many unique ramen spots in town, but it has a great vibe and would be a fun hangout spot with friends.

You know when all your friends and their friends' friends have been to a cool joint and you're the only one that's never been? Well such as the case with Hash House A Go Go. My ears were burning for days when my friends were mouthing off about this place....the ginormous portions, the food coma afterwards and how their leftovers would last them for days back home....blah blah blah. 

Then they said Adam Richman from Man V Food went there. Say no more. We are going to Hash House A Go Go.

My friends warned me that service was non-existent at this place. Well luck was on our side because our waiter was pretty attentive during our entire stay. 

The menu was extensive and their breakfast menu in particular was impressive. I never made it past the House Hashes. I was really tempted to try the Sage Fried Chicken (cause it was Adam's favorite). My friend ordered it and honestly it didn't look as appetizing.....as my Corned Beef House Hash (came with crispy potatoes). The verdict for the corned beef order after the initial taste test was just okay. I personally like my corned beef minced (not hand shredded). Then I had a bite of my other friend's Chorizo House Hash. Let me tell you that is the winner. I would probably order that again my next visit. 

The portions were big but the waiter did warn us all the House Hashes were "normal" size. The biggest portion I saw was the Sage Fried Chicken. Even that dish I expected to be even more behemouth in size based on what my friends were raving about. Sometimes it's better not to hear the hype and you can make your own conclusions. 

*I was really angry that they don't have any restrooms in the restaurant. I had to run downstairs back into the casino.

Good consistent casual Chinese food at a great value. 

Located close to home, China Tango is on the corner of N Green Valley Pkwy & Pebble Rd. I've been meaning to write them a review for some time, so here it is. Whether I've dined in, gotten delivery or carry-out (I've done all three numerous times!) I haven't been disappointed with their food, service, and overall experience. It's been my go-to spot for fast, affordable Chinese food.

What I love:

- No MSG. Enough said.
- They offer brown rice. Healthy!
- Generous portions. Cause we're hungry people! Or we just love leftovers.
- Lunch specials are till 4pm. Who can always fit lunch before 2pm?
- Lots of vegetables. Crispy veggies too, not the gross wilted ones you get at other places.

They have all the traditional orders, from chow mein, sweet & sour pork, orange chicken, honey walnut shrimp, fried rice, hot & sour soup, it goes on and on. Prices range from $7.25-$9.95. Lunch is from $5.95-$6.50, which includes fried or steamed rice & chow mein & egg drop soup (dine-in only). Complete family dinners start from $24.95 & they serve Thai tea or fruit smoothies with boba.

Most importantly, they've always been timely. Food is served fast, carry-out is ready, and delivery is always punctual. 

Tasty, affordable, reliable. It's not gourmet, but it's fresh, clean Chinese for a great price! I'll be back soon :)

I try my best to stay away from the "Del Webb" side of Lake Mead, but there are a few places that pull you in. The area nearby this Smith's is an age-restricted neighborhood so you will find mostly older people shopping here. There is a reason that this location has won in the Best of Las Vegas more then once. The deli and bakery are what brings me to this Smith's. I do a majority of my grocery shopping at a nearby Von's as well a store in the NW part of town, but when it comes to bread, cheese, and sandwich fixings, I know this is the go-to place without having to drive far. 

The "Kosher Experience" is worth a trip here alone. I'm addicted to the challah rolls! If you are looking to get fresh bread from the kosher area then arrive early because it goes fast. 

In the bakery they have some really yummy breads. I decorate my own cakes so I haven't tried any of the cakes or cupcakes, but the breads are why I love this bakery. They have a nice selection and the employees are so nice about slicing your bead loaves for you, or double bagging your bread if you plan to freeze it. They have a "Jalapeno Cheese Bread" that is so tasty. Also, they have old fashioned butter pound cake!

The deli offers Boar's Head meats. The "Maple Honey Ham" is my favorite! Hubby likes the "Top Round Pastrami" and it smells and tastes so good. While you are waiting at the deli for your order, take a look behind you at the variety of cheese they have to offer. I just want to grab a loaf of bread and sit there and sample it all! 

If you shop at Smith's without a *Fresh Values Rewards Card* you could be missing out on some good deals. I have had mine hooked to my phone number for years so I don't have to look ridiculous with cards hooked to my key chain and can just enter it at the check out. With the rewards program not only can you save on weekly specials, but you can get discounts towards gas and prescriptions too.

You guys have heard all the hype. All the awards, national media attention, the famous chefs of the world saying how great this place it. Now after a couple of visits I can confirm with all of them, LoS was probably one of the best meals of my life!

I've read a lot of reviews about many of the other Thai places in town. And, a lot of people would rather chose those spots to eat at, rather than go to LoS which they feel is overhyped. I've been to a lot of those places as well.. So what's the conclusion? I don't think this place is overhyped at all. I believe that LoS deserves every single accolade it has received. It probably deserves more..

Places like Komol, Weera Thai, Pan Asian, Archi's etc. etc., they make really good, in fact, they make really great Thai food! LoS is completely on an entirely different level. For example, take the classic, drunken noodles. At all the great Thai restaurants, they all make excellent versions of this dish, and they each have a common trait that says "this is drunken noodles." At LoS, it still says  "this is drunken noodles", but it's totally different from every one I've ever had in my life. And, I mean different in a totally amazing, uniquely personal, life changing sort-of-way... That goes for EVERY dish on the menu. Also, if you haven't had the crispy prawns, do try them, quite possibly the best thing I've eaten this year (them prawn shells..)

Whenever I eat at a restaurant, I always come in with an open mind regardless of what others have experienced, positive or negative. This restaurant isn't just one of the best restaurants in Vegas or the entire country, this is a world class restaurant. This restaurant will continue to rack up the accolades, and deservedly so. Well done Lotus of Siam.. Well done!

Two and a half years and another dozen visits since my initial review, StripSteak remains one of the top new American steakhouses in Vegas.

For starters, do not pass up the foie sliders.  This signature dish is topped with a tangy pineapple chutney and sweet onion jus that perfectly balance the richness of the foie.  Incredible.  The Kobe beef carpaccio, finished with south east Asian flavors is delicious.  Different from most, the coconut and Thai chili focuses the flavor of the raw beef and brings out its natural sweetness.  The duck confit spring rolls and Maine lobster fritters are also worth a try.

Sadly, A5 grades of beef are no longer offered.  The most flavorful of their current steaks is the American Kobe rib cap.  Sublime beef flavor.  Heady umame from the wood burning grill.  Great texture.  Add a side of roasted marrow bones and you're in beef heaven.   (I promise I don't eat liver with fava beans and a nice Chianti). 

Non-beef mains?  Who knows.  You don't go to a steakhouse to eat chicken or fish.

Desert?  No room.

The wine list is outstanding, with a lot of gems from around the world.  Vegas resort pricing except for more expensive bottles where the markup is low.  

Very Important:  The typical guest at this hip steakhouse has a lot of, how to put it,  disposable income.  The sommeliers try not to insult guest by asking how much they want to spend but rather make recommendations based on the caliber of the first bottle selected.  Save yourself the grief, Speak clearly and tell them what you want to spend.  Its not fun to be presented with an unexpected four figure wine tab.

Service remains excellent.

Highly Recommended

During a 2+ hour layover in PHX, we were headed to La Madeleine to get soup for the wife when we saw the French Onion Soup on the menu here.  Since we can do "La Mad" back home, we said what the heck and stopped in to Zinc.

Now, as everyone knows, French Onion Soup is general served with a "crouton" on top, on which the cheese melts.  But if you're gluten free like the wife, they'll just melt the Gruyre cheese right on the top of the soup-filled crock.  Even though it would probably have been more fun to be able to have the cheese on toasted bread on top (poor wife), she was pleased with the soup.

And speaking of Gruyre...  The truffled Gruyre Zinc Burger was as amazing as it looked.  Five stars right there.

The dessert we chose was some sort of chocolate bread pudding/cake situation, with a side of ice cream with "house made caramel sauce on top".  Eh.... Fairly forgettable (we didn't finish it, even splitting it between the two of us... well, wife could only have the ice cream).  Maybe pastry isn't their strong suit.  

Overall, it's pricy because of the airport premium, and it's trying a bit too hard to be a "bistro" (which for some reason, makes people think they should charge 10% more).  And we didn't have to wait very long for our food, which is necessary in an airport.  I was pretty happy with my burger, "frites", and beer, and there were plugs available between the tables to top off the devices. 

3.86 stars.  Which for an airport dining stop, is pretty darn good.

My friend and I came here during Memorial Day Weekend. We came during the transition between brunch to dinner time (but we paid dinner prices) so it was really nice to be able to eat a bit of everything. 

I remember thinking it was a very decent price for a Vegas Buffet... but then I was not too impressed when it came down to the food. 

I just gathered a bit of everything to take *a bite* and the only thing that I really enjoyed was the lobster mac and cheese, shrimp cocktail & crab legs!! After the experimental plates, I just filled up on the expensive stuff to get my money's worth!! 

I also wanted to try the prime rib, but my friend said her slice was over cooked even though she asked for a medium/medium-rare cut. I saw all of the meats and it DID look too over cooked so I passed on the prime rib. What a disappointment... 

I was especially unsatisfied with their dessert selection... I gathered all the pretty desserts that would fit on a plate: macaroons, eclairs, tarts and a chocolate covered strawberry... but it was all so mediocre... Most items only got one bite from me. I took a double taste on the flan, but I was still not impressed. The only dessert I finished was this Cappuccino shooter (minus the whipped cream on top).

It's been almost a year since my last review and thought it was time to share an update with my fellow Yelpers :^)

======Smoky Goodness Alert========

Be prepared to smell smoky goodness upon entry of Pork on a Fork!!  It is highly addictive in intoxicating, so dinners beware!  

Pork on a Fork has the BEST PULLED PORK sandwich in Phoenix and maybe even the best in the entire Universe!!  Sure their might be a few other places that have better BBQ Ribs, Brisket and/or Smoked Sausages, but Pork on a Fork is as good or better than most at these and the are the BEST at Pulled Pork!  

You can not beat their Pulled Pork Sandwich, which is HUMONGOUS~ almost enough for two people!  It's so moist, tender and with a nice aroma of smokiness you'll want it for for yourself! It comes with two sides.  I recommend their tasty seasoned waffle fries and their BBQ Beans!  These BBQ Beans are cooked in Heaven ~ sent by angels down to earth and given to Pork on a Fork to sell to their customers!  :^)  Well, maybe that's a stretch but their BBQ Beans are soooo tasty full of bacon and brisket burnt ends with a great balance of seasoning. 

If you have tried Pork on the Fork yet, you don't know what you're missing.  Once you've tried them for lunch, you'll find yourself wanting more and caan't wait for your next visit!  I hope to see you there.

Gluttony at it's best!!

This is an AMAZING deal!! On a weekday, it's $50 (with total rewards card; $55 without the card) for 24 hours of food!! if you have rewards credits from gambling, you can use it to pay for your buffet! I used mine and got my gluttony pass for FREE!! On the weekend, the rate goes up... $75. the timer starts the very minute you buy it. I suggest starting at dinner like I did to get the most for your money. I probably wouldn't also do this deal on a weekend as the main thing I notice about the weekend is champagne with your meal and since I don't drink that, I do not want to pay extra for it. 

Anyways, the buffets included are (1) Spice Market @ Planet Hollywood, (2) Le Village buffet @ Paris, (3) Flavors @ Harrahs, (4) World Carnival @ Rio, and (5) Paradise Garden @ Flamingo. For a SURCHARGE of $10 you can eat at Village Seafood Buffet - TOTALLY worth it!!! For a SURCHARGE of $15, you can eat BREAKFAST at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers; for a SURCHARGE of $20, you can eat LUNCH at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers; for a SURCHARGE of $25, you can eat DINNER at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers. 

If you want to eat at Caeser's, which is a VERY good buffet by the way, I suggest just eating there WITHOUT the buffet of buffets pass. I think the surcharges for Caeser's is too high, and that's probably due to how popular it is at the moment. Lunch there is $30 on a weekday and $50 for dinner... go during lunch and time it for dinner. The only difference I noticed with cold crab legs...

Anyways. it IS worth it to add the Village Seafood buffet. For my 24 hours of gluttony, I ate dinner at Spice Market ($30), breakfast at Le Village ($20), and dinner again at Village Seafood Buffet ($40). I wanted to really fit in a lunch, but woke up late and ended up having a late breakfast that didn't end will about noon already... otherwise I would had gotten more for my money's worth. In the end, I spent $60 for $90 worth of buffet... and if I had woke up in time and timed my meals better, I would had even gotten more of my money's worth!

I think this is a great deal for food!! Since you have the pass, go during off times to avoid lines and not waste time waiting... Next time I do this, I'm going to get in 4 meals!!! It's also nice because if you are craving a snack, you can also just stop into a buffet, grab some drinks and dessert just because!

If you eat like a bird however, then this is not the deal for you!

People love to rag on Desert Sky Mall, like it's an American Idol contestant or a homeless person. Like your criticism is essential to its existence.

"It's too small. They have nothing good. It's so cheap and dirty. It's a shit mall. You're better off going to Arizona Mills or Arrowhead."

Like the people who drive all the way out to Westgate and still manage to muster the inanity to complain of how it isn't Scottsdale, these same jibbajabberers clearly have no grasp on the area and its economic status. They don't live here (surprise), and make a point to mention EVERY TIME they visit the west side how much they hate it.

Yeah, fuck you too.

Sure, Desert Sky is ghetto. Because IT'S IN the ghetto.

There's a reason so many people take the bus to this mall. It's not because they're environmentally aware. 

To better illustrate the socio-economic climate of Desert Sky, I have prepared a neatly compiled bullet-point presentation. 

* At any given moment, one or more stores in DSM is going out of business. Some don't even make it over the 6 month hump. So if you see something in that smoke shop you really like, better get while you're there, because next year it'll be a perfumery. 

* They can't even afford decent food court food. Other malls have Orange Julius and Hot Dog on a Stick. They get Flaming Wok (who carries the exact same menu as Panda Express but still manages to somehow be less authentic) and a Subway counter staffed by seemingly invisible sandwich artists. 

* And you thought the "free samples" guy at your mall was annoying. DSM has the most aggressive kiosk workers in all of mall-hood. Their cell phone plan is such an affordable value that they're willing to barrel through other patrons and ambush you behind signs and walls to let you know how awesome their deals are. Sure, you didn't want that sugar-coated nut, but at least nobody was injured in the process. Except maybe the underpaid workers whose nut-harvesting skills were exploited by their cheapskate employer. 

* It's pretty common knowledge that one of the department stores (hint; shares it's name with an island and a type of blue-colored liqueur) will issue you a store credit card on the spot. No application process. No waiting period. No wonder everyone comes here packing heat. All these people in holey shirts and torn up jeans walking out of stores with brand new stereos and speakers, their faces shifty with looks of guilt and/or disbelief. 

* The "special attractions" here blow. Business is so bad the caricaturist is closed on weekends. ON WEEKENDS. I went to the mall yesterday and the Santa they brought in had ONE kid waiting in line to get their picture taken. One. People can't even afford to TELL Santa what they want for Christmas. Woe upon the world.

* The Steve and Barry's here is closing down. How FUBAR'd is the economy when not even the combined endorsements of Amanda Byrnes, Sarah Jessica Parker, and the WWE can sell your 9 dollar jeans?

* I have on more than one occasion been asked by fellow patrons not to eat my Pretzel Time in front of their kids, or they'll be forced to explain to them why they can't afford such snacks. I would have given them my pretzel, but being originally from Philadelphia I douse mine in yellow mustard, and 99 percent of the people I've come across find it repulsive.

* Did I mention that this is one of the only malls (if not the only) in the whole state that can only afford to have ONE story?

So please, before you pass judgment on this calamitous and downtrodden mall, please take into consideration the geography and economy of the area and its consequences on neighboring businesses.

Translation: STFU, n00b.

Three words:  Fuck this place.  If it wasn't for the fact they carry gluten-free/dairy-free coconut milk Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream, Tamari Wheat-Free Soy Sauce, Hemp Milk, Boston  Baked Beans, Brown rice in bulk, Blueberry gluten-free waffles, and a variety of bulk spices and flours, I would never shop here.  With the exception of the checkout clerks, the rest of the staff is not only completely worthless, they are, for the most part, grumpy ass holes.  ESPECIALLY the managers.

I tried doing a special order one time to purchase a case of large bottles of Tamari soy sauce.  Haha, oh what a fail.  They never called me, like they said they would when it arrived, so I finally called to inquire.  "We've got it in", the manager said, "come on down.".  Sweet.  I get in my car, drive down there and what do you know, they don't have it.  Wtf?  The guy looked everywhere and 35mins later, we agreed it was lost and I ordered another case.  Well, 2 weeks later, again, no phone call on their part, I called and they said it was in.  When I got there I asked to open the box to check my order, and what do you know, they ordered the wrong product.  They ordered the low-sodium (which needs to be cooled) instead of the regular.  Fuck it, I took it anyway.

We have had to return four (4) packages of beef that went sour before the sell-by date.  FOUR!  Each time greeted by an unapologetic, seemingly annoyed manager.  We were never offered anything in exchange for our troubles.  The third time I told the guy that not only was he going to refund my $$, he would also be comping my package of fresh beef, which he did, but after a bit of an argument.

A few days ago I was in the store and asked the manager if he had any chocolate syrup other than "Fat-free / Sugar-free" syrup (loaded with Splenda!) and he sort of chuckled and said, "No, we're a health-food store", like a pompous cock.  I said to him, "well, real sugar is certainly better for you than fake chemical sweeter" to which he again chuckled and said, "whatever, I'll make sure to let our people know" in an extremely condescending manner.  I just laughed.  First, this guy can only be described as the opposite of healthy.  Second, their store is FULL of sugar candies, IN BULK!!  Third, Splenda is hardly "healthy" for you.  Fucking idiot.

So yeah, avoid this store, if you can.  Unfortunately, it would be more of a major inconvenience for me to avoid it, so I suffer the pain.  Oh, and don't bother asking a floor guy anything, they're COMPLETELY worthless as well.

Omakase!!
I'm a fan of Chef Nobu and I've been dreaming of dining at one of his restaurant some day. Well tonight was the night

I got a seat at the sushi bar. 
A great way to see the action up front and personal. 

I went with the Omakase (Chef's Choice)
13 cold dishes
3 hot dishes
Desserts

Here's the rundown:
Cold dishes:
Nobu Tako w/ Jalapeo Sauce - a great way to start things off. 

Toro Tartare - Wow, melts in your mouth goodness. 

Toro, Big Eye Tuna, Abalone, Tamago, Scallop w/ Fresh Pickled Ginger - this was the nigiri part of the meal. Every thing was great. Fresh, clean tasting sushi. Yum!!

Amaebi w/ Uni, Egg Custard & Snapper - the shrimp and Uni was ridiculously good. Egg custard was so creamy and tasty. The anapper had a yuzu sauce that was so good (and I don't usually like yuzu)

Xxx salad, Amberjack,  xxxxx - I didn't get the names on the last 3 cold dishes, but they were all good. 

Hot dishes. 
Grilled Diver Sea Scallop w/ Tomato Sauce & Chive Oil - Scallops were perfectly cooked, but that sauce was AMAZING!!

Wagyu Beef w/ Garlic Butter & Brussels Sprouts. OMG!  Melts in your mouth goodness. PERFECT!!

Ramen w/ Crab and Vinaigrette Broth. A nice dish to finish the meal. 

Dessert:
Sudachi Cream, Merengue, Hazelnut and Black Sesame Ice Cream - a Napoleon (sideways). That sudachi (Japanese Citrus) cream was delicious. Hazelnut provided the crunch. A thin chocolate sheet provided the sweetness. That black sesame ice cream is the BEST ice cream I've had in a long long time. It was creamy, not too sweet and the sesame flavor shines through. I highly recommend it. 

Service was SUPERB!
From start to finish, I was pampered. 

For me, one of my dining dreams come true and it lived up to everything I imagined it to be. 

My Rating:
5 Star Plus!! 
Try it for yourself and decide.

I usually only eat Papa Murphy's once or twice a year, but when I do, I enjoy it. I already knew what I wanted when I walked in. In the past, when they have a special promotion going on they have some already made in their cooler to keep the long lines down. This time though my pizza was made fresh right in front of me. I asked for a "Heart Shaped Pizza" priced at $7 and included 1 topping (additional toppings extra). For an additional $6, I added "Cheesy Bread" and "Cookie Dough" to complete the meal. 

Different types of pizza here take different times to cook. I had the original crust so it needed to be baked at 425 for about 12 minutes. The pizza came out nice and tasted good. I baked the cheesy bread at 400 for about 10 minutes and it was pretty good for what it was. If you are going to buy frozen pizza at the store, you might as well come here and get something you can customize for about the same price and it tastes better. The pizza and cheesy bread are baked on the trays they come on, but they do offer instructions if you would prefer the pizza to be baked on your pizza stone or grill. The cookie dough comes in a tub and you bake in on your own sheet. I baked the cookies at 375 for about 10 minutes.

They also offer stuffed pizzas and at home pizza kits for kids.

I wasn't going to come all the way to Pittsburgh and *not* eat a Primanti's sandwich at the original location.  It's quintessentially "Pittsburgh" and apparently one of those things you love or you hate, you revere or revile.

Husband and I made three attempts to eat here.  The first two times, the line was out the door and down the block.  There's not a whole lot of food I'll stand on a long line for, and I definitely wasn't interested in squandering precious vacation time waiting to order a sandwich.  So we came back at 11 on a Sunday -- since this location is open 24 hours -- walked right in to an empty dining room, sat at the bar behind the flat top, and were eating within 10 minutes.

So?

I fall right in the middle of love/hate, revere/revile.  Most places give you fries and slaw on the side of your sandwich.  Primanti's puts them both *between* the bread, along with tomato and cheese.  This makes for a messy -- albeit convenient -- meal.  Husband and I split a tuna salad and the "Colossal Fish," with a huge, deep-fried fish filet.  The sandwiches are incredibly filling, and they were good, but my mind wasn't blown.  It's deli meats and cheeses on bread they don't bake in-house.  Frankly, I think husband and I liked the mayo-less, sweet and sour slaw the best out of everything, even ordering an extra side of it to smother our sammies with.

I'm glad to have had the Primanti's experience.  But I couldn't eat one of those bad boys very often without a cardiologist on speed dial.

Why the heck did it take me so long to come here?  Forte was great!  Being open until 3am is a big plus.  Lisa R's terrific review finally persuaded us to check them out and we actually ran into her having dinner at one of the tables upfront!  It was fate :)

The vibe was really cool.  Definitely don't feel like you're in LV.  They had a one man band doing covers ranging from Depeche Mode to Nelly Furtado in a whole Casio keyboard meets karaoke with an eastern Europe flare that definitely enhanced the experience.

We surprisingly started with a complimentary order of the "Marcona Almond Stuffed Dates".  Apparently they made an extra plate by mistake and our waitress gave them to us on the house.  Most tapas joints execute a kind of stuffed date tapas well but the size of these dates were a lot bigger than normal and the jerez sherry reduction gave it a very unique flavor.  Thanks to the staff for that one.

Our favorite dish was the "Calamares Rellenos en su Tinta".  They were stuffed baby squids (squid in squid) that were marinated and served in their own ink on top of Spanish herb rice.  We were kind of surprised the squid was served cold but it actually worked with the hot rice.  100% getting a double order of this the next time since my lovely wife hogged most of it :P

The "Thracian Clay Pot" almost sounds like a nickname for a torture device in "Game of Thrones" but it was anything but that.  It's a Bulgarian specialty served piping hot served with veggies, sausage with a baked egg on top.  The broth was perfect for a chilly evening.  It defines comfort food.  Some might find the broth to be too sausagey but I was digging it.  We also had the "Bulgarian Mixed Grill" and both liked the kiufte best.  They could Americanize those babies and make them sliders! hahahaha 

We couldn't get enough of their table spice and put it on everything including the olive oil we dipped their amazing bread in.  I asked the server what the blend of spices were and she rattled off a whole list of things in it.  It was so good that I bought a bottle of their home blended spice before we left.

Their $20 bottles of wine rocked too!

Maybe ramen really is the new pizza!  It's kind of mind blowing how I was dying for just one legit ramen joint in Las Vegas only a few years back and now I could do a week straight without going to the same spot.  I'd also have to chug 500 gallons of water during said week but still....

I was looking for a basic, no frills ramen and their "Tonkotsu Assari" fit that bill perfectly.  Our server also mentioned it was his favorite.  Assari consisted of pork broth, chashu, green onion, egg and bean sprouts, but the thick noodles were the clincher for me.  Most of Jinya's ramen offerings come with thin noodles which I am usually not down with although I didn't ask if they would substitute.  

It's a good thing they put me at a corner table since I slurped my face off.  From top to bottom, it was solid through and through.  There is better chashu to be had in town, but this was still a nice bowl of satisfaction.  I'd also skip the salad (dressing was gross) plus gyoza add-on and opt for another tapas dish instead.  

To my knowledge, Jinya is also the first and only spot in Vegas to do takoyaki the right way.  I've had so many awful versions of it since moving from Japan that I had given up hope.  I was delirious after my first bite!  The light crunch, generous chunks of octopus with its signature sauce, mayonnaise and dried bonito flakes put my taste buds on another planet.  It was a terrific dish that I will be having multiple times in the future.  Love that they're open until 3am!!  

Good call with giving only the ladies the nice Toto toilet.  :P

Wow. 5 stars for a grocery store, huh? I've only been to a handful of these elsewhere and haven't found much that appeals to my grocery perusing self. Honestly, I've always thought of Whole Foods as a "window shopping" grocery store. Not the smartest way to utilize one's time, let me tell ya. Despite the astronomically priced goods and somewhat niche, organic, so-local-it-will-make-your-eyes-water type products, these guys earn a solid 5-star high five. Here's why. 

Staff. There is more staff in this joint than you could imagine. I counted 11 behind the cheese counter, 6 behind the fish counter, 6 at the coffee shop, and at least 2 people on each check-out lane. Every aisle had a representative to answer questions, talk up products, or help you find what you need throughout this organic wonderland. 

Local. I love seeing produce and from farms and farmers that are just hours away. There were vendors delivering local salmon, produce, meat, beer, and coffee while people were walking around. It seems that these guys aren't playing around with the idea of "best products for where YOU are" mantra. This does Charlotte well. 

Levels. This place has three levels. First floor is everyone's favorite grocery store. Second is a cafe and third is a cooking school. Yes. A freaking cooking school. That is so rad. They are definitely aiming to be more than just a store where you can buy stuff. The bottom floor is the parking deck. Get this. There are freaking escalators you can ride WITH your shopping cart. Hello, future. This place is just ridiculously cool. 

Although it is a grocery store, I think WF can do some really cool things in Charlotte. I'm looking forward to seeing how the beer/wine bar on the 1st floor impacts the local breweries! So cool to see NoDa, Foothills, Birdsong and Olde Meck on draught! Yes. Draught, local brewskies at a freaking grocery store. Dig it. 

Looking forward to all that is to come for these guys!

Stopped by to check out the place and ask if the ice cream flavors were made with corn syrup (yes).  However, the nice man, whose name is Terry, took the time to tell me about their products, and I became very interested in their custom-roasted beans from Miscela d'Oro.  Terry kindly obliged to let me sample a "cortadito," http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petersens-old-fashion-ice-cream-scottsdale-2?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA#tmGvi9oRu0JNOri3JpKT7w a taste of cortado, a single espresso mixed with (sweetened) milk.  Now, I usually drink my coffee black, preferring to glean calories off of sweet pastries, pancakes, and waffles instead, so I was glad that Terry had not told me that he was going to add the sweet milk-- I most likely would've skipped it!  The cortadito was a beauty to look at and so velvety and luscious, that I savored each and every sip.  After a delightful chat, I continued on to visit a favorite coffee shop nearby and the second of three breakfast stops for sweets.  An hour or two later, I walked back to Petersen's to buy a cup of drip coffee to help me finish off a few more sweet bites.

I'm definitely coming back to have a cortado!  (And maybe buy a chocolate-dipped waffle cone to complement.)

If you want a legit donut then come here to Friendly Donut House! Even if you don't live in the Henderson area, this local run mom & pop business is worth the drive. After hearing so much about it from yelpers and co-workers, I met hubby here for a quick breakfast before work and wasn't disappointed! When I walked in there were several old timers hanging out talking, playing cards and reading the paper. There was this instant family feel that was comforting and inviting. The woman behind the counter greeted us and was patient with us while we made the hard decision of which donut to try. We picked out our few donuts and when I asked if they had any milk, the woman behind the counter said they had regular and chocolate. I was so stoked to see it was "Anderson Dairy" milk! I grew up on that stuff and am addicted to the chocolate milk. Score! The smaller milks were a $1 each. 

So we ended up with a "Bear Claw", "Apple Fritter" and "Cinnamon Roll" that were $1.75 each. The bear claw was filled with apples and it was SO good! I never thought that I could find a place that comes close to my favorite donut shop in Placentia, Ca, but this place does! I split the donut in half with hubby and was pleasantly stuffed. Even though I was stuffed, I managed to take 2 bites of the apple fritter and couldn't believe the apple explosion in my mouth! This was a fritter that had tons of apples in it and all the textures a fritter should have. The cinnamon roll ended up going to one of my co-workers because we just had no room left and wanted someone to enjoy it fresh. How does anybody ever decide on one donut at this place? I will have to go full on and get a dozen to take home next time!

Friendly Donut House accepts CA$H ONLY!

The food here is good and this location seems to be improving with each moving van, dropping off new residents to the former bankrupt Desert Ridge North area. While real estate sales have gone from non-existent at this north Phoenix area, to white hot over the past twelve months. Go figure 

We love everything on the menu, including the appetizers like the soft pretzels, the meatballs (I'll return to this in a minute), their pizza selections are tasty and they also have an extensive beer list.  To top it off, their Happy Hour has most drinks marked 50% off!  So all good, right?  Well maybe. 

As we said, we like the Mellow Mushroom. But on our most recent visit, it was m'eh at best. The big negative for us was the afore mentioned meatballs. 

Sadly, they weren't even half cooked. The plate was ice cold, the marinara sauce was cold, meatballs(photo) were luke warm but pre-cooked, and the mozzarella inside was not melted and also cold. Ugh. 

I've decided to average out my rating to Three Stars, because we like the place and they normally do a nice job. 

So yes, we'll be back. But, they need to get their act together.

I have eaten here recently a couple times. One time the service was shitty and the other it was great. The food gets 5 stars easily. You get what you pay for here. 

Grandma's Meatballs: beef, veal, and pork. Good flavor and easily shared but you wont want to. 

Free Bread: dude came around once with bread and that was it. I wanted more bread! He poured some oil and vinegar for us (a lot of it) and gave us 1 piece of bread for it. That's ok I made up for it by eating all the bread stick thingys that are in the cups on the table. 

Buddy's Salumi and Cheese Board: damn yo this was real good. I didn't care for the olives but I'm not a fan of them anyway. The meats and cheeses I could have ate all day.

Orecchiette and Italian Sausage: This dish had sausage in its name so I ordered it. It was not as heavy as a spaghetti with sauce which was nice. I ate every bite and would order it again. 

Spaghetti Bolognese: I was very surprised to like this. When it came out I expected some sort of red sauce on it but that wasn't the case. My wife took a bite and really liked the taste too. Winner winner bolognese dinner!

Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake: Came with salted caramel ice cream. This was hot and good and everyone should order it. 

Zeppole: I guess a spiced sugar is outside of these but I didn't taste anything but fried dough. I didn't like this.

On a recent trip to Las Vegas we stayed at The Cosmo for two nights. I had stayed there once before and wasn't a fan but had a much better experience this time around. Our room was beautiful. It had a balcony and a huge tub over looking a great view of Vegas. The room was very nicely decorated with a Jonathan Adler feel. 

The gym had great equipment and a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. But they did not offer bottled water, only a water machine with cups, which is not easy to drink while working out. 

There aren't that many breakfast options, which I found frustrating. The main breakfast restaurant had a long wait each morning and the grab and go food only consisted of pastries and coffees. Nothing healthy or fresh. 

The restaurant options in the hotel are quite vast for lunch and dinner. Milos is by far my favorite for lunch and dinner. We also had a nice lunch at China Poblano. 

*Tip: Milos offers food to go, so if you want to eat dinner in your car on your way back to LA get Milos to go rather than having to stop for fast food!

Seems like pubs done by celebrity chefs are all the rage now.  I think it was a smart idea by Rick Moonen to change the upstairs of RM Seafood to this.  It's a really cool space with interesting furniture and displays.  I have no idea what steampunk is though.  I can only imagine Joey Ramone in a sauna.  

We chose to sit at the bar to chat it up with the bartenders and get their opinions on drinks etc.  It was also a treat to see them make some of these concoctions.  I know quite a few Yelpers that love the whiskey and this should be a spot to check out.  I will definitely try the smoked whiskey next time.  Check out some of the other people's pics.  

My wife wasn't into any of the specialty cocktails and opted for the appletini (ha fn ha).  But they used actual apple instead of that Pucker BS so it tasted as legit as an appletini could.  I went with some long titled cocktail called "Mario Warped the something something" which featured egg white, tequila and thyme.  It tasted like a margarita made by a mad scientist.  I also had a bottle of an Austrian lemon beer I'd never had before which was super refreshing.  

The chicken liver pate was just OK.  One of the bartenders tried to build up the fact that the pate was "like in this totally cool jar".  That'd be interesting if Thomas Keller hadn't already been doing that up the street at Bouchon since they opened.  I prefer duck liver pate any day of the week.  I'd skip this.  

Interesting idea with the inside out French onion grilled cheese but I feel like it totally missed the mark on both ends.  I'd rather have an excellent grilled cheese sandwich or a robust and cheesy French onion soup than this combo.  This is a skip too.

We both really liked the Lamb Osso Bucco Greek style.  Two gloriously tender shanks of lamb with orzo on the bottom that was swimming in the lamb juice.  Anthony M's picture of it is way better than mine.

Shockingly the best thing we had was dessert.  2 of the bartenders kept raving and raving about the green tea panna cotta with pineapple and macadamia nut cookie. It was definitely all that.     

I am rounding up on Rx Boiler Room.  It was more like 3.683712 stars but I think some of the dishes we passed on this first go around will be things I look forward to trying soon.  

Hey Rick!  How about a happy hour??

I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy.  Below is a copy of my complaint filed to the Nevada Taxi Authority and to members of upper management at Desert Taxi Inc:

      On the morning of June 22nd, 2014, shortly after 2:00AM, I was leaving the Electric Daisy Carnival event at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.  I was attending the event with my girlfriend (name omitted for privacy) and my two friends from Florida.  I had attended the carnival the night before and developed a severe cold.  My friends ended up staying at the carnival until 5:00 AM that night, but unfortunately, I was forced to leave early due to extreme fatigue from the illness. We left the carnival at 1:30AM, but did not make it to the taxi line until after 2:00AM.
     The taxi that was assigned to us was Taxi #4238.  The car was blue and was decorated with Mirage advertising.  The cab driver looked to be in his 30's, with a very dark skin complexion, short hair that didn't appear to be more than an inch long, but it was curly at the time, and an accent that sounded Middle Eastern.  
     The first thing the driver said to me when we got in the car was "So much how are you going to pay me?"  I noticed that his meter was off, and I asked him, "I will pay you the amount that the meter says I need to pay, but why is your meter turned off?"  He proceeded to say, "It doesn't work like that.  This is a special event.  We do not use meters during special events. We negotiate a price upfront for the ride."  Next, he asked me how much I had paid to get down here.  I informed him that we paid $45 for our group via a private driver/shuttle.  He stated, "Oh no, $45 will not work that is way too low, how about you give me $100?"
     At this point, I knew the driver was trying to hustle me and was breaking the law, but he had all ready driven at least a mile away from the speedway.   He asked me again to pay him $100, and I tried to negotiate a rate of $80 instead.  I did not have much of an option at this point.  He told me that $80 was not enough and then again asked for $100.  After denying his request for $100 for a third time, he slammed on his breaks in the middle of the freeway.  The car came to a complete stop 2-3x faster than what would be considered a safe stopping distance.  We were sitting in the middle lane of the freeway, completed stopped, while he demanded the money once more.  I again, restated that I was only going to pay $80.  He asked me if I was paying cash or credit.  I told him cash, he flipped on his meter, and floored the accelerator.  He proceeded to speak to someone on either a radio or cell phone and was telling them, "This is bullshit. It's not worth it."
     We continued down the freeway for roughly 7 miles when he started demanding that I pay him the money immediately.  I pulled the $80 out of my wallet, showed it to him, and advised him that I would pay him upon arrival.  He stated that I had to pay him immediately.  After denying his request for a 3rd time, he again, slammed on his brakes in the middle of the freeway, came to a complete stop, and told me to "pay him the $80 now or to get out of the fucking car."  With the condition that I was in, I could not take the risk that he would leave us stranded in the middle of the freeway if I did not pay him.  Against my better judgment, I paid him the $80 and he proceeded to drop me off at the hotel.  
     After I got out of his car, I wrote down his taxi cab information.  I noted that the amount listed on the meter was $45.90 when I stepped out of the car.  I called Desert Taxi on Sunday and left a message to speak with a supervisor.  My call was returned on Monday, but I was not available.  I called back on Tuesday, spoke to Larry, and I explained what happened.
     I consider the actions of the taxi driver on that night to not only be illegal, but highly dangerous as well.  By slamming on his breaks and coming to a complete stop in the middle of the freeway twice, he put my life in danger as well as my girlfriends.  This taxi driver obviously has no regard for the law, and his words/actions/threats/harassment towards my girlfriend and I are not fitting of any decent member of society.  I have filed a complaint with the state of Nevada Taxi Authority and will continue to explore other options on how to handle this moving forward.  Due to this experience, I will never take another taxi cab in the city of Las Vegas again.  I will gladly back my statement up in any court of law, and I attest under penalty of perjury that everything stated in this complaint is 100% factual.  This document will be coming from my personal e-mail address.  Please count that as my signature for the document.

I'm such a big fan of Guy Fieri & his shows! 
After hearing that he has his own restaurant in Vegas, I knew I had to check it out!

Definitely that "All-American" feel to it! Live TV, loud music, and a great space! 
Upon walking in, the greeting and the hostesses, I felt, were awkward..
We were seated and our server was Olga. She was pleasant and attentive!

Now about the food..
Portions are big, quality is good, but the items don't scream "to die for"..
We had :
* Java Guava - guava juice cocktail with a touch of alcohol
* Parmaggedon Wings - brined and roasted Parmesan wings served with marinara sauce -- very tender, moist, flavorful wings!
* Triple T Fries - truffle fries sprinkled with truffle served with truffle sauce -- def not as truffley as it sounds..
* Drunken Fish Tacos - tilapia, avocado and fresh veggies -- nothing too impressive..
* Mac N Cheese Burger - bacon, mac n cheese served on a brioche bun -- DELICIOUS!
* Mexican Churros - fried churros with two dips : spicy chocolate & dulce de leche (my fave of the two!)
 
Two other things -- they have big chunks of squared ice in the drinks which lasted forever, kept my water nice and cold! AND the side of ranch we had was AMAZING! Just the little, simple things that topped off the experience!

Overall pleased with the service and food! Wouldn't mind coming back to try the other menu items!

For our 350th review it is only fitting to write one on the Cirque du Soleil Show "O" at the Bellagio.

The "O" is simply "eau" in French meaning water :)

While I have seen a lot of Cirque shows and this was my second time seeing "O", this was Dave's FIRST EVER Cirque Du Soleil Experience! This was also a first viewing for his parents for "O".

In Vegas "Ka" and "O" are my two favourite shows. What I love about "O" is how unique it is and how artfully the show is choreographed with the use of water, music, story and amazing acrobatics.

The opening of the show always reminds me of something I would catch in a Tim Burton Movie.. the beheaded corpse hanging from the ceiling, the somewhat creepy deathly music and tones. That said the show like most Cirque shows has beautiful colorful costumes and an element of comedy. The two clowns that appear throughout the show are "corny" funny. I find the stage very distinctive in its ability to transform into a stage for them to walk on, swim in, dive into and sail on -the depth of water is amazing.

If you like acrobatics, water, music then "O" is a great show for you to go see. We had front row seats so we did get splashed a bit but that was all part of the experience.

Editors Note (Dave):  This was simply one of the best show experiences I've had in my life.  We were lucky enough to be in the front row but we were off to the side a bit.  The front edge of the stage is curved so when the curtain was down, we missed moments of the show while it was going on on the other side of the stage.

Watching the swimmers come out of the water slowly without even a sign of bubbles was a bit on the surreal side.  Their carefully decorated costumes and face painting definitely gave much to look at even at close detail when they were running in front of us just a couple feet away at times!

The whole show was pretty amazing, however, there was so much going on, I wish I had read the program we bought ($15, and worth it) to get a little bit more of the story since when I'm in such an amazement I tend to zone out focusing on something specific.  It will be moments later when I'll realize something else is happening on the other side of the stage that deserves my attention.  There was even a time where I was staring at something happening in the air and the person performing in the water right in front of us splashed us.  I guess they felt they deserved my attention more?!?

I would definitely go again.    I hope I do, at least.

TIPS:
1. Buy tickets ahead of time or online
2. If you want front row seats get them in the middle section
3. Go to the 7pm showing instead of the 10pm if you are not a night owl! 
4. The first few rows are definitely "wet" seats, so don't go in something that can't get chlorinated water on it, but don't freak out, its not a Sea World show.

I came across this place on yelp and wanted to check it out. We used to have some Hostess outlets in the NW part of town (since closed) that I liked and was hoping to find something similar to that in this place. I found much more than I expected! Walking in I was greeted by a friendly cashier who asked if I had been in before. When I told her I hadn't, she went over the different sections and said to ask if I had any questions. They mostly have Entenmann's, Oroweat, Thomas, Grandma Sycamore's and Sara Lee goods, but they also have other stuff like Bear Creek soup and Boboli pizza crusts. I got a loaf of Sun Maid cinnamon raisin bread for just $1.75 and Texas Toast for the same price. Bagels were $1.99 and I picked out some pizza crusts, english muffins and other pastries. The prices here are drastically lower compared to buying these items at the grocery store. Not even Walmart has a "rollback" like this! 

When I got to the register I was given a stamp card. You get a punch for every dollar you spend. Once the card is full you can get a free item by the brand listed on the card. For every $9 spent you also get to pick something free (changes everyday) from the premium section near the front door. I also received a $1 coupon to bring back towards my total purchase for a future visit and the cashier told me I can combine them! The $1 coupons can only be used during the month on them so make sure to pay attention to that. You get a $1 off coupon for every $8 you spend.The cashier said what is sold here isn't leftover stale stuff from the grocery stores like most people think. She says Bimbo is the largest bread supplier and the stuff sold here is leftovers, but fresh leftovers that grocery stores, etc. had no shelf room for. Nothing I purchased was past a "sell by" date and was soft and fresh. This bakery outlet isn't anywhere near where I live, but I work in the area once a week and will make a point to stop and load up on delicious savings.

I had seen this food truck at many a Saturday morning market here downtown, but I never paid them much attention.  Then one day I did because I was really hungry and in a rush.  The result was awesomeness!

But the large posted menu is kind of deceiving.  It presents their 4 standard dogs but doesn't fully speak to the uniqueness and deliciousness of their food, nor does it really give you all your options, which are plentiful.  These are some of the things you should know, that you probably won't realize from their menu:

They come on naan fry bread, not buns.
(Though you can request buns, but that would be silly.)
This does not come across on their board anywhere, but it is the foundational magic of their product.

They let you choose your own wiener.
[insert bad joke here]
They have traditional, veggie, bratwurst, and my favorite: beer-hot.  The beer-hot with the naan is the best combo ever!

They have about two-dozen toppings.
You get a hint of this in the descriptions of their standard-four, but it helps a LOT to see the toppings listed out (plus they have some that don't show up on the standard-four).  They have the list up on a small laminate menu by the window.

Their ingredients are mostly local, and some are organic.

I've gotten a beer-hot w/ fresh jalapeos, swiss, cilantro, and red onions; and also a bratwurst w/ sauted onions, sauerkraut, and spicy mustard.

Bottom line is this truck needs more accessible marketing, because they have a GREAT product!

A theater where I can recline in my chair with my feet up and watch a movie? I'm in! The ticket price for adults is $11 per person plus a $1 convenience fee when purchasing online. You get to pick your seats which I thought was nice. The website is user friendly and once you have picked your seats (hurry because if you wait too long to decide someone else can snatch the seats) and completed your purchase, the seats are reserved for you, so you wont need to worry about getting to the theater in time to get a certain seat or seats together with your group.

Inside they have the typical concession area with popcorn, soda, candy, nachos, etc., but they also have a sausage bar and sell beer and wine. There are separate lines for the concession and sausage/alcohol bar, but the employee at the sausage bar let me get my nachos and soda combo ($12) at her line so we could just pay with one transaction. She was courteous and let me know that customers get free soda refills on the date on the receipt. 

We saw "The Lego Movie" and I was happy with the plush reclining seats. I made myself fast at home in mine! Each chair has a button on the side to adjust the seat however you want it. I liked that when I moved mine it wasn't felt by the person next to me so I didn't feel bad about adjusting it whenever I wanted. The table attached was decent sized too. The screen was huge and the movie looked good. I just about fell asleep I was so comfy! 

There is a parking garage (free parking) or a open lot. If you plan to go to the movies often, you might want to consider signing up for Galaxy Rewards, it's free.

Now let's sing!

I got a reputation around Yelp when it comes to Ramen. I've eaten at every major Ramen-Ya on the West coast, so I got a lot of credibility when it comes to recognizing a good bowl of Ramen. So my assessment is that: SHOKU RAMEN-YA doesn't have a good bowl of Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen...SHOKU has a GREAT bowl of Hakata Tonkotsu. 

Things have changed a lot here in the last month. I came here over a month ago during their soft opening,  and the manager was still training the cooks and servers to be more proficient. Today when I came to SHOKU, everything had been perfected. I have to congratulate the new manager(Ehren) for working non-stop around the clock, and dedicating his whole life into turning this place into one of the best Ramen-Yas in Las Vegas. The flavor of the Hakata Tonkotsu was a world of difference from last month! You can really taste the pork bones and marrow from them preparing the broth all day long in that traditional Kyushu style. 

The Charsu has changed as well. It's very soft, fatty, and tender like the ones you get at Onizuka Street. I loved it! 

Unlike 99% of the Ramen-Yas in LV, SHOKU actually has a Hanjuku Egg as one of their add ons. This is big! This really BIG!  Monta, Sora, and Shuseki only have normal medium-boiled eggs. A Hanjuku egg needs a lot of work to prepare correctly. It needs to be boiled for exactly 7 minutes to preserve it's extremely runny nature, then it must be instantly placed into ice water or the egg will continue to cook itself and the yolk will be ruined.Afterwards it's transferred to a mixture of shoyu, sugar, and sometimes vinegar. It will then be marinated for many hours. SHOKU is the only Ramen-Ya in Vegas that features this style of egg. It's a very rare delicacy here in LV. 

The Bacon Fried rice was the best Japanese fried rice I have ever had. Better than Monta...Better than Yagyu Yakinku..Better than Shuseki. The Bacon Rice here at SHOKU RAMEN-YA is a perfect fusion blend of flavors. It has the buttery qualities of Hibachi Fried Rice(ex-Benihana), but with much stronger and unique added flavors. Because SHOKU is a Bachi Burger spinoff, their cooks do fusion better than anyone. 

The manager of this restaurant told me that in a few weeks they will add Tan Tan Men onto the menu. I was like HOLY SH!T THIS IS HEAVY! Every Yelper knows that Tan Tan Men is my favorite Ramen variation in the world. I've been to every major Ramen-ya on the westcoast and only like 8 of them had Tan Tan Men. For those who don't know, Tan Tan Men is a very difficult dish to master for any chef. That's why there are Ramen-Yas that specifically specialized in ONLY Tan Tan Men. I've been to Chinese-Japanese Ramen houses where TTM was the only thing on the menu because the chef needed to put all his attention in only that one thing. I can't wait to see the SHOKU variation of Tan Tan Men. Ehren is one of the most talented restaurant managers in Las Vegas, and I'm confident that his staff can master this difficult variation. 

I encourage all the Nisei, Sansei, and Yonsei to come eat here, especially if you are from Hawaii. Every Japanese born in Hawaii I have spoken to have told me that SHOKU is one of the best Ramen-Yas on the mainland. There is something about the flavors here at SHOKU that make Hawaiians happy. I know that many of my Japanese-Hawaiian Yelp friends would love this place. 

Also, remember that this is a Kyushu style Ramen-Ya so it would be a travesty to order something that wasn't Tonkotsu. You don't go to a Sapporo Ramen house and not order the Miso. You don't got to a Tokyo Ramen house and not order the Shoyu. You don't go to a Chinese-Japanese Ramen house and not order the Tan Tan Men. And you defiantly should not go to a Hakata Ramen-Ya and not get the Tonkotsu. Tonkotsu is the signature dish of Hakata, Kyushu.

***I do not think the pastries and desserts at Aria's Jean Philippe Patisserie are worth the high prices, but it still one to consider if you are on the hunt for fancy-looking desserts (I haven't loved anything here yet, but there are some good items)***

Aria's Jean Philippe Patisserie has a very attractive display of pastries and individual desserts.  Located right next to the casino, this stand is very versatile.  You can pick up breakfast pastries or individual cakes, but you can also get cafe-esque breakfast items and sandwiches.  They also have a gelato bar as well as a selection of expensive but nice looking packaged sweets (for gifts).

I had a few things.  I tried their pain au chocolat, which was very flaky and crispy.  The chocolate flavor was good though the chocolate bar inside the croissant was too hard.

I also had one of their parfaits, which was gingerbread gelato mixed with hazelnut gelato and then garnished with crunchy hazelnuts and spice-flavored gingerbread.  The parfait was topped off with whipped cream and chocolate sauce.

The parfait was just okay.  The gelato was a little too thick (the whipped cream was also not that great; too similar in consistency to a canned whipped cream though I believe this one was fresh).  Also, while the parfait had a good flavor, I felt there was too much gingerbread in it (and the gingerbread was dense).

Service is not rude or lazy here, but it is consistently slow.  I think part of it is due to a lack of staff.  I also do not think it is the most organized spot.  Another issue is that the staff does not seem to notice when a line is building or when customers have been waiting long.

Prices are very high, but it is Las Vegas.  Still, the pastries and desserts here could definitely be better (especially when considering that some of their more ambitious items can run up to $6-$8 each).

Jean Philippe Patisserie is definitely overpriced, but you can walk away with a good pastry or dessert here.  I have not found anything here that I absolutely loved, but there are enough decent things where it might be worth checking out if you are in Aria and on the hunt for a fancy dessert.

Aria has its own parking structure, which is free.  Valet parking is also available.

Mom and I stopped in to my favorite breakfast joint on the way to the airport.  I decided to try something I haven't tried before, so I went with the Peanut Butter & Cream Cheese stuffed French Toast w/Bananas.

After a short wait, our oder came out.....their portions are enough to feed two people!  I wish they offered a 1/2 order.  Oh well, I did my best to finish this thing, but it proved to be too much for me.  The combination of Peanut Butter and Cream Cheese was awesome!  It was so good I didn't need any Syrup or Butter added to it.

This Vietnamese restaurant is one of my frequent stops in the area. I first discovered this place on Yelp, and since then have tried a variety of items on the menu. The squared-shaped interior is largely dependent on natural lighting. The horizontal layout includes TVs, rows of tables, and a small kitchen in the back. 

For appetizers, I recommend the Goi Guon ($3.95). The spring rolls come with grilled pork, shrimp, rice vermicelli, and peanut sauce. The ingredients were fresh, ranging from the rice wrapper to the contrasting tastes and textures embedded in the middle. For this dish, I often ask for fish sauce on the side. It's a good opener for those who wanted something to hold them over until the main entree. 

The menu consists of Chinese and Vietnamese dishes, but I come here largely for their signature item: Banh Cuon. To me, this is one of the best Banh Cuon I've tasted so far due to the stuffed minced pork and soft fluffy rice crepes. Among the options, I recommend the Banh Cuon Cha Lua ($8.95) that comes with slices of Vietnamese ham, chopped red leaf lettuce, basil, herbs, pickles and fish sauce. I also suggest the Banh Cuon Chao Tom ($9.25) that comes with soft golden fried fish cakes. The combination of fresh and fluffy textures, perfect thickness on the rice crepe, delicious toppings, and fish sauce made this particular menu item a must try for first time goers. 

Their Pho ranges from $7.95-$8.95 per bowl. The lack of depth in the mild-flavored broth was a consistent pattern from each of my visits. Even though the broth couldn't stand on its own, I find ordering those that come with more than one meat item such as Pho Tai Nam Gan ($7.95) and Pho Tai Sach Bo Vien ($7.95) an effective method to circumvent the problem. Their pho also comes cilantro, yellow onions, scallions, bean sprouts, basil jalapeno and lime. The side of veggies is always fresh. I only wished the broth could offer more depth and complexity, especially given the high price they charge on these dishes.

The Bun Thit Gio thit Nuong ($8.95) came with great textures ranging from the grilled pork, bouncy noodles, and fresh veggies. I really enjoyed this dish, but again the prices are simply too high for me to rate this place higher.

Lastly, their Thai Tea with Boba ($3.50) was too sweet with boba that was old and staled. I don't recommend it.

Service was prompt but limited to the extent of taking your order, bringing food to the table, and the bill at the end. Given the strengths and limitations of this place, I'd be very strategic in ordering items that are associated with rice noodle crepes, vermicelli, and quite possibly, the noodle sticks. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their Banh Hoi items.

Lo-Lo's is a nice experience in southern cooking without leaving Phoenix. You can see why everyone raves about the place.

Three of us came here for breakfast last week and really enjoyed ourselves.  The only drawback was that we arrived at 8:15am. Yelp had the opening listed incorrectly as 7 am.  Lo-Lo's  OPENS AT 9 AM! I have posted a updated photo, with the correct times from the front door.

We ordered two coffees and a iced "fruit punch" Kool-Aid for $3.00 each to start. I had the #8 Betty Boop for $8.00. It comes with one piece of southern fried chicken breast, along with a plate covering waffle. It wasn't bad, but mine was a little mushy and didn't stand up well to the syrup. 

As for the chicken, I regret that it was somewhat dry and not juicy. The smashed sides of two sausage paddies for $2.00 was great and it had a nice flavor.  I would come back just for the smashed sausages and Kool-Aid anytime!

My two friends ordered the #14 CJ's, which is one waffle, one egg, and a small bowl of grits for only $6.00 (a steal); and the #11 Kimbo for $7.00, which is two giant waffles. My friend reported that his waffles were cooked longer and they looked golden brown. 

Spending some time in the south, I really miss having Grits. Oatmeal is not the same thing. The Grits at Lo-Lo's are very good. If you have never tried them before, Lo-Lo's would be a good introduction. But skip the cheese on top. The best I've ever enjoyed came with small pieces of bacon in it. Yum! Now, which way is the Mayo Clinic? LOL

Our bill for three including taxes, but before gratuities ran us $34.86. Overall the food and service was very good. I would say Three and Half Stars good, rounding up to Four.

If you're from a Tier1 city on the East or West coast, this city is a major fail.  If you come from, say, Chattanooga, TN, or anywhere equally as appalling such as anywhere in-between Philly and Los Angeles, this city will probably be a step up for you.

PROS:
----------
Friendly people.  Beautiful sunsets.  Beautiful desert scenery.  Cheap rent.  Beautiful weather 6mos out of the year.  Pretty decent Magic the Gathering scene.  Wonderful family.  

CONS:
-----------
A big percentage of people here are radical Christians and loony Mormons waiting for their spaceship to the planet Kolob (look it up).

There are a lot of chain restaurants and you've really got to search high and low for decent eats.  Unfortunately, most Phonecians enjoy Applebees over, say, a great Cajun eatery. 

The music scene is laughable, at best.  When the weekend's headline event is "Hardcore is a Girl's Best Friend", and when you go to a desert party with 2 stages of Hardcore, you know you're in trouble.  The city's DnB weekly draws crowds in the single-digits, and most events, sound-wise, are utter failures.  For instance, bringing out a huge UK DnB DJ then having the sound cutting out and clipping all night, awesome!  Want to hear Glitch?  bawahaha, good luck.  How about DubStep?  woooo!  If you're lucky you can catch the DubStep _monthly_... yes folks, 1x's a month.  Awesome.  There is literally only one weekly that's worth anything and it's the Pound which has been going strong for 1yr.  Sadly, you see the same 100 people at every event worth anything.  So in a city of 5million or whatever, 100 people know and support good music.  *sigh*  Want to hear a sick DJ like DJ Dan, Donald Gladue, DJ Icey, etc....?  Well you have 1 option:  wade through the sea of douchebaggery at Myst filled with the worst of Scottsdale and the Scottsdale wanna-be's with their $200 jeans and $150 bling t-shirts with no clue that a world-class DJ is on the decks.... THEN, you will be sadly disappointed as you watch your favorite DJ spin a watered-down set on a shitty sound system.  Sweet.

Art?  "Hellz yeah we have First Friday".  Yeah, 1x's a month, there's something artsy to do.  Tits.

Public transportation?  Yeah, the people of The Valley voted for the Light Rail project... a BILLION dollar debacle which provides Phonecians a single route from Mesa up to Phoenix, at a cost of $2.50 for a r/t.  Is it cheaper than driving?  No.  Faster than driving?  Nah.  More convenient?  Nope.  Does it go anywhere useful?  Naw.  It serves only a tiny fraction of our population, mainly those that find it "hip" to live in Downtown Phoenix.  How about the bus?  Don't know, I've never seen a bus in Gilbert.

Weather?  Miserable... you are forced to live in an artificial environment 6months out of the year because it's too hot to have a window open, too hot to even go outside.  Sure there's a lot of nice outdoors activities, but you can only participate 1/2 the year.   Don't let people fool you and tell you "it's a dry heat".  I don't care if it's dry or not, 117 degrees is 117 degrees.  OH, and don't expect it to cool down at night.... 100 degrees at MIDNIGHT is actually common.  And btw, it's not always a "dry heat"... most of the summer is Monsoon season.  You actually begin to look forward to the monsoons.

How does Phoenix's weather effect your body?  Well, if you enjoy not being able to breathe, sneezing, watery eyes, bloody noses, burning your flesh on your leather seats, Valley Fever, and respiratory issues, Phoenix is the place for you!

Job market?  Awesome, if you enjoy working for a call center.

Cops?  Super!  We've got the anti-Constitution, racial profiling, show-boating, murdering Joe Arpaio.  If you are caught with even a roach or a stem of weed, you're looking at a trip to Tent City where you can enjoy our 117 degree weather from the comfort of an outside bunk bed under a canvas tent.  If you're brown and working hard to support your family, expect for your place of business to be raided, and for you to be arrested and detained, probably even deported.

Drivers?  The drivers in Phoenix are fascinating to watch and observe.  They paint the perfect picture of mental retardation.  Everyone tailgates here, going 70mph.  I defy anyone to drive 20miles on our freeway systems and not see a rear-end accident.  Multiple rear-end accidents happen daily.  Why?  Because people drive at 70mph literally inches from the car in front of them.  Now any person with an IQ over 70 would be able to understand that if the car in front of them has to stop suddenly, you are guaranteed to get into an accident.  GUARANTEED.  I am baffled and literally astounded at the fact that no one seems to understand that out here.

It had been over a decade since I last stayed at the MGM.  Came here during Yelps Spring break and was hoping to get into one of the newly renovated rooms but I ended up in the regular ones.  It was the same weekend as the Billboard Music award.  Too bad I didn't see any celebs.

We got the first room right off the elevator.  I was thinking it was going to be noisy with all the peeps coming and going and the up and down of the elevator but it was actually pretty quite.  The 2 queens size beds were comfortable and the room spacious enough for 2 people.  Big bathroom with plenty of counter space for all the hair and makeup stuff.  

On the evening of the 2nd day we were surprised with a special delivery of champagne and sweets.  We almost made the guy leave stating to him that we didn't order anything LOL.  Well he got our names right and it was a little something from the hotel to welcome us.  

Im not very picky when it comes to hotel accommodations.  As I don't tend to spend much time in the hotel room.  As long as it had a comfortable bed, a TV, nice size shower with good water pressure Im happy.  That said the one thing I was disappointed about was the WiFi.  It was struggling a bit.

Local ~ On the Strip
Room ~ 2 Queen beds and on the 18th floor.
Stay ~ Clean and comfortable.
Extras ~ WiFi struggled a bit.

It was a Saturday night, my LV partner-in-crime and I were in the Aria Hotel, and decided to dine at Julian Serrano after reviewing the menu. Truth be told, since this resto name somewhat resembles mine (as people have mispronounced and called me by this name along with others- ask me about if you're interested), dining here was really a no-brainer. hah! With no reservations, we chanced it and apparently lady luck was on our side, as there was no wait. 

The warm colors of the restaurant looked so inviting. Here's a pic of the bar area, taken with my iPhone http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=0OlrsQnQXZSPeD5NFJMvmA
From our table, here's a shot of the entire restaurant http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=GblIBlQF3t_da6M1L-zYbw

Everything on the menu looked so delicious, so we ordered (and pics credit go to my girl, Li):
- Beet Salad: Roasted and oh so beetalicious! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=758bzflJcsXww0Lrl4dYeA

- Beef with Brie: Tender pieces, with brie, (one of my fav cheeses). Oh Mylanta, such a digalicious combo, and with walnuts on top, and the savory sauce was divine! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=ILrElkjFRWwhzXsjWWQ8xA

- Striped bass: Fresh fish, cooked to perfection. Delish! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=z4xiwtEsBVbf-jFhDgX7AA

- Creamy Risotto with Mushrooms and Manchego: Mouth watering deliciousness, and so rich, creamy, and cheesey goodness!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=bJAq88XYZOcUhvlGSTUkuA

- Pan Manchego: Spanish Toast with roasted tomato and garlic paste with melted Manchego cheese. All I have to say is mas pan, mas pan! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=HLxPDvdXAqwLErnnHtCVdw

-Chocolate Cake: Chocolate molten cake, which rivals my favorite chocolate souffle at Roy's Hawaiian restaurant. Combined with mango sorbet, and I was in dessert heaven with these two loves of mine.
 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_w5hBpkjHs5_Hv3pLeHtIw?select=Igp440NlqPIVtgwWajkFfw

While we feasted so well, our beverages were refreshing white sangria (para mi) and red sangria (para mi amiga), and later had very 'brave' coffee. We needed the caffeine jolt, as it was only the beginning of a very fun and memorable night out.

Que bueno, Julian Serrano! Beautiful interior, efficient service, reasonable prices, and wonderful food. This is a great restaurant for a date, a small or big group of friends, and perfect for getting the night started off right in Sin City! Viva Las Vegas!!

Good, straight forward fish house / steakhouse.  Best of all, you get to dine in a contemporary "pod" in the middle of Crystals (they call it a tree house, either way its cool).  Unfortunately, because of it's mall location, it doesn't feel like a special occasion, destination restaurant rather  "I'm hungry after all YOUR shopping, oh look, a restaurant, let's eat".

With the exception of a few starters and a hand full of mains, you get exactly what the menu says, unadorned. No special sauces, no veg.  Just fish or beef on a plate.  

Portions are large.  Unless you're hungry, pass on the starters.  They are traditional (raw bar, seafood cocktails).  You can get them anywhere.  

Fish is expertly cooked to order.  The thick cut fillet of pan roasted Chilean sea bass and salmon are excellent.  Cooked medium with no sign of albumin (white substance that comes out of fish if the cooking temperature is too high).  Both were moist and naturally oily, exuding their naked fish flavors.  

Good quality prime steaks.  Decent aging.  Good selection of bone in cuts.   Sadly, nothing sets them apart from other quality steakhouses in Vegas.  The bone in fillet is tender, mildly flavored.  No complaints.  

For sides, its gotta be the rich and incredibly flavorful, king crab and truffle dressed gnocchi or the lobster mashed potatoes.  Chunks of lobster enveloped in a buttery mash that explodes with lobster flavor.  I could eat either an a main and be happy!  

Solid wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.

Sometimes "a kiss is just a kiss..."  and that's fine by me.

What a great place for breakfast! BBD has a very warm, friendly, family feel to it. Cindi was our server and she is fantastic! She took the time to answer all our questions and never let my coffee cup go empty. The coffee by the way was delicious! The menu was on newspaper and there are stories also on it telling the (you are allowed to keep it) story of BBD and other stuff. Most of the food on the menu is made from scratch and it says you can customize your order any way that you like and if they can do it, they will.

I ordered from their "little less" menu which has smaller portions. It was still enough to fill me! For $6.99 I had 1 egg, 2 pieces of bacon, hash browns and sourdough toast. The egg was cooked just the way I ordered it, the bacon had great flavor, the hash browns were too tasty and the sourdough toast was great! Something simple as breakfast is easy to mess up, but they do it right here. I also ordered a "Bear Claw" priced at $4.49 however I was too stuffed from breakfast to tackle that big boy! Cindi packed it to-go for me and said to just pop it in the microwave for 25-30 seconds before I'm ready to eat it. She also said the bear claws are made at each location daily! That bear claw made for one mighty fine dessert :)

Lunch and dinner is also served here at BBD. I have no doubt it is probably tasty, but I'm sure this will me more of a breakfast spot for me since I enjoyed that so much.

Alot of things go into a fabulous experience at a club.

You need a fabulous space.

Fabulous people.

Fabulous prices.

And lots of fabulous space to bust out your fabulous moves.

Tao - was an impressive fabulous space, but the people and number of them crammed into one dance space (the downstairs area was much less crowded, but not much was happening) were short of fabulous, we couldn't score a seat unless we had ordered bottle service, and the price of entry for the guys in our group as well as the drinks once inside were far from fabulous.

So overall Tao was not the fabulous experience we had hoped over.

There were two creepy baths, boasting two naked women sitting in rose-petal water as we entered. Both women looked bored and unimpressed, and at the moment I knew our night at Tao was not looking up. The music was erratic Top 40 stuff, like most of the clubs in Las Vegas, and once we made our way to the second floor dance area, we were bombarded with throes of pushy girls. 

With no room to dance or move, we managed to squeeze our way into the VIP section and ended up partying the night away with some friendly Welsh guys, which helped the night pass a little smoother, but after about an hour and half we couldn't get out of Tao soon enough.

If you're OK not being able to bust out your fabulous booty shake move, cause you'll probably boot out five girls from the dance floor in one shake - you have so little room to move - then come here - you'll probably have a good time. 

But if crowds aren't your thing - ask the locals for a good club recommendation that night - and go there instead.

Trust..

When I was 28 years old, I started drinking alcohol. I'm now 30. Before I started drinking, I had a certain amount of knowledge about the world. Let's say, for example, I had accumulated 28 knowledge points. A mere two years later, I would say I'm at 56 knowledge points. I have learned much more about life than I would have ever predicted. I've gained 700 Facebook friends. I've garnered stories that would make a porn star, new to the industry, of course, blush. It's difficult to shock the DV/DA-hardened veterans (physically impossible btw - if you have video to prove otherwise, I'll pay to see it). I've punished my body with 10 day benders. I've had the shakes from withdrawal. I've known two consecutive sun rises and sun sets with no sleep. A navy seal, I am not. A grizzled drinking veteran, yeah, a little bit. Abu J, I know you're gonna call me a light-weight. I grant you, there is always more to learn. My parents generously endowed me with a hardy appetite for rock superstardom, but selfishly withheld the genes for a functioning musical ear and a giant member. Thanks for nothin, mama. 

(Interesting side note - one of my ex gf's thinks my mom and I are in love. This comes from a woman who communicates with her mom once a fiscal quarter.)

But then Andrew K was in my car one day and he INSISTED we listen to the country station. And a song came on by Phil McGraw... Yup, Dr. Phil.  

I think Ill take a moment, celebrate my age
The ending of an era and the turning of a page
Now its time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord have mercy on my next thirty years

Hey my next thirty years Im gonna have some fun
Try to forget about all the crazy things Ive done
Maybe now Ive conquered all my adolescent fears
And Ill do it better in my next thirty years

My next thirty years Im gonna settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what Im doing here
In my next thirty years

Oh my next thirty years, Im gonna watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers
Maybe Ill remember my next thirty years

My next thirty years will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear
Make up for lost time here, in my next thirty years
In my next thirty years

This song struck me. Right in the baby maker. What a fucking loser I have become... 

I have in many ways downgraded the parts of my humanity that society values. I was productive in my past life. Had a solid career path. A brilliant, ridiculously talented woman loved me. With visceral fortitude, I have displaced entirely the concept of self-discipline. Of a work ethic. The desire to work just a little harder than the schmuck next to me... No, not you Z. But in other ways I love who I've become. I'm charming. I'm easy, whatever you want to take that to mean. I don't judge anyone for anything, except my exes, who I seem incapable of forgiving (just kidding Amber). I find it incomprehensibly energizing to meet new people. On many levels, if I weren't me, I would at least want to be my friend. That's how much I like who I've become. 

So the point of all this... You had to know I would get there eventually, is that I need to find a balance. A balance between where I've been, where I am and where I see myself going. 

Whole Foods is that answer. It is THE answer. They have the right products for me to learn to be a better human. A balanced carbon-based humanoid. They have shampoo that makes my scalp tingle. Soap that makes my privates tingle (BUY IT). They have food that makes my tongue tingle. 

One area that I'm really focusing on right now is my diet. According to the enneagram, I'm an average 7, which is an excessive hedonist. And I've totally been a pig of the epicurean sty... I was an unrepentant glutton. The only thing that kept me under 220 lbs was vanity. Even as a vegetarian. But I've always known, in my little ticker, that I should live as cruelty-free as possible. So, one area I'm implementing discipline is in the diet sector by becoming a vegan. Unfortunately, the selection at WF is so good, I don't even have to employ any discipline. I can eat the same shit I've always eaten and it's delicious and no poor creature had to suffer for it. Life is almost too good. How did this happen?

I could go on. This place rules. I love it so much. Like the love affair I'm having with my mom.

Yummy, yummy, yummy I got Burgatory in my tummy is what I was singing in my head my last trip here...  I should preface that this was the first time I have eaten in at Burgatory, as other attempts were halted due to extreme wait times.  In the past my office has ordered takeout from the Waterworks location.  The take-out was still yummy, but through transportation and whatnot the burger arrived pretty messed up.  So eating in is my preferred method.

Last time there was a real treat as I usually don't get to go out to eat for lunch due to time constraints and this chain they have on my leg attached to my desk, however I was in luck this day.  My Operations Manager was in town that week and asked if he could take me out to lunch to talk about some things.  I happily excepted and strongly suggested Burgatory, so off we went.  

When we got there we didn't have to wait for a table, which is something I had yet to experience with other attempts to eat here.  Seated I looked at the menu and decided on the build your own burger...  I went with the Dry Aged Wagyu, on a wheat bun, with Diablo Dust, Smoked Gouda, Sriracha Remoulade (on the side) with lettuce tomato, onion, and jalapenos.  I like my burgers cooked medium rare, I think Burgatory cooks closer to rare in the middle but that doesn't bother me, but as a tip I would suggest most people would like it a little more cooked.  I on the other hand was extremely pleased.  The burger didn't take too long to come out so we spent the next 10-15 minutes in complete silence as we ate...  Oh so much better than takeout!  This is up there with one of the best burgers I've ever had, and since it's on the boss it was also the cheapest, meaning free.  Can't turn that down ever.  Can't wait until they finish their new location east of the city, 3 miles from me : )

As soon as you walk into T-Bone Steakhouse you jump in a time machine to a much simpler time.  No frills or thrills just your choice of meats or fish cooked over mesquite.  This is a converted adobe and river rock house from the 1920's.  The whole ambiance of this place is old school western.  If you're over 6'4" you'll need to duck inside some spots of the restaurant!  The views of Phoenix from T-Bone's are beautiful.  The only thing that they did not offer which I wish they did was a tour of the converted house.  This place is so out of the ordinary and a tour would make you want to appreciate the place even more than just for their steaks.  

Your meal comes with cowboy beans served up family style for the table along with a visit to the salad bar.  The salad bar is just like this place, very simple.  You will find the bare minimum but it does the trick.  I understand that they're not a proper salad bar and will not complain.  T-Bone's prices for their meals are on the lower end for what you are served.  Can you find a better steak in Phoenix, yes but not at these prices or backdrop.  A good meal with a good view along with good company is a winner in my book.  Our party has a couple 12oz Boneless Rib Eye Steaks.  These cuts where excellent with very little fat but tons of flavor!  We had a 8 oz Filet Mignon, the only complaint is that it was butterflied but a good cut as well.  We also had a Smoked Bone-In Chicken Breast & 5 oz Filet Mignon combo.  The complaint on this one is that the chicken breast does not say bone-in on the menu.  Our table also shared a very warm brownie with ice cream and whipped cream topped with a cherry that the table raved about.  The complaints from our table are very minimal and will not prevent me from going back.  

Do not attempt to drive in their elevated dirt driveway and parking lot in a lower clearance vehicle.  You feel a bit out of place if you're not on a horse.  I am now a fan of this place and can't wait for a "out of towner" to bring here.  I brought my father in-law who does not require much to be happy, T-Bone's did the trick.

Get stuffed!  Literally.

Not health food.  Large portions deep fried or with fat and juices from properly roasted joins, added calories from cheeses and spreads; this is Vegas.  Straight forward British pub grub paired with very well chosen selections of beers on tap.

The carvery is the focus.  Select half or a full pound of the protein, bread and two sauces.  Simples.  Do select heartier breads (sandwich breads turn to mush).  Stick to simple sauces (black truffle mayo or horseradish scour cream) if you want to accentuate the roasted flavors of the proteins.  Proteins themselves are perfectly cooked remembering that this is NOT a Jewish deli.  Outstanding, brisket.  Dripping with juices, deep flavor, just the right amount of fat.  The lamb, cooked mid rare has a mild lamb flavor.  Finally, the duck confit with its good thyme scented backbone.  Moist and crisp when heated.  All good eats.  All sandwiches are accompanies by a crock of pickled root veg.  The very strong acidic finish is required to cut through the fatty goodness of the sandwiches.

Great starters include a simple white wine steamed clams with apple wood smoked bacon.  The fat from the bacon imparts a great richness and flavor to the clams.  The steamed PEI mussels are also very well done.  Tender, just cooked through with a great spicy tomato broth.  The accompanying garlic aioli and crispy fried cherry peppers adds the right amount of complexity and heat to keep the palate alive.

Standard pub fare (fish and chips; very good with perfectly cooked, heavily battered, crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, with a nice side of fluffy chips and mushy peas and the grilled banger and mash with its deeply caramelized onion gravy) are great.

Excellent service bordering on off Strip Vegas local (real people living real lives).

Great energy and pub ambiance.  Crack the peanuts and throw the shells on the ground, bar games for free beers if you can finish in a crazy short time, games on nice and loud and the energy of the guest.

Note:  Outstanding happy hour and reverse happy hour with half off all beers and wine.  

Many, many repeat visits.  Always consistent.

Cheeers!

"I couldn't help it. I can resist everything except temptation."   -Oscar Wilde

After consuming a small salad for lunch at home, Linh L. and I made the decision to try out Green's Tsoynamis around 3PM.  Being part of the 80% of Asians that are lactose-intolerant, I've been wanting to try out their decadent "tsoft tserve" soy-based ice cream.  A short car ride later, we sauntered into Green, the Garden of Eden, and were instantly tempted by the forbidden fruit in the form of a delicious aroma.  I was suddenly hungry and something warm was all too tempting.

"Would you like to see our menu?" asked the hipster-looking cashier.

Yes, Eve.  I would like to see the menu.  Also, I swear you were in the art program at ASU with Linh and me...  Weird.

Even though I really have been wanting to try Green's Tsoynamis since I first stumbled upon a picture of it on Instagram, I've been creeping on their online menu.  Ever since that celebratory lunch at Thailicious with the adorable Brett B. and Linh L., I've been dreaming of peanut sauce.  Naturally, I got the Thai Peanut with house tofu.  While it has great flavor and the sauce coats the broccoli, zucchini, carrots, and fried tofu well, it sadly didn't have a strong peanut sauce flavor.  I suppose I went into it hoping it will taste like Thailicious' peanut sauce salad dressing but that was my fault.  It was still delicious on the organic brown rice and I was full without feeling heavy and gross.  I love clean eats!  Linh had their special "RocknRolled Tacos" with Seitan chicken.  He liked it.  Although we were both full and satisfied from our impromptu late-lunch, where I dearly wished we had Brett B. with us, we decided to splurge and get dessert.

TSOYNAMIS FOR DAYS!  My banana cream pie tsoynami was delicious.  Linh's Dough Boy was also pretty darn good.  It had giant chunks of cookie dough that made my skirt flip [not literally, unlike my time at Fired Pie].  I sat cross-legged in the booth merrily eating my lactose-free dessert while staring at the artwork, the car doors lining the wall, and all the artsy hipster customers and I was happy.  Outside the rain began to fall.  We came, we dined, and we gave in to the temptation that is Green.  Linh even left with a spumoni cupcake.  You guys are good.  You guys are real good.

"When women go wrong, men go right after them."  -Mae West

I think Mae was talking about Green and me.  My wallet is feeling lighter and all is right with the world.  I'll be back.

Feeling like pizza, I called in a order for pick-up. The girl who took my order was friendly and said my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes. I headed over and upon walking in I was quickly greeted by the hostess who rang me up and asked if I needed any crushed red pepper or parmesan cheese added to my pizza box. I sat only for a couple minutes before my pizza was brought out. The inside looks very clean, but I was glad I placed my order for pick-up because it looked too trendy to be eating pizza in there. The hostess opened my pizza box and went over my order and asked if it was to my liking. It looked good!

Priced at $13.50 I had the "Margherita DOC" and the pizzas seem to come in one size here. It is more of a personal size pizza, but not super tiny. I was happy with it and couldn't finish the last 2 pieces. The pizza has crushed tomatoes, fresh buffalo mozzarella, basil, parmigiano reggiano and extra virgin olive oil. The crust was light and crispy, while the center of the pizza was softer. I had trouble picking up the pizza and eating it so I used a fork and knife which I don't mind. The crushed tomato sauce tasted sweet. I loved the amount of fresh mozzarella that was on it too! I'd like to try some of their other pizzas so I will be back. They also have some salads that sounds good!

We splurged at Mix. And we splurged in style. 

The photos of the truly glamorous restaurant located on the 64th floor of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay speak for themselves: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Cr4ipI-tr-R8Q0NilkWNkA?select=X7QyN6HCtkdcyuKjmp0yPg

The incredible views and stunning modern decor alone are worth the visit. The superb service, fantastic wine & cocktail menu and amazing food complete the experience. 

Our server, Lee Christopher, had a wonderful way about sharing his knowledge and love for renowned French Chef Alain Ducasse's culinary creations at Mix. The way he described the dishes were so colorful, and I was certain that no matter what we ended up ordering, it would be just as amazing as it sounded.

The menu features French and American dishes, including Alain Ducasse's signature dishes from his Monte Carlo and Paris restaurants. When you see the price of each dish you may have sticker shock, but let it sink in for a second, and remind yourself that you deserve to indulge in fine food every now and then. Appetizers are $20+ and entrees are $40+. The bison tenderloin I had was $52, and let me tell you, it was worth every cent!

Jessica had the pistachio encrusted striped bass with asparagus and Nicole had their version of Surf 'n Turf - halibut and seared foie gras over brussels sprouts and black truffle. Everything was succulent and savory. The fish dishes were fluffy and light, and even the vegetables were cooked to perfection. The bison tenderloin was all of our favorites. Encrusted with crushed black pepper, it had a wonderful kick, and the meat was extremely tender. If this was my last meal, I could die happy.

What made our dinner that much more remarkable was the fantastic service. There must have been at least 3 different servers that attended to our table, as well as Steve, the charismatic General Manager, throughout the evening. They went above and beyond to make our experience memorable, chatting with us and offering us individual wine pairings with our entrees, a lilikoi, rum and panna cotta foam cocktail the bartender created especially for us and the most amazing Riesling with our dessert. The meal ended with madeleines that were brought to us in the baking pan straight from the oven with Nutella. It was divine!

We took photos out on the balcony (if you can manage to get seating out there, the view is breathtaking) and even had a little photoshoot on the circular staircase surrounded by the incredible glass bubble curtain. Before leaving, we went over to Mix Lounge, which was an extension of the fab restaurant. 

Mix was truly the highlight of our entire Vegas weekend, and you should make it yours too.

I know, I know, this is a brand new steakhouse in Vegas and I probably committed every faux pas in the book by ordering the fish. But I did it. And I don't regret it for a minute.

FOOD:
---------
As our group asked for my opinion on appetizers, I knew I had to select the **Smoked Pork Terrine** because it offered the sublime foie gras, of which I have been deprived for ages, being a Californian and all. Combined with delicious pickled figs and pepper jelly atop a piece of bread, this appetizer was everything I wanted and more.

I was a little worried that choosing the **Roasted Market Fish** would be a total mistake, but it was delicious! It turned out to be Sea Bass with a tomato paste and zucchini relish. The bass was prepared perfectly, being sufficiently firm while also smoothly melting in the mouth. This would rival any bass from an acclaimed seafood restaurant. I sampled a piece of Anna's **Porterhouse** and it was divine. I would definitely order it on my next visit.

For side dishes we got the roasted mushrooms, asparagus, creamless sweet creamed corn. We all thought the asparagus could have used some more flavoring or some sort of creative twist, but the corn was a huge hit with its buttery smoothness.

SERVICE / AMBIANCE:
-------------------------------
Absolutely outstanding. Every member of the staff we encountered was on point, very warm and helpful, and extremely professional. Our server had an entertaining sense of humor. Even the busser impressed us with his refined gestures.

The decor is mod and clean with beautiful wood accents everywhere. The open kitchen in the back is a nice touch.

Of course you get what you pay for, so be ready to lay down some cash. For four people (3 steaks, 1 fish, 3 sides, 4 drinks), we each fronted about $100.

DATE TIP: With swankified dining at its best,
How could your date not be impressed?

I was driving through Mt. Lebanon at lunchtime and saw a new sign on Washington Rd. I'm glad I stopped to investigate because I was in for a delicious surprise! 

The Simple Greek is essentially a Greek food version of Chipotle and Qdoba (with all the same greatness!) You can build a pita, a salad, or a bowl with rice, vegetables, sauces, and meats to your own liking. I had a gyro meat rice bowl with delicious sour cream tzatziki sauce, green beans and potatoes in red sauce, and fresh veggies on top. I was so excited that I could decide what flavors to put together! They really make it to suit you--when I asked to try both types of rice in my bowl, the man making my meal was perfectly willing to split it down the middle to make it just the way I wanted it.

Additionally, the staff there was wonderful! I really appreciated that they took the time to explain what was in everything because, as someone with multiple food allergies, I hate to be surprised. Also, the woman in line behind me was asking about the vegetarian options on the menu and the man assisting her seemed very accommodating to her too. Each person I talked to seemed genuinely happy that I was there to eat, and that is always a plus in my book!

The atmosphere is welcoming, the place looks clean and well-maintained, and I'm eager to recommend it to all of my friends!

Aria is bigger, better, and bolder than you think. 

 * Hotel * 
Check-in was more painful and slow than expected, but the room was clean and modern. The view from the full-length windows was like many in the nearly 4000 guestrooms: clear and of the next hotel and the freeway. You didn't come for the view, so, enjoy the comfy bed and nice amenities in the bathroom before hitting the strip again.

* Restaurants *
With more than 10 places to eat, Aria really offers something for just about everyone. I love the Jean Philippe Patisserie for pastries, croissants, and crepes. Lemongrass is Asian-Thai Fusion when you need it while Barmasa is a bit overpriced Japanese, yet fine. Of course, The Buffet (as it is called) is the buffet and should fill you for one day.

* Activities *
Viva Elvis was an ok Vegas show, but not a very good Cirque du Soleil show. I'm looking forward to its replacement in November with another Cirque show called Zarkana. Haze Nightclub is only open Thursday - Saturday. It may not be the best of the best (ok, it isn't), but it was still fun for one night. For shopping, have fun "looking" at the expensive merchandise at the upscale name brands in City Center. The casino isn't nearly as large as you'd think, so, it still has a small casino feel to it. After you lose your cash, use your credit card to pay for a visit to the Spa or get a Cabana at the Pool.

Aria Hotel & Casino is a "nice" hotel to stay just a little back from the Strip. If you can't afford a 5-star Vegas hotel and aren't comped at one of the other Strip Theme Hotels, then Aria is a charming choice for a couple days.

From the Light Group; creators of some of the most impressive mega clubs, ultra lounges, and restaurants in Vegas, Miami, and Dubai so yes, it's impressive, contemporary, and trendy.  Smoke and mirrors.

Bottom line, you're paying for beautiful plates of "contemporary" cuisine unjustified by the quality of the ingredients.  In other words, want to impress a non foodie, this is your kind of place.

To start, the "Hot Rocks" (Japanese style of cooking thin slices of beef on super heated stones), fun but it's USDA choice at best and a chewier sirloin cut.  Not much internal fat, marinated in an acidic ponzu, olive oil mix causes the protein to tighten up even further.   Fun and visually cool but misses the mark. The tuna tartare, much better.  Deconstructed at service, mix everything up to enjoy.  Everyday sushi grade tuna mixed with well toasted pine nuts, crisp Asian pair and some soy with a hint of horseradish on toast points.  Refreshing and texturally interesting.

For mains, no mention is made on the quality or aging of the beef.  It appears to be USDA top choice, not prime.  Steaks are well trimmed.  Cooking temperatures off.  The tomahawk rib eye cooked mid well when ordered mid rare (twice) was OK.  Not as tender as it should be.  Good bitterness from the wood burring grill but lacking intense beef flavor of a well aged piece of beef.  The menu says 24oz but a lot of that weight is the bone.  Maybe 12oz of actual beef.  The bone in Brooklyn fillet is OK.  Cooked to temperature.  The bone, slightly cut away from the beef for looks fails to impart sufficient flavor as dry aged versions of the same cut.  

Pet peeve:  they put a pat of COLD butter on top of the steak.  Am I supposed to rub it around in the beef drippings and make my own sauce?

Correct sides.  No real standouts.

Good happy hour where you can try scaled down versions of the starters for $9.

Good wine list.  High Vegas resort pricing.

Smoke and mirrors a bad thing?  Hey, you're in Vegas aren't you?

I was shopping at the nearby Centennial Center as I do pretty much every week and even though there are many food options within the shopping center, I was bored with those options at the moment. I decided to pull up places on the good ole yelp app and came across Above the Crust. It's on Ann Rd across from Painted Desert, so not too far behind Centennial Center. Deciding to give Above the Crust a try, I stopped in and placed a order. They have so many good deals going on each day! It being Tuesday meant that I could get a large pizza free with the purchase of a large pizza and toppings an additional $2 each. I went with a large cheese and a large pepperoni and added a couple "Garlic Rolls" priced at .95 cents each. I really liked the taste of the pizza and the sauce on it. The rolls had a nice garlic and butter flavor on the outside, the inside was a bit too much bread that was tough. I prefer a more traditional knot personally. When I walked in, I was greeted with a friendly hello from all the employees and I was given a menu and a flyer that shows the current daily specials offered. 

Sunday and Monday ($32.95) - Large pizza, bucket of wings, 4 garlic rolls and a 2 liter of soda.

Two for Tuesday - Buy one large pizza get one free.

Wing Wednesday (24.95) - Sampler bucket of wings, choose up to 4 flavors.

Friday Special ($29.95) - Large pizza and a bucket of fingers.

Stromboli Saturday ($17.95) - Large pizza and any stromboli. 

Daily special ($5.95) - 2 slices and a drink.

They offer delivery and also offer sandwiches, salads and calzones.

Let me start by saying, historically, I like Best Buy. I like what they stand for, I like their products and I like their customer service. For these reasons, when I recently bought a condo and I was in need of a washer, dryer, refrigerator and television, the first place I looked was Best Buy. However, I picked the wrong Best Buy to make my purchase. 

This review is not about ALL Best Buys. This is about the Best Buy on 20th and Camelback. 

Like I said, I purchased a washer, dryer and television and the Geek Squad mounting from this Best Buy. 

The washer, dryer and TV were to be delivered on a Saturday morning by 10:30 a.m.  I received the call on Friday confirming my delivery. On Saturday at 10 a.m. the delivery truck arrived, but there was one MAIN problem. They only had the dryer. Where were my TV and washer? Good question. Well, the washer was on a truck that apparently "broke down" while coming from California. Best Buy didn't bother calling me to tell me that my washer wouldn't be delivered. The television was a whole other story. The sales associate apparently filled out the form incorrectly, and so the order was cancelled. Was I called about either of these issues? No. It wasn't until I talked to the delivery company and 3 different people at Best Buy to "resolve" the problem. At this point it was too late to have my items delivered on Saturday and because I work, I had to wait another week to have them delivered.

But, this saga isn't over yet. When they messed up my order, they PROMISED me I would have my washer and television delivered by 10:30 a.m. the following Saturday since they messed up my order. I had to be somewhere at 11 so it was impertinent it was delivered before then. They said, not a problem and promised it would be there. 
I called the Geek Squad on Thursday to confirm that my TV would be installed and delivered Saturday. They confirmed that the Geek Squad would arrive WITH the TV and install it. 

I then got a call from the delivery truck about my washing machine (remember, they promised it would be there by 10:30 am.) They told me the washer would be delivered between 1-3 pm. I had to argue for a half an hour with the manager before he  final "pulled strings" to "accommodate" my original delivery request. 
But...it's not over yet. 

The second Saturday morning arrives. The washer gets there. Check that off the list. Then, the Geek Squad arrives to install my TV. Remember, they PROMISED me they'd arrive with the TV. Guess what. They didn't. The poor guys had no idea they were supposed to pick up the TV. In fact, I learned that they aren't even allowed to pick up deliveries from this store. So, my installation guys are there and the TV is missing yet again. They did me a HUGE favor and actually drove across town to this store to pick up the TV (shocking fact; these guys don't work at the store on Camelback. They work at the one on Frank Lloyd Wright). So, they go all the way to the Camelback location to pick up my TV....which they learn was about to be shipped to Texas for some random reason. If they hadn't picked up my TV, I'm sure I'd still be missing it today. Was I ever called by Best Buy with an apology? No. 

I don't think I need to explain further why I would never shop at this Best Buy again. I bought my refrigerator from the Best Buy on Shea and it went off without a hitch. 

So my Yelp friends, if you want a seamless experience with your pricey purchases of major appliances, I would suggest you shop anywhere but the Best Buy on Camelback and 20th. Not only did they mess up my order on multiple levels, the sales associate staff was rude on top of it. 

This is not the experience you want when you are making a large financial commitment.

Stayed here for work as we had a conference here. For starters, PH is very conveniently located. Finding the place if you're driving can be a pain, however - it took my boss 45 minutes just trying to figure out where to drive in for the lobby!

The lobby itself is not much to speak about -- hardly any place to sit, unless you think three very small benches is adequate. The check in staff were pleasant enough. Curbside staff were helpful. 

Room-wise, it is pretty dark. Unless you are staying in one of the suites -- we did have a party in one of those which had a fantastic view. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/planet-hollywood-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas-2?select=QWK7FTtIHE2fSJWdJuTJ0A#QWK7FTtIHE2fSJWdJuTJ0A The pillows are uncomfortably high. If you don't like firm pillows, you should bring your own, or roll up some towels. There is a small coffee maker, no fridge, I had to call up a hairdryer, but overall apart from the loud revelers who thought yelling at 3:00 am is acceptable right outside someone's room, it was a quiet room on the 12th floor. 

Conference facilities are on the mezzanine level where the Chapel is. Lots of weddings going on while I was there. In general, the conference food was good. It is expensive though! I suppose that's the case with most hotels on The Strip. For instance, I had to order wine & cheese for a workshop I was putting on. Get this, a baked brie for 25 people runs about $225.00, not including tax & gratuity. Ouch. 

WiFi is not free -- I believe it is $15 a day per device? Didn't bother checking out the gym, also heard that is not free. Nothing is! 

Despite the downside, I liked it. I had stayed at Bally's before which was a bit of a blah experience for me. This was the opposite. Loved the crystal lighting throughout. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/planet-hollywood-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas-2?select=dWu2esICZ8ToW3geJ6kXsA#dWu2esICZ8ToW3geJ6kXsA

You do have the convenience of the Miracle Mile shops which is nice - don't even have to set food outside! There is also a PF Chang's in the casino area and a Starbucks. The Miss America pageant was going on while I was there which made for an interesting scene! (The guys really liked seeing them for the swimsuit photo shoot at the pool.)

Bright lights. Shiny things. Grand opening signs.  Girls that look really good in yoga pants.  I can't explain why, but I do know that these are just some of the things I am hypnotically attracted to. Kinda like the blue alien from the planet Baab (Escape From Planet Earth).

So after a recent Yelp Helps event followed by a group dinner at Ramen Sora, I was ready for some sweets to end the day. But it was past regular business hour at SnowFlake, so I was really drawn to the bright lights through those large windows emanating from what I soon discovered to be a new dessert spot in Chinatown.  But I was too late. the business has closed for the day, and the cashier lady was already counting the register and getting ready to leave.

So 2 days passed and another Yelp Helps event, this time benefitting the Ronald McDonald House charity, plus an amazeball CMYE in Downtown Las Vegas.  And I finally made it to this new Vietnamese dessert spot while it is still opened. The interior is very clean, brightly lit and has some comfy looking couch seating near the back. Their menu is pretty extensive.  Offering Vietnamese desserts, blended coffee, milk tea, smoothies and cold and hot beverages.

Tonight I was most interested in checking out their Vietnamese desserts (Ch). After a brief glance at their menu I settled for the trusty #1 Bambu Special, which is made with young coconut, pandan jelly, longan, basil seed and coconut water.  I really enjoyed the longan and slurping the basil seeds and pandan jelly, but I thought the crushed ice diluted the coconut water too much.  I barely tasted it.  What I did like is the fact that they use good ingredients and fresh when available.  

What I like:
* Use of quality ingredients.
* In Chinatown next to Hot 'n Juicy (the location closest to Decatur).
* Clean!!! Or at least the appearance of being clean.
* You can customize the desserts adding or removing ingredients to suit your taste or craving.

What I didn't like:
* Too much crushed ice diluted the flavor of the dessert drink I ordered.
* Parking lot is tiny and usually full.  Must be all the massage customers.
Street parking on the side street is usually occupied, so you can find parking but will have to do more walking.

I will definitely comeback to check out other menu items, but for now I am only going to rate them worthy of 3 stars.

Those who know me will tell you I am one difficult person to impress, a fact that still has my mother wondering where she could have gone wrong. But I promise you I can be impressed, and when it does happen, even I get a little chill up and down my spine. 

If you hope to get my attention, especially with food, you better hit all the right notes at all the same time. From presentation and taste, service and atmosphere, right up to the bite you take out of my wallet, everything needs to fit just perfectly together if you hope to get a rave out of me. You can have the world's best food, but if I have to wait an eternity in line, or drop a small fortune, or suffer miserably apathetic service, then even the world's greatest food can suck.

But when everything you do fits perfectly together; when the food is good and the service is friendly and the price is a bargain, that's when you're doing things right. 

And then there are those rare occasions when all those elements come together, except the food is not simply good it's extraordinary, that's when you're going to start making some serious impressions in my book.

Imagine for me, if you will, a simple bacon cheeseburger. If you are like me, it always has been, and likely always will be, one of life's great guilty pleasures. 

Now imagine that simple bacon cheeseburger: with thick-cut smoked bacon, silky-smooth gruyere, arugula, and perfectly seasoned, grass-fed beef with just a hint of garlic aioli on top. Add all those elements together with the understated genius from The Blind Pig's kitchen and you have a bacon cheeseburger that requires no additional adornment, that challenges the lines of what makes a great burger. If you can imagine that (or better yet, if you can stop by The Blind Pig and try one for yourself) well then you will know firsthand what it takes to impress me - and I can promise you, I am very impressed.

Everybody knows you can get some really great burgers in Vegas these days, but I always find myself walking out wondering whether the extra cost and extra effort were really worth it. I will hold The Blind Pig's $12 "BP Burger" up against any burger in this town and say simply - "beat that!"

Can't wait to try what's next.

400th Review!!!!!!!!

I have been dying to try J & G Steakhouse for a very long time, and when I saw there was a group of Yelpers going to try them out during the fall restaurant week I knew this was my chance!  

1st off, let's talk about the amazing view, you can see for miles, I honestly didn't want to leave, just wanted to watch the city lights twinkle and soak up the view!

For restaurant week, J&G offered a few choices, for me, I went to a steakhouse, so gosh darnit I'm having me some steak!! haha

I started with an arugula & boston lettuce salad with a mustard vinaigrette, now if you don't care of the bitter taste of the arugula, then this salad is not for you, but for me, everything blended perfectly.   I ordered the prime top sirloin cap which also came with a broccoli pure and some roasted garlic & chili flakes on the side, now the broccoli pure on its own tasted very wheat grassy green, if that makes since but the waiter told us to spinkle the garlic chili flakes over the steak and mix the steak with the pure, and OMG AMAZING!!!! The flavors all complement each other! Next thing I knew my steak was gone!! So good!!!   Ended my meal with caramel ice cream and a warm chocolate molten cake, omg so good!!! Love the combination of caramel and chocolate, had I not been at the J&G I'm pretty sure I would have licked my plate clean (not really, but yes it's that good).

Enjoyed my evening at J&G and with the company I was with, amazing views, great service, and excellent food! Hope to be back soon!

Did you ever say you wished you had a J-Lo butt? Then read on...

I might be a little bias being 1/2 Puerto Rican, but you know you are at the right place when you walk in and see that countries native people eating there. If you want a real treat and have never had Puerto Rican food, please go to Millie's and try it.
It is a Mom & Pop place for sure -you will see Millie herself right behind the counter cookin' your food like you were sitting in her kitchen while her husband is taking your order. The price is definitely right! We practically had the entire menu for $40. Don't be fooled by the ambiance... tiny dining room, fold out tables & chairs, plastic ware & cups with ice from an ice chest propped up on a stool. The food is where the money is!! BTW- cash only, so be prepared. Open Thurs-Sun for lunch & dinner (11am-8pm).

Here are some highlights if you're not familiar:
Tostones... fried & salted plantains - get the garlic side dip
Pasteles... pork inside green banana (like a tamale, but better)
Amarillos... sweet fried banana
Arroz con Gandules... yellow rice w/beans
and last but NOT least (here's where the J-Lo butt comes in)
Mofongo w/a side of pork - it is hard to describe but easy to remember! It is plantain w/crispy fried pork formed into a ball of joy! And the sides of pork that they give are the most tender juicy pork I've ever had. This is a must try item! But not for the faint of heart - literally. 

"Bottom" line is I would eat here everyday if I could afford new clothes.

P.S. I read someone else's review that stated that the Flan was not made there. Just FYI, Millie is the Flan Lady & makes the flan right there in that same kitchen. The only problem is that she makes it for restaurants valley wide & so in that mass production - it loses some of it's homemade quality. It is still good though & she makes a mean pastry. Try 'em!

Vdara is a nice hotel, but it is not a 5-star one (as advertised). Some features are nice like the in-room kitchen (that you probably won't use), electronic housekeeping and privacy status, and 2 TVs. It's the little things that make a hotel 5 stars and it is the combination of a lot of small mis-steps that lower Vdara to 3-stars.

 * Check-in/check-out - quick check-in and easy TV-based check-out 4/5

 * Room - decent size with entry kitchenette, and bed on one side of entertainment console/desk and sofa on the other 4/5

 * Bed - King size bed is standard. Couch can be a 2nd bed (good for kids?) 4/5

 * Bathroom - Seperate shower & tub (deep, but narrow with stopper in middle) with 1 sink 3/5

 * Housekeeping - 2 days didn't clean room without calling; 2 bottles of water included, but missing 2/5

 * Amenities - very basic amenities. Bonus: ask for slippers & robe 3/5

 * Pool - basic Vegas pool with stellar service. Older crowd 3/5

 * Parking - Valet only. No Self Parking 2/5

 * Location - you are off the Strip and must go thru Aria, Bellagio, or Cosmopolitan to get to the strip. Why not just stay at one of those? 2/5

 * Atmosphere - Quiet... Really quiet. Does smell great inside & is smoke free 2/5

 * Casino - none. Go elsewhere or stay elsewhere for fun 1/5

 * Restaurants - one lobby bar which is ... a lobby bar 1/5

 * View - we had a partial view of Bellagio fountains and Paris hotel 3/5

 * WiFi - "free" with $25 resort fee; worked in room, pool, and lobby 4/5

 * Value - $25 resort fee + $3 Tax adds up. So do taxi rides to actually go anywhere else. Plan at least $20/day for those, too. 2/5

 * Oddity - On 2nd day, a stranger opened our door with a key and then quickly apologized and left. Called front desk to warn them and was told "it happens sometimes." Well, not to me it hadn't before...

 * Overall - Vdara met our needs for a quiet place to sleep, but it also felt isolated and boring. We spent much of our time going to other hotels ... Hotels we could of stayed at for just a little more than Vdara.

Right now they are open Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays from 7 am - 12 pm. Admission is free if you are walking in, but $3 to drive in with your vehicle. There is parking right across from the entrance if you decide not to drive in. I grew up coming to this orchard for school field trips as well with family and friends. I love that this place is still here! The area is rich in history, which could take a whole review alone so, I recommend reading up on it sometime and maybe you will appreciate the area even more. They have such a huge orchard that depending on the time of season you come, you really need to dress accordingly especially if you plan on walking through. There is about 60 acres to explore. They have a stand at the entrance if you just want to grab some stuff already picked, or you can take your time exploring the orchard and pick what you like. They provide wagons for you to use.

When I visited yesterday they were offering the following:
Carrots - $1 per pound
Beets - $1 per pound
Cucumbers - $1 per pound
Green Tomatoes - $1 per pound
Apricots - $1 per pound
Squash - $1 per pound
Zucchini - $1 per pound
Peaches - $1 per pound
Honey - $7 for the honey bear and $20 for a quart
Garlic - $2 for 3 bulbs or $10 for 3 pounds
New Potatoes - $2 per bag
Onions - $1 each
Peanut Butter - $6 each
Almond Butter - $8 each 

I came specifically for a honey bear and some peanut butter. Both sell out fast and aren't always available. If you can get your hands on some, I recommend it! The honey is fresh and comes right from the orchard. The peanut butter us a huge hit in our house and doesn't last long. If you ever at the orchard when they are making fresh apple cider donuts you must try some! They are usually only a couple bucks and SO worth it! Sign up for their weekly newsletter and find out when they have available for harvest and what types of food items they might be cooking up.

NO LATIN TRANSLATOR NECESSARY!

It seems like everytime I go to any Latin restaurant, I need a real live Rosetta Stone for any questions I have. Either that or I need subtitles when an employee talks to me. LOL.

Anyways, back to my review. I have heard good things about this place from all my Yelp buddies so that alone is good motivation. I have heard of arepas but never actually had them. For those noobs like me, its a dish made of ground corn dough or cooked flour, very prominent in the cuisine of Colombia and Venezuela. So you can put two of them together with your choice of meat and other toppings. I ordered carne asada with cheese. I scarfed it down like a it was the last piece of food I will ever see again. They have other delectable choices as well but when you go to a highly recommened place, you get what is popular so their namesake lived up to the hype.

Service is awesome! They answer all the questions you have and even make suggestions based on what you are leaning towards. They bring it out to you where you sit with two ketchup bottles. One has a light green colored kind of sauce and the other has a light reddish tint to it. Both have different spices to it but the reddish colored one has a little kick to it. Not overpowering, but definitely gives your food that extra oomph that keeps your mouth watering.

As for their location, they used to be half a block up the street in a little taco stand. They are now on the corner of Oakey and S Las Vegas Blvd, just kitty corner to 7/11. Look for the weird Indian statues because they are neighbors with an Indian antique store.  I guess with their recent popularity, they moved to this spacious building. They have plenty of tables and chairs so bring your friends. Plenty of room.

The only negative things I can see is that the parking is kind of limited. The old Indian statues take up several parking stalls and the stalls are small to begin with so be real careful in parking and backing up. Also they charge 50 cents for using cards to pay for anything under 10 dollars. 

So if I ever make a trip to South America, at least I know what and how good arepas are. VIVA LAS AREPAS!

"Hello, welcome to our dog and pony show.  We're so happy to have you as clients, and we want to show our appreciation for your business.  But we're too cheap to take you to see a Cirque Du Soleil show, even though there's a good one across the street at the MGM Grand.  So we'll take you to what we think is a hip, hot, happenin' joint:  Hyde!"

At least that's how I interpreted it.

It's an exclusive club, complete with a velvet rope;  they don't let just anybody in, and it looks like you need to have a little dough to get in and imbibe.  Once you're in, it has a high-class feel in its decor, furniture, and view of the fountains.  Pretty good thick pizza and sliders.  And drinks, of course, with more emphasis on the drinks than the food;  I think that if I asked for a Coke, they'd give it to me with rum in it.

Not really my kind of venue.  Our group had the back part reserved for our private party, with a clear view of the fountains dancing around to "In The Mood".  I spent most of my time eating - well, I am on a seefood diet, y'know.  The music was not so loud that we couldn't talk to each other, what a relief.  I was disappointed that no one got up and danced;  I was told that this happened after our party was over, and that it got a little weird.

I guess it's okay if it's your thing.  No complaints about their prices, which I didn't check out;  at least you get something for your money, which you won't in the casinos (remember, the house wins almost all the time).  I won't be back, but that's just me.

Bachi Burger...I'm a huge fan. This is one of my favorite places for gourmet burgers. 
My favorite burger is the black and green (only because it's so good that I haven't ordered anything else), the wagyu grass fed beef, mushrooms, blue cheese and spinach blend together deliciously in your mouth. These burgers are pretty good sized. The buns are super soft, and the meat is really tender. With every bite you take, it just melts in your mouth. 

We ordered the Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries. I really like the garlic chili aioli, but next time I'd like to try the Truffle Parmesan Fries. 

Our neighbor ordered the oxtail chili cheese fries and they looked amazing. The plate was huge, although there was only two and they finished the whole plate without issue. I think it's because they are that good.

The only thing average about this place was my iced tea.  It was just ok. I'm definitely a little picky about my iced tea, so I just wouldn't order it again here. Maybe next time I'll try the Matcha Green Tea instead.

The Bellagio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas remains one of the most beautiful hotels on the Strip. If at all possible try to stay in the main building (instead of the Spa Tower) and upgrade to a room with a view of the lake and fountains.

The glass flower ceiling in the lobby is still stunning while the Conservatory and Botanical Gardens just to the side of the lobby are a popular photo-op spot with seasonal displays. The current French Summer scene is as beautiful as any I've seen although my favorite may be the creative Chinese New Year gardens in January and February each year.

The Bellagio has received the AAA Five Diamond Award every year since 2000 for a reason. It is a great hotel. Elegant rooms and wonderful housekeeping make your experience in your room enjoyable. Meanwhile restaurants like Le Cirque, Picasso, Jasmine, and Jean Philippe Patisserie make dining a delight. The Bellagio Buffet is outstanding, but made even better on Friday, Saturday, or holidays thanks to King Crab Legs and Kobe-style Beef.

Shopping at the Bellagio may be out of the price range of most of us, but it's still delicious to browse the Hermes, Omega, Chanel, Fendi, Dior, Armani, Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton, and Tiffany shops. 

For entertainment, my favorite Vegas show is at the Bellagio. Tickets are expensive, but the water-themed Cirque du Soleil masterpiece "O" is worth every bit of the cost. Don't want to spend too much money, then hang out at one of the Bellagio pools. Finally, plan to spend some time being mesmerized in the evenings by music, lights, and dancing water of the Fountains of Bellagio.

My only real disappointment with the Bellagio is the Casino. The number of tables seems limited, however, the real problem is a continual sour attitude of the dealers. I played a couple days at a variety of tables (mostly blackjack and roulette) and didn't meet even one friendly dealer that even pretended to like their job. Not sure if it was a bad week, but the negative vibe was noticeable compared to other casinos hit during the past week.

Despite the sourpuss dealers, the Bellagio is a dynamic 4-star plus experience. Bring money and a positive attitude for a vacation to remember.

After living here 10 years I figure I have seen enough to have something to say.

What started as a rural community with a few subdisions and of course the toursist attraction of a street full of casinos & hotels. The Strip.

Then it was NightClubs,StripClubs,MegaRessorts, and World Class Dining & Entertainment.

This place has morphed into a Metropolis with freeways criss-crossing the city and MegaResorts, Supermalls, neighborhood strip malls and neighborhood casinos suburban communities like Summerlin, Del Webb, Lone Mountain, and all the subdiviisions.

Houses were built by the 1000's overnight with imported labor. Population went from 60K to over 300K in less than 5 years.

WHat happend?

Schools are 48th in the country which is BAD.Huge class sizes, very underqualified teachers and lots of non-english speaking.40% high school drop out rate!!

Healthcare is non-existant-UMC the county hospital receycled needles spreading Hepatitis last year.Plus nurse shortages.

Courts, County Commission, Mayor and other Governemnt Offcials are corrupt as they come.-The mayor is a former mob attorney. County officials have been indicted & convicted of many crimes, Judges & lawyers arrested regularly. Its madness

Parks & Recreation is where we actually exceed expectations. Theres lots of parks and stuff to do without having to gamble.Lots of sporting events for the kids.

Jobs-Well pay is relatively low unless you are in a high tip paying job or a stripper or something illegal.
Most jobs on the Strip require a Sherrifs Card which cost you $40-$50 and requires a background check and fingerprinting at the police station.
Some jobs also require a Health Card for food handling etc, this requires you to go to the hospital and get a TB shot and watch a video some people have to get other shots too.
Then there the TAM card-Tobacco & Alcohol Managemnt-waitresses,bartenders,clerks and lots more have to get this card which requires a class & test to complete. Plus it cost you $80-#$00.

Food & Entertainment.-Well everyone knows about the Fancy Chefs and all their Fancy restaurants on the Strip but Las VEgas is filled with culinary delights. Many people relocate here and bring their own cuisine and styles.

There's tons of community events for familys and Vegas knows how to throw a party. The big Holidays are always loaded with tourists  but you kind find many intimate events throughout the year.

Lots of quality librarys and other resources.


Casinos have been allowed to build in residential neighborhoods so now nearly every neighborhood has a casino of some kind which is nice if you like $2.99 breakfast & other thinngs casinos offer.

The bus system has added the Duece to its fleet making ir a little better but its still a little slow. The monorail has been erected but not completed. It seems it would be a better beenfit going to & from the airport to the strip.

Many of the traditional casinos had been imploded & new ones bigger & brighter and more expensive have been built in their place. Condos on the strip have become a reality and even Trump has come to town.

Our XFL Football team came & went. We have lots of sporting events and concerts to attend and at reasonable prices.No real chance of ever getting a PRO sports team..

Las Vegas is hot & sunny 300 days a year and for some a little too hot but we adapt and learn to beat the heat.

We have pools in our backyards all hotels and apartments have them too. Lake Mead & Hoover Dam is just a drive to the water even though its been less than impressive over the years.

It's pricy to live in the city but you have everything you need right in the neighborhood, lots of great finds & deals around, usually plenty of jobs to go around and there's always a little luck.

You can take a vacation just by going down the strip or downtown , theres always something new & exciting. Learning to use the comp system at the casinos makes living in Vegas so much funner.

Prostituion may not be legal but there's plenty of Escorts for you and Marijuana has been decriminalized so the cops don't fuck with you plus the quality has gotten alot better with all the legal supply in California nearby.I love this place all you can eat munchies for under $10 everyday!!

My disgust and hatred for the Venetian is due to the fact that they lost mine and my friend (fellow Yelper) Ingrid R's luggage the same day we arrived in Vegas for a girlfriend's bachelorette weekend.

Yes, you read that right: THE VENETIAN LOST OUR LUGGAGE. 

THE INCIDENT: Sat 6/23/12
11am: We gave 2 pieces of luggage to Jeremy, bellhop.
215pm: We gave our claim ticket to Sean, bellhop, to pick up our bags.
245pm: There was no word from anyone about our luggage nor did we see our bags as other guests' luggage were brought out.
245-4pm: We asked Shahid, the Guest Services manager at the bellhop desk, about our bags. He found our claim ticket in the trash at the bell desk. He took us to the luggage storage areas to locate our bags, but they weren't there.
4pm: Shahid offered us a hospitality suite as a temporary holding place to wait until security met with us to write up a report.
4:30pm: Craig, security, wrote up a report and took an inventory of what was in each luggage. He also made phone calls to lost&found; housekeeping; and the front desk to see if our bags turned up, but no luck. He gave us a card for the Venetian's Claims Dept and told us to call them in 3 days if our bags weren't found.
5:30pm: We called Shahid for an update: still no bags. We asked him what course of action would be taken given the fact that we were now without clothes, toiletries, and other items that had been in our luggage. He said he'd speak to the general manager, Alissa, and get back to us.
5:15pm: Shahid called back and told us we were approved for a comp'd room and would be given $250 each for any purchases needed to get us through the weekend. Shahid told us they'd still search for our bags. He explained that our bags may have been mistakenly sent up to another guest's room but in the back of my mind I had a feeling our bags were given to a guest who was checking out of the Venetian.

The way the Venetian handled the situation was infuriating. Yes we were given a complimentary room (big deal) and $250 each, but that was only because WE asked what the plan of action was after realizing our luggage was lost. There was no sense of urgency in making sure we were taken care of which made us feel as if our situation was not a priority. 

BTW, when Ingrid and I went to pick up our luggage, we had just left Tao Beach. We were only wearing swim attire and luckily had our wallets with us, but we lost everything else: shoes, makeup *$#!@, outfits, toiletries, and my valuable items: my camera, my grandma's vintage Louis Vuitton clutch, and my Kindle.  Yes I'm aware that I shouldn't have left my valuables in my luggage but it seemed safer to leave it in my locked luggage than bring it all with me to Tao Beach. So not only did we lose the items in our luggage, which were of both monetary and sentimental value, but we missed out on some bachelorette activities since we had to go to the mall to buy shoes, clothes, and basic underwear and to Walgreens to buy toiletries that the Venetian didn't offer, while dressed in our bathing suits.

AFTERMATH:
I wrote a letter to Alissa, the general manager, expressing my frustration over the situation. She replied 3 days later apologizing and informing me to contact her should we choose to stay at the Venetian in the future. Really?! Aside from going to the Canyon Ranch Spa, I have no desire to set foot in their hotel. I called their Claims Department, 3 days later, and spoke with Tony who informed me that due to an "Innkeepers Statute" under Nevada Law, the max payout for each of our lost luggage would be $750. Really?!?!?  I was livid. The Venetian is a damn casino raking in millions, if not billions, of dollars and the most they can pay out is $750?!  Freaking ridiculous!!!  What was the point in wasting our time in taking an inventory of our lost items if in the end all we were going to get was $750?!  Tony went on to tell me that they've exhausted all means in locating our luggage and that the search had stopped.  He emailed me a waiver form for me to sign (releasing the Venetian of any fault) so I could then receive my check.  My possessions are most likely long gone, but I still feel completely violated as if someone had physically snatched my belongings from me. What's even more disturbing is whoever has our bags hasn't made any attempt to contact us about our luggage, leading me to believe they managed to open the bags, take whatever they wanted, and ditch the rest of the items somewhere. 

So in the end I not only lost my possessions, but I also lost a bit of faith in humanity. 

Lastly, thanks to the Venetian, I've also developed anxiety over entrusting my possessions with anyone (ie other hotel bellhops; airport luggage check-ins; valet services; etc) so much so I will avoid using bellhops; I will carry on my luggage; and avoid using valet...and if that's not at all possible, I'm taking my valuables with me: LESSON LEARNED the hard way.

Sprinkles is at The Linq (between the Flamingo and the Quad). Cupcakes are $3.75 each and an additional 50 cents if you want it in a box instead of a wax bag. They have more than one door. The left is cupcakes only while the right side is both cupcakes and ice cream. They have prices and flavors posted and only offer certain flavors on different days of the week. You can check their website or download the Sprinkles app to find out what flavors they have that day. 

I just went to the cupcake side on this visit, but plan on trying the ice cream in the future.  I ordered a "Doggie Cupcake" priced at $2.50 that is sugar-free and has a yogurt frosting. It had a cute little orange bone on top. My dog, Brownie loved it! She licked the top off first and then ate the rest. I had a "Lemon Meringue" that was very good. The lemon cake had graham cracker lining and delicious tasting lemon curd in the middle. The top had toasted marshmallow that was good, but had a chewy outer layer that was tough to eat, so that was all that was left of the cupcake I didn't finish. They have tables and chairs outside of the store. As I was sitting there eating my cupcake, Candace Nelson the founder of Sprinkles came outside to greet customers. She was very sweet and signed autographs and took pictures with people, including myself! They have a decent amount of tables and chairs outside, but they were pretty filled up and the inside of the store was busy yet the line moved along smoothly. 

There is a cupcake ATM outside (near the ice cream side) on the patio and it's open 24 hours. The cupcakes are still $3.75 each, but come boxed so you have to pay the extra 50 cents. Hubby had a strawberry cupcake that I tried a bite of and liked, so I got one of those from the cupcake ATM to see how it worked. The ATM is user friendly and the screen allows you to see your cupcake coming to you from inside the store to when the door lifts open on the ATM revealing a pink box. I thought it was cool and even though the store is open late, it is neat knowing you can get a Sprinkles cupcake at any hour. 

Hours:
Sunday - Wednesday 10 am to 12 am
Thursday - Saturday 10 am to 1 am

*This review is for the salon*

While staying with friends at The Venetian for yet another free staycation, my friend and I decided to get manicures at the salon here. Too bad the manicures weren't free too! First, the walk getting to this place is ridiculous. I did like the colorful walls and decor, but it was too loud for a spa. I got dizzy every time I turned a corner and it was another long and colorful hallway. I kept wondering if this place was hidden in a deep dark tunnel. When we got to the front desk of the salon I noticed two employees laughing away and chit chatting. I wasn't sure if they noticed us standing there or not, but after the long walk it took to get to the salon and then standing there for 15 minutes waiting I wasn't feeling too good about this experience. Finally, these two employees noticed us and said "oh I'm so sorry, how can I help you". Grrrr. 

The salon was packed and looked like a zoo. The hallways leading into this place were so quiet and the front of the salon the same, then you get inside the salon and the noise level escalates. I had a "Spa Manicure" that cost $50 and I got a locals discount. The woman who did the manicure was nice, but seemed rushed. The couch style seat was comfy, but this place was just too crowded and loud to even hear the person next to you well. My manicure looked good, but average. For the price I would hope for a bit more space with maybe less people at once inside, the manicurist to take her time and the noise brought down a couple notches. The manicurist was nice and didn't control the appointments so I felt sorry for her. This wont be a regular stop for me, but with the right locals deal I would come back to try out their spa services.

AVOID this place at all costs.  I've never been treated so disrespectful in my entire life. 

Came here last night with 3 friends after having dinner at Squid Ink since it's the only bar in the area.  Ordered a beer for myself and 2 of my friends and was promptly told that in order to get the drinks I would need to surrender my keys.  Ok... I told them and I gave them my keys even though I didn't even bring my car here.  My friends and I ordered shots, then went on the dance floor and goofed around having a good time.  When I went to order another drink I was told by the waitress that I was "too drunk."  "Excuse me?" I asked her, "I've had 2 drinks!"  When I asked for my keys back she just flatly told me, "No." I went to find a manager and a burly doorman asked me what was my "problem." I told him my problem was I was being refused service and I just wanted to get my keys and get out of this crappy bar.  He told me I would get my keys as soon as a cab got here. I told him a cab was on the way, and that never in my life had I been treated like a common criminal for doing nothing wrong!  I told him obviously you people don't want my business and I won't ever return.  That's when the doorman told me, "That's fine, fags like you aren't welcome here." That's when I completely lost my shit.  After the cab arrived I asked for my keys back. I was told, "you're just planning on taking the cab to your car." I told him my car was at home and I needed my keys to get into my house! He finally thew the keys at me and I got the heck out of there.

I have no idea where the people come off treating someone like that.  I did nothing wrong and was called a hateful word and was treated like a common criminal. And my tab came to around $25 for 3 beers. Definitely avoid this place.

Came in last night for my gfs 21st birthday. We had dinner at yard house and the plan was to have drinks and dessert here after.... We should have just stayed at YH. 

My Gf had a reservation all set up, they even called to confirm with her a few days ago. When we all arrived they took us to a table and we heard one of the hostesses telling the server "they didn't even have a reservation" it's not like we needed one, there were maybe two tables in there that were occupied, and for good reason...

I've dinned at the sugar factory on the strip before so I was very surprised at the horrible service we received at this location. The server never told us their name and the GM refused us his card. Our table was being completely ignored. I've been in the restraunt Industry for 13 years now and how we were being treated was completely uncalled for. I told the server a few times to bring out my gfs birthday dessert because another table got there's but nothing. It never happened. It really put a damper on the night. 
There are so many places in Vegas especially to celebrate your 21st and we chose here... But we will never make that mistake again. I would be much happier paying full price for the other location or somewhere else entirely.

What. The. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck?????!!

I was stone-cold sober last night, I SWEAR. I went to see George Wallace, expecting a middle-of-the-road Vegas standup show. Some laffs, some audience participation, whatever. What do you expect for free tickets, ya know?

What I got was about 60 minutes of a cherubic relic in a pimp suit mumbling, slurring and stumbling through a bunch of dusty one-liners 
(sometimes his delivery was so bad, I couldn't understand what he was saying). There were a few jokes in really bad taste, though, about which he was totally unapologetic...so I did laugh at those.

But then, the show got WEIRD AS FUCK!

As one of the other reviewers mentioned, the audience is mostly middle-aged black people. Now, I've seen Madea and Coming to America and all those movies that end with church scenes featuring gospel singers clapping and throwing up their hands and singing "O Happy Day" and shit like that -- I thought it was some bullshit racist Hollywood stereotype.

But I'm here to tell you: at end of his show, on a Wednesday night in Vegas, George Wallace asked all the ministers in the house to stand up -- astonishingly, there were 7 or 8 of them in there that night, so they all got up and passed the mic around, saying their names, where they were from, and what church they preached at:"The First African Episcopalian Tabernacle Church of God in Christ," stuff like that.  WTF!!! 

Now George Wallace cued some 80s gospel music, and handed the mic around again. This one guy down front started belting away in a majestic baritone, somehow knowing all the words without a problem. Was he a plant? Or do all ministers just know these songs, and happen to frequent the George Wallace show (other reviewers here describe this same thing going down)? 

Next, he invited another one of the ministers, this big spiky-haired woman, onstage. He told her if she could sing this next track, and really kill it, he would match all the money people in the audience threw at her. WTF?! He didn't say anything about it going to her church -- I guess she just got to keep the cash.
 
So he cued up another obscure gospel track, and she took the mic -- and started DOMINATING that song!! I thought for sure she must be a plant -- she'd been sitting in a booth with a bunch of much younger guys who had raised their hands earlier when Wallace asked if anyone was from Detroit, but she said she was from Henderson...plus, they didn't react like friends would when she was pulled up onstage. Definitely seemed plant-y.

But if that's the case, then what a scam!!! Because after she belted a verse or two, people in the audience started getting up and throwing cash at her!!! They came from all over the theater -- the back, sides, front -- and even my friend went up and gave her $5, so I know the money wasn't all fake. People were standing up in the aisles, waving their hands in the air like on those creepy megachurch broadcasts, singing along and praising Jesus. Did I mention this was a Wednesday night in Vegas, and most of them were drinking Mai Tais and shit!!!!! WTF!!!

If this lady was really a plant, she has a pretty sweet gig going there -- she probably made about $100 for her "impromptu" performance, which I assume she repeated the following night...and the following night. George Wallace said he would match the money after the show -- he said, "Come see me, and I'll give you $100." Hmmm. 

Now that I think about it...the theater was only about a third full, and as mentioned my friends and I had gotten free tickets, so who knows how many other comps were in there. He's probably not making much money, since he spent a good portion of the show hawking his merch -- he told people over and over to be sure and buy one of his signature "I Be Thinkin'" hats after the show, which were normally $30 but this night only, just for us, he was marking them down to $20. He also pimped his $100 package, which included 2 CDs, 2 DVDs, 2 t-shirts and 2 keychains. 

It came off as kinda swap-meetish, and pretty desperate...so that makes me wonder: is he splitting the take with this planted gospel singer???

Either way, even if she was for real -- that's pretty fucking weird, too! I mean, these people were throwing money at her like it was the Spearmint Rhino!! 

WEIRD show. I would recommend scoring free tix somewhere, then eating mushrooms 30min before it starts.

And if you do -- be sure to let me know if the same lady gets up and sings! She looked like a fat Fantasia Barrino, with short spiky hair and a toothy smile.

I know. I'm updating this about 2-3 weeks after I first got there.  It went from a 3 to 1 purely because I got kicked out for NO apparent reason ... and here's why.

I was standing by the bar next to my boyfriend and I had rested my head on his shoulder area.  I was hugging him too - it was literally the stance of most couples when girls just want to rest their head on their guys. Literally 30 seconds after I did that, we got a tap on our shoulder saying that we had to go. WTF? Not wanting to cause a scene, we followed this bouncer to the door and he asked for my driver's license - so I gave it to him.  He then took my ID, wrote down my entire information, then gave that piece of paper to the bouncers at the entrance so that I couldn't back in ... since there's only one entry way into the club. 

First of all, can I just ask why I was kicked out?  I was perfectly fine - and the bouncer must've known since he asked ME for my ID, looked ME in the eye, gave ME BACK my own ID and watched me walk off perfectly fine. Now, I'm not going to lie and say that I was sober, but I was DEFINITELY not drunk to the point where it's obvious that I need to be kicked out. 

Secondly, if you bouncers are going to be strict, don't be looking around the bar for people to kick out. Because guess what?  My friend YACKED in the MIDDLE of the dance floor. Did he get kicked out? No. And I was kicked out for resting my head on my boyfriend's shoulder?  I wasn't stumbling, I wasn't all over the place. and I wasn't even near yacking or looking like I needed to. 

This club is ridiculous. 
I had SUCH high expectations and I've given this club a second chance that it COMPLETELY ruined - on my birthday weekend too. 

The only good part? The promoter was nice and got us girls in fast.  But after that - downhill. I will avoid this club at ALL costs.  And I suggest you guys do the same -  it's NOT worth it. At all. It's to the point where Marquee seems better. I mean it does have re-entry and an outdoor pool area.

Michelin Star #40

Just because it's expensive doesn't mean it's good. 

It's really not fair to Le Cirque that this was our dinner the night after a magical time at Guy Savoy (GS), but that's how the cookie crumbled. 

The gaudy interior took me back to Jol Robuchon and made me long for the clean and modern space of GS:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#Pz6MCvMoqe20cjiEN61ICA

We elected the full Degustation Menu and each got different things to maximize the number of dished to try. At $135pp plus $88 to share a wine pairing, Le Cirque really sticks it to you, which I'm fine with if the food is great. 

In short, we were not impressed by much and some of the food was just bad. The service was stuffy, borderline arrogant at times, and without stealth. Pretty much the opposite of GS. 

It wasn't all bad though, the poached egg with caviar ($15 extra) was very nice. The veggies were cooked right and the paprika crostini was a delight;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#HSFKfMYBwPd6Ti0H4rkfjA

The uni and yuzu gelee panna cotta was also a very nice and refreshing treat. But uni and caviar on anything is great;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#7dEMzWlg6QWbfEmIdcXxCw

Sadly, the foie was overcooked and tasted like iron;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#oowkr4-kGh57Y4nr4ZGF2w

The langoustine was bland, but I did love the plate it came on;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#ut_8e57Qx0CenHudGsRTJQ

The john dory was inexcusably bland and devoid of flavor. I couldn't believe how sub-par this dish was;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#dVF_SYM3fhMsoCVWu4o9gA

The potato wrapped bass was another let down, just lacking any seasoning and of course a place like this doesn't have salt and pepper on the table;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#YRbileTLomHKFQSDkN4F_A

The $65 supplement for the A4 wagyu was a complete waste. The meat had little marbeling left and was pretty chewy throughout. This was nothing like the beef you'd get in Japan;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#9zwWrrYAV2cQ0ZMv7HHA2Q

The duck was the worst offender of the night, with un-rendered fat, chewy skin, and meat so raw it couldn't be cut with their dull knives, we ate two pieces and left the rest;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#nL9yA-rNByjeeK6Z64c7Hg

Dessert however was great, the souffl was amazing;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#YnVOCWLwVeNzAsTT_p71KQ

And the sugar sphere thingy was beautiful and contained a delicious center;
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cirque-las-vegas?select=viQr698x1TTBGTeandFdcQ#uTC99JJzT08_T21tppclug

Overall it was a big letdown and not worth the effort to give a more detailed breakdown of each dish.

Recently featured as a ROTD, my BF and I came by for dinner. Prices are all over the place, with a few good deals but a lot need to come down a buck or two to be reasonable. We were one of two tables, yet our order took 25 minutes to come out and the entre was unacceptable in quality. 

FRIED MUSHROOMS: $7 for 8 button mushrooms. Lovely crispy breading.
FRIED PICKLES: $5, overbattered and greasy but sweet-and-spicy dipping sauce was awesome.
FOOTLONG CHILI DOG: $8, shriveled hotdog looked like jerky it was so overcooked and the chili looked and tasted like it came from a can. One of the worst things I've ever been served in a restaurant. Intended to split it with my guy, but neither of us would eat anything beyond that first bite.

Our waitress noticed our uneaten meal and we expressed our dissatisfaction. They offered to box it up but not to remake it. She removed the hotdog from our table, showed it to the female manager, Kelly, (who left the scene and never returned), and brought us our check along with a comment card, stating that "the system" did not "allow" her to give any "discounts" but that we were welcome to leave feedback. The hotdog was still on the bill despite being sent back because it was inedible.

We asked to speak to management (who should have taken the initiative to come speak to us), and the male owner, Robert, came out and asked what the problem was.  We again reiterated that the hotdog was inedible, both looking and tasting like it was made yesterday. 

His response? A defensive, "Well that's just like, your opinion." Literally. His exact response, no irony whatsoever. He then went on to rant about how he's "not afraid of bad Yelps" and his food is made to order and if we're dissatisfied that's our prerogative and it must be our first visit because he "doesn't give discounts."
In the end, unable to reach a civil agreement, we were given the ultimatum to pay in full for a half-uneaten meal or he "could comp the whole thing, whatever."  I assume that was intended as a bluff but I simply left. 

I like their concept, but management is completely unprofessional and has no idea how to run a business or a restaurant- which was evident when they were featured on the show Hungry Investors.  Clearly they were unable to benefit from the publicity and learn from the experience- the same issues that held them back then are still here now.

EDIT: As of the time of this review, there are nearly 70 "filtered" reviews at the bottom of this page. If that's not a red flag, I don't know what is. Most of them are single-star experiences with terrible service and/or food as well.

Where do I start with DW Bistro?  First of all DW has been a long time bookmark for me.  I never had the opportunity until recently with a bunch of Yelp peeps. Read the reviews and one thing in common with everyones review is the wait. So, if you're a patient person, DW's is worth if for you.  I'm one of those impatient people, but had no issues hanging out with a bunch of Yelp buds while our table was being prepared. 

Ambiance...so cool.  I love the decor, specifically the art pieces by Pamela Nielsen. One thing about the decor here is that it keeps you calm.  No angry colors anywhere in this joint.  However, the prices to these pieces are pretty expensive even with the DW discount.  If I ever was to meet that sugar mama, the artwork from Pamela Nielsen would be on my list of gifts.  So right now, it's just on my wish list.  But I did get her card for one of those "I don't care about money" days. 

Price is about right for the type of food this place serves.  Food presentation is the key to places like this and DW's definitely got this part right.  All their dishes are well portioned, meaning huge, and the presentation of each dish is prepped so nicely that it made it even tougher to eat.  But for someone like me, this wasn't going to be a problem since food is my number one priority. For brunch, I ended up getting their Filet Mignon and Eggs.  By the way, this dish is not on their normal menu.  This dish comes with two 4 oz filets, 2 eggs, and some bread.  I killed this meal with the quickness so it would be tough for me to say I didn't like it. I love me some red meat and red meat for brunch made meal #3 for the day just perfect. 

Service here is great considering how busy this place gets. We had a party of 10+ and our server dealt with us as best as he can.  Busy is an understatement here.  Yes, you have to get here before they open and line up.  We were one of the lucky ones to be here before opening and I really feel sorry for the folks that waited over an hour just to be seated.  Actually, I don't feel bad. Their bad for coming in late. 

PS:  Vanessa N shout out.  DW Bistro is super super super good.

Wolfgang Puck was our first stop after arriving in Las Vegas. Hungry and tired from the long flight (just kidding it was only an hour) we needed to have lunch and a drink. We had our 21-year-old Grandaughter with us, and found it just weird to hear her order a drink- She was a baby just yesterday. She got carded and took great joy in showing her ID. The bartender spotted it immediately. He surprised her later with a fabulous dessert.
I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, and I must say, they were right up there with some of the best. Mr. H enjoyed a scrupulous pulled pork sandwich. Our girl ordered a Pizza. It's true that the old Wolfgang knows his pizza. If this franchise were in Oakland I would start eating pizza.  
Now, for baby girls dessert. On a very large plate, a slice of banana cream pie was placed next to a halved Bruleed banana. I believe that was the best banana I ever tasted. I mean really...who brulees a banana. "Nothing says dessert like a propane torch".
Yes there was even a dollop of whipped cream. AND, on the plate, in chocolate, was a hand written Birthday wish. What a fabulous way to arrive in Las Vegas.
Our experience was so great that we decided at that moment to have our Thanksgiving dinner there. It too was amazing. 
Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill is located in the MGM Grand. 
I Highly recommend it. It's not to fancy and not to casual. 
Great food and great service

Came here for linner on our last day in Vegas with the BFF's.  The reviews here were hit and miss so I wasn't sure what to expect however I had to see for myself and I'm glad I did.

Orders some things to share:

Gyoza http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukumimi-ramen-las-vegas?select=thk-uibVpXaTt1aA87myVA#OXqKLZIdDF0zP5AdcNFENg  Nice flavored filling a little on the smaller side but its pretty good.

Karrage ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukumimi-ramen-las-vegas?select=thk-uibVpXaTt1aA87myVA#EZbMXlry4Ef4DiW1Y_yLZQ  Typical in most Japanese restaurants and something that I definitely enjoy eating.  It came out hot and tasty.

Honey Garlic Chicken ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukumimi-ramen-las-vegas?select=thk-uibVpXaTt1aA87myVA#8QLZ0rXxVN1Fk-IVPt-7qw  This I was not sure what to expect but I was presently surprised at how tasty it was.  The garlic flavor was very light almost non existent but thats coming from a person that luvs a lot of garlic so to me it was light.  Perfect amount of sweetness from the honey.  This was really good!

Kara miso ramen ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukumimi-ramen-las-vegas?select=thk-uibVpXaTt1aA87myVA#zcJ8OaJXqiO6b-CJbjYAVg  This was what the waitress recommended when I asked which she preferred between this and the Tantanmen. When it first arrived I was a bit shocked with what looked to be a good amount of red chili powder.  I like spicy but there is a limit to how much I can handle it and was a bit worried.  I mixed it all in and took my first sip and I was hooked.  A nice miso flavor with a perfect amount of heat.  It wasn't salty at all.  You cant see the ajitama but it had a medium yolk which I luv with a light flavor.  The chashu was fatty and flavorful.  This was a great bowl of ramen!

Eyes ~ Oh that looks spicy!
Nose ~ Smells Yummers.
Ear ~ Everyone happy slurping ramen..
Mouth ~ Oh yeah eveything tastes really good!
Tummy ~ Very Satisfied.

Whoever's got the Gold makes the rules and Mrs. White makes gold in that kitchen.

While I'm pretty sure that's not the golden rule Mrs. White is talking about, I think this one is more fitting! Her Smothered Chicken Fried Steak, dripping in gravy might as well have been dripping in gold, it tasted awesome! I ordered mine up with Mac N Cheese and Sweet Potatoes, deciding on those over the okra and the collard greens was tough, but worth it.

Unless you're on one of those reverse diet plans eating a minimum number of calories like an Olympic swimmer, you had better check you diets at the door; this ain't no place for calorie countin'. I told mine I was going out for a light jog on my lunch that day; "You really don't need to come along." I told her; I hope she bought it! 

The ambiance here is likened more to a waffle house experience than 5 star dining, with old school fast food type booths and seating. While you're here, read the wall closely enough, and you will find many Cool signatures penned right on to it. Famous musical entertainers, local and nationally accomplished athletes, and other famed diners can all be found to have dined here once upon a time.

Our waitress was surprisingly fit and trim for someone who serves food at a Soul Food spot. I had to ask, "Just how do you keep that girlish figure while working and dining here?" which she replied with "running back and forth with orders all day" and "hiking my favorite trails" on her off days. I have to note that she is now my new inspiration. Maybe I need to get a job here. I wonder how that would go over for my diet plan? Hmmmm.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, it's time to go for gold!

Fuck this place.

Yes, I said it and even after 6 years, I will still say it.

So the girls and I are on a tear it up Vegas weekend. All very cute and sessy gals for the record and all gals who appreciate the less than finer things in life like fake boobied strippers, over-priced drinks and titty bars. 

So we cab it over to the Crazy Horse Too after hearing that THIS was THE place to go. We roll up and instantly get static at the door. You can't come in without a date. Um, okay, well we are a bunch of girls with lots of money to spend? NO! But...? NO!

So we walk a few feet away and regroup while trying to keep the temper of one Drunky MaGoo down to a manageable level since the a-hole of a door guy was especially rude to this one girl in our group. I suggest grabbing a few guys and rollin in with them. I mean who cares, we can ditch them at the door but at least it gets us in. So we latch onto said guys and walk up.

Door guy says, NO!

I say, "You said dates, these are our dates. We are in love, let us in." (Mind you I'm drunk and his anger is amusing me at this point)

Door guy says, "fine you can come in, but that one stays out!" (pointing to my friend)

I say, "Come on, don't be THAT guy, did mama raise you to be THAT guy? She just really wants to see some boobs, surely you can relate."

Apparently he couldn't, but I also think he was suffering from mama abandonment issues and clearly wasn't loved enough as a child, but I digress...

He then decides that none of us should be allowed to come in. Fine, I'd rather not go if my friend is going to not be let in, so just give us our money back and we will go spend it elsewhere, right?

Apparently this is when the poor chap lost all sense of hearing as i became invisible and mute in his eyes.

"Excuse me, I said we'll go. Can you please just give us our money back?"

"Hello?"

"Umm"

"Yo!"

Retard Roy then starts smirking and it is quite clear that the four of us who "got in" will not be getting our money back, even though we technically never even entered the club. 

I then followed up with calls to the establishment the next day that were (to no surprise) never returned. Maybe they are in cahoots with Prime Time Shuttle as their customer service seems to be pretty dead on.

So if you are a girl don't go here. If you are a guy, have at it, but why waste your money on a place that won't let cute girls in who might actually go home with you for free. Just sayin.

Ashlee Simpson celebrated her birthday at Wet Republic last weekend: Hot.

I celebrated my birthday at Wet Republic this weekend: HOTTER!

You know you're having a truly fabulous time if you're taking shots with complete strangers and then find yourself having a chicken fight with random people in the pool. 

There's eye candy galore for all; everyone there is beautiful. We even spotted a Brad Pitt and Angelina look-a-like couple. They could have really been there, but we were so sloshed, who knows. 

We arrived early - at 11am to be exact. Doors opened five minutes later, and since we were pretty much the only people there, all of us girls got in free. Surprisingly, there was no line, since you typically have to get there at least half an hour before doors open to get in line. We were also lucky to get first pick of chairs (green lounge chairs inside the pool are the only free seats), so we got the best ones near the pool. We got the two $100 chairs (the drink/food minimum) on one end of the pool that were situated in their own little cove with two green chairs right next to them. 

The $100 minimum is easily met, especially if you get pitchers of their frozen drinks (the frozen watermelon mojitos are awesome), which start at $75. Plus the food is really yummy, and are huge portions meant for sharing. We got a bucket of tasty chicken tenders and waffle fries, and the Philly cheese steak quesadillas (only so-so). 

Although the pool was pretty dead to start, it got crazy later on. Now, if you can party all day here, in the sun, drinking non-stop, and still be able to go out clubbing until 4am, I take my hat off to you; you are a true rockstar.

It's been a couple of years since I last reviewed this place. Thankfully, Asian Island is still standing tall and cooking up delicious and fresh food at a great value. The chefs are very talented as they wok and roll cooking up their culinary masterpieces.

They have free delivery which I have used on occasion, especially when the Blackhawks were making their most recent Stanley Cup run. No way was I tearing myself away from the game. But I usually drop by to eat at the restaurant. The families that run this place are really friendly and care if you have a satisfying meal. If you want more bell peppers and less onions, no problem. So don't be afraid to speak up for substitutions or if you're not digging your entree. And of course, they are appreciative of positive feedback as well. As a side note, one Yelper mentioned that there was a lack of protein in his Mongolian Beef, I find that hard to believe.

 I actually ask for less meat for my signature dish of  Mongolian Beef and get a bunch of broccoli added.  All dishes are served with ample amount of food. Some other favorites include the Orange Chicken, Egg Drop Soup, Chicken Lo Mein, Shrimp Lo Mein and Happy Family. I'm not a Sushi eater so I can't attest to that part of the menu. But I have seen a lot of Sushi orders in the dining room. These guys don't have the name recognition of a couple of other Asian restaurants in the general area, but they are truly the tastiest option. Believe me, I have tried them all.

Before anything else, let me just state that I hate driving to downtown LV because I have no patience to parallel park my yacht, I'm too cheap to pay for parking and there's always some crazy/drunk person crossing the street when they're not supposed to tempting me to run them over.    

/endrant

I read on a review to park in DT garage 3 - well, I didn't do that. You can also parallel park in front of the restaurant or across the street - I didn't do that either. I parked at Binion's which is a short walk from Pizza Rock. I was told that the DT garage is a mess anyway. I had no clue where I needed to walk after parking my car so I followed a showgirl wearing sparkly stuff and feathers. She was walking towards the opposite direction - I was late for dinner but I got pics of her nice cheeks!

/endshenanigans

The place is filled with TV's so you can watch sports. There's a big rig coming out of the wall. Sheet metal with a heart, spade, club, diamond cut out on the ceiling. I got a Chimay...3/4 of it since 1/4 of it ended up on the table when it was put in front of me. They were giving me a grapefruit drink which I apparently ordered and not a Chimay. I hate grapefruit so let me go ahead and order me a grapefruit drink because that makes sense!

I was looking forward to trying their truffle fries/ rosemary garlic fries and Cal Italia pizza. So we get those plus meatballs and margherita pizza. Kacey informed us that this is the same as Tony's Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco. She was right. Same menu and everything. We were debating whether or no we should get a Sicilian pizza but it's $30...for a pizza? What?

Truffle Fries:
Fries were crispy inside and out. Truffle flavor was not noticeable. They drizzled a little bit of truffle oil, I only saw a few tiny specks of black truffles on these fries. Flavor was definitely lacking. 2/5

Rosemary Garlic Fries:
The rosemary taste was strong. I was hoping for more garlic flavor instead of GROSSmary. 2.5/5

Meatballs:
6 tender smelly balls. Smelly because of the cheese probably. They were ok. 3.5/5

Margherita Pizza:
Great crisp chewy crust. Real tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and basil. A pizza for the purists. 4/5

Cal italia:
Mario and Luigi did not approve of the Cal Italia. This California-inspired pizza was a Food Network Gold Medal winner if it matters to anyone. It has gorgonzola, asiago, mozzarella, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di Parma, Parmiggiano-Reggiano and balsamic reduction. Sweet and salty...not for the purists. I enjoyed this bastardized pizza. 5/5

We got a 20% discount for being locals. Their happy hour starts at 10pm and some menu items go for $3, $5 and $7. Service was not the best but it wasn't horrible. Pizzas were good but skip the fries. So, overall, this place deserves 3.5 stars.

Shortly after posting my review, I got a message from one of the owners and he said:

"Would like to send you some additional info on Pizza Rock:
- Free valet parking is available for Pizza Rock directly across the street at the Downtown Grand casino.
- The Sicilian pizza is a large format pizza and generally serves 3 people, hence the $30 price tag."

So there! Now you know.

SushiSamba

SushiSamba is an Asian Fusion type of Restaurant.  It takes the combination of Japanese, Brizilian and Peruvian cuisine to create their menu.  After attending a show in the area we had the craving for some Sushi.  We had decided on Sushisamba.

When we got there I think we were in between meals (lunch / dinner) so the place was now crowded.  It was kind of good like that, because it wasn't too loud and plenty of tables to select from.  Kind of dark, but yet nice ambiance.  A little music in the background, not too loud which allows you to have a nice comfortable conversation.  Not too dark to the point where you couldn't see what you were eating.  Here is what we decided to order:


Rock Shrimp Tempura 
Golden pea shoot, snap pea jullienne, spicy mayo, black truffle vinaigrette 18.00
Tasty...think I like this dish the best.  4 stars

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=YfPESP5vVgqKCRts_w9uKQ

Sea Bass and Miso  
Sea Bass on a skewer
Tasty and flavorful, the sauce was on the sweet side.  But when your hungry your hungry.  4 stars

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=qyYOuNCdfMW8winJG3KKZQ

Yellowtail jalapeo and lemongrass 14.00
This dish...I really didn't get to taste but a piece of....but the Yellowtail seem to have been warmer than room temperature.  Normally they are served slightly below room temperature.  
Overall 3.5 stars.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=pld_gLNKWlhXqqZuMCerHw

Green Envy 
tuna, salmon, asparagus, wasabi pea crust, aji amarillo-key lime mayo 13.00
This dish was nicely prepared.  A good mixture of the Salmon and Tuna.
Overall 3.5 stars

Rainbow Dragon 
freshwater eel, red bell pepper, cucumber, mango, avocado 15.00
I've had better Rainbow Dragon Rolls....but it was good enough to pass the average taste level for me.  
Overall 3.5 stars

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA?select=XH1kDM59gYRAqYPJ2lVnqQ

Overall dinning experience was excellent.
I'm glad they had such a nice ambiance.
Our service was excellent.
Our drinks were good.
Suggestions and recommendation from our waiter was on point.
Will return when in Vegas.
Overall rating / experience -  4 stars.

Coco Donuts is locally owned and opened recently. After seeing the pictures on yelp, I just had to try one of their cronuts! Walking in there was a nice sweet smell in the air and the inside was clean and colorful. I saw there were cronuts left and asked the woman behind the counter to go over the flavors with me, which she did and explained the prices. Hubby and I chose to get a 1/2 dozen donuts and a cronut to try.

I chose the "Raspberry Cronut" priced at $3 and wasn't crazy about it. The icing was just too overly sweet and the raspberry filling reminded me of Welch's jelly. I could only eat a couple of bites because it was just too sweet. The cronut was also tough and not flaky like I'd imagined. If this is what Dominique Ansel's taste like, I'm not missing out. Next time I will try one without icing and see how it is.

-Raspberry Filled.... Same Welch's style jelly and the glaze was just too sweet. 

-Apple Filled... This one was good. There was a good amount of tasty apples in the center and the donut was very soft.

-Sugar Twist... Very soft and good, but nothing spectacular. 

-Cinnamon Roll... Soft, a bit too sweet and again, nothing spectacular.

-Chocolate Long John... This was very soft and delicious. It was also a decent size. 

-Chocolate Iced Bavarian Cream... The bavarian cream had no flavor, but the rest of the donut was good.

The donuts here are very, very soft. They are also a good size for the price, but this is just an average donut shop to me. Nothing really stood out and even though I love sweets, too many of the donuts here were just too sweet for me. The woman behind the counter was nice enough to give is 4 donut holes to try and again, they were melt in your mouth soft, but the glazed were just too sweet while the cinnamon sugar believe it or not was perfect. They have a punch card so if you are here buying donuts by the dozen the card will benefit you. The regular donuts are currently 95 cents each and the coffee prices $1.75 - $2.50 so I plan on stopping back by and trying out the coffee with a different cronut or donut to see what it's like.

Half Dozen $5.50 - $5.75
One Dozen $9.50 - $9.95

Specialty and Fancy donuts range from $1 - $3.50 each.

Monday - Friday: 5 am - 6:30 pm or sell out 
Saturday - Sunday: 5 am - 3 pm or sell out

Some of the best tacos I've ever had... But I have to update from my last review. It actually makes me sad to do this but my experience last night must be put out there. Here we go...

Came here last night around 7pm to grab some shrimp tacos (3 to be exact) and 1 shrimp burrito. The guy who took my order didn't speak a word of English, which is to be expected but not understanding the sentence "3 shrimp tacos on corn tortilla" isn't acceptable. 
So he starts the shrimp on the grill grabs one tortilla and says "what it". I remind him it's 3 tacos. He looks confused and had to ask someone what I was saying. He says ok gets three tortillas. He had to remake the first one 3 times because he kept putting the wrong thing on them. The shrimp is done and he puts exactly two shrimp pieces on each taco. When I've been here in the past there was always at least 6-7 pieces. When I try to ask him about this he shrugged. I decided to try and talk to someone else. He then proceeds to mess up the buritto as well by putting guac on it which I said no to. I get to the cashier and it got worse...
I walk up and attempt to explain my situation to her, I even show her the amount of shrimp on my tacos. She laughs, snatches my debit card out of my hand and charges me right away. It was $20. She charged me for the tacos he messed up and the guac on the buritto. Now the money is not the issue here, it's the fact she laughed and literally took my debit card from me without my permission. I did not sign the receipt so I will be filling a statement with my bank. 
This was unexceptable. I have never been treated like this as a passing customer and I will never return.

The decor for this place was definitely the best part. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f1eeViD_rhRG4-MIFgZsEA

It was a nice day so we got seated on the terrace overlooking the Vegas strip.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=FR6MuipnPqtxwIo9BUVZHA

There are some hotties working up in here.  I kept drooling over one of the waiters.  He was Asian, built, slight scruff, and had tattoos on his right arm.  I wanted to order him and take him to go but he wasn't on the menu :(

Order:  Crab cake, mac and cheese, pomme frites, Croque madame, and shrimp cocktail.  For dessert we ordered the caramel tart and the chocolate terrine.  

Crab cake came served with a remoulade and topped with a frisee salad.  It was actually pretty good, nice and meaty with large chunks of crab, yet it was still crispy and held up.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=p_zZ9eP10crf4OoTMMPw-w

Shrimp Cocktail came with huge jumbo shrimp.  I'm not a big cold shrimp fan so it was just okay for me.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f0eXikNX8SVFSiTNYpvs2Q

Croque Madame is basically a ham and cheese sandwich topped with an egg.  I wouldn't order it.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=hz67b-rY5NF_D8MfoFhpyw

Mac and Cheese came out awesome looking, but upon further tasting it fell pretty flat.  It needed something to lighten it up and give it some flavor.  My friend squeezed some lemon on it and she said it made it a lot better.  They need to work out that recipe and give it some ooomph!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=xWVNfswLh_diFTC__WeVMg

The chocolate terrine was too dark for me.  I normally enjoy dark chocolate but this was a tad too bitter for me.  It just tasted like straight up cocoa powder.  I wouldn't order it again.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=LeYT8q4sUDeDQrM6-jxIeA

The caramel tart was really good, but the crust was super stiff and thick which normally I like :)  but not in a dessert.  Flavor-wise though, it was the better of the two.  It came with caramel ice cream and candied macadamian nuts and wafers.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=Uv9LtnwzyrTIZFS6DEGv3w

The waiter was cordial and accommodating.  He was telling us about life in Vegas because I was thinking about applying to schools there.  Overall, it was a nice relaxing meal.  There were highs and lows but pretty solid still.

I attempted when they were in Henderson, but was a day late and a cup of shave ice short. They were apparently moving over to a spot in Chinatown (now open!) and I would have to wait a couple more weeks. While on a taco trek UYE last week I was told that SnowFlake Shavery would be added as one of our stops and was thrilled! This isn't ice cream and it isn't a sno-cone. I know there is a lot of confusion to what shave ice is and I am learning myself, but you wont find any artificial syrups here! If you haven't had it before, it is something you need to experience first hand. The appearance, texture and taste is something special. SnowFlake Shavery uses fresh and all natural ingredients. Flavors range from chocolate, vanilla, cantaloupe, mango, coconut, green tea, black sesame and depending on the season you might be lucky enough to try the banana! I missed out, but heard it was fantastic! 

Sizes: Regular ($3.49) Large ($4.75) Monster ($6.49)

Step 1 - Choose your flavor and size
Step 2 - Choose your toppings priced 50 cents each
Step 3 - Choose sauce priced at 25 cents each (first sauce is free) 

I ordered the "Ex-Straw-Binary" (regular) and it had strawberry snow, strawberries, strawberry sauce and I had them add chocolate sprinkles and extra strawberry condensed milk. The strawberry condensed milk is SO good! The shave ice is very light. The portions are big and even though the regular looks like something you wont be able to finish, give it a try because it wasn't filling at all to me. It was just refreshing and yummy. I will be back to try other flavors!

The employees are very friendly and willing to answer any questions you might have. If you aren't sure about a flavor just ask and they will give you a sample. Don't forget to ask for a rewards card because when you buy 10 you get one free!

I found my newest addiction this week. Beach Hut Deli! Originally I was going to eat at the Spicy Pickle down the street but found out it was closed. I pulled up good ole yelp on my phone and started to look for something nearby. All I had to do was look at the pictures of the sandwiches to know I wanted to eat at Beach Hut Deli.  

Upon walking in I felt like I was at the beach and that was cool by me. There were surfboards decorated on the walls and even some of the tabletops were shaped like a surfboard. The menu is on the wall and I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to try. I ordered a small "Santa Cruz" priced at $8.25 and it had pastrami, avocado, bacon and cream cheese. I got it with everything so it also included mayo, mustard, pickle, tomato, onion, greek peppers and cheese. This sandwich was SO good! I had to get a fork because the insides were just falling out. They didn't skimp on the sandwich at all. I will order this again without a doubt. Hubby ordered a large "Pastrami Sandwich" priced at $12.95 and it just had pastrami, cheese and mustard. He loved it! They have bottled soda or for $2 you can get a cup for the fountain machine that gives you unlimited refills for that visit. Honestly you could easily share a sandwich with someone too they look small in some of the pictures but I assure you they are chocked full. The food was delivered on a frisbee for a plate!

They have a patio area and a happy hour menu Mon-Fri. The sign inside said they currently offer happy hour all day long on Sundays. They have plenty of tv's on the walls too. They also offer catering and party trays or boxed lunches. If you haven't tried Beach Hut Deli yet and love GOOD sandwiches then stop by!

**This place looses a star because I got hasseled for writing this review!!* 
The Heard is many things to many people. 

For Non-natives it is a place to learn about the various cultures of ancient, recent historical and modern Native Culture. 

For Natives of the southwest - it is a place where we are understood and celebrated.

There are so many things I love about this place and I am pleased to share with you my favorite spots in the museum.
- The Navajo Sand painting that is displayed the Navajo Hogan in the Homelands Exhibit. It depicts the Navajo Creation Story and is intricate and beautiful.

- The Hopi Wedding Dress inside the Homelands Exhibit

- The Photograph of the Grave yard outside the Indian School in the Boarding School Experience. 

- The Statue of Native women outside the museum. 

- The Yazzie Mural inside the We Are exhibit. It depicts the story of the Navajo and Yaqui Tribe's modern history. 

-The beaded chucks in the Shoes exhibit! I want a pair!!

When it comes to the Heard's Gift shop: now this place is amazing!! Many of their pieces are authentic and hand crafted. BUT THERE ARE FAKES AMONG THEM!!! Feel free to ask a lot of questions. Even try to negotiate prices. You never know, some of those pieces have been there for YEARS! Demand certificates of authenticity. Ask to know the meaning of symbols and designs. Know what materials they're made out of! 

There could be two bracelets that almost identical and one could be silver plated and one could be solid silver. And they could both be priced the same. ASK QUESTIONS!! Ask to try to stuff on. They are usually pretty nice about this, except when it comes to earrings. Many hard to find books can be found here. Whenever someone is doing a research project, the Heard is one of the first places I recommend. I recommend the photography books.

Their exhibits are always changing. So check the website and see what's new. Have fun, bring a friend, and open your mind and see the many wonderful facets of Native American Culture.

****UPDATE****
One of our fellow yelpers Deb K. http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sGzHUN7UpjXUGKckrv-bTw has sent me private messages asking me to edit my review and I am! She believes and knows that all the pieces are authentic at the Heard's Gift Shop. 

She has said and I quote: "Hi Cher, Deb K. here--actually, I do work at the Heard and I can tell you that everything that we sell is authentic."  and she even goes on to say, "Maybe you're thinking about those dreamcatchers and whatnots in the back? Even those have to come from a Native-owned and operated establishment. [although I do agree they're kind of tacky, but you know the bilagaanas (White People)...they do like their kitschy stuff]" And what really got me was: "I really feel you should go back and change the part about the shop offering 'fake' items". 

As a Native American, sometimes it's a love/hate relationship with the Heard. The Heard is the premier launching pad for non-natives in this city to experience Indian Country but sometimes it comes at a price. We are often objectified and practically forced to share that which is sacred to us. But it's allowed and it's a choice that each Native artist that has dealt with has the Heard made for themselves. 

There is an unequal representation of Tribes on display at the Heard, the Navajo exhibit is HUGE at the Heard and yet the O'odham exhibit is medium sized. Even though O'odhams have contributed over $1,000,000.00 to the museum. We don't complain, atleast our ways are being shared right? And it's nice to take children to the museum and see their little eyes light up when they see things that reminds them of home. And the Boarding School Exhibit opens MANY eyes to the history that existed just a few blocks north. This slices through me and I'm so grateful this piece of history is no longer being ignored.

Like I said - it's a love/hate relationship. I love the Heard because they give opportunities to Native Artists and share our culture as sensitively as possible. But it's an uphill battle to be deemed good enough to be one of those artists and people who shares our culture. I know of many great people who I personally feel should be "let in" be denied and my heart goes out to them. I love that Natives still get in for free but I hate that the Heard treats AZ tribes like we're obligated to help them to keep their lights on. I love that all the tribes in Arizona have been given the oppurtunity to share a piece of their culture yet I hate that the museum focuses on two tribes.

To my yelpers: Please realize that each tribe has it's own ways and unique culture. Open your heart and mind and take in the colorful culture I grew up in!

My husband and I went to Las Vegas for a quick honeymoon after our wedding since we both had to go back to work. He booked Joel Robuchon after research and reading about how amazing this place is.  

Our trip to Joel Robuchon started out wonderful. A limo picked us up from our hotel and we got a walk through the gorgeous MGM mansion. The decor of the restaurant was beautiful. Then the wine list came and my husband LOVES wine so he asked to speak to the sommelier with a few questions about the wine. The sommelier arrived at our table and rather hesitatingly answered my husband's few questions then proceeded to steer us towards another page with the comment "I think you'll find these more in your.. price range"

record scratch.

uhm, excuse me?! Yes, we are both in our mid twenties and it doesn't help that we are asian and therefore look like we are in our teens but here we are, about to shell out at least $600 for a meal (ours ended up around $800) that comment was so unnecessary in so many ways. We were both shocked into silence and proceeded with our meal.

Then came time for dessert. During the course of our meal we saw the tables to our right, left, front, and back be served complimentary desserts/cakes for anniversaries, birthdays, etc. We ended up with nothing despite the fact that it was our honeymoon. I'm not one to complain about complimentary things but it was a little ridiculous considering literally everyone in the restaurant was getting them except us. Perhaps we were not in the.. price range..

Overall the food itself was really really spectacular. The bread and dessert cart was amazing and every dish that came along was just exquisite. However the service completely ruined our meal and it was really really disappointing. We've never dealt with such condescension at any restaurant and was definitely not expecting it from such a highly renowned place with a michelin star.

After 3 visits, it's time for a review. But first, I just have to address some of the other, more negative reviews - 

1. "The chalkboard is confusing" - No it's not. Find a beer you like the sound of, or the style, tell the server the number. Easy
2. "The colours of the chalk hurt my eyes" - really? get some glasses.
3. "It closes too early" - come earlier
4. "It's too busy" - come later
5. "I don't like craft beer" - don't come at all
6. "I have to share my table, eeew" - unless you are paying their bill, what's yer problem? make some new friends.
7. "It's too loud" - It's a bar, it's supposed to be loud
8. "the parking lot is too small" - be thankful that there is a (free) parking lot. There is always street parking or you could ride a bike.
9. "there's not enough bike parking" - chain it to a lamppost.
10. "The beers keep running out" - it is a rotating selection, they are not running out, they are changing.
11 & 12 "The beers are too expensive" - "Where is the Coors/Bud/Miller?" - I give up.

The fact that this bar is so unique is probably why so many people are confused and write dumbass reviews. It takes them out of their comfort zone. It is for this very reason that I am giving it 5 stars. Most places are exactly the same as everywhere else and kudos to Angel's Trumpet for daring to be different.

I love the beer selection, I love that I haven't heard of most of them. I also love the food. The onion and blue cheese quesadilla was amazing. The bison BLT in a blanket was a knockout and the avocado salad made my vegetarian girlfriend very happy. The service has been good all 3 visits.

What really blew my mind during the last visit was the quality of the music. When a bar plays The Jam, Madness, The Specials, The Clash, Talking Heads, Depeche Mode, The Police, The Beat, I know there is someone in charge (even if only in charge of the music) with good taste.

One suggestion - the chalkboard on the patio should be raised. It's too low when people sit at the table right next to it and difficult to read. Other than that one, very minor inconvenience, this place is unique and it rocks. I will be back for sure.

We are usually big fans of the foodie flavors that come out of Fox Concepts, but felt this one fell a little short for us.

True Food Kitchen is the brain-child of Dr. Andrew Weil and Sam Fox. Their two-fold mission is that every dish served must not only be delicious but must also promote the diner's well-being. Our palates were somewhat uninspired by the offerings

True Foods is also showcasing proper proportions and the benefits of an anti-inflammatory food pyramid diet of Dr Weil. The only problem is the menu prices need to go on a diet too.  Everything is tasty, but a tad pricey

Our introduction might have also been tempered by the amateurish hostess station, which seemed more interested in having a conversation with a girlfriend friend who stopped by, rather then sitting the customers.  We watched in amusement until our turn came. LOL  

Our server was a bit spacey too.  She was MIA for long stretches of time during our meal and was only bailed out by the other servers.

We tried the Spaghetti Squash (photo) with a "protein" of Chicken Sausage and the Teriyaki (photo) with a "protein" of chicken with brown rice. BTW, "protein" is True Kitchen's favorite add on noun.  

As for our meal, we found the squash was overwhelmed by it's spaghetti sauce, which was mildly spicy which we liked.  Though we really enjoyed the chicken sausage "protein".  As for the the Teriyaki it was somewhat bland and overwhelmed by the brown rice.  Hard to believe.  We did enjoy the Pomegranate Limeaide (photo) and the Honey Ice Teas.

Expect to pay around $30 per person, including one non alcoholic drink.  Our return factor is less than twenty percent.  Sorry.

SITEREP:
If you've been following along in the newspapers, Fox Restaurant Concepts made national headlines in February 2012, when PF Chang's acquired a 51 percent stake in True Foods after providing a initial $10 million in start up costs back in 2009.  http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2009/08/10/daily51.html
http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/morning_call/2012/02/pf-changs-buying-majority-stake-in.html

They are showcasing a cookbook from Dr. Weil and chef Michael Stebner which includes more than 125 original recipes.  On the menu you will find Spring Salad with Aged Provolone, Curried Cauliflower Soup, Corn-Ricotta Ravioli, Spicy Shrimp and Asian Noodles, Bison Umami Burgers, Chocolate Icebox Tart, and Pomegranate Martini and much more. 

They are hoping for a 50-restaurant rollout of the concept, over the next several years. The average 5,000 square feet True Foods space highlights the use of reclaimed wood and environmentally friendly materials, costing about $2.5 million and $3 million in each location.

I finally had dinner here after staying at the Venetian several times.  My friend and I ordered the escargots a la bourguignonne ($17.50 - red wine braised Burgundy snails w/ garlic butter & Bouchon pastry puff pastry);  petite plateau ($65 - a seafood tower w/ a 1/2 lobster, 8 oysters, 4 shrimp, 4 clams and 8 mussels; gigot d'Agneau ($33.95 - roasted leg of lamb w/ wilted cavolo nero, garden rhubarb, nicoise olives, crispy panisse and lamb jus); and saumon poele ($36.50 - sauteed Scottish salmon ministra w/ manila clams, salsify, oyster mushrooms and young artichokes - not pictured).

The escargots were the best ones I have ever had.  In most restaurants the garlic and butter overpower the snails.  Not in this case.  The snails were large, uber fresh, super tender and their was just enough sauce to flavor the snails:  5 Stars.  The seafood tower was also excellent.  The seafood was uber fresh and the star of the tower was the oysters and clams.  The brininess of the ocean where each oyster came from stood out:  5 Stars.  Our entrees were very good.  The gigot d'Agneau was very well thought out by chef Thomas Keller.  The lamb was medium rare and the combination of sweetness of the cavolo nero (an Italian kale), and the tartness of the olives went well w/ the strong flavor of the lamb.  The crispness of the panisse (a chickpea flourcake) also contrasted nicely.  I did not snap a pic of my friend's salmon but he said it was very good also.

To accompany the meal we ordered a 1/2 bottle of Louis Jadot Beaune Theurons Pinot Noir ($50).  My friend is a wine connoisseur and he never steers us wrong.  The wine was excellent and the winery is one of the renowned ones in this region in France that produces light, fruity wines that go well w/ meat, seafood and cheese:  5 Stars.

The only downside to the meal was the service was spotty.  We arrived early and we went to have drinks in the bar.  We didn't see a waiter so I went to the bar.  There were two bartenders and one managerial type.  It took a while for one of the two bartenders to notice me.  In addition, when I asked to charge it to my room, the bartender said I had to fill out some slip - WTF?!?!?!  When I checked in the person said I could use my keycard to pay for meals, et al.  I ended up using my credit card.  Secondarily, when we were seated the hostess tried to put us in a table for two next to a post.  The seat next to the post did not have much hip room.  My friend and I are both 6'2" and 225+.  We asked to be seated at a table for four and the hostess displayed a bit of displeasure.  Come on girl!!!  It was not that busy and we were going to drop $300 - We deserved a large enough table to hold our Petite Plateau!!!  Lastly, the shrimp were not peeled and the lobster was not cracked.  We understood the foregoing because the chef wants to demonstrate the freshness of the seafood.  However, when we mentioned it to the waiter, all he did was apologize vs offering a solution.  I said OK, and ate the lobster head like a "Hombre de Cavernas", much to the chagrin of some clients.  F*ck em!!!  I wanted to get all the meat out:  2 Stars on service.

The ambiance is excellent.  There is a fresh seafood bar on your left when you walk in.  The bar is also very nice with a large clock in background.  Lastly, the restaurant reminds you of Bistro in Paris:  5 Stars.

I will definitely come back to Bouchon when I am in Vegas.  I always stay at the V, so Bouchon is easy to find on the 10th floor.

I like Big Wong and I cannot lie. This strangely named restaurant just opened today. If you happen to catch this review soon enough, you can drop in and get a free entree with the purchase of a $1 soda or bottled water. It's for dine-in only and is valid through May 18.

I stopped by for lunch and ordered the Authentic Curry Chicken Over Rice. This dish normally costs $4.95 but was free with my $1 can of ginger ale. So how was it? It was actually very good. For $4.95, it's a great deal. For free, it's a steal!

Everything on their menu is $4.95 with one item coming in at $3.95. You'd think that you were looking at the lunch menu, but no my friends. This is their regular menu. If this place was open after midnight, it would be the new unquestioned late night king.

I'm inclined to give this place four stars based on the one dish I've tried so far, and the extremely fast and friendly service. Add in the fact that everything is under $5 - oh and that's tax included - and I'm glad to bump that up to a fiver.

This is a fairly long story. And I will do my best to be fair, not angry. 

Last week we brought 3 dogs in for grooming. 1 small dog (4 lb Yorkie) and 2 larger dogs (20-23 lbs each). When I went in, I was alone. I brought the larger dogs in first. The yorkie was in the car with the window cracked, fan on and water in the car for approximately 3 minutes. 

Everyone was very helpful in trying to get us all in quickly because I was alone with 3 crazy dogs! For that I am grateful. The owner even asked if I wanted help. Very nice and concerned which I appreciated. I told her it was fine and easier for me to do it on my own. 

I spoke with the groomer regarding the needs of my small dog. She is fidgety, scared and has had a bad grooming experience in the past. I asked her to be careful around sensitive areas (ears, nose, nails etc..) and not to worry if she couldn't do them. 
I left feeling very confident and everyone in the store was very nice. 

About 3 hours after their appointment I called to see if they were ready. We arrived to pick them up and the girl at the front stated that the groomer wanted to talk to us. 

The big dogs were fine. The little one had been cut just under her eye. The small wound was causing bleeding in and around her eye. She was fully groomed. The groomer informed me she hadn't called because she was new, didn't know the policies and was scared. She told me she hadn't told anyone what happened. 

We took our dogs and went to the front. The owners were not there. An associate spoke with us and I was upset and angry that we hadn't been called. A woman told me that I needed to calm down (mistake). 

We took the dog to the vet and she required 3 stitches which meant she needed anesthesia. 

We went in yesterday to meet with the owner regarding the situation. We explained that we are not upset the dog was hurt. These things happen. What we are upset about is the way it had been handled. 

* We were not called to be told the dog was hurt. 
* We do not know how long she sat there with a cut on her eye that needed medical attention. 
* The groomer admitted to being afraid to call. This meant our dog was put in harms way when she should have been treated. 

The owner wanted us to pay for the other 2 dogs. Ultimately she would put their services toward the vet bill. This way her groomer could be paid. I did not not think we should pay anything. Neither did my husband. Had she been open and honest and called us, I would gladly have paid. 

We mentioned that we would do what we felt necessary if they were going to pay us for only part of the bill. She asked if we were threatening her and my husband told her absolutely not.  We were told we were being taped (both audio and visual). My husband and the owner continued to discuss the situation. She then looked at me, pointed her finger to my face and said "YOU left your dog in the car. I was the one who was worried about her. I bet you didn't tell your husband that did you". This was on the floor of her store. I told her it was irrelevant because my dog was fine and safe. My husband started to talk to her and she stalked away. 

She returned with the check, paid in full and we thanked her. 

I am posting this for people to make their own judgements. This could have and should have been handled better. Again, things happen and dogs get hurt. Especially fidgety ones. I appreciate that no excuses were made for the groomer, but the way we (and our dog) were treated was not ok. And I think people need to know about it.

Dolla dolla bills, y'all... on the ceiling, that is. This place is covered with personalized dollar bills, and if you look closely enough you'll see some Chilean currency up there courtesy of my group the other week. 

It seems like everyone has that one dive bar that they're just in love with, where the bartenders know you and hook you up with a free drink or two once in a while, where the ambiance is nothing to write home about but somehow it always manages to provide a good time. This seemed to be the place for my Phoenix coworker, the lovely Lindsey F, and she raved about it the whole week we were visiting her in Scottsdale. Finally, on the last night we were able to stop by to see for ourselves, and it lived up to the hype! 

This is the kind of place where there's no need to ask for a drink menu. In fact, I'm pretty sure they don't even have a drink menu. Just order a beer off the tap or your go-to cocktail, or ask the bartender to surprise you with a special shot (something we did quite a few times and weren't disappointed). 

If you request a song with the DJ it's likely to come on about 10 seconds after, which is awesome and rare. It's here that I first learned of the Cupid Shuffle, though it seemed like everyone else in the bar was already a pro. Old dudes, college kids, everyone seems to gather here to relax, and there's plenty to keep you occupied. 

You might think these places are a dime a dozen, but it's actually a fine craft to perfect the ideal dive bar. So congrats, Pattie's - you may not have craft cocktails but you have the craft of dive bars down pat(ties)!

Vegas local, here. I live at MGM/Signature.

SLS is at the very last Monorail stop at the far north end of the strip where the old Sahara hotel used to be. SLS definitely isn't 'ghetto'. I try to reserve that word for hotels like The Stratosphere and Circus Circus that truly are low-class, both inside and out. But let's just say the SLS is underwhelming. You can probably skip this place on your next Vegas trip.

The whole establishment gave me a really negative feeling inside. I'm not a New Ager so I don't really buy into the idea of positive and negative "vibes" or "energies"... but I've gotta say, something felt off about the place. Other things just left me scratching my head.

One of the head scratchers is the hotel's theme. What's their target demographic? Who are they trying to appeal to? They had a Pancake Griddle in there with a line of senior citizens out the door. The wait time must've been two hours or more. But then adjacent to that, they're trying to promote a nightclub. I can easily envision a late evening scenario where the long lines of seniors (some with walkers, wheelchairs, etc.) who are waiting to eat at one of the restaurants gradually gets intertwined with the twenty-somethings waiting for the nightclub. Seems like that could be awkward.

The floor in one area of the hotel was covered with what appeared to be fur or hair. I suspect there were farm animals in the hotel at one point. But why?

The part that bothered me the most though was the massive, rather intimidating security presence on the casino floor. Felt like I was in Ferguson, MO. or something. I took out my iPhone to video one of the restaurants that I thought had a really interesting decor, thinking I'd post it on my Facebook -- but within seconds, one of the guards approached me and said that no photographs or videos were permitted in the hotel. The dude wasn't messing around and I'm not exactly an alpha male who's prone to challenging people, so I quietly complied and then subsequently deleted the video.

He was professional and respectful to me and went out of his way to let me know why no photos are allowed: "because of 9/11". Really? Because of 9/11? I was tempted to give him a "What'choo' talking' 'bout, Willis?" because every other strip location I've visited seems to have no prohibitions on videos/photos (unless you're trying to video a card game, etc.) -- but whatever.

Anyway, I kind of feel like the SLS views all of their patrons as suspects or potential threats. I hightailed it out of there and likely won't return. The whole thing makes me realize how important it is for me to stay in my "safe zone": Caesars, Mirage, Aria, Cosmo, Mandalay, Fashion Show Mall, and of course my home base at MGM. People seem to like me at those places and value my business (or at least they do a good job of faking it) but man, if I stray a bit too far north, it's downright hostile! 

My recommendation is to skip SLS. So many great hotels in this town. No need to waste your time here.

My overall experience was good, however some elements weren't so hot...

Room: 
Sucked. I stayed in what I believe was most modest accommodation they have (think they call it the "wonderful") and space-wise it was a little cramped. The bathroom wasn't "sufficiently separated" from the main room (I won't go into greater detail than that :). Also I'm not a TV person, but if I was I'd have been pissed off about where they placed the flatscreen. You can't watch TV comfortably from your bed (and it's not like there was any other place to relax in room). 

Staff: 
Fantastic. From the front desk people, to the concierge (Alyssa), to the waitresses in all of their bars and restaurants, everybody (and I do mean everybody) was really friendly and helpful. I've been to a lot of W Hotels that don't provide this level of service.

Entertainment: 
Good. The pool is great during the day and at night turns into a decent hotspot. Not having to deal with the gianormous bouncer by flashing your room key is a nice perk. The location of the hotel is excellent, some of the bigger bars and clubs are a block away (and Scottsdale isn't known for it's walkability). 

Final word: 
Solid hotel for a bachelor party, guys weekend, etc. It's very much a scene and is clearly targeted at the 20s and 30s "out on the town" crowd. So if you're not looking for that type of scene, you'll probably want to pick something else.

Disclosure: My friend who works for Starwood got me a friends and family discount, I paid around $150/night.

Seven adult Yelpers and two young ones got together yesterday to give the new restaurant a go.  Opened just a week, the place has a winning combination of choices and flavors.

The Radar O'Reilly of our group (that's meant in the kindest way) had emailed the restaurant and arranged our tasting session picking from the most common dishes selected by the group.  It was a great idea in theory and execution.  Just as Radar procured things the 4077th needed, our Radar arranged our brunch perfectly.

We ordered:  bacon cheddar biscuits with honey salt butter; country house pt with pickles, fruit mostarda, and grilled bread; Cheesy garlic toast made with four cheeses; pimento cheese with Saltines, pretzel chips,and  breakfast radishes; smokey bleu cheese fondue with salt and pepper chips; black mission figs with goat cheese, pistachios, pomegranate seeds, and arugula; baked artichoke with Freekeh stuffing; dirty mac and cheese with burnt pork ends, four cheeses and Ritz cracker crust; butcher style chicken wings the menu describes as hot smoked, flash fried, salt & vinegar, sriracha. Buffalo or BBQ; bacon and eggs with thick bacon, deviled eggs, red onion jam and multi grain toast; breakfast poutine with two poached eggs on top of fries with turkey gravy and cheese curds; doughnut holes with dusted with cinnamon and served with a berry dip; load S'mores nachos made with graham crackers, torched marshmallows, toasted walnuts, Oreo cookie crumbs, chocolate sauce, and fluff cream; and last, banana pudding with Nilla wafers, salted caramel, and whipped cream.

The foods were all good.  My favorites would be the bleu cheese fondue, the pt, the bacon and eggs, breakfast poutine, and the cheddar bacon biscuits.  I'd go back alone and have just the bleu cheese fondue and the poutine.  If the skillet with the leftover bleu cheese had fit in my pocket without spilling, it would be sitting in my kitchen, empty and clean.  I thought if I walked through Tivoli Village just holding it upright, people might think I was panhandling--literally and figuratively.  The poutine was excellent and now I know why might Canadian friends rave!  The desserts were excellent, too, but of the three, get the S'mores nachos.

Service was superb throughout!  Chef Canteenwalla came to our table and spent a good amount of time with us explaining the restaurant and the concepts behind it.  We had a group photo taken with him and he was very outgoing!

This is a wonderful new restaurant on the West side and they have their good game on even though they've been open for just a week.  I can't wait to go back.  Fondue, you're mine!

It's a strange phenomenon that happens so very rarely, where something is redone, a song or movie for example, and ends up better than the source material -- 

*More Real Than The Original*

...Buffy the Vampire Slayer television show vs. movie  

...Jimi Hendrix vs. Bob Dylan All Along The Watchtower (even Dylan admitted it was Jimi's song now)

There is a restaurant concept sweeping the valley right now, based on a certain small number (between 1 and 3) of people of a certain philosophy (free-wheeling, nature-loving, noodly-music-listening) and their crazy atmosphere establishments full of odd "paraphernalia".

Well, think about how one of those places got your hopes up and then  left them dashed, and head on over to Rocket Burgers & Subs for everything you thought you'd get with those other guys:

~A fresh, clean, uncluttered atmosphere that you can sit comfortably inside of while enjoying your meal.
~A HUGE selection of almost any kind of soft drink you'd desire to quench that thirsty, dry mouth of yours.
~Lots of variety of menu, all with inexpensive good quality items of decent portion
~A radio playing the xmsirius Grateful Dead Channel for your soothing/stimulating dining pleasure.
~and a couple of really nice, friendly, hippy-on-the-inside-not-just-for-show restauranteurs eager to discuss their business and products, who are not only present now, but seem that they'll be sticking around to ensure the quality and value of their new place doesn't wane.

The food is fresh, fast, and inexpensive.  If you want burgers, subs, dogs, pizza-bread, gyro, salad, handmade fries &  onion rings, PBJ with homemade jam  -- they've got it.  The chicken sandwich had a light crispy breading and a solid chunk of breast meat.  The burger was a smaller patty (available as a double) but not dry, and the condiments were fresh and generous.  
For both sandwiches, the standout part was the fresh bun from Simply Bread (local).  It was soft/firm enough to be just right, and had great flavor.
They have a cooler chock full of interesting and bizarre selections from Pop The Soda Shop (Jones Soda, imported ginger ales and root beers, glass bottle real sugar sodas from mexico, dublin dr pepper, etc). My spicy Bleinheim Ginger Ale did not skimp on the ginger flavor!

A couple of real ex hippies would do it like this -- 
no flashy superficial emphasis on outward appearances and gimmicks, just quality, freshness, and friendliness that is truly genuine and sincere.
I feel like I made a new friend.
Rocket Burgers & Subs is one out of this world place, and I'm glad it landed in my neighborhood.

China Pantry is located in the food court of the Las Vegas Premium outlets. Right in the middle of a busy shopping spree with my cousins, I found myself ordering a three item combo to share from here. For a little under $8, I got a combo with fried rice, noodles, chicken teriyaki, chicken curry and chicken with mushrooms. 

Pros: 
It was a decent amount of food! They don't really give a lot but it is enough to get you decently full. 

The chicken teriyaki was nice and lean! There was a good amount of chicken in the chicken curry and chicken with mushrooms (meaning it wasn't all veggies).

Taste wise the food was pretty good. The chicken dishes were flavorful! The curry sauce was good. The teriyaki was just the right amount of sweet! 

Cons: 
I didn't order anything to drink but did ask for water. The lady working there gave me a cup of water and when I asked for another (since I was sharing this meal), she said only one water per customer :(.

It's an OK place. A little bit pricey which is to be expected since it is at a food court at a popular outlet.

Decided to try this highly rated spa.
This review is from someone that is new to spas.

The area around this building seems a little ghetto so if you can, please park your car near the building and DO NOT leave any valuables in your car.  I saw glasses in the parking lot which indicates a break-in has occurred or someone got locked in their car.

The cost is $20 for one entry
You can bulk by 10 passes for $120 ($12 / entry)

Greeted by a very friendly lady and she explained the process which there wasn't much of.  Basically, take a shower, go to rooms, take a shower, leave.

They hand you a slipper, change, towel and a key to your locker.
Entrance for men and women are separate.
Once you go in, you need to take off your shoes and wear their slippers only.

Then you go to your locker where you store your clothes and belongings.

REQUEST - When multiple people come in at the same time, can you guys separate their locker locations?  The people around me were awkwardly saying "excuse me" and trying to get by eachother since all our lockers were near by.

The Shower
Yes, people are walking around naked and people get naked as soon as they go in.  Yes, ass naked with their wieners hanging out.  People are all taking shower in the same room and they are chatting in the tub.  It's very strange at first, but you just look away from others and start taking a shower.  They provide a tooth brush, shaving cream and a plastic shaver.  There is a mirror in front of every shower so you can see yourself taking a shower.  There's the usual shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel.  Dry yourself off with the towel before you leave.

Outside the shower, there is everything from dryer, brush, body moisturizer, after shave, etc.

The Sauna
Upstairs (co-ed), there are many rooms.
Exercise Room - A few bike machines and a mirror to stare at yourself.  Would've been nice if they had weights.
Community Room - Many people sitting on massage chair to sleep or watch TV
Ice Room - It's just a giant freezer.  Why?
Iron/Magnesium Room - Just a hot room to lie down in.
Clay Room - Very hot room and you lie down in a coffin like place
Yoga Room - Seems like a room where you're supposed to meditate
?? Room - A room with a bunch of rocks or beads on the ground to lie down on.  
Work Room - Just a room with a bunch of tables and chairs so you can work or eat.
Wifi is provided.
Water is free.  There is a water dispenser
There is a random korean food menu too I guess in case you want to be there the whole day.

All in all, did I enjoy it?
It was a new experience
I sweated a lot.
I can't say I feel extremely relaxed or detoxed like I've read, but I'd probably do it again when I'm feeling like I want to take a break from Vegas.

Largest Night Race in the World.
Shooting for titles is fine, we are runners, it is what we (they) do.
But you have to do it right. This event was so poorly organized that it was borderline dangerous, and overall extremely stressful and frustrating. Looking back on it I don't even understand how they let that cluster-fuck happen (there is really no other word to describe the conditions we had to face pre-, during and post-race).

44,000 people is a lot. And that can be fine if the crowd is handled properly. But try to channel them PLUS their families through three doors at the back of a hotel and you'll see what happen: chaos. Of the most horrible kind. I shudder at what might have happened in the event of a fire alarm of any other kind of emergency.
I was lucky enough to not have to deal with gear check - that looked like apocalypse.

Even the running part of the race was a mess. Corrals were extremely difficult to get to, crowded with non-runners and poorly delimited. I crossed the starting line a good 35 minutes after the first participants, and I ran my first mile at a 15:45 pace. Needless to say - I usually WALK much faster. I was so frustrated that I wanted to punch someone but it got slightly better, and I just kept on running - trying to enjoy the lights and sounds of the Strip. I must have run a total of 15 miles slaloming between people, and I am perfectly aware that it is how it goes in larger races but this was just downright ridiculous.

There is more, though:
1. Water stations were located on both sides of the course. People were converging from every side, tripping over each other.

2. There was no Gatorade whatsoever, contrary to what was announced on the website.

3. I usually carry my water with me, but decided not to do it this time. Must have been my lucky day because I consumed the water provided by the organizers and didn't get sick despite the fact that it WAS PUMPED FROM HYDRANTS INTO GARBAGE CANS. A lot of people got violently ill during the race...

4. ...on the street because porter potties were so scarce. I remember seeing them at two different locations. That's it.

5. Marathoners started 90 minutes before half-marathoners, but there was really no point since the two races converged on the Strip at the busiest point. That slowed down everyone; forget about breaking personal records under such circumstances. Especially with parking cones scattered everywhere to try to separate the two different races.

6. Post-race snacks were out of reach. I was carried away by the flow, and miraculously stopped by the banana stand. All of them were unripe, and impossible to eat. What a waste.

7. Medical assistance was ineffective, and came late in several cases. The MC had to yell out repeatedly for someone to come over and help a man who was having a heart attack. I am not even joking.

8. The pictures  of runners taken along the course are worthless. I cannot even find myself on most of them. And the cheapest one goes for $29.95. Yeah right.

9. It took me exactly 3 hours between the time I crossed the finish line and the moment I was able to sit down for dinner. No offense to Mandalay Bay - but it became synonymous with hell on earth for many of us.

So please, please, please. Read, listen and think. Don't open the race to 60,000 people next year or it will get really ugly.
No need to say - I am done with the RNR series whose only concern is to make money out of runners ($135 registration fee, empty goodie bag and a $40 supplement to pick up your packet on race-day....really?!?) at all costs.

What a shame.

I went to @coachnwillies last night, as part of the @downtownphoenix spring fling pub crawl.
Coach & Willies is the reason negative ratings should be possible on @yelp.

I will never, ever return.

When we arrived, we ordered a beer, and a soda.

We also ordered nachos. They were piled high. This is a good thing.

Removing the first couple chips resulted in a couple olives falling on to the bar. I wiped them into a pile, but figured I'd wait until I was done, to catch anything else, and clean it up.

A few of us decided to have a shot, to celebrate a birthday-in-progress. I flagged one of the bartenders down.

He approaches me and says "Are you gonna stop making a mess on my bar?"
Me: "Excuse me?"
BT: "You're making a mess"
Me: "I would like to order a drink, not get hassled"
BT: "I don't care about your drinks, I only care about your tips"
Me: "Well you're not exactly working for one at the moment"
BT: "Are you going to order or not?"

I placed my order without any further comments, lest I inform him of my true feelings.

He takes my credit card and asks if I'd like to keep it open. I tell him no, because I have left my card in the past.

He returns with the receipt. On the "tip" line I write "NoFuckingWay!"
I work in a service industry. You don't treat me like shit and still get a tip. Fuck you.

A while later I go to order a beer. This same motherfucker tells me I'm cut off.

Yes, I am cut off.

I have had maybe three beers, and a shot, in 5 hours.

I ask another bartender, and as he is about to pour me a beer, the first SOB hollers to him that I am cut off, then proceeds to show him my receipt.

Because, apparently, you not giving a tip is justification for him being a cocksucker.

I demand to see a manager, and one comes over. I tell him that the guy is cutting me off because I refused to tip him, and he tells me that the problem is that there is a $10 minimum on CC transactions.

Curiously, that isn't stated anywhere. Further, this "manager" took my first beer order, when I arrived, and made no mention of the minimum when I bought just the one beer, nor did the other bartender mention that when I paid for the shots, which actually totaled $24.

This "manager" was gracious enough to let me pay their establishment for service again. /sarcasm

I will recommend to every single person I know to never patronize that establishment, and I will never return to a place with such puerile and petty employees.

"That smoothie was so good I almost stole it from Cathy" - a very daring statement from my sister. Take my money, take my boyfriend...I'll get over it. Take my food? You want war!

After a nice morning at the gym, my sister and I finally went here after months of talking about it. I keep hearing positive comments about this place. They have vegan, gluten-free and regular options. But fear not, they have bacon if that's your thing.

Coconut Almond Blended:
I absolutely have a strong dislike of anything coconut. But with my lucky experiences of getting something I hate and ending up liking it (for the past few months) inspired me to get this. Well, I can add this to the list. It tasted like a very mild horchata. Pleasantly and surprisingly delicious! 5/5

Kale Apple Banana Smoothie:
The taste of kale reminds me of a fruit I ate when I was little, Spanish plum. So drinking kale + other fruits isn't foreign to me. This was a little sweetness to it and a nice tart flavor. 5/5

Iced Coffee:
I'm not a big coffee drinker but THIS was good. It takes them 8 hours to make. It wasn't bitter and I didn't feel the need to add anything to it. 5/5

The Hummus:
Comes with warm pita and olives on top. I ate around the olives since I'm allergic to them. Freshly made and delightful. 4/5

The Agrodolce Brussels Sprouts:
Roasted Brussels sprouts with Italian sweet and sour vinaigrette. The sprouts looked a bit overcooked but when you eat them, they still have that crunch. The vinaigrette was a bit tangy and refreshing. 5/5

The Curried Quinoa:
Quinoa, dried cranberries, almonds, parsley with sweet curry. Lots of textures and flavors. Quinoa and almonds are good non-meat protein sources minus LDL's. Cranberries are good for the ladies. 5/5

The Bizness:
Chopped kale with lemon vinaigrette. You can pick and choose 3 side items or roasted chicken / bacon / avocado to put in this salad. So, if you get a combo that sucks then, it's your fault! Accountability 101. But no worries, all the sides they have are good. 5/5

The Banana Boy Bait:
This got me singing "hey you're such a pretty boy. Hey you're such a pretty boy. You're so pretty". Banana bread with natural sweeteners. The top has a little crunch to it. They bring it to you hot. Yuuuuuummm!!! I was supposed to split this 50/50 with my sister but quickly ended up at  60/40 - she caught me before it went to 80/20. "I'm saving you from calories." 5/5

This is located inside The Center which is a LGBTQ facility. They have books and computers with internet. They have their own parking lot which is a big deal because I'm not a fan of paying for parking! I love this place!!!

Peruvian food in Las Vegas?? Whaaaaa... so good! Fresca in the Bay Area is really hard to top, but this place is a great replacement for SF transplants. The set up is a bit funky - this place used to be some sort of 50's style diner and they have kept the decor, but it looks like they are trying to fix up the back area to be more in line with the style they are going for. They use an iPad as their menu, which is a great way to see pics of their food and get a feel for the portion size. Our waitress was extremely helpful and patient, I highly suggest getting the calamari appetizer and their in-house mayo. I had asked her which of the specialty drinks she preferred (I can't think of the names now, but one was passion fruit flavored and the other one was more cinnamon) and she actually offered samples of the drinks. And there weren't tiny cups, she filled up 1/3 of a regular cup and let us taste it. Both had really distinct and strong flavors that paired well with our meal, so definitely order a specialty drink when you're here. I ended up with the lomo saltado as an entree - I wish the meat was a little bit more tender, but still, good flavors and portions. They also do have an aji de gallina which our waitress said they only have as a breakfast special, so I'll try to come back for that. I'll definitely be back to explore the menu a bit more and order those wonderful drinks.

My newest obsession! I almost don't want to write a review because I want to keep this little spot all to myself. Though the tiny obscure sign helps disguise the restaurant quite well hehe. Look for the small "Noodle Pot" oval next to a looming sign in Chinese. 

This restaurant tastes like...home. I always thought my mother didn't cook any specialty dishes (sorry for hating in the past, mom) but now I realize that everything she made for us was traditional Taiwanese style dishes! Which is exactly what this restaurant sells. You MUST go with the spicy beef noodle soup! The soup is hearty and rich in beef flavor. It is also heavier on the tomato side which some beef noodle soup enthusiasts might not be accustomed to, though it's exactly how my grandma makes it. The noodles they use are perfectly chewy, slightly wavy and neither too thin or thick and the beef chunks are tender and savory. It comes with plenty of baby bok choy and pickled mustard and cilantro. 

For the side dishes I would recommend anything marinated! The cucumbers are garlicky, crunchy and refreshing while the cabbage is deliciously sour and spicy. My mouth is starting to water right now. Another must order is the beef wrap which is a thin green onion egg pancake wrapped around marinated beef slices, cilantro, and what seems like oyster sauce.  BUT THAT'S NOT ALL! You definitely need to order the chili oil wontons too. And all their dumplings are made in house. And finally the green bean (sweet mung bean, not the string variety) drink to top it all off! Noodle Pot is Taiwanese comfort food perfection.

P.S. More waitresses please. That is all.

When we got home from Amtrak's Sacramento Valley Station, we grabbed our set of ready to go luggage then hit the road for Vegas. We'd brought along our dog April and her pal Misty for the ride. They both spent an evening at a dear friend's house and the next day we checked them in here at A-Vip Pet Resort. Not being a local I passed up the main road to this place several times thanks to Garmin. After a few drive-bys I found it...

The minute we parked, this place emitted a warm and welcome feeling. When we walked in, we were greeted by a nice gentlemen who was at the front counter. He gave us a run down on what the resort had to offer and what to expect. He got acquainted with our dogs while we filled out the paperwork. 

Soon enough we all headed for the kennels. The kennels come in different sizes and are "roomy" whether you have a large or a small breed dog. There's a roofed and shaded area to protect them from the elements and also a dog run. Each kennel section area was separated by a fence for each others protection. Though they provide dog food (chicken & beef) during the stay free of charge, you have the option of bringing your own dog food. However, they do not allow you to bring your own bowls, which they'll provide. April and Misty happily shared a kennel. We brought a pillow, a blanket and their favorite toys. 

During our visits we'd see how eager dogs wanted to rush in. I gather these were the regulars for doggy day care. I even watched an owner get pulled by her dog on a leash. The dogs were greeted by name as they checked in which was pretty cool! 

For thirty-five dollars a day for accommodations, food and overall care we felt it was a steal! Besides doggy day care & boarding they also offered pet training and pet grooming services (we had their nails trimmed). Did I forget to mention you can check in your cats too? That's right...

Prior to checking in your pets make sure that they are "kennel ready" meaning they're up to date with the latest required vaccination(s). Call the resort and your vet for more details.

We're very happy and glad that we've found this place thanks to Yelpers! Next time in Vegas our dogs will be back. Great customer service and just minutes away from the strip!...

I was recently introduced to Scottsdale BBQ Co by fellow Yelpers who Know Their Food.  As I enjoyed my juicy burger that day, I knew two things to be true: 1) this place would make a great lunch spot for my perpetually hungry co-workers (guys like BBQ, what can I say?), and 2) I could not die happy without trying the tri tip sirloin sandwich.  So, back at the office I warned everyone to break out their "big stretchy pants" and get ready for a field trip to Fantastic BBQ Land.

We piled in on a Friday ready to EAT.  Right off, everyone appreciated the down-home, no-frills feel, complete with a loud screen door, gingham tablecloths and the specials listed out on a chalkboard.  After chatting with the owner (who is super cool, by the way) we all ended up with either tri-tip sirloin or pulled pork sandwiches, all with the most amazing spicy BBQ sauce you will ever taste.

I had the sirloin tri-tip I had been thinking about since my last visit.  So worth waiting for!  Huge - I couldn't finish it (and I really, really tried).  My side, of course, was mac n cheese which I promptly decorated with Tabasco.  Mac n cheese o' fire!  Others had baked beans, potato salad, mac n cheese sans tabasco (silly boys, afraid of the burn...), and caesar salad.  The caesar looked especially good, with nice slivers of parmesan gracing the top.  I stole a few.  Ok, more than a few... 

All in all, everyone walked out happy (and ready for a nap!).  It was a messy, good, 6-napkin per person experience.

NEW PHO SHOP! (1/18/2012)

After first seeing the signs for Pho House getting put up a few weeks ago, I knew I had to try this place immediately. This part of Phoenix needed a little Vietnamese dive. Every time I'm sitting at home and have a pho craving, I always have to think in "miles away." It's not always convenient to have to drive ten plus miles for a decent bowl of pho (and by not always, I mean never).  

Well, I had dinner there tonight and I can already strongly recommend a bowl of their pho dac biet! Consistency will be key, but the broth was definitely one of the better  pho broths that I've had in the city. Along with the pho, I tried a spring roll and an egg roll. The spring roll was tasty and fresh, and the egg roll was crunchy and delicious! I'd order both again. If you've had good spring/egg rolls at other Viet spots, you'll know what you'll be getting. Oh, and one more thing... no chili oil as of yet. I'm sure that could change in the future, but I was a tiny bit bummed.

I think Pho House is totally starting on the right path with its food and friendly service, and if they keep it up, I could see it being a busy little neighborhood restaurant. It's really in a perfect spot that lacks close competition. C'mon, Arcadians and East Phoenicians, go try it and write a review!

"It doesn't matter what my profit margin is, I own the f@#$ing place."
~Old Man Harrison

This place reminds me the Big Mac that seen on TV Commercial looks big and juicy. However, when you actually go get one is totally opposite from the ads.  It located almost out of nowhere location in downtown Las Vegas.  This is a Tourist Hot Spot, the store sure know how's to take advantage of their fame...  Almost half all stuff in the pawnshop is their merchandise; many of them can found on-line.

This pawnshop had the same layout and shape like typical one, but it got army of staff both inside and outside.  It got its own parking lot which is nice, but won't enough in the weekend.  The reason many people wanted to come here, is really wanted a chance to see the real Pawn Star cast, but reality they almost never here at all.  Only any real change you get to meet them is to win a raffle. 

There are some cool stuff in the shop, but that's very small of collection from what it show in TV.  Their main business in the shop is to sell jewelry, after all they name of the store is Gold and Silver ! 

I don't recommend come in the weekend, there will be always a very long line.  Best go there during weekday when the line is usually is much shorter.  One of the nice thing they did in the shop but is really mostly for PR, they had a machine that let you create a free E-Card so you can share to Facebook or just send it to email.  The machine is very slow and the camera will capture many other people in the background that is not from your group.  Camera is allow in the store except in the cashier section. 

I won't come back here unless those cast member are actually there which most likely not unless you won the raffle which I don't I think I did.  Don't just come to Vegas because you only want goes to this shop, there is far more things to do in the Sin City.  This is more like onetime thing for 99% of people.

It was a dark and windy Bike Week 09 type of night. After spending most of the evening at West World, surrounded by hot biker boys... I was hungry. 

I suggested hitting Corbin's for some food and drink. I had never been to Corbin's before and I'm glad we went in for a quick bite. When I opened the door to Corbin's I was hit by a semi-swanky vibe. I was certainly glad I wasn't all "Dirty Harleyed" out. I was more "Harley Hookered" out which, in my mind, is more swanky bar vibe acceptable. 
We were greeted warmly and seated at a table in full view of a family that was VERY interested in our presence (it could have been my super low cut shirt...hmmm...sorry about that...not really.). I even waved! I love my "adoring" fans who found themselves back to being busy with events at their own table. 
Anywho... back to the events at my table! 
After ordering a glass of wine (and being told they were out of my first choice..grr) I finally scored a nice glass of pinot noir. I also went with the grilled cheese sandwich. It wasn't just any ol' grilled cheese, my dear yelpers! This yummy sammie had cheddar, swiss and queso fresco cheese and it was all grilled with thick-cut bacon and a good hunk of tomato. I chose whole wheat for my bread. It was WONDERFUL. The home-cut fries were so good and they have yummy ranch to go along with it! My biker boy chose the Cajun Tasso ham quesadilla. Again... so yummy! The ham was nice and spicy but not HOT, just had some nice seasoning going on. The quesadilla is the size of a small, thin-crust pizza. So it can easily satisfy one person with leftovers to take with them. The whole meal was surprisingly VERY good! 

I only wish that Corbin's chairs were more comfortable to allow for some serious lounge time. I could imagine myself lounging after a great meal and just soaking in the swanky atmosphere. They have a nice bar area and also have hip music playing in the background. 

I look forward to another visit to Corbin's. I promise to not come dressed like a Harley Hooker next time... or not.... we'll see! Continue to surprise me, and I might surprise ya back Corbie!

I've been coming to Vegas all my life but never really got around the convention center....until this year for the SEMA show.

My experience here is not so black and white since there were so many activities tied to this place during my visit. I was fortunate enough to be invited by my friend Pedro, who does all motion graphics and production for the SEMA award ceremony. AND both Pedro and I are car enthusiasts! 

First off, I stayed at the Cosmopolitan and took the monorail (highly recommended) to the convention center...so no problems with parking. I also overheard all surrounding hotels were charging premium for parking because of the apparent onslaught of SEMA folks. 

Now why would anybody want to eat here is beyond my comprehension. The only place that I stopped by is this damned smoothie stand that charged me $6 for a small strawberry smoothie. I was pissed. But it did the job because I was so thirsty walking around the convention center. And I desperately searched for this smoothie stand again the very next day....let me tell you this is a huge place.

I was invited to the award ceremony cocktail and the ceremony itself (both held at the convention center). I felt a bit out of place as all the high rollers from the auto industry were there. Nevertheless Pedro did a fantastic job with his motion graphics displayed all over the reception. I didn't think I was gonna enjoy the ceremony but actually it was one of the best events ever! Christopher Titus, the comedian literally stole the show and they also had a guest singer Michael Grimm (amazing voice by the way). The food they served was probably one of the worst "wedding" type foods I've ever tasted....dried steak, fishy salmon and rehydrated mashed potatoes. BUT it was free and I appreciate it.

The only thing I regret was missing to hang out with Christopher Titus at the Hookah Lounge because we were so hungry from not eating the wedding food...so we went out to eat and clubbing afterwards. Pedro's friend Rick was the only one who ended up hanging out with them SEMA folks after the ceremony....I was so jealous.

Another highlight was my chance to test out the new Chevy Corvette ZR1 "Hot Lap" (meaning I'm the passenger with a professional race car driver). OMG I had so much fun.....this reminded me of the time Pedro and I almost got kicked out during one of Chevy test drive tent events years ago when we almost flipped the vette. 

I was really mad that I missed my opportunity to sit in a mustang during the drag strip event, the next day! 

Pedro and I walked for miles for two days in a row....and I don't think we even covered the entire show. We also heard all the import car models were placed by the tires because no one's interested in looking at the tires apparently, lol. 

On our last day, we saw the parade of all the hot rods from the show. There were some real exciting moments watching these cars pass by. A lot of people were pissed because the cops were threatening all the drivers not to make any tricks during the parade. Pedro took a ton of photos and video shots which looked amazing!

I was mostly by myself because Pedro was working the entire time. While I was walking around...I got a ton of attention and honestly I was a bit scared. When I was desperately searching for the smoothie stand, this perv totally followed me around for like 20 mins. He really thought I was looking for him.

Overall my experience here at the convention center, SEMA & Vegas was phenomenal. It's a diffferent experience everytime I come to Vegas....in other words there was never a dull moment. I will definitely be coming back for next year's show.

If this is a new trend of having tasty steamed buns ("bao" if you read it in Cantonese) following a foot race I'm loving it!  

I had the pleasure of ordering and eating from this food truck (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/great-bao-las-vegas?select=IYXd86zCnkTdXHihCywYNg#RRkCwVYiUUhxC2gY4bScQA) back in December after participating in the Las Vegas Great Santa Run as it and another dozen or so food trucks were all lined up in the race assembly area ready to feed the nearly 10,000 Santas who turned out for the event.

The Great Bao truck was easily one of the more popular trucks with a steady line of people ordering food and another group waiting for their orders.  I waited too, but it was until the crowds diminished before I put in my order.  The menu was pretty simple (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/great-bao-las-vegas?select=IYXd86zCnkTdXHihCywYNg#nLQH80BQIF9oW2S7iGVl1g).  They basically had four types of steamed buns, bagged chips and refreshments.  The buns were pretty inexpensive at $3.50 each or 3 for $10.  The 3 bao combo also included a drink and a bag of chips!

I'm not sure what I was thinking when I placed an order for 2 buns instead of 3.  I didn't realize my mental breakdown until I had paid for my order.  Maybe it was the temporary meltdown of having run hard for a short distance race or maybe I was just wacky from seeing all that red from the people in Santa suits at every direction I turned.  Anyway, I ordered 1 Roast Duck bao and 1 Pork Belly bao and nothing else since I had collected an armful of race refreshments from other event sponsors.

By this time the staff had their routine down to perfection, and my made to order steamed buns (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/great-bao-las-vegas?select=IYXd86zCnkTdXHihCywYNg#Sd1ztJyGREFdt-vAbJi7ng) were ready lickety-split.

The Roast Duck bao was delicious.  The plum sauce was just sweet enough as to not overpower the taste of the roast duck, and I loved that they included a piece of green onion which reminded me of the Peking Duck and steamed clamshell buns we enjoy at Chinese banquets.  The piece of duck I had, however, was a bit dry and slightly burned as you can probably notice in the photo that I've posted.

I lucked out on the Pork Belly bao as they gave me a huge piece of pork belly with very little fat on it.  Even though there was a sauce, a smidgeon of what looked like minced pickled veggies and a sprig or two of fresh cilantro all I could really taste was the delicious pork belly and the subtle sweetness of the steamed bun.

This was my first experience with any Las Vegas food truck and I liked it ... a lot!

Spoon is easily one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. For fine dining, I put them in the top five.
Been here four or five times now just to make sure I was not dreaming. But for sure this is a solid four stars and edging on five. A few subtle enhancements could tip the scale to 5.
Dcor is nice and trendy with several seating areas including a great bar.  Service includes John the top sommelier in the area, usually two hostesses, well-mannered servers and great bartenders. Service is prompt and a drink order results in libations within 5 minutes along with a choice of waters. There is a very ample selection of cocktails and wines by the bottle or glass.
I should mention there is a prompt and courteous valet service as another notch up the service pyramid.
Next the wonderful bread basket with warm selections of biscuits, awesome cornbread and ciabatta or some other artesian bread with sugar or honey butter to complement. We usually need a second basket as a testament.
The short menu is a design to keep choices interesting but not drone on, the ingredients fresh, the food delicious and it changes often enough to keep regulars coming back.
Seafood is my favorite here in appetizer and entre, but the soups and salads are fresh and outstanding as well. A very well enjoyed appetizer choice from the other night we had the 'bacon and eggs' appetizer which was seared pork belly, 5 minute egg (just right) sauted spinach, and hollandaise. Also we had the crispy duck confit which was a fabulous set of ingredients of crispy duck, 3 grain salad, Indian spices, goat cheese, cucumber yogurt, and toasted almonds. Almost sounds like decadence and just about was.
Around the tale we had the shellfish pappardelle; Alaskan black cod; cassoulet which interestingly was comprised of roasted pork, chicken sausage, duck confit, braised cannellini + cranberry beans, herbed bread crumbs, and farm egg. This was 'dryer' version of cassoulet a French peasants, style stew.
We have tried many other appetizers and entrees on our other visits and they all were as wonderful as these I mention here. All had the same complexity of ingredients, preparations, with flavors all overwhelmingly pleasing to the senses.

Las Vegas, NV 89109

RE: Bacchanal--11/10/12


Dear Gary--

My son turned 21 on November 9th so we traveled to Vegas and had a very nice experience for the weekend.  On Friday night, we were quite entertained at Pure.  That place is phenomenal--great music, great venue and tremendous energy.  For his birthday, Pure was the real deal.

On Saturday morning, we researched and found that the Bacchanal was the best rated buffet in Vegas so we decided to try and recover from the night before with a good meal.  Your buffet was exceptional in every way.  We particularly liked the Bacchanal Benedict--a very nice twist.  Our server Lilly was also tremendous.  Our group never wanted for service, the mimosas were filled very quickly and the experience overall was a home run.  We liked it so much, we considered returning for dinner and inquired about the Buffet of Buffet's.  Lilly explained the program to us and we were ready to sign up.  On the way out, we grabbed great cookies with the fudge layer.

At the desk on the way out, we presented our ticket to do the upgrade to BOB.  The hostess said it didn't work that way.  We said, all we want to do is give you money and buy dinner for tonight.  She got the supervisor over who sadly was a troll.  We explained that we liked the buffet and wanted to return.  The supervisor told us that this was not possible and we could not buy the BOB in no uncertain terms.  So much so, that we were quite offended.  Clearly, we weren't looking for a deal, we were looking for resolution--that was not possible and we left.

I stopped at what looked like a management area and talked to a lady who took my number and said somebody from management would call me.  She said I would be better going to the registration area and speaking to a manager.  So I ambled over there-yes, I was pretty frustrated.  So I talked to Joel who was helping direct people to check in.  He told me that only the ICU manager was working and that Marcus the Food/Beverage General Manager who recently was some other manager would be the person to speak with.  I left my number for Marcus and asked for a call.

So in essence, I requested a call from two different people about the treatment at the Baccanal with my guests and son.  You have a good thing going at your establishment at Caesors.  We travel to Vegas 1-2 times a year and enjoy the get away from our home in Tucson.  You are only as good as your weakest link.  I'm not sure what's more disappointing, the supervisor at the Bacchanal or the fact that no member of management followed up on my concerns.  Remember one thing; I tried to give you more of my money--not sure I'll try next time.

Sincerely,
-------------------

WOW, I think I am in meat heaven!

So we accidentally found this place when we were having lunch in the same little strip mall and let me tell you, we lucked out today!  My husband and I are carnivores through and through.  I think we could give a T. Rex a run for his money if someone was dangling a ribeye in front of us!

When we walked in, it was almost over whelming with all of the beautiful cuts of steak, pork, seafood, deli meats, homemade sausage in numerous flavors, and even specialities items like East Coast Scrapple.  I know I started to drool right away and I noticed my husband's eyes glazed over with pure happiness at the sight of the amazing steaks on display.  We walked in to check it out and left with $50 worth for steak and other treats for the next couple of nights.  SCORE!

So this is actually a branch of The Butcher Block on the south end of town.  We used to live out there and would frequent it often for when we wanted something special for dinner or a party.  We missed it living up on the North end and thought we would just have to eat boring supermarket steaks from here on out.  Well our prayers have been answered!  We were speaking with the owner, who was working the counter, and he told us that it was the same place and he would treat us good from here on out.  WooHoo!

Yes, the prices are higher here for the items for sale, but the prices are worth it once you try these steaks.  They have so much more flavor, more tender, and just much better than what you can find at the big name stores.  The product here is just fresher and it can't be beat.  And in reality, the prices weren't outrageous.  We got boneless ribeye steaks for $13.99 per lb, their super special BBQ hamburger mix for $4.99 per lb, and Boar's Head smoked turkey breast for $8.99 per lb.  No scrapple for us this time, we weren't brave enough this time.

If you want a great steak without having to get gussied up to go to a steakhouse, go check out The Butcher Block for their yummy delights!

Any Asian owned business that has the word "Spa" in its name will raise suspicions of being a "rub and tug."  Being a member of law enforcement,  I have to be extra vigilant about the businesses I patronize.  Imperial Health Spa was recommended to me by several female friends and after some research on Yelp, I felt it was an legitimate spa and made an appointment.

The spa layout is pretty simple unless you're gender-confused.  It is located in a two story building and divided into three areas; the top floor is the co-ed area and the bottom is segregated by gender. 

Before I go any further, I must warn you...  DO NOT go if you are not comfortable with same-sex full frontal nudity.  There will be naked people there and they will walk as if they are strolling in the park.  If you have a hang up about being naked, don't go, because if I catch you checking out my junk, I'm gonna kick your butt--and two naked dudes fighting in a spa is the last thing ANYONE wants to see.

When you arrive, you will be checked in by the receptionist, it costs $15 for locals and $20 for non-locals to use the facilities (Mani, Pedi, Facial, Massages, Exfols services are also available at extra cost).  You will be given a set of shorts,  hospital scrubs, 2 towels and a key.  The key is for your locker, the rest, hopefully, are self explanatory.

When you walk into the changing area, there will be mini-lockers, those mini-lockers are for your shoes.  You are now faced with a couple of decisions, put your shoes in the mini shoe locker or your key locker; and use the slippers in the mini shoe locker or go bare foot.  You're an adult, figure it out.

There will be lockers and the number on your key will correspond to the locker.  Get out of your street clothes,  wrap a towel around yourself, hit the showers.  In the segregated area, there will be:

Stand-up Showers
Sit-down Asian Showers
Hot Tub
Cool Tub
Salt Steam Room
Herbal Steam Room
Dry Sauna
Salt Hot Sauna

PLEASE SHOWER AFTER YOU VISIT EACH AREA... shower/hot tub/shower/steam room/shower/cave/shower/sauna... and any combination thereof, just shower after each "area."

The upstairs is the co-ed area, it consists of a general lounge area with big comfy lazy-boy chairs where you can watch TV and a mini-restaurant that serves basic Korean/Asian food as well as some boba/smoothie drinks.  Upstairs specialty rooms are as follows:

Salt Brick Room - A hot room with salt bricks
Red Clay Ball Sauna - Think kitty litter, for humans, without the poo.
Jade Sauna - Not sure what this room was for and didn't bother to read the sign, just remember it being hot
Red Clay Room- It's a red clay igloo... also hot.
Cold Room - Basically a walk in freezer
Mini Gym - I don't exercise, so I avoided this room.  I think there were treadmills and stationary bikes.

I got the combo package of "Pure Heaven" which consisted of a Body Scrub, Swedish Massage and Fresh Grated Cucumber Mask (70 minutes, $130).  The scrub was great, left my skin baby soft.  The cucumber mask made me hungry.  The massage was okay.  

I took one star away for the fact that I didn't have a choice of getting a female therapist... becuase I got the body scrub, the entire package had to be done by a middle-age Korean man.  I was told that if I wanted a female therapist, I should have separated out the massage and body rub; wherein the exfoliation would be done by a man and the massage portion, a woman.  Fine, next time I know.

I did enjoy the Tofu soup at the restaurant ($9.00)... which was prepared by a woman.

All in all, it's a pretty good experience, relaxing after having to deal with my crazy mother.

I like INSERT COIN(S), I really do. But any of you who have been there lately knows it's gotten REALLY scene-y. The people there aren't gamers, they're hipsters who just want to party downtown so they can tell everyone loudly and obscenely that they party downtown and would never be caught dead on the strip.

Uh, excuse me... you're blocking our game. You forgot this is a barcade, huh?

So when I heard about Hi-Scores, I was stoked... another chance to have a true gamer's space! And it's practically right down the street from me. So off I went to check out the new kid in town.

In gamer's terms, Hi-Scores is like "Super Ghouls 'n' Ghosts" -- an unnecessary sequel that doesn't make it out of Stage 1 before people give up on it.

First, Hi-Scores is actually two "businesses" -- Hi-Scores and The Player's Club. More about that later, but it's pretty much the same place.

Secondly, a good barcade should give you the feeling that you're partying in an arcade. I felt like I was in a warehouse a good portion of the time. There was very little theming, and the only reference to games on the menu was the Pac Man's Burger (meh) and a drink called the Centipede. But the specialty drink selection was pretty weak.

The bar in general is weak. Maybe I'm spoiled on skilled Vegas bartenders, but I ordered a Long Beach Iced Tea. For those who don't know, it's exactly like a Long Island Iced Tea, except you use cranberry juice instead of Coke. Now, I don't expect everyone to know that, but at a bar, it's pretty common knowledge. Instead, I get this from the server (who for what it's worth was really nice):

ME: Can I get a Long Beach Iced Tea?
SHE: You mean a Long Island.
ME: No, a Long Beach Iced Tea.
SHE: ...........
ME: A Long Beach?
SHE: What's that?
ME: It's a Long Island Iced Tea, except it's made with cranberry juice, not Coke.
SHE: ............ I'll see what we can do.

"See what we can do?" It's not that hard. Minus Coke. Plus cranberry juice. Voila!

I was excited to find out they had a kitchen, which IC doesn't have. Their kitchen staff, however, is obsessed with food on sticks. Our appetizer was Chinese meatballs (on sticks). For our entree, the Bestie got sliders (with big toothpicks through them) and I got Cajun beef (on skewers). The sliders were okay but super small, even for sliders. My Cajun beef was larger, but not that much better. Here's the thing: most of what they served, I could have done with a Crock-Pot and a trip to Trader Joe's. Yawn.

Here's the kicker: their game area is about the size of my living room. Four console stations, not playing anything wildly popular, two Golden Tee machines, a few pinball games and a couple of cabinets. The biggest hit in the room was a 4-player Pac-Man machine, which was busy all night.

Now, excuse me one dang minute, but HOW IN THE MAPPYLAND HELL are you going to try to pass yourself off as a bar-arcade and have a sorry-ass game area?

Sorry, gamers, but your Princess is in another Barcade.

Barros is the new kid on the block. 

Clearly there's no shortage of pizza places in our area, including one just 100 feet across the parking lot. LOL  But we came away last night wondering how the old Redendo/NY 51 would fair in this location.

The setup for Barros is a large expansive warehouse type space, where you order at a cashier as you come in. Just next to the cashier is a small iceberg lettuce salad bar, where you can make your own. 

After paying, they hand you a drink cup, salad bowls, and number for your table. Off to side there's a 50" flat screen and several booths along the wall with maybe a dozen or so tables for seating. 

We ordered two salads for $3.49 each, along with two drinks ($1.50) and a large 14" pizza (half cheese and half sausage/pepperoni) for a great price of $11.01. Hands down, probably the best price for a pie west of the parking lot and Rustic.

We had high hopes for Barros Pizza, but.... our pie came covered in oil, see photo. It took nearly three napkins to get it all. At home, I'll drizzle a little on top for flavor, but here they went all out. 

As I mentioned earlier, there's a lot of choices for your pizza dollars nearby. Spinato's further down FLW; Corleone's, Ray's, NYPD or Fired Pie on Northsight, even Rustic across the parking; all make better, yet very different pies.

Btw, what's with all the servers coming over one by one and asking "how was our meal?" It's a nice touch, but somewhat over the top and disingenuous after the seventh one. I believe the only one who missed us was the guy making the pies. LOL

There's a great deal of potential here. Our bill came in at $21.49 before taxes. We came away feeling that Barros was a decent sit down place for an inexpensive meal, but left wanting more. 

So two and a half Stars, rounded up to three.

***Ghirardelli offers very expensive sundaes that are similar to the type of sundae you would get at a chain family restaurant though the hot fudge is good***

This Ghirardelli shop is located near Harrah's on The Strip.  This shop features both Ghirardelli chocolate (mostly their signature squares but other options as well) and an old-fashioned ice cream and fountain shop.  They make shakes here as well as many different kinds of sundaes.

I went with their signature hot fudge sundae, which consisted of two scoops of vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream, chopped almonds, and a maraschino cherry.

I remember liking their sundae (at the least the one I had in San Diego a long time ago).  I have probably had much better ice cream desserts since then; it did not really stand up as well today.  The big problem with the sundae was that while the hot fudge was good and chocolatey, everything else was standard stuff.  The ice cream was a kind of light and whipped ice cream (kind of like Thrifty ice cream), which is not my favorite style of ice cream.

The sundae also had the problem of melting too quickly.  It became more of an ice cream soup because the ice cream was not cold and firm enough.

Service was good and quick.  The sundae maker brought the sundae to the table (he even brought out extra spoons for everyone to share).

Pricing seemed high.  The sundae was almost $9 though I imagine that most sundaes in Las Vegas would cost that much.

The hot fudge sundae at Ghirardelli was a lot like something you would find at a family chain restaurant.  Going in with the right expectations, the sundae is satisfying enough.  Still, for the price of the sundae here, you could probably find a much better sundae elsewhere (maybe at one of the Haagen Dazs locations in Las Vegas).

For parking, you can park at one of the several nearby casinos like Harrah's.

My girls are the shit. They dragged me out and promised a night that I won't forget - but I almost forgot because of the bottle service!

Upon arrival for the midnight showing, our host walked us right in and dropped us off at the bar so we could get drinks while they got our table ready. I ordered the Washington Apple which consisted of: Pendleton 12 year Canadian Whiskey, Cranberry Compote, Lemon, and Apple Bitters. Delicious!

About 15 minutes passed and we were escorted to our table located in front to the left of the stage, but we ended up being front and center after they moved us :) Our server was friendly, fun and kept checking up on us throughout the night. Open the top of the ottomans to stash your purses, wallets, and phones here. The bouncers are geat at keeping an eye on your things and we always had people sitting at the table to make sure.

Now for the show.. I'm positive there are going to be those who haven't seen it reading the reviews so I won't go into detail, but these are a few acts to keep an eye out for: Prescott (super hot and an amazing beat boxing woman), Pandora (HOLY MOLY! Keep an eye out for her!), The Girl Who Plays with Fire, table tapping, and some lap dancing fun ;) There are maaaany more acts that will keep you enveloped with the highly inappropriate (love it!) show the whole time since there's always something going on!

The last act of the show helps transition Rose. Rabbit. Lie. into a "night club." The majority of the audience got out of their seats and went to the dance floor to have some fun. A few of the performers even came out to mingle with the crowd and danced with us (love you Frog Man). The stage keeps rotating to reveal the DJ, some fun with bubbles, and more performers doing various things. After half an hour, they did clear out the middle of the dance floor for a fun little cirque du doleil act. Then it was dancing time again! Since our table was right there in front, we got to both people watch while hanging out and step out onto the dance floor when we wanted to. I forgot how good it felt to just.. DANCE!

Remember that a little party never killed nobody ;)

Two of us discovered this Ethiopian restaurant on Yelp and decided to come here for lunch. We were the first to arrive and the black-white colored interior consisted of a small bar, and plenty of tables that spread across several platforms that overlooked a screen looping various images of Ethiopia. 

We had the Meat and Vegetarian Combo ($13.99) that came with seven vegetarian items and our choice of lamb. There were two types of lentils and split peas, string beans, collard greens, spiced cabbage, and mushrooms. The ingredients were fresh and arrived with good consistency. However, the flavors were rather subdued as many items could use more spice and pop in the flavor.  One of their lentils was served at room temperature, and although such practice is common, I still prefer the warm version.

The Alitcha Wot was a bit dry and very greasy. The lamb was unexpectedly swimming in a pool of oil and not aesthetically pleasing. This is not a dish I would order again.

Their injera was fluffy and soft. As other reviewers had mentioned, it is on the sour side, but I really enjoyed it. However, there was a general lack of depth and intensity in the flavor when compared to others that might be more authentic.

Portions were huge and menu prices were excellent. Service was warm, friendly, and attentive. However, the worst part of this experience was when they overcharged the meal by having us to pay these two dishes separately--instead of the combo price that was listed on the menu. 

Several reviewers have mentioned about Blue Nile, so that's the next place I'm going to visit. Otherwise, I recommend people to try Lalibela for those that are searching for the cuisine in the area. My favorite of all times is still by far Awash, hands down.

Imagine two college roommates, one an all-american kid raised on classic fast food fare, the other a Korean foreign exchange student with an overprotective mom preparing meals weekly from home, and then picture some pothead next door raiding their refrigerator one night and throwing their leftovers together in one massive pile for a meal of his own.  That may have been my first impression upon glancing at the menu, but after finishing my first meal here I am convinced this is the work of some evil mad culinary genius.       

Went and checked out this place over lunch with a friend and decided to sample their two most popular items: the #1 (Beef Buldogi hotdog)  and the Angry Kimchi Fries

The beef bulgogi dog is a 100% premium beef dog covered with an avalanche of Asian cole slaw, grilled onions, generous strips of beef bulgogi (marinated beef with Korean seasonings, finished off with a dusting of sesame seeds and a light drizzle of house mayo.   The first bite of any hot dog usually begins with a naked end devoid of bread or toppings, and one can tell that the Buldogi dog has been grilled to that perfect smokey char with a nice firm "snap" of the casing that explodes with mouthwatering flavor.  The contrast in textures and flavors from the tender bulgogi, crispy slaw, smokey onions, creamy mayo, and toasted sesame seeds surprisingly round out one another in harmonious balance.

The angry kimchi fries was a whole other beast.  Wheras the oxtail chili cheese fries at Bachi Burger look better than they taste, the Angry fries here taste better than they look.  Start with a bed of sweet potato fries, add a layer of pork bulgogi, throw in some cooked kimchi and melted cheese with diced green onion and jalapeno, and then finishing the whole concoction with a sunny side egg, I found myself unable to stop with each progressive bite since something so wrong apparently seemed so right!  There's a stroke of brilliance with the choice of sweet potato for the starch since the natural sugar cuts through all the spicy and savory components and the richness from the cheese and runny egg yolk cleverly binds all the distinct bold flavors together  (pro-tip: break the yolk immediately upon being served otherwise the heat from the other ingredients will continue to cook the egg)

If I had one minor critique, it would be the lack of beer and the ambience inside is a bit drab since I think the food has heavy flavors that go well with beer in the company of friends with a sporting event in the background since I would totally attend any stadium or ballpark which served these items.    It looks like they may have attempted to expand previously but the other location appears closed on yelp, but hopefully their following will grow to be successful on a repeat attempt in the future.

I've been hesitant to review Lolo's. I know everyone creams their pants upon its mere mention, but I really don't. I don't like fried chicken at all, and I'm generally too hungover in the morning to eat anything besides a gallon of gatorade, so I was afraid my review might only be relevant to a specific audience. Namely: Me.

But I wanted to review the Scottsdale location since I just went last weekend and have also been to the Phoenix location, so I figured the differences between the two might be worth pointing out. They both have good food, endearing servers, and awesome atmosphere. The differences are subtle, but noticeable. For instance, at the Phoenix location you get an ice cream scoop of warm, melty butter on your waffle. At the Scottsdale location you get a spoonful of cool, hard butter. I realize that waiting 5 minutes would solve this problem, but who has time to wait while there is a delicious breakfast pastry sitting right in front of your face?

Basically, everything was just a little different. Though this may have been in part because Coda B. and I split a 3 piece and he stuck me with the thigh.  Bastard.  He liked the grits better here but again, I liked them better at the other location.  Main reason: Not enough butter. I am in a race against time and if you think I'm going to die as a 95 year old healthy person you have another think coming. All of my decisions shave years off of my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

They did have an awesome little gospel band there because it was Sunday. So I left feeling that much closer to God. And not just because I felt like i might have a cholesterol induced heart attack at any moment. 

I would say if you're not generally a fried chicken fan, I don't think Lolo's will blow your mind. If you want an awesome breakfast experience go to the Lolo's in Phoenix. If they're too busy, come to this one.

Came here for dinner the other night and I was glad to finally check this place out. Inside isn't huge, but it was clean and there was a girl constantly cleaning tables and the floor under them. The woman at the counter who took our order was nice and gave us a number to put on the table. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come out, but the place was busy and they claimed to be making everything fresh so I didn't mind.

I ordered a side "Classic Greek Salad" priced at $4.95 with house made Greek vinaigrette. The salad had crisp greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, kalamata olives (has pits...be careful!) and feta cheese. The salad tasted fresh and the dressing was delicious. The salad also came with some grilled pita bread that I put some cucumber and tomato on and folded it up to grub on. Yum! Hubby got a burger (said the patty seemed frozen) and made it a combo with "Feta Fries" for us to share. The fries were excellent! Especially dipped in some of their tzaziki. I will be back to try a gyro and baklava. 

They also have tables outside if eating inside isn't your thing or you can call ahead and place your order to-go. Ask about their family meal deals, they have a couple to choose from.

This is short and sweet about the service at City Bar in Aria. I'll have preface this by saying that Aria is one of my absolute favorite casinos in Las Vegas because it's modern, doesn't smell like cigarette smoke, and has great options for gambling, eating, and drinking. I truly do love this place.

Our group wanted to drink here at City Bar. However, we decided at the last minute or rather within a minute of sitting down to go somewhere else. Mind you the waitress didn't even approach us yet. As our group is getting up, the waitress is walking over and we tell her that we decided to go somewhere else. Her response, "Oh good!" And she walked back to where her co-worker was standing to continue her chit-chatting.

We were caught off guard by this because normally the waitress will be more polite. To say it out loud for potential customers to hear is uncalled for. It's not like we ordered a bunch of drinks and changed our mind. We literally walked in, sat down, and then got up. For her to respond in such a rude manner was uncalled for.

After we left the bar, others in my group had heard what she said so we agreed to just go somewhere else for drinks and gambling. Some wanted to gamble and drink at Aria, but after that, we were just fine leaving. I, for one, do not appreciate service like that and I'm glad we didn't stay there for drinks considering the  surprisingly rude response we received. I don't mind giving this place another try, but there are other places I'd rather go to first.

It was a dark and gloomy Sunday night in downtown Phoenix. It was 6:30 Pm. On any other day in this city the streets would be lit up with restaurants eagerly proclaiming "we're open! we're open! come on in! give us your money!" 

But not on Sundays. On Sundays everyone closes their doors and goes home. As invisible as magic, unicorns, and Mariah Carey's acting talent. 

It was Nathan's birthday, and Amanda B and I took it upon ourselves to devise a place suitable for a birthday dinner. You might as well have asked us to perform brain surgery with a screwdriver and a plunger.

"Two Hippies?"
"Closed."
"That BBQ place you like?"
"Closed."
"Um...there's a Pizza Hut---"
"Uh, no."
"Sorry."

Yeah. Guess which one I was in that exchange.

Finally we came upon Mamma Mia's, and collectively griped at how we had forgotten our "freebie" chips from the Birthday pARTy. Thankfully, they were open, though you wouldn't have known it by the way the girl ushered us through the kitchen to the dining room.

There are two types of people who order pizza. There are those who, when asked their preference, list all the toppings they like. And there are those who respond by listing all the things they don't like on pizza. With the latter option, everyone gathers around the menu and lists off what available toppings they wouldn't eat. Through the process of elimination, you pick from the available toppings and come with a democratically agreed upon pie.

And that's how we decided on basil and fresh tomato slices. With a side order of meatballs.

"How many meatballs come in a side?" asked Nathan.
"Five."
"That's perfect."

At first I was skeptical. How is five perfect for a party of three people? Who taught you to do math, birthday boy? Big Brother?

Thankfully I kept those thoughts to myself...I know, even I was impressed with myself.

And I'm glad I did, because the meatballs were big, saucy and  spoonable, since our party of three only managed to get two sets of plastic silverware. I guess it's not just Nathan who's math is a little fubar'd.

The pizza was rather superb. So superb that, even armed with only basil and tomatoes, it was enough to satiate a palette accustomed to deep dish pepperoni sausage with buffalo sauce and buffet breadsticks.

This was like re-education for my taste buds, but without the hard labor and Chinese man screaming in my face about how awesome communism is.

The question about whether my hair was real or not aside, the staff were  accommodating and friendly. 

If I ever find myself lost in the dark and lonely place that is downtown Phoenix on a Sunday after 6pm, I will definitely keep Mamma Mia's in mind. And I will remember my "freebie" chips. 

Dear Phoenix,

This isn't Salt Lake City. Cut this Sunday nonsense out.

Love,
Me

I did an all Venetian restaurant tour on my most recent Vegas trip.  I had dinner here the second night of my stay.

We ordered the gnocchi w/ black truffles to start ($25).  For my entree I had a bone-in ribeye w/ foie gras ($72 - $52 for the steak & $20 for the foie gras), my friend had the regular ribeye ($48), and on the side we had haricot vert almondine ($11) & fingerling potatoes ($12).  

The gnocchi was very good.  It had a nice crisp and the truffles accented the taste of the potatoes in the gnocchi very well:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the steak was not very good.  It was fatty, chewy in some spots and not that flavorful.  The waiter stated that Delmonico's has the best steaks in town.  Sorry, but I have had better steaks at STK and T-Bonz in Summerlin:  2 Stars.  The foie gras was OK.  It was nice to see it on the menu because you can't find it in CA.  However, I was expecting more crisp:  3 Stars.  The haricot vert was just OK too.  The beans were crispy and there were plenty of almonds, but other than that they were nothing to remember:  3 Stars.  Lastly, the fingerling potatoes were too salty, and I am one who generally doesn't notice when dishes are too salty.  The waiter Ken did offer to make a new batch, but the food took a long time to come out and we declined:  2 Stars.

To accompany the meal we had a bottle of COS Pithos Rosso 2008 from Sicily ($85). The winery describes the wine as superbly elegant, subtly meaty w/ a cherry fruit nose.  The palate is profound:  Elegant, pure and mineral with lovely spice and earth notes.  Some complexity, and a bit of tannic structure.  OK, perhaps too much self-promotion, but Delmonico has an extensive wine list at many price points.  The wine was excellent and went very well w/ all the dishes:  5 Stars.

The ambiance was sterile, but there was a good amount of space between the tables.  Unfortunately, the restrooms were lame.  It was quite a walk, there was no valet and only one stall and one urinal.  I had to wait and after I finished, the line was two deep:  2 Stars.  In addition, the service was not very good.  The entrees came at least 35 min after the first course.  Ken, our waiter never stopped by to check on us and let us know it would take a while.  He did redeem himself by agreeing to take the potatoes off the check.  However, he offered us a complimentary dessert and we chose expressos and my friend asked for sambuca also.  We were charged for the sambuca : XXX. If he didn't take the potatoes off the check, I would have given him 1 Star:  2 Stars.

I will not return to Delmonico's the next time I am in Vegas, even though I can walk here from the Venetian where I always stay.  The steak was lousy, the bathroom is lame and the service sucked for an establishment of this caliber.  Word to Emeril:  You need to work on this restaurant - BAM!!!

I'm a long-time lover of Peruvian cuisine and anything that even hints at having plantains, yucca, rotisserie/grilled chicken, and South American pastries....or anything with "Dulce de Leche" in the name. I'm a sucker, I know, but Viva exudes all of the aspects of a staple in town for a quick-service resto. It was pretty astonishing to learn that this joint is totally Charlotte-based. 

There are so many things that gave this experience 5 out of 5 for me. 

Service: Holy cow. The woman at the register was super helpful. She gave me some background on everything I had questions about. I'm a firm believer that the more questions you ask, the more likely you are to find out what you'll end up loving. The gentleman working the line was equally helpful. He gave us some background on the housemade drinks, Inca Kola (tastes exactly like bubblegum, by the way), other processes, Peruvian cuisine, and the back story. They give you a number if you dine in and bring your order to your table. They were even so kind to spell everything out, give some info on flavors of the different Aji (sauces), and came back to ask how everything was. Top notch service indeed. 

The flavors. Oh, my. First, The Great. This is the staple chicken sandwich under this roof and it's a force of culinary nature. It all starts in the "Green Oven" they have straight from Peru. It's a rotisserie/grill hybrid that gives the chicken immaculate flavor. Imagine pulled, tender, juicy chicken with charred flavor and absolutely no compromise in texture/chew. I was astounded. It is served on ciabatta with red onion, tomatoes, and a spread of some sauce. Add avocado and provalone. You won't be sorry you did. 

The yucca and plantains were top notch. Dunked heavily in the Aji Amarillo and the green Aji sauce. I'd eat these with every meal. 

We also ordered the avocado stuffed with quinoa. Sounds odd, looks odd, tastes AMAZING. Balsamic is a nice touch. Don't be scared. Just try it if it's your style. 

The alfajores, shortbread cookies with dulce de leche, are incredible. Coated in powdered sugar and only beckon a tall glass of milk. Buy them in two or four packs. They make these suckers in-house, too. 

Inca Kola. Loved it, so interesting, can't wait to have it again. Ever wondered what a liquid version of Bazooka bubblegum would taste like? Here ya go. 

Prices vary on dishes. Some of the entrees are a little more pricey (as expected) and the sandwiches, sides, and apps are a bit more modest in price. Definitely a little more pricey than some, but you can get out the door with a meal under your belt for between $10-$15 no problem.

The whole experience was awesome. I loved all of the background on the concept, preparation, kitchen, etc. Such a nice dinner and I'm already planning a menu for my next visit. That chicken is just too damn good to not be in my life. Viva...Viva Chicken indeed!

$20/hr foot massage.  Need I say more?

Anyone who knows me knows I love a good foot rub!  And finally, Las Vegas has seen the light and is offering $20/hr foot massages!  Yes, you heard that right - $20/hr foot massages!  (What's even sweeter, you can buy 5 gift cards and get 1 free here!! Score!)

Bali Foot Spa is yet another place that has popped up in Vegas and smack dab in the oh so popular area of Spring Mountain.  This place is lit up like a Christmas tree at night, so it's really hard to miss if you're driving down Spring Mountain and it's dark.

Walking in on a weekday evening, I asked immediately if they had two females available and they did! Yes!  (Usually I call other places first and they say they do, but it involves them calling around first to make sure.)  Not here, these ladies are ready and waiting to work which is always a plus!  And it looks like they had at least two people whose dedicated job was to answer the phones and work the cash register.  (This is important to me because I hate when they answer the phone when they are working on me.)

Walking into the massage area, their space is enormous!! It's almost like a showroom!  Areas are partitioned off with 2-3 chairs in each space and they had a good amount of clients in there when we walked in.  I think they would have no problem accommodating a large group last minute.

Overall, my girl was good.  I was pleased with what she did and she didn't smell like cigarette smoke (a common thing when you get a guy working on you).  The Husband said his girl was okay, although he fell asleep relatively early and was snoring away, so I'm not sure how he can really judge it.  I think it's a good sign when they put him to sleep so quickly.

Sidenote: It's hard for me to be loyal to one specific foot  massage place because ultimately, it's the person working on you, right?   Very rarely have I gotten the same person twice at any foot massage place and they were that stellar that I would only request for them.  (I'm always curious to see what other people can do.)  I will definitely be going back there again though because we bought the gift cards!

Located inside of the diviest of dive bars, but that's not the issue to us - we enjoy a good dingy dive bar.

We came here for 2 reasons:
1. I had an emergency late night pizza craving. 
2. This was the only place open past 12am that had decent reviews (namely because Guy Fieri recommended them on Triple D.)

I'm just going to put this boldly out there - the pizza was a lie. 

I can't necessarily state that Guy is lie on this one, because I bet this place used to be good, then triple D aires, then the word gets out, then the hype man takes the stage, then they cut massive ingredients and quality to make a profit. Right. It's a sad tune we're all too familiar with. 

The pizza itself was very dry and I can honestly state it was pretty much all thick, dense dough. The dough wasn't even special or memorable - not even slightly sweet or anything that would make it stand out. The tomato sauce was barely noticeable and it wasn't robust, or striking in flavor. The cheese was also extremely limited as well. Everything fell seriously flat on our taste buds.

The toppings were all few and very far between. The meats were sparse and standard, nothing to holler home about. There were tiny specs here and there with spinach. Seriously!? How expensive is spinach, that you can't even hook an honest paying customer up with it? It was truly nonexistent.

Let me ask you this, why did we get the pizza with no love? I think my theory is concrete and valid. 

Here's what we regretted ordering:
Fatboy "not so wee" Pizza: $21
- subbed sausage for spinach 
- subbed salami for ricotta 
- this pizza advertised basil yet they some how forgot the basil? (forgot? or, on purpose... my paranoia is beginning to wonder...)

Pit BBQ Wings: $8 (single = 10pcs?)
- hahahahaha they either, a.) Skimped us, or, b.) Don't know how to count - either way, that's totally annoying and frustrating when you pay for 10 wings and expect 10 wings, but get 9. 
(To be fair- the bbq sauce was robust & the wings were well sauced)

Ranch: free 
- very runny and watery 

It's pathetic that I had a better pizza slice at Sbarro in the mall the other day - the red pizza sauce they had there was full of life and flavor, plus they probably put 1 handful of spinach on that 1 slice of pizza. Sadly, that's the opposite of Naked Pizza.

The only thing they got going for them is this: open until 3am. 

$31 bill for a disappointing pizza dinner is not cool, not cool at all. We wasted our time and our dime.

This is a great spot to pick up lunch. A newer location opened up closer to my home but I just feel comfy and familiar at this PB. Being a bakery and cafe, they offer lunch and breakfast. They have some tasty options when it comes to breakfast you can choose from bagels, pastries, souffles, breakfast sandwiches and fresh baked bread. It wouldn't be breakfast if coffee wasn't offered so they do have a nice variety of options for that too. The lunch menu is my favorite. I love that they introduce new salads & sandwiches, but also love that they bring back old seasonal favorites. The "You Pick 2" option is great. I love that I can switch it up between soup, salad, and sandwiches. I have eaten inside this location a couple times, but usually just phone my order in and pick it up. They have a program called "My Panera" that you should look into if you plan on eating here more then once. You can earn free food and other cool stuff. I am able to log in online and check the status of my rewards. Please note that currently if you have a freebie and don't use it for 60 days that it will expire. This last visit I saw a sign that they offer catering. I never thought of PB for catering needs, but I bet it is a big hit at most offices. 

My absolute favorite sandwich from PB is the "Roasted Turkey Artichoke Panini"and it really hit the spot last night it is so good! I get the "Broccoli Cheddar Soup" and love dipping my panini into it. Such a nice combo and a comforting meal no matter what time of year it is. I'm glad we have PB!

This location is in a small strip mall with other popular places and the parking lot can be packed. Patience is key!

In the times I've been, I've attempted to try something different on the menu, but I always steer back to the same thing. The first time my friends and I shared the appetizer tower, it was nice because you got a little bit of everything to try. We then came back for Spring 2013 Restaurant Week, and were treated to even more tasty plates. I haven't been able to get the Watermelon Goat Cheese Salad out of my mind since, I just have a hard time ordering it when I'm there because, it's $9 and not very big, so I can't get full on watermelon and then drink, yea know what I mean? For my entree, I had the Monkfish. This was heaven, best monkfish I've had since Buddakan in NYC. And for dessert we had, the Vanilla Ice Cream served with homemade potato chips. This was really creative and delicious. Other menu items I've had, not a huge fan of the Seabass, thought is was a bit dry. My favorite, along with the rest of the crowd is the Pineapple Quinoa Fried Rice. Can't get enough. I like the cocktails here, only thing I wish they would bring back the boba they used in the China Cat Sunflower. They have a great patio, and I love the inside/outside bar.

Vdara is a winner! It has a ton to offer without having to spend a ton of money for it. During CES/AVN weekend, I was able to book 2 nights here for $169/night, which was the best value on the Strip for that weekend. The City Center hotel is just over a year old, so the rooms are really nicely appointed with modern amenities. Although there is no casino and not much in terms of dining options, it's conveniently located next to The Cosmopolitan, Aria and Bellagio, so it's just a short walk to some of the best gambling, clubs and restaurants in Vegas. An additional upside is that the hotel is clean and smells really nice when you walk through the lobby because no smoking is allowed and they pump this lovely scent through their vents. I wish my house smelled like that. 

My BFF and I enjoyed our suite; bed was super comfy, bathroom was really nice and stocked with Aveda products, and there was a mini kitchenette, great for heating up leftovers at 4am. Our other friends stayed in a similar sized king room that had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains so we got a great view of the water show at night. But the rest of our friends had the best suite of all: the 1,447 square foot 2-story penthouse suite with two bedrooms, 2.5 baths, living room and fully equipped gourmet kitchen. There were 6 people staying here, and at $600/night, it was such a steal. Like I said, you can feel like a big baller without breaking the bank here. Unfortunately, their check-in process was a bit of a nightmare as the suite was not ready at 3pm, but they did give them spa credits.

I'd definitely consider staying here again, especially since it's just a hop, jump and a skip away (ok, maybe a painfully long walk if you've been dancing in stilettos all night) to The Cosmo, my new favorite casino resort.

As the name suggests, this is not a place that screams nice sit down meal to impress a date located in a run down strip mall on Desert Inn Road, but your aforementioned date would be indubitably impressed if you brought their food over to her place and curled up to watch a nice romantic movie such as Thai-tanic or any within the Thai-light Saga if she happens to be a fan of Thai-lor Larb-ner (my apologies for the pad thai puns, alas it couldn't be helped).

While Archie's and Pin Kao are familiar Thai lunch staples to the Vegas locals, this hidden gem on the east side of town excels in value and authenticity.   To start off, you automatically knock off a few bucks simply by checking in on Yelp and receiving a complementary Thai iced tea, an always refreshingly cool, creamy, and sweet beverage to neutralize even the spiciest of meals.  One then has the options for the $5.95 lunch specials which include choice of main entree, soup of the day, steamed or fried rice, and veggie egg roll or chicken pot sticker.   The standout option is the green curry.  They are not shy on spice, so my advice would be to order at about 5-6 if you like spicy, and titrate upward with the dry chili flakes at your table since that is essentially what they add to increase the spice level.  My experience with 7 or higher is that the spice overpowers the other flavors and it is not a pleasant experience, especially if you are ordering noodles or fried rice since you can at least extinguish some heat from the curries with steamed rice.  

Whereas Pin Kao is heavy handed with the coconut milk and Archie's can be a tad on the oily side, the curries here are remarkably balanced and packed with vibrant and distinct flavors from the herbs and spices.  All the meats and vegetables components are fresh and well-cooked with toothsome textures.   A few items I've tried off the beaten path include the spicy crab noodle (think vinegary pad thai with bits of spicy crab), thai bbq chicken served with a side of papaya salad and sticky rice (aptly named "the three buddies", there's probably a food porn joke somewhere in here involving the words threesome and sticky, but I will keep this review PG), and the crispy fried pork (good flavors but way too salty).  The noodle soups are unmemorable and the one dish to avoid at all costs is the mee krob.  I've been wanting to try a solid rendition of mee krob (roughly translates to "crispy noodles") which is akin to hong kong style pan-fried noodles topped with a meat/vegetable starchy gravy but having a sweet acidic component and using rice noodles instead of egg noodles, yet the rendition here uses cheap chow mein noodles and drowned with a msg-laden sauce that reminds me of a premium bowl of cup-o-ramen.  I'm going to pretend this dish never happened.  Based on other yelper's photos, the whole fried tilapia topped with a spicy mango relish and the mango sticky rice look pretty legit so they are on the agenda for future visits.  All in all, a solid local mom/pop Thai joint that is easy on the wallet, loaded with authentic flavors,  and hits the spot if you are looking for a quick bite or as a solid take out option on the east side of town.

On my way to Ross J's for some Korean chicken I spotted this new restaurant with a grand opening sign and cartoon character. I quickly flipped a u up the hill in hopes to being the FTR but nope beat LOL. I quite don't remember what was here before but I've been here before just can't remember. Big parking lot and lots of seating. Maybe no room for chacha.

13 iced flavor milk teas such as honey milk green tea, taro milk tea, rose milk tea.  10 iced teas such as bubble green or black tea, mango, plum, passion fruit, lychee. 6 fruit smoothies and 9 other drink that's 38 different drinks, crazy, and you can also add jelly for extra charge. YEESSS

They have roast duck so of course I had to get some. Owner recommanded the roast duck and wonton noodles soup. It's like he was reading my mind. As a lunch special its $7.95 and comes with an egg roll and choice of egg drop soup or salad. Loved the duck and wonton, the broth was between good and ok, and not a fan of the noodles felt packaged maybe!? It threw me off since it says "serious noodles" in their logo. But still the dish and price overall is pretty good.

Their whole roast duck is only $24 has to he a steal, half is $13, and regular portion $10. Their menu looks so delicious and yummy and want to try more but its just to far out of the way for me. I can't keep passing this area and not go Ross J's or Chicken Shack. 

17 lunch specials for $8 can't go wrong. In the theirs about 73 different choices on the menu, there could be more.  Pho, udon, ramen, kimchi fried rice, pad thai, mapo tofu, just check out my menu pics for all the details.

Customer service was good, very friendly.

Down side is theres $20 minimum for using credit cards. So glad I had cash other wise I had to watch dishes LOL

Secret 1 - Yes, I was trying to look you in the eyes, but I'm a man and my eyes tend to stray.
Secret 2 - I'm a bit shy.  So buy me alcohol and I'll open up a bit.
Secret 3 - If you are female and I left you a compliment, it's likely I think you are cute.  Not so for men.

No more secrets!!  I've given too much away--unless you go the Secret 2 route.

Service - 5 Stars
Cleanliness - Excellent
Price - Approximately $26.00 (The soon to be brother-in-law paid).
Seafood - ??
Meats - Yes
Vegetables - Yes
Dessert - Yes, Cannoli & New York Cheesecake.
Fruits - N/A
Other - (1) Located on Level 3 of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, (2) You will find it between Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill and Jaleo. (3) Cash and Credit Cards are accepted here.  (4) Papst Blue Ribbon Beer is on tap here.  (5) Avoid the times 1 am to 5 am because that is the busiest times--that is when all The Situations and J Wowws come out from Marquee.  

What was Ordered:

Pizza with 4 toppings ($26.00) - A-Okay (3 Stars) - My sister and fianc chose a 3 topping pizza.  One side was pepperoni and green peppers pizza.  The other side was sausage and roasted garlic.  All pizza here is thin crust and the large pizza has 8 large slices.  Here is the breakdown by slice:

*The Crust - Meh! I've had better (2 Stars) - You are looking at approximately a 14" diameter of thin crust with tomato sauce and melted cheese.  One word comes to mind, "greasy."  

*Sausage and Roasted Garlic - Meh! I've had better (2 Stars) - The sausage was good, but I think the Roasted Garlic was forgotten--maybe that's why they charged us the 3 topping price.  Plus, I do not think they gave us enough of the sausage per slice to make it more fulfilling.

*Pepperoni and Green Peppers - A-Okay (3 Stars) - Probably the best combination of toppings that made the pizza tasty.  The pepperoni tasted like it was suppose to.  What brought this slice up a notch was the flavor of the roasted green peppers.  

The Secret Pizza is really in a nondescript location--with no signage at all.  If you are near a random billiards table, you are in the right place.  The place is A-Ok, but I've experienced better.  Maybe if I was crazy drunk and just got out of the club, this place would have been rated higher.  Unfortunately, I'm sober.

Pellini is a solid Four Stars.

After reading Ryan J's post on Yelp's "Near You" section online, I walked across the street to have a late lunch.  I arrived around 2:30 and there was less than a dozen or so diners, both inside and out. Apparently at lunch time, they had a line two deep outside. This was after being open to the public for three and half weeks.  A good gauge as any for a new restaurant.

Like Ryan, my first impressions are pretty positive.  The concept if you will, is an Italian version of Chipotle.  I'm not sure if the owners would agree, but here are your big three choices.

First, you could start with a Pellini.  What they say is a classic Italian Piadina.  A sort of Italian flat bread (think tortilla) that you can stuff with meat, veggies, cheese and dressing.

Or, you could have a Pasta Bowl with an angel hair base, then the grilled meats, veggies and cheese.

Lastly, you could have a Salad Bowl, again with all of the above added on.  Got it?

The meats range from two types of chicken (breaded chicken breast or grilled), steak florentine with olive oil and garlic, italian sausage, scrimp scampi, salmon with rosemary and lemon zest, or you could just go Vegan.  

The prices range from $6.55, up to $7.95 for the two fish entrees.  At this point, you can add from nearly two dozen ingredients, like artichoke hearts, pancetta, grilled eggplant, arugula, et cetera.

I had the Pellini with grilled chicken with spicy marinara (Arrabiata) and various veggies.  It was very good (photo) and filling.  

I had a chance to meet two of the managers and they were very excited on how they have been received with very little marketing.  I understand this is their first restaurant in the concept and are looking at other locations in the valley.

Pellini offers free WiFi and they have an Italian radio station playing music in the background for ambience. 

Enjoy!

This review is for the restaurant only. Please come here for dinner with a reservation if you would like to be treated like shit by both staff and management. In a town with hundreds of restaurants competing for business you would think they would consider customer service an important part of the customer experience. Especially since they are new here. We arrived this past Sunday evening at 9:32 PM for our 9:15 reservation for two people. Yes, we were late by 17 minutes. 
Hostess: Can I help you?
Me: Yes, reservation for David.
Hostess: What time?
Me: 9:15
Hostess: This reservation was cancelled after 15 minutes because you did not arrive on time. 
Me: OK, can we be seated still?
Hostess: I don't have anything. Just a moment.
At this point my wife says to me "let's go".  I take a walk back into the restaurant and see that about 25% of the tables are empty. This is a Sunday night at 9:30PM.  I come back and the hostess ignores me. I tell my wife that the hostess is a bitch and we should probably just go. We leave. 
As we enter the MGM casino a man starts yelling my name out loud. He chases us down and says he's the manager and asks why I called his hostess a bitch. Instead of being concerned that we are leaving without ever experiencing their restaurant he takes my private conversation with my wife and accuses me of calling their hostess a bitch. I would never do that and told him so. He continued to ask why I bothered his hostess. Very unprofessional, very harassing, we walked away and told him we were treated poorly and would be sharing our experience on YELP!  My wife's first intuition was to leave. I thought we would give them a chance to seat us but I was wrong. As usual my wife was correct.

We were in line for the Belgian waffle bake to raise funds for St. Mary's Food Bank just outside Chocolade van Brugge, but the line was moving so slowly, so we decided to just check out CvB and head to a nearby restaurant for some cocktails.  I initially went in to have a look around while the others were in line and was impressed at the display of truffles, in particular the dark chocolates.  Going back out there and seeing that the waffle toppings were just Hershey's chocolate sauce (contains corn syrup), brown sugar, canned whip cream, and caramel sauce (most likely made with corn syrup), I opined that perhaps we should just skip the waffles and go for truffles, instead.  It didn't take much to twist their arms...  13 truffles and $25 lighter later, I walked with Marian to store our truffles in their cooler in the car and returned to meet with the others just in time as a nice young woman came around handing out dark chocolate strawberry and amaretto truffles to sample!  We all chose the amaretto, and they were d'lish!  

$2.50 per truffle, four for $9, eight for $18, and twelve to thirteen for $25, and that's about as much as I cared to memorize.  Everyone who checked in on Yelp got 10%, plus a coupon for 5% off on the next visit.  On our walk to store the truffles in the car, I told Marian I wished the coupon was for another 10% off on the second visit, to which Marian replied "that would be dangerous."  I suppose so... Lord knows we don't need any more reasons to splurge on sweets, nor waste any more money on said sweets!

p.s.  I wanted to wait till I got home to take a photo of the truffles, but I couldn't help myself and had one of the coffee truffles in the car on the way back-- oh, my!  So, so good, and I really liked the sound of the break and the way the chocolate reveals the creamy center in the middle.  Excellent dark chocolate flavor, with slight floral notes, and the coconut flavor was good, not overpowering at all, and not cloyingly sweet, either.  Overall a great truffle.

p.p.s.  Fred, who'd assisted me with info on the chocolates and what goes into them (no corn syrup, all-natural, no "flavorings"), sent me an email thanking me for my review and to clarify that he actually made all of the sauces (he specifically mentioned the chocolate and caramel) without corn syrup.  I hope CvB holds another Belgian waffle event soon, so that I may try these homemade sauces.

I had my first Wahsun experience last night and I'm still drooling as I think about it!

I could make a meal of the egg rolls alone - the best I've ever had and that's saying a lot... I've eaten my fair share of Chinese food over the years.  But of course we didn't stop at the egg rolls.  We had soup, potstickers, pork belly, lomein, shrimp, green beans, mushroom and bok choy, fried rice, and eggplant.  Don't worry - there were six total in our party and with Wahsun's large portions, there were plenty of leftovers, so it was a meal that will keep on giving!

Service was decent, especially considering how many people were working.  I think it's just Rose (the owner), her husband, and her eleven year old daughter (who happens to seat your party, take orders sans pad, answer the phones, and handle beverages)... pretty impressive!

Thanks to our friends Richard and David for introducing us to Wahsun... and for the amazing company last night.  It's definitely worth the 20 minute drive across the Valley, and I can't wait to do it again soon!

PS - sorry to anyone that may go to Wahsun this week and attempt to use the bathroom.  I think my husband broke the toilet last night!

*** Mmm-mmmm .... 
      That IS a tasty burger. Vincent, ever have a Holsteins burger?
      Wanna bite? They're real tasty Holstein Beef.
      Well, if you like burgers give 'em a try sometime.

Olivia and I gave Holsteins a try and were impressed by two amazing burgers and great service. It's not cheap, but totally felt worth it. We split two and added a Fried Egg ($1 extra) to each at the recommendation of the bartender.

Burger 1: The Rising Sun ($17) with Kobe-style Beef, a Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Tempura Avocado, and a Spicy Mayo with a pile of Thick-cut Onion Rings. Simply delicious blend of beef, avocado, egg, and sauce.

Burger 2: El Machete ($16) with Fire-roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions and a Spicy 'Machete' Aioli with a side of Steak Fries. The Fried Egg really made this a great and messy burger. Even though it wasn't spicy, I still devoured it.

 *** Which burgers are Holsteins Burgers? 
       Well, they're the ones with Bad-Ass Burgers printed right on the menu.

Both Holstein masterpieces were such tasty burgers, we tried to go back the next night, but they had closed about 10 minutes earlier :(. We even knew which two burgers we were gonna get: a Big Fat Greek Burger ($17) with Lamb, Feta Cream, & Tatziki Sauce and a Billionaire Burger ($28) with Kobe-style Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, & a Truffle Mayo. Next time.

*** You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?
      Ah, hit the spot.

Besides burgers, Holsteins is famous for its dozen or so Bam-boozled Shakes loaded with liquor. These three sound like especially tempting: Frozen Grasshopper, Crme Brle, or Red Velvet Cake Shakes.

Holsteins Shakes and Buns is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel near the East Tower and the Las Vegas Strip. If the place is busy, my suggestion is to get the burgers and shakes to go and then take them back to your room to enjoy them with your own tasty beverages and entertainment.

I never expected to give Holsteins 5 stars ... and it may truly be between 4 and 5, but compared to other burgers and disappointments in Vegas the super service and juicy, messy, and flavorful burgers of Holsteins stood out. Like Ahhhnold, I'll be back.

Knowing full well that this festival could be a major bust, we came here with the lowest expectations. Even with the worst expectations, this festival stooped below that! There is nothing Italian about this festival. It's more like a cinco de mayo carnival or a shitty kabob cook-off. You're better off going to First Friday for quality food! 

People hate this fest - for good reason too. It. was. terrible. So terrible! I had to see it, to believe it. 

When we first moved here a few months ago, we were actually really looking forward to going to the "Italian Fest" (...yeah right) since my boyfriend is Italian. But after hearing and reading about all of the horror stories, scams, and terrible food, our enthusiasm died down immediately. Unfortunately, we didn't get to dodge the bullet this time since our friends wanted to meet there for dinner and I didn't have the heart to crush on their plans. 

The verdict? Let me tell you this, it's not worth it at all. At all! Everyone in our party had this look of complete disgust on their face by the end of the night. Talk about buyers remorse! Not only was this "fake Italian food Fest" a scam, so were the not-so-Italian vendors acting overly stereotypical "Italian" 

Vendor: Ayyyyye guys whaddya gonna do?! Comma try authentic sausage and peppahs justa likea momma usedtah to makea! 

Me: no thanks 

Vendor: ahhhhhhhhhhhh! You see dis!? You see dis? (Throwing his arms theatrically in the air in disappointment that we're not buying his food) 

Me: Keep walking. Hurry. 


Here's how you quickly burn money:
- $18 for 2 adults to enter this hell-hole called San Gennaro Feast

- $8 for doughy-as-hell, stale, and nasty funnel cake from Funnel Cake Factory

- $15 (!!!!?) for a super ripoff ((1 inch)) lobster (cut with all crab) roll from the Lobsta Trap. Are you f'n kidding me?! Who the hell do you think you are playin' with give'n us that ant sized portion!?

- $12 (?!!) for ((3)) !!! offensively-salt-bombed jumbo cajun shrimp from T&T's Shrimp Basket

- $10 for a plate of stupid, overcooked, burnt, rock-hard steak and dry-as-death chicken kabobs with wilted salad and dripping in oil, soggy fries from Kabob House 

^^^ you have been duly warned. 

Only 3 items were actually decent and worth recommending:
- $5 for 2: 1 chicken and 1 pulled pork tacos topped with coleslaw and a side of baked bean chili from Billy's Bar-B-Que. I highly recommend the pull pork tacos topped with coleslaw! Juicy and delicious!!! 5/5

- $4 dried and overcooked BBQ corn from the Roasted Corn on the Cob stand. The corn was overcooked but it was pleasantly sweet. Just make sure to add all of those toppings and you're in business! 3/5

- $5 for a cold, bread-y, mushroom & olive calzone from JR's fine Italian Cuisine. The gal apologized to us that it was cold and took it back to reheat it. That didn't do much to make it better, but my Italian boyfriend ended up finding a glimmer of satisfaction in it. 3/5

Oh yeah, and to the lady that uses terrible sales tactics at the front entrance, harassing us to buy a groping session with your dancing monkey...ain't nobody got time for dat!

Many Las Vegans have declared that pursuing authentic Taiwanese food in this town is like finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. My ever-growing curiosity in this uniquely ethnic cuisine, as well as guidance from people who are knowledgeable about this food has led me to Noodle Pot. I can say, without a shadow of doubt, that this establishment has superseded  my expectations!

Following a brief stop at the Shavery, I ran into Will (a.k.a. the artist formerly known as SnowFlake), along with a couple of Yelper's, and we decided to go to Noodle Pot. I have driven past this joint many times without thinking twice to stop in. It was a startling revelation to learn that, according to Will, Noodle Pot has some truly legitimate  Taiwanese grub in Vegas. Most notably, I wanted to try the national dish of Taiwan, spicy beef noodle soup.

I admire extraordinary mom-and-pop, hole-in-the-wall resto's, and Noodle Pot fits the bill to a tee. The comfortable yet lively vibe keeps the interaction going. After the server sat us down, we ordered some appetizers along with the spicy beef noodle soup.

Cold Vegetable Appetizer Plate - The first time I ordered this it came with pickled cucumbers and other vegetables, and wheat gluten. The cucumbers were marvelous, with the correct amount of saltiness to harmonize with the sweetness used in the sauce. The wheat gluten was another smash hit. It tasted incredibly akin to a concoction of beef and chicken. 

(Note: Coming here on a separate visit, and ordering this dish again, they had replaced the wheat gluten with soy sauce hard-boiled eggs. I notably did not enjoy them, and I was not too confident to which tree the egg grows on, but that's just me ((hehe)).

Pork and Chive Dumplings - Another sublime feature! The dumpling wrappers tasted hand made, and the filling inside was outstanding with perfectly tender pork matching the bright flavor of the chives. The vinegary soy sauce dip was the icing on the cake.

Beef Roll - My least favorite item, but pretty splendid nonetheless. Slices of beef and cilantro wrapped around a thin crepe. I actually prefer other Chinese versions that use a thicker, flakier scallion pancake in which the inside is coated with hoisin sauce. But, it was delish.

Spicy Beef Noodle Soup - the "Pice de rsistance" to our meal. We opted for the wide noodles instead of the regular noodles (think of it as thicker version of pappardelle). The noodles were perceived as if they were hand made and hand pulled, even though they probably came from a special noodle factory. The broth was nuts! It was packed with beef flavor, but exceptionally delicate. Hints of tomato added depth. Large portions of tender beef dotted the soup. Also, if the server has not brought out the chopped pickled cilantro, ask for it. That combined with the baby bok choy in the soup will give the dish a marvelous variation!

Many have mentioned this before, but I will proclaim it again. CASH ONLY!!! Save the plastic for the surgeon's table! :D

(Another side note: I took my brother here when he visited and at the time they had run out of beef so we opted for the Spicy Beef Tendon Soup. Even though I was fine, my brother returned home and had the hershey squirts for the next few days. The soup comes with a tremendous amount of tendons, so if you are not used to eating lots of offal or weird animal bits, I would be cautious when ordering this version).

Who said you have to cheat on your diet to satisfy your sweet tooth? Not Rita! I don't know shit about Italian Ice, but what I do know is I loved Rita's and It exceeded my expectations.

They just opened and it seemed every kid in the valley has a job at Rita's and they all work at the same time. All of them friendly and eager to answer your questions and provide samples. It was overwhelming for me a bit, but I appreciated it since it was my first time. Hell, I would rather see them here instead of ODing on bath salts or tagging the neighborhood. Who cares? It's all about the product.

I LOVED IT. They had Sugar-Free Cherry and Sugar-Free Mango Peach Ice made with Splenda both which I highly enjoyed. The ice was soft and the flavor tasted so far from anything Sugar-free I've tasted in a long time. On this day they gave me a Regular Italian Ice for free which I chose to have both flavors. I also had to try the Italian Ice and Custard layered which is called a Gelati. I went with Vanilla custard and the Sugar-Free Mango Peach Ice. This was heavenly considering it was 250 degrees outside. I had every intention of just taking a few bites and throwing it out, but of course that didn't happen. I ended up inhaling BOTH of the treats! I had brain freeze into my nose which was awesome! Little Miss Frozen Face at your service!

Downsides- The space they have chosen is VERY small. There is nowhere to stay and enjoy your Italian Ice. There is only one bench outside. Good luck getting it. I sat in my car to grub. Also the price seems high for the sizes. The Regular sized Gelati was around $3.50 and it was very small. The custard is SO filling it was more than enough for me. Also online there is a product called the Slenderita which seems to be a low fat soft serve I was hoping to have instead of the custard. FYI, they do not have it and it is discontinued. It was also weird that there was no music playing.  

Overall I loved Rita's for offering the most superb Sugar-Free dessert option in my neighborhood. Thanks for helping Henderson stay cool this summer. I cannot wait to go back and try more!

If Chef Marc's were any better it would be on the front lines entertaining the troops, kicking taliban ass, while rebuilding local infrastructure and giving local children education. But wait it doesnt stop there. It would also come home a glorified war hero and help rebuild the American Economy and finally just FINALLY get rid of all today's shitty ass music and possibly resurrect Tupac...

Anyway i never been here before but often hear the raves of Chef Marc and how totally awesome is it. Lately i've been hankering for some good Italian food. So i set up a UYE http://www.yelp.com/biz/tien-hosted-a-uye-uye-at-parma-by-chef-marc-las-vegas

10 people all going for tasting menus with some opting for wine paring. I'm not exactly a wine kinda guy so just food for me. Tho their italian beers were quite nice.

Cant exactly remember what we all ate but it was good. Damn good. If i wore panties they'd be dropped by the 3rd course. Oh and holy crap the bread is NICE!!! with the garlic butter on top and the balsamic vinegar and olive oil...sooooo nice

So going off of memory lets see what we had

1 - Conch Salad
 - Very good texture, soft and not rubbery and oh so tender. Flavor was a little off for me but it opted a good opportunity to use the "real" salt they offered. Balanced quite nicely after that

2 - Escargot (our special diet friends who opted not to have escargot got some kind of ravioli)
 - Two per person served on a slice of bread drenched in garlic butter with some herbs. Not exactly the freshest snails available but they did their best with what they had and it was no less then absolutely delicious 

3 - Fried Brussels sprouts with some kind of spicy prawn
 - I've only eaten brussel sprouts on a handful of occasions. These were halfed then fried to give them a nice flavor. The spicy prawns...wow just wow these were nice and plump and had a mild rising heat to them. Again quite nice

4 - Pasta with wild mushrooms in some kinda sauce with ham in it - Pappardelle Wild Mushroom
- LoL at my naming of items. This was the highlight of my dinner. The absolute best thing in my opinion. Pretty sure it was fresh pasta seeing as i've never seen noodle that big only on TV. The sauce they whipped up to bind the pork and mushrooms together with the noodles...genius...Ask Christie O i kept trying to steal her togo box the entire night.

5 - Some kind of fish... - Wild Snapper Livornese
- Some kind of fish and a portion of a barley like grain served with a tomato based sauce and a few strips of broccolini. 

6 - Dessert - Turamisu and Chocolate Mousse Cake
 - Holy crap the little square of Tiramisu was orgasmic. The other chocolate cake thingie was good but holy hell the tiramisu...


I have finally discovered Chef Marc's...Now they will have to discover a way to keep me away.

I'm mortified!  I've never written a review of the Farm at South Mountain?  I'm not sure how this is even possible!

I go here so often that this might actually be my favorite place in Phoenix to go for a relaxing cool/warm Saturday or Sunday afternoon in PHoenix.  In fact, I think I'm headed there momentarily.

Many people write reviews for the various "businesses" at the Farm on South Mountain on the wrong Business/Venue pages.  But I guess this listing is a catch-all for everything.  Let's see if I can help people get this clear.  I really want to point that the Farm at South Mountain has several "businesses" and venues listed on Yelp.  You can go here for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  You can have your baby shower here or your 200+ person wedding and reception here.  You can hold a corporate event in "Stoned Grove" area around an outdoor pizza oven or you can have an intimate dinner under mature trees with glimmers of stars at night at Quiessence.  This place is a one stop shop for everything simple and beautiful in the out of doors.  I've written reviews for a few of the places on the farm and I will let those reviews speak for themselves.  I've posted pics too... 

One of the things that the Yelping community might appreciate knowing is that you should visit their website for special events.  Sometimes, they have special Farm dinners.  Sometimes there's a special holiday dinner or lunch.  For instance, I know for Valentine weekend, they have Valentine Dinners and Picnic lunches.  

Here are my reviews of places on the farm:

Maya's Farm (At the end of the Farm Drive and directly North.)
Organic Certified Farm.  See them at the Farm on Sunday mornings.  Phoenix Public Market on Saturdays and also get on their CSA)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz/mayas-farm-phoenix#hrid:5dPGtdn4SQIClbJ_uIe1zw

Succulentia (it is in the green house on the north side of the farm, back by Maya's garden House)
http://www.yelp.com/biz/succulentia-phoenix#hrid:Z91CIQ4jVqF9RG3HrRe22w

The Farm Kitchen 
(Lunch/Brunch and is the closest to the Picnic Tables.  you see it immediately as you enter the farm, north of  "The Farm Driveway".)
http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-farm-kitchen-phoenix#hrid:7w3mgerwC9Yqd_b1amkDjA/src:self

Morning Glory 
(Breakfast only, but the patio is a nice place to rent for an event.  Go All the way to the end of the Farm Drive and YOu'll find it.)
http://www.yelp.com/biz/morning-glory-cafe-phoenix#hrid:yzI8RxBsNlKndP1HMQ0Q6A


There are a few other businesses on the Farm listed on Yelp
Weddings:
(I am sure there was a wedding listing on Yelp for the FASM because I used to check in to it accidentally when I first started Yelping.  If I find it, I will update)

Quiessence (I haven't written a reveiw of this either.  SMH!!):
http://www.yelp.com/biz/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix

Botanica (Been here once, but no review)
http://www.yelp.com/biz/botanica-phoenix-3

This is a great place to visit after you've completed a Hike on South Mountain too.  Enjoy.  Thank me later.

I recently stayed here for a bachelor party. The hotel lobby was decked out with sick flat screen columns that looked like wall paper, but changed throughout the day. The check-in counters used iPads (with a stylus?!?), though it seemed like a fairly frivolous addition. 

Service at this relatively new hotel was extremely rough. We had a block of rooms reserved together before we arrived, however at check-in that information was lost and people were checked into rooms all over the place. The staff worked hard to get us rooms in the same tower at least and ended up comping us each for one night and giving us half off the second night (a few of us were stuck room-less for 3 hours). In addition to the check-in mishap there was a "cleaning" problem in one of the rooms. I won't get into the details, but it needed immediate attention, which unfortunately had to be requested multiple times. Also on Sunday morning I ordered room service that never arrived, when I called to check on it they suggested I go to the buffet instead.

My suite had a great view of the Bellagio fountain. Decor was attractive and it felt spacious enough for one. The bachelor got a massive bungalow (he was majorly upgraded due to our many service issues). It had a private entrance to the hot new club: Marquee as well as 3 floors, views of the club, and an outdoor hot tub. Unfortunately the lack of sound insulation meant he couldn't sleep until the music stopped (after 5am). Also the fancy stereo system wasn't working on the main floor so we couldn't pipe in any music. Furnishings in the bungalow (like the couch) seemed designed more for ease of cleaning than style.

While it's a cool looking hotel for now, I suspect the heavy use of technology means it won't look or feel modern for all that long unless they have a big budget for frequent upgrades. In my mind... Encore remains the Vegas champ.

This place is probably one of my FAVORITE places to get breakfast!

My friend brought me here for the first time a few years ago and I loved it! Everything on the menu is amazing! The last time I went I got the Banana nut bread french toast. It was delicious. One of my other favorites is their corned beef hash. But my other recommendations? Everything! I've also tried their Pecan pancakes which are delicious. I really want to try their crepes and that fried egg bagel next time I'm in or even their lunch menu sounds really good. 

The only downer for me is that it's quite far for me, but well worth the drive! &  If you go on the weekends there's going to be a wait since it does get pretty busy. I might be writing another review for it once I try their lunch menu. =)

The following review is specifically for the "Bungalow room type" 

These rooms are in the attached two story building out by the swimming pool. We had a ground level room with a sliding glass door facing the parking lot and a busy street. 

Did not have a secure feeling as it felt like anyone could walk up from the street and have direct access to the sliding glass door. The rooms are all nonsmoking in the Bungalows so the sliding glass door was good for lover boy to go in and out for a smoke. That was the only good thing! 

Thank goodness I had my lover Sean with me for protection, otherwise I would have been sleeping with one eye open. 

We only stayed here one night as we attended an industry VIP open bar event and showing for "Purple Reign" who performs at Hooter's. We planned on getting sloppy drunk that night so figured we could just crawl to our room and avoid driving for the night. 

This room sucked balls, and not the good kind. The bathroom tub was moldy and the water did not drain, seriously I took a shower standing in half a tub of water! The walls and floors had major mold as well. 

The room was very small, and had one outlet for electricity which was occupied by the lamp and TV. We had to reach behind and unplug the TV just to charge our phone, ridiculous. 

The towels are cheap, stained and shredding. Wow the quality is so bad it makes paper towels a better option to dry off with. 

The ice machine was broke, took housekeeping 45 minutes to bring us a bucket of ice. 

Yes! You get what you pay for in Vegas when it comes to hotel accommodations! It was $27 for the night (weekday) we stayed on a Tuesday. 

Crappy rooms, moldy bathrooms and no outlets for charging your cell will leave you with a stinky taste in your mouth by staying in these rooms! 

Hooter's is a huge let down, it is obvious they have given up and are not going to put any money into keeping this property updated. What a shame! 

I normally complain when something is this bad, luckily for the front desk we had partied so much and just wanted to jump in bed and get busy. 

I later sent an email to Hooter's "Customer Service" with the complaint details of our stay, did I get a response? Of course not...lol I knew that was a waste of time. 

Don't do it! Please Please I beg of you!

I've heard so much good stuff for here so we came for lunch on a Friday afternoon on our way to Vegas.  Luckily, there was no line to get in and we go seated near the windows with a view of he strip.  The bad thing was, it was so far away from the food!  :P  No prob though, we needed to get the cardio in.  

We started in the salad line and made our way through the whole buffet.  I loved the way it was set up.  Lots of action stations and lots of variety.   

However, I don't know, I wasn't impressed with the flavors of things.  The best thing I had was the beet salad.  That was really good.  Everything else was just average.  I'm not much of a drinker, but the unlimited beer and wine was cool.  The root beer on tap was really good too. 

The service we got was average, some of our dirty plates were on our tables a lil too long though.

I'd like to try other places again before coming back here.  I guess the $16 price tag for lunch was a deal for the variety to keep everyone happy.

***Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate is pretty good (and is topped off with some nice whipped cream), but it is quite overpriced at $11***

I have always wanted to try Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate.  Serendipity has a takeout booth where you can get many drinks and such to go or a sit-down restaurant where you can get a full menu of food options as well as the frozen hot chocolate in a much nicer presentation.  I opted for the takeout booth.

The frozen hot chocolate is a good portion size and features a frozen chocolate concoction, which is similar to a milkshake though it really is an iced chocolate drink.  The chocolate drink is good.  It is cool and refreshing and has a good chocolate flavor.  I wouldn't say that it is any more memorable than any other good frozen chocolate drink out there, but it is satisfying enough.

They top the drink off with whipped cream and the whipped cream is good.  It is a little thicker than a lot of whipped creams out there and it has a pretty good vanilla flavor.

Service was quick on my one visit.

Prices were high--probably too high (maybe even too high for Las Vegas).  The frozen hot chocolate runs $11.  I think outside of Vegas, a drink like this one would most likely go for $6 and would probably not exceed $8.

Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate is a good but not special drink even though you are definitely paying a special, premium price.  I think it is good for at least one try, but I think the flavor does not really stand out that much.  There is a Vosges boutique in the Forum Shops and that chocolates boutiques used to serve milkshakes--they were far better in terms of flavor and even a little cheaper than Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate.

Now that Vosges no longer offers those milkshakes, I'm not sure where you can find a great frozen chocolate drink in Vegas, but a less expensive Haagen-Dazs milkshake would probably provide just as satisfying flavor and experience as what you can have at Serendipity (with the exception of the whipped cream).

Serendipity is located in the outside dining area at the front of Caesars Palace.  Caesars Palace offers both complimentary valet and self parking.

It's a sad story that you hear every once in a while, a grand opening kick off party setting low expectations. I'm guessing they will learn to iron out the kinks here though.

With a weekend packed full of stuff scheduled through the Yelp events page, I was excited to cap off Saturday Night with a grand opening party at Gypsy Bar. We heard that theres an adult's only arcade in there, and skee ball is the wifes fave! I liked what Gypsy Bar is doing with the arcade, bar, dance club atmosphere. Apparently, so does half of sun city's most eligible bachelors; the dance floor seemed to ooze ben gay. I wasn't so excited, waiting about 10+ minutes for the bar staff to notice me standing right in front of them, waiving my arms in hopes that they would grace me with their presence. "Vodka diet, and a diet coke for the DD please" I said without hesitating; I didn't want to miss my opportunity. $10 later, I wouldn't call it a cheap drink, but I certainly am glad they didn't charge $12 to pour some kettle one into my cocktail; it's about what I was expecting.

We spent a few minutes checking everything out and another 45 minutes or so playing air hockey, skee ball, basket ball, and other games of the arcade variety. My best skee ball score was 34,000, in case you were wondering. I could have done better though, given enough time, money, and dedication to achieving the high score.

I considered busting out my uber white guy moves on the dance floor, but I wasn't really into the 80's / 90's remix the DJ was spinning. Sir mix alot isn't on my personal play list and for good reason. 

In need of some personal validation, I was bounced from the girl at the door, to the bar staff (another 10 minute wait by the way), and ultimately the maitre d' desk at Lucky Strike next door to get my CityScape parking ticket stamped. Save yourself some time and skip bouncing from staff member to staff member; go directly to Lucky Strike to get your ticket validated too.

I'll likely check them out again down the line, but I won't be running out the door to make a night of it if there's something better to do on a Friday or Saturday. 

Sorry Gypsy Bar, that's just how I saw it. Happy Yelping Phoenix.

This was one of the best food evenings I have ever spent.  I made my reservation through their process about a month ago.  While I originally requested the 5:30 seating, there was a singleton space for the 8:30 so I went for it.

I showed up about 8:05 and handed my gold ticket to them.  I was then escorted to the bar where I had some ice water and started to meet my dining mates for the evening - Greg and Lindsey from Glasgow, Scotland.

At about 8:40, we were escorted into the separate dining area that has a horseshoe shaped table with 8 seats.  Behind the table was the staff ready to greet us, tell us a few rules, and encourage us to ask questions about anything.  Then the dinner started.

Over the next three hours, the staff made some of the most creative, tasty, and beautifully plated dishes I have experienced.  Since the room seats 8 people only, generally four servers each took 2 plates so all 8 of us were served in unison.  I had the non-alcohol drink paring which gave me a chance to have spirit-like drinks along with the other diners.  And in two instances, my food or drink was not laced with alcohol but with lemonade or some other substitute.

Each of the 20+ courses was explained.  We often had questions about technique, ingredients, or other matters.  One of the chefs came out of the kitchen to explain the red mushroom we enjoyed and explained why it was red and whence it came.

The staff is amazing.  They are friendly, always smiling, and always enjoying what they do.  I really felt that I was a valued visitor.

The room - oh it's quite different.  Two walls are lined with card catalog boxes to represent the knowledge Andrs has built up in his mind over the years.  There's a bustier which know one explained on the wall and a ladder with high heels on the rungs.  Very creative and innovative!

Midnight was almost upon us as we finished the dessert courses.  We then signed the guest book - I was diner #1693.  I then passed the book to Lindsey to sign and so we went around the table.

I recommend this to anyone who wants to try something very different and wants to find out about molecular gastronomy.  It was truly a very delicious and memorable evening.  All the staff at  made it outstanding with food and service!

The dumplings are their saving grace. One star for each dumpling I ate. Everything else was pretty bad.
First off, they ran out of plates. What kind of place runs out of plates?! The waitress gave us little plastic dipping cups instead.... which doesn't help.. Secondly, I don't think they train the staff very well because when we asked for napkins, she gave us 3 pieces.. we had 4 people in our party.. I mean, give us a little more. No need to skimp on paper napkins... And third (which was the worst), they ran out of dumplings! We ordered pork & zucchini which came out right away however, she said they were still making the pork & cabbage. We thought it would be maybe a 15-20min wait... but we ended up sitting there for over an hour. If they were out, she could've told us at the very beginning so we could've chosen a different flavor or just skipped it totally. 
The four of us ended up cancelling the pork & cabbage ones since we had to leave. Very disappointing. Lucky for them, their dumplings reminded me of the ones my grandma use to make back at home. The skin is hand rolled and chewy just the way I like it. The dumpling is stuffed to the brim with porky goodness and the juices drip off the skin once you bite into it. Dip the dumpling into some vinegar and hot sauce and you have the perfect dumpling. We also ordered some of the apps such as the chicken wings (skip), popcorn chicken (good), and liang ban fen pi (noodles were too long, difficult to mix with the non-existent peanut sauce). Just stuff yourself with dumpling goodness. 

TIP: Wait a few more weeks for this place to work out some of their kinks before you go or you might not even be able to get the dumplings!

"America Runs On Dunkin" 

There are two things wrong with Dunkin Donut's slogan. 

The first thing is that their slogan should not say "America Runs On Dunkin", it should say "Most Of America Runs On Dunkin" because here in California, there is no Dunkin Donuts shops. 

The second thing that is wrong with their slogan is that I don't believe anybody could run after consuming one of their cake donuts. Those things are so heavy that after you do consume one, you won't have the energy to get up and run. 

I had been told by many friends and relatives that Dunkin Donuts are the greatest tasting donuts on earth. Since we do not have any DD in California there was no way for me to verify their statements. Well last weekend my girlfriend took a trip to Las Vegas to celebrate her mom's 50th birthday. Since I knew there were DD in LV I asked her if she could pick up a dozen of them on her way back home. When she arrived at our place I was super excited to see that DD box in her hand as she walked through our front door. These are the donuts we tried 

Chocolate Cake, Chocolate Glaze, Glaze, Double Chocolate Cake, Vanilla Kreme Filled, Blueberry Cake, Apple Spice, And a bag of Glazed Chocolate Cake Munchkins 

Their cake donuts were delicious. I loved how they were somewhat crispy on the outside and super moist and doughy on the inside. The blueberry cake was by far my favorite. The dough is packed full of delicious pieces of blueberries and the top of the donut has a tasty glaze on it. The regular glaze and the chocolate glaze donuts were just OK, defiantly not the best glazed donuts I have ever had. The vanilla kreme and the apple spice were both really good, but again not the best I have ever had. Their little chocolate munchkins were awesome. These might have been the best bite sized donuts I have ever tried. 

After trying Dunkin Donuts I do believe that they are much better then the chain donut stores that we have available in CA (Yum Yum and Winchell's) and I also think they are much better then most of the mom and pop donut stores I have been too, but I do not think that they are better then So Cal's big three donut shops (that is just my nick name for these shops). So Cal's big three are "Donut Man" in Glendora, "Stan's" in Westwood, and "Randy's" in Inglewood. In my opinion these three places are fifty times better then DD and at least a hundred times better than Yum Yum and Winchell's. 

I'm glad I finally got to try DD. I can now say that these donuts are much better then the chain stores we have out here but I won't go as far as crowning them the king of all donut shops. In my opinion that title goes to "Donut Man" in Glendora. 

I do believe that DD needs to come out to CA. In fact if any Yelper out there wants to get together and make some money, maybe we can call up the DD headquarters and get them to let us franchise one out in CA. I think we would make lots of money. All these people from the east coast who rave about their donuts would give us all sorts of business. My only problem is that I might eat up all the cake donuts we had in stock, especially the blueberry ones.

I had a slice of pizza from this place at a friends house shortly after they first opened. I couldn't remember if I liked it or not, so I suggested to hubby that we try this place for dinner. The employees inside were very courteous and friendly and the guy who gave me the pizza let me know they offer delivery, which is a plus if you like the pizza. 

Hungry Howie's claims to be "The Home of the Flavored Crust" and offers 8 different types to choose from. The concept here I do like. It sounds like a too good to be true pizza place. Well, it is in my opinion. The 8 types of flavors are butter, asiago cheese, cajun, butter cheese, ranch, sesame, garlic herb and onion. Sounds great right?

I ordered a large "Cheese Pizza" and a large "1/2 Pepperoni and 1/2 Sausage Pizza" as well "Asiago Howie Bread" to go along with the pizza. When I first opened the pizza it looked great. I asked for the cheese pizza to have butter cheese crust. I could see the ring of butter soaked into the pizza box around the crust and it didn't bother me because I did order a pizza with butter on it, but the crust as well the pizza in general had no real flavor. Maybe all the butter cheese flavor soaked into the pizza box instead? The pizza wasn't gross, it just wasn't great. Very average for all the flavor the menu claims to offer. Hubby had garlic herb on his crust and after I sampled a bite of his crust I tasted no garlic flavor. The howie bread I found to be dry and not the type of cheesy I was looking for. The total was $25.93 for the 2 pizzas and bread which I wouldn't have minded if the food tasted as good as it looked. I might be up for trying this place again in the future, but not anytime soon. 

Other things offered on the menu are salads, calzones and wings. You can also order online.

New First Meal/Breakfast Review:

A couple of months ago the AZ Republic had coupon inserts for Taco Bell's roll-out of their new breakfast menu. They call it The First Meal. Not being a breakfast person, I ignored it. 

Well, several months later, more and more TBs are starting to serve breakfast.  Soon almost all their Phoenix locations will have it. What can you expect?  Typical Taco Bell faire with some interesting twists. 

Their big new item, is something call the "AM Crunchwap".  Your choices are either bacon or sausage. I tried the bacon and it's quite good.  It's a little smaller than their normal Crunchwrap, maybe 3/4 of inch.  It's filled with scrambled egg, bacon, cheese and a creamy Jalapeno sauce that gives off a little heat.  Yummy!

The key to the sandwich, besides the flavorful sauce, is a very thin circular hash-brown that is in the middle of the wrap.  I liked it and it's priced at only $2.49 each. BTW, breakfast is served until 11 am.

Should Mickey Ds next door start worrying? No. But along with their Bacon or Sausage Skillet (Soft Taco) for $0.99, it's a nice alternative.  The Combo meal ran me slightly less than $4.00, excluding tax.  

Surprisingly, there doesn't seem to be any decent coffee option.  When I paid, the server offered me a medium drink. Taco Bell's First Meal won't change my habit of skipping breakfast, but I might give them a try every couple of months.

Wow, I just gave a Taco Bell Four Stars.  D'oh!

I was really craving a "nice" dinner somewhere and my new Vegas friend and I decided to try out the buffet here since we heard good things from other people about it. Also I had gotten kicked out of the Wynn earlier in the day and it really made me want to walk around inside in a spiteful and evermorecurious manner. 

Downsides:
-It will cost you upwards of $40 bucks for dinner.
-Lots of nuts in food, but they have labels for food allergies! 
-After partaking of the lunch buffet at Paris, I felt the selections here weren't that different. 
-Only power outlet that I could find was in the bathroom. (You don't want to know. Or do you?)
-King crab legs were still frozen :(
-Sushi sucks, no sashimi at all unless you count the smoked salmon sitting on a tray in a different section.
-Prime rib was better than the buffet at Paris and it was tender and more edible, but lacked flavor. Maybe I'm meat spoiled. 

Upsides:
-Beautiful beautiful decor!
-I got to try rabbit, which I can't remember if I've had before but I would like to say that I have. So let's say I got to resample rabbit. 
-Lots of choices.
-Beautiful dessert selection.
-We got to traumatize an older couple sitting next to us. Muhahaha.
-Silverware and table settings are still in new condition. It sucks to eat somewhere that has ratty utensils. Just saying.
-Our server was great with her timing. She would come by to clear plates and refill drinks without being gone too long, or checking up too frequently. 

Overall, it was great. I wish I could have eaten more and that I got to experience it without having buffet for lunch so I could have appreciated the food more instead of comparing.

The word bachi means to treat others how you would like to be treated in return.                                                                                            
That's sweet...but that's not why I came to Bachi! This is why I came:

"Grilled to your desired temperature, our burgers are glazed and caramelized over an open flame using a proprietary soy, sake, and mirin-based marinade. The perfect crust is formed holding in a succulent specialized mix of ground Certified All-Natural Chuck and 21-day dry-aged ribeye"...GOOD GOD!

Bachi Burger is located in a small strip mall on the south side of Vegas. Bachi is a decent sized joint with a chill, relaxing vibe. 

The menu is made up of burgers, steamed buns, sandwiches and salads, all made with Asian inspired ingredients. My honey, Eugine Y, recommended Bachi to me and boy, my baby boy was right; it was SO worth the drive.

Since I don't make it to LV often, I went balls out at Bachi. This is what I ordered:

Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger- Chili mayo, fried egg, Furikake, caramelized bacon, & crispy onion rings http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=V5kPRRaoHF6UCdwU-3-XWg                

Mr. Ho's Burger- Angus beef & pork patty, green onions, cilantro ginger, garlic, Hoisin Mayo, Lup Cheong, sauted mushrooms, mizuna & a TARO Bun  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=aMy63-xKofPONtJqkZTVqg  

Ronin Burger- Caramelized onions, Japanese Cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ & Yuzu citrus aioli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=buuw6JhKpiwkp5ShWAqGqg 

Pork Belly Steamed Buns- Pork Belly, cilantro scallions, radish, boiled egg, Chinese black vinaigrette & five spice Hoisin BBQ sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=dbB6j3SqnngaPORSemc2yw       

Truffle Parmesan Fries- Parmesan reggiano, black truffle porcini cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=EI77DnK2YetftJkN_EnR0A

Dipping Sauces- Sun dried tomato aioli, pineapple ketchup, Yuzu citrus aioli & garlic chili aioli http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=dzbNYbrAZdjErCp-T5F8kw

Portuguese Donuts- Coffee ice cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=u4J7iFwsi2cqeHtoxfcCcg

Watermelon Milk Tea http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=M7ZF6_JdMOdCoDxqZnpfkA

We started with the pork belly buns and fries, both were amazing. The PB was so juicy and fatty and the steamed buns were perfect. The fries, because of all toppings, had an awesome taste. The dipping sauces were all tasty too. But the burgers.. oh their burgers were unlike any burger I've ever tasted. My taste buds were in a state of euphoric shock. The intense flavors made me smile from ear to ear. I can't begin to describe how phenomenal each burger was. The patties themselves were so juicy and each had a glaze on them that tasted fabulous. And the toppings... so good, so fresh.  The donuts for dessert were great and their watermelon milk tea was easily one the best milk teas I've ever had. 

Prices here are great. Everything was surprisingly reasonably priced. The service was great as well. Each employee we spoke to loved to talk about their food and told us all about how things are made and so on. 

Seriously, if I lived in LV I would be a regular here. I know I only visited Bachi once but I'm so ready to call it my all time favorite burger joint. It was amazing. Please, if you like burgers check it out. It's worth leaving the strip for. TRUST

This is the buffet to end all buffets. I have had my eye on the Sterling Brunch for so long but I finally got the chance to check it out with the help of Groupon. When it popped up a few weeks ago, I just couldn't resist. 

My fella and I came here this Sunday to partake in some delectable lobster tails, king crab, sashimi and lamb. Some of the most recent reviews noted that some of the items ran out later in the day so I made sure to make an early reservation. We arrived at 10:30 and were taken to our table immediately. Our server came up to us immediately to fill our water and champagne glasses. He also gave us a rundown of the layout of the buffet and offered his suggestions. We immediately made our way to the buffet to start our foodie adventure. 

I started with the lobster tails, king crab, lamb, sashimi, caviar and eggs benedict. My fella did the same and we returned to our table. The food was definitely better than any buffet food I've ever had. I was beyond excited for all the choices available to us. Desserts were excellent as well. This is definitely not a meal we will be doing again any time soon, but it is something I recommend everyone do at least once. 

It is clear that they prepared well for the onslaught of people who came because of the Groupon that was offered. I even overheard conversations among staff about how much more champagne they had been going through since the Groupon became available. They definitely prepared well. They were well-stocked on all food and drink items and definitely well-staffed. We never wanted for anything and our server was extremely attentive and accommodating. He made chit chat with us and was so friendly, I really appreciated the excellent service here. 

Every part of the meal was 5-star from the start to the end of the meal.

One, two, three strikes, you're out!

Let's just talk about last night's dinner:  I really wanted to love this place but it just wasn't working out.  Maybe it was the ripe sewer smell as soon as you walk in [Johnny Rockets at Westgate also has this issue] or maybe it was the lack of hot tea on a super cold December evening... I like to attribute it to the fact that they overuse the "orange sauce"  and unagi sauce on EVERYTHING.  

It wasn't just a few artsy swirls of the "orange sauce" and unagi sauce.  They absolutely drench it.  You can dive in with scuba gear!  Maybe I didn't notice that I wasn't ordering a wide array of items but I swear almost everything I saw on the menu had the same sauce combo.  Eating the Firecracker Jalapeos, The Mexican Roll, and The Kamikaze Roll felt and tasted the same to me.  The only real difference between the two rolls was that The Mexican had peppers on top with cooked salmon [yes, cooked] and imitation crab while The Kamikaze had avocado on top with spicy tuna and tempura shrimp inside.  Other than that, it felt like we had three of the same dishes since the sauce was so overwhelming.  Thinking back to it is seriously making me feel a little queasy.

The tacos here are pretty decent and we ended up ordering edamame on the side to help switch up the taste after eating so much orange and unagi sauce.  Like I said, maybe they do have more variety and we didn't see any but I don't think I'll be back to test this theory.  Portions are pretty generous and you can at least ask for easy sauce but it's your poison if you choose to dine here.  Too many great places to eat to just settle for sauce-drenched-everything.  Service here could also be a little better considering when we went, we were just one of three tables.

$27 each [for 2 ppl] including tip for edamame, firecracker jalapeos, two rolls, three tacos, and an iced tea.

I've never been inside an Ox before let alone a Blue Ox, but I dig it. Blue Ox is better than blue balls, blue eye shadow and blue anything else maybe. Babe knows what's up.

Blue Ox is a small dimly lit tavern that you probably pass every day. That's okay with  me. Keep passing it PLEASE. More Ox for me:) They do have regulars I'm sure, but I don't know any of them. My favorite group was this older man and I swear his sister wives. This lady had the longest french braid with the bumped bangs in the front and a shirt buttoned up to the roof. The other lady looked slightly more modern with a slutty skirt suit on. Definitely 3rd wife material. Not Boss like 1st wife. Other than that the crowd is all over the place from what I gather.

FOOD: All about them chicken fangers. Not to be confused with fingers. You have to say fangers because you have to say it with love cuz they are in a class above the entire universe of chicken fingers. They are the size of Arsenio Hall's big ass alien fingers. All white meat dipped in that crunchy beer batter made fresh to order. NOTHING BEATS THEM. They have different sauces to dip them in and always served with their homemade potato chips and house-made Ranch. The fangers are the star here, but there are other delicious items on the menu as well. Example: Grilled chicken salad. I try to stay clear of fried foods most of the time so I do get this salad loaded with chicken, eggs, tomatoes and all the other salad fixings I like. However, my cheat day breakfast item of choice is the Country Fried Steak. I have only had it once, but hot damn it left a mark on my heart and on my thighs. It's the size of the Hustler Club. Excellent homemade soups are bomb, too and the kitchen is open 24/7.

DRINKS: Dirt cheap. I want to say my guy had a tall, spicy Bloody Mary for $3. No drinks are over $5 that I have ordered. The bartender is quick and friendly. Hell, all the staff is super cool.

Did I mention the jukebox? Full of 80's, Dave Matthews, Blink 182, etc. I spend more money on the music then I do on the food and booze!  

Blue Ox is my bar. I come here and can set the mood with the music and always have a good time. Please, keep passing it by and leave it all to me:)

I had just arrived at my friends place in Arizona and was hungry after the 5 1/2 hour drive.   My friend suggesting a few places to eat, but there are few options in Buckeye, AZ and Cracker Barrel is the only one that sounded good.   I'd heard of Cracker Barrel but never been, so this was my chance.

We walk towards the front door and past a bunch of rocking chairs.   Anyone up for a game of checkers?

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#sRuGjwo7Pn78W7CL3EaPog

SERVICE:  Our server Deana was pretty awesome.  Very friendly, always with had smile and not far away if we needed anything, including a beverage refills we never had to ask for.   The food came out of the kitchen in a timely manner as well.

FOOD:  After looking over the large menu of southern comfort fixin's, I decided on the Fried Chicken Salad ($8.69), a side of Mac & cheese ($2.59) and a side of the "Hash brown casserole" ($2.59).   My friend ordered the chicken tender sandwich platter ($8.49).

My salad was good as salads go.   Crisp lettuce, crispy chicken tender pieces, grape tomatoes, cheese & croutons.   Simple, but tasty overall and really hit the spot!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#z6-H47IpF9u2nPk3QuEhIQ

Mac & cheese = ooey, gooey, creamy & cheesy.... Pretty tasty and more flavor than just melted Velveeta.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#DFuHeGdidUkXxC5-qBA9Mg

I had to try the Hash brown casserole because "it was there".  Very cheesy and oniony, it's quite rich, but quite tasty!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#tba2M2j_hNS77K2TVaflCw

My friend said his open faced chicken sandwich (w/fried rather than grilled chicken) was very good, though he didn't eat any of the corn bread and apple butter that came with it.

After my third trip to Tien Wong, I thought it was time to write the raving review it so obviously deserves, even despite the fact that they do not serve alcohol!

Hot Pot is basically fondue with a soup broth instead of cheese. It is an absolutely amazing concept and is a great group or date event. It is a blast to go through and pick different veggies and tofu (they have meat and fish as well) and try new things you never would have tried under normal circumstances.

I have really grown to love the greens, Tang O, taro root, the five spice tofu, and the iced tofu. They have probably 5-6 kinds of mushrooms, bock choy, spinach, four or five types of noodles, dumplings, and somehow like 4-5 different types of tofu! It is amazing! You also get a peanut and a soy dipping sauce, but I think the flavor of the vegetables drenched in miso is amazing without any sauce!

I saw someone complain about the price here on Yelp, but we had dinner last night for 4 with a hot tea and a dessert for $50.00 total. We had 4 different dishes of tofu and 7 different kinds of vegetables in our huge pot of miso broth so that we could try our a variety. Every single one of us was stuffed and remained full throughout the rest of the night. I think it is a great value. 

People who don't normally eat vegetables or Asian enjoy the fun experience, and enjoy being able to try something they normally wouldn't. Also a great place to take a group of people so that you can all try something a little different.

I have been to this salon twice. The first time was only ok. I had an appointment and told the girl exactly what I wanted. When I got there I sat down right away. The girl was very brash and not very friendly at all. When I told her what I wanted (a full set, very short and natural and not thick. I asked if gel's were possible) she said she couldn't do the gels (even though I've had them before) and that she could do pink and white's. The reception and the nail tech went back and forth about whether or not there was enough time. I was annoyed because I had booked time for a full set so I knew I had t least an hour. Once it was all settled she got to work. I had asked for them short and she just didn't listen to me. They were way longer than I wanted. 

I went back in 2 weeks later for a fill. On a pink and white you sometimes needs the pink and the white done and sometimes just the pink. I had let them know when I booked the fill that I would want the nails short and that the white would probably need to be done. The receptionist told me no, the pink would be enough. So of course, when I went in...I didn't have enough time scheduled. I told them I would go elsewhere and they "moved some things around"

The girl who did my nails was referred to as "tiny" but I believe her name was tina.When we were discussing that I wanted my nails short she kept trying to change my mind ( so she wouldn't have to fill the pink and the white I assume) and i was very annoyed.  Once she started  it quickly became the most painful and uncomfortable fill I've ever had. She drilled so much that my fingers are sore and red now. And she kept pulling and bending my fingers even though I asked her to go easy. (my hands were sore that day).  Due to all the drill work my nails have lines and spots that are visible through the top coat,

When I checked out the receptionist asked how everything was and i said "not great". She waited a beat and looked and me and then said "what?" pretending not to hear me. I told her nothing. it was just ok. She didn't even ask why? She asked if I wanted to make another appointment and I said I would not be back. She said great have a nice day. 

Also while I was there, employees were speaking about other customers in a very unprofessional way and swearing. It was so uncomfortable. 

The fill was 38 dollars. I didn't even get an I'm sorry.

I do not recommend this salon. Nor will I return there.....

I finally made it over to Pink Box Doughnuts to see what everyone has been raving about. I will say one thing, you cannot compare Pink Box to places like Dunkin' Donuts or Winchell's because they are simply different. After having Pink Box, I can't see ever going to one of those chains again when I can go to a locally owned shop and taste the love in each bite. These doughnuts are made from scratch daily.

They have the doughnuts broken down into 3 different types: classic, specialty and gourmet. The classic such as "Glazed" or "Buttermilk" are $1 each. The specialty doughnuts like the "Bavarian Creme" are $1.25 each and gourmet favorites like the "Fat Elvis" or "Date With A Nutty Pig" are $1.75 each. They have half and full dozen boxes (pink of course!) with prices ranging from $8.50 - $12.50 for those.

I saw on Facebook they were now selling "Cronuts" so of course I asked about those. They were sold out! I spoke with Lance behind the counter who said they had made Cronuts 3 times that day already. I went just after 11 am so apparently people are scrambling to try them. Not having tried the original from NYC, how can I really compare it though? I guess I just want to taste it and get some sort of idea what it might be like. I will try again! Lance says you can just call ahead and if they have the menu item you are looking for then they will hold it for you. 

So I decided that I needed to try the "Fat Elvis" after hearing about it and I am kicking myself for not trying this sooner. DELICIOUS! It is just flat out good! The Fat Elvis is topped with chocolate icing & a caramelized banana, and filled with a homemade peanut butter & banana filling. This doughnut had me feeling stingy since I didn't want to share a single bite with hubby, but I had to darn it!

The 'Apple Fritter" needs some work. The texture is perfect. It is soft and chewy inside, and crunchy on the outside where it needs to be. The thing that gets me is why it's called an apple fritter if there are no apples in it? I didn't bite into a single apple! Boo-Hoo!

When I saw a Doughnut with fruit loops on it I had to give it a try. I was told by a worker that this was called the "Fruit Loop Doughnut" and I get the fun concept, but it just doesn't work. The long glazed doughnut is really good, but the fruit loops they put on top just absorb the glaze they rest on so they are soggy and chewy. 

Last and certainly not least is the "Cinnamon Tornado" and I have to tell you, it lives up to the name. When I took the first bite it was like a tornado of instant flavor, and it seriously melted inside my mouth. Very yummy.

There was a sign out front that said they are now open 24 hours on weekends.

"A Cheapskate's Guide to Having a Kickass Time at Marquee NIghtclub"

Who says that you need to be filthy rich, a celebrity VIP, or attached to a group of skankily-dressed girls in order to waltz into what is (supposedly) the hottest nightclub in the USA right now?  I'm a nobody, but they let me into Marquee -- and I had a blast!  Here are my tips:

1.  BE A HOTEL GUEST.  Assuming there isn't some special event going on, Cosmopolitan hotel guests don't pay cover (which, in the case of guys, is upwards of $50).  Hotel guests even have their own line, which means only 5 minutes of waiting instead of the usual 2+ hours.  That's all it took for me to move past the velvet rope.  (It also helps to be super polite to the bouncers and door staff.  They're used to self-entitled douchebags throwing money around, so a simple "please" and "thank you" will go a long way.)

2.  PREPARTY APPROPRIATELY.  In my case, it was a Yelp event down the street.  In your case, it may be vodka in your room or a cocktail in the Chandelier bar (conveniently located across from the Marquee entrance).  Anything to avoid paying for $20 well drinks inside the nightclub.

3.  FIND A LIQUOR REP.  Speaking of avoiding overpriced drinks -- it turns out that many Vegas nightclubs have reps from beverage companies giving out freebies of new booze that they're trying to market.  Look for these people, be friendly to them, and tip them a lot!  The night I was there, Asahi beer reps were giving out free bottles, and girls in short skirts were carrying trays of free vodka cocktails.  Good times!

4.  WEAR COMFORTABLE SHOES.  Marquee is a gorgeous venue, but it's enormous and spread out over several levels.  I was lucky enough to be whisked up to the club via elevator, but latecomers have to walk up some 4-5 flights of stairs.  On the main level, there is the main room with a dancefloor, the pool/dayclub/cabana area, as well as the smaller Boombox room.  Up even higher is the Library (my personal favorite), with a more eclectic music selection and stylish decor.

5.  MEET OODLES OF CRAZY BRAZILIANS AND AUSTRALIANS.  Vegas nightclubs are especially popular with international tourists -- and Marquee is no exception.  Foreigners are especially keen on meeting Americans, drinking with Americans, dancing with Americans, and then proceeding to make out with Americans.  Take advantage of this... if you dare.

6.  DANCE SO MUCH THAT YOU FORGET HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO SIT.  It's true that there's nowhere to sit in Marquee unless you're dropping thousands of dollars on table service.  Screw sitting down -- that's for wimps anyway.  I recommend that you stay standing -- and dance the night away instead.  :-)

I contacted two promoters before even coming here to get a booth for me and 9 gfs.  They both said it would be 1k specifically for a bottle of goose & Hennessy. We get to the table reservation line and Kevin the promoter was the biggest jerk I ever worked or come across in all my years of clubbing.  Omg, he didn't know we were on his list and was being plain rude before finding out we're on his list of table reservations.  So far, I'm already irritated.  Don't treat the people who are the reason you have a job like that whether you "think" they're on your list or not. Told us to be there at 10 & we didn't get in til past 11. 

The gentlemen who walked us in was nice but informed it was $1075 for both the bottles.  Ok, $75 more than we spoke to the promoters about. No big deal on the price difference but a big deal on the principle.  

After we get seated, hostess brings out two bottles, Fiji water and redbull with my $1800+ bill. WTF??? At this point, I'm ready to bounce.  She explained they don't have anything but Hennessy black. Once again, trickery.  Long story short, she brought out regular Hennessy, took away waters and redbull, never brought me back my receipt or credit card after I signed like she said she would.

I "heard" whoever opened hakkasan did it to provide guests with great service, mark my words, I won't be back.  The ambiance was alright and if we didn't have a booth we would've left because it was way over crowded. 

Called hotel & club the following day to be put on hold and repeat my personal info a few times to have no luck or apology for losing my card.  So annoying to spend $1600+ and be treated like shit.  So overrated, had so much more fun at light with free drink cards and no booth.  

Btw, expect to be charged a service fee of 4%, plus gratuity of 18%, and taxes.

#Vegas #EncoreBeach

Encore Waitress: "Are you ladies okay?" 
Us: "Uuhhhhh yeah. We just need a minute to take this all in."
(Proceeded to pick our jaws up off the ground)

The truth was it took about 15 minutes for us to take it all in because this place is ridiculous. My girlfriend and I decided to head to Encore Beach Club on our first day in Las Vegas as she got us on the guest list. We expected some people hanging out by the pool and what we got was a movie called: BIKINI DEBAUCHERY 2. There must have been at least 1,000 people at the pool on this day and it was packed with half-naked 20-30 somethings. If you can't swim, don't worry, there are lots of flotation devices (aka fake boobs) everywhere. We decided in order to acclimate ourselves to this party we really needed a drink or two. 

Be prepared to pay through the nose for drinks and food. My friend's Bud Light was $12 and my bloody mary was $19. Holy tomato juice Batman! We were starving and decided to split an $18 burger from the Grill but surprisingly it was one of the best burgers I've had in my entire life! Worth it for sure! 

If you have the chance, order one of those waterproof cell phone/credit card holders off of Amazon. That way you can put your phone and money in it and swim with it around your neck. Why would you want to do this? Uh, because it's $15 for the bag check. 

Other than the price tag for everything (let's not forget the $20 cover for guys), this was one of the best pool parties I've ever been to in my life! The DJ was amazing and there's just something super fun about partying in waist deep water in the hot sun. Although it probably would have been more fun if I was a 21-year old single girl, the people watching is extremely entertaining. I was here for my bachelorette and it only gave me more proof that I making the absolute right choice in getting married. But if you're ready to party like a  single wild thing then this is definitely the spot for you!!!

One word, delicious.

If you can read more than one word, then read on my friend cause this is one of the best Indian restaurants that I've been to. 

Some hobknobs might find the location a bit shady, but the interior of the restaurant is clean and well put together and makes you forget about all the bums across the street. Whataraya gonna do? Amirite?

This place has only been opened a week or so. The service here was good. While the waiters were new and seemed untrained in the usual customer service/waiter chatter, (family owned restaurant I assume?), they were still very polite and attentive, and boxed our food to-go for us. No complaints from me, they refilled my water glass often as I slew down all that spicy curry.

Good news for all vegetarians, half the menu is vegetarian based, which put me in a chipper mood right off the bat when we entered. They also have multiple chicken and lamb entrees if you're still craving the meat food. For me not actually being a big fan of curry, the food was amazing and I ate till I was beyond stuffed. I forgot the names of the dishes we selected, but I had a nine vegatable combo with mild spicy creme curry and my boyfriend had the traditional chicken curry. Both were just right in hotness and didn't leave a chalky taste in my mouth like most curry does.

The grand finaleeeee....Naan bread. mmm yes, that's right. the garlic naan bread here is so delicious I just wanted to go adopt a new puppy or something. Was so good that I got another frisbee shaped bread slice to-go.

With all that and an extra bowl of rice, the price for two was pretty decent. We ate there during the dinner hours where they gave us a menu, but they also do a lunch buffet which I have yet to try. I plan on coming back here as this place has awakened my curry craving. I'm getting hungry just typing about it.

Cafe Monarch is everything the five star reviews make it out to be and more. It's a must try for a unique brunch/lunch/dinner/whatever experience in the valley! I'm reluctant to review this place since I don't want to wade through patrons on my way to another lovely Sunday brunch, but my taste buds will not be deterred. (Plus I have until September before they re-open, so there's plenty of buffer room.)

It's an impromptu fly-by-the-seat-of-whatever-the-chef-feels-like-whipping-up type place. The kind of place where you show up to breakfast and are asked one question: Sweet or savory? 

So whatever you do, leave those picky eater at home! When it comes to dinner, you don't want a wonderbread palate ("Um, I don't eat anything green...") influencing the meal. Chef Christopher is a dynamo in the kitchen, and you need to leave that one man show plenty of room to create his masterpieces. No exaggeration, his dishes are crazy delicious masterpieces. It's like having your own personal top chef customizing something just for you.

The fact that this place is BYOB makes my heart smile. I love sharing a couple bottles of good wine or champagne among friends over dinner, and the fact that I don't have to pay a restaurant mark-up is ideal. He's also cool with you brining in some orange or cranberry juice for  DIY mimosas in the morning. There's a $10 corking fee, but considering the fact that a glass of wine is often more expensive than that, it's a screaming deal. 

Be forewarned that this is a dining experience rather than a quicky meal. A much more European approach to lingering and enjoying the food, drink and atmosphere. It will take you a couple hours to get through everything from initial seat and greet with the chef (who doubles as the waiter/busser/todos!) to your last scrumptious bite. Totally worth every minute of waiting. Also, you might not want to come here starvin marvin. And definitely don't invite anyone you can't stomach hanging out with for a couple hours. 

Let's wrap it up:
-Don't bring picky eaters.
-Don't come so hungry that you'd eat the ass end carpaccio out of fresh roadkill.
-Don't bring socially awkward schmoes that will suck all the fun out of the room because you've got to be around that for hours, man. Hours.
-Do BYOB, and don't be afraid to bring a mixer for mimosa fun.
-Do bring cash only, and tip very, very well. (He deserves it!)

I now set you forth upon the world with the knowledge necessary to enjoy all that Cafe Monarch has to offer. Use it wisely.

Dear owners of Commonwealth, 

You built an amazing bar and a beautiful space.   Good beer and drink selection too.  It really could be called the crown jewel of the "new downtown".  Too bad you ruined it by running it like a douchey club that interferes with a patron's ability to relax and charges ridiculous prices.

The space you built is exceptional -- quirky design mixing elements of a lounge and upscale European chateau with laidback couches, chandeliers, a rooftop patio with an open air bar.  The drink selection is excellent -- great selection of beers and some nice creative cocktails.  After 5 minutes in your business, I thought it was a solid 5 star rating all the way.  

But why . . . why are you running this place like a douche magnet?  Why the hell would you build a lounge-like pub and then refuse to let people sit on the weekends without paying for "bottle service"?  Seriously.  Why the hell would locals ever frequent a place where they can't sit down without paying 1000% mark up on a bottle of liquor?  And putting a velvet rope outside with a bouncer to control access to your bar?  What the hell?  And no happy hour?  And no prices on the beer menu?  That's not classy.  It's just annoying.  I guess I understand wanting to hide your prices given that you're charging the tourist/rip off rate for drinks.   

I've visited your bar twice and I can officially say I'm done.  I won't be coming back and won't be bringing visitors.  You're absolutely a one-and-done type of bar.  Most everyone I know who's visited, has not gone back.  Too expensive, too douchey, too uninterested in wanting people to come back.

A piece of advice: in 6 months to a year when you're not the hip new kid on the block anymore and start to notice that your bar is pretty much empty until 9 pm (like Insert Coins), start making changes to encourage locals to be repeat customers: 1) Get a happy hour, 2) lose the stupid velvet rope, 3) let people sit down without buying $100+ of liquor.  Treat your customers like you want them there and don't just want to bilk them out of their money.  Start trying to earn their money by having an inviting bar and you'll bring the locals in.  Don't and you'll be closed by the end of 3-5 years.

After picking up tickets at will-call for Absinthe, we figured "hmmmm, now where to eat?"
We were stranded on the expansive grounds at Caesar's Palace and figured the wisest choice was to check out the restaurants inside the hotel. 

That being said, we headed straight for the forum shops!
A quick stroll lead us to Wolfgang Puck's world famous Spago!

Having dined previously at the iconic Beverly Hills location, I came with an expectation of good quality food and great service. 

We were running late so we wanted a quick but tasty meal. With the attractive al fresco dining option albeit indoors with artificial skyline and people watching galore, we opted for cafe seating. Within moments, we were seated and began perusing the menu. 

For appetizers, we enjoyed the oysters on a half shell. Let me tell ya, these lil' guys were fresh, plump and with the addictively tangy cocktail sauce, it was a virtual party in my mouth! Foodgasm guaranteed!

Now onto the entrees:

Spaghettini with a side of roasted chicken - I've been on a scratch made pasta kick lately, so when I had heard they rolled out fresh pasta daily, I was instantly sold!  There's a difference in the texture, flavor and overall mouthfeel of the pasta! If you haven't had it fresh I strongly advise you try a plate of the spaghettini here. It's phenomenal! Each strand was coursing with a vibrant red sauce which lent its wonderful aroma from the fresh basil. The richness of the sauce and marked acidity came from the ropa vieja tomatoes, which rounded out the flavor profiles of this winning dish perfectly.
And the chicken? Tender and juicy with an irresistibly crispy skin that I devoured in a flash!

Lamb Chorizo Pizza with rapini, sundries tomatoes, goat cheese and cilantro -  Now this was my kinda pizza pie! It was nice and thin but definitely not lacking in the flavor department by any means. The lamb chorizo was savory and well seasoned and the crunchy rapini added a pleasant  contrast in texture. The chopped cilantro and fresh tomato brightened up the dish and definitely took this droolworthy pizza to another level of deliciousness! 

Service was prompt and friendly. Our waters were always filled and staff constantly stopped by to see how we were doing, which was nice for a bustling cafe. We enjoyed an elegant meal that was quick, unfussy and delicious!

Overall, I was quite pleased with my experience here and it goes without saying I'd  definitely come back.  Hopefully with time to spare on my next visit, ill give the main dining room a whirl.

Until then,

Happy Eats!

I was extremely disappointed in my experience with The Root Salon. I want to mention that I did NOT end up getting hair cut here because of SEVERAL scheduling issues. So my review is based solely on that. 

I called to book an appointment with Roxanne after hearing pretty rave reviews. When I called, I was told that it was a long wait to just get my ends trimmed. Totally okay with that. For the time I needed, and day of the week, I was looking at almost a 2 month wait. Right when I was ready to give up, the receptionist told me that she just got an opening for what I thought was Monday June 24th. Monday June 24th rolls around and I make the 45 MINUTE DRIVE over to the salon. I was told that my appointment wasn't on Monday, but on Wednesday the 26th. Apparently, Roxanne doesn't work on Mondays. So I must have written it down in my planner wrong. I said to the receptionist, "So I'm 2 days early?!" And she told me "Yes." Feeling like a complete idiot, I told her that I would see her on Wednesday the 26. We said goodbye, and I left. 

Finally it's Wednesday and I'm getting my hair cut! Woo! I make the 45 MINUTE FREAKING DRIVE to the salon. I walk in, and this time a man is at the front desk. I tell him my name, and that I have a 6:15 appointment with Roxanne. HE SAYS NOTHING. I say something sarcastically about hoping that I have the right day this time. He asked for my last name, and I start to get worried. PLEASE DO NOT TELL ME I'M NOT ON THE SCHEDULE. I ask him if I have the right day, and he said "No."

YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. I explain what happened, and what was said between me and the receptionist and he just stared at me. I told him over and over that I was clearly told that my appointment was today. I was basically told that I was out of luck, and that my appointment is sometime in freaking July. That is NOT what I was told over the phone, and NOT what I was told in person 2 days before. I asked to be taken out of the books for WHAT EVER appointment they decided to place me in, and stormed out. 

Twice I drove almost an hour, for days that were confirmed, only to be told that I wasn't there on the right day. I do not get appointments wrong. No one apoligized. I don't think I've ever been so infuriated with a business. I never write bad reviews, but this just needed to be known. Mostly known to The Root Salon. It was bad business. You lost a potential customer and my referrals. I have nothing positive to say about any of it.

I have never fully appreciated nouveau cuisine. It has always left me a little hungry and a few Benjamins short. LOL 

Our introduction to Cantina Laredo was somewhat inauspicious, since they misplaced our reservations on a busy Friday night.  

We also had the same experience with the hostesses that fellow Yelp'er Teehee wrote about.  But in end, we had a nice evening, with our bill coming in at the low end.  

After the confusion and a five minute wait, we were seated near the patio. It was a nice location and we had the added bonus of observing a pre-wedding family dinner of eighteen. 

Cantina Laredo likes to market itself as serving "modern Mexican food in a sophisticated, vibrant atmosphere. ... with a Mexico City style menu."  I believe it's more Mexican petite nouveau cuisine. 

We started off with a delivery of chips and two types of salsa. The milder version had a nice tomato base. But it was the spicier one, with fire roasted peppers that was the standout. It was complex and so delicious, that you could have eaten it with a spoon. 

Next was their table-side guacamole making called Top Shelf for $9.99. It was an exquisite. Now I make this all the time at home, yet it always seems tastier when someone else is doing it. LOL

Somewhere along the way our white honey sangria was dropped off. It was very good and fairly priced served in large 12 oz flute glass. Nice!

For dinner we decided to share two entrees. One was their Vera Cruz Enchiladas (photo), which was a nice mixture of spinach and chicken for $13.99; and the other was the Carnitas Tacos for $13.79.  The enchiladas had a nice flavor and kick. Both were very good, with the street tacos seeming deceptively small. 

The bill came to about $30 a person including drinks, but before taxes and gratuities. 

So Four Stars, and yes we are Fans of Cantina Laredo. While eating here might not get you a doggie bag for later, you will go home feeling as though you've enjoyed something special.  Remember to make reservations like we did! LOL

I stopped here over a week ago but it was before the business was open for the day so I knew where to go and what time.

I stopped in yesterday and bought two chicken pot pies--one with cheddar crust and one with habanero cheddar crust.  They were in individual boxes and the boxes were not marked so we had to guess which was which.  I din't learn this until I got home.  

They gave me a sheet with baking instructions that were very accurate.  I baked mine a little longer than they suggested but I wanted a nicely browned crust. 

After baking, I turned the pot pies over onto plates and a bit stuck to the bottom which is what I expected.  I have made my own and I know this happens.

The filling of the pot pies was good.  You can tell the freshness by the carrots alone.  When I bit into the carrot slices, I could taste the fresh taste of carrot that hasn't been frozen but is a fresh produce item.

A couple of things about my experience.  I wish I had noticed the lack of marking crust flavors on the box before I got home.  That being said, my wife and I found almost no difference in taste between the two.  The habanero just was not evident.  I also find that chicken is the only option and your flavors are determined by the crust, the chance for different tastes is very limited.  What I'd really like is a curry chicken pot pie.  That you could taste and it wouldn't be that much extra to do.

The pot pies were OK.  I know I'm paying for fresh ingredients and they roast their own chickens, but the cost for the size of the pie is high and maybe it has to be.  I won't need their buyers' card for getting a free one after the correct number of purchases.

Tip:  If you're going to Pie Me Over, look on the east side of Rainbow for the Firehouse Subs.  Pie Me Over is in back behind the buildings in the front of 6070 South Rainbow.

I actually got to attend the pre pre-show party on the 26th, which was more commonly known as the event that was supposed to be two hours long, around 1,000 people showed up, and not many got in.  The fact that I did feels nothing short of a miracle.  From what I gathered, the Facebook invite got leaked, so they got way overbooked, and just couldn't handle the traffic flow.  So a lot of people didn't get in, and a lot of people (understandably) weren't happy.  How that's going to affect the initial impression remains to be seen.

Conceptually, this place is very clever.  Simply put: I like theme bars and restaurants.  I still mourn the demise of the Star Trek Experience as it was just great fun, and nothing really has replaced it.

Goretorium is a year-round haunted house attraction with a bar.  All those places that pop up this time of year with mazes and blood and people jumping out at you?  This is a 365 day a year version of that.

Being the pre-opening, and considering the awkward crowd control, I don't think the place was 100% operational, so it's hard to critique in some ways.  The downstairs bar wasn't open, and it's hard to say if the upstairs bar is accessible to the general public, or just a bonus for the end of the horror experience.

As far as costumes go, they have some GREAT ghouls.  Zombies, mad scientists, magicians, and even "Bloody Mary" was really cool.  I've worked a few horror gigs over the years, and I was trying to figure out some of the special effects.  I'd like to see how they interact with the crowd under a "normal" day.

The maze was well done.  Plenty of lead up, a couple of nice jumps, lots of blood and trickery.  My friend accidentally walked into a wrong door (I followed, naturally my luck), and it led into a cast holding area.  Oops.  But they held in character, and they teased when we went down the "right" path.  I won't spoil the haunt itself as that's half the fun, but the end of the experience leads hapless wanderers into an upper level bar area with a nice view of the Strip.  They even have a unisex bathroom, so if you walk in, and something doesn't seem right, it actually is.  Someone could have warned me, though.  I had that initial "Oh, crap.  Wrong bathroom" moment, and I couldn't even excuse the mishap on too much liquor.

There were a few things I'd make note of.  I think $40 is simply too high a price to charge for the attraction, especially with the economy still being so "meh" right now.  $30?  I could better see that.  Locals discounts?  I'd strongly consider that, otherwise they are going to have to cater exclusively to tourists because unless you love horror, and I mean LOVE horror, the experience is fun, but a one time deal.  Especially for the price.

The gift shop wasn't much to look at, either.  Not a varied or wide selection, though it looked like they were selling prop surgical tools.

It's unfortunate that Goretorium seemed to have such a rough first night, and hopefully the bad taste will leave people's mouths so they give the place a chance later when it gets some kinks worked out.  I stayed out of all the "political" aspects, and as a customer, I had fun with my group of friends.

Goretorium has potential, and I love wacky theme bars, but the prices shouldn't be the scariest thing there.

Given the room we were in I think 3 stars is about right, had we been in a better updated room then I could imagine it being 4.

The rooms were ok, nothing special but they were a place to sleep which is really all we wanted for our 2 night stay. My Husband booked 2 rooms via his Perks subscription for us and his Family to stay in. The rooms were on the small side and really dark inside, they really had seen better days too. Paint was chipped and housekeeping wasn't overly enthusiastic in regards to the dusting but the location was perfect. We were on the 21st floor which has some nice views and was quiet, what I really didn't like was there was only one working Ice Machine for the entire floor, I had to walk right around to the other side of the building in my PJ's twice to fill up a tiny little bucket.

Britney happened to be performing on the 2nd night that we stayed and thought it nice that they place her pictures up around the elevator area, not so cool when fans are holding up the line to get one while posing and taking pictures though. Maybe have a designated area for this sort of thing?
The casino downstairs is pretty big and there is a great selection of shops and eateries, I LOVED the fact that Gordon Ramsay Burger was in the same building. The Miracle Mile shops is also a huge bonus too.

Check in was easy once we got through the 30 minute wait in line.

#500

My wife and I celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary here.  What a dining experience it was!  

The complimentary gold MGM limo picking us up right in front of our place was sweet.  You must do this!  We were met by a beautiful hostess straight out of a James Bond film as we rolled up to the Mansion.  An amazing place to check out.  I guess this is what playing $25k a hand in blackjack gets you.  

We had all intentions of getting the 16 course dinner but realized there was no chance whatsoever of my very petite sized wife having even a hail mary's shot at finishing.  She might've reached course 10 at best.  

No problem!  Let's just fill up on champagne and do four courses.

There are so many extremely detailed reviews for this restaurant.  Read all of them!  I'm only going to do notes and observations:

- Is it possible to be too fancy?  This comes close. I love fine dining as much as the next fat Asian with glasses but the word "stuffy" came to mind.  Maybe my suit was too tight.  

- The man, the myth, the legend was there.  Right before our appetizers (ah-hem! Une Entree) came out I heard a "Bon Soir!" from behind me and there he was in the flesh!  Joel Robuchon!!  He shook our hands.  Joel stops by the restaurant 4 times a year according to the staff and he said we were lucky to see him.  I should've asked Mr. Robuchon to sign one of the rolls from the ridiculously amazing bread cart.

- The lobster salad with fruit was orgasmic.  

- Whoever invented foie gras should go down in history as one of the greatest people ever.

- Veal cheek kind of tasted like if a chicken thigh had sex with filet mignon.  I savored every little bite.  I believe the neighboring table shot me a look after I said this out loud to my wife.  Whatever.  More champagne please!!

- They served us an extra dessert to celebrate the occasion.  It was the white and yellow meringue fruit pie cake I took a picture of.  I forgot what they said it was called. Blame it on the ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah-alcohol.  Tremendous stuff!  We ordered 2 more dessert dishes and THEN the dessert cart came out.  Wow!!

3 hours later we were stuffed and ready for the limo to take us back.  A fantastic gourmet experience I would recommend to anyone.

3.5 Stars

Taqueria El Chino(TEC) has a 5 star rating with just four reviews.  For me it is tough to take fellow Yelper's reviews who's review count are not in double digits and dolling out 5 stars seriously.  A Yelp friend Adrixx C. recommend this place on YT so I gave it a chance and I'm glad I did.  This place is not perfect by no means.  TEC appears to be a new start-up.  If not, they are not a well oiled machine with many opportunities to improve.  TEC has a fighting chance to become a legit goto spot, but not yet.  As we walk in we are greeted by a plume of smoke, no not what you're thinking.  They smoke some of their meats but they were not using their exhaust hood above the grills nor had any doors open.  As I'm writing this review six plus hours later our clothing, car and accessories still have a strong smoke scent.  They open both the front and rear doors as we were looking at the menu.  You walk up to the counter, place your order and wait for your number to be called with your beverage in hand.  You pay after you are done which allows you to add additional items if you choose, thumbs up!  I was really impressed with TEC's menu which is easy to navigate.  It consist of two columns of vertically listed meats.  Each available meat then lists horizontally it's price for taco(corn/flour tortilla), burrito, torta or quesadilla.

My family and I only got the following tacos. Carne de Rez con Chile Verde(cubed beef in a green chili sauce), the meat was well seasoned but a bit on the tough side.  Taco de Rib Eye(carne asada), meat was very tender but only luke warm and to much fat on it for my liking.  Barbacoa de Rez(beef seasoned barbacoa style), this was the rock star of my order!  The barbacoa was executed perfectly, very flavorful and tender!  When we ordered our drinks we were told that they only had enough horchata for one order and were out of their other aquas frescas.  There were also down to one bottled orange Fanta Mexican soda(sugar cane soda taste so much better) with no Coke left, another example of inexperience.  I have a finicky eater in my group so TEC gives you your taco plain and allows you to dress it with what you want off their salsa bar.  

I hope TEC much luck and sincerely hope they hammer out the little things that may scare some return business away.  I will be back for some Barbacoa de Rez tacos and try more off the menu!  My mouth is salavating as I write this.

I had been wanting to give this place a try for sometime now. The location on Eastern is 5 star all the way, but the same vibe isn't felt at this location for me. The menu board above the register is painful to look at because it's awkwardly hanging. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu and checking on us while eating. I ordered a "Pizza Puff" combo priced at $4.50 plus 50 cents each for the addition of chili and cheese to the fries, onions were free. The pizza puff had cheese, sausage and sauce inside. It did taste ok. It reminded me of something you got for school lunch when you were younger, but in a very slightly better way. The basket of chili cheese fries is over $4 alone, so upgrading your combo with the addition of chili and cheese for just a buck makes it cheaper for the same size. The fries were good and the onions very fresh. The chili was not god though. I have had canned chili that tasted better. The basket of fries was a huge amount, but I really didn't eat but a few bites and then just couldn't eat anymore so a lot was wasted. I'd give the food here a 2 star rating alone, but I'm factoring service and cleanliness inside, so 3 stars seems fair. They do have some seating outside with umbrellas on the tables for shade. There is a bar with maybe 6-ish stools to sit at or you can sit at a table, but the tables are small (most seat 2 people) and if you get stuck sitting along the back hall area it can feel cramped. Currently on Tuesdays they offer wings for 50 cents each.

Little Darlings is an intimate chain of clubs owned by Deja Vu.  The club is 18+ as they do not serve alcohol and thus is fully nude.  Little Darlings is a little different than most clubs as it seems more personal and thus a better experience for some one on one dances.  I've found this to be the case at several Little Darlings' locations.

My most recent visit was this past 4th of July.  My party and I had some club passes and called to reserve transportation.  The limo was promised within thirty minutes and was at our hotel within the time frame.  The driver was courteous and friendly and let us know the club was busy and had about 30 girls working that night.  The passes include free cover and only require tipping the driver and buying bottomless drinks ($10).  There was a line of about ten patrons in front of us that moved painfully slow.  We waited in line a good fifteen minutes.  The staff was unorganized, uninformed, and just plain bad. They had a hard time honoring the military discount and were forced to call over a manager.  However, I didn't mind waiting, as the hostess had some big titties and I was already buzzin.

Once our IDs were checked and my military buddy got his free perks (free drinks and a $50 gift card), we made our way inside.  The club had a free BBQ buffet going, but didn't look to appealing to myself.  The club was busy and most of the seating was being occupied, yet we managed to sit by the stage.  The girls were plenty and were walking around by the second stage in front of the bar area.  The club is very relaxed and I never felt bothered by the strippers.  I was only approached one or two times for dances due to the tight seating near the main stage.  Most strippers congregate in a designated corral, which makes it easy for getting your girl.

The quality of girls was better than average and consisted of white girls, black girls, and a few Latinas.  I don't recall seeing any Asian girls, however.  Lap dances start at $20 and steadily climb from there.  If you choose a girl, which you should, I URGE you to get a BED DANCE.  The dance is no average lap dance on a couch.  Instead, you're put on to a bed that resembles a doctor's table and for lack of better words, you're dry fucked non stop with YMMV depending on the girl.  The bed dance is unique to Las Vegas and is nothing that I've experienced in San Francisco, Los Angeles or San Diego.  If you do anything, I strongly recommend getting a bed dance.  Little Darlings is a gem and definitely worth a visit. My only complaints is the unorganized staff and the slow security screening, which included a metal detector.

Little Darlings Pricing Structure:

Cover:  Varies (Free to $30)
Locals and tourist: $20 plus $10 for unlimited drinks, utilize club passes.

Lap Dances:
Bed Dances & Private Dances (Topless & Nude): $20+

$20 is the cost for one lap dance, however your mileage may vary per girl, pay more get more is the formula.

VIP Dance:  $100+

VIP Section: $100+ Minimum

Had an interesting breakfast today, since my Shanghai Boofay lunch was so early.  
MikeC, NormR, RandH, DarenC, and I met up at the place which has recently opened in the carcass of the former original location of China Star Boofay, in the carcass of a former Red Lobster, near 43rd Ave and Bell Rd in North Phoenix.
So since there will soon be several thorough reviews from notable Yelpilluminati, I will stick to those areas that are uniquely mine:

Greasy~Crispy Spectrum:
.-. 4 stars .-.  nothing was too soggy at all, and there was a crispy outside on very many dishes.  Bonus that the terryaki chicken appeared not to have been deep fried but perhaps baked.

Discard Pile:
.-. 4 stars .-.  i had very little to cut off or spit out (thinking even of the short ribs) and most dishes actually had absolutely zero Discard Pile.  Notable were both the honey and orange chicken, and a nice crisped-up outside on the wontons.

McKenna Novelty Factor:
.-. 5 stars .-. (here's another category, newly named, for how i judge a boofay, whether it's got the 'same old same old' or it has unique items that you can't get just anywhere)  Shanghai had several items that were pretty novel.  Scoop-it-yer-damn-self Thrifty ice cream in about 8 different flavors.  Sushi bar that included seaweed salad and other acoutrements.  Also of note was what Norm said was called a Dessert Soup, which had a yellowish syrupy looking liquid with a small amount of blanched peanuts and red grapes floating in it, along with what at first apeared to be bits of tripe, like in menudo! Norm later figured out that it was ceylon agar (just think of it as vegan gelatin - it's from seaweed!), and with the server's help, that the small round fruits that looked like small apricots or orange lychee, were in fact a chinese fruit called loquat, we supposed related to the cumquat, every gradeschool boy's favorite thing to call someone as a name, since it's a real fuit and how can you get in trouble for that?

RyanC-isms:
.-. 3 stars .-.  A few personal favorites were missing, such as bean sprouts and a General tsao-type chicken (the spicy chicken they had wasn't spicy at all, and was mostly jalapeno flavored).  I also wish I could have put some chocolate syrup on my ice cream.  The lone bowl of rainbow sprinkles made me wish for more of a sundae bar, although MikeC seemed to be doing very nicely with the cone(s)!
  $7-something for lunch is just allright since it doesn't include the drink.   The decor is comfortable and clean.  The service was excellent, with plates cleared quickly, and friendliness all around.   The nice ladies found answers to our questions and even took our picture, too!

We walked in here without a reservation on a Saturday night and ate at the bar.  I am super late on the Honey Salt bandwagon.  So much so that I might as well be writing a review on this cool new show called "Breaking Bad".  I mean, the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich has similar qualities to meth...so I've heard anyways.  

The creamless corn soup intrigued my wife the most and she loved it.  The charred kernels and arugula oil was kind of a shock at initial taste but it grew on her quickly and she already plans to order it the next time we're there.  

I got "My Wife's Favorite Salad" consisting of duck confit, arugula, frise, pine nuts, roasted bing cherries, and a farm fresh poached egg.  This was terrific and I only wished there was even more duck but I am sure everyone feels that way.  I thought the mix of flavors were really good.  

We split the Colorado Lamb porterhouse for the entree.  It came with bacon sofrito, pea tendrils, roasted fingerling potatoes, and balsamic reduction.  I'd never had lamb prepared this way and thought it was quite creative.  The lamb was a little more done than I wanted it to be but it was still juicy.  Like all good porterhouses, I found myself gnawing on the bone with my bare hands at the end.  

Our super friendly (and fellow Red Sox fan from Andover, MA) bartender lightly twisted our arm into getting "The Brookie" for dessert which the menu describes "chocolate chip cookie meets chocolate fudge brownie, with vanilla bean ice cream".  You should definitely try this if you like but are really tired of chocolate lava cake.  I feel so jaded typing that last sentence.  

Overall it was great.  What's not to like about this spot?

When I use to work in London, I always looked forward to having a pint at the end of the day with my friends. 

Besides their incredible food, Cornish Pasty has the feel that reminds me very much of an English pub. The food is the real star here, but the beers they have on tap are outstanding. 

One of my favorite, is the north London brewer Fuller's Extra Special Bitter(ESB). It's fresh, tasty and took me back to the City pubs of my youth. Granted the beer back then was warmer. LOL

As we sat waiting for our server, you could see everyone was happy to be here. We sat near the bar, to the right of where the cooks are preparing the meals. Pretty soon all those dozen or so bar stools were taken. There was a lot of laughing. Folks being happy at the end of the work week and enjoying each others company. What a great atmosphere!

We started with the 20 oz/ pint of the Fuller's ($6.00) that I mentioned (photo) and glass of the Leitz Out ($6.50) Riesling. Both hit the spot nicely. 

For dinner we ordered the Bangers and Mash pasty, along with the Rosemary Chicken pasty and shared some English Oven garlic chips ($3.50). I believe the chicken might have been the better of the two pasty, but not by much!

Both, had a sophisticate layering of flavors, that were subtle and very nice.  In the hands of a different Chef, you could see how the flavors might have overwhelm the palette. But not here. Surprising they were only $9.00 each. Incredible. 

For dessert, we shared the Chocolate Bread Pudding ($6.00) and the Apple Carmel Pasty ($5.00). Both were also delicious. 

Each of the above items were very filling. We couldn't finish them, or the desserts. So we had four "to go" boxes for later. I've posted several pictures and we really had a fun time.  Our bill came to a fair $49.07 including taxes, but before gratuities. 

We'll be back. Enjoy!

The Barrymore...

What can I possible say about The Barrymore that hasn't been stated in a review already? 

Yes, it's off the strip and attached to the Royal Resort
Yes, it's small and intimate.
Yes, they have good steaks and lobster mac.
And Yes, The Barrymore is a great place to take a date or celebrate a special evening. 

My girlfriend and I chose The Barrymore to celebrate our one year together. We wanted to go somewhere that was good, intimate enough for some quality time, and a place that we haven't been to.  The Barrymore fit just right.  We had reservations, which really wasn't needed since we were the only ones here when we started our dinner.  Our server was fantastic.  Our server made it a point to give full descriptions of everything on their menu, especially their steaks. He even brought out a raw steak just to show us the size of it before it was cooked. I had my eye on their Filet Mignon since I learned about the Barrymore, but ended up with their bone-in-filet.  My dish was pretty good. I'm not saying it was the best steak I've had, but it definitely wasn't the worse. It was still tasty, tender, and my portion was huge. I only regret that I didn't stick with the filet mignon, which in my opinion, tends to have more flavor.  Regardless, I was still satisfied with my meal. My girlfriend was satisfied with her meal as well, but thought that their lobster mac was missing something. We just couldn't figure out what.  

Overall, I would suggest The Barrymore to anyone looking for an intimate dinner, a good steak, and great service. 

PS:  Can't forget about their bread basket.  One word....delicious!!

If you've ever gyros hopped before, you know that not all gyros are created equal, and until today; if asked, I would have told you my favorite gyros is at Cypress Grill. I am happy to report, opinion changed!

I've had this spot bookmarked for quite a while now, the trouble is that I spoiled myself by moving a mile away from where I work; I've got dining, shopping, and work all within 5 minutes. There's 4 froyo shops, 5 gyros spots, 6 grocery stores, countless dining, dive bars, comedy clubs, open mics, music and more. Travelling outside of my acceptable radius is quite the big deal. There's usually some type of planning, engagement, or craving involved that just can't happen inside my bubble. 

I recently was in the Tempe area and decided to strike while the iron is hot. If you visit expecting the usual quick serve, show up, eat, and leave setting - you're only partly right, but Haji-Baba is so much more. Haji is a Middle East / Mediterranean market - who also makes one heck of a gyros, and I'm happy to stamp my opinion of "Personal Favorite - thus far" on it. 

I ordered up a Gyros DLX - sans tomato. This thing comes falling out the pita with a generous portion of gyros, lettuce, onion, tomato, tatziki, feta cheese and all wrapped up with a hand made pita. Best yet, it's under five bucks! - if you're not into the hand made pita or fresh of the block feta cheese, it's younger brother "Gyros" comes with the same delicious lamb and beef gyros for about $3.69.

Though, why stop at just the gyros? This place is flushed with great imported foods and fresh made desserts to order up from their market. Shop through aisles of items like spices, sauces, pickled beets, harissa (spicy pepper sauce), cookies, and so much more. Check in their glass case for fresh made pastires, olives, and feta cheese. On a whim I tried out one of their harissas and haven't looked back since. Now I'm blending up my favorite spicy pepper hummus with jalepeno, garlic, and harissa week after week. - message me if you want the recipe; it's awesome, I promise ;-)

Happy Yelping Phoenix - break outside your bubble once in a while and you'll be surprised at what you can find!

I heard so much about this place that after dinner at Japanese Curry Zen in the same strip mall (Seoul Plaza), we stopped by Sweets Raku.  SR is located West of the 15 on Spring Mountain Rd.

As the name indicates, SR specializes in desserts.  However, they do have savory items on the menu like foie gras torchon ($18) & caviar ($30).  We shared the three course Prix Fixe that comes w/ an amuse (mango gelato), your choice of one of the desserts of the day:  We chose the baton (chocolate rolled dough) filled w/ pistachio & chocolate mousse, and a cream puff filled w/ chocolate cream.  The price is normally $17, but because we shared it was $24 (O_o).  In addition, we ordered 5 macarons for $9 to go.  The meal starts whimsically, because the menu is edible and they give you a raspberry sauce to dip it in.  Unfortunately, the menu reminded me of a communion wafer, and was apros pos for the remainder of the prix fixe.

The amuse tasted good:  The mango flavor really stood out.  But it wasn't worth the average of $8 for the 3 course prix fixe:  2 Stars.  On the other hand, the second course tasted very good (especially the baton).  The baton had several layers and the fillings were very flavorful:  4 Stars.  Lastly, the third course was pretty bad.  There wasn't much too it, and the portion was tiny for the $8 average price:  2 Stars.

BTW, we tried the macarons the next day, and they were OK.  They were not as good as Bottega Louie's, and definitely not better than Bouchon's:  3 Stars.

Our waitress Yuta was super nice.  However, the courses came out very slowly.  Additionally, we noticed several guests were turned away because of a wait vs putting them on a waiting list and asking them to return:  3 Stars.  The ambiance is pretty cool.  There is an interesting spoon out front, there are tins of tea on the wall, and wine bottles in a dope display case.  However, this place is very cramped.  Its best to sit at the bar to see your creations being made:  3 Stars.

IMHO, this place is overhyped and appeals primarily to females - Including my yf Dani S.  But she didn't notice me cos she was on a date.  In any case, my date looked better than her, so Dani would have been mad!  - LOL!!!  In reality, there was only two guys on a Sat nite, and the place was packed).  Nonetheless, I won't be coming back.  I am not sure what raku means, but they are running a "rakut" here w/ the high prices for mediocre food.  I would have rated this place Two Stars if the service wasn't good.

Stopped by on Thursday to celebrate National Nacho Day after seeing Marc M.'s post and what a treat!  I had originally planned on going to another place down the street but I had Julia's bookmarked for a while so why not try something new?

Situated in what was once a Target's parking lot, this small and unassuming restaurant was quite an adventure.  Upon walking in, there's a distinct smell of mesquite.  Whether it's artificial or just for show, who cares?  It smells great.  There's a generous bar of all sorts of grilled meats, fixings, and salsa.  The menu is kind of confusing but I already had made myself a note before to try their soft tacos.  The best day to get tacos are Tuesdays, mind you, when they're $1.50 each.  Mr. W. had the Crazy Thursday special which is a green-sauced enchilada if I remember right and we also had nachos. 

At first I wasn't sure what to expect.  The lovely lady had made the enchiladas first.  First warming up the tortillas and then filling it with cheese before sprinkling more cheese on top only to be be put into the microwave.  That had us exchanging a side-glance at each other.  But when I saw her making my little street tacos and stuffing it full of marinated chicken and topping it with pico de gallo and other stuff, I had forgiven her for the microwave business. Then she had started pouring ladles full of cheez whiz onto the nachos.  I just wanted to tuck in.  Our meal was $23 for the both of us so my wallet was happy.

So how did everything taste?  Delicious!  The carne asada on the nachos and my marinate chicken in the tacos were both delicious, flavorful, and moist.  The portions are decent for the price and the salsa bar was a mini adventure on its own.  I wanted to try them all but I was scared and unsure on which ones were mild and which ones were a blazing inferno.  I wish there were little signs.  Oh well.  

Nonetheless, Julia's served up a decent dinner and I wouldn't hesitate to stop by again.  I think I want to try a burrito or a taco salad next time!

Pizzeria Bianco isn't just a restaurant, it's an institution.  Ever since I moved to the Valley of the Sun five years ago, I've watched peoples' eyes glaze over as they ramble on and on about how amazing the food is there; many argue that it serves up the best pizza in Phoenix (if not the country).  Why it took me so long to get there is a mystery but after going today, I can unequivocally say that the rumors are all true - it is fabulous!

LOGISTICS: Nestled in the Southeast corner of Heritage Square near the Arizona Science Center, Pizzeria Bianco sits in a rather small brick building with an outdoor patio and charming little bar.  While the space restriction makes for a more intimate dining experience, I could easily see this place becoming swarmed with diners during peak hours; so perhaps coming before or after the main lunch/dinner rush would be a good idea for those who are patience-challenged or in a time crunch.  Park in the structure off of 5th and Monroe - the restaurant validates your ticket (I ended up paying $0 instead of the usual $12).  

FOOD: Wow!  Just wow!  I ordered the Market Salad, which consisted of fresh local cantaloupe and honeydew melon, cucumbers, mint, red onions, and peppers served in a yogurt dressing; it was hands-down one of the most creative and refreshing salads I've ever had!  They serve their sodas in old fashioned glass bottles and bring freshly-baked bread with olive oil to your table - haven't had olive oil that good in ages!  If you can't decide on one pizza combo, they're great about doing halfsies.  I ordered a half Margherita, half Rosa (red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, and Arizona pistachios) pizza - both were sheer perfection!  Crust is heavenly, ingredients are beyond fresh, innovative toppings - who'dve thunk pistachios would taste so good on a pizza?!      

SERVICE: Pizzeria Bianco runs like a well-oiled machine.  The service staff is amazing - both friendly and fast.  They greet every single guest who comes and goes - pretty impressive! 

I don't really think you can go wrong here.  I came in skeptical but left a believer; somehow they worked their magic over on me - another happy Pizzeria Bianco customer.  A thousand flies can't be wrong!  ;)

Finally got a chance to visit the Pasty.  First, it is in a hard to find location if you aren't familiar with the hidden restaurants inside commercial center off of Sahara. Situated right next to Komol, the restaurant does indeed have the feel of a pub with the center of attention the beautiful bar.  I came here for lunch and there were about 3 tables full and 3 people at the bar and one waitperson to handle all of us.  As a result, it appeared she was the proverbial chicken with her head cut off, often scurrying past me several times before taking my order, bringing my check, etc.  I have to hand it to her though, she managed to keep my tea filled and was friendly! She had excellent knowledge of the menu and the popular items.

Word of caution: if you only have an hour lunch and it takes 15 minutes each way, don't come here unless you order ahead, this place is not quick, and that is probably because the pastry shell needs time to cook.  I watched them prep my meat and cheese pasty and it takes time.  The pasty is filled with large chunks of what reminded me of square meatballs and a cheddary cheese.  I have to say, I was expecting to be disappointed and not have much filling inside like so many calzones and empanadas I have tried.  Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised as my pasty came filled to the brim and I killed 3 days of dieting in one meal.  The red wine gravy was excellent!

All in all, the unique offerings here coupled with the extensive pub brew list (including strongbow cider) puts this restaurant on my regular rotation.

Sure there are some bugs to work out with the service (A customer at the bar said yesterday they had 6 waitpeople) and if you don't want pasty, your choices are limited to salads and appetizers, but Cornish Pasty Co. is a welcome addition to the area.

Ok, as you are reading this, there is Hawaiian music playing in the background.

Now picture yourself at a luau on a beach in Hawaii. Hula dancers shaking their hips. Dudes spinning their fire pole thingy. Ha ha, that's a nice visual. Anyways, all you did was walk into a Braddah's Island Style restaurant. Ok, you can stop the music now. Actually when you go there they really do play Hawaiian music. 

When you come here, your options are simple with 5 easy steps. 

STEP 1. You pick whether you want a Burrito (flour or wheat tortilla), Bowl (bed of seaweed rice), Salad (bed of romaine lettuce), 3 Tacos (soft flour or crispy corn). 

STEP 2. Pick your meats. Huli Huli Chicken, Kalua Pig, Pulehu Steak, Grilled Fish, or just Grilled Veggies. 

STEP 3. Pick your toppings. Seaweed Rice, Black Beans, Shredded Cabbage, Romaine Lettuce, and Grilled Veggies (for a charge).

STEP 4. Pick your salsa. Charred Pineapple Verde (mild), Mango and Roasted Corn (medium), Tomato with grilled Maui Onion (spicy).

STEP 5. Pick even more toppings. Sour Cream, Cheese, Lettuce, Jalapenos, Cabbage, Lime, and Guacomole (for an extra charge).

Of course you can put any or all of the toppings on to your entre selection. I can also describe how all this tastes, but that just wont do it justice. You need to come here and sample their product, which they will happily give to you.

Last but not least, finish it off with Coconut Bark. A salty and sweet concoction that will make your sweet tooth want to jump out of your mouth and make a residence here. This is their only dessert option but honestly, that's all you need.

Chris, the owner who was just behind the counter helping make orders, was also walking around bussing tables and talking to every customer that was there making sure everything was ok. When he came up to me, I had all sorts of questions for him and to my surprise, he answered every one of them sincerely. Things like more promotional menu items like Shrimp and Kalbi Ribs for starters. I was impressed by his honest response to any and all criticism that I had. That's the type of owner I like. One who listens to their customers and takes things to heart. Now if this is how the owner acts, I can only assume all his employees will have the same positive attitude.

Some random info. At the time of this review there is a 20 dollar for 10 Groupon so take full advantage. They have free wifi and the code is on the wall above you when you come in. On Sundays, if you come wearing sandals or flip flops, you get free chips and salsa with your order. They take cards. Their dining room is spacious and equipped with napkins and some kind of good tasting Hawaiin sauce. They have two separate solo bathrooms for men and women.  And lastly, they have a drive thru!

So a big mahalo to Chris and his staff. You just got yourself a customer for life!

I have been hearing about this place for a long time. The problem with this "impulse" visit since we were in Town Square was not reading the Yelp reviews beforehand. They seemed to range from 1 star...those who came for the food to 4/5 stars...those interested in the alcohol.
This spot (which used to be the Meatball Spot and prior hookah lounge) has been plagued with restaurant failures. I was hoping that a known strip brand would finally break that cycle, but it sadly did not. 
My daughter pointed out that most of the wait staff are "good looking", which seems to trump decent service. Albeit a very nice staff, no one seemed to have any real service industry substance. I asked our server about menu items and popularity and got a generic response. My order came out wrong the first time and small things like a side of ranch dressing with our fries were quickly forgotten items.
I ordered what was the most disgusting thing I've eaten in a long time. The chicken caesar crepe looked promising but left me feeling nauseous, even as I write this review. It is presented as a crepe filled with a thick alfredo-like sauce with pieces of chicken served alongside a creamy caesar salad...with chicken. Why? I don't know. I only took a couple bites and it took every ounce of willpower not to gag.
My daughter and wife both had the buffalo chicken sandwich. My wife enjoyed it, but my daughter said it was too tangy for her taste. An unfortunate dining experience when the best part was the fries.
We saw most of the patrons enjoying a large smoking alcoholic beverage...what this place is known for. It's Sugar should just remove food from their agenda altogether and only serve drinks.
Our bill came to $55 for 2 chicken sandwiches and 1 gross crepe. Sigh, really hate being disappointed in food and ripped off when dining out. I don't like the fact they will be opening up a location at the Galleria Mall because there are so many other worthy establishments. NEXT!!!

On the five-hour drive home, all I could do was talk Mr. W.'s ear off about how young and fresh [just like I like my men?] those crawfish were!  By far my most favorite place for crawfish, hands down.

Mr. W. was the one who had originally wanted to try out The Boiling Crab.  We've all heard how big they are in California and being that Arizona has HnJ and AC, BC was a temptress.  My friend had said it was oily like AC so I was really put off with that notion.  Ignoring her warning, we went to BC and it turned out to be my second favorite meal in Vegas for our trip!

Those crawfish were fresh!  The lungs were still white and not awkwardly grey or muddy; the head-fat wasn't bitter, black, or goopy but perfectly colored and sweet [head-fat that holds together in one sweet piece is an A+ in my book]; and the tail was so easy to break apart.  Chipping your nails trying to wrestle a tiny piece of tail-meat always leaves me salty so this makes me very happy.  The whole sha-bang sauce is pretty decent with chunks of garlic, not too spicy [this is where HnJ might have a *slight* advantage... their sauce is more broth-like] and not as oily as my friend made it out to be.  I enjoyed my every bit of my 2lbs. of crawfish and I will admit that I probably could have taken down another pound!  We also shared 1lb of lemon pepper shrimp, six raw oysters [plump, briny, and delicious] with lip-smacking spicy cocktail sauce [I liked to dip my crawfish meat in it every now and then], and a cup of gumbo [I recommend getting it with more sausage and shrimp].  Mr. W. had his heart set on the chowder but they sadly ran out.  Oh well.  Only means we have to stop by again!  I washed all this down with a sweet green tea and it was a great dinner in Sin City!

This restaurant is huge so a wait time was never an issue for us even at 6:00PM.  I love how sweet and attentive the wait staff is!  Pitchers of limes dumped onto the table?  Yes please!  I also like how they tie the bibs on you.  Ain't nobody got time for that in Arizona!  ;)  I'll be daydream of slurping the juice out of the head before ripping it apart for some head-fat!

It's been a while since I've been so inspired by a restaurant that I felt it necessary to write a review immediately after returning from my first visit. As you can see by all the glowing reviews so far, the Buddha Belly Deli is well on it's way to becoming a success story. I foresee this restaurant as having the uniqueness necessary to become one of the places that tourists come to for an "off the strip" experience. I also predict it to climb the charts in the Yelp list of top restaurants in Vegas/Henderson amongst the likes of The Sparklings and Soho Japanese. I was one of the first few customers of those restaurants when they were new and it's clear to me that Buddha Belly Deli has that certain "je ne sais quoi" that those other restaurants did. So mark my words here. This restaurant is definitely a keeper and if you haven't been here yet, you should definitely cross it off your to-do list. Get to it!

Enough about me singing Buddha's praises, let's talk about the food. I tried the top three items that all the trailblazer yelpers before me recommended and I was a fan of all three of them.

I started with the Thai Clam Chowder. Such an ingenious idea to merge an American classic with Tom Kha soup. Good stuff!

Then I moved on to the "Pho Dip" which is a Vietnamese spin on the classic French Dip sandwich. The dipping broth is pho soup. The sandwich consists of a soft & squishy fresh French bread, perfect for absorbing that yummy pho like a sponge. The inside is filled with slices of rare beef, jalapeos, onion and bean sprouts. A definite must try.

Last but not least I had the Szechuan Shrimp Po-boy... Crispy shrimp, spicy Szechuan mayo & shredded lettuce sandwiched between a sliced baguette. It wasn't spicy enough for me so I think next time I'm going to try out the homemade spicy sauce that Nate was raving about and kick my sandwich up a notch.

Then there were the little touches, like the container of forks being labeled "Fork You" and the knives were labeled something else equally clever but I can't remember for the life of me. My point though is that it's obvious the owner thought of something creative right down to the last little minute detail... A detail that was not lost on me. Totally my style of the way I would do things if I had a restaurant. Now I must know what every single thing is labeled so I need to come back and see. Inquiring minds wanna know! Great conversation piece for guests.

I'm already plotting and planning my next visit. I can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu. Another patron was recommending their Sloppy Joe to me and said it's so good that it brings tears to his eyes. This is an awesome new addition to the community and it's right next door to a really good nail salon, not that you need any further incentive to visit but I'm just saying...

Whoahhhh!!! Now this is what i call a throw down!

Of course, i'm referencing Bobby Flay's inventive cuisine at his southwestern themed restaurant in Caesar's palace, Las Vegas.   

It was our first night and after winning a grip of change form the slots at Caesar's, my friend suggested eating at Mesa Grill for din din.  I wasn't too familiar with the restaurant but when I realized it was Bobby Flay's joint, my interest was certainly piqued.  

Truth be told, i'm not a Flay fanatic by an stretch, but a little star power never hurt anyone IMO.  With that said, there's always the pressing issue of hype over substance which in turn had me proceeding with cautious optimism.  

As we made our way across the bustling casino and stepped into the restaurant, I definitely felt the warmth of the contemporary Latin theme throughout the communal dining space, which was flanked with rich reds and soft golden hues. 

Within moments, the hostess greeted us and proceeded to lead us to our seats.  Our server wasted no time in taking our orders, as well.

In record time, we got our beautifully plated appetizers and entrees. 
Let's just say my doubts melted away with my very first bite! Wow, this food had big, bold flavor and the quality was incredible! 

Here's a rundown of what we had:

Shrimp tamale - Plump, juicy and mouthwatering gulf shrimp in a fresh corn meal that was both rich & flavorful. Outstanding! 

Tuna nachos - Fresh chunks of seasoned ruby red tuna in a sweet & tangy sauce that had a pleasant citrusy finish. The crisp corn tortilla added a nice contrast in texture to this refreshingly vibrant dish! Lip smacking goodness in every bite!

Pork tenderloin - This dish was absolutely phenomenal!!! The meat was like a perfectly cooked filet! It was soft, buttery and rich. Perfectly decadent and oh so flavorful! Honestly, the meat was so tender, i kept asking my friends "Are you sure this is pork?" 

Spice Filet - Buttery, tender and succulent beef filet with a pleasant kick from the house spices! Scrumptious!

Lamb chops - Beautiful crust and perfectly pink inside. Boasting a magnificent charbroiled flavor that was absolutely addicting! Seconds please!

Corn - Fresh cuts of corm kernels with explosive flavor and fantastic texture. This is a side you don't wanna miss!

After consuming all that delicious food, we simply had no additional room for dessert. Besides, wehad our minds set on some chocolate decadence at Max Brenner's afterwards (review forthcoming)

Overall, service was attentive, friendly and fast. The food, of course, was incredible and most importantly, it didn't break the bank either!

Why? Because this birthday boy didn't have to pay...lol

Happy Eats!

Vegas. Two girls. Hungover. We had a long drive ahead but needed time to collect ourselves. In our dysfunctional state of mind, we decided we wanted brunch.

Off to Egg & I we went. The place turned out to be a local favorite. It was fairly packed, but we got seated right away. Extensive breakfast menu. Options! And loved how it was printed on newspaper! 

Chicken Omelet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=5jiBgyVg3dAhbE4X129pOw): I can't remember its name, but I do remember that it was absolutely tasty! Chicken, cheese, avocado with sour cream on top. Moist chicken. Fluffy omelet. Yum! 

Ranch Potatoes: Came with omelet. Addicting! Even though they were overly seasoned for my taste buds, I couldn't stop eating them.

Banana Nut Muffin (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=6JXT3ryRPelUwv5grDI67A): Came with omelet. Gigantic homemade muffin. Chewy top. Soft inside with bits of banana and nuts. So good!

Eggs Florentine (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=YvTvI5skrvIBBFC4W7TUVg): I didn't try it. But judging by its looks, I would imagine it to be delicious!

Coffee: Great quality coffee. It was unlimited refill and I had the whole carafe to myself. They have their own line of coffee. 

Huge portions!  We both packed half of our food to go. Great service! Friendly and attentive. And best of all, great prices! 2 breakfast entrees, 1 orange juice, 1 coffee, plus tax and tips all for $30! =D

With the exception of a check-in snafu caused by the very "green" & inexperieced hostess, I'd have to say I had a pretty good experience at the tea lounge at the Mandarin Oriental.  I just have one point of advice, check your reservation with the hostess at least three times. By then, it may sink in for her.

Ok, let's carry on shall we?

Located adjacent to registration above the 23rd floor, you'd think the Tea Lounge was part of the lobby. But make no mistake, these premium seats come at a lofty price tag and a reservation to boot.  

Luckily, we were seated by the panoramic window as I requested and service, albeit a bit slow, was paced nicely and lent to the whole relaxing afternoon tea experience.  With that in mind, the tea selection was fairly limited but adequate for my needs. There were a host of green teas and herbal teas to accommodate most individual preferences and tastes IMO. Since I just arrived from a massage session, I went with the introspective herbal relaxation tea. The tea service runs from 2-5 pm daily and reservations are highly recommended as there are only a few tables in the lounge.  The views can be quite spectacular if you're seated by the window. We had a perfect view of the strip and City Center and the natural lighting was equally relaxing and calming.  

The food selections included a selection of finger sandwiches inspired by English afternoon "high tea" traditions, but where was the cucumber cream cheese?
In any case, the selections included a savory smoked salmon cucumber and watercress spread sandwich (my favorite of the bunch) egg salad & chives on brioche, curried chicken salad, and black forest ham. The tea service also included the best scones I've ever had in my life! These were buttery, light, flaky and irresistibly good. They came out nice and warm, served with some fresh berry jam, marmalade and an imported Devonshire clotted cream (extremely smooth and very addictive.) So addictive, in fact,  I found myself wanting to spread it on practically everything!  
Lastly, our afternoon tea service was completed with a selection of small bite sized desserts and pastries, which included macarons, tarts and chocolates.

By the end of the meal, I felt nicely sated and totally relaxed. I would definitely return on my next trip to Vegas but im going to have to put that hostess on check!

Happy Eats!

Saturday night, no reservation, my choice was to wait 45 minutes for a table or take a table in the bar.  I opted for the bar.  I should have waited or went somewhere else.

I had eaten at Roy's in Philadelphia, which was an awesome experience.  I expected that same in Scottsdale.  Didn't happen.

I started out with my favorite drink, an Original Hawaiian Martini.  They are not cheap with the alcohol in the drink, it's very potent.  For dinner, I opted for choices on the Prix Fix menu.  My starter was a Hawaiian Crunch Winter roll.  It was great, made with shrimp tempura and avocado.  For my entree, I selected the Panang-style tiger shrimp with vegetable coconut curry and jasmine rice.  Very good combination of flavors, but could have been served a little warmer.  Dessert was the always awesome "Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle".  This dessert is always to die for.  It's the best  dessert I have ever had anywhere!!

Other than the slightly cold entree, the thing that amazed me about this restaurant was the fact that the staff didn't intercede when a nearby customer managed to annoy me all evening long.  This guy was in the restaurant bar, supposedly waiting for his brother.  Well, I was there for over an hour and the brother never showed up.  Go figure.  But, in the meantime, this guy managed to annoy me, tell me strange stories, sit at my table (until I asked him to leave), go back to this table, remove papers from his bag, bring them back to my table and spread them out, (until I asked him to leave again), used my cell phone to call his brother, mother, sister, god knows who else.  But at least while he was on my cell phone, he wasn't bothering me.  He even begged me for a ride and helped himself to some of my food.  You get the picture.  I can not believe that the staff allowed this to happen.  It's outrageous.  Other customers noticed, I guess I should have demanded to speak to a manager to have situation resolved, but I didn't want to make a scene.  I couldn't believe it was happening or that is was allowed to happen!!!  I even had to sneak out a side door when this nut wasn't looking, so he wouldn't follow me.  Completely nuts.  I think a restaurant of this caliber has an obligation to protect it's customers.

Straight out of Cali and family owned. This location was originally built to be a Dunkin' Donuts, but DD never opened. I'm glad Tom's swooped in! You will find a variety of options on the menu here from burgers, tacos, burritos, sandwiches, bacon & eggs, pancakes, steak, pork chops,  fish & chips, salads, smoothies, and Mediterranean & Greek options, and believe it or not much more! They have some pretty good all day specials if you like breakfast.  Seniors 55+ get a free cup of coffee with any breakfast or lunch purchase.

Hubby and I decided to split the "Pastrami Sandwich Combo" priced at $9.59 plus 40 cents for cheese. The combo came with fries and a drink. I also wanted to try the "Zucchini" priced at $3.99 and it came with a side of ranch. The pastrami sandwich was SO good. The bread held up the sandwich well and the mustard and pickles were just right. I know this is something that I will for sure be back for. Good pastrami in Vegas is hard to come by. The fries were excellent. I wasn't actually crazy about the zucchini. The ranch that it came with was a decent size though. They make the onion rings and zucchini from scratch. I want to try the onion rings next time, but will pass on the zucchini again. 

They have a drive-thru if you don't want to eat inside. The burgers are made fresh to order and the steak and chicken is hand trimmed on site. There are a lot of things I want to try here at Tom's so I will be back!

Delhi Indian Cuisine has been on my radar for quite some time. I've seen the high reviews and wanted to check this place out. I'm so glad that I did because the food here rocks! (my socks).

The lunch buffet starts at 11:00am and goes until 3:00pm. It is one of the better priced Indian buffets in town at 9.99. I came in and ordered the lunch buffet. The dining room is very clean and spacious. There is a large buffet area which is loaded with tons of food.

The yelp check in offer was for either a soda or one of their house made lassi's, basically, a yogurt smoothie. They have a sweet one, a salty one, and a mango one. I ordered the mango. It was SOOO good. The flavor was very mango-ey and it was silky smooth and had a nice mouthfeel from the yogurt.

As for the food, I would recommend anything! I especially liked their chicken, all of their versions of them were super tender. The goat stew was especially tasty as well. It wasn't too gamey and the sauce on it was fabulous! There wasn't anything on the menu that I didn't like.

One thing that I thought was kinda weak was their garlic naan. I found the taste to be a little bit bland. And for their noodle, milk dessert was a little bit too sweet.

Service was also kinda questionable. They seemed to start out pretty slow with taking our orders and getting our drinks, and after our first round of dishes they didn't clear our plates fast enough so that we were stacking our plates on top of each other. But, they were quicker at bussing our table during the middle of our dining experience.

Would I come back? Oh, you know it, because I loves me some Indian food. And the food here is delicious, fresh, and tasty. And try the mango lassi, it's really good.

This place is just okay. It's not horrible, but it's not that great either.

Located inside the Hard Rock, we came here for mid-week lunch during a recent visit. It wasn't very crowded, so we were able to get seated right away.

The chips and salsa were good. They were warm and not too greasy. I enjoyed their salsa. It was a pico with a medium spice. Suitable for any tolerance level.

For my main course I went with the lobster tacos. I think this should just be called lobster with some tortillas. I was expecting actual tacos, but instead I got a lobster tail with beans and rice. The tail itself was a pretty good portion, but there was little flavor to anything else. I did like the fluffiness of their house made tortillas, but again, not worth the $18 price tag and I was still hungry afterwards.

Everyone seemed to enjoy their enchilada dishes, maybe I should have gone that route. But even from looking at them, I don't think they were worth the $12-$15 price tags.

Service was good. We had someone filling up our drinks and checking in on us constantly. Unfortunately, there are a lot of other restaurants in the area that I think are better and worth the money, so I probably wont be back.

This past January marked a year my wife stopped smoking cigarettes.  So imagine my surprise when the one thing she wanted to do to mark the occasion was to...smoke hookah??  I personally hadn't done that in well over 6+ years.  28 reviews and counting with consistent 5 star reviews lead us to Layla.

Although it's a small place that can cater to maybe 6 groups total, it's like a really cool guy's basement.  That really cool guy happens to also be named Guy.  He recognized my wife and I instantly since we lived in the same apartment complex a couple of years ago and had neighboring parking spots.  Throughout our visit, Guy was super friendly, attentive and made us feel very welcome.  The big leather couches you sit on INSIST that you stay a while.       

We were informed that all their food was homemade so trying the falafel and hummus appetizer was an absolute must for me.  Their falafel rivals any other joint as the best in LV, crunchy outside and flavorful green inside.  I could tell right away that the hummus was homemade.  It tasted more like a super thick tahini sauce than your average hummus but I thought it accompanied the falafel really well.  I'll be sure to get it again.  We also got an order of stuffed grape leaves and a nice basket of freshly toasted pita.  Guy also hooked us up with a couple of pieces of baklava which made for a nice ending to the meal.

Hookah time.  Lots of choices and my wife chose their "pina colada" which was fine and tasted as advertised.  3 bricks would have been enough for 4-6 people to smoke let alone two.

Count on me as a repeat customer!  At the very least I'll order their great Middle Eastern food to go since they're open so late or we'll lounge out the next time my wife has "the itch".

Heard about this place on Yelp Talk and decided to try it out for myself....I'm glad I did.  This place is freakin' awesome!  It reminds me of the authentic Mexican food in So Cal.  The restaurant is located inside a Mexican market on the left side.  It was 6:30 on a Sunday evening and the line at the counter was 10 deep!  I hate lines, but stayed anyway....it was worth every minute.

I decided to order:
Carne Asada Burrito, $5.49
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DXn79Dzv8kpsMcNNKZHuRA?select=cC2AUIg0rdvATqfOiePgbQ
Al Pastor Taco, $1.49
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DXn79Dzv8kpsMcNNKZHuRA?select=nZxeRphGx4OJhhXSk9qqnQ

The Carne Asada Burrito was awesome....the flavor of the Steak was as I remember it from back home.  The flavor of the other ingredients....Beans, Rice, Onions, Salsa, Cilantro.....was very good and proportioned correctly.  I was left wanting more, much more!  Glad I ordered the Taco Al Pastor....
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DXn79Dzv8kpsMcNNKZHuRA?select=gU0RY6b3sYgJoUplxVgn9A

The Taco Al Pastor was topped with a pile of Salsa, Cilantro, and fresh cut Onions....I took one bite and couldn't believe how good it was.  When I was growing up, my friends' family would cook these Tacos for special occasions like baptisms and Sunday BBQ's in the park.  This gem of a Taco hit the spot....full of flavor and fresh ingredients.

The one complaint I have is that the Salsa Bar didn't have anything that was remotely spicy....which surprised me.  The Salsa was your typical Pico de Gallo, which was good in it's own right....but nothing for people like me who like it Hot.

Overall, great eats!

Eight of us came to this Ethiopian restaurant for dinner during Restaurant Week. Among all participating restaurants, we made the decision on Lalibela based on the strength of the prix fixe menu, availability of vegetarian and gluten-free options, and price.

We were seated immediately upon arrival and the interior was well lit, spacious, and clean. The seating arrangement started with a score of smaller tables that led to ours in the back. The vibe was casual and appropriate for groups of all sizes. 

My choice of appetizer, the Beet and Potato Salad, was a wonderful starter. The mix of chunky beet and potato came with great texture underscored by a light lemon vinaigrette flavor. This is one item I haven't had at Ethiopian restaurants, but it's something I would order again.

The main entre came with two forms of beef stews; pan-fried beef, chicken stew, green beans, collard greens, lentil, salad, and cabbage with carrots and potatoes. They were served on a bed of fluffy injera with just the right amount of sourness. I was addicted to the softness of the injera, and they were generous to replenish them whenever it was needed. 

The beef items were cut too small, but the spiciness was on point with purpose. The chicken needed to come with an egg, but the vegetarian platter was truly delicious. All the flavors were discernible, unlike some of the Ethiopian restaurants where the seasoning began to taste in uniform after a while. I particularly loved the spicy beef stew, green beans, collard greens, lentil, and cabbage with carrots and potatoes. My dinner companions really enjoyed their food as well.

For dessert, my choice of Mango Mousse Cake was a hit. Plating was not particularly striking but everyone raved about it once I passed around the table. It came with an intense mango flavor, soft custard-like texture, and a smooth refined finish. 

The restaurant became extremely busy by the time we left. And, for $15, the meal was a fantastic deal. I still think the execution was not as sophisticated as Awash, Meskerem, or Abyssinia, but when price and value are considered, this place can certainly go toe to toe with some of the better places around the country. Service was slow, but knowledgeable, responsive, and friendly. Interested diners should expect a good level of authenticity when it comes to the seasoning. Those interested should also be aware of their large portions--so be ready to take some of the food home. I'd be very interested in coming back for another feast.

WHERE THE BIG EASY MEETS VIVA LAS VEGAS

   The Orlean's is a New Orleans themed hotel & Casino. I see it as an indoor theme park where the theme is to try to win money and have fun in a faux New Orleans. Big Al the Alligator is the mascot of this indoor theme park. He is to the Orlean's what Micky Mouse is to Disneyland.  At the main entrance he stars with the alligator statues playing jazz in a scene that welcomes guests to the Orlean's.  Last week was the fourth time this scene welcomed me as a guest in the Orlean's when I walked in the casino during my staycation. And, I have a lot to say.

 The Orleans is the best of both worlds. It is a Boyd local's casino and a Strip corridor tourist casino. It is off of Tropicana Avenue about a mile west of the Las Vegas Strip. Depending on traffic, around every half hour, the Boyd shuttle runs between the Orlean's & Bally's from 9 am to 12:30 am. Guests & B-card members get priority. For the record they never checked. The parking garage is easy in easy out where the surface parking is hit & miss.

  If you read my reviews, you know I love eating. The Orlean's has good dining options. Their French Market Buffet is better than some of the hyper-priced Strip buffets. The 24-hour Courtyard Cafe serves good food at reasonable prices. Near the parking garage is the food court featuring Fuddruckers, Sbarro, Subway, & Baskin Robins. Near registration, Java Coffee is a nice spot to relax with a Starbuck's coffee and Krispy Kreme Donut. And there is Friday's, Sushi, steak house, and an oyster bar.

  If you read my reviews, you know I like drinking & having a good time. This is a casino with cool bars. There is Brendan's Irish Pub. I prefer this bar when it is quiet. And they made a good Blue Hawaiin that was around $7.  In the heart of the casino there are New Orlean's themed bars with serious attention to the motif. They are the Alligator Bar, Crawfish Bar, & Mardi Gras Bars. The drafts beer at the casino bars start at $3.50 for Budweiser. Near the main entrance is the Bourbon Lounge. At night it is a nice spot to take in a live covers band. One night a country act played here. This past Saturday, a covers act played soft music featuring Barry White's "Love Theme."

 Reading my reviews, you see I like entertainment.  The Orlean's has a bowling alley, movie theaters, a decent resort pool, and an arena. The arena is the home of the Las Vegas Wrangler's ice hocky. And there is a plush showroom that I remember being comfortable many moons ago when we saw the Pointer Sisters.

  All this stuff costs money. With that said, I enjoy moderate gambling with the hopes of winning some money. My game of choice is Caveman Keno. The Orlean's is a go-to casino for Keno players. There is a Keno lounge surrounded by Game Maker keno machines. This past Saturday I gambled near the Bourbon Lounge overhearing the music of Barry White and soft rock. $5 kept me in action for an hour. In that hour, the cocktail waitress delivered two Blue Hawaiins & a Coke.

  The Orlean's is a relatively safe place to stay. There is a security guard by the elevators. All we did was flash our room card to get on the elevator.  So in reality a bad guy could blend in with a crowd holding an old room card. Security is a good deterent and they also have a presence throughout the casino & parking garage.

  Room 1248 wasn't a Bellagio suite, however,  it was comfortable. I slept very well on the soft bed. Room 1248 overlooked the resort pool. This brings up the point that most rooms most likely have a nice view. The west facing rooms in the t-shaped tower overlook Red Rock Canyon and the east facing rooms overlook the Strip. Maid service was on the ball. And compared to the Strip hotels, the rates are a steal. I have seen close to a $100 price difference between the Orlean's and Strip properties.

  I am a fan of the theme casinos. The casinos that overdo it with stuffness are blah. The hotel casinos that do a fantastic job with the theme are unique and fun. The Orlean's is a theme hotel casino that is fun to the degree that I themed its review after an indoor theme park. I am a fan of indoor theme parks and will most likely return to the hotel casino where the Big Easy meets Viva Las Vegas.

***Le Cirque's lobster risotto was excellent and the prices were not completely unreasonable given that it was Vegas; still, the old-fashioned style (while pleasant enough) will probably keep me from returning***

Le Cirque is a very small fine dining spot located in The Bellagio.  The atmosphere is circus-like with a multicolored tent ceiling and many nice circus murals throughout the room.  The circus decor is even evident in the striped chairs.

Le Cirque is a French restaurant (that had a Michelin Star when they still did Michelin Stars in Las Vegas) and the menu features two options--a tasting menu or a 3 course menu where you pick a starter, an entree and a dessert.

They started us off with a few complimentary items like some okay French bread and a good butternut squash soup that was finished with cream.

We elected for the 3 course pre fixe and I started with the lobster risotto.  The lobster risotto was good.  I felt the rice was a little overcooked (I think it needed a little more bite), but the flavor of the dish was good and it was nice and creamy.  The lobster was very soft and fresh.

I would not put Le Cirque's lobster risotto up there with Sona's offering because the lobster at Sona was a higher quality and Sona utilized bigger chunks of lobster, which resulted in a more memorable experience.  Still, the lobster risotto at Le Cirque was very good.

I then had the duck for my entree.  The plate included some nicely cooked duck breast that was moist and tender.  While the duck was good, the sides were just okay.  The sides included some pommes souffle, a cassis reduction (which had solidified), some roasted chestnuts, and fried grapes.  The plate could have used some vibrance.  While the duck was good, the plate felt a little old-fashioned.

The entree also came with a little container of duck confit in kind of a stew.  This was savory, sweet and very good.

For dessert, I had the chocolate souffle, which came with some vanilla ice cream and a creme anglais.  The chocolate souffle had a good chocolate flavor though it was not prepared appropriately.  It was a tad dry.  While I am not a fan of the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, their chocolate souffle is better than the one at Le Cirque.

I also had a banana ice cream on the side and it was decent--nice and creamy but maybe a tad too soft.

The meal ended with some good petit fours including chocolates and macarons.

Service was good, but it was not as polished as service I have had at other fine dining spots in Vegas.  The food still came out at a quick pace and the staff was pleasant.

Prices were high, but it was probably not much more expensive than the nearby Eiffel Tower Restaurant and Le Cirque is significantly better.

There were parts of Le Cirque that I liked very much (such as the lobster risotto and the little stew of duck confit), but I did not end up loving the restaurant.  There were some good things about it and in some ways Le Cirque succeeds where so many overpriced Vegas restaurants fail.  Still, the food felt a little old-fashioned.  And even though I did like Le Cirque more than some other old-fashioned fine dining spots I've tried (like LA's Valentino), I still did not like it enough to want to return.

The Bellagio features complimentary valet and self parking.

I decided to check out Commonwealth for its opening weekend and I'm glad I did- this place is amazing!  Located in Fremont East right next to Le Thai, locals have another bar they can hop to during the course of the evening.

Get your ass inside and find a beautiful, expansive space with plenty of seating.  Admire the art and lighting while enjoying a craft beer or fancy cocktail.  Or, better yet, admire the beautiful bartenders pouring your drinks.  I was thoroughly digging on the boys in suspenders.

There is also an outdoor patio area upstairs if you want to smoke or enjoy the view of Downtown.  I believe there is another bar up there as well.

To get an idea for drink prices, my husband ordered a draft beer (Alley Cat Amber, which was really good) and I had a well drink.  They came out to be about $7 a piece.  Someone next to us ordered a sidecar (that looked yummy) and theirs was $9.

The crowd was diverse and included hipsters, cool kids, and quite a few guys dressed in suits.  Everyone was friendly and enjoying their time at Commonwealth.  Someone even bought the bar a round of shots (before it got too crowded, of course).  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the crowd stays the way it is and doesn't get overrun with bros.

We got in around 9:00 or 9:30 (on a Saturday) and it wasn't too busy and we were able to find a seat at the bar.  An hour later, however, was a completely different story.  There were wall-to-wall people and standing room only.  Depending on if you want to just chill or you're out to mingle, you should keep this in mind.

What made me fall in love with this place so much?  Was it the gorgeous atmosphere?  Was it the friendly crowd and staff?  Was it because they stole my iPod to create their music playlist?  Maybe it was just the cute boys in suspenders?  Well, whatever it was made me fall pretty hard for Commonwealth and I'm anxiously awaiting our next date.

After reading a few reviews I was really tricked into thinking the portions would be minuscule. Like french-modern-cuisine tiny, but luckily I was wrong. 

I erred on the side of thinking the portions would be small so I ordered us two starters but we could have just done with one. However, they were both drool-worthy. One was the baguette with creamy garlic, it consisted of  6 slices of bread with a whole garlic cooked until it's spreadable covered in olive oil and spices. Basically you scoop a clove out and spread it on the bread. This was good, like drool-on-you-keyboard-good (DOYKG). We also ordered the Nosh plate,a typical melon, meat, cheese and nuts plate. Everything on that was tasty and both would have been great alone, but I'm glad we tried both.

For main courses my gf ordered the mac and cheese with prosciutto and breadcrumbs and liked it. I had Vovo's special which is a rotating special. Last night it was the tamale and tortilla soup. We both liked our dishes and were stuffed. I was a little envious after seeing another couple's dish. They ordered the chicken and waffles. It wasn't your typical soul food style but it looked tasty regardless. We both had wine. Gf had the Rose which she thought was a little dry and I wasn't too fond of either. I had the Tempranillo which I liked but wasn't amazing. That's probably the only gripe, I wish their wine list was deeper.

All in all the place was awesome and a great date destination. Romantic lighting and original decor and architecture, good for conversation starters.

The crowd was older that I expected, not a negative just an observation, although it was a Thursday and that might change on weekends. The service was nice and the free after dinner snack. Chocolate covered cookie dough was like pastry crack and also (DOYKG).

Side note: The prices aren't cheap but they won't break you. Especially if you go to other establishments in the same area. My tab for this meal was $60 which is good I think. Two sides, two glasses of wine, one main course and one small course. Not bad as far as I'm concerned.

After seeing a sign on the door for what felt like three years, Cornish Pasty is finally open and ready for business.  And the best news?  They have tons of vegetarian options!

Located in the same plaza as Thai staples Komol and Lotus of Siam, Cornish Pasty is a smaller space but cozy and inviting.  Think of it as a local pub with lots of good food.

Speaking of food, we ate a ton of it.  I started off with the Cream of Leek, Potato, and Stilton soup (fyi: this is vegetarian/no chicken stock).  The cup is a good portion, and served with two large pieces of homemade bread and homemade butter.  It's a steal for $3.50.  Although I really enjoyed it, the Stilton cheese it might make the soup a little salty for some people.  As for the pasties, I wanted something more traditional and ordered the Cheese and Onion.  It tasted great and everything was cooked well, but I couldn't bring myself to use the ketchup or marina that came with it.  My husband had the Veggie Chicken Tikka Masala and his was really good as well.  There was a nice blend of spices and it came with a side of mint-yogurt dressing that we both enjoyed.  

Cornish Pasty also offers a decent beer selection and a 14-oz will set you back $6. 

I loved the atmosphere here and all the employees were laid-back and friendly.  Cornish Pasty would even make a good spot just to grab a few drinks for an evening.  I can't speak for the authenticity of the food (which is questionable considering they offer a Mexican pasty), but I do know that I enjoyed what I ordered. The pasties are large and filling so make sure to bring your appetite!

Note to Vegetarians: They use Quorn in about half of their veggie pasties.  While being a popular meat-alternative in the UK, this was the first time my husband and I have ever had it.  I found it to be pretty much the same as most other faux-meats.  I'm sure they could leave it out of the pasties if you asked them.

Note to Vegans: According to their menu, they offer at least two vegan pasties daily.  

Note to Omnivores: If my vegetarian pasties tasted awesome, you have nothing to worry about.  And may I suggest trying a vegetarian pasty?

You know the expression about sailors having a woman in every port. Well, on my recent trip to the USA, I had Yelpers in every town to host, entertain and amuse!

Vegas Elite Dennis T was my lunch companion when I was in town. Not only was he gracious enough to clear some time in his busy schedule to have lunch with me but I was honoured that he made our meal together his 100th review

Dennis gave me a list of tempting options for lunch. I had to watch how much I was going to have for lunch as I had a dinner reservation at Raku that evening for the kaiseki menu but the lobster sliders at Delmonico caught my eye, so that was my choice.

I had a nice time wandering through the Venetian on my way to Delmonico. The size and scale of U.S. buildings in general amaze me but the Venetian is certainly very ornate and I enjoyed looking at the menus while walking down restaurant row on the way to Delmonico

I instantly recognised Dennis from his Yelp picture and like all the Yelpers I've met, conversation flowed like we were old friends. So much so that unusually for Yelpers, we were chatting so much that ordering took awhile as we hadn't look at the menu the first few times that our waiter approached to take our order

The restaurant is certainly decked out to appeal to the higher end of customer. It was a quiet lunch service when we dined and while it provided a good ambiance for chatting, I perhaps didn't see Delmonico as the busy celebrity chef steakhouse that it is.

I had already decided on my main course of lobster sliders and using my personal rule of taking the opportunity of eating foods that I don't come across often, I paired that with an appetiser of traditional New Orleans gumbo. I'm not in any position to comment on the authenticity of the gumbo but as Emeril Lagasse started his celebrated celebrity chef trail with his first restaurant Emeril's in New Orleans, I'm guessing he can cook a good gumbo. Mine was certainly pungent with a great depth of flavour from a carefully stock. Being Asian, I was also impressed to see that the rice had been cooked well

Dennis was pleased with his appetiser of lobster bisque followed by Caesar salad

It may seem odd to eschew steak at a steakhouse. However, I've always liked the sound of lobster roll but still haven't tried one yet. I saw these lobster sliders as the nearest I could get until I make my trip to the northeast to try a real lobster roll. Well, the sliders were excellent - soft rolls containing morsels of sweet lobster meat mixed with the right amount of mayonnaise and seafood dressing.

Dennis however wasn't quite as lucky with his fillet steak, which arrived looking rather lonely on the plate. Dennis decided to order some bearnaise to correct this loneliness but it took a long time to appear and when it did, it seemed a bit watery.

In an effort to not be too piggy, Dennis and I split the banana cream pie. Well, the combination of banana, pie, whipped cream, caramel and chocolate shavings pleased my palate probably more than my arteries! I don't have a really sweet tooth but I really enjoyed this

Dennis was kind enough to give a lift back to my hotel down the Strip, which gave me a good touristy view of the sights

A friendship sealed. A celebrity chef ticked off. Lobster sliders consumed. A most successful lunch rendezvous indeed!

Just got done with "lunch" at Scramble, Sunnyslope's newest breakfast spot! They've only been open since Monday (this is their fourth day in operation) so I expect some adjustments will happen over time... here are my initial thoughts, after one visit:

They've definitely improved the old 1980s Le Peep interior!! This contemporary new look is perfect for the neighborhood! The set up is kind of like Sauce, where you file past menu boards as you approach the register to order. You'll be given a number to place on your table so food can be delivered to you. There's an island station for drinks, condiments (ketchup and Tabasco) and silverware (although the cups are paper). The chairs are silver and resemble plastic lawn furniture but are made from a lightweight metal (caution: they are VERY noisy when they clank against one another as you drag a chair to move it!). Not necessarily a seat you would want to settle into, but, hey! We're here to eat, right? There are large TVs mounted throughout the dinning area which I have mixed feelings about - I get very distracted by the closed caption because I'm sucker enough to believe FOX or CNN when they alert: "breaking news."

My lunchmate and I tried one of their "signature breakfast pizzas" called Brizzas ($8). A puffy, crust covered with creamy scrambled eggs. Ours was topped with mushrooms and decorated with a few leaves of spinach, fresh sprigs of thyme and melted cheese. While the eggs were perfect, the pizza did not have the flavor punch I had expected. 

That said, the eggs were very good and I'm looking forward to trying an omelet ($9) or breakfast burrito ($7) on another visit. Although, I'm not sure I can say it will be my next one because the cinnamon rolls which are baked fresh daily in house or the pancakes (buttermilk, multigrain, caramelized banana, vanilla peach, seasonal berry, chocolate chip or peanut butter chip) may divert my attention. Also, the Santa Fe eggs benedict ingredients of jalapeno corn bread, blackened ham and chipotle hollandaise are tempting...

Scramble is open from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. so they do have some lunch offerings (served after 11 a.m.). We also split the simple salad: butter lettuce, tomato, avocado and onion with a lemon vinaigrette. The salad was fine. Tasty fresh ingredients (I spied some more thyme in the salad too) and was chocked full of avocado, but I don't think the portion was enough to satisfy as a meal and that made the price seem a little steep ($7.50).

I'm looking forward to walking to Scramble on a lazy morning and taking advantage of the outdoor seating along 7th Street while I sip coffee, read the paper and chow down on some pancakes.

Hey, Scramble, welcome to the neighborhood! Glad to have ya!!

Still hung over from a night of drinking we strolled into the Wicked Spoon with one idea in mind, stuffing our faces. I hadn't really slept much and still had a headache but I figured that an all you can eat paradise would get me back on track.  That and maybe a couple more drinks...

Now while waiting in line to gain entry into the promised land, I did what every bored fat kid does when waiting in line at a buffet.  I left my friends to sneak a peak at the goods (and maybe have a taste or two).  Best idea ever!

As I walked around I noticed that they had a dope carving station with my all time favorite item...ding ding ding PORK BELLY, which was resting beside a giant leg of lamb and a perfectly cooked tri-tip. I began to drool...

Honestly at this point I didn't care for much else.  I was planning on eating my weight in pork fat and slabs of rare beef and lab.  I was sold. I then grabbed a few pieces of humbolt fog and headed out to meet my friends and pay.

Once in I b-lined straight to the carving station and filled my plate up like I hadn't eaten in days.  Heck after leaving the carving station I didn't have much room for anything else, which worked out well because I had gotten what I came for. MEAT MEAT and more MEAT!

And we lived happily ever after...

Other notable items were the salads, cheeses, and mini appetizers.  I wasn't a big fan of the pastas, or fish item I tried.  Wood fired pizza was good, and I loved pureed potatoes. The Asian section kinda sucked, but the Asian section at most buffets usually suck so lets call that a wash.  The desserts are kinda wack, minus the gelato and the tiny dessert thing with the mini macaron on top (so cute).

Overall I just wasn't that impressed with anything except the carving station, but like I said above it was love at first bite. In fact I'm still dreaming about that succulent pork belly and perfectly cooked beef.  #beingfatrules

Unlike the Bouchon in Beverly Hills, the Las Vegas location is open for breakfast.  Located on the 10th floor of the Venetian hotel, Bouchon has a nice dining room.  High ceilings and a brasserie-like feel with the floor, decorations and specials on chalkboard.  Formal table settings with white tablecloth.  I think this Bouchon may also feature outdoor dining.

Bouchon's breakfast menu is reasonably priced (given its Las Vegas competition).  Most of their breakfast items run below $20.  You will probably pay anywhere from $12-$16 per dish at Las Vegas cafes and even though the portions would probably be bigger than what you will find at Bouchon, it is very likely that those same cafes would be using lower quality ingredients.

I went with the Croque Madame.  The sandwich was a toasted ham and cheese sandwich on brioche that was topped with a sunny side up egg and Mornay sauce.  The sandwich was okay.  It was tasty and filling, but I felt the Croque Madame at Comme Ca was much better.  Comme Ca's sandwich has a great toasted Gruyere cheese crust that is kind of like the cheesy top of baked lasagna.

Bouchon's version lacked that cheese top and it made the sandwich feel a little boring (also, the sandwich was a little dry on the edges--kind of like dry toast that has not been buttered).  The Mornay sauce (which Comme Ca's sandwich lacks) was okay, but it did not really do anything to make the sandwich stand out.  The egg was nicely cooked.

The french fries were good.  While the fries were good (hot, crisp and flavorful), they do kind of remind me of when you get a really good batch of McDonald's french fries.  Not that that's a bad thing.  McDonald's french fries are quite popular.  The portion of french fries here was very generous.

Service was very good.  Good hostess who was very accommodating and observant; also, a very polite and attentive waiter.

Las Vegas food is typically overpriced.  This Bouchon, on the other hand, is pretty similar (maybe slightly more expensive) than the Beverly Hills Bouchon.  You could easily eat much worse in Vegas in the same price range.  Because of that, Bouchon (for breakfast or dinner) is probably a good option for dining in Las Vegas even if I did not enjoy the food as much as I hoped.

Complimentary parking is available.  I used valet though I think self-parking is also available.

On a recent trip to Sin City, a visit to Serendipity was on the top of my list. I've been to the original NYC location several times, and looked forward to seeing how this west coast location compared to the east coast OG one. My partner in crime for the weekend, Li, had never been to either location, so was more than happy to accompany her. 

Slightly hungover, we needed sustenance before diving into the famous Frozen Hot Chocolate. I was shocked to find out that the wait was only 20 minutes. The interior doesn't quite have the charm and coziness of the NYC location, but is open and spacious. There is also outdoor seating available. The music was an eclectic mix of 80s, 90s, and current tunes, which I appreciate, but the volume was a bit loud for my liking. 

So, we ordered: 
- Cup of Tomato Soup: The flavor and texture were perfect, and one of my best I've ever had. I loved how it was accented with goldfish crackers. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=Hni3DAqO9NXPth8mNsK5eA 

- ABC Burger: Avocado, Brie Cheese burger. Li and I were intrigued with this unique combo, and decided to split this and it was wonderful. Juicy burger and toasty buns, and ginormous portions of avo and brie. This was accompanied by crisp, sweet potato fries. 

- Frozen Hot Chocolate: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=85Ev04Z-UaQksArEs2ZVNg The grand finale! It didn't disappoint and was super thick and chocolatey. It's better than a chocolate malt/milkshake, as the consistency is icy, yet creamy. This was topped with a huge dollop of whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Talk about choco heaven! Oh Mylanta! We sipped and slurped as much as our stomachs could handle, but failed to finish it. 

Overall, a decent Serendipity experience. Our server wasn't the friendliest nor super attentive. It took some time for my Diet Coke refills, food, and bill  to arrive at our table. Ambiance isn't as quaint and lovely as the NYC location, but it's still fun place to bring your friends and family. Be warned that the prices are a bit high, food portions are large, music is loud, and service can be spotty. There's a lil' retail area for the t-shirts, frozen hot choco packets, etc., Also, unlike the NYC location, there is a take-out window where you can order from a limited menu (some snacks like pretzels, donuts, etc.,as well as frozen hot chocolate) to enjoy in front of the patio tables in front of Caesar's Hotel or to take along while you walk the strip.

Follow the yellow brick road to the emerald city and you'll find the golden lion! It's the first thing you see as you enter the main lobby.

This hotel is pretty grand, alright, at least in size. Being the largest hotel and casino in Las Vegas, maybe they feel they don't need to be the best in customer service. Granted, there were over 15,000 people from my company for a huge convention, but they should be equipped to handle as many guests as can fit in the hotel, right? They're just lucky the other 15,000 people went elsewhere.

Need to Spend $?
---------------------
Plenty of restaurants, touristy shops, and of course... massive casino space. Many vehicles for spending dolla bills! The food court gets wicked crowded so I tended to opt for **Blizz**, which is just around the corner and has some healthy juice options (see Blizz review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/blizz-las-vegas?hrid=9pL5NN9VJ-YEqvD0mBJjBA). Also MGM is home to **Cirque Du Soleil's 'Ka'**. Not my favorite Cirque show, but still an interesting one. My favorite Cirque show is the Beatles' 'LOVE', which you can only catch in Las Vegas. (see LOVE review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?hrid=FBWaEYnI5TPtpuBeePDZdA).

Need to Catch Some Sun?
-------------------------------
They have not one, not two, but FOUR pools! If those weren't enough fun for you, they have 3 whirlpools and waterfalls too. It's a 6.5 acre complex of pool action and also includes a quarter mile lazy river. As if you hadn't already consumed enough food and alcohol, they have 5 bars and a full service Cabana grill. You can even get a poolside massage. What?!

Need to Feel Large and In Charge?
----------------------------------------
The **MGM Grand Garden Arena** is there for you! When you're here, you can't help but feel the power and energy of thousands of people in one space. Amazing sound systems and visual effects really enhance the experience. If your company is cool enough to play EDM (electronic dance music) for 5 hours, I can guarantee you'll have a great time here. Arena staff are friendly and helpful, which is a huge contrast compared to much of the hotel.

Need to Dance?
-------------------
Other than partying with my company's EDM fix, you can also hit up **Hakkasan**, one of the hottest nightclubs in Vegas. No wonder this place won the title of "#1 Nightclub in the World" by Playboy Magazine. All the top DJ's spin here, including resident DJ's Tiesto and Calvin Harris. Then of course there's also **Wet Republic** at the ultra pool, complete with the resident DJ's, a newly expanded 95-foot bar (neverending alcohol), a huge LED display, party cabanas/bungalows, and of course tons of people ready to party in their bathing suits. A super fun day party! (see Wet Republic review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/wet-republic-ultra-pool-las-vegas?hrid=KRe8TmiGoVdgNzKIFNxjgw)

All in all, the MGM Grand has a LOT to offer. Just wish their customer service could keep up.

TIP: Be prepared when asking for extra towels. Staff may sound as shocked as if you had asked for their firstborn child.

DATE TIP: Plenty of venues here for a hot date!

In exchange for watching our little one, my in-laws proposed that we meet up at Crackers & Co to make the switch. A new breakfast place AND we get a date day? I'm game!

When we first arrived, I was a little skeptical. The Cafe is located in a little strip mall behind the Home Depot, right next to a cabinet place. But, I'm learning to be adventurous, so I decided to not judge this place by its surroundings. Wise decision!

We showed up during what I thought would be prime brunch time on a Sunday morning. Surprisingly, there was absolutely no wait. We were ushered to our table by the hostess, where we were greeted by, arguably, the most cheerful, interactive, and helpful waitress I've ever encountered. Thank you, Luana.

We looked over the menu for a few minutes, it didn't really take us long to figure out what we wanted. My daughter got the kids pancakes, and my wife and I each ordered the Healthy Scram.  For the so called "kids" portion of pancakes, my daughter received three full grown pancakes. Of course, she couldn't finish them. If she had, I imagine she would have been in a coma for the next two days.

As for my wife's and my meal...absolutely delicious. We each opted to have two extra egg whites scrambled in with our orders. Essentially, it ends up being an oversized egg white omelette. Couple that with a cup of fresh fruit and a dry English muffin, and you've got yourself an amazingly healthy and filling breakfast/brunch/dinner... whenever you decide to eat it, I assure you, it will be delicious.

The three of us ended up spending about $40 for our meals. The price is a little bit inflated, though, as it does cost $1.00 extra per egg white added to our omelettes. But, whatever. you pay for what you get...and we got an awesome meal!

If you're looking for a cozy breakfast place with a great menu with healthy options, awesome atmosphere, a patio, and (in our case), the greatest service we've experienced in QUITE some time, then you should definitely stop by!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 45/100

I had read some amazing reviews about Jean Philippe Patisserie, so I HAD to come here on my recent visit to Vegas this past weekend.

It is located in the Bellagio hotel, just a little bit past the Conservatory & Botanical Gardens. There are signs pointing towards which direction it is located in!

I was actually pretty surprised at how small this place was. I had envisioned to be a full bakery/patisserie with tons of cute little cafe tables/chairs and whatnot, but that wasn't the case. It's like a circular area with the employees/staff all in the middle, and you kinda just walk around the counter to look at all of the pastries, gelato, sandwiches, etc.

One wall has the famous chocolate fountain, which honestly...was not as big as I had pictured. When people said it's the "biggest chocolate fountain in the world" I was thinking like straight up Willy Wonka status. This was totally not the case! Granted, it was a really nice glass display and I really liked that they had dark, milk, and white chocolate pouring in it, but I didn't think it was as mindblowing as I had expected it to be.

Along the circular walls they have a bunch of packaged goodies like chocolates, candies, hot chocolate mix, etc. They also have some fake cakes on display. I'm not sure if they actually bake fancy cakes here, but the displays were nice!

Unfortunately I had just eaten lunch and wasn't hungry at all, so I didn't any of the pastries although I had REALLY wanted to try some of them out! They didn't have a HUGE selection but some of them looked very tasty! I ended up getting a scoop of the dulce de leche gelato ($3+), and the Jean Philippe vanilla hot chocolate mix ($18).

The gelato was ok to me. Presentation wasn't the nicest, and also it was really soft...like to the point where it was basically melting! Gross. I wasn't impressed.

I made the hot chocolate mix when I came home, and I must say, this stuff is INCREDIBLE. It reminds me of the hot chocolate at Churros Calientes in Los Angeles. Super thick, rich, and decadent. omg, it is incredible. I'm glad it turned out well because $18 for only a few cups of hot chocolate was pretty pricey! Even more than Godiva and some other high end chocolate brands.

Overall, I liked Jean Philippe but I wasn't as blown away as I thought I was going to be. I definitely would return to actually try some of their pastries and maybe even their crepes (which are supposed to be amazing). 3 stars!

So what would happen if Hawaiian food and Chipotle conceived a love child? You guessed it, Frank Stallone!, oh, I mean Braddah's Island Style!! There is nothing that I've had here that I didn't like. It's definitely worth checking out for the great casual food.

I've heard lots of good things about this place but never tried it for various reasons. But hey, guess what? My little homie, you know him, his name is Groupon was like "hey mike, I got this great deal for you.." I was like "oh yea? What you got for me on this bright and beautiful day?" And he was like "listen to this, you gotta check out this place, it's called Braddah's Island Style, and I'll give you $12 bucks of food for only $6. What do you say?" I was like, "ok, you twisted my arm, but be a little bit more gentle next time because that kinda hurt, I shall take you up on your offer." And so our journey began.

It's really similar to Chipotle. You can either order a burrito, 3 tacos, a bowl, and a salad (just make sure it's not a tossed one). Then you order your meats and toppings. Go for the steak, it's worth it. Hey! Not really a steak eater? Well then young sir, there are also other options available such as pork, chicken, and fish. Oh, so now you don't eat animals. No problem my friend, because Braddah's has that base covered too. You can get some tofu. There you go.

These guys don't skimp on the toppings. I was so moved by their generosity that the tears almost, sorta, kinda, maybe decided to think that they were going to fall, but it wasn't the case.

I see you coconut bark, giving me the eye with your deliciousness. Looking all sexy in the corner over there. Oh, I'm heading your way soon enough. Just give me some time to get things situated with my situations, then we'll talk.

So go here. Now! J/k whenever you're up for it.

I don't just hand out 5 star reviews. ESPECIALLY after only one visit. But I have absolutely not a single doubt that I will be back for this incredibly fresh seafood. AND I DON'T EVEN EAT OYSTERS! We came on a Saturday night, and luckily since there was a fight going on, there was NO WAIT!! (note taken: come on fight night) After reading a ton of reviews, I pretty much had my heart set on the Signature Pan Roast with shrimp crab and lobster at about level 8 spice level, long before my arrival. But I also got a cup of New England style chowder first. Other than being along the coast in Oregon or Washington, best I have had!  This clam chowder was thick, with HUGE amounts of clams. Exactly what I expected. 
My bf got the shrimp scampi, and the stepson went with the Bouillabaisse. It literally had one of everything in there! Like a big fish stew! Even the sourdough rolls they brought to the table were great. And watching the chef cook your food, as well as others is the best part! 
My boyfriend is semi allergic to shrimp, and he still wanted to return for one of those beautiful lobsters.
The spice in the pan roast was perfection, however next time I will get one scoop of rice instead of two. It soaks up the spice which I am sure most people usually love. The chunks of crab and lobster were full of flavor! It will be hard for me to order anything else. 
The service was great, and in a casino you can't always expect that. Overall a wonderful place for good seafood and fresh shellfish!

Is it me, or do all the gorgeous people somehow end up in XS? Write this down - get glammed up, or else you'll feel out of place.

I take back my previous 3-star review. Next to TAO, this is one of my favorite clubs in Vegas. The decor is absolutely breathtaking and I love the spaciousness of both the dance floor and the outdoor pool. 

Did you know you can dance in the pool?? So awesome.

Unlike a lot of other party spots in LV, security inside isn't too strict about groups of drunkies raiding empty tables and beds. There's so many VIP areas available, you won't have someone breathing down your neck if you want to steal one to rest your feet for a few minutes. 

However, I can't say the same thing about the bouncers in front managing the line.

They've gotten a bit more organized about their lines now (THANK GOODNESS), but the guys that work them are still pricks that want ridiculous tips for a favor. With that being said, I've learned a trick that I think everyone should take into consideration:

- Get in line by 9:30 (make sure you scout for passes beforehand if you're a lady)
- Get stamped by 10.
- Go back up to your room for drinks.
- Come back down at midnight and pass up the fat line that wraps around to the Wynn Theater.

Why does this work? - You'll only need to wait about 20-30 minutes rather than over an hour, you'll get a good buzz without having to drop bills at the bar, you'll get to feel like VIP walking past everyone else standing in line when you return, and the music doesn't really get goin' until after 12am anyway.

I'm a genius. Thank me later. ;)

4.5!!!!

I had been wanting to try Soho forever since the reviews look great but never really got around to it.. So when my gfffffff told me I definitely should try it out because she loved it, I dragged my mom there to grab an early dinner.. We actually came during Happy Hour so that was an added bonus! 

There was a about a 10 minute wait because a large party had just left so the tables had to be broken down..no biggie! But when we were sat it was almost like we were forgotten.. Our server ended up being Sheila who was just fantastic! She was so sweet and informative. Definitely suggest sitting in her section!

-HH Cold lychee sake - served in a nice sake glass.. Not too sweet and went down smooth.. I really liked how Sheila would refill my sake cup since that is not something that is practiced at all neighborhood sushi joints..
-HH Tostadas- the yellowtail, salmon and tuna ones were so good and fresh! The kimchi Tako one was a little on the salty side.
-HH Firecracker- I usually don't like deep fried rolls but this one was good and not oily!
-HH spicy tuna roll & salmon avocado roll.. Fish was fresh but the rice was a bit too sweet
-HH hydro bib black cod- 2 in one order.. My mom loved these.. Don't know if you're supposed to eat it like a lettuce wrap but that's what she did lol
-Ume scallop- so fresh and delicious with a little bit of yuzu, tobiko and salt... mmmmmM the cilantro goes perfect with it as well
-Yuzu Soy Yellowtail- at the end of the meal Sheila brought out this dish on the house since it was our first time and this is their signature dish (they did this for my gfffff too). The fish was good but it was way too cold almost like it was just defrosted.. I really appreciate them bringing out this dish for us and it says lots about their customer service! 

I will definitely be back! HH is awesome and their lunch specials look good too!

HOT TIP: if they don't give you a cool sushi pen at the end of your meal.. Ask for one!

So, my only question for La Grande Orange Pizzeria is...can I please live here?  Seriously, this place is GREAT!  There really is no formal division between the pizzeria and grocery parts of the store, so I'm going to talk about both.  Grocery-wise, the place carries a broad mix of classic candies, wines, cookbooks, tchotchkes that rotate seasonally (I've picked up some great holiday items here in years past), and grocery staples; they also have a cafe that serves up oatmeal, eggs (friends rave about the Commuter Sandwich), salads, sandwiches, and sushi rolls.  Word to the wise - bring some extra napkins because their bakery will make you drool!  Order up front at the counter, pick a seat, and then keep your ears perked for when they call your name.  Friendly staff, cool ambience - I always find myself Shazam-ing the music here!  ;)         

As far as the pizza is concerned, the crust is insane!  It almost reminds me of really good sourdough bread, toasted and crispy, not too thin and not too thick.  All the ingredients are fresh and the pizza permutations creative.  They serve up your pie on a slab of wood - nice presentation!  Sadly, I am a creature of habit - once I find something that's to my liking, I latch on and order it every time I return for the rest of my life :/ At this particular establishment, these personal faves would be the Rocket Man Pizza (spicy red fresno chilies, broccolini, roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes) and the Classic Chocolate Pudding - wow, just wow!  I make my poor husband drive all the way across town to come here - he always grumbles but in the end, admits that the place IS pretty delicious.  

The only negative - and it definitely a BIG negative - is the parking situation.  La Grande Orange has the tinsiest micro parking lot known to man.  On a good day if the parking lot gods are smiling down on you, you just might find an open 20 minute parking spot (I haven't been impressed that they actually enforce the time restrictions).  But, if you go on their website under the 'Secret Parking' link (shhhh!), you will find a diagram depicting other parking options that are slightly farther away.

So yeah, come check out La Grande Orange for some great pizza, brunch, baked goods, groceries...the list goes on.  One of my favorite places in Phoenix!

All you need to know:

Peach cobbler is so good, it'll make u slap ur momma!

Brisket is moist, juicy and melts in your mouth.

Fried Okra is the best in town hands down.

Catfish is properly seasoned, crispy on the outside and juicy and flaky on the inside.

So we walked in on a Saturday night at around 11 or so and we were the only ones in there. So I will admit, I wasn't sure if the reviews were going to be right. I mean if this place was going to be as good as everyone said, then why isn't this place packed?

But we sat down and the guy was friendly and down home. I love a southern gentleman, they win me over every time. He told me that they were out of the beef ribs but if I wanted to wait 45 minutes that they would be ready. So I didn't want to wait 45 minutes and went with a meat platter. I got the brisket and st Louis ribs and hot links. Already told you about the brisket, the ribs I enjoyed too. They were tender and smokey and very flavorful. If I am being honest, then I would probably pass on the hot link. I think they were just bbq'ed too long for me. 

So we got dessert with our yelp check in and I wasn't too sure that they would taste so good based on their appearance. We ordered banana pudding and peach cobbler. I would alone come for the peach cobbler but again, if I am being honest I would pass on the banana pudding.

I love BBQ. It is just always so hard to find a good decent eats for BBQ in this town. But the quest for me has ended here. I rave about this place to everyone. 

The BBQ sauce here is amazing too. Sweet and Spicy. I tried to see if they bottled it and sold it but they don't. So instead they gave me a to go container for free.

I can't wait to come back.

Outstanding Thai food on the East side and at the cheapest prices I've ever seen! Thank you to Yelper Shawn J's review for leading me to gold.

Normally I wait to write a review until after I have at least two dining experiences, but today I can't wait. Zero patience when it comes to spreading the good word about good food.

 5 STAR FLAVOR. $5.50 (Lunch Special Prices) Green Curry Chicken at 10 for heat level. Overall it was some of the best Green Curry I've encountered and the heat level was spot on. Nice balance of white meat chicken to vegetables and loaded with chiles. It's going to be hard for me to try anything else because it was that good.

 5 STAR SERVICE. The lady who helped me gets 5 stars just for her smile. She lit up the small restaurant with her smile and positive attitude.  Her spirit is contagious and I wish my coworkers could be more like her. I had a real funny thing I wrote right here about that, but thought it would be in my best interest to keep it to myself. (That's growth)

Why only 4 STARS you ask? 
1. Because I've only eaten here once and I am not going to high five a spot until I have tasted more of the menu.
2. This place is REALLY small. It was clean and bright, but it's just too small. Definitely not first date worthy unless the person is really cool and really loves Thai food and you. Then it would be ideal. 

I forgot to mention if you check in on Yelp you get a free Thai Tea if you are dining in. 

Thai Food To Go is not to be missed. One of the most flavorful, top quality meals around for 5 bucks. I might go back tomorrow to try the Pumpkin Curry on special right now!

I really wanted to give this place 3 stars but I just couldn't justify it.

I felt like Chris Tucker in this scene from Rush Hour 2

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrAIA4c_Mtk

So any place that gives me the feeling of "This place is off the hook!" deserves that 4th star.

I mean even for me, someone who normally leaves his credit card back in the room so I don't get stuck with reserving the table .... I knew that if I really wanted to go in, I better not take any chances.  And what do you know ... no one else wanted to slide their card.  

Fuck it ... XS is one of the newer spots in LV and I like new shit.

From the moment I walked into the newer portion of the Wynn called Encore, I could just see why they called the club XS.  I mean there was an excess of just about everything.  And when I say everything, I mean everything.  

Just come check it out, it's nice!

Just don't over do it like I did because you'll be calling it a night early after meeting everyone from the bachelorette parties, birthday parties, NBA players no longer in the playoffs and the dude who's table you climbed over because you couldn't find the path to the exit.

Let me give you a tip.  You really don't need to pay for table service if there's a small group of you unless you really want to.  Just go in line early, meaning before 10p and then when they start letting people in, pay cover and get your hand stamped then go out and you can come back later.  

That's right folks, they allow re-entry.

The place is huge inside and outside, yeah outside.  They have a huge outside area where you can just hang out with your group and sit along the planters or they have a gambling area, so you will definitely find some place just to chill and hang even if you don't have a table.

Come and judge for yourself ... I think you'll be impressed with the place.

I still prefer Tryst or Drais's but then again .. that's another story.

I've read the reviews of Fat Choy my friends have posted and I knew this was a must try and I'm glad I did.

First of all, my server, Jenny, was an absolute delight.  She asked me about being there before and if I had any questions about the menu.  She was very helpful and very personable.  I was the only customer on this slow Sunday evening, and she had extra time and she spent it checking back with me a chatting.

I had looked at the menu online and I opted to try the bao.  I've never had Vietnamese bun bao so this was a new experience.  I ordered the duck and pork belly bao.  The duck bao comes with thinly sliced cucumber pieces, scallion, micro greens, and hoisin sauce.  The pork belly bao comes with one side of the pork seared, pickled mustard greens, cilantro, hoisin sauce, and some crushed peanuts.

The sandwiches were great!  The duck was my favorite because I simply love duck.  Jenny had brought me Sriracha and a small plate for putting the Sriracha and then using the plate as a dipping area.  It worked quite well!  The bun was very tasty.

Then the option came for dessert.  What's a person to do?  Ask Jenny for advice and certainly follow it.  I got the peanut butter cup which has a chocolate cookie-like bottom, then a layer of peanut butter mousse (my words), topped by some bits of crispy pieces.  I got it  la mode with vanilla ice cream.  The peanut butter is excellent.  Soft, creamy, and very rich!  I'm a fan--big time!

The restaurant uses the app Wallet so you can pay without pulling out the plastic and they'll email you a receipt if you want.  

The only drawback for me was the smell of smoke.  The restaurant is open to this small, locals casino and there's a smell of stale smoke as soon as you come in the door from the outside.  This permeates the restaurant and detracts from the overall experience.  I wish they'd put up some doors after scrubbing the place down and trying to get rid of the smoke smell.  But, I will be back.  Even though it's a small menu, there are things to try!

Bouchon is THE ideal brunch spot after a long night (and/or morning) in Las Vegas. Roll out of bed (or the club) and get yourself over here for some hearty delicious grub! 

Anna R. and I strolled over in the hot sun and arrived around 11 AM. We were told there would be a 25 minute wait. Since we hadn't eaten much the day before, we were practically starving. Luckily they offer seating at the bar, so we gratefully decided to sit there.

We each ordered a Croque Madame -- Anna highly recommended it and the description on the menu made the dish undeniable. I had no other choice. While we eagerly waited, we each enjoyed a refreshing **Hibiscus Cocktail**. Just the right amount of bubbly and lightly sweet for a morning meal. The candied hibiscus at the bottom of the glass was delicious! 

When the **Croque Madame** finally arrived, I wasn't quite ready for what I saw. Beautiful presentation -- a sunny side egg perfectly placed atop a ham and cheese sandwich with thick bread, accompanied by a huge mound of french fries. As I cut this creation open, I happily observed the cheese oozing out from within the folds of the sandwich. I was also very pleased when the egg yolk started running all over the absorbent bread and the rest of the sandwich. HEAVEN. And those fries are extremely addictive and come in a dangerously generous portion.

Service at the bar was excellent. The bartenders checked on us frequently and made sure we were taken care of. My only complaint is that it took around 30 minutes to get our food. The restaurant seemed to be understaffed on Labor Day Sunday, as there were several tables available that were not being used. I was surprised that an establishment of this caliber would not be fully staffed for a holiday when lots of hungry folks would be waiting for a table.

OVERALL: Extremely pleased with the food and service, but I hope they can fully staff all their meals so there aren't such long waits and unallocated tables.

DATE TIP: This is a super cute breakfast/brunch spot with French decor and a warm vibe. Consider taking your date here in the morning after a fun night!

Homigosh, The Buffet at the Wynn only has 950 yelp reviews? That must be some sort of Yelp record, no?

My friends and I decided to buffet dine at the Wynn since it was our last day in LV together. While all of us were sleep deprived, some were slightly hungover or depressed about not winning big! It didn't matter as we were so excited to eat at this famous buffet.

All I have to say is that this buffet is one of THE best ever. It's worth the wait (as I waited about an hour) and price ($40+) Lunch. Oh, and did I mention bottomless mimosas too for just a few extra bucks?

Look at what the main dining area looks like. Isn't it just simply gorgeous? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=A9lwzLYMlhlQkXyHs611DA

The food is absolutely amazing, as there are sections for breakfast, seafood, and other ethnic foods like Italian, Japanese, Chinese, etc.,
The presentation of the food was absolutely wonderful, and the chefs were hard at work always putting fresh and hot new trays of the highest quality dishes.

Everything I put on my multiple plates (from the eggs benedict, bacon, pasta, grilled fish, mashed potatoes, etc.,) was absolutely outstanding and delish. There wasn't one thing that I didn't enjoy eating. I died and went to heaven when I saw the dessert area. I couldn't stop saying "OH MYLANTA" with all of the cookies, pastries, cakes, and gelato galore. My fav was the pecan pie with a thin layer of chocolate inside the crust and the gelato. Num!
Here are a couple of pics - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=phkc9wlQM4f2D2__GDS87A
Beautiful Gelato and toppings
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=ikMzLsgFM-ipeCq1rsVY0A

The Buffet at the Wynn is definitely a Wynner! Special thanks to Janice C for this awesome suggestion (and even Plan A, which I'll go to another time). This was a memorable lunch buffet with my pals, and cannot wait to go back!

Received a killer deal for a 4 day/3 night stay at Encore. Turned out to be ~$116/night package that included a Wynn buffet for two for 3 days and two tickets to Le Rve.  Hey that's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick any day in my book!

Dang SWEET right?!
I'm saving a lot of money by coming here right?!
They don't call it Lost Wages for nothing right?!

Spent two days playing craps at the Encore Casino.  I wasn't even planning on playing there, but their Craps tables stuck with the $10 minimum all weekend long.  I thought for sure they would raise it to a $25 min, but no such luck.  So I couldn't resist and to my detriment, I lost big time.  I did have a 20+ roll streak and won some of it back.  Drank a lot of "free" Bloody Mary's and Dirty Martini's.  But no matter how you look at it, Encore/Wynn got their money's worth outta me.   Even though I didn't end up with a roll of 100's in my pocket, I did not leave this place disappointed.  (I did end up having enough to buy a Ho Dduk the next time I'm at Koo's ;P) 

The rooms were awesome; roomy suites (requested more shoe polish and they gave me 10 cans of it!), huge spa-like bathrooms accommodated with robes, slippers, and a flat-screen TV.  Also for your viewing pleasure, awesome views of the entire strip or downtown LV.  Part of the deal included free Wi-Fi, and use of the fitness club; a very sweet setup with a juice bar, cold and room-temp bottled water, headphones, and ample sweat towels.  When staying at the Encore/Wynn, you also have access to their "European" outdoor pool where Steve Wynn proudly states that you are free to go topless if desired.  So we went and indeed, there were many uninhibited women who were "propped up" and indeed topless.  More power to them.  Cabaas can be rented on a per/day basis.   

I wish we came to LV to experience more places to eat, but with my losing streak and money leaving my wallet left and right, we ended up eating at the "free" buffet for either lunch or dinner all three days... AND YES, I AM SO SICK OF THE WYNN BUFFET.  Even though we earned another free buffet for two the next time we go, I don't think I'll want to spend any more time there.  The one great thing was the wait service.  The waiters we had were all very nice, cordial, and attentative.  As far as the buffet was concerned nothing to write home about.  I think I did eat about 10 crme brulees as that was all that was memorable.

Le Rve was a watery enigma of a story about a lost lover who is shown a world of the underground, ravaged with temptation, and is always being pulled back and forth until the end.  At least that's my take on it.  But a great production none the less.

I hate speaking in the third person but this place had Craig R. written all over it! Just look at these tasty dishes;

Like I said, Craig R. written all over it!

Located in The Palazzo Hotel, First Food & Bar is large, dimly lit joint with a cool, relaxing vibe. 

As you can tell from what I ordered above, this place is all about tricked out comfort foods. Everything we ate was amazing. EVERYTHING!
My favorite two items were the Doritos Mac (obviously) and the Main Line Philly. The Mac was super cheesy and flavorful and the Doritos gave it an extra cheesy, crispy element.  The Philly was HUGE and delicious. The meat was so juicy and flavorful and the Foie gave it an extra, fatty, buttery taste. It was also covered in Foie mayo, sweet onions, balsamic glaze and Tartuffo Whiz, all of which made this one of the best tasting Philly's I've ever had, even though I had to eat it with a knife and fork. And I got to give a quick shout out to the Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ixV2SWDy7w8jzEAHp85qA?select=01F_4bCqJ9_EtE1fO9QSAw. It was fantastic.     

My only beef with First Food is the pricing. I'm NEVER one to complain about the price of food, especially when it's amazing, but for five small (but super tasty) Philly Dumplings it was almost twenty bucks. The Main Line Philly was over thirty. Our entire bill was almost a hundred bucks (with tip and no beverages), which seemed a bit too much. The service is great though, so that's a plus. 

Overall, I really, really enjoyed my experience at First Food & Bar. The food was outstanding, as was the service. I can't wait to go back and try some of their delicious sounding desserts.

My fiancee Santi and I came across this tapas-style restaurant on Yelp and decided to swing by for an early dinner. Dcor-wise, the restaurant had a nondescript exterior, sidewalk seating, communal tables, and all-around wooden interior. We were the first to arrive, but eventually the room was filled with small groups, families, and young professionals at every turn.

The Rabbit Rillette ($10) came with a large jar of chilled rabbit and handfuls of crushed pistachio embedded. There was also a side of sweet cherries marinated in thick syrup, and the crisp toasted bread had a nice texture and crunch. Once these ingredients were stacked together, the rabbit was absolutely sensational. There was plenty of meat in the jar to mix easily with a top layer of rabbit fat. The cherry also added an unusual sweet-tart dimension of refinement, and the server was generous to provide additional servings of the toasted bread. I thought the bread could use a smoky flavor to extend the overall experience, but otherwise it was a nice opener that is easy to share. I highly recommend it.

The Lamb Carpaccio ($14) came with thinly sliced raw lamb, corn shoots, raw egg yolk, and salsa verde. The innovative combination had a unique flavor, but our taste buds were able to come to some coherence by the second serving. For the price, the plate could have included more lamb. I also thought the dish needed an additional egg or alternatives such as quail or duck eggs to make the innovation much more compelling. There were also no kicks in the salsa verde, which was another idea that the chef should consider playing with. Otherwise, I enjoy the lifts in the flavors generated by the corn shoots. I really liked this dish, but thought the innovation could take a few more turns and twists. 

The Octopus ($13) was served with two long tentacles stacked on top of a good number of mussels, green garlic, crazy water, and spinach. The octopus was very tender, but a hint of charred smoke would have sent it out of this world. The mussels were excellent with good size, fresh, and very moist. I also enjoyed the spinach, and thought the complex seafood flavors mingled nicely with the use of seawater. Having more seawater to serve as a dip would be a nice idea to consider for the future.

Lastly, the Veal Neck ($21) arrived with miso, carrots, turnips, ramps, and radishes. The carrot was nicely pureed into a sauce that went nicely with the charred turnip. Although the veal was tender and easy to fork off the bone, it also needed more seasoning. Very simply, the taste of miso was absent to help the veal to make a stronger statement. We didn't enjoy this particular dish and weren't able to finish it.

Our server was very knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. He knew the menu inside out, and was prompt to provide new plate settings while he orchestrated the meal. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their Porchetta, Pork Tripe, Pork Belly, and Foie Gras Mousse.

I've read that brevity is the soul of wit...

Brevity is also a wonderful thing when it comes to the waiting time for your dinner of Italian peasant food...pizza:)

Brevity is not Pizzeria Bianco's strong suit...(nor mine, in writing reviews, but we're not talking about me:)

After my second visit in 4 years (and 4th visit overall), I'm trying to figure out what PB's strong suit is:(...public relations and marketing, perhaps?

Creating the "Pizza Placebo Effect"?

I generally try not to knowingly go anyplace that aggravates me, whether it's for dining, for drinking, for entertainment, for using the restroom...really for pretty much anything:)

So why were we back at PB after a good solid 4 year run of avoiding this particular aggravation?   

Other people, that's why:)

Other people wanted to go to PB...other people wanted to try the Wiseguy and the Marghareta and see Chris's oven and have mozzarella cheese and what not... and so the Beautiful Carin (who has the patience of a saint) and I took them out to PB the other evening...well, it was evening when  we started:(

We went...we waited...we had some pizza...and it was pretty average artisan pizza...

Was it the worst pizza I've ever eaten?...oh no...'sup, Totino's?

Was it the best pizza that I can remember eating?...oh no...How you doin' Flying Pie in Portland and Di Fara in Brooklyn?

Is PB worth the aggravation?...Sadly, not for me:(

For me, it's hard to overlook the attitude at the door, and the "you're barely worthy of eating here" attitudes of the servers (both in Bar Bianco and Pizzeria Bianco), as I try to enjoy my evening.

I understand that all the kids "assisting Chris" at PB think they're pretty special to be working at PB and all...but...it's a pizza joint...would it hurt them to at least try to be personable and pleasant?

It's also hard for me to overlook the multi-hour wait to dine at PB (and, truth be told, we've been here before...we did come expecting a wait...we were prepared to have wine and relax...I even had my flask, so I had a scotch and tried to relax)...still 3  1/2 hours...for pizza?

I can fly  1/2 way to NYC in the time it takes to get a table (and the flight attendants on Continental are sweet and pleasant to me...feed me drinks in 1st class...you know...they make me feel appreciated:)

And speaking of "appreciated"...it's hard for me to overlook the lack of appreciation we've encountered at PB:(

The few times we've been to PB, the staff hasn't seemed to be in a pleasant mood...very quick to tell us "the rules of PB" and eager to let us know that if we weren't good little customers, there were 50 more people in line that would happy to take our places:(

You know what... they are right...there were 50 more people that would have loved to see us leave and they would have moved up in the queue.

But it's obnoxious of the folks at PB to make that the overriding theme of the evening and it belies any pretense that they might try to concoct about "customer service" and being the "the best possible pizza experience for each customer"...the attitude of "we're PB and you're not" is pervasive and unpleasant:(

And frankly, when I spend well over $200 for pizza, wine and cheese for 4 in the course of a 3+hour wait, get a rush job on the very late dinner and a lamentable lack of service from the waiter (who's busy chatting with friends or "regulars" at the counter)...well, it causes me aggravation.

But the good news is that I won't be back for another 4 years...less aggravation for me and more spaces in the line at the door:)

This place is trying WAY too hard! 

To establish my fine dining cred, I've eaten at world-class restaurants including The Restaurant Guy Savoy (best restaurant in the world, hands down) and Taillevent in Paris; Gordon Ramsay's Boxwood Cafe in London, Enoteca Pinchiorri in Florence; Cabaa Las Lilas in Buenos Aires; Charlie Trotter's, Topolobampo and TRU in Chicago; Daniel Boulud at the Ritz-Carlton and the Blue Door at the Delano in South Beach; Chez Panisse in Berkeley; Jardiniere and Fleur de Lys in San Francisco; Picasso Restaurant at Bellagio and Bradley Ogden at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas; Larry Forgione's An American Place in St. Louis; etc.

I know a thing or two about fine dining. So what went wrong? Binkley's does not have a firm grasp of the fundamentals of fine dining.

We drove from downtown Phoenix to the hinterlands of Cave Creek for what we hoped would be an exciting culinary experience. Since Binkley's is located in metro Phoenix, it was no surprise to find it in a strip mall. However, it was a bit of a surprise to see how derelict that strip mall was.

Once the BF and I began to peruse our menus, I started to notice omens. The first was that literally nothing on the menu sounded good to me. A couple of tables over, a server dropped a pitcher of water on a woman's lap and all over her cell phone. The restaurant did nothing to make amends to the poor woman who sat there trying to mop up her drenched outfit and rescue her mobile with the napkin in her lap. 

We went for the full six-course tasting menu with the wine pairings and the BF added the Foie Gras. Then we received what we assumed would be the only amuse bouche of the night. Chef Kevin, please recall that an amuse bouche is a tiny bite-sized morsel traditionally served before the first course of a meal. At Binkley's, they're into amuse bouche a go-go. They serve them between each course and they get weirder and weirder. The final one was served on a pulsing LED coaster like the kind they use to buzz you for your table at a chain restaurant. The double shot glass on the pulsating coaster was meant to look like a lava lamp, but it reminded me of the ill-fated Orbitz soft drink that had edible balls floating in it. Drinking Orbitz was like having Willy Wonka do something naughty in your mouth and the Binkley's version was no better.    

The food ranged from atrocious to merely passable. My first course was a "salad" of a couple of specks of hearts of palm and a few morsels of dates strewn across my plate without dressing. The waiter made a huge deal out of my not finishing the course and this would repeat every time he came to take a plate away as the food never improved. He would then take my plates into the display kitchen so that Chef Kevin could see I was not eating most of his food and he would ask the waiter why. I could hear and see all of this. The staff and the chef made me feel extremely uncomfortable about not liking their aspirational food.

Then the guy with the bread appeared. It was like they hired the Hunchback of Notre Dame to schlep bread from table to table. I wasn't expecting a model, but this guy looked like he was in a work-release program. Watching him limp to the table and speak through his snaggle teeth was too much.

I was not the only diner made to feel bad. The same gal who had the water spilled on her earlier informed the waiter that she wanted to cancel the desserts for her table. The Front of House Manager intervened and said he would have to talk to the kitchen.  He came back and guilted them into getting their unwanted desserts because the kitchen had already fired them. Mr. Dense could not seem to grasp that the poor woman just wanted to end her dining ordeal. As soon as the woman said she wanted to cancel the desserts, they should have been thrown into the garbage. As the evening progressed, more and more tables tried to cancel their desserts because the meals were so drawn out. Every time, they were either guilted into waiting for the unwanted desserts at their tables or having them packed in uber-elaborate doggie bags.

By the time our disappointing desserts arrived, I was just glad to be at the end of this mediocrity marathon.  

The final tab for this cluster?  Just shy of $500 for two. If Binkley's was in a metro area with true fine dining like L.A or San Francisco, this place would already be shuttered. 

So we left and I assumed we could put this whole terrible experience behind us. A few days later my phone rang and it was Binkley's calling. I was informed that the Chef noticed that I had issues with the food (implying that I just didn't appreciate his faux haute cuisine).  I declined to book another reservation (on my own dime).    

My advice for a romantic dinner? Skip this train wreck and enjoy a superb dinner at T. Cook's at The Royal Palms. It won't be true fine dining, but you will avoid the abomination that is Binkley's.

This review is long overdue. The first business I dealt with when I was buying a house in Las Vegas was Bugsy's Blinds and it was a great experience. I found Bugsy's on Yelp and Yelp did not disappoint. Aside from the reviews, Bugsy's had way more options than the other companies, could deliver them quicker and at better prices so that's why I decided to go with them. 

I was buying a house that didn't have a single blind or shutter. I had temporary paper blinds shielding my house from the hot Vegas sun throughout. That was a situation that needed to be rectified immediately so I called up Bugsy's and they matched me up with Rafael. He became in charge of my account. I communicated to him via text messages and we got the whole process going before I had even closed escrow. Rafael was easy to get a hold of and went the extra mile to help me, which I'll admit, I needed a little extra help than normal because I still lived in NYC at the time.

Rafael knew that I didn't want to be without window coverings for a long period of time. I like my sleep in the mornings and waking up at 5 am when the sun comes up was not something I was looking forward to. Bugsy's was sensitive to that fact and he assured me that they would take care of me and get me my blinds as quickly as humanly possible. Rafael was great to deal with from start to finish. Bugsy's Blinds got the job done right on time, just as Rafael had promised. He even recommended a great trainer whom I've been working out with ever since. I really appreciated that extra personal touch, as I was new to town and didn't know very many people. 

I recommend Bugsy's without any hesitation. The blinds/shutters that they made for my house are very high quality and beautiful. For the quality of that I received, I got a great deal! There were some minor modifications that needed to be done to one of my shutters and they did it expeditiously without any additional charges. 

I was so happy with my experience with their company that I decided to hire them to add solar shades to my bedroom doors. This saves you money on your energy bill as well as makes it blackout dark so you can really get your zzzzz's on. Last I heard, Bugsy's was going to start doing unbreakable glass in addition to all the other services they offer. I will probably be hiring them again to add this security feature to my home in the near future.

Darden Restaurants has recently made a renewed effort to improve the offerings of their Italian inspired Olive Garden. 

We were so impressed, we might be back soon. Really. 

Given the likes of Macaroni Grill, Johnny Carino, Carrabba, Buca di Beppo, Spaghetti Factory (to some extent Margiano's), they have all been stealing market share away from Olive Garden, the so called king of Americanized Italian food. 

Tired of being a late night comedy punching bag, Darden recently made a wholesale upgrades to their menu and I believe brought out their "A Game". http://investor.darden.com/m/#deepLink/%7B%22view%22%3A%22PressReleaseDetails%22%2C%22languageId%22%3A%221%22%2C%22itemId%22%3A%225f329c57-9e8f-469a-8482-758db3cc9d1f%22%2C%22year%22%3A%222014%22%7D. 

If you have somehow missed the differentiation for some of these Italian themed concepts, both Carrabba's and Macaroni Grill aim for a higher demo group. And not a lot has changed over the last ten years since the Times wrote: 

"Carrabba's Italian Grill and Romano's Macaroni Grill, are both far behind Olive Garden in the full-service Italian restaurants... Although both chains are significantly smaller and are outspent by Olive Garden, they aim at a somewhat different customer: one who is willing to spend a bit more on a meal. Reflecting that higher-end positioning, Carrabba's and Macaroni Grill both used chefs to promote their brand." http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/25/business/media-business-advertising-spots-for-carrabba-s-macaroni-grill-try-pull-away.html 

Clearly there's no shortage of opinions regarding which one of these concepts are your favorite. http://www.disboards.com/archive/index.php/t-2641561.html. 

So with all this in mind, we decided to give this former Pillsbury concept another try.  

We arrive on a Friday night around seven-fifteen. Most of the families with small kids were just finishing their entrees. This restaurant actually has a section in the back, cordoned off from the regular patrons for families. Nice. 

We were seated pretty quickly. Our waitress Rebbecca greeted us, asked us about drinks and if we wanted water with our meal. 

One of their menu items, is a choice of six or nine ounce carafes of their house wines.  Rebbecca offered us a tasting from the bottle of Riesling she brought to our table. Clever marketing, very clever. 

We decided to share a 9 oz carafe, skipping appetizers and starting with their famous never ending Salad Bowl (see photo). It's still including in the price of your dinner btw, or soup if you prefer.

My friend Marvin A wrote about Olive Garden as...  "Their Dreck will not make you ill. It'll simply remind you ...... what BLAH Drive-In Dreck taste like. SpaghettiOs would of been a welcomed sight, last night." 

Prior to this evening's experience, we would have tended to agree.  

But the Italian Trio (photo) and Grilled Chicken (photo) were tasty and just as good the next day when we reheated them. LOL

In many ways, Olive Garden is still just a safe, standby type of place. But as you might have noticed, this is a Four Star review. Clearly Darden wants to be taken seriously and this is their best effort to date. 

So is Olive Garden better than Romano's Macaroni Grill, or Carrabba's? True-fully, I don't know. But we had a nice time and the food was good. 

So Four Stars and expect to pay around $30.00 each

I read all the good reviews for this place so I thought I would give it a try.
My friend lives close, so I said I will meet you there.
To see it, you would never think ,oh this place will be great.
It is in a strange shopping center. Right next to Chino Bandito,or something like that. Though I must try that place one day as well.
When you walk in it smells divine!
My friend was already there and had ordered an Ice Tea.
She ended up getting the Chicken lettuce wraps, and I the Gryo dish,which is on a bed of fantastic rice.
We each got the chicken Potato soup. Oh my gosh, everything was fantastic! 
Plus we even got pita bread and they were nice enough to give me hot tea,even though it is not on the menu.
I even got 2 Baklava's to go. Which we had for dessert that night.
So glad I read the reviews or I never would of known about this place.
It is very clean as well, with nice clean rest rooms and lots of parking.

Perhaps it was a bad night or the fact that I ran into an old fling while dining out with the in-laws [awkward!] but I just didn't see or taste the magic that all my Yelper buddies had!  Maybe it was also because in my head, I was expecting Vegas quality but this is just a small casino in Arizona.  Get real, Joyce W.!  :(

We arrived at 6ish for a Saturday Dinner Buffet.  I believe it was $14/pp but I'm not entirely sure since my MIL picked up the bill.  They had NY Strip, oysters both raw and fried, king crab legs, lobster claws, clams, mussels, tilapia ceviche, a fajita station, pizza, a cheese selection, fruits, salads, Asian stir fry, a very impressive dessert bar, et cetera. 

Sure, the king crab legs were plenty and always stocked full but it was all frozen firm meat.  At one point, my brother-in-law asked someone to heat some up for us because it had ice chunks inside.  The raw oysters were sadly not fresh.  I was telling everyone I was going to down at least a dozen by myself.  Two fishy oysters in, I gave up.  You just can't choke down oysters that can't be pried off their shells.  I also ate one with too much horseradish to try to off-set the weird-taste but all I got was a clear sinus from it.  Whoa!  I heard the NY strip with au ju was pretty decent.  I regret not getting a cut because I was starting to feel like an ice cube from all the cold foods I was eating.  I think the highlight was dessert.  Everything was small and dainty and the serving size was perfect since I wanted to try a little bit of everything.  Give me more creme brulee and I'll be a happy camper.  I even had some sugar-free spumoni in honor of Brett B. and Jasmine F.

All-in-all, it was a decent dinner buffet for $14 with an okay selection.  It's a very clean dining area and the wait staff is friendly and on-point with clearing dishes away.  They keep the glasses filled and the tables stocked with wet napkins.

There have been some changes at the DMV and I'm impressed. No more waiting in a long line yay! This new "Dash Pass" system worked well. With the Dash Pass you can text, call or go online and put yourself in the line without having to even go down to the DMV until it's your turn. They will text you with how many people are ahead of you and your estimated wait time and then they send you a command list so you can text back whenever you want to find out things like how long your current wait time is or to let them know if you need more time or even if you want to be taken out of the line. They text you with fair enough warning about when your turn is so you know when to arrive at the DMV and they let you know around that time what window you will need to go to. This is seriously awesome! I never would have thought I'd give the DMV 5 stars, but this new system really worked great for me twice now and the employees were even really friendly. I needed to renew my license so I had to go inside. Usually I avoid going inside since they have the DMV kiosks around town at a variety of places and it's so convenient to stop and register your car at the kiosk and you can do it at any hour. Sometimes though you just can't avoid having to go inside and now it's not that bad having to do so. The snack bar seems to get bigger and bigger and the line of people at it cracks me up, but hey why not grab a hot dog, nachos or cotton candy while at the DMV? When it came time to pay for my license renewal and the lady told me it would cost $41.25 I was shocked. I asked why so much now and she said that I would be getting a license good for 8 years. Say what?!?! Apparently those born even numbered years get the 8 year license and those in odd numbered years that renew will continue to receive the 4 year license until 2017 and then get the 8 year license after that. I kind of like the idea of not having to go back for 8 years a lot. I'm kind of surprised though since people do age differently among other things. I didn't have an issue with finding a parking spot like I have many times before and that was nice. I'm guessing the parking lot wasn't so bad because people are maybe using Dash Pass. I am happy to say that I had a quick and painless experience at the DMV.

I've been coming here for a long time since before when it was Xtreme Sushi and through the new ownership change. I must say that I love it the most now that the new owner(s) has/have taken over. The food is a lot more consistent. They've added some new artwork and chairs which made the atmosphere a whole lot nicer and tied everything together more with the decor. Plus they got rid of the awful grimy menus that had seen better days and have added new rolls, my favorite being the Burn Your A** roll. The Yoshi roll from the past is still on the menu so it looks like they've kept some of the more popular rolls. I'm pretty sure that they will accommodate orders from the old menu in case there's something you miss from before. It's a lot of the same people that work here so that's half the battle right there.

The employees are all great and personable. It's very much like the tv show Cheers type atmosphere. Once they get to know you, they will roll out the red carpet, including remembering your name and what you order to make you feel at home. I'm just waiting on my little name plaque at the sushi bar where I always sit. ;)

It's the little things like this to consider when there are so many other options for AYCE sushi in Las Vegas. They really care and appreciate your business here. Therefore, I vote in favor of trying out this local gem.

PS: Why in the hell did someone upload a photo of their dog in their review of this place? I love dogs like the next person but seriously? WTF!?

No f-ing way.  Over an hour's wait and $43 later, only to realize that you're getting this crap from such a highly praised buffet?!?!

I dined at the Wynn buffet when they first opened over 3 years ago and wasn't impressed then, and I am not impressed now.  Let me break it down for you:

* Seafood station: the only worthwhile item of the bunch were the freezing cold crab legs.  You could only find smoked salmon and shrimp cocktail here -- whoopdeedo.  No raw oysters will be found here.

* Sushi: three types of "pseushi"  (Ken K.) consisting of California rolls, vegetarian rolls, and last but not least, Salmon maki rolls.  No sashimi, no nigiri.  They even had this pathetic seaweed salad that was 10% seaweed and 90% celery.  Oh, and not to mention they offered kimchee, because kimchee is so appropriate for sushi.

* Carving station: prime rib, turkey, and rack of lamb.  Everything was fine here, except for the angry carving station lady who couldn't cut the meat properly because she was under-slicing the meat, so she kept losing grip of the knife and thus, splattering beef juice on the customers.  She expressed no apologies for splashing beef juice on the nice blouse of the poor girl in front of me.  Not to mention, when I asked for a more rarer lamb chop (seeing that an entire uncut rack was in front of me), she proceeded to give me a well-done lamb chop that was leftover from everyone else's pickings.  How rude!

* Dessert station: alluring desserts that tasted horrible.  Stay away from the dry cupcakes, rock hard poppy seed lemon pastry, mediocre cookies, and way-too-thick crepes.  The ice cream was delish though.

* Other pathetic and disappointing offerings: hummus, baba ghanoush, pita bread, cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, miso soup, and tons of baked bread as fillers.

The only things keeping the Wynn buffet from plummeting to a 1-star review is their beautiful dining area, amazing vanilla ice cream, tasty lamb chops (when given the perfect medium rare piece), and the attentive service.

Take my advice though, and spend your $50 elsewhere.  Las Vegas has so many other great dining establishments that are well worth the money spent.  The Wynn buffet is just not one of those.

If I were on my deathbed, I would request to be wheeled over to eat at Bacio because it would feel like a LIFETIME!!!

I dined here because of a $150 food credit.  With so many quality restaurants in Las Vegas, the ones at The Tropicana aren't on the top of my list.  They're not even on the list.

But color me surprised when I saw their 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings for only $39.  Hey!  That made "restaurant week" look expensive.  It's a shame we didn't even get to the third course after 2+ hours.  I felt even worse for the couple from Italy at the next table playing the same waiting game.  Why in God's name would actual Italians eat here?!?!  

Their saving grace was that the food I did try was actually decent.  The "Risotto Capesante" with scallops, asparagus and prosciutto paired with a crispy white wine was surprisingly good.  I would've been happy with this dish as all four courses.  The "White Peach" salad I received over an hour later was also good but the wait made it taste a little less good.  My dinner companions ordered a la carte and got the veal parmigiana (huge and juicy) and shrimp risotto 90 minutes after ordering.  If they actually got this whole "serving food in a timely manner" down, Bacio wouldn't be a half bad place.  

What the heck was going on in the kitchen??  My guess was the chef suffered from narcolepsy.  We had less than 35 minutes to make a 10pm show at Caesars Palace.  I spoke with the manager to express my displeasure and he took the 2 course dinners off the bill.  The server was super nice, apologetic and took care of a round of drinks too.  At least they made an effort to make it right.  They then boxed up our last two courses of lobster gnocchi (rubbery) and apple granola cheesecake.  The dessert then melted in my car and went straight into the garbage.

Another bookmark bites the dust! I actually bookmarked this place a long time ago after seeing someone post a picture of a yummy looking pastrami sandwich, which I knew my husband would love trying. When we walked in and I saw they had pizza and other stuff on the menu I was excited to give this place a try. They had the typical "pizza by the slice" sitting out on the counter as well the same thing with the garlic knots. I don't mind when pizza is sitting there and gets re-heated, if it is good pizza it can handle it. What I don't like is when it has actually been sitting there for hours. With this place being located across the street from UNLV, I would figure if good pizza is put out here, it wouldn't last long with a college crowd around. I love trying garlic knots from different places, but just couldn't do it here since they looked greasy and like they had been sitting there for a long time. Bummer.

I just asked for a regular slice of cheese ($2.25 each) and a Sicilian slice ($2.50 each) to-go. The regular cheese slice was almost not edible. The slice had too much cheese on it weighing it down and when I picked up the slice it immediately flopped. No folding with that slice! It just lacked any "wow" flavor for me. The Sicilian slice however was perfect. The crust was crisp and chewy where it needed to be and I enjoyed every bite. I'm really glad I tried both because just trying the regular slice wouldn't have me wanting to come back. I don't usually see places that sell Sicilian by the slice so that is a bonus plus the fact that it tastes legit. 

They have Boar's Head lunch meat for sale and a variety of sides. Inside appeared clean and there are tables or booths inside and tables outside. Catering is offered. Delivery is offered.

Dang, Cantina Laredo - I wanted to like you so hard!  Like a hot date that ends in a restraining order, like an incredible hike that ends in poison oak or skunk spray - I've walked past this place for years, imagining a swanky, high-end Mexican food joint behind the dark windows and high prices; sadly, what I found was a very regular, uninspired restaurant serving up some rather meh Mexican food.  This was a 'man behind the curtain' Wizard of Oz moment for me.

Good things?  Mmmmmm - the warm spicy salsa which they serve along with another milder cold one (not so good) and chips is the reason this place gets 2 very enthusiastic stars from me - SO DELICIOUS!  It was hook-me-up-to-a-feed-bag delicious.  Service was quick and pleasant.

After that though, it all goes downhill.  Being vegetarian, I can 99% of the time find something meatless and tasty when I go out to eat but there were very few such options here.  I ended up selecting the Enchiladas de Espinaca and subbed in a Cheese & Onion one to shake things up a bit (I know, I'm very exciting).  When my meal came out, the waitress said she had the kitchen put zucchini alongside my Mexican rice instead of beans (wtf - who in their right mind opts out of beans for zucchini at a Mexican food restaurant?!); so began the first of my meal modifications - I might note here that while being veggie, I am a pretty low-maintenance diner.  So, just as the black beans are being brought out, I realize the sauce atop my cheese enchilada consists of red chili with beef chunks - again wtf - in my 31 years of life on this earth, no Mexican food joint I've ever visited has ever converted a cheese enchilada to a meat one via the sauce!  The waitress said they could make me a new cheese & onion with sour cream sauce atop (cringe).  The mushroom and spinach enchilada was kinda gross - something about the oil they used to saut the spinach in gave it a strange taste and the button mushrooms looked like they had been plunked into it straight out of a can.  The zucchini and cheese & onion enchilada were nothing I would ever want to order again.  Black beans were alright - hard to mess those up though.  

In defense of Cantina Laredo, if you're a big meat eater, perhaps you might have more luck here than I.  The place was clean, the workers were nice, the one aforementioned salsa is killer.  But this place is neither authentic nor new-agey Mexican, not worthy of the steeper price points, and certainly lacks any great ambience to carry the lackluster food.  Don't think I will be auditioning this place for a second date or hike - would strongly consider rolling around in poison oak or getting skunk sprayed over coming back - it was that bad.

Haven't been back in over 5 years and the menu is pretty much the same.  The Travelzoo deal they currently offer (pay $80 for $149 worth of food/alcohol) made a revisit a total no brainer.  The restaurant's appearance even looks about the same.  There's lots of red dcor and the bigger rooms were curtained off since there were less than 10 tables being used.  

There's good value to be had at Envy.  Most appetizers were less than $15 and all the entrees include mashed potatoes and sauted brussel sprouts with bacon.  But when armed with the deal I had, it was all about the $55 "Grand Seafood Plateau".  Lobster, prawns, oysters, mussels, clams, king crab legs....is it possible to get high off of seafood?  I think I did!  Everything was super fresh.  The prawns were enormous, lobster was tender, and I really liked the added garlic to the clams.  This would cost at least 30% more on the strip.  

All the sides we had were excellent.  There was a plethora of lobster in their version of this mac and cheese staple.  This was a highlight of dinner and a ridiculous steal for only $7.  We also had the wild mushroom medley and grilled asparagus.  Our friendly server, Nicki, must have seen several takeout boxes in our future.  

I was least impressed with the steak.  The 12oz bone in filet was 3 stars at best.  Even though $44 was a reasonable price for this type of cut, there are too many great steaks options in LV to say this was any more than passable.  I might not even order steak on my next visit.  

The staff raved about the "Envy Signature Sea Bass" as many Yelpers have so I might give that a shot.  Their "Grilled Pesto Prawns" and "Vegetarian Oven Roasted Stuffed Tomato" also caught my eye.  Entrees like these would be totally ignored at any other steak restaurant, yet Envy might only really be a "steakhouse" in name.  The steaks only take up small bit of their menu while so much of it is non-beef.       

They would be a clear nominee if there were ever a "Best of LV" category for "Steakhouse for people that don't like steak".  3.79394278797982938641112493 stars.  Round up!

Meant to stop in for happy hour apps and cocktail, but instead tried their Restaurant Week $30 three-course menu (app, entree, and dessert) and a glass of house wine (cabernet or pinot grigio), or draft.  I decided to try the Goat cheese-stuffed Peppadews, the Malbec burger (comes with Salut fries), and Chocolate cake, with a glass of cabernet to compliment the burger.

I've had peppadews stuffed with goat cheese before (at Fez), so I knew these would be tasty.  The peppers were raw (as opposed to the roasted peppadews at Fez, or that's how I recall them to be, anyway), so they added crunch to the experience, and were stuffed with a sweetened goat cheese filling, then sprinkled with herbs and drizzled with a very mild-tasting vegetable oil.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=H7ExguXj2xipVp4CTDxM4Q#H7ExguXj2xipVp4CTDxM4Q  I ate two of the four peppadews (to pace myself for the coming burger and dessert...).

I ordered the Malbec burger without mushrooms and tomatoes (allergies), and while Maham forgot to ask how I liked the temperature, she said she asked for medium ("red in the center"), but the burger arrived without any hints of pinkness at all.  However, it was still juicy and tender.  The bun was good- looked and tasted like it may be supplied from a local bakery.  Without the mushrooms and tomatoes to temper the sweetness from the caramelized onions, this burger tasted almost too sweet.  No matter- I just took a few Salut fries, shoestring fries topped with feta and parmesan, which leant the saltiness to counter the sweet onions.  Loved the citrus vinaigrette drizzle on the fries- YUM!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=AiLPBPynnsej5zssNM6x1g#AiLPBPynnsej5zssNM6x1g

For dessert, I had my choice of S'mores, cheesecake, or chocolate cake, and I almost can never say no to chocolate cake, especially when the description mentions a drizzle of both chocolate and white chocolate sauces, but as you can see, my dessert only came with a dark chocolate drizzle.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/salut-kitchen-bar-tempe?select=58Yym4133_Nrx9H61x2M4A#58Yym4133_Nrx9H61x2M4A  My sadness was only fleeting, as I tasted my first bite... oh, this cake tasted definitely of homemade dark chocolate batter, sauce, and ganache filling and frosting!  (No use of powdered sugar, cornstarch, or corn syrup- I asked!)  One of the best-tasting chocolate layered cakes I've tasted in a long time, complete with semi-sweet mini-chocolate chips on the outside edge...  Not very sweet, so I ate about half of it- oops!  :)

I hadn't planned on participating in Restaurant Week this season, but I'm glad to be able to recommend Salut's participation.  Thank you, Salut and Maham, for making RW fun again!

I have had this place bookmarked for a while and am glad we finally tried it. I felt like deep dish pizza and heard that North End puts out a good one. Walking inside we were greeted and told to sit anywhere. Looking around there were many pictures on the wall of movie posters and different sporting events as well family history of the owner and her family. A lot of Boston decor! The owner, Claudia, was there at a table not only eating, but saying hello to each customer and making sure they were enjoying their food. Claudia has her dad make the pizza dough at his restaurant in Boston, and then ships it to Las Vegas for use here at North End Pizza. Her mom makes the pizza sauce locally from her secret recipe.  

We started out with an order of "Garlic Knots" priced at $6.50 for an order of 12 knots and sauce. These weren't traditional since they were *not* in a *knot*, but more a disc if flavorless dough. With all of the seasoning on them, I didn't get it and would not order them again, knowing where I can get authentic ones at other restaurants in town. 

For the main course I ordered a "1/2 Ricotta & Garlic 1/2 Sausage Pizza" priced at  $22.99 including toppings. I ordered the Sicilian, which requires an hour for prep/bake time. If you know you want this then you can just call ahead and have them start it for you. The Sicilian only comes in 16 inch size. I really enjoyed this pizza! I tasted nothing but garlic on my half so I don't know where the garlic flavor was on the knots? The pizza dough was nice and thick and cooked thoroughly. We had more then enough left to take home for another meal! I want to come back and try their thin crust pizza next.

You can come in and buy pizza by the slice or try out some of their calzones, pasta, salads, sandwiches or appetizers. North End offers delivery/dine-in/carryout. 

Mon thru Sat: 11 am - 9 pm
Sun: 12 pm - 9 pm

Talk about some hearty healthy food but with flair since my first impression walked in was is this ultra lounge for body builders or workout fanatics. Really not often you walk into health conscious restaurant see lounge area that can sit down got just about every fitness magazine laid out for reading pleasure (from muscle & fitness, just about every one can think of) but yet still have bar stools and tables relax have meal. One more thought with different. If ever lost in the world of fitness or IFBB need too know who current just walk into the bathrooms. Think kind of weird but too each his own. 

Now what really matters the food. It was my first time so really had no idea direction too go. It decent size menu so had just about every healthy option can think of. I like  the way the menu is structured from bowls, salads, burgers, and drinks. Each list typical healthy options comes too if want switch around protein, carb, add, or build your own healthy creation. I stuck with standard since was my first time. I went with the Southwest Bowl and Berry Jubilee for my drink. The Southwest Bowl was AAAwesome! I went with whole wheat pasta for my carb choice between brown rice, quinoa, or whole wheat pasta. I loved the fact that it was HEARTY healthy bowl. I always associate healthy with bare minimum of portion. At Protein House not cheating you out of your protein/carb! The top sirloin was cooked too my exact temp and combine the avacado, roasted tomatoe, roasted red pepper, cheese, and black bean salsa. Nice light sauce neither oily, greasy, and just light/refreshing pasta bowl. I could eat healthy everyday. It between pricey and cheap so not sure if could eat Protein House style healthy everyday. But without doubt you get the most bang for your buck hands down compare too other health restaurants. Look forward too trying more of the menu.

The service was fabulous. One that make point not too go at the last second. Really wanted too try Protein House. 30 minutes is broader line. The whole staff never rushed us although my guilty conscious made me eat faster... Even when I apologize when we first walked in asked if ok they greeted us with smile and walked us through the menu for newbies.

WOW! What a terrific find this place turned out to be.  During our recent trip to Las Vegas, we decided to stay at the Monte Carlo and low and behold this little gem of a coffee shop was right downstairs off the casino floor.  

After a long trip in the day before, including a late night show it was time for a quick pick me up.  We headed downstairs to Samablatte and decided to order a couple of drinks to help wake up a bit along with a couple of pastries for a light breakfast.  The staff here is very friendly and the menu is as diverse as they come for these type of places.  They offer everything from your standard drip coffees to blended drinks, teas, smoothies, pastries, sandwiches etc...

My wife went with the hot mocha and a scone while I opted for the hot white mocha and a apple turnover style pastry.  The drinks were FANTASTIC and definitely hit the spot (although I wish they were a bit bigger or came in multiple sizes).  My wife thought her scone was OK but the apple turnover was really good and filled with lots of apple.  Normally we are not big connoisseurs of the hot drinks but these were really good.  So much so that a return trip was made the next morning prior to our departure back home.

Trip two saw my wife get the same drink again but this time I went with the Penguin Hot Chocolate (White and Milk Chocolates).  This could possible have been the greatest hot chocolate I have ever had if not the best in all mankind, a definite recommendation.  The place has a great vibe to it, plenty of seating (both indoors and out) and is the perfect place to come down and hang out with a laptop and utilize the WiFi (only available on two floors of the Monte Carlo).  We are already missing this place bunches and will definitely be back here again  the next time we are in town.  My only regret is not trying it the day we got in as I would have loved to have tried the blended drinks or the incredible smoothie that was also on the menu.  If you love coffee then try this place out, it;s more than worth the trip.

While in the area, hubby and I decided to stop here for lunch. They have a drive-thru and chairs/tables outside. Their location on Decatur has only a drive-thru and walk-up window (seating outside), but at this location you can walk inside to order and they also have a dining area. I noticed a $14 for $20 yelp deal upon checking in, so I purchased it. The guy who took my order was very nice, but had some issues figuring out the yelp deal. He called the manager and it all got straightened out. 

The portions here are big, so hubby and I shared. We started out with "Fried Mozzarella" priced at $8.69 for the large and side if sauce. These weren't bad at all, but not the best I've tasted either, above average. I've had the "Garlic Romano Fries" from the Decatur location and loved them, so at $4.59 I ordered them with a side a Sammy's Sauce. The fries here were consistent with the ones I had previously, so they tasted great! Next I enjoyed my half of "The L.A. Pastrami" priced at $10.79 for the large. The pastrami was very tender and had good flavor. It also has mustard, pickles and cheese on it. This sandwich even comes in a extra large size! Even their small sizes are fair, so if you get a medium size or larger, it's very possible you could share with someone depending on your appetite. This place is definitely worth giving a try!

Monte Carlo is an affordable hotel in near the center of the Las Vegas Strip.  This hotel had been renovation few years ago, pump the hotel class from 3 1/2 stars to 4 stars.  It located north of New York New York and next to Aria.  

Parking structure is easy in this hotel; you can easily access to the self-parking lot and can walk to the hotel in few minutes of walk. The parking escalator was fill with cigarette smell; I did not bother going back then.

The hotel room elevator is located across the lobby, the nice thing you do not need walks by the casino.  The room's elevators are separate by three different floors level.  That was good-crowed control. Our group came just right before the standard check in time 3pm in Sunday.  There has was about 20 peoples in the line, took about half hours before it was our turn.  The clerk was helpful and we were able to get a high floor level as we request.  The view was the city center (Aria, Vdara and the pool) It was good view despite this just a basic room.  At top of that our 2 booked room were together and also in a corner.  You would always wanted corner room if want peace in Zzz.

The room is modern; there is a big 42-inch flat screen.  However, sadly the channel were not in HD, make it look worse than SD.  One of the room amenities included 2 K-Cup Coffee Pack and two water bottles.  Those were included with the resort fee, which cost almost $23. I wish there is Wi-Fi in the room, only wired is available.  To use Wi-Fi has to go down to lounge level. The room was clean and everything was functional.  The bed and the pillow were very soft, perhaps more than the way I like it.  I had trouble sleep with the bed had to take another night to get used to it.

Their casino floor is modern as well; I was impress with their sport betting room.  Look more modern than five star hotel like Wynn.  The smell of the cigarette is not strong in the casino floor, unlike some other casino I been to.  There is free tram access to Crystal Center, Aria, and Bellagio. wish it also link the tram to Excalibur, so it can access to the southern strip.

Overall, this is good hotel consider the price.  You are only paying half or one third cost of nearby 4 or 5 stars hotel.  While is still in a decent near center strip location.  This hotel can be good choice for family or those who want some peace after some crazy night in club and other activities.

It's pretty close to 3.75 stars.  

They offer a few dishes most AYCE sushi joints don't like ribeye Big Wong style, fresh oysters,  and kushiyaki (meat on a stick) options like bacon wrapped scallops.  It's actually a good place to bring that one friend who dislikes sushi.  I also like the all you can drink beer/wine/sake option for $10 more but they said they're going to change it next month.  Ummm....why??  

This location used to be Kaizen and you can definitely tell from the look of the place.  Interesting mix of old and modern and the long tables definitely encourage groups to stay a while.  We sat at the bar to pick the chefs brain on recommendations.  The whole staff was Korean.  Not too much of a big deal for me.  

Sushi standouts were the halibut and super white tuna nigiri.  The chef, Alex, said it was the freshest fish they had and it was great.  There were a ton of great options if you like cream cheese, rolls deep fried or something in unagi sauce.  I am not one of those people but knock yourself out a la Drago vs Creed if you are.  Basic rolls were fine and the freshness was acceptable.    

I was really intrigued that they offered both miso and tonkotsu ramen.  I just HAD to try half a bowl of tonkotsu made by Koreans.  The noodles, broth and 2 big pieces of pork belly were pretty good but it wasn't exactly Japanese ramen.  Koramen?  Alex took pride in the fact he made the broth from scratch as he should..it was tasty but not Japanese by any means.  

Service was definitely on top of things.  There were 3 waiters checking on us throughout the meal and earned their gratuity.

"You don't win friends with salad."   Homer Simpson

I'm not sure how the quote fits but I've been wanting to use it for a while.  Anywho!  Crepes.  Those delicious thinly cooked pancakes with yummy stuff packed into them.  Who doesn't love a good crepe?  

So the Lunch Bunch had a long overdue brunch and we've all been dying to try the Crpe Bar for quite some time.  Led by the majestic Brett B., sans his jorts fashion, we had a reservation at 11:30am for a party of six.  Two party poopers didn't show but that didn't stop us from having a straight up feast-party.  We all had checked-in and used the handy Yelp check-in offer for some Maya Tea.  After a quick "Cheers" or "Okole maluna" as twinsie Nadine C. of Honolulu has taught us, we gave our incredibly charismatic and knowledgeable waiter Cody the most difficult 5-minutes of his life.  Seriously, how can four people have such difficulties when ordering?

For savory crepes, we had ordered an Andouille Sausage, Maple Butter with Pork Jowl, Basil Chicken, and the Grand Prix with Duck Egg [thanks for letting me order this even though it was past 11am and sorry Julia A.!  I wanted Brett to try a duck egg!].  For sweet crepes, we had two Vanilla Bean Custards, a Lemon Drop, and a First Time.  We also got to try a Radish dish from Joe's at Agritopia Farm with cultured butter, smoked salt, and lime; homemade Rolos with vanilla bean custard, caramel, and a banana chip crumble; and some sinfully decadent, salted, dark chocolate with a creamy caramel sauce.  

Although we all ended up sharing and picking off each others plates, my dishes were the Grand Prix with Duck Egg and the First Time, all of which were recommended by Cody.  Everybody had some pretty amazing dishes but I felt like I had the best [sorry y'all] dishes of the day.  The Grand Prix was like something out of Iron Chef Michael Symon's twisted head.  It  was a coffee crepe with giant pieces of juicy pork belly, maple-glazed pork jowl, and an upgraded sunny-side-up duck egg.  It was sooo incredibly rich and so fattening but absolutely delicious.  The pork belly was just literally melting under my fork.  I'm so glad there were three companions I can pawn off my pork belly to because oh lawdy!  Where's my siSTAR Aline N., Marc M., his cat Flash, and Vincent D. to share this with?  I seriously hope a cardiologist doesn't need to be called in because whoa!  Of course I ended up being thirsty all day since it was rich and salty goodness but it was well worth it.  I think I'll have salad until Thanksgiving now.  As for the First Time, well, I'm glad I had my first time with Ann R., Linh L., Brett B. [that cheeky monkey], and Cody.  ;)  That Nutella and banana brulee man...  Enough said.

All in all, I had definitely one of the best damn lunches in a long while and I definitely will be stopping by again.  I promise I won't throw my menu and stuff this time.  The wait time for your food to come out can be a tad of a wait but it's only because it's so busy and because their food is so damn good!  The wait is easily bearable when you have the best group of friends ever.  Feeling so lucky today!

Whenever I think of Lenny's Burger, I think of that urban myth about ecstasy. 

You know the one.

"If you have sex on ecstasy, you'll never be able to enjoy it sober." 
 
Why, because the experience is that intense, or because you're brain has been so fried that you can't realize you've spent the last twenty minutes trying to fondle a rock? 

And why the fuck are you dropping this on me now? Like I'm not stressed out enough worrying about how a ouija board works and whether or not Mountain Dew depletes your sperm count. Shut up, you.

Lenny's Burger is the ecstasy of hamburger joints.

You go in there not expecting much. Perhaps even a little condescending because you're so fucking spoiled you don't know any better.

"Ha! Look at this ironically low-end establishment! Why, they don't even have a value menu! Bush league! Oh, how cute. They expect you to pump your own condiments. What, couldn't afford the little packets? Ha. This shall be a good laugh."

And then you order, I don't know, for argument's sake, a double-patty chili burger. And fries. And let's just say that, for shits and giggles, you fill your drink cup up with horchata, because it's my fucking scenario.

You bring your order back to your table. Ha. How quaint. Burgers served in a noisy steamy cafeteria setting. How retro. 

One minute you're biting into a slab of meat in between some bread.

And the next you're in fucking Willy Wonka land.

Your taste buds suddenly become Charlie and Veruca and Augustus.

HOLY SHIT THIS BEEF TASTES LIKE IT CAME FROM A REAL ANIMAL! AND THIS CHILI'S FRESH! THE BUN IS TOASTED! JESUS TAPDANCING CHRIST, THESE ARE THE MOST AMAZING FRIES EVER! I'VE NEVER HAD BURGER JOINT FRIES THIS GOOD! AND THIS HORCHATA FUCKING ROCKS! IT TASTES JUST LIKE I IMAGINE HORCHATA WOULD TASTE!

And believe me, muchachos, if there were snozberries on that burger, they would taste like snozberries.

By the time you've finished your burger, you already crave one again.

You spend the next few weeks trying to convince your friends to try it with you.

"Dude, you have to try this burger place. They have the most amazing fuck me burgers ever! Seriously."
"Nah, man. I'm good."

WHAT!? Bitch, you did not just turn down a suggestion from an Elite!

Weeks later, you find that nobody wants to try this place.

Because they're all trying to get clean.

They're trying to cut back on the fast food. Get on a good diet, go vegan, cut out the refined sugars and carbs or whatever the fuck it is that people with a nutrition book do.

It's not you. They're not turning YOU down.

They just know. They know because they've seen it happen.

One Lenny's Burger and suddenly they're lives will go out of control all over again.

One bite of a double-patty country burger with cheese and chili fries and suddenly they'll start double-dipping and eating right before they go to bed, and years from now they'll be wearing those electronic belts that zap the fat off of you while they get their cry on to a very special episode of Maury Povich.

It's just you and Lenny's now. 

You'll do your best to be stoic about it. Eating alone while tables of laughing hipsters and married couples enjoy their hearty meal, stopping to give you the occasional look as they slowly decide in their minds what could possibly be so wrong with you as to force you to eat your meals alone.

"Just come with me once. I'll pay for it."
"No thanks. I'd rather do McDonald's."
"WHAT!? Didn't you watch Super Size Me?"
"Actually, I just did. Now I want a Big Mac."
"Fine...just this once."

Go on, buddy. Try and enjoy that, what do they call it, a Large N' Delicious? A Royale With Cheese? 

Yeah, I'm sure you like it going in, let's see how you like it coming back out.

Your stomach/intestines aren't fooled. It wants the good shit. It's not going to settle for this "McBullshit" you're trying to feed it.

Just deal with it. You've been bought and paid for by Lenny's Burger Shop. 

You are Bitch Numero Uno.

Awww, don't cry. Ronald McLittleKid'sNightmare didn't like you anyway. But Lenny's Burger, Lenny's will always love you. It will always be there for you. It will never judge you, and will even forgive this little "selling out" phase you went through. It's okay. We all make mistakes.

Now...would you like cheese with that?

Hopefully today you have learned something, and understand the downward spiral that is consumption of actual food.

Be good, stay in school, listen to your parents, and remember, what doesn't give you high blood pressure and diabetes will only make you stronger.

We came here during our recent stay at the Wynn for some late night dessert. They had these huge slices of cake in the display cases, so we figured between the four of us, we could easily polish one off. Now, when I saw huge, I am talking seven layers of cake and seven layers of frosting. Huge.

At $11.95 a slice, it was a little pricey. Because there were so many of us, we justified that it would have been more if we had purchased individual items on our own. So we went with it.

Upon ordering, we were greeted by a fellow named Dylan who was less than helpful. When we asked him questions about the menu, he just shook his head or muttered yes or no. Whatever. My friend asked for a glass of water, he ignored her. She asked again after the transaction, and he slammed it in front of her. Maybe it was us. Nope- the next group of people weren't from the US and were having a some trouble communicating their order. Did Dylan help? Nope. They asked a question about a sandwich and he just pointed to the menu and said, "whatever's up there, is on it." Thanks guy- I'm sure that helped.

Now, only Dylan was less than pleasant. The other lady (who I interacted with while getting some drinks), Denise, was super friendly and helpful. She greeted people at the register, asked if we were having fun and thanked us for coming. Complete difference.

Now, I did take off a star for service (was going to take off more, but Denise was the saving factor)- but the rest of the stars were taken off because of how bad the cake was. We went with the Strawberry Shortcake version that was made with strawberries and white cake. The cake seriously tasted like it had be sitting in the fridge uncovered for quite some time or next to a macaroni salad. It definitely didn't taste like sweet cake- but something that should accompany a salad. I think it was sitting for too long next to too many different ingredients. It acted like a sponge for all the other flavors. Gross.

I guess the cakes in the display case are just for looks- such a bummer that something so beautiful tasted so rancid. For being the Wynn, I expected their standards to be a little higher in food and customer service.

I have had Baguette Cafe bookmarked to try for a while and finally stopped by on my lunch break to try out a sandwich. Baguette Cafe is a bit hard to find the first time. I had trouble locating it since it is nestled with other office buildings, but had the address thanks to yelp and soon found my way. I was impressed with how many tables and chairs there is outside. It was a glorious day out too and many people were eating out there.

When it came time for my order, Olivier, one of the owners was glad to go over the different sandwiches with me. I ordered "The Prosciutto" priced at $6.95 and it came on a baguette. The sandwich had prosciutto, salami, mixed greens, tomato, walnuts, celery and blue cheese spread. The sandwich had a good taste, but the bread was tough to chew and rough on my gums. I have been told by other yelpers that getting the sandwich "panini" style isn't so rough on your jaw/mouth, but wanted to try it how it came on the baguette the first time. I also didn't taste any celery and only tasted one bite of blue cheese and felt the sandwich could have had more meat in it to match the rough texture of the bread, but did I did think what was in-between the bread tasted good.  I also kindly asked him if he would do the honor of choosing a dessert for me to have later. The reason I asked him to chose for me is because I would have went with the same ole thing and I'm sure that would have tasted great, but I wanted to try something different. Sure enough, what Olivier picked out was nothing I would have picked on my own and now after having it, I was left craving more.

Should you want to cater breakfast or lunch for your office, Baguette Cafe can handle that for you. With the right amount of notice they can deliver and set up the food so call and ask for details. 

If you are feeling like an omelet, sandwich, wrap, soup, salad, fresh juice or even a latte, they have that too.

Ok so before I go on with this review, I need to tell you first that I am not too much into sushi except for your basic California rolls. With that said, what I always wanted to do was try ALL types of sushi. My reasoning is that why try different types and pay for each roll. What if I dont like that roll? So the best answer was to do an all you can eat! Pay one price and try everything! Well everything that you can eat anyway. I heard if you have leftovers they charge you. So my plan was to go with friends and team up!

So, this place has a buy 2 all you can eat, get one free! Split the bill three ways and you're set! They have this special I think starting at 9 pm. Call them for more details.

Now for the food. OMG! First of all, I didnt know there were lots of different sushi combinations and they all have different names. For this place you got sexual inuendos as names. How fitting for a sushi virgin. Names like sex on the beach, ex boyfriend/girlfriend, and 69 are just some of the options. Hay, im not making this up! I tried a lot of different rolls my friends ordered. Of course we were not able to order everything. 

Service was good. I didnt have any thing out of the ordinary to complain about. We got what we ordered in a timely manner. Refills were constant. Our server answered all my questions quickly and even had some suggestions. 

Everything I tried seemed really good. I didnt even bother trying to read what each individual roll consisted of. With the help of my friends, all the selections were really good. I think the next time I will be more assertive in picking my own rolls. For now, this experience was well worth it and I can take it off my bucket list.

So if you have any favorites or suggestions for me, (heck, even a recommendation for another sushi place is welcome so I can compare is fine with me) feel free to send me a message! Im still trying to get the hang of eating sushi! Thanks Sushi Bomb for being gentle!

To call  a restaurant is a huge oversimplification.    is a mix of high-end restaurant, stage show, cooking school, and private dinner party that's completely different from anything I've ever experienced before.

Reservations were hard to get.  Phone calls are a no-go -- and you have to email at least a month in advance.  Even then, a signed form and credit card guarantee are required before the spot is officially yours.  The work is worth it once that beautiful golden ticket arrives in the mail 2 weeks later.  

(There are only two seatings per night, 8 people each.  If you *really* want a seat, it helps to be flexible with dates.)

I went to  on a Sunday night, my last in Vegas.  I showed my ticket to the hostess at Jaleo, and she sat me at a table with the other guests waiting to be escorted into 's secret dining room in the back (which is awesomely decorated like a surrealist's library).  What struck me is how the people visiting  are *not* typical Vegas tourists and gamblers.  Apparently,  is a magnet for critics, bloggers, food photographers, (Yelpers?), and general gastrophiles -- in short, people who adore good food and adore talking about it even more.  It's very easy to make new friends at !

Once inside, we were introduced to Chef Cody Jeffs and his team of sous chefs and servers.  A server took our drink orders -- a glass of Sauvignon blanc for me -- from Jaleo's drink menu.  (FYI,  offers a very elaborate and expensive wine pairing.  Don't feel peer-pressured to order it.  Nobody in our group of 8 did, and everything about the experience was still fantastic.)

Then the show began!  And what a show it was.  Twenty courses of world-class molecular gastronomy assembled before my very eyes.  Throughout the experience, there was lots of banter, laughter, clinking of glasses, and questions and interactions with Chef Jeffs.   may be upscale, but it's completely unpretentious.  It's lots of fun, actually!  (The word I heard most often was "whoa!!!".)

There were too many dishes to detail, but here's the basic rundown of what I tasted:

1. Rebujito cocktail
2. Brazo de gitano
3. Nitro almond cup
4. Barquillo
5. Olives "el vermut"
6. Merienda
7. Crispy chicken skin en escabeche
8. Cava sangria
9. Fabes con jamon
10. Lobster with citrus and jasmine
11. Kokotxas al pil-pil (cod jowls)
12. Lobe of foie gras baked in salt
13. Secreto of iberico pork with crispy squid
14. Torta pascualete with cotton candy
15. Flan with shaved ice
16. Pan con chocolate
17. Arroz con leche
18. Cocoa paper with dried strawberries
19. 25-second bizcocho
20. Chocolate assortment

My favorites?  The merienda (a ham-and-cheese pancake-type creation) and the torta pascualete (a sweet-and-savory cheese dish).  The kava sangia was definitely the most unusual -- a sphere of booze that seems to evaporate milliseconds after I put it in my mouth.  A close second was the 25-second bizcocho (a cone-shaped cake "baked" for 25 seconds in the microwave).  Oh?  And the flan?  I've never had a flan as smooth and luxurious as the flan at .  But really, there isn't a single dish at  that was less than sublime.  Chef Jeffs and his staff deserved their standing ovation.  :-)

All the individual portions are tiny, so 20 courses of them left me feeling comfortably full but not overstuffed.  The staff at  even let me take home the menu (and a bookmark with my own personal guest number on it) as mementos.  The menu changes seasonally, so a new menu awaits those who wait 3 months before visiting again.

Thanks for the amazing evening, .  It's one I'll never forget!

This place sucks ... don't come here.

It gets too crowded.  You won't ever want to come back.  I mean why in the world would you want to go out still after spending a grip of money at another club then come here to spend more?

The music sucks and I can't believe there are people dancing til almost 8 in the morning.  I mean who wants to see strippers come in after working and then spending the money they made here on more alcohol.

I guess I'll give you reasons why I didn't like this place at all ... 

I came with a group of guys ... never again
I came before 4am
I saw too many strippers here
I really hate the music they play here
Interior in Drai's is .... well just check out the website

In case you haven't figured it out yet ... just take everything and make it completely opposite.  

The 1 star rating is really a 5 star rating.  I don't hate this place, I really like it I just don't want too many people knowing about it because the line to get in is insane.  

I didn't come with a group of guys because mostly everyone else wanted to go back to the room.  But if you are coming with guys though, just separate and come in one at a time, you have a way better chance to get in, don't worry ... you'll see your friends inside once they eventually get in.

The only thing that wasn't opposite was the amount of strippers that come here.  It must be the music ... that's what gets me coming back.  Where else can you say don't come before 4a?

For me, coming to Drai's would be like going to the gym.  

You're tired, you don't feel like going.  But once you get there, you forget about all that other shit and you feel great.  Not to mention all the people watching that you'll enjoy while burning calories.

But there ain't ever a line at the gym like there is at Drai's.

I guess I should tell you it's at the Barbary Coast ... yeah, Barbary Coast.

Boba!

Yes, I said boba.  Boba as in "a name for the sweet, chewy, tapioca balls found at the bottom of the Taiwanese bubble tea/boba tea drink."

There are few places that have boba in the Valley, and after seeing a sign out front of Red Kimchi on several occasions, I finally decided to go pay them a visit.

I walked in at an odd time... around 5pm on a Tuesday.  I was heading to a meeting and not sure how long it would be, so I wanted a little something to hold me over until dinner.  The restaurant was empty except for all of their staff sitting at a table in the back eating.  I felt like I was interrupting but once I was in, I wasn't going to turn around and walk out.  I came in for boba and I was going to leave with boba!

I felt kind of awkward as I just wanted a boba to-go, but they sat me at a table while I waited... I perused the menu of boba choices and narrowed it down to either green tea, mango, or strawberry boba.  I asked the guy for his input and he asked if I wanted it to be low cal or not.  When I said, yes, I'd prefer the low cal option, he convinced me to go with the green tea flavor.  Imagine my surprise when he brought me my drink five minutes later and it tasted like ice cream!  I really really doubt it was low cal, but I decided to "suck it up" quite literally... and it was delicious!

I took a menu with me and since then, decided I need to return sometime soon to give their Korean food a shot.  Hopefully when I do, it will be a less-awkward experience.  If you're up for joining me for Korean sometime, let me know!  And regardless, go check out Red Kimchi's boba and yelp about it so I can see what you think!

I've had my hair done by the infamous Kim Vo & I don't consider myself fortunate. You couldn't pay me to go back to him. I gave him two chances but he lost me as a client! Not that he cares because Kim is some "big shot" hairdresser (allegedly). But please allow me to explain because YOU REALLY SHOULD NOT GO HERE!

I thought Kim was a nice guy, so it sucks to have to write this, but this is about hair here & I make my money partially based upon how I look. The results of his work has messed with my livelihood & I'm not happy about it! In short, Kim majorly screwed my hair up & this isn't some isolated incident. I'm completely baffled as to why Kim is a so called "celebrity hairdresser" yet THIS doesn't seem to be common knowledge:

"Kim Vo Firestarter" it's appropriately titled... http://gomezhyatt.com/2010-03-22-kim-vo-firestarter/

I wish I'd read all this BEFORE I went to him because if I had, I would have never let him come within 50 ft of my hair! The whole reason why I went to him was his BS marketing about how he's the "best blonder in the business" & how his blonde techniques are actually healthy for your hair. And I'm embarrassed to say that he caught me with his marketing hook, line and sinker. His PR company must be GOOD at burying info because it turns out that Kim is actually also famous for allegedly burning people & frying people's hair off. You can google all of this info yourself or you will hear it from time to time on Chelsea Lately, as apparently he fried her hair hair off too. Luckily I wasn't burned but I had to cut ties because Kim Vo left my hair in the worst shape that it has ever been in my life after only two visits with him. 

Kim does a GREAT job alright... at packing on the clients like an assembly line! The first time I saw him I was amazed at how fast he works. I was happy with my color but I did notice some tiger striping which was also pointed out to me every time I had a blowout. I think "Who did you hair?!" were the exact words my stylist said when she looked at all the bleeding from the foils in the back section that I was unable to see. But stupid me ignored these warning signs & I somehow thought perhaps it was my fault & that maybe I had tapped the foils by accident while under the dryer. And Kim had me roped in with his lil used car salespitch about how I have to give him a good four visits for my hair to be where it should be. So back I went for time #2 at his salon in Vegas at The Palms. I had been noticing that my hair was sticking up straight every morning like I had been sticking my finger in a light socket so I said something to Kim about it thinking that maybe I should cut my hair even shorter because it was obviously still damaged. Kim talked me out of it though. He related a story about how he was having the same issues with his own hair that morning & that it was sticking up because our hair was short & that we didn't have the weight of it being long to weigh it down. His explanation quieted my concerns & I entrusted him with my hair again. After this visit, my hair condition got even worse & then it finally hit me that HE was the one who was messing my hair up! That's when I started reflecting, & think about it, if he can't even get his own hair right, that is NOT a good sign! And the other thing is that I've had short hair before & I never had issues with my hair sticking up straight like it did under his care. So yeah, the length of my hair was not the problem. It was Kim Vo that was the problem. And let me just say, he is FIRED & officially off my Xmas card list! He's actually lucky I'm not waiting for him in a dark alley to show him my wrestling moves & brass knuckle phone case demonstration, LOL!

And now that I'm done with him, it's crazy how many horror stories I've heard about Mr. Vo which lead me to the articles/shows talking about how he (allegedly) burns people & fries hair. And I also heard that he uses some really hardcore bleach on everyone's hair because when he does his little assembly line action it allows him to lift the hair quicker which means mo clients + mo money = win for him. So if these things are true, then to Kim, you are really nothing more than a dollar sign & that pisses me off. The guy doesn't give a flying F#$K about your hair's health & I had to get back on the extension train & spend a lot of $$ to fix what he did. I just wish someone had said something on Yelp &/or this info wasn't buried by PR campaigns because I definitely would have thought twice about going to him. I'm pissed I drove all the way to Beverly Hills to see him the first time & paid a fortune x2, only to have my hair ruined! So that's my story. Maybe you won't have to fry your hair off or ruin it like he's done to me & others (allegedly). It's really a shame because I wanted to like Kim! I just got sucked in to all the hype. If I can save one person from my fate, this review will have been worth it.

I had the distinct honor of dining at Hana this past week under the special care of Lori, the owner.  I should preface this review by stating that I'm a travel and food writer who has traveled to more than 40 countries and all 7 continents....I'm a chef in Dallas...and I was in the top 5 on season 2 of MasterChef.  So the fact that my dinner at Hana was one of the best and most memorable dinners of my entire life should carry at least a bit of weight!  Phoenix, you are SO lucky to have this establishment.

However, it wasn't the first time I had dined at Hana.  Scarcely 3 months before I had eaten sushi there with a local friend while passing through on my way to LA.  For her, Hana is the best place to get sushi in central Phoenix.  I had to admit, I was dubious about eating sushi in Phoenix, but the freshness and perfect presentation of the sashimi we ordered was stunning.  Still...for virtually all their regular customers, Hana is a sushi joint.

My second experience was quite a bit different.  I was a guest of the owner, and she and her chefs took us through a 15 course menu that consisted of both strictly traditional Japanese presentations, and contemporary twists.  For more than 2 hours, the courses kept coming.

They started with small bites...refreshingly simple, yet somehow complex, despite only 5 or 6 ingredients each.  One was a shooter on a base of Meyer lemon with monkfish liver, quail egg, bonito flake, and caviar.  Hot dishes soon followed...tempura lobster with a hot salted tea for dipping.  (It made me cry, it was so delicious.)  A custard of egg white and dashi broth that hid scallops and shrimp and crab at the bottom...so delicate it basically evaporated in my mouth.  (And I cried again.)

There was no sushi on our table.  That doesn't mean there wasn't raw fish!  A mackerel was brought to the table, and we plucked off juicy delicate morsels of incredibly fresh fish.  (It's eyes were so clear it appeared to be looking around the room at me.)  Once we had finished, they whisked the skeleton off to the deep fryer, and returned the crispy bones for us to munch on.

The fact that the chefs at Nana have the skill and ability to produce this kind of world-class meal just blows my mind, when I formerly thought of it as a mere sushi bar.  And the fact that it is BYOB...I thought I had died and gone to heaven.

So here's what YOU need to do, next time you're ready for some food that will blow your mind:

Walk into Nana.
Ask for Lori, the owner.
Tell Lori that Ben Starr sent you.
Tell Lori how much you'd like to spend on dinner, whether that's $20 or $200.
Tell Lori to show you something amazing.

Forget about the menu.  Let the experts decide for you.  Lori will make sure you go home full of food that you will dream about that night, and tell friends about the next day.  Americans are not accustomed to dining this way, which is a shame.  There is a vast trove of knowledge, skill, and creativity hiding in the Hana kitchen.  It would be a crime to go there and order a California roll!

I am still resonating with the memory of this meal.

***The Signature at MGM Grand is a good option if you are looking for an un-Vegas like hotel on The Strip***

The Strip is filled with mostly resort and casino combinations that are themed and/or upscale.  Recently though, new properties have been emerging to offer an un-Vegas like experience.  No casino hotels.  No smoking hotels.  I have not stayed at many of these hotels (The Mandarin, Vdara), but my most recent Vegas stay was at The Signature at MGM Grand (which is business friendly and not like the mega casinos on The Strip).  The Signature is filled with spacious condos that are complete with kitchenettes, whirlpool bathtubs and (in some rooms) balconies.

The Signature is located in the back of the MGM Grand.  It is attached to the MGM Grand via many airport-like automated walkways.  The hotel has very limited services.  There is a small lounge as well as an order-at-the-counter cafe.  For more dining options or expensive convenience store items, you are going to need to make the long trip to the MGM Grand.  This hotel does have its own pool as well as a 24-hour fitness center though it was difficult getting an open machine in the morning.

The rooms at The Signature are nice.  The decor is up-to-date enough and the rooms are comfortable and very spacious.  Rooms come with kitchenettes, a big living area and a table (this creates a great pre-going out spot).  Rooms are also equipped with safes.  Room temperature was nice.

There were a few minor negatives in the room.  It was difficult turning the TV off (it kept turning itself back on).  There were some missing items like no hotel directory to provide information on location of business center, fitness center and such.  No laundry bag either.

Bathrooms are very big here.  Each room comes with a huge whirlpool tub as well as a big glass shower.  Unfortunately, the shower head had a very concentrated blast and not the widespread rain-like shower head many hotels are now featuring.  Getting the perfect water temperature in the shower was not easy either.

Service was fine.

Room rates at The Signature are typically higher than the MGM Grand, but they are not too expensive when compared to other similar properties along The Strip and it is less expensive than several of the upscale resorts on The Strip.

I think how much you like The Signature is going to depend on what you are looking for in a Las Vegas hotel.  If you are looking for a good value room that is big and great for gatherings (as well as not next to a smoky casino), The Signature is a really good option.  If you want a more themed hotel as well as something that is convenient and a quick walk to the many other Las Vegas casinos, The Signature is probably not where you want to stay.

I personally like having some of the niceties of The Signature like the big rooms and the non-smoking property, but given how far it is from The Strip, I would much rather stay at the Renaissance for a more business-like and less Vegas-like hotel experience, where I am getting the lower room rate as well as earning Marriott Rewards points.

Complimentary valet parking is offered.  If you want complimentary self parking, you will need to park at the MGM Grand's parking structure, which is a very long walk to The Signature.

Izakaya Cocokala's menu reflects a lot of what would be found at a typical street corner izakaya in Japan with a couple of wrinkles from the norm.  I was excited to check it out.  Things were looking even better when I was the only non-Japanese patron in a restaurant 75% full on a Sunday night.  That's always a good sign!  

Shocking me right off the bat was being served cold edamame.  Although typical in other places (like umm..Japan?), I've actually met people who grew up in Vegas thinking edamame was always served hot.  Even I expect it to be hot everytime in LV now for chrissakes.  I could tell this place gave a damn about "keeping it real" just from these itty bitty green things.

My wife was ready to order "bakudan" as soon as we sat down.  She thinks natto (fermented soybeans that smell like the foot of a corpse and taste even worse) is the single greatest culinary contribution from Japan to the world.  Cocokala's version included said item, tuna, okra, yamaimo (mountain potato) and spicy mustard.  Mix everything up and go to town because you're a braver person than I.  She thought this was awesome.  

I didn't expect the grilled saba (mackerel) to be my favorite dish but it totally was.  Nice portioned filet with a terrific char, tender meat and the oil from the fish had me considering another order as soon as I finished.  This went very well with their samurai barley beer which was their strongest brew at 10% alcohol.  

I also had a bottle of their stout brewed with oysters which tasted like you'd expect.....super funky Guinness.  My wife loved their Echigo red ale.  All the premium brews are $9-$10 for a 12 oz bottle.  They also have a nice selection of sake and shochu.      

Their chawanmushi (egg custard) was chockful of seafood deliciousness that rivaled Kyara's version.  I also thought highly of their take on black cod miso.  It's everything you'd expect at a very reasonable price.  

Chicken cartilage skewers were something I missed dearly from my days in Japan.  Usually the cartilage is stripped naked of any meat before it's grilled but I kind of liked it better their way with chicken meat still on it.  Cocokala would become my new best friend if they started serving fried chicken cartilage :)

Some stuff didn't make this visit five stars but they're all things that are correctable and are probably due to being so new.  I thought the white meat yakitori were very dry.  The ume jiso (sour plum sauce) kind of masked the dryness a little but the wasabi yakitori wasn't good.  They mistakenly added a grilled hamachi to our receipt.  And instead of being offered a refill of water, the glasses were simply taken away.  

None of these are very big issues.  I am just happy there's another quality izakaya in town!!

This is my 400th review, so I chose a good one.
I keep getting coupons for this place. People I know(friends) say yeah, it is OK. Nothing great. It is alright.
So one day it was raining and cold. I was out running errands and did not want to mess up the house cooking when I got home.

So I had a coupon so I came here to Venezia's!
First I called on the phone to order a large Pizza and some wings.I have been craving Wings,soooo.
Anyway, I got there a little early. Parking for pick up right in front,very nice.
As I sat inside looking around it was clean and well maintained.
Counter for napkins, condiments and such, clean and well stocked. 
They were busy pick up orders, people coming in to get a slice, etc.
They handle it very well. Everyone is calm and it runs very smoothly.

One girl that was cutting Pizza and boxing every thing up made it all look so easy.
She was wearing a hat and had tattoos,I say that because, I do not know her name.
But, she was getting those orders out so quickly and efficiently/ I was amazed how she made it all look so easy. Bravo to her, she rocks.
The smell inside was really good. Italian Food on a cold day smells fantastico!

When We sat down to eat at home. It was fantastic! I love their Pizza. Their wings were meaty and spicy! This is it , I have found my new Pizza Heaven!
I am so excited.

Also I read the menu and took a to go menu home, I can't wait to try all the other items, I am sure they are just as wonderful!

Right across the street from the Hard Rock, Alexis is a non-gaming resort with a variety of suites offered. It was the perfect setting for my slumber party! 

I originally booked a suite at my beloved Hard Rock hotel but I switched to Alexis per the Hard Rock's fine print: $50 additional fee per night minimum per additional guest above two! I know that people sneak etc. But I am not very sneaky! The Hard Rock is also notorious for charging $500. fees for bumping bottles in the mini bar. Party girls can not be trusted with a bump-charging mini bar! 

There were two suites to choose from, the other had a fireplace in the bedroom which would have been great for a romantic couple. I chose mine for its proximity to the parking and pool. Only $78.20 for a last minute Saturday night after tax! Happy wallet! 

I booked the Alexis Park resort for a girl's night out weekend with low expectations. I wanted a spacious suite to make sure my four+ gal pals were comfortable. We had the time of our lives. At least I did!:-) 

The lobby is stunning, with marble floors, fresh flowers, an unlocked grand piano (they let you play if you are a scholar like yours truly) and a twinkling Christmas tree. Check in was a breeze, the service was perfect. Far beyond expectations. (five stars) 

If you have been to Vegas before, you know how long it can take to walk to the car, to the room or to the pool. All the while you are breathing in about ten cartons of second-hand cigarettes, as your senses are attacked by slot machine screams. -No mi gusta. None of that nonsense here friends. None of your glorious party time is wasted. 

After checking in, I drove around to the back of the resort and parked less than 20 paces from my ground-floor two-room suite. (# 2201, I believe it was) Enormous! The marble wet bar is decked out with bar stools, a coffee maker, a stainless steel sink, cupboards-a-plenty and a microwave. The coffee provided was not bad! We loaded up the fridge with bottles of champagne stat. 

Closets galore, a HUGE living room with posh chairs, a couch with a King size pull-out bed, a TV and enough floor space to practice our break dancing moves, which we took full advantage of. 

The amazing vanity area (blow dryer included) provides enough mirror space for two or three girls to primp at once. The bathroom is stocked with premium Body-Shop bath products, quality bath towels and a huge 10 jet jacuzzi tub! Bubble bath- loving girls rejoice! Once again, we took full advantage! 

The bedroom was smartly furnished in taupe, chocolate and beige. A dresser, two nightstands and two Queen sized beds. I hope I have more pictures to post of this suite. I saw some yelp photographs that looked nothing like the place that I stayed. My suite was prefect. (five stars) 

The grounds are lush, the grass is green and ten paces from my suite, there are three pools to choose from. Crazy cold! Julia, you are nuts for making me jump in that thing! The jacuzzi was great, hot, bubbly and serene. Most important: Not over chlorinated. There are large towels available at the pool, tables, chairs and a water fountain. 

The location is about five minutes from the strip. (three stars) I get the impression that the lower-priced suites upstairs and around corridors are not as posh as mine. My advice? Ask the hotel manager to show you what is available before committing. 

If you want to gamble right outside your door? This is not for you. If you come to Vegas sans car, this is not for you. If you want to break dance in your living room, play the lobby grand piano, get to your car or the pool Dukes-of-Hazard-fast, fill a refrigerator with champagne and jump in your Jacuzzi bath tub with your four favorite gal pals after wild nights of dancing? This is for you! 

I had the time of my life here. I have stayed at the Venetian, Paris, Harrah's, Imperial Palace, The Tropicana, Bally's, Cesar's Palace, the Rio and The Hard Rock hotel. This was my favorite Vegas trip EVER. Some things are so fun, they should be illegal.:-) 

Alexis was very recently remodeled and updated. I was one of the first occupants post remodel. The older linens etc. from past photographs are current no longer:-)

Gold Dust Woman

Damn I really hate being THAT guy.  You know, the last on one the bandwagon...before everyone else has already jumped off because it's going down in flames.  Well, because of Lil Brown Sugar's Cupcakes, I officially jumped on board (feel free to exit the cabin at any time).

Over the past 3 weeks, I've sampled probably a dozen flavors and all of them were absolutely spot on.  First of all, if you've read any of my reviews of cupcake places (if not, I will find you and tape your eyelids open), I don't like frosting.  Yeah, I'm odd like that, but my kids love that they get an extra dose of kiddy crack.  These are the only cupcakes where I absolutely cannot pass up the frosting.  They capture the essence of the flavor in the frosting, like how Jelly Belly does in a jelly bean.  Seriously!  Here's a rundown:

1.  Key Lime - Hold your butt cheeks together otherwise you'll shit yourself.  The frosting tastes like a fluffy key lime pie.  Well, not "like" a key lime pie...EXACTLY like one.  I actually ate the frosting before the cupcake.  It so light and fluffy it feels like there aren't any calories, just angel dust.  The cupcake itself had a hint of lime, which was nice, but really, it was second fiddle to the frosting.

2.  Butter Beer - I think this was butterscotch cake batter mixed with cream soda topped with butterscotch frosting.  I'm not a fan of butterscotch, but the flavors were so rich and flavorful.  The cake was a little too dense for my wife's taste, but exactly how I like it.  

3.  Peanut Butter Cup - It was a chocolate cupcake with a Hershey Kiss baked inside, topped with peanut butter frosting.  I hate peanut butter, so this wasn't my cup of tea because it tasted exactly like a peanut butter cup (duh).  On the other hand, my wife and mother-in-law thought this was their favorite of all.

4.  Strawberry Lemonade - One of my favorites.  The cupcake is a strong lemon flavor.  Not tart and not sweet.  Just easily identifiable as lemon.  The frosting was on the sweeter side, so I did scrape off about half, but it perfectly complemented the cupcake to the point where it really did taste like a mild strawberry lemonade.  

5.  Orange Dreamsicle - Just like when Ego eats the ratatouille, my hanabata days memories of eating a Meadow Gold orange dreamsicle came rushing back.  This cupcake was like eating a fluffy one, and without the brain freeze.  Of all the flavors I've tried, this is the most subdued, yet highly addictive.

6.  Chocolate Covered Strawberry - Exactly as described, a chocolate cupcake with strawberry frosting.  Not quite the most memorable, but not too shabby either.  The fact that the frosting is mixed with FRESH strawberries gets points from me.

7.  S'mores - Dude.  Totally tastes like a s'more.  And nowhere near as sweet as a real one.  Chocolate (maybe it was Devil's Food) cupcake with marshmallow whip frosting, topped with crushed graham cracker.  My family still raves about this one.  

8.  Thin Mint Cake Pop - When the lady behind the counter told me it tastes like a Thin Mint, she wasn't kidding.  Sans the snap of the cookie, this thing is choco-minty goodness.  Get two of these and you almost have a box of the real thing.  

9.  Sugar Cookies - I buy these for my rug rats.  Haven't been able to taste them because they're usually gone.  I guess that means they're pretty good.

10.  Red Velvet - Tastes like red velvet.  Although it is exactly as described, I would have to say this is the most boring flavor offered (this statement comes from a guy who LOVES red velvet.  I'm the guy who bought my wife a red velvet birthday cake because hell, if I like it, she better like it too (right?)).  I suggest you do yourself a favor and try anything else in the case.

I would argue that these tasty nuggets don't contain brown sugar.  No, they must have been sprinkled with some gold dust because I'm ready to dig in with my silver spoon.

An incredible steakhouse.   Outstanding food.  Solid wine list.  Excellent service.  Stellar value.

(Sorry this review is long, there is a lot to share).

It's in Luxor.  Stop laughing.  Once you get past the lobby (hey, you can't hide the fact you're in a giant pyramid), renovations have made the casino as contemporary as any.  

Five years and 120+ visits;  Tender continues to impress.  Innovation keeps the menu exciting.  Rapidly changing seasonal specials showoff the chef's commitment to freshness.  

For summer, the heirloom tomato salad with over a dozen varieties of fresh, vine ripened tomatoes dressed in olive oil and sea salt with micro basil and slices of uber fresh, milky mozzarella just incredible.  A full blown tomato party in your mouth.  The salad is large enough for two.

For bison month, a charred bison carpaccio topped with a spicy aioli, arugula salad with roasted peppers and sweet corn finished with a touch of sea salt.  Incredible!

Other killer starters, the charcuterie of game and deli meats (bresaola, finochietta, wild boar sausage, pork coppa, lamb prosciutto and antelope pastrami) with cornisons, assortment of olives and mustard, an excellent take on the classic.  The chilled salmon tasting, a true standout; hot apple wood smoked salmon topped with black truffle "caviar" on a bed of pesto, edamame, and sea asparagus.  Wow!  An explosion of flavors, oily salmon, earthy truffle, herbaceous basil, the back taste of the pine nuts, the crunch and oceanic flavor of the sea asparagus.  Perfect.

Outstanding steaks at all quality and price ranges.  The Bison ribeye is very hard to pass.  Deep meaty flavor, low fat.  JAPANESE KOBE A5 WAGYU.  The real deal.  $95 / 8oz.  I doubted it, I saw it, I tried it.  Yes, yes, yes.  Extremely well trimmed.  Request it cooked below rare.  It's an ethereal experience, seared goodness on the outside, chilled, tender with melting fat on the inside.

Something different?  Wild game platter remains excellent.  Berkshire kurabuta pork chop (order this medium) near perfect heritage pork flavor.  Sweet, tender, and porky!  Finally the bison osso buco; tender perfectly braised, deeply flavored bison on a bed of enriched mashed potato and tangy bbq onions.  Incredible balance.  The marrow is a special treat.

Tip:  check out the sides.  Roasted bone marrow glazed with a veal demi an insane value at $5, Hudson foie for $10.  Add it to any steak or have it alone with some bread as a starter.

Sure, missteps do happen but are always corrected with no fuss.

For the absolute best service on a casual night out, eat at the bar.  Friendly, very knowledgeable bar staff who aim to please.  The music in the lounge a little loud, but it keeps the energy up.

Great wine program with the lowest markup on the Strip.  Huge by the glass pours.  Wines by the bottle near retail.  Check out the Captains' List for clearance wines below retail.

Snub the Luxor all you want, you will be missing a great restaurant.

Ever since the Bellagio opened up on the Strip, their buffet was generally the best in my eyes.  Though the Paris buffet is arguably just as good from what I remember, I always thought what the Bellagio had to offer was the best overall.  Well, until now that is; move over Bellagio, cuz someone has come along and snatched top billing from you.

Now, don't let the trendy and chic decor distract you...there is some serious food being thrown out here.  While you will might assume it's just the generic sorts of items like salad, Chinese food, sushi, pasta/pizza, and carvery items, there is just so much more to it than that.  Rather, you can find more unique offerings like kalbi (Korean BBQ ribs...surprisingly good!), buns with pork belly, gnocchi, risotto, pork loin, beef stews, flatbreads, truffle potatoes, and even a station to build your own bowl of pho.  Seriously, how many other places can say that?  A pho station!  It'd be better if it were a ramen station, but still impressive enough!

What's really cool about the place though is that it's not your usual sort of buffet where you pile a bunch of food on your plate and then go to town.  Rather, like the rest of the hotel, it feels so refined, with a majority of the food being served in small plates, bowls, and mini-pots.  Think like an individual tapas plate buffet.  Pretty ingenious if you ask me since it's probably better at reducing the amount of food that gets wasted or dumped.

The food alone makes the price worthwhile, but it's even more reasonable when compared to the other buffets on the strip.  Considering the quality and choices, it's not too shabby at $28 a head for lunch (by Vegas buffet standards).  Wicked Spoon has pretty much all you could ask for at a buffet, but I have to admit that the long walk back to the main part of the hotel when you've got a stomach full of food kind of sucks.  In any case, Wicked Spoon is wicked awesome (so cheesy, I know).

When I saw this place show up as a Hot New Business on the Yelp frontpage, I thought it was a bit of a silly name.  But it tells you everything you need to know about the business.  Think Subway/Chipotle (Custom Built Sandwich/Burrito) assembly line style ordering, but for pizza.  $8.95 gets you a 12-inch pizza with all the toppings you want.  According to their website:

(4) kinds of sauces
(4) kinds of cheeses, which you can combine together
(7) kinds of meats
(7) kinds of veggies
(7) kinds of toppers, added after the pizza is cooked

Who else sells you a (potentially) 25-topping pizza for $8.95?!  I don't know if I would try it.  Except that I totally would if I could order it without feeling like a bit of a jerk.  Once you order your pie, you'll have it within minutes; these cook fast.  10 minutes after setting foot into the restaurant I had my food!

For my very first custom built pizza I had the spicy diavola sauce, fresh mozzarella, Italian sausage, mushroom, garlic and sun dried tomatoes (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CeqWpwHBoaxwRcv5btnv6g?select=zg2BAK39ZOP7M6bmZmAF7Q#tqe5lahN7SPZZw2mLVaFag).  I can still taste the spicy diavola and garlic in my breath, and I'm quite okay with that.  No gum for me, I'm still enjoying my pizza.  Tasty ingredients all around, and the crust keeps a chewy consistency with a slight crunch.  

You want to ask me out for dinner?  How the heck are you gonna do that?  You can build me a pizza or something.  I am a fan and I will most definitely be back.

My Favorite Vegas Sweet Stop! I got chocolate wasted and wouldn't have minded spending a whole day in this chocolate dream. 

Their chocolate drinks are heavenly. Friend had an italian in a cute hug mug http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=efFt78-ToFIXyJm5ZIjr4g
Dude had an 80s milkshake which was soooo delicious! Love the alice in wonderland "Drink Me" cup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=WslMBkiMScJAM6fOITjHQg

I ADDED BACON to my Guilt Free Omelette (CG style) and this was one of my favorite breakfast dishes i've had in a long time (thanks Janice C!). The omelette had some veggies and cheese, came with a side of potatoes. It came with an awesome sweet biscuit served with a side of butter and a side of milk chocolate!!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=WjX7TqdKnJfQ8_rL21lnNw. The potatoes dipped in the chocolate worked delicious as well. 
Friend had the Brenner Kobe Burger- but didn't swoon over it. But the fries were good. Dipped them in chocolate- even better! 
Shared a apple cinnamon waffle and it came out soo pretty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=ZM1r3Jgh1rIOAd8CLg_w8g
Loved loved the tiny vial of chocolate sauce and the tiny chocolate pearls to dress up our waffles. The Vanilla icecream made it all perfect. 
While waiting for your food, u can check out the boutique inside filled with chocolate galore. The bill even came in the cutest chocolate bar like tin. 
I couldn't leave without getting me the chocolate walnut cookie that Dru C wrote about, at the stand where they also display the chocolate pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=4XrN-0eKjrZ_O1MZPwUwDA, cupcakes and chocolate syringes! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=Y_OtGVh8HWQQzXQcHFcZRg
If u like the texture of Mrs Fields cookies, you will love this one which is 10 times better.I can say this is the best cookie i've ever had! It's $5.00, but it's big and super packed with chocolate and every bite is buttery bliss. Just make sure to eat it right away or if you're gonna savor it bite by bite like me and keep putting it away only to open the bag again to take another bite- get an extra bag cuz the grease will seep through- in the good way of course. 

I cannot wait to go back to get myself a couple more cookies and stay for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

*at the Forum Shoppes at Caesar across from the huge ass H and M store. Mens while ur waiting for your girl at the 3 floor H and M, you can get yourself a chocolate syringe and die happy.

**Review #600: The single best meal I've ever experienced**

To celebrate our one year wedding anniversary, my wife and I ate a feast fit for  royalty at Chef Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak. 

Located inside the MGM Grand, Craftsteak is a dimly lit, elegantly decorated high end steak house. 

The menu at CS is littered with amazing sounding salads, sides, steaks, seafood, desserts and more. Instead of trying one or two things, my wife and I decided to make this meal a memorable one and partake in their Domestic Wagyu tasting, which included a grand total of FOURTEEN dishes in three courses.  Ready?? Here we go;

Course 1- The Warm UP:
Warm Bread Topped W/ Sea Salt http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=znEnAclXg1MNjKCJeOx-pQ

Cinnamon Monkey Bread W/ Brown Sugar Sour Cream Ice Cream & Pecan Toffee http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=12a18ImEp5GMU4k417Nt0Q

Farmers Market Fruit Plate  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=iPcZn31A-sZQZdAPIT5Yzw

Everything and I mean EVERYTHING we ate was phenomenal. Not one dish disappointed me. I've had many meals in my life and this one now ranks as the biggest and best yet. The salads were great. The meat was juicy and melted in my mouth. The sides were fantastic and the desserts were mind blowing. I did have some favorites, which I'll list below. 
My favorite dishes in the first course were the tartare and the warm Frise salad.
My favorite dishes in the second course were the Wagyu ribeye and the Yukon Gold Puree (best mashed potatoes EVER). 
My favorite dessert was the cinnamon monkey bread.

The service here was top notch. We had two separate servers, both of whom were friendly and attentive. Both answered any questions we asked and trust me, we had a few.  

The price for the Wagyu tasting menu was $140 a person, which was not bad considering the massive amount of incredible food we received. In all honesty, I could not afford to do this on a weekly (or even monthly) basis but since I got lucky the night before at the Roulette tables, this meal only set me back about thirty dollars of my own money. Thanks, Vegas. 

If you ever have the opportunity to dine at Craftsteak, even if you can't afford a steak tasting (tastings start at $100 a person), then just order off their regular menu. I can't highly recommend Craftsteak enough. This truly was THE BEST meal I've ever had in my entire life.

The story of two hippies and finally, a great idea.

In a land filled with broken dreams and grumbling tummies, two hippies met while attending a Phish concert. Recognizing each other as hippies by their standard issue, Grateful Dead t-shirts, big daddy; as he preferred to be called, introduced himself to Little "T". In this moment, the clouds parted while angels played their harpsichords and trumpets from a Farmhouse. "Hey, you like burgers?" Little "T" asked big daddy. "Hhhehheehee, of course. You ever seen the northern lights?" asked big daddy.

... fast forward seven years ...  Little "T" finally had a great idea. "Hey big daddy, wouldn't it be cool if there was a burger shop where all the hungry people could come and eat a burger, fries, and a drink for just a dollar?" "No way man, burgers are like heaven and people would pay like, $10 for an awesome burger, fries, and a drink." he replied.

After years of debating and three failed marriages between the both of them, "T" and daddy settled on $5 as a great price for burger, fries and a drink. Today, you can find this $5 meal in Central Phoenix 365 days a year, except Sundays, holidays, between the hours of 8pm and 11am, or from 4:20 to 4:21 -- hippies gotta sleep; and, you know... 
;-)

Stop in for lunch one day (or dinner), order up their daily special, their house bacon cheese burger, or even a hot dog. While considering your options, browse the toppings list such as, fresh jalapenos, roasted hatch chili, caramelized onions, onion rings, house made habanero ketchup, and more. 

Side note to all you spicy food extraordinaires, the habanero ketchup is down-right fantastic. In fact, I think this ketchup steals the show. While greasy burger spots aren't on the normal "bucket list", if you love spicy food and in some weird way make a list of all the places you wish you could try before you die, you NEED to add this to the list. I almost wish I could buy a batch of this stuff to take home - OMG that was spicy!

Oh, the burger and steak cut fries aint bad either ;-) I ordered the bacon cheese burger, sans the tomato, add jalapenos and a side of that delish house made habanero ketchup. It was a burger like none other I've had!

Happy Yelping Phoenix!

Well My Friend, this is a great place to dine at.  It was our last night in Vegas and wanted to dine someplace where we could people watch on the strip.  So after trying to decide between 2 places we went with Mon Ami Gabi.  Since we didn't have reservation and we wanted to sit out on the patio the wait was over an hour.  

We were seated towards the corner and was soon greeted by our waiter Scott.  He was all smiles kinda reminded me of Marc Anthony.  Very friendly and helpful in trying to decide on what to order as he shared the recomendations.

Started off with some drinks and got 2 appetizers.  

Sea scallops gratinees ~ was broiled to yummygoodness I could have easily eaten 2 plated of these.  

Mussels Mariniere ~ Cooked in white wine with slithers of garlic.  They were very good.  

Scallop potato and green beans that came with the Prime rib was very addicting.  The scallop potatoes had a pretty good garlic flavor throughout it was really good. 

Prime Rib ~ This was one huge honker of a prime rib.  Cooked perfectly to a medium rare.  It was juicy and tender.  Mmmm Meat!

Skate Wing ~ One thing I always order when its on the menu.  If you have never had one its like the best of crab, lobster and fish.  Its sooo damn good.  I could have eaten 2 of these things.  Its very lightly pan fried and served with pureed cauliflower.  

After pigging out we needed to settle out tummy so as all reasonably sound person would do we ordered some cappuccino and dessert.

Bananas Foster Crepe ~ It wasn't like the bananas fosters you get in New Orleans but it had the right flavor.  It was very good and with the tasty cup of cappuccino it was the perfect end to a great visit in Vegas.

Eyes ~ Great place to people watch and catch the show of the Bellagio fountains.
Nose ~ Smelling like its gonna be a great dinner!
Ear ~ Its a typical dinner time vibe!
Mouth ~ Really tasty good stuff!
Tummy ~ Everything was tasty good and was totally satisfied!

I have had this place bookmarked for some time, so when given the opportunity to dine here with some fellow Yelpers, I was excited by the prospect. We arrived around noon and the place wasn't too busy. We shared a large number of items from the menu.

Here's a list of all everything we tried:

GARLC KNOTS: Really good. Really small, but warm, flavorful and soft. 
RICE BALLS: These were just ok. I enjoyed them, but they weren't notable. 
LASAGNA EXPLOSIONS - I don't usually like lasagna, but this was a nice change of pace from typical lasagna. Moist and very cheesy.
TRIPE - My favorite part of the meal. I don't typically enjoy tripe, but this preparation was very enjoyable. Not chewy at all and didn't have that tripe-y smell that usually turns me off.
MEATBALLS & ITALIAN SAUSAGE - This dish was ok. The meatballs are huge, however, and I enjoyed the tomato sauce.  
SEAFOOD PASTA IN GARLIC CREAM SAUCE - This dish was just ok. the sauce didn't have enough depth of flavor for me and I don't see myself ordering this dish again if I returned.
SICILIAN PIZZA - I'm not usually a fan of deep dish. This had nice flavor, but it was a little doughy for my taste. Everyone else seemed to love this pizza, so it's just a matter of preference.
WHITE PIZZA - This was one of the standouts. The pizza was seasoned and cooked well. I could have eaten just this dish and been happy. 
EGGPLANT PARM - I absolutely love eggplant, but this wasn't my favorite preparation. Too much breading and the eggplant was sliced a little too thinly for my taste. I do enjoy how they serve ziti instead of spaghetti with this dish, since I'm not a fan of spaghetti.
ZEPPOLES - These were my favorite of all the desserts served. I usually don't enjoy Italian desserts since they are a little denser than I prefer, so the zeppoles stood out for being a little more subtle and not overly sweet. Plus, I can never resist powdered sugar. 
RAINBOW CAKE - This was a little on the dry side for me. A little too chocolatey as well, but that's just a matter of preference.
CANNOLI - I don't usually like cannolis and I can't say this one changed my mind about them. 
ASSORTED COOKIES - These were good. They have a number of varieties and I would be back for more of these for sure. 

Service was spectacular. Our drinks were kept full and everyone was extremely friendly and entertaining, making our meal that much more enjoyable. 

We all had a great meal and there were plenty of leftovers for all. I was able to take some home to my mom who's a pasta fanatic and she loved it. I'd definitely be back for pizza, tripe and dessert as those were my favorites from our meal.

Fast forward due to yelps word limit. 

The table that came nearly 15 minutes after is has received their meal. I know my timing is accurate as I have been watching my clock on my phone the entire time. We were trying to be out of there by 3:15 so that we could make the Roos n More zoo benefit at Zappos. It was already 3:15. We arrived at 2pm. We have not received our entrees yet.

The hostess, who is also running food, walks by and we ask her is she has an idea of how much longer we need to wait for our food. Her demeanor changes. Condescendingly, she tells us "they serve quality food here and it takes time". I have dined at Joel Robuchon on more than one occasion. That restaurant has three Michelin stars, and their food does not take anywhere near this long to prepare. How could french toast, a grilled cheese and a fish sandwich be expected to take this long? I'm pescetarian. I cook fish every day. Even if it is being prepared via sous-vide, it should take no longer than 30 minutes. Bewildered, I repeat that we have waited nearly 50 minutes. The hostess raises her eyebrows puts her index finger to her lips and "shush's" us. She actually hisses and then angrily reminds us that we are seated next to their "investors" and tells us to say things quietly so that their precious "investors" don't hear.

My girlfriend did not respond very well to that. Loudly, she tells the hostess that she will not be quiet and that the investors they are so worried about should probably hear what we are talking about. With a panicked look on her face, the girl threateningly replies "You want me to go and get the manager?Because I will go and get George!" Without waiting for a response, she does, in fact, get George. In retrospect, I respect her for subtly warning us what we were in for.

Clearly displeased to have his feeding session interrupted. The manager finishes enjoying a few fries from his plate before coming by. He lumbers over, still masticating, crumbs spewing from his lips as he attempts to swallow the large quantity of deep fried potatoes visibly struggling to find their way down his esophagus. Uninvited, he takes a seat opposite us. The fish and french toast arrive. The grilled cheese is nowhere in sight. 

"So, what's going on?" 
We told him our food arrived after waiting nearly 50 minutes. He told us that it's our fault because we ordered the fish. And fish takes a very long time to cook. Incredulously, I informed him that fish is the quickest cooking of every animal protein source. I asked him if he ever cooked before. 

Then he proudly, and very defensively informed us that he "owns this place". Next, this rather large man points at my 100 pound girlfriend and instructs her to "just sit down and enjoy the meal. It's the best fish you're ever going to have in your life." 

The grilled cheese arrives. 

My girlfriend did not appreciate being bossed around and dismissed as though her complaint had no merit. In fact, I believe this is the turning point in which we both became visibly enraged. I was confused, my entire body was shaking with rage, and I was fighting back tears.She told the manager that he had no right to tell her what to do, and that she would not just sit down and enjoy the meal. The manger responded "So leave then!" My girlfriend responded with a resounding "Oh, we will." 

Horrified, the entire restaurant, precious "investors" included, stared at us, jaws slack, eyes filled with pity. Realizing an opportunity to twist the situation and make us the bad guy, he demanded we pay for the meal we did not even stick a fork into and insinuated that we were creating a scene in order to get something for free. My girlfriend happily agreed to pay, and directly called him out on accusing us of not having the money to pay the bill. He then barked at the bartender to come and process her debit card. While waiting for the card to go through, my girlfriend turned to the horrified "investors" and apologized for disturbing their meal by making a scene.She mentioned that they should reconsider investing in a business that is owned by someone so classless and unprofessional. One woman, with empathy in her eyes said it was okay, and they all looked like they felt for us. Interrupting her apology, the manager insisted that they are not investors. My girlfriend insisted that every person on their staff said they were investors and thats why we had to sit at the lounge tables instead of a real table for lunch. Failing to find anything rational to say, the manager/owner then demanded to know where I work so that he could come in and complain at my job, like we did at his. He proceeded to yell at us and tell us we are a "bunch of a**holes" amongst other unnecessarily profane things for creating a scene. As we were walking out, he yelled at us to never come back. 
I told him to go f*** himself. 

This happened because we asked why our food was taking so long.

We asked. Asked NICELY. And we're met with this response

Kaze Sushi, took over the sushi reign from Lucky Fish. And I am glad Bobby gave me a call to let me know about their soft opening, before I finished preparing dinner and eat at home.

The last minute decision to eat out was well worth it. Even if it meant that I have to eat "leftovers" tomorrow.  But fresh sushi prepared expertly and with care by a chef that is really knowledgable about his ingredients is always a treat.

Price is reasonable, especially with their promotion of 50% off on their entire Classic Sushi and Classic Rolls menu, when ordering at least 3 items. I think that requirement is easily accomplished for most people that go out for sushi.

Seared Scallops Sushi was my favorite, as searing it helps bring out its mild sweetness and flavor.

The salmon and Yellowtail Hamachi were very fresh.  The shrimp tempura in the Tiger Roll was fried to order, so it is still warm and tasty while surrounded by chilled fish and sushi rice.

This is definitely the place to go for a sushi snack, especially when you just want to have good sushi without the guilt of not stuffing your self silly to make that AYCE admission fee worthwhile.  

Also note this restaurant has just opened for 2 days of soft opening service, so the staff are still getting accustomed to working in the restaurant.  So be kind and patient if service is not yet up to par compared to an established restaurant.

Price/Value:  4.5/5  Definitely worth it with the half off selected portion of the sushi and rolls menu.  The rest is still competitively priced.

Taste: 4.5/5  Everything we ordered was fresh. But since it is only the 2nd day of soft opening service, the ingredients are also likely to be just 2 days old. 

Flavor:  4.5/5  Sushi and rolls are not over-sauced, so you can definitely taste the seafood.  That is a plus in my book.

Parking:  3/5  Clearly I don't hang out with the cool crowd. As I don't know where everyone is going to in the evening here, but the parking lot is always at 80%+ capacity.  During the day time, it is more like 15% capacity.  

Location:  West end of "Chinatown".  On Jones, between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn Rd. It is in the same plaza as China Mama, HK Star, and across the street from 168 Market.  

Rounding up for 5 stars.

CHA, CHA, CHA, CHA CHAIYA!

After seeing EVERYBODY check in here every last Sunday of the month, I finally got the chance to join them this last one on 3/30/14. Better late than never I guess. 

As I show up with my wifey, I just happen to bump into Andrew C who was nice enough to give me some pointers. He kind of ended up being my Chaiya guide along with tips by other Yelpers. First thing you notice about this place is that its right in the middle of a neighborhood community. 

First stop was to put my name down on the clipboard for an order of Pad Thai ($5). Wifey got 10 Pork Satay Skewers ($1 each). Then on down to the Sticky Mango Rice table ($5). After that the Thai Soup table ($5). Next is Papaya Salad ($4). 

Since just about everything was made fresh, you had to do a bit of waiting for certain things. Like the Pad Thai. They cook it from scratch with two big woks so two orders can be cooked at a time. Same goes for the Papaya Salad. The guy is literally peeling the skin off the fruit and finely slicing it for the salad mix. As for the Sticky Mango, they can only peel and cut the fruit so fast so the wait for that is based on how many mangos they can carve. Once they run out of that and sticky rice, you are out of luck. The Pork Satay Skewers are all ready to go and cooks pretty quick on the grill. The Thai Soup table has all the ingredients ready to go as well. You just need to select thick or thin noodles, then they throw it in a medium sized styrofoam bowl  along with broth, meat, and pork balls.

Shout outs go out to Nik O, Debra W, Terri R, and Chris V for helping me out also. Nik gave me her extra Eggroll to try out. Debra told me what there was to drink. Terri told me about the vegetables available for purchase. Lastly, Chris told me about the Curry Puffs that you have to order a month in advance. He even gave me one from his stash to try. Thanks a lot guys!

Some random info: Cash only! Preferrably small bills. Sometimes they give you coins that are worth 2 dollars that is valid for their items only. Come early! Show up just right before 9 am for great parking, better selection, and getting your Pad Thai quicker by being one of the first to sign up. Phone reception is low so it might take you a while to check in and upload pics sometimes. Lastly, this is an outdoor event so always be prepared for what the season may bring. If you follow what I just pointed out from beginning to end, you will fare much better than most peeps that show up later on.

Overall, I am kicking myself for not coming here sooner. Next time I am bringing back up. Usually on Saturdays and Sundays, I tend to sleep in but in cases like access to delicious cheap food and good company, I don't mind sacrificing a little bit of sleep. Hay, maybe I can nap........errr I mean meditate for a bit inside the monastery.

Prime; one of the top four steak houses in Vegas.  A pantheon of beef.  Where Bacchus reigns over a 500+ selection of to die for wines.  Where the "brown" libations are over the top.

At Prime, the menu is seasonally updated.  The fall of 2012 features an outstanding, air flown colossal stone crab appetizer (three huge claws the size of your hand with a pile of knuckle and leg meat).  Heaven and at $75, and worth every penny.  Sweet.  Perfect.  The steak tartar on a platter of Carpaccio is delicious but slightly unbalanced with over the top Asian spice heat.  Finally, the bacon wrapped shrimp.  Wow.  The fat of the bacon permeates the rich, sweet flesh of the barely cooked through shrimp.  Outstanding.

Beef mains are to die for.  Japanese A5 Kobe cuts of beef (4oz minimum $35 per ounce).  Sublime if you don't over indulge.  A four to six ounce portion is enough for anyone.  Offered in a strip, rib, or fillet cut.  The rib is the most flavorful.  DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU WANT YOUR BEEF COOKED BEYOND RARE.  You are wasting your money as the fat will melt during cooking and the beef taste like any other piece of beef.

The 30 day dry aged, bone fillet is excellent.  Huge umame finish without tasting edgy.  Soft and tender.  The veal chop is equally good.  Sweet, deep beef flavor from free ranged calves.  Double cut, perfectly seared and moist throughout.  

All mains come with sauces and sides.  They match and are very flavorful but do not pass on ordering some veg and off the menu potato dauphinois to share.  Sides are perfectly cooked.  Rich and refreshing.

Killer wine list with great depth of cult wines.  Great values to be found at higher price points (best priced Screaming Eagle in Vegas). Outstanding cognac selection.

Service is excellent.  Friendly and extremely efficient.

Note:  Unlike most Vegas restaurants, for reservations, you MUST be a high status member of Mlife to book the best tables and times on short notice.  If you use OpenTable, make your reservation at least 60 days in advance  Outdoor and window tables where you can view the incredible fountain show at the Bellagio are very difficult to secure.

A truly memorable experience in Vegas not afforded to everyone.  Do whatever it takes to try it.  

A dozen plus visits since my initial review.  Extremely consistent.  Highly Recommended.

Country Diner alert!!  All your breakfast  and lunch diner favorites !  We have passed this place literally a million times and kept wondering what the food is like.  Well we wonder no more.  For lunch today we stepped into a bit of what reminds me of an Oklahoma Diner , I could almost see my  country country cousins stopping by this place.  The menu is full of classic sandwiches like French Dip, Monte Cristo, Hamburgers and other American Sandwich Staples.  The menu is big on Breakfast and has lots of Omelettes to chose from .They even mark all the low carb items so you for those South Beachers it's a little easier. 

For starters Linda our server was instantly like family, she was sweet and kind . I love the way she talked to my daughter like she already knew her , "So Sammy what are we having today?" Linda was extra helpful and made great recommendations  .She even warned us about the size of portions and boy she wasn't kidding. Linda did a great job keeping glasses full and prompt service. We noticed in this small establishment  there  were four servers , whoa that's rare these days. 

I had the avocado Omelette which is big , with super nice chunks of avocado , no salsa  but I never asked for any either. The hash browns were not my favorite style  more mashed than chunky but you decide. You can chose yummy fresh made daily biscuits or toast. 

Plus One( husband) had the  Prime rib and eggs breakfast which he couldn't finish. The prime rib had good flavor for breakfast not top quality but pretty good, considering we are in a diner.  This is one of their specialities and if you are hungry it's perfect. This also comes with hash browns, eggs, and two humongous cupcake sized biscuits with a well seasoned gravy. If I wasn't low carbing it that would have been lunch! 

The decor is cute and quaint. The care and thoughtfulness of the staff shines thru.They talk to each customer like they are old friends and some of them were. When you are passing thru No Pho   give them a try.  They are open for  lunch and breakfast  only.

Fancy burger joints are part of the Vegas scene these days.  One, in particular, is known not only for its gourmet burgers w/ an Asian twist, but also for its local ties:  Bachi Burger.

Owner & Food/Beverage Director, Lorin Watada, is a transplanted local (Iolani grad) who now lives in Vegas. His cooking stints included Alan Wong's, Sheraton Hotels, Kahala Mandarin Hotel, & some 7  1/2 years as Corporate Chef w/ Roy's Restaurants, before opening  2 successful Bachi Burger locations in Vegas. The 1st location, just south of the Strip, opened in May 2010 in what was formerly a Dunkin' Donuts location in Windmill Plaza; the 2nd location opened in April 2012 in Summerlin, western Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=fIhDPCnCFfkcOHHi-jOJ3Q 

Having local ties, it is then not a surprise that the reasonably-priced burgers & food are prepared w/ Pacific Rim/Asian influences. Quality burgers are made from Wagyu & Angus beef (price range from $7.50 for an Angus beef burger to $26 for Wagyu beef/foie gras); steamed sandwiches (Peking duck in bao, pork belly); fish sandwiches; & even a Vietnamese "ban-mi" sandwich.  The sandwiches are served w/ Asian-inspired flavors & ingredients commonly found in Hawaii, e.g., miso goma dressing, shiitake, kalbi marinade, kimchee, furikake, lemongrass, hoisin mayo, mizuna, lup chong, unagi, & others. There are also appetizers & salads, w/ one of their popular dishes being the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries served with chili aioli & a fried egg. As much as possible, ingredients are natural, organic, & sourced locally.  

We loved the delicious burgers, as the flavors of the various ingredients just complemented each other. We had:

- Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger ($13.50). Came w/ chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, carmelized bacon, crispy onion rings.  There was no way you could eat this burger, or any of the other burgers, w/ the sandwich in your hand. I had to slowly dissect it to make it smaller; the onion rings were perfect crispy w/ a flavorful batter. The Wagyu beef just melted in my mouth & was so delicious w/ the egg, bacon, & furikake. The hamburger bun was also a winner - fresh Taiwanese sweet bun that is rich, buttery, & chewy w/ a nice shiny glaze on it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=ca3W5wdhrSem8ERFXnjI3g 
 
- Spicy Miso Burger ($10.50). Came w/ red onion, Shishito pepper, mayo, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese, fried egg, apple vinaigrette. Lots of flavor in this slightly spicy burger from the sweet, green, &slightly spicy Shishito peppers; bold & salty flavors from the miso; & a sweet, tangy oil/vinegar flavor from the vinaigrette. The same Taiwanese bun was used to make it even more flavorful. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=6pgTs0isXtKI5nXRLSfe3g 

- Salt & Pepper French Fries ($4). Garnished w/ slices of hot Jalapeno peppers, Maui onion sea salt, & garlic chili aioli & served in a classy stainless steel cone. Thin fries that are perfectly fried, crisp on the outside & moist on the inside, & seasoned perfectly.  The aioli was perfectly spiced & creamy for easy dipping; we also enjoyed dipping them in a tasty pineapple-tomato ketchup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=I6fySTopYSja57efTht35w 

The restaurant's name, "Bachi," takes on a dual meaning:  a shortened version of the word "hibachi" which is a style of grilling; & a Japanese term meaning karma, i.e., to treat others how you would like to be treated & implied in a negative way. (I assume the name is more in line with the grilling aspect rather than negative karma.)

Service was adequate for this clean, contemporary 75-seat restaurant w/ exposed pipes on the ceiling to give the dcor an industrial look. There are stylish recessed & track ceiling lights hovering over classy dark wood tables. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=KJAhWE22AH5ShHamqwWWOQ
 
Bachi Burger was featured on the Food Network on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives w/ Guy Fieri. This stint has helped to generate the crowds that it has been attracting.

I would love to return to try their other burgers/sandwiches/sides. Hawaii residents will love the Asian twist to these burgers/sandwiches, as the ingredients are all too familiar here.  A must-do for Hawaii residents traveling to Vegas or better yet, maybe a Bachi Burger in Hawaii?

Recently, my husband and I made a trip to Las Vegas. Since we are huge fans of Gordon Ramsay, we made reservations at his "Gordon Ramsay Steak" restaurant, in the Paris hotel. 
 
My husband wrote a great review of our experience but it wouldn't fit here.  So this is the condensed version.  We had a reservation on a Thursday night for 8:15.  We arrived on time and were told by the woman in front that it would be 10-15 minutes.  Go wait in the bar.  No I'm sorry, nothing, not even a smile when we walked up to her.  We were later told by a manager her name was Danielle.

We went into the bar and it was packed and had to stand.  15 minutes later a couple that had an 8:15 reservation left and we took their seats and ordered a drink.  My husband went to check with Danielle who held up her hand in an impatient "stop talking" manner,  and informed my husband "You are the next to be seated". Then immediately turned her back on him.

Then the people next to us who had an 8:30 reservation were seated.  I got up to talk to Danielle who was quite rude to me as well and informed me that "someone" was in there looking for us.  Apparently when you arrive Danielle writes down what you look like and when it's your turn to be seated she gives your description to a young girl who has to come in an find you.

Finally a young girl got us, at 9:00 for an 8:15 reservation.   I'm sure Danielle had forgotten about us and couldn't be bothered to apologize for her error.  We told the young woman you got us how displeased we were.  She had nothing to say and looked very uncomfortable.  We were seated and at this point I told my husband I just wanted to pay for our drinks and talk to the manager.  The waiter came and we told him, he apologized, first person to do so.  Then another man came up we told him the whole story, nope he was not the manager.  Finally the manager came up and by this time we were really upset.  He offered us a table near the kitchen.  There was no way I was going to spend several hundred dollars on dinner.  We had to repeat we just wanted our check, he comped us for the drinks.

So be aware, reservations mean nothing at GR Steak. We watch all of Gordan's shows, he always preaches STANDARDS.  Apparently he needs to teach some to Danielle and the hostesses of GR steak.

To review or not to review, that's the question I've been struggling with. With 50 reviews already, what more could little ol' me possibly add? Absolutely nothing, I knew.

But then, today turned out to be a special day...
I was trapped - back to back meetings from early morning through late afternoon with no time for lunch. Fortunately for me a good friend but obviously not as hardworking co-worker on her way out the door offered to bring me something back. Where was she going? Pasty!!! She just needed to know what I wanted, of course. So I checked the Pasty to go menu hanging from the bars of my cell - oops - I mean the wall of my cube, and to my surprise discovered that this wasn't going to be just another Pasty... Being the quasi-vegetarian I am, I've been slowly working my way through their vegetarian menu (more than 10 delicious options, including my favorite eggplant parmesan), and there was only one left - the Veggie Tikka Masala. My 11th and final vegetarian pasty - quite the momentous occasion, don't you think?

It was while I was savoring the perfect mix of fake chicken, bell pepper and basmati rice in tikka masala sauce wrapped in that soft chewy crust, dipped in that rich mint-yogurt dressing that I realized, 50 reviews be damned. Something new to say or not, I've got to say it. So for what's it's worth, this is it.

So, in conclusion: If you haven't been to Pasty yet, you need to go - soon. Come on, man - 50 reviews with a 4 1/2 star average rating? This place so obviously rocks! One tip: if you go for lunch, go early (they open at 11). It gets pretty busy and takes longer the later and busier it gets. Going early is also recommended if there are more than 2 in your party - there are only a couple of tables that fit 3 or more (otherwise you'll be sittin' at separate tables, or at the bar - oh, and should you find yourself headed for the bar, try not to sit directly in front of the one of the ovens, as those seats get pretty freakin' warm).

They've only been open a few weeks, but Kitchen 18 is already doing a fabulous job with their (kosher) food, service, and ambiance.  

I went to meet some girlfriends for dinner the other night, and we all were delighted to see that the place was jammed.  Lucky for us, there was one table open when we arrived, and it seemed to have our name on it!  The hostess was friendly as was our server, and we were impressed by the wide selection on the menu.  None of us keep kosher, but we were intrigued that there were plenty of fresh and healthy options.  

We started with the hummus appetizer to share and we also tried the salami and fig bruschetta.  The hummus was a tad on the bland side, but I loved that they served it with warm fluffy pita (white and wheat) and delicious pickles and peppers too.  The bruschetta was tasty... I can't compare it to Postino (my fave place for bruschetta) as you can't possibly compare kosher salami bruschetta to something quite the opposite, but it was good.

For our entrees, I had the Israeli salad with schwarma and really enjoyed it.  It was a large portion, so I boxed half of it to take home, but it was colorful, filling, and seasoned just right. One of my friends had the sliders and the other went with steak, which they both enjoyed.  Oh, and I ate more than a few of the sweet potato fries that came with the steak - they were delicious!

We shared a tiramisu dessert which didn't disappoint, even being dairy free!  (The kitchen happens to be entirely dairy free, so don't ask for a cheese burger when you go!)

I love that the attached market stays open late, so I did a little bit of shopping after our meal.  I highly recommend a product they carry called "popcorners."  They are popped corn chips and totally addicting!  There are tons of other unique kosher food items at the market too and an entire jewish gift shop as well (which I believe is in the process of being remodeled).

I look forward to returning to Kitchen 18 again soon... It's moderately priced and conveniently located on the Southeast corner of Scottsdale and Shea.  Whether you're keeping kosher, trying to eat healthy, or none of the above, there is something for everyone on the menu.

The Wynn Hotel and Casino is one of the top hotels in Las Vegas for two reasons. The employees do the little extra things that make you feel special and the place breathes class instead of oozing kitsch. If you're going to spend $30 extra to stay at a hotel in Vegas, the Wynn must be one of the first you check.  

 - The rooms will run you 2 bills and up which is just fine because the amenities and 600+ square feet are worth it when you are wanting a "better" vacation. 
 - Le Reve is a 4-star cirque-style in the water. We sat in the third row, but the circular theater looked like every seat had a great view.
 - I'm not a golfer, but the course looks beautiful. If you can't have a room with a view of the strip, getting one of this course is nice.
 - Lakeside is a nice restaurant to enjoy the Lake of Dreams
 - The Buffet is especially nice for dinner on weekends or holidays.
 - Save money on taxis because the 3 nightclubs (XS, Tryst, and Surrender) at the Wynn & Encore are bumpin!
 - the Esplanades at Wynn has high-end shopping too rich for my wallet, but still a guy can dream, right?
 - The Wynn pool is heated and a true Vegas party pool
 - The Casino is classy. They still will take your money, but in $25-$100 chunks instead of $10-$20 bites.
 - Housekeeping is wonderful. Need something? Ask. Seriously. Be prepared to tip.
 - Even the valet was great as he recommended we just walk instead of ride to the Venetian and then gave us bottle waters for the 5-minute stroll.
 - The worst part of the Wynn is the ever present voice of Steve Wynn telling you how awesome he thinks the hotel is. At some point, he needs to let the property, service, style, and experience speak for itself, but until then we are stuck trying to find a way to change the channel or hit mute.

Even if you don't rake in dough at craps or baccarate, you'll feel like a winner at the Wynn Las Vegas.

I could tell you all the reasons why you shouldn't go here. But what good of a reviewer would I be if I told the Yelp community to stay away because this place is far too amazing and you're not good enough to take part in it. Every food lover who can appreciate the beauty in a piece of raw fish should have the chance to experience what Kabuto has brought to Las Vegas. But good luck trying, there are only 18 seats in the entire restaurant and once word gets out, it ain't gonna be easy to get in.

Kabuto is part of the Mon Restaurant Family (Monta, Goyemon, Sushi Mon) and another development from restaurant stylist Martin Koleff. Martin is a pioneer for authentic Japanese eateries in Las Vegas. And at the sushi bar, I was rubbing elbows with those who were more than familiar with Martin's talents. He even popped in for a brief hello during my meal. 

I was told the Omakase Course ($80) will not be available until after the grand opening. I went with the Nigiri Course ($48) but you can order a la carte if you wish. I was served a pineapple appertif sake, a small cucumber salad with sea snail, and 10 pieces of the best fish I've ever had. You can state your preferences, but I had the chef choose for me. He was actually quite vocal and very friendly! He was conversational and took the time to explain the origin of each fish. The giant clam and bull eye were a couple of my favorites. And the uni with ikura were to die for. After your 10 pieces are served, you have the option of ordering more nigiri or moving on to your handroll. I ordered an additional saba then finished my meal. If you love mackerel. Order it here. I've now found the best saba in Las Vegas.

Dessert is not taken lightly here either.  In a couple of months, a Japanese pastry shop is to join this family of restaurants right next door. You have a few dessert options with the nigiri course--mochi, ice cream, or the strawberry layered crepe I ordered. Before I started eating, the chef busted out his iPhone and showed me a picture of a bunch of rocks. Confused, he explained to me the pastry chef's vision. She created the pink and white layers to resemble the layers of rock and sandstone at Red Rock. It was touching, and very delicious.

To be quite honest, I've never been to Japan. My understanding of Japanese tradition is a smattering of information from the internet and my Japanese-immigrant friends. But even I can tell that authenticity and quality are of the utmost importance here. From the food to the decor, Kabuto lives and breathes culture. Its unlike any sushi "joint" you've ever visited in town. I won't discourage you from visiting this magnificent addition to the Las Vegas community. But if you walk in expecting a baked roll with cream cheese, please, turn around and leave those 18 seats for the rest of us.

I haven't been to Buca di Beppo in years, and I recently had the opportunity to eat at this restaurant with my friends here in Vegas.  From the moment you walk into the restaurant, there is tons of excitement and energy!  Love it! 

First, you have to set expectations before eating here and writing a review - it is a family style restaurant that caters to large groups.   This is not a James Beard Award Winning restaurant, but it is a fun place for groups to grab a meal together.

I called in to make a reservation for 8 people at 7:00 p.m. and Miss Hostess was the nicest person I've encountered in a long time!  Easy Peasy!  When we got to the restaurant, we were greeted by three lovely hostesses.  We were told to wait 5 minutes for them to set up our table (HUH?  The restaurant was half empty!).  After being seated, we were quickly greeted and served by lovely Miss Server Shennae!

For starters, we got the Apple Gorgonzola Salad (Small for 4).  The salad was your typical green salad but was loaded with gorgonzola cheese, thinly sliced Granny Apples, walnuts and cranberries.  It was light, fresh, and tasty!   Grade:  B

For the main dish, we got the Frutti di Mare Pasta (Small for 4).  The pasta was topped with mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari.   The pasa noodles were tossed with a rich and spicy marinara sauce.  I loved the taste of this dish.  I didn't like the texture of the noodles.  It tasted like either the noodles were over cooked or were a cheap brand of noodles.  The texture was mushy and did not have a chew to it like most noodles should have.    Grade:  B-

The kiddos at the table ordered from the kid's menu ($5!).  Each had a personalized sized cheese pizza or spaghetti and meatballs.  Both selections were VERY generous and large!  The pizzas were 9" across.  The spaghetti and meatballs was served in a medium sized pasta bowl and looked like it was enough for 2 adults.   (It looked so tasty, I wanted to eat the leftovers of the kids, but I refrained!).   Grade:  A!

Best part of the meal was the energy and smiles of Miss Server Shennae!  She was patient and really made it an enjoyable evening!  You can tell she loves her job!  Thanks a bunch, Shennae!

Food Grade:  B
Service Grade:  A!
Worth the Money Grade:  B-  (sorry, the bad pasta noodles and prices did this)
Overall Impression Grade:  B

EAT your heart out downtown! 5 Stars on my first visit because they are doin it and doin it and doin it well here.

I went on a weekday at 12:30 for lunch. Place was packed and I'm thinking I will never get in. The hostess said the wait time was ten minutes and I still thought yeah right. She is just saying that so I don't leave. NOPE. I was seated in less than ten minutes. Awesome.

Instantly I am greeted with menus and our drink order was taken. As a foodie I had only been studying the menu online for weeks now so now I play the game pretending to read the menu and waiting for my friend to decide. It was hard to decide because truthfully I wanted to try like five things. I settled on the grilled cheese and chips. 

GRUB: Grilled Cheese. Cheesy, buttery, crunchy heaven. It's on thick sourdough bread and served with a delicious, intense tomato soup. Dip that shit and find an instant happy place. Suddenly the restaurant didn't seem so noisy. The food was THAT good. My friend also enjoyed her grilled cheese just as much. We also ordered a side of homemade chips which were perfectly seasoned and crisp. Good stuff. 

On top of the killer food they also played some of my favorite music: The Killers, Xx, Vampire Weekend and Morrissey. I loved everything about this experience.

The only negatives I could see people having would be that it is very busy and gets VERY loud. It would be the perfect spot to fire or breakup with someone. Parking sucks orangutan taint, too. Mostly metered parking around, but I did find a side street with no meters. I am not use to carrying change around. This isn't LA, fools.

Overall I am in love with EAT. I feel like it was made just for me. I hope it succeeds and attracts more businesses just like it. More reason for all of us to kick it downtown.

We arrived at 5:00 pm to check-in and were told by the front desk agent that our room wasn't ready yet and that they couldn't give us an estimate of when it would be. The hotel's check-in time is 3:00 pm. In order to compensate us, they gave us a $150 discretionary account to use on whatever we wanted in the hotel as well as an upgrade from our terrace suite to a wraparound suite. We believed this was more than fair and were perfectly happy to wait until our upgraded room was ready. When we were notified that it was, we checked in and the agent confirmed with us the $150 account.

After a lovely Saturday night of enjoying the admittedly beautiful view provided by our upgraded room and the drinks from the bar paid for by the $150 discretionary account, we cleaned up and checked out at 12:00 noon. 

The front desk agent told us that we would be charged $94 for incidental expenses beyond what was provided by the hotel. We knew that it was highly unlikely for us to have spent that much money that night, and asked for a receipt accordingly. The agent pulled it up and told us that the hotel had originally given us $50, not the $150 figure which we had been told - twice! After I corrected her, she brought in the front desk manager, David Bayley, who told us that he couldn't do anything and that we'd have to wait until 5:00 pm for yesterday's front desk manager to arrive so that she could sort out the issue.

After coming back at 5:30, we asked a front desk agent, Kira, if we could speak to yesterday's front desk manager. She said that yesterday's manager wasn't there and that we should talk to her instead. What followed from Kira was an extremely condescending if superficially pleasant treatment of us, implying that we were lucky enough to have been upgraded to a different room and that we should have been happy with what we received. Eventually, she deigned to give us an additional $50 comp credit out of "good will", but refused to do anything else, telling us that she'd ask the original agent we received the $150 credit from later to verify our story and that she'd follow up with us via email.

We, of course, were profoundly skeptical that anything would be resolved over email and asked to speak again to the manager, David. After Kira briefed David about our complaint, he came out to tell us, essentially, to leave the hotel and be happy with what we already received. Only after requesting to speak to David's superior did he finally decide to call the original agent to confirm our story. He told us that the original agent couldn't remember the amount she had compensated us, and that they'd cancel out our balance of $94.

First of all, this incident shows a stunning lack of integrity by the front desk agents. They had first told us to wait until 5:00 pm for a manager that never showed up, then told us to leave Vegas while they investigated the incident and that they'd follow up via e-mail, and finally that they'd give us a $50 credit out of "good will" - admitting no wrongdoing - and that we should just leave. The entire time, we felt that they were trying to delay and make it as inconvenient for us as possible so that we'd leave without the issue being resolved. Only after threatening to escalate the issue to upper management did the David take any substantive steps to solve the problem.

Second was the painfully condescending attitude of the front desk. Kira and David seemed to believe that $94 was a great deal of money to us. It wasn't. They didn't understand that our complaint was about the principle that we shouldn't have to pay extra for administrative mistakes made by the staff. They told us that they'd give us a $50 credit to our account out of "good will" with all the smug superiority an aristocrat might throw a dime to a beggar, treating us as though we were simply haggling to get the best deal we could. 

Finally, the whole incident reflects the sheer incompetence of the front desk. Even if they believed that we were lying about the original $150 credit, which certainly was the impression we received, good business sense behooves them to simply cancel out our balance. $94 is nothing compared to the thousands of dollars they're going to forgo via our entire network of friends who will never again stay at the Cosmopolitan. 

At the very end, after they finally canceled out our balance, I asked for Kira and David's business cards so that I knew whose names to mention to the world. David, to his credit, wrote down his name and contact information on a slip of paper. Kira, however, wrote but one word on a slip she handed me - "Kira". No last name, no phone number, no email address. My friends and I couldn't help but laugh at the cowardice she displayed through that simple omission. Anyone decent person doing his or her job competently and with integrity has nothing to hide - unfortunately, Kira seemed to lack both.

Don't stay at the Cosmo. Your dignity is more important than having a nice view.

I've been doing a lot of searches on Vegas lately because of the Yelp Spring Break Las Vegas that's coming up in 2 months!!  I CAN NOT WAIT!!!  I'm totally ready!!  I wanna go NNNNOOOWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!

Anyway, that's how I got to thinking, I should review one of my fave places!!

I've been going to Vegas since I can remember.  We used to play at the arcades while the parentals would gamble away our college funds.  We would have annual summer treks out to the desert with a huge group of friends and family.  It was good times.  Circus Circus was the place to be!!

During the teenage years, Vegas was boring...  Nothing to do except eat or stay in the room.  I didn't go to Vegas for years...

Once I turned 21, I've been coming all the time!  At least twice a year.  I remember a time when I was here for 3 weekends out of 4!  That was just craziness.

I've been to Vegas for shows, weddings, bachelorette parties, birthday parties, girls weekends, just cuz trips, you name it!  There is so much to do, so much to celebrate!

I'm not a huge gambler or clubber, but I always find something entertaining to do.

Wanna relax and unwind?  There are spas at almost every hotel!  THEbathhouse (THEhotel) and Qua (Cesar's) are must dos!

Wanna people watch?  Anywhere you find a chair works!!  People from all over the globe come to Vegas.  It's awesome!  I especially like walking the Strip on nice days.

Wanna eat?  There are soooo many restaurants and food places, one can never eat them all!  I still have a list of my must eats. 

Wanna eat lots?  Have you heard of Buffet of Buffets?  Yelp it!  I love buffets, so much variety, not enough stomach space!  :(  I like to sometimes go to off-strip places.  There are so many awesome finds!  

Wanna shop?  There are stores everywhere!!  Some of my favorite shopping is at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets North off Charleston.  & Coke World Rocks!

Wanna see cool canyons?  Red Rock Canyon is only about 20 minutes drive from the strip.  It's gorgeous!

Wanna sleep? There is no sleeping in VEGAS!!!!!!!!!!  Okay, if you must...  There are so many hotels at so many price ranges.  But...  go BIG or GO HOME!!  :P

Wanna see cute boys strut their stuff?  There's lots of that goin' on here too!!  Chippendales or Thunder from Down Under are awesome!!  Or head over to Olympic Gardens ;) for up close action!

For girlie stuff:  head to pole dancing classes or spas or Chippendales!!!

Wanna dance the night away?  There are lots of clubs, too many to count...  I don't go anymore cuz it makes me feel old :(

Wanna soak up the sun?  Most hotels have some pretty awesome pools.  I love the one at Bellagio!  Just gorgeous!

Wanna gamble?  Of course you do!!  ITS VEGAS!!!  Most casinos are pretty cool.  I like the non-smoking ones.  Grab a chair & play!  My faves are Pai Gow Poker or Blackjack.  Wizard of Oz slots is cool too!

Wanna drink?  So many bars to hang out in!!  Hit up Voodoo Lounge, it has a great view!!!

Like free stuff?  Go to Bellagio for the fountains and my fave, the conservatory/gardens.  Tons of free stuff to do!  

Oh, Vegas, how I love thee....

RigaTonys why do I keep forgetting about you!!

A friend that I hadn't seen in about 22 years was driving though and hit me up on FB and said Hey lets have dinner, find somewhere off the I-10 and make it Italian and RigaTony's was the perfect place to pick! 

We meet up around 5pm on a Wednesday night, the place was busy, but not packed, I was loving how they decorated for Christmas, made me feel like I was going to a party :) 

Our server was Michelle and she was very helpful answering whatever questions my friends had, and she was excellent at making sure we had everything we needed, love great service

After we checked out the menu I decided I wanted the lasagna & spaghetti combo. My friend ordered the chicken with lemon & artichoke and her husband ordered the spaghetti deluxe.

Then the antipasto salad & freshly baked ciabatta bread came out, OMG this salad is to die for, I love love love it!! Stop going to the Olive Garden people, this is the salad you should be having!! And the bread!! I love me some fresh baked bread, so much better than sticks! 

My lasagna was delish baby! It was so flavorful too, the cheese, the noodles the sauce, omg I can't believe I ate it all, I ordered it with the intention of having some for lunch the next day, nope that didn't happen!  So good!!  The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the sauce was the perfect amount and great in flavor! Loved the combo! 

My friends, they too loved their dishes and were happy we picked RiggaTonys for dinner!! It was great seeing her and sharing a great meal too! 

A fun tip I did learn about RiggaTonys is once a month on Monday night they have a Wine dinner, where you dine on 5 course dinner that the Chef prepares for just that night; I will have to check that out soon!

How much would you pay for a popular & busy buffet with hundreds of quality choices?

   A: $54
   B: $74
   C: $94
   D: Anything ... just let me in the freakin' buffet already

Be prepared to pay any of those prices at Bacchanal Buffet cause this is the current "It" buffet in Vegas. Caesar's Palace can pretty much charge whatever they want. The line is KuRAAAYzeee. We tried to go for dinner Monday before Christmas and the line was 3 1/2 hours long. That's over 200 minutes. We read on Yelp about an "Express" option for $20 extra, but it wasn't available that night. We left.

So, we came back on Christmas Eve for a late lunch. The set-up was different and line much shorter ... because it was a 25-minute line to put your name in for a time slot 3 1/2 - 4 hours later. The registration part is cool if you can wait. I can't. Luckily, the "$20 Express" option was available at that time. Whew! Seriously, I would of paid anything to skip the wait. So, after paying $74 for lunch per person, we headed to ... the next line. It took another 25 minutes to get seated with express. 

      This better be one hell of a buffet!

            It was. 

Here's what I pigged out on for a couple hours ... 

Meats & Seafood
 - Chilled Shrimp
 - Chilled Crab Legs
 - Warm Crab Legs
 - Rack of Lamb
 - Oysters on the Half Shell
 - Prime Rib
 - Sausages
 - Chicken
 - Ribs
 - Mussels
 - Chinese-style Crab
 - Crawfish

Sides
 - Caprese Salad
 - Sliced Pineapple
 - Pho Noodle Soup
 - Turkey Pot Pie
 - Charcuterie Meats
 - Cheeses
 - Steamed Dumplings
 - Creamed Leeks & Lobster
 - Sushi Rolls
 - Cranberries
 - Sliders
 - Bread
 - Crab Benedict
 - Chinese Broccoli

Desserts
 - Fresh Crepes
 - Red Velvet Whoopie Pies
 - Gelato
 - Creme Puffs
 - Vanilla Creme Brulee
 - Chocolate Creme Brulee
 - Buttercream Pops
 - Cheesecake Pops
 - Berry Mousse Tarts
 - Fresh Cookies

Bacchanal Buffet really is a great buffet. It is, of course, overpriced and hardly worth the wait, but if you want quality and choices like this in Vegas you have to either pay for it or have the patience of a very bored saint to stand in line. When you do finally get into Bacchanal, go nuts on the seafood and meats so at least you feel like you're making it worth your money/time.

I'm giving this place 5 stars. The Boyfriend & I decided to randomly try a new place (his idea) and I know he loves Brazilian steakhouses... So I steered us toward this place. At first we weren't sure what to think.. The place looks empty when you walk in, but actually almost every table had people. It took a little bit to get a table, but obviously they were busy. She sat us at a booth, which was perfect for us. The salad bar is significantly smaller than other Brazilian steakhouses but the Stroganoff is out of this world. Best I've ever had! The Boyfriend really liked the grape leaf wrapped something or other. I didn't try them so I have no idea. 
They started bringing out the meat & one of the guys really stood out.  So much personality. Later we realized he was the owner. 

The Boyfriend really liked one of the chicken skewers, but obviously the red meats were the standouts. No one gave us tongs, so it was a little weird getting the meat from the server, but they worked it out. 

The meat selection is similar to other Brazilian steakhouses, but I do think they could do with some sharper knives. Meat quality is good, not great but definitely good. 

This place is definitely a family owned restaurant with the good & bad qualities that go into that. For me personally, eating out is about the experience just as much as food quality and this place goes out of their way to give good experience. Towards the end of the night the owner was singing karaoke and encouraging everyone to get up and sing. Normally that's not really my thing, but something about all the positive energy really made it a lot of fun. When we left everyone was having fun drinking and dancing around. It was a lot of fun.

***The food at Charlie Palmer's Aureole varied from okay to below average; I think you could have a decent meal here but probably not a great one***

Aureole definitely feels like a restaurant that might have been great when it first opened (though the standards and food quality are not there now).  The restaurant itself is nice.  The space goes beyond high ceilings with a massive glass wine tower.  The dining area is nice--it is contemporary and elegant (with white tablecloth) and there are big windows that provide a view of the outside greens.

In terms of the menu, there are two tasting menus (a seasonal tasting menu and a parallel tasting menu, which presents a primary ingredient in two separate preparations on the same plate).  There is also an a la carte menu (with some nice sounding dishes).

I had the parallel tasting menu because it sounded like an intriguing concept.  There were definitely bright spots, but there were also some average to below average courses (from the concept not being great to begin with or poor cooking of the ingredients and thus not yielding the appropriate flavor/texture).  Here is the rundown on the tasting menu:

(Roasted baby beets, tangerines, herb cheese, bourbon maple syrup) This dish was good.  I really liked the flavorful and juicy beets as well as the creamy and lightly tangy cheese.  The tangerines were just okay (not as vibrant as they could have been).

(Golden beet panna cotta, cured salmon, tangerine lace) The golden beet panna cotta was creamy and did have a mild beet flavor.  The cured salmon was okay in terms of flavor, but I would have preferred more freshness and moistness.

(Diver scallop, white asparagus and scallop terrine, wild mushrooms, asparagus, yuzu froth, trout roe) I thought the scallop was good.  It was very fresh and moist and had a good outside sear (though it was a tad salty).  A lot of times, froths/foams taste of nothing, but the yuzu froth here was surprisingly strong.  With the slight saltiness of the scallop and the strong yuzu flavor, this dish was not as light as it should have been.

The asparagus terrine was okay--I was not a fan of the gelatin-like texture and I thought it kind of tasted of nothing.  The garnishes of wild mushrooms, roe and asparagus were fine.

(White asparagus, crispy Serrano ham, black peppercorn gastrique) I like how white asparagus pulls apart like green onions and these were a good representation of that (nicely cooked).  The Serrano ham was crispy and salty.  Like the scallops, I felt this dish should have been lighter in flavor.

(Roasted Niman Ranch pork tenderloin, wrinkle potatoes, grilled baby leek, romesco sauce) This was a very below average dish.  The pork tenderloin was visibly overcooked and it was quite dry.  The sides and romesco sauce were not bad (the wrinkle purple potatoes were nice and tender), but they were not great either.

(Pork sausage, crispy rock shrimp, steamed bun, cucumber salad) This dish seemed way too close to its Asian/Vietnamese basis.  The flavors and fragrances were okay, but I think you could get a much more flavorful and fragrant dish at a good Vietnamese restaurant.

The only element that really stood out was the crispy rock shrimp--very moist but also a light and crispy outside.

(Ginger beignets, poached strawberries, lychee sorbet, lime rind) The ginger beignets were very disappointing.  They were filled with a ginger custard.  And because of this, the kitchen had to probably chill the beignets.  Unfortunately, the beignets were not evenly warm.  They were half cold, which was disappointing (especially when you think beignet, you think something hot, light and fluffy).

The lychee sorbet was cool and refreshing and I really liked the lime rind (small but very strong in flavor).

(Coconut ginger vacherin, braised pineapple, vanilla Chantilly, meringue) This dessert was okay.  The vacherin was creamy and cool.  It was filled with pineapple and there was more of a pineapple flavor than a ginger flavor.  While I thought the dessert was kind of a standard dessert, I really liked the braised pineapple (sweet and not too tart), which looked like ginger.

There was also an assortment of below average complimentary bread.

In terms of service, the food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.  I thought the female servers were more personable and pleasant than my main male server (who was still polite).

For a fine dining place with a notable chef backing it, the price for their parallel tasting menu was not as high as other similar Vegas spots.  The food was disappointing though and given the lack of quality, it felt overpriced.

Aureole may have once been a good fine dining spot, but I am not sure if you can get a great meal here now.  If there was more attention to detail (and better cooking/preparation of the ingredients), you might be able to get at the very least a decent meal here.

Aureole is located in Mandalay Bay (free parking structure).

Perched atop the 64th floor of the majestic Hotel at Mandalay, Mix boasts some of the best views of the south strip in Vegas. Once you set foot inside the lavish ivory themed dining room, you know you're in an Alain Ducasse restaurant. The space simply oozes the charm and elegance of his signature opulent style reminiscent of the dining room at the Hotel Plaza Athne in Paris.  The glitz and glamour of Vegas is also quite apparent and you can't help but be dazzled by the contemporary and elegant atmosphere that envelops you.

With the beautiful weather I had been  experiencing over the weekend, I opted for patio seating with a direct view of the Vegas strip below. 

After glancing through the menu, I decided  to try Chef Ducasse's signature Tasting Menu with wine pairings.

Breads came out soon after with a selection of focaccia, French baguette, dinner rolls and sourdough with unsalted and an interesting "peanut" butter. The breads were room temperature and butters were cold so spreading was not pleasant but the breads served their purpose of filling my gullet til the main courses arrived. 

Amuse

Foie gras royale with port reduction and mushroom foam 

- this enticing little number exhibited a pleasant airiness and irresistible aroma from the mushroom foam and the interesting mix of flavors and textures married well together lending a savory yet earthy element to this whimsically fascinating dish

Gnocci
With Parmigiano Reggiano, veal jus and sun chokes.

Not the best Gnocci I've ever had but satisfying nonetheless. This dish had an incredibly comforting feel to it. I especially enjoyed the contrasting textures from the light & crispy chips and tender enoki mushrooms served with the dish. Warm, rustic yet subtle and familiar flavors were easy on my palate. 

Main lobster curry with coconut basmati rice 

- it's hard to go wrong with lobster, especially when you infuse thai flavors into a dish. The perfectly cooked lobster was bathed in a pool of curry and served stop luscious coconut rice. A delectable marriage of flavors.

Filet mignon Rossini with foie gras and black truffle sauce 

- this was easily my favorite dish of the night. The combination of filet mignon, foie gras and black truffle is like the holy trinity of fine dining.  The result will almost always result in endless drooling and licking the porcelain off your plate. 

Predessert

Coconut foam and mango rum cocktail. An exhilarating drink with bright notes and a sweet finish. Excellent palate cleanser and a perfect way to prepare my taste buds for the sweet finale.

Baba a la marnagnac

Unfortunately I wasn't as impressed with my dessert.
The liqueur for the cake was too strong and pungent while the flavors were just were too heavy handed. I may have myself to blame for that, as I may have given the cakes too heavy of a pour of the accompanying liqueur.

Overall, food was good but I must admit that I expected more from a multi Michelin star chef like Alain Ducasse.  IMO, the dishes lacked that wow factor that I was eagerly anticipating.  Service was also on the clumsy and awkward side the night I dined, as well. For instance, my wine pairing for one of my dishes was completely forgotten until I reminded the sommelier. Additionally, the wait staff seemed a bit hurried and rushed.  The furniture itself, which has probably seen better days, was in desperate need of an update, too. During my dinner one of my guests had to change their seat out because the chair was collapsing. For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected a bit more, at least chairs that weren't falling apart at the seams. 
With that said, they changed the chair out without a hitch and there were some redeeming factors which included the stunning views, beautiful setting and expansive bar next door.  
3.5 stars for now and hoping the restaurant makes some improvements on the menu, furniture, and service in the future.

Until then...

Happy Eats!

***Mon Ami Gabi is a very popular French brasserie though I found their brunch to be mediocre and disappointing; the restaurant has a great atmosphere and nice service though***

Mon Ami Gabi in Las Vegas' Paris has been around for a long time and it still seems to be as popular as ever.  If you have been to Las Vegas, you have likely walked past this French brasserie; it is the one with the big outdoor patio just outside the Paris hotel that looks like either a great spot or a very hot place to have brunch or lunch.  Mon Ami Gabi is from famous Chicago chef Jean Joho, who also runs Paris' fine dining restaurant The Eiffel Tower Restaurant and Chicago's Everest.

While I was not a fan of The Eiffel Tower Restaurant, I was looking forward to trying Mon Ami Gabi.  This French brasserie seemed like a good choice for a delicious but not too expensive brunch.  I really liked the look.  The outdoor patio can be nice during some parts of the year and the restaurant also has an indoor-outdoor dining area, which offers a good view and a lot of sunlight but still provides a French bistro-esque room with good tables and a comfortable temperature.

Mon Ami Gabi's brunch menu features a mix of breakfast and lunch dishes from Eggs Benedict and omelets to steak frites and sandwiches like the Croque Madame, which I ordered.  Unfortunately, it was not good.  The ham was too thickly cut and quite dry while the toasted bread was dry, hard and way too crunchy.  The cheese did not have that stretchy and melted quality that a good Croque Madame has.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mon-ami-gabi-las-vegas-2?select=RSpAHvSIkAL21g6FHhd-Mw#8hc0hKwEWBkyr-oSH8V1dA

The Croque Madame was topped, of course, with a fried egg.  Unfortunately, the fried egg was quite burnt around the edges.  The fries had a thin potato chip-like cut.  They were not super crispy, but I liked the soft insides contrasted against the crispy edges.  Unfortunately, the fries were quite salty.

For dessert, I had their profiteroles and this was a much better representation of a classic French dish.  The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.  The chocolate topping was not the traditional thin dark chocolate sauce.  Instead, it was a thick double fudge sauce. While I prefer the more traditional thin bittersweet chocolate sauce, the chocolate combined with the ice cream and pastry to make a satisfying dessert.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mon-ami-gabi-las-vegas-2?select=RSpAHvSIkAL21g6FHhd-Mw#3Vy7BG3KJjbNjcREFoUeJQ

Service was good.  My server was very pleasant, polite and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace.

Prices were not too bad for their breakfast and brunch options.  Some of their steak dishes seemed pricey, but they were similar to other Las Vegas restaurants though Las Vegas restaurants tend to be very overpriced.

Bouchon is Las Vegas' signature French brasserie, but I try to seek out other places.  Bouchon is perfectly fine, but it feels very similar to the Bouchons in Yountville and Beverly Hills (in terms of food, the Yountville location is easily the best of the bunch).  Mon Ami Gabi offers a more unique experience for people on the West Coast (Mon Ami Gabi has several locations in the middle of the country and the East Coast).

Unfortunately, the food at Mon Ami Gabi was simply not that good.  While I liked Mon Ami Gabi's service and atmosphere, Bouchon is a much better option if you desire a French brunch (or dinner); it would probably not cost you that much more either.  Comme Ca in The Cosmopolitan would probably also be a better option for French bistro fare than Mon Ami Gabi.

Like most Las Vegas hotels and casinos, Paris offers complimentary valet and self parking.

The Grand Lux Cafe is located in The Venetian Hotel & Casino, Las Vegas. The Venetian for those of you who may not know, is a very beautiful resort. There are beautiful interior features and rooms, a fabulous casino and a lot of places to dine at. There is something for everyone, from high end restaurants to snack bars. To each his own and I'm sure that even the most demanding diner will enjoy one of the restaurants. For me, I love coming to the Grand Lux Cafe because it has an upscale feel to it without the pricey menus. The fare is reasonable for resort dining and it's a very comfy atmosphere. 

I came here for dinner on this particular evening and we were seated promptly. Upon being seated, the waitress took our drink orders, customary green bottle and water with a lemon wedge. A basket with fresh baked bread was also served. Next we proceeded to decide on what appetizer to have. We agreed on this creation called a Double Stuffed Potato Spring Roll. Let me tell you, it's awesome! Imagine a lumpia wrapper with mashed potatoes in it, served halved, crispy with melted cheese and topped with green onions, applewood bacon and a sour cream dipping sauce... I was absolutely in appetizer heaven! Probably not something you can partake in everyday, but a must when you are on vacay and enjoying dining out!  For dinner, I settled on the Ribeye and my dining companion had the Shrimp Scampi served on a bed of Pasta... I ordered the Ribeye medium rare, and that's the way I got it! Now that made me a happy diner. Now, it's not easy to prepare a Ribeye because you can't see it cooking inside, but they do a great job here. I was impressed because it wasn't a thick piece and the thinner they are, the harder they are to prepare. I glanced over at my dining companion and saw that she was happily enjoying her Scampi. There were lot's of generous sized shrimp and the pasta looked delicious! We enjoyed our dinner here and as for dessert, well, there wasn't any room left! Definitely a favorite whenever in Vegas, I shall return next trip!

There is no question or doubt in my mind that Jol Robuchon deserves nothing less than five stars and is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.

My company was hosting its annual holiday Vegas vacation, so I knew I wanted to dine somewhere nice as I rarely ever get the chance to when in Sin City with friends (typical meals include McDonald's, Earl's, and a buffet). I made reservations easily on the phone a month in advance and inquired about the complimentary limo service. I was told to call back 7-days before my dinner reservation to reserve. I called back 6-days before and was told there was no availability and was put on a waiting list. So when they say to call a week in advance, you better call a week in advance.

Our party of four didn't end up getting limo service or The Mansion tour, but Jol Robuchon is truly a beautiful restaurant and amazing enough on its own. Our jaws dropped in awe from the opulent dcor, grandiose chandelier, and elegant royal purple theme. The ambiance is lovely, romantic, and simply stunning.

Mignardises
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joel-robuchon-las-vegas-6?select=JD9j9dYn8e7PUXXLWucl7A#BtWcKw5jrQKx8nNcMLUfjA
The mignardises cart was equally as impressive and stunning as the bread cart. There were over 20 selections of different sweet treats to choose from; it was pretty overwhelming. I wish I could've tried everything but I really didn't want to look like a fatty. My favorites from the cart were the canels and macarons.

Everything was delicious. The appetizers, the mains, the desserts, everything. I've been to 1- and 2-Michelin-star restaurants before, and now I finally know that that one extra star truly does make a difference. Le Homard (spiced lobster) was my favorite appetizer, followed by Le Navet Rouge (scallops). For my main, I ordered Le Bar (grilled sea bass), which was good but lost the round to La Langouste (spiny lobster) and Le Buf (braised beef cheeks). If I were to go back again, I'd definitely get the the beef cheeks; they were so tender and flavorful. Dessert was amazing -- if you're ordering any, you must get La Sphre, a bubble sugar sphere filled with blueberries, yogurt sorbet, candied lemon, and violet cream. It was so pretty and made my sweet tooth very happy. Le Souffl is also a must! Not too sweet, not too bitter, it went terrifically well with the vanilla ice cream it was served with. Perfect ending to a fantastic dinner. I would have to say however, both the amuse-bouche and mignardises were fairly mediocre when compared to the rest.

Service was good. Our water glasses were constantly refilled (explains how we ended up with a $40 tab on water alone), timing between courses was perfect (though there was a little hiccup between our last dessert course and mignardises), and while the staff was supremely attentive, they were also generally unobtrusive.

After our meal ended, the ladies in our group were each presented with a giant loaf of bread in a purple gift bag. If your meal doesn't fill you up, this bread definitely will.

We contacted Maleisa Hughes last year regarding watching our three dogs (golden retriever, afghan hound and a chihuahua.  The prices were reasonable considering what other sites cost, as they were only charging $20 per dog and they were willing to give a discount for the third dog, so the price was set at $50 per day.  We scheduled a visit to their home and brought our 2 big dogs to introduce them to the owners.  We saw that there was an acre which looked fun for the dogs. They invited us into their home and said the dogs would be treated like members of the family if boarded with them and that all play time outside would be supervised.  Maleisa said they had been boarding dogs for years and were experienced and advised we book early for any dates we wanted as they limited the number of dogs boarded to six dogs.  We felt that was reasonable on a property of that size.  Our dogs were all very well socialized with people and other dogs as we routinely went to dog parks so we felt this would be a great place to bring them. We booked a weekend last fall just to test the place out and see how it went.  We checked in often, via text and and we were told the dogs were doing great and having lots of fun.  The day we picked them up they were out in the yard with the owners running around with a few other dogs and seemed content.    My Afghan hound went to the corner of the yard when he saw me and hid behind some ducks in an open pen, I assumed he didn't want to go home as he had enjoyed his stay.   We went ahead and booked the Christmas week to bring the dogs again.

Christmas rolled around and one of my adult children announced she would be home and offered to watch the dogs for me.  As we had already booked with Green Acres, I didn't feel right about canceling at the last minute, as I had noticed that the owners had numerous young children and felt it would not be fair to deprive the family of the income we had promised.  I did opt to leave the chihuahua home, as I felt he might not be safe running around with bigger dogs.  We boarded the big dogs for about 9 days.  When I came to pick up the dogs that time, they were let out of a room in the back of the house and the afghan hound ran to me with his tail between his legs and couldn't wait to get out of there.  I noticed that both dogs were filthy and smelled HORRIBLE.  I can't even describe the stench, but it took several baths to finally get rid of the odor.  I found it odd because the acreage is all grass, so I couldn't figure out where that stench would have come from.  

Outside of the smell, the dogs seemed fine until a few weeks later we attempted to go back to the dog park where we had gone many times over the years, and when we entered the park the afghan hound FREAKED out and started aggressively barking at the other dogs that ran up to greet him as if to say, "stay away from me".  I had to grab him and remove him to avoid a dog fight.  We attempted to return to the park a few times thereafter and he behaved the same way each time.  He even freaked out on a walk when he saw another dog across the way.  We spoke to a trainer regarding the behavior and he told us once a dog is in that mind set it is VERY DIFFICULT to break it.  We were very sad and couldn't figure out what could have triggered such a wild swing in temperament.  We finally realized that his behavior HAD to have been impacted by the stay at the boarding facility.  Looking back now, if he was stuffed in a room with 30 other dogs, it would have driven any dog mad, or to fear aggression.

We couldn't prove that anything horrible had happened to our dog at that point, it was just a feeling that something bad had happened there and we decided we probably should not use them again.

We decided to hire my niece and nephew last week to watch our dogs while we were out of town, because of that gut feeling something was wrong over there and came back to the news that 17-21 dogs had died in the Hughes' care, or lack thereof.  All I can think about is, IF I had cancelled our plans during Christmas and left the dogs with my daughter, I WOULD HAVE BOOKED last week with the Green Acres and my dogs would have been among those poor souls who lost their lives.  We were the lucky ones...I may not be able to take my temperamental hound to a park anymore, but at least he is alive.  My heart is breaking for all the families who lost their sweet puppies.

Thanks Yelp, I know you're not a dating site, but Flores AC and my air conditioner are a match made in heaven and it was love at first sight! 

It was a grueling day, manual labor in the hot Phoenix sun really does a number on you. Mid July, 110 degrees, sweating so much people think you just jumped in the neighbor's pool. whew. I get my underoos in a bunch just thinking about people who work outside. Luckily, I just have a quick walk from the office, to the car then the car to the perfectly cooled 87 degree condo in CenPho. It's on a timer and set to start cooling exactly 45 minutes prior to my daily arrival. 

What the? What's going on? OMG. No. Please, no. Wait, NOOOOO. Now don't hyperventilate. You've seen this before. OK. Breathe, deep breaths. I think I remember someone suggesting to turn off the AC for an hour, killing the compressor. Sometimes the coolant lines can get frozen. Yes, that's right. I know its 110 degrees outside, but yes this sometimes does happen. I guess this is a good time to swap out my return air filter - it is a few weeks overdue once every 2-3 months. So after an hour; well, it could have been like 58 minutes, but I didn't really want to wait any longer. I cut the air back on, gave it 10 minutes and still nothing. Well, these tried and true AC tricks didn't quite cut it this time. Time to get someone to Yelp me out with this one.

I popped open Yelp and searched my way through Phoenix for "Air Conditioning", a handful of results showed up but really, my first call was Flores AC. They outshine just about everyone else that came up by a good 30 reviews and have a 4.5 overall rating. This is my guy. 

I explained to him that I tried everything in my bag of tricks already, but I was just blowing a bunch of hot air. "No problem" he replied and said "I'll be there in 15 minutes." really? 15 minutes? whatever. "OK hunny, they'll be here sometime soon-ish." They said 15 minutes, but I dunno. I'll believe it when I see it."

... Told you so, service guys and contractors, they never get here on time. 15 minutes. I knew he couldn't get here in 15 minutes; heh, now where's my free pizza? pssshh.  It took them 17 minutes to get here. I knew it, two minutes. 

He had my AC fixed up in about 20 minutes, apparently a bad compressor. At just $160 for the part, the call, and his time - those other guys have done me wrong for the last time. 

From walking in the door and discovering my AC wasn't working to happily signing the charge to my credit card, 1.5 hours - you just don't find that anywhere else. They were super friendly, family owned, and in business since 1980 something. Lets face it. 30+ years is longer than some people have lived in Phoenix, let alone been doing AC in Phoenix. Fully licensed, bonded, and insured; you don't have to worry about weather or not you're getting some Joe off the street; or George, Chas, or Parker for that matter.

Stay cool Phoenix and happy Yelping!

Cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap. And no, I don't mean great value. I mean it's obvious how many corners they cut with this place. I love the sls in BH and this place feels like a budget motel in comparison. 

We paid an extra 70 bucks to upgrade to a "lux corner suite" what we got was a cheaply decorated room with a super hard mattress, thin sandpaper sheets, cheap thin sandpaper duvet. The ac is crazy loud. The view is of a back service area. Curtains don't keep light out. No bath tub. And this is not a suite.... It's just a regular king bed. Using French themed printed curtains as wallpaper and dividers does not make the room cool. It makes it look like they cut corners, which, oh yeah... It's obvious. This is probably by far the worst "luxury" hotel I've stayed in. Ever. 

Not to mention, right when we checked in the room was not even cleaned! It took over half an hour of trying to get a hold of someone via phone and then going down to the lobby before the housekeeper we were able to flag down just felt bad for us and cleaned up right away. No, we were never able to get a hold of anyone to make a complaint. 

The finish and quality of this hotel just isn't there and neither is the service. Take your business elsewhere. You will be disappointed. Our friends warned us already, but given that I love the sls BH, I wanted to try it out anyway. Boo. Guess they "already told me so."


Update: yea I wrote this prior to check out. But here comes the sweet cherry on top of an already crappy experience. So while we were waiting for the room we had nowhere to go... Decided to grab two beers at the bar downstairs. Total, $17. We charged it to the room. Upon check out we noticed that they charged us $19 on top of the $17 beer charge as "gratuity".. Really? For that crappy service? Get real. Then they tried to sneak on another room charge and double charge us for the one night. Wow. And no offer to waive any fees or anything for our entire crappy experience which I did finally unload onto the front desk agent. Just dropped another star. Definitely by far the worst Vegas experience ever. Zero customer service or appreciation. Won't even be patronizing the BH location anymore.

Even asked for late check out but decided I really couldn't blow the joint quick enough. It was just too unrelaxing and flustering.

Best Bar in Vegas! 

That's not just an opinion, either! That's a fact! Just ask my buddy David G. He'll tell you what's up!

Located in the beautiful Cosmo Hotel, The Chandelier is a three story bar that's totally enclosed  with millions of shiny crystals, making it seem like you're actually hanging out  in the middle of a huge chandelier. Each level offers different specialty cocktails, which is awesome. The first floor features a small stage where a live band plays (you can hear the band throughout all three levels). Each level has plenty of seating, whether it's on a couch, chair, love seat or a bar stool. 

If you're like me, you like to go to bars to sit back, relax, sip on delicious cocktails, have a nice conversation with the person/group you are with and to also people watch. The middle section of The Chandelier is perfect for the things I just mentioned. If you're more into being seen, trying to hook up or stand around and move from group to group than the first and third floors will be more of your scene. 

I came here three times on my most recent trip to Vegas. I tried a quite a few of their specialty cocktails, all of which were some of the best I've ever had. My favorite drink of the weekend had to be their Fit to be Thai'd, which reminded me of a super strong white Russian with a hint of peanut butter. Yup, I said peanut butter. They actually put a decent sized scoop of PB in this cocktail while they were mixing/shaking it up (I watched them do it). I also really enjoyed their Cereal Killer, which tasted like spiked cinnamon toast crunch cereal milk. I also had and tasted other drinks but their names and what they were made with escape me at the moment. 

All the bartenders (mixologists) and servers I encountered were all super friendly. The prices here are like any other bar in Vegas ($10-$13 per drink)  but the drinks and the atmosphere are 100% better than any of those other bars. 

My favorite thing about The Chandelier is there are no cover charges, no bouncers, no D bags (at least that I saw in all my visits) and there is massive amounts of available seating, even on the weekends. 

The Chandelier is now my go to bar in Vegas.

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

The Happy Hour here is outstanding!  I've come here a few times after work with friends on Friday nights and the place is packed and lively. I highly recommend you give it a try. 

Yes, I know it's a chain; but you're in for a treat when you come here.  And people just don't leave because it's 7pm and HH is over, some stay till closing.  LOL


AMBIANCE/MOOD:
The buzz and atmosphere on a Friday night is great. It's mostly standing room only, but there are a few bar stools that open from time to time.

Somewhat modern, somewhat eclectic (see photo of the mounted Cadillac bumper), but very relaxed and friendly. The first thing you'll noticed are the three flat screen, but no one is watching. LOL. 

Everyone is just enjoying each other's conversation, whether they're with your group or not. Nice. 

MENU:
I've taken several photos of the HH menu, but it's $5 and $6 for most items. The standouts are the Mexican Street Tacos (addicting and a must) and the $5.00 Chambord Margaritas (they're tasty and strong).  I've also developed a craving for their Roasted Salsa and cheese Queso. 

SERVICE:
If the service wasn't good...  well... you would still would come for the food, but it's very good with all the servers working together. 

The bar staff also seems to just stand in front of their frozen slushy/Margarita machine all night. LOL  They keep making one drink after another. There's a fluidness to how everyone is just hustling. Nice!

FOOD:
I've mentioned the Chambord Margaritas, Street Tacos and Queso, are each good starting points. 

PRICES:
Very inexpensive. Expect to pay $20-25 depending on how hungry you are and how addictive you become to their Margaritas. LOL!!

So Four Stars and "yes, we're a Fan." 

Enjoy!

This place is just a couple miles away from my house, so I have been watching it like a hawk! I came in with my boyfriend on grand opening day (today), which happened to be a Monday, the only day they're suppose to be closed. The place Was fully stocked with EVERYTHING. Macarons in every color of the rainbow, different flavored flans, cakes (whole and slices), eclairs, tarts, cookies, croissants, banquettes, etc. 

We came in for pastries, but my boyfriend ended up with a sandwich combo (iced tea, French onion soup, roast beef/pesto sandwich) for $9.95. I ordered a 12oz latte ($3) and a few macarons ($1.10ea) pistachio, pistachio/chocolate, and rose. 

The soup was very flavorful. I didn't expect it to taste that great, so I was pleasantly surprised. The sandwich was a pretty generous portion, considering the combo price. You get a whole croissant with loads of meat inside. I didn't try it since I'm not a big roast beef fan, but my bf killed it pretty fast, so I'm assuming it was good. 

The espresso was nicely made considering it came from an automatic machine and it went very well with my 3 delicious macarons. The guy accidentally gave me a ginger macaron instead of my rose macaron. Luckily I really like ginger, so it was a satisfying mistake, but I only took a bite before trading it for the rose macaron! All the macarons were very fresh with a light, crisp outer layer and soft center. They all tasted exactly like you would imagine the flavor to taste. When I had a bite of the ginger, I felt like I ate a piece of the actual root! And when I ate the rose macaron, I imagined smelling a bouquet of roses. 

Overall, this place is amazing. I usually expect a few kinks when going to a brand new place, but all the food and pastries we had were amazing. This would've been a 5 star review, but I felt like the customer service wasn't equally distributed. We were sitting just two tables away from a couple that the cashier/server constantly kept checking up on and conversing with without checking up on us a single time, even after I had to exchange the macaron he mistakenly gave me. He even gave the couple some complimentary pastries (not exactly sure what they were) to try. I just feel that he should've at least checked up on us or talked to us if he was going to constantly give them special treatment.

I always told myself that I would go to a local restaurant at least a couple times before giving a bad review, and I tried to go to this place 2 times so here you go. 

After working with a few Ethiopian restaurants in Atlanta on their marketing, I thought it was high time I try out an Ethiopian restaurant myself since I've never been, so when this Groupon popped up I thought perfect! 

As things with expiration dates go, I ended up trying to use this on the day it expired, a Monday, presidents day. Since the time I bought it I've moved away from Gilbert so we made a special trip out here to eat here, and invited my cousin and her husband to join us (even more potential customers, with 2 full paying customers!). 

I tried calling several times since the Groupon mentioned to call ahead, and I wanted to verify the times they were open but nobody ever answered. The recording did say their place was not open on holiday's, but since this is a restaurant and not a bank, I figure a restaurant would be open on presidents day. Apparently Ethiopia celebrates the American presidents now because when the 4 of us pulled up the place was closed. 

To double up on what Marissa said in her review, they did have a sign on the door saying they will accept Groupons until a date in March, I can't remember the exact date but I figure we would just come back and ended up going to San Tan Brewery (read my review for a great dining experience). 

Here is where things go even more south, I called to see how long again they will take that Groupon, Tina answers and starts complaining to me about Groupon, how I had all this time to use it and how she is not taking them anymore. I told her she had a sign on the door and I just wanted to know the date she will take them to. I JUST WANTED TO TRY SOME ETHIOPIAN FOOD!! I said I'd be happy to use just the value I purchased ($13) not the full amount it was good for (a full dinner for 2). She actually has no choice, businesses in Arizona are required to accept the purchase price since it's considered a gift certificate, but not the "groupon" deal. Either way she seemed to lighten up and said just come on in and she'll accept it. 

So that brings me to my 2nd attempt to eat here last Friday, March 23rd. We arrived shortly after 7:00 pm and were relived to see it was open. After walking in, we stood around for a few minutes until this little girl (as in 5 year old) walked into the back (presumably to tell whoever was working back there that people are here), out came someone (not Tina) who proceeded to tell us they were closed. I said I don't understand, there are people eating, the front door was open, it's 7pm on a Friday, but he said they were out of some ingredient and are closed now. 

So that was the last straw. After my 3 experiences with this place, how I was treated over the phone, how they seem to open whenever they want and not accommodate any bit of consideration to their customers, here is my first 1 star review for a restaurant.

I would like to believe that the old Macaroni Grill is back. 

The three of us came here last Saturday night after a long day of Christmas tree shopping and hanging outside lights. We were tired and didn't feel like cooking. We also didn't feel Ike a fancy Italian restaurant meal, but just some good Italian comfort food. 

Our choices in this market segment includes both Macaroni Grill and Maggiano's, along with some wannabes like Olive Garden, Johnny Carino's and Carrabba's. As a family, we continue to favor the two Brinker International concepts. 

As a follow-ups to my previous review, it does indeed appear that the over building under the former corporate owners has ceased.  And a great deal of attention has gone into improving the menu, while keeping some of the older items by their new private VC owners. 

One thing that was lacking in the old setup was a traffic cop of sorts. Now in place, you have a very competent Wait Staff & Service Manager (front of the house) making sure the tables are bused and offering a friendly face to those who are waiting to be seated. This was present in the old place, but it wasn't the high energy job it is now and is a major improvement.

The other improvement as noted last time is the Culinary Manager doing the same thing but between the kitchen staff (back of the house) & wait service. It is still running smoothly. 

We started with a couple of appetizers from their "Choose 2 Tapas" ($9.00) menu of Mama's Spicy Meatballs (no jokes please) and Bruschetta, followed by a salad.  All were very good.  

As for dinner, we ordered the Chicken Parmigiana, Chicken Pasta Milano, along with Mama's Trio (see photos).  All were delicious and we had enough for three boxes for home.

We normally skip dessert, but chose to share a Chocolate Cake.  Here, Macaroni Grill has made a change from their past offering of a chocolate brownie.  The cake comes in a remekin, with a side of chocolate ganache.  Very Nice!

We had a good time, left with some boxes and felt the bill of $64.75 before taxes and tip was fair.  Again, things weren't perfect, but they were a lot better then two years ago when Brinkers had Macaroni Grill on the market and it felt as if the  wheels were coming of this used car concept.  Not anymore, Three and three quarter stars, rounded up to four on this visit.

Enjoy!

Pink Himalayan salt, portobello mushroom fries with aioli, marble flooring...am I at Bottega Louie in L.A.? This place seem all too familiar thanks to Chef Sam Marvin who's behind both Bottega Louie and Echo & Rig. I'm so happy I could eat portobello fries whenever I please now.

Located in suite #120 in Tivoli Village. Across from Brio and Barton gym where there's a roundabout for valet. The only signage you'll find are carcass hanging and pig heads. This is afterall a butcher shop and a steakhouse. You can also buy Terra Blue chips, sauces from here aside from meats.

Our server, Brian was terrific. Great personality and knew the menu inside and out. He informed us that they currently have 3 dessert sundaes: applie pie, mixed berry shortcake and salted caramel. But that they would eventually have 12. He also told us that the 3 top-selling appetizers are octopus, portobello fries (of course!) and tomato watermelon and cucumber. Our busser, Shawn, also did a great job. Our tables were cleared immediately and our drinks were not even half empty and we'd already get another glass of whatever we're drinking.

For our appetizers, we got fried chicken, oyster sliders, portobello fries and grilled octopus. For steaks we had hanger (with Bearnaise), rib eye cap (with blue cheese) and filet mignon (with chimichurri) - all come with homemade garlic chips and mushroom Rockefeller. The sauces were excellent. We got a side of garlic mashed potatoes anyway. For dessert, we tried apple pie sundae and salted caramel sundae.

Fried Chicken:
Crispy fried chicken skin (not breaded), meat was tender and juicy, and the sauce reminds me of Korean fried chicken...the one with sweet brown sauce. 5/5

Portobello Fries:
Breaded and fried strips of portobello sprinkled with parmesan cheese and parsley. Comes with the most wonderful aioli for dipping. One of the reasons I go to Bottega Louie and now they're here. Love it love it love it! 5/5

Grilled Octopus:
Tender grilled pieces of octopus with gigante beans in garlic and green olive vinaigrette. The vinaigrette gives acidity to the perfectly-charred octopus. 5/5

Filet Mignon:
Simply seasoned grass-fed natural beef. This is my favorite cut since I'm not a fan of animal fat (except for pork belly and bacon) and as usual, cooked medium-rare. I got chimichurri to go with it but honestly, the steak doesn't need sauce. 5/5

Apple Pie Sundae:
Vanilla ice cream, half a cookie, apple pie pieces and caramel. 5/5

Salted Caramel Sundae:
Vanilla and coffee ice cream, candied peanuts, toffee bits and salted caramel. 4/5

The prices are totally reasonable. $35 for a good piece of steak? Oh, c'mon! For everything we ate, we only spent $160. We also got a complimentary bowl of cauliflower with chili. The only thing missing is macarons. Bottega Louie does have the best macarons in this country that isn't Laduree. So, when the day comes they start to carry macarons here, I've no reason to go back to L.A.!

A rating on Yelp is just an average, and after 300 plus reviews I think 2&1/2 stars is a little harsh.  After Yelp filters some reviews its up to us to decipher  the reviews that are left.  I've noticed several bad reviews recently for Cabo Wabo's & I must say I am surprised.  

We arrived on a Thursday night & knew we would probably have to kill some time drinking while we waited for a seat, tough life I know.  We were pleasantly surprised when we were sat immediately at the outdoor bar over looking the strip with a clear view of the fountains shooting off across the street @ Bellagio.  When the wind blew just right we could feel  the mist from the fountains, which felt so good in the dry Vegas heat.  Cabo Wabo's was crazy packed but the bar back grabbed us some menus & took initiative getting us our first round of drinks (frozen margaritas & red bull vodkas) while we waited for our server to machete her way threw the weeds she was knee deep in.  It was a gorgeous night to catch up with my Pops & his wife who live here in Las Vegas & we could not have had a better time.   

I can't stress enough how if you go into a restaurant with a chip on your shoulder anticipating bad service your gonna have a shitty experience.  You live in and or you are visiting a great city to party and have fun.   Raise your glass, have a drink, do a shot.... and chill out!  I thought the the food came out in a reasonable time and had no complaints with my service.   The guacamole & chips were money, the chicken chimichangas were as good as it gets (especially after kicking back several margaritas).   I thought my fish tacos with beans & rice were the bomb & devoured every bite.   I was so happy I got my dad to to eat some Mexican fare that night it could not have gotten any better.  This was one bill I had no problem picking up & we will be back on our next visit to Las Vegas.

I know the reviews are mixed but I would roll the dice & check it out!

Wow, where do I begin? I think this was by far the worst service I have ever received in a restaurant. I came with a group of 8 for lunch at 11am on a Wednesday. We had stopped by earlier in the day and made a reservation and we were looking forward to trying a new spot.

Our waitress (Liz I believe) was the only redeeming part of the entire incident that followed. (If I was rating her I would give 5 stars). Our food orders took an eternity and we watched all the people who had came in after us getting their food. Our waitress stopped by to warn us about the wait on the food, so we ordered some chips to tide us over. 

I ordered the Veggie Rice bowl (which was described as mixed peppers, squash onions, ect and either rice or pasta) I asked for no rice add  the Vegan Carne Asada.

What was brought out came in a to-go container that was about 1/4 full (think typical Chinese food container). I thought perhaps it was the side of carne and inquired with the waitress to see where the rest of the bowl was. (Where was the pasta, grilled veggies ect?) Did someone get hungry and eat it on the way to my table?

She came back with some guy who looked in need of a shower. He asked me what the problem was, and when I explained there was nothing here but the carne asada
 he got defensive and argued with me. There was no offer to bring the pasta, or add veggies. He basically beat on his chest, pushed a menu in my face and told me he was the executive chef "Joey" and that he would never order a rice bowl without the rice. I was astounded at his aggression and rudeness. If I owned this joint he would be out of a job. This is no "House of Tricks" buddy, it's a bar that plays lunch spot by day and your pompous attitude earns no merit badge.

Some other highly medicated looking guy came by later and asked me what the problem was and basically chuckled when I told him and asked if he could do anything. I was afraid the "executive chef" Joey would spit in my food so I declined, I couldn't get out of that place fast enough. Liz apologized and you could tell she honestly felt bad about the exchange. 

I will never come back to this place and I'll  tell everyone I know to avoid it. I've worked on Mill 15 years and have seen hundreds of restaurants fail over the years, I know this one won't last. Not with the absolute insolence and discourtesy they assault their customers with. 

(And they charge $5 bucks for chips and salsa - GET REAL)!

It's in the name. They like to smash burgers! The menu says they use 100% certified angus beef. The burgers are fresh, never frozen, and cooked to order. If you prefer chicken instead of burgers you can find that here too.

Yesterday I picked up my favorite the "Avocado Club" (crispy chicken) for lunch priced at $6.99 and it was delicious. The all white meat crispy chicken has nice flavor. The sandwich had bacon that was freshly cooked, not microwaved or something questionable. Also the sandwich has lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing on it. I love the fries! I'm not picky about how skinny or fat my fries are as long as they are good and these fries paired with the garlic they put on them makes for a nice side to your sandwich or burger. The "Fried Pickles" priced at $2.29 are not good at all here. I have tried them twice now and they are way too greasy. 

They offer a few different salads if burgers and chicken aren't your thing. Also on the menu is the "Spicy Black Bean Burger"  for you veggie burger eaters. For dessert (like you have room) they offer Haagen-Dazs shakes! They range in price from $3.99 - $4.29 and you can get classic vanilla, chocolate and strawberry or you can go for a oreo or nutter butter shake. The "Nutter Butter" is super tasty. There is a kids menu and they serve Coke products (yay coke) and beer. 

I must admit that I only ever come here with a coupon. I signed up for the e-mail club and for my birthday I get a free shake and throughout the year I get coupons for BOGO on entrees. I always present my coupons before I place my order and have never had an issue. There is a offer with your yelp check-in for 10% off any SB meal, but they wont let you combine it with a coupon you already plan to use so I haven't even redeemed mine yet. Nice lunch spot especially with a coupon.

"Bonjour, mon ami.  Lardons, si vous plait"

Located conveniently by the hotel elevators at the Paris Las Vegas hotel, Le Cafe Ile St. Louis offers French American cuisine, specializing in breakfast/brunch.  A cute facade makes diners feel they are in city of lights, with dining inside or "al fresco", which in this case means overlooking the casino floor.  I chose to sit "al fresco" both times I dined here, as it gave ample opportunity to people watch, both those gambling & those walking by, and to enjoy the filtered casino air.  I assumed seating inside would be rather stuffy.

As previously mentioned, I dined at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis on two occasions, for dinner then for breakfast the next day.  Here's the 411-

Dinner - There was very little wait & was quickly led to a table.  While waiting for my order to arrive, crusty bread & butter were placed on our table-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ
By crusty, I mean crusty.  The outer layer of bread was as crusty as my tidy whities after my first wet dream.  Yes, that crusty!  Inside, though, was airy & soft.  The butter was crack to me.  I asked for another helping of it, as I was liberally dousing each piece of bread w/ butter.  I even helped myself to spoonfuls applied directly to mouth, w/o the interference of bread.

Calamari - Fried squid w/ crispy onions, fennel, lemon & a dijon mustard vinaigrette $12-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#kVwRy-qO3v8PJYyLn5u9aw
This was delicious.  Generous portions, fried crisp & light with a captivating vinaigrette.  I asked for more of said vinaigrette because I was bathing each piece of calamari and/or onion with it.  

Burger and foie gras - Angus beef, pate de foie gras, caramelized apples, balsamic gastrique on a brioche bun w/ pomme frites $18-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#MeXfEou-G1FANcmYRGUT5w
Tres bien!  What sold it for me was the foie gras, a food item that was recently banned for sale in California.  It's like meat butter.  I delighted in the medium-rare goodness-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#b40GDQLSlIUeiYa7GWeWQw
The pomme frites (french fries) were, sadly, soggy & limp.  I guess they spent too much time w/ the Paris go-go dancer the previous night ;p She sure knew how to twerk it, so I don't blame the fries for being limp LOL

Creme brulee $8 - 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#I2QqmkDyFQxm4iGwkx9Y_A
Ahhh, the crispy sugar shell forming a roof over the thick creme underneath.  This was magnifique!  I savored each & every bite, delighting in the burnt flavoring of the sugary shell.

Breakfast - There was about a 5 min wait, so it wasn't long before being seated "al fresco".  Complimentary toasted bread of choice was provided.  I chose sourdough & extra of that fantastic butter.  

Corned beef hash w/ two poached eggs $15 -
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#Lbn2VWRXcYHOWnJDlIpQ2A
Hearty, rich, stick to your ribs good!  I relished each & every bite, as the runny egg yolks slithered down the hash, making for a delectable meal.  Quality portions, worth the $15.

Cafe latte $5 - This could French kiss my derriere.  Weak coffee in a small cup.  I thought the Europeans were known for how strong they like their coffee.  This was more like Folgers.  The Gevalia I brew at home is leaps & bounds better than this drivel.

Service was good, as extra butter was brought out & drinks were refilled.  Seating is plentiful throughout, w/ my recommendation of dining "al fresco".

I enjoyed my 2 dining experiences here at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis.  It's Vegas, so the prices can be a little high for what you get, but I mostly enjoyed the food I had the pleasure of eating here.  Plus, the convenience of having the restaurant located right outside the hotel elevators make stopping here a breeze.

Recommend!

Au revoir!

If an AYCE sushi buffet simply offered fresh fish and all the usual suspects for rolls, it would have automatically been 3-4 stars a few years ago.  But fortunately for people in LV, this isn't the case anymore since so many spots have stepped up their game post-Goyemon.  

While the service and atmosphere are good, hot rice, some weird interpretations of what they think is "Japanese" and fusion missteps will be the biggest reasons I won't be a returning customer. 

Getting into details... 

- I know not to expect authentic cold, well seasoned sushi rice at AYCE but straight out of the cooker is bad.
  
- What they have on the menu as "okonomiyaki" is NOT that.  I've eaten hundreds of okonomiyaki and this was by far the whackest one of all.  Ketchup on top?  The consistency of a crepe?  Everyone sells a roll called "something wrong".  Maybe they should call this the "something wrong pancake".  

- They put a deep fried shrimp head into the miso soup.  Try having that fly well with a native Japanese (my wife).

- Amaebi was terrible.  They drenched the thing in sauce and then put tobiko on top.  I assume this was just their way of covering up something else.  

- Steamed pork belly was weird.  Koreans eat it this way?  That's like steaming high end bacon.

And finally, they had a sushi roll with peanut butter on it.  Not a typo.  My mind's telling me nooooo..but my BODY.  While I respect them for trying to push the fusion envelope, this was terrible.  Peanut butter, avocado, shrimp tempura with crab and fried coconut on top tastes like you would imagine it would.  I don't understand why they thought this would be good.  If they wanted to be extreme, make the whole roll that way.  Pork belly or beef would have been better choices to combine with PB than shrimp and then just put Cheetos all over the mofo.  

Tetsuro P. saw that I had checked in here and stopped in to say hello which was cool.  He asked if what they were doing was authentic and I just said "no" without going into any detail since we were right in front of the sushi chef.  

Not to say it was a complete loss, there were some good parts.  Their "bomb" which was wrapped in avocado was decent.  The waitress mainly recommended Korean dishes like bulgogi and their skewers which we skipped since we had plans to eat Korean the next day.  I also enjoyed their yellowtail jalapeno.  But it won't be enough for me to come here again.  I would go to Umiya (both Korean owned) over this any day of the week.

Very disappointed! It's exactly what you expect to find in a pawn shop. Only difference is, they just happen to be famous because their shop is on the History channel. 

Here's a typical day at this place. When you pull up to their building, it's recognizable cuz of what you see on tv. Otherwise it looks just like any other pawn shop place anywhere else.  If you see people lined up outside to get in, chances are you won't find any parking. Wait times vary from 30 mins to an hour (Come on, really? For a pawn shop? SMH). At least if you are in line they have those water sprinkler thingies that spray out mists of water to keep you cool. (about the only positive thing I think). Once you get to the door, there is usually a rude security guy that tells you where to go. When you get in, there is a divider in the middle that directs the flow of traffic like an oval track at a raceway. You will see various items (mostly overpriced). You can stop and look but only if you are actually interested in purchasing something is when the attendants behind the counter will actually talk to you. You'll be lucky if whoever helps you knows anything about what is in the glass cases. I think these people were hired mainly just to make sure nobody does a smash and grab. About halfway down towards the back are mostly pawn shop souvenirs. From what I saw it was mainly Chumlee souvenirs. Why? Go figure. Then you basically do a U-turn and you are on your way out. 

The most bogus thing about this place is the hours of operation. Outside it says 24 hours but you soon find out when you show up late at night that only the pawn shop portion of the place is open 24/7. That means if you have actual merchandise you wanna sell or pawn, you can come in. The portion I mentioned earlier, the day I went that section closed at 9 pm. So if you are just a tourist, the rude security guard at the entrance will announce the store section is now closed, if you are not here to sell or buy any actual display items, then get out. Only the pawn shop section is open 24 hours. I suggest you call them first before you go there because they might be filming or have changed their hours.

As for the actual Pawn Stars people. Don't get too excited. These guys dont actually man the counters. They are usually in the back doing whatever. That is if they are actually there. I was told they only show up for filming and occasional courtesy visits. People tell me that Rick and his old man are really anal if you just happen to catch them. They tend to blow you off thinking they dont have any time for you and that they have more important things to do. Chumlee is a little more receptive and laid back. You'll be lucky if any of these guys even know you are standing there. They got their show so I think that's why they don't care too much for "tourists".

So overall, don't waste your time. I live here so that's why I gave them 2 stars. Yes it's a tourist spot but if you really need to check it out then I suggest you include this on your way to Fremont Experience. It sucks if you paid money for a cab only to be disappointed especially if your hotel and points of interest are off of the main strip.  If you are visiting from out of town, hopefully you have read this first BEFORE you went out there. Otherwise, if you are reading this while in line or afterwards, you will probably give it only 1 star.

I have had this place on my Yelp bookmarks ever since this place opened up in Vegas about 9 months ago. I finally got to try it recently!

Walking in the place is a small and quaint. There are roughly less than 10 tables and they put together a couple for our party of 7. When we first got there, we stood at the front for a couple minutes because there was no host to greet us or seat us. It turns out only one guy was working that day. He actually turned out to be a pretty pleasant and nice server. I unfortunately did not catch his name but he was a young Filipino guy who was very accommodating and friendly).

This place is not a turo-turo where items are already cooked and you just choose. Each dish is freshly prepared and cooked after you order.

We ordered the following:
Chop suey (mixed vegetables): $7.99 (on the special menu that day)
Caldereta (beef dish): $11.99 (on the special menu that day)
Sugpa liempo (pork belly slices): $12.99 (family size) 
Pancit bam-i (noodles): $9.99 (family size) 
Boneless bangus (milkfish): $12.99
Ngo-Yong (egg roll): free with yelp check-in

Each dish came with 1 scoop of rice

Although we ordered the family size portions, many of the dishes could also be ordered solo size for a smaller portion.

From what we ordered, taste wise I liked the Ngo-Yong eggroll (crispy and delicious), sugpa liempo (flavorful and tender pork belly) and the pancit-bami (good mix of noodles). 

Portion wise some dishes like the Caldereta and the chop suey were small. I thought these were a little pricey for what we got. I also wished the Ngo-Yong egg roll was bigger. It was small and I left wanting more of it because it was that good! The best value were the pancit bam-i and sugpa liempo.

One thing to note when paying is that for parties of 6 or more they add 18% gratuity automatically to your meal.

Overall, I really enjoyed the food here! It was delicious! That Ngo-Yong egg roll is my new favorite. I am very happy to have another place for authentic Filipino eats in Vegas!

I wanted to move to Agritopia when my ex and I were looking for a big old house in east Gilbert.  I urged him to consider Agritopia.  I extolled the virtues of the charming neighborhoods, tree lined streets, real front porches, alley accessed garages, the centrally located elementary school for our son, the availability of fresh produce raised within the subdivision, and I went on and on but he wasn't having it.  I think he secretly suspected that I was trying to indoctrinate him into some new fangled 21st century commune or something.  

Now I realize exactly what I did wrong.  I didn't force him to come get a meal at Joe's Farm Grill, which just happens to be within a stone's throw to Agritopia and also uses Agritopia's produce garden.  (Or maybe it's Joe's Farm Grill garden and Agritopia uses it?  I dunno, but I do know the two are somehow linked.)    If I had only dragged him into Joe's Farm Grill I could have sealed the deal, I'm sure of it.

Joe's is a really neat little place, surrounded by towering Tamarack trees that have been there forever.  The structure was originally the late 1950's to early 1960's ranch style family home (and former farm) of the same family that now owns Joe's.  Also the family has two other top-notch restaurants, Joe's Real BBQ and Liberty Grill.  The house has since been professionally and radically retrofitted into be a sleek, yet still somehow retro, restaurant, with bathrooms that are so fun and funky that you just have to go there and see for yourself what I mean.  (Trust me.)  The restaurant still retains the old front room of the original house, including the fire place, and it is now a dining room.  It's not hard at all to imagine Joe's family settled around their Christmas tree in their pajamas in the mid-1960's opening presents, completely oblivious to the fact that someday their front room would be a seating area for one of the best places to eat in the whole damn Valley.  Yep, I said it: One of the best places to eat in the whole damn Valley; that is NO exaggeration.

The food here is amazing.  It's wildly flavorful, perfectly cooked, and deliciously paired with different sides and it's all reasonably priced to boot.  They know what they do here, and they do it perfectly.  My personal favorite here is the seared Ahi Tuna sandwich with a Wasabi dressing.  I can't even describe how good it is.  It's just a flat out flavor bomb.  (Tip: I will reiterate that the tuna is seared, so if you get it and are expecting a fully cooked tuna steak you will be confused and perhaps even disappointed; don't be, just eat it and savor the deliciousness of a perfectly seared tuna steak on a toasted bun with a wonderful Wasabi dressing and a zesty Asian slaw.)  It is my favorite sandwich from anywhere, ever.  I have also tasted their pizzas, burgers, hot dogs, shakes (come topped with a green cherry!) and French fries and all have been outstanding.  I really cannot find a single criticism for this place.

Oh wait, I just thought of one criticism; that there isn't a Joe's Farm Grill closer to my home, since my ex refused to let us buy a house there.   *pout*

I came here for the latest get together of the Breakfast Club. We usually get together on Saturday and not quite so early but this time we had to go Sunday because of other events and went early to beat the crowds. I didn't know it was a chain. Of course I had never even heard of it before but I'm glad I did. We sat outside I think because there were so many of us but it was great weather for it. I poked my head inside and it was very nice.
Even though there were 14 or 16 of us, I lost count, our server did a great job. She was always checking on us and refilling drinks. Sure it took a little while but we were a large group. I like how they let you mix and match things to create just what you want. I got the blueberry pancakes and the French toast. I got the toned down French toast because I'm not a fan of coconut and something else that was on it. But it was still really good and so where the pancakes. I saw some good looking Benedicts around the table. I will have to try one of those next time because this time I was in the mood for pancakes then the French toast sounded really good too.
I had a great time. Saw some Yelp friends that I feel like I haven't seen in a long time plus I got to sit next to one of my favorite Yelpers the beautiful Cheryl. I will definitely be back. I want to try some of the other things on the menu but the pancakes and French toast were great. I could not even finish the pancakes. They were huge but so good. I had to stop myself from eating more.
Shout out to some Yelp friends: Meagan B, it was nice to met your stunt double lol your Mom, and Jennifer O and her husband and the staples of any great Yelp event Jon H. and Amy H. See you guys later.

I can safely say this was my first time even remotely being excited to eat Italian food on the strip.  Currently the hottest restaurant in the city, Giada is bringing in the masses nightly.  I thought 90 days ahead of my 7th wedding anniversary would be adequate lead time for a 7pm-ish dinner on a Tuesday, but we ended up with 9pm.  Not a big deal.  That meant more drinks at the bar!  I had a few tasty "Flash Gordon" cocktails that made me feel semi-invincible; the sensation was unfortunately fleeting as I felt like Ming the Merciless had pointed his stupid ring to my head in the AM.  

If you do one thing above anything else with your time at Giada, my advice would be to wait for a premium table.  The hostess initially walked us to a less than favorable area with only a partial strip view.  Despite her warning that it could take half an hour or more for a better spot, we stayed strong and went back to the bar.  Luckily, she came back in less than 15 minutes and brought us to an excellent table with grand views of Bellagio and Caesars Palace.  

Like Rod U. said in his excellent review, antipasti are where it's at.  If I could do it all over again, I would order more small plates of seafood, salumi, cheese, crostini, salumi, cheese, seafood and cheese.  The burrata was magnificent.  It was a creamy, mozzarella dream that tasted more heavenly as I got to the center.  Accompanying this glorious gift from cows with anything else more than olive oil, garnish and balsamic salt would have been offensive.  

I had some serious doubts about the waiter's recommendation of the "Prosciutto San Daniele" since we recently had Carnevino's "Prosciutto di Parma Riserva", but that all went away when the first slice melted in my mouth.  As unimaginable to me as it could be, it was better than Batali's.  The waiter had tried Mario's as well and agreed. Not that he was biased or anything.....

Another highlight was Giada's signature spaghetti with 2 large shrimp, lemon and basil.  She really loves her citrus as it's all over the menu.  It was wonderful!  The handmade pasta was superb and the light cream sauce at the bottom of the bowl was well worth sopping up with the shrimp.  I am a huge sucker for fresh pasta.

Although the "Veal Chop Saltimbocca" was an impressive looking entre in size, I felt it was underwhelming and quite plain.  This wasn't the kind of place that had salt and pepper shakers at the table, but I would have reached for some.  The massive leftover we brought home will definitely be getting some seasonal treatment.  The sauce it came with took it nowhere.  I wished we had given the branzino a shot instead.  At least the asparagus it came with was outstanding.  The wood grill brought out a whole new dimension of flavor to the standard upscale restaurant vegetable.  

The dessert cart they rolled out made final decisions tough but the strawberry tart, blackberry lime tiramisu and white coffee gelato (I'd bath in it) were great conclusions to an overall solid meal.  With dinner clocking in at almost 3 hours, Giada isn't a dinner before a show kind of place, this is the show.

While other restaurants market themselves as being different, Bazaar Meat delivers the goods. With a massive menu -- physically heavier than most and with more variety of items than other steakhouses -- this place really is unique. As soon as I learned their opening date I snagged reservations for our party of four. I'm typically weary of new restaurants, but as a fan of Jose Andres I had to give it a shot.

From beginning to end our meal was outstanding. To start, a dozen oysters ($34) -- six medium sized, briny and meaty Paradise oysters and six small, more mild Kusshi oysters. There are four types of tartares on the menu. The classic ($24) is prepared tableside and served with parker house rolls. Don't be afraid to make yourself a steak tartare slider, I did and it was fantastic.

The list of starters is where Andres' influence is most evident with items like cotton candy foie gras, tacos, chicharron, and croquetas. The dish that jumped out at me, though, was the s'mores ($30). Four to an order. Each with wafer thin graham crackers sandwiching slivers of chocolate, velvety smooth and rich foie, and torched and blistered hunks of marshmallow. Try to stay composed after eating one. It's impossible. They're so good you'll be banging the table or letting some expletives fly out of shear amazement. They are sweet, so next time I might consider getting them as a dessert.

Side dishes are delicious as well. Andres takes a playful jab at Joel Robuchon's pomme puree with his own rendition of mashed potatoes ($15) with a menu description that reads, "butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes." On the lighter side are the Brussels sprouts petals ($12), served with grapes, apricots, lemon air, and lemon puree. My favorite side was the baby corn ($13). Grilled and topped with mayo, chile piquin, and popcorn powder it's the perfect combo of heat and sweetness.

Our group shared the Spanish-style bone-in rib eye ($80/lb) from Washugyu Ranch, Oregon. It's cooked on their Josper grill (part oven, part grill. Google it. I had to and it looks cool.) using charcoal and grape leaves, giving it plenty of smokiness. It isn't cheap at $80 a pound. Our steak came in at 3.13 pounds, which equals an empty wallet at the end of the night. But, it's one of the best I've had in town. 

Desserts are on the small side. They're about the size of single serving buffet desserts.  We ordered ten ($25) consisting of five different types served in a cute bakery-style box. The order: dark chocolate and olive oil cream puff; dark chocolate and aged rum cake; caramelized puff pastry with bacon, strawberries and cream; milk chocolate peanut, and caramel tart; and caramelized puff pastry with chocolate, caramel and sea salt. All were great, particularly the dark chocolate cake and the bacon and strawberry puff pastry.

Service was exceptional all night. Our server (formerly of L'Atelier) and busser offered great recommendations and checked in frequently to make sure all of our needs were met. The only negative is that their dessert menu didn't list all ingredients for the dishes. My friend, who has a nut allergy, reacted to hazelnuts in the dark chocolate and aged rum cake forcing her to rush home after dinner for allergy medicine. Luckily, she was fine and we had a fantastic meal. Bazaar Meat might be the new kid on the block, but in my book they're already one of the top three steak houses in Vegas.

Have you often wondered why so many middle-aged  Japanese people here in Las Vegas always tell you that they go to SUSHI ON RAINBOW for sushi instead of the multi-million dollar bankrolled sushi restaurants like Kabuto or Goyemon? Why do these former or current Japanese nationals prefer to eat at an older sushi bar that doesn't have fancy or exciting dcor? The answer is that SUSHI ON RAINBOW to MANY of us people of Japanese descent is actually a symbol of pride for our community. And, the owner is a very respected man to us Japanese-Americans.

When I was a little kid in Southern California, I first heard about Shogo-san and the famous sushi restaurant in Newport Beach. Sushi just did not exist in the area. Everytime a sushi restaurant poped up, it would quickly go out of business. Remember that sushi, and the idea of eating raw fish was not accepted by the American mainstream back then. The sushi bar that Shogo worked at was the only sushi bar in the area that had made it. Japanese people would drive 50+ miles just to eat there. Shogo-San was one of the 1st generation sushi chefs, along with the famous Ichiro Mashita who came to America from Japan with a dream to one day popularize sushi in America. They had to endure so much hardships during those days, but like most Japanese and Asian-Americans during that era, they fought hard to find success in the land of opportunity. Today, there is a Sushi bar on every street due to their labor. So, when I found out that Shogo had purchased SUSHI ON RAINBOW from the original owner, I was ecstatic! A great legend of California Sushi was now here in Las Vegas! This was a dream come true. 

Shogo-san has over 40 years of Sushi experience. During his youth in Kyushu, he was a very respected edo style sushi chef. Went through years of apprenticeship before he even get the opportunity to the touch the actual fish. Today, his years of experience really shows. Though the majority of his day revolves around making California Rolls for westerners, there is also a "secret menu" for those who appreciate real sushi. What I love is how every week they got something different. I've had an Edo Chirashizushi, Shinko, Engawa, a Uni-Ika mix, Maguro no Zuke, Yamaimo, and many other traditional Japanese dishes that aren't in any other J-restaurant in town. Every time I eat here I feel even more proud to have Japanese blood in my veins. 

Unlike most sushi bars in LV, SUSHI ON RAINBOW get's all it's items from true Japanese and Japanese-American distributors. The fish is from a real Japanese seafood distributor(not a Korean distributor), that get's their fish from cold waters such as Canada, and Alaska. Fish from colder waters will have meat that has more of that fatty marbling that we enjoy so much. Even the Japanese ice creams(plum wine, green tea) come from a famous Japanese ice cream company in Torrance.  

If you are a true sushi lover, the 1st thing you will notice is how Shogo's nigiri technique is unrealistically perfect compared to the other Sushi joints in town. Remember that he has had over 40 years experience. You will see immediately that even the chefs at Kabuto don't have his precision. And the funniest thing is that Shogo is very humble + modest and doesn't even brag about how great he is.

There used to be a guy named Hiro-san who worked here who was also a former edomaezushi chef from Japan.  Holy crap, that guy was like the best chef I had ever seen. But, he retired a few months ago. That totally depressed the hell out of me. 

Kyuu-chan is their new apprentice sushi chef. He is of Chinese descent but he makes a lot of Japanese chefs look like amateurs due to his amazing talent. Shogo is such a a hardcore Japanese man, that he made Kyuu learn how to speak Japanese to be a chef here. He also made the Latino cooks in the back learn Japanese, or they couldn't work. It's the coolest thing ever! There is so much old school Japanese discipline in this kitchen. But, Shogo himself is such a friendly and positive guy. You can talk to him for hours. And the coolest thing about him is that he knows everything about Japanese history and pop culture! I've had the most fascinating conversations with him.

I love coming to SUSHI ON RAINBOW and showing my respect to these great Japanese heroes. Also, every time I come here it's like that scene in "Goodfellas" when Robert DeNiro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they get him whatever he wants, and they even got a spot saved for him. I NEVER order here, all I say is "Omakase" and they take care of everything for me. 

I've written 100s of Yelp reviews, but SUSHI ON RAINBOW is my absolute favorite restaurant in not just Las Vegas, but the whole world.

We went to the Urban Tap this past Sunday for Brunch.  I LOVE brunch... The only early meal that's not only acceptable to booze, but encouraged!  After searching a few other Brunch stops we agreed we were intrigued by their menu.  What initially was going to be a group brunch turned into an intimate meal with my husband and friend Chelsea S in the good ole Saaahside.  

Parking here was so convenient, something not to be taken for granted in the South Side.  There is a lot basically right next to the restaurant that is free on Sundays.  We arrived shortly after noon, the atmosphere was very nice, modern, and I absolutely loved the open windows at the front of the place giving it a lovely airy feeling on a beautiful pre-autumn day.  I already cheated, as I usually do, and studied the menu online prior to brunch so I was pretty set on what I was going to order, as was the hubs.  Please note, the menu provided online is not exactly correct and does need updated.  For instance, they no longer offer bottomless mimosas.  You can order a carafe for $10.00 which gives you about 5-6 glasses.  I also noticed their online menu mentions pork belly in a few dishes but their actual menu has no such reference.  All was ok, as we order a carafe of mimosas which turned into 3 carafes before we concluded.  I chose the Breakfast Pierogie Saut, as the H got the Eggs Benedict two ways.  Both dishes online said "pork belly" but in house it was I believe sausage in mine and a cured ham in his.  

The wait staff was pleasant, efficient, and never let us wait long for service.  Our food came out in a reasonable time, actually almost perfect for brunch meaning not too quick, but not too long, so we had time to chat and drink and enjoy the leisure of Sunday Brunch like one should.  When our meals were served they did not disappoint.  My saut as I can detail contained a type of hash mixed saut veg and sausage, with a nice balance of sweet and heat, topped with two plump pillow pierogies, laying underneath two sunny side up eggs finally topped with some mustard.  The richness of the egg yolk when cut through rolled throughout the dish coating all elements that lay beneath.  It was quite delectable, perfect portion, at a very reasonable price.  I tried the eggs benedict and it was also really good, but I would have liked more hollandaise as it was mostly drizzled on the eggs.  The cornbread base was unique.  Never had a benny prepared like that.  Again very distinctive and original.   

We stayed for a couple hours enjoying our food and drinks, actually long enough that many people were filtering in for the lunch fare.  We noticed many other dishes coming out that looked amazing and smelled even better.  I think I will have to come back here to try their other menus soon...

Exhilarating pre fixe menu that showcases the chef's masterful culinary skills!

Located in the beautiful themed garden of the Bellagio, the restaurant's sleek blond wood interior was both intimate and inviting.  Set against soft lighting, the dining space was conducive to a festive and celebratory evening with good friends and at first glance of the tasting menu, i was looking forward to the exciting evening ahead. 

The Breads: Warm sourdough & honey wheat rolls came out nice & hot with a side of lightly salted soft butter. The sourdough was my personal favorite with its nice buttery crust and warm chewy center.

Our party of four didn't need much coaxing as we almost instantly decided on the all inclusive chef's tasting menu with wine pairings, which included the famous lobster pot pie!  

Tuna Tartare - Fresh plump ruby red tuna prepared table side with bright vibrant colors that was definitely a sight to see!  The ancho chili and fresh mint pumped up the volume by adding a tangy zing to this remarkable dish and the pine nuts added a pleasant rustic contrast of texture and rounded out the flavor profiles nicely!

Caviar Parfait - Magnificent! Served atop airy light creme fraiche and a crisp potato cake, each bite was magical! The bubbly paired perfectly with this exquisitely enjoyable dish!

Lobster Pot Pie - Outstanding! I was anxiously anticipating this dish and i am happy to admit that it did not disappoint! As soon as the server carved away the warm golden crust, the sweet smell of buttery lobster wafted into the air and i was mesmerized! As i glanced down into my ramekin, i could see chunks of juicy lobster bathed in brandied lobster cream and it made my mouth instantly water!  I simply love pot pie and lobster has always been on my guilty pleasure list, so the combination for me was a match made in foodie heaven! 

American Kobe Rib Eye - Perfection! The kobe beef was exceptionally moist, tender and buttery! Oh, and yes, it melted in my mouth! Hot dayam, what i'd give to sink my teeth into this luscious piece of premium meat again! Let's not forget about the sides! The butter poached porcini was rich and flavorful while the creamed corn was decadence in every bite!

The tasting menu ended with several small dessert items that showcased the chef's whimsical approach to sweets including a magnificent root beer float, a cookie served with hot mulled apple cider, chocolate bon bons, chocolate chip cookies and a glazed chocolate brownie with cocoa nib ice cream & spiced pecans. 

In a few words, it was literally death by chocolate!!!....and oh what a way to die!

The wine pairings were 100% spot on compliments to our meals. With that said, our server was nothing short of professional, helpful, and friendly.  It was great having friendly conversation with everyone but still enjoy the formalities of fine dining. 

What more could a birthday boy ask for?

***Todd English PUB offers many entrees that are not that expensive when compared to other celebrity chef backed Vegas restaurants, but the food was mediocre; I will probably seek out Todd English's Olives (The Bellagio) instead on my next Vegas trip***

We were in Las Vegas and were looking for a decent but still reasonably priced dinner spot so we decided to head to Todd English PUB.  I was impressed with Todd English's food at the LA Food & Wine Festival and had high hopes for this one (even though I knew that Todd English PUB was going to be much more casual and simple fare).

The atmosphere was very raucous.  It very much had a gastropub feel and it was quite loud.  There was also a seating area outside with heat lamps (unfortunately, since Todd English PUB is located in a congested area, you have to deal with several smokers nearby).

The menu consisted of a wide variety of food from several fried appetizers to burgers and sandwiches as well as some English pub grub like fish and chips and bangers and mash.

We started with the ahi tuna on wonton crackers, which was the best dish of the night.  While expensive, the starter was good.  The ahi tuna was nicely mixed with seaweed and gingered sesame vinaigrette.  The tuna mixture sat on light and crispy fried wontons.  The tuna was fresh.  It was also quite spicy.

I also had the bangers and mash.  The mashed potatoes were good.  They were very light for mashed potatoes and had a good flavor.  They kind of reminded me of the mashed potatoes at Nick & Stef's in Downtown LA.  The bangers were quite bland though.  They were moist enough, but they had very little flavor.  They sat on a creamy mustard sauce, which was also bland.

I tried some of my friend's fries, which were just okay (a little soft).  My friend mentioned that the fish and chips were bland.

Service was decent.  The staff was friendly, but it was hard to flag down our waiter at times (which is a common problem when you eat outside and the outside dining area is not that connected to the inside dining area).

Prices were not too bad for Las Vegas.  There were several entrees below $20.  However, for the quality of food, you can find better gastropub food in other cities at similar or lower prices.

Though we liked the ahi tuna on wonton crackers, the entrees were very disappointing and I am not sure if the other entrees would be any better.  I did like the little sampling of Todd English's food at the LA event (and he is a very charming, funny and smart guy), but I think his more upscale Olives in The Bellagio is probably a better representation of his skills in the kitchen.

Todd English PUB is located right next to Aria.  Aria has its own free parking structure and it is easy to find a space (valet parking is also available).

Two things I uphold above all in my reviews:

Customer service & food (quality, taste, veg options)

When I first walk in to order food to-go door girl or Naomi from what I spotted greets me with a scowl on her face and asks if I want a table. No, ordering out. can I have a menu please? she says "Order at the counter" ... Can-I-have-a-menu-PLEASE?
"Oh, u want a menu.... here. " she hands me a stack. I put the overflow back. She's still scowling. 

Finally, I decide what I want and approach the counter/cooking area. Sunny takes my order with a cheerful smile on her face and was extremely helpful in putting together a combo option for what I was ordering and directing me that when I was ready I could pay and pick up my food at the front where I originally was. I thanked her and went back to pissy pants. 

Door girl doesn't even smile, says "You ready to pay?"... then as I take a seat in the waiting area, I wasn't sure if Sunny knew where I was sitting but I noticed her maybe 10 minutes later with an order looking around. 

I ask door girl if my order is ready and she literally rolls her eyes and says "She'll bring it over when it's ready lady"

..... (these dots represent the angered pause in my head)

Finally, a different waitress approaches me and asks what I ordered and subsequently brought me the order as Sunny was held up with another guest. 

As I leave, Sunny had run outside to find me still in my car and politely said "You forgot your strawberries!" I thanked her and the 3rd waitress for their polite and prompt customer service. 

Sunny should be appreciated or promoted to show her level of excellent customer interaction. it was very pleasant!

Naomi "door girl" should be fired. In a customer facing role as the first person that guests see and that first impression that is crucial for return business, she is seriously offering a lack of enthusiasm and disservice. 

I am a return guest because I do love the quality of food here, and this location is close to my home and the hours offered for late breakfast! but customer service is about 50/50 currently with her as the "face" of Egg Works.

Upon my second visit to Lobby's I tried the Italian Beef Sandwich.  WOW!  Go hungry if you're gonna get this one cause it is HUGE!  And it's really more of a knife and fork sandwich.  Oh sure, you can try to eat it like a sandwich but you're probably going to be picking up a lot of the filling with your fork so just cut it up and get every bite the first time.  The beef is so tender and tasty!  YUM!.  

Let me speak about customer service for a moment.  I love being treated like a valued customer.  If I'm going to spend my hard earned cash somewhere I want a smile, willingness to help if I have questions, and getting my order correct. If they do that right then they are tops in my book. The last two weeks I have gone to two establishments that not only did all these things but they remembered me by name!  When I walked into Lobby's for lunch last week I was greated warmly by Lobby himself and he remembered me!  It's been a while since I was last in and I know he sees people all day long and I'm not what I would call particularly memorable.....I mean I don't have tats or pink hair, I'm just your average woman but Lobby goes that extra mile.  He really cares about his business and it shows.  There were some gentleman just finishing off their lunches and he took the time to ask them how it was and listened to their critique of the food.  He did it graciously and asked some questions genuinely wanted to know the answers.  Lobby cares.  His place is still spotless, again, a big plus for me.  

When I crave a burger, this is what I crave.  A real beef patty with fresh ingrediants, cheese, and sometimes bacon.  This is by far my favorite burger joint.  Support your locan businesses!!  Especially the ones that go that extra mile and really care!!!

I ate here during "Restaurant Week" and am so glad I did! I enjoyed every bite of my meal and the service was fantastic. Hubby and I were seated at a roomy booth and our drinks were never empty. A basket of warm bread with butter came out quick and tasted great. The price for the RW menu was $50.14 per person and I enjoyed the following for that price before tax:

The Famous Original Spinning Bowl Salad - This is made right at your table. Our server, Ms. Huang had 2 metal bowls that spun as she added the dressing. The salad had lettuce, beets, hard boiled eggs, croutons and their signature vintage dressing. I haven't ever tasted a salad like this before. It was suggested that I add some of the Lawry's seasoning that was on the table, so I did. The salad tasted so fresh and delicious. Very good.

Mashed Potatoes - This was a nice addition to my plate. The mashed potatoes are whipped with butter and milk and tasted perfect. The brown gravy that came on it was good. 

Buttered Peas - Yum! Being on the same plate, the peas ended up with brown gravy and au jus on them which I like. Plus, I just like peas!

Yorkshire Pudding - This comes in a skillet by itself. It tasted great and was perfect for soaking up the last bits of gravy on my plate. it was soft and really good. 

Prime Rib - 8 ounces of pure heaven! A carver came to the table with a cart of prime rib and let me pick how I wanted it and then carved it right in front of me. I like mine a little more done and that's just what I got. The prime rib was so tender and literally fell apart. It had such great flavor. To say I didn't leave here stuffed would be absolutely wrong! Everything tasted good, but the prime rib was the true star.

Creme Brulee - This had fresh berries on top and It tasted so good, but I could only eat half because I was so full. 

Coffee - Tasted great and was a perfect way to end the meal. At this point I just needed a pillow for a nap!

I can't say enough about our server. She was fantastic and took great care of us. The manager on duty, Wendy came over and chit chatted with us for maybe 10 minutes and she was warm and friendly. She let us know a little about the lunch menu which sounds like a winner. This was a great RW experience and I will be back!

Prior to dining, my only familiarity with the Katsuya name was from TMZ.  If I were making half a milly per TV episode, this would be in my regular dining rotation too!  The menu's prices are on par with Nobu, Sushi Roku or Blue Ribbon.  

At least those restaurants offer some kind of a chic atmosphere.  Katsuya felt like an upscale diner with a sushi bar plunked in the middle.  The bright lighting, noise from the casino and the constant yelling of "Irashaimase!" over and over and over by employees made this a decisively unsexy spot.  I can't imagine tourists would want this kind of setting for a pricey sushi meal on the strip.  If a booth at Nobu's outpost at Caesars Palace is Kate Upton, it's kind of Rosie O'Donnell here.  Power lunches or corporate dinners? Yes.  Anniversary dinners or bachelorette parties? No!  

For those reasons, my wife and I chose to sit at the bar since the people working there looked like they were having a good time.  All them were super nice and knowledgeable of all things Katsuya. They also made some awesome cocktails to boot.  I loved the "Sahara Cooler" which consisted of Ketel One Oranje vodka, Aperol, passion-fruit pure, fresh lime juice, and Stiegl Radler Grapefruit beer.  That was instant refreshment.  One of the bartenders, whose name escapes me but I remember being a Chargers/Eagles fan, created a wonderful version of a prickly pear cocktail for my wife. 

The plan was to not order items we could get at local, off the strip Japanese spots like Kyara or Raku.  So $8 edamame (shockingly saw lots of people order this), anything from the robata grill ($12 for asparagus with no bacon) and $11 karaage were out of the question.  

Want to know what was?  Rare Wagyu filet with foie gras on top!  So tender and soooo decadent, it was like a story I never wanted to end.  The plum wine sauce reduction really added a nice balance.  Lobster and truffle chawanmushi was another dish I don't see everyday.  Despite the small portion being steamed in a Japanese tea cup, I thought it tasted great and would probably order it again.  Dig in from the bottom for maximum truffle taste.

I thought the Wagyu sashimi seared with hot oil and topped with chives and ginger was very good too.  The oil they used made it taste more like a Chinese dish which was a nice little changeup from the other beef dish.  Seared tuna with Japanese salsa was equally as good.  The high quality of the fish was easy to see as well as taste.

My wife was still hungry and had her eye on the "Wafu Carbonara" which was simply described as "slow-cooked bacon, soy reduction, and soft poached egg".  I tried to talk her out of it since she makes a great version of this dish at home.  Unsurprisingly, I lost that battle.  One of the bartenders assured us this was something worth having and she was right.  The huge chunks of pork belly with bonito flakes and sauce/egg mix just oozing over the ramen noodles was a hearty dish and a nice ending to the meal.

The Mission is a wonderful restaurant located in Old Town Scottsdale and priced accordingly.

We came here this past Friday night around 5;30 or so.  Over drinks and our meal, we keep discussing the term In-elasticity of demand.  That's economics, for how high you can raise prices before consumers will start cutting back.  

You see the food at The Mission is excellent!   It's delicious!  It's outstanding!  But, judging on how they pack them in, the investors who own The Mission, could easily raise prices by 10 or 20%, and no one would blink an eye.

Hopefully, you're not reading my Yelp Reviews for Economics lessons. But to find out about the dining experience and food.  LOL 

Since there is no Happy Hour at The Mission, we were lucky to get a table near the bar.  We ordered the "made at your table" Guacamole for $12.00.  Excellent!  If you do not believe me -- checkout the nearly half dozen photos other Yelpers have posted for this one menu item.  Yes, it's very good.  They cut up one avocado, add a pinch of salt, red onion, half a lime, cilantro, pine nuts and some grated mexican cheese. Creamy texture and yummy.

We ordered a glass of Sangria for $8.00. and a Mohito for $12.00.  Both were very good, though each had too much ice.  We also ordered off the appetizers menu the Chicken Anticuchos for $8.00, and Skirt Steak tacos for $12.00. 

The chicken comes on two skewers, with a very nice tasting mole that dominates.  It's seasoned with raisin, balsamic, sesame ,cocoa and peanuts.  Very nice.  The three small steak tacos were marinated in Tecate and smoked in their back yard. It's the smokey taste that makes the dish unique.  It also comes with green chili salsa, some diced avocado, cilantro and cotija on top.  These too were delicious and hit the spot.  

A shout-out to fellow Yelp'er Pepper T, who coined the term "Petite proteins" in her review.  Nicely said Pepper!  I believe it's nouveau cuisine.

We ordered one more drink before asking for the check.  The damage came to just over $69 including taxes, but before tip.  As I mention in the begining, The Mission gets very crowded and can feel claustrophobic.  It's also dark inside, and at times can be very noisy.

After the show at the Permorming Art Center down the street, we thought about coming back for dessert. But there was about twenty customers waiting outside to be seated.  Maybe next time.  In-elascity of Demand as they say.

OMG!  Greenberg's serves up some of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had.  If you're in Las Vegas and you love a mountain of New York style hot, freshly shaved, thin sliced meat on fresh bread of your choice you owe yourself a visit to Greenberg's Deli on the casino level of the New York, New York Hotel and Casino.

My friends are thoughtful.  On the day prior to running the half marathon I had a fairly late pasta lunch and decided to skip dinner in preparation for the morning's race.  My race morning ritual is pretty simple.  One hour before the race I eat a banana or a bagel and I drink a pint of Cytomax to prepare my body for the onslaught ahead.  Cytomax is a fluid replacement liquid that has added vitamins to fuel the body and prolong cramping.

Both of my friends were running in their first half marathon, and neither had any set routine for nutrition on the day prior to the race nor on race morning.  They visited Greenberg's on the night prior to the race, and in thinking I was starving in my hotel room they brought back for me a huge deli sandwich with a side of potato salad and a pickle with a bottle of Gatorade.  The time was 10 PM and the race was just 9 hours away.  With no refrigeration in the hotel room, and two overstuffed roommates I was left with no choice but to eat the darn sandwich and the sides.

Knowing my love for meat they brought back a Twin Bill consisting of a mountain of hot pastrami and corned beef with just a slight smear of mustard on wheat bread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=u6ig5pKlEqhgsmAvUNWrkA).  I swear the take out box weighed in at more than a pound with the thick pile of meat taking up most of that weight.  The sandwich was incredible.  The meats were nicely marbled, flavorful and moist and this was easily one of the best deli sandwiches I've had outside of New York City.  It was even better than Miller's East West Deli in San Francisco, and I love Miller's.  The big crunchy pickle was outstanding as well with just the right amount of sour to it.  The potato salad was basically big chunks of unpeeled potatoes, lots of mayo and just a touch of dill.  It took me nearly an hour to finish the sandwich, and I knew I was in trouble for the next morning.

Sure enough, the big sandwich came back to haunt me at mile 10 during the half marathon the next morning.  Luckily I run for fun, and I didn't really care that I finished 12 minutes later thanks to 2 pit stops I was forced to make.

I was so satisfied with the sandwich that I made my own visit to the deli the next night to order another.  This time I had the New York Skyhigh (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=QtjcS6CWBgSaD01Zry3urg) which is corned beef, pastrami, turkey, cole slaw and thousand island dressing on bread of choice.  I even tried their authentic chocolate New York egg cream which is simply milk, Hershey's chocolate syrup and carbonated water hand mixed and machine whirled to create a thick layer of froth on top.  Here it was without the froth (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=ekkd6tNYWjCU9Z-oXH3_4Q) as I had already sucked it up.  I loved this sandwich just as much as the Twin Bill and the drink?  Well, that was like drinking chocolate milk with fizz!

Greenberg's is very reasonably priced too as their sandwiches are mostly under $10 including the sides!

So I guess Imperial Palace is now QUAD RESORT & CASINO. But, it's the same place. Please read my review of IP before reading this review. You can find it right over here:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/imperial-palace-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas#hrid:PmcM2qPVlg96fjp2d6ut7g

And I just want to add, about 5 months ago I got into a fight with that bald headed boob(I think his name is Kevin or Carl), who is the manager of this place. He literally told me that "YELP SUCKS" and even taunted me to write a bad review. Let me explain to you why this fight occurred:

One of my friends came to town and decided to stay here because of the cheap room rates. She lived in West Hollywood most of her life, so she felt comfortable in this atmosphere. But, even West Hollywood can't compare to the f*cked up shit you find here at IP. Just to let you guys know, there was 2 assaults and what might have been a robbery or attempted robbery here on the same floor my friend was staying at. Like I mentioned in my previous review, for the last 2 years there has been a network of thieves who take advantage of the "door defect" that most of the doors here at IP have. The doors have a slight defect where they don't close 100%, and you actually have to slam the door twice to fully close it. The thieves know about this defect and due to the fact that IP has no security guards in front of the entrances to their towers, these thieves have been running this cycle for years. Read all the reviews on IPs page, many of the reviews are from yelpers who fell victim to this network of robbers. While visiting my friend, I actually saw the guys this time. They attempted to try to trick me and pretend they were just guests. They said "hello" to me while they suspiciously walked down the hallway. Both men had New Yorker accents. A few minutes later a lady runs down the hallway telling me that those guys entered her room and then ran out when they noticed she was still inside. The hotel manager is a total rat.  The guests who were almost robbed asked the guy to at least comp their stay and the manager literally tells them: "we don't comp for that. It wasn't our fault." He then tells the guests that the hotel management is aware of  the door malfunction defect and he even went out of his way to show her a small sign that read: "we are not responsible for the door not closing". What this means is that the hotel managers are all cheap motherf*ckers and won't put in the extra cash to fix the defect on the doors. When I was going back to my friends room, the moment we got out of the elevator there was a group of college kids getting the sh!t kicked out of them by more weirdos with New York accents. Now, my friend didn't want to stay here anymore. I asked that bald boob at the front desk for a room change and he practically tells me to f*ck off.  

I saw my 2nd assault of the trip at the Pet Stay area. A family was walking their dog to the pet area and some d-bag threw a glass bottle off their balcony at them. The security guard never showed up. 

Here is the most interesting part... The managers let me know that they think "Yelp is a joke". When I told them that I would write about this on Yelp, he started getting really sarcastic and said that Yelp has no effect on there business. He expressed that no matter how many 1-star ratings they get on Yelp, problem gamblers from out of state will always choose IP because they save money on lodging which means they get to have more money for gaming. 

There is probably like a 90% chance that something like this will happen to you. For example: You will go down to the poker room to play some cards. When you come back to your room, you notice your door is open. You find your daughter  tied up in the closet, badly beaten. Your wife's neck is snapped. Your oldest son has been thrown off the balcony onto Carnival Court, and no one noticed because of how loud it is. Your youngest son has been abducted and is already being sold to a Thai brothel who will force-inject him with female hormones in order to make him into a transgendered child prostitute. At that moment you will start to think to yourself: "Maybe I should have listened to that weird Tetsuro guy on Yelp, or at least listened to all the negative reviews instead of trying to save $10 a night!"  But, then you decide that you need to rescue your son and avenge your family, so you head off to Thailand and use your special forces training to fight the gangsters that took your son to find out that it was those Australian guys from "Human Nature" who were behind it all along. And all this happened cause you decided to stay at IP for the week.

Currently, I've actually decided to film a documentary style video about how dangerous, filthy, and disgusting IP is. In Feb I get 2 free nights through Total Rewards, and while I'm staying there I will document the door defects and hopefully capture one of the many assaults on video. I will upload it on my youtube channel.

Me:  "Fatburger?  Never heard of them!"
One of my friends suggested, "I hear they're pretty good."
We decided to try it.

Both my friends and I agreed.  This might be a good burger if you're drunk, but it was pretty bad while sober.  While my friends ordered their own combinations I went with the medium Fatburger deal omitting cheese and onions on my burger and choosing the fat fries over the skinny fries.

Although this place looks and operates very much like a fast food place it is not.  The burgers are cooked to order so definitely expect a wait for your food order to be called.  If you order a soft drink it's self serve.  That part I liked about Fatburger because I can control how little ice and how much soft drink actually goes into the cup.

However, back to the burger.  My number was called and a worker delivered the burger tray to me.  The first thing I noticed was how small the burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LtXy1VinKWfuLFslVarKRw?select=2v29rPxqQNAWVXQlLTyqPQ) was compared to how large the portion of steak fries were.  I love thick fries which is why I selected the Fat Fries over the skinny ones.  These were a huge disappointment even though they were nice and meaty and fried to a perfect golden yellow color.  The fault was in the oil which tasted old, and because of that the fries didn't taste fresh.  You'd be surprised how big a difference there is just by changing the oil in a fryer.

The burger was not good either.  The burger patty was so overcooked no moisture existed within the meat.  I might have been happy had there even been a glistening of grease within, but nope, chewing cardboard is probably the best comparison.  The shredded lettuce while crisp had the odd taste of being stored in a refrigeration unit badly in need of a box of baking soda.  I don't mind that they use pickle relish instead of pickle slices but even that tasted old.  It's kind of like when you go to Costco and stock up on too much of something and store it until the taste begins to waver.  The pickle relish did not have a fresh snappy taste to it.  The only ingredients which tasted fresh were the tomato slice, the bun and the mustard.

At the least the service was good and the workers are friendly.  I can honestly say I won't be back at a Fatburger restaurant anytime in the foreseeable future.

After spending the morning at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center, I typed into my cell phone "Where is a unique place to have lunch near the Phoenix Indian Medical Center?" and sent the text to KGB (542542). As we ventured into the hot sun, I recieved my answer...Sacred Hogan Navajo Frybread

*ding!* one of the few Native American resturants in the city that I HAVEN'T reviewed yet!! Let's go!! After lunch plans with one of my favorite Navajos fell through - I guess a Navajo Taco would suffice! :P 

We entered the blue and white tiled room and were met by a very tired Navajo girl who spoke of problems with the DMV throughout our meal. We sat down and took it all in, the small glass case with bottles of hot sauce, pottery and earrings for sale; the pepsi frige that held nothing but Shasta soda. Uber rez! lol and the lack of a public restroom (BOO!!)

I ordered a double Navajo burger and my mom got the Pima Taco (beans are crushed  as opposed to the Navajo tacos where the beans are whole) and two teas. We sat down and waited for our tea, which, to our annoyance, didn't come until our food did. We asked for ketchup and salsa and the hot sauce was NOT good. I have no idea what the heck that stuff was... but it wasn't cute. They would've been better off opening up a can of El Pato or Tapitio than dispensing that stuff. I think it was bad. The ketchup was good though! :P 

The food itself... was meh. Nothing great. I didn't really read the menu, or I would have noticed that the burgers come with roasted green chilis... something I'm not a fan of... but I chose to just go with it and eat it anyway. The chili brought a nice kick to things. The burger itself was just a burger, it needed something... like CHEESE! I love cheese! :P 

The bread was kind of tough... and obviously Navajo... made with the superfind Blue Bird Flour which is like GOLD in the Navajo Rez... women LITTERALLY make dresses out of their cloth Blue Bird Flour sacks! And I could tell they used powdered milk in their recipe, when the edges are significatly thick it's the milk reacting to the hot oil. When the dough is fried when fresh... it creates an awesome fluffy affect... but at Sacred Hogan, there were cracks and flakes on one side of the bread which means that the dough was left out in the elements and not kept covered and moist... which is kind of gross... the dough gets hard and when fried creates these little tiles that are hard and the rest of the dough loses moisture which makes the bread lose its flaky goodness. 

My mom wasn't thrilled with her Pima Taco... as a Pima, I guess she oughta know what its supposed to be like! She said it was okay, but the salsa made it not so good. She prefers the light crispiness of FBH, so do I. the ONE thing I like about this place is their lunch special... they will make half a taco, of your choice... for $5!! That's pretty rad! 

To my yelpers, I say skip this place. The tables were dirty and grimey and not in a good way... where its part of the ambiance, like Carolina's. The staff stared at us the entire time we ate and complained about their personal problems. The food took over 20 minutes to make and the worst food crime... they brought back the MONSTROSITY that is the Indian Dessert!!

WTF?! No one eats like this on the rez!! NO ONE!! If you want to loose some toes, eat this fucking thig! A whole frybread, topped with a scoop of ice cream, chocolate syrup and cinna-sugar! That is disgusting... i'm sorry. it's gross! These flavors cannot possible be good!! If you want a nice dessert, JUST get a plain bread with EAITHER honey OR powdered sugar!! GEEZ!

To answer Mr. K's question... The FBH uses a simpler recipe of flour, salt, baking powder & very hot water. It's hyper use of baking powder creates it crispiness... and Navajos are not as liberal with their baking powder and some use powdered milk which creates a thicker more rich frybread. Both tribes typically use crisco veggie oil or shortening to fry their bread in, but some of the old timers still prefer good ol' fashioned lard! Navajo frybread is usually smaller in diameter, where as O'odham bread is usually larger, but thinner... ummm... think of Navajos as the chicago deep dish of Frybread... and O'odham as the New York thin crust of frybread!

My new favorite place for Mexican food! When I heard there was a new Mexican restaurant serving a taco with a fried avocado on it, I knew I had to give it a try! When hubby and I walked in we were greeted by a woman who took us to a booth and took our drink order. When you walk inside there is a decent size cantina on the right and the dining area on the left. I noticed the dining area half full of customers so I took this as a good sign. The chips, salsa and bean dip brought to the table were delicious. The salsa could have been a bit more chunkier for me, but it tasted very fresh and good. 

I ordered "Tacos Del Campo" priced at just $8. This was 2 tacos with beer battered fried avocado, jicama slaw and pico de gallo in them. It was just so yummy! This wasn't like any dish I have tasted before and I will be ordering it again for sure. It also came with rice and beans. I'm pretty picky about rice at Mexican restaurants and really liked it here. The rice was moist and had great flavor as the beans. All this fresh tasty food for only $8 is a great deal. Hubby ordered the "Casero Burrito" priced at $13 and had some issues with the order accuracy of his food, but enjoyed it and really liked the tomatillo salsa that came on it. His food also came with a side of guacamole and since he is weird and doesn't like 'cados, I scooped it right up! That guac was definitely fresh made and freaking tasty! Our server was great and checked on us for refills regularly. 

Jalisco Cantina has a few different options as far as catering. They can host up to 100 people at the restaurant with live music and either a sit down dinner or buffet style dinner. They had other options too, but I can't remember them all so you can call for more info.

Currently they are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

I've never been to a spa before. I'll do a quick review of the place itself first and then explain my experience for anyone who cares.

All I have to say is that I don't really understand the concept of a spa like this lol but it was still enjoyable.

So basically the place has different rooms to relax in with varying heat levels.

It's $20 for all day admission.

It's all about relaxing and distressing your body in a clean and calm area.

There is a restaurant, a few different Sauna rooms, place to watch tv, and even a place to exercise. There is a fully stocked hygiene type area with shampoo, lotion, and hair products, for getting ready. 

Aside from those amenities you can get massages at an additional cost.

Overall it's super clean. The staff is super nice. And the place is large. 


So if you want a place to go to to just lounge around and relax for a few hours then I'd say to check this place out. 

Okay so here's how it works! I feel like saying this because I had no idea "what to do here" so hopefully this helps those first timers.

There are two floors. The bottom is gender specific and the upstairs is for both.

After you pay you are given a wrist band. This is used to open your locker and also to charge your food or drinks since you pay when you leave.

You enter through a a male or female side, put your shoes away in the shoe locker, then you are at a locker room area. There are TV's and chairs to watch TV away from the women and is where you out your stuff. 

In the men's side there are a bunch of showers. Sitting showers, standing, cold or hot. Then a big "hot tub" type pool and a cold one, and then 4 saunas. There's a dry sauna, two steam saunas, and another dry heat type sauna room. I don't dig saunas so I don't really have an opinion on these.

Oh yea! Everyone is basically nude down here so don't be bashful. I was a bit apprehensive at first but you really have to get over it to enjoy yourself.

Basically the only time you HAVE TO be fully nude is to enter the pools. It's all about hygiene so you shower nude and then get in the poop nude. This was really actually one of the more relaxing things.

Can't say much about the saunas.

Anyways upstairs!

Then upstairs you must wear the little outfit they provide which include shirt, shorts, and sandals.

There's two TV areas, a restaurant that also serves smoothies and teas, an exercise room, the private Massage rooms, a yoga area, and the "saunas. 

The restaurant seems expensive but hey if the food is good who cares. 

The rooms are all different in what material they are made out of and how hot they are. I honestly hate being hot so my favorite parts weren't related to the saunas so much.

The stand out rooms were the ice room and the red clay room.

The red clay room has these small red clay balls that you lay in and also these clear rocks that you can lay in. I preferred the balls and this was our favorite room. The balls felt very therapeutic when you lay on them or stepped on them

The idea is to just lay there and relax but the whole process of getting into a pit with tiny clay balls is really loud.

The second favorite room for me was the ice room. It's a freezing cold room. My cup of tea for the hangover I was having.

You use these sauna rooms for 3-7 minutes, drink some water, and relax for 30 minutes and try out the other rooms. I'm not sure the purpose of each room but basically whatever floats your boat then go to the room!

That's basically it. Idk if I'd go again but it was cool to experience. Maybe if there were different explanations to the rooms and their therapeutic benefits then I'd have been more into it but sitting in hot rooms isn't my thing. 

If you do it the right way there are about 5 of those dry sauna rooms so in 45 minute cycles you could easily spend a few hours here.

*Please make note that this review contains information about a salon not providing me with services that I paid for. Please proceed with caution when dealing with them*

Also, the owner wrote a note questioning the validity of my review based on negative reviews (completely ignoring the positive ones), but if you look at the review for his store, no one who gave that place a good score has more than a few reviews outside of one person. OBVIOUSLY, he's a scammer. 

Please forgive the one star above, this isn't a zero star system otherwise I gladly would have awarded this wreck of a salon one, or none as the case may be. 

First, the complaints about attitudes and inexperience are spot on. They have NO idea what they're doing at this salon.

I was a member of a different salon (note: these are franchised so they have no accountability to a corporate office which explains that extreme lack of professionalism) and came over to this one as it was closer to my house. 

I asked about specials and packages when I first came in and they explained them to me. I then chose a 12-session package for a little over $100. They told me that this gave me any choice of bed that I wanted. 

The first time I went in everything went relatively smoothly, except they charge you for the tanning canister that is required for you to be able to tan. What was I paying for then? Whatever. I tanned in a bed and then did the spray tan (a ritual I repeated each and every time I went in).

The second time I went in everything went south. They had no idea about my sessions, etc. They eventually 'figured it out' and I went on my way, repeating the steps above - two tans, etc. 

Every single time after that no one could figure out what was going on. I would stand there for 10 minutes waiting to tan while they figured my account out, AGAIN. I have no idea why this happened, and personally, it wasn't my problem. As a consumer with disposable income in this economy I have a right to not have any screw ups when I go to do something as decadent as tanning (and as simple). Forget it, that was never going to happen.

Please repeat the above for the third time.

The fourth time I went in and tanned fine, although the check-in routine stayed the same - confusion, confusion, solution. The spray tan didn't go so well and malfunctioned. Which, by the way, used to happen a lot with this machine, it seemed old. Anyway, the girl gave me a credit on my account so now I had five sessions left (this is important).

The fifth time I went in must have been a bad day for someone because the girl that helped me had a serious attitude problem. So much so that when I came out I told her that I didn't appreciate the way she treated me (that's really unusual for me - I believe in politeness at all costs and had shown it consistently with a place that could NEVER get my account right and cost me time constantly). Anyway.

For my sixth visit I called first to verify the amount of tans I had and to make an appointment to go in. Someone named Barbie answer the phone and AGAIN went into the computer and couldn't find ANYTHING for me. She said I must have used all of my tans. I said even if that was the case I'd still have one extra left from the time when the spray machine didn't work. She said 'sorry, there's nothing here.' 

Okay, all patience has almost run out. I told her that I am positive that she is the person I spoke with who said all this was fixed. She then said to me (verbatim), well I don't know if you came in when I wasn't in...' I stopped her, laughing incredulously, and said 'did you just imply that I stole something?' She then said I was rude and slammed down the phone. REALLY? REALLY? 

So, after that display of complete unprofessionalism, I call back and speak with Karenna. She tells me she somehow heard the whole conversation and that I was the rude one (right, I accused you of stealing?). She then proceeded to tell me (after Barbie, in our initial conversation admitted knowing who I was) that I had never been a member there, had never tanned there and had never paid them any money. Stop, I know. I thought I was in the Twilight Zone, too!

So, how much further could I have gone with this? It wasn't like I could get into their computer and prove anything. They get to keep my money without giving me the services I paid for, and because they are the final word, I get screwed.

Whatever you do, don't tan here. They are unethical and management will TELL you that they're franchised and if you have a complaint it will just come back to him, implying nothing will be done to them. Yikes. BAD BUSINESS.

I'm a fan of Papa Murphy's. Some people are weird about buying pizza and sides that they have to bake at home, but that's just some people being weird. There is usually some type of deal going on and they send coupons in the mail, so with any type of deal it is really worth it considering what a frozen pizza costs and tastes like. You can call your order ahead or stop in and watch them make it fresh. You can choose lighter or extra sauce, cheese and toppings to customize the pizza to your liking. The employees inside this Papa Murphy's are friendly and helpful with going over specials, but when I went on grand opening day, the people there from Sunny 106.5 were very rude and didn't help represent Papa Murphy's well. I was actually relieved to find out it was the radio station being so rude and not the actual Papa Murphy's employees because it would have detoured me from going back. I did score a free pizza (the very last one, nice!) because they were giving out 100 free pizzas to customers that day. 

They have pizzas of all shapes and sizes. They have the mini-murph pizza kit to take home so your kids can put together a pizza for themselves and then see their creation after it bakes. The pizzas also come in signature, pan, delite and stuffed crusts. Most of the pizzas bake at 425 and only take around 10 minutes aside from the stuffed pizza which takes around 25 minutes. The pan pizza is definitely good, but beware when cooking the pan pizza and keep your eye on it because there is butter or something at the bottom of that one and it can burn easy if you let it go too long and when you take the pan pizza out of the oven it's really hot, so let it stand for 5 minutes before slicing. The cheesy bread comes in regular and thicker sizes, both being equally delicious. With a coupon I usually pay about $6 or $7 for a pizza and adding 2 sides it's $6, not including the thicker cheesy bread. One thing I tried on my last visit that I hadn't before is the s'mores dessert pizza. Wow that thing was good! I preferred the s'mores pizza much more than the chocolate chip cookie dough they offer and it is a great price as one of the 2 sides you can pick. My hubby likes the cookie dough here, but I personally do not. If you are signed up for the e-club they usually send you a coupon for free cookie dough on your birthday. They also have pumpkin shaped pizzas at Halloween time and heart shaped pizzas for Valentine's Day, usually at a special price that I like to pick up. All in all this is a decent take-n-bake pizza spot.

If their Shanghai Xiao Long Bao  is the only item on their menu, I would still be dropping by this latest Chinese restaurant to open up in Las Vegas's greater Chinatown area. Now before you all go crazy and question why it is only getting 4 and not 5 stars on Yelp, let me explain.

It is good, not the best I've ever had, but I enjoyed it. In fact, after my unplanned XLB crawl of the 2 newest restaurants that serve it to open up on the west side, I can say A & K Chinese Restaurant (aka Heng Long Chinese Restaurant, if going by their name on the credit card receipt) was the clear winner of the head-to-head XLB CHALLENGE over Edamame Restaurant on Wednesday, May 7th, 2014.  

You don't have to take my word for it though. What I think is "good" could be "that is the worst, flavorless blah blah I have ever had!"  (Funny random thought: what if water is being judged right now?)

Anyway, seems like we are blessed with more and more XLB options in Las Vegas, which means to make it, the chefs all have to up their games. Translation: consumers are the winner. Yay!

I also had their Three Treasures Dumpling  (12pcs) per order and it was pretty good too. The fact they hand make these is just wonderful.

On my first visit I also tried their Pan Fried Pork Bun  (8 pcs) $7.95. If you go by yourself, this item alone will be enough to send you home with a full belly. It was just okay, the doughy bun on the outside is thinker than what I have had in Taiwan (which was THE BEST  at that busy night market), so maybe not fair comparison.

Beef Pancake Roll  $7.95. Decent. There are better ones I have had within a 2 mile radius.

Hot Purple Sweet Potato Juice , small $2.25. It was an experience to try this. It is basically purple sweet potato drink, not really sweet, but a creamy dessert alternative beverage.

Service overall was good.  I happened to have been there when they were not busy, so that might have helped too. Plus I can speak enough Mandarin Chinese to get by in restaurants, so that certainly helped.

Decor/Ambiance was pleasant. Music playing in the background was not Chinese, but instrumentals of popular American songs, which you probably wouldn't even pay attention to unless you focus on it.

Price/Value: I think it was good overall. 

Note: this is NOT your typical Chinese takeout restaurants. I must admit I am not familiar with most of their menu offerings, because I am not at all an expert on Shanghainese cuisine. But they also described their cuisine as  (New style of Jiangsu and Zhejiang - per Google Translate, which is still like Hexcodes to me). But come for their XLB, and if you are adventurous enough, you can explore their other menu items.

Expect an UYE for Xiao Long Bao  crawl and another one to just explore this restaurant's menu (yeah, I am definitely gonna need backup).

Bonus: Love that American Express is accepted along with other forms of credit card payments.  :)

I'm not a fan of Umami when I tried it a few times in L.A. years ago. My sister has never been and I can't say no to a free meal with family. You have to reserve a table (what?) or open-seating at the bar. I'd much rather stay at home and do homework than be here but since my sister already went out of her way to reserve a table, I showed up anyway.

Random thoughts: their house ketchup tastes like Filipino spaghetti; you only get 3g or protein per 100g (1 cup) of mushrooms which does not meet my protein needs therefore, I must stick with beef patty; I have low expectations of Umami Vegas thanks to Umami L.A.; Umami beer garden???; Umami buns look huge but press to deflate; they'll give you 4 different sauces: 1 spicy, 1 ranch, 1 garlic aioli that doesn't taste like garlic at all and house ketchup.

The Original:
House ketchup, parmesan frico, shiitake mushroom, roasted tomato and caramelized onion. The frico adds crispness to an otherwise boring burger. 3/5

The Royale:
Braised short rib, truffled aioli and truffle cheese. Again, not truffle-y enough. The short rib was a nice touch. 3/5

Truffle Burger:
Truffle cheese, truffled aioli and truffle glaze. Sounds like a lot of truffle but it sure didn't taste like it. It had a hint of truffle and that's it. 3/5

Truffle Fries:
I've had way better truffle fries elsewhere. The fries were soggy and lacked truffle flavor.  Get the smushed potatoes instead. 1/5

Sweet Potato Fries:
Sprinkled with sweet salt. This goes well with the spicy dipping sauce and the house ketchup. 3.5/5

Mies Vanilla Rohe:
Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream in between chocolate chip cookies. The cookie itself wasn't that great. The ice cream was ordinary. Hello, cavities! 2.5/5

At least in L.A. I've gotten better service, food was a bit quicker and my drink glass was never empty. Umami is a casual dining place but calling it a sports bar/beer garden and having that atmosphere is just blah. Flat screens everywhere with different football games on and Criminal Minds = headache! There are other better burger places in Vegas.

George & Son's has one of the best Buffets in the Valley!

A group of us came here for the Lunch Buffet last Thursday.  Our merry Yelp'ers included our ring leader Rand H, along with Robyn N, Mike C, Norm R and Arlin B.  For some reason, I thought the place opened at 11 am (it's 11;30) and arrived early.  On the plus side, it afforded me the opportunity of watching as they setup.  It was impressive.

One of the weaknesses of the buffet concept is the inability of keeping food hot and fresh.  Chinese food, particularly Schezuan which has thicker sauces lends itself well to this steam-warming method.  

WHAT MAKES GEORGE & SON'S SPECIAL? It is their method of preparing and putting out a only small amount of food at one time.  Though they have a setup for eight dishes, which is always in use. They are constantly rotating the food items, as the Cook prepares more.   Look at the photos and you'll see the smaller, more manageable size.  Given the nearly dozen or so dinners, in addition to our group, nothing was left for very long anyway.

I started with the tossed salad, with a light ranch dressing.  Next, I tried the Tofu Vegetable Soup(photo) which was outstanding and delicious.  The flavor was subtle and I left wanting to order some for later.  

Next to the buffet, they had some deep fried onion rings, mushroom, and other veggies in a beer, rather than tempura batter. It too had a nice flavor.

As for the entrees, I found the Sauteed Shrimp and Onions(photo), and the Honey Chicken(photo) that stuck to the top of my mouth the best. As you took the Honey Chicken, you could see the silk thread like strands of honey attached to the serving tongs.  You cannot get anything fresher than that!  But, everything they made was very good.

The bill came to $9.75 before tip, but including taxes.  As I mentioned in my Yelp Tip, if you come here and check-in, you will get 15% off your next meal.  A nice incentive.  

The restaurant came close to Five Stars.  But in the end, I felt the Four Star, "Yay! I'm a fan" was more on the mark.  Keep in mind, the Lunch Buffet starts at 11:30, Monday through Friday!

Enjoy!

This is really a 4.5 star review. I love Jersey Mike's! When I walked in there were plenty of smiling faces and friendly employees. The taste of the food is important obviously, but customer service goes a long way and this location delivers when it comes to both of those things.

When looking at the menu board I was having the hardest time deciding what to order. So many of the subs were something that I would eat. The cool thing about that is, there will be something new I can try out when I go back, so I could end up with a few favorites to rotate between. They offer a "Sub in a Tub" for those of you who do not like your meat between bread. You can just pick any sandwich on the menu and they will make it the same way they would on a sandwich, but put it in a bowl minus bread for you. They have a variety of "Wraps" to choose from. The sandwich sizes are mini (4 1/2 inches), regular (7 1/2 inches), and giant (15 inches) and the bread options are wheat or white. The bread is baked fresh at each location. 

One of the workers suggested "The Original Italian" since it was their most popular sub. It sounded delicious so hubby and I decided to split one of those. The giant for this sandwich was priced at $11.95 and then it jumped to $13.95 before tax with the addition of extra cheese. It had provolone, ham, prosciuttini, cappacuolo, salami and pepperoni. Jersey Mike's uses quality meats and slices it fresh right in front of you. I ordered it "Mike's Way" which means they add onions, lettuce, tomatoes, vinegar, oil and spices. The sandwich was very good! I will order this one in the future for sure. The flavors all melded so well together.

I was very impressed with the knowledge of the employees. The sandwiches on the menu that are numbers 43 and 56 have meaning. The number 43 is the football jersey of the CEO. Apparently he started working for Jersey Mike's (the original on the jersey shore) when he was a teen and ended up buying it later on and shaping it into what it is today. The number 56 is a nod to the year the first Jersey Mike's opened up.

They offer a "Shore Points" reward program. You can sign up and use a card or just give your phone number when ordering to accumulate points towards free sandwiches. 

Parking can be very frustrating at this location. It is tight in this area so please just be careful.

You can also place your order online or by phone.

Catering is available and they have a few different options for that.

Sign up for the e-club to get discounts.

Be hungry and ENJOY!

Bonjour Mes Amis 

Dit mon la verite'! 5 stars?!? 
Ca c'est bon 

Lafitte's seems to be one of the nicest restaurants in the area, and still quite affordable, considering what you get for your money. 
(and this from a bonifide cheapskate) 

It was also nearly empty for Sunday dinner, but I'm sure that is something that varies greatly seasonally. Lafitte's is hidden inside of the Embassy Fountain Suites Hotel s.e. corner of I-17 and Greenway Rd, and is a little cajun/creole restaurant that really is a Lagniappe! 

The menu was quite large and much more varied than I thought it would be. (not all seafood) 
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served. 
Gumbo, Jambalaya, soup, Po'Boy and a bunch of other sandwiches, salads, pizza, entrees from pasta and veggies to fillet, ribs, prime rib, and more scrimps than you, Capt. Dan (and Bubba, en spirit) could ever get from a night out on the Jenny in the bayou. 

The baby back ribs had both a dry rub and a sauce glazed on while grilling ~sweet, spicy (could've been a tad hotter), tender and meaty and moist. 

The prime rib came in a slab worthy of Fred Flintstones dinner plate. The large portion was seriously somewhere between two and three inches thick, and the portion and it's demi-glace filled HALF of the plate, shoving the colorful mixed veggies to one side, and the side order of chicken and sausage jambalaya -- luckily in it's own little cup -- was moved onto the table to accommodate meat-slab-slicing-room. 
The beef was cooked perfectly to order (MR for me, R for pop), tender, flavorful with or without the sauce, and just the right amount of fattiness. 
Let us return to that jambalaya. WHEW BOYEE, it was a delicious dark gravy stew over rice that easily could be a satisfying meal on its own! C'est magnifique, I gau-RUN-tee! 

There were two different scrimps dishes at the table as well, which both must have been really good, because neither the saucy one or the pasta-ey one got shared with anyone! 

There is a tasty although probably over-hyped ice cream dish on the desert menu that seems like some sort of cake but is really just a big slab of Neapolitan ice cream with a tiny bit of meringue on the outside. 

Service was superb! Our server was lively, attentive, funny, and really nice. She was knowledgeable about the dishes, offered recommendations when asked (even a bit of a Miracle on 34th Street-ish: "I'd get one of the other sides, not because the sweet potato fries are bad, they're just average, and so many of the other sides you'd be missing are so good"), and was also familiar with the details (and made sure we were, too) of the restaurant.com coupon. 

The restaurant.com coupon was what really made this a smokin' deal, and I heard from a coworker that they have a BOGO in the Entertainment book ,too. Even without the deals, the menu is really not very expensive considering the quality and portion size that you get at Lafitte's. 4 out of 5 dinner entrees were all $16, with many choices on either side of that average. Lunch sammies complete with side of fries or ? are around $8-9. The ice cream conglomeration fed all 5 of us for $8. Not bad 'tall, mon cheri. 

Laisser les bons temps rouler !

TWO STARS is all you get. Reason being I am glad this location was not taken over by a pawn shop, happy ending spa or a needle exchange and also because the food is decent. I repeat. The food is decent. 

My big beef with this restaurant is the service. When I say service I mean the Management. 

I have been to Sammy's on three separate occasions. First time with a fellow Yelper for brunch and I had the breakfast tacos which were good. Not great, but good. Service was on point.

Second visit was at lunch time on a Sunday with my mother. It took our waitress 25 minutes to get us our drinks. I realize how long it takes to get water and how difficult it is. What was even more annoying than our waitress was the fact that they let the patrons who were sitting at the nice bar in the center of the restaurant scream at the TV during the football game. They were tossing back $10 bottomless Mimosas and obnoxiously reacting to every play and startling all of the dining customers who most of them appeared to have just come from church. Not cool especially because this restaurant has a side sports bar where they should have been directed to. Not cool especially because the Managers did nothing at all about it. The Managers stood by the bar and watched the game the entire time, too! Not my idea for a relaxing Sunday brunch. If I wanted this ruckus I would have gone to the sports book!

Third visit I really disliked a pasta dish I was sharing. Took one bite and no more. I mentioned it to the waitress and was still charged for it. Way to keep it classy, Sammy's. 

NOT ONCE IN ANY OF MY VISITS DID THE MANAGERS TOUCH ANY TABLES TO SEE IF THE GUESTS WERE HAPPY WITH THEIR FOOD AND SERVICE.

Lastly, I did not want to write this review.It's my favorite time of year when I pretty much love everyone and everything.  I shared my frustration with their website directly. But, when 2 MONTHS later I did not receive anything more than a generated email response from the Sammy's website I knew I had to let the Yelp family know. I will not be playing it again, Sam I am.

"That's all you need to know, right there, " she said, pointing up behind her head at a framed plackard from local news affiliate CBS 5 Dean's List.  
It was dated from like 1996, or 2003, or something like that, I can't remember, but it wasn't very recent.
"What's that got to do with Customer Service?" I asked, completely perplexed.  
I was just trying to tell her that I've had the same thing happen here twice now in two visits, where she is attending to personal business instead of her customer, ie me.  
"Go on. (waving towards the door)  We been here 17 years.  We don't need YOU."
"You haven't even listened to me.  I'm going to have to tell somebody about this."
"I don't care.  I dont need to listen.  I'M the owner. Go." (she starts pacing back and forth behind the counter, like a caged animal or a person about to get in a fight)
"You're the ONLY owner?  So you're saying your PARENTS work for YOU?  Here, and down the street at BurgerMania?"
"I'm the owner.   I don't care."

A customer standing next to me, who's already received her order but has been waiting the entire time, come to find out, for Mrs. Rude to scoop her an ice cream cone, chimes in with, "I don't think she WANTS to listen to you."

You think?!    


Moments earlier, I'd stood at the counter ready to order, while she was digging red plastic baskets out of one of the trash containers in the lobby.  She saw me, and proceeded to continue what she was doing without acknowledging me, for a few more moments.

Then she comes around the counter  -- no hand washing -- and proceeds to take my order.  
$7.03 ... hand her my card, she swipes it but doesn't press any buttons on the card machine or the cash register.  
~
On her phone laying on the counter, she continues the texting she originally started while taking my order.
~
It's taking forever, and she keeps going back and forth between the credit card reading machine and her phone laying on the counter.
     -a few buttons pressed over here, -a few buttons pressed over there
Finally, I say "Forget it, this is the second time you've done something like this to me recently, and it's not acceptable to me.  I'm taking my business elsewhere."  
"I WAS WAITING FOR THE MACHINE! "  she lamely attempts to defend.
"You were on the phone instead of doing what you should have been doing."
"Go ahead.  I don't care.  That's all you need to know right there."

.......and now you're up to date, back at the top of the review.

WAIT!  I forgot to tell you about what happened last time:

I go for a late lunch, and I'm after a Falafel sandwich, easy enough.
Into a near empty dining room walks your humble narrator, and there's no one waiting in line at all, since it's 1 ish already.  
A single patron is waiting at the counter for his food, engaged in personal conversation with our villain, Mrs Rude.

As I stand patiently behind Chatty Customer Man, Mrs Rude makes no effort to wrap it up or otherwise acknowledge me as a waiting customer, despite having already made indisputable eye contact.  

"Shit, Did they just change subjects?!?" I'm thinking to myself, as I make the Universal Signal for depicting the perfect combination of Hunger and Readiness at a food ordering counter -- I caused my keys to jingle in my hands.  

I literally stood at an empty counter while they chatted for a full minute and a half before I decided to turn and begin walking away.
I didn't rush, since there were a few Mother-May-I-Giant-Steps between me and the exit, and I would have gladly turned back if called upon.

But she let me go, and now I know why.

Mr Gyro doesn't need my business.
Mr Gyro doesn't need your business.

And if Mrs Rude does, in fact, speak on behalf of the entire ownership of Mr Gyro, well, then I guess 

Mr Gyro doesn't even WANT our business.   So be it.

***Picasso's food is not incredibly creative, but it is very nicely prepared (and the flavors are good)***

Picasso features a prominent chef (Julian Serrano) and many Picasso paintings throughout the dining room.  The paintings are not the only nice touch; there is an outdoor dining area that sits right on Lake Bellagio (large windows also give indoor dining guests a view of Lake Bellagio and the fountain shows).

The dining room was bigger than I expected.  It was not stuffy, but I did not like all of the design choices.  Seating was comfortable and I liked the color of the walls as well as the nice ceiling.  I was not a fan of the carpet (or the chair backings).  I think they were trying to embrace the Picasso theme, but it made the dcor feel out-of-date.

Picasso is a French restaurant and there is a tasting menu and a pre fixe menu (not much difference in price; tasting menu provided one additional course).

I opted for the tasting menu, which started with an amuse bouche of warm potato soup topped with crunchy almonds.  There was also a pheasant croquette garnished with prosciutto.  The soup was good.  I liked the croquette, but you do not get much of a pheasant flavor.

There were several complimentary bread options.  The raisin and walnut bread stood out the most.   There was a great mix of crunchy nuts and sweet dried fruit.  The very hearty bread also had a great crust and chew.

My first course was Maine lobster with micro greens, cherry tomato, avocado, celery, melon, and an apple-champagne vinaigrette.  The salad was fresh, light and refreshing.  I liked the lobster, which was lightly sweet, moist and tender.  While I liked the lobster, it did not have the softness of the lobster in the lobster salad at Vincenti (Brentwood).

My second course was a pan seared scallop that sat on potato mousseline.  There was also a port wine reduction.  The scallop was very good.  It had a great caramelized crust.  The scallop was also fresh, moist and soft.  I also liked the potato mousseline, which was buttery and creamy.

The dish as a whole though was a little underseasoned.  The port wine sauce did not add much and there needed to be more bold flavors on the plate.

My third course was the sauted foie gras, which was topped with almonds (the foie gras sat on brioche).  There was also a blood orange sauce as well as rhubarb and rhubarb puree.  This was a very good dish.  There was a great mix of flavors (sweet, salty, tart) and textures (crispy, creamy, crunchy).

I really enjoyed the foie gras.  It had a great outside sear while the inside was velvety, smooth and buttery.  The almonds were great.  The toasted brioche was a little too toasted (almost crouton like).  I really liked the rhubarb and rhubarb puree.  It was a great mix of sweet and tart and it went well with the savory foie gras.

My main course was the roasted loin of Colorado lamb, which was served with mint aioli, tempura zucchini, tomato, and ratatouille.  The lamb loin was very good.  It had a great outside color and flavor.  The meat was tender and juicy (great flavor).  There was a nice amount of fat marbling, but it was not too much.

The sides were pleasant and well prepared but simple and straightforward.  I liked the flavor of the ratatouille as well as the light crispiness of the tempura zucchini flower.

My dessert course was caramel roasted pear with warm hazelnut frangipane cake,  ice cream and crushed hazelnuts.  I really liked the caramel roasted pear.  It had a good flavor (the caramel was sweet but not heavy).  The pear also had a great texture--tender but not mushy.

The ice cream was creamy and smooth and had a good flavor (though I was expecting a more distinct flavor).  The frangipane was decent (kind of simple but thankfully not too dry).

The meal ended with petit fours.  The petit fours were pleasant--not as innovative or ambitious as the very good petit fours I've had at places like Cyrus (Healdsburg) or Providence (Los Angeles).

Service was very good--personable, pleasant, polished, professional, and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace.

Prices were high, but their tasting menu is less expensive than what you will find at some Vegas restaurants.  In terms of similarly priced Vegas restaurants, I thought the food at Picasso was better than Le Cirque, Michael Mina and Aureole.

Picasso is a pleasant and satisfying Vegas fine dining restaurant.  I do not think Picasso would compete well with top Bay Area restaurants because the food is not as ambitious or creative.  Still, the food is good and very nicely prepared, which makes it a good option for a special occasion meal in Vegas.

The Bellagio has its own free parking structure (self-parking).

If it weren't for the ice-cold A/C, this place would definitely get 5 stars!
I just got home from dinner with my brother-in-law, who's in town for a conference.  He said "pick a nice place" and, of course, I chose Durant's!
Valet parking.  Cute as a button, and I gave him the "I wanna put you in my pocket" line.  
See, my sister and her family live in the OC.  Not much for flavor there.  When we walked in through the kitchen, the first thing the bro-in-law said was "Awesome!  Just like old Queens mobsters, walking in through the kitchen!"
We were early for our reservation, but it didn't look like we needed it for a Monday night (come on, it's football season!) so we were promptly seated.
Decor reminds me of my Hungarian/Polish grandparent's house.  Red velvet wallpaper and dark red leather booths.  Really plush and the booths could sit 4 comfortably.  There were some hotties in there, so I made sure to sit across from the bro-in-law!  
One of the thing you KNOW means class is them giving out BLACK linen napkins if you're wearing black.  Nothing ruins a good night out more than white lint on your lap.
The bread came and it was doused in an olive oil-basil-onion concoction.  I only had a little piece, but it was awesome!  It was already pre-cut, too.  Convenient!
The BIL (keep up, that's brother-in-law and I'm gonna type it a bunch of times and that's just ridiculous) had to order the fried calamari, his staple.  Breading was light, but a bit too salty.
The soup special was an onion-cheese and really rich and creamy.  I had the 8oz filet with a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  BIL got the scallops, which had pieces of bacon around the edges.  Both dishes were perfect.  My steak was done just right - medium rare.  
We shared dessert.  Strawberry shortcake.  For 2.  We couldn't even finish it.  Topped with homemade whipped cream.
The best touch, though, was the ambience.  Oh, and members of "the Family" at the table right next to us.  Ah, to hear that Queens accent again!  
Definitely my top high-end restaurant in the Valley now!  I'll be back!  Not with the BIL, though.  I'll bring one of my boys.

I've had my eye on Cafe Berlin for a hot minute. Always telling myself I was going to go but I wanted to give it some time. This location has changed hands and restaurants many, many times and if Cafe Berlin was not going to last - well, I didn't want to waste my time. But a year and half later, it's still here so it was time to try the place.

Let me start with my only complaint of this place - WHY THE HECK DID I WAIT SO LONG TO COME HERE!?

My memories of Germany consist of a few different things: Good Times, Good Food, Good Wine and Good Beer. Living in Germany I have the luxury of having excellent German food. Those imbiss stands though. Delicious Brats, Pomme Frites with mayo, schnitzel that would rock your socks off. After leaving Germany, I just knew that I would never have German food that good again.

Well my friends, Cafe Berlin has the most amazing Jaeger Schnitzel. It is perfectly fried with the a very nice, light & crunchy breading. It is topped with the most delicious cream sauce with mushrooms. The size of the jaeger schnitzel was slighter smaller than something you would find in Germany but in the end it was the perfect serving and I was satisfied. The spaetzle was seasoned very well and soft and pillowy. 

I also ordered a side salad with German dressing. Amazing. The salad itself was nothing special but the dressing was made perfectly. Not too oily, not too much sugar, not too much vinegar. I asked for it on the side so I could dress my salad myself and I think this is key. 

Last but not least, if in a German restaurant you have to have a pretzel. There is just something about a German pretzel that I love. I remember walking to the bus stop in the morning when I lived in Germany and always stopping by the bakeries to get me a warm pretzel bun. The pretzel here reminded me so much of that. It was hot, warm and soft. Served with a cheese spread. The pretzel came out so soft and warm that I couldn't wait to eat it and alas, no picture. 

I left Cafe Berlin with a very happy belly. I remember just being happy overall after eating there. I wanted to give this place 5 stars, but I will have to visit a couple more times before I can do that. But if you want a great schnitzel, do your belly a favor and get over here today.

After seeing so many of my friends check in to this place and proceeded to give it no less than 4 stars, I knew it had to be good. Just the pictures alone made my gut instinct (also known as my stomach growling and my mouth drooling) tell me it was gonna be good!

So I take my wife here to dinner on a late Friday afternoon around 5. We are greeted warmly and are seated immediately. Nice place. Very spacious. They even have a little stage for bands to perform I assume. Before we even see our server, there was already another guy putting down a basket of chips, salsa, and bean dip on our table. Talk about calming down a hungry customer! What an awesome feeling it is to chow down on some delicious chips and salsa while trying to decide what wonderful menu item(s) to order. Besides the chips and salsa, they also give you a cup of fideo soup before your entre comes out. 

So we go with Juan's Flaming Combo for 2. It's your choice of two meats (Chicken, Steak, or Pork. Shrimp is a dollar extra), grilled with onions, green and red peppers on a sizzling fajita skillet. We chose Steak and Shrimp. When they bring it out, not only is it sizzling, but they throw some alcohol on top of it (some kind of tequila I think) and ignite it with a lighter. Which at this point makes you understand why they call this place "Juan's Flaming Fajitas and Cantina". This dish comes with your choice of rice, beans, and pico de gallo or sour cream, guacamole, and sauted veggies. I went with the first choice while my wife went for the second so we can try all options. Turns out all items are very good. Of course to round it out you get either flour or corn tortillas because what is a fajita without the tortilla? It's like having a gun with no bullets or brushing your teeth with no toothpaste. It just wont work without it. 

As for the service, we didn't have to ask for anything. One thing that really stood out was that even though our server was doing an excellent job already, another server from another area saw me finish my water and as I was putting the empty glass at the edge of the table, she proceeded to fill it with fresh water. Wow! I like the fact that other servers are not just looking after their own area, but are more than willing to help out their fellow servers when it comes to simple things like refilling water glasses. Bravo to whoever does the customer service training at this place. Keep up the good work for im sure every customer will notice these things.

So any time I see or hear of anything fajita, I will automatically think of Juan's Flaming Fajitas! Im looking forward to bringing my friends and family here! Ole!

Skinnyfats is a terrific mix of healthy and semi-unhealthy (happy) and really caters to almost everyone.  There are a ton of healthy options and that showed with the majority of the fitness clientele who were there during my late 2:30pm lunch.  I thought it would be pretty slow around this time but it was packed.

I got the "Cranburkey" (special recipe turkey burger dressed with arugula, tomato, red onion and a cranberry basil yogurt spread on a 9 grain bun) which was very good.  The highlight was definitely the cranberry basil yogurt spread and this set it apart from the hundreds of turkey burgers I've eaten.  The patty had good flavor and I wouldn't hesitate to order this again.  

I had a choice of truffle fries, sweet potato fries (no more parsnip) or a salad.  To keep it healthy, I should have gone with the salad but I am glad I didn't because they have the GREATEST sweet potato fries I have ever had.  I am sure they were made in house.  The little crystals of sugar on them really took it to another level.  No condiments were necessary with those.  I can't believe I took that many sentences to talk about sweet potato fries but they were really awesome!

My skinny wife that never gains any weight ordered from the "happy side" of the menu.  She ordered the "Chix on Broadway".  Is it a wonder this tasted better than the Cranburkey????  Maybe because it was fried chicken with bacon, cheddar, lemon mayo on a brioche roll but that's just a hunch.  The batter and the fry of the chicken was atypical.  The breading itself was thin so it wasn't your traditional fry but it was still very good.   

I got a large "Mr Green" drink which was a mix of spinach, parsley, kale, romaine lettuce, celery, cucumber, cilantro, apple.  This was probably the first and last green drink I will have with cilantro.  I'll order this again without it as that was the most prevalent flavor next to apple juice.  I do love the majority of green drinks in the world though.  There were 2 options for complimentary water.  One was strawberry basil and the other was raspberry lemon and both were very refreshing.

The space is inviting and set up nicely.  The designer definitely maximized the area.  It just goes to show that if a business offers an excellent product, people will come from anywhere to have it even if they're located in an industrial park on Dean Martin next to a strip club.

My first Arepas and is was Viva Las Vegas good!

I had to try this place after reading Craig R's review.  I've never had an Arepas before so I was looking forward to trying it.  This place is a stand alone shack on the corner at the end of the north side of the strip.  Seriously its a shack, you cant miss it cuz it sticks out!!!  They have some tables set outside so there are places to for you to eat there.  Saw a few that just swung by and got it to go.   

An Arepa is a flat, round and soft patty made out of cornmeal, which is grilled, making it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and then it can be stuffed with beef, chicken, ham, cheese, beans, shrimp, and many more. These delights are gluten-free, and wheat-free.  Aside from arepas (hot/cold) they also serve empanadas and hallacas which are like tamales.

SInce I was having a really late dinner I decided to try 2 and got a #5 and #7 with a mango drink to wash is down.  I sat down and waited about 10 min and the guy brought it out. 

#5 Roasted Pork Butt  (Pernil) which is Slow Cooked Marinated Pork, Fresh Tomato Slices and cheese.  Damn this was tasty good.  Great flavored pork, tender and juicy.  The cornmeal was grilled perfectly with a crisp!

#7 Reina Pepiada which is Shredded Chicken Breast, Avocado,  Mayonnaise, Cilantro, Green Peas.  Was like a chicken salad as this was a cold version.  They look small but they are actually pretty big and was only able to eat half of this one as I was totally full. 

The guy told me about the 2 homemade sauces they have on the table.  One is green and a milder version but with a really good flavor.  I would buy some of this good stuff.  The red was obviously spicy and so I didn't really use it but it was good.  

This place may look questionable but let me tell you this is a great hole in the wall place to hit up when your in LV.  It's way off the strip so you wont have to deal with lines and strip prices.  They have great tasty food 

Eyes ~ Ok its on the corner and the seats are pretty much on the sidewalk.
Nose ~ Not much to smell when your outside and the wind whipping!
Ear ~ Cars cars cars!
Mouth ~ Damn tasty arepas!
Tummy ~ Stop stuffing more food mouth, I'm freaking full yo!

That bread, though. Every time I think back to my exceptional meal at Streetcar Po-Boys, all I can think about is their amazing bread. Perfectly crusty and doughy, I would come back for that bread alone. Luckily, Streetcar has a lot more to offer than just mind-blowing bread. 

After hearing the recent rave reviews for this very new restaurant, I could not wait to give them a try. The decision to drive so far out of my way for lunch was made even easier with Yelp Deal they are currently offering.

The moment we walked in we were greeted warmly by every server in the place. I was already impressed. The restaurant is larger than expected and very cute. Lots of booths with plenty plenty New Orleans flavor gracing the walls and sound system. Service was extremely attentive and friendly.

My mom and I decided to each get a sandwich and share an order of corn fritters. I went with The Bourbon Street and my mom ordered the Da Saints. Our food took a little while coming out since there was a very large takeout order being prepared, but our waitress kept us in the loop so we happily chatted and took in the ambiance while waiting.

The food finally came out and I was floored. We had both ordered the regular size po-boys and we were sure glad we did. These sandwiches were enormous and smelled so good. We dug right in and all the flavors were just perfect. Perfectly crunchy bread that complemented the very juicy and messy nature of my sandwich. I'm usually not a fan of food that is that messy to eat with my hands, but it was so tasty I didn't mind. The corn fritters were delectable as well. My mom's favorite were the homemade chips, perfectly cooked and seasoned. 

Refills were plentiful and we each enjoyed our meals quite a bit. Try as we might, my mom and I both had an entire half of a sandwich to take home with us for later. I had been looking forward to trying some of their desserts, but we were just too stuffed. Next time my plan of action will be to share a sandwich, since portions are so generous.

I will be back, and soon!

***Carnevino is expensive, but the meat choices (like the New York Strip and veals chops) as well as the grill octopus and lobster ravioli are very good***

While I am not a big fan of Las Vegas restaurants, Mario Batali's Carnevino definitely excels at putting out great meat dishes.  We had several of their meat offerings including the bone-in New York Strip and the veal chop and both were very good.

The bone-in New York Strip was a thick cut and it had a great crispy outside sear, which was flavorful.  The meat was very tender.  It was undercooked at rare, but it still had a good flavor (and was of course moist).

The veal chop was better.  It was also very thick, but it was cooked more appropriately.  Veal chops should be between medium rare and medium and this one was.  The meat was moist and tender while the outside crust was distinct and flavorful.  Veal can often be a tad bland, but this one had a good flavor.  This was probably the best veal chop I have ever had.

The lamb chops were just okay.  Unlike the other meats, the lamb chops were not that thick.  They were a tad overcooked and while they did have a decent flavor and were tender, they were just not as juicy as they should have been.  Also, the outside crust was not as good as the veal or the New York Strip.

We had two other dishes that were also very good.  One was their grilled octopus.  I've heard Batali's grilled octopus at Osteria Mozza is very good.  This one was exceptional.  The octopus was very soft (which can be difficult with octopus) and it had a great flavor.  There were some good pickled vegetables on the side and maybe something else like prosciutto to give it a nice savory flavor.

I have not enjoyed many of Batali's pastas, but I did like his lobster anolini.  The lobster filled ravioli was very good--moist with a great lobster flavor.  The cream sauce was mixed with tarragon and it was flavorful and fragrant without being overly buttery or rich.

Most of the other items were in the just okay range.  The arugula salad featured a triple cream, but the triple cream was surprisingly dry and a little hard.  The bruschetta was okay (as was the big eye tuna crudo).

We had the pappardelle with porcini mushrooms and while the pasta sheets were good, the pasta went cold quickly.  It was also a little bland.  I was expecting the braised pork agnolotti to have a more impactful filling, but it was not as moist or savory as I was hoping for.  The garnish of chanterelles was good though.  There was a little bit of butternut squash on the plate, but it did not provide the sweet flavor I was expecting.

Most of the sides were just okay (like the spinach and the roasted beets), but the mashed potatoes with mascarpone and a poached egg were rich, creamy and quite good.

I had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and it was okay.  I am not the biggest fan of flourless chocolate cake because it can be too dry.  While it was a little bit dry, it had a good (but maybe not great) chocolate flavor.

Service was good.  The staff was attentive and the food came out at a good pace.

Prices were high (which is common in Las Vegas), but when you share several of their dishes (family style), you might be able to save a little bit of money.

Carnevino has very high ceilings and a loud atmosphere.  The place has the look of other expensive steakhouses--kind of masculine looking with lots of dark browns.

The meat at Carnevino is very good and it is up there with some of the best a la carte steakhouses I've tried.  I am not the biggest fan of these steakhouses, but Carnevino is one of the better ones and they even have a few other good things (like the lobster ravioli) to balance out the meal.

Carnevino is located in The Palazzo, which has free parking (valet or self).

I've never written about him before, I have a gay father. Well, technically he's not my real father but a man who I met some years ago. Coming out for me was pretty tough, married, house in the suburbs and a wife who I loved deeply. After coming out to her, my family and friends, my therapist suggested I quickly join an online support group for married gay men, and that's where I met Larry Johnson. A kind older man, Larry immediately took me under his wing; living in San Francisco it was easy for him to show me more about our mutual passion, food.  

Over the years we've exchanged thousands of emails and I've visited him in SF as often as I could, Larry taught me a great deal about fine dining. Including how to have food adventures and about getting the most out of life's pleasures. While my mom will always be my first food hero, Larry will always be my gay dad and has helped to make me who I am today. 

So when he comes into town for a visit I'm always a little stressed out about where to take him for dinner. This visit was easy, I decided to choose something basic and straight forward like steak. Opened 60 years ago, Durant's is not only a Phoenix institution but is also a great steakhouse. While the trend of new steakhouses in the Valley has finally started to taper off, Durant's classic approach is commendable and endearing. I'm talking about fantastically tender steak, understandable sides and professional service. 

Steakhouses in general are probably some of the most expensive restaurants in town. So I was ready to spend a mint on dinner but did notice one thing at Durant's, the steaks aren't ala carte. This means when you order a steak you're not only getting soup or salad but you're also getting your choice of accompaniment, what a value.

Entering Durant's from the rear will take you right through the kitchen, dont worry about this, its all part of the charm. You'll see that the kitchen is spotless and most of the cooks turn around and give you a warm smile and a happy hello. Once you get into the dining room its all old school. Black leather booths, crushed red velour wallpaper and dim lighting all set the mood for a relaxed and subdued dinner experience. 

Ordering the 16 oz Ribeye Steak ($39.50) was an easy choice for most steak lovers. The ribeye for has the perfect amount of marbling to meat ratio, this means that the meat will be really flavorful without being too fatty. I have to tell you, the ribeye at Durant's was one of the best steaks I've had in years. This thick juicy steak was everything that a steak should be, slightly salty with a distinct smoky char and perfectly tender. I also upgraded my side to the Stuffed Baked Potato ($4.95), think twice baked potato. 

Larry's 8oz New York Strip ($29.50) and loaded baked potato were delivered. Not only was the steak perfectly seasoned, it was expertly cooked at medium-rare as requested. 

A silence fell over the table as we enjoyed our meals together. Durant's not only impressed me and me made look good, but they made me proud of our restaurant heritage here in Phoenix. Durant's, thank you.

I've never had a more amazing experience at a Michelin-star restaurant than here...well, maybe Joel Robuchon's other restaurant next door will beat my L'Atelier experience but I'm not going there until next month so I'm letting this sink in 'til then. I was supposed to take myself on a solo birthday dinner date back in August but they were completely booked.  When I remembered to make a reservation it was already weeks after my birthday and the soonest availability was end of September so I went ahead and got my spot...for my sister and I. Now, it all makes sense and I'm thankful the dining gods were with us tonight, we got to meet Joel Robuchon. I'm not a huge fan of celebrities or models and what not...I'm a fangirl of athletes and celebrity chefs! Meeting Joel Robuchon at L'Atelier was a 4/365 chance. Enough of my fangirl babbling.

We sat at the bar area to watch food being prepared - it was such a delight. Our server was Eddie and he has been working here since the day they opened. He took extremely good care of us. Best service I've had anywhere else. All requests granted. He made great recommendations and answered any questions we had about the menu. The manager chatted with us too. Extremely attentive. The sommelier let us try some wines before narrowing it down to what we really want. I got a Riesling and my sister got a Malbec...on top of the Veuve Clicquot we were already drinking.

Aside from the a la carte menu, they have 4 other menus: Menu A ($78: amuse-bouche, 2 appetizers, 1 entree and 1 dessert), Menu B ($105: amuse-bouche, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 1 dessert), Pre-Theatre served from 5-6:30pm ($45: amuse-bouche, 1 appetizer and roast of the day) and Seasonal Discovery (11-courses for under $200).

Amuse-Bouche:
Foie gras parfait with port wine reduction and parmesan emulsion. The port wine compliments the richness of the creamy foie gras and the parmesan emulsion adds lightness and saltiness. The Californians sitting next to us were jealous that we can eat foie gras in Nevada and that we have Joel Robuchon in Vegas - they should be. 5/5

Le Saumon:
Salmon carpaccio with fennel-mango salad and lemon essence. The mango they use are not the ripe ones so it's crisp and a bit tart (I love unripe/green mangoes). The salmon is fresh and works well with fennel. 5/5

Le Crabe Royal:
King crab with turnips and sweet and sour sauce. Thinly sliced turnip under and on top of the crab meat. Excellent flavors. 5/5

Les Calamars:
Sauteed calamari and vegetable medley in crustaceous vinaigrette. Lightly cooked calamari. There's olive oil with olive puree on the side of the plate. I'm allergic to olives and seafood/squid but I cleaned my plate - if I died because of this dish, it was worth it! 5/5

La Bisque de Homard:
Lobster bisque with morels and edamame. Lobster, mushrooms and edamame? Excellent! Great consistency and flavor. 5/5

Le Beuf:
Beef cheek with natural jus and vegetables. Super tender beef you can eat with just a fork. 5/5

Le Canard:
Duck with sweet and sour daikon and young leeks. I trust French chefs/restaurants to make a great duck dish...I've never been disappointed. Tender thinly sliced and well-seasoned duck that's perfectly cooked. You get 4 slices of daikon that tastes a bit smokey than sweet/sour. 5/5

Mashed Potatoes:
Very creamy potatoes...no lumps, imperfections whatsoever. Let's ignore the butter and fat content for one night...it's delicious! 5/5

Les Tartes:
Different kinds of tarts: raspberry tart, chocolate, caramel and peanut tart, orange tart, cinnamon tart and pistachio tart. Great sampling of different tarts. My faces were chocolate, caramel and peanut tart, and pistachio tart. 5/5

La Fraise:
Strawberry daiquiri with yogurt sorbet and pop rocks. I'm a 80's baby so I grew up eating pop rocks and I enjoy re-living my childhood. They're mixed in with the fresh strawberries and the sorbet...you can hear the fizz. The yogurt sorbet is so yummy...and at the bottom is a strawberry daiquiri jelly. 5/5

Le Chocolat:
Chocolate ice cream, cremeux, Araguani dark chocolate and Oreo cookie crumbs. Incredible dessert. Fine-quality chocolate with a good chocolate ice cream and crunch from Oreos. 5/5

I can try real hard to find a flaw but it's just not happening. I'm just laughing at the thought of forgetting whose birthday we were celebrating: mine (August) or my sister's (October). The highlight of the evening was meeting Joel Robuchon and chatting with him. C'es magnifique, Monsieur Robuchon!

I had three thoughts running through my head as my wife and I were walking out.

1. Outfuckingstanding!!
2. I am having this, this and this next time.
3. We better come back soon because popularity is inevitable and I am going to dread when I'll have to wait 30+ minutes for a table.  I'll do it though.  

Eating at the bar was great since we were able to chat with Woosuk aka Ryan aka the owner throughout our meal.  He handles everything with Moko except for the cooking.  That's left to Chef Hong who is a goooooodddddaaaamn culinary wizard!!  That guy is a total one man show coming in at 10am daily to prep all their amazing stuff for dinner when doors open at 5pm.    

Just discussing the effort and detail Hong goes into preparing plates like the delectable beef short rib (butchering the beef himself, select bones to cook with to enhance the flavor, 3+ hours of cooking etc) was inspiring.  A well presented dish, the beefy fattiness of the short rib accompanied by crispy garlic, gratin and amazing sauce was heavenly.    Christina Perri's "A Thousand Years" was playing while I savored it all and it seemed very fitting.  

It's not often that an Asian restaurant includes a spoon for their table setting but Ryan is smart enough to know the sauce for not only the short rib but others like their "Black Bean Noodle" will/need/must be scooped up out of the bowl.  It sure looks a lot more elegant than sticking my face into it.  Genius!   

They offer Berkshire pork belly cooked for either 10 or 30(!!!) hours.  Even though the 10 hour belly is tenderer, how could I pass up 20 more hours of cooking for $1 more?  It was like nothing I'd ever had before.  The soybean paste marinade with the kimchi crepe and their homemade black raspberry marinated salt (who does that???) was exceptional. 

The grilled then chilled eggplant salad with micro greens and tomato was refreshing and flavorful.  We also got an order of the fried soy chicken wings which was like modern soul food with the unique breading and honey glaze.  There was absolutely nothing left but bones.  

I entered Moko expecting a decent meal and left having an excellent one.  There's nothing quite like this in Vegas at the moment.  Go go go!!

I almost don't want to write this review and be stingy with this special place, yet I want to also burst and tell someone "Hey, LISTEN!" 

We found our cigar home. This place is leaps and bounds above the rest and I can prove it. 

First, let me tell you the bad. Okay, it's in a industrial area between the strip and downtown. I don't care, but maybe some of you snoots do. This means cigarzens from areas not as lucky as us with stock can easily come here though. Second, is their hours are office hours. Mon- Fri, 10am - 6pm. This place really is their head offices that they decided, why not make a humidor and a place for people to hang out? Often I find places that don't "need" the business, but do it out of love do it best. They outfit several stores along the strip, have a co-ownership in Casa Fuente, own Rhumbar (also cigar friendly!), Tacos&Tequila, and soon will be opening more. 

So the humidor is pristine and one of the most meticulously cared for. I love the spacious layout, a few people can be in there and not have to maneuver around each other uncomfortably. Everything in it is lined up just so, not a stick out of place or damaged, no unattractive stacking of boxes and clutter everywhere as there is a secondary humidor for stock. Jason switches up the humidity based on the seasons and keeps it in the low to mid 60's which is the sweet spot really for longevity. The A/C system keeping the humidors going is its very own so nothing but clean air is getting in there. They have a advanced purification system for the water used which accounts for lack of a humid smell in there  but also so there isn't this "film" on items from using janky Vegas water to humidify. The blowers and system were picked for the way it could be maintained and control it from fluctuating. It kinda blew my mind to be explained the differences between systems and why they do it this way. I love when people go the extra mile for the better result. Here, it shows and it's a beautiful thing. 

Now the actual product.  I almost don't want to tell you what kind of rarities and gems pass through these doors so I won't name names, just that there can be some surprises.  If I find they keep running out of stock all of a sudden, I will find you and yell at you for being greedy. Please don't be hoarding 50 boxes of something super rare  just because you can bankroll it. Community respect, specially since I'm telling you a community secret. There is variety, but not ridiculous amounts - it's well curated. The kicker is the pricing. These are the best prices anywhere. I got a certain something something for cheap here that normally is jacked up due to it's rarity for under $20. I love the mentality here that just because it's rare doesn't mean it justifies being flipped for way above retail. The pricing is fair across the board, no matter what it is. The same cigar I saw at another store in town for $50.

I think it's clear we are fans of the dude that runs it, Jason. He's humble and easy going, but talk to him long enough and it'll be clear there isn't a cigar you can really stump him on. There is comfy seating so do stay and smoke. Bring your own drink, snack, etc. since you might be here a while.. Jason will probably chat you up, but there are always people in here passionate about cigars hanging out. If you want to meet people who are deep in the hobby, this would be the place. A lot of important people in the hospitality industry come to sit at these chairs as well on their lunch break. Even though theres always cigars going, it never gets to be thick with smoke nor reek of tobacco smell as its very well ventilated. You can even catch sports games since they always have the TV on, with the volume kept low. We sat there and I was comfy as I enjoyed my stogie. Sure, it's a office building essentially so not the well oiled digs of a swank looking cigar lounge, but the company and comfy vibe cannot be beat. It feels like hanging out at home, if you made your office into a cigar den.

I know we will be regulars, we absolutely love it here and will make this part of our day off ritual. Whether you want to smoke a cigar, but never have or a seasoned aficionado- this is a place that will please. Come find me, I'm sure we'll be here.

Highland Dr and Industrial Rd are better known for their close proximity to the Las Vegas glittery night life, where even the least physically attractive individuals can lease the personal attention of barely clothed seductive sirens $20 at a time.  But thanks to Rollin' Smoke Barbeque, this same area will also be known for down to earth, simply delicious BBQ. 

On a recent weekday evening, a handful of coworkers decided to meet here post work to try some BBQ that Nelson Q has proudly put his 5 Yelp stars stamp of approval on. In typical fashion, I was the first to arrive.  The parking lot was empty except for 2 cars, all the other businesses were closed, and there was a guy in suits finishing his early dinner.

The restaurant itself is very low key. It housed nothing flashy in terms of decorations, except for a big boar's head mounted on one of the walls. The lobby/ordering counter is in a small room, but the main dining area is in the adjacent room. The seats are comfortable, and there is a TV for you to watch sports or highlights, while you wait for your order.

Most of us opted to try the Outlaw Burger. For $6.99 + tax, this burger is the size of two of my fists stacked on top of each other.  It is packed with a 1 lb patty (60% brisket and 40% ground beef) and cooks down to about 12 oz, served with Rollin' Smoke's homemade tangy BBQ sauce, the usual vegetable fixings and some (lettuce, tomato, fried onions, scallions, and cheese) which not only made it physically big but the flavors complimented each other and resulted in a mean serving of burger that I can easily recommend to anyone not opposed to eating pork and beef.  For $2, you get a drink and choice of one side (bacon potato salad would be a good pick), and make your order a combo.  Currently there is also a Yelp Check-In promotion, where you get a complimentary dessert with your order.

Rollin' Smoke BBQ, now my personal #1 one pound burger in LV.

Decor:  3/5  No frills hole in the wall restaurant. You are here because you want good BBQ, not design ideas for your Texas ranch.

Food:  4/5  Good BBQ made with passion and love.  They serve Blue Belle ice cream too (coworkers said it reminded them of the ice cream in the Philippines. I will take their words for it.)

Value:  4/5  Good for the wallet. I estimate that 65%+ of you will not be able to finish the Outlaw Burger, side + drink.

Location:  5/5  Not far at all if you are visiting the Strip.  The cabbies will probably know it too, if not, it is just down the street from Sapphire. 

Parking:  5/5  It is practically all for Rollin' Smoke BBQ customers.

Easily 4 stars!

P.S.  If you stop by during lunch, I heard this is where some of them sirens get their lunch/breakfast before/after work. So I've heard.

My 2nd oldest turned 21 baby!! She wanted a dinner party with family and friends and she picked the place, after all it was her night her party!  The place picked for the event was The Old Spaghetti Factory.  The Old Spaghetti Factory has been a place my family has enjoyed going to, from my grandparents to my grandkids, we have all had a nice time, the family use to go to the one out by Newport Beach, then when we moved to Phoenix, we went to the downtown location. So it was no surprise she picked this place.

We were a party of 20, when we went to the room were the tables were setup my son in law didn't like the flow of it because it had  1/2 the party on one side and other  1/2 away from them, so we moved some tables around and made a upside down L shapped table, which worked and we all got to interact with everyone.

We got there about 7pm, around 7:25  servers asked for our drink orders, around 7:45 they started asking us for our orders, but none of us had any menus but we were never able to tell anyone we didn't have menus because there was no one around, we ordered our food around 8pm.  By this time most of everyone's drinks needed to refilled, the bread that was out is now gone and there are no servers to be found.  I had to ask for tea 3 times.

The food wasn't mind blowing, it wasn't even that great, I did ignore the reviews other Yelpers wrote because this was what my daughter wanted and I wasn't going to be all Oh other Yelpers said this wasn't that great. No I wanted her to have what she wanted.    

I ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce, it was bland, no flavor, but I did eat it, I was starving. By now its after 9pm everyone was done with their meal and ready to get on the 2nd  1/2 of the party, but again no servers and no checks, people starting standing up and then out of magical air our checks showed up, everyone was not happy with the service they got, had to ask many times for refills, cheese, napkins, plates, other random things one asks for.  85% of the party skipped the free ice cream SKIPPED THE FREE ICE CREAM, the kids were the only ones who went for it, everyone else just wanted to leave.  Fortunately even with the bland food & missing servers my daughters night was not ruined. 

Oh I also should point out, I told the server that it was my daughter's 21st birthday and I wanted to buy her 1st legal drink and she took the drink order, but NEVER ID my daughter. What if I was lying about her age??   smh

British Chefs - 1. American Chefs - 0.

Way to go Gordy for beating America at their own game. Pow, tough blow. Sorry!

Ok, joking aside... wow! Hubby and I have been wanting to visit BurGR for quite a while and the wait was totally worth it. Our first night in Vegas with family visiting from England we brought them here and everybody left happy. 
The Burger choice that dominated our party of 5 was the Farm BurGR (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww) - $15. Duck Breast Bacon, English Sharp Cheddar and a Fried Egg, oh my! I'm not usually one to have Fried Egg's on well anything really but what a combination. With the Burger cooked medium everything worked in perfect harmony. The Egg was perfect, the Beef was perfect and the Cheddar.. Omigosh REAL Cheese!! I'm getting excited just thinking about it. Honestly the best Burger I have had and I have tried a lot in the last 4 years. 
Doesn't it look gooood? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#TEjwrTxroAEuQetkvvbq_Q

- Fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#f3JKGLIzBcGQ8WBlHkvXJg) - $8. Served with Curry Ketchup & Chipotle Ketchup. The Curry Ketchup was delicious but the Fries themselves really were nothing special, just your average deep fried Potato. You could omit these from your meal and not miss them. 

The Milkshakes here are delicious too, more of a Dessert than a Milkshake due to the layer of Pudding on the top of them. My Husband and I decided to share one during our first visit and enjoyed it so much we ended up coming back the following night just so that we could have another. They do take a while to arrive though, probably due to the complexity of making them.

- Shake #4 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#3ESC7tVlSjesQ7UnKDuGRw) $9. Oreo Shake topped with Creme Brulee Pudding, whipped Cream and an Oreo Cookie. Get this one! Seriously. Of the 2 I tried this was by far the best and although Creme Brulee and Oreo together seemed a little wrong to me it turned out to be oh so right.

- Shake #2 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#beA0lKBsYSIdxqCK8lp5Qw) - $9. Strawberry Shake topped with Coconut Pudding and a Chocolate Cookie.

Service was fine, efficient but not amazing but once your food arrives who needs someone coming around every 5 minutes checking up on you anyway.

*TIP*
Very little wait on a Wednesday evening - 6:30pm, 5 people = 10 minutes!

We skipped WNW last season because almost all first year parks have growing pains to deal with.  (Cowabunga Bay visitors will experience this too.  The park is expected to open in five weeks, yet they just started putting the first slide together!)  

When we learned that WNW would be open for Spring Break I decided to buy four gold season passes.  In just one week, we have already gotten our money's worth.
We visited the park three times this week and had a great time.  We were even able to cash in three guest passes.  

The negative reviews come from people who did not plan well, or had unreasonable expectations.  If you do some planning, you can avoid a lot of hassle.  Here are some of my tips-

1. The water is pretty cold, but it should be.  This is not a spa.  When it's 90+ degrees outside the water feels great once you get used to it.  

2. If you are local, the gold pass is the way to go.   Single day tickets are not a good value.

3. Lines will be long on the weekends during the summer, just like any other park.  Odds are, we will never go on the weekends once school is out.

4. Wear water shoes or flip flops at all times.  You can hold flip flops going down the slides.  The concrete will tear up your feet.

5. Don't even try to sneak drinks or food in.  Your bags will be searched.  Just keep food in the car and have a picnic in the giant park area and get your hand stamped.  If you are seen with outside food, you will be asked to throw it away or be escorted out of the park.  Even sunflower seeds. You are allowed to bring a sealed bottle of water. Not a water bottle.  

6. Make sure everyone in your party is at least 42 inches tall.  Anyone shorter will have very limited things to do.  There are only two slides that require you to be 48 inches.

7. Enjoy the people watching.  The terrible tats and middle aged women with artificial chest enhancements are incredibly amusing.  They think they are pretty hot.  

8. The food is not bad at all.  Cough up the $12.99 to get the WNW cup.  Then enjoy 99 cent refills all season long. (free refills the day of purchase) The waffle fries and pizza are serviceable.

9. Carrying the rafts up four to five flights of stairs is a pain, but not as bad as people make it out to be.  They are rafts full of air.  They are more awkward than heavy.  

10. If you are a season pass holder try and go to the park during non-peak times.  Of course the place will be busy on the weekend.  Duh!

My daughter and I were in line to get in at 9:45 yesterday morning.  When we got in we found two chairs by the river and set up shop.  Within 80 minutes we had rode each slide in the park at least twice.  We were out the door at noon when the crowd was just starting to pour in.  Had we not already spent two full days there this week, we would have stayed longer.  We felt our mission was accomplished.

For those who complain that WNW is small and are looking forward to Cowabunga Bay, I have some bad news for you.  WNW is currently 41 acres, and Cowabunga Bay will be 22 acres.  In addition, WNW owns an additional 71 acres to expand upon, and Cowabunga Bay is land locked in most directions.

"I rather eat like no one's watching than dance like no one's watching."  - Cristela Alonzo

I'm no cheese steak expert nor have I had an actual philly cheese steak from Philadelphia but I will say that this is a damn good sandwich.  It has everything I was looking for:  lots of meat, lots of cheese, and lots of flavor!  Great Friday night meal!

The beef is juicy, tender, and plentiful and the cheese helped glue everything together. I got the red sauce on the side since I wasn't sure what to expect but after trying it out, I will say that I'm definitely getting it on it next time.  One tiny cup just isn't enough!  That tomato sauce with oregano and other spices... Yum!  Mr. W. ran out of red sauce fast for his 12in. sandwich.  I had mine with no vegetables because I usually never finish my meal in one sitting and end up taking it home.  I figured the vegetables will fill me up too fast and I wanted to try to finish majority of it while it was still piping hot.  I will shamefully admit that I took down all 8-inches like a champ [that's what she said].  It was a feat that both impressed and scared Mr. W.  We also got our combos with the seasoned fries which were actually potato wedges.  Not bad or extraordinary but the star is definitely the sandwich with the red sauce.

This is a family-owned establishment and this is seriously the sweetest family ever.  I had a chance to talk with the boss-lady/mother and she was a delight!  The ambiance of the joint is super casual and the sound of metal cooking utensils banging on the flat-top stove only adds to the charm.  Ah, a place where I can eat like a pig and no one would judge me.  Also to note, they have this crazy drink called Barq's red creme soda.  I've never heard of it or had it before tonight and I can never go back to such ignorance!  And since it is a small family-owned place, the wait time can be pretty long since it's made to order but the wait is worth it.  EAT HERE, PEOPLE!

If you are looking for a really good Italian beef sandwich, you will find it here. Hubby and I stopped here for dinner and left full and satisfied. The inside is clean and there are plenty of tables. The employees were friendly and went over some of the menu items with us. They have Italian sausage, wraps, char-grilled burgers, hot dogs, salads, chili, tamales and fries, but my first time I had to try what they are famous for.

So, I ordered an "Italian Beef Sandwich" (regular Al) priced at $6.35 and added provolone and hot peppers for 50 cents each topping as well asked for the sandwich to be dipped. The bread really held up everything in it very well. Napkins are required when eating this sandwich dipped! The beef was tender and had good flavor and the peppers added a nice flavor to the sandwich. I also ordered a small "Cheddar Cheese Fries" priced at $3.85 and just thought they were average. Next time I am going to try them with different toppings. I liked that my food was made fresh in front of me. There isn't a drive-thru here, but if you are on a time crunch you can phone in your order for pick-up.

Can I give negative stars? 
My boyfriend and I went into this restaurant for a drink while walking through old town. We were welcomed in and told that there were 2 seats at the corner of the bar. We sat and asked them what their on drink selection was. Since they were all over priced and we were just stopping by for a drink while we explored the area we ordered a beer each. I accidently bumped into a customer that was wedged in the corner eating dinner when I went to sit in the high top chair. I apologized to her and quickly we started up a conversation with this couple that was in their 50's. The manager rushes over asks the couple if they would like to move... okay weird. They said no. I wasn't trying to intrude on their meal or anything and they did seem interested in the conversation. As I turn back to the bar the bartender slaps our tab on in front of us. He said "here's your check please pay and leave." I said "Excuse me" and he responded "You are a waste of space at my bar." I was shocked! Never have I been treated like that or basically kicked out of a bar. I have worked in customer service my entire life and I definitely do not deserved to be treated like trash. I became infuriated as I responded "are you serious?" All he said was "Leave" and walked away from us. My boyfriend said, "Let's just get out of here. This place sucks anyway." As we walk out I see the manager as he ushers us towards the door and I told him what happened and he said "I'm sure this isn't the first time that you have been kicked out of somewhere!" WHAT!!!!!! Seriously?! What sparked all of this? I like to have a good time, I am social, I love a good drink and great food! WHAT THE HELL! NEVER in my life have I ever been kicked out of somewhere and I cannot even begin to understand why I was kicked out of this restaurant bar. For god sakes it is an italian restaurant with carpeting! Yuck and the manager or owner what ever he is such a d-bag!  Plus he appeared to be drunk or on drugs or something. Such a weird, trying to be sauve, high on something, wanna be al pacino presence. How do you run a business like this and survive? I however cannot comment on the food since I will NEVER EVER go back there, but with such horrible discriminating service who would ever go there?! Save yourself the aggravation and do not help this jerk prosper with your hard earned money. What a fake establishment! They welcome you in to the bar from the street and then kick you out? Very questionable service to me.

This ended up being Plan B after the debacle that was "Bastille Day" at a restaurant that rhymes with "Barche Macchus" when they offered to seat us in a storage room.  I've had this place bookmarked for 3 years and it was finally time, baby!

Bob Taylor's Ranch House is a throwback in so many ways from the cowboy decor, to the music and even menu.  Just the entrance itself is photoworthy!  I felt like I was at some roadside restaurant in the middle of nowhere Texas.  Seeing the chef turning all those steaks as the hostess walked us to our table had me salivating big time!

We got the cajun shrimp appetizer which was just ok.  While the flavor was nice, the shrimp was a little on the small side.  We still ended up soaking up all the sauce with the complimentary "garlic cheese toast".  

The wife got the filet (rare) and I got the bone-in ribeye (medium rare) after much encouragement from our friendly waitress.  The ribeye was a massive 24 oz's of which I was only able to finish half of.  I usually prefer rare steaks but when it comes to the ribeye cut, I prefer it a little more cooked so I can appreciate all the parts of it from the outside char to the tender center and everything in between.  $42.99 for a ribeye seems cheap these days haha.  The filet mignon was very tender with great flavor. 

All entrees come with your choice of soup (it was a not bad lobster bisque) or salad (avoided based on Jade's review of it being IHop-esque) and a side. I got the twice baked potato only because I wanted the cook to work a little instead of paying for a baked potato which requires really no work at all.  My wife got the ranch house potatoes which could only be described as crazy hash browns.  No $12 a la carte sides items like 16 miles away from here!

Somehow got coerced into getting dessert and was brought the biggest slice of chocolate cake I'd ever seen.  I enjoyed all 3 bites I had before shoving that into the third takeout box of the evening.

Considering how ticked off my wife and I were for things not going as planned that evening, this was a very welcome surprise.  I am a big fan!  Not sure I would go out of my way to make it back here but this would certainly be on the top of my list when I am back around these parts.

Meeting a friend who was visiting from out of town, our party of 5 (plus infant) decided to meet at Ramen Sora for dinner. We got there, but they were packed to the gills, so we decided to head to Wendy's Noodle House instead, since our friend had a plane to catch and didn't want to waste our time waiting for a table. I remember coming here years ago when they first opened. I enjoyed my meal here that time, but haven't been back since. 

We were seated quickly and the service was pretty hospitable. They came to take our orders pretty quickly despite sending them away several times because we were chatting so much we were too distracted to actually pick something to eat from the littany of menu options. Our table started with some xiao long bao and steak baos for appetizers. I didn't get a chance to try either of these, but my friends raved about them. I ordered a Thai tea with boba and the noodles in xo sauce. The food came out quickly and and everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed their meals. My noodles were nice and spicy and had a great texture. There wasn't one thing we ordered that we didn't enjoy. 

There are many things to love about this place. The prices were beyond reasonable, their menu selection is extensive and everything we ordered was tasty. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying some of the noodle soups and desserts on the menu. Great little spot I'm glad I rediscovered.

What to do when you get to the airport WAY early AND your flight out of Vegas is delayed at least another thirty minutes?  Duh!  Drink, silly!

Since this was on my way OUT of Sin City instead of on my way IN, I was no naive sap:

Me: "How much is the Mangorita?" (drink prices are ODDLY not listed on the menu)

Waiter: "One Mangorita."

Me: "No.  How MUCH DOES IT COST?"

Waiter: "$12"

Me:  "That's what I thought.  I'll have a Mangorita, please."

Hey, you expected me NOT to get it? 

Actually, for Vegas prices, this was quite reasonable (who would have imagined that food and drinks would be CHEAPER at the airport than in the city you're visiting?).  The Mangorita surprisingly tasted like REAL and FRESH mango instead of some artificial "mango" syrup.  It was blended and slightly sweet but not syrupy and served in a pint glass. Also, the waiter claimed it had a double shot of tequila and while I couldn't taste it, I sure as hell felt it.  

Woo!  Drunk plane ride!  Yay!

I also ordered the chicken chimichanga.  As someone who used to fry chimis professionally in high school (yay crappy part time job!), I wanted to go back to the kitchen and give the cook a little tutorial.  The size was good, but it was undercooked on the outside (although nice and hot inside) so while the ends were crispy, the middle of the outside was kind of doughy (bleh).  I slathered on the generous portion of guacamole to hide the icky texture because, as mentioned above, the Mangorita was starting to take over my body.  It was filled with plenty of shredded chicken but also with shredded lettuce.  Um, WILTED shredded lettuce.  Bleh again.

The chips tasted like they came from a bag opened yesterday instead of being made on site. The salsa tasted like it may have been made last week by my mother who considers black pepper to be "too spicy" to add to her food. Triple bleh!

One last bit of super USEFUL info: this is ONLY a good option if you've got PLENTY of time before your flight.  

Our meal took over an HOUR.  The waiter came over, took our drink order, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back, took our food order, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our drinks, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our water, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with our food, said "right away" when I asked him to bring the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, brought the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back for the check, disappeared for 10 minutes, came back with the receipt to sign.  I have no idea if he came back to pick up the signed receipt because we didn't wait around another 10 minutes.  

I found this really weird for a restaurant in an airport. We were inside the "secure area" so it's not like we just stopped by for a nice lunch.  We had a plane to catch!

***Mandalay Bay's Fleur is a good option for an upscale lunch in Las Vegas***

Fleur used to be Fleur de Lys, a more traditional fine dining restaurant (based on the original SF location), but Hubert Keller converted it into Fleur, a modern tapas spot (probably to better align with the diverse crowd that Vegas attracts).

I tried Fleur a few years ago and for the most part the food was good (with some just okay dishes here and there).  Despite the quality of the food, the portions were incredibly dainty making Fleur feel quite overpriced.

For lunch, Fleur works better though (at least in terms of value).  There is a mix of small plates so you can get a small taste of what Fleur cooks up at dinner.  There are also more substantial lunch plates--sandwiches and salads but also entrees like steak frites and salmon.

I started with the burrata salad--something I would expect to see on the dinner menu and it was actually a substantial starter.  There was a generous portion of burrata, which was very creamy.  The burrata sat on some good, juicy and sweet heirloom tomatoes.  The burrata was topped with tomato pearls.

There was also olive oil powder and basil powder.  The basil powder had a stronger flavor, but the olive oil powder had a more memorable texture as it turned to almost cream upon tasting it.

Everything was garnished with a really good balsamic--a very deep and rich flavor.  There was also a side of bread, which was just okay--they probably should have toasted it.

For my entree, I went with the steak frites, which included a very generous portion of hanger steak.  There were two pieces of steak.  One was cooked very nicely.  It was incredibly tender and also quite juicy.  The even cooking of the steak (maybe it was sous vide) was very impressive.  There was also a good outside sear.

The other piece of steak was not as good (maybe the unevenness of temperature had to with how the pieces were quite different in size).  The steak was okay, but it was not as tender and a little dry in parts.

The steak had a good flavor; I still would have preferred more seasoning because the sauce was too light in flavor to add much.  With steak frites, I like a richer bordelaise like the one at Lucques (Los Angeles).

The herb garlic frites were nice and crisp.  The frites were a little uneven in seasoning as some frites had more of a garlic flavor, which was nice.

They had several desserts, but I didn't think much sounded exciting.  I ended up opting for the almond panna cotta.  The panna cotta was topped with strawberry citrus soup and then garnished with blackberries, streusel, and kalamansi blackberry sorbet.  The panna cotta had a great consistency.  It was creamy, smooth and light.

There was not much of an almond flavor while there was an overabundance of strawberry citrus soup.  The strawberry soup kind of overpowered the panna cotta.

I liked the streusel, which was buttery and crisp.  The kalamansi blackberry sorbet was also good--not icy and very cool and refreshing.

Service was very good.  My server was personable and polite.  He was also very attentive and intuitive even though he had to service many tables.  The hostess was nice too (and attractive if that is important to you).

As mentioned, prices are not too bad.  Almost everything was priced under $20 and portions were more than generous on a few plates.

For lunch, only the cafe is open.  While the decor is nice and contemporary, it is close to the casino so you have to deal with casino noise; the cigarette smoke also wafts over a little bit, which is unfortunate.

For dinner, the main dining room is much nicer.  The room is very contemporary, but it is also very warm (great use of warm colors) and inviting.  It is also farther back in the restaurant, which makes it feel like a nice and relaxing retreat from Vegas.

The food at Fleur is good for both lunch and dinner, but lunch is much more affordable.  There are not many notable upscale places open for lunch in Vegas so it is nice to have an option like Fleur available.

Fleur is located in Mandalay Bay and like many casinos, Mandalay Bay has its own free parking structure.  The structure leads right to Fleur's entrance.

We stayed at the Renaissance for a week, and couldn't have been happier with a hotel.  It starts off with the staff.  Everyone we encountered was very friendly and outgoing, and you knew they were willing to do anything you asked to make your stay happy.

The rooms were also very nice, being both spacious and including all of the amenities you would want.  A nice television, a big desk, refrigerator, an in-room safe, comfortable beds, and most importantly to me a shower with tons of water pressure.  And all of the rooms have wonderful views, depending on which way you're facing.  Our view was the US Airways Center, Chase Field, and the mountains in the background.  (Not sure if technically they were mountains. But they were beautiful anyway.). It was very cool to always know that when you looked out the window you were either going to see the hustle and bustle of downtown life, or the serenity of the landscape in the distance.

As far as food options, there is Marston's Cafe and the Icon Lounge.  We never had a chance to eat at Marston's, but we hit up the Icon a few times.  That will be covered in a separate review.  This will also cover Marston's, since all of the food is prepared in a central kitchen and the menus overlap somewhat.  There are also tons of local food options within a block or two of the hotel.

The fitness center is a bit on the small side, but there are a few ellipticals and treadmills, along with some free weights and Nautilus equipment.  It's enough to get the job done when you're on the road.  There's also a huge outdoor seating area with tables and chairs, along with couches, to relax and enjoy yourself in the fresh air.  This is also where the pool area is located.

So why only four stars?  For one, the prices.  You can get a good deal on a room, but the prices of everything else is where they will get you.  And definitely be wary if you have a rental car, because on-site parking is $27 per day.  And then there is the issue of the elevators.  If you had to be in the lobby at a certain time, you had to give yourself at least a 10-minute headstart, if not more.  And definitely pay attention when you hit the down button.  You'll notice that it will go out on you when you're not looking, and no elevator will be heading your way.  And it will happen again, and again.  After the first couple of days, we realized the easiest method of getting to the lobby was actually catching an up elevator, and then riding back down.  And everyone else figured this out as well, so when elevators did actually show up, sometimes you had to wait three or four cycles for one with room in it.

I know that's a minor gripe, but when you're taking the elevators multiple times per day over the course of a week, it does get frustrating.  If they ever get the elevator situation under control, I could easily see revisiting up to five stars.

I'm the first real person to review this place, let all other fake spammers be gone!  Yelp should really work that shizzle out.  Zack S...um this place closes at 11 so you couldn't have possibly hit the bar...so yeah if your gonna post fake reviews at least check your facts..

This place has so much potential, yet the ridiculously bad service just overshadowed everything good they did.

This is probably the worst service I have ever received in my life.  

Do you guys remember in Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts goes into the first store on Rodeo and the snooty lady acts like she's too good for this place?  Well that's what they did to us.

Where's the hostess?  Oh she's chatting with her friend...*ignoring me*

We finally get seated and then we sit and wait...

and wait...

and wait...

finally I get up and ask one of the waiters at the cash register to send over someone...

She treats us like we're a nuisance to her, she's singing along to the song that's playing...(WTF?)  I think they turned up the music louder as more people left because by the time it was near closing time it was blaring hip hop music...really weird considering it was a nice casual Italian restaurant.

We order almost 200 bucks worth of food, and then she's like "is that it?"

excuse me bitch...watch the attitude...

Wait, wait, watch as all the waiters get together to talk about us...seriously I can see you whispering about us....this is so unprofessional right now....

We seriously waited for like an hour and a half, it was ridiculous!  The place was practically empty!  The waiters were standing around and chatting with each other.  I took pictures as evidence!

This place is supposed to be a nice place, for the prices they charge they should have a whole restaurant re-staffed because it was ridiculous!  I have never felt more uncomfortable and treated so rudely in my life!

I also wanted to order take out for later and apparently they don't have take out boxes?  You're a restaurant?  You don't have boxes?  Seriously?

This is the worst experience in a restaurant I have ever had.  I've gotten better service at Carls Jr in a shady neighborhood than this.  

I won't hesitate to tell everyone to avoid this restaurant when you're in Vegas because this was outrageous!  No one treats me like that and gets away with it!  I wish I had a You've been yelped card so I could give them a piece of my mind.

I'm like those crazy housewives who have nothing better to do...I won't stop calling to speak to management until someone is fired.  I'm serious, no one gets away with treating me like that without suffering repercussions.  We don't play that, I'm sorry I'm not one of those quiet asian people who take your shit...I will not be silenced... You best believe.  You're done..The end.


*note I left for the manager*

"This is probably the most unprofessional and ridiculous restaurant I have ever had the misfortune to experience, not just from the our waitress, but the waitstaff and blatant ignorance from most of the employees I had to encounter."
                                                                   Anthony Nguyen

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW

Olive & Ivy is another one of Sam Fox's restaurant concepts, one which we like. http://www.foxrc.com/restaurants/olive-ivy-restaurant-marketplace/

We came here after a movie on the Fourth of July around four. It was mostly empty and we felt we had the run of the place just to ourselves.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
On most nights this is a crazy busy place with a bar area that can get crowded very quickly. Yet on other nights...  well it can be empty. It tends to be more young, after work-ish, along with the 40s/50s who live nearby. Yesterday, there was a dozen of us evenly split, outnumbering the staff. 

MENU:
You have two menus to choose from, Dinner and Happy Hour. Both are incredibly large and diverse for the 3 to 6 HH period. The major difference between the two is the lack of pastas, and that the salads can only be found on the Dinner menu. See link: http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Olive_And_Ivy_Happy_Hour_Menu.pdf

SERVICE:
It can be a little uneven, though we find it mostly amusing. We were seated this time in the dining room, near the bar. The wait staff is off doing various things and completely out of sight. A hard thing to do considering the vast open expanse of the restaurant. LOL

They tend to drop off a dish and then get lost; only returning to the area to see if you are done. No water glass refills, no inquires to see if you want another drink, etcetera. 

After dropping off their signature pesto and bread, we were told absent-mindedly, "oh, it's our basil parmesan something-or-other". Really. LOL

FOOD:
The food is very good, with interesting layers for the palate. On this visit we started with the Fresh Mozzarella (photo)-- which comes with a yummy tomato jam with basil on top for only $4.00. Delicious. Then we each ordered a salad (photos) -- the Mediterranean that has couscous while the Butter Lettuce comes a' la BLT with gorgonzola cheese. 

The Med was huge, and large enough for two. It was only ten dollars though we added a chicken breast for an extra four dollars. We were less impressed with the Butter, since it came with only three small Bib lettuce leaves. It was very tasty, though small compared to the Med.  The wine selection is fairly large and fairly priced. See the photo of their huge transparent "Feature Wall" of wine by the bar. 

PRICES:
You'll find some Old Town price creep with some items, but it's not too crazy. The above salads were in the $12 to $14 range which seem about right. 

The HH menu tends to be in the $6 to $8 range and is generous.  Our bill came in just over $40 and we had an email 25% off coupon. That is something we like about being on the Fox Concept email list. There's at least one coupon or promotion going a month. Nice!

Enjoy!

If you are thinking of trying Mundo for the first time, please read
this. This was the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant.
Unfortunately we weren't able to try the food because we were verbally
attacked by the owner, Mingo Collaso, so this review is for the
experience only. Here's what happened.

My husband and I (we are locals) called the restaurant at 3 pm, asking
if they were still serving lunch. The host was very sweet and polite
and said they were serving dinner and happy hour. I told her we had a
baby in a car seat (she is 8 weeks old and sleeps all day as newborns do)- and could we bring her into the restaurant with us to eat. She said she'd check and seconds later she said it would be fine.

We arrived, were politely greeted, the host acknowledged that I had
called, and she brought us to our table. There was not ONE OTHER
PERSON in the restaurant. I repeat- we were the only people there. We
sat down and the server/ bartender greeted us and we ordered a
cocktail. We then ordered several items off the happy hour menu. The
baby was being great (still in her carseat), we had cocktails, food on
its way- so far so good.

Then a man (owner Mingo Collaso) walked up to our table and said, "I
want you to know there's nothing I can do about it now, but children
are not allowed in the restaurant." I looked at him with a confused look,
since we had been seated there by the host, and said, "Well, I called
ahead and asked--" and he interrupted me and said, "I don't care. Like
I said, there's nothing I can do about it now." I said, "are you
asking us to leave?" and he responded again, "I don't care."

I asked him, "Why are you treating us this way? Why are you being so
rude?" He responded again about how children were not allowed, and I
pointed out that there was not one other person in the restaurant and
we had called and asked. He repeated, "I don't care," and turned on
his heels and stormed OUT of the restaurant.

We were shocked. I have never been treated this badly in a restaurant
in my life. I worked in the service industry for ten years and have
never seen anyone treated like this. We had called ahead about the
baby, arrived when not a single person was there, ordered drinks and
food, and were suddenly attacked by the owner. I felt like I got
punched in the face.

He was obviously mad at his staff for allowing us in and behaved like
a child by taking it out on us. I will strongly advise anyone who
wants a positive service experience to not go to Mundo. The owner is
unprofessional, unkind, and rude. I literally left in tears thanks to him.

4/7/10

Wanted to try this place back in March when Mom and I spotted an ad mentioning Filipino food in the plaza, but we'd already eaten pho, so had to wait until the next shopping opportunity brought us to this area again.  Met the very warm and friendly owners-- we really do wish them great success!

Since it was almost closing time, the food items in the buffet, and there weren't many to choose from, didn't look interesting, so we decided to try the pork skewers (the recipe of which the husband and wife team were very proud of), as well as the liempo (pork belly) serving that called out to Mom.  A combo plate of these two items also came with rice and achara (pickled papaya and carrots).  I also ordered one piece of saba at langka [saba bananas (or in this case, plantains) and jackfruit, wrapped in lumpia wrapper and deep-fried].

The wait for our food took longer than I expected, but it wasn't too much of an issue since Mom took awhile to do the groceries.  The wait, however, was worth it!  I really enjoyed the pork barbecue skewers- the flavors really took me back to my childhood in the Philippines, when street food, already a daily ritual for us then (and just now gaining popularity stateside) had us sampling BBQ, fried fishballs (and the many different sauces to dip them in!), steamed rolled rice and tuber pancakes, ripe and sour mangoes (the latter eaten with bagoong (very tiny salted shrimp) or vinegar and garlic, and "dirty" ice cream, to name a few from food carts that were to be seen all over Metro Manila and around colleges (grammar schools) and universities ("colleges" here).  Writing about those pork skewers actually make me want to stop at Mekong Plaza now, instead of going for Italian or French food I was considering earlier!  The liempo, on the other hand, I could've gone without; I remember thinking that we should've just ordered a double of the BBQ!  The skewers were just more flavorful than the pork belly pieces.  While Mom enjoyed the liempo, she did agree that the BBQ was were the money was at, and the owners really did have something to be proud of!

Let's not forget the dessert!  On second thought, maybe we should.  First, I didn't care for the presentation.  Take a gander at the photos, and you'll see what I mean.  Second, it wasn't very sweet.  Not even sweet enough.  See that pool of caramel sauce the turon rested on?  I did not leave a single drop on the plate!  Not because it was so delicious, but because the roll really needed the added punch.  Mom already knew it wasn't going to be anything to write home about, just by looking at the offering, but did wait till I took a couple of bites before saying "I should've just bought the ingredients at Mekong and made you those at home!"  My sentiments exactly, Mommy dearest!

Oh, but the pork BBQ!  Run and try some now!

I expected Carson Kitchen to be a little busy based on the buzz, but not a 30 minute wait on a Sunday night.  At least my wife and I were able to get drinks and hang around their outdoor area in the back.  The whole thing was quite an eye opener for me.  Who would have thought even 5 years ago that something like this would be thriving on 6th St and Carson???  Amazing!

The dining area was a little cramped but still maintained a cool vibe.  The open kitchen, bustling servers and unique seating area kind of enhanced the experience.  I wouldn't come with more than a party of 4 until their outdoor and upstairs areas are done.  Our server informed us those areas would be complete in about a week.

I'd classify the fare as "New American".  Kerry and his staff do some really interesting twists.  Their "Wellington Empanada" was a delicious way to start the meal.  I enjoyed their take on the typical empanada crust.  It was light with some crunch and soaked up the excellent sauce on the plate nicely.  

My wife gasped when she saw they offered "Crispy Chicken Skins" and ordered it almost before our server got out the word "hello".  Breaded and deep fried chicken skin isn't exactly clean eating but holy shit was it awesome.  Maybe chicken skin really is the new bacon!  It was a glorious way to swiftly kick my diet right in the balls.  Both of us weren't really big on the smoked honey dipping sauce it came with and opted to use the rich empanada sauce instead.

We shared the "Rabbit Ragu" and the "Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak" done rare.  The rabbit was delightful and the sauce delivered a surpisingly spicy kick.  Thankfully, the spaghetti was made of squash.  I needed some vegetables after my mini guilt trip on the chicken skins :P The steak was a little more medium rare than rare but the sauce and light espresso flavor made up for it.

Can't wait to drink and dine outside next time!

New KoMex location. Same very delicious KoMex food. 

If you haven't tried KoMex yet get down to this location or the original location ASAP. I hated the long almost 1 hr waits at the other location on some days. Yes it's that good. So I'm very happy this one finally opened up. Korean Mexican fusion is an excellent combination. I ordered their Fusion Burrito, my usual order, and inhaled that sucker like I was in a pie eating contest. Why waste time eating 1 yummy thing when I could eat 2 yummy things, didn't do 2 but wanted to. The one thing that you must do is add lots and lots of their hot sauces on anything you get it's a big difference maker but in moderations. I almost ate all 4 of the containers of sauce on my own. It's very good. They should bottle them cause I might want to take some home.

Their fusion tacos, burritos, nachos, fries, etc are served with various meats like spicy pork, pork belly, chicken, and more all come with a Korean/Mexican twist. Even their cheese steak was different, using bulgogi. Check out the pictures and reviews at the original location it will pretty much tell you wassup.

I enjoyed the customer service friendly, complementary chips, salsa, guacamole, fortune cookies, and oranges to end the meal. They were still finishing up construction and decorating, fine tuning things like only cash at the time, 1 out of the 6 menu books at our table was without a menu inside, and temp banner outside but things are looking good. Seems like more space for more seats and even a bar area. I'll probably be back before the weeks over. No I will definitely be back before the weeks over.

Located in the same plaza as BabyStacks Cafe and Hikari SW Buffalo and Flamingo.

Did I mention that they're pretty cheap in price.

Let me preface this review by saying that I take eating pretty damn seriously, especially when I travel outside of my local area.  I "train" for the trip like any athlete would for a big game. I do weeks of research (no, seriously), read reviews, examine menus, even ask friends for feedback just to ensure I compile a more than awesome list of MUST EATS during my trip.

Anyway, with the bevy of gastropubs and burger joints Vegas has to offer, Gordon Ramsay's BurGR wasn't even a speck on my radar.  GRB didn't pique my interest until a friend said they made their burgers with deckle-meat. Deckle-meat..the buttery, fatty, extra marbly outskirts of that delicious ribeye.GRB quickly made it to the top 3 on my hitlist. 

So after having somewhat dieted all day -- told you I took these experiences seriously- I was more than prepared to sink my teeth into one of these burgers. 

The restaurant itself isn't anything notable. Orange-themed and contemporary, down to the silverware. Service was fine, attentive and friendly. 

The menu isn't so lengthy that you would need to spend 20 minutes deciding on an order, BUT all the options appeared so appetizing that it certainly took about 17 minutes to finally come to some decisions. My boo is very steak and potatoes, doesn't deviate much from culinary fundamentals.  He ordered the American burger, added bacon I believe.  Since I knew I would be able to steal a few bites, I got the fresh roasted chili dog. And yes, I did order this a bit for the shock value since I had seen yelp photos of this particular item. Our buddy got himself the farm burger which is something I would have ordered if I wasn't so interested in that hotdog. We also got regular and truffle parm fries.

We also got shakes. Man did we get shakes. If I were to pick only one item off this menu and nothing else, I would get a shake from here. i used to walk all the way to cosmo for a Holstein's shake but the GRB shakes are exponentially better. Like to the umpteenth power.  I got myself the coffee shake with hazelnut pudding, which I killed in literally 2 minutes. I couldn't keep my hands off it. It was a freakish newfound addiction. Our friend got the Oreo and creme brulee shake which was just as sinfully, almost painfully delicious. 

Our food came and the burgers were juicy, rich and what you would expect from the deckle claim. Although since it was thrown into ground beef, it didn't impart a noticeably different flavor.  Burgers were also on the smaller end of the spectrum especially given the higher price point.  My man enjoyed the hotdog more than I did. Other than the hotdog length far exceeding the bun, it wasn't memorable.   The truffle parm fries were piping hot and very generous on the toppings. Wish the fries were cut slightly thinner to lessen their density. 

Overall, we were quite satisfied with our meals.  I may even venture to say that I enjoyed it more than Holstein's.  Dang those shakes really got me.

One of the things you HAVE to do while in Vegas ... eat breakfast.  Whether it is that crazy night or just because you are on vacation.  I'm not normally a breakfast eater, but I do like to eat breakfast while in Vegas.

Service - 5 Stars
Cleanliness - Excellent
Price - $17.58 (includes tax and tip).
Seafood - Yes, smoked salmon
Meats - Yes, chicken, bacon, steak, ham
Vegetables - Yes, salads.
Dessert - Yes
Fruits - Yes
Other - (1) Located in the Paris Hotel, (2) Cash and Credit Cards are accepted here. (3) Try to get the patio seating because it's a great spot to people watch since it faces Las Vegas Blvd.

What was ordered:

Emergen-C Drink ($4.95) - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 stars) - Simply orange juice.  Perfect because it is packed with vitamin C, but also very tasty start for the morning.  The orange juice was served in a flute glass.  The orange juice was not overtly sweet and nicely chilled--yet a bit flat.

Three Eggs ($9.95) - A-Okay (4 Stars) - 3 eggs with your choice of crispy bacon or sausage.  All egg dishes are served with breakfast potatoes (aka hash browns) and toast.  Let me give you the breakfast entree breakdown:

*3 eggs - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - You get your choice of how you want your eggs cooked--scrambled or sunny side up.  I chose scrambled and they were cooked very nicely.  Mmm, tasted so good with ketchup.  I wanted to add some Tapatio (or any hot sauce), but I didn't think they had it and was a bit embarrassed to ask for it.

*Sausage - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - You have a choice of regular or chicken sausage.  I chose regular sausage--you get 2 elongated ones.  The sausages were approximately 6 inches in length and 0.7" in diameter.  The skin were cooked to a beautiful toasty brown color.  The sausage was nothing more than porky heavenly goodness.

*Breakfast Potatoes - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - Approximately 5" x 5" square area of hash browns.  The outer portion was cooked until nicely toasted--with a perfectly soft texture on the inside.  

*Toast - Meh! I had better (2 Stars) - You get two pieces of thick toasted bread--3.5" x 3" x 1.5."  All I can really say is it felt like eating extra large croutons.

The Mon Ami Gabi staff seated us on the patio which is perfect because the weather was nice and we could people watch at the same time.  It is nice to finally relax with the family and have good food.  The food here is good, but was not extraordinary--hence my struggle.  I've rounded up so Yay! I'm a Fan!

You have got to be kidding me!!!

What narcissistic nincompoop came up with this idea?

This has just topped my list of "Most Asinine Restaurants in all of Las Vegas." and my list of "Stay the hell away - far away!" at the same time.

3 people, no drinks, one order of tacos each (4) and a very small Queso Fundito appetizer for $75 - THAT'S SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS FOR A DOZEN STREET TACOS AND BLAND CHEESE!

First off, the restaurant is so cold I was shivering - AND I'M FROM FARGO 'FRICKING' NORTH DAKOTA.

The the Queso Fundito came to the table luke warm, which meant the cheese was already almost solid. We got the one with mushrooms, and they didn't taste bad, but cold Queso Fundito just sucks, period. It came with a spoon, which is absolutely the worst utensil to use when trying to cut semi-hard cheese.

Question: does anyone besides me remember when you could order your entire meal at the beginning and the kitchen would have enough sense to send out the appetizer first and give you some time before sending out the rest? Boy I miss those days. 

We ordered our appetizer, but weren't ready to order the tacos. The waitress kept coming by (without our appetizer) to ask if we were ready, so we politely ordered, hoping enough time had passed that our appetizer could arrive and we could have a few minutes to enjoy it before our small table was overrun by plates.

Boy were we wrong. Not more than 1 minute after the Fundito arrived, I got my tacos - just mine, apparently no one thinks people like to eat together anymore. So now my tacos are getting cold while I try to finish the Fundito before it turns back into a hard brick of cheese. 

The other orders came 5 to 6 minutes apart. These people are completely incompetent.

I will not say the food was bad, but I will say that Pepe's Tacos offers MUCH better tacos at 1/3 the price. 

This place is PURE SHIT, an absolute waste of a great location and an awesome remodeling by Red Rock. I can already see by the other Yelp reviews that most people agree. 

Pay $75 to have some tourist on the Las Vegas Strip slap you three times in the face, it will be a much better use of your money.

What's good enough for Nic Cage is good enough for me.

Have been here twice now, both for lunch.   First time I got take out and did the Parma cold sandwich without cheese.   The guy helping me seemed a little preoccupied during the ordering process, and particularly when I was trying to get my iced tea I'd ordered.   A few minutes later I finally realized why he seemed to be brushing me aside (that's a strong way to put it, he was still friendly).   Nic Cage and his wife and son (presumably) were dining at one of the tables nearby.   Now there was a large part of me that wanted to be the annoying fan and run over and ask for him to do a scene of Bad Lieutenant from Port of Call (youtube this immediately if you're unaware).   Since his wife and kid were with him, I figured that might not be the best idea, so I settled for a scene from the Wicker Man instead.   Okay so I really just sat and did nothing and waited for my food.   When I ate it later at my office, I was greatly impressed.  A plethora of olives, pepperocinis and various italian meats.  I marked it as reason #41 why I will never go to a Subway by choice again and awaited my next opportunity to strike.

Well that came yesterday, when I brought a co-worker with me for a sit down lunch.   I was dead set to try a pasta so I could have a more well rounded Yelp Review (I do it all for you guys).   Unfortunately while looking through the menu I couldn't shake the pics of the italian beef sandwich I'd seen in the pics section on this site.  I asked our extremely friendly and efficient waitress which I should get, the italian beef or the rigatoni and she said she hadn't had the rigatoni but the italian beef is amazing.   I mean she didn't even upsell me the extra $1.75 for the pasta.   Sorry Yelp, but the well rounded review will have to wait.  

To go all 17 year old snapchatter on you:   OMG at this sandwich!!! :) :) :)     Just unbelievably stuffed full of juicy beef, pepperocini and with a healthy serving of lusciously melted cheese.   Then with a big bowl of au jus to dip it in.   I'm used to au jus from lesser quality restaurants being very thin and not extremely flavorful.   Not here.   Thick with beef flavor, because what you really need when shoving your mouth full of 2 pounds of beef on a sandwich is more beef flavor.    And you know what?  That's not all.  I'm pretty sure the bread was garlic bread.   In fact, I'm sure of it because the rest of the day my mouth couldn't shake that garlic flavor and flowers wilted when I breathed on them.    A+

Refills on the iced tea came at a fast pace, and I even inconvenienced our poor waitress by asking for one to go, as well as by signing the wrong receipt on a 50/50 split check because I'm a massive idiot.  She took it all in stride.

I promise, next time I'll try the pasta (and get a creepshot of Nic Cage)

Didn't realize it's been a couple of years since my last visit to Vincitorio's until I decided to have dinner here this afternoon.  Arrived around 530p, and there were maybe one or two tables occupied.  I was seated at the first two-top near the front door, which put me right next to a young woman, and her acoustic guitar, who was to provide the live entertainment that would eventually start at 6p.  Her original work was pretty good, and she took special requests, as well.  (She later told me that she was going to be playing there again the next week.  I hope she's a recurring performer there, bec. I wouldn't mind hearing her voice and her guitar-playing again!)

Tonight's dinner composed of great complimentary buttered garlic bread, a glass of Alois Lageder Riff pinot grigio 2008, and Roasted butternut squash ravioli, which came w/ choice of soup or salad (I chose the latter, w/ blue cheese crumbles and a side of house-made blue cheese dressing).  The salad was very fresh and crisp, and I loved it w/ just the blue cheese crumbles- no need for the dressing!  I enjoyed the bread and salad too much, I think-- I ate almost the whole salad and had to order a second batch of garlic bread!  The roasted butternut squash is one of eight handmade pasta entrees on their dinner menu and comes w/ an addicting four-cheese cream sauce composed of parmigiano, fontina, pecorino, and gorgonzola, which are among my top favorite cheeses!  Now, I will admit that this dish did not make a great visual first impression w/ me (check out the photos), but I knew better than to judge a book by its cover. Yes, it didn't look as appetizing as it could have, but I assure you, the aroma that emanated from this dish was intoxicating, and the butternut squash inside the oh-so-tender ravioli was cooked to perfection!  Its roasted sweetness and the lovely four-cheese cream sauce made a matchless pair!  It was difficult to curb my desire to eat all four pieces...  Mmm... I was in heaven!  

As dinner rolled on, the restaurant started to get quite packed w/ what seemed to be regulars, and it's very easy to see why-- I hadn't finished w/ my meal yet, and I was already looking forward to returning the next week!  (Alas, I am forever in search for other great venues to try, so I postponed my next trip back- Valentine's Day, as it turned out!)

Thank you, Vincitorio's, for a fantastic evening!

Third times a charm? This makes three times I have seen a pizza spot in this location. I stopped in and ordered a "Monday's Special" which is a large cheese pizza for $9.99 and additional toppings are extra. Inside was very busy so I guess others are wanting to this place out too. While I was waiting for my pizza, I noticed they have pizza by the slice for sale. I asked if they could add a slice of Sicilian (cheese) to my order priced at $3.25 and make it to-go. My husband isn't a fan of a lot of sauce on a pizza, but I'm the opposite. I asked for a side of sauce (cost .85 cents) to go along with my pizza for dipping and it and I ended up really liking the flavor. The pizza had a thin crust and the right amount of cheese for it. The pizza wasn't very greasy at all and hubby and I both enjoyed it. The Sicilian slice tasted great and had the crisp crust it should, but I was a but disappointed when I got home and opened the paper bag it was in and it was just on a paper plate inside the bag. They did just open, so it's possible they ran out of to-go boxes, but I hope it's not this way all the time. The Sicilian slice was actually my favorite part. The employees were nice and with the different specials they have going on and the food being decent, I can see coming back.

Most pizza joints have a "slice special" and it has a certain time it runs and sometimes only on certain days. Well, here you can get 2 slices and a drink for $5.50 7 days a week anytime. I thought it was a plus that I could get a slice special for dinner instead of just a restricted lunch time special. Aside from pizza they also have wings, fingers, salads, strombolis, pasta, sandwiches and desserts. They also cater.

Our group got hungry so with the lack of planning, we decided to just go across the street to Johnny Rockets.

FOOD - 1 Star: I ordered:

- Chili Cheese Fries: These were ok. They were really heavy on the chili and the cheese was barely there. It would've been way better to actually have the cheese on the top instead of under the chili.

- Sweet Potato Bacon Cheese Fries: I enjoyed the sweet potato fries myself, but the cheese... if you can call it that... was pretty disgusting. I don't know why they couldn't use real cheese. Instead they used some liquid cheese that you'd find at the movie theater and so it had this weird taste to it. The only thing that kind of saved it was the bacon, but even that was overpowered by the liquid cheese. This ruined my appetite and I had to eat around the cheese, which was almost impossible since it was all over the place.

- Smoke House Single Burger: This was pretty good, but smaller than I thought it would be. Maybe I don't come here often enough, but the burger was small. The taste was spot on. You can't go wrong with a meat patty, cheese, onion rings, and bacon.

SERVICE - 2 Stars: The staff was friendly, but literally only approached us to drop off the menus and to deliver food. No one checked on us at all during the meal. I need an extra fork and literally had to flag someone down to get it.

ATMOSPHERE - 2 Stars: It's your typical Johnny Rocket's setup and my biggest issue with the place was the fact there was no soap in the restroom. I'm glad we had hand sanitizer with us, but that's just gross.

RECOMMENDATION: Overall, I'd say you can skip this place. Go to Capriotti's or Joe's Pizza in the same shopping center instead. You'll get way better food for the money you're paying.

This was one of the best dining experiences I've had.  I've been going to try Twist for awhile and I went there last night for a special meal.  I got the 6 course chef's tasting menu.  I made a reservation for 6 PM, the time they open. I was going to Blue Man Group later and I wanted to have plenty of time for a relaxed dinner and time to get to the show.

David took my order after answering some questions I had about the menu--a menu I had poured over online.  He was a great help.

There were five canaps delivered shortly after.  They're small and they were quite interesting in flavor and execution.  They were in/on three items.  My favorite was the salad of watermelon and dragon fruit, passion fruit, and basil.  A close second was the paprika-tomato meringue with smoked salmon and black olive agar.  The almond and ginger sable was none too shabby either.  All 5 were excellent!

The first course was glazed Skate with red miso water, spring vegetables and Paris mushroom duxelle.

The second course consisted of the 3 small bites--a grilled prawn on spinach velout with garlic and parmesan.  The second bite was a piece of lobster with poached turnip, toasted sesame, and bisque.  The third portion was a cold, soft-boiled egg with Ossetra caviar in the yolk on a bed of marinated clams, red ahi tuna, and cuttlefish.

Course three was Mediterranean John Dory with pink pepper, fine foie gras tart and baby artichokes.

The fourth course was a palate cleanser.  It was a champagne sorbet which had some salted cucumber and a Campari soaked Red Beet.  I was blown away by the cucumber and sorbet combination.  Fantastic!

Course five was Sonoma Valley Duck Breast with Alexia Potato, berries on a piquillo pepper reduction, and Bigarrde sauce.  The duck was excellent and the tart fruit with the pepper reduction--another superb flavor pairing!

The last course was dessert which consisted of 5 different small desserts.  They were a coffee panna cotta with Bailey's, Kahlua, Coffee Gele and lime sorbet.  Almond-Frangipane cake with lemon-Krisch syrup.  A third was strawberry soup with raspberry and basil, and a "Bella Vista" granit.  Then a fresh coconut tartlet with iced coconut, cilantro, and celery curls.  The last was a chocolate ganache.  As with the entire meal, the flavors developed in the desserts was wonderful!  Coconut, cilantro and celery--who would have thought?

Service was excellent all evening, even when things became quite busy.  When my iced tea got low, a server brought me a new glass and switched the two.  I didn't have to ask, it was just done.  A funny example, when things weren't so busy, I sneezed.  Within a few moments, a server was at the table with a box of Kleenex.  Service with a smile and funny!  The same server also brought me a small Mandarin Oriental bag with a copy of all the menu items.  He had heard me mention to one of the servers that I'd never remember all the things.  The server wanted to make sure I had something to remind me.  Classy!

The restaurant is very classy and the view is excellent.  I was there during daylight and dined long enough to enjoy seeing the lights come on along the Boulevard!  I wore a jacket and tie--their website requests that men wear jackets.  Most came dressed with business casual.

Truly a wonderful dinner, about 2 1/2 hours.  It's worth the cost for the chance to try some unique foods in a unique setting with superb service!

WHERE: Located on Tropicana & Decatur.

WHEN: 5pm-3am (dinner & late dinnertime!)

WHY: Have you ever posted "best sushi in LV" topics on Yelp Talk? If so, no need to ask anymore, because this is it!! THE BEST ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI JOINT IN TOWN! WITHOUT A DOUBT!

WHAT: Firstly, we got to test out the new party room! There were 20 of us sushi-eaters ready to devour and take advantage of that AYCE sushi menu! The servers were all dolls! They were extremely helpful (knowing how hectic a large party can be) and us paying separately did not scare them at all. They were well-prepared! COOL points for the staff that night!

So, on to the food! I would just like to state the fact that each dish was made with such perfection! From the many attractive flavors, to the presentation!

SOME THINGS I TRIED:

Orgasm salad: Something a little bit different! The sauce blend had a little tang and zest to it, which actually made the salad.

Pastel roll: shrimp and crab wrapped inside soy paper, shrimp and avocado on top, slightly drizzled with spicy yum & eel sauce on top!

911 roll: To all of you spice-aholics, you need to try this one! I personally thought that I would be able to take some HEAT, but I had to LEAVE THE KITCHEN for this one! After several drinks of water and patiently waiting it out, the spice stuck to my tongue! So, the tip for this roll: BEWARE, AND PROCEED WITH CAUTION! haha

I LOVE BAKED ROLLS! So, I love the fact that they have a handful of great ones!
O.I.D. roll: shrimp & asparagus wrapped in salmon & baked with yumyum sauce! Oh whatt?!!
Baked 428: I had to try this one just because it said baked chicken inside the roll! I have never tried a chicken roll =)
Goyemon lasagna roll: I love japanese lasagna rolls, so I always try it in every sushi spot. & this won my heart over! My absolute favorite lasagna roll of all time!

DESSERT! Oh how I love the end of beautiful beginnings solely due to dessert! So... there are a couple of desserts you may choose from on the ayce menu, (tempura, mochi, etc) meaning you can get as much as you'd like?! There is a separate dessert menu you can choose from as well, where you are only allowed to pick one on there! And on this beautiful menu lay "GREEN TEA CREME BRULEE," which happened to be my pick! =D It was completely marvelous!

Lastly, I would like to give a shoutout to my fellow yelper, Nelson Q., for introducing me to such greatness! You got me hooked, my friend! So hooked that I will be back there next week!

WINNER, WINNER, SUSHI DINNER!

***Avenue B's kitchen turns fresh and high quality ingredients into light dishes that are also flavorful, vibrant and filling; their reasonable lunch prices also make Avenue B a great option for an upscale lunch in Pittsburgh***

Avenue B sits in a neighborhood that kind of reminded me of Silver Lake, Los Feliz or Atwater Village.  The restaurant has a simple caf-like dcor, but there are great touches.  I liked the use of purple as well as the hanging light fixtures--rustic but also trendy.  The restaurant has a great neighborhood restaurant feel to it.

Their lunch menu is reasonably priced and it features dishes inspired from many different cuisines.  There is a Cobb salad and a potpie as well as a Thai-like dish and a banh mi.  I went for one of their modern Asian entrees, which was black sesame crusted salmon served with a salad of seaweed, cucumber, surimi, and mushrooms.  It also came with a sauce of sweet soy and a garnish of carrot and daikon.

The salmon entre seemed like something you would find at a run-of-the-mill Asian fusion restaurant, but it was so much better than that.  The salmon was very fresh and they got a nice crispy crust on it.  The salmon was served medium rare and it was very moist, but it still flaked very easily.  I also liked the great flavor of the black sesame as well as the sweet soy sauce.

The garnish of carrot and daikon was fresh with a light crunch while the seaweed salad was cool, refreshing and flavorful.  I liked the mix of the warm salmon with the cool salad.  It was a very light dish, but it was also a very flavorful and filling dish.

If I were going to nitpick, I would say that the entre seemed very close (maybe too close) to the Asian ingredients and flavors that influenced it.  But when the ingredients are high quality like this (especially the salmon) and they are handled so well, it is hard to complain (5 stars).

I also tried their flatbread, which was topped with cheese, grilled artichokes, prosciutto, and arugula.  This flatbread had a great crust, which is where a lot of flatbreads can go wrong.  It had a great flavor with the right amount of char; it was thin and crispy but also with a little bit of a chew.

The arugula was great--leafy, peppery and nicely dressed in a light vinaigrette (you often get dry arugula on flatbread).  The generous portion of the arugula kind of overwhelmed the small portion of prosciutto, but the prosciutto was good (not dry, meaty and with the right amount of saltiness).

The cheese was good too.  In terms of other toppings, they used the woody part of the artichoke, which wouldn't be my first choice, but it was actually a good contrast to the leafy arugula and it made the artichokes stand out in a good way (4 stars).

For dessert, I went with their blondie, which was filled with pretzel buttercream and garnished with bruleed green apple.  The bruleed green apple was great.  It was reminiscent of a candy apple but with the use of a tart green apple versus the more sweet red apple (the more traditional apple used in a candy apple).  I think the tart apple combined with the sweet crust was great.

That candy apple-like taste made from a technique you often see with crme brulee was kind of eye opening.  And when it was mixed with the sweet and chewy caramel, it became a dessert that felt very nostalgic but also sophisticated at the same time.

The pretzel buttercream was good.  You do get a little bit of a pretzel flavor with the addition of coarsely chopped pretzels though the buttercream did not have a prominent pretzel flavor.  What I liked about the buttercream though was how it was sweet and creamy without being overly sugary like a lot of buttercreams (4 stars).

I also tried their housemade brown butter ice cream and it was great--great flavor, smooth, creamy, dense, and firm (without being hard) - 4 stars.

Service by Lauren was great.  She was personable, nice, knowledgeable about the menu, and very attentive.  The food also came out at a good pace.

Prices for lunch were reasonable.  Most of the entrees were in the $12-$15 range and several of the starters were $8 and below.

Avenue B is a very impressive restaurant that showcases fresh ingredients in satisfying flavor combinations.  There is also a lot of talent in the kitchen as the flatbread and salmon were both perfectly to near perfectly prepared.  All these great things plus Avenue B's reasonable lunch prices make it a great choice for a delicious upscale lunch in Pittsburgh.

Parking is available on the street by meter.  It is not that difficult finding a space during lunchtime.

Best of 2007: Best Downtown Lunch 
Best of 2006: Best Gourmet Pizza

These are just some of the awards that Cibo has won.
Well, this year, Cibo is being awarded its most prestigious award to date. 
And that is the Craig R's Favorite Dinner While Visiting Arizona Award 

Cibo, which is located in a residential neighborhood in Phoenix, is actually an old restored 1913 bungalow. The inside of Cibo has hardwood floors, beautiful stained glass paneling, an all wood bar and a fireplace. Since it was such a warm, beautiful Phoenix evening, my fianc and I decided to dine in the front yard of Cibo, which is covered with tables, Christmas lights and a fire pit. Cibo also has local Jazz bands come in and play live music in the front yard, which gives Cibo a super relaxing and romantic vibe. In fact, this was one of the most romantic evenings my fianc and I have shared in a long time. 

To start out the night we shared their famous Burrata appetizer, which tends to sell out every night. The Burrata consisted of fresh mozzarella topped with a balsamic glaze, black label prosciutto crudo and toasted bread. This app was extremely flavorful and fun to eat. I can see why it sells out almost every night. The mozzarella was really creamy and had an awesome sweet and tangy flavor because of the balsamic glaze. When you combine all the elements of this dish together you get this awesome little sandwich that is sweet, tangy and salty all at the same time.  

Cibo is known for their homemade wood fire pizza's that they prepare with only locally grown organic produce and imported Italian products. Every pizza on their menu sounded amazing so my fianc and I each ordered a different one so we could share them. These are the pizza's we got: 

Diavola- Tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy salami, and Italian sausage 
Tartufata- Mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and truffle oil. I also added Italian sausage and ricotta cheese.  

Both of these pizzas were phenomenal. They were both huge and cooked perfectly so the crust was thin and crispy, with slightly burnt edges. The spicy salami on the Diavola was actually really, really spicy. The tomato sauce on this pie was extremely flavorful too. The Tartufata  was really cheesy since it contained both mozzarella and ricotta cheese. The truffle oil and the white mushrooms that were on this pizza gave it such an amazing taste. 

The service at Cibo was top notch. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive. Since we had never been there before she was very helpful in explaining their menu and giving us suggestions on what we should try and what some of their most popular dishes are. She also always made sure our drinks were always full and that we had everything we needed. 
The prices at Cibo were good too. Their pizzas range anywhere from $12 to $15 dollars a piece, which is great considering how big and delicious they were. 

Whether you live in Phoenix or just visiting like I was, if you're looking for a romantic place to take you significant other then look no further than Cibo.

Let me get right to the point.  I disdain this nightclub.  I'm not typically the "nightclub" type of guy, but I do dance.  PURE, in Caesar's Palace, embodies everything I hate about big nightclubs.

For one, the people that go there, and the employees, are pretentious.  Now, I'm not the kind of guy that has legit game in everyday life. But, hey, sometimes I get lucky!  In a club, however, I have no game.  No "club game," as I like to call it.

This review is not about how I had no game at a club called PURE.  This review is about the compactness of the club, the attitude of the bouncers, and the type of people that typically frequent this club.

I was here for a bachelor party for my buddy, John.  The posse in total reached 12 of us. We were all fortunate to have the groom's cousin -- a generously proportioned gentleman named Louie -- rolling with us.  Looking like an old-school mafia gent, he spoke with the "man in charge" of letting people in.  Whatever Louie mumbled in that person's ear enabled us to bypass a group of overly-bored people in line.  Who knows how long they must've waited to get into this Night at the Roxbury-inspired club, but we got inside in 5 minutes.

Once inside, our $125 each enabled us to get a roped-off, private booth with bottles of Jack, Grey Goose, countless other streams of steady alcohol, and of course cranberry and orange juice.

Apparently, Louie gave the bouncer, who was in charge or securing the booths so that no one came in, some money to bring girls over to party with us.  Hey, cool!  Only, these are not the kind of girls that I would normally talk to in the outside world, and honestly, probably wouldn't be interested in me the type that would be interested in me either.  One of the other groomsmen and myself noticed that some of the bachelor party participants went out and met girls in the dancefloor and bar areas. We thought to ourselves it might be a good idea to do the same.  The whole club scene at Pure is plastic.  I'm not sure if this is the kind of girls this club attracts, or if this is what is necessary for seemingly "everyday-looking" girls to look like to get into this club. 

Our search turned up fruitless until much later in the night. We had met two frualeins who were attractive, and in such attire that would suggest they were as out of place as we two were.  While chatting them up, a third friend joined of theirs joined us.  I asked my fellow Groomsman-in-Crime if he thought it would be a good idea to invite them back to our booth with all the rest of us.  Afterall, some of the other guys were doing it, and there were also the ones that the bouncers just handed over to us like napkins for us to use.

We agreed to ask if they wanted to come over to our booth for drinks.  They accepted our offer and walked with us towards our roped off booth.  Here's where the problem starts, and why the stigma I have towards PURE encouraged me to give my first 1-star review.

I asked the 6'5", linebacker-framed, bouncer if it was ok to bring the 3 girls we met into our booth.  He did the patented looking up-and-down, sizing up of the girls and turned to me and said "No."  

Yes, I knew why he said no. These weren't club-caliber girls. They were pretty, just not very "revealing" in their attire.

The rest of the conversation goes like this:

Me:  Why not?

Big Bouncer:  Because they're not pretty enough.

Me:  Huh? They're pretty to me.

Big Bouncer:  Louie said to bring only pretty girls. I don't think he'd think they would qualify.

Me:  (Not really knowing Louie that well, but felt qualified to speak as if I did)  But Louie would be happy if I'm happy.

Big Bouncer: (Looking at them one more time to see if maybe he overlooked something he didn't catch the first time around)  Bro, look at the girls that are already there.

Me: (Looking at what I already knew. This time seeing boobs nearly hanging out of their tops, and ass cheeks playing "peek-a-boo" out of their short, hiked up skirts.) Yeah. They're just not my type.

-Nearly giving up, I start to ask...-

Well, can I at least fix them some drinks?

I must've score what amounted to a small victory, because he gave me that "I give up arguing with you" look and agreed to my request.  Yes, the drinks that I helped pay for.  What a guy!

As I turn back to address the situation to the girls, I had not realized they were so close behind me.  I sort of knew then that they were close enough to have heard everything.  I asked if they wanted me to fix them drinks.  They politely said they were tired and were going to head home.

Ugh.

Gee, PURE. You managed to screw up the one good thing the night had going for it. I guess if I wasn't rollin' with a posse that included Big Louie and $125 just to get in, I probably wouldn't be Pure-worthy for your nightlcub.

Congratulations!!  Your classlessness and lackluster dancefloor just earned you my very first 1-star review.  Karma's a bitch.

It's sad that I didn't give Kyara a try earlier, as it is merely a few minutes from where I live. Japanese Tapas has always been a little intimidating to me, as I don't really know what I'm ordering a lot of the time. I've been missing out -

The food at Kyara is excellent, as far as I can tell. There is time and effort put into a lot of their dishes, along with quality ingredients. I've now tried nearly a dozen of their different items, though there are still many more to be tried. My favorite at this point was a simple chicken and rice bowl called Tori Meshi. Uncomplicated to say the least, but still very delicious.

The Chicken Garlic Ponzu is also truly tasty. It has strong flavors that jump out at you, but is unique enough that it is intriguing. Another excellent dish was the Yuzu Chili Salmon Salad. The salmon is very lightly seared and the texture of the dish is amazing, as well as the presentation.

Some other highlights so far have been the deep fried cheese, which while straight forward, was tasty and had some nice variety of cheese. Their pork belly skewer is average, while the Negi Ma (chicken and green onion)  skewer was very tasty. The sasami (chicken breast) was not as good, as it really was just a piece of chicken on a skewer. I also tried the bacon mochi skewer, which, while interesting, wasn't necessarily that strong of a combination.

I would probably pass on the potato salad, which really was just that, and the Niku Jaga was good but also just seemed like sukiyaki. Still, there are many dishes that I would like to try.

It is definitely worth noting that their desserts are extremely good and priced very cheaply, in my opinion. The Yuzu Fromage Mousse is really quite amazing, as is the Green Tea Waffle, which is enough for 3-4 people and only costs around 5 dollars.

Service here is a little on the slow side, which is really my only knock on the place. A table was ready and we were asked to sit for a good 5 minutes for no real reason other than they had some trouble keeping up with the crowd. I'm not sure if that's a normal situation, or if they are short one or two servers during the busy hours.

All in all, Kyara is a very good and reasonably priced option for those desiring to try a multitude of Japanese-influenced flavors, and I see myself returning here many times for it's convenience to my location as well as its excellent food.

***We had a large party menu (fixed) at Tao's and that could have contributed to the experience; the food was mediocre with some of the courses being decent, but more of them with a quality and flavor similar to a PF Chang's***

Tao has never been high on my list to try in Las Vegas, but I've definitely heard a lot about it--especially since it is both a restaurant and, I believe, a nightclub after dinner ends.  Tao was also featured on the Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate where Duff Goldman selected their satay of Chilean sea bass as his favorite thing in Las Vegas.

Tao is located in The Venetian and it is a big spot with a dark decor (very loud as well).  Tao's huge menu is very modern Asian or Asian fusion with a wide variety of items including sushi, sashimi, edamame, satay, tuna tartare, hot and sour soup, dumplings, spring rolls, BBQ meats, tempura, wok-fried meat, poultry and seafood dishes, fried rice, and noodles.

Everything was kind of okay, but while a few dishes were noticeably better than what you would get at a PF Chang's, a lot of it wasn't (and Tao carries a much higher price tag though part of that is because Tao is in Las Vegas).  We did have a fixed party menu so maybe more freshly prepared dishes would have stood out more though the flavors were not exciting or memorable.

Service was fine.  The food came out at a good pace.

As mentioned, prices were high for a just okay Asian fusion restaurant.

Tao does offer many different dishes and it brings in a lot of customers to make for a lively atmosphere so if either of those two qualities appeal to you, Tao might be worth checking out.  But if you are looking for high quality food or good value, Tao might not be the best choice on The Strip.

Like other Las Vegas casinos on The Strip, The Venetian offers both free self and valet parking.

As a native Texan, I have a hard time even bringing myself to go to Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas - my palate is honed to Tex Mex, powerful salsas, reasonable prices...

I saw La Comida pop up and decided it would great to try a new place downtown that had what seemed like a relatively authentic menu and great location.  We made reservations for Saturday night and met our friends there - both of us securing rockstar parking (it was early for Saturday dinner) and a half-moon booth inside but right by the open patio.

One of our friends is Mexican and saw huarache on the menu, a childhood favorite.  We were given a mini galvanized tub of warm chips and salsa, which was plain - our friend asked the server in Spanish for the non-gringo salsa which got us a chile de arbol salsa, which was not much better.  Waters were served in mason jars which is cute.

The server did ask before we opened our menus if we wanted guacamole with our chips - my friend immediately agreed - to which we experienced dismay upon opening the menu and seeing it for $11 - and the $11 did not include a tableside guac in molcajete show - but instead a small side bowl that was not much bigger than the mini salsa container.  That was a disappointment - at least do it tableside to charge that much - what I can make for $2 with 2 avocados!

Our table's order was our friends' getting huarache and queso fundido, I ordered the ceviche trio, and Eric R. got the chicken enchiladas with mole.  He was pleased to hear it came with rice and beans.  When the food was delivered, the queso came with tortillas, and Eric got a small plate with his 2 enchiladas (topped with pickled onions), and I got a small plate (see pic) with 3 divided sections with ceviche.  My husband's sad face was attributed to the "communal" rice and beans, which he thought was bizarre since he was not sharing his with anyone.

The huarache had cheap meat, not like the kind our friend expected.  He was a bit disappointed.  Eric R.'s meal was cold - he had an enchilada then sent his plate and the communal beans and rice back to be reheated.  The kitchen was nice enough to give him 2 new enchiladas hot.  Of my 3 ceviches, the snapper one was tasteless (dry fish, pepper, and sliced green and red bell peppers) but the shrimp in a green sauce and the bay scallop with tropical fruit were very tasty.

Overall, it seemed just too expensive for small portions and food that was not memorable.  The only thing memorable is the rip-off guacamole that we were somewhat conned into ordering.  Our server was nice but it took awhile to get our check taken care of though it was not terribly busy at the early hour.  This place will definitely stay popular, so enjoy those $20 margaritas (not kidding) and $7 bottles of XX - no beers on tap.

The Noob's guide to a $20 massage at Bali!

If you guys reading this are like me, you would consider yourself very INEXPERIENCED when it comes to massages in general.  And of course, you've heard plenty of stories about the shady Asian Massage parlors in Vegas LOL.  

Since I am now an expert (jk only been one time lol), I will HELP you out and let you know what to expect!



1)  I showed up with no appointment, but was promptly welcomed and walked to the back.  Maybe during prime time, you might have to wait, but I had NO WAIT on a Thursday around 630pm.  Maybe if you enjoy a particular masseuse, you could schedule an appointment with that person, but since it was my first visit, I only showed up with a dumb look on my face lol.

2)  There are no upsells or uncomfortable requests for additional money.  There were no options, no choices.  No drinks or products to buy.  You walk in for a massage, and you drop a $20 bill on the table on the way out.  Simple and CHEAP...I like that!

3)  I was walked into the back into a large community room with tall cubical-like partitions set up  (BTW, there were places for me to CHARGE my phone).  It is very dark in there, but because it is not a private area, you should probably leave your clothes on, which brings me to my next point :

4)  Wear COMFORTABLE clothing.  I came in with a T-shirt, Jeans and tied tennis shoes, but I should have came in a tank top, shorts, and sandals.  They rub this very low scented lotion pretty much everywhere, so you don't want that crap on your good clothes, as well as them getting rolled up and wrinkled.  Your hair gets all messed up too...don't plan on going out lookin your best when you're finished.

5)  Once you get your area, take off your socks/shoes etc, and relax....maybe put your phone on silent.  My masseuse was there after about 5min with a bucket of hot water for my feet. 

6)  The massage itself : Probably depends on your masseuse for the most part.  Mine was a middle aged lady with a bit of meat on her, and was the perfect "STRENGTH" I needed.  I am a wuss...I don't need anyone breaking my back or gettin super deep-tissue on me, but if you do, ask for it!  As well as once you are on your chair...TELL EM if they need to go easy or harder on ya.

7)  Mine started off with my forehead, hair and scalp, temples, behind the ears (OMG YES!) and then to the neck.  Shoulders, arms and hands were next, to the feet/calves/thighs and then to the back.  I would imagine I could have asked for more or less time in any of the areas, and it would have been acceptable.

8)  My massage lasted about an hour and fifteen from sit down to leaving.  I never noticed her checking her watch, but she kept me BUSY pretty much the entire session.  I felt great right after the massage, and felt a lil beat up the next day.  Nothing crazy, just like a good workout at the gym.

9)  On the way out, she offered water and sat at a bench by the front door to get her tip I presume.  Drop your $20 bill at the front, and then your tip to your masseuse. 

10)  As for the TIP, that obviously depends on your masseuse, your overall experience, and your personal pocketbook.  I won't tell you what to pay, but my experience was wonderful, and I would have personally felt cheap droppin a $5 bill for an hour of hands on work.  I spent $10 and she seemed happy...maybe if it was enlightening, I would have tipped more, but for a great massage, I think $10 was fair.  Still at $30 that's crazy cheap!  I might come here once every week or two!



I know most of this is common sense to the seasoned veteran, but I can't be the only one that has been living under a rock!!

Hope some of this helped the fellow noob!  I know it would have helped me if I would have read this before my first visit :P

Now go get your $20 massage!

I hate to be an asshole, but I hated this place. 

I came here yesterday with a group of friends for lunch. Our 15 minute wait turned into what felt like an hour, when impatient me finally went in to see what the deal was... To my surprise, there was an empty table for a party of 7 that was just sitting there. Are you kidding me? So I ask one of the servers if its cool that we snag it, to which he said Yes. Just cram in tight. NO big deal. So I go and grab my friends to alert them that the table was ready, and when I walk back in, some stupid little bitchy server is standing there glaring at me telling me she "needs a minute to move the table" while huffing and puffing and sighing and just generally being a little queen about having to move a freakin table. I'm sorry, isn't it your JOB to accommodate patrons? I thanked her as she stormed off, and say something shitty to her about being such an inconvenience. I never saw her again throughout the duration of my visit. 

Star removal #1.

We all sit down, and continue waiting for our drink order to be placed. Finally, after about 10 minutes, this happens, but were without menus, so no one *really* knows what they want, Waitress huffs, rolls her eyes, and goes to grab menus. We look, she takes our order, but only for about 6 of the 8 people at the table. She somehow forgot about the tallest man at the table and the girl sitting across from him. Once she comes back, after 3 attempts, she gets the order wrong, serves me my sake without a cup or a glass for my beer. Seriously?

Star removal #2.

We finally order. Mind you, this was the longest lunch in the universe, because at this point we had already been there for an hour. Luckily our waitress got the order correct, except a few of us ended up waiting at least 45 minutes for our rolls to come out.. specifically the Avocado rolls.. did you run to California to grow and pick them yourself because.. wow. 

Star removal #3.

They managed to Eff up the most important part, which was the SUSHI. My unagi was not fresh, the spicy tuna tasted like plastic, they only had smoked salmon, no raw. They waitress *highly* recommended the dessert roll, which was ice cream rolled in rice krispys.. I know that sounds awesome and all, but im here for sushi, not ice cream. Also, on the menus, it says they have the choice to put a grat on ANY size party.. this to me is absolutely absurd.

Star Removal #4

I'm sorry, but when you see a PARTY OF EIGHT slide in, you do everything in your power to make these people happy, because if you don't, you can expect that "We can grat anyone we want" to be the only grat you get. Nothing additonal.

Get your shit together Moto, and maybe remind your waitstaff that their JOB is to make sure your patrons enjoy themselves, not make us feel like a burden. If it weren't for them, this review wouldn't have been so shitty.

P.S. Start to finish, lunch took 2.5 hours. 

FAIL.

Fans of the dramatic misfortunate adventures of RyanC read on...

WikiWiki, whose name creates instant old school rap flashbacks*, catered the recent Tiki Party PBR Concert featuring Fishbone and other cool local acts.
The grilled meat smelled good (although when does grilled meat not) so I stepped up to their little table setup and surveyed a grill full of what looked like flattened chicken thighs and their menu sign which offered a limited selection from their regular menu: 

$5 Chicken 
$7 Beef Short Ribs
or $7 Meat Combo

-all with white rice and macaroni salad.

I ordered the combo.  A few moments later I opened up the styrofoam clamshell the Young Male (YM) staffer handed me.  I'd gotten all rice,and there were in fact two small icecream scooper mounds of glutenous grain, but slapped on top of it was one small piece of chicken, perhaps one very small or half a large deboned thigh, and one small strip of short rib, which had less meat than a steroid-addict musclebound lunkhead's got in his roomy banana hammock.

I extended my hand holding the food back towards him and said "that's all I get?"
Making no gesture towards grabbing the tray at all, he replies matter-of-factly, "that 's how much you get."
After spending a few moments politely describing the larger portions I've seen everyone else sporting and asking for either more food or a discount, YM refuses.
Another patron has arrived and is loose on PBR, so is standing way too close for my personal space comfort, but this means he's heard me and YM talking.  Let's call him Drunken Dirtbag (DDB).  Now, DDB is amused by all of this, but he's also hungry, so he asks YM to rustle him up a Chicken Plate with Mac and rice.  YM doesn't even hesitate, but instantly offers DDB my plate of food, saying "You want to buy this? He doesn't want it anymore so you can just pay him"
I've been holding this food in my personal possession for over 5 minutes now, and although i never spit on it or anything, YM doesn't know that!  Is this even something allowed by health laws?
DDB chuckles heartily but declines, saying he just wants the $5 chicken plate.  "Me too....now", I contribute.
I explain to YM that I will just have to alleviate my feelings of being ripped off by causing him to lose some significant business.  I won't lie or make anything up, I'll just show anyone who steps up to order exactly how much food they can expect for their money, and then they can decide if it's worth it, instead of having to be surprised and disappointed like me.
YM: "Go ahead."    
Game on, this should be fun.  `,8^ )

Actually, it wasn't even working out that well, since more than half of those I showed still wanted to order, but I did get some sympathizers who joined my protest.

My friends were also supportive, letting me be, and checking back in on me after several minutes.  I was getting a little tired of holding onto my principals by this point, when OF, sorry that's the Older Female staffer from WikiWiki, came over with 7 single$ fanned out like a hand of cards, excitedly letting me know, "Okay, here.  You can go now.  Seven dollars. Here."  This was not her coming rushing in to save the situation, no, no.  This was a good 15 minutes after my initial order now.  This was her resigning herself to the fact that I wasn't going to go away, and the night was still young.

I smiled at her, turned around and set my tray on the table, giving YM a snarkily satisfied smirk, and went back to the festivities, proud and bully-ish feeling at the same time.

As far as the restaurant istelf, well, it is run by these grumpy stubborn, non-customer-service oriented folks, apparently so I'm never setting foot in the place, nor ever eating their overpriced, underwhelming food ever again.


*yes, my friend Eric and I really did break dance to that song in 5th and 6th grade.
Jam on it...Jam on it...Jam, Ja-J-J-J-J-Jam on it!

We have dined here many times and brought a guest this time. The atmosphere in the main dining room is very nice as in a warm gentleman's clubby room kind of way. There are great paintings on all the walls including a great one of Mr. Rogers and there are several mounted animal heads high-up on some walls.
  
Their bread and the selection is very good including the pumpernickel and lavash. They serve butter that is some the best you can get. "European-style" Cultured Butter I would say.

From the Bar we ordered a Grey Goose martini with blue cheese stuffed olives perfectly made and the olives were some of the best I have had. The apple martini was weak for some reason but had good taste. With dinner a bottle of Concha y Toro, Marques Casa de Concha 2010 Carmenere went so well with our steaks.

To start I had the Wedge salad that was pretty good for sure right up there with some of the best. The lettuce was appropriately extremely cold and crisp. While the blue cheese dressing was good indeed, it could have been a little stronger of the blue for my own taste, but the tomato wedges and the bacon were outstanding. The Onion soup was tasty with a great topping of oozy melted crusty cheese.  We also had Wagyu Beef Carpaccio that I would grade outstanding.

Specials of the night are always worth a review and discussion with your server. Tonight, one that sounded great was a preparation of wild pacific salmon, but we were here for the steaks tonight.

My dry age strip steak was a very flavorful piece of meat and the tenderloin with porcini sauce and the poached lobster was a super combination, tender and flavorful, decadent perhaps; just great . The filet that we asked to be treated with the Kona was very good. Also at our table we had he porterhouse which was a good size, nicely done and very tasty. To reiterate a bit, we enjoyed good flavor with all the steaks and all were prepared as ordered.

Service, first and last was outstanding. Our server's knowledge was just short of encyclopedic. Everything about everything on their menu and anything about all the food and perpetrations she was able to recite.  She was very professional, fast and prompt in an apparent effortless and smooth manner. Wine she knew all about, yes she did. "Oh I think you would want that wine filtered", so she decanted our wine as her own recommendation for what we had. "Not going to finish the wine; want it back in the bottle", not a problem and immediately it was done. 
They are very busy on the weekends and when we arrived for our 8PM reservation the dining rooms were at 95 percent full. If you arrive without a reservation you might have a chance to eat in the lounge area high tops, bar, or the few tables in the area. 

If you like great dining and great steak and can afford an upscale price; Capital Grill is worth the occasional experience.

My traveling companions decided to go and get pampered at a hotel spa and rely on a trained professional to provide some comfort into their lives, but I nixed that idea because for me comfort comes in the form of good food passing from my mouth to my belly.

I found myself exploring the Cosmopolitan on my own when I came upon this unique second floor restaurant which announced Chinese food in one window and Mexican food in another.  I stopped to study the menu and learned it was exactly what I thought it to be, a restaurant specializing in dim sum, noodles and tacos.

Since I was dining alone I was seated at the dim sum bar where I had a front row seat watching the ladies prepare, fill and fold fresh dumplings (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=zE32BWJoqOAZL4TmaNlT3w) and roll out fresh hand-cut noodles.  I decided to order from both the Chinese and Mexican menus in order to sample the cuisine a little bit better.

For starters I ordered one of two Agua Frescas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=W60P4p4WhAKZMHqhVyGHmw) available at the time choosing one made of blood oranges and pomegranates.  From the Dim Sum menu I selected the Sui Mai Scallops made up of ground pork, bamboo, mushrooms and peanuts and the Har Gau which combined shrimp and pork belly in its filling.  From the Tacos menu I selected an individual Carnitas taco and the Pescado Frito taco.  I agreed to have my selections brought out as they were prepared.

The Pescado Frito (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=8cIp34h9uM_xmdh4LajsUg) taco arrived first.  On paper this was supposed to be fried fish and a Mexican salsa, but the fish I had inside my taco certainly didn't seem fried.  No matter its preparation I liked it as the flaky fish was bursting with flavor and hot juices running amok.  This was a very simple but very good fish taco.

The Carnitas taco (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=9WJy0kQq33M7dBVaCtAbNw) was up next.  This was braised baby pork, creamy guacamole, chicharrones and lime at its best.  When the server told me this was her favorite it took me just one bite to understand why.  If I really wanted to pig out I could have easily devoured another three of these.

The dim sum were served in individual bamboo steamers with the lids left on until I was ready to enjoy.  This helped keep the little morsels hot and steamy while I worked on my tacos.

I had the Har Gau (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=ugVecr8s4E13Ak4f0t3P8w) first.  These were quite unique as there was actually a pocket of broth inside the chewy, translucent shell much like what is usually experienced with xiao lung baos.  The shrimp was so fresh it was crunchy and while I didn't notice anything special with the added pork belly the juicy har gau was delicious enough to stand on its own.

I saved the Sui Mai Scallops (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog?select=OG_yUcneFS9wu0I9ejqQLg) for last.  These were easily some of the most eye-appealing sui mais I've ever had topped with a bit of tobiko and some micro greens.  In terms of flavor and originality it was another winner.  The soft peanuts mixed in with the pork and the mushrooms gave these a very pleasant earthiness.  I enjoyed each one slowly, and stayed in my seat contemplating the delicious food I just sampled until it was time to meet up with my friends again.

Uh, guys, I won't be joining you for dinner tonight.  I'm stuffed!!

I had this place bookmarked after seeing several delicious looking pictures being posted on yelp. Hubby and I decided to come here for dinner and we left full and satisfied. The beer here is brewed on site and has won several awards at the Great American Beer Festival and The World Beer Cup. Did I try any beer? Nope! Another visit I will though ;)

We sat in a comfy booth in the dining area. Our server was very nice and checked on us often and went over any questions we had. The menu had so many good choices so hubby and I decided to pick out 2 different things to share. We ordered the "Buffalo Chicken Wrap" priced at $10 and the "South Side Cheese Steak" priced at $10 with a $3 up charge for the substitution of onion rings instead on fries.

Buffalo Chicken Wrap - The chicken tenders are handmade and tossed in hot sauce then put into a tortilla with lettuce, tomato and chipotle ranch. I asked them to leave the lettuce out. The chicken was all white and cooked perfectly. The whole wrap would have been good to me if the hot sauce wasn't on it. It wasn't hot at all and tasted like straight up vinegar. The portion was great and the fries that came with it were delicious. I asked for a side of ranch to dip my fries in and the ranch was cold, thick and delicious. Hubby thought the wrap was OK, but this isn't something I personally would order again unless is was minus the funky vinegar flavor. 

South Side Cheese Steak - This has beef with peppers, mushrooms, and onions, with their our own signature beer cheese sauce. This sandwich was just delicious! The steak was tender and flavorful, the peppers and onions cooked just right and the beer cheese sauce makes this sandwich a match made cheese steak heaven! The onion rings were beer battered and yummy! I could easily just eat a plate of the onion rings!

Happy Hour is daily from 4 - 7 pm. HH is only available in the beer garden, loft and lounge according to their menu.

While there we noticed a promotion for "Slot August Nights" where you can stop in and enter to win a 1966 Ford Mustang! You can enter at their other locations Magoos, Loose Caboose, Golden West and of course here at Chicago Brewing Company. Just ask your server for details.

Thomas Keller is known for being a freakin' genius and since French Laundry is super expensive, Bouchon is a more cost-effective way to taste Chef Keller's masterpieces. 

So, I dragged 17 of my closest relatives here to experience one helluva breakfast! Many in my family, by the way, think IHOP is the best breakfast place on earth...*groan* *eyes roll* I hoped this place would give them an eye-opening, revelatory, perspective-altering dining experience!

FOOD (And yes, I sampled ALL these dishes):
Moules au Safran et a la Moutarde ($25.50) - WHOA. Mussels and fries for breakfast??? Oh hell yeah! I HAD to try it! Fries were cooked and salted perfectly. Tiny mussels steamed in white wine, mustard, and saffron...so tasty, so fresh! After the mussels were devoured, I wanted to grab the egg-shaped metal bowl and gulp down the remaining liquid. The white wine in that liquid was so distinct! Don't worry, I didn't lose my composure, I subtly used my spoon to enjoy the leftover yumminess.

Breakfast Americaine ($22) - This was served with two eggs any style, bacon, sausage, and toasted brioche. It also came with your choice of breakfast pastry, juice, and coffee. The most memorable thing about this dish was the surprisingly delicious strawberry croissant that didn't even look like a croissant. It was actually kind of ugly, but when I put a piece of it in my mouth...HOLY MOLY! I was surprised by how tasty it was! Warm, moist, sweet, with a hint of strawberry; soft and crunchy at the same time.

Bouchon French Toast ($12) - Brilliantly executed! A French toast cylinder with layers of bread pudding, brioche, custard, and apples. So light! so sweet! So moist! So nice to look at, I almost didn't want to eat it!

Gauffres ($12) - Waffles with fresh strawberries, sweetened with maple syrup and vanilla butter. Light, sweet, crunchy! Oh yesssss...

Les Oeufs ($13) - Nothing impressive. The scrambled eggs and country sausage were decent. The toasted brioche was good after I covered it with the made-in-house strawberry jam. I am not a fan of fruit preserves, actually I hate them but this strawberry jam was excellent. The potato croquettes were alright. Christopher C said they were good with ketchup.

Cinnamon Oatmeal w/Candied Orange Peel & Raspberry Puree ($7) - Bland but it was served in a cute little metal bowl. The raspberry puree was so subtle I could hardly tell it was there. And where was the candied orange peel? I couldn't see or taste it. The raspberries on top added a little flavor. It was a little better when we added the small cup of brown sugar that was included. We experimented and added some strawberry jam and oatmeal was way better!

Pecan Sticky Bun ($4.25) - Oh myyyyyy! Topped with crunchy pecans, this bun is very sticky, very sweet, and very good!

Hibiscus Champagne Cocktail ($12.50) - I ordered a mimosa but when they brought it, I saw this drink on the tray going to another table and I had to have one too! What a pretty cocktail! The hibiscus was fun to eat! When a person says no to this champagne, they say no to life!

SERVICE:
We had two waiters all to ourselves. We didn't wait too long for our drinks & food but they seemed to disappear after our food was served. It was hard to flag down our waitress when I wanted another champagne. Also, it took a while for my dad to get his coffee refilled.

I was proud of my family for being adventurous and trying something other than Ihop or McDonald's for breakfast. Even though we didn't get stellar service, they enjoyed their breakfast here. I sure LOVED it! After eating top quality food at this restaurant, I would love to eat at French Laundry. Hmmm...I might have to wait to win the lottery.

I've recently fell in love with French Cuisine and had the chance to endure great flavors from a cozy, cottage-like, French restaurant in the heart of downtown Scottsdale, Arizona.

I had made rezzies at Petite Maison via Open Table on Yelp. Parking is on the street or their nearby parking lot. As we walked up to the hostess' table, she was able to show us to our seats. Although the restaurant offers outdoor patio dining, we opted to dine inside to experience dining in this cute, kitschy restaurant.

*ESCARGOT ($11 for 6 pieces, **3.5 STARS**)
I was expecting to shell out the escargot from it's shell! But actually, the escargot was already pulled from it's casing and baked within an individual baking dish full of melted butter and seasonings. The dish was served piping hot (especially the plate itself) along with two slices of warm, toasted baguette. The escargot was delightful, rich and tender. The warm buttery sauce it was baked in, encapsulated every crevice and gave a lot of oomph to the escargot itself. Definitely a dish worth trying! I kinda wish though I had the fun of shelling out the escargot from it's shell, but at the same time I'm kinda glad I didn't have to get down and dirty for it! 

*FOIE GRAS ($18, **4 STARS**)
Was OMG! Mouth-watering, delicious and worth every penny! For those of you who are unfamiliar with foie, it's duck liver fat. The French would feed the ducks corn (in this case we knew the ducks were free-range and came from a decent place). The foie gras was seared and tasted like it was a piece of steak! As you cut into a piece of the seared foie, you got a piece of fat, which glistened within the light. Add a piece of the paired cranberry chutney, cider glaze and savory donut, this dish was mesmerizing! I do concur that it's worth ordering as this dish is what the restaurant is known for! GET 'EM!!!! 

*BOULLIABAISE ($33, **3 STARS**)
A saffron base sauce was made with fresh mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops and halibut. The seafood was cooked quite well and everything was tender. The seafood was fresh! The base of the sauce was simple and not too salty. Not the best nor the worst, but pretty decent in my humble opinion.

*POISSON ($28, **1 STAR**)
A seared piece of halibut was cooked well. I liked that there was a nice "sear" within the fish and it was light and flaky. The only downfall to this dish is that the lobster risotto was not executed correctly. First and foremost, the risotto was so soupy that it wasn't thick in consistency as risotto should be. In addition, after one bite of the risotto, it was quite grainy - as if the rice was not yet cooked!!!!! After flagging down our waitress, she apologized for the mistake and was embarrassed for such a thing happening. 

The dish was sent back to the kitchen to be corrected. After several minutes, the risotto was served. Not only did it taste slightly better, BUT it was still grainy because the risotto was not cooked well..... AND it was still soupy! Unfortunately, it was the risotto that had made the halibut a lackluster as it was not paired well together. I didn't want to embarrass the waitress again and send back the dish, but accepted it as what it was. 

Service (**5 STARS**) was phenomenal from our waitress. I liked the fact that she shared recommendations of what to devour since it was our first time visiting the restaurant. She even shared a few corny jokes, which made our evening fun despite the risotto fail. She apologized sincerely for the mistake and was happily to correct the error. 

Overall, Petite Maison is a decent French restaurant in Scottsdale, Arizona. But I've had better French food in Portland, that this place doesn't really compare! If I were to come back to Petite Maison, I would probably only order the FOIS GRAS again. I had heard their dessert is good as well. Maybe my taste buds are spoiled by Portlandia, BUT for what it's worth, Petite Maison is A-OK in my book!

Yaaay! I'm always excited when I get to write a one-star review! Trust me, it is NOT often that I write a one-star, you have to be truly horrendous to get a one-star from me. Well, truly horrendous is the perfect description for Emperor's Garden. 

Firstly, I didn't pick the place, my traveling book club met there. Being Asian, I tried to be open-minded about it, as none of my Asian Yelpie friends seem to dig this place. I  was pleasantly surprised when I walked in to see it wasn't Americanized at all, actually it's smack in the middle of Chinatown, and the place is just as run-down and stinky as the rest of it (this is not an insult)!

The place was packed with Chinese people, a tour company had taken over the place for dinner. Why would Chinese people from China would want to eat here? I have no idea. Maybe the horrendous service reminded them of home? 

The food was mediocre to bad. The highlight of the night was the eggplant, it was decent. I got the combination fried rice, which was bland and simple, cooked more in the true Taiwanese style than the American style. I tried the Seafood Lo Mein, which was decent, again bland, as authentic lo mein is, but not enough seafood. Nothing about the food wowed me, 3-stars at best. 

The one-star is because of the horrible service. The place has a full bar and someone in my party mentioned that house wine was $2 a glass. What a deal! She had even mentioned it to the waiter, specifically asking if the glass was $2, and he mumbled something like, "yes, we have it, but it's $3." The other lady at my table said, "I would like the $5 glass of wine, NOT the house wine." Soooo...  the wine comes, and just for fun, everyone tried the $2 wine (I swear it was the two-buck chuck they sell at Trader Joe's) then we tried the $5 wine. IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME! But we laughed it off. We were having fun and the lady didn't seem to mind paying the extra $2.

The bad service came when we got the bill. They charged everyone $5 for a glass of wine. When we complained, the OWNER said that's the price and we have to pay. WTF??? We even pulled up the website to show that the house wine was $2 and we specifically asked when we ordered. The OWNER said that it wasn't her website and she would not honor the price. LOL. Well, the address was the same? The name of the restaurant was the same? I guess someone with a huge vendetta against this place took it upon themselves to make a fake website and sell glasses of wine for $2. HAHAHA. What a bunch of bullcr@p. And the OWNER was getting nasty about it, she was so upset we weren't going to pay the extra $2! Her restaurant was packed, we just rang up a $200 bill and she was upset over the $2! 

So we did what every vindictive 'Murican does, we took it out of the tip. LOL. Duuuuh... The OWNER then had the audacity to tell us if we come back, we can have a free dessert. Uh... no. 

They also padded our bill with things we didn't order, like bowls of rice and something else.... but they promptly took it off. 

Overall.... just a miserable experience in a stinky rundown place. Will not come back.

Spraggle!!!  You heard me right, the food at Echo & Rig is spraggle!  This is one of my favorite spots for the $$!  I have been here a few times now and each time I have been completely satisfied with the excellent quality they consistently put out and the reasonable price.  I'm not saying that it's my favorite steakhouse, but again, for the money, it is certainly one of the best around!

They are a butcher and a steakhouse.  This makes for a unique feel as you enter, but there's more... The steakhouse means that they have several regular cuts of meat on their menu all the time...the butcher part means that you can order from the shop to-go...but it also means that several additional cuts are available routinely that are not on the menu but sold per ounce.  Steaks are seasoned well and cooked beautifully.  I would not hesitate to order with confidence any cut that you fancy on or off the menu.

The real standouts for me are the small plates.  They have 30 different veggie and small plates that range from $5.50 - $9.30.  On this list you will find such taste-bud copulations as Grilled Octopus w/ Gigante Beans, Bone Marrow Carne Asada, Maryland Lump Crab Cakes, Asparagus & Fried Egg, and their now famous Portobello Fries w/ Aioli...start with these, then venture out to the Sweetbread Nuggets, Steak Tartare, Brussels Sprouts, and Mussels Mainiere...Looks like I need to try more of their veggies next time!

If you are here with a group of 6 - 8 you might want to see what Ribeye Tomahawks they have (or if you happen to eat on your own like a Thunder Cat.)  This cut receives nice flavor from the bone and marbling, and slices up nice to share.  All of their steaks come with the option of the following sauces: Blue Cheese, Red Wine Demi, Green Pepercorn, Bernaise, Charred Onion, Horseradish Cream, or Lemon Chimichurri...I'm a succker for the more traditional Bernaise.

E&R is a great place to take a date and share some of the small plates...or come with a group and order by the ounce!  Did I mention that they don't have a corkage fee here?...well they don't, so bring in your favorite bottle of vino.

They also have some incredible looking Happy Hour prices, but I have not sampled any of these options. I have however tried the wonderful boutique hand creams in the restrooms, and I'm a fan!...hey Echo, let's keep some hand towels in there though ...2 out 4 times you've been out...

Come here for remarkable food for the price point!
Come here with a group open to sharing and trying a lot of options!
Come here for fancy hand creams in the bath room!
Come here and close-the-place-down drinking wine at the bar while conversing with the most stunning woman you know!
Come here for a trendy date spot with a modern distressed interior!
Either way...you should come check it out!

Who doesn't like secret gardens?  Especially secret gardens that are lovely, romantic with food that is charmingly delectable!   You don't even feel like you are right next to a large city with a farm and South Mountain as a backdrop.  

I made a reservation on the patio because my sister was in town from the Bay Area and I knew she would want to enjoy our warm AZ weather and watch the sunset.  Honestly if you are coming here I would just sit outside, the house is cute, but the patio is much better.  The server placed us in a perfect spot shaded by palms overlooking the koi pond and not far from the fire!  Gentlemen, talk about a place to bring a hot date, would definitely set the mood for me!  But, it was also perfect to laugh and catch up with the sister too!  

We ordered a cheese board to start and a bottle of Salneval Albarino to cleanse the pallet!  I HIGHLY recommend the Cypress Grove Midnight Moon cheese!  I am not even a cheesy kind of person, but I could eat a whole wheel of that stuff.  

This is going to sound funny, but I came to this lovely restaurant with a big black/purple/blue/violet eye-cheek from an accident and trust me for the last 2 weeks I had been getting domestic violence and thug looks from various 'service providers'...  Well our waitress Megan didn't even bat an eye at my whacked face and my glorious bruise was even on her serving side!  So extra bonus points for that, which is why I rounded my 4.5 star rating up to 5 instead of down to 4.

So after asking our poor server a million questions about the menu, because it is really hard to decide, as everything looks good and unique, we finally ordered.  I opted for the seasonal house special: hand made ravioli.  It was a spinach ravioli topped with an interesting lemon cream sauce, with almonds on top.  The raviolis were delicious, the sauce was quite good, and the almonds brought it all together.  I think I was expecting a little bit more POW to the dish, but it was still very unique and delicious.  

I have to say my sister chose the right dish!  The New York strip with Red Chimichurri Sauce is AMAZING!  The thing they don't tell you on the menu is it comes in a corn puree of sorts that is mouthwatering!!! See picture.  It sounds weird to go with a steak, but it completely made the dish and set that steak apart from your typical steak at a nice restaurant.  I was actually trying to talk my sis into one of the other dishes and she trumped me...I am glad she did!!  

The corn puree sauce was so good we asked the server what was in it and she said she would ask the chef who was in house.  She wrote the recipe on a note for us!! Sorry I promised not to divulge her secrets.  But the last ingredient was cute:  Love :)

If you are skimming just do the following:  Sit on the patio, select Cypress Grove Midnight Moon cheese on the cheese board, somebody order the steak.  You will come back for more and if you are on a date you will get lucky!

After an evening of nonstop Vegas-style partying, the only words I managed to utter from my dry raspy voice the following morning was...water please!!!

In addition to replenishing my body with much needed liquids, I was feeling mighty peckish, as well!  After much deliberation, our group decided on a calm & relaxing sit down Saturday brunch at Thomas Keller's Bouchon. 

Located on the 10th floor inside the Venetian, the restaurant embodied what I've come to expect from a fine French bistro. The vibe was chic & refined yet relaxed and unfussy.  There were comfortable banquettes throughout the main dining area as well as outdoor seating in the patio area. We were subsequently seated inside. At 12:00pm, the sun was beaming from the patio, so our location filtered the intense light perfectly, which suited me and my solar sensitive eyes just fine. 

Complimentary house made jam was magnificent! The jam is freshly prepared each day and depending on the chef's mood, a different flavor variety is served. Today, he was feeling strawberry, which is my personal favorite! They served us an Epi baguette to share and it was fantastic, as well. Warm, buttery crust with perfectly chewy texture. Coupled with the soft butter and sweet pucker inducing jam, it was a match made in the stars.

The entrees were orchestrated perfectly as we didn't have to wait long at all.

Chicken n waffles - The waffles were made with bacon n chives and sourdough batter. It was airy and crisp with a lightly sweet flavor and a savory finish. It was so good i almost forgot to use the syrup!
The chicken was roasted perfectly and it was insanely moist & tender! The chasseur wine sauce was rich and flavorful with an alluring aroma. Some of my guests enjoyed the savory flavor so much they poured the irresistible sauce over their waffles, too!

Pork belly was fatty and incredibly flavorful and juicy.  Accompanied by the creamy hollandaise sauce, it was absolutely delicious!

Corned beef hash was phenomenal! Well seasoned pieces of corned beef mixed with all the traditional fixins that will impress any die hard corned beef hash purist!  Trust, this was far from canned! 

Short rib was tender, the fontina cheese was fragrant and the whimsically tiny jingle bell peppers added a pleasant little kick to this fantastic dish!

Beignets were served fresh out of the oven but they were quite dense and tasted more like doughnuts IMO Overall, they were very moist and with the added raspberry preserve filling, they added a sweet finish to our savory entrees.

Our service throughout the meal was very consistent with coffees, water, and juices always filled to the brim.

By the end of the meal we were absolutely stuffed!  But I didn't mind at all :D

My friends and I had a wonderful time and it was great feeling totally replenished and revived with good quality food that was masterfully prepared with fantastic service to boot. The strong coffee didn't hurt either!  I'm not quite sure if this particular location was ever awarded a Michelin star but IMO Thomas Keller deserves praise for a dining experience that was unpretentious, comforting and very enjoyable!

When we all left, I was sated, 100% refreshed and ready to take on the world, well at least another round of partying :) 

Hey, it's Vegas for crying out loud.

Happy Eats!

Why the drastic change from 5 stars to 2 stars? Two words: customer service. With so many nail salons in the Valley, I choose mine based on customer service. If I am paying $70+ for a gel manicure and a pedicure, I like to choose a salon with friendly staff who welcome me through their doors and who treat me like they want me to be here. Unfortunately, this was not the case during my most recent visit to Ocean Spa and Nail. 

I live in the Old Town area, but I would drive 20 minutes to Ocean Spa and Nail because I liked the extensive massages they give during a pedicure. Sadly, will no longer do this drive to visit them. I arrived and asked for a pedicure and gel manicure. With the gel, it's hard to find the regular nail polish colors that match the gel colors and I (like most other women) like my toes and finger nails to match. I asked for the gel colors first so I could figure out that color and go from there. The girl gave me four palates of colors. I spent a solid 10 minutes looking at the colors and comparing the gel to the toenail polish so that it would match. I even asked a fellow customer for her opinion. After ten minutes, I decided on my gel and toenail polish color -- they matched perfectly. Let me note that during this time, the girl working the front desk was there the entire time and had handed me the palate for the sole purpose that I would match the two colors (nothing is worse then toes one shade of pink and fingers another). 

After my research, I headed to the pedicure chair. I asked if they could do my gel at the same time but they said no. Because of this I knew I was in store for a long visit. The pedicure took a solid hour and I wish it was a little quicker. The massage was way more intense than I remembered and it actually hurt at times. It was not the pleasant experience I had gone through before. But regardless, I had a nice pedicure and was ready to move on to my gel nails. Here's where it gets sad. 

When I moved over to my gel nails, I was given a new technician to do my nails. He asked me what gel color and I told him #60 from the palate because it matched my toes. Coincidentally enough, the friendly fellow customer who helped me choose the color was sitting next to me at this point. After five minutes of searching and bringing back the wrong color several times, the tech came back and said they didn't have the color I picked out...now remember, I specifically chose from the palate the girl handed me and she was standing there the entire time, yet failed to mention that they were out of the color I picked. So here I am with finished and polished toe nails that are supposed to match my fingers, but now they are out of the finger nail polish I picked. 

Instead of being apologetic and helpful, I got reprimanded by the tech. Yes, reprimanded. He scolded me saying that I should have picked out my gel polish first and it's my fault that my nails are not going to match. I tried to explain to him that I had picked out my gel polish first and the fellow customer who had helped me also jumped in saying I had done just that. But instead of backing down, he continued to scold me and be rude to me saying I should have picked the color from the bottle. I told him I wasn't given that option and the front desk person gave me the palate of gel colors to choose from, never once telling me they were out of the color I chose. But again, he didn't apology and move on, he continued to reprimand me and treat me so rudely that the entire salon got quiet and the girl next to me told me how bad she felt for me that I was being treated the way he was treating me. 

I've been to nail salons before where I know they are talking about me while they work. It's what you get by visiting a Mom and Pop shop nail salon. However, I've never been so rudely treated during my "what's supposed to be" a pleasant visit. The tech wouldn't back down and then rudely kept picking out orange colors for my fingers even though my toes were pink. I kept trying to tell him the color was off and he was so upset and mean throughout the entire process. I finally had to just go with a color that didn't match and he started to work roughly on my fingers. At this point, I was so shaken up and mortified at the way I was treated, that I told him to stop and I would get a manicure somewhere else. He said "fine you're done." It was awful. I didn't want to write this review, but it was such a horrifying experience that I feel that I must. As I was paying for my toes (which smudged because they took the toe holder off too early and made me walk with wet toenails), the girl who witnessed everything told me again how sorry she was I experienced that. I never thought a visit to the nail salon would ruin my day, however, now I am writing this without a manicure, with smudged toe nails and with bruised feelings.

Many of you may wonder why I have not been writing as many reviews lately.  Well this is it....I've been saving up to go to craftsteak...not an easy feat on a yoga teacher's salary.

What is the result? I have two words for you: Monkey Bread.

Oh yeah, that's right.  You thought the two words were going to be steak related? Maybe "Skirt steak"? Or "short rib"? Or "Rib eye"?  Ok, that last one is really only one word, but I couldn't think of an amusing third.

NO. You're WRONG.  Where is it at here? Dessert and sides.

Don't get me wrong.....the steak is amazing.  And perfectly cooked.  I had the filet as part of surf and turf, and chose scallops as my surf item.  But really, we've all had an amazing steak and an amazing steak is what you would expect from a place with "steak" in the name.

The great dessert, however, was a complete shocker.   I believe I even offered to have babies for the pastry chef, which I hoped would get me an introduction, but instead only got me a "you're a creepy customer" giggle.  Oh well.

The ambiance here is pretty good EXCEPT the chairs are horrible.  Really REALLY horrible.  Luckily we were not seated at a center table and instead had at least one side of the table that was up against a bench because my poor baby bro who just had back surgery would have never made it through the night in that chair.  The music was also a little off for me....slightly loud country-ish stuff.  I like country; it just seemed a little out of place here.

Service was beyond great, and all of the servers very quickly realized that we were the "nice" kind of customers and were chatting with us and showing us adorable baby pictures.  We actually had two people waiting on us plus another two bus boys filling up water, and my water glass was never empty.  That alone is quite a feat because I drink water like it is going out of style.

In a place like this I always ask the opinion of the waitstaff and they were very happy to guide us toward some amazing choices.  The yukon gold mashed potatoes were so tasty; not too salty, very creamy and buttery and flavorful.  We also had the mixed mushrooms which, when stacked with a small piece of steak, piece of onion, and a dollop of potato made for one of the most perfect bites I have ever eaten.

The scallops were also amazing but the lobster was a real surprise.  The best lobster I've had has not been in steakhouses....it usually seems to be on the beach after being freshly caught and after I am freshly inebriated.  But this lobster was off-the-charts good. So of course the lobster bisque was great as well.

The breakdown:
Service: 5 stars
Chairs: 0 stars
Music: 2 stars
Yukon Mashed Potatoes: 5 stars
Mushrooms: 5 stars
Lobster Bisque: 4.5 stars
Roasted Red Pepper Salad: 4 stars
Lobster: 4.5 stars
Scallops: 4.5 stars
Filet: 4 stars
Monkey Bread: 10 billion stars. 

Complicated computer calculation outcome: 4.483 stars

I will likely never be able to afford to come here again after dropping more than 300 bucks for all of the above plus a half a bottle of wine...but that is ok.  I still have the memories.  And for at least another 12 hours, the leftovers in the fridge.

Training is not a four letter word.  Some of your employees need more in depth training.  More on that later.

We stopped in here on the way home last night because I had seem some Facebook posts by SkinnyFATS that were quite enticing and I wanted to give the new location a try.  

First the food.  I ordered a Doggy Style for myself and a Mac-a-briochious for my wife.  I got truffle fries with mine and garlic fries came with the other.  The FB posting describes the Doggy Style this way:  a tempura bacon wrapped Hebrew National hot dog, tempura jalapeos, spicy cheese, sauerkraut, diced tomatoes, onions, and rouge Dijon.  It was very good.  The highlight for me was the tempura jalapeos.  They were more tempura than anything else on the plate.  

My wife's Mac-a-briochious is described this way:  a garlic brioche stuffed with macaroni, creamy marinara, pepperoni, mozzarella, and basil, served with garlic parmesan fries.  She really enjoyed the man and cheese in the brioche and the garlic fries that came with it.  She described a good garlic flavor in both the brioche and the fries.  We also got an iced tea for each of us.

The food was outstanding.  The training needs work.  Here's that story.  I waited behind some folks who were studying the menu.  They told me to go ahead.  At the register, the young man advised me when he finally looked up that the line was behind me in a loud enough voice that the people who told me to go in front of them heard him and explained they had told me to go.  "OK, what do you want?" was his next statement.  I ordered the Doggy Style and theMac-a-briochious.  He didn't know the prices nor what the meal included so he reached over to a digital photo viewer on the counter and manually ran the photos one at a time until he could get the price of each item.  Then he went through the photos a second time to see what was included with each.

He gave me the total of $26+ and I handed him two $20s.  He then looked at me and said, "It's $26+."  I just stared at him and he looked at the money and then said, "Oh, you don't need to give me any more."  As I was getting my wallet back out to put my change, he told me I had given him enough, I didn't need to pay more.  Duh!

At the beginning he asked what the number of the table was where we were sitting.  I pointed to where my wife was seated.  After the payment, he gave me a number for the table so the person delivering the sandwiches would know who got what.  Duh #2.

They have the same salt and pepper shakers as the original location.  Perhaps some have walked away with people who think they're cute.  There was no salt or pepper on our table.  I looked at adjoining tables and there was none there either.  I got up and got one from a table at the end of the row.  The salt was empty.  We had to ask two servers for a new shaker before we finally got one.  

SkinnyFATS, I like your creativity and how your food tastes.  Get your act together at this new location.  Training is not a four letter word.

The ramen scene continues to grow. Yes Monta Chaya, Monta's sister restaurant is the latest joint to open up. I've never tried their restaurant in Chinatown but I know it's very popular with both locals and tourists. So I was excited that they opened here in Henderson.   From the parking lot you won't be able to spot it but It's located between Japan Creek and Golds Gym in the strip mall on the corner of Eastern/Serene.  The sign for their storefront will be up soon according to one of the servers I spoke to. 

As with the other noodle houses, this place has sit table service. Your hostess will seat you at a table or counter. I chose their counter on this visit. Their furnishings reminded me of West Elm type stuff. The dark woods used makes the place look more stylish and gives it a more upscale feel. The seating arrangement didn't feel too crowded.  My server said they were so busy right before I came and that the lunch crowd had just left.

Server gave me 2 menus one with noodle  dishes and entrees and another that Monta Chaya serves exclusively. So you know I just had to try something off the Chaya Dishes menu.  I chose Chashu Bans (bahns). This one was glazed pork belly slice in a steamed bun. They come as 2 appetizer sized portions.

The Tonkatsu Ramen I ordered is just broth and noodles. I chose to customize with add ons they had. So there is an additional charge for them.  So keep in mind your order can add up. 

There was little wait from the time my order was taken to when I was served. When my order for the Tonkotsu Ramen came up, oh boy, I wasn't expecting such a huge bowl packed with noodles. My extras that I added were soft boiled egg and corn so my bowl was pretty full. 

The noodle soup was really good. The pork had just enough fat, the broth was savory. I personally thought it was just a tad salty and not as rich in flavor as the Tonkotsu broth over at the noodle house on Tropicana.  Still I enjoyed my bowl of ramen.  I asked if there is a smaller portion since this was way too much noodles for me.  My server said I can just request 1/2 noodles more broth next time. They still charge you the same price.
 
Service here was spot on. Everyone was friendly and polite.  Unlike the other Asian restaurant that recently opened up at the casino, the employees here are prepared and ready for the rush hour crowd. I'm lovin the ramen craze and welcome another one here on this side of town!

1900 Asian Cuisine is the newest Chinese restaurant to open up at the former Kung Fu Chef site, offering traditional Chinese breakfast, "dim sum" and Szechuan, Shanghainese, and Taiwanese cuisine.  It is in the same plaza as Bazic, Old SF Market, and Shuseki.  They have only been opened since Tuesday (June 4, 2013), so spanking new they still don't have traditional menus printed up yet (currently utilizing single sided print outs stapled together).  But the staff all sport matching black or white shirts with the restaurant name printed on it.

At the time I dropped by at around 8:30pm on a Sunday, the restaurant was still not too busy.  After reviewing the menu, asked for recommendations and finally decided on Cumin Lamb, I kept myself busy with a game on my phone, while doing some eavesdropping.  Plus the insightful observation (duplicate check printout) that I made and verbal confirmation from the waitress, I learned that this new business is actually another restaurant venture by the owner of Three Village Restaurant, which has their original location just one floor up.  They also hired a chef direct from China, so they could offer up quality authentic Chinese food.

The food came out fairly quickly and it looked good.  Tasted great too. The only less than position impression was the haphazard way the steamed rice was served in a small bowl with rice all over the upper edges of the small bowl (they charge $0.50 for each bowl of rice).  I guess they just don't want to potentially waste rice on someone that only ordered one entree.

Of course one entree was not enough, and I ended up getting their Walnut Shrimp.  The portions is good, the shrimp was deep fried in a not too thick batter, just long enough that it was cooked without turning the crustacean into a rubbery exercise equipment for your jaw.

Overall the dinner menu is decent, but compared to what they offered during lunch (up to 5pm) it looks plain.  The patrons at nearby tables that arrived after me all asked about dim sum items, but all were told it was not available during dinner.  That's too bad, I would have ordered way more items if the kitchen could accommodate such request.  I hope they will take a cue from customers and at least offer some of dim sum items during dinner.

For breakfast (7-11am) they offer a small selection of traditional Chinese breakfast items (porridge, soy milk, etc.).  If I stay out really late or feeling extra motivated in the morning, I might check that out.

During their grand opening phase, they offer 15% discount to customers with local ID (or if you just look loco).  So if you are unsure, check them out with this little monetary carrot stick.

If you are not sure of what to get, then order their Cumin Lamb!

Taste:  3.5/5  Only tried a few dinner items thus far, some are really good some just OK.  I think the gems will be from the lunch menu.

Price/Value: 3.5/5  Not going to find cheap food at low low prices here. You pay for quality here.

Service:  3.5/5  Needs improvement in some areas, but they were nice and professional.

They are open late!!!  Mon-Thurs 2:30am  and Fri-Sat 3:30am 

3.5 stars

* Men's room could be cleaned up better, the trash was on the floor.

** This will be a good site for UYEs, so we can have a larger group to try out more of their menu in one go.

*** Does not accept American Express, Iraqi Dinars, but may consider renminbi (RMB).

We are big fans of OTFM!

We had been going to the Phoenix Downtown Market on Saturdays for a year + now & love it. It's just a bit of a hike for us. We also participated in Maya's Farm's CSA the last go around & have been missing our market visits.

Well, we've been going religiously to OTFM now for some time & pretty much cannot miss it.

It just continues to get better & better (and more & more crowded).

McClendon Farms has a big spread there & the produce is awesome. They have enough variety that we don't even have to supplement produce purchases with supermarket visits at all.

My other favorite thing about OTFM is that they have GREAT food.

Highlights for me:

-Payton Curry is typically there (some representative of Digestif always is) & has killer dishes. We've had awesome chili, wonderful frittatas & even fresh hand pulled mozzarella with bagna cauda (which is probably our new favorite find of the past several months).

-Tracey Dempsey (desert genius of assorted Kasperski spots) is there & has wonderful creations. She typically has a great offering from Cowboy Ciao as well.

-Chrysa Kaufman & Rancho Pinot are there showcasing McClendon produce. Whatever they have flat out rocks. I've had amazing sandwiches there every time, unbelievable bean & sausage soup & about 50 glasses of meyer lemonade (the kids help).

The other absolute must for us is the bread by the Phoenician folks. They have a chocolate cherry sourdough which is insane. Pairs wonderfully with red wine & coffee (so it's easy to do twice in a day). Their other breads are awesome too.

That's enough for me to already be a win. I absolutely love that the chefs of some of the great local independent spots were there chatting & interacting with the community. Makes me doubly want to patronize their restaurants. It seems as if the chefs are pairing up with local farms as well.

Other faves: 

-The tamale folks from Downtown Market are there with their excellent product. Unfortunately, they don't focus much on food sales on the spot but more on frozen packets for home.  We love their tamales (especially their chicken/mole).

-There is a hot dog stand using Vienna Beef & doing Chicago style dogs with sport peppers, celery salt & all. Food is good but be prepared to wait.

-There is also an interesting looking huge BBQ smoker which I need to try. Heard it was great from some folks we talked to.

-Maya's Farm is there. Produce looked great.

-There was an interesting vegan desert stall which was quite yummy that we'll be checking out more closely as well (dairy/egg allergic kids).

-Several artisan bread stalls...

And throughout the day, they also have live music which gives it a nice vibe.

Was bummed Tortillas Rosario isn't there any longer. Hopefully they'll return as they were there early on. 

Excited that Seacat Gardens will also be coming back soon!

Have also heard Sweet Republic will have a presence soon which we'll be totall psyched for.

Fresh eggs are scarce. We've been too late but have heard that Maya & the goat lady have eggs. Definitely something that they need more of.

They also do the write your order down on a card & go pay at a central location type thing like Downtown Phoenix Market as well but there are a couple vendors who only take cash.

If you need it, there is an ATM just north of 1st street on Brown (west side of the street) - I needed it.

Anyway, for us, it's by far our favorite farmers market in town!

4.5 stars 
Oh House of Tricks, you are a sneaky devil aren't you? 
Did you know I was coming? Is that why you pulled out all the stops for my visit? Did you know you were flirting with someone who doesn't give 5 stars freely? Is this always how you are, or are you only charming when good company is around? Well if you keep it up, you're going to get hit with 5 stars! 

I have visited House of Tricks three times. The first time I was on a hot date with a couple and a dog (yeah, that's how I roll). We sat out on the bar patio and decided to order a few dishes to share with each other. We started with a cheese plate that was very good and did not lack variety. For the entree I chose the beef tenderloin rare. The other entree that was picked was the vegetarian lasagna. Now, with me being a well known carnivore I will say that I was nervous about a vegetarian dish. We were served a bread basket with butter. Here's one of my pet peeves: Cold bread with cold butter. Never the twain shall meld. One must be warm! Give me a softened butter on cold bread or warm bread with cold butter. Get it? Moving on. 
Our dishes arrived after a short wait. Ah and how beautiful it was! The tenderloin was on a bed of mashed potatoes and greens and tasted wonderful! The meat was perfectly cooked! Now to try the lasagna! Omigosh! What a surprise! The lasagna was so delicious that I almost pushed aside my steak to eat the lasagna...almost. I sat back full and astonished at the great meal I just had! 

The second visit I had was lunch with a coworker. I chose the Chili Rubbed Hanger Steak. It came with Asadero cheese stuffed tortillas with roasted Ancho sauce, avocado puree and cilantro rice. Perfection! Absolute perfection! Everything was delicious, flavorful and well executed! I'm not a fan of cilantro and I even enjoyed the rice! The visit was certainly a 5 star visit. 

My third visit was for a dear friend's birthday dinner. I was so excited to go! For an appetizer I chose the foie gras and fig appetizer. It was so decadent. The mixture of savory/salty foie gras with a sweet fig mixture was heavenly! For my main dish I went with the tenderloin on top of a greens mixture and mashed potatoes. Everything was great until I started tasting WAY TOO MUCH salt. I am a salt lover and it turned out that the potatoes were oversalted. I called our servers attention to it and and she brought another dish out with just sauteed greens. It was perfect! 

I adore House of Tricks. Their menu changes with the seasons and there is always something new I want to try on the menu. If it weren't for a couple VERY SMALL issues, I would give them 5 stars in a heart beat! I look forward to visiting the restaurant again VERY soon!

Now that my recent 3-star reviews are out of the way, I can share a new, surprisingly enjoyable find before I enter a short period of temporary hibernation.  The place is Oscar's Beef  Booze Broads.  Yes, our previous mayor's steakhouse that opened to some disappointment and poor Yelp reviews!  I'm glad I waited until some kinks were taken out of the delivered product.  I'm sure I experienced marked improvement on my recent visit, because I was quite impressed by my dining experience here.  All was not perfect, but overall it was a 4-1/2-star dining experience.

Let's begin at the beginning.  For starters I selected Johnny Quinn's Crab Cakes, which featured large hunks of fresh lump crabmeat, Stoned Ground Dijon Mustard Sauce, and Pepper Remoulade.  The pair of crab cakes had very little filler as our waiter had declared, and the Pepper Remoulade was especially mellow and tasty as an accent to go with the crab.

Next up for me was Crazy Phil's Onion Soup.  At first I was a little disappointed in its physical appearance because, unlike most classic Onion Soups Gratinee, this crock of soup did not have a crusty crown of cheese overlaying the broth.  But once I tasted this beauty, my initial negative visual impression went quickly out of mind.  Made with sherry infused white wine, veal stock, a deconstructing crouton, and Gruyere Cheese, the sweet broth and other ingredients were simply delicious.  This was a truly outstanding and hot French Onion Soup!

Complimentary Onion Bread with visible pink onions was also very good as a starter, but I didn't want to continue eating Onion Bread all night, so I backed off after downing two slices with butter.  Oscar's Chopped Salad was artistically crafted in a nicely shaped circular mound of creamed up chopped vegetables topped by sprouting Onion Straws.  The salad, containing Grape Tomatoes, carrot shavings, Italian Squash, and mostly diced zucchini tossed with Maytag Bleu Cheese was cool, creamy, and refreshing.

An interesting twist then occurred as large steak knives were laid out for the men in my dining party, while much more slender and petite steak knives were set out for the women.  (See pic.)  Diane bridled a bit at this, and so I asked our server why females were not provided the same knives as males.  With a serious expression, he replied that it was more appropriate to furnish the men with "a manly man's knife," and women with "an elegant lady's knife."  I suppose whether a person views this practice as sexist or chivalrous depends on one's point of view.  It also could be deliberately done a bit tongue in cheek, reflecting upon the image of "Beef, Booze, and Broads" which the restaurant plays up rather than down in a whimsical sort of way.  Soon after we were seated, a comely, white-gloved buxom blonde in a lacy black gown came over to welcome us; she said she was "one of the broads."  (See pic.)

My slightly charred medium-rare Filet was cooked perfectly, and went well with a very tasty house-made Bearnaise Sauce.  A large King Crab Leg that Diane and I split was warm rather than hot, and not very sweet; and the Drawn Butter to go with it was not very hot either.  But Lobster Mashed Potatoes were very hot and very good, except for the two tiny pieces of shell that were encountered.  Wild Mushrooms were a very good second topping for my steak, as I made sure that my stomach was fully indulged this particular night.

And to complete a fine meal, the oven-baked Apple Cobbler with Cinnamon Bread Crumbs that I chose, which was made in a La Cocotte Staub all-metal Dutch oven and served with a strawberry, raspberries, and blackberries on the side, and with two large scoops of quickly melting Vanilla Ice Cream on top, was as delicious as it sounds!

With many tables and booths facing the Fremont Street Experience and sumptuously decorated, amid a nice airy ambiance, with white-tied waiters taking orders  under a glass ceiling, this is one classy place turning out memorable meals.  Hizzoner should be proud of his new downtown eating palace!

I'm writing this review in the midst of the happy food coma this restaurant put me in. I was so excited when I found out that Short Leash was going to be unleashed to become their own stand along restaurant! This means that I don't have to chase a truck to get my Short Leash fix anymore! We rushed here the first available moment and tonight was the night. Knowing that Short Leash has a cult following and others would probably be lining up to eat here too, we came early at about 5:30. I'm so glad we did because by the time we left at 6:45pm, there was a wait almost out the door! 

The hot dogs are exactly what you would expect: delicious Schreiner's sausages sandwiched between fresh Naan with a variety of different delicious ingredients on top. There are several unique hot dog entrees to choose from and you can also build your own dog. We started with the corn dog bites which come on skewer sticks and are accompanied by a ranch and a spicy sauce. The corn dogs are amazing; freshly made corn dog batter and cheese infused sausage. For my entree, I decided to go with a class Short Leash special, the Sunny which is a chicken sausage with grilled fruit, goat cheese, prosciutto and arugula. It's one of my favorite hot dogs and the perfect combination of ingredients. Besides the hot dogs that made them the local celebrities they are today, this restaurant has some new additions to the menu including salads and sliders. They also have beer on tap so you can have a beer with your dog! 

As for the environment, it's very neighborhood friendly. Everyone is encouraged to be friends while they eat and this is reflected by the communal tables. Be prepared to dine with a couple strangers (who might become new-found friends!) if you come during peak hours. If you don't feel like taking the chance to have to dine at a communal table, then I suggest that you eat at the bar. It's simple sophistication inside with a cool feel to it. Brad and Kat's friendly personality comes to life as Brad welcomes you inside while Kat cooks up a storm in the back. 

I am so happy that this successful food truck has turned into an adorable restaurant. Their food, service and charm has rolled over nicely into their new restaurant! I will happily return again soon to get my Short Leash fix. 

***** 
After dining on our hot dogs, we headed next door for a piece of pie from another food truck success story, Mamma Toledo who opened up The Pie Hole next door. Look for that review coming up next!

I got a few e-mails from The M announcing this new restaurant, which opened on Thursday.  Eric R.'s birthday is tomorrow, so we decided to celebrate on Saturday night here.  He was thinking sushi initially, and since this is not far from us and also has a sushi bar, we decided to check it out.  This is in the old Marinelli's restaurant spot and is very swanky.  There is a green light trim (the previous restaurant was red-lit).  Right when we were seated, Chef Seonkyoung Longest (winner of Restaurant Express on Food Network) was making the rounds of every table and we were next!  She was so friendly and talked to us about her restaurant, and she showed so much pride.

Our server was Doug and he is fantastic.  He was very friendly, informative, and personable.  We talked to him about dish sizes to make sure we were not over-ordering.  I started with a Yuzu Rita (yuzu juice, grand marnier, soju, simple syrup) rimmed with sea salt, and Eric R. had the Pacific mojito (in fact, 2 of them) AND jasmine green hot tea, which was by tea forte and in cute little pyramid infuser.  All of the serveware was very cool, with a theme of white wavy patterns.  The salt and pepper shakers were like puzzle pieces that fit together (our little marriage theme too, awww) and had white wavy patterns, the white napkins had this pattern across it, plates were rimmed with it, the tea pot also....soooo cute!  I liked it a lot!  Water glasses were stemmed jewel tone dark green which which was really cool and went with the green mood lighting.

We started with 2 apps, the duck sliders (5 spiced duck, cucumber, steamed bao with kaiware, cilantro and green onions to add) and Korean "street tacos" which was deconstructed: 3 scallion pancakes (wish there were 4!!!), bulgogi, cabbage in "kimchi sauce," and shredded vegetables (radish, peppers) with sriracha-lime sauce.  Chef Longest stopped by to check on us after we had our apps.  We told her our entree is the bimibap, and she cheerfully told us that her mom came on opening night and approved of the bimibap (FYI: Chef grew up in Korea).  Apparently this was one of the top dishes from the show that she made.

The bimibap was served in a beautiful bowl with the egg perfectly poached easy on top, with a side of the sauce.  The server wanted to mix it up with the sauce but Eric R. tasted it and felt the slow burn in his non-spicy palate.  We declined and I just mixed it with the poached egg.  We then split it and then I added the sauce.  Everything was sooooo good.  I loved the shiitakes in the dish.

Next, we ordered a little sushi: the Lady Luck Roll (salmon, tuna, hamachi on top, inside asparagus, gobo, avocado) and toro nigiri (3 pieces for $10, I think the 3rd was given to us for Eric R.'s birthday though).  The quality of the fish was excellent.  The maguro on the menu is bigeye and there is also blue fin tuna available.  For Eric R.'s birthday, he got a beautiful strawberry-white chocolate dessert with gold leaf on top that was just beautiful and delicious.  He loves both of those things so the restaurant nailed it.  However, the chef encouraged me to try the yuzu doughnuts because of my yuzu-love.  I guilted Eric R. into letting me get a 2nd dessert since he had 22 drinks and I had one.

The yuzu doughnuts came out pretty quickly.  They were described as yuzu-cream filled but they were actually not filled.  Also troublesome was the fact that they were room temperature.  I just expected warm to hot doughnuts.  They were just like room temperature dough drizzled with yuzu cream and topped with chopped pistachios.  The cream was fine (not as yuzu-y as the drink) but the temperature of the doughnuts just did not work.  Eric R. actually asked one of the chefs walking back toward the kitchen about it, and he immediately said they are supposed to be room temperature because otherwise the sauce would break.  I guess I personally didn't like it but other people might.  Just get the yuzu rita!!

Overall, service is great, the Chef is really enthusiastic, the ambiance is nice, and the food is excellent.  Also, the prices for food and drink are very reasonable ($8 for a specialty cocktail!) We will definitely return!

This is another great restaurant in Aria.  I have been wanting to try this for two years and I finally went tonight.  I got the 5 course Signature Tasting Menu and it was great excellent!!

The bread basket had a pretzel roll, lavosh, and two pieces of Bon Breads batards.  Nice basket selection.

Coure 1 - Almas Ara Caviar served on a bed of lemon gele with some crme fraiche and a sprig of dill.  The gele filled a hollowed out lemon and the caviar and other things were placed on top of the gele,

Coure 2 - Bacon wrapped shrimp with papaya mustard and cilantro.  

Course 3 - Chilean Sea Bass with a miso foam with Yuzu.  

Course 4 - 6 ounce Wagyu filet served on a small bed of spinach and with two rounds of parmesan squash.

Course 5 - Desert was the JG Candy bar.  The candy bar was a mixture of chocolate crunch with caramel peanuts, some candied popcorn, peanut butter, white chocolate, and an oval of whipped cream.

Comments:  I was impressed by the flavor profiles developed in each of the dishes.  The mixture of lemon, dill and caviar was unique and very fresh tasting.  The bacon gave the shrimp and amazing taste and the papaya mustard added an additional layer of flavor.  The spiciness of the foam with the sea bass was another wonderful flavor pairing.  The Wagyu beef was so tender it almost fell apart on its own yet it was cooked black and blue as I asked.  Finally the candy bar had so many flavors and textures and it was really a playful finishing course for this grand meal.

I did not get the dipping sauces with my steak, but I didn't request them and I didn't care if I had them or not.  I'm normally a steak purist and like steak as it is without anything but salt.

The staff was amazing.  I was served by Team 1.  I had prompt, always attentive service without being annoying.  My iced tea glass was not refilled.  When I neared the end of a glass, a server came by with a fresh glass of iced tea and took the old one.  I didn't need to request a refill--it was just done.  The main server always returned after I had a short time with each course to check if everything was satisfactory.  This is amazing service and the team concept worked just the way they planned.

I liked the room a lot.  It's modern, dimly lit but with small spot lights that light each table so you have a super combination of dim lighting but enough light I didn't need the flash when I took my photos.  I also liked the fact that the bar area with its TV was segregated from the dining areas by a sheer curtain that blocked the bar atmosphere which is just fine with me.

** Begin Rant:  Guys, this is not a restaurant to wear t-shirts even if they are for Azuza Pacific U.  Dress up a little, please!  And for two other guys, wearing a ball cap at any restaurant during dinner is NEVER correct.  Show some class.  John Deere no less.  ** End Rant.

Jean Georges is a restaurant to which I'll return.  Truly 5 stars!

Five of us had dinner at The Carlton last night and it was a wonderful dining experience. 

For appetizers we had: 1 jumbo lump crab cake, 1 beet salad, 1 lobster and crab gnocchi, and 2 house salads. The Jumbo Lump Crab Cake which I ordered, was meaty with crab and was very rich sitting atop of Julianne vegetables. The Dijon Cream and fresh herb sauce it came with was just delicious. The gnocchi was tender and mild which allowed the lobster and crab to predominate the flavor profile. It was served in a Spinach, Caramelized Onions and Tomato-Ketel One Cream base. Very tasty indeed.
Salad eaters, house and beet, all said they were great as well. These were all very good size appetizers so you might save some for taking home if you plan on heavy entrees and tend to fill-up fast.

With the appetizers we also finished off two lemon cream martinis, one sour apple martini and one Grey Goose on the rocks with a twist, and one Arnold Palmer (AP refills aplenty). All drinks were made well. The had a nice martini list, a pretty good wine by the glass list and a full wine list which comes out on an iPad. Pretty cool approach. I am not counting but they say they have over 500 wines on the list. Enough to match any taste or meal. Later for dinner we wanted some rich, creamy full mouth Chardonnay so the proprietor suggested Sonoma-Cutrer for us. This was delicious and great match with our food.

Dinner entrees were hard to choose from the extensive menu which includes some great daily specials which they say usually change every day. Sticking with a theme, I went the seafood route all night and choose the Florida Grouper which was prepared oven roasted and was fresh Parmesan crusted and served with Lobster Pierogies, Spring Vegetables and Roast Garlic Butter. Oh my was this meal ever rich and tender. The Grouper was completely melt in your mouth fresh and tender, and I exaggerate not one bit. The Pierogies were moist, tender and full of lobster stuffing and it went so well with the Grouper. Boy this was a satisfying choice.
 
Three people, were enticed by the 14 oz. medium to medium rare Prime Rib. They all came out looking absolutely beautiful. Jody who is the real Prime Rib  connoisseur said that his ranked up with the best of them. Jody has traveled and lived or visited may cities for extended stays.  He has lived in Las Vegas so he had the opportunity to eat a Lawry's Prime Rib several times. To which I can say when I ate there with him a time or two, and I thought it was the best I ever had. So that puts The Carlton up with the best prime rib places in our judgment.
Linda went for the Ahi Tuna entre, which she said was extremely fresh and tender with the fabulous Tuna flavor one seeks in the best sushi. But it doesn't come naked. It's preparation is fresh Wasabi-Panko crusted with the Ahi Tuna seared rare and served with Curry-Coconut Orzo, Asian Greens, Hearts of Palm-Julienne Carrots and Yuzu Butter. This was a beautiful and tasteful preparation. Had enough to bring home and it served as a special breakfast this morning.

I have to say that everything was really outstanding at The Carlton. Topping it off with some personal service, Kevin Joyce, the owner stopped at our table to see if we were enjoying or meals.  Have to hand it to Kevin, his professional staff, and especially Executive Chef Mark Swomley who has been there for 16 years. The Carlton itself has been around for 27 years which I think is a real testament to its enduring quality and service. You can not go wrong here.

After my outstanding experience here, it goes without saying that Wolfgang Puck's take on steaks is a "cut" above the rest!

Tucked inside the Palazzo resort, Cut exhibited a refined contemporary appeal and warmth that was both inviting and comforting.  I especially enjoyed the service by Tara who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. 

After allowing us to peruse the menu for awhile, she returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts and I must say, they all looked enticing! 

Shortly after, we were served our wine and breads, which included the usual steakhouse suspects of fragrant & savory onion focaccia, pretzel roll, one of my personal favorites, mainly because of the firm outside texture and soft and chewy inside... and it wasn't too salty like most other pretzel breads I've come across. 
Parmesan bread stick took a close second  place for its addictive light, crisp & crunchy texture with a generous coating of Parmesan breading on the outside.

Bone Marrow Appetizer - From the buttery soft marrow to the warm, flavorful mushroom sauce, it was a blissful combination of ingredients and love. Simply unbelievable. If there's one single dish from this entire trip, I will be craving for months afterwards, it will definitely be this!

Steak Tasting 
American Kobe Style from snake river - paired with a house steak sauce. The beef was perfectly tender and seared beautifully leaving my mouthwatering for another juicy bite. The tangy flavor of the steak sauce was a perfect addition to the meat as it brought on a bright acidity to the steak. Let it be known, I'm determined to get the recipe for that irresistible sauce!!!!
USDA prime dry aged - much softer and juicier than the New York, this cut of steak was praiseworthy in every way. Honestly, it was a cut of perfection on a plate and the accompanying chimichurri sauce added a brightness to my palate that made it all the more satisfying. 
Australian wagyu from Blackmore -
Worthy of it namesake, was truly the best of the best. It's like they took 50 steaks and concentrated all the beefiness into one bite. The best steak I've ever had. It came with a barnaise sauce but honestly this piece needed nothing to dress it. It was perfect all on its own.

White corn had a fresh & crunchy bite with a slightly sweet caremelized exterior that added a pleasant rustic flavor to the dish 

Dessert
Baked Alaska - Tasted like a giant strawberry mochi. Btw, that's a good thing!  It also came with a small lemon bar, which had a lip puckering natural citrusy flavor!

Banana Creme pie came with chocolate ice cream, sauce, and chocolate crunch pearls. Now that's what I call a triple chocolate threat! Having said that, It was surprisingly mild and less cloyingly sweet, which I really enjoyed.

Before we left, Tara gave us more sweets in the form of a chocalate truffle cookie bar and a chewy peanut brittle...both were absolutely delicious! 

Service was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. But i'd have to say Tara made all the difference! She transformed a pleasant meal to an unforgettable dining experience with her natural charm and warm tableside manner, which easily made the evening five stars in my book!

Bravo to CUT for an exquisite meal and extraordinary service! 

You bet ill be back for an encore! 

Until then...

Happy Eats!

***Le Cirque is a French restaurant with a quality similar to La Folie and Gary Danko; the food is decent but because it is in Las Vegas, it (like many other high-end Vegas spots) is not worth the high price tag***

Le Cirque is a well regarded transplant from New York City.  It is a French restaurant, but it is a much less formal dining experience than Joel Robuchon or Guy Savoy.  The restaurant's decor is a signature element.  The room is covered in circus murals and even the ceiling is a tent canopy to really create a circus-esque atmosphere (albeit a high end one).

Several menu options are available.  There is a six course tasting menu (where you have some choices) as well as a 3-course a la carte starter, entree and dessert option.  A fast pre-theater menu (of 3 courses) is also available.

I went with the 3-course a la carte menu and added an extra starter.  The meal started with a trio of salmon amuses.  There was salmon tartare with roe, salmon gravlax with honey and dill, and smoked salmon atop a potato waffle.  All of the amuses were good and really showcased the salmon.

There was a wide variety of bread options.  I chose the pretty good bacon baguette.  I also had the French bread, which had a pretty good chew.

I started with the white alba truffle risotto, which was expensive but very good.  The risotto rice was very nicely cooked.  It was al dente with a noticeable bite.  The risotto was creamy and had a good Parmesan flavor (some might find it a tad too strong or salty). 

The white truffles were great--very nice flavor and strong aroma.  The truffles were not as good as the ones I had in DC at CityZen, but that could just be because white truffle season is ending. The only thing that could have been better was the presentation.  They should have shaved the truffles tableside.

If you do not want to pay the supplemental charge or are not a fan of truffles, a good lobster risotto is also available.

I also had the sauted foie gras and it was nowhere near as delicious.  The foie gras was undercooked and it was not the best quality.  It was very broken and there were quite a few strands in it.  It was creamy but not that smooth.

The garnishes were okay.  I liked the crunch and flavor of the almonds.  I also liked the pineapple tart though it was a very small portion.  The quinoa was kind of just bland mush.

You can definitely see the difference between Le Cirque's foie gras (the first link) and Picasso's foie gras (the second link), which is much more refined, simple and clean (Picasso is also located in the Bellagio).

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=p8ao29A31ijNwDXuAxQxjA&userid=w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/picasso-las-vegas?select=GHrwF6JC4xmm5KknR_UHYw#FmNSTUhS4p7qmbufGVNMYg

My entree was a butter poached lobster tail and the lobster itself was nicely cooked.  It was very fresh and was mostly soft (a little tough in parts).  I really liked the garnish of caviar--a generous portion and very fishy, briny and salty.

The base of the lobster was a vanilla emulsion and I did not like it.  The sweetness and the very pronounced flavor of the vanilla kind of ruined the dish.  The garnishes of cauliflower and broccoli were average.

There was also a side dish of pomme pure, mushrooms and lobster meat.  This was messy, but it was good upscale comfort food.

For dessert, I oped for the grand mariner souffl, but I should have ordered the chocolate souffl instead.  The baking of the souffl was very good.  It had a nice lift and it was airy, light and moist.  The flavor of the grand mariner was too strong.  It was a very powerful flavor and the strong punch of alcohol diffused any sweetness this dessert had.

The meal ended with some mignardises including a pretty good cream-filled profiterole (with a hard candy-esque topping), a blueberry financier, a lemon meringue tart (similar to the ones they have at Platine in Culver City), and a caramelized fig tart.

Service was good.  The food came out at a quick pace and the staff was pleasant and attentive.  I did feel the service was a little rushed at times; Le Cirque's service just did not have the smooth ease of Bellagio's Picasso.

Prices were high, but that is to be expected given Le Cirque's location.  The food is about in the same price range as Picasso and I think the food at Picasso is much more refined, elegant and exquisite.

Le Cirque is a decent French restaurant.  It reminds me of La Folie and Gary Danko in terms of menu items and quality.  I think you could probably have a satisfying French dinner here, but it will probably not be worth the high price (like most Las Vegas restaurants on The Strip).

Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free valet and self parking.

When I saw their signature Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles platter on a Las Vegas television show one night I knew I had to try this.  As my buddies stopped into the Imperial Palace casino to throw away a little more cash I decided a mid day feast was in order.  I imagined this place would get pretty crowded, but at 4:30 in the afternoon on a weekend this restaurant was surprisingly empty.

My buddies later told me they were concerned that a huge meal a day before the marathon would hamper their performance.  I'm a slower runner than they are though so my only concern was to finish the race and have fun doing it.

Back to the restaurant I was greeted and offered a seat at the bar or a table.  I noticed an attractive vixen sitting alone at the bar so I decided I was going to go there and offer her a bit of companionship.  As I sat comfortably into my seat I couldn't help but notice this dainty young lady was eating from two giant platters of food.  She acknowledged my presence, turned to me, smiled, greeted me and told me she's a dancer and hadn't eaten all day.  Don't mind my stare, lady!  I'm not checking out your perfect physique, but I do have an eye on the humongous burger on your plate.  Wait!  Do all showgirls eat like this?

I finally picked up my menu.  They offer fresh squeezed fruit juices in 10 ounce and 20 ounce glasses so I went with a fresh tangerine juice, but I'm sitting at a bar, and how does one not have a beer when they're sitting at a bar?  I selected a Pyramid Apricot Wheat Ale (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=I1ZZCzT_lKHJ_YthVtc-Cw) and ice water knowing all to well I needed to stay hydrated for the run ahead.

I took a quick glance at the food menu although I knew exactly what I wanted to try the minute I walked into the restaurant.  I selected the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  The service here was outstanding.  Every time the bartender left his station he'd return and give me an update on my food.

I had a crappy camera with me at the time, but this is what I had (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=BagiL1VmvJTeDz_CIsty3w).  It's two huge chicken breasts partial bone attached battered and fried and sitting on an angle atop four squares of bacon-stuffed Belgian waffles drizzled in hot maple syrup.  That's right.  The waffles are stuffed with crispy bacon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=t2IoUrYE-c7cIHRBxkk6ow)!

The weight of the two chicken pieces quickly gave way to gravity as they fell onto the plate.  The chicken breast was amazingly juicy and the crispy batter was well seasoned.  The waffles were fluffy and chewy and I hadn't even gotten to the crispy bacon yet.  This signature dish definitely lived up to its hype.  This was outstanding.  I had to sit awhile after nearly finishing that entire platter.

The dancer did better than I did taking what little food she left in a to-go box.  As she turned, smiled and bid me farewell I couldn't help but notice how gracefully she walked out the door.  I was so stuffed you might have been able to tip me over on my side and rolled me out the door!

Las Vegas dancer or not, this time next year at 4:30 in the afternoon I will be back!

I visited last night at around 6:45.  Because I was meeting my dining companion here at 7, I decided to sit at the bar and take advantage of happy hour.  I was impressed by the long list of $2 beers, which included Woodchuck Amber hard cider, which I ordered.  Happy hour here seems quite popular--the bar was almost full at the time that I arrived, and was completely full by the time my dining companion arrived--and given the selection and discount, I can certainly understand the attraction!

Once my dining companion arrived, we got a table.  Having heard good things about the fried cauliflower patties, we decided to get an order of them to share.  (This worked out nicely, since one order comprises 4 patties.)  They were quite nice, esp. with the lemon aioli sauce drizzled on them, tasting similar to potato patties.  Cauliflower patties aren't an item that would normally hold a huge appeal to me, but I'd definitely recommend them!

For my entree, I ordered the turkey burger, since I'd also heard good things about it, and my dining companion ordered the Social (beef) burger.  Based on other reviews, I was expecting a mind-blowingly delicious turkey burger.  Alas, this was not the case.  Paradoxically, the turkey patty and bun were extremely dry, whereas the toppings were overly moist.  As I ate the burger, the far end became soggier and soggier, to the point that I found it inedible, only finishing 2/3 of it.  The burger wasn't nearly as flavorful as I was hoping, either--I could barely taste the gouda cheese, and the lettuce and tomatoes didn't add much to it in terms of flavor, either.  In general, the ingredients struck me as low quality.

I ordered the cheesy tomato soup as a side, and it wasn't bad--it was thicker and creamier than Campbell's, though it wasn't quite as cheesy as I would have hoped, and I'm not sure how I feel about the toasted bready thing floating in it.  The burgers came with fresh cut fries, which was a nice touch, but they were nothing too special.

Aside from the food, service was pretty lackluster, with our waitress making minimal conversation, etc.--although she did keep our water glasses filled, which we appreciated.  As for the ambiance, I'd describe it as rather loud and somewhat boisterous--which I suppose is to be expected for a place called Social.  People were engaging in some fun activities, such as ping pong and darts, which was cool to watch.

Overall, with the exception of the cauliflower patties, I wasn't very impressed with the food at Social.  (I found out later that Social is owned by the same group that owns Shady Grove, for which I have similar feelings.)  If you want a solid turkey burger, I'd recommend checking out BRGR nearby. I'd consider returning for happy hour, but would definitely go elsewhere for dinner.

I don't really like Italian food.... there, I said it, it's true. You can begin submitting your hate mail. When anyone asks the question, "What do you want to eat?" Italian will rarely, if ever, come out of my mouth. However, that may have been changed by North Frattoria Italiana. 

Many of my Phoenix Yelp friends have been to and speak highly of North. I just realized that I can literally walk there from my home. At times, I'm completely oblivious to my surroundings. All this time, North has been sitting here, and I haven't taken advantage of it. Well, today that has all changed.

We came here tonight because my offspring loves Italian food... He may not actually be mine. I'm kidding, he's mine, bought and paid for. 
 
The first thing I noticed about North was the setting. Unlike the typical Mamma Mia... Ay you's guys... Ooh La La (actually I think that last one's French) atmosphere, North has a farm house feel. The staff was even wearing plaid shirts and jeans. I liked that laid back feel. I'm a country boy at heart so the farm-esque tone was comforting.

We started our food journey with the calamari and a seasonal chef board:
The calamari was okay. The breading was a bit heavy and I thought it took away from the flavor and feel of the calamari. It's not something I would get again.

The seasonal chef board was good. It consisted of brussel sprouts, squash, asparagus, mushrooms, some kind of cheese and a few slices of really good bread. I liked it, but it was more for my lady. The veggies fixation is her thing.

For my main dinner I got the Ricotta Gnocchi. It's braised beef short rib with gnocchi served in a horseradish crema and wilted arugula. I love short rib, but I'm not a huge fan of horseradish. I asked our server her opinion and she assured me it all complimented each other. She was absolutely right. It was excellent. The short rib was very tender and the crema, meat and gnocchi all worked perfectly. Excellent.

I could have ended the meal there and been content, but we didn't. For dessert we ordered the Tiramisu and Bombolini: 

The tiramisu is served in a glass container rather than in sliced cake form, and is covered in playful little chocolate balls. I liked the presentation. It was cool looking and tasted great. 

The bombolini are Italian donuts. They had cinnamon and sugar on the surface and were plated on a lemon/vanilla mascarpone pudding-like bed. It all worked well together and my son, who is a bit of a "donut expert", thought they were very good. 

Overall, this was a wonderful experience. Everyone walked away happy and I found an Italian place that I could see myself frequenting... for that, 5 stars is in order.

A 5-star rated restaurant on Yelp is very hard to come by but leave it to the tourists, or wait, better yet, the locals, to lead you in the right direction when it comes to good food in Vegas. 

Owned by Chef John Lee with his wife who also runs the dining area of the restaurant, the place seems to have something note-worthy going on. The quality of the ingredients they use are phenomenal, not to mention the exceptional freshness and grade of their fish. Like many, I value service that's genuine and efficient as well as a price tag that doesn't hurt your wallet as much. This place has it all.

ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA ($9) started off our meal with 3 dipping sauces that accompanied it: wasabi aioli, sweet banana sesame, and garlic ponzu. If there was one dip we fought over who gets to lick the last bit of it, that'll be the sweet banana sesame. 

SNAPPER w/ UNI ($13) initiated our cold sashimi orders. The presentation was so beautiful that all we wanted to do was stare at it. The inevitable was bound to happen and gladly we savored each bite appreciating how the uni did not overpower the snapper. Delicious!

SALMON WASABI CREME ($11) was highly recommended by our server and we took heed since we are big salmon fans. Clean flavors with a climax on the wasabi creme that sang melodiously altogether, this was easily my favorite out of all the sashimi dishes.

YELLOWTAIL YUZU SOY ($12) was served with "compliments of the chef" says our dear server. It was after all one of his most popular dishes and I completely understand why. The tempura serrano, cilantro, garlic oil, ponzu, and garlic dust all worked harmoniously for the benefit of the fish. 

BIG EYE TUNA POKI ($15) which was a special of the evening had a lusciously melt-in-your-mouth texture that only proves how fresh the tuna is. A much bigger portion compared to the sashimi dishes was a plus.

MISO MARINATED BLACK COD ($18) was cooked to perfection and was probably the best thing I ate here. So much for sharing but I'm getting an entree all to myself next time. Buttery yet flaky, black cod to me is the version of a grade-A Wagyu steak in fish.

TUNA TADA ($2) would be poki tuna on a tostada shell topped with avocado and cilantro. The contrasting textures of the crunchy shell to the tenderness of the fish and creaminess of the avocado was superb. For $2 each, can I have one more please? 

SOFT SHELL CRAB ROLL ($9) seemed to be popular but this did not wow me in presentation, however, looks can be deceiving and I'll say it was very good. My daughter will vouch for it, too but I'm sure the spicy version of this is much better.

FIRE CRACKER ROLL ($9) was my least favorite as it had cream cheese in it. Not their fault, just my preference. This had spicy tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, sweet onion, then deep fried. Everyone else enjoyed it.   

TWIN DRAGON ROLL ($15) won me over despite how stuffed I already was at this point. All the dishes we shared between 4 people but we all can't deny this roll was truly something with Alaskan King crab, spicy tuna, avocado, and tempura shrimp. Without a doubt this was the best out of the three rolls we had.

MATCHA TIRAMISU ($7) ended our meal with a sweet note. Green tea soaked sponge cake and matcha sabayon topped with whipped cream were all there was to it but let your imagination run wild as to how heavenly scrumptious this really was. 

Leaving us with a lasting impression, this entire meal kicked-off our weekend in Vegas with a bang!

It's crazy a place with such a simple menu and its main focus being chicken fingers could be so delicious, but it is! The chicken fingers here are fresh, never frozen. I ordered the "3 Finger Combo" priced at $5.99 and it included 3 chicken fingers, fries, texas toast, cane's sauce and a drink. The fingers had a great flavor and paired well with the cane's sauce. The texas toast was delicious and tasted great in the cane's sauce too! The fries were not that great. I'm not usually a fan of crinkle-cut fries anyway however these were kind of too crunchy outside and too dry inside. My hubby had the "Sandwich Combo" also priced at $5.99 that came with 3 chicken fingers, lettuce, fries, cane's sauce, a kaiser roll and drink. He assembled the sandwich to his liking and said he really enjoyed it, but he wasn't a fan of the fries either. One thing I wonder is why there isn't an option for spicy chicken fingers on the menu? Maybe one day I hope! For my drink I had the sweet tea and let me tell you... it's addicting! The sweet tea is brewed fresh and goes so nicely with the chicken!

As with most Raising Cane's in town, the drive-thru can be long. It's basically similar to waiting in a In-N-Out Burger drive-thru. Since they are making everything fresh, I don't mind waiting. The cashier was very friendly and told me about the Caniac Club where you can earn rewards with each visit. Next time you are at a Raising Cane's just ask for a card! Once you have your card, go online and register it and get a free "Box Combo" just for signing up! The box combo includes everything I had in my 3 finger combo, but you get the addition of 1 more chicken finger and a side of coleslaw. Score! They also offer a kids meal as well "Tailgates" which are party packs of either 25, 50, 75 or 100 chicken fingers that come with sauce.

***Many Las Vegas restaurants let their quality standards slip once they have been around for a while and that is the case with Hubert Keller's Burger Bar; Burger Bar is still a decent value compared to the many overpriced high-end restaurants on The Strip, but there are several new gourmet burger spots in Vegas (like Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood) that are probably more exciting***

There are several reasons to visit Hubert Keller's Burger Bar.  It is from a celebrity chef (Hubert Keller), but it is a relatively inexpensive restaurant (at least compared to the many expensive celebrity chef backed fine dining restaurants on The Strip).  It also primarily features two items--burgers and milkshakes--that are very popular.  Finally, Hubert Keller was on Top Chef Masters and showcased this restaurant as well as his burger skills so many might be intrigued with this one if they saw that season of Top Chef Masters on the Food Network.

This Burger Bar (there is also one located in the Macy's in San Francisco) is housed in Mandalay Place--a mini-mall within Mandalay Bay that features a few retail and dining options.  It is a fairly small place and the menu showcases a build-your-own-burger concept where you pick your burger protein--several types of beef, lamb, buffalo, turkey, and veggie as well as chicken breast and salmon.  You then choose your desired bun as well as all kinds of toppings including raw vegetables, grilled vegetables, many types of cheese (standard stuff like American and cheddar but also brie and smoked Gouda), several sauces, additional proteins like bacon and prosciutto, and finally a few premium ingredients like seared foie gras and black truffle.  You can also order one of their signature chef's burger creations so you do not have to make any choices.

In addition to their burgers, Burger Bar also serves all kinds of fried food from French fries and onion rings to zucchini fries and mozzarella sticks.  Chicken wings and a few salads are available too.

I went the build-your-own-burger route and opted for their Prime ground beef and added bacon, smoked Gouda and spinach on a potato bun.  The burger was okay.  I thought the burger at the newer Gordon Ramsay BurGR was much better--the beef was much juicier there and it featured both a higher quality bun as well as higher quality toppings.  The burger at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar was okay, but only the really thick and meaty (crispy but also chewy) bacon stood out.  The bun felt very plain for a gourmet burger spot.

I also opted for one of their milkshakes.  They have all kinds of milkshakes from build-your-own-milkshakes with many toppings to signature creations.  I tried their caramel latte, which featured coffee ice cream, caramel syrup, graham crackers, and butterscotch morsels.  It was a great mix of caramel and coffee and the milkshake had a great thick and creamy consistency (very addictive and hard to put down).

Service was good--pleasant and quick.

Prices are reasonable for a notable Las Vegas restaurant.  Burger Bar's prices are higher than similar gourmet burger restaurants in other big cities like Los Angeles, but that is to be expected given that Burger Bar is on The Strip.  Burger Bar does offer a decent meal that comes at a much lower price than the many celebrity chef backed (and very pricey) fine dining restaurants on The Strip.

I remember liking Burger Bar more on my first trip.  It is not too surprising that the quality has dropped since then; the quality standards at many Vegas restaurants seem to slip if it has been around for a long time.  Hubert Keller's Burger Bar is still a decent spot, but Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood is a much better option for an gourmet burger on The Strip.

Burger Bar is located in Mandalay Place, which is attached to Mandalay Bay.  Like other major casinos and hotels on The Strip, Mandalay Bay offers both complimentary self and valet parking.

By the time I ate here, I was totally cynical of all Scottsdale restaurants and was really thinking about having my lunch at In-N-Out.  

I got off to a really bad start at this place, too, they made me wait for a table at this half empty restaurant.  Which was okay, I guess, because D. Frank Designs is across the street.   Anyway, I come back, the sweet little hostess girl has my table ready, but the poor girl is limping because she fell at home the night before and hurt her knee!!  She even shows me the damage!  So, I guess it's okay that I had to wait a bit.  I mean the poor working girl is maimed!!!

So, wouldn't you know, she sits me in front of a window and it's hot as blazes there.  Geez.  So, I complain to my delightful servers Byran and Melia.  Yes, I get two servers.  I think they can easily identify a tough customer at this joint.  I quickly identified them as Mutt & Jeff.  So, Byran says he will tamper with my ventilation and I think, ya right.  But right away, it gets cooler and so do I.  

Anyway, this place has "Republic of Tea" tea.  You can't go wrong with any establishment that serves Republic of Tea.  I'm getting stoked now.  So, anyway, I check out the menu and can't decide what I want.  I mean, I'm starving, but I'm not that hungry.  Bryan convinces me to try the Stetson.  He says that if I don't love it, he will take it back and get me something else.  He says that no one has ever sent back the salad.  That's a challenge I can't pass up on.  So, I've finally made up my mind and then that wonderful Melia  comes out with some incredible hummus, fresh chopped salsa and spinach tortillas to tide me over until my salad come.  The flavors were so amazing together!  So fresh and delicious!

Next comes my Stetson Salad.  I don't need to describe it, because every yelp-er before me has done an excellent job.  But you don't know how really amazing this salad is until you try one yourself.  It is so incredibly good.  It's the first and only time that I have ever finished any salad anywhere.  It was so amazing.

Anyway, the sad part for me was that this was my last meal in Scottsdale.  And it was just lunch.  I wish I would have eaten here sooner and I wish I could have experienced dinner.  I will be back.  And Cowboy Ciao will be my first stop next time.

One of the things that I think sets this place apart, (besides the interesting food),  is the incredible service.  I felt like I was visiting Bryan's and Melia's and they were there to take care of me.  It's a very friendly place, I love that!!

My second favorite buffet is vegas!!! (#1 is Studio B)

I took Kimberly K's awesome advice to take advantage of lunch prices for dinner.  So basically this was my first stop driving into vegas on a Tuesday and we arrived about 30 minutes before lunch was about to end.
Got in for lunch price at $20 and got to eat dinner as well, which is normally $30.  Paying for 5 people, it was a $50 savings!

PRICES: as of 9/6/11  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw?select=O5p34DZJZrd9YRIoHpREMQ

Breakfast : M-F 6am to 11am = $16
Lunch: M-F  11am-4pm = $20
Dinner Sun-Th  4pm-10pm = $30
Gourmet Dinner Fri/Sat  4pm-10pm $37
Weekend Brunch 7am-4pm  $25    (with champagne = $30)

The most important part for me is that they have a pretty good dessert selection : These were my pickings :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw?select=aBragtXmC5EWj12o632S-A

They had: CREME BRULEE, soft serve, banana foster, bread pudding, cute little cone things, carrot cake, tiramisu, cheesecake, chocolate cake, tarts, flan. Ofcourse these were not superb desserts like u would find at jean philippes. But for buffet desserts, i think this is way better than most. Way better than Wynn buffet, which i thought was bad overall. Didn't see any chocolate covered strawberries tho. :( 

Meats and Seafood:
Kobe Top Round, Prime Rib, Ham, Roast Chicken, Turkey. 
(my fave was the top round)
Snow Crab Legs, King Crab Legs, Shrimp Cocktail. 
*crab was a bit salty and not super fresh. but it really didnt' stop anyone for getting heaping piles of it. 

Other stuff they had was Salmon Teriyaki, Miso Chilean Seabass, 3 kinds of mashpotatoes including sweet potato- my fave was the pesto mash potatoes. A few different salads, which werent' that great. pasta salads, soups, chashu bao, salmon and tuna sushi and poke, CA rolls, sliders (meh), pizza, mac and cheese, sausage

I've been to this buffet probably about 5 times over the years, and it's been pretty consistently good IMO. Unfortunately prices keep going up and lines can get ridiculously long. If it were the weekend, i would prefer going to SB, but if i'm here during the weekday, i would definitely recommend coming here for a late lunch/early dinner!!!

NIGHTMARE ON FREMONT ST

My driver dropped me off at the hotel in the back and when I say driver I received a ride alone in a short bus from the airport. I was staying in the Carson tower and when I walked in I was informed to go to the Carson tower registration. 

So I started walking through the craziness of a Vegas Casino. Maneuvering around tired people who are drinking a lot and losing too much money. They are like rats trapped in a box for 4 days and 3 nights and are in no hurry to go anywhere. But I pushed on and made my way past the mayhem while dragging my suitcase to get to the Carson tower for check in.

When I arrived at the Carson registration desk there was a sign that said Desk closed. Check in at the Rush Tower. What? So now I had to go back through the mayhem again. I pushed through and when I got to the Rush Tower there was a sign that informed me to check in at the Gold Tower registration because the desk was closed. What?

At this point I felt like there were hidden cameras laughing at my every move. I took a deep breath and decided to look for the Gold Tower registration. I asked the lady running the high roller Keno room and she pointed me to the VIP check in door. I knew this wasn't correct but I was frustrated and I was going to make it work. 

So I walked in with my frustrated face and informed the staff of my wild goose chase I had just been on. I also dropped the Keno ladies name because it's always good to drop a name. I believe they took a little pity on me but the staff was very unapologetic to my dilemma. They were also very unfriendly and it was probably because I wasn't a high roller VIP. I did ask them if it's normal to send guests on a scavenger hunt to check in and they looked at me like it wasn't a big deal. I then asked if they were going to fix the incorrect signs and they told me no. After 10 hours of no sleep and traveling I had no more fight in me but I do know this was wrong. 

Upon walking to my room I finally walked past the open registration desk for the Gold Tower. I will say this was a frustrating way to arrive at a hotel. 

So I get into my room and start unpacking my bag. I then go to the bathroom to wash my face and realized someone had used the bathroom. Yes someone sat on the toilet seat, used the toilet paper, unwrapped the soap and used a clean towel. I'm too exhausted for this. I called down and spoke with the front desk. I also asked if I could be moved to a new room. Of course my request was denied and a maid was sent up to clean my room. A housekeeping manager walked in and told the maid to clean my whole room including the sheets. She was actually nice and hard working. So I left my room for an hour to let the maid do her job. 

Day 2...I wake up early and leave to get my work day started. When I arrived back 4 hours later my room wasn't clean. I spoke with the maid in the hall and she said they would clean my room by 1pm. She even wrote me on her list. I came back to the room at 2pm and it wasn't clean. I called Housekeeping and they said they would send someone up. I got back to my room at 5pm and it was still dirty. I called and spoke with a manager who promised to take care of it and my room was finally cleaned at 6pm. Honestly is it that hard?

Day 3...It was my only day to sleep in and the maid bangs 5 times with the vacuum cleaner even though I had a "Do Not Disturb" sign on my door! Was it necessary to ram my door that many times? It was just rude. She knew what she was doing. 

Day 4...The room was prepaid by my client but for some reason the hotel decided to charge my credit card. I called down to the front desk and they were no help. The girl on the phone was rude and unhelpful. Then when I went downstairs that same girl was there. She was mean to me because of our phone call. I asked her to only see a copy of my bill. She printed me a bill with my credit card charged. She then slid open a drawer where she had her personal cell phone and started texting. This was incredibly rude & why would you do this in front of an upset customer. I did snap a photo of her displaying this unacceptable behavior. I really believe the staff needs to go through a hospitality travel course because they don't get it. 

The hotel staff doesn't have any good customer service. The employees seem unhappy and it translates into the bad customer service I received. In all of my travels, I've never seen a more incompetent  staff, then here. 

On another note: the room was nice. I was expecting dirty old gross Vegas but that is not what I received. The casino was very modern. The pool had a shark tank in the middle which was really cool. You could even water slide through the middle of the sharks. This place wasn't what I expected. It's just sad that the customer service isn't there. I score hard on being treated nice and the Golden Nugget failed on every level.

Chef Eddie Matney is doing something right at "Eddie's House."

I'm not sure why it took me so long to go visit him, but now that I've been, I for sure will be hanging out there again soon.  We really did feel like we were hanging out with Eddie in his living room.  We sat at the bar where Valerie was the bartender / server and gave us honest answers to all of our questions about the menu. We also made friends with Victor and Bob - the other guys sitting at the bar while we dined.  Jared even went so far as eating one of Victor's "sweet chicken lollipop drumsticks" and half of Bob's "chocolate chip cookie tiramisu."  In addition, we did order our own food...
We shared two appetizers (great deal during happy hour - all half off as well as half price glasses of wine)...  Scallop carpaccio and "Jacob and Gabriella's favorite edamame."  (Jacob and Gabriella are Eddie's kids by the way).

From there, Jared had one of their specials - short rib and prawns.  The prawns (of which I stole one to taste) were crazy big, cooked just right, and very tasty.  I went with a half order (love that they allow you to do that) of the sea bass which comes with broccolini.  It was the perfect size... and delicious.  The sea bass melted in my mouth!  I didn't even share a bite with Jared 'cause I loved it so much!  

Of course, we just had to get dessert as well... and despite Valerie suggesting otherwise, we chose the apple pear cobbler a la mode.  It was good but a bit doughy.  We'll have to stick with the tiramisu or try the orange cheesecake instead next time.

Chef Eddie himself came out of the kitchen and socialized with us several times during our meal - i love when a chef is personable like that.  We noticed he was doing the same with other guests as well.  The rest of the staff was extremely attentive and friendly to boot.

Oh, and a few more things to note about Eddie's House: the decor is warm and welcoming, very comfortable bar stools, a flatscreen TV at the bar, an outdoor patio, cool ass fly fishing photos in the men's room (according to Jared), and take out is available... I saw one guy take-out for his entire family while we sat there!

We can't wait to go visit Eddie again - hopefully sooner rather than later!

Del Frisco's is as good as it gets in my opinion.  

With some serious dieting ahead of both Terri R and I, a weekend of cheat meals filled our calendar.  I have to be honest, I originally wanted Ruth Chris but they were booked this evening.  So, I ended up making reservations here solely based on other Yelper's reviews.  Great choice Mel! Pat myself on my back time. 

First of all, service was top notch.  It all started with the lovely and very nice, Priscilla.  From start to finish, she was delightful, helpful, and made our dining experience that much better.  Along with great service from Priscilla, we received the same type service from everyone serving the food.  This place is stacked with employees that go out of their way to make you feel like you and your date are the only ones in the restaurant.  Your unsightly empty dishes are swept away with the quickness and they even clean up around you with their handy dandy table swifters.  All this pampering during dinner and you wouldn't even notice it until they're gone

Now for the food.  We got their Prime Pair, which is their $49 per person Prix Fixe. This is a special only running through Labor Day so hurry up peeps.  This is a great deal. 

Prime Par (Prix Fixe)
1.  Salads:  You get your choice of salads from their Del's, Wedge, or Caesar.  We both got their Caesar. Although it was good, it was a just a beast to eat since it wasn't chopped.  Terri worked her way through the salad and I didn't because I thought it was too much work. Not docking Del's because you don't go to a steakhouse and review their salad. 

2.  Dinner Bread:  Nothing special here.  You get a loaf of their sesame bread.  For a place that serves quality food, the bread was less than average.  But again, you don't come to a steak house for bread.  

3.  The entree is an 8 oz hand cut Filet Mignon with your choice of crab cakes, shrimp, or scallops.  I had the crab cakes, which is drenched in lobster sauce.  My goodness....this was delicious.  Terri had the shrimp and she said it was delicious as well.  She offered, but I was focused on my meal.  Now for the filet mignon....this was the 1st highlight.  Great tasting filet, high protein, and tasted like any other top notch steakhouse out here.  I mean it.  This steak can give Ruth Chris a run for their money and it's probably a tad healthier since it's not drenched in butter.  Their steaks didn't have that melt in your mouth feel, but it did have that taste of a well prepped filet. 

4.  Sides:  You also have a choice of sides that included potatoes, spinach, mushrooms, and corn. We got the potatoes, mushrooms, and for an additional cost, added their Lobster Mac N Cheese.  The 2nd highlight to this evening had to be their Lobster Mac.  Creamy/cheesy mac, lobster chunks, and a hint of lobster sauce describes this. Tough to explain, but it's probably the best lobster mac that I have ever had.  

Overall, I am giving Del Frisco's 5 stars because I expected just an okay, above average dining experience and obviously got more.  I was so consumed with my beautiful date and superb dining experience, I even forgot to snap a few photos.  But at a place like this, photos would just ruin the experience anyway. 

Looking for filet mignon, a great dining experience, and somewhere off the strip...look to Del Frisco's.  You won't be disappointed.

By now, I think we all know that Americans like to eat and we like to eat a lot.  Our cities seem to compete to see who can claim "fattest city" like it's a prize and once they receive the title, it dawns on them that gee, maybe they have a problem and should encourage their residents to stop stuffing their faces with deep fried fat droppings.  So, it's no wonder that after our delicious meal at French-inspired, smaller portioned, L'Atelier, we Americans were left craving more food, in hopes of having to roll our newly rotund selves out the door.  

I dined at L'Atelier during Restaurant Week.  For the occasion, they offered a special 4-course tasting menu.  It began with an amuse-bouche that set the stage for a fantastic meal.  Don't ask me what it was called, 'cause I'll butcher it. What I can tell you is that it was layered with cream and lobster essence.  With each spoonful I could taste a different, delightful flavor. The chef got was off to a great start and my bouche was amused (sorry, I had to).  The first course was a gazpacho.  My tomato-hating heart fell at the sight of gazpacho on the menu.  Why, someone please tell me why, people insist on trying to make me eat pureed tomatoes?  Do you want me to be sick?  Why not just throw some mushy okra innards in there to put me over the top?  Don't you want me to be happy?  But, I decided to suck it up and try the gazpacho.  I have to admit, and remember this is coming from someone who'd rather throw tomatoes at Dane Cook than eat them, it was pretty damn good. I only took a couple of sips and then pushed it away, but if you can make me appreciate gazpacho, you've done your job.  

The second course was by far my favorite - the langoustine.  Oh crustaceans, how I love to eat thee.  I'm sorry, but I do.  I was in heaven.  A lightly, tempura-style, breaded strip of langoustine along with a basil pesto.  We were only served one each, much to my dismay. In fact, my dismay was so strong that each time I saw a server walk by with langoustine for another table, it was all I could to do keep myself from lunging at him to grab it off the tray in one quick dive.  But, I must be a lady, so I refrained.  Also, I wasn't dressed for lunging and diving, it would be even less appropriate if one of my chest balloons fell out in the midst of a food grab.  

The third course consisted of the smoothest, creamiest mashed potatoes I've ever tasted - they practically melted in my mouth.  Accompanying the pommes was a perfectly seasoned beef rib-eye.  When I say perfectly seasoned I mean that I didn't have the urge to be uncouth and ask for steak sauce.  It wasn't necessary.  It was so good that I was almost tempted to eat the fatty portions of the beef and the thought of eating fat disgusts me, but I had to have more.  Forget being ladylike, I ate some of the fat and when I noticed that one of my friends didn't finish his potatoes, I asked if I could have them. Oh yes, I did.  

For the final course (tear), we were served a souffl with pistachio ice cream poured down the center tableside.  The souffl wasn't my favorite - it was done very well, very light and fluffy - but, it just didn't wow me.  I did enjoy the pistachio ice cream on the other hand; it was an inspired combination.

The presentation was picturesque.  I loved the atmosphere at L'Atelier - it was warm, cozy and swathed in dark red.  It was upscale without being stuffy.  Our server was accommodating (substituting lactose-free items for the milk-hating stomachs), and informative (explaining to the less experienced foodies like myself, what exactly a langoustine is).

Thus, while I and some of my dining companions left L'Atelier wanting more, and ruminating over the porkiness of Americans, I would definitely love to return, and perhaps wear some clothing more suited for food diving.

Whenever I get the inkling to play poker, this is one of my favorite places to play.  The decor is ornate yet sophisticated, crowded yet intimate, intimidating yet accommodating.  Where else are you gonna be able to find a poker game in town where Johnny F-ing Chan is standing a few feet from you chatting with the floor manager as you sip on an expresso, proceed to call down an all-in river bet after flopping the nut straight, and throw a few chips from the two stacks of high society that you just raked in to order Thai food from a restaurant within the Aria resort to be delivered table side?   Sounds too much like a deleted scene from Rounders but inevitably a true story starring yours truly, thereby prompting me to pay homage to one of the great poker movies by throwing in a few related quotes from Teddy KGB.  

"Mr. Son of a Bitch, let's play some cards!"
Offering a variety of game options ranging from 1-3 no limit and pot limit Omaha to higher stakes in the Ivey Room where you will likely spot a recognizable pro on any given day, there is constant turnover of players ranging from all levels of skill.  There is also a daily no limit hold-em tournament that starts at 7PM where first prize typically takes in a few thousand dollars and the top 5-6 get paid out on a $125 entry fee. 

"Just like a young man coming in for a quickie, I feel so unsatisfied"
Need some distractions from the cards?  There are multiple flat screen TVs broadcasting various sporting events and the sports-book is a few yards down if one needs to place bets.  The room has an open structure where one has an unobstructed view towards the entrance for people- watching as folks heading to and from the nightclubs stumble back and forth.  Unlike a lot of the other smaller poker rooms, the majority of the servers and a few of the dealers here are quite easy on the eyes (just saying). 

"Want a cookie?"
 If you need to refuel with food, Five-fifty pizza is a few doors down for a nice hearty slice and the Jean Phillipe patisserie is also a short walk for gelato, pastries, and packaged sandwiches/salads.   If you want to stay at the table, you will be hard-pressed to find the variety and quality of dining in any other poker room in town delivered to your seat with a cheesecake factory-like menu that offers a smorgasbord of options from various Aria restaurants on the premises.  Just be sure your eating habits don't serve as a tell when you have a monster hand like Teddy KGB crunching his Oreos.

"In my club, I will splash the pot whenever the fuck I please."
Complimentary drinks!  You can customize your coffee whether it be cappuccino, mocha, espresso served with a classy rock candy sugar stick in a hard mug (although you can request a plastic cup as well), or choose from a variety of sodas and juices including pineapple, watermelon, and  freshly pressed carrot (a few bucks extra), as well as Fiji bottled water, Perrier sparkling water, and I've seen a range of spirits ordered ranging from beer and tequila shots to red wine and cognac (these are the players you need to get in a hand with especially after they've knocked back a few, remember the words of Mike McD "it's immoral to let a sucker keep his money").

"Hanging around, hanging around. Kid's got alligator blood. Can't get rid of him"
Be sure to check in with your Mlife card since 2-3 dollars gets credited to your card with every hour of play, which can help comp for some of the meals above.  A masseuse is also available at an hourly rate on the premises to massage your backside as you play  if your back starts feeling the strain of a long session on the felt.

"That's a position raise.  I call"
Pro-tip: the weekends can often get very busy with long waiting lists.  If you call the number on the the yelp page, they accept calls to be placed on the list before you arrive in person.

"Nyet! Nyet! No More! No! Not tonight! This son of bitch, all night he, "Check. Check. Check." He trap me!"
The poker room is located within a short walk of the self-park lot so be sure to park on the 2nd floor for the shortest path to the tables as well as to minimize your walk of shame on those nights you are delivered a bad beat or on tilt.  

"Respect is all you have left in the morning!"
For any poker player, this is a quintessential Vegas experience where you get the opportunity to partake in exciting gambling action, great food/drink, people-watching and celebrity sightings, and hopefully a cinematic story to take home regardless of where the chips may fall.

1/19/10
Went in for my first salon coloring!  (2009 was the first time I had my hair lightened.)  Parking lot was empty, but it was raining hard, so I wasn't surprised... Besides me, I think there may have been only one other client, back in the coffee/tea room.  Again, not a big deal, since I don't like crowds.  After checking in for my appointment, I was invited to sit down in the waiting area.  I found the wait pleasant- the area was tidy and cozy, and the music peaceful.  If you like to rummage through books and magazines, or look at hair and body products (and whatever else you may find for sale at salons), you won't have to look very hard here!  You'll find something to keep your mind busy, but I like to take the time to de-stress.  The receptionist offered something to drink, which is always nice!

After meeting up w/ my hairstylist/colorist, she showed me where to dress down to my comfort level and put on a robe.  Yes, it wasn't a plush robe, and it made me feel uncomfortable, as it wasn't very flattering, but no one was around to see me, anyway, so I didn't care :)  After finding my way back to my colorist, we discussed about the results I wanted to see and feel, and she then told me what procedures she would take me through and how long each phase would take.  I found her a good listener and felt comfortable that she knew what she was doing.  I'm not much for talking while at salons, and I sensed that she knew this, but when I would speak up and ask her questions, professionally and personally, she was open to talking, as well.   I found this refreshing, bec. I've met quite a few stylists throughout the years that act slighted or mad when I'd rather not talk...
 
The results were fantastic!  My stylist didn't lie- the products she used made my hair very shiny and silky to the touch (some things that were lost due to the color-stripping), and the fact that it took awhile (from a few hours to a few days!) for others to realize that I had colored my hair back to brunette (I had caramel, blonde, and red high- and low- lights) is testimony that the coloring looks natural!  (Actually, the color she gave me is the darkest I've ever had my hair- darker than my natural haircolor.)  Many people did comment on how much weight I've lost, which isn't fact, so I attribute all the compliments to my darker hair :)

Easier to access than Tempe's Moodswings (free parking!) and none of the snobbery one can find at other salons.  Less expensive than comparative salons, too!!  Friendly and knowledgeable staff, comforting and welcoming ambience... Give Spa Lamar a try!

BTW, every first Wednesday of the month, Spa Lamar holds "Live at Lamar," a "happy hour" of sorts, from 6p to 9p there's live music, light apps (nothing fancy, just something from the grocery, I'm told), and perhaps cocktails.  MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, if you bring a friend who's never been to Spa Lamar, services are BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE!  That's right, you read correctly!  What are you doing this coming First Wednesday?  Hmm... I'm not sure, but I think something quite special is on the calendar...  Guess I'll catch this Spa Lamar special NEXT month!

We go to Vegas a lot and usually have always stayed at the larger, flashier hotels, but this time, I decided to try out the Westin. I'm usually a huge fan of the Westin and although this particular location isn't as nice as the majority of them worldwide, it still has all the fixings which I love about the Westin.

Check in was a breeze and friendly. It didn't take much time at all before we were all headed up to our room. I like the fact that this was a smaller hotel and that we didn't have to walk forever to get to our room. The other redeeming factor was that it didn't smell like smoke. Smoking is allowed in the casino area, but since it's so small, you don't have a host of people hanging out anyway.

Between 5 and 7pm, there is a complimentary happy hour for all guests. You can go down to Suede restaurant and enjoy wine, beer, snacks -- all unlimited -- for 2 hrs. We went down and got some fruit, cheese, chips and they had some pretty tasty wine available as well as various beers and soft drinks.

Later, we were making tea in our room and ran out of tea bags, cups and water (they give you Nestle bottled water for free to make tea and coffee with) so we called housekeeping and within 5 mins they had brought us some more.

The Heavenly bed is out of this world -- I just dozed off in the middle of the afternoon enveloped in its comfort. The shower is another plus with its signature 2 shower heads.

We did have a problem with the AC as it wouldn't register any lower than 72 degrees. I had set it to 65 degrees before we left to go out for dinner and when we returned, it was the same temp. So I again called downstairs and they sent an engineer within 5 minutes. He brought us a bar of chocolate -- how awesome is that?

He changed the filter and fixed the problem and was out the door in less than 10 mins. The room remained cool for the whole night. 

So for me, this was an awesome experience. The service was out of this world. My previous experiences with other hotels is that you can call them, but they won't arrive for at least 15-20mins. I would definitely come back again the next time we visit Vegas. I'm done with all those kitschy flashy hotels.

Oh, and winning money at the casino was another huge plus!!

4.5 stars!!!

First and foremost this is my first review and I cant believe how absolutely appalled I am.  But, here it goes.....So my wife and I are in town for a family emergency and decided to have lunch because we had a lil time on our hands. We drove past HAG on LV blvd and it caught my eye because of the name and I love a great burger. Upon entering I was excited and looking forward to it the place seems almost like a Hooters but for Burgers. The smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicky for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear items that others have wore before but I figured hey WTH the waitress we had was very personable and  nice but was new. the prices were very high for such a simple menu. My wife ordered the smallest burger and fries and I was talked into the Quad bypass burger. with like 20 strips of bacon! I asked our waitress if the restaurant offered military discount as I often do when I am on a budget and travelling. She said "Let me ask" upon returning she said "No sorry" I was thanked her for asking. Either way I though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so I was looking forward to the food regardless. At this point I was very excited and amused on the place and was talking to my wife about how this place should/would be a goldmine. They offered malt liquor (Strange in a restaurant)in a can I ordered a Tecate she a sugar Coke.
Now for the twist of events..... Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes which is great but I was skeptical, The Burger was massive and looked so good but it was warm to the touch at best I had approx 3 bites and noticed the bacon looked as if had been microwaved from being cooked days ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistency-(Gross) The cheese was not melted, The fries looked like they were cooked in old oil due to the almost black color in nature. I tried my hardest to stomach this but I couldnt. I proceeded to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cooked to order at first she replied yes and then said something that made me raise an eyebrow, she began on informing me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old because of the way the owner is. I asked her to elaborate and she said he is so cheap that he makes his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut costs. She also informed me she almost walked out her second day on the job because of what he acts like in his day to day operations. She looked excited when I asked to speak to him about the quality and preparation of my food. When the Owner/manager Jon came to the table he sat down opposite from me and was very hostile. At this point I was pretty much amazed I would assume he would address my concerns in a professional and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimidation and apprehension. I said I would please like another burger due to the dissatisfaction of it not being fresh. He looks at myself and my wife and says' " In six years I have never comped a meal and it won't be today!!" I proceeded to inform him I simply wanted another burger and I am not looking for a comp. He then informed us that he would call the police if we didnt pay I said I would not pay for a burger like this especially one that i didnt touch. From his demeanor at this point I wanted to leave so i said look I will pay for my wifes and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this quality of food.
At this point I felt threatened and was basically being held against my own will. I said fine Please call the police. He proceeds to lean over and say, You know what " you started it when you asked for a discount" I was like "What"? He then says I cant stand the "F" ing military I was so appalled that he was addressing me like this in general and then he begins to say, I'm from Oxnard, Ca. and we used to beat the "S" out of filthy mexicans like you! At this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief He leaves and the table next to me were also expressing there disgust in the food and as he saw us speaking with them he said to leave right now we were trespassing! As I leave I attempt to tip my waitress and he rips the money from my hand! My wife and I wait outside for the police THE WHOLE TIME WE are waiting quietly the owner is harrassing us going on a tirade about my race and my occupation being totally distasteful in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up (LVPD) I provide them ID and they are in absolute disbelief they resolve the issue after questioning and bottom line it does not matter the police officer said I had to pay I totally understand and uphold the law but requested that I receive what I pay for (At least I gave it away to a homeless man.
BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: 1. DO NOT GO THERE FOR QUALITY OR FRESHNESS  IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS NOT 2. THE OWNER IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING. 3.YOU ARE WARNED. PLEASE DONT BE ROBBED OR DEGRADED LIKE ME  GO ANYWHERE ELSE.

There's a new burger boss in town - Hooligans is the epitome of the gourmet bar burger! I hear a lot of talk about the strip having some of the best burgers in Vegas, but if you're a local, I would highly recommend that you give this new place a try! 

Insider: Bruce was the former Chef (genius mastermind) of Braddah's Island Style and he stole our hearts with his unique and crazy flavorful sauces. Being that we are sauce junkies, we followed him here (plus his crack sauces are here...) Well, the guy can also cook! He is now the executive chef here at Hooligans, so his menu screams flavor and his unique go big or go home philosophy.

Let's be real, my boyfriend and I came here to eat! We ordered "The Big Mass Burger"($11) - This burger is a beast! It's the biggest and most epic burger I've ever eaten in my life. Ok, imagine this: a massive 2/3 pound burger, glistening in all of it's glory, stuffed with 6 slices of melty gooey-ooey cheddar cheese and 6 slices bacon, finished off with more bacon, melty cheddar cheese oozing all over the place, sauted onions and mushrooms, and...wait for it, in a white wine garlic butter. (!!!) whoa there fancy pants. My mouth just trembled. It's a burger's dream of a burger.

First bite: I made a peck in it (that's how huge it was) and with that tiny peck, I got angry at how good it was! It's the type of delicious where you'd want to curse. Super juicy, seasoned expertly, and did I say juicy? Crazy juicy!!! All of the ingredients danced and sang together. The meat was seasoned like a pro, the grilled mushrooms and onions were super sweet and caramelized, the bun was grilled to perfection and soaked up all of the buttery meaty bacon-y flavor! It was madness. The burger is a masterpiece.

It's simple, Bruce cooks with so much passion and uses high quality ingredients. You don't taste frozen or dried out food here, it's all fresh! He also gets his beef shipped to him from Australia. Hey, we can definitely appreciate a guy that firmly knows what he wants. Also, bartender Dave was great! He was one-man-show'n it that night, but he was efficient and very friendly. He really offered us top notch service.

Other important details:
- Happy Hour 3pm-6pm and 12am-2am: Awesome deals! Half off the $6 food menu and $2.25 well drinks!
- Margarita Drenched Chicken Fajita Quesadillas with Brucie made pico and sour cream ($8) - I strongly urge you to add a side of Bruce's signature sauces (my personal favorite is the guava habanero), try them all and decide what's your winning combo. Now, dunk the juicy and flavorful quesadilla into the sauce and enter food ecstasy!
- Jalapeo Fries ($6) - (they are not potato fries) Super crispy and airy, light tempura battered jalapeo halves, lightly seasoned with cumin and served with Bruce's special cilantro ranch. It's not spicy, but kind of sweet and addicting. Bruce knocked that cilantro ranch out of the park! I'm a ranch snob and this is a grand prize winner. So rich and creamy! 
- Inferno (habanero) poppers ($6) - Great bold flavor...but, be careful, they are deathly spicy! We are avid spice eaters and eat raw thai bird chili peppers on the daily, but these are in a league of insanity. Let this be your warning: Use extreme caution when eating them.
- All of Bruce's famous crack sauces are also available on the menu to enjoy with your burger/ meal for $1 a pop. Try one, (try them all): raspberry sauce, pineapple lime, guava habanero, white noise ghost chili, coconut colada pearl. (pro tip: I love dipping my burgers and fries in all of them, but my personal favorite is the guava habanero)
- Pyrat Candy ($6) - salty pretzel, caramel, chocolate bark..Need I say more? Very naughty.
- If you're watching your waist line and burger intake, they also have lighter fare like grilled chicken, salad and sandwiches - if that's what you're looking for... at a bar. But yeeeeaaah, about that, just go all in and try his carnival creations, they are delicious! 

From one food fanatic to another, this place is a keeper. The entire Hooligans crew cared about our satisfaction and we left feeling 100% taken care of. Come try them out, you won't be disappointed. 

P.S. I'm planning and creating a UYE for Hooligans in the near future! Special yelp menu to be announced! Awesome burgers, refreshments, company, conversation, shenanigans. Let me know if you want in! :D~~

Ahhh Wet Republic, how do I apply for citizenship?  A hand stamp is good for a temporary visa, but I am ready to move in and get a passport!

The first thing you need to know is that this pool is a happy medium between pools like Tao Beach and The Rehab.  It is about 53,000 sq feet of fun (compared to Tao's 18,000 and Rehabs 200,000+)  The entrance fee is reasonable.  I only paid $20 when the gates opened compared to $40 at The Rehab.  The pool area is well manicured similar to Tao, and there is plenty of room to move around, unlike Rehab.

There is still a very solid party vibe at this pool, much more so than Tao, but not the absolute insanity of Rehab.  Take the case of the young girl who couldn't hold her liquor about two hours in.  A few of us were dancing in the shallow end to some Pit Bull and my buddy gets my attention to look behind us at the sidewalk where the staff has a girl slumped over in a wheelchair as they push her towards the exit.  The results of her drinking too much were still visible in her textured hair, which draped over her face like that scary girl from The Grudge.  We all paused in silence with respect to make sure she was physically okay (which she was), then everyone turned back to face the pool, threw their hands in the air and shouted, "Now it's a party!" and continued to jam to Pit Bull.

Now, if it were Tao, I don't think anyone would have gotten sick like that.  If it was Rehab, I am not sure people would have showed as much concern to make sure she was OK, they probably would have just kept partying.  So, you see, a happy middle ground.

The drinks are about the same price as elsewhere, so just call it a wash on that.  The crowd was for the most part very friendly, which is one of the best things about this place.  You could move around dance with different people, and everyone was just having a good time.

The fitness levels are still pretty high, so you want to be beach ready to really enjoy this place.  Plenty of eye candy for guys and girls here.  I have been pretty adamant about not paying high fees for cabanas, day beds, or lounge chairs since I don't think you should go to a pool club to lay around (dance people!).  But this is one place I might actually consider going in on one of those big queen size bed things.  The reason is that they are positioned right on the edge of the pool where a lot of the action is happening.  So you are not missing out much by having it, and if you have a larger group you don't have to worry about a place to put your stuff.  I would consider it at least!

The lifeguards are pretty on top of things here, which I do like.  I got "counseled" about three times so I knew they were doing a good job of keeping an eye on the crowd.  

Oh, the Rehab doesn't allow bags, but this place is extremely strict on any container-like items, which will get confiscated without mercy at the gate.  I guess they have had a lot of problems with people trying to smuggle stuff in, so try to limit what you bring in here, which is probably wise advice for any pool club.  Just the bare essentials.

By the way, I just have to put this out there...Guys, if you have an attractive girlfriend and you go to a place like this, don't sit there and fume all day because the other guys are giving her attention.  I saw a few couples like that and just really don't get their big hangup.  Getting in a fight with your girlfriend when everyone is out there just having fun is probably not the best way to spend the day.  So sack up and move on!

One last tip for scheduling.  Wet is open on Saturday and Sunday.  Rehab is only open Sundays.  Since these offer relatively different experiences, some of you may be thinking of hitting up both over a weekend.  So it makes it pretty easy to go to Wet on Saturday and Rehab on Sunday.  If you throw in a buffet and a nightclub on Saturday night then you are really living Vegas style!

Ok..... Unlike any other yelp reviews I've done I will keep this shorter than usual but as serious as possible......  hmmmm.......

Sterling Brunch is gotta be one of my favorite buffets in all North America.  (Taiwan has some awesome ones but Yelp is not there yet)

Sterling Brunch is located in Bally's Las Vegas and is only available on Sundays from 9:00am - 2:00pm (Typically by reservations only but you may get lucky)  

They got the typical buffet fare ranging from various seafood, poultry, steaks, desserts.  Here's the list:

Seafood:  clam, mussels, salmon (sashimi/cooked), oysters, lobsters, fatty tuna, Uni, king crabs, and  Cavier!  (So the sashimi is flown in from Japan weekly, Lobster are baked half of a 1-2 lbs lobsters, and Cavier is all you can indulge!!!  with those little blintz to go with it! YUM!)

Poultry and Steaks (meat):  rosemary roasted chicken, prime rib, rack of lamb, filet mignon, beef wellington, Beef Oscar (fancy!)

Dessert:  lots of melt in your mouth heavenly desserts that you simply cannot miss out on any of it...

Extras:  Lobster omelet, Gazpacho soup, fresh fruits, other seafood prepared cooked such as seafood Bouillabaisse, etc...

Had my favorite server "Eduardo"!  Awesome guy who worked at the Sterling Brunch for 30 years.... really nice guy who actually prepared us a seafood extravaganza on ice while we get our food!  Tipped Eduardo really good afterwards as he was like the best server we ever had!  (by the way you actually get 2 servers one helps you with everything else the other one make sure your drinks are always topped off perfectly!  Simply awesome!)

Of course.. with a meal like that.. it took us 3 hours to finish but of course that was enjoyed slowly....  Man.. lots of lost lobsters in my stomach and stuff.....Just way too much good stuff...........

Oh oh... get this.. while at Sterling I got this guy who was in front of me wanting Cavier... so when he got some from the nice little Japanese lady who was serving the fresh raw seafood he kept asking for more....The lady wasn't angry or anything but instead, took his plate, opened up a brand new like 120oz of cavier and literally slapped on top of the plate.... In a very nice way!!!  Everyone was floored when they saw that and the big man was a "VERY" happy customer....Seriously.. that Japanese lady was so nice she gave me a bunch of UNI after that as well!  LOL!  Shout out to Eduardo and Little Japanese lady...

Finally... forgot to mention... you want water... it's all Evian only.... FREE!  Then champagne is also complimentary.. which they served only Pierre Jouet!!!  WOW!!! I'm in heaven yelpers!!!  (That was also the reason why we were there for 3 hours.. had about 5 bottles of PJ for about $50 per bottle.....)

The cost is about $85 without Tax and tip.... but I'm telling you... BEST MEAL I'VE HAD EVER!!!!!!

Sterling Brunch.... I can't wait till the day we meet again..................

Oh what a night! Took my date here back on June 13. It was a very special time for me, as I remember what a night.

The lady and I came in on a Wednesday evening and were promptly greeted by the hostess. She asked if we'd like to be seated at a table or in their piano bar; it was open seating. Delighted to hear that we could enjoy our dinner with a little live piano, I opted to check out the bar. 

Oh I, got a funny feeling when we walked in the room. And I, as I recall it ended much too soon. Miffed at having to wait 15 minutes now with no waiter stopping by, we went back to the hostess and asked if we could sit somewhere that had actual wait staff to take our orders. After a quick and sincere apology from the hostess and who I believe to have been the manager, they said they would seat us with their best waitress! They too seemed; or at least acted, genuinely concerned that we had to wait so long. 

Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me. She was everything I dreamed she'd be. Within moments of being seated; for real this time, our waitress had our drink orders and was describing the specials of the day.  We ordered up a bowl of (so-so) chicken tortilla soup.Then went on to a (super fantastic) artichoke / goat cheese flat bread!

The Summer Vegetarian Tasting Salad was out-a-sight, it came with one an awesome tasting taco and it was all veggie! The wife loved the chili relleno, and I found the cedar roasted tofu with mango chutney to be top notch. The "grains of life" as they are listed on the menu was one of the better versions of quinoa I've been served in the valley; light refreshing and one of the best protein sources you can find in the veggie kingdom.

Along with our vegetarian sampler, we shared an order of Wood-Roasted Pork Tenderloin; and oh was it tender. Served up with an amazing creamy herb polenta and one or two other vegetables, this meal was 100% delish.

Oh what a night, this meal was turning out to be. Sweet Surrender, what a night! They served me up a few of those Mini Indulgence Desserts. "Yes, I'll have two desserts." Why not, they're only a couple bucks!

Thanks seasons 52 for turning around an unimpressive start and taking care of what could have been an ugly experience, you guys certainly saved the evening!

I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder, Straining my head around and taking my body under. O what a night! After a meal like this I'll be singing that famous Four Seasons song for a days to come. OH what a night! Doo dit doo dit dit, doo dit doo dit dit. Oh what a night!...

From the first bite I took of their Chinese style baked goods I knew I'd return despite having to walk several miles to and from my hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.  In the world of Chinese bakeries I think Diamond Bakery is pretty darn good and very much comparable to one of my San Francisco Bay Area favorites Sheng Kee Bakery.

Surprisingly I had very little soreness from running in the Rock n Roll Las Vegas 1/2 Marathon just about a dozen hours earlier on Sunday night, and since I considered this a vacation I definitely wasn't about to sit around in or near my hotel like a couple of my friends decided to do.  A long, leisurely walk was in order so I chose Chinatown having never really explored the area before.

After an exploratory visit inside a Ranch 99 Asian supermarket yielded zero results as far as finding something to snack on I came upon the Diamond Bakery and a nice 4 star rating on Yelp.  Yelp friend Matt G and the Las Vegas Yelpers' rating did not disappoint as I gathered an arm full of individually wrapped pastries to take with me on my walking journey.  Everything I tried during my walk I liked from the Baked BBQ Pork Buns to the Chinese Rice Tamales to the Pineapple Buns, and by the time I returned to my room I still had food left over.

I whipped out my camera and captured what I had later in the day.

Japanese Style Hot Dog Bun (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IcOvxejpd5FLFIkj20Opqg?select=Mw5zFwaUWjAwE04lrwRTMA) - I feared this would be a bit salty, but it wasn't at all.  I would easily buy this one again.  It's braided bread dough that forms the bun and houses a quarter inch slice of hot dog inside each braid.  Topped with a crispy layer of cheese my only wish was having some yellow mustard to smear on it.

Red Bean Bun (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IcOvxejpd5FLFIkj20Opqg?select=lQxtG3VxFBndCvv-yVGY7w) - Stuffed to the gills with lumpy red bean paste this was easily one of the best red bean buns I've ever had.  In terms of volume I'm definitely certain there was more red bean than there was bun in this pastry.  Make sure you pop a Beano or two before devouring this one!

Winter Melon Cake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IcOvxejpd5FLFIkj20Opqg?select=3gP1L6c1YWXWtGKTbk3cqw) - The super flaky pastry was very good and the winter melon filling was chewy but rather sweet.  The amount of filling was also quite generous.  I did detect a bit of coconut mixed in with bits of crunchy melon in the filling and that kind of made it a miss for me not really being a fan of coconut.  This was probably the one thing I would not buy again, but 1 out of 6 ain't bad at all.

Welcome to my worst dining experience ever with excellent service. Not even the waiter who worked his ass off could eliminate what a horrible dining experience I just got back from. Normally I let things sit for a bit before writing a review... 

Tonight I am just too astoundingly pissed off to wait. My dining experienced SUCKED

Pro Tip: DO NOT COME HERE OR EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE AN UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER.

First: We saw a cleared table outside which we were waiting to be seated and had stated we were waiting for an outside seat. Well after we waited and the table was cleared and set, at least 15-20 minutes when there was no wait inside (shoulda known something was amiss right here). We were informed surreptitiously that there wasnt a table available outside as it was for a reservation that hadnt yet arrived.

Second: We ordered our drinks and I was excited to get a liter of tea mixed with Vodka. Well if there was any Vodka in my drink, no one, I LITERALLY MEAN NO ONE, could taste or smell it. So I complained and asked for additional alcohol. $13.50 for a drink that is supposed to be a contain a good amount of alcohol, you think you could taste or smell it slightly right? Well yeah they said it was made properly and wouldnt do anything for me so the waiter got me a shot of vodka which i poured into my drink which guess what? it tasted like there was a hint of alcohol at that point.

Third: This was the worst ribeye i have ever gotten. I requested it to be medium. I do not know how, but they were able to cook the middle medium and half of one side was bloodier than extra rare and the other side was medium rare. I had to get A1 to give it some flavor. This is the first time I have had to ask for A1 in a steakhouse in over a year... *SMH* WTH is wrong with you )(*^&^$'s!

Other stuff: My friends who ordered chicken loved it. My friend who ordered the primerib felt his was as bad as mine and it was covered in lots and lots of fat! So much so that my other friends dog is eating great tonight...

The good things: The waiter who took our order was on point, but was hampered severely by the bartender and the kitchen staff. The mini muffins and biscuits were great. The honey butter was outstanding to go with them. 

If you come here prepare to be disappointed or taken advantage of. I was completely and thoroughly unsatisfied with my entire meal. THERE IS NO REASON TO EAT HERE, so dont waste your money, time, or desire to have a good meal. You will likely leave here disappointed unless you order the chicken.

if nothing else Yelpers, please read the kicker at the end. McFadden's is not playing fair with Yelp.

I've been their 3 times as I really wanted to like the place.  it looks great inside and out and they have a really good happy hour and specials each night.

visit one was for opening night (Thursday night).  they ran everything pretty well for as packed as it was.  the passed apps were pretty good.  service was just ok, but expected as it was their first night.

next visit last Tuesday was barely ok.  I confused the bartender with trying to order a Black and Gold.  I guess it's only available at the main bar by the entrance.  She probably should have known this by then, not running around behind the bar then finally asking the other bartender.  
I love Heather and Singing with the Band karaoke.  the karaoke was only thing that kept my interest while I waited over 30 minutes for wings. The wings were pretty good and came with fries.  they are not breaded and I really like the teriyaki sauce.
even with sitting at the bar the service was slow.  my bartender seemed like she had no prior experience, as she relied on her coworker for help often.

my last visit (figuratively and literally) Friday night was even worse.  we sat on the patio.  our server arrived quickly, then got slower and slower, often forgetting drinks.
I ordered the wings again, but this time they did not come with fries. odd.
it took over 30 minutes to get our checks.  one couple was about to walk out, we were going to head inside and let her find us.  she finally came back out as we were getting up.

it seems they hired staff based solely on looks or other criteria.  their lack of experience is overwhelming.

and the kicker:  their marketing manager Gaby sent an email to all their employees blatantly asking them to do Yelp reviews on where they work!!  SHAME!  I posted a copy of the email in the pictures. Pasted  below is the body of the text.

Aloha! I know it's odd getting Hawaiian food in Vegas but apparently, they do have a huge population of Hawaiians, thus the good restaurants you'll find here. Island Flavor is one perfect example.

We started with their very fresh shoyu POKE for appetizers. Half an order is half a pound for $7.25. It's hefty so it really is a steal! Color, taste, and texture of the tuna passed our standards with flying colors. 

With so many good things on their menu, it's rather convenient that they offer you the option to order a MIXED PLATE ($11.25) with two items and a side of rice (white or brown) plus salad or macaroni salad. Kalbi is an extra $1 but trust me when I say it's money well-spent. FURIKAKE CHICKEN and KALBI were my two choices. The chicken had a beautiful sweet and sour glazed exterior with seaweed flakes drizzled on it. Each bite had a good crisp and could make you work on a chew, but in a good way. The Kalbi beef was marinated and grilled to perfection pleasing my tastebuds while getting envious looks from others on the table who didn't order this. I looooove their macaroni salad here so don't be like my sister who opted to get a salad of greens and regretting it shortly after having a taste of my side order. 

The ROASTED PORK are shreds of meat doused with their own version of gravy that is out-of-this-world delicious. The taste reminds me so much of eating "lechon", a Filipino dish which is literally, roasted pork. In addition, their CHICKEN KATSU is remarkably right on the money. The breading was great in all aspects and how everything held together execution-wise was simply perfection. Our server messed up our order and gave us Korean chicken wings instead of the katsu in the beginning but she fixed it right away without even taking back the wings. Their KOREAN CHICKEN WINGS was bone-in with crispy skin outside and juicy meat inside. Flavor profile was good but I've had better. Bottom line, it's free so I can't complain.

It seems like the CHICKEN KATSU LOCO MOCO is the deal here so we also ordered that to share. An order is ginormous just like everything else we had. We only consumed half of it and took the rest home but the rave reviews on this dish is true to its words. A specialty not to be missed indeed!

Their GUAVA CAKE ($5) however was easily almost everyone's highlight on the table including those without a sweet tooth. Pair with it their refillable Kona coffee because there's just no other way for you to end a meal here. Ahhhfreakingmazing! Not only is it pretty in pink but the cake itself is moist and each layer of icing and guava syrup delivered its purpose giving you that tropical flavor you thought you could only get from the islands. Easily the best thing I ate here!

Service was a bit spotty, almost like on island mode but nonetheless they were friendly. With onolicious food, generous portions, and reasonable pricing, it's worth the little drive off the strip. 4.5 Stars!

You wouldn't know it if you saw me, but I'm a girl that can eat. I'm part Samoan so inside this 100 pound 5'2" frame lives a very large and in charge polynesian appetite. 

My BF and I have sworn off buffets but we made an exception during our trip to Las Vegas. It's not that I'm against all-you-can-eat food but I am against the mediocrity that most buffets offer. I'd rather have three bites of something amazing, than thirty bites of something which can best be described as "meh." But when in Vegas I feel as though having at least one buffet is just something you must do. Much like you must see the fountains at the Bellagio. Your trip just would not be complete without it! 

So after scanning the Yelp reviews we decided to go to the buffet at the Wynn. We went with three other friends and after waiting in line for about 10 minutes we were seated. My BF and I strategically planned to eat our weight in Alaskan King Crab legs. I personally feel like that's really the only way to get your money's worth. Eat the most expensive thing you can find until you throw up! I take that back, eat the most expensive thing until you can't even think of eating it for a solid week. 

I waited in line for the crab legs and they were pre-cracked which I thought was AWESOME! Less time cracking legs and more time eating! While waiting in line there was an old Chinese lady who tried to cut and I totally froze her out of the way with two plates and a bowl of butter. Hey, I don't care how old you are, there is no cutting when it comes to crab! She made as though she didn't speak English, but the language of cutting is Universal and that sneaky senior citizen knew exactly what she was doing. I might sound heartless but my own Grandma is totally crafty, so don't even play me woman. I see right thru you and your "Oh I didn't know'" fake liners! Back of the line Grannie!

My BF and I tore through four plates of crab legs and our friends were dumbfounded. When you have hot butter to dip into, anything is possible! I stood up and said "Now that I've got gout, I'm ready to move onto something else." I have to say that everything else I ate was pretty mediocre. How do you top crab legs? It just can't be done. I can say that you should stay away from the tom yum soup station. That stuff was rancid! 

We ended our buffet experience with the dessert station. They made candy apples, crepes, rice crispy treats, creme brulee, gelato, etc. It was great! I had them make me a crepe with peaches and chocolate which was not a 10 but a solid 7. It's a buffet, what do you expect? 

Would I do it again? 50/50 and it would totally depend on how big of a crab craving I had.

Laissez les bons temps rouler!  

To the non-native New Orleans peeps, "Let the good times roll!"  That is exactly what Streetcar Po'boys is doing with their new restaurant here in Vegas.  I actually grew up in New Orleans, the West Bank if you are interested, so I consider myself an expert in NOLA food.  I remember eating po'boys at least once a week when we lived there because they are just what everyone eats.  Why, because NOLA po'boys are AWESOME!  So when I heard about Streetcar Po'boys I had to get down there and check it out ASAP.  I found some great things happening as well.  

Here's whats up:

This little hole in the wall joint is totally legit when it comes to New Orleans style po'boys.  They have all of the NOLA po'boy norms like shrimp, catfish, oyster, muffaletta, and boudin options on the menu for those who want an authentic NOLA meal.  They also have non-NOLA options like grilled cheese, BBQ pork, chicken parm, and tuna salad, just to name a few.  This is great because no matter who you are with, the will definitely find something they will like to try.  

The ingredients are super fresh and many are flown in from Louisiana.  The french bread is from Leidenheimer Baking Company in New Orleans, which is THE bread that made po'boys famous.  It is delicious french bread that has a fantastically flaky crust and fluffy soft insides.  The boudin sausage is from Lafayette, LA, which is right in the middle of Cajun Country and where the best boudin is made.  The shrimp they use are the wonderfully gorgeous Gulf shrimp.  Yum!

The sandwiches all come "dressed" unless otherwise stated.  This is straight out of NOLA and how you order sandwiches everywhere you go.  Dressed means to have lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo on your sandwich.  Very nice touch to thrown in that saying.

They also have tasty sides to go with your sandwich.  Each po'boy comes with Cajun Chips, which are house made potato chips with a yummy Cajun seasoning coating them.  They are really quite good, if I say so myself.  You also get to pick an additional side like french fries, hush puppies, mac n' cheese, beer battered onion rings, to name a few.

Oh, the desserts!  Again, Streetcar is doing it right with their dessert menu.  They have all of the NOLA favorites I loved growing up as a kid like bananas foster, bread pudding, cheesecake, and KING CAKE.  I think this is the only place in Vegas I have ever seen King cake on the menu.  And drumroll please......They make Beignets in house!  Fresh Beignets any time of day is a dream come true right there!  Drool.....

This is a family run place as well.  Gwen, the owner, is almost always there.  She is a true delight!  She came up to us before we were even seated.  As soon as she opened her mouth, we all knew that accent!  She's from NOLA and proud of it!  She is a lovely Southern belle that knows her po'boys!  She was so friendly and went out of her way to make us feel welcome.  We talked to her on and off the entire meal and just had a blast.  She deserves a star all unto herself!

The only "Eh" issue I had was the sweet tea cups.  They use really small cups for their tea.  2 sips and your cup was empty.  Bigger tea cups would be great improvement.  Other than that, this place ROCKS MY SOCKS OFF!

I was so happy after my first visit.  I can't wait to go back and try a dozen more po'boys! 

Really, if you like po'boys or just want to try something new, get down to Streetcar Po'boys because your belly will love you for it!

Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill (which had a Michelin Star in 2008) sits in Caesars Palace along a stretch of restaurants just away from the Casino.  The decor is contemporary but not minimalist; it is upscale but approachable and warm (warm browns and reds throughout the dining area that give it an upscale Southwestern feel).  The high ceilings really open up the room; the seating is comfortable and nice.  Good design throughout the restaurant with an open kitchen and contemporary decoration that is subtle.

The assortment of complimentary bread was just okay though the most interesting look piece (a corn bread muffin with blue corn and jalapenos) was probably my least favorite of the batch.

I started with the crispy quail, which came with a sauce of hot mustard, Ancho chile and Seitz Family Farm Honey.  The quail was breaded and fried, which was a risk because of the little bit of meat that comes with quail.  This one was good though.  The meat was moist and flavorful while the breading was crisp and not greasy (like good fried chicken).

The sauce was good and was bold in flavor--kind of a mix of a spicy southwestern sauce and a sweet BBQ sauce.  The sauce was not too overpowering and was a good compliment for the fried quail.  I wish they would have added some sides or garnishes to lighten the dish up though.

I went with the veal chop and it was a generous portion.  The veal itself was great.  The outside sear was very good and the meat was juicy and moist, which can be hard to do because veal is so lean.  They used a good piece of meat here as well.

The sauce was a mix of horseradish and maple glaze.  Like the quail sauce, there was a bold mix of both spicy and sweet flavors here.  The sauce had a little too much heat though because it kind of overwhelmed my palate.  It was one of those spicy dishes where after several bites, you kind of just taste the burn and have a hard time getting the most out of the other flavors.

The veal chop came with a wild rice tamale.  I am not that familiar with tamales so I cannot speak to how well this one would stack up with others.  The wild rice flavor and texture really came across here (pretty good portion of wild rice).  The tamale itself had a strong corn flavor and was sweet and moist enough (not dry).

The waiter was very professional and knowledgeable about the menu.  Service was good--food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.

Pricing was high, but pricing is high at most Las Vegas restaurants.  The food at Mesa Grill was in a similar price range as Eiffel Tower Restaurant (Paris) and the food here was significantly better.  My veal chop here was actually less than what I paid at Spago in Beverly Hills--I thought Mesa Grill did a much better job cooking the meat to the appropriate temperature though I liked the accompanying sauce and sides more at Spago.

I liked Mesa Grill and would return.  My friend (who is a Bobby Flay fan) was a little disappointed with this one so some dishes may stand out more than others.  The flavors here were quite bold (with strong mixes of sweet, savory and spicy on several dishes) so if you find a lot of fine dining places to be bland or too mild, this might be the one for you.  I do not have that much experience with Las Vegas restaurants, but I would say Mesa Grill would be one of the better ones I've tried.

Valet parking is complimentary.  I have not seen or used a self-parking structure here, but I would imagine they have that as well.

I really enjoy the Sicilian pizza from the Cugino's across town, so when I noticed this location I wanted to check it out. Before walking in, I noticed a sign at the door promoting their current specials. When I saw they offered a 2 slice Sicilian special with drink I knew that would be what I wanted to get. I have been in more than once and the same sign is out front with several different specials on it, but they don't always have them all available. So far each time I have been in (even at dinner time) they don't have any Sicilian ready unless you order a whole pizza. They only have had some regular slices available. When I asked the guy behind the counter about it, he said that it just depends what time you get there and says they sell out quick. If people like it so much why not have more of it ready? Oh well I do agree it's tasty! I ended up getting the 2 slice special with a drink. For just cheese slices it's only $4.99 and with pepperoni it's $5.99 which isn't bad at all. The slices are decent size and like how the crust is thin yet has just the right crispness to it. I have eaten inside, but I have also taken my lunch back to work with me and I like that the pizza is still nice and warm and the crust isn't soggy by the time I drive back and eat it. This is a plus because let's face it, not all take-out tastes the same once you get it home vs. eating it right when you get it. The inside is clean and the employees are friendly. Definitely better than average pizza, so if you are in the area give it try.

This hotel is beyond luxury! Nestled about a mile and a half away from the Wynn and the famous fun filled Strip and directly across the street from Fashion Show Mall is the beautiful luxurious Trump Hotel and a place that I was excited to call home for 3 nights and 4 fun filled days!!

Not knowing where we were staying, I was a bit confused on where we were going after we exited the highway. Took a couple of turns here, a turn there and came upon the biggest tower I have seen (well outside of the city center hotels). There sparking in the night sky was our hotel! Note to guests staying here: There is no self-parking, only valet parking. 

The Valet staff was beyond professional each time we were there, and did not keep us waiting long for our car.

After handing over our keys, we gathered our things and went into the lobby to check in. The door attendant held the door open for us and said Good Evening and Welcome! Wow, a girl could sure get use to this kind of service! Walking into their grand lobby (no joke this was huge... huge as in I could do multiple cartwheels without running into anything).

Big beautiful and bright chandeliers hung high above and the scent of jasmine filled the lobby (as well as the hallways). The front desk attendant was sweet she also welcomed us and asked how our trip was. After checking us in she gave us free bottles of water, explained that there is a resort fee that is charged each day that will allow us to use the internet, have free bottles of water and covered the valet parking as well as access to their fitness area. We were told we would be on the 24th floor in a Suite; she then took the time to come away from her desk and show us where our elevator was. 

This hotel has a swanky looking bar but no casino, which is nice not to inhale the second hand smoke each time you enter or leave.

Now onto our humble suite: 
We were towards the end of the hall, which was nice and we did not have any neighbors to the left or the right of us either! Entering into our suite, we had a private entry into the first door, a mini hallway, then our door and our neighbor's door to the right of us.

Walking into our suite: I do not know what hit the ground first, my jaw, my eyes or ummmm ummm never mind! This place was perfect and fit for a cupcake princess!

It had a living room
An oversize comfortable looking bed with fluffy pillows
A full kitchen with high-end appliances.
Sub Zero Fridge 
Big closets
Hi def TVs in the bedroom, and even a TV in the incredibly huge bathroom (make that a TV in the mirror).
The bathroom had marble floors and was oversized
Shower could host a huge party. The first night we took showers, it took about 15mins for the hot water to kick in...
A nice deep whirlpool tub in the bathroom that could fit two or more!


This suite was immaculate!


No complaints about this hotel, we would totally stay here again! Only thing that happened was around 4:30-7:00am there is a train that passes through and the horn is loud, how loud you ask? Loud enough to wake the dead or the passed out drunk party people!  By night 2, I slept through it. Just be prepared is all!

Ay Caramba!!!!

I Love This Place!!!!

On our last stop through SinCity before heading out to the airport, my friends and I decided to check out this off-strip Yelp favorite. With over 1,000 reviews, Firefly has scored an impressive 4.5 star average out of five, no easy feat I might add!

Well, it goes without saying that I came with high expectations. Luckily, I was not disappointed...whew!

Upon stepping into the bustling restaurant, i heard rhythmic salsa music being played in the background and it had a very familar Latin cantina vibe to it, which felt casual and fun. With lots of red and orange all around my hankering for tasty tapas became even more amplified!

We were seated conveniently by the large window, which let in a good amount of natural lighting (excellent for foodporn) and spacious enough for us to stow our luggage.

Our server was friendly and helpful with the menu and never pushy or rude.  Within moments of ordering, we got some sliced baguettes drizzled with butter and served with pickled olives and a house butter spread. The bread was warm & crisp and house butter was delicious! 

Then came our drinks and tapas!

I must insist that you try the blood orange mojito. You can taste that the blood orange was deeply infused in this amazing drink and the combination of the refreshing mint makes this exhilarating drink all the more enjoyable! Of course, the sangrias here are phenomenal and also a must if you're going to enjoy tapas here, as well.

Now onto the tapas...

Bacon Wrapped dates with smoked almonds red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles were remarkably good! Crisp bacon wrapped around sweet dates and tooped with fragrant blue cheese crumbles is always a winning combination in my book!

Tuna tartare - the marinated tuna had a tangy Asian flare that had hints of soy, lime & chili...enjoyed on crisp taro chips, it was a delicious contrast of textures and flavors that made this tartare a shining success!

Tierra Y Mar Skewers - Grilled Shrimp, Filet Mignon, Chorizo, Salsa Verde - from the plump shrimp to the juicy filet, each morsel on the skewer was cooked perfectly. Tack on the the tangy  kick of the salsa verde and it was a virtual fiesta in the mouth! 

Duck rolls - Crisp and delicious fried wonton wrapped around tender pieces of succulent braised duck and dressed in a very tangy sweet hoisin sauce, almost too cloyingly sweet but overall, very tasty.

Filet Mignon sliders - Served with a very rich Serrano ham, cabrales cheese sauce and caramelized onions this dish was probably the most disappointing as the burgers were cooked well done leaving them without the awesome pink center I love so much. Because they were well done, they were chewier and less tender juicy and flavorful 

Camarones la diabla - Now this dish was a winner! Bursting with bright flavor and beautifully presented in a fiery red sauce, the plump shrimp were generously dressed with a sauce that creeped up slowly but left a spicy kick at the end of each bite...yum!

Ceviche - Loaded with plump shrimp, this dish came with loads of crunchy tortilla chips and buttery avocado. My only gripe would be that it needed some some spice to kick it up a notch. Nothing a lil Tabasco couldn't fix which our lovely server remedied for us upon request.

For dessert - We enjoyed a caramel flan with a lady finger and it was the perfect end to a delightful meal!

Our server also arranged cab service for us which arrived in record time!

I highly recommend Firefly to anyone looking for a great lunch or evening out with friends. The restaurant is fun, the service is friendly and the food is fantastic!

Happy Eats!

This is one of those hidden gem in the strip.  Located in the Stratosphere Towel Hotel and Casino, which is in the north edge of the strip. Getting to this lounge is not easy unless you ask around.  The lounge is located at top of the top of the world restaurant, which is in the 108 floor; this lounge is in 109 floor. The first thing you notice of this lounge is the spectacular view of the Las Vegas.  The entire city of Las Vegas can be view from all 360" angle.  This floor does not rotated like fancy restaurant below.  So the strip and other good view is often been hawk by other customer very quickly.

Early Happy Hour
Half Price Appetizers: 4pm - 7pm
2-for-1 Cocktails: 4pm - 7pm
Late Happy Hour
Half Price Appetizers: 10:30pm - 1am
2-for-1 Cocktails: 1am - 4am

They got happy hour daily, sadly to say their food is bad in this time type of atmosphere.  They said the food comes from the restaurant below, but is hard to believe since the quality is just way off.  It could be we got the wrong chef that night, but several review did point that their food were not good.  I have not try their cocktail, it should be better than the food quality I assume.  We try the Kurobuta Pork Belly, which was super fatty and didn't got the right flavor, it tasted more like left over from lunch.  The Waygu Beef Tenderloin Carppacio was also not fresh and disappoint, The Shrimp Cocktail & Lobster Mango Ceviche was not bad but too small portion.  The best one was the Cheese Plate.

The seat is comfortable but the tablet is very small, this is not idea for big group.  However, is perfect for couple, kids do not allow here. Our ID's were check despite we did not even drink.  The bathroom sink have a mini television, but the lounge there were none.  The real bonus here is that you get to access to the observation desk, I believe this is not the same as those who paid but still provided very nice view.  Definite bring you camera when you get here and enjoy.  Just aware the food is not great, a least in our experience in their happy hour.

I stopped in here for dinner and wasn't disappointed. It's inside Doc Holliday's if you can really say that since it seems more of a next door neighbor to the bar. I figured I would be walking through the bar to get to Maribel's and you can, but the door I went into led me straight inside Maribel's. Hubby and I were greeted right away and told to sit wherever we wanted. Our server was excellent! She got our drink order and brought us some chips and salsa right away. I usually like chunky salsa and this salsa was thin, but it had a lot of good, fresh flavor and the chips were tasty. For $3.99 I ordered a side of Chips and Guacamole and my oh my was it so good! It was made fresh to order and had such great flavor. I'm very impressed at the price of the chips and guac considering it was fresh and the portion was good. If you are a fan of guacamole you must try it here at Maribel's! They have daily specials for just $5 that includes a drink. 

Monday - Chicken Enchiladas 
Tuesday - Carne Asada Tacos
Wednesday - Fish Tacos
Thursday - Carne Asada Burrito
Friday - Chicken Sub
Saturday - Shredded Beef Burrito
Sunday - Hamburger or Cheeseburger

I was there on a Tuesday, so I decided to go with the Carne Asada Tacos. You get 3 tacos, rice, beans and a drink. If you want flour tortillas you can also get that for no additional charge, but you get 2 tacos instead of 3 and our sever said they are bigger than the regular ones. Options are nice! The asada had good flavor and the tacos were filled nicely, especially for the price. The beans were good and the rice was even better. It's awesome that you can get quality food that tastes so good for $5 plus tax and leave stuffed. Inside was clean and they have TV's. I can't say enough about our server. She checked on us often and took the time to chit chat with us for a bit letting us know about other specials and I could tell she was genuinely passionate about the food being served here. They even take phone orders if you don't have time or want to eat inside. I saw several people picking up to-go orders. I don't live in the neighborhood that Maribel's is in, but when I am on this side of town, I will definitely be stopping by for some good grub!

Make sure you come prepared to stand in line here at the Bachannal Buffet. Being one of the more popular buffet's on The Strip, this line can get outright outrageous I heard.  We were lucky this time,  waiting less than 45 minutes, after hearing stories of people waiting 1-2 hours. BTW, you can opt to pay an extra fifteen bucks to enter via the "Preferred" line. Nope, I'll wait. After paying for two, which by-the-way set me back a cool $102 bucks, we were escorted to our seats and invited to start anytime we wished. Ah, my dining companion and I decided we would make a "dry run" through the entire buffet to prepare ourselves for the journey ahead of us. After familiarizing ourselves with the setup, we proceeded to get our food. For me, the first stop was the Asian section. Being savvy enough to discipline oneself to realize that there is one big huge buffet ahead and not to fill up on starch here can be difficult here.  There was a nice layout of sushi and other Oriental delicacies. As I made my way around the buffet, I couldn't help but notice the standard items found in most buffets. People were piling their plates with crab legs, which btw were probably snow crab, really skinny. I think I took maybe two small legs. I made my way to the prime rib, which is kinda how I judge a good buffet. I asked for a medium rare piece, but was a little disappointed in it's being dry. There were other meats, but they looked equally dry also. The oysters are good, though, very fresh. They have a nice display of fish in the display case which made for a great photo op!  The Mexican section was pretty good, but I think the star of this buffet had to be the dessert section. Macarons, cakes, pies, cake pops, even mochi ice cream! A dessert lover's paradise! All in all, I have to give this buffet a three star rating because I felt it was a bit overrated and because the meat section wasn't what I expected. The service was fair, although I noticed towards the end of our meal it got slow and our drinks went un-refilled... Would I go back? Probably not, I did want to try the brunch one day though. I think for the money, there are other better choices in Vegas.

What an amazing experience I had while at N9NE Steakhouse at the Palms! If you haven't visited this place yet, set a date as soon as possible! I can't wait to go back for round 2!

Here are the highlights:

1. The hostesses are actually nice! This seems so rare in the fancier steakhouses.  It was a nice way to start the night.

2. Awesome bartenders and strong drinks!  We actually arrived a bit early, so we headed to the bar for a cocktail.  It turns out it was Ladies Night, which is every Wednesday.  They had several drinks for $5 and apps for $9.  Not too shabby!

3. The atmosphere is beautiful! The GM, who stopped by our table to chat, told us it was recently remodeled.  It is very pretty and the new booth seating is quite comfy. Nothing is better than great food and being comfortable as you totally pig out! 

4. OhMyGoodness the FOOD!!!!! We had some awesome food on this visit.  I think I got pictures of almost everything, but they don't do the food justice.  Everything was fantastic! I am still thinking about my amazing Classic Ribeye and the Hot Potatoes Austin Gratin.  Of course, the memories of the Crab Stuffed Mushrooms, Potato Gnocchi, Creamed Corn, and Buffalo Chicken Wontons keep fighting for space too! Ok, I just drooled on the keyboard!

5. OhMyGoodness the sommelier and the wine pairings for the night!  I am totally not a wine person.  I have never really acquired the taste for wine, so I usually just skip it all together.  This night though, we had an awesome sommelier take care of us for dinner.  He made me totally rethink my stance on wine! We started with Pierre Joliot Champagne to celebrate some fun stuff going on in our lives right now and then it just keep coming.  I can't remember the names of all of the of other wines we had, but they were all fantastic! If you have the chance, ask for Marco and his sommelier services for the night.  He is totally worth it!

6. The desserts! We had the Banana Pudding Pie and the S'mores.  Both were so fun and yummy.  I would have to recommend the s'mores though because it was so much fun!  You get fire at your table, in-house made marshmallows in plain, strawberry, banana, and chocolate flavors, and graham crackers already loaded with chocolate! Yummy!

7. We even got to meet the Chef! It's always so much fun to have the Chef come out to meet you.  Nice touch N9NE!

8. I almost forgot to mention the Barnaise!!! I love love love Barnaise sauce.  The Barnaise sauce here was ah-ma-zing! My sister and I were fighting over the last drop.  The other three sauces were tasty and I would recommend you get all four and play around with them, but the Barnaise is definitely the best of the four!

9. And last by not least, the service! Our server was fantastic! Everyone we encountered through the meal was great.  Everyone was en pointe and giving 110%.  This is really what sealed the deal on this fabulous meal.  We felt like royalty the entire meal!!!

This meal was easily in my top 5 of all time.  My sister and I had such a great time! I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone that would listen to me!

This is my review of mine and my husband's experience for my birthday on May 1st, 2013. I am upset to give The Cosmo a two star review, but based on my experience with the check-in process and having a suite here I cannot give anymore. I have been a fan of Cosmo since it opened. I've spent a lot of money here. I'm a local and I sing its praises to out of towners all the time. But I will NOT be recommending for any of my friends (local or otherwise) to actually stay here.

We arrived early (just about an hour) prior to check-in time and we were greeted by a very nice, chipper young lady who set about getting our information. First off, we had just made the reservation the day before, so we were absolutely sure it was there. The girl typed in our name repeatedly to no avail. My husband whipped out his phone and showed her our email confirmation so she could look it up by the confirmation number instead. TA-DA. There it was with our last name misspelled. Hurray. At least we were smart enough to bring our confirmation with us or else they probably never would have found our reservation to begin with. 

They have our reservation for the Terrace Suite for one night. She asks us if we're there for business or pleasure and I say it's my birthday and we're locals and we just wanted to get a room for the night and play by the pool. She seems okay with that and continues tapping away, then she excuses herself and brings forth some other guy in a suit. O HAI guy in a suit, what do you want? He introduces himself and shakes mine and my husband's hand. He then proceeds to chastise us and shame-shame us for being locals and getting a hotel room for a night.

"It's our policy to inform locals that our rooms are not meant for loud, raging parties. We expect you to be courteous to the other guests. After all, there are plenty of other places to have a good time here in the resort."

OH. OKAY GUY IN SUIT. I'll try not to have a raging balls-to-the-wall party in my room since you've wagged your finger in my face before I even check in.

What gets me is that he specifically said it's policy for them to inform LOCALS. Because, well, guess what locals? Cosmo doesn't want your business if you're just there for a night for your birthday with your husband trying to enjoy a suite and have dinner with your friends. Seriously. I was so incensed by this guy I didn't know what to do besides awkwardly laugh at his remarks.

He then goes on to ask if we're "in the industry". 

No. I reply. I work for the federal government and my husband is Air Force. 

"OOOOH" says guy in suit, "Thank you for your service."

YAH. Fuck you. You were just giving us a lesson in how we should conduct ourselves in our room that we're paying good money for, GUY IN SUIT. How about you fuck off with your "thank you for your service".

I've never been treated that way when I've checked into any hotel before on the strip. I've never been shamed because I'm a local. I've never been given a talking to by some random guy just because I happen to be local and I happen to just be getting a suite for the night. I think it was ridiculous. I think it was rude. And I think The Cosmo does a whole lot of assuming about their guests.

Well I guess my young appearance my tattoos must have just sent alarm bells ringing up the asses of these people.

So our check-in process basically sucked and I am sad to report how far it dropped The Cosmo in my eyes.

Our room - Terrace Suite, 28th floor, facing the Bellagio Fountains. Amazing room, full kitchen, living area, wrap around suite, plush bed, interesting artwork. Lighting that goes completely on and off when you leave the suite. A tub that could have been much bigger in my opinion and a decent enough bathroom. We didn't call for room service, so can't comment. 

We DID have my 4 friends come up to the suite AFTER we had dinner. We all fuckin jumped all over the beds and turned over tables and lit a fire in the trash can and brought in a fuckin tiger from Sig & Roy's Magical Garden and we fucked that place up. OH JUST KIDDING. We watched the fountain show, hung out, had champagne, talked, and had my birthday cake while I opened presents. Afterward my LOCAL CRAZY MUTHER EFFING FRIENDS left and my husband and I watched TV and went to bed. OH MAH GAWD.

Anyway, that's my experience at The Cosmo. Not so good, eh? Dearest locals - go elsewhere, lest you be chastised before you even get a chance to enjoy.

***Olives is a nice upscale lunch option in Vegas; Olives also offers a great view of Lake Bellagio***

The first time I tried Todd English's cuisine was at the LA Food and Wine Festival.  His station put out a very nice plate of Asian marinated steak (great marinade; tender and juicy steak), buttery beet risotto and a great cold corn and cream relish.

After this, I was eager to try one of his restaurants.  I did try Todd English PUB next to Aria, but it was not that great.  Todd English PUB is casual gastropub fare.  His Olives restaurant (a version of his flagship restaurant) is not really fine dining or formal, but it is much more upscale.

The food at Olives was significantly better.  There was a complimentary breadbasket, which consisted of addictive flatbread crisps, flavorful caramelized shallot topped focaccia and just okay ciabatta rolls (accompanied by olives and two kinds of olive tapenade).

I started with the spring pea mezzaluna, which was heavily garnished with spring peas, haricot verts, mushrooms, baby pea shoots, Parmesan, and a truffle burro fuso sauce.  I really liked the spring pea mezzaluna (kind of like pea ravioli).  The pasta was very thick and had a good flavor.  The pea filling was good--creamy and lightly sweet with a good pea flavor.

Though there was a lot of stuff on top of the pasta, I liked it.  I think less stuff on the plate would have made the really good pea ravioli stand out more, but the mushrooms were good and earthy.  I liked the freshness from the pea shots and haricot verts.  The truffle burro fuso sauce was not too heavy or rich, but it was definitely a thick sauce.

With all the components on the plate (and especially several traditionally salty ones like Parmesan), this pasta dish was still balanced in terms of seasoning.  That being said, this was a dish with a few salty notes that popped.  I think if the kitchen is not careful, this can become an overly salty dish.

For my entre, I had the sea scallops, which were served over a roasted tomato caper risotto and topped with a shaved fennel and frisee salad (the plate was also garnished with green pea puree).  The scallops were good.  They were big, fresh, plump, and moist.  They got a nice caramelized outside on the scallops and they were not too salty.  One of the scallops was not cleaned that well (a little bit of grit).

I liked the shaved fennel and frisee salad, which gave some lightness and freshness to the dish.  I also really liked the green pea puree--sweet, great pea flavor, creamy, and very smooth.  I am not a huge fan of risotto with entrees (especially since so many places overcook the rice).  The risotto here was fine; it had a good flavor and was creamy; still, the rice was overcooked and did not have the bite it should have.

A lot of the desserts on Olives' dessert menu seemed like standard stuff.  I am not sure if Olives would be the best place for a creative and ambitious dessert.  I had the banana tiramisu and it was a satisfying end to the meal though it was not that special or distinct.

The banana tiramisu consisted of banana mascarpone cream, banana cake and a Kahlua sabayon.  The tiramisu cake was garnished with a chocolate sauce.

The dessert was creamy and mostly moist (the cake could have been a little more moist).  There was also a great banana flavor.  Unfortunately, the coffee flavor was quite mild.  You do not get that espresso-soaked cake/ladyfingers flavor here that you get at other places.

Service was very good.  My server was pleasant and friendly.  He was also knowledgeable about the menu as well as polite and attentive.  There were a few gaps in the meal; the first course should have come out a tad quicker.

Prices were not too bad for lunch.  Olives is definitely serving an upscale lunch and considering that Olives is in Vegas, the entrees (priced in the mid-$20s) did not seem too expensive.

Olives also offers a nice outdoor dining atmosphere for lunch.  I did not think their indoor dining area was that inviting.  It had a contemporary and comfortable dcor, but the lighting was too dim for lunch.  The outdoor dining area is great.  The patio overlooks Lake Bellagio (and you get a special fountain show--the first of the day at noon).

With the view and the comfortable patio, Olives is a great spot for outdoor dining (and unlike the outdoor dining spots on The Strip, Olives' dining areas feels much more private and relaxing).

The only problem with the outdoor dining area is that they allow smoking.  Fortunately, there was only one couple smoking, which was slightly bothersome.  If more were smoking though, I think it would have been an issue.

A lot of upscale restaurants in Vegas are not open for lunch, which increases the value of a restaurant like Olives.  The food at Olives is good--maybe not as good as some of Vegas' fine dining spots but definitely a significant step above the cafes serving lunch in Vegas.

Free parking via Bellagio's structure.

The Palazzo and the Venetian are exactly what you expect a Las Vegas Hotel Room to be.  If you look around the room and think to yourself, I could live here and be happy, then you know you are staying in the right place.  All the "basic" rooms are suites with a step down into a living room with sectional couch, desk, and table.  If you want to hang out in a nice room with friends and have a few drinks, then this is your room.  3 flat screen TVs (Living room, Bedroom, and yes in the bathroom).  The marble bathroom has a nice soaking tub and glass shower.  Private room for the toilet as well and dual sinks.  The beds are very high quality with high thread count linen.  Only the Wynn has better beds IMO.  The window drapes are nice and thick if you want to sleep in.  They are also push button automated.  It's a feeling of power to push a button only to reveal the Las Vegas Strip and it's night life below you.  It's the best basic room you will find in Vegas bar none.  5 stars.

For me the pool while nice, isn't on the right side of the hotel.  If you enjoy morning sun, you won't get it here.  Of course this depends on the time of year, but with us staying here in April, only 1/4th of the pool had any sun by 11 am.  Most of the time when we would leave the pool around Noon or 1 for lunch, the pool area was still shaded by the hotel.  Pool side drinks were also a shadow of the quality you get at the Wynn and at the same price tag.  The frozen drinks aren't made to order.   3.5 stars for the pool.

One disadvantage to staying at a high end hotel are the black jack tables.  They aren't cheaper than $15 min.  If your gaming strategy involves putting more money on the table while you are winning, well it's not hard to often have a $45 hand and have to double down.  Now you got $90 on one hand of blackjack.  It can go south real quick if you don't show restraint.  The guy sitting next to me, was playing 3 hands at a time and must have lost about $5,000 in a matter of minutes.  So If you like stumbling downstairs from your room right into a reasonable priced casino, perhaps the Monte Carlo is more your speed than the Palazzo, Venetian, or Wynn.  That said, all the dealers were friendly.  If you are going to lose money, a nice smile and conversation from the guy pulling 6 card 21s to ruin your double down does go a long way. 4 stars for the casino

At first the parking seemed to be crazy here.  It's the only strip resort with an underground garage and not very well designed, with cars getting frustrated trying to get out, it's easy to get mowed down.  But as our stay went on, I realized if you always parked on the bottom floors, you could get a spot right next to the elevators and miss out on all the craziness, so it's one of the shortest walks you'll have from your car to the casino.  Parking 3 stars.

When reading a review about a hotel in Vegas, it's good to know the reviewer's experience with all the strip offers.  Other hotels, I've stayed at are The Wynn, Venetian, MGM Grand, New York New York, Monte Carlo, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, and Las Vegas Hilton.  You aren't going to find the perfect hotel.  Even though I gave the Palazzo 5 stars, they do have flaws.  But feeling you aren't getting luxury for what you pay for, isn't one of them. Just walking around the highly polished luxury hotel will make you feel like a million bucks.

My wife and I were in the area and had this place bookmarked for a while.  It's rare that a J-AYCE reviews are as swingy as Sakana but I was desperate for sushi.  I called them to ask if they were a Japanese owned and run restaurant (semi-important to my wife) and the lady on the other end said "yes" in a super annoyed teenager way like I asked if she was still going out with that guy she met while waiting in line for hot dog on a stick at the Meadows Mall food court last week.

Next thing you know...we see an all Korean staff, hear K-pop music in the air and I am all "eff it, we're starving, let's eat".  It was nice of them to keep all that Kabuki signage up to make the place easy to find :P  I am docking them a star just for that.  

We chose to eat at the sushi bar and our sushi chef was definitely one of the highlights of dinner.  He was personable, funny and asked us random questions throughout the evening like:

Chef: Did you just get married?
Us: No.  It's been over 6 years.
Chef:  Oh.  Just asking because you look happy.

(a few minutes later)

Chef asks my wife: Is it your birthday?
Wife: No it's not.
Chef: Well why else would he take you here?

HAHA

(later)

Chef asks me: Did you do something wrong to upset her?  Did you bring her here to apologize?  Maybe that's why you're here.
Me: (laughing) If I had to do that, we would be at a much more expensive place!

So on to the food.  They had an appetizer called "The Shit".  How could I not order this?  It was kind of a tempura fried California roll with some other ingredients I couldn't make out that came with a side of spicy mayo.  It was ok.  Foie gras wrapped in bacon...that would have been the shit.  

Their pork belly is the BEST I've had at any AYCE.  I had five orders of it.  I thought I was there for fish?

I liked their sashimi plates, fresh oysters and our comedic chef sliced up some special pieces that weren't escolar or had cream cheese in them.  Nice.  Lots of reviewers have raved about the fish to rice ratio and it's great.  I would nigiri my way to fullness if we ever came here again.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 39/100

My boyfriend and I were on a mission to try all of the Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas this weekend! BurGR was our second stop of the trip!

BurGR is located literally right inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel. SUPER easy to get to from the lobby! They have this AWESOME glass window display with a metal structure emitting a bunch of flames all over it. It's really interesting and a great storefront display! They also have a bunch of Gordon Ramsay merchandise at the front such as t-shirts, cookbooks, glasses, etc.

We were able to walk right in and get seated immediately. However, a few minutes after we had been sitting at our table, I looked over to the front of the restaurant and there was a HUGE line! We got super lucky that there was nobody there when we entered at around 11:15am.

The decor of this place is super trendy, modern, and basically a sports bar with all of the large screen TVs on all of the walls displaying football and other popular sports. There are also lots of flames everywhere (I'm assuming are related to Hell's Kitchen) and a photo of Gordon Ramsay.

Waiter service was great, as usual. Our waiter immediately came to us and asked if we wanted to take a look at the drink menu, which is an iPad 2 that they give you to look at. It is an interactive menu that has all of the drinks sorted by category (beers, cocktails, red/white wine, etc.), descriptions of each drink, and even photographs. There's also a tab with Gordon Ramsay's biography and photograph, which I thought was pretty cool.

We ordered two waters, a cup of coffee, and then took a look at the menus. The menus were pretty amusing because they, too, had a giant photo of Gordon Ramsay that surprises you when you first order them :P

My bf and I ended up sharing the Shake #4 - creme brulee pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie. THIS WAS AMAZING! I had seen photos of the shakes on Yelp and was curious to try them because I've never had a shake infused with pudding before. Thanks to this shake, I am a HUGE fan of the pudding + shake combination from now on :) So yummy! The two flavors look separated (with creme brulee on top and oreo on the bottom), but surprisingly when you sipped on it, the flavors were combined and complimented each other very well. I would love to come back to try the other 4 combinations!

As for burgers, I ordered the Uber Cheese Burger (fontina cheese + raclette cheese + goat cheese), and my boyfriend got the American burger (american cheese + butter lettuce + tomato + pickle + onion). As a HUGE cheese lover, my burger was absolutely PERFECT for me! It was literally just the patty + 3 types of cheese, which was exactly what I wanted. My bf nearly inhaled his American burger and said it was super good. We unfortunately decided to skip out on getting fries because we didn't have the appetite to eat that much food! I would definitely like to come back to try the truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries.

When we received our bill, we were given an iPod that had a little survey/questionnaire for us to answer based on our dining experience at BurGR. The Yelp Elite in me naturally reached for this and began answering the questions like crazy :P I thought it was pretty cool how much they integrated the use of iPads and iPods at their restaurant!

Overall, 5 stars for a really trendy, hip atmosphere, great service, and delicious food! I would love to come back during my next visit to Vegas! :)

What an amazing dinner. The service was excellent. I love how the server would repeat the name of each dish before it was served to you. The dining room was romantic but was well lit - it was not too dark or too bright.  

I ordered the Cookbook Tasting Menu ($118 per person)

Before we started our tasting, the chef gave us a sample of watermelon salad w/ goat cheese. It was a good summer salad. I'm not a fan of goat cheese, but i was able to eat it - the goat cheese wasn't too strong, so it was okay. 

So now, onto the my Cookbook Tasting Menu:
1. Osetra Caviar Parfait - it had layers of alderwood-smoked salmon, creme fraiche, and potato shallot cake. This was all topped w/ Osetra Caviar. This was my 2nd favorite course of the whole entire meal. Everything was so fresh that this course got its own sweetness to it. 

2. Tartare of Ahi Tuna - I love how they presented this dish to me. They explained each ingredients and mixed everything together in front of me. This was a good texture dish, you got the freshness from the tuna, the crunchiness from the pine nuts, and the flavor of sesame oil and chiffonade of mint and a pinch of habenero. overall it was a good dish, but it didn't WOW me.

3. Main Lobster Pot Pie - my favorite dish of the night. Originially I thought this dish was going to be small with diced up lobster. But boy was i wrong, the pot pie was a good decent size, it came w/ a good portion of lobster, it was big enough to fill up that pot.  Aside from the lobster it came w/ some vegetables and black truffles. The sauce was so creamy and so flavorful - you can definitely taste the brandy - this was just amazing. It was rich, which made it filling, but oh man, i can eat another one by myself right now.

4. Kobe Beef with seared foie gras - the beurre rouge was an excellent sauce to complement the kobe beef. However the beef and the foie gras was so good on its own that I can do w/o the beurre rogue. It also came w/ two sides spinach and potato cake - those were just okay, the star of the dish was, of course, the kobe and foie gras. 

5. Tasting of Michael Mina desserts - Coconut S'more, was pretty good, but i didn't think it was that special perhaps it's just me since i'm not a fan of marshmallow to start off with. I wish it had more coconut flavor. The Mini Root Beer Float was really good - it had a REALLY strong flavor of root beer. If you like root beer, you will definitely like this sample. Opera Cake was topped w/ this rich dark chocolate ice cream - it was heavenly! i loved this dessert out of the three samples. 

At the end of our meal, they also brought us another plate of cookie sampler with macaroons, brownies, some butter cookies, and what seems to be peach jelly. These were really good! 

This whole meal was an excellent experience. From the service to presentation of each meal to the taste of each dish was just amazing. I enjoyed my meal a lot. 

I'd definitely recommend you order their tasting menu since it's just a few more dollars more than their regular entree and this way you can try other dishes.

First night of the 4 day trip we end up here after discussing Steak and Tits, not a bad combo right? Please read.

$25 Cab ride
Damn this place is far. We get out of the cab and this place looks cool. Okay fine, we go in cause there's nothing else around and the cab took off already.

$30 Cover charge
Umm okay...so I guess it's Tit's THEN steak? I guess. After paying cover we're escorted into the empty Restaurant portion of the joint...um what? The "waitress" tells us not to worry, she'll have a few girls come over and give us some attention. We tell her not to worry cause we're hungry for Steak more than Tits at this point. So she laughs and gets our drink orders....5 minutes go by..10...I'm gonnd look at boobies..15 minutes..WTF did she go to Ireland for my Guinness? Oh there she is! 

She takes our food order...all menu items are ala carte...we all ordered steaks and there was no choice as to the size of the portion we ordered but they were all HUGE the filet mignon being the smallest 18oz!!!! But that shit cost $62!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!!!!!?!!!!! I got a 24oz $48 Rib Eye and the "Waitress" says the portions of sides are pretty big and 1 order should be fine for us all. So we just got:$15 Mashed Potatoes and
$15 Sauteed mushrooms....hopefully it's a huge portion of sides. Plus 2x $12 Guinness. 

So with our orders placed after about 5 minutes the "waitress" brings out some cold bread and butter...our 2nd round of drinks arrives about 10 minutes after we'd ordered them...keep in mind the Food part of this place is empty...We dig into the bread cause we're hungry as hell....

10 minutes later the beer shows up. 
We check out boobs...
5 more minutes...Oooh look that one has got cellulite!....
+10 minutes....*watches old man dry sexin a stripper doggy style*....friend says,"I smell fish or...is that blood?" Back to the table we go.
+20 sitting at table talkin....coulda did this at the room...minus the fishy/blood aroma where we walked by.

"Didn't the "Waitress" say she was going to send some entertainment over to our table?"
"Yeah." 
"Uhh k?"

+5 Food comes "HOLY SHIT!!!" Huge meat is placed in front of each of us who had ordered. It was good too....wait..."who ordered the baby shoe sized portion of potatoes and shrooms???" Fuck it...we eat.

Minutes later, we're all so stuffed we can't walk. The majority of us at the table are straight up carnivores that destroy buffets But damn. This amount of food, so late at night which is placed atop several pints of beer, shots of liquor and who knows what else, isn't good at a strip joint.

We finished eating, pay $685 for 6...yes...$685 for 6...so dumb. Then we go and sit in a corner to chill. After a while a girl comes over and sits on my in process 24oz steak....

"I'm sorry, but no...please. Get off."
"What are you broke?"
"No I'm FULL." 

This happened to a couple more of us and we leave. When Steak ruins tits it's never a good thing. Treasures needs to balance their portions...I'll let you decide on what to make smaller your women or your steak, I like my girls with meat...so yeah please take the hint.

A few weeks ago I was watching an episode of Diners, Drive-ins & Dives and they're doing a feature on this restaurant.   Knowing I would be heading to Phoenix soon AND I don't have German food very often, I bookmarked it, then ask my friends if they want to have dinner here.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=xeRpdNyGlTwF4SNYZ3588A#XdSMeOjMFXkDYkLe9CmVSg

Fast forward to Friday afternoon.  I call and ask if they take reservations, they said yes, so I made one.   We arrived about 15 minutes early and the place is packed!   Come reservation time, they didn't have a table ready and asked us to wait in a "waiting area".   It's a small group of tables at the back of the bier garten.  I figured I might as well have a bier, right?  So I ordered a hefeweizen.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=fGrf2cHDXfDKshCS8vDofA#fGrf2cHDXfDKshCS8vDofA

After about 15 minutes they had a table ready in the "bier garten".   Yes it was cool outside but they had tons and I mean TONS of heaters!   There were three heaters around our table in very close proximity and another heater near the next table about 2 feet away.  We sat down and while my friends enjoyed the heat, I started baking immediately.

SERVICE: All of the staff were very nice!   Our server Jeremy seemed to have very little personality and only smiled once when I made a joke.    However he did do a very good job taking care of us.   I ended up speaking with Rose, the owner.    What a sweet and fun lady!   We chatted about the restaurant and her experience with Guy Fieri and the production staff for the show.   She said they filmed that segment about 6 years ago.

Rose also told me they've been in business for 18 years and at this location for the last eight years.  Her restaurant can seat 300, she has a staff of 22 working the front of house and 12 in the small kitchen.

As we were dining two gentleman came out and started serenading the bier garten with an accordion and a tuba!   Hmm, does two make an "Oom-pah-pah band"?   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#Xg7Kg3cwQvevC0BJMIuXbA
They starting with "roll out the barrel" of course, and continued with a number of other bier drinking songs and Christmas songs for a good 30 minutes.   For me anyway, it made the whole evening that much more fun!

FOOD:  We started with a giant pretzel!   It was warm, soft and very tasty!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#2s8FvkPpB0J_OGZSxDiYHA  (notice my phone for a size reference)   I really wanted to try 5 different entrees, but could only have one, so Paprika Schnitzel it is!    The entrees come with a cup of soup, which was a "lemon martini" on Friday.   It was quite tasty, but I didn't really get lemon or martini.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#lYe5isj_vkLSPwbdJHF8qQ  The schnitzel is pork loin pounded flat, breaded and pan fried golden brown and is topped with an onion and bacon infused paprika sauce.   it also comes with German fried potatoes (with garlic and caraway) and wirsing (shredded cooked cabbage and onion in a creamy cheese sauce) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#L0eXT4gWympRVAeAB-1_PA   The pork was very tender and tasty.  The paprika sauce was WONDERFUL but also very subtle and nearly "disappeared" on the schnitzel.   I LOVED the wirsing!   The potatoes were very good too!   One friend ordered the Hackbraten, which is a beef and pork meatloaf with roasted onion gravy, spatzle and red cabbage.   I was able to taste the meatloaf and it was fantastic!

DESSERT: We couldn't leave without dessert, so we ordered and shared the Apple Strudel (Very good), Cherry Strudel (to die for!) and the "sauerkraut cake" (A chocoholics dream!).

This is my 700th review and I'm so glad I get to celebrate it with a five star review!

My fella and I planned a stay-cation at Encore this past Sunday and were very excited to try Botero while we were there. We arrived on Superbowl Sunday just around the end of the game so the place was still pretty empty. We were greeted warmly and shown to our seats. They gave us the option of sitting on the patio but we chose to sit inside instead.

Once seated, our waiter quickly took our water orders and let us peruse the menu for a little bit before returning for our drink and food order. I had been doing my homework so knew exactly what I wanted already. We started with the dungeness crab agnolotti and grilled octopus. The server mentioned that these were two of his favorite dishes, so I already knew we were on the right track. My fella went with the bone-in ribeye with rosemary prawns and I ordered the bone-in filet with foie gras. I just couldn't resist. To round our our order we decided on the brussel sprouts with pork belly and truffle mac n cheese for our sides. I was already worried we ordered too much, but we forged ahead. 

Our appetizers came out quickly and they smelled heavenly. My favorite was the dungeness crab, but the octopus was prepared well as well. I enjoyed the gnocchi, they were like heavenly little pillows. Just as we finished our appetizers our steaks and sides were delivered. They were enormous and smelled fantastic. I couldn't wait to take the first bite. Both steaks were perfectly cooked and we were so happy with our choices. The truffle mac n cheese and brussel sprouts were good. Not the best brussel sprouts I've ever had, but they were still delicious. I probably would have preferred them without the pork belly, crazy I know. 

We savored every bite but still couldn't finish everything, so we had quite a bit to take home for a midnight snack later. Despite not finishing all our food, we couldn't resist trying their famous smore beignets. I'll admit I wasn't blown away by these, but that's mostly because I'm not a huge fan of smores or any combination of these flavors. The dessert was amazing nevertheless, but I would be more interested in the key lime dessert next time around. 

This is a great location for large parties, they have quite a number of tables that can accommodate large groups before heading to the nearby clubs and they have an eclectic variety of music playing in the restaurant to get everyone pumped up. Overall, we had an amazing date night experience and I look forward to returning again!

I am sorry...

/Commences Rant

I will never return here. I was sorely disappointed and feel like I was treated as a subpar customer. Yeah not everyone eats sushi. I am that guy. Consequently I did join a large group of friends here. I knew that things wouldn't exactly be outstanding, but this place took it to a whole new level. The only reason they get a two star vs a one star is that most of my friends received excellent service and food. 

Whereas I got worse treatment than the red headed step child... Hell that is demeaning I don't even have red hair  *SMH*. In fact my trip here was one of my worst restaurant experiences in the last 10-15 years. *extremely disappointed*

So while all my friends purchased the AYCE meal and started to receive their various foods within 5 minutes of ordering, my appetizers (sesame chicken and shrimp tempura) took about 45 minutes to receive the first item, the shrimp tempura. It took another 10 plus minutes to receive the sesame chicken.

REALLY YAMA SUSHI!!! You brought out appetizers to my friends on the AYCE menu within 20 minutes. Why cant you bring the non AYCE appetizers to the guy who has nothing else to eat?  But your attitude seemed to be who cares he isn't getting AYCE.

Knowing that they are concentrating on the AYCE folks and the rolls that most of the people are getting, I knew I would have my food delayed. What ended up happening? Everyone was on their third or fourth roll at least before my food was served. 

Consequently I think you guys can go jump off a cliff. Way to treat a customer who wanted to partake in what he had heard was an awesome restaurant experience. I can count the number of times on a single hand where I have had a worse dining experience in my entire life!

Way to ruin what was otherwise a wonderful day for me with a large number of friends. I SERIOUSLY HOPE YOU DECIDE TO REVAMP YOUR POLICY TOWARDS NON AYCE PAYING CUSTOMERS OR THOSE WHO WANT SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, AND YET STILL ORDER DIRECTLY OFF OF YOUR MENU WITHOUT A SINGLE CHANGE REQUEST!

WHY THE HELL EVEN HAVE THOSE CHOICES LISTED WITH PRICING THAT IS NOT AYCE IF YOU JUST WANT TO IGNORE THE GUY WHO ORDERS DINNER THAT WAY.

I HOPE BEYOND A SHADOW OF A BELIEF THAT CUSTOMERS TURN AWAY FROM YOUR RESTAURANT IF THEY ARE LIKE ME. SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BE TREATED FAIRLY AND NOT MADE TO WAIT AN OVERLY EXTENSIVE PERIOD OF TIME TO GET WHAT YOU ARE ALREADY SERVING TO THOSE ALL AROUND HIM.

I WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE AND I HOPE THAT OTHERS WILL NOT AS WELL.

To add insult to injury your staff came after me for leaving less than the pre-ordained tip as listed on the check since I was part of a party of 6 or more. You should have been happy I left a tip at all. But to have you come after me demanding more for absolutely no service and unreasonable treatment, well F YOU. I am still pissed off about it and it has been several weeks.  

I hope your business goes bust!

/Ends Rant

I am Schel and I approve this review!

Edit: Screw it I cant stand to give them 2 stars... I have to drop it to a 1 star... still super ticked off...

It's places like Forequarter that make me wish "hipster chic" was a category on Yelp... really. It's so full of cool even the cuffed slim red pant and denim shirt unbuttoned like I just don't care I was wearing made me feel sort of lamesies in a sea of hip and happening. Seriously, everyone who eats there is hip. The bar is hip. The tables are hip. The plates are hip. It's hip that they have this fine-ish dining setup going but use paper napkins [1] and mismatched silverware [2]. It's hip that they make ice cream to order! [3] So hip I need to footnote this review, and that's hip. But don't fret if you don't sport swagger, the place is accessible for those that wear glasses because they have to and don flannel because it's practical. 

We arrived around 7 and were told it would be 30 minutes for a table. NBD, there are plenty of seats at the bar and a cocktail menu that'll take even the surest of imbibers time to get through. I landed on a delicious apple brandy cocktail that I snapped so you can see it and read all the deets. Just as soon as our drinks arrived, maybe 5 minutes after we arrived, a table opened up. And this folks is when ish gets real. 

Forequarter has a tidy menu of 12 or so items. They range in price from 4 to 17 bucks and all are meant to share. I think. I mean I get bored after two minutes of the same thing, so I think all dishes ought to be shared. We started with a charcuterie plate, a special that night which came with Genoa salami, two kinds of mustard, giardiniera, sliced bread and a fennel apple salad. It was amazing. I wish their was more bread to sandwich the plentiful amount of meat, but I knew we had more coming. Mushrooms were next, four kinds of wild fungus mixed with some greens and toasted bread... we'll call those croutons. ;) [4] Next up were the lamb meatballs served with perfectly cooked lima beans. What do I mean by perfectly cooked? I mean al dente; nice chew but not raw. From there we moved on to the squash cavatelli, the standout winner. Take a fun pasta, add some crispy pieces of squash, grated cheese and a fried egg and life is good. We rounded out our meal with a rich chocolate ice-cream that was pretty bomb for ice cream. It was served with a raspberry fruit leather and the best almond cookie I've ever eaten. Don't go there tomorrow for it. They rotate their desserts every night [3]. 

All in all it was an awesome trip and I'm excited to go back. I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant and liked reading every option on the menu, and I can only guess as the weather cools, some warm and cozy things will find their way to Forequarter post fall. 

[1] I used to gripe about paper napkins and now I sort of feel like a. I'm wiping my mouth on the thing, do I care if it's cloth and b. I have to think it's much more green to go paper than to go cloth and use harsh solvents and water to clean. So I say viva paper. 

[2] My dessert spoon was just like a set we had growing up. I wanted to steal it, but then I thought, "I'd only have one!" Not "It's wrong to steal" but "what would I do with one?"

[3] How do you make ice-cream to order? Nitrogen. The base is made that day and contains egg, so it's more of a custard when it starts. An order comes in, nitrogen cools the custard and makes for a thick and creamy texture, and tada... delivered to your table is a cool creamy treat make seconds earlier. They aren't stuck with a bunch in the freezer at the end of the night like oh I dunno everywhere else that serves ice cream and keeps it on hand. And they can get through a base in a night (because it rocks) and swap in a new sweet treat nightly.

[4] It's ripped, it's toasted, it's bread. And their tongue and cheek play on Corey's favorite carb was noted. Bravo 4qtr.

So my closest 17 relatives and I were going to Vegas and I wanted to try to introduce them to some interesting food that they might not otherwise try. Talking to a group like that is like herding cats! MY GAHHHD!!! It was such a loooooong, painful process! I showed them pictures, menus, prices, and spent hours deciding what to eat for our 3 days in Vegas.

While talking about our dining options, I often heard: "It's expensive!" "Buffet! Let's go to a buffet!" "That's such a small portion!" "Let's go to the Filipino restaurant!" "Umm...where else can we go?" GEEEEZZZZ. I wanted to end my misery so I gave up persuading them to eat somewhere else.

PAN SEARED SCALLOPS - Yessss, oh yeeeees...These scallops were perfectly seared, fresh and tasty! The red wine sauce was so good that I actually ate all the brussels sprouts and parsnip pear pasta that came with it. The sauce had a tremendous flavor but it didn't cover up the scallopy flavor! Is "scallopy" a word? Well, it should be!

Nothing else was as superb as the scallops, though.

COMPLIMENTARY BREAD - They gave us so much! Unfortunately it wasn't fresh off the oven. I didn't even mind if it was recycled but at least heat it up! The olive oil/balsamic vinegar it came with was spicy and wasn't good. My family, on the other hand, must've liked it cuz they inhaled most of the bread and the olive oil, maybe because the entrees were taking too long.

OSSO BUCCO - This was the special that night but it wasn't that special. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, it was alright but it was thirsty. I was not impressed with the risotto it came with either, it was a little tough. A little more water all around would be great!

TIRAMISU - It was decent and that's all I can say about that.

PANNA COTTA - Light, silky, creamy, yummy! But it was just like many a panna cotta I've had.

SERVICE - Needs improvement! We were the only customers for a while and their service was so slow. Our entrees took about 45 minutes. It got even slower when more people came in. Our waitress was MIA for so long that we asked another waiter for the dessert menu. It took about 15 minutes for everyone to decide what to get and our waitress was still missing when we were ready to order. When we asked for our waitress the waiter replied, "She's busy." Uhh...how about us??? We didn't want to be late to the Cirque du Soleil show! So another waiter took our order. We finally saw our waitress again when she served our dessert.

I was kind of disappointed that my family chose to eat here cuz there are so many other excellent restaurants in Las Vegas. It wasn't a total bummer because the scallops kicked serious ass, the panna cotta was good, and my family liked their dishes. So in the end I guess I didn't mind so much that we had dinner here, but I don't think I could be convinced to eat here again.

This ranks high on one of the most amazing and unusual culinary adventures that I've ever had.

A friend tipped me off that this chicken place was opening this week.  I so wanted to go, but I had another gig, and figured that I'd miss out.  As it so happened, said gig ended just early enough for me to go right before closing, so the missus and I hightailed it to ensure that we got there before closing.

Oh yes, there was a line.

And so we waited.  And waited.  However, the staff came out and started giving away free cornbread.  I'm... just not a big cornbread fan, but I figured "Why not", and bit into it.

o_O

It was amazing.  Super sweet, like cake.  I ate two pieces while the line trudged on.

As we got closer to the door, another staff member came out and started handing out copies of Flav's autobiography.  And now I had something to read while waiting.  People said that Flavor Flav himself was in the kitchen cooking, and sure enough, he was.  No clock because of health reasons, but he was hands deep in prepping chicken.  The place is small, and not flashy.  Public Enemy was playing over the speakers, and a few pictures of Flav hanging with other famous folk, but the size and decor were subdued.

In between food prep breaks, he came out and talked to people, posing for photos, and signing autographs before rushing back to the food.

I placed my order, and waited.  And waited. 

And waited.

Turns out, they simply weren't prepared for the mass onslaught of people at the end, and had to rush like crazy to get everyone's order covered.  The staff looked exhausted having been there all day, but they were nothing but friendly, even tempered, and soldiered on, saying that they are here to be the best.  Flav even came out in between food prep breaks to let people know how genuinely appreciative he was that so many people came out to support him, and just bless everyone.  He's going to make this right.  And that included getting down to the last order perfect.  "If anyone were to get a raw piece of chicken", he said, "you can come up and punch me in the face."

It was nearing midnight by the time the final 10 orders were being serviced.  He was dead set on making everything perfect, and thanked us over and over for our patience.  I have never seen someone work so hard in my life.  Forgot the rapping and reality show work.  The man is a juggernaut in the kitchen.  His staff are class and all were working like crazy to get food done, and keep people happy.

When I finally got my order, it was past midnight, so I wished him happy birthday.  As I got handed my bag, I called out to him to say thank you for working so hard for us.  I felt it was the least I could do.

With that, he stopped, came over to me, and shook my hand profusely, thanking me for coming out, being patient, and bless me for being so supportive.  I've come across of a lot of celebrities, famous people, and well knowns in my time.  Flavor Flav is honestly one of the nicest, most genuine people I've ever met.

Past midnight, I finally dragged home, more excited than tired by the wackiness of the adventure, and how fun the whole experience was.  And then I sunk my teeth into the first bite of the chicken.

....

o_O

My God.... 

It is, hands down, the best fried chicken that I've had in Las Vegas, if not possibly ever.  It is absolutely, utterly remarkable.  I don't know what Flav puts in that fried chicken skin, but Colonel Sanders deserves a demotion in rank and can kiss Flav's backside, for Sanders or Popeye are no longer the masters.  I devoured chicken like a Mogwai from Gremlins, and even cold the next day, I gnawed on the remaining pieces with glee.  The mac and cheese is excellent.  I even liked the french fries quite a bit.

So if there was ever a "bucket list" item that you never knew you had or even wanted, I can now cross off that Flavor Flav personally hand prepped and cooked me one of the best fried chicken meals that I have ever had in my life.

You'll need this experience on your bucket list.  You don't know how much you really do.

I will heartily go back to this diamond of a chicken place in a microsecond.  I am stunned.

Linda S. does not wait in long lines for food...except today. Today was about subjecting my family to driving across town to a long wait inside a smoke filled casino which has surely stunted my daughter's growth...all in the name of PAN ROAST. I would have lived the rest of my life ignorant of such a dish, but I became aware of this PAN ROAST in my quest for clam chowder in Las Vegas. The name itself brought images of a sort of pot roast, and of course this is sooo not even close.
I've been to Palace Station for conventions and would not have guessed I would be dragging my family here to eat on a Sunday afternoon. Crazy. I was hoping the line wouldn't be too bad, but we ended up waiting 1.50 hours to get our food. About 45 minutes into waiting, I noticed the 21 & over sign, so we inquired about take out since we had our daughter with us. They do offer take out but we would still have to wait. They only have about 18 seats at the bar. 18 seats plus 13 people ahead of us translated into about an hour to be seated.
I was especially curious to see how they prepare the pan roast. They use special steam pans and the food is cooked right in front of you. The chef was very jovial and interacted with patrons. Maybe if he just cooked, it would go faster. But the customers seemed to enjoy it and the servers were very nice.
I am terrible with remembering chronological order but here is my account anyway. If I missed anything, please feel free to let me know as I would like to attempt this recipe at home :) 
First came a scoop of butter, then garlic and chopped veges (looked like onions, celery and red peppers). Then I think he added the fresh seafood, followed by a ladle of clam juice. He let it cook until bubbly. Next came the sprinkle of chili powder to taste (1-10 level) and other seasoning...possibly celery seed. He let it cook some more. Then a splash of brandy and white wine. Finally a healthy ladle of a creamy red stock. Cooks it some more until hot and bubbling. The last step that put a smile on everyone's face was when he tips the pan into the bowl, puts a scoop of white rice and serves it up. The long wait is over :) Nom, nom, nom! Be careful not to burn your mouth as it comes out very hot.
PAN ROAST is a delicious and creamy seafood stew full of flavor. The combo pan roast has shrimp, lobster and crabmeat. Not at all fishy and very satisfying. The broth is rich and so flavorful,  you won't believe that you finished the entire thing...I know I didn't.
The CLAM CHOWDER  is one of the best I've had. Creamy but not heavy. Tender pieces of clams and small little chunks of potato (not too much). Another winning dish here.
I am happy to say that I would venture another trip to the Oyster Bar for the PAN ROAST and Clam Chowder.

One day, my je'e (mother) and I were wandering around Mesa trying to figure out where in the hell we were. The Navi was on the fritz and we were both getting aggrivated. 

"I'm not trying to get us lost Cheryl Miranda... I'm trying to find somewhere to eat - I'm hungry!" She shouted at me while nearly sideswiping a car off of Stapley - it was our third near accident that day. 

"Oh... DUDE! Turn Left at Main - there's a place that has popovers!" (For my non-O'odham yelpers, Popovers is my tribe's nickname for frybread; wah-much-tha is the traditional name for it btw) 

"POPOVERS!! Hell no! If you want frybread, we'll go home and you can make some!"

"Awww... come on! It's prolly the only place around here anyway!"

So we turned into a rather... dank looking strip mall (aren't they all dank looking?) and my mom nearly slammed into a drive thru sign for a small taquillia who specializes in tortas. We pulled up to a small resturant that was BRIGHTLY painted with Apache Crowndancer and large promises of Apache burgers & Navajo Lamb. 

When we entered we found a large airy room with a small dining room. Tables and booths to line the windows. There was a cute lil White couple dining on large tacos and huge sodas and a counter where employees took the order. We grabbed a couple of menus and then sat at a booth and looked things over.

"oh my gosh! haha! the ONLY difference between an Apache burger and a Navajo burger is that an Apache burger has two patties!" I giggled to my mom.

"Well... Navajos are really skinny." Score one for mom!

"the ONLY difference between an Apache taco and a Navajo taco is that one has crushed (think refried) beans and the other doesn't." 

"oh what in the HELL?!" I exclaimed as I turned the menu and I saw the monstrosity they call a dessert. The "tempting" Indian Dessert... looks - (I'm so sorry to say this) disgusting! I'm sorry! Grandma never EVER put so much on a frybread! It comes with a full sized frybread topped with a HUGE scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate syrup, powdered sugar & cinnamon. It's too much! frybread has such an amazing texture and delicate flavor... it's best when hot and to dump so much STUFF on it and let it get melty and gloopy is - gross. My advice is to stick with the basics and get a LIGHT dusting of sugar OR honey. 

We were both a little grossed out at the thought of the 'indian dessert' and decided to finally order. I had the red chili taco with whole beans (which cost extra). Normally - at frybread stands, it's called a red chili combo but not here. The madre got a whole bean taco (navajo taco). 

We started to talk with the employees for a second and it turns out they are pretty friendly. We got our drinks and sat back down. I began to really get a scope of the room. Photographs of Apache Sunrise Ceremonies where plastered on the walls as well as cradleboards and small Navajo rugs. I thought it was cute and I'm glad all the art was authentic. Within a few minutes, an employee came out from the kitchen and brought us our food.

The bread was normal sized (umm... I guess large to non-natives?) it had a great texture and was very fresh. I liked the redchili's flavor but was disappointed it wasn't very hot. Their hot sauce was good and I put it on EVERYTHING! My mom liked her taco as well but wished there was more salt. She in turn - then sprinkled half the shaker on our table onto her taco. 

We wound up ordering another couple of breads one with honey and the other with sugar and enjoyed our light dessert. Overall the food was good. I'm glad the service was quick and friendly and I'm even more grateful that the chili sauces were fresh and flavorful. The bread itself was crisp and light and yet still hearty. It takes a lot of years to develop such technique - I was quite impressed with it.

the prices on the other hand... compared to on-reservation stands are astronomical but when compared to powwows and the state fair they are still a little high but when compared to other resturants - they are actually cheap. lol... odd I know. The entree`s are about $7 at the resturant but NOTHING will EVER make me to pay over $3 for ONE single tortilla! That is outrage! it should be $3 for a half dozen, but not for one thick tortilla! 

To my yelpers, These are real Natives. They are cooking traditional recipes handed down from generations. The bread is good. The dining area isn't anything to write home about. The prices are both decent and highway robbery at the same time.  The cooking facilities and the dining area appear very clean. The burgers and mutton appear to freshly grilled. If you're in the area - give it a try. But do NOT order that damned dessert! I don't wanna hear about one of ya'll slipping into a diabetic coma from eating it.

***Aria's Julian Serrano is a nice looking tapas spot with a menu that sounds good; unfortunately, the food was surprisingly mediocre***

Julian Serrano is a tapas spot that is near the front lobby of the Aria Hotel.  The decor reminds me a little bit of the Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill in MGM Grand in how the restaurant is very much open to the casino and the hotel.  There are no big and thick walls separating the dining area from the nearby bustling activity of the casino.

The decor is very upscale cafe-like and hotel restaurant-like.  Nice and contemporary but pretty standard stuff (not unique or memorable).

We had a few things here and I felt the food looked better than it tasted.  Several of the dishes were average.  I was not a big fan of Fleur by Hubert Keller (a tapas spot in Mandalay Bay), but I felt Fleur was noticeably better than Julian Serrano.

Here is a rundown on what we had.

(Ahi Tuna Tempura) This was ahi tuna two ways.  There was a standard ahi tuna tower on the plate that had an avocado base (fresh and a good flavor but something you will find at a lot of other restaurants).

There was also ahi tuna that was flash fried in a light tempura batter (crispy on the outside but still rare on the inside).  This was okay and I liked the contrast of the cool center with the crisp outside.  Still, I've had a much better version of that dish at Ocean Avenue Seafood in Santa Monica.

(Mediterranean Bass)  This was a bass with the skin-on that was served over some veggies with a light sauce.  It was a light dish and had a mild flavor.  The fish was pretty moist (the skin could have been crisper).

(Cheese Platter) The cheese selection at Fleur was much better.  The cheese here was a little dry (not great flavors either).  The garnishes were also disappointing.  The fruit paste was too thick and lacked sweetness.

(Chicken Skewers) The chicken skewers here were juicy enough, but they lacked flavor.

(Prime Tenderloin Topped With Cheese, Honey And Pecans) The quality of beef was really poor (at least when compared to the other dishes we had here). The beef was a thin piece.  They overcooked it  (it came out well) and it was dry and chewy.  The cheese, honey and pecans were all fine, but the centerpiece of the dish (beef) was a real disappointment.

(Stuffed Dates) The dates here were wrapped in bacon and then deep-fried.  This is a pretty popular combination and their version of it was pretty tasty (though kind of a given with this flavor combination).

Service was okay.  Food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive enough, but I felt the wait staff was not as strong as what I experienced at other Vegas spots recently (including Fleur, Mesa Grill, Comme Ca, Bouchon, and Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill).

I've been fortunate enough to have a lot of service where it felt the wait staff was really putting in the extra effort to make every aspect of the dining experience enjoyable and memorable.  While the wait staff was pleasant enough, I did not get that same feeling here.

Julian Serrano sounds like it would be a nice place.  The menu reads nice as well.  There were mostly misses here though and the food was just not as good as other Vegas spots I've tried in the same price range.  I will give a lot of places a second try, but since we had so many dishes and so many were average, I doubt I would return here.

Aria features complimentary valet parking.  I am not sure if they feature complimentary self-parking as well.

Take it from a party girl, Hakkasan is "Vegas' commuter club." 

You go to check it out because it's new and some awesome DJ is there, and then you leave when you realize it's not that great. Amazing DJs, but the club itself is an ergonomic fail in design. 

Unless you've bought a VIP table, this club probably isn't for you. Guys that do, you'll have a good time. Girls that don't, not so much. And it's not like most Vegas clubs, where random people meet and start drinking together. The club is not setup for that inviting experience. 

My 4 girlfriends and I went for Tiesto last Friday -- Tiesto was amazing, one of the best sets I've heard from him! .. but we ended up leaving the club before close (which we never do) because of Hakkasan itself. Us girls live for this stuff, and I wish, I wish we could have said something good about it.  

Where it fails:

1) It's missing the experience. 
When you walk through Hakkasan, most people you walk by aren`t smiling - it's weird. The reason for this is that the experience is missing. Everyone in a club should be able to experience the ambience and atmosphere of everyone partying and having a good time. Hakkasan doesn't offer this. Unless you're at a VIP table or are willing to get smothered with sweaty bodies on the waaayyy over packed dancefloor, you will not have an enjoyable clubbing experience because you can't see anything! You can't see the DJ in the main room because of the design layout and you'll be stuck wandering in the paths, or dancing in the overflow area. 

2) You're always looking down because you can't feel comfortable walking around. 
First, there's soo many stairs at random levels. Second, the overflow room has raised platforms that are not visible in crowds. As a result, sooo many girls were taking a tumble because of the poor design/lack of  area guards and the bouncers didn't do anything about it. It was ridiculous. Third, the floor pattern is misleading; it gives the illusion that there are white steps when there are not. My girls and I kept thinking that there were steps and we felt like we always had to be cautious. 

3) If you're not VIP, you'll feel like a second class citizen. For girls, we're usually used to being treated well at Vegas clubs, but because Hakkasan isn't designed for mingling and meeting new people, girls are left behind... without a view of the DJ (not even on a TV screen anywhere), without a single place to sit, and wandering around aimlessly. The result: they leave. Hakkasan is known for girls leaving -- the staff know it and this is why is it Vegas commuter club.

It doesn't offer us glamorous Vegas nightclub experience and it's really disappointing.  Here's some suggestions to make it better: 

TO THE HAKKASAN OWNERS: 

1) The Overflow Room. This room offers no experience. You have to remember, people come for DJs, so even if they're not in the main danceroom, you need to give them that experience. Add a massive LCD screen showing the DJ playing along the side with the balcony. Also, you can't have girls falling all over the place! Add barriers to the corner areas of the platform for safety. 

2) The Waterfall back area. You need to let girls sit here, otherwise they will leave. I get it, the idea is that people have to pay to sit at a club, but this is just ridiculous. You need to let girls rest their feet sometimes. Marqui allows it in certain areas, and so should you! 

3) Upstairs - small suggestion. If you're not VIP, there is noooo experience up here and therefore, it's a waste of space. Give people the experience. Add some small LCD TVs everywhere, so people can feel the DJ. People will create their own fun in front of the TVs.  

4) Upstairs - big suggestion. Because the openings to the VIP booths are opposite to the DJ stage, the guys in the VIP are facing the DJ stage. Therefore, when girls are walking behind, they'll never get noticed. So, I think another tier that is a few steps lower than the VIP area should be wrapped in front for non-VIPs. This way, the guys in VIP will physically"see" girls and tell them to join them AND they'll feel more like VIP with more people seeing them. Also, regular people will actually have a view. 

5) Dancefloor. Having 2 entrances on the dancefloor at the ends of the stage is inconvenient for exiting. Add two more paths to enter the dancefloor like Marqui. 

These problems may seem petty, but for Vegas, this is exactly what it's all about. Someone(s) missed the mark here. Hakkasan needs some work, big-time. I won't be back unless something changes.

Heard about the 16 oz Ribeye for 12.99 here so of course I had to investigate. It's a tough job but hay, somebody has to do it!

As you come in, the bar is the first thing you run into. That's great if you want to eat and drink while inhaling second hand smoke. Just go around to your left and into the actual dining room where there is about 6 booths and 3 tables.

If you are lucky, you just might get Holly as your server. She is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and she provides great service. The vibe I got from her was all positive. It seemed to me like she actually enjoyed her job. Needless to say, I knew I was going to give her a generous tip when it was all said and done.

As promised, I ordered the 12.99 1 pound Ribeye which comes with your choice of Fries or Onion Rings (I got the Onion Rings and man, they were so good!). I also added a side salad which is only a dollar more with any meal. I ordered the Ribeye medium rare topped off with my request of sauted onions and mushrooms. I assume they have been offering this Ribeye deal for a while now because my steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it. It was so juicy and  tender that my wife was kicking herself for not ordering it. Refer to my pic of the inner portion of my exquisite piece of meat. To me, that's how all steak should be cooked and look like when its cut apart.

My wifey ordered the Pretzel appetizer (which is funny because it could be a meal in itself cuz its so huge!) Comes with 3 sauces. Hot mustard, Jalapeno Cream Cheese, and Nacho Cheese infused with Beer! Now that last sauce was kind of weird but definitely a change of pace if you have never had it.

Now probably the only obvious thing that stood out as a negative for me was that even though we were in the supposed "Non Smoking" dining section, you can still smell the smoke coming in from the bar. At the time of our dining experience, I smelled only a little bit of smoke and when we got home, some of the smell was on our clothing. I can only imagine that on really busy nights, the smoke factor would be even worse and that your clothes will smell like an ashtray full of cigarette butts later on.

So if you are ever craving steak, especially Ribeye, then Jacksons Bar and Grill is the place for you! Doesn't matter if it's 11 pm at night or 9 am breakfast time, you can get it at any time because these guys are 24/7!

***Twist delivers contemporary French cuisine; it is good for Vegas but still a notch below top SF and Chicago spots***

Twist is yet another Vegas fine dining restaurant from an internationally acclaimed chef like Robuchon and Savoy.  Twist is newer though.  It is located on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin hotel.  Being newer, I was hoping for more contemporary cuisine than what I've had at Vegas' other fine dining French restaurants and Twist delivered.

Twist features a lot of good (and modern) food while still showcasing French ingredients and cooking techniques.  Twist offers several dining options.  You can go for a more value-centric 3-course dinner.  You can also order a la carte where you choose from elaborate plates that feature proteins in multiple interpretations (the multiple presentations of foie gras sounded interesting) as well as big Prime steaks.  Finally, you can opt for one of their tasting menus--a vegetarian option or their seasonal tasting menu (available in 4 or 6 courses).

I opted for the tasting menu and it started off very well.  First came a series of tasty amuses.  There were lavash breadsticks with albacore cream and bonito flakes (pate-like in richness), an almond sable, very good goat cheese sandwiched between two light and crispy crackers, and a really good Guinness and Jack Daniels gelee rolled in gingerbread (great burn but also sweet--reminiscent of the cocktail gels at LA's Providence).

The bread was also good (several warm options including a warm bacon and smoked cheddar roll, a crusty French baguette, a too dense brioche roll, herb and feta, and cherry pecan bread).

My first course was sea bass and haddock carpaccio with citrus and horseradish ice cream.  The fish was good--moist and soft--and went well with the citrus and herbs to give it freshness.  The horseradish ice cream was very creamy and had a noticeable horseradish flavor without being overpowering.

My second course was easily my favorite of the night.  It was foie gras ravioli next to seared langoustine in a herb and coconut milk broth (topped with crispy mushrooms).  The foie gras ravioli had a thick pasta skin as well as creamy, buttery and savory seared foie gras at the center.  The langoustine was very nicely cooked--fresh, lightly sweet, plump, and soft.  The broth was very aromatic.  This reminded me of the buttery foie gras ravioli at Providence and the perfectly cooked langoustine at L'atelier de Joel Robuchon (two very good restaurants).

Next up was a fish course and it was disappointing.  It was turbot and the fish was a little tough and not easy to flake--definitely far from Baume's soft and flaky turbot.  Worse than the slightly tough fish was the grapefruit (very acidic and bitter).  This felt like something that maybe should have came earlier because the acidity was too much for an entree.

A good intermezzo of apple and yuzu sorbet with Dungeness crab came next.  Chicken followed and it was served on warm greens with pistachio.  I do not often see chicken on fine dining menus, but I was glad to see it because chicken can be really good if a crispy skin is achieved and the meat is juicy.  The meat was fairly juicy here, but there was no crispy skin.  The greens were okay, but this course felt overseasoned.

Wagyu beef was the final savory course.  It was served over warm sweet and sour red cabbage slaw.  The Wagyu had a fair amount of richness.  Unfortunately, it was overcooked.  It was also more like tri-tip than a true steak so it was slightly tough and chewy.

Dessert consisted of a series of mini desserts, which I felt overall were too fruit focused as well as too tart.  The first dessert was really good strawberries with cream and a nice strawberry sorbet.  The pistachio and cucumber parfait was refreshing and had great creaminess, but there were too many leafy greens, which resulted in a salad-like flavor and texture.  There was also a shortbread cookie with blackberries.  The chocolate part of the dessert had rich chocolate ice cream as well as light meringues and a fruit paste.

Service was excellent--very polished and personable.  I thought my server Breanne was really good and the male server assisting her delivered food presentations with professionalism and knowledge but also an enthusiasm that really makes you want to dive into the food.

Prices were very high, but that is the case with many Vegas restaurants.

Twist provides a good view of The Strip; the dining room is nice, elegant and contemporary.

I am not a fan of Vegas restaurants and there were a few things about Twist that reminded me why I feel this way (the high prices and how Vegas fine dining does not measure up to SF or Chicago).  The food here felt more exciting than Aureole, Guy Savoy and miX though and it is worth a shot if you are looking for high-end but also contemporary French cuisine in Vegas.

CityCenter offers free self parking.

I went to Del's with my girlfriend on the night of the Restaurant Impossible relaunch, eager to see how the show transformed it. While hectic, the night was a lot of fun and the food was reasonably tasty. The menu was small (as is usual on relaunch night), but had plenty of good choices. There were some high points- the mozzarella sticks, garlic bread and biscotti. As for dinner, I had an average chicken cacciatore, while my girlfriend had chicken parmigiana that was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. She was happy enough with it that she was looking forward to having it again.

The servers were enthusiastic and accommodating, which was impressive considering everything they went through that day. As the night went on, we were both troubled when we overheard the owner complaining to regulars that the show had forced her to severely shrink her menu. She pledged to go back to the old menu once things were back to normal. I couldn't help but wonder why. After all, if you appear on Restaurant Impossible, isn't that a pretty glaring sign that something is wrong with your current menu?

About three months later, we figured that it was time to go back with a couple of friends. As expected, the smaller menu was gone and the bloated original menu was back, plus a few of the Restaurant Impossible dishes. I was dumbfounded by the breadth of choices. In addition to the long list of entrees, Del's also offers pizza and 12 kinds of pasta that can be combined with 13 different sauces. I can't help but think that our meal would have been better if the menu was tightened up.

We started with mozzarella sticks and garlic bread, the strongest parts of the meal. The mozzarella sticks were a tad overdone, but were still very tasty, especially with the accompanying tomato sauce. The strong garlic bread was a welcome change of pace from what often passes for garlic bread elsewhere. Unfortunately, my French onion soup was middling at best. In addition to being very sweet, it had an unappetizing layer of oil on top of the melted cheese. My girlfriend and buddies found their iceberg salads to be mediocre.

The meal continued to go downhill with the entrees. I had gnocchi with butter and garlic sauce. The butter and garlic sauce was flavorful and strong, but the gnocchi were dense and slightly chewy. My girlfriend, pleased with her chicken parmigiana on our first visit, ordered it again and was severely disappointed. The chicken was buried in sauce. I tried it and agreed- the breading was a soggy mess, while the chicken was drier and tougher than on our first visit.

The desserts that we saw floating around looked very good, but we were all far too stuffed from dinner to try anything. Del's portions are huge, which they charge accordingly for. As it is, I think the large portions are meant to counteract the middling quality of the food. Three out of the four of the people in our party had enough leftovers for another full meal.

The restaurant itself is still bright and clean, just as it was on relaunch night. Service was well-paced, friendly, and honest. The food and menu need work, though. Cut out some of the dead weight on the menu and give the staff the opportunity to focus on creating better quality dishes. I'm sure Del's doesn't want to shake things up too much for fear of losing their regulars... but if they fail to change, they're never going to create any new regulars.

While the boys make it a golf day, the ladies spa away...at least that was the plan. This was my first time visiting Fort McDowell and I must say that for being a Radisson, the grounds were nicer then I would have expected. The pool is spacious, the water is ice cold (which is perfect on a hot day), the cocktails are very reasonably priced (around $6.50) and the staff is friendly. However, sadly, the spa was anything but a "day spa." 

Spa days are my weakness. For me, taking a spa day is the perfect escape from reality and a way for me to go on vacation without the costs of flights and accommodations. I enjoy spa days because I can arrive early and enjoy the amenities. I like to check in with the aroma of spa scents welcoming me and spa music calming the atmosphere. I like to enjoy the woman's locker room with amenities like a personal locker, jacuzzi, showers, sweet smelling products, etc. I also like to sit in a calming waiting room and clear my mind before my service. Did I experience any of this at the Radisson's "day spa?" Sadly, I didn't experience one aspect of this. Instead, this is what I experienced...

I entered the Radisson and followed the signs to the "spa." I entered the room that claimed to be the spa and instead found myself in a meeting room converted into a small gym (similar to those found in corporate motels). I looked around for the spa entrance and didn't see anything. Finally, I saw a small sign on a cabinet that said to check in to the spa at the gift shop. I walked down the hallway to a gift shop where the lady working the counter checked me into the spa. I asked about a ladies' locker room but learned that one didn't exist and instead, I was given a key for a "locker" that was against the wall of the mini gym. I came to the spa planning on working out, getting my massage, using the amenities and ending the day at the pool. Instead, I sat on a chair in the mini gym while waiting for my service. As it turns out, the spa is actually three rooms off of the mini gym. The spa doesn't have a ladies' locker room, a proper waiting area or any feeling of a spa at all. The workout didn't happen because the gym only had two treadmills and both were being used. Instead of changing in a ladies' locker room, I had to take my bag into the solo bathroom in the gym to change into my suit. My friend and I both booked massages for the day but they had to be an hour apart. Now I know why. It's because they only have one massage therapist. I didn't see any other treatments going on during my visit either. 

Now, my experience is no fault of the massage therapist's. She was professional, nice and provided a nice massage. The massage therapist mentioned that I was not very relaxed during my massage and I wanted to comment back that it's very hard to relax when you're getting a massage in a random room off the hotel gym with the hotel hallway on the other side of the wall. The icing on the cake was when a group of people (maybe on a tour?) walked in on my massage. Yes, they walked into my massage room right smack in the middle of my massage. It was one of the most awkward moments of my life. Again, the massage therapist was wonderful and I feel bad that she has to be associated with this disappointing spa experience. 

Don't be fooled by the long menu listing a variety of treatments. All will be done in a maximum of three small rooms off the gym. There is no sense of spa here and if I could have canceled my massage upon arrival, I would have. This shouldn't be considered a "day spa." If they are going to promote anything, they should say that offer "spa services" within the hotel, but there was nothing that fell within the "day spa" category during my experience. It doesn't take a lot to please me, but when I'm spending a decent amount of money on a spa day, I expect a spa day. 

If you visit this hotel, stay the night and enjoy the pool and renowned golf course, but think twice before booking a spa day here.

Sometimes I ignore Yelp reviews.  In this case I'm glad that I did.  My delicious dinner at Caf at the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino was exactly what I hoped for.  

With a full workload at my job I chose to skip dinner the previous night in order to finish up early and join my two traveling companions for the long drive to Las Vegas filling myself later with snack chips, candy and bottled water instead.  That's not a whole lot of nutrition for someone with a goal of running in two races on Saturday and Sunday.

It seems eating wasn't a main priority for either of my friends once we arrived in Las Vegas.  After checking into the hotel then taking the long walk to the Sands Convention Center to pick up our race numbers for Sunday's half marathon and marathon my friends opted to go do some shopping instead.  I opted to return to the hotel on my own, drop off my things in the room and have an early dinner instead.

After checking out the menus on all of the restaurants at the casino level of the Monte Carlo I decided to try Caf based on the menu and the somewhat reasonable prices.  The 24 hour restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner whenever.

Once seated, I was greeted by my server Sharon who came by a short time later to take my order.  With the annual Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in town many restaurants were offering up a special rodeo menu in addition to the regular menu.  I took advantage of the Cowboy Corral menu selecting the Texican Egg Rolls appetizer followed by the Rib Eye Steak entre.  I ordered my steak medium and enjoyed a soft drink and water while I waited.

The Texican Egg Rolls (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-JfncbVURtvuzBbof40o1w?select=n4cU5XHNgFbb6ZYbkYOzDg) were very good.  These were three full size egg rolls stuffed with grilled chicken, black beans, corn, chopped jalapenos in a mildly spicy chipotle sauce, halved and served with equal parts of fresh guacamole, pico de gallo and sour cream.

The beautifully grilled Rib Eye Steak (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-JfncbVURtvuzBbof40o1w?select=ecI3VDrfHKPLAS3v06Kk9A) arrived just as I was finishing up on my appetizer.  Grilled to a perfect medium (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-JfncbVURtvuzBbof40o1w?select=6LX4cBC3xS6cjsG-MwYqoA) the steak was nicely marbled, juicy and tender.  It came with a big baked potato with sour cream and garlic butter, a roasted shallot and fresh, steamed broccolini.

The service was excellent.

We have enjoyed The White Chocolate Grill (WCG) many times, both for Happy Hour and for dinner. Our experiences have been universally good.

We came here last week after church for Easter Sunday around 2-ish for dinner.  We had made our reservations on Open Table/Yelp and our booth was waiting for us when we arrived.  Actually, the WCG was only half full at the time after a busy brunch, but it was nice having the hostess escort us over to our table by the window.

Our water glasses were filled, as we sat looking at our menus.  Heather our server came by giving us the Specials of the day.  The three of us decided to skip the wine list, opting instead for Ice Tea.  It had already been a long day, and any alcohol would have put us to sleep.

We started by sharing the Ahi Tuna Salad for $14.95.  WCG normally sears it with a sesame crust which is very good, but today we asked them not to cook it but serve it raw.  There is something about raw ahi tuna, in their champagne vinaigrette that speaks to me.  Today was no different, it was very nicely done.

For dinner we order, the End Cut Prime Rib for $24.99, the Baby Back Rib for $21.99, and the Balsamic Rib Eye for $26.89.  Each of us had a bite of the others and we were very happy with our selections.  

The Rib Eye was not what you would have expected, in so far as it was not a piece of prime rib without the bone, but instead two small 7' cutlets cooked in a glazed balsamic reduction sauce.  Very nice.   The Baby Backs were as you would expect, as was the End Cut.

For dessert, we ordered the Bread Pudding for $7.59 and the house special Silky Chocolate Souffl Cake also $7.59.  We also had some coffee for $2.49 and a Cappuccino for $2.99.

In my Yelp Tip, I mentioned the Bread Pudding as being exceptional and it is,  I know on some cooking shows, it looks like just day old bread and a cream sauce of some kind.  But at WCG, the sauce is almost Creme Brulle-ish and it really is out of this world.  

The total damage came to $116.00, before tax of $10.79 and tip; which seemed fair for three people.  One of things we like to do is go to a movie at the nearby Harkin's Cine Capri and stop at WCG for dessert afterwards.  We really had a nice time at the WCG on Easter and we will certainly recommend them.

Enjoy!

Things you should do in Las Vegas:  (1) Buffet , (2) Gamble, (3) Club/Adult Entertainment/Events, (4) Drink/Getting crazy loaded, (5) Late Hour Dining

Service - Excellent - See below
Cleanliness - Excellent - it's in the Venetian so the place was pristine.
Price - $94.14 (including tax and tip, 3 people ordered)
Seafood - Yes, Calamari, ahi, etc.
Meats - Yes, beef, chicken, pork, duck, etc.
Vegetables - Yes, salads
Dessert - Yes, variety of cakes, pies, cupcakes, etc
Fruits - Yes
Other - (1) Located on the First Floor of the Venetian Casino floor between the Casino Cages and Food Court, (2) Review is for Venetian-side Grand Lux Cafe--not Palazzo-side.  (3) Grand Lux Cafe was created by David Overton (founder of Cheesecake Factory Restaurants), (4) Accept all major credit cards

What was ordered:

Customer Service (Complimentary) - Excellent - Jessica K was our server for this Wed 11:30 pm dining session.  Jessica was very personable and made great small talk about why we were here.  I was taking pictures of my friends and she offered to take a picture of me as well.  I declined, but she snatched my camera and proceeded to take my picture stating that I got pictures of my friends so it was only fair that I get a picture as well.  Jessica then offered to take a picture of all 3 of us afterwards.  Other than that, brought us everything we needed with a smile.  Nice gal.

Rib Eye Steak ($30.95) - Excellent - Cooked medium rare rib eye steak served with 2 onion rings, sprig of greens, and French fries.  Let me deconstruct the meal while I deconstruct the meal:

Rib Eye Steak - Excellent - Per Grand Lux Cafe menu "We serve the finest Certified Angus Beef, corn-fed and aged up to 4 weeks for flavor, then seasoned and broiled at 1600 degrees to seal in the juices."  Quantity: Nice, large slab of meat.  Approximately 9 inches in length, 4.5 inches in width, and 1 inch in thickness.  Quality: Excellent.  The steak came with some fat, but it was quite meaty--I ate the fat because it's delicious (don't judge).  They cooked it to perfection with a nice pinkish middle and still juicy.  The steak pretty much melted in your mouth like butter.  Flavor: I don't know how else to describe it, but as "Awesome and delicious!"  Very flavorful beef that I was tempted to order another.  Other: My friend M ordered the same thing, but cooked medium.  He could not stop "ooo" and "aaaahing" about the steak.  He even declared it the best steak ever.

(2) Onion Rings - Excellent - Quantity: 2 onion rings.  Quality: The BEST ONION RINGS EVER!!  The skin was perfectly golden with a nice crunch yet light when you bite into it--with very little oily feel.  I hate fast food places, chains, mom & pops serve these onion rings that have hard crusts and extremely oily.  Flavor: You really can taste the onion goodness here--it isn't hidden by the batter.  So good.

Sprig of Greens - Excellent - Quantity: A sprig.  Quality: I'm amazed about the attention to detail here.  If you think this sprig of greens is just garnishment, think again.  They actually put dressing on these greens--meant for consumption, not looks.  Think of it as a mini, mini, mini salad.  Flavor: Great flavor--sweetness and citrus acidity pop from the dressing and refreshing flavor from the greens.  The greens actually refreshes your mouth after consuming such bold flavors from the beef.

French Fries - Excellent - Quantity: Approximately a 5 inch diameter bowl of fries--4 inches in height.  Quality: Nice golden brown color, perfectly crispy, and not oily.  Flavor: Tasted like good fries.  Seasoned well with a nutty flavor to them.

Let me check off my Las Vegas Checklist:

(1) Buffet - Nope - maybe Thursday morning
(2) Gamble - Hell NO - I despise losing money
(3) Club/Adult Entertainment/Events - Check - My Sac Kings lost to the Lakers.  Not going to make it rain this time.
(4) Drink/Getting crazy loaded - Check - Gentleman Jack is your FRIEND. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/photo/yZI0fAgC2XtddriDX2i3rA/l
(5) Late Hour Dining - Check - Grand Lux Cafe is "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"

"The restaurant is four days old, and already has five 5-star ratings? Hmm, must check it out," I thought.

Not so fast...

What I suspect we have here is a lot of the owner's friends creating 5-star reviews to bring in curious Yelpers like me.  (You can tell because they're very "promo-ey" and not so critical/constructive).

Let me give you the real deal, at this stage of the game.

* They're still 4 weeks away from a liquor license, thus no adult beverages to go with your tapas (unless you BYOB, which everyone around us did -apparently they got the memo). We could have used some of that awesome sangria from you-know-where.
* Seemed like they're suffering the same ethos that plagues many mom & pop restos -lots of friends and family hovering and trafficking in and out of the kitchen, like its an extension of their home kitchen. Kids running through the restaurant. Felt like we were imposing on a personal space, yet, we're paying customers. Awkward. 
* Had to request silverware, after the first appy arrived. We sat there looking at it, at each other, at it, scoured the surrounding tables to see if we could borrow a set, but nope. Eventually we flagged the hostess (co-owner)  who then brought a set. Then another set arrived a few minutes later from the server. A bit uncoordinated. 
* The water is unfiltered, so it was truly tap water from the best the Vegas pipes have to offer. Tastes terrible. 
* Dining partner had the muddled mint and strawberry lemonade. Tall thin glasses at $3.50 a pop. WIth ice, of course, so you'll be going through your drinks pretty darn quickly. My brother went through about six refills (which you do pay for). The hostess was nice and comped him one, I think because she knows that's a steep price for a tiny bit of actual beverage. 
* Cheese plate. $11 for tiny morsels of forgettable cheese! There was about $2 worth of cheese on the plate. Retitled, "Rip me Off Please Cheese Plate."
* Chicharrones. My brother is a chicharrones aficionado (he guiltily admits). He took one bite and didn't touch the rest of it. His assessment, "No. Just, no."
* Bucket of tempura veggies: edible along with the calamari. Hard to mess these up, but the calamari was comprised of super tiny rings. Lots of breading, not lots of calamari. Just kind of bummed at this point...
* Lastly, bro ordered the cookie baked in a mini skillet for dessert. It arrives, with a plastic spoon. Odd. I watch him fight to get the tiny plastic spoon through rock hard ice cream while also trying not to let the spoon melt when touching the scalding hot cast iron skillet. Humorous to watch, yet, ridiculous. I flag down the server, ask for a metal spoon. He looks at my bro and asks, "What's wrong with that spoon?" "I can't eat the ice cream with it -its frozen solid."  So what he brings us isa huge serving spoon meant for back of house. Jolly Green Gian spoon. 
Whatever. My good nature is on its last tempura crumb at this point.
* Asked for the check. Took 20 minutes... After check was paid (with hostess), we had the receipt with a large stack of bills sitting on the table. Server flys by and scoops up the stack of bills ($50).  "Whoa, cowboy, that's our change." Again, uncoordinated -I think they don't know who's doing what there, just yet. Server looked pretty young so maybe his first job while still in HS? Friend of the family, I'll bet... 

I keep saying to myself, ok, they're new. But lots of this stuff has nothing to do with new. Overall, not ready for prime time. And $50 later... feeling like I would have had a much better time, much better & filling food at Firefly. Everything on Nosh & Swig's menu can be had, in better quality, in their respective establishments around town. Leave the Korean to the Koreans, Japanese to the Japanese, White Trash to Simon, unless you can outshine them. Featuring variety is one thing, but variety without stellar quality = not coming back.

You're probably asking yourself, what in the world does "Sekong by Night" mean? Well, the answer is, oooh just some classic, popular Cambodian song title that the owner is obsessed over. :)

As previously mentioned by another fellow Yelper, Sekong does exude charm.  In fact, most of the artistic, decorative items that is seen in the dining room is a straight import from mainland Cambodia (ie. table cloths, paintings, sculptures, and other artworks).  Obviously, the owner wanted to not only deliver authenticity from a cuisine standpoint but also historically and culturally.  They did a magnificent job in creating a nice visual display to sort of educate first time consumers of Khmer cuisine.

To get an idea of what Khmer dishes are like, I always say they're a cousin to Vietnamese and Thai cuisine.  Although, I think they just share ideas or possibly just steal from one another.

One prime example of idea sharing that you might find in a Vietnamese menu is the Luc Lac.  And actually, this creation was French inspired.  It's basically steak meat that has been cut into cubes and sauted to a tender perfection fused with caramelized onions and garlic to give a richer taste.  The dish usually comes with a side of white rice and a fresh salad that has been lightly soaked in a sweet, citrus, vinagry dressing.  Its fantastic when done right!  In fact, I really enjoy Sekong's version! Its a must try! [Recommend]

Sekong also serves tasty sandwiches like the Vietnamese Banh Mi.  I have only tried their grilled beef.  From what I recollect tasting, it was meat marinated in a savory, lemon grass.  The baguette was very toasty and had a soft interior while the pickled veggies were fresh tasting. [Recommend]

And the cultural similarity theme continues! They also serve a crispy crepe-like dish that encompasses pork, shrimp and bean sprouts called, Baynchaiv, traditionally a finger food.  You take your lettuce and create a wrap and dip it into home made fish sauce. [Recommend]

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ?select=dmpDwgYQUk68LqY3tGx3fw

Loat Cha, my other go-to dish, are these 1-inch round rice noodles drenched lightly in soy sauce and then pan fried served with fresh, crispy bean sprouts, green onions, and sliced beef topped with one egg.  [Recommend]

Now, the chicken wings with a side of rice is quite tasty.  Last time I ordered one, the chicken came out nicely crisped with a hint of peking flavor, which is a notorious marinade for Chinese roast ducks.

As for snacks and specialty drinks, I've had their tempura sweet potato and banana, and grass jelly drink.  All were excellent.  The tempura snacks came out super crispy with a fresh tasting interior.  If you are unfamiliar with grass jelly, it is basically semi-bland jello with a slightly sweet, grassy flavor, but in creating a refreshing drink, jello are cut up into tiny cubes while adding ice, sugar and honey.

The one item that has bothered me for awhile now is the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup, also the counter to Vietnamese Pho.  The only reason why I have hesitated for this long is, admittedly, due to the exotic-ness (ie. pork liver, heart, tripes, etc).  As soon as I can grow a third ball, I will attempt it! Just kidding, I will eventually.

The menu is not as large but being new to the food scene, they are looking to start off small and expand as business blossom.  

By now, you may have already read about the lengthy wait, awkward location, and whatever shenanigans have you not, they are still working out the kinks and are continually listening to feed backs.  

Pricing is very reasonable and competitive with the other Southeastern Asian power houses in the Valley [$5 - 10 range].  I will continue to be a regular here and add more updates as I try more items.

Four stars for now, this place will almost certainly earn more as I return.  This is now my go-to margarita (particularly for the entirely reasonable $7) and the ($2! TWO!!! DOLLARS!!!) tacos were excellent as well.  I tried one of each taco - they offer steak, pork, fish, and seasonal veggie.  I think I'll go heavy on the steak and fish upon future visits - the pork taco had carmelized pineapple on it and was just a little too sweet for my taste.  The veggie taco was great, but not really my style.  

I was afforded a bite of the corn, which was lightly spiced and heavily sprinkled with some deliciously pungent powdery cheese.  I can't wait to get a cob of this for myself.  Very juicy, and flavorful.  I missed a taste of the other appetizer my table ordered - the fried cheese roll thing.  This is an almost airy roll of what must have been a cheese batter - I wonder what one would have to do to get a demonstration of how that thing was made - that looked fairly delicious, from my point of view.  The guac was quite tasty, although I don't know that I would call it the best I've ever experienced.  I enjoyed the salsas that were offered nearly as well.  The chips were a slightly thicker variety, with a great fresh crunch and good flavor of their own.  

The service was a bit hectic - our waiter had some help that seemed to come at random times and I wasn't totally sure they were helping him out as much as confusing everyone.  Given that it's a new restaurant, apparently a waiter was out for some reason, and the fact that nothing actually offensive or problematic occurred, I won't dock stars, but I expect this aspect to improve on my next visit.  Perhaps we won't invite 8 people who each expect separate checks next time and it won't be a problem (but what fun would that be?).  

The ambiance - I liked the design of the place, although it would be nice if they had a slightly larger TV above the bar, and the layout is a little.... interesting, with the bar area right near the lobby and all.  The main seating area looked like a more compelling place to enjoy a leisurely meal, with large windows, some bench seating along the wall, and a better division of space.  

All told, I really enjoyed my experience here, both food-wise and every entertaining second of the conversation.  I'm excited to return again and again (the corn, dessert, a torta, the cheese appetizer, perhaps breakfast?) I can hardly wait, in fact.

Originally hubby and I were going to try a different place, but it was too packed so I decided to look up what was nearby on the yelp app. I had Fat Boy bookmarked and it was only a couple of blocks from where we tried to eat first, so we headed to Fat Boy.

Walking inside there wasn't much space and there were plenty of customers. There are maybe 4 or 5 tables and we were lucky enough after ordering to snatch one up. The food is made to order and since it was busy we had to wait our turn for our food to come out, but I was patient since it smelled of yummy pizza throughout the place and the vibe inside was awesome.

I asked the man who took our order if the bacon was made fresh since this would alter if I would order it or not. He said that indeed was! I ordered a "BLT Sandwich" priced at just $3.24 for the sandwich by itself, or $6.23 to make it a combo with fries and a drink. I made mine a combo and substituted regular fries for "Chencho Fries" which was a very smart decision. The BLT came out on a burger bun with fresh shredded lettuce, tomato and mayo. I was surprised at the amount of bacon on the sandwich for the price. I was pleased with the flavor of the BLT and would happily order it again with a little extra mayo. You can order the Chencho Fries with skinny or fat fries. The cashier suggested the skinny fries so I went with that and hubby had the fat fries with his. The Chencho Fries have a little bit of chicken with green sauce and cheese. Yum! I loved these fries! Get over here and try these fries! Hubby had a "Pastrami Boyger" and couldn't stop talking about how good the pastrami was so we came back a couple days later for dinner again!

This time hubby went with a full on "Pastrami Sandwich" and loved it. I knew after smelling the pizza a couple days before that I had to give it a try. They have a pick-up only special where you can get a 14" one topping pizza for $5.49 so I was all over that! I ordered a cheese pizza and a side of ranch to dip it in. The owner (turns out this was who took our order the first time) came over to our table and talked to me about the pizza and how he makes the dough from scratch everyday. The pizza was cheesy and the sauce and crust tasted great. I just can't believe how good it tastes for such a great price. I don't live near Fat Boy, but it's worth the drive and I will absolutely be back! 

They offer a good variety of menu options from pizza, boygers, wings, fingers, salads, sandwiches, milkshakes, bottled drinks and fountain drinks. They also offer boyrritos, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas and even serve breakfast! They have different specials and family deals too.

I had decided that I was not giving in to the "Pig-themed" restaurants.  I mean "Pig", "Pork" and "Swine" restaurants are popping up everywhere!  But I noticed that, no matter how hard I tried to ignore P&P, it would pop-up on all of the foodie sites that I check around Phoenix.  So, for several months, I scoped this place out... checked out this restaurant online and with daily drive-bys in my daily commute.  I finally decided 2 months ago that I needed to check out P&P.  I was sold, food-whipped on my first visit and I've been every week since.  They source all their veggies locally.  They make as much as they can in house from the meats on the chacuterie tray to the pickled veggie/items that appear on every dish.  They even bake their own bread!  I fell in love y'all, with a Pig & Pickle.

This restaurant is in a nondescript strip of shops.  I could not tell you what stores exist adjacent to P&P.  It is off the well "beaten Scottsdale Rd" path, and yet, the food is exciting, relevant and has a depth of flavors that is unbelievable.  I'm a fan of P&P and once you give it a try, I think you will be too.

I have tried a few things on the menu, let me start with the crafted cocktails - pricey, but still yummy and worth every penny.  They carry premium spirits and they make just about everything that goes in those crafted drinks from scratch.  If you don't want to spend $12 per cocktail, they have a wonderful HH menu with $5 cocktails from 4-6pm. Satly Dog: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pig-and-pickle-scottsdale?select=aG_8tn9ZxqvTDDwRB-tfhA#wshXHwfqyLloLxHV7g86eQ 


The star of P&P is the food.  I have tried several things on the menu and I'm happy to say that not one thing was even remotely disappointing.  Everything that I've been served there was 4 Stars and above.  My favorite item thus far was on the new brunch menu.  P&P started serving brunch this past Sunday.  After church, I stopped in and ordered the Bloody Sconnie and the Bacon, Andouille Sausage and Aisago Cheese Fratta.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=f-ez6J4BhI4U2Gk_Brvr7Q&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA  An extremely delicious dish that is really more like a crustless quiche.  This dish has a serious (and I mean SERIOUS) kick to it.  It is not for the people who can't handle spicy food.  This dish was excitingly delicious.  

My 2nd favorite was the braised pork belly http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=od8GMSNVUu4fAT3H1IoqcA&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA   The braised pork belly sat atop a delicious mound of mashed turnip bottoms.  The pork belly provided the right amount of saltiness that was balanced just right by the sweetness of the apple butter.  The arugula top the creation was just the right amount of earthiness to pair with the turnip bottoms.  I love all the flavors.  But as I told my mom, it was almost like eating a southern meal that contained ALL these ingredients, but prepared somewhat differently!    

During Happy Hour, they offer a chacuterie plate http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=n62C4gnnQkajkiORQ-tpaw&userid=DHQWSHz6b7Jsy-A04m1cIA that is HUGE for the $5 that they charge!  In this pic, the chacuterie included bacon butter to spread on my homemade pretezel bread.  YUMMY... YUM is all I can say!  

To top it off, they have the nicest guys working behind the bar.  I mean... honestly, part of what makes my day when I go into a place like this are cute guys who can mix a drink and order up some food for me to eat.  Clayton and Scott are awesomely attentive and I just love sitting at their bar!  

My to try list (because I trust everything on their menu):
Shrimp and Grits
Braised Duck Leg
Croque Madame
Salmon Tot - 6/30/2013 - 4star. 
Pork Shoulder Tostadas

Each 3rd Monday of the Month, join them for Beer Dinner 6:30pm.  I'm hopeful they will have other events in the future.  I think their crafted cocktails would be a great thing to center an event around.

Oh gosh, they have free wi-fi too!

This is a gem in Scottsdale/Old Town.  Eat, Pig out and Enjoy!

This is my favorite place to stay in Vegas, apart from the lake front "1500" suite at The Bellagio or Villa #1 at The Mirage.  I have stayed at least 5 times at this point.  The service is impeccable, the styling by Tony Chi will inspire you, and the rooms are flat out amazing!  The good news is that the price isn't that outrageous for Las Vegas.  You could certainly spend a lot more for less at other properties.  I know I have.

To start, the hotel will pick you up and drop you off at the airport as a complimentary service.  They use a fleet of Maybachs, so if you have never been in one, here is your chance.  It is very luxurious, but the ride will be short since the Skylofts are on the top floor of the MGM Grand, which is right next door to the airport.  If a Maybach isn't available, they send a limo, but I have never had that happen.

Once you arrive at the hotel, an agent will meet you at the car to escort you directly to your room for check-in.  This is a nice touch as I loathe waiting in a hotel lobby for check-in with a ton of people.  They walk you through the MGM Grand lobby into the VIP, where there is a private hidden bank of elevators that go directly to the top floor of the hotel without stopping.  This is nice because the MGM Grand elevators (there are 6 in each bank) are always FILLED with people and stop at nearly every floor.  When you need the elevator, you just walk past the crowds, through a set of double doors, and into a private elevator to the top.  Stay at the MGM Grand one time and you will understand why this is so valuable for a pleasant overall experience.

When you get the the Skyloft lobby on the top floor, the design will immediately embrace you.  This hotel looks NOTHING like the MGM Grand below.  It is an entirely different property, and it shows.  There isn't a theme so much as a lot of natural elements like earth, fire, water, etc.  You feel different once you enter, and it holds throughout the entire experience.  The designer created everything down to the uniforms worn by the staff.  As you walk by staff members, they stop what they are doing, stand up, and greet you.

When you get to your room, a butler is waiting, complete with white gloves, a tray, and a complimentary cocktail or freshly squeezed glass of juice.  The check-in is quick and requires a few signatures.  Then, the butler will show you around your apt. and the amenities (if you are there for the first time).  It takes a minute to figure everything out because there is a lot of stuff.  I have always stayed in a 2-bedroom unit, but they also have 3-bedroom and 1-bedroom spaces.  The butler will offer to press your clothes or provide any other services you may need.

The 2-bedroom is approximately 3,000 sqare feet on two levels.  Downstairs, you have a dining area for 8, a living room next to the dining room, a pool table room (sometimes a foos ball table), a movie theater with surround sound and a powder bath, a second living room, a breakfast nook with coffee machine (the kind that makes an assortment of drinks using packets) and a sexy entry foyer with a stairway to the upstairs.  The entire place is luxury and you will feel special just being there.

The upstairs has large art installation common space between the two bedrooms.  One room has two queen beds and a huge, spa-style bathroom, and the master has one king bed with the even better spa-style bathroom.

The entire place is completely teched out.  There are Lutron lighting controlers with buttons in the entry that say "day, night, mood, etc".  One click and the entire apartment is set.  There are also Crestron controllers in every room and Bang and Olufsen butterfly stereos in the bedrooms and movie theater.  There are iPod docks in nearly every room as well, and the shades are motorized.  The list goes on and on...

The master bathroom has a huge steam shower with about 9 heads including a rain shower head, a negative-edge soaking tub with led lights and jacuzzi jets, a powder room with bidet, televisions inside of the bathroom mirrors, a dressing area with full length mirrors and lovely storage cabinetry, a scale, a separate bathroom music controller, a large flat screen over the tub, and fantastic robes, towels, and spa products.  The guest bathroom has everything I just listed minus the steam shower feature.  It also has a table with 4 chairs in the dressing area.

The entire place is setup to party.  The best part, you can go crazy in here with the music on full blast and nobody can hear you.  Likewise, you can't hear anybody else.  It is like a Vegas dream come true if you hate hearing the doors of your neighbors open and close during your entire stay.

I am running out of space, but there is a lot more to share.  There is a service entrance to the apt. where the staff can enter your unit and deliver things like the best room service EVER without bothering you.  I could write for an hour about the food options.  5 stars!!!!!

If you come in not really hungry and you end up eating a lot more than you wanted to then the place has to be good, that's exactly what happened to me.  Let's just skip straight to the food. Going from what I took a picture first: 

Salmon Skin Handroll and Something Wrong #69 Roll - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jjanga-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA#GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA 
Ever since Blue Fin Sushi turned me into a Salmon Skin Handrolls junkie I gotta have it every time I do AYCE sushi, if it's offered. It wasn't that bad; it was missing the crunchiness, but did the spot. The Something Wrong #69 was probably one of my favorite rolls. It's a shrimp tempura roll, which I usually a fan of, topped with spicy soft shell crab, tuna, salmon, white fish, and a spicy garlic ponzu. I devoured everything in that picture on my own. Sorry for not that great of a pic but the real stuff looked and tasted delicious.

Oysters - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jjanga-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA#2sMNzctANegqVqvPkGG0lQ 
It was one of the items you could only order one of.  Honestly I love oysters but because I was only limited to 2 I don't think I had enough to like it too much. I inhaled them and don't remember the flavors.

Who's Your Ex-wife and Shrimp Tempura -  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jjanga-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA#wyCtws-hZWHCkw_c3C1EUw 
Now the Who's Your Ex-wife is my kind of eats. I don't remember what exactly it was but I think it was a stuffed fried jalapeno with fish. I kind of wished I went back for seconds so I could've remember more but I liked it a lot cause it was spicy and delicious. The Shrimp Tempura was not bad just know that 1 order is just 2 pieces not your usual handful else where.

Spicy Garlic Edamame - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jjanga-japanese-restaurant-las-vegas?select=GB-a9JAvq6PMaqA4MylUbA#cwzi6JqmNpr2L7IMg3KDlw
No one usually make um like this but I enjoyed them, though I didn't fill myself up on them because I was eating sushi. I'd order um.

Now for the other items:

Screaming O Sashimi - Why not!? I'm always a fan of the sauce as long as it's not too sweet. It was made right to my liking.

Nigiri - Not a great selection but I liked the garlic tuna, hamachi, cajun albacore, and sweet shrimp. Didn't care for the tamago or uni. A lot of the pieces were smaller than I'm use to but it's AYCE so ordering more is fine.

Apps - I liked the Golden Scallops and whatever I already mentioned. I ordered and really wanted the baked green mussels, agedashi tofu, and calamari rings but never got them.

Rolls - Well there's too many I liked so I'll say that there's an awesome selection of spicy, baked, deep fried, and shrimp tempura rolls. Should there ever be anything else!? Some honorable mentions Burning Your Ass roll, Fat Ass roll, Taste Like My X Girlfriend roll, Stacy Mom roll, Sexy Time roll, never mind I just started being immature.   For those try to cut back on rice there are a few no rice rolls.

The customer service was very friendly and brought food out in quickly but struggled keeping track of everyone's order. Jjanga is funny and loud great for kids. Anyways I'm still a fan for mostly everything so I'll be back.

I appologize in advance for my long winded review. I tend to go into great detail when leaving 1 & 2 Star ratings out of fairness. Obviosuly there are mixed reviews on the SLS the following is my experience for my recent stay at SLS Casino 9/12/14-9/15/14

I was tempted to only give 1-Star but there were a couple positives which boosted my rating up to a 2-Star. Let me also say I really wanted to like this place. My friends and I all get comped rooms at a dozen casinos in Vegas but opted to pay for our rooms to check out this new Vegas destination. I have stayed at SLS Miami Beach and it was great...SLS Las Vegas not so much.

Let me start out by saying I am a Vegas regular, I visit Vegas 6-8 times a year and have been doing so for the past 10 years or so and have stayed at nearly every major, newer hotel/casino property on and off the strip. Let me also start out by saying SLS is nowhere on par with the ultra high-end Hotel/Casinos in Vegas such as Cosmopolitan or Wynn. Parts of the property looked very nice but other parts look like they just threw a coat of paint of the old Sahara stuff and called it new. Throw in the fact that the SLS far North Strip location is a long nearly $18-$20 cab ride to anywhere on the strip and it makes it even worse and the cab lines were slow because no cabs were coming to the SLS. Be prepared to wait in the cab lines and plan accordingly if you have reservations or headed to a show somehwere on the strip. 

My room looked nothing like the photo of the room shown on their website. Our room was small...tiny actually We were told the room would have 2 queen beds and it only had 2 small double beds. The mattress was uncomfortable and climate control in the room was terrible. We reserved 2 rooms on our reservastion and both rooms were tiny. Blinds/shades on the windows are terrible, they let in lots of light, it's Vegas, I want to party until 6:00am then sleep until noon in a dark room but that is not possible at the SLS. Room was clean but then again the SLS has only been open about 3 weeks so it should be clean. Housekeeping was good and prompt.

VIP services were terrible. We had a difficult time trying to reach someone to reserve a cabana at the pool but we finally got it taken care of after 4 phone calls...ughhh. Also had difficulty gettig ahold of someone in the cage or a casino host before my trip to get wire transfer info. I ended up just wiring my funds to another casnio where I already had an account...sorry, your loss SLS

On Saturday we got a cabana at the Foxtail pool which is the larger pool with more of a chill laid back vibe, very nice pool, one of the few high points of the property. Our cabana cost us $750 in food and beverage minimum purchase, however we ended up spending about $2000(our own doing). Sunday we did the Beach Life pool on the roof top above LIFE nightclub. Sunday is a slow day and we got a $550 min cabana. We had to walk up about 4 flights of stairs because the elevators were not working....really???  The rooftop pool is small and cramped, I would suggest the Foxtail pool over the Beach Life Pool.


The day we were at the Foxtail pool a VIP host approached us and asked if we wanted to go to LIFE Nightclub Saturday night. We were promised a $3000 table on the dance floor. When we arrived Saturday Night they tried upselling us telling us that the floor table would now cost us $5000-$6000. When I asked what table we would get for the $3000 they showed us a diagram of the club on his cell phone of a tiny table pushed of a couple tiers up from dance floor...Absolutley unacceptable so we headed to Marquee where we know exactly what we get for our money. 

Another high point of the SLS was my dining experience at Jose Andreas Bazaar Meats, I will be leaving a seperate review. There are also a couple of nice shops inside SLS, specifically Fred Segal shops. 

I will probably not return simply becuase there are MUCH better place in Vegas, the room rates are not on par with the quality and level of service offered by some other casinos in town. I feel we were mislead on the type of room  we reserved and their VIP nightlife services were terrible. The place left such a bad taste in my mouth I spent more time at and did more gambling at other properties( HRH and Cosmo) over the weekend than I did at the SLS. The only way I would even consider giving this place a second chance is if they comped my rooms for an entire weekend and since I did most of my play elsewhere(where I get comped rooms) that is unlikely.

Summary: Stay away unless you get a killer deal(like $100 per night weekend rate Max), advertised website rates are too high for level of service and quality. I think we paid $360 a night for a standard crappy room. For similar money you can get a great room at Cosmo I was expecting much more out of this place.

Arrived back from a terrific meal at Beckett's Table!  Before I wax on, I would like to say kudos to the Becketts and Stephens' on their 2nd opening night!  FOH was in fine form (from the immediate greeting at the hosts' stand; to server Cort's affable personality & eagerness to please, as well as server Travis' assistance throughout the evening; and yet another server's readiness to show me to the restroom, instead of pointing the way.  (An example of four-diamond service, and I should know, since we're given the four-diamond spiel daily where I work!)  When I inquired deeper into the Legend City cocktail's ingredients, Cort offered to have Scott Stephens, the drink's inventor and BT's co-owner, come out to greet and tell me about it himself!  

As soon as I crossed the wide-open sliding-door glass panels and into the restaurant, I was in-love w/ the ambience!  It's rustic St. Francis (and a little bit of The Parlor) meets laid-back, yet mysteriously sexy Olive & Ivy.  (Think what you will about these venues' food and ambience, but I happen to love the spaces of all three!)  Really liked how I could watch what was going on in the kitchen, bar, community tables, and the main dining room w/out being subjected to too much noise.  Even the restroom door had a bit of novelty to it- go check it out and see what I mean.

Alright, so what about the food??  Where shall I start??
Let me preface by saying that I already knew what I wanted, having checked out the menu online after reading about Opening Night at BT (but I'd already eaten, darn it!), but I played along and had a look at the lovely watermarked printed menu Cort gave me.  Didn't know if I felt like  having cockails or wine yet, so I asked for the Bacon cheddar biscuits and the Mac 'n Cheese w/ pancetta, please.  Wanted to try the Legend City cocktail, but wasn't sure what "ricard" was (and now know, thanks to Scott!).  When Cort came back for my drink order, I asked "the short ribs (a fave of one of the hosts'), or the osso bucco?"  W/out batting an eyelash, Cort said "get the osso bucco; it's my favorite on the entire menu!"  Sold!  As I waited for my biscuits and macaroni dish, I spied next table's inhabitants (Hi Karen and Elsa!) breaking into their table bread, so I asked Cort if I could have some, too, please!  Looking all around me, at the hustle-bustle of the kitchen and everyone's smiling faces, I knew I was in for a treat!

The bacon cheddar biscuits were delightful!  Loved the crusty cheese topping, and I enjoyed feeling the weight of the biscuit in my hands as I tore off a piece to peer inside-- it was like I was on slow-mo' breaking bread!  (Cue in "Six Billion Dollar Man" bionic sound effect here.)  You must order this and smell the aroma!  It tasted heavenly, and while the apple-honey butter was tasty, its presence wasn't needed.  The complimentary bread rolls were also delicious!  Take away the biscuits and leave me the rolls, and I'd still be happy!  Don't forget to mention the mac 'n cheese!  They don't make the pastas in-house, but they are ordered in especially ("no ordinary pasta," said Cort).  The tasty cream sauce consisted of a blend of some of my favorite cheeses, which included asiago, fontina, manchego, and white cheddar.  Crispy pancetta on top sealed the deal.  I may just have to order this side dish every time I visit!

Next came the pork osso bucco confit.  I neglected to ask which local butcher shop the pork came from, so I can't say.  However, I will say that this dish, on the whole, was a beauty!  It came w/ butternut squash spaetzle (so pretty!) and crisp roasted veggies (golden beets, yellow squash, brussels sprouts, shallots, and perhaps leeks).  The pork confit sat atop a lovely and piquant black pepper reduction.  While I thought that the presentation could've been better (the pork itself didn't look quite finished, temp-wise, but I assure you it was!), the textures and flavor bouquets in this dish were very pleasing, indeed.

So what came next?  Could anything else impress me after all I've tried?  Ah, yes.  I ordered the Death By Chocolate, which was chocolate ganache on top of dense chocolate cake filled w/ chocolate buttercream, w/ a dusting of finely-grated chocolate on top.  Y'know, just for looks.  Jeez-louise!  Talk about killing me softly!  I've achieved transcendence.  For now.

I'll be back- thanks BT!

***Bouchon's brunch is a good and not-too-expensive alternative to Vegas' breakfast buffets and their chicken and waffles is a good place to start***

This Bouchon location at The Venetian is open for breakfast Monday thru Friday, dinner nightly and brunch on the weekends.  I believe the Beverly Hills location is just open for lunch and dinner so it made sense to give this Vegas spot a try for a nice brunch.

Bouchon is located on the tenth floor of the hotel.  They seem to have three dining areas--a classic indoor brasserie, outdoor dining and a private room for private parties and larger groups (which is where we dined on this visit).  I haven't been to their outdoor dining area, but the private room lacks the classic French brasserie feel of the main dining area.  The tables though are still nice (white table cloth) and the seating is comfortable.

For brunch, they started us off with a complimentary epi baguette that was served with butter and a smooth/thick cherry jam.  The epi baguette (a wheat stalk shaped bread where you rip off individual baguettes) was good.  The bread's crust was good and distinct while the center had a good chew to it.  The butter spread easily and the jam was flavorful.

I went with their signature roasted chicken and bacon and chive waffles.  The roasted chicken was very good.  It was a half chicken.  The breast was tender and moist.  The skin had a great flavor and was nicely crispy.  The thigh and leg had much more flavorful meat as well as crispy skin (not too greasy or fatty either).

They served the chicken with a Sauce Chasseur.  The chicken was very flavorful and did not need it, but the sauce was a great accompaniment.  The sauce was similar to a brown gravy and was very flavorful.  The sauce had a good white wine taste to it and there were chunks of good veggies in it including mushrooms, carrots and onions.

The bacon and chive waffle was fluffy.  It was an interesting flavor combination.  First, you taste the vanilla (they used a good amount of it in the waffle).  Then you get the crispy and savory bacon taste.  Then you get the onion-like chive taste.  The waffle was garnished with a creamy Tahitian vanilla butter and maple syrup.  I am not sure if the flavor combination would be for everyone, but I liked the waffle.

I also had some of the bacon a la carte and it was pretty good.  Flavorful and crisp though maybe not as good as some of the premium bacon out there (like the Niman Ranch bacon they serve at Huckleberry).

Service was good.  The waiter was friendly, polite and attentive.  The rest of the staff was attentive too.  Food came out an okay pace (maybe slightly slower than we would have liked).  Still, despite being a large party, all the food came out at about the same time.

For brunch, pricing was high here, but then pricing is high at a lot of Vegas restaurants.  Entrees run anywhere from about $15 to $25 here.  The good thing is that portions on most of the dishes are big enough that you do not have to supplement your order with any sides or pastries (they were providing a complimentary coffee cake-like dish in the waiting area and it was good).

This was my second visit to the Las Vegas Bouchon.  I've also been to the Beverly Hills one.  The roasted chicken and waffles was the best thing I've had here at either location and I would most likely come back here again for brunch if I was in Vegas for the weekend.  Service and food have been decent enough on both visits that I would also consider them for dinner.

There is a free parking structure at The Venetian.  The free parking structure has elevators that conveniently take you to the Bouchon restaurant without having to walk through the casino.

Reflective of visit May 2012.

Do not go, do not go, do not go, do not go. I can't say that enough. If I could give a negative rating I would.

Decor: I've got too much to talk about to waste characters here.  But to note:  I am handicapped, and there is no elevator. I understand it is an old building, so actually not their fault, but it was the first omen of a bad night and should be noted for any handicapped patrons who may be reading this review. Even to get to the inside dining room, there is no ramp, only stairs, albeit 2 steps, but still.

Service: Ha! Negative 5 stars. We were there as guests of a sizable private party, and seated outside and served buffet style. Many of us, including my husband, approached the outdoor bar instead of going back inside to the main. There were two bartenders, a female and male. He tried to order from the male. "Do you have Malibu rum?" Reply: "No." "Okay, what about a 7&7?" Reply: "Nope." "Fine then, just a plain Coke." Reply: "We don't have Coke." "Okay... what do you have?" The bartender starts to lift up bottles to show my husband. One of which is rum, not Malibu, fine, but then the correct response at the beginning should have been, "Sorry sir, I don't have Malibu, but I do have 'insert brand here.' Would you like that?" Anyway, as he sees the bottle of rum in front of his eyes, he also sees a cocktail waitress next to him ordering from the female bartender-- 2 rum and cokes, so my husband asks for that, as he sees her pouring said rum and popping open cans of coke for the waitress' drinks. He tells male bartender "I'll take one of those--a rum and coke." Reply is an exacerbated "We don't have Coke!" My husband is in disbelief. Finally the female says, "Yes, we do," and hands the man a can. The male says to my husband, "Oh, I guess we do," mixes the cocktail, and there is no apology or even sheepish or embarrassed expression.

Next, the buffet line of tapas chosen by the host: at sundown on the patio with little light (as well as the fact most items were fried past recognition) many of us couldn't see or figure out what was being served. My husband, ever the optimist, even after his bar escapade, asked the staff member working the buffet line if he could tell us (aka me, him, and his elderly uncle) what that the items were. Staff member's response: He scoffed, and said "EVERYTHING?!?!?!" (Oh, I'm sorry for putting you out by asking you to assist me, which is your job!) My husband quietly, being made to feel like the rude one in the situation, if not an idiot, both of which were untrue and uncalled for, said, "Well, yes." So the horrendously rude server quickly pointed and offered no explanation other than, "Pork sandwiches, lamb, chicken, and all the same repeated at the other end." First of all, even I could tell via sight that every serving tray held something different, there was no "repeating at the other end," but whatever...Anyway, based on that amazingly helpful [please read sarcasm] explanation, we chose a few items and went to our seats. Mr. Helpful server wasn't even right. His closest "guess" was the "pork sandwiches which turned out to be mini Cubans. Other than that there were fried artichokes and calamari. (Glad I guessed that from its look on the serving table myself, as I hate the stuff and would have "urped" if I mistakenly took a bite.)

Lastly on the service end, I asked a passing waiter if there was a manager I could speak with in order to report the previous server's disrespectful attitude. This waiter refused to get a manager, saying, "Whatever it is, I can help." Fine, I was in no mood to argue. But when I told him, he simply laughed and said, "I'll get you a menu." I was taken aback and replied, "I don't need a menu, it's done. It's just his attitude I have a problem with." He laughed again and offered to bring a menu.  When I insisted again that a menu had nothing to do with it, he laughed more and walked away.  I would bet the bank these employees have either been trained to not get a manager because the manager doesn't want to hear about it, or that they don't want to get a manager because they don't want to show any sign to their superiors that there is, yet another, complaint.

Food: Zero stars.  Most tasteless beyond fried grease, the rest bland.

Trust the undercover Food Network specials--this place is deplorable. I can't believe in an economy where establishments are boarded up daily it seems, that this one has enough customers to stay open, and that it doesn't seem to care if or how it will retain them.

10/06/12

Thank you Pomegranate Cafe, Russell, and all of PC's other staff members for helping me forget, for an hour or so, that I was feeling very much under-the-weather.  l was feeling elated about my upcoming delights, I totally forgot how awful I must have looked wearing yoga pants, a Life is Good tee, a hooded zip pullover, and glasses.  What a bum!  Surprisingly, business was bustling this morning-- I've never seen PC full of people, and get this, there was a LINE waiting to order!  Because most of the tables were taken indoors, it was very noisy, so I took this chance to hide my I'm-sick-as-a-dog bum from the beautiful people and eat OUTDOORS.  But first, I had to place my order.

Since I'd already perused the menu online, I knew I was going to have the French toast, no powdered sugar, please, like I usually do, but I wanted to try something new.  The basic breakfast (egg, toast, jam, and fruit) enticed, but I quickly drew towards Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit.  I also thought I'd either try a smoothie or an elixir ($8 each), but the menu online stated to ask for an elixir menu for options.  There was only one, and it was a "female hormonal concoction" with something, I lost track, since I didn't need help with my hormones, thank you very much.  ("Not that there's anything wrong with that.")  $8 saved.  The smoothie I wanted to try contained pomegranate juice, which I correctly suspected had one or more unwanted ingredients, and for me, that was "grape seed oil extract."  (So glad I spotted those juice bottles in front of the cash register.)  Good- I was able to hang onto $8 of my money.  Last, but not least, I ordered a cappucino (Cartel Coffee) and a glass of water without cucumber.  I again reiterated that I did not want powdered sugar on the French toast, which I was told would take twenty or twenty-five minutes to be ready, since they'd run out of the bread and the next batch was in the oven.  I said it was worth waiting for, so I don't mind, and besides, I'll have the kamut toast and almond butter.  As I paid for my three items, I was told that my food will be out in about 30 minutes, which took me by surprise, but I was in no mood to make a fuss, especially when I needed to secure an empty table before someone else snatched it!

I found one outdoors, but it needed bussing.  No problem, as I found a shy and cute associate to help me.  One thing I really like about frequenting vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free venues, is how most, if not all, of the staff members are so humble, and are good-natured.  Another thing is that these venues tend to look so hippy-chic, colorful, eclectic, and FUN!  I loved the different swaths of colorful curtains, brightly-painted tables and chairs, whimsical dinnerware, and that was indoors!  Outside, I found a mosaic two-top with mismatched chairs- I sat on the one without the morsel of food on its seat.

The food didn't take quite as long as 30 minutes.  The cappucino http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=b5c0q6siFAHnRWC5FU3TYw#b5c0q6siFAHnRWC5FU3TYw took a few minutes to arrive, and so did the lovely-tasting city water, nicely contained in a lidless canning jar.  (There's a reason cucumber slices are used to "flavor" the water, folks!)  It was about ten minutes after I started sipping my coffee that the Banana bread French toast arrived http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw#ZPZ8wSo4IPOrtAmFWejCcw, but it was sprinkled with powdered sugar!  However, Russell did not hesitate in taking it back and bringing another.  What terrific service!  The Kamut toast, almond butter, jam, and fruit plate stayed, however, so I was happy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g#s3KbSXITa6YEFvYgGYv91g  Still happy, even when I found out that the almond butter was the raw variety-- I don't particularly like its flavor, or lack thereof, and I only buy and enjoy the roasted kind.  It's a good thing I am not allergic to chia (still experimenting), sesame, and sunflower seeds, for while the menu did not mention these were included, one certainly could not avoid their presence on this dish!  It's also a good thing they were, since they gave the bland-tasting almond butter much-needed flavor.  The fun textures on this dish also gave my mouth something to be happy about!  The Banana bread French toast arrived about 5 minutes later, and what a marvel that was! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QsJ6orXv_VB7xz-MpqHzSQ?select=vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg#vfafsHCzso2InWi-kcDWBg  The French toast had the PERFECT crunch on the outside, a gorgeous pound-cake-meets-angel-cake consistency on the inside, and a wonderful roasted-banana scent filled the air around my face that soon delighted my taste buds!  The strawberry-rhubarb jam and agave pancake syrup added lovely velvety coats of sweetness and colors, as well.  I could've eaten the entire dish!

I'll be back!

So, somehow, I had never heard of this place. I can't even recall how I stumbled onto it. Probably when Googling something like, "top places in Arizona that make you feel like you're dining in the movie 'The Secret Garden'". Or something like that.

This place is spec.tac.u.lar (said like Kevin Spacey from American Beauty).

My friend and I just kinda went on a whim on a Thursday night, not knowing what to expect. I didn't realize the menu was prix fixe, but the hostess quickly filled us in on the details - $45 for a 3-course meal. Salad, entree, and dessert. Fine by us. We were greeted by extremely friendly staff and a delightful little patio, lit up by soft lighting and actual candles. Not that fake fire plastic cheesy bullshit. We were seated by a little fountain at a small table with a chair on one end, and then a 2-person couch on the other. Clearly meant for some type of romantic snuggling. A few minutes later, the owner, Christian, came by to chat with us a bit about the history of the place. He was very friendly and sincere.

Our server took our beverage orders and I said something along the lines of, "I dunno, gimme something fruity. No cucumbers". He brought back something perfect for both of us, and they were SKRONG drinks. I was already giggling like a schoolgirl. Luckily, the eggplant salad came out quickly after to soak up some of that alcohol. It was super unique; filled with diced tomatoes, olives, chunks of eggplant and a bunch of other tasty stuff neatly placed on a bed of greens. Oh, I should mention, their menu changes daily, so you get something unique every time you go. Not sure if it changes for lunch/brunch, but for dinner it does. The salad and dessert are the same, but you have 2 choices for entrees. It makes ordering very simple. My friend had the short ribs and I had the shrimp polenta. Our entrees followed quickly after the salad, both looking and tasting delightful. I honestly don't know what the Hell polenta is, but it was yummy. Everything was so fresh and simple, and being a bit of a cheap, uncultured person, I appreciate things that are simple. I had a bite of the short ribs as well - tender AF. Lastly, our desert came out. Simple as well. Just a lovely brownie with some ice cream and wait...HOD UP. Is this brownie toffee!?? Yes, it was a toffee brownie. I tried to be polite and take adorable girly bites, but fuck it. I ate that thing in like 5 seconds. Afterward, the chef himself stopped by to get our feedback on the food. He was a character. Funny, friendly guy who unfortunately told us he was moving back to San Diego in a month. But I'm sure whoever replaces him will be just as badass. I would expect nothing less at this point.

So after 2 drinks and a 3-course meal, I'd say yeah. We were pretty satisfied. Our bill came to about $120 total. Not what we had intended on spending, but certainly worth every penny. This place is really great for a romantic evening, a special occasion, and definitely a wedding. I haven't been for brunch or lunch yet, they've been booked up the past couple of Sundays sadly. But I can't wait to try it and write a novel on how I feel about it for your reading pleasure.

You're welcome.

***Bellagio has many iconic Las Vegas elements like the fountains, their seasonal gardens, the popular Cirque du Soleil show O, and high-end cuisine; these features make Bellagio a must visit to at least just take a look; however (on my visit), my room was not as nice as other upscale hotels I have stayed at on The Strip***

When I first visited Las Vegas a long time ago, Bellagio was the most talked about hotel and the most upscale hotel (or at least near the top) on The Strip.  Since then, there have been many new hotels that have joined The Strip and some as elegant or even more elegant than Bellagio.

Bellagio definitely has a beautiful exterior with the impressive and vast lake as well as the signature fountains.  Inside, you will find the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens--a constantly changing (with the seasons) exhibit that makes for a good photo opportunity.  Bellagio also features quite a few notable fine dining spots including Picasso, Le Cirque and Michael Mina.  There is also a gourmet French patisserie (Jean Philippe) though all of these great things are open to the public and do not require a room stay, which is expensive though often less expensive than The Cosmopolitan, Wynn or Encore.

My room was nice.  It was fairly contemporary though there were a lot of traditional touches with the bedding and furniture.  The room did lack the sleek and modern look of the rooms at Aria.

The bathroom was nice--very spacious with standalone showers and bath tubs.  There were a few areas where the room could have been better.  The TV was an old fashioned deep TV and not a flat screen.  I often never turn on a hotel room TV though I imagine some would be disappointed to find such an outdated TV in an upscale hotel like Bellagio.

The other negative, which was a big one, was the room temperature.  The A/C unit was not that good and even after having maintenance look at it, the room just never got cool enough, which can be a concern here due to the very hot summers.  It seems other Yelp reviews indicate the same issue regarding poor A/C units.  However, I believe Bellagio has been refreshing the decor in their rooms so maybe these outdated elements and poor A/C units have been (or will be) improved (I think they have moved onto flat screen TVs).

Also included in the stay was access to the fitness center, which was nice.  The pool area was also nice--many different pools and lots of greens, fountains and other scenery if you are just looking to lounge around.

Service was friendly and prompt.

Room rates are high at Bellagio, but there are times of the year where you can find reasonable room rates.  Bellagio has a room rate calendar on their website, which makes for a useful tool to help you pick a time to stay at Bellagio (best room rates are often during the week though and several top Vegas shows are dark and high end restaurants are closed in the early part of the week).

I wished I liked my room more at Bellagio.  I actually liked Caesars Palace more.  I have heard the quality of the room really varies at which tower you stay at Caesars Palace, but the room I had there felt nicer, more elegant and more comfortable than Bellagio.  And even though my first stay at Aria was at a very small room, my second stay there was at a much bigger room and its modern and sleek look felt more upscale than Bellagio.

If you can get a good room rate at Bellagio though, it can be a good hotel choice on The Strip.  It is still a nice hotel and it has a great location--right next to Caesars Palace and The Cosmopolitan, which is a real hot spot right now.  Even if you do not stay at Bellagio, it is a must visit for first time Las Vegas travelers to check out the Fountains of Bellagio, the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens and some of their food (either a more cost friendly option like Jean Philippe or one of their upscale restaurants like the good-for-Vegas Picasso).

Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free valet and self parking.

Ahhhhhhhhhh. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale.

That was going through my mind while we were trying to tough it out in the Herbal Steam Room. Let's rewind a little bit though. 

The Imperial Health Spa is definitely easy to miss! It is not located ON Sahara because you have to turn onto a little little street in order to get to it. Wherever your Maps tells you it is, turn into there. If it had not been for my best friend's guess, we would've missed that turn. I fancy that it's tucked away though.. like a guilty pleasure.

Upon walking in with my best friend, we were greeted by a nice, young man and he asked how he could help us. I informed him that we were looking to purchase day passes and then he started setting us up right away. He took my payment after giving us our pink shorts and shirts, wristbands, towels, and we also asked for slippers. Remember to ask them for some if you did not bring any! After that, he asked if we had been here before or if it was our first time and then he began explaining the process of their Korean spa. He pointed out where the razors and toothbrushes were near the desk and then told us to come back to the front if we needed extra towels. We thanked him and then went on our merry way into the Women's Spa Area. 

After we walked in, you cannot miss it, shoe lockers. Take your shoes off, put it in the number that coordinates with your wristband/key and throw your little slippers on. Walk more into the area and you will see lockers on the right hand side. These lockers are awesome. Stick your key in, turn it to the right, hear some whirring, and then it opens your locker. After you are done changing.. close your locker, twist the key to the left and remove. Keep this on your wrist at all times.

First things first. Walk into the vanity area and through the glass door. On your right hand side will be showers. Take a shower as this is the first of many to prep you for your day. If these showers are ever crowded, there are a few more passed the cold plunge. On the left are squat down showers and on the right are the normal, upright ones. After you shower, go about your spa journey.

There are three tubs: cold, warm, and hot. The Warm Tub is the biggest and also the only one with working jets. The rule is that you have to be completely nude in order to use the tubs. Strip off that bathing suit (if you had one on in the first place) and let yourself relax! We started with the warm tub to let ourselves begin to relax. After that, we showered. We then added cold water to our provided facial towels, wrung them, and made our way to the Herbal Steam Room. This one was fun, but boy was it hard to breathe without that towel on your face. What did we do after that? You guessed it. We showered. We went into the dry sauna and hung out in there for a bit before I started getting hungry. We showered off again and then put on our pink outfits to go upstairs to the coed area.

There was no one at the counter, but an instruction paper said to ring the bell and we did. A very sweet lady came out and took our order. It took about 10 minutes. I ordered the Ramen and my best friend ordered the Won Ton Soup. We both agreed that our food was delicious and they even cleaned up after you. You don't need money to order the food! They charge it to your locker number, and you pay for that at checkout. 

Red Clay Ball Room time! Luckily, we had brought our towels with us and laid them on top of the clay balls before we went in because those suckers were definitely warmed up! The pit is big enough for two people, but of course, laying together made us a little rambunctious. Luckily, the only other people in there were a couple who were talking and laughing loudly so they didn't seem to mind us. I did notice the "Quiet Area" sign. Whoops, sorry guys xP Also, the floor is hot! Be careful getting in and out. All of the amenities have signs next to them that advise you on how to properly and safely use their facilities. 

We entered the Red Clay Room with the red clay domes and attempted to relax, but we were again, too hyper. The floor's hot everywhere, yikes. We took a peek into the Jade Room, but didn't enter because the women in there seemed thoroughly relaxed while doing their bikram yoga and we didn't want to disturb them. We both agreed that we missed the Warm Tub so after taking a peek into the Salt Dry Sauna Room, we showered and went back into the Warm Tub. After that, we took a real shower with our own products and got ready in the Vanity Area. Definitely lots of space. Q-tips, Suave hair products, tissues, and hair dryers are provided.

Afterwards, drop everything that doesn't belong to you in the provided hampers if you haven't been doing so along the way, and then give your key back to the receptionist. Go about your night after a beautiful spa day!

THANK YOU to all of the Yelpers who wrote tips on their reviews about what to expect. It definitely prepared me for the experience!

As i rubbed my overstuffed belly, dude said it's ok if i want to unbutton. I told him i unbuttoned already about 30 min ago!

Wowee, i think i consumed more food here that i did at the buffets. 
I brought my relatives here to treat them to a nice steak dinner, without breaking the bank. 
For restaurant week, they were doing a great deal (which is pretty much half of their power couple meal). For $50, you get a 3 course meal. Most of our table ordered that, while my dude and uncle just got their manly bone in Rib Eyes. The deal came with a Petit Filet and crabcake, along with salad and dessert. But ur allowed to tweak your meal and don't necessarily have to stick with the written options- a few items, u have to pay extra for. 
You start off with huge sesame seed bread served with butter. Not the best bread steak house bread i've had, but it was soft and yummy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=0BlIFseV-5Hd16I-PcRrXQ 

My Del's salad was awesome!. Mainly cuz it came with two huge pieces of delicious thick but crisp bacon on top!!! I got mine with an avocado dressing which was so good! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=Gl37AEprIq227kFoigLohw

The petit Filet was pretty filling and cooked nicely med rare.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=fNMin5UVASwyyFBm_eMUlg
The bone in Rib Eye was good as well, dude loved it as he's had it before. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=HyA9h7GFL35u0YrUgi3uvg  It was good, but i felt it lacked that buttery char that i love on my rib eye. Mastros i say still does a better Bone In Rib eye. 

For sides, the staff comes around and spoons out the sides you ordered, which come in large portions that u could share them. 
I tried the spinach (creamy with bacon!), and mushrooms were ok. 
The baked potato looked good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=_fxRw3wX86gejNGyy2rAWg

The crabcakes were pretty good. 
My uncle got the Salmon and said that the Tchoupitoulas sauce it came with was delicious and light. 
My aunt got the seared tuna steak- which was good but not great. She enjoyed the crab cake more. 

We all let out some gasps when we saw the humongous desserts!
We were too stuffed but couldn't resist the yummy looking desserts. 
The bread pudding was the best-  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=J4y4JWu2Kzjwv4Q_Ein0cQ
Strawberry cheesecake was huge and very cream cheesy than sweet 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=NiuW7t29bUx5BSZYH-8DKw
Chocolate mousse was delicious. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=PU3xnSpdx9YjuOQpNiNikQ
One dessert, i think is big enough to share between 3 people, esp after having a huge dinner already. 

Service was outstanding. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and took his time explaining everything and made us all feel very comfortable. We saw atleast 10 different wait staff come to our table, either refilling our drinks (even after one sip!) or bringing out our dishes. 

I signed up for their rewards card which racks you up points for dollars spent for gift cards. They charge u an initial fee of $25.00 which they reinburse you in the form of a giftcard for later. You can also sign up online before going there, so you can use it on your first visit. Be sure to let them know of any b-days, as u will get a comped dessert!

I believe you need a lot of sophistication to enjoy Japanese Curry. It's just these small little differences with the spices that separates  a J-Curry place from being "good" and "great". And, I believe that JAPANESE CURRY ZENBAYASHI has achieved Greatness. 

This is a rare Japanese restaurant where they pay attention to the smallest details. For example, today the Rakkyo was perfectly cut in a distinct geometric style, which made every single piece look identical in size and shape. At first, I thought I was seeing things but eventually after watching Mr. Zenbayashi working so carefully in the kitchen, I came the conclusion that they spend hours before the store opens preparing everything to look beautiful and artistic.

Unlike similar restaurants, JCZ will refrigerate the condiments such as Tonkatsu Sauce, Rakkyo, and Fukujinzuke. They wait till a customer arrives and then they bring them out with new clean serving spoons. Other places around town will merely keep the condiments sitting out on the table all day long with the same serving spoons which had been touched by many dirty hands. But, you won't find that problem here. This is the most spotless and clean restaurant I have seen in Las Vegas.  Even the bathroom looked like no one had ever used it. 

Just like INABA, this place prides itself on having a dish that not only tastes great, but has tons of health benefits. They have a homemade Gram Masala which is a combination of about 15 spices such as Turmeric, Coriander, Black Pepper, Cumin, Cardamom, Fennel, Japanese Chili Pepper, Ginger, Garlic, Paprika, and many more. Unlike Indian Curry, J-Curry is lower in calories and fat content. It also has anti-oxidents, digestive benefits, blood cleansing, and even anti-aging benefits. 

I actually came here by accident today, I spent most of the day loitering at Jen G's place of work.  After about 3 hours of bugging her, she told me to "BUY SOMETHING OR GET OUT!", so I went straight to JCZ! ...Just kidding. Actually, the true story does involve me loitering at Jen G's place of employment, but we had a conversation about Kabuto, and both of us agreed we should go there and give it another try. I actually didn't like my last visit to Kabuto on account of being spoiled by Urusawa in LA. But, I ended up going over there anyway  to make a reservation. While I was in the parking lot, I noticed the JCZ sign.  David Y had recommended the place to me earlier, and he told me that it was exactly what he used to get in Japan, so I gave it a try. And Dave was right, it was the best. I don't know why people would rather eat at overrated Monta when JAPANESE CURRY ZEN is only a 15 second walk. And the best part of JCZ is that it doesn't have a 2 hour waiting list, uncomfortable seating, overflowing toilet, hipsters and emos reciting poetry, and non-japanese cooks who cook the eggs in the back alley(read my review on Monta to understand that better). And that's another thing that makes JCZ great, it's 100% Japanese staffed. Sure, I actually know Chinese and Filipino Sushi Chefs who make some Japanese ones look like amateurs, but the point is that it's always so unique to find a J-restaurant that is 100% Japanese staffed.

The best thing on the menu is the Pork Tenderloin Curry. Do not confuse this with the normal Pork Cutlet. The Pork Tenderloin Curry will not be on the main menu. You have to ask for it specifically. Today, the cook put so much attention into making sure the cutlet was fried perfectly. The color was beautifully golden brown, and the texture of the meat was so juicy and soft that I ended up eating it all in less than 5 minutes. 

This was the best service I have ever had as a 1st timer. Sure, there are some Japanese owned restaurants that treat me better, but that's because I've spent a lot of money there. For example, when I walk into "Sushi on Rainbow", it's like that scene in "Goodfellas" when Robert De Niro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they open the door for him, save him  his usual seat, and everyone gets whatever he wants before he even has to ask. That's how good some places treat me because I show up regularly, I treat older Japanese workers with a lot of respect,  and because I'm f*cking rich I tend to leave giant tips. But, even though this was my first time at JAPANESE CURRY ZEN, they already were treating me like I had spent over $1000 here. And of course, even though I only spent like $10.00 on curry I left a $20 tip. And the server earned every penny of that because it really was the best service I've had in years. 

JAPANESE ZEN CURRY is a small independent business, not a million dollar bankrolled J-restaurant. Even though there is a rumor that this place is owned by the Mon-group, the server told me that it's just not true. This is a small business that needs the support of the Japanese-American community here in Las Vegas. So, I encourage all LV Japanese residents to come try this place out and support them.

***Like a lot of Vegas restaurants, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is expensive, but the food is very nicely plated and delicious (contemporary food but also tried and true flavor combinations)***

I went to the L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Tokyo two years ago and I had a very good experience so I decided to give the Vegas location a try.  The restaurants are fairly similar.  They both feature very similar decors (sharp reds against dark blacks to give the restaurant a very modern and trendy feel).  Both restaurants also feature bar seating around the open kitchen (a great view of the talented chefs at work).

There are other similarities.  Both locations feature a lot of modern dishes--whether available as small plates or in a seasonal tasting menu.

There are differences as well.  The Tokyo location is much bigger.  The Tokyo location also takes pastry very seriously.  The bread at the Vegas location is decent, but it does not compare that well to the Tokyo location.  The Tokyo location even has a high-end patisserie on site, which features upscale French pastries as well as individual cakes/desserts.

The food was very good at both locations though I probably liked the food at the Vegas location more.  The Tokyo location seemed more representative of the country's cuisine though.  The restaurant featured a lot of Japanese ingredients--whether Japanese fish, Japanese raised beef or mushrooms.  The menu at the Vegas location felt like a menu you might see anywhere.

I went with the tasting menu at the Vegas location and almost everything was very good.  I also added their crispy langoustine as an additional item.  Here is a rundown on their tasting menu.

(Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan) This was okay though I wish the foie gras taste was stronger.

(Confit of mediterranean vegetables with fresh mint in a radish cannelloni) The flavors were simple and light, but I liked the varying textures and flavors as well as the presentation.

(Poached oysters with chive migonenette) These were good.  The oysters were warm and soft while the dressing was flavorful.

(Langoustines with green curry and coconut milk) These were exceptional.  The langoustines were sweet and very moist (also very soft).  The garnishes were not that strong, which allowed the flavor of the langoustines to really shine.

(White onion tart topped with smoked applewood bacon, quail egg, parmesan, and asparagus) This was kind of a take on breakfast.  I really liked the crispy (hash brown-like) onion tart as well as the rich yolk of the quail egg.  I thought the bacon could have been crispier.

(Crispy langoustine fritter, basil pesto, salad) I ordered this as an additional course.  The crispy shell of the fritter was good--light, crispy and not greasy.  The basil leaf tucked inside the shell also gave the fritter a nice fragrance.  The langoustine was also good (moist), but it did not have the sweetness or softness of the other langoustine dish.

(John Dory, baby leeks, tomato, buttery shellfish sauce with lime and ginger, pomme puree) This was small but good.  The John Dory was moist and light (though the fish still had a good flavor).  I liked the mix of the butter sauce with the creamy, buttery pomme puree and the fresh tomato and leek salsa.

(Foie gras stuffed quail, pomme puree, herb salad with truffle vinaigrette) Though the foie gras stuffing was just okay, the quail was very good.  It was nicely caramelized and had a great sweet and crispy sear as well as juicy meat.  The sauce was rich and good.  I really liked the herb salad--great freshness and fragrant herbs, much better than micro greens (the also strong in flavor truffle vinaigrette was a great pairing).

(Caramel panna cotta, lemon cookie, vanilla ice cream, strawberries) I really liked the panna cotta--smooth and creamy with a very good caramel flavor.  The vanilla ice cream was great--smooth and dense with a great old-fashioned vanilla bean flavor.

(Berry mousse, tender chocolate cake, blackberries, banana tuile) This was a standard fruit with chocolate dessert.  The mousse was creamy and the chocolate cake (pieces) was not dry but just okay.  I really liked the light tuile, which had a noticeable banana flavor.

Prices were high though the tasting menu seemed to be a much better value than going a la carte.

Service was decent.  Not super attentive and plates lingered a little bit though the food came out relatively fast.  The staff was pleasant.

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon features very contemporary and artfully designed food, but there is no sacrifice in flavor.  The restaurant focuses on classical flavor combinations (whether from France or other countries/regions), which should please many.  There are a lot of overpriced fine dining spots in Vegas.  L'Atelier is expensive as well, but at least the food is delicious and very memorable.

MGM Grand offers free self-parking (via a structure).

All you need to know about Cheddar's is that it serves good comfort food and has a well stocked, ample bar area.  

We came here on a Friday night around five. Cheddar's was in the middle of it's opening week growing pains. We were told there was a ten to fifteen minute wait, and nearly fifty-five minutes later, we were seated. LOL

As noted above, the food makes up for the confusion at the hostess station. The servers were on top of their game, and many were backing each other up, busing each other's tables. Nice!

The atmosphere was busy as you could imagine.  But, Jeff the Manager was walking around, keeping a watchful eye on things. He made a point of visiting each table and greeting guests by saying: "welcome to your new favorite neighbor restaurant,". It worked on us. Double, nice!!

The menu is mixture of burgers and steaks, with the prices being extraordinarily reasonable. The half pound burgers on the menu were only$6.29-6.79, with the chicken and steaks around $11-14. 

We started with two ice teas, one regular, the other a Long Island.  Surprisingly they were less than $2.00 apart and came out almost immediately. Did I mention our server Lori was good?  She treated us as if we were her only table!

After the teas arrive, we decided to try the Spinach Dip (see photo) for $5.99. It was very tasty, served with light tortilla chips and warm salsa. 

For our entree, we ordered a half rack of BBQ ribs ($10.79)and the Rib-Eye Philly Steak Sandwich ($8.49).  The ribs had a nice smokey taste. While the only downside was the sandwich, which seemed to have more mushrooms than steak.  

As mentioned above prices are very reasonable, and yes we'll be back after the newness and crowds settled down. Expect to pay around $25 each, including one drink each, one appetizer, taxes and gratuities. 

So Three and a half Stars "A-Okay". But this might change, since Cheddar's has the potential to become a goto neighbor restaurant.

3.68991234 stars.  I have some serious personal issues with spending as much as I did on Chinese food for 2.  I just imagine my Taiwanese mother looking at this menu and freaking over things like $18 stir fried noodles (with no meat nonetheless) and $28 for essentially 8 dumplings (albeit very good ones) .  But alas...happy wife, happy life!  She really enjoyed the dinner and preferred this over Tao.  I disagree.  

Don't get me wrong.  There were a couple of excellent dishes but it's simply the principle of paying this much for it that endlessly irks me.  So let's start with those:

OUTSTANDING DISHES:

Crispy Duck Salad:  My Hakkasan host recommended this dish to me a week before.  The server said it was her favorite thing on the menu.  Who am I to argue?  It was the best thing we had.  The duck was cooked perfectly and combining it with greens, pomegranate, pomelo and pine nuts made for a super tasty dish.  I am pretty sure I will order this every time I dine here.  It won't be many more unless I am getting comped but this is a MUST HAVE.  

Stir-fried Black Pepper Beef Ribeye with Merlot:  Love Me Tender.  Tender is the night.  Tender Love.  Time, Love and Tenderness.  Tenderoni.  I would've included "Try a Little Tenderness" but there was nothing little about this.  It was A LOT of tenderness.  Every freakin morsel was juicy and delectable.  I also liked that they included big pieces of garlic mixed in.  To fully enjoy this dish, you should order a side of jasmine rice for $2.  

DECENT:

Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter:  I won't go into the names of them all but there was shrimp, fish, scallop and duck.  The fish was ground up and then secured in a black squid ink wrap.  The scallop had a little ikura on top which was a nice touch.  I chose to eat the majority of these dumplings straight without sauce to get the full taste of it.  They offered 3 sauces with them but vinegar would have been nice as Yelper Cynthia C. mentioned in her review.

The cocktails were also decent but I forget the names of them.

DON'T EVEN BOTHER:

To sum it up, go for the stuff you can't get in a regular above average Chinese restaurant. 

Four Style Vegetable in sweet Szechuan sauce:  I didn't plan on ordering this but the server recommended it.  We had also been eating a little more unhealthy than usual that week so both of us thought a few veggies would help.  This was a joke.  The sweet and spice didn't work and the medley of asparagus, shimeji mushroom, yam bean (had the consistency of apple) and tofu was weird for me.  

Hakka noodle with mushrooms and Chinese chive: I was recommended this dish before coming and I got it even though I was still skeptical.  This would've been good if it were $5 but not $18.  

The food wasn't the only thing going on here.  I liked how the tables were sectioned off to handle small and larger parties.  The atmosphere was pretty chill at the time we were there (7pm Saturday) but I imagine it might get a little more rockin later in the evening.  The service was surprisingly excellent and our main server was incredibly nice.  They also offered some tasting courses that looked pretty interesting but you had to have a minimum of 4 to do it.  

I don't regret coming here but there are a lot of better options at this price point in the MGM like Craftsteak.

A fellow yelper suggested this place for lunch and I had been wanting to try it so she made reservations for us. At first when I walked in I noticed they were packed so was glad a reservation was made. I was seated at a half booth half chair type of table. I never mind these but in this instance I felt cramped. It kinda seemed like a space that was left over and they decided to cram 2 more seats into a corner. If the table were larger it would have made a better difference. I just know next time to request a different table since this one seemed like the only one like it.

The lunch menu was short and simple but had something for everyone. I decided to order the "Grilled Barely Buzzed Cheddar Cheese" that was accompanied by a cup of "Crushed Pea Soup w/Bacon Lardons" priced at $13. I was so pleased with it! The sandwich had such great flavor and I kept wanting more. The pea soup was simply delicious. I can't say enough about how much I liked this and I will for sure be back to order it again! The server was nice and kept checking on our drinks and how we were doing.

They have daily specials and I noticed they offer a kids menu. Some places offer you a mint or root beer candy when leaving but Honey Salt had salt water taffy! There is a fun guestbook before the hostess stand you can sign. If you feel like eating at the bar you can sit there and order from the menu as well but if there are any happy hour specials I didn't see any posted but there is a TV.  There is tables and chairs outside if you are wanting to enjoy the day should the weather be pleasant.

***MIX provides a great view of The Strip and the service is very nice, but the food is below average when compared to fine dining spots outside of Las Vegas***

MIX is the second Alain Ducasse restaurant I've tried.  The other one was in Tokyo and it was decent but not special.  Occasionally, the food at MIX felt pretty good, but often the food felt a little below average.  The food tastes slightly better than nearby Aureole (and the service is better too), but MIX just does not feel like a great fine dining spot.

The Alain Ducasse name is definitely a draw for MIX, but the atmosphere is too.  MIX sits on the 64th floor of the Mandalay Bay and you get a good view of The Strip (best at night) from most tables; there are some obstructed views.  The dining room is nice--mostly an all white room with white tablecloth; there are splashes of red here and there.  The lounge area is different; it utilizes darker and more typical lounge colors.

MIX offers several menu options.  There is an a la carte menu, which features starters and entrees including several Prime steaks.  There is also a seasonal MIX tasting menu as well as a tasting menu comprised of Alain Ducasse signature dishes.  I decided to opt for the Alain Ducasse tasting menu.

(Sweet corn soup amuse) The sweet corn flavor was good and it was creamy, but it was way too hot--almost like they zapped it in the microwave.

(Assorted bread with butter and peanut butter) The breadbasket was a decent variety of options, but it was just okay.  The addition of peanut butter was interesting, but the actual peanut butter itself was not that great.

(Potato gnocchi, asparagus, mushrooms, aged cheese) The gnocchi was okay; it was a little doughy and I prefer gnocchi with a seared outside.  The asparagus was good.  The mushrooms were just okay, but I really liked the aged cheese, which was sharp and hard but still surprisingly creamy and not dry (there should have been more of it on the plate).

(Seared foie gras, date puree, lemon confit) I added this as an a la carte item to the tasting menu and the date puree was a good sweet compliment to the more salty foie gras.  The foie gras was not that good though.  It was a little stringy and it was not that smooth or creamy.

(Roasted Maine lobster au curry, coconut basmati rice) The lobster was tender, but it just lacked the softness and moistness you get at really great fine dining restaurants. The coconut basmati rice was nice and creamy and the curry sauce was fragrant, but the flavors did not really develop.  It just became a decent curry dish and nothing else.  And because it was such a big portion, it became kind of a task to eat (instead of a really great dish where you can't put your fork down).

(Filet mignon rossini, foie gras, black truffle) This was the main course and it was quite rich and heavy.  The filet was decent.  It was cooked okay and was juicy and tender enough, but I did not think the quality of the meat was great.  The foie gras was similar to the a la carte foie gras where it just did not have that velvety smoothness you get with great foie gras (the texture kind of reminded me of when you don't do creme brulee right and it becomes like scrambled egg).

The black truffle was not that great either.  It was probably Australian truffle and not the peak season for it.  This truffle part might be better in the winter.

(Mango puree) The first dessert was a palate cleanser and it was not that great.  It was mango puree and a soda foam.  It was just tart and fizzy and not that refreshing.

(Baba a 'larmagnac, brioche, blueberry compote, cream) This was a kind of make-your-own dessert because they serve it in parts.  The sponge cake-like brioche sits atop a good blueberry compote and there is very strong brandy on the side for pouring and a very good cream for applying, dipping and such.  As individual parts, this dessert was decent, but I did not really love it as a whole.

(Madeleines with chocolate dipping sauce).  I liked that the madeleines were freshly baked, but they were too big.  I wish they had more of a defined edge/crust.  The chocolate dipping sauce did not have a great flavor and was too thick.

Despite a lot of the food being mediocre, the service was very good.  The staff was pleasant and attentive and the food came out at a good pace.

Prices were high, but you do get a very generous amount of food with the tasting menu.  And because a lot of the food is rich and heavy, you definitely will not leave hungry.

I thought the service at MIX was very good, but the food was about the same quality as Mandalay Bay's other lackluster fine dining spot Aureole.  There is a lot mediocre fine dining in Las Vegas and, unfortunately, Alain Ducasse's MIX falls in that bunch.  If you are looking for better and more contemporary French dining, you should check out L'atelier de Joel Robuchon in the MGM Grand instead.

The Mandalay Bay offers both complimentary valet and self parking.

WARNING: this is going to be a very long review....but it's also gonna be hella useful (and you might as well throw in a "cool" and "funny" too....okay, maybe not funny.)

Ever since some of my cousins moved to Vegas, we very rarely go to the strip.  I honestly couldn't tell you the last time I stepped foot on the strip.  Do I care?  Heck no!  I hate crowds, I don't party, and I'm not a big gambler.  Those are all the reasons why you'd go to the strip anyway.  

What I love about having family in Vegas is they can tell you all the local hot spots.  The Red Rock is definitely one of them.  We came here last year when it first opened and it was wonderful.  I love the round set up of the casino floor/bars/club.  This past weekend, we booked a few rooms here to have an early Christmas at my cousin's house.  I wish I was here for more than one night.  Are you ready?  Here's what they have:
- "Cherry" nightclub (multi-level), 7 bars, 1 lounge
- Food Court including: Fatburger, 2 Starbucks, Rubios, Panda Express, Ben & Jerry
- Restaurants including something Japanese, Mexican, Italian, Grand Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=E4UUqPlwClhSZ_JaRHvXPQ&q=grand+cafe), T-Bone Chophouse (which my cousin said was excellent), Feast Buffet, and............an Oyster Bar.  The Oyster Bar is beautiful and unique.
- Spa with prices higher than Burke Williams
- "Adventure Spa" services including: horseback riding, ranger tours, guided hikes, rock climbing, bike tours and river rafting
- Regal Cinemas...........yes, a movie theatre
- 24 hour bowling alley.............are you kidding me?  Freakin' awesome!
- Arcade for the kids

The rooms.........ultra modern.  I love the chocolate brown/green combination.  (Other rooms had white/brown combinations).  It also had:
- $12.99 internet/day
- Huge flat screen in the room...mini flat screen at the end of the tub
- Comfy couches, chairs, beds, benches at the end of each bed
- Bose alarm clock which was already playing for us as we entered
- Door Bell!  A freakin'doorbell!
- I sat in the tub.  It went as high as my shoulders and I had room at the end of my feet.
- The only thing I could say is it could use a larger shower.  
- Careful if you end up getting drunk in your room.  There is a fully censored mini-bar.  If you remove an item for more than 45 seconds, it will charge your credit card.  You'll end up taking home an intimacy kit for your fiance, like my cousin did.  

The hotel is just beautiful.  I love the giant red doors (at the main lobby) that you could see in to.  The hallways leading to the rooms are decorated and lit with a bit of a dizzying effect but are beautiful.  The doors to the rooms are in their own little hallway which is awesome so you can't hear the crazy drunkards plowing down the hallway.  There's free bottled water and apples at the check in counter.  They have heat lamps outside as you're waiting for the valet.  The valets.......super nice (some females too), as are the bell guys.  

A standard room (two queen beds) is plenty of room for 4 people (except maybe the closet).  For $160 on the Saturday before Christmas, I'd say that's a great deal.  Yes.....it is 20 minutes away from the strip, but I don't need the strip (or the crowds), and you shouldn't either when there are plenty of other great spots, like the Red Rock Casino~Resort~Spa.

Let me preface this by saying 5 stars do not give this foodie haven justice... this is probably the most delicious meal I've had... EVER!

It was a Wednesday night and we had 8:00 reservations.  We walked in right on time and were greeted immediately by none other than Eliot Wexler, himself. He couldn't have been friendlier, seating us immediately (just the way it should be when you have a reservation)! I noticed that the restaurant was packed and everyone around us seemed to be enjoying themselves - that was a good sign!  Plus the fact that I bumped into Jenn H, and I know she's got good taste, so when she recommended a few of her favorite menu items, I listened!

There were 3 of us dining, and I know we all enjoyed every moment, every sip, and every bite!  We each had a glass of wine to start - I went with the Kim Crawford Sauv Blanc.  Looking over the menu, it was difficult to decide on what to order - everything sounded unique and appealing.  After asking our waiter, Robert, for his opinion, I flagged Eliot down to ask what he thought between the Skate Wing and the Scallops.  He sold me on the Skate Wing... and I would order it again and again!  But before I get there, I have to mention that the table sampled the Gougere with mushroom duxelle and port wine syrup... (a special treat that was not on the menu).  We also tasted the Spinach Mezzaluna - a handmade ravioli stuffed with ricotta, mascarpone, and pecorino.  It was incredible!  I truly savored each bite! Oh, and how can I forget the fresh bread and olive oil brought to our table?  Truly, the freshest tasting olive oil... I'm not kidding!

On to the entrees... (pictured above).  My companions fancied their scallops and halibut immensely.  We traded a bite for a bite so we could each try all three entrees too, and they were all pretty amazing.  I will say, however, that Eliot (and Jenn H) steered me right in suggesting the Skate Wing.  I pretty much licked my plate clean!

We were all full after the entrees but decided that dessert would be a good ending to this phenomenal meal... so, what did we do?  On top of the cotton candy, we shared the donuts and the apple risotto.  We may as well do it right, right?  Wow!  We sure did do it right... the donut holes were served with 3 dipping sauces, and while I'm not a donut person, these were pretty amazing.  I hadn't treated myself to Cotton Candy since I was a little girl, so that was a fun addition of sugar shot right into my system... you have to have some, it's their signature dessert!  Finally, we went for one more indulgence... the apple risotto - oh, the apple risotto.  Fantastic!  Tiny pieces of apple sauteed with butter, sugar, honey, and more... topped with a salty butter flavored ice cream.  I know there were some additional ingredients that I'm missing here, but OMG... need I say more?

In some of the press I've read about this place, it's referred to as "fine dining in a casual atmosphere at an accessible price." I would agree with that - although I do think the 'accessible price' part is relative.  I would consider this more of a 'special occasion' type of place because of the $$ you'll spend here - $50 pp more or less.  It's worth dumping out your piggy bank if you have to though... it's a culinary experience you won't forget!

I'm already dreaming about my next visit!

While getting new gear for this year's Native American Recognition Days Banquet at the Scottsdale Mall some friends and I suddenly got hungry - we kept trying to tigure out what to eat when I broke out my cell and texted KGB (542542) and asked "I'm at the mall in Scottsdale, AZ. Where is a unique yet nice place to have dinner near here?" Moments later I had my answer "Posh. How do we describe Posh? with two words: Improvisational Cuisine". We were hooked!

I, the ever knowing yelper (yelpita to Thomas S.) have already heard of Posh and threw it on my list of places to try... became uber excited and lead the way. the parking is kind of odd just follow the signs from the road! And valet is free!! YAY!! We would've used it but the guy wasn' there!

We were met by our uber cute server (dang! Forgot his name sorry!) and chose to dine at the counter. They liked it but the chairs were a lil uncomfortable for me. I kept almost falling the whole meal.

I sampled a few wines and chose the rose` for a pre-meal drink. The "quiz" before the meal was different. I'm sure other reviews explain the Posh concept - in a nutshell: there was a short list of protiens, diners are asked to cross out anything they DO NOT want to dine on & then list ingredients they do NOT like or are allergic to and based on your answers - your meal is formulated improvisationally (is that even a word?) 

We chose the 5 course meal with wine (except for our DD) I said that I wasn't feeling the frogslegs and that I was down for anything including throwing an extra $15 for frois gras.

After we turned in our surveys, the chef came and spoke to us. I mentioned his use of White Tepary Beans. Tepary Beans are a staple in our culture and its surprising to hear about it being used in haute cuisine. Turns out he purchases his beans from TOCA (Tohono O'odham Community Action)'s farms which funds cultural activities for the Tohono O'odham Nation... tiiiight! 

On to the food...

There were three of us dining and that'd be 15 dishes!! soooo for this review, I'm only going to be describing my meal.

First was an amuse bouche of Lychee in a light oily sauce. Very good, nice and slightly sweet but a good start. Next came a salad made of cabbage & wild boar bacon (that was marinated over night in DUCK FAT!). The salad was good, small but overwhelmingly flavored with onions. I wrote on my survey that I DETESTED raw and strong onion flavor... so why serve me an onion filled dish?! It was good, which is why I didn't send it back but after a while I couldn't hang and ended up not finishing it; but I LOVED my friend's popcorn soup! the BEST way I can describe it is: imagine watering down grits with chicken broth & adding popcorn as a garnish. 

Course 2 was a lightly fried fluke with sauteed baby bok choi. Very good - extremely light. The wine paired with it was ah-mazing! The panko coating was a little too oily but the fluke was still great! I would have like to have seen it be oil poached. My friend had a stuffed quail that was better than Thanksgiving dinner!! I couldn't believe it was so good, I wanted to switch plates!

3rd course was the frois gras... the apex of a great meal. wonderfully seared and served cold... it was my first experience with frois gras... and it was sweet & delicious. It was paired with a sliced strawberry, spun sugar and a light sauce. ITs paired wine was the sweetest I ever had and complimented the dish perfectly.

4th was pan roasted lamb with some kind of greens. This was a little disappointing. As my friend and i recieved the same dish! WTF? Half the fun of this place should be that everyone at the table recieves something different! I asked my meat to be cooked to medium and this was medium-well (boo!) the sous chef even commented saying that the doneness of the lamb made him cry on the inside... I was like "uhhhhh - then why did you over cook it?!" The dish was good, the lamb tender and the greens nicely flavored, kind of heavy on the bacon/pork fat flavor.

Finally dessert. A chocolate pate` with more spun sugar and blackberry sauce finished my meal. Imagine taking a chocolate truffle and striping it of its semi-soft chocolate coating and forming its insides into a baby triangle and u'd have my pate`! 

As we were playing Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock (shout-out to all The Big Bang fans!) over the bill we were given flash frozen lemon custard lollipops (yummy!) and a small bag of cookies and brittle as parting gifts. They were great to nosh on during the giggle-filled ride home. 

Over all - the meal cost over a $100 a person & was VERY good, there might have been a few errors here & there but we still left buzzed & satisified! To my yelpers I say: Its a pretty penny and the add-ons do add-up but if you're looking for an amazing meal & have cash to spare give Posh a try. Just be sure to sit at the counter for the ultimate foodie experience!

My #1 Pittsburgh Restaurant Week choice was here.  So weeks in advance I booked a reservation for Wednesday.  This was the only day available that I could get a reservation at a normal dinner hour time.  I have tried in the past to make reservations here and because I am not into eating dinner at 11:45 pm, I have been unsuccessful.  But here we were, and I was so excited to finally try B&R especially during Restaurant week.

For starters we were seated pretty promptly upstairs in a long communal type of table.  Though the tables themselves were separated (as they had to be in order to get in and out) you could easily reach to your left or right and hold the stranger sitting next to you.  It also induced an awkward situation that the waiter had  to talk to the back of my husband's head all night unless he wanted to do a 180 to speak at him directly.  The place was also very dark, which led to an unfortunate incident I shall unveil at the proper time.  Not initimatly dark, but more like bedtime dark with flickering candles.  

So to the food, again extremely excited, and again looked online at their Restaurant week menu and was eager to try the menu, but alas without making it known on Restaurant week's website, the chef decided to change the menu daily.  I can't remember what was on the website but I recall being disappointed because I really wanted to try it.  Due to the new findings the hubs ordered off the regular menu.  He went with the WAGYU FLANK STEAK prepared medium.  I stuck to the altered restaurant week menu that had four courses.  1)corn fritters with an aoli 2) a pea soup with half a toasted cheese sammie 3) A seafood pasta dish 4) A flaky cream pastry with lemon, berries and a chocolate sauce.  I also ordered a couple overpriced Manhattans.

The food came at a good pace.  The corn fritters were rather good but were sitting in a vessel on top of the sauce making it difficult to dip them individually (had to ask for some extra on the side).  Next the pea soup and cheese sandwich.  This was definitely the best thing I had that evening.  The pea soup was delightful.  The gourmet grilled cheese great flavor and worked well together with the creamy pea soup.  I will say from here my dining experience started to plummet.  Next my seafood pasta came out along with the wagyu for my husband.  So remember how it was really dark in there?  The dish was prepared with a darker noodle and my first bit was full of shrimp and prawn shells.  They left all the shells on in this dark place hidden in this dark dish.  I spent the rest of the time picking shells out of my teeth and feeling the pain of regret.  At one point I pulled a huge prawn whisker from my mouth and said that's it I can't eat this anymore.  Funny thing, my very close neighbor, who I could hear easily, flagged down the waiter and began to tell him how much she disliked her meal and I quote "this tastes like a fishes ass."  Sadly I looked down and we were eating the same thing.  To add to the disappointment my husband's wagyu was tough.  I mean a $30.00 steak should melt in your mouth and it was so tough and chewy, just not a choice cut whatsoever.  

The desert was average to me, I am not a big sweets fan.  I split this with my husband who adamantly believes fruit doesn't belong in deserts unless it's apple pie. But nevertheless helped me eat it.  I would try B&R again, but it's not at the top of my list since there are many other good places that you don't have to book a month in advance to visit .

Yelpers, If you don't read only one review this year, don't read this one; the service was bland, but so was the food - this review can't be much better.

Quick tip, Phoenix in the summer months is not ALWAYS hot, carry a light jacket or sweater in your car, sometimes it's coooold, brrrr. Why some establishments think that 100+ degrees outside means it should be 65- degrees inside is byeond me. We visited on a Saturday before a movie and they seated us just under what seemed to be an ice vent, I was glad I had that sweater in the car.

My first impression of the Elephant Bar was "What type of food do they serve here?" Are they Mexi-merican, Italian, American, BBQ, sandwich, Asian Fusion? I'm not sure, and neither does their 30+ page menu. They've got the most confusing menu I've seen from just about any restaurant. I think I saw the same menu item on three separate pages with at least two separate items, why? Don't ask me.

I FINALLY, after about 25 minutes, ordered a barbecue glazed chicken sandwich with the macaroni and cheese side - which they touted all over the menu and table top flyers (the mac n cheese that is). By the way, turns out that their idea of barbecue glazed is a bland piece of chicken with barbecue sauce added after it's put on your sandwich. I could have sworn that barbecue glazed means it's cooked in a fire roaster / oven with the sauce.

I ended up sending the macoroni and cheese back after 4 or 5 bites, the noodles were way over cooked and the cheese was bland, I guess I could have added salt, but didn't really feel like paying for mediocre macoroni. I also requested them to add jalepenos to my chicken sandwich, and they sent out basically an entire jalepeno pepper on the side not peeled, not chopped, not diced, but sliced about 5 times - I ended up cutting it into smaller pieces myself with the butter knife they supplied me so I could actually add it to my sandwich.

The chicken wasn't pink, so I THINK it was cooked, but it was walking the line of cooked and not cooked. After about one fifth of the chicken sandwich I decided the flavor wasn't going to get much better and ended up sending that back also. 

The bill arrived and to my surprise the chicken sandwich was still on there. I asked the waitress "are you really going to charge me for that meal?". She went and found the manager to which I had to explain again all the reasons I didn't want to eat the food they provided and why I didn't want to order something else instead.

My wife's hambruger was good though. If you're here, hungry, and confused at what to order, get a burger; I think it's the best thing on the menu and difficult to get wrong. Who knows, maybe they can. :-/

So they changed the name and the look. This bar went thru "Bar Rescue". Something was going on wrong to get to that point. Do bar owners think its only the 'name' or the 'look' that make the bar fail? In this case, I guess so. 
I went in about 12:30am to try one of their new 'signature ' drinks. 
I walked in and took a seat at the bar. Text my friends where to meet and waited for the male bartender(who was in front of me) standing there talking to the guy that I sat next to. After about 5 minutes in the conversation, he went and asked some other group of people if their drinks were good. Then he started balancing a bottle on the back of his hand and doing dog tricks for them. At that point, I moved closer to the middle of the bar area and sat right in front of this, I'm assuming, bar back. All she did was put dirty empty glass after glass right at my spot. 30 glasses easy after all said and done while I sat still waiting for acknowledgment. I saw her look at me, but not even a half smile. I got a text asking if I'm still there from my friends. At that time , I moved to a third location at the bar. There was this girl bartender counting out her drawer or something. She had her back to me as I waited and watched the male do circus tricks and the bar back clean the bar. I wanted to go to the area of the bar where people were getting served drinks. No one was getting help. Everyone (20) people total were just talking and playing pool. So I text my friends at 12:50 and told them to meet me at another location. 
This place blows. 20 minutes and not even a.. 'be right with you'? I read their menu 5 times and had my drink ready to be ordered. I just sat there with a smile on my face waiting for SOMEONE to say, 'we're closed', we ran out of..', we don't serve your kind here', or something. 
I see why this place Failed before and they needed to be "rescued". There are WAYYY to many other bars in Vegas to waste time in this establishment. I give this place 2 months after the bar airs on the show before it goes back to the way it was. Back to the 2 star Yelpers reviews (That's being generous).

The food is outstanding but you have to wait for it. Is it worth it?

The Oyster Bar is inside the Palace Station Casino. The bar only has 18 seats. 

We got here at 8:30 pm on a Monday thinking we could avoid the infamous wait. No such luck, eleven people ahead of us in line. The line did not move for 40 minutes. When it finally moved, it went quick. At the one hour mark, we got seated. Yay. 
Well not so fast. 

After you're seated, you're given a sourdough roll and butter. Thank you, thank you thank you. We were starving and that helped a lot. A few minutes go by and they take our order. We waited so long I memorized what we wanted a half an hour ago lol. 

40 minutes later our soup comes out. 
An hour & 15 minutes from being seated we got the oysters. 
At the two hour mark from being seated we got our entrees. 
3 hour 15 minutes from waiting in line to finishing our meal. 
Was it worth it?

Here's the rundown:
New England Clam Chowder - Delicious. The bowl was full of clams and the soup was just outstanding. 

Oyster (a dozen) - was so so good. Cocktail sauce, horseradish and lemon accompanied the oysters. One of the best oysters I've ever had. The chef was having problems with one of the oysters (didn't want to stay in the shell) we were playfully teasing him about it and he was such a sport about it. We all had a good laugh and he put an extra oyster in for us. A bakers dozen, all delicious. 

Plaza Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab, chicken and andouille sausage. It's my first pan roast and it was delicious. The brandy and cream was a good combination. All the proteins were cooked perfectly. I specially liked the andouille sausage, a little hint of spiciness worked well with the broth.  I got a number 7 on the heat scale. It was not spicy for me at all. I could not finish my bowl, it was so rich and I had a lot of oysters. Lol. I will have a good lunch tomorrow for sure. 

I was also able to taste the following dishes. 
Combo Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab and lobster. My Mom's choice. Zero on the heat scale. It was as good as mine. Tasted the lobster and that was very good. Good amount of it too. Lol. 

Bouillabaisse - was so good. My brother's dish. 7 on the heat scale. It was spicy. Ouch. But it was really good. The broth was clean and very flavorful. It had shrimp, crab, lobster, mussels & clams. Great broth. I would get this next time. 

Service was excellent. The chef was friendly and entertaining. 

The wait. It didn't bother me at all. It was more entertaining than anything else. I got to talk to other people waiting in line and making fun of the situation we were in. I even got to meet a couple of local Yelpers and she told us about a Korean/Mexican fusion restaurant (Komex). The 3 hours went by really fast. 

It's an experience I won't soon forget and isn't that why we go to these places and go through all the hoops. Lol
Was it worth it?
I say Yes!!

We had great service
We had great food. 
We had great conversations
We had a memorable night. 

I'll definitely be back

I'm in Las Vegas with my father for one night (don't ask, we're not getting married or any sick Red state shit like that) and I refuse to eat where we are staying because as much as I love me some free room service, I cannot handle when my only choice on the menu is a STEAMED VEGETABLE PLATTER.  that is right.  it is a platter of steamed vegetables and a scoop of white rice.  just typing that sentence makes me want to get sick all over this computer.  now, you might be thinking, "Laura, aren't you on Weight Watchers?" and to that I say, "Fuck you."  

So anyway, I decide we're going to be adventurous and take a trip off the strip to a mostly vegetarian restaurant that I've been to before called Long Life Vege.  It's about a ten minute cab ride away, it's cheap and they have delicious fake meat.  Delicious.  While my dad may hate fake meat product, there is nothing the man loves more than cheap (the dude likes to be told how much you spent on his birthday present and if it's under $10 he will be all, "HIGH FIVE!" Once, my sister got him a pair of toe nail clippers from Mac Frugal's (RIP) for 99 cents and the man shed a tear.  HE CRIED, HE WAS SO PROUD) so we were in a cab faster than you can say, "faux chicken chow mein."  Well, our cabbie was a delightful chap from Somalia who was very affable and talkative and when he asked why we were going to a vegetarian restaurant, my dad said, "Because this one's a VEGAN!  Hahaha!' and they laughed and laughed.  Good one, you guys!  It IS hilarious when someone is vegan!  HAR DEE FUCKING HAR HAR.

we pull up to Long Life Vege and the motherfucker is closed.  GODDAMMIT.  we ask our cabbie for restaurant recommendations and he suggests Merkato since it is nearby and he is a regular.  We get to Merkato and as we are getting out of the cab, both my dad and I realize that we forgot our wallets.  Well, actually, my dad forgot his wallet and I "forgot" mine, you dig?  I ain't paying when money bags is around!  I wrangle dogs for a living and my father gets hundred dollar bills poured on his head just for waking up.  Plus, there will be no social security left for me when i'm old and I gotta save NOW!  and by save NOW!, i mean buy that new ipod phone because it's SWEET!  do you think it comes in pink??

We take a cab back to the hotel, my dad get his wallet, takes out another $100 from the ATM and we drive back to Merkato.  The cab is $45 at this point so my dad gives the guy what he thinks is $70 because he has put up with our insanity for the evening.  You're saying to yourself, "Who gives a fuck, Laura?" And to that I say, "Wait for it. You will get a mild satisfaction at the end but it's probably still not worth reading the whole long ass review."

We walk into Merkato and are the only non-Ethiopian people in the place and it's crazy crowded.  Both VERY good signs for potential deliciousness.  I order the veggie combo (which was a very typical veggie combo: yellow lentils, red lentils, mustard greens, enjera salad, etc) and it was MAGNIFICENT.  One of the best i've had and I've had A LOT.  my dad got the dead lambert and said the flavor was fantastic but there was too much fat and gristle.  now, contrary to popular belief, i haven't always been vegan.  i used to eat meat and let me tell you, i liked the grossest meat.  tendons and gristle and marrow...i mean, i would CLEAN a chicken bone and then use a splinter to pick my teef.  i was a hardcore red neck of an obese 9 year-old until i figured out i was eating bambi.  ANYWAY, if you are currently like i was when i was 9 years-old, then get the lamb and when you're done, have your cholesterol checked because i'm pretty sure you're gonna drop dead at any moment.  

So, we finish our fantastic meal about 15 hours after we first walked in (that's how they roll in Ethiopia.  Slowly.  But friendly.  Like this review.) and as he's paying, my dad realizes that instead of the $30 tip he thought he left our lovable cabbie, he gave him $115 tip.  MY DAD'S BAD!  we also realized that we had no way back to the hotel. luckily when i asked our waitress to call us a cab, she was all, "hold on" and disappears.  two minutes later, a guy who was eating a few tables over has us in his cab, headed back to the hotel.  Major bonus.

In the end, we're dealing with:

Cab rides: $135.  
Dinner: $25 (for two HUGE plates plus two beers and tea)
Average Cost of Dinner for Two People in Las Vegas in Some Cheesy Rip Off Restaurant On The Strip: $200.  

So anyway, I think we still did good.  And there's a cab driver (Yasin!  Holla!) who is high rolling tonight.  Or, you know, sending money back to his family in his war torn country.  As my dad put it, his company is paying and screw those jerkwads, the better man (Yasin! Holla!) wins tonight!  I love my dad.  

I am finally done, you can rest your eyes.  Get up, stretch, do some squats, get the blood flowing...you've been here awhile.

Ok so I'm watching Top Chef Masters in Las Vegas, and all the masters are treated to a dinner at Lotus of Siam for a "lesson" in authentic Thai cooking.  It's very clear that all these chefs are blown away by every dish at the table, so before the show was even over I was bookmarking Lotus of Siam on yelp for a future trip.  It helped even more, when I booked a Vegas trip with a friend and the first thing out of his mouth was, "We must eat at Lotus of Siam."

My advice is to explore the menu in advance, there are so many wonderful sounding dishes, that you can be overwhelmed if you wait until you sit down.  So get a game plan in order because there are 167 dishes on the menu.  We heard the Northern Thai dishes are very special here and you don't get them in most Thai restaurants in the US.  First up was the Sai Oua - Northern Sausage.  This was a pork sausage with some kick to it.  I liked pairing it with some of the crunchy veggies on the plate for some contrast and it also mellowed out the spice a bit.  We were going to compare this with an order of the Issan Sausage, but our waiter told us not to bother, since it would be no contest. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#rJOafb9EviIxvHmuRImkTA

Nam Prik Ong was featured once on "The best thing I ever ate".  So you know I had to try it.  It's a very tasty Northern ground pork based red chili tomato sauce dip and not very spicy, but packed full of flavor.  It's served with all kinds of crunchy veggies to spread on as well as a few pork rinds.  I will most likely order this every time I go back.  Works well as an appetizer and unique to this restaurant. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#w0R40SdZ1M2T6vi_nL7ioQ

A yelper friend of mine, Anita L., bragged about the Nua Nam Tok.  Our waiter warned us that this was a cold dish as some people are surprised.  Well it wasn't actually served cold, but slightly warm at room temperature.  The beef is coated in rice powder which gives it an unusual texture.  The flavor of the sauce was very strong and similar to a Nam Sod, heavy on the lime flavor.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#QwdrDHXlRPQY1CXH6XvNQA

We felt obligated to get a few standard Thai dishes as a place of reference.  Tom Kah  Kai is a soup that most people are very familiar with.  Lotus of Siam's version was very spicy and if you slurp it up the wrong way, it will get your eyes watering.  I love spicy, so no problems with me.  What I liked about this version was that the lemongrass flavor wasn't lost in the coconut milk at all. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#YZAR3oSugi4fd6bammVMzg

My buddy loves Pad Thai (as most people do).  I'm not that fond of the dish, but I will say I'm glad that I got to try it here.  Perhaps I've had so many bad versions of it, that I'm jaded.  This was by far the best Pad Thai that I've ever had.  I would order it again in a second.  We had it with Chicken. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#9UnnMrrfaKk53Uuv-pPyuQ

Last up was a Green Curry with Beef.  I love green curry and I love it spicy.  I was asked on a scale of 1 to 10.  I went with a 8.  Lke most things in Vegas; it was fun at the time, but I paid dearly for it the next morning.  It was very spicy and whatever they spiced it up with was green, because other places I've seen all kinds of ground up red chili in there, not in this curry.  Glad I had plenty of rice to soak up this delicious sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#tQBHtC3JR05nKHCMFp-PaA  

Yes Lotus of Siam, should be on your must do list of Vegas.  I would make reservations, as it gets crowded.  We were seated promptly at our 8:30 reservation time on a Friday night.  Others who didn't think ahead had to wait.  The restaurant is much larger than it looks from the outside and has most likely expanded a few times, taking over their former next door neighbors.  Taking a large group here would be great as you can sample many dishes, as a true food tourist should.

***This Marriott brand hotel (like other Marriott Brand hotels) is located near but still off The Strip; it is actually a pretty nice hotel and you can get good room rates if you do not mind driving, taking a taxi, using the monorail, or enduring one very long walk to The Strip***

Renaissance is part of the Marriott brand and it is very similar to most Marriott hotels.  They both typically feature on-site restaurants and concierge levels and concierge lounges for Gold and Platinum Marriott Rewards members (though Renaissance calls them club levels and club lounges).  The one difference with Renaissance is that they typically feature a sleeker and more modern decor (both in the lobby and rooms).

My room was nice.  It was comfortable and spacious.  The bed was comfortable with good and clean linen.  The cabinets / drawers all felt new and the room had a mini fridge and safe.  The room also had a big flat screen TV.  The decor was nothing too unique, but it did feel more modern than most Marriotts out there.  This one had a nice touch too with a personalized welcome screen on the TV when you enter.

The bathroom was nice.  There was a bath tub and a separate shower.  Like the room, the bathroom was very spacious.  The shower worked well (so did the room temperature unit).

The fitness center was good.  There were many fitness machines available including treadmills, bikes, weights, and CrossRamps.  There was also two restrooms located within the fitness center, which was convenient.  The restrooms could be locked and even came with a private shower.

I did not try the restaurant, but there is a quick service cafe on-site called E-Go Cafe.  The cafe sells snacks, an assortment of coffee drinks and cold drinks.  It also serves breakfast sandwiches, pastries and yogurt parfaits for breakfast and salads and sandwiches for lunch.  I had the yogurt parfait and it was pretty good--the yogurt was tangy while the granola crumble was sweet, buttery and crunchy.  There were also good candied pistachios and berries (though the berries were a tad tart).

E-Go Cafe is fairly small so lines can really build here.  This Renaissance provides a $10 per day credit for Gold and Platinum Marriott Rewards members for Saturday and Sunday morning since the Club Lounge is not open on weekends.  This is a nice touch and I have been to a few Marriotts that did not do this since it is not a required elite benefit.

The Club Lounge was nice.  From Sunday night thru Thursday night, they offer a selection of cold and hot appetizers.  On my visit, cold appetizers consisted of a cheese and antipasto plate though the cheese plates at Marriott and Renaissance lounges are never that good (the cheese was simple cubed cheddar and pepper jack cheese; the antipasto was cubed salami and ham).

There were also cold vegetables like celery, carrots and asparagus (with ranch and a vinaigrette for dipping).  Salty mixed nuts were available as well.  The hot item was chicken breasts in a cream sauce with white rice.  It was a substantial offering for a concierge lounge given most of the time it is just small bites.  The food did not look that good, but the chicken was surprisingly tender and not too dry (and the sauce was not that bad).

Another plus was that cold Coca-Cola drinks were offered.  I think all or almost all of the Marriott lounges I have been to have offered Pepsi drinks, but this one offered Coca-Cola in the thick aluminum bottles, which kept the soft drink very cold and crisp.

Their breakfast was a substantial offering too.  There was decent scrambled eggs (for a buffet)--not too dry and not runny.  There was also bacon and the bacon was very nicely cooked--crisp but not burnt and meaty and not that fatty.  Cold options like fruit and cereal were available.  Orange juice and milk were offered complimentary.

The lounge was a decent size too.  There were several tables available and there was a nice living room area with a large flat screen TV.

Service was good throughout my stay--consistent with the Marriott brand.

Room rates are not bad.  You can find good weekend deals here, but this hotel is very far from The Strip so the location is not really ideal; ideal only if you are spending time at the convention center, which is within walking distance.  There is a monorail stop nearby.

I liked this Renaissance.  Though the exterior did not look that great, I thought the lobby (comfortable with lots of power outlets) and the rooms were both nice (I liked this Renaissance more than the one I stayed at near the St. Louis airport).  Overall, it is a good hotel choice if you are spending a lot of time at the convention center or do not mind being quite far from The Strip.  It is also a nice spot for Gold and Platinum Marriott members given the good Club Lounge and the complimentary weekend breakfast.

Like the Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, this Renaissance offers both free valet and self parking.

I have recently discovered that very yummy things come from tiny little buildings. The menu here at Sammy's L.A. Pastrami & Burgers offers a variety of options for such a small place. The outside is nothing pretty to look at but sometimes it is those places that surprise you. There is a small seating area near a walk up window if you want to enjoy your food outside. There are easy to read menus along the building of the drive-thru it is just hard deciding what to try from it. 

My man had to try the "L.A Style Pastrami". It was a BIG hit! It has pastrami, mustard and pickles on a sub style roll. They have 3 different sizes with the extra large being $12.99! I wouldn't recommend the extra large unless you plan to share with somebody or plan to have more then 1 meal out of it because he got the large at $9.69 and it was almost too much pastrami. Not that he complained or didn't finish every bite because he did! The guy at the window said the bad for you fried foods were all hand breaded and that they use fresh ingredients and I was craving something I could dip in ranch so I chose the "Variety Platter" at $7.99. I picked battered zucchini slices, fried mushrooms and fried mozzarella sticks. The zucchini was the best part! It really wasn't greasy and had great flavor. The fried mushrooms were good but I can't say I would order them again. The mozzarella sticks were perfect. The batter tasted good and the cheese wasn't rubbery like most places it was really stringy and super good. The ranch was thick and creamy. I really like this place and will be back regularly. 

There is plenty of options for burgers or chicken sandwiches. They also have a philly cheese steak that looks like it would be good. The menu says their shakes are made with "thrifty" ice cream. The "Garlic Romano Fries" are on my radar for next time.

Plan to wait a while while your food is being made. It is being made fresh so it does take some time.

I guess my expectations were a bit too high for such an expensive place.

We made reservations for our anniversary dinner. In general, my dining experiences surround casual dining establishments. Low key, relaxed atmosphere, friendly wait staff, the type of place that will stop for a minute or two to have a conversation instead of go through a check list. Serve bread, bring water, fork on the left, soup spoon above the plate, ask about appetizers, talk about specials, etc., etc. I got the feeling that this was a stuffed shirt type of place, and while I *was* wearing a tie that evening, I wasn't expecting a by the book, average service with our $50 meals.

Where to begin? I hate that this is basically going to be a check list of everything that went wrong, but here goes.

- requested olive oil for the table bread which took about 15 minutes to arrive. 
- the drinks we ordered took 20+ minutes to arrive.
- wifes steak wasn't cooked to order. The waiter asked if she wanted it butterflied to be sure it was cooked to order, she said yes. It was not butterflied and started bleeding when she cut into it.
- we ordered a side of brussel sprouts that didn't actually come out with the meal.
- I had to remind the waiter that we didn't get our brussel sprouts
- the sauted brussel sprouts and bacon tasted mediocre and came with crunchy bacon bits, not bacon - I've had way better and for a lot less $$.
- the steamed vegetables (a carrot and snow peas by the way) went through more of a blanching than a steaming and were basically raw veggies.
- option of baked potato, mashed potato, and potato au gratin as your included side, how much potato do you think I eat?
- run of the mill steak house music playing over the speaker system.

My expectations were that I would get an amazingly delicious meal, nice friendly evening, perhaps some live ambiance music, a waiter who remembered what we ordered without a reminder, and service that happened a bit faster. I understand that kitchen problems aren't the fault of the wait staff, but I assumed at the cost of these meals, the waiter staff would notice a missing side dish, and a steak that wasn't butterflied.

If you care to know, yes we did mention the foul ups with the food order, they did comp the brussel sprouts, they did cook the steak a bit longer, the manager came to the table to apologize, and we did receive complimentary desserts. Although the desserts were complimentary because of our anniversary and not the foul ups; not that I was fishing for free stuff. I certainly appreciate the apologies and effort put in to correcting what went wrong. I was generally expecting a *nice* place like this to be on their game the entire night and was soured by the overall experience.

Donovan's sure knows how to make a special evening, well, not so special.

Craving pizza, we stopped here for dinner. Inside they have a decent amount of seating, though some of the seating is a bit too close to the next table. We seated ourselves and our server came over a few minutes later to greet us. There were no other customers when we arrived (some came in later) and it seemed odd that no employees were noticeable until the server came from the back. I ordered the "Mozzarella Sticks" priced at $6 to start. About 15 minutes later our server came back to take our main order (no mozzarella sticks in sight) and hubby and I shared a medium "Chicago Style Pizza" with 1/2 pepperoni & sausage and 1/2 garlic & ricotta. The pizza was priced at $19.65 and even for a medium pizza, it was hearty. I asked the server about the mozzarella sticks and she said they should be right out. Another 10 minutes later they arrived! I don't know what went into preparing them, but they took damn long enough! I thought the sticks were very good. Not worth what we waited, but good. The server did warn us that the pizza would take about 30 minutes. Lie! An hour later the pizza came out. I felt like family at this point I mean we had been there so long! The crust on the pizza was perfect and the sauce tasted great, Unfortunately, the garlic and ricotta were visible yet the flavor of them barely stood out at all. I might give the deep dish another try with different toppings in the future since the crust and sauce were good, but with some of the toppings I chose this time lacking in flavor (you should be able to taste fresh garlic!) and how long it took for service, I can't see coming back anytime right away. 

They charge $3 for delivery according to their menu. Mon - Fri they have a pizza and salad buffet for $7.95 (dine-in only) from 10am - 2pm.

I have a new favorite breakfast spot! I noticed several benches outside and I can only assume that is because sometimes the line is out the door from people waiting to get into this place. Lucky us though we got in before a rush came through and nabbed a spot without wait. The inside is clean and the employees are very friendly. Seating seems limited for the amount of people wanting inside. I saw the occupancy sign said it could seat just 50! If BabyStacks keeps putting out such a good breakfast they might have to move to a bigger location. 

The coffee here is awesome! It is full of good flavor. This is one of those cups of coffee I just really enjoyed sipping on and could have stayed all day just for that! I figured my first visit wouldn't be complete if I didn't order pancakes. With all of the options BabyStacks offers for pancakes how does anybody ever decide?! I chose the "Banana Cream Pie" pancakes. OMG! These pancakes are the b-e-s-t I have ever had!! The pancakes are so darn thick and fluffy and have such good flavor. There was banana in the pancake batter as well sliced fresh all over the pancakes. It also had banana cream sauce, almonds and pie crust on it.  I only ordered a *short* stack and couldn't finish my meal. The short stack cost just $5.75. What a great price! Others in my party grubbed on "Carot Cakes" and "PB & Bananas W/Chocolate Chips" and of course I had to try a bite of both of those. I would order everything at our table over and over again it was just all so good. I will be back for sure!

Our server was excellent. I asked him what his favorite thing on the menu was and he suggested "Portuguese Sausage And Eggs". He said they have a "Garlic Rice" that pairs very well with this dish. He had me at garlic rice! I need to try this rice for sure at some point. 

They have a great kids menu at affordable prices.

We had an exchange student from France at our high school whose favorite top compliment was "formidable!"  You'd have to hear her say this with her delightful accent.  For my meal at Guy Savoy, I often thought of Christelle and silently said "formidable!"

I got the Signature Menu, a multi-course meal of wonderfully prepared and plated food.  Dinner started with what could be called 3 amuse-bouches although only one was called the amuse-bouche.  Shortly after getting comfortable, a server brings you a metal skewer of foie-gras with black truffle.  In a bit, you're brought another morsel, a 2 piece waffle with parmesan cheese.  Then the "official" amuse-bouche arrives.  It's a small cup of zucchini soup with some pine nuts.  You brush the nuts into the soup.  My server, Kriste, suggested I check under the cup when I was done for something else.  Sure enough, there was a small piece of pork belly to enjoy when the main part was finished.

The first course was the chestnut course.  There was chestnut pure, small whole chestnuts, sliced mushrooms, and chestnut soup.  It was marvelous.  I haven't eaten chestnuts since I was a teen.  

The second course was called the Colors of Caviar--layers of caviar in different forms topped by a layer of caviar sabayon.  A server suggested inserting the flat spoon all the way down and getting some of each layer.  Very nice!

During this time, I had one piece of lemon bread from the bread cart.  You're automatically brought two pieces of bread after being seated and I didn't want to fill up on bread.  I have to go again and try the sea weed bread.  They had a very nice selection.

Course three was whole stuffed red mullet.  The head of the fish was discretely covered by a leaf of cooked spinach. The fish was stuffed with very thinly sliced mushrooms and spinach.  It was extraordinary!

Course four was Foie-gras with a bitter infusion.  They bring a glass tea pot with a candle to your table.  In the tea pot, green tea is placed and consome is added.  The foie-gras is prepared in the kitchen as the infusion heats.  Then the foie-gras arrives and the infusion is poured around the dish.  You're all given a small glass of the infusion to enjoy after each bite.  The foie-gras was perfectly seared on top.

Course five was artichoke and black truffle soup served with a toasted mushroom brioche with black truffle butter.  The soup is completely water based--no cream or stock.  It's amazing how much flavor comes from the ingredients with just water!

Course six was beef tenderloin (with bone marrow on top)--done according to your wishes when you order your meal--with a carrot paleron cannelloni.  The beef was so tender and flavorful. The carrot cannelloni was quite tasty and a very clever concept.

Course seven was the cheese course.  There were many options on the cheese cart.  The cheeses were described very thoroughly.  I chose roquefort, a milder cheese from the Savoie region of France, and a more liquid, more full flavored cheese from the Loire Valley.  The plating is done in a way that the cheeses go from mildest to strongest or the other way around depending on where you start.  There's more bread here.  I got two slices, one of a fruit bread and one a nut bread.

Then came a palate cleanser of chopped blackberry with fresh apple pieces and a small spoon of cinnamon crumb cubes.

Course eight was the first dessert--Coconut six ways.  I can't remember all the ways but there was coconut soup, coconut granit, coconut soup, coconut tapioca, fresh coconut slices and one I don't remember.  Delightful!

Course nine was the second dessert--chocolate fondant, crunchy praline, and a chicory cream.  Rich chocolate, a tasty cream to dip your fondant in, and the crunchy praline was superb!  A great ending--almost.

Then the mignardises trolley was wheeled to the table.  There was such a large selection.  I made five choices, a stuffed grape, some jasmine marshmallow, a wonderful petit cheesecake, caramelized banana, and one other I don't remember.  I was on a food high!

Service was extraordinary!  Kriste, the main server, was always attentive and there were two others.  Between the three, there was always an eye on my table to make sure I had anything I needed.  Near the end of the meal, Chef Chartron stopped by my table and introduced himself and asked about how the meal was.  This is always a nice touch.  

Prior to dinner, Kriste gave me a tour of the restaurant including the Krug Room, one of only five in the world.  After dinner, she took me to the kitchen to speak with Chef Chartron and see the kitchen area.  Chef Chartron was working on a new menu and his chef's table had his papers on which he was writing his plans.  I found out there was a sub-kitchen two floors below and this is the finishing kitchen.  

In summary, this was the most enjoyable meal I've had in Las Vegas.  Everything was exceptional--food, service, and surroundings!  This really deserves all five stars!

They (countless Internet people with sexy six-pack abs I follow on Twitter & Instagram) say that the secret to having a six-pack abs is not the workout sessions at the gym, but mostly (let's say 75%) because of what you eat.  With that said, all the gym rats and fitness minded folks with goals of obtaining or maintaining their six-packs, you do not have to avoid the SLS Buffet... on your cheat day.

The rest of the people that are normal (even extra normal) and more well rounded (pun intended) in the waistline department, come as often as you like (Note: You can earn 2 complimentary SLS Buffet passes with 500 slot points).  Having a few meals here will definitely help you maintain your corpulent rotundness, making you just that much more beloved by Jenny Craig. 

So I know I been watching what I eat recently. So if it wasn't for the SLS grand opening and the "obsession?" to check out new places and leave a trail blazer report for the rest of the Yelp Pals, my better judgement would have grounded me and kept me on my granola with dried blueberries diet.  But I suck at being rational when it comes to food and women. So here I am at home now, writing my review.

First of all, SLS being the latest casino property to open to the general public in LV (as of Aug 23, 2014), with nice modern facelift to update what used to be the Sahara, of course has a modern looking buffet.  It is not huge or fancy like Caesar's Bacchanal Buffet, but it is still way better than the one at the Palms.  On opening weekend, the dinner is $40.  So it is not cheap. But still in the same ballpark as the rest of the also ran buffet contenders.

The dining area and also the serving stations look pretty good.  The decorations seems (okay, not gonna sugar coat it), is half complete for the serving stations.  The shelves above is only decorated on about 60% of the buffet (Asian dim sum section to just past the mid point (carving station). Not sure if it was a budget thing, or not getting in all the decorations elements (enameled cast iron cookware), but the bulk of the decoration is noticeably lopsided. Not a big thing, and will not affect the quality of the food served, but it is just one of those attention to details thing.  The seats and tables in the dining area is comfortable and spaced well, so you do not feel cramped or boxed in (Good job!).

The buffet has the usual snow crab legs, some fresh clams, cooked shrimp, prime rib carving station (prime rib was good), dessert station (it is a large island of baked goods, not too much variety though, with some special highlights I will discuss later), a large Asian & dim sum section.  But overall I was not really impressed.  No serious WOW factor. But it is not terrible either.  Pretty A-Okay,with definite room for easy & significant improvements.

Let me cover what I do like about this buffet.

* Layout of the savory stations is straight forward. No lines per say to wait, just go in for the prize, wherever you see what caught your gleaming eyes.
* Plenty of large plates on the bottom shelf for you to pick up and pile on your build your own feast.
* Small portions available for self service, which is refreshed with newer back ups. So you get fairly fresh dishes throughout your meal.
* The line was very short. Hardly any wait, but you do have to look for the buffet or wonder successfully to this part of the SLS property.

* Fresh fried doughnuts tossed in cinnamon sugar. [Highlight of the meal]

* Dried Blueberries [Not sure what you would eat this with, but I was happy to just snack on these plain]
* Sushi was fresh.
* Pastas are all good.
* Gelato was tasty & serving was generous (compared to all the buffets I tried further south of SLS).

Could be better:

* Crepe maker's skill is really at the novice of novice level.  I think he is dreading it, and it shows in the final odd shaped product. The batter is spread thin and overcooked in sections, while thick and under-cooked in others.
* Crepe station ingredients are not stored properly for service or needs to be reformulated. (Chocolate and Nutella are so thick you can't portion it let alone make designs with them. Mixing it with 10% oil or holding it at higher temperature (melting point) would make more sense.
* Dim Sum section has great variety but sometimes you just like a lot of shumai (just an example). So should I leave with 3 bamboo steaming baskets or just consolidate right there.
* Dim sum portions for some items seems too big (chicken feet, the steam buns), I know I opted out, since I don't want to waste food.
* Steamed Basmati rice was dried and crusty. Maybe smaller portions is better or have a cover for it.
* Dessert selections is fairly limited. It looks full, but the same desserts are scattered on almost all sides of the large dessert island.

For $40 (weekend dinner) I thought it was okay, and worth checking out for the sake of checking it out (even some SLS employees agreed).  $30 is a no brainer. $35 is a toss up. 3 stars!

When finding out I was moving back the the Vegas, in no way did I think of going to The Palms...for ANYTHING. Well, maybe a Ditch Friday...and GBDC...and the Pearl...and the diner rueben... OK, fine. I would've been at The Palms. But I didn't see a 5-star meal coming from here. Enter N9NE.  

Through the grapevine (yelp) I heard about this $65 AYCD 5-course prix fixe and since I had a date to impress, to N9NE we went! On a Monday at 6:45 the place was nearly empty. It's an odd looking spot. A giganto bar in the middle of the dining room and little to no decoration to be found. 

Any who, before I could really look around a friendly white coated waiter came over with some menus. I didn't even snag a look at it and went straight for the prix fixe. Off the waiter went and returned with a white wine. He went into a speech about it, but I stopped him and told him to pour first and ask questions later. He obliged, filled the glasses tall and went on his way. Class personified. The service was terrific throughout. 

Here's how the meal went...
Amuse Bouche: 
Potato and celery soup - Small cup came out and wasn't as heavy as I expect most potato soups to be. You could definitely detect the celery flavor. 

Starters: 
French onion soup and garbage salad (a salad with a bit of everything) - LOVVEE both of these in concept and N9NE did them well. Bits of bleu cheese, olives, salami, tomato and others all over salad is always a good time. The soup was on point. Gooey cheese and salty broth make me a happy camper.

Fish: *Note: I am buzzed at this point
Striped Sea Bass (Sauted, Escarole & Beans, Black Garlic, Pancetta, Extra Virgin Olive Oil)- This was solid. Crunchy top with light bites of fish underneath. Next time I would probably skip this step and leave more room for the meat.  

Entree: *Note- I am drunk now and the red wine has entered the picture
Prime Ribeye Steak with grilled asparagus and parmesan mashed potatoes  - This bad boy was cooked perfectly rare and had was served in a plate of its own juices. Smooth move. If that wasn't enough, it was also served with 3 side sauces (Creamy Horseradish, Au Poivre and Barnaise Sauce). Don't even bother with these. Although really salty (IMO), the crust was extremely flavorful and the piece was easy to cut. Not the best steak I've had this year, but doable. 

Dessert: 
- 3 mini pieces of a peanut butter cup, carrot cake (bomb!) and cheesecake. All fun, but you should prob be full by now. 

So, about those 5-stars. The food was FAR from perfect, but the experience was great. Anytime I leave a place full, tipsy and satisfied with a lady in hand (who was feeling the same), I'm more than just 'a fan'. Let's call it a generous 5 with a suggestion to have your next date night here. 

Tip: check out the worlds smallest TV's in the bathroom

I apologize in advance for the length of this review, but if you are ever planning on being within a 100 mile radius of this place, I would recommend that you read it. 

It was my grandfather's birthday, so we decided to go to old town Scottsdale to have a nice dinner. He felt like Italian food, so we decided to try this place out. At the door, a man was greeting guests. Later, I realized he was the owner. He seemed nice at first, assuring me that he was getting a table ready for my family. We were seated and the first noticeable thing about the restaurant was the noise level. The waiter was literally screaming at our faces to get our orders. And I though HE was rude???! Things were somehow about to get wayyyyy worse.

Even though we were 6 people and a baby, we only ordered 4 dishes. My grandparents always share, and the baby can't exactly eat a full plate of lasagna and garlic bread. We started our meal with Minestrone, a "vegetarian" soup. I found a piece of sausage in my soup, which I cannot eat. It's not a big deal, but at that point the soup was inedible. The owner was passing by, so my father got his attention. He told him about the sausage and explained that we could not eat it. Instead of apologizing, this dude started lecturing us. "Stuff happens! I've owned this restaurant for 38 years and you expect me to be perfect? NNOO!" All I wanted was a simple "S-O-R-R-Y." Do people not teach that word to their toddlers anymore? It certainly wasn't in this guy's vocabulary. So, after he left, I exclaimed "Excuse me!" to my family and we began talking about how rude his behavior was. This guy, who I assumed was a waiter, heard me and we made eye contact. He then walked away.

A few minutes later, the owner returned. He then decided to give us another condescending lecture. "Well I saw your ticket and you are a party of 7 who only ordered 4 meals! I'm just sayin'. The soup is not a big deal- it happens once in a blue moon! Tomorrow is a new day and the sun will come up! I'm not gonna kill myself tryin' to make you people happy! I want to live a long life! BLAH BLAH BLAHHHHHH" My grandmother asked him if he was going to bring me another soup. He then, in a very patronizing tone, asked me if I wanted another soup. I refused, since I was almost finished with my soup when I discovered the sausage anyways. He then went on to say "I have 6 kids! I know that you need more food. Tell me what to bring and I'll bring it for you. You only ordered 4 meals. DOES ANYBODY HERE WANT A SOUP!!?!? " I have to say, I feel bad for those kids. They probably get whipped on a daily basis. He left after we all refused, as the waiter I mentioned before smirked. We had had enough. We decided to leave while we still could. As we began to exit the table, the waiter saw us and realized what was happening. He came by and asked "Is everyone leaving here?" We said yes and continued to leave. "I don't like being insulted like that," my father told him. "Oh yeah?? Insulted? You only had 4 meals on your ticket! Now that's insulting! You can't even afford enough food to feed your family! This is MY restaurant! I'm done with you people! GO- GO! Keep moving! GET OUT OF HERE!! STOP THEIR MEALS!" he yelled. At this point, I was worried that he was going to get physical. I decided this spawn of Satan could only be the owner's son.

We continued walking out of the restaurant, our jaws hanging open.The owner was at the door greeting his friends and regular costumers (how does he even have any of those??)  He then started yelling at my father! "You can't even afford seven meals! I'd rather you people leave!" Now, my father was mad. "I'm a cardiologist! I can afford a meal! Do you expect the baby to eat a full meal???" The owner replied, yelling and following my family as we turned from the restaurant, with "A cardiologist? Oh, and I'm an astronaut! I'm going to the moon tomorrow!" This dude certainly seemed high enough to get to the moon. "Just don't end up in the ER!" my father said. 

I was shaking after this incident. This dude needs to be in a mental hospital. His son can be his cellmate. I have a weird feeling he's going to send the mafia after me after he sees this review, but I don't really care. I need to preach out to people DO NOT GO HERE! THE OWNER IS A CRAZY LUNATIC! RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN! I seriously hope this place burns down. It would make the world a much better place.

***Like a lot of upscale Mexican restaurants (as well as Vegas restaurants), Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill feels too expensive; the food is good though and the service is strong and friendly***

Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill is one of the few upscale Vegas restaurants open for lunch.  Their lunch features a lot of lunch style plates--sandwiches and salads, but they actually also have several starters from their dinner menu and a few entrees.

Flay's food is southwestern style so there are a lot of Mexican influences.  Most of the dishes veer on the sweet and spicy side (though the food at Mesa Grill, at least what I've had, never gets that spicy).

Mesa Grill is like a lot of upscale Mexican restaurants.  It is quite pricey even though what's on the menu is the kind of food you can get at less expensive restaurants.  At least Mesa Grill uses more expensive ingredients like duck, ahi tuna and scallops.

The breadbasket at Mesa Grill was an assortment of cold bread.  There was a blue corn muffin, which while not dry, was too crumbly and a little bland.  The fruit and nut bread was decent, but the bread was a little soft and the fruit did not pop like the fruit in Picasso's fruit and nut bread.  Picasso's bread was heartier too.

The jalapeno bread was too soft as well.  There were a few jalapeno bits in it, but I think more of them would have made the bread more memorable.

I started with the rough cut tuna nachos, which was chopped raw tuna mixed with a vinaigrette and capers.  The tuna came with a mango puree, avocado crema and habanero sauce.

The tuna was fresh, nicely moist and soft.  I really liked the sauces.  Both the mango puree and avocado crema were very clean, smooth and creamy.  The mango puree was sweet but not overpowering while the avocado crema was cool and refreshing.  The habanero was noticeable and gave little pops of spiciness (though I think I personally would have preferred more heat).

The dish was served with two kinds of chips.  The best was the blue corn--light, thin and crispy.  I was not a fan of the other chip--it was thick, sandy on the outside and too mealy.  I've had that style of chip before, but I don't know what it's called.

For my entree, I went with one of their starters--tiger shrimp with a roasted corn tamale and a sweet corn cream sauce.  I liked the shrimp--plump and moist.  I prefer shrimp with more color and seasoning, but this was still good.

The corn tamale was just okay.  It had a good corn flavor and moistness, but it was uneven.  Parts of the tamale were not smooth; the masa clumped together and was even a little dry.  The corn cream sauce was not too heavy and was creamy and sweet.  Even more so than the nachos, I think this dish could have used more heat.

For dessert, I went with their sticky toffee pudding, which was a big portion; it had a good flavor though it was a tad dry.  The sticky toffee pudding came with a salted cajeta, which had a great consistency--very fine, which made it feel more like a red wine reduction rather than a thick and sticky caramel.

Some salted caramel desserts can have a mix of sweet and salty (whether just right or too salty) while others can be just a less-sweet caramel.  It was the latter with this salted cajeta.  The biggest salty component came from the salt sprinkled on top of the cake.

There was also some vanilla ice cream and it was creamy (and not icy at all), but there was too little of it.  The cake combined with the salted cajeta was quite sweet and there needed to be a different flavor to balance it out.

Service was very good.  The food was upscale but still casual and approachable and this was very much in harmony with the service.  The service was definitely polite, professional and polished, but it was also quite friendly.  The food also came out at a quick pace.

Prices are high; Mesa Grill is probably overpriced, but that is often the case at Vegas restaurants.  Still, almost the entire lunch menu was below $20.

In terms of decor/atmosphere, the contemporary room (which sits right next to the casino) had warm (but not garish) Southwestern accents.  The room was nice enough, but it was not that memorable.

Mesa Grill is a solid and satisfying Vegas restaurant.  If you don't like upscale Mexican spots because the food does not seem worth the extra cost, I'm not sure if Mesa Grill is going to change your mind (though I do think Mesa Grill is significantly better than some upscale Mexican spots out there like Border Grill and the high quality ingredients like ahi tuna and veal chop from a previous trip are represented well).

There are definitely some well known Vegas restaurants putting out subpar food, but I have not felt that way on my two trips to Mesa Grill.  For me, Mesa Grill is a good option for an upscale Vegas lunch.

Mesa Grill is located in Caesars Palace, which offers free parking (self and valet).

Let me be truthful, I am comparing the Silver Dragon Chinese Restaurant(SDCR) to the last place(Dragon Chinese Restaurant...yes very similar name) that was in this very building less than a month ago in this review.   

My family and I saw some immediate changes as we walked into SDCR.  They have way more staff than the previous owners.  As you're seated they are at your table in a flash taking your drink order...good right!?   Less than a minute later you are smothered by the service!  I did not like that SDCR is doing everything it can to keep the presentation of the previous place.  Resembling business name, no change to the exterior nor the interior and identical menu with the exception of higher costs.  OK back to the review...a minute after getting the drinks we were confused from the sense of dj vu!  So we order an appetizer to give ourselves some time to get our bearings.  I kid you not, a second server approaches up within a minute of placing our APP order.  I am getting pissed and told the second waitress we're not ready and was really considering paying for the drinks and appetizer and getting out of Dodge!  The suspense of tasting a few of the regular items we used to order from Dragon Chinese Restaurant to see if SDCR could replicate kept us in our seats.  As we are discussing which items to get we kept hearing people arriving after us asking if this was the same place or asking for the previous employees.  The new crew had the mantra of, "we are owned by the same owner" and "we have better food".  Before the appetizer hits the table we were asked to place our order two more times since my last account.  We finally are placing our order as the APP hits the table.

We order Crab Puffs...they had the same appearance and taste, but the serving size went from 8 pieces to 6 pieces at a higher cost.  They brought our order of Chicken Fried Rice and it looked like it should have.  Again the portion shrunk, this time the flavor was off...way off.  I normally do not use soy sauce on my fried rice but this time it was needed because it was bland.  Along with the lack of flavor the peas and carrots were cool not completely cooked.  Next we have our Shrimp Chow Fun, can you guess if the trend will continue...yes smaller portions.  This is not a saucy dish and noodles are dry, I know this but the underside of the noodles were not coated with the sauce which made this dish under spiced too!  While we were eating we overheard a customer from the previous place give specific instructions with his add-ons along with what the previous restaurant charged for the add-ons.  My family and I got a kick out of this guy and chuckled.  My daughter said that the guy was her "spirit animal",kids say the funniest things sometimes.  

My family and I were very critical with SDCR because we REALLY LIKED Dragon Chinese Restaurant.  SDCR has lost our family's go to status.  Will we ever return, sure to see if they get better whenever in the area.  We will no longer make a special trip from Avondale to eat here.  If I did not compare it to one of my once favorite places, I would give it three stars.  At this point it is very average but it is also their first week being opened.

Nourish is one of those places I recently found that I'm hesitant to share on Yelp because I selfishly don't want them to get so crowded that I'll have to wait for a table when I go... 

A friend of mine who lives in the Optima told me about "this new healthy restaurant that opened up" recently, and I couldn't wait to try it. Jared and I went in for dinner last Friday night and were both extremely pleased... we both loved the casual environment, friendly service, and of course the incredibly fresh and healthy food.  

We worked up an appetite by taking a bike ride prior to our visit and we were both starving when we arrived.  We pretty much ordered one of everything on the menu.  OK... that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but we did have the following:

1 x chunky sweet potato and avocado salad - (one of my favorite things that we tried)
1 x quinoa salad 
1 x confetti veggies of the day 
2 x seared sashimi-grade ahi tuna 
1 x salmon burger with peppered air-fried, no oil, sweet potato fries
1 x steamed teriyaki wild rice bowl with chicken
2 x flavored water of the day (it happened to be blackberry that night)

And as if that wasn't enough food for our first visit, we ended up purchasing two orders of quiche so we would have breakfast the next morning... and guess what? We finished everything we ordered and enjoyed it all!

To top off the experience, we got a chance to meet Kirstin, the owner, and she was extremely sweet.  She told us about how she came up with the idea for the restaurant and all of the planning and hard work that went into it.  Judging by our experience that night and the reviews so far, Kirstin's work is paying off... 

Jared actually went back for lunch today and I was jealous!  But I am excited to go back to "nourish" myself very soon.  

A few additional notes:
*There is a bar with plenty of outlets set up so bring your computer and have a working lunch... they've got WiFi too!
*There is a long list of wine, beer, and cocktails.
*Parking is kind of annoying... park underground and walk up.
*There is a dog friendly patio!
*They are closed on Mondays.
*They offer personalized healthy meal plans.
*Catering is also available.

The Sparklings is one of the newer restaurants to have opened in the southwest area, courtesy of the owners of Soyo and Oyshi, which are just down the road.  Walking in, it's hard to not be impressed with the dramatic transformation this space has taken.  I almost felt a bit under dressed with the ornate chandelier dominating the open eating area and a bit concerned pushing my stroller in with a crying baby inside. We had our choice of seating and opted for a corner spot to minimize any distractions.  (I noticed the generous amount of high chairs available, which to me encourages a family-friendly restaurant.)

With a quick glance at the menu, we ended up just ordering appetizers.

* Crispy Gnocchi "creamy pesto, Italian sausage, peas, crushed candied walnuts" ($7.50) - This was good, worthy of making this a meal by ordering two. (Update! I actually did this the following week and it was too much for one person. It's pretty rich, and two orders to yourself is quite a bit. And my gnocchi wasn't as 'crispy' this time. In retrospect, 'crispy' may be a bit misleading. It's more 'browned' than 'crispy'. Nonetheless, it wasn't as 'browned' in the to go order.)

* Grilled Octopus "soy marinated" ($7) - Three little octupi sat on the plate along with some greens.  I like grilled octopus in general, so we liked this dish.  It can be a bit daunting for those not wanting to see the head of a baby octopus.

* Seared Diver Scallops "lemon beurre blanc" ($7.50) - I didn't realize this dish had other items on it besides scallops, so was confused by the texture in my mouth when I thought I eating scallop. I guess along with the scallops were tater tot like disks.  The sauce was a bit fruity.

* Truffle Parmesan Fries "sea salt, parsley, lemon garlic sauce" ($6) - It came with two dipping sauces and the chunks of garlic were falling off.

* Portobello Fries "lightly breaded" ($6) - This also came with two dipping sauces.

* Roasted Beet and Apple Salad "arugula, candied walnuts, balsamic vinaigrette" ($8) - We like beet salads, but it seemed like this salad missed a little something.  They did shave some Parmesan cheese on there, but maybe it needed more nuts?

* Clam Linguini "surf clams, roasted garlic, garden herbs, Italian parsley & white wine extra virgin olive oil broth" ($13) - We took this dish to go for my mom.  She's a big fan of clam linguine and the first thing she noticed was the amount of clams.  She gobbled up the dish and even saved the sauce for the next day.  (She said it was good, but there wasn't enough for the price.) (Update! The Husband obviously liked what he saw when we ordered this for my mom. So the following week he got an order to go!)

Service - The staff were attentive, perhaps even too attentive.  I appreciate more than less, so I can't complain too much.  The restaurant wasn't busy, so they were coming around a lot to ask how things were and if we wanted to order more.  The owner (one of the partners) came around to see how we were doing too. I appreciate when the owners take an active part in their new business ventures because it can show a genuine interest in their clientele, especially if they become regulars.  He mentioned that this was a family-friendly restaurant, which we do appreciate (and noticed a kids' menu available too).

Overall, we like The Sparklings but are a bit confused.  It's very upscale in appearance, but a mix of casual in the menu.  I think they can actually expand on the menu a bit more, and perhaps they will with time.  But for the time being, we just couldn't find anything in the entrees that interested us.  (Items ranged from sandwiches like Philly Cheese Steak ($8.50) and Shrimp Po Boy ($8.50) to pastas, salmon and meats, ie. Rib-Eye Steak ($25) and Filet Mignon ($25).

They do offer a happy hour in the lounge/bar area from 5 pm to 10 pm daily, which means discounted drinks.  Only those over 21 years of age allowed into the restaurant after 11 pm.

I had it all planned out. Vegas Buffets 101, some tips from buddies (Thanks Leona for the last minute answers!)- the best time to go to a buffet is between shifts! 

That's when u get to sample both lunch and dinner at Lunch Price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I lost a battle and ended up going for dinner at around 4pm, not like j had planned, and after seeing gorgeous displays of desserts, tons of yummy looking stations, you forget about the 40 plus dollars you shelled out. But it all worked out in the end. Cuz you don't have to wait that extra time letting your stomach bloat up waiting for the seafood to come out. You hit that first to make sure you get your money's worth! 

No king crab, but snow crab was decent. Especially since they cut it for you already, so no crab juice in your neighbors eye. I ate plenty. 

Starting from the far end, there's the chinese section (WALNUT SHRIMP was my fave). They have chowmein, fried rice, eggrolls, stir fry, some dim sum dishes, spicy eggplant, yummy greenbeans.
They have Pho, Japo station sucked. Miso soup, sushi rolls. (what i would have loved to have seen for shelling out 50 bucks was some decent sashimi, and maybe some tempura!)
Taco station was pretty cool, although i didn't get eat much from this station. 
Cheese and cold cuts
Small build your own salad section and small plates of caprese salad
About 5 different pizzas
Meat section: prime rib, ribs, chops, brisket. damn it, i missed the rib eye lollies.
Little pasta, a good fried section: Calamari, sweet potato tater tots, fries, fish and chips
Crab, shrimp, oysters, mussels, fish dishes.  You can get either steamed crab legs or chilled ones. (steamed is in another section)
HUGE dessert section.

This was my favorite (obviously).
I got French Toast Gelato, Thai iced tea gelato (pretty cool selection),
macarons, cookies, cupcakes, tiramisu, chocolate cream brulee, cakes galore, cake pops. I saw a crepe station, bread pudding... lots o stuff i didn't have room for.

Although i loved gorging myself, there were only a few items that i totally loved. The rest was good, but i'm not sure it was 50 bucks worth good. I would come again for sure, but definitely sticking to my guns to come at the lunch price. 

* i went on a monday around 4pm and walked right in. But weekends, i hear can be hours of waiting! Be prepared!

I noticed after this visit just how much the price has changed when it comes to a brunch buffet. Generally brunch costs more than breakfast, lunch or dinner, but not here at the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station. Brunch on Sunday runs around $9.99 (same price for dinner during the week) with a players card. After being seated I noticed how dirty the highchair was that my nephew was in. I'm talking all sorts of food on either side of it. I cleaned it up with some wipes his mom had with her, but this highchair looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. Our server was great and checked on us often. Even with the big group we had at our table she kept the dishes cleared and brought us refills without us ever having to ask. 

They brunch buffet has the usual stuff. Different breakfast and lunch option at the same time. I walked by the pizza as it was coming out so I figured that was a good time to get some of that. It tasted OK, but definitely tasted like a frozen pizza that was made. They do have a pizza oven right there and you can watch it cook, but it wasn't anything I'd ever go out of my way for. The bacon was hard and tasted microwaved. Scrambled eggs weren't bad or the mini waffle I had. The hash browns were a soggy mess with some burnt crispy parts. I did enjoy the mac & cheese even if it tasted like Kraft deluxe. The breakfast sausage looked good, but tasted nasty. I brought back an assortment of desserts for our table to try and they were terrible! All of the pastries were hard which was a disappointment. I will say that the salad bar had a lot of options including fresh fruit and it all looked good. I enjoyed what I had from the salad bar area much more than anywhere else at the buffet. This buffet could use many changes and isn't really worth it until then in my opinion. 

Kids 2 and under are free.

Daisho Sushi is a moderate drive away from me (located in a large strip mall on the corner of S. Eastern and E. Warm Springs), but after making my way across town to try out their Dinner AYCE sushi, I am definitely a fan and considered the drive here well worth the effort for good food.

As the restaurant is still relatively new, they were not all that busy tonight (plus it was raining, and you know who people here shy away from driving under such precipitous conditions). So after being seated at the sushi bar, it was pretty much just me and Michael K here at the ~70 seats capacity sushi restaurant giving their menu a taste drive.

We started off with the usual limited to one per person orders: 
Uni, Sweet Shrimp and Blue Crab nigiri, they were good.  

We also gravitated towards their APPITIZERS section, and had ordered:
* Salmon Collar (the salmon was so tasty and naturally fatty, it was amazing, like having "Kobe" salmon) and Yellowtail Collar (cooked just right and I really enjoyed it with and without the accompanied ponzu dipping sauce)

* Yaki-tori (skewers): Bacon wrapped Enoki Mushroom, Bacon wrapped Quail eggs, Bacon wrapped Asparagus.  At other restaurants you can order just skewers, paired with responsible consumption of beer and sake and call a great night out.  I really enjoyed these.

* Shrimp Bomb (it is like the Jalapeno popper with shrimp and crab, but without the jalapeno).

* Miso Black Cod - tasty!  Insane in the membrane that this is in the AYCE line up!!!

* Tuna Poki - the poki are prepared to order, not something that was made hours ago and left marinating in the cooler.

* Yellowtail Poki

SPECIAL ROLLS:
* Star Fish (No Rice) made with Yellowtail Tempura, Daikon and wrapped in Tuna, finished with Wasabi Oil, Ponzu and Scallion.  (Recommended)

* Johny Roll (No Rice) made with Crab Meat, Shrimp Tempura wrapped in thin strip of cucumber and finished with Spicy Yum Sauce.

* Wild Fire Roll (No Rice) consist of Tuna, Spicy Tuna wrapped in Soy Paper, topped with Albacore and finished with Garlic Sauce.

* What's Wrong Roll (recommended by Chef Michael) made with Shrimp Tempura, Soft Shell Crab, Green Onions, Masago, Spicy Yum Sauce, topped with assorted fish and finished with Screaming Orgasm Sauce.

I could totally put away more food, but I have an appearance to make at Bacchanal the next day and thought I take it easy and just finished the meal with some Fried Banana with Ice Cream (it was a nice finish to the meal, but nothing that blows me away).

Totally satisfied and very impressed with the food we were served tonight.  There seems to be a handful of new sushi restaurants opening in Las Vegas recently, and most have had positive reviews thus far. So if the other freshmen sushi restaurants are as good as Daisho Sushi (which I now easily considered in my top 3 Las Vegas AYCE sushi restaurant list), the rest of the old guards will have good competition to keep everyone on their toes.  That is good news for all the diners out there.

Note:  Aside from AYCE sushi, Daisho also offers a la carte items for lunch and dinner in addition to their lunch and dinner specials.  And dinner starts from 4pm until closing.  Pricing are very competitive for AYCE (especially lunch, which does not seem to have a reduction in the selections available).

About the Chef: (kernels of knowledge gleamed from small talk during our meal)
Chef Michael is from New York. His parents own a Japanese Ramen, Yaki-tori (Japanese skewers) and Sushi restaurant there.  So even before moving out to Las Vegas and working as one of the sushi chefs at Blue Ribbon Sushi (inside The Cosmopolitan), he was already familiar with the competitive restaurant business. So finally opening Daisho Sushi here in Las Vegas, just seems like the natural path of progression for this passionate young chef in a new city he now calls home.  (Haha, I sound like his autobiographer).


5 stars!  But as words spread and more and more people learn about Daisho Sushi, and the restaurant undoubtedly gets busier, I hope they can keep up with the projected increased interest in their restaurant and the food they serve.  Good luck Daisho Sushi!!!  And I will definitely be back and bringing friends to tryout the amazing food I had earlier tonight.

This was supposed to be a very special dinner as it was my husband's birthday and we had plans to see the DVE comedy tour following dinner along with drinks after.  Unfortunately our dinner at Ten Penny made the rest of the evening very uncomfortable for my husband and very upsetting for me.  I will start with a positive.  We had reservations at 5:30 on a Friday, and for some reason hit like the worst traffic driving into town.  I was getting nervous about being late so I called to see if we could bump up our time 15 minutes.  The lady checked and said yes provided we left by 8:30 because that table was reserved by another party then.  That was no problem and she accommodated my request.

When we arrived we were seated at a semi-circle booth type table along the wall.  I liked the view and the openness of the restaurant.  I ordered a Sangria.  It was ok, sort of weak on the alcohol part.  For my next drink I ordered a Rapture Helltown IPA, which I was told 5 minutes later they just ran out, so I had to pick something else...   Since this was my husband's birthday I was encouraging him to eat whatever he wanted as I was treating and since neither of us had eaten that day I knew he was hungry.  He decided on a BBQ Chicken Flatbread for an appetizer were I had the mussels.  I enjoyed my mussels minus one thing.  They only came with one piece of bread.  I LOVE mussels, but the broth is right up there with what makes them awesome so one piece was inadequate.  I requested more bread, and the waitress asked if I wanted the "bread basket"?  Sure... Ok this part stinks.  The bread in this basket was not suitable what-so-ever for sopping up mussel broth.  There were two muffins, I believe blueberry and raspberry, a dinner roll, and some old twisty roll.  This bread clearly was not the like the crusty bread I had a mere piece of originally.  Ok that was disappointing as I left almost all the broth in the bowl.  I noticed my husband eating his flatbread fast at first and very slow at the end.  Really unusual.  

Onto the main course.  I ordered the seared duck breast, that came with Jasmine Rice, a ginger root puree, with baby bok choy, and a saba glaze prepared medium rare.  My husband ordered the traditional burger, just lettuce and tomato medium cooked.  My thoughts on the duck were mixed.  The duck, though cooked properly lacked seasoning and the worst part was they didn't render down the thick fat surrounding the meat which is unappealing and inedible.  This is cooking 101, render fat down.  The rice was overdone and gummy, but I did like the bok choy with the glaze.  I looked at my husband who was eating his burger slower than a vegetarian with a gun to their head.  "What's wrong?"  I ask. He starts to say he isn't feeling real good all of a sudden, stating he thinks he has heartburn... Not a good sign.

So we finished up and paid.  I spent well over 10,000 pennies on this Ten Penny meal...Pretty pricey meal.  We headed on down to catch the show.  Here is why I wouldn't give Ten Penny a second chance.  Only 15 minutes into the show, my husband is in visible pain.  Grasping his gut he bolts out of the theater and missed most of the second comedian's act leaving me sitting alone watching the event I also spent well over 10,000 Pennies on for his birthday present.  He returns 20 minutes later to tell me how he just tossed his entire dinner and felt awful.  He said it started at the flatbread, as he noticed it wasn't really cooked all the way (doughy) but ate it anyway.  He said as soon as he finished he started to begin to feel sick.  He felt really awful the rest of the night and just as a reminder this was HIS BIRTHDAY!!!  I am not a happy camper that I take him here for his birthday, spend a decent amount of dough, only for him to get sick maybe poisoned and miss some of the show we went to and feel awful the rest of the night.  I would like to go two stars since the service was adequate, accommodating, and friendly but I think most can understand why I just can't.

Within a week, this review could change because that is how often Cowabunga Bay is switching things up. Some other reviews touch on a few of these things, but I am about to break down the nitty gritty. There is a TON of potential for this place, however, I think they were anxious to make some lost money back so they opened too soon. Read on to find out why. 

THE GOOD:

(Please note some things will be on both the good and bad list)

1. The rides. The few they had were pretty awesome. The yellow tube was super fast and great as a double ride. The mats were a blast trying to race your friends to the bottom. Also the Zuma Zuma (bootleg Bombay for the old schoolers) was a family hit. 

2. Some of the food. The pizza combo, a large pizza and pitcher of soda for under $25. You let me know another water or amusement park that feeds a family for that price. TIP: ask them to make the pizza fresh for you! 

3. Free tubes! You are not suppose to take em out the water, but many did. If you can grab one, enjoy it, then let someone else enjoy it. 

4. NO SMOKING! Yep, that's right, if you want to give yourself cancer, there is a nice place for you to do so, OUTSIDE of the park. 

5. Customer service. Other than one little kink with the owner, the staff was great!! The lifeguards were all telling my niece happy birthday and giving her high fives. Everyone seemed to be trying their hardest to please, because there were some things the 16 year old lifeguards, just can't fix!  

6. Wave pool. Super strong tides, and a very short break period between waves. Loved it! Only bad part is, it should go a bit deeper. 

7. The layout. Reminds me of old Wet N Wild. 

THE BAD:

1. Consistency!!!! One lifeguard says parents can go down the kid slides with their kids, one lifeguard says no. We tell the owner, he doesn't even apologize about the lack of training, he simply offers refunds. Cool and all, but we were not looking for refunds! 
Again with the consistency, the weight limits on the rides, make up your mind. The pink slide, you have to be between 130-230 pounds, or you are not going on it. HOWEVER, there is no rule enforcement because my daughter who weighs less, and my boyfriend who weighs more, BOTH RODE THE RIDE FINE!!!
Just figure it out, these employees have not had enough training! They are trying hard, but people are clearly taking advantage. ALSO, PLEASE POST ALL WEIGHT LIMITS!! THE POSTED SIGN OUT FRONT SAYS 260, BUT ONCE INSIDE, THERE IS A 230 LIMIT, AND A 250 LIMIT. WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE 5 SLIDES, WE NEED TO KNOW THIS!!

2. The other half of the food. The churros were rock hard, even the kids did not like it! LAME. Again, if the employees were trained better, they would know not to serve that. 

3. The rides. I think they need more tubes for almost all the rides. The green slide was closed. The weight limits. (they keep changing them) The slides that are NOT being worked on as promised. It should be half price until all rides are open! The few rides that they have are great, so my hopes are high for the rest of them. 

4. The staff. Yes the customer service was evident, but where are the adults? I think half of the reason people were simply taking tubes, going on rides regardless of the weight limit, and smoking was due to the lack of security presence.The lack of ADULT presence. They do serve alcohol. What happens when someone gets belligerent? They literally had to track down a 21 year old to poor my wine. Which makes me wonder how many are even on site? 

5. WHERE IS THE SHADE?!? The effort was there. You do not NEED a cabana for good seats. But the shade shifts so no matter where you sit, you won't have shade all day. At the top of the rides, those poor lifeguards! You built an entire water park you couldn't have added an umbrella at the top for the staff? Also, when standing in line? People who do not have shoes, totally baking!! Lots of sunburns around the park!

6. NO FAMILY RIDE!! Enough said! 

By April of next year, this place could easily be the best water park in Vegas! Add about 4 more slides, fix the weight issue, add more tubes (free and rides), open that little restaurant in the corner, add some more bathrooms and signs of how to get to them, and entertain a crash course training! 
I also think they should have weekly deals. IE: HALF PRICE WEEK FOR HONOR ROLL STUDENTS. IF YOUR NAME IS RANDY OR BRENDA YOU GET ONE DAY FREE ENTRY. SEASON PASS HOLDERS GET A FREE PIZZA. 

A ton of possibilities, I just hope they choose to take advantage of their full potential!

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Boy do we love our HHs down here in the SW!  Gone are the images of older septuagenerian and octogenarian hovering over a buffet line. In fact most HHs seem to have nice mixture of all ages, including those just getting off from work, unwinding before the start of the weekend. For us, it was just hitting the Yard House before the start of a movie at nearby Camelview Five. 

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
Yard House is sort of a hip sports bar, with some really good food and lots of HDTVs. Don't be put off that the corporate parent is Darden, the same folk who own Olive Garden and Red Lobster. You'll need to remember, they also own The Capital Grille, Longhorn, Eddie V's, so they know how to make a fun and tasty experience. 

The restaurant is located in the breeze way, near the two entrances of the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall and the valet parking area.  We sat outside in the patio area on this visit, even though it was in the low 80s. No one was rushing to get inside.  Did I mention we were sitting in the breezeway? LOL

MENU:
Unlike some, there are no special HH menu items offered by Yard House. Their HH prices are 50% off all appetizers and pizzas. These are actually the same size appetizers you would normally receive after 6 pm, so we were impressed. If you look at the photos, you'll see some really nice, mouth watering dishes. 

When you are seated, you are given a huge menu that includes also everything you ever could imagine.  The steaks and burgers are really good and everything is reasonably priced. http://www.yardhouse.com/files/food_menu_20.pdf 

The star at Yard House though is their nearly one hundred beers on tap. There are Heffes, Lagers, Pale Ales, Wheats, dark beers and so much more. If you like beer, this is your place. Nice!

SERVICE:
Our server Jon was excellent. He was also teamed with an equally good supporting cast that all worked well together. Granted Yard House was half full, but everyone was on top of their game.  It was something we appreciated as we looked at our watch, thinking about the movie next door. 

FOOD:
On this visit we ordered the Chicken Nachos (photo) that normally goes for $11.45 and their yummy Margherita Pizza, which comes with roasted garlic on it for $11.65. Both were outstanding and made us wish we could come back later for some more. 

On that topic, Yard House has what I call reverse HH with a special menu from 10 pm to close. On it you'll find such nom nom items as Black Truffle Cheeseburgers, Chilaquiles, Pastrami Dogs and something they call Monte Cristo Pops. Gosh do I enjoy truffle oil on things!  LOL

Yard House's food selection is almost as large as their beer selection.  I would guess you would need at least a dozen or so visits to try everything and I haven't even gotten to their Snacks menu. 

PRICES:
As noted, Happy Hour is 50% off all appetizers and pizza. Our bill came in around $23 including taxes but before gratuities. Jon was great, so we were very generous. 

So Four Stars and "yes, we're a Fan." 

Enjoy!

I remember when a couple of other businesses occupied this location that Weiss Deli is at so I was skeptical about if Weiss was like them or not. The reviews and delicious pictures on yelp got my to finally try this Jewish deli. It is tucked in the corner of a shopping center. They have a decent amount of tables and chairs outside if eating outdoors is your thing. Inside is clean, but the decor is dated. The booth I sat at had gashes in the seat. The inside isn't very big so I imagine trying to eat here on the weekend is a zoo. When you walk inside towards the left they have bagels & pastries for sale. I took a look but the case was empty and I was told by our server that they sell out quick in the mornings. They have a board when you enter that tells you what specials are going on that day.

They have a section on the menu that says "not so hungry" for those feeling like they can't tackle a whole sandwich themselves. You get 1/2 of a sandwich (your choice from the sandwich station area on the menu) and your choice of either a cup of soup, fries, coleslaw,  potato salad or fresh fruit on the side. I decided to order this priced at $9.95 and I can assure you that you do need to be hungry unlike the menu claims because the portions are generous. I decided to try the "Chicken Noodle Soup" and it was the best I have e-v-e-r had in my life! It was hardly a cup like the menu suggests and was filling all by itself. I could just sip on the broth for days! The soup had a couple bagel chips on the side that had such a nice garlic flavor. For my sandwich I went with the "Roast Turkey" on challah bread. The 1/2 sandwich was so big that I had to cut it in half just to eat it. The bread was seriously delicious!  I could only eat a portion of my sandwich and took the rest home for later. My hubby ordered a "Pastrami Burger" priced at $9.95 that came with a side of fries. He said the pastrami had good flavor. 

I saw on the menu they offer catering. 

The next time I stop in I will be trying out something from their tasty looking breakfast menu. I would stop in when working on this side of town just to get some of the soup to-go!

Grand Opening for PoshBurger today!

I had very high expectations...but I was pretty disappointed truthfully 

Little things like the Raw Juices not working yet is acceptable as initial growing pains....Them not having highchairs or boosters for my little foodie dude...borderline acceptable...these things will be fixed in due time.

But a medium rare burger should not be difficult to achieve...especially if it isn't busy out front! The first bite...a well done burger. I sent it back, with apologies from the server and a manager intro. The manager said she would personally check up on the next burger, and to make sure it was done correctly the second time around.  Kobe burger :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/poshburger-bistro-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#4cJIHeKsw7583CsxztmIfw

First bite into the second burger...well done again. Are you serious? Well done, as in cooked 100% throughout. Not a hint of pink at all...the same as the first time. My company was already pretty much done with theirs, and we were running out of time, so I wasn't going to bother sending it back. The server checked on the second burger, saw it was overcooked again, and said she would get the manager.

Meals over...no manager. We get asked for dessert, we decline, and the check comes over....no manager, no discount, no mention about the poor cooking. I pay and get outta there...still no manager chasing me out the door to double check everything, especially being notified of the second time around. 

Keep in mind, this was a $30 hamburger. This is their top tier, most expensive plate they sell....they should be able to cook it right, especially after two tries. And for $30, I got meat that I couldn't tell was Kobe, Waygu, or Sirloin because it was overcooked. The foie gras was a sliver...about an inch wide, that didn't even cover half of the burger. Look closely for it :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/poshburger-bistro-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#QGfHECw6fQR6tXecvIfUhg

The quail egg was great...but small of course. It covered the half of the burger that had no foie gras....It's a $30 burger!! I don't want a half/half burger, but I guess that is what they are going for. There other burgers are probably fine...just don't waste your money on their Kobe burger!

Also, one other small rant....the dips were way too small! We got one small glass bowl that was about halfway filled up...for each set of fry!  Pic of the fries :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/poshburger-bistro-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#jU73XEy-7LnNiXZtTseeFw

I was afraid to ask for more, since it probably would have carried a $2 price tag, so I tried to spread the love out. Fill up the entire glass, or offer two with each fry!

The tuna tartar burger was good though! 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/poshburger-bistro-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#McfVnw8B3SzaAW9zcVPJVg

Very light and refreshing with the asian slaw and wasabi aioli!  I love wasabi, so I kind of wish they went heavier on it, but we know others wouldn't like it that way! The tuna was cooked well, and had a nice consistency...not falling apart or overcooked.

With all that being said, the Kobe burger itself was great tasting, just felt like it should have been a whole lot closer to $18-20 than the $30 price tag.  

I never mind spending good money for a good burger...but double the size of the foie gras to compete with the other gourmet burger spots in town, or you won't last long selling them for the same money.  The flavor IS there, just cook it correctly, and give your paying customers a fair amount of topping...we are paying enough money for it.

I was very VERY VERY underwhelmed by this place. Really folks... the deal is not what it used to be and they are living on lost reputation... kinda like a chicken that is running around after its head is cut off. 

Yes they have some intriguing and great items here. However when I was just here, not 1 person was impressed. When I see the prices that people used to pay of $22 for brunch/breakfast, I can agree my whole outlook would likely be different. However the price is not $39+tax & tip. So realistically you are looking at a $50 meal. Is this place worth that? To be BLUNTLY BRUTALLY HONEST, OHHH HELL NO! It's a standard Vegas buffet.

The Good: 
Bangers n mash - Hands down the best tasting item on the menu. The sausage snapped when taking a bite. Even on a precut portion. The gravy was perfect. However the mash was one of the best, if not the best, that I may have ever had.

Stir Fry Beef - My second favorite item on the menu. But you can get the same results from just about any good Chinese restaurant for $10-15.

Watermelon Juice - Super Tasty, but I cant remember what exactly that they called it

Kalbie Ribs - If you like strong flavors (perhaps over the top) this was an awesome thing to eat as well. There was no subtlety here it was in your face taste and I loved it.

Gelatto - Hit and miss, but the mint chip was outstanding and the best of the 5 flavors that I tried.

Cheesecake - very rich moist and extremely filling in small portions

BACON! Just the right level of crispy and soft. Very flavorful, and tasted more how I make my bacon than I almost ever find at a restaurant.

The OK:
Prime Rib au jus
Blue cheese
Cream corn with red n green peppers
Most of the deserts

The unimpressive:
Angry mac n cheese - bad day? The cheese wasn't creamy and seemed to be separating, very oily
Linked sausage from the carving station - no snapping, no taste, no interest
Fried Chicken - no taste hardly at all. The Colonel 's chicken is ten billion times better than this. (several of the yelpers I was eating with agreed that this is the worst that they have tasted chicken from wicked spoon)
Gnocchi - very very bland with an unanticipated consistency, almost grainy if that makes sense. Definitely different from when I have had this in the past
The asian riblets - very weird tasting and I only took a small niblet to figure that one out

The five billion little dishes for food to come in. This is an utter nightmare. I do like that all the dishes can be tasted separately, but it's still a royal pain in the derrire!  This is easily solved by plates with dividers on them as an option... it is a buffet err cafeteria after all. Ohhh wait, does it matter? They ran out of all of these lil pint size dishes and started putting out large bowls for things previously in mini dishes.

The service sucked. I had to ask for more juice several times and they didn't want to take the dirty dishes even though we had piles of mini bowls, baskets, plates, etc... Then when they did take plates from us, they just grabbed everything from you including what you may still have been working on.

In summation, for the money spent, this place is not worth it to go to again for me. Perhaps it was a bad day. At least I didn't wait in line for this crap like so many others were doing. Drop the price, kills the stupid excess dishes, improve service, make sure you don't have an off day in the kitchen, and I bet I may like it. I would have been satisfied in the $20 range. But at a base price of double that, it simply does not even remotely contemplate being a good deal...

One last thing, being it was brunch, if you wanted champagne, mimosa's, or alcohol period, that was an additional fee. Bottomless mimosa's was an additional $10 per person!

Best... Steak... EVER!!

That's it. Those three simple words sum up my experience this evening. Oh, you want more?! Okay!!

Upon entering the brand spankin' new Lone Butte Casino on my rez.. the Gila River Indian Community, one can find new slot machines, a lounge with waterfalls that can make someone drunk just from staring at it, fresh clean(ish) air... and my favorite amenity... the Verona Steakhouse!!

Entering the nice clean and dare I say it... swanky Chophouse Steakhouse... is both casual and fine dining. Grandma's in their Blue Light special tunics and oxygen tanks sit enjoying enormous Cesar salads that was made table side (!) by well trained servers. I looooove the decor! I small found small touches that reminded me of home, the tortoise shell ceiling that melded traditional Pima basket designs with Italian decals, interesting. 

There's a nice mural and huge windows that with Cafe 24/7 encircle a very beautiful fountain. (I'm assuming this is to recreate a whirlwind design, which is a well known symbol to my tribe, "all crazy times are a whirlwind" - Pima proverb) If you're dining indoors, especially in the day time its very nice to have these huge windows, I kinda wished we were sitting by one of them! 

Our server Jessica presented us with some bread and made a dipping sauce made with Bellagio olive oil, balsamic vinegar, freshly grated parm and cracked pepper. Lovely. I couldn't get enough!

I ordered the 12oz Rib eye with Squash w/pancetta for $25. I was very specific with my steak. I ordered it pan-roasted to medium and finished with butter, served with a side of blue cheese. And I got it medium and grilled on the salamander. I was disappointed when it first hit the table, and then I took a bit... oh em.. gee!!! 

Never, EVER - have I had a steak THIS good!! Tender, perfectly chard, flavorful, beautifully seasoned and well rested. The sign of any great steakhouse is in how well they rest their steaks before serving. I couldn't believe it was so amazing... but I can't help but to wonder how it would have been if I got it the way I wanted it! I also can't help but to wonder if the chefs in the back knew better than me! I did tell the server that the order was wrong... but that I was happy and didn't need to have it fixed or replaced. She was relieved and waited on us hand and foot afterward. 

My mom got the Special. An 8oz Filet Mingon with asparagus, roasted potatoes and eggplant ragu for $27! She ordered it well done! (ARGH! I know I know... ugh, some ppl! :P) But it was very good... even if they ruined it to her specifications! 

We ate to our hearts content and walked away very happy with our meal. I ran into my biological mom (long story) and her husband celebrating their wedding anniversary, I told the waiter and he hooked them up with a free dessert! How awesome is that?! The manager walked the front of the house asking everyone (including us) how our meals were going. They pay attention to the small details, which is something I notice and appreciate. 

I may not be able to afford it ALL the time... but I will DEFINATLY be back with MANY more in tow!! I wish they were open 24 hours like the other restaurant at the Casino, but alas - they have lunch and dinner service only. To my yelpers, I say... GO, GO NOW!! What are you waiting for?! I don't care if you're not in the area... GO! Its not THAT expensive... quit crying! :P Go and enjoy yourself!! Try some wine and give the Cesar salad that's prepared table side! And don't forget the cannoli! I hear it's yummy! And be sure to play a few slots on your way out! ;)

$35 per person (dinner)

well, the food is your typical buffet food...most of the food were below average. I am kind disappointed they could't use some better ingredients.

Chinese station- 
eggplant- super salty
seafood bun (my friend tried it and warned us not to get it)
dumpling in the noodle soup (my friend tried it said ok, noodle and dumpling not as mushy as we thought since it's not made to order)                              

Latin Station- pork chop- overcooked, dry and salty

Japanese station- sushi- horrible (old and cold rice, not so fresh fish)
seaweed salad- average
                                 
Carving station: Salmon- overcooked
                          Prime rib- overcooked and really bad quality of meat

Salad station- make your own salad

Everything is fresh and the woman worked behind the counter was really nice. However they don't have any special ingredient not even arugula. 
Dressing is pretty standard too. 

sauteed vegetables or salad from different stations were all not bad.  

Mac n cheese- super marshy  (couldn't finish it)

crackers with few different choices of cheese- standard

hummus with super cold display like pita bread- standard

Dessert station- nothing looks very appetizing. 
cream brulee- the caramelized top was such a failure. It tasted like soft syrup layer float on top of it. We normally like cream brulee but it's just bad no one want to get another one.. 
cookie- alright, your typical cookie.
As I remembered the buffet at M resort or Pala were way better for the dessert option. 

Drink station: iced tea and coffee, standard. The machine made it difficult to make iced coffee your own.

also they have unlimited beer and wine if you drink. 

Didn't try anything else. I actually forgot to try the crab legs and cocktail shrimps!

I am quite disappointed the quality of food here that probably not even compare to those casino buffet near LA. Service was fast and nice though. 

My friend got resort credit for $75 and had 2 buy one get one free deal from MyVegas so the meal was basically free. 

But if you have to pay for it...avoid at all cost.

My first visit being so-so, I decided to give Teriyaki Madness a second try to see if I liked it any better. For me it was still the same so-so experience and I don't get the hype over this place. Inside is very clean and they have plenty of tables to choose from and the booths are spacious which is nice. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu. Some of the food I ordered was really good and some of it was not so good. I do get coupons in the mail sometimes for BOGO offers, so I can see coming back with a coupon and probably will since the rice and chicken are pretty darn good and I work in the area, but I can't see making a point to come here often. 

Spicy Chicken Teriyaki Plate ($8.99) - I took the white rice that came with it and mixed it with the chicken. I liked the flavor of the chicken a lot. There was a good portion of both rice and chicken. I'd order this again for sure. 

Spicy Beef Teriyaki Plate ($9.49) - For an extra $1 this time I chose noodles instead of rice. The noodles were a bit dry and lacked flavor. The beef was tender and tasted good, but I tasted teriyaki flavor and no spice which was a bummer because I had enjoyed the spicy chicken and the chicken actually kick. The overpowering flavor of teriyaki on this one will most likely mean that I will stick to the spicy chicken instead.

Chicken Egg Roll ($1.99) - Inside I saw tons of what appeared to be black pepper yet the egg roll really had no flavor. It was filled with a generous amount of chicken, but it was greasy and flavorless. 

Chicken Pot Stickers ($3.29) - These were a greasy and overcooked mess. On the menu these are described as "crazy good" and I got 5 of them that were crazy greasy and hard. The inside tasted not so great. I will stick to the stickers elsewhere. 

Stir-Fry Veggies and a Green Salad are each options for sides. The salad came with a sweet dressing that tasted good. The veggies were basic yet tasty and fresh. 

Orders are made fresh so if you are on a lunch break or crunched for time then call your order in so it's ready or at least being made while you are on your way to pick it up.

Shame on me for not eating here sooner! Vintner Grill is in a business complex and can be easy to miss, but you will not want to. I was surprised upon entering VG, it had  a modern beach feel to it. The patio chairs were very roomy, comfortable and had pillows. If eating inside isn't your thing they have cabanas outside, but only a couple so if you want to make sure and get one it would be best to make a reservation. 

If cheese & wine are your thing then VG is the place for you! They have a selection of over 400 wines from different countries. They also offer 30 different beers from around the world. When it comes to the cheese, the menu says VG has one of the largest selections of cheese in Las Vegas! They also have a nice selection of house cured meats. If you are interested in buying their cheese online instead of at the restaurant you can go to the following website http://vgcheese.3dcartstores.com/ to place your order.

Out server checked on us often and was very nice. A man came around with a bread tray and offered us a complimentary variety of breads and left some butter and oil on the table. The bread was delicious, but it would be easy to fill up on this stuff so I just had a few bites. After looking over the menu it was hard to decide since so many things sounded tasty. I chose the "Classic Cobb W/Grilled Beef Tenderloin Salad" that had a bacon-blue cheese vinaigrette. This salad priced at $14 and had green onion, hard boiled eggs, hearty blue cheese crumbles, fresh greens and of course the beef tenderloin. The vinaigrette was so good! The beef was cooked perfect, tender and flavorful.  I couldn't stop eating this salad it was just so good. All of the flavors meshed well together and I will happily order it again! I was having lunch with a friend who ordered the "Grilled Lemon-Marjoram Chicken Salad" also priced at $14 and she enjoyed it. 

Vintner Grill is the perfect place to have lunch with a friend, date night with that special someone, or celebrate an occasion with family and friends. VG has a private party space and also offers catering.

After hearing so much about Taco Taco I suggested it for dinner this last weekend. We made the drive across town and arrived around 9 pm. I could see as I was opening up to the door that nobody else was in line so I was a little nervous but with all of the hoopla and the drive over we wanted to give Taco Taco a shot. 

The signs above easily direct you to the line you want to order from. I knew I had to try the "Al Pastor Tacos" so I ordered 2 of those. I asked for pineapple but the worker said they didn't have any. I have seen other pictures with pineapple so they must have just been out for the day. I then made my way over to where hubby was at and I ordered a "Cheese Quesadilla" and a "Asada Taco". Hubby had already ordered a "Asada Burrito". You can choose corn or flour tortillas and they do make them right in front of you. By the time we finished ordering the place had filled up so we beat the rush! We grabbed our food and headed towards the back and found a pretty nicely sized dining area. There was a salsa bar with a variety of stuff. I didn't get anything from the salsa bar so I can't comment on if it was good or not. I can however comment on the following:

Cheese Quesadilla - This was priced at $2.25 and very good! It was filled with the perfect amount of cheese and wasn't really greasy. I would order this again.

Al Pastor - Priced at $2.00 each these didn't blow my socks off. It was missing the pineapple I love so much and just lacked the flavor I have had at other places. This is usually my favorite thing to order but not so much here. I will probably give it another try on a different day to see if something is different but if not I wouldn't order it again.

Asada Tacos - These were amazing. Such good flavor! I wish I had gotten more of these than the al pastor but I will know for next time. 

Asada Burrito - I didn't like this. Hubby gave me some to try and it just didn't have the same flavor as the asada in the tacos. They did pull the asada meat for the burrito from a different place then the asada that was on the grill for the tacos so I don't know if they make them different but I will personally stick to the asada tacos instead of the burrito.

They offer rice bowls and have vegetarian options. I can't say I will make the effort to drive across town just to eat at Taco Taco but when I am in the area I will stop in for sure since it is a cheap and good.

I had this place on my radar, so when fellow yelper, Loon E. and his girl were in town and suggested this place, I was all in! Walking inside it seemed dark, but I liked it. We chose a table and menus and waters were quickly brought to us. Loon had a beer I tasted that was supposed to be ginger flavored, but the ginger taste was very faint. After looking over the menu it was hard to decide what to order because it all looks so good. 

The menu consists of signature, premium and vegetarian pasties, soups, salads, desserts and an interesting variety of appetizers. To start I ordered "Oven Chips" priced at $3.50 plus an additional 50 cents for cheese I wanted on them. The chips are hand cut British style and baked in the oven with cracked pepper and sea salt. I thought the chips were a bit on the soggy side. I wondered if it was because of the addition of cheese that made them soggy, but after tasting the oven chips with jalapeno and no cheese that the others at my table were sharing, they too were mushy and soggy to me.

I ordered a "Carne Adovada" pasty priced at $9.50 and WOW! After the first bite, my taste buds were dancing with joy! This pasty has simmered pork in a New Mexican red chili stew, rice, chilies and cheddar. It also comes with a side of salsa and sour cream. There is so much great flavor going on in this pasty! I honestly never even tried the salsa that accompanied it because the pasty itself has such good flavor on it's own, but I did really enjoy it with the sour cream. I must come back and eat this again! I sampled some of the "Bangers and Mash" pasty and thought the first bite was okay, but the next was a bit blah. The red wine gravy that came with it was too salty. I have to say that it isn't something I have ever had before, so I truly can't compare it to another, but the flavor wasn't for me.

Our server was just great! I wish I could remember her name to give her a proper shout-out, but I can tell you aside from being an awesome waitress, she knows all about Emoji and how everybody needs a little in their life! ;)

If you wanted they have an option to take a part-baked pasty home to bake when you are ready to eat it. The part-baked pasties are sold at a reduced price, but they make a certain amount fresh throughout the day, so I would recommend calling your order in to make sure they can have the pasty you want ready to take home. I want to come back at some point to try out some of their other sides and try baking a pasty at home to see how it turns out. With the variety of pasties here, if a certain one doesn't work for you flavor-wise, give another one a try! Maybe you will find a favorite like I did!

I've been torn about my review of Giada for a couple weeks now.  There were some HUGE highs and some MAJOR lows of my experience there.  I will appologize for the length of this review, in advance. If someone from management reads this, I will be glad to discuss further.

I was traveling for work and having dinner by myself.  I stopped into Giada (2 weeks after opening) and asked how long the wait will be and if i could just find a spot at the bar.  The manager at the front of the house said that the bar was being used for overflow, and that the wait would be about 45 minutes to sit.  I agreed and went to play some blackjack at the Cromwell.

After about an hour, nobody called, so i went to check.  Upon arriving, the hostess said that I could be seated.  On my way to the seat (which ended up being at the bar), she offered to give me a tour of the restaurant.  She showed me the house made pasta, the kitchen, the bread, and other areas,  I was very excited to feast.

As I sat at the bar, i ordered a McClellan scotch.  The bartender then gave me an iPad menu.  As I was looking through the menu, i only saw Antipasto dishes.  I asked if I could see the complete menu, and was then told that only antipasto is available at the bar.  This was not explained to me, and I was even led to believe (due to the tour and conversation with the hostess) that the entire menu was available.

After looking at the menu for 15 minutes, I decided I would not eat there because I did not just want antipasto.  I asked for the check, but the bartender, Katie (who was amazing) asked me to please stay and said the would find the manager for me.  She also said that she would bring me out some antipasto dishes while I was waiting.

They brought out some big antipasto dishes, and I will admit that they were quite good.  There exceeded my expectations, and I was happy I stayed.  Finally as I was eating, the manager did come out.  He then went to the couple next to me, and asked them if everything was OK.  They said things were fine.  I knew he was supposed to ask me, but because I look young and was dressed in a T-shirt, I think he decided to ignore me.  The bartender then gesture to him that he was supposed to be talking to ME,  He then asked me if everything was OK.

I explained the situation to him, and told him I really wanted to try the food from the full menu.  I know that he has made this exception for people in the past from talking to the bartender (and that is why she called him), but he decided not to budge for me.  He gave me some BS excuse and I could tell he was just not being very genuine.  It honestly would have been better for the restaurant to just not even had him come see me.  He basically offered nothing and then left.  He said he would get me a free drink, that never game

So, why 3 stars?  The bartender, Katie, is AMAZING,  She made a terrible experience great. If not for her, this would have been a 1 star review.  She is an asset to Giada.  She only charged me for the drinks I had and didn't charge for the food (since I didn't even want to order it).  Obviously, she got a large tip.  If the manager didn't come out, this would be a 4-5 star review.

The manager that came out was terrible.  He treated me with little respect and deserved to make this a 1 star review.  The management is a liability to Giada, and she should rethink who is running the customer facing team.  In addition, they should explain the the full menu is not offered at the bar.

I will go back to Giada, sit at a table, and try the full menu.  For now, this experience left me in the middle.

SUNDAY BRUNCH:

What a terrific way to spend a beautiful Sunday morning.  This brunch has it all from the character, atmosphere, unique brunch items and service.  I like how they encourage even the customers to come wearing pajamas.  We opted not to but we definitely will next time. 

To say I went over the top with the food is an understatement.  The fullest I have ever felt in my left and believe me when I say I can be a ridiculously gluttonous pig.  Even my wife who eats with me everyday was taken a back.  I was out of control. 

I did actually have as small as a dinner the night before in order to be as hungry as I could do get my $40 worth of all you can eat.  We started with the dishes at the self serve area.  There were 6 choices at the panini/sandwich/crepe station and we had 3 of them.  The super friendly and helpful gentleman manning the station suggested his favorite which was a slice of baguette grilled in some kind of honey and butter which was outstanding.  My only thought was that it would taste even better while being inebriated.  The crepes were just ok and could've been a little more toasty than spongy but that's just our preference. 

The sushi station was way above the average buffet sushi.  All the nigiri and rolls were made to order with the exception of Simon's signature crispy tuna which were amazing.  I had 8 pieces of crispy tuna and 8 pieces of salmon.  They also had a whole slab of smoked salmon layed out and I probably had 5 slices of that.

The juice station!  I loved this.  Does any other restaurant offer this as part of the menu?  Please let me know if there is because I would be all over this.  Freshly squeezed fruit, protein shakes, vegetable juices, yogurt smoothies and I could have as many as I wanted to.  Damn, dude!  I must've had 7 glasses of various liquids.  I didn't partake in the extra alcohol deals since I didn't feel like being bombed and then hungover by 4pm.  But the deals were reasonable: $12 for unlimited Black Star beer or $17 for unlimited champagne/mimosa/bellinis or $14(?) for unlimited trips to the make your own bloody mary bar.  I would rather have them make my bloody mary since I would screw it up but it looked quite popular.

And on top of all this great stuff there's the a la carte menu.  We had the french toast which I think was encrusted with Frosted Flakes.  It was crunchy, sweet with a soft center.  Genius!  

4 different types of hash.  I generally dislike Hollandaise sauce but it was ok with the steak hash.  We also got an additional fill of protein from the egg white frittata which was packed with 5 different veggies including corn, onion and several peppers.  I was unable to finish the frittata due to the fact they must've used about 12 eggs in it.  

Breakfast pizza is a must.  So wrong yet so right.  Topped with sausage, bacon, country gravy and other ingredients that make diets run and hide.  I inhaled it like a champion.  

You've probably heard of the meat sweats but have you ever heard of breakfast sweats?  That's what I went through about an hour after the meal.  So much good food.  I am definitely going to pace myself better next time and will definitely do less carbs as well but everything looked (and tasted) so damn good!

Okay, one of the best steak houses I've eaten at!  

I spent New Year's in Las Vegas and this was one of the places we went for dinner.  We were also seeing the Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson One after dinner so being in a slight rush, we were hoping they would be able to get our food out in time because we had to be seated by 6:45 pm at the Mandalay Resort.  Once we told them this, the serving staff were all very accommodating and stressed that they would put a rush on things.  

I made a reservation through Open Table for 5:00 and they happen to open right at 5:00. Since we got there a little earlier so as not to miss our show, we had a few minutes wait before they could seat us so we waited at the bar. I ordered a VIP Martini which is their signature drink. Very refreshing indeed!

We were finally seated and my friend and I each ordered the Prime Strip which was 16 ounces (1 lb.) of delicious aged beef.  We were first served some great bread and butter.  I also had the Bleu Cheese Wedge Salad which was really nice, big and filling.  Along with the steak, we ordered sides of the sauteed mushrooms and asparagus with almonds.  Both were really delicious but I couldn't eat very much of it because I was getting really full from the steak which I was intent on finishing.  It was my main goal since I didn't want it to go waste and the besides the fact that it tasted so darn good, so tender with the right amount of seasoning and cooked to perfection, scrumptious!!  We asked the server how they prepared it and she told us so now I can hopefully replicate it at home sometime.  It'll probably won't be the same however because it never is when you try to do it at home.

I enjoyed the dinner immensely do I will definitely come back again when I'm in Vegas when I want a  steak because they do it up right here.  They have a nice decor with dark woods making the ambiance really comfortable and inviting.

If you're looking for a good steak house, I highly recommend coming to Del Frisco's because you won't be disappointed in the food or service.

The new, old El Chorro Lodge has been reopened for all of two days, and a friend of a friend managed to secure a reservation during their soft opening, so I got an opportunity to check it out.  I was impressed, but not blown away.  Everything I tasted was quite competent, but if I had to choose a word to describe the menu, I would suggest "staid."  Perhaps even "stodgy," but that may be more harsh than I intend.

Review the dinner menu.  http://bit.ly/aWqVVJ.  There, see what I mean?  Replete with Traditional American entrees and sides, at what I would consider fairly exorbitant prices.  I would say that I wouldn't go back to eat this food at these prices, unless someone else was paying.  

I should note that a big part of why I wasn't impressed is because this place is simply not my style.  The wait staff, attired in khakis and blue shirts, was a little too informal for the prices we were paying, I felt.  The menu options were a little boring for my taste.  The cocktail menu is exactly not what I'm looking for these days, although I will be very interested to see what Happy Hour looks like.  The decor is a tad heavy on the Old Southwest theme, although to be fair, this place not only pulls it off rather stylishly but also is among the most authentically old and southwestern establishments in the Phoenix metro area.  

The patio and open bar are fantastic.  The bar area is considerable, and the patio is palatial - up above Lincoln Dr enough to be fairly quiet, with a gorgeous view of Camelback, sunset here must be incredible.  

Anyway, back to the food.  Everything was very well executed, from the sticky buns we were served upon being seated to the desserts we ordered.  I chose the soup of the day to start, a tomato/basil concoction that was quite hearty and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The salads my dining companions ate looked boring to me, but they all claimed them to be excellent, with "the best Caesar dressing ever" and "polenta croutons?!?" being the verdict for the Caesar salad, at least.  On to the entrees.  I ordered the crispy duck, which I found to be delicious and quite hearty, though not what I would call crispy by any means.  It was a very sizable portion, and very well prepared.  My dining companions ordered the pork chop, the lamb, and the salmon, and we each sampled from each other's plates.  I would try the lamb if I went back, but the consensus seemed to be that everything was very well prepared, with the duck being a winner.  It was served with a heap of mushy sweet potatoes (just like my mom makes at Thanksgiving - delicious!) and red cabbage, which I sampled and declined to finish.  Again, not quite my style.  

We moved on to dessert - sticky bread pudding with a bourbon glaze and the warm chocolate cake.  The bread pudding was a winner at the first two or three bites, but grew one-dimensional as I continued nibbling at it.  The chocolate cake was decadent, among the best I've ever tasted.  It was clearly made with a considerable amount of dark chocolate, which seals the deal for me.  And in case you were wondering, my dining companions apparently have no stamina when it comes to dessert.  Suckers.  

Anyway, as I've said now several times, this place is just not quite me.  It's totally classy and very high in quality, but not quite adventurous enough for my taste.  I'd love to come back for brunch, and once they unveil their happy hour menu, I'm sure I'll be back to check it out, but I won't be back for dinner unless I can convince someone else to pick up the check at the end of the evening.  

As a side note, this place is so very Paradise Valley.  It's a welcome relief knowing that there is a place that is so anti-scene out there.  It's been a little while since I've been both the youngest and among the poorest in a room, and I will say it was a little comforting.  Just don't tell the Scottsdale people about this place, and we'll all be happy.

Interesting Fact: The father owns Sapphire Gentleman's Club and his son owns El Dorado Cantina - that's why they share the same massive blue Sapphires building. Don't worry, you can still come here with nana and little Tommy - El Dorado's entrance and dining room is separate from Sapphires and just a couple of steps to the left of the strip club's entrance. 

Parking: If you see the massive blue glowing Sapphires building, you're at the right place. Turn into their parking lot, try to dodge the shitty cab drivers all lined up at Sapphires and snag yourself a parking spot right in front. 

I'm embarrassed to admit this, but ever since I moved here from Southern California, I pretty much wrote off Mexican cuisine, until now. I've had way too many terrible experiences and disappointments - I couldn't find any of the juicy and spicy flavors I was looking for.

Well, that all changed when I tasted El Dorado's trio of salsas, I knew from the very first bite, that my dinner would follow suit with how incredible the salsas tasted. They have 3 different spice levels mild (roasted green tomatillo), medium (charred chipotle), and crazy spicy (habanero). They don't mess around here! The spicy habanero salsa had lots of smashed chunks of habanero chilies; so let this be your warning, it's spicy but also so damn flavorful. I didn't have a favorite because they were all so incredibly flavorful. The best salsas I've had in a while. Flavor rating: 5/5

Here's what we ordered:

Tostaditas de Tinga $5.50 (Gluten Free) - Flavor rating: 5/5
You can order these from the small bites/appetizers menu and they are crazy good! Super moist and flavorful chipotle marinated chicken with grilled onions, served over fresh crispy tostadas, topped with flavorful refried beans, queso fresco, sour cream, and (mild red) salsa cascabel - comes with 3 for $5.50 or $2.75 during happy hour! It looks simple, but the flavors are explosive! Top them with any one (or all) of the trio salsas they give you, for an extra added wow! 

Al Pastor $9.50 - Flavor rating: 3/5
Marinated pork with pineapple chunks, cilantro, onion & lime. Comes with three tacos per platter, served with moist and perfectly seasoned cilantro rice & your choice of refried or black beans - get the refried beans! Typically, I wouldn't care for beans, but they're very moist and packed with amazing flavor. They aren't the best or most authentic al pastor tacos I've ever had, but the tacos were very moist and everything on the plate tasted freshly prepared. The al pastor meat was a tad mild in flavor and spices for my taste. Yet, everything else on the dish was seasoned perfectly. 

Chicken Enchiladas $13.50 - Flavor rating: 4/5
Slow cooked chicken breast marinated in chiles, wrapped in fresh corn tortillas & cheese, topped with mild and flavorful green tomatillo sauce, sour cream & queso fresco. 
Served with delicious and well seasoned cilantro rice & your choice of refried or black beans. The portion size is generous and filling. We enjoyed the flavor of the moist enchiladas and with added dollops of salsa of each bite. 

We also tried the Strawberry Agua Fresca. It was refreshing and not too sweet, but I think it was slightly watery for my preference. It's still perfect for warm weather, spicy food and I enjoyed it. Flavor rating: 3/5

I'm a huge fan of this place! The chef truly shines at his talent and you can really taste the care that went into each preparation. I can tell it's been taste-tested before served and I'm a fan of restaurants that pride themselves in quality control. Plus, the service we received from KAI that evening was top-notch. He went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of. 

Other important details: 

Happy Hour twice a day:
* 3pm - 6pm - $1 street tacos, 1/2 off bottled domestics & wells
* 11pm - 2am - 1/2 off all appetizers, 1/2 off bottled domestics & wells

Pro tip: during the day it's more-so family friendly and during the late-night-owl hours and onward, there is more of a mature crowd with a sprinkle of girls off the clock grabbing their dinner after work.

I don't throw the following sentence out very often but when I do, I mean business so here it goes...I had the best sandwich I've ever eaten here. I am not exaggerating. So if you stop reading this review right this second, at least you know and now you can you get into the car, make your way to Mesa and try one for yourself. 

So on to the rest of the review. I've been lucky enough to have an Ike's sandwich in SF and couldn't believe my eyes when I found out they were moving to Arizona. Their location is a bit of a drive for me, but the sandwich truly makes it worth it. 

Here's how the experience works. This is a casual sandwich eatery where you can come in solo, order and take it to go, or dine in with a couple friends. Anything goes at Ike's. Now, when you walk in, you'll immediately be overwhelmed by a board listing off a variety of every sandwich combo imaginable and it's not your run of the mill sandwich combo. No way. It's a combo of everything good in life that's put in between two slices of bread and served either hot or cold, depending on your sandwich. I suggest looking at Yelp reviews, pictures and the menu before you arrive to avoid major menu anxiety like I experienced. Also, note that every sandwich has a hilariously funky name so you might get lost in translation just simply reading the names! 

Once you've made your sandwich selection, you'll order at the counter from one of the incredibly friendly staff and they are truly genuinely friendly! It was such a breath of fresh air to experience a sandwich at Ike's. The decor is just as fun and funky as the staff and sandwich choices and be sure to look on your napkin holder because it will tell you something pretty about you! 

Now on to the best part, the sandwich. I don't even know where to begin. First, they serve this special bread that typically can only be found in N. Cal and it's amazing. Cheese is baked into the bread. I tried the Bella which is their most popular and I'm not surprised. It's a combo of chicken that has been slow-cooked for several hours and then tossed in this delicious honey mustard. Then they top it with cheese, avocado and this special mayo spread. I suggest adding some hot sauce to it. It's served hot and it is large and in charge, so unless you're ready for a last supper meal you will probably have some left-overs or your might want to share. It's worth every single calorie consumed and then some. 

Now, although this is about a 15-20 minute drive from my house, I will absolutely be visiting on a regular basis and can't wait for them to open additional locations!

PS - if you get lost, it's across the street from the mall!

The other day I was reading my past reviews when i relized that I never reviewed Fez! I couldn't believe it!! So I decided to wait for a VERY special occasion to give my review... and what better occasion is there than my 100th review?! 

And then came the next problem... which Fez experience do I share? Do I talk about the first time I went to Fez? Last summer when I went to my first Yelp Elite event where I first met their Sweet Potato Fries? That are so fresh and crispy and sweet and salty at the same time with their honey mustard type sauce? I remember those trays were vanishing before my eyes! I also can't forget the Fez kirsa with it's barbequed sauced grilled chicken, pears and cilantro melted on a large flatbread with manchego cheese. 

Or do I talk about the time I caught brunch at Fez? I had the ever amazing Fez burger! I feel in love with their savory angus burger layered with pear and cheese on a chibatta bun, best lunch ever - even if the salad that it comes is a little on the bitter side. My cousin had the breakfast pasta. A bowl of sausage, peppers, onions, bacon melded together with scrambled eggs and finished off with parmesan cheese. My sister really enjoyed her Douxelle Burger with it's chibatta bun, angus beef, mushrooms, onions, provolone cheese, mustard and tomatos. 

What about the yelp happy hour at Fez? Where my good buddy Robert M. introduced me to their pomegrantini... make it double pleez! Loves it.... I also tried their habanero poppers... sweet, spicy, creamy and crunchy at the same time! They're off menu ya'll but they are ALWAYS what I look forward to! just don't touch your eyes after popping one! Oh and their hummus!! Garlicky creamed chikpeas with olive oil and served with warm kisra. So delish! 

And then there was the time I went to Fez for Queer Christmas. The queens were abound trading vinyl copies of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir's Sings and a photo session with tranny santy with yours truely behind the lens! That was such an awesome night, but it wouldn't have been as amazing if it weren't for the crazy-awesome bartenders who were keeping them coming!

Or what about the time I went for my beloved Thomas' birthday party? We were tossing back Tommitinis all night long! I introduced all of ya'll to my good friend who helped me to break the ice with some strangers and helped me to attack a platter of their Rosemary Chicken Sandwiches... we drunkenly immersed ourselves in its goodness!! Rosemary/lemon marinated grilled chicken topped with pesto, artichokes and bell peppers. It was so good, I took some home!!

That event inspired me to give the Casablanca Chicken Sandwich a try when my mom and I happened to drop by for dinner one day. She really liked her fez lettuce wraps but found them difficult to eat... "It's so long! I can't fit it in my mouth!" she exclaimed... "Ummm... that's usually a good thing mom!" was my smart ass retort. lol... once she figured it out, happily declared them better than P.F. Chang's! haha!! Aren't moms cute?! I liked the Casablanca Sandwich, I found that the grilled chicken, goat cheese, pears, cherries and other various greens on a chibatta buns go VERY well with Fez's S&P fries. A combo, I think shouldn't ever be separated! 

Yup... I'm not sure which experience I'll write about in my yelp review! All I know is that everytime I leave Fez I'm stuffed and eliated that I went, and that ain't the booze talking! One of the best things about Fez is that even though it's uber-slick and crazy-mod in decor... it still feels like home! I go and I know I'll see a friend... or atleast someone I drunkenly hit on inbetween drink orders! My ONLY complaint is that sometimes the servers need to be reminded of what you just asked for. I once ran out of the sauce for the sweet potato fries and needed to ask for some three times before I got it. 

Another thing I'll need to think of when I do write my Fez review... is what is my message going to be to my yelpers? I think I'll say something like... Hurry up and GO! What has been keeping you?! Sure it's uber-sleekness may seem cold at first, but once you sit down and get comfortable, it becomes home. Give the sweet potato fries a go and try the Fez burger - you won't regret eaither! The people there are very cool and of course there's THOMAS!! The host with the most! Always with something crazy to say. He keeps the party rockin'! If there's ONE thing you need to know about Fez it's that you are about to have a good meal. 

Yup... I think I'll write something along those lines! I unno... whatcha'll think?

Saw this new business pop up on my Yelp app and wanted to check it out. I'm always interested in supporting local business', especially a burger joint. After seeing some good reviews and pics, decided to come here last night.

BB is connected to the 76 gas station on LVB right across from the Lee's discount liquor, and it is close to where the old Stoney's used to be. Walking in, there is a small counter to order, a sitting bar for 5 seats, and a small table for 3. After checking out the menu, I picked out a few items and waited for about 7 minutes for my food to come out.

Note: I was lucky that there were no orders before me. There is only 1 person cooking, and he takes the ordering as well, so, the 3rd person after me had to wait 15-20 min for their food.

Burger - my favorite part of this burger was the bun, it was toasted perfectly. The lettuce and tomato were very fresh. The meat was juicy and was well seasoned. It was greasy, but in a good way.. It would make a great hangover burger. Even though in-n-out is still my favorite burger, I would rank it slightly below that, but ahead of five guys.

Fries - I like the fact that the owner used unpeeled fresh potatoes instead of frozen ones. They are the big, thicker ones. Also, he gave me a ton of them for 2.25. Wish they could have been crispier and more seasoned, but I liked them.

Chicken wings - they were the bigger sized wings, which is always a +. He put a Popeyes style breading on them, and there were hints of garlic. They were crispy, but I thought they could have been a little bit more crispy, that would have taken them over the top.

The owner is friendly and checked to see if everything was alright even though he was busy. I'll probably come back again if I'm hungry and near the area. I would come back at an earlier time, maybe the afternoon, because there are vagabonds in the area that like to hang around the gas station late at night. They also have cheesesteaks that are not on the menu, and other specials, all you have to do is ask the owner.

After seeing Guy rave about this place on "DDD"  and having many yelper friends telling hubby and myself that we needed to try this place I finally gave in. A lot of the reason it took so long to try is because I am not fan of burgers. While hanging out with one of our best-est buddies Joshua G and his wifey we decided to give Bachi Burger a try.

Upon entering there were plenty of tables open but maybe not enough servers or something. The hostess told us as well the customers coming in after us that there would be a small wait so the severs could catch up. After being seated our drink orders were taken right away. I have to say the service here is great. Our server was fantastic. 

I knew I wasn't going to order a burger so I took a look at what sides and salads they had to offer. I decided to go junk food style and order some "Crispy Onion Rings" priced at $3.50 and "Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries" priced at $4.50. The onion rings were pretty good. The fries were good but I sure didn't taste any garlic. Paying extra money to have the garlic fries I do expect it to actually taste like garlic fries. My man ordered a "Bachi Burger" and added cheddar cheese and bacon. He did enjoy the burger but not for the price. I feel personally that for the price of the burger it should have came with fries instead of paying separate for them. I don't want to go to a burger place that looks like they just threw a few random *fancy* things on the walls just so they can charge me a la carte for everything. I have no problem paying a la carte for a establishment that enforces a dress code and doesn't have kids running around the tables. 

Bachi Burger doesn't taste terrible but is not worth another trip for me. It doesn't have any *wow* factor for the price.

Without Godzilla's review, I would totally not even known about this new restaurant called Koraku Ramen.  As I am not Japanese, not a subscriber to their phone tree or otherwise connected to the local Japanese social network scene.  So Hoodie, aka Godzilla X, thanks for bringing this new Japanese eatery to the attention of Yelp users.

Koraku Ramen, is a small chain restaurant from California (Little Tokyo and Sherman Oaks) that finally relocated their other Nevada location to Las Vegas.  So for those of you who have visited their other locations, you guys will probably be very familiar with their menu.  As for me, this is most likely the very first time I have ever been to one of their restaurants.  The LV branch is located in the same plaza as Krung Siam, Pho Little Saigon, Quiznos and Starbucks Coffee, on the SE corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View.  Currently there is no signage indicating the name (or it was not put out on my first visit on Tuesday around 6pm) and unless you happened to read a little Japanese and can kinda sorta maybe translate the little "We're Open" sign near their front door, it will be hard to guess what kind of food they might serve.

The restaurant interior is pretty simply decorated, with a giant poster of an classic Japanese movie hanging above what looks like the exterior seating area of a ramen-ya in Japan.  There are additional smaller, classic Japanese movie posters on the wall, but you will have to tilt your head back to see them. Which is cool, because I enjoy watching old Japanese movies, and it kind of reminded me of the decor of the ramen museum (Yokohama, Japan) I visited with a a group of friends a few years back.  

Seats in the booth are surprisingly comfortable, thanks to the cushy cushions for our tushies.  It is the next best thing for our arse, than a pricier Derriere Facial.  Such thoughtfulness is very much appreciated.

The menu features entrees served with rice (such as various curries, katsu, sweet & sour pork meatballs), fried rice and noodles, and 1/3 of the menu dedicated to their diverse line up of ramen.  

Here are my impressions of the food I tried on my two visits (dinner and lunch):

Shoyu Ramen:  Broth was mild but flavorful, not overly salty compared to most local ramen restaurants.  Chasu is nice, but could be even more tender and flavorful. Suggested add-ons:  Wakame, 3 slices of Chasu, and Ajitsuke Tamago (Japanese flavored soft boiled egg).  (3.5/5)

Pork Fried Rice:  Simply prepared. Tasty.  (3.5/5)

Gyoza:  Nothing extraordinary, but prepared well.  Has nice crispy base, and is a good appetizer.  Server recommended that we eat it with the spicy oil (Ra-Yu). (3.5/5)

Beef Curry on Rice:  Decent.  (3/5)

Spicy House Special Ramen (mild):  Pretty good portion. A lot of ingredients, even without any add-ons.  Leosdianto L. commented that it kind of reminded him of ramen we make at home, and I agree.  (3.5/5)

Nikudango (Sweet & Sour Pork Meatballs):  The sauce seems to be on the salty side, but I didn't try this with rice.  Reminded me of meatballs on a skewer, without the pineapple and the stick.  (3/5)

Service (early dinner): We were the only there, so service was excellent.  The evening crew seems to be staff by mostly Japanese mothers.  They were very friendly, attentive, and food came out of the kitchen fairly quickly. (4.5/5)

Service during the lunch rush (customers were overwhelmingly Japanese ex-pats, including local business owners and social gathering of house wives. When I closed my eyesand listen to their conversation, which I can't understand at all, it almost felt like I am in Japan without the cost of flight and hours on the plane) was friendly and attentive, but took the kitchen noticeably longer to serve up two bowls of ramen. (2.5/5)

Obviously the restaurant is very new, so it is super clean, and I expect that it will be maintained that way.

Parking. Not all that much (maybe 85) parking spaces in this tiny strip mall when it gets really busy. And there are no street parking in the immediate surrounding, being on the corner of two high traffic streets.  Big city dwellers will be used to that, for the rest be patient or walk a block or two.  (3/5)

Final thoughts. Koraku, once it has been opened for awhile and worked out most of the new restaurant kinks, it will be a respectable competition to other local Japanese restaurants that primarily serve ramen and curry.  Ramen combo deals (ramen + 1/2 order of fried rice or curry rice) is a good value for the Hungry-Man (R) and Hungry-Woman (patent registration pending).

P.S. It was great running into Mike C. and James I on my first visit.  Thanks for inviting me to join your party.  You guys are cool!

P.P.S.  Now accepting cash, credit and debit, gold and silver coins, and I.O.U.s from your pals.

3.5 stars.

I attempted Cafe Zupas on opening day and the line was so long out the door that I decided to wait. It was worth it! Cafe Zupas is kind of like Panera Bread, serving sandwiches, soups, salads and bakery stuff. The only thing different is Cafe Zupas is much fresher and tastier! 

When you first walk in they have large easy to read menu boards. You place your order telling them what you want on what, pay for your food and find a table where your food is brought out to you. They have a pretty good amount of seating offering tables as well booths. 

Sandwiches by themselves are $4.99 each, salads by themselves are $4.99 for the half size and $6.99 for the large size, soups are $3.99 for the half size and $5.99 for the large size.

There is a  "Try 2 Combo" priced at $7.99 where you can pick from two of the following:
- Whole Sandwich
- Half Soup
- Half Salad 

I ordered the "Honey Bacon Club" and "Summer Chicken Salad" from the try 2 combo. The portion size was great. The honey bacon club is a grilled panini with turkey, ham, bacon, tomatoes, muenster cheese and honey mustard. So good! I will order this one again for sure. The summer chicken salad has chicken, fresh strawberries, cashews, dried cranberries, grapes, mixed greens and strawberry vinaigrette dressing. The salad tasted to fresh and yummy! They have over a dozen salads to choose from so there is a nice variety to choose from each time. A really nice touch was the chocolate covered strawberry that came complimentary with my meal! Hubby got one with his too! Hubby ordered a "Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup" that was put of this world delicious! I ended up getting a spoon and sharing it with him it was just so good. The soup is whole heads of cauliflower blended together with cheddar and pepper jack cheese. Bacon was added for an additional 59 cents. Fresh bread also comes with the meal so it was nice to dip in the soup!

So I saw a dessert in the case that called my name. It was the "Sinful 7 Chocolate Cake" priced at $4.49 and I got it to-go. This cake is any true chocolate lovers dream come true! It lives up to it's name and is sinfully good.

The drink bar offers 16 different fountain drinks with free Italian Soda flavorings. If you have a device that needs some juice then you can take advantage if the recharge bar. They do offer catering, but if they offer online ordering I didn't see anything about it. There is a sign that says they do not take tips, but will gladly clean up your dishes (yep they use real dishes) and table when you are finished. The customer service was fantastic and the inside was very clean. I will be back!

***Fin (an upscale Chinese restaurant) at The Mirage is like a lot of other Las Vegas fine dining restaurants--overpriced, mediocre food***

Most Las Vegas (The Strip) restaurants are overpriced.  So if you are planning to eat at a nice restaurant in Vegas, you are probably not going to get your money's worth.  Still, the quality varies quite a bit.  Mesa Grill and Carnevino are both overpriced, but at least their food is good (at least on my visits).  There are other Vegas restaurants where you spend a lot and the food is bad (or mostly bad).  Fin is one of those restaurants.

Fin sits in The Mirage and has a contemporary decor that is nice though it does not really stand out.  The restaurant is very close to the casino, but it is still pretty quiet.

Fin is a Chinese restaurant, but it is probably a more Americanized interpretation (based on what we had here).  They were doing a $40 3-course special.  There was a good variety of starters to choose from while there was not much selection among the entrees or the desserts.  We all opted for the 3-course.  We added some a la carte dishes to share as well.

I started with the barbecued spare ribs.  They were sweet but not overly sweet.  The ribs could have used something else to give them a little more kick.  The meat did not have a fall-off-the-bone texture.  The meat was not exactly tough, but it could have been more tender.

I did not try the shrimp and scallop wraps, but they looked bland.  I tried the crispy shrimp toast that was served on a sweet and sour sauce.  That starter was decent.

For my entree, I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass that was served over a sweet garlic sauce.  The sea bass came with a side of steamed white rice.  The sea bass was fried (the menu said wok fried, but it seemed to be more deep fried).  The sea bass was quite greasy.  It was also incredibly fishy, which was a little odd because sea bass typically does not have one of the stronger fish tastes.  It could have been because it was not that fresh or simply that the fish flavor became more pronounced in how they fried it.

I really did not like the fish.  The greasiness and the taste made me feel a little queasy and I can eat pretty much anything.

From the a la carte menu, we had the General Tsao's Chicken, which was served with broccoli.  This dish was pretty good.  The chicken was juicy and tasty while the sauce was both sweet and with some good heat.

We also had Shrimp Lo Mein noodles, which were okay.  The noodles were fine and seasoned properly.  The shrimp was plump; however, they were not cooked long enough.

For dessert, I opted for the assorted sorbet, which had 3 flavors.  There was lychee and blood orange.  I cannot remember the other flavor.  Only the blood orange had a good flavor.  The other two flavors were bland.

The sorbet here was all ice.  It was like eating a really frozen slushie.

The other dessert option was a vanilla creme brulee and it was much better.  The vanilla custard was smooth, creamy and had a good vanilla flavor.  There was a nice caramelized shell.  The creme brulee was garnished with fresh berries.

They finished us off with a complimentary Baileys shot, which was good, and a fortune cookie.  The fortune cookie was pretty good.  It was a little thicker and more buttery than most fortune cookies I've had.  The messages seemed homemade especially since the paper appeared to be cut with scissors.

Service was not that good.  I have heard that strong customer service is not a high priority at Chinese restaurants (more emphasis is placed on flavors and value).  Maybe this place was trying to emulate that even though it seemed to be an Americanized Chinese restaurant.  The waiter seemed confused and he left the table when we were ordering to check up on another table.  Other servers seemed a little bit abrupt.

Still, once we put the order in, the food did come out at a good and organized pace.

Of the "nice" Las Vegas restaurants I have tried, Fin may be the worst one.  The General Tsao's Chicken and creme brulee were both good.  For the other dishes we had though, I think you would be able to get just as good food (if not better food) at one of the P.F. Chang's nearby (and at a much lower price).  There are many Vegas restaurants to avoid and Fin would definitely be among them.

The Mirage has complimentary parking (both valet and a parking structure).

I picked a good night to try Sabatino's. I called in to see if they had any specials going on and since it was Monday, The girl on the phone suggested the "Monday Special" to me. Mondays you can get a large cheese pizza (dine-in or carryout only) for $8.99 (regularly $12.99) plus tax and $1.50 for each additional topping. I thought that was a great price to see if I would even like it or not so I ordered a "Pepperoni Pizza" for pick up. The ordering process was easy and I appreciated the great customer service the girl taking the order gave and going over the specials with me.

When I arrived the place was full of people so I took this as a good sign. The inside isn't very big, but clean and cozy. I walked over to the cash register and was greeted by a nice young girl who rang me up and went over the weekly specials with me while my pizza was being boxed up. She also gave me a menu to take home and look over. It wasn't too cold of a night so I asked for some paper plates so hubby and I could eat our pizza at one of the many tables I noticed outside on the way in. Plates, pizza and now drinks in hand we headed outside.

When I first opened the pizza box it didn't look that appetizing, but we all know looks can be deceiving and that was the case this time. The sauce on the pizza is really what stood out to me. The sauce was just tasty! The cheese, crust and pepperoni were good. I had some that was left over for lunch the next day and it tasted just as good, even cold! I will be back to try other menu items!

Pizza sizes are medium (14"), large (16"), extra large (21") and Sicilian. 

They have over a dozen lunch specials, but here are a few:
-slice of cheese pizza and a side salad for $4.99
-slice of cheese pizza and 1 garlic knot slider for $5.99
-2 slices of cheese pizza for $5.99
-any regular sized hot or cold sandwich and fries for $8.99
-spaghetti with marinara and garlic bread for $4.99

All lunch specials include a drink! Lunch specials are currently from 11 am - 3 pm.

They offer delivery with a minimum $12 purchase and deliver pretty far out so call and check to see if they deliver to you.

If you are looking for an affordable family meal you might want to check out their "all you can eat anytime" deal. It costs $7.99 and includes cheese pizza, any pasta with marinara, and a side salad. I am assuming when I walked in and saw so many people, that they were taking advantage of this deal, but who knows. 

Tuesday and Wednesday if you buy any entree, large or extra large pizza at regular price, you get a 2nd of equal or lesser value for half off. Dine-in or carryout only.

After seeing the show Mystery Diner on the Food Network my wife and I made the decision to eat there on our upcoming trip to Las Vegas.  With three days to go before the vacation I purchased a Groupon that was 30 dollars for 60 dollars worth of food.  We made a reservation for 6:00 on Sunday because we wanted to eat early before we went out.  

We showed up about 10 minutes after 6 because the valet was a little behind at our hotel.  After pushing the button and waiting a minute or two the little window was opened and we were asked if we had a reservation.  I told him my name and he let us in.
  
After we got inside, the restaurant itself was extremely dark and the gentlemen who opened the door said we were late and we would be punished by having to wait longer.  "Whatever" we didn't care, we were just hungry.  It was kind of funny when we sat down and I looked at the menu on the back it said that reservations would be held for 15 minutes.
  
When we sat down we were given two menus with little lights attached to help us read them.  After a couple of minutes the server came and told us about the specials.  I was very interested in the meatball and shrimp special and my wife was going to get another shrimp dish that was on the menu.

After we told the server that we were using a Groupon she said we had to spend the full sixty dollars which we didn't think would be a problem.  We needed another minute to decide so the waitress left and came back a minute later.  

I was excited about my shrimp and meatball special especially after reading all the review on Yelp about how good their meatballs were.  

When the waitress returned the first thing she said was "sorry we are all out of shrimp," this meant I couldn't get my special and my wife couldn't get her selection.   Now how is it that you have a special and that consists of shrimp and you somehow run out of it by 6:15 at night.  

I think that since we were using a Groupon they didn't want to sell us the shrimp , I have no proof but I think it was bullshit.  

So we had to take another couple of minutes to look over the menu which had mostly dishes that contained shrimp.  I decided on spaghetti Alfredo with a meatball side, and my wife went with a clam dish in a red sauce.

When I the meal came my Spaghetti Alfredo had absolutely no flavor at all.  It was horrible.  The meatball on the other hand was really good.  My wife's clam dish was also very good and there was quite a bit of clams in the dish, which was exactly what she wanted.
  
After we finished and asked for our check the waitress came back and said we were a few dollars short of sixty and we were going to have to get something else.  My wife decided to get a dessert and she chose a tiramisu which ended up also being pretty good.  It tasted like they used real lady fingers and the whipped cream was also dynamite.

Overall our experience was not what we expected and we will not be going back here next time we were in Vegas.  The atmosphere was neat but I just can't fathom a restaurant that runs out of shrimp that is their special for the night by 6:15 in the evening.

When you combine the quality of ingredients, service and tremendous value, Soho is a place worth coming back to again and again.  Dinner for 4 came out to around $60 before tip and we got to try a nice variety of dishes.

It was easy to see and taste the high grade fish they used right off the bat in the "Seared Tuna Special" which included crispy shallots, sweet onion, micro greens and chili oil combined with super fresh nigiri cuts of maguro.  This was a terrific mix of flavors.  $11!  That's about 50% off the strip price.  I almost wished I didn't have to share it.  

I couldn't turn my back on the $3 (!!) Soho Tostadas and went with the tuna with Hawaiian poke sauce.  The tostada itself was made of taro and there were some delicious chunks of tuna on top mixed with cilantro and avocado cream.  Another great starter for sure.  The rock shrimp done tempura style was also nice portion for $7 and came with 3 unique sauces that I fail to remember the details of since my wife was seriously sweating the end of the Seahawks/Rams Monday night game due to some sports bets she had.  It was nice they had one TV up.

Hydro Bibb Black Cod for $5 was a total freakin tease that ensured I'll get a full order of miso marinated black cod the next time.  Even the smaller portioned cod were cooked really well and the combo of cool lettuce, crispy wontons and fish was kind of like a deluxe protein taco.  

Those all were excellent opening acts for what I was personally here for which was the short rib dish.  Ever since I saw that one picture of all those short ribs being grilled, I knew it was destiny!  It totally delivered.  The one rib was like something out the The Flintstones and tasted as good as it looked.  It was juicy and so tender that you could've just picked at it with chopsticks sans fork and knife.  

The chef and owner of Soho, John Chien Lee, stopped by our table to ask how things were and gave us a breakdown on the business.  We were still open to one more dish so I asked him for a recommendation.  He asked what we liked and we said salmon.  He asked if we wanted something cooked or raw and we said raw.  He said he'd make something special for us off the menu (YES!) and 10 minutes later brought over this delectable dish with 8 pieces of scallop wrapped with salmon topped with a little green, lemon and some other stuff I can't remember.  John whipped up this dish thinking it would be a great finish to the meal after the heaviness of the short rib and MAN was he right.  Then he told us it was on the house!  Thanks, John!!  I suck for not taking photos of anything.  

Las Vegas strip quality for locals!  Check it out.

OFFENSIVE. Tonight I had the most offensive and unprofessional experience at Yasu; I will never ever go back and I would only recommend it to someone I hate.

A group of four of us arrived at Yasu for our 6:30PM reservation and were seated promptly. We chatted for a while as water and other beverages were brought out and we went ahead and ordered the chef's choice menu so we could see the best of the best that Yasu had to offer. I've had great experiences with chef's choice at Yen, Pure, and a number of places in Boston so I expected the same from Yasu.

We entertain ourselves for a while until the first course arrives. 8 kumamoto oysters with uni and roe. Great play of textures and flavors. Kudos. Plates are removed and now we are getting excited, sashimi must be coming next and we are ready for it! The special fish selections of the day looked fantastic.

About 20 minutes goes by and we get our second course, red snapper carpaccio. it is seared and served at room temperature. One of my pieces had i don't know, tendon or something that made it unyielding to my chopsticks, and frankly, the temp of this dish was iffy. Flavors decent, but this is not the mass quantity of sashimi or nigiri I was anticipating.

The restaurant starts filling up. I see a massive plate of rolls come out of the kitchen and I nearly squeal with glee...until I watch it come to rest at another table.  This starts happening at a regular pace, and then I realize it's been a full 30 minutes since we've had anything at our table. A server comes by so I ask when the next dish will arrive. She mumbles something about the chef's choice taking a little longer than other orders and walks away.

Another cooked plate. A gross mushroom custard, a single shrimp on a skewer, an 1/8th of a cup of japanese eggplant in red miso sauce, a shard of spanish mackerel with some sort of puree, and two bits of jumbo clam. Everything tastes fine, but we are OVER the cooked plate situation.

Yet ANOTHER 30 minutes goes by. No server, nor manager comes to apologize for the delay. We watch literally dozens of delicious looking rolls, nigiri and sashimi fly out of the kitchen to other tables. We also watch 4 other couples come in after us, eat loads of food, and leave before us. We are still hungry.

Next course...Clams in miso broth. We are not offered spoons for the broth. We look at each other, thinking, "we ARE at a sushi restaurant, are we not?" but go ahead and eat the clams.  When the server comes by and asks how it is we tell her that we hope the next course will begin the actual SUSHI part of this dinner. She says yes, we are having live scallops.

About 25 more minutes pass and I'm starting to vibrate with righteous indignation. We are clearly paying a fucking fortune for this meal and we are receiving terrible treatment. The "live scallops" are boiling in miso broth over a mini-charcoal grill. They are so over-cooked they are RUBBERY. We hurry to get them off the coals and into our mouths before they are completely ruined.

Finally we tell the server that we are going to have to INSIST on getting some raw fish on the table. She says that's what's coming next. "Next" meaning ANOTHER 30 minutes later. We wait so long that finally we tell the server we are NOT going to continue with this absurdity and that we want the check. "oh your next course is ready!" "we don't want it. We want to leave" These are the exact words out of our mouths. Instead of bringing the check she brings the plates, telling us that Chef Yasu "wants us to have them." We all resist and the plates are set down anyway and finally our hunger makes us cave and we eat. We have now been at Yasu for TWO AND A HALF HOURS. We've had five courses that were not enough for two people, much less four.

Another 15 minutes pass before the check arrives. In that time, the manager has come out, not to rectify the situation, or apologize, but to call us ignorant and classless. He literally looks at us and accuses, "Have you ever had omakase before? It is always slower." We look at him and tell him in all of our sushi eating years we have never had an experience akin to this. We also point out that we were expecting SUSHI, as in RAW FISH. He tells us we told the server we would eat 'anything'. I asked him if the name of his restaurant was Yen SUSHI Bistro and he looks at me, puzzled. Then I see that we have been charged $20 for the last course that we TWICE tried to send back. I speak to the manager who tells me "if Yasu wants to charge you for it, he will charge you for it." I kid you not. All in all each course was mercilessly over-worked, only average and Yasu is on a major ego trip. Don't waste your time and money here.

I have this horrible affliction where I have to go to new restaurants when they open, I'm  very impatient. And I do this even though I know that newly opened restaurants inevitably have kinks to be worked out. I have been walking by Sens for months now and I've watched them put it together piece by piece and have been waiting for it to open. And what do you know, it opens the night of the Yelp party. Since I couldn't go to the opening, my husband and I decided to go on the second night. In reality this turned out much better because it was intimate and we were able to take a nice leisurely pace with the meal. Even the servers were saying it was better we came in when we did rather than for the opening since it was crazy and nobody really knew what was going on. 

I'm giving Sens 4 stars because yes, there are kinks to be worked out. I know that I will be there often given its proximity to my place and I fully anticipate giving it that 5th star once said kinks have been worked out. 

The Space- Think Asian diner/lounge. Yes, it is small, and the tables for two are not large enough to fit more than one plate at a time (slightly problematic for a place that serves small plates). There is a small lounge area off to the side which would make a really nice space for a semi private party. (They do take reservations, just call ahead). The bar and bar seating are definitely right in the main dining room. 

The Drinks- They sure know how to appeal to customers. We were offered complimentary shots of their infused drinks of blood orange sake (pass), pineapple sake (good), and lychee shochu (very good). My husband ordered a spicy mama, which had Thai chili infused shochu. My husband adores spicy drinks and this one really made him happy... reminded him exactly of the Thai chili martini that he gets at our favorite Thai place of all time in our hometown. 

The Food- There is nothing subtle about the food. Flavor is strong and very present. We chose four small plates, as we do in all small plate/tapas restaurants. We find four is always the perfect number. The first dish that arrived at the table was the clay pot lemongrass clams, which I would pass on in the future. The second dish was the volcano flamed beef which I would have to say was the best dish that we ordered, mainly because the flavors were the most subtle here- a little bit of peanut, a dash of mint. We did have 4 strips of steak and 2 lettuce wraps though, putting 2 strips of steak into one wrap was a bit much for me. The third dish was the seseme tofu which was very well cooked. Finally we finished with the ginger fish. When fish is cooked in a banana leaf it should absorb all the flavor from the cooking method, there was no reason for heaps of ginger to be placed on top of the fish. It was incredibly overwhelming. Our side of soba noodles were standard, even if they were delivered to our table after all of the other plates had arrived. They do not offer dessert so don't plan on having it there. 

The Service- All the servers were very friendly and engaging. They did feel the need to tell us how to eat every dish we ordered which I found annoying. I know there are a lot of people out there who have no clue but its best to ask us if we know how to cook our meat on the hot rock (sort of shabu shabu style). 

All in all I can see myself here often. The price is just right- the four small plates were more than enough to satisfy my husband and I for dinner and they came to $32 total. They do have kinks to be worked out and the food is not the best I've had but I am positive it will be part of our regular rotation.

***Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill showcases several good starters and entrees with generous portions, but the menu hardly changes; it is good option if you have never been, but if you have been to Mesa Grill, a return visit might leave you disappointed with the restaurant lacking the ambition to challenge itself and try new things (you cannot really blame the restaurant though given its popularity as well as customers' satisfaction with Mesa Grill's signature dishes)***

I have been to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill a few times and it consistently delivers tasty and well prepared food.  Unfortunately, the menu also just seems to never change.  That is the case with a lot of Las Vegas restaurants (for example, Picasso's tasting menu features two courses that have been there forever).  Still, almost the entire menu at Mesa Grill has remained the same since my first visit a long time ago.

The familiar menu has pros and cons.  What it has going for it is that a lot of the dishes are tried and true.  In addition, most guests come to Las Vegas rarely and would likely only dine at Mesa Grill once so the limited changes in the menu would not impact most customers.  On the other hand, the menu feels a tad dated; Mesa Grill does not really capitalize on the latest trends, progression in cooking techniques and popular protein cuts and produce.

I started with their tiger shrimp with roasted garlic corn tamale.  It is a popular dish and for good reason.  The tamale was hearty and had a tasty and moist cornbread-like texture.  The shrimp was good and plump and the cilantro sauce was also nice though I personally would have preferred it to be spicier.

For my entree, I went with their New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, which was served with a bourbon and ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter.  Unlike the shrimp and corn tamale, this entree was incredibly spicy.  The pork had a rub that had a lot of heat (the sauce had some heat too).  There was nothing really there to cut the heat so it was the kind of dish you get tired and bored of eating (and may struggle to finish).

The pork tenderloin (a very underappreciated cut) was cooked very nicely here.  The pork was tender and had a good amount of moisture, which is rare given the limited amount of fat with this cut.  The sweet potato tamale had a noticeable sweet potato flavor, but it lacked the more tamale-like texture of the corn tamale from my starter.

My dessert was a sticky chocolate cake.  It was very similar to Mesa Grill's previous sticky toffee pudding.  The cake had a similar glaze too--warm and a mix of salty and sweet.  The cake itself was not that great--a standard grocery store-like cake (similar ordinary chocolate flavor and similar texture as what you would get at a Ralphs or Vons).  There was also just too much cake especially given that the ice cream was an almost ridiculously small portion.

Service was fine.  The staff was pleasant and the food came out at a quick pace.  I felt the staff could have been more attentive.

Prices are actually not that bad at Mesa Grill.  Prices are very high, but that is common with most Las Vegas restaurants.  At least, they serve very substantial portions and the quality of ingredients is good.

The dining room is contemporary and showcases an open kitchen.  It is a very comfortable dining room.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is not completely closed in by glass as it may appear.  There are quite a few open areas where the large glass panes do not meet.  Given the proximity to the casino slot machines, cigarette smoke does waft in, which might create an undesirable dining experience if you are too close to the restaurant's outside wall.

There are definitely some good (and even great) things about Mesa Grill.  They have a few delicious items on their menu and most of the food is well prepared.  If you have never been to Mesa Grill, it is worth a visit; the restaurant also feels more worth the money than other celebrity chef backed restaurants in Las Vegas.  If you have been already though, Mesa Grill is not as exciting; the menu does not change much so it does kind of feel like the kitchen is really just going through the motions.

Mesa Grill is located in Caesars Palace.  Like most major hotels and casinos on The Strip, Caesars Palace offers both complimentary self and valet parking.

There are few things I can justify waiting in line for in Vegas. Good food is one of them. After a 45 minute wait in line, we definitely built up a big appetite. I was excited to try the Wynn buffet, especially after running into our friends who were on their way back from the Wynn. They managed to wake up at 9am on Sunday to head over there for brunch. I'm sorry, but I need at least 5 hours of sleep! One of the girls was eating a shiny red candied apple that looked so good. I couldn't believe she got it from the buffet. The Bellagio buffet didn't offer candied apples!

While waiting in line, cocktail waitresses actually came around with little bottles of water, which was greatly appreciated. It helped ease my growling stomach. This time, we decided to do the $30 regular brunch instead of the champagne or Bloody Mary brunch although it was only a few dollars more. 

The atrium was nicely lit but the only tables available for two was right by the entrance, so we decided to sit in the main dining area. The nice thing about this buffet was that each area had a sign above it, so it was easy to locate everything. Because when you're hungry and know what you want, you don't want to go around looking for it. 

I was really happy with the variety, including the Asian food selections, and the carving station had bacon as well as prime rib. My favorite, of course, was the dessert station which included a variety of homemade ice cream flavors and toppings. The chocolate chip bread pudding was amazing straight out of the oven. All other desserts were ok.

I was really impressed by our server, who was really attentive. Our friends had recommended that we have their hot chocolate, so I made sure to get a cup. It was so good, especially topped with whipped cream. 

The couple who we sat next to also raved about the Wynn buffet, telling us that they made it a point to dine there every time they were in town. They said their dinner buffet was better though, just as most buffets are. 

We walked out of there with Wynn buffet babies - we were so stuffed!

WING LOVERS, YOUR SEARCH FOR DELICIOUS WINGS ARE OVER!

Just like you I was reading the reviews, (mainly Tawni and Tien's), I was compelled to check this place out.

So as I park and get out of my car, I see a big sign that says this place is an internet cafe. Huh? Am I at the wrong place? Then I remembered from the reviews that the whole place is a food court. 

I walk up to the Wing King counter and Brian, the owner, was still getting ready. He sees me and politely asks if he can help me. I said excitedly "WINGS, IM HERE FOR THE WINGS!" So he takes my order and I sit down with my mouth watering to wait for my first bite. 

So while im waiting, I tell Brian Yelp is what brought me here. Never mind the fact that I dont mind going to new places to try out wings, if it wasnt for Yelp, you would not be reading this review.

Ok so for the wings. There are 40 flavors. Yes. 40. I had garlic parmesan and garlic hot. Ok, so I love garlic. Dont judge me! Especially if you are a vampire! The wings were a little bit bigger than your average size. Brian asked if I liked it extra crispy. Hell yes I do! So after I devoured my wings, things like hole in the wall and a 5 star review was already embedded in my head. From my last conversation with Brian, he is already coming up with even more sauces like mango slam and honey mustard slam. This guy works his butt off to keep you coming back and I for one am one of them!

I also ordered garlic parmesan fries and fried pickles. YES, I SAID FRIED PICKLES! Both were off the hook and Brian also let me sample some sweet chili glazed fries. OMG it was some of the best fries I have had in a long time. Please refer to the amazing pics on here and your mouth will be watering. I guarantee it!

As I was finishing up, Brian just happen to serve me a peach cobbler fresh out of the oven as a token of appreciation. DAMN! If I knew he was gonna do that, I wouldnt of ate so many wings! I could only finish half of it. 

Speaking of the peach cobbler, man this guy has some great desserts as well. I have tried the red velvet cake and the cookies. A special mention goes out to his rum cake as well. This is not a usual and its not on the menu but he made it for a customer one time so he decided to make two. One for the customer and one for whoever was lucky enough that day to be there when he put it out. Yes, I was there and boy oh boy it was awesome! If I ate any more I would need a cab to get home! Im sure he can specially make it for you if you let him know ahead of time so he can do his magic. That is the advantage of baking your own desserts! You can taste the freshness for sure! Oh, before I forget, Brian tells me he is in the process of bringing in Bluebelle Ice Cream. For those that dont know, that's only something that you only see on the east coast. So that alone should warrant a trip here.

If you are wondering, yes there is a really, really spicy hot wing challenge. The flavor is called Hell. No explanation necessary here. All I know is that I need to bring my friends that think they can pass this challenge here soon. Im also hoping we can make a Yelp event out of this. (Hi Misti! LOL)

So now after reading this you should be compelled to check this place out just like me. For complete info on their 40 flavors and other items, go to their website: www.wingkinglv.com

After how many failed attempts, I've finally crossed Bacchanal off my "to try" list in Vegas. This time around was sweeter. A self check-in kiosk met us as we tried getting in line which asked for a name and a cellphone number for them to reach us when it's time to pay and get seated. 30 minutes of trying our luck with the slot machines and my phone beeped saying it was time. 

Time to get our glutton on, that's what!

I always scope out the different stations categorized by cuisines before getting anything. I've finally learned to skip the bacon and other breakfast items I can eat at home so I started with some dim sum, roasted duck, and hot and sour soup. Can I say that was the best SIUMAI I've had just yet? It's remarkably tasty and perfect in texture from all aspects. Try it and thank me later! Meanwhile, the duck was great but the hot and sour soup could use less salt.

There's a long line for the seafood station so I went for the carving station for a nice slab of PRIME RIB (yuummmm!) and got me some of the best SCALLOPED POTATOES with MUSHROOMS from another part of the buffet. Wow! I got two pans of these buttery and flavorful carbs. Soooooo gooooood! I was told the LAMB CHOPS would be dished out around 3pm but by then I was already too full. Something to try next time, that's for sure. 

Offering a selection of soups, I had their tomato basil soup, very delish, and their mushroom with truffle soup, very salty! Next to it is their bread station and take heed when I say get their mini CORN BREAD muffins. Mmmhmmm!

I finally lined up for the seafood station to start burning what I ate. Mussels, clams, salmon, and seafood paella were the hot ones that I partook. I forgot to return for the shrimp and grits but those looked good. Cajun crawfish was also some of the offerings I decided to skip on due to the eating logistics of that crustacean. However, I certainly could not pass up on the oyster shooters, cocktail shrimps, KING CRAB LEGS, and their fresh succulent oysters. I recommend everything I tried in this station, however, I thought the paella was just alright and was on the salty side.

Ending this gluttonous meal on a sweet note, I will have to say that among all the beautiful looking pastries and sweets I've tried, what's really worth indulging in are their CREPES! They have a station where they make it fresh for you with your own choosing of toppings such as sugar, syrup, and fruits. The texture and flavor is spot on. It's so good I could easily eat it by itself! Or, you can pair with it any gelato of your liking with so many flavors to choose from, if it rocks your boat. 

If there's anything that didn't impress me other than a few over-seasoned items, it would sadly have to be the service rendered to us by our server. She was an older lady who was somehow kind and very accommodating to all the tables around us, but us. She seemed cold, always rushing without stopping to hear what we're requesting. When she was leaving, she said, "My shift is done, I want to go home now! You want anything else?" And it wasn't in a friendly way. She moved on to the next table and got all friendly to them endorsing the server who was to take care of them when she leaves. And this is why you should tip only after you've been served.   

Bottomline, we were all happy with what we consumed despite the price tag it came with ($50 for weekend champagne brunch). Because we got seated around 2pm, we were able to enjoy some dishes that were served only for dinner such as the fresh oysters. Either way, I guarantee you will leave this place satiated not just with the quantity of food you'll get but with a quality worth noting.

First off, I should mention that I'm not the biggest fan of savory items baked in a crust, ie empanadas, pot pies, etc.  But I couldn't ignore my fellow Yelpers checking into this less than a month old establishment over on the Eastside and the raving reviews.

Thanks to all the Yelpers who reviewed this before me, it definitely helped knowing exactly where they are located.  And where's that?  Commercial Center - Lotus of Siam and Green Door fame.  They are located next door to Komol, so keep driving and you'll find it there.  It doesn't look like much from the outside and I wasn't sure what to expect going in.  But we were pleasantly surprised to find the bar/counter seating with large and small tables around.  Because it was Superbowl Sunday, the place was empty so we had our pick of where to sit.  The waitress was so happy to see us come in since previous Sundays bring in a good lunch crowd.

We started off with the Oven Chips with added Garlic "Hand cut British style chips, cooked in the oven, with cracked pepper and sea salt." ($3.75)  It came out piping hot with ketchup on the side.  

The Husband was immediately intrigued by the soups and went for the Cream of Leek, Potato & Stilton (Cup $3.50). It came with homemade bread and butter.  We liked the blue cheese flavoring in the soup and the dense bread that accompanied it.

The Husband chose a Signature and Traditional Pasty - The Oggie "Steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga (swede) with a side of red wine gravy or ketchup." ($8.50)  He asked for a side of HP sauce too.  I got a little taste, but ultimately the Husband devoured all of it.  It's a pretty good size and for someone who drank most of the soup and finished the whole pasty, he was full!

I chose a Premium Pasty - the Chicken Tikka Masala (Red Curry) "Marinated chicken breast, tikka masala sauce, green peppers and potatoes.  With a side of mint-yogurt dressing or tahini." ($9.00)  I'm always skeptical about getting chicken breast because of how dry it can be.  This was not the case at all!  It was super moist, tons of flavor, and just really good.  I ate half knowing that I would be hurting if I even tried to finish the other half.  (I did eat the other half the next day and it was just as good! The toaster oven couldn't heat it fast enough for me!)  What I really liked about their pasty is the ratio of filling to crust.  There's a lot of delicious filling and the crust isn't excessive or dried out.  Ultimately, just really good.

I took a quick peek at their dessert menu and was bummed out that I was too full to order anything.  In retrospect, perhaps I would have split one pasty so I could order a dessert pasty too.  Nonetheless, we came back about four hours later and picked up a Strawberry Pavlova "Homemade crisp meringue shells, filled with freshly whipped cream, strawberries, kiwi fruit and grapes.  Finished with raspberry coule." ($6.00) to go.  It wasn't the most exciting to look at when you take it to go, but it was nice.  Next time I'm going for the Apple Caramel Pasty, Shirley Temple's Pudding, or Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding since those seem a bit more unique.

They offer a pretty extensive beer menu that had the Husband wishing he could sit awhile and have a drink.  Happy Hour is all day on Sundays from 3 pm to 6 pm and 10 pm to 12 am on the other days, which means $1 off beer and wine.  Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays also offer a special on the the certain alcoholic beverages.

Overall, we are liking the pasties that the Cornish Pasty Company are offering and are happy to see them in Vegas.  We only wish they weren't so far away on the other side of town from us!

Cost - FREE!

I am from Vegas, so like anyone else that is, or lived here long enough, you more than likely came here for a field trip with school, summer camp or simply with family and friends over the years. We are the ones who know what to expect from the Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden, so the overpriced chocolates and hot chocolate don't phase us because we know better not to "buy" into that part of the experience. For everyone else, you will learn your lesson once and always know better from there on out, or maybe not? I personally think that locals and tourists see Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden differently and both have specific reasons for going. This is why the prices of what's for sale and size of the tour will not cause me to give a lower rating.

This isn't a place you will be spending a lot of time, so don't plan for it to be an all day event. The chocolate factory and cactus garden are self-guided tours, so absolutely go at your own pace and take in all that you can or you might blink and it will be over. When I first walked into the chocolate factory, I noticed they have a small version of M&M's World now which surprises me they took this long to put that wall of M&M's in priced at $8.99 per pound. All I can figure is people want to say they had M&M's at the actual plant in Vegas and maybe that's why they pay it. If you just ask an employee they will let you pick a color and have a sample, which is free! They are pretty good about letting you try stuff if you just ask. Then you will know if it is something you would actually buy. 

The chocolate tour isn't long. You just walk down a hallway, one side having windows so you can see the equipment and if you come during the day, when the chocolate is being made, you will see it all going down in action. You can read stuff they have posted about how they make certain chocolates and what some of the machines do. At the end of the hallway is what most us came here for. FREE CHOCOLATE! There is usually a sweet lady waiting with free chocolate, but today she was not there! Oh no! Oh well lol. After the chocolate tour, you end up in the gift shop (of course!) where you can purchase a variety of sweet goodies they have to offer which includes a sugar-free section. I always walk through the gift shop to the exit since I don't buy anything and always stop at 7-11 before coming here to get hot chocolate. The hot chocolate here cost $4.95 and is smaller sized. 

The cactus garden is beautiful all year, but when it comes to Christmas time it is simply magical! There are over 300 species of plants and most of them are covered in lights. The lights are done a little different each year because of the growth of the plants, which makes for a bit of something new and not just the same ole thing every time. So many of the plants are covered in lights that I am one of those people that wonder every year "why didn't they fill in that spot?". I saw an article about the guy who is in charge of the lights each year and he mentioned that they have to know their limits. Some branches might break or a cactus might fall over he mentioned if lights were put on them. Makes sense! I will not wonder anymore! If you are lucky you might catch Santa and get to take a picture with him or if he isn't, you can still sit in his chair and take a picture. If you are one of those people (like me) who spends one night during the Christmas season going on a tour of the best decorated houses in town (you can get a current list each year of neighborhoods participating from local radio, paper and news sites) then you should add Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden to your list. It is just like stopping by to see a really nicely decorated house, but it's tons of colorfully and beautifully lit plants. It's free and a fun memory for the whole family!

Mr. K has covered most of the bases in his FTR, but there were a couple of things I thought I would add... 

The green chile beef is every bit as good as the red. We sampled both, as well as the beans (we choose Pima style which is the smashed version of beans rather than whole). All were very ample portions and exhibited crisp flavors. We all agreed that each could use a little salt, but after some discussion and a few sprinkles we came to the conclusion that actually it was preferable to season your own to your liking. Too often, we had all been served items which were over seasoned and quite frankly, there isn't much you can do once that has happened. This way, we each were able to make adjustments as desired. 

The bread itself seems a little more tender than TFBH. It also seemed a bit larger. That being said, we did each have the "full" version of the tacos, so the "half" may be more along the lines of what you might get elsewhere. Prices also seemed to be approximately $1.00 - 1.50 higher than TFBH, for the full portion. 

Some other items on the menu were both surprising and intriguing. I'm definitely going back for the Blue Corn Mush (I would have ordered it today, but I had already ordered my taco and was sure I couldn't handle both). I've never actually seen this on a menu off the reservation, so that in itself is enough to make me a repeat visitor. They have a few mutton and lamb selections that are obviously more on the authentic side. The mutton rib plate is served with sauteed squash and diced green chiles along with a navajo fry bread and drink ($11.99). The people at the next table had one of these and it was a large plate of food which they clearly enjoyed. There is a grilled lamb stir fry and also a lamb sandwich to round out the native selections. The sandwiches and burgers are a definite twist on the common offering. Sandwiches are served either a tortilla or fry bread and come with such toppings as eggs/bacon/onions/fire roasted green chiles, eggs/grilled spam, or two burger choices. Lastly there are the stews... yummo! They have the standard red and green, but also offer up a monthly special (this month was a very tasty vegetable style). Stews are served in two sizes, which is particularly nice if you are sharing items. 

The decor is certainly nothing that stands out; the chairs and tables are a mosh of options, but it is clean, and the staff is very friendly and patiently answered questions. They have one high chair for those of you with little ones. It is a small place, so if you go during peak hours expect to wait for a seat or take your food elsewhere to eat it, as it fills up quickly. 

The final distinction is that the SH is open on Sundays from 11:00 to 5:00. So if you are dying for some of that unbelievable fried dough on the morning after a long night out and had to previously wait until Monday, this could definitely be a saving grace. 

It's great to have another option and I truly hope that they will build a following in the Central Phoenix area.

I don't go out much or get to.. to say the least, but Sage.. saved me from every aspect of isolation of a homebody. Nestled in Aria Hotel, on the casino level by the front desk, adjacent from Julian Serrano. The array of deep, neon hues of purple awaits as you walk by the bar and into the main dining room. Three words to describe the ambiance: Sultry, sexy, and sooooothing. The bar and lounge area is quite inviting. I wouldn't mind at all having my meal there. 

My classy date and I were greeted by a kind, smiling lovely hostess named Alexis. I appreciate that so much, since the warm welcoming gives a great start to a wonderful dining experience.  We were then escorted in by the assistant manager and even pulled out the table and chair for us. My Oh my it just gets better and better!!! 

This was my first time trying a Signature Tasting Menu and honestly, I couldn't be more excited and thrilled to be able to share this experience with someone that loves great creations of food as much as I do. *Sigh I'm so happy... We tasted everything, shared everything, and that in itself meant Everything to me. 

The 1st Course: WAGYU BEEF TARTARE 
w/ Pickled Mustard Seeds. Crushed Caper Aioli , Slow Poached Egg, & Crispy Chocolate  -Extraordinary. By far the best beef tartare I ever had. The presentation itself was breathtaking and simply a work of art. Once you mix the egg with beef, the texture is ever so creamy. After my first bite, combining everything even the piece of thin, airy chocolate on top of a tasty olive oil infused, crispy brioche toast. I was singing.. Isn't she lovely... yeeeeees. All the ingredients, solid flavors were bursting with surprise in my mouth. It's nothing like I ever tasted before. If this is how it feels when you fall in love... I'm deeply in love.

We also went all out and substituted for yes..... the FOIE GRAS BRULEE!!! The soft, slightly salty brioche muffin contrast with the richness of the foie gras.. make whoopie by eating this. A very sensual dish. This hypnotizing flavor is all new to me..  dizzy in love again.. perhaps that was the champagne?! Reggie, our sommelier was informative and great. 

The 2nd Course: BACON- WRAPPED RABBIT      
English Pea Ravioli/Nueske Bacon, & Sweet Onion Sauce - Vibrant green colors.. gave away this freshness to the eyes. Beautiful dish. Every single element in this entree were magically paired to one another. It was as if you were eating your favorite song. Rabbit.. oh Rabbit.. I love you... Damn it.. I do. *hitting the dining table with my fists... gawd I want more and more of you. Addicted..

MAINE DAYBOAT SCALLOPS 
Braised Oxtail/Wild Mushrooms, & Salted Caramel Reduction -My favorite seafood.. Scallops! Cooked to perfection, tender, juicy, and oh so damn succulent. Forget day dreaming.. I fantasize about this dish. Can't get enough of it. I want this dish and I want it Bad. Delicious!

The 3rd Course:  We both ordered... 48 HOUR BEEF BELLY  
Shaved Purple Asparagus/Ramp-Sorrel Puree, & Pickled Ramps/Toasted Almond - Very rich and the depth of flavor is endless. Extremely tender and effortlessly melts in your mouth. This isn't for the faint of heart, but for a heart of gold due to the luxuriance of the meat. Happily satisfied :)

The 4th course: GIANDUJA PAVE 
Olive Oil Ice Cream, Hazelnut Crunch, & Basil Jam -Odd combination, but it was the best ending to such an amazing, memorable dinner. Again, everything I tasted was like a stimulating, new fairy tale story. It made such a profound impact of how I felt at that present moment and I could say... I could have fallin' in love. I never knew food could alter the way I feel and gosh darn it... I felt So beyond special. I never smiled so bright. My tummy was beaming! 

We were also offered complimentary breads in the beginning of sourdough or bacon bread. Bacon, by far was it for me and the whipped, creamy butter with sea salt .. yes another smile on this face. *sigh We also did the wine pairing with our Tasting :) I could cry out of joy from this experience. Pure bliss... Maybe since the flavors and simple ingredients were like traveling and exploring a new country.. a first for me. I was just stunned and even turned on by how delicious this restaurant was. The dim, cozy decor, and colors makes this ideal for a perfect Romantic date. I seriously couldn't be more pleased and happy. I love the fact my date has great taste in food and loves exploring as much as eating. Great company and great food can definitely lead to great things ;) The service was exceptional, top notch, 5 solid stars... The GM, Robert was ever so personable, funny, and kind by checking up on us throughout our evening. Our servers, runners, bussers, all worked smoothly together and made this one of the best dining experience I ever had in my entire life. Thank you. That being said.. This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas and I can't wait to go back.

I was meeting up with a friend, who raved about this place both times that she had been here. I had also seen decent reviews, so I was excited to finally try Honey Salt.. However, I am beyond disappointed. 

With the help of Yelp, earlier this morning, I made a reservation on the Yelp app for 1pm. I stated that there would be two adults, and one infant...and that a high chair was needed.

My friend got there before I did, and waited for our table. It was very busy. The hostess watched me struggle with my stroller, my daughter, and the door. She informed me that they don't allow strollers by the table....No duh, that's why I asked for a high chair with my reservation.... I parked the stroller in the corner by the bar, and met my friend at our table. 

She was the only one with a water. The waiter didn't bother bringing water for the table. I waited about ten minutes before our waiter asked me what I would like to drink. My friend ordered a pretty decent bloody mary, and I ordered a margarita....

My margarita came...in a martini glass? Honestly, it was one of the worst margarita's I have ever had. Of course, our waiter, Nick, was no where to be seen. About twenty minutes went by, and I felt compelled to do a complete 180 in my seat, to find him standing, and just kind of staring... He came over, took our order, and cleared the disgusting margarita.

We ordered the Turkey meatballs (10) to share, I had the burger (topped with an egg) $16, and my friend had the salmon (20).

Our waiter dropped off our food a little while later, and we didn't see him until after he cleared our plates...Meaning we were waiting for water. The meatballs were the best part for me...they should have an entree of those. The burger was just OK. overly salted ( I know your name is honey salt, but come on) and didn't have any flavor besides that. The french fries were good.

The french fries were good.....not really what I want to look back on and think about when our bill came to $70.....for lunch!

For dessert we ordered the pie in a bag, and opted for the salted caramel ice cream instead of the vanilla. The dessert was quite good. But like I said, french fries and good dessert really doesn't save from the blah food, and terrible service. 

The table next to us had a blonde waitress, who really seemed to care about the ladies next to us. She has around to them about 4 to 1 (ratio) of our waiter.

The check comes in a guest book, I felt free to let them know that the service was bad, and to look forward to my Yelp review.... Walking out, the hostess was gracious enough to stop texting on her iPhone to say good bye...

It's funny how their menu talks about "getting comfortable", when they really don't make you feel warm, welcome or comfortable.

I don't think I'll be back.

This is not a review but a love letter.  There are so many reasons to love centurion I have a hard time knowing where to start, so I guess I will just start at the beginning.  THEY HAVE A LIQUOR LICENSE AND WINE SELECTION WITH A SELECTION OF BEERS AND LIQUORS COMING SOON.

We walk up to a small restaurant within walking distance of the Central and Roosevelt Lightrail stop.  There are about 4 or 5 tables on the patio and about 10 tables inside with the tiniest open kitchen you have ever seen.  Seriously, the guy has 4 burners and a brick oven.  Not a whole lot to work with if you're a chef in my opinion.  The restaurant has a good neighborhood kind of feel.  It's not a kitschy overly modern place. Now I'll get to the best part of the restaurant, the food. 

We started with a Baked Brie with raspberry jam in a phylo pastry.  It was insanely inexpensive as an app that two could share for 7 bucks and the grapes that came with it were seriously some of the tastiest grapes I've ever had.  The Brie was had a nice strong flavor and was extremely tasty.  

Next I had the Taglioni with pulled duck, artichoke hearts, and leeks in garlic cream sauce.  The price for entre was 14 bucks and was an insane for the amount and quality food you get.   The flavors were incredible and here is my one wish for the meal.  I would have loved a nice thick noodle to hold up to the sauce a bit better.  The Taglioni is tasty and does well but I think something like a Pappardelle would have held up a bit better texturally.  The duck was cooked extremely well and was insanely tasty and the sauce was ridiculously good.  When I say ridiculously good, I mean ridiculously good.  I could sit with large bowls of that sauce and some bread and sop it up for a day and a half.  When our server Sean checked up on us I mentioned how I loved him for bringing me some crispy dusk skin with the meal and he comes back with even more.  This is about the point I fell in love with this restaurant.

Tiffany B had the Salami and Artichoke Pizza and I cannot describe how tasty it was.  This is my new pizza place hands down.  Forget Cibo, forget Pizzeria Bianco, go to Centurion for pizza.  They make pizza exactly like I like it.  The dough was delicious, not too salty like most doughs, and was airy and fluffy.  The sauce was sweet without being too sweet and all around flavorful.  It is extremely reasonably priced at 13 bucks for the pizza which makes me love the place even more.  

At this point we are late for our movie and are so in love with this place that a second bottle of wine and some dessert are in order.  The chef Eric Osbourn comes out and talks to us for a while and lets us know a bit about himself and the restaurant.  His goal is to bring gourmet foods in at an affordable price.  You can tell in talking to him that he serves things that he personally loves and that he loves food.  You don't get the feeling of a menu put together to maximize profit or to impress but to be as tasty as possible.  He is C.I.A. trained primarily as a pastry chef.  Ok seriously?  The rest of the food was so good and his specialty is desserts?  Sign me up.  After we talk to him for a while I tell him bring out whichever desserts we should have and a second bottle of wine.  He selects a sparkling wine for us and tells us he will be bringing out a trio of desserts for us to try.  

The first is a freshly baked Marscapone and Strawberry Phylo Pastry with Chocolate and Chili "Soup".  I am not a fan of chocolate but when the pastry was gone and there was chocolate left I started looking around the table for more things to dip in it.  The chilies were not overpowering at all but left a nice hint of spice.  Next we had a lemon sorbet, and a quince grenata with a raspberry puree, and a blueberry puree.  Both were good but the quince grenata with the blueberry puree was delicious beyond words.  Finally we had a chocolate flourless torte with, crme fresh, raspberry puree, and candied wine soaked quince.  The candied quince were sooo good.  I could eat a bowl of them with some crme fresh and be happy but add the chocolate torte and I was even happier.  

The entire meal (appetizer, pasta, pizza, 3 full desserts, and 2 bottles of wine) came in at a hundred bucks.  I got fast attentive service, from both Sean, who was an incredibly knowledgeable server, and Eric Osbourn, who is a fantastic chef.  I cannot recommend this place highly enough.   This will absolutely be a regular haunt for me as it is by far the best restaurant value I have found in Phoenix.  The restaurant is open til 2 on the weekends which will also make this a late night post boozin it up spot.

Carnevino is Mario Batali's high-end steakhouse in Las Vegas (located in The Palazzo).  With steakhouses, the first thing people want to know is if the steak is good.  The steak here was very good (some of the best I've had).  Of course, a lot of these high-end steakhouses put out good quality steaks that are cooked to the appropriate temperature.  They tend to struggle with the other menu items though--the starters, sides and desserts.  Unfortunately, Carnevino is too similar to other steakhouses in that respect.

Carnevino is huge and boisterous.  They keep the restaurant pretty dark.  The decor is nice and the seating is comfortable, but the overall look and design of the restaurant is nothing new (or impactful).  They do feature a large bronze bull statue at the front.

The complimentary bread included cheese puffs that were good.  I cannot remember what other bread was served, but it was at least okay.

I started with the big eye tuna crudo, which featured tuna sashimi dressed in a vinaigrette with a side of radish and cucumber salad.  The tuna was fresh and good though it was a very small portion.  Some of it was a little over salted.  The radish and cucumber salad was fresh and crisp.

For my pasta, I had the fruit di mare, which featured spaghetti with a tomato sauce, lobster, squid, shrimp, and clams.  The seafood was a generous portion.  I liked the lobster and the shrimp.  The squid was fine.  The clams were just okay; I've had better.  The clams here were not as meaty and tender as I would have liked.  There was a little bit of grit and sand in some of the shellfish though.

The tomato sauce had a little bit of heat to it, but it was quite thin, watery and bland.  The waiter said that all of their pastas were housemade, but the spaghetti did not taste like housemade spaghetti.  Maybe it was, but I have had better housemade spaghetti at other restaurants.

I tried my friend's pappardelle dish, which was served with mushrooms.  We both agreed that her pasta was a little bland.  The texture of the pasta was good though.  I was not a fan of the pastas at Batali's Osteria Mozza (though the pastas there were not bland but salty).

The main course was good though.  I had a bone-in New York Strip and it had a great char to it.  The inside was nicely medium rare.  It was juicy, flavorful and tender (which is hard to do with a New York Strip because it is lean).

They also offer a dry aged bone-in ribeye for two people.  This ribeye gives new meaning to the word bone-in (check the photos on Yelp to see what I mean).  The ribeye was huge and they carve it tableside.  The ribeye was very good--great marbling, juicy, flavorful, and tender (one of the best steaks I've had).

I also sampled a little bit of the filet portion from the porterhouse.  This was my least favorite of the steaks.  Maybe the filet was too thick because the center of it was kind of bland.

They offer sauces on the side and I tried their wine reduction (Barolo Ristretto), which was oily and had no flavor.

I did not get to try many of the sides, but I did try their creamy mashed potatoes (mixed with mascarpone and a poached egg).  The mashed potatoes were very creamy and flavorful.  The other sides sounded good.

It was my friend's birthday so Carnevino made a big chocolate cake for the occasion.  The chocolate cake was rich and fudgy, but it was just okay.  We also had some of their gelato on the side (chocolate, vanilla and coffee).  The gelato was a little icy and lacked the creamy, smooth texture that is common with gelato.  The flavors were not that prominent as well.

Service was good.  Food came out at a good pace.  We were a large party, but they had a large and attentive staff supporting us.  Before ordering at most restaurants, I engage the server to understand what are the most popular dishes and how are they prepared.  More often than not, I let the server direct me in what to order especially if I sense the server is passionate about the food.  Here though, the waiter was a little pushy.  As soon as we sat down, he was directing us on what to order, how much we need to order and so forth.  Service was still good, but the waiter was just not for me.

Carnevino's meat was very good and unlike several Las Vegas restaurants I've dined at, I walked away satisfied.  Prices here (like other Vegas restaurants) were pretty steep, but at least I felt that the main food here (steak) would match up well with some of the other very good steak places I've tried, which makes Carnevino a good Las Vegas option for steak lovers.

By the way, my friends said they saw Mario Batali (he was eating with John Cusack near the bar).

The Palazzo has complimentary valet parking.  I would imagine like other major casinos that they have complimentary self-parking as well.

To be fair, I'll separate this review into 2 parts: 1 about the food and 2 about the horrendous service.

(((1))) FOOD: 3/5 stars
$24 per person for the weekday (no seafood) dinner buffet - certainly a better price than the buffets on the strip. The food here was average. I was only able to find a handful of solid items that I could enjoy. Would I come back? Slight chance, but ONLY for the the sashimi salad and the few items I have listed below:

- Salmon sashimi salad - This was the star of the entire dinner. The salmon was extremely buttery, sweet, moist, and fresh. I could just eat this all night and be happy. 
- American beef BBQ ribs - The ribs were meaty, not too dry, and the BBQ sauce was sweet and tangy. It satisfied my rib craving just fine.
- Chinese style BBQ pork ribs - The Chinese BBQ sauce was sweet and not too salty. The ribs were moist, meaty, and didn't have too much fat, which made it enjoyable. 
- Kalbi (Korean BBQ beef ribs) - I enjoyed the flavorful and bold Korean sweet and salty marinade. Some of the meat was tender, but there were also many pieces that were charred to a crispy black.
- The creme brle was perfectly custardy. 
- The luscious flan had a beautiful smooth texture and not overly sweet.
- I also enjoyed being able to order Americano and expresso from the dessert bar. They were both light (watery) and not robust, but they were packed with enough caffeine to fight off the food coma.  

The rest of the food and desserts offered at the buffet were either dried out, overcooked, bland, mushy, or tasted like dishwater. I was also really looking forward to the oysters and crab legs that I've seen in pictures, but alas I didn't see them being offered last night - Note: the seafood buffet is more expensive ($40) and it's only offered Fri-Sat-Sun. 

(((2))) SERVICE: 0/5 stars
The servers here are shockingly rude and ruined my experience at this buffet and my appetite. 

When we arrived, the ladies working the front registers advised us that their buffet line will be closing at 9 pm tonight and that's also when the food will stop being refreshed. It was about 7:50 pm, so that wasn't a problem to us - from our understanding, we wouldn't be able to grab anymore food after 9, but we would still be able to finish our meal even after the buffet line was closed. Well, that's typically the case at most buffets...

Apparently that's not the case here. What ended up happening was, we grabbed our food, ate, and when 9 pm rolled up, our server abruptly came up to us and said, "you have to leave now, we're closed." Her tone of voice was extremely coarse and unprofessional. Mind you, we still had a plate full of food in front of us and we were in the middle of eating (chewing) when she rudely addressed us. I had an obvious look of confusion written all over my face and she then quickly said, "I'll give you up to 5 minutes, then you must leave" --- Wow, who talks like that? I was in utter shock that our server was so extremely abrasive. We were just trying to enjoy the rest of our dinner and didn't know that they wanted us out of the restaurant by 9 pm - no one told us that! How does "buffet line closes at 9" = "you must get out by 9"?!

We quickly tried to finish chewing so we can get the heck out of there and then another gentleman rushed up to us and yelled at us, "just to let you know, you have less than 2 minutes to leave." ---seriously? You can't even approach us with kindness and professionalism? I was beyond infuriated at that point and also still so confused as to how the staff here carried themselves with such poor etiquette. 

With hindsight, I understand that it was major negligent miscommunication between the staff and my party, but even so, that's never an appropriate reason to mistreat your guests or speak to them like they are livestock. 

Also, to rub a pound of salt into our wounds - I didn't even know we could have unlimited beer/wine during our buffet - none of the servers or staff informed us. I just ordered a coke and our waitress never even came back to refill it! My glass was empty 15 minutes into eating there and I had to get up and go look for her and ask her if I may get a refill. Of course she forgot to refill it, so I had to get another server to refill it for me. Finally, my server waltzes up with my refilled coke. It was an extremely annoying dinner to say the least.

***This was my first visit to a Las Vegas buffet in over 5 years; I had the breakfast buffet at Wicked Spoon (in The Cosmopolitan) and the quality varied with some items being surprisingly good while the majority of food was in the decent to mediocre range (a few of the items were below average)***

In terms of Las Vegas buffets, I've only been to the Bellagio Buffet and that was just for breakfast.  Wicked Spoon in The Cosmopolitan became my second trip to a Vegas buffet (also for breakfast).  This trip though yielded both breakfast and lunch and dinner items (I do not remember the Bellagio Buffet offering many dinner items at breakfast, but that was a long time ago).

There were a wide variety of lunch and dinner items.  There were several stations I did not try like the sushi and Chinese food.  I did try some more of their New American offerings though.  All of it was kind of just okay.  The crispy chicken wings were crunchy and crispy and well seasoned, but they had been sitting around too long.  The duck confit ravioli was not bad, but it was really kind of a just okay flavor--heavy and not that interesting of a cream sauce.  The beef short rib was decent--moist and tender.  The tri-tip (sliced to order) was just okay.

In terms of breakfast, their selection was impressive.  They had several breakfast pastries, breads and muffins available.  Some looked better than others.  The pain au chocolat was not bad for a breakfast buffet.

There was also a good number of cold items from fresh fruit to several salads.  For more heartier breakfast items, Wicked Spoon had about every dish you would expect to find at one of those all-day breakfast places.  There were many egg dishes (as well as eggs made to order), pancakes, French toast, and several breakfast meat offerings.

The breakfast meats stood out the most.  There were two kinds of bacon.  The first was crispy strips of bacon (piled up in a traditional buffet serving dish).  For breakfast buffet bacon, this was pretty good.  The bacon was crispy but not burnt and there was a decent meaty chew.  There was also a smoked bacon that they sliced to order, which had a meatier and more tender feel to it (closer to braised pork belly than traditional breakfast bacon).

The chicken apple sausage was good--moist and nicely seasoned with a decent amount of spice.

The French toast was also good--light and fluffy (with a good flavor).  The pancakes were fine.

The eggs Benedict was just okay.  The hollandaise sauce was too thick and the meat was thickly shaved ham as opposed to Canadian bacon.  I also tried an omelet made to order and it was not that good.  It was not that fluffy and the cheese was not melted at all.

In addition to their many savory offerings at breakfast, Wicked Spoon also offers a wide variety of desserts.  There were cakes, housemade marshmallows, chocolate molten cakes (though not that molten), and gelato.  The flavors of the gelato were very good--a nice caramel and a distinct pistachio flavor.  The gelato was creamy and smooth but a tad too soft.

Service was okay.  The staff was quick with getting drink orders in, but they were kind of slow in taking away plates.

The price was right around $25.  I think that is about what you would expect to pay at breakfast buffets at similar Las Vegas hotels.

The dining room is comfortable enough though I remember the Bellagio Buffet having more booth seating.

The Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon Buffet offers a great variety of food for breakfast.  Some of their offerings (like their breakfast meats) are quite good, but most items fall in the just okay or maybe slightly below average range.  Still, if you like buffets because of the great amount of choice they offer, Wicked Spoon seems like a good option.

I know The Cosmopolitan offers free valet parking.  I think this hotel also offers free self parking.

I have been back several times before writing this review update just to make sure all the inconsistency that I have been experiencing is now the way of Bagel Cafe and not just an off day they were having. I'm prepared for the loyal fixtures to be upset, but if you really have been eating here since it opened then you know it's not the same. I first started eating here at Bagel Cafe (I was a teenager) after it opened. It was worth the long wait to get a table as the food was spot on excellent. Sure we all know the best breakfast in town is at the Omelet House on Charleston, but this place definitely came close behind at one point. In the last 6 months I have experienced meals here at Bagel Cafe that were just not worth the money or wait for what you got. They don't even use Boar's Head deli meats anymore! WTH?!?!?!? They use some brand I have never heard of. The taste and quality of the deli meat just isn't the same as it used to be. They claim the bagels are made fresh daily yet they are rock hard. I have never liked the bagels here, but if it's in your name.... live up to it!

As you can tell from my previous review and pictures, I really used to like this place. Consistency is a major issue. The sandwiches used to be made with Boar's Head deli meat and was piled high between the bread of your choice and a real winner. Now you get some other brand of meat just bunched up in a ball between 2 dry pieces of bread. I can do that at home! Then there is breakfast. I usually order breakfast here. The last 3 times the coffee has tasted bitter and nasty. Getting a refill was a major chore as well. I noticed the servers didn't have name tags on my last visit or I would give a proper shout-out to the waitress who has messed up my order lately and has terrible customer service. I ordered "One Egg any style W/Bacon" priced at $8.95 and asked for eggs to be scrambled with shredded cheddar cheese on top. Such a simple breakfast right? Apparently not For Bagel Cafe. The breakfast also came with a bagel of my choice and breakfast potatoes. When my food arrived I noticed there was a slice of cheddar cheese on my eggs. UGH! If you don't have shredded cheese just let the customer know so they can maybe make another choice. I would have had the egg over medium or easy to dunk my bacon in if I had known. The "Asiago" bagel I had was so tough and hard!  I was with another yelper one of my last visits and showed him how I was able to bang the bagel on the table and it just broke in pieces.  The bacon was terrible. From the picture it looks heavenly, but let me tell you it was rock hard and seemed like it was honestly pulled from the fridge or something. When my meal arrived the bacon was missing, so I informed our waitress and she replies to me "oh did you want bacon?" to which I'm like HELL YES why would I have ordered a breakfast that comes with it if I didn't want it? She then brings me the cold/hard bacon and when the receipt comes she charged me $3.50 for a side of bacon. Seriously? It was supposed to come with the breakfast I ordered. She made me feel like I had done something wrong when she actually is a very lousy waitress. The potatoes I had were the only thing edible on the plate and even those aren't the same potatoes as they have had in the past. With this place not being consistent and having waitresses who can't do their job right, I'm going to  BabyStacks Cafe and Omelet House from now on for breakfast and will make the drive to Henderson to eat at Weiss.

I had my hopes up for this place. Walking in it seemed like a fun atmosphere, but quickly it felt like more of a tourist attraction. From the start our server was trying to get us to buy raffle tickets. It didn't stop there. When she would check on us, she was saying things like "if you like the taste of that, we sell it in our gift shop" and at the end of the meal even asked if she could walk with us to the gift shop (we told her that we didn't want to go earlier and thanked her for the info) to pick somethings out so she could meet her goal since she was in the lead for some sort of competition with the other employees for work. To put people on the spot so many times is rude. Ask once and if the customer is interested they will tell you! 

What encouraged us to come here was because I have family here in town that is hosting an exchange student from Germany and I thought she would not only like this place, but maybe feel a bit of home. We sat at nice long table that is shared with the other customers. I don't personally like that, but that's the theme here so it was fine. There was live music being played which was cool. 

Priced at $19.99 we started out with the "Sausage Tower" at the suggestion of our server. She said it was a "hidden" menu item since it isn't on the menu and it would give us a good taste of the different sausages they have. Sounded good to me! When it arrived, it looked like a tower of heaven. There were 3 dishes. 1 dish had chicken bratwurst, pork sausage and veal bratwurst on a bed of sauerkraut. The 2nd dish had krainer, grilled weisswurst and a frankfurter with potato salad. The 3rd dish had 2 fresh baked pretzels with 2 types of dipping sauces. Of all the sausages I only really liked the taste of a couple of them, so it was nice to be able to sample it all instead of just ordering a certain sausage dish that I might have had a type of sausage in it that I wasn't to find of. The pretzels were pretty good and the mustard sauces had good flavor. For my meal I had priced at $4.95 a "House Salad" and priced at $14.95 the "Grillhendl" which is a chicken dish. The salad was average, but the chicken dish was above average. The chicken was roasted and stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions. The chicken was crispy and had a good flavor. It also came with a side of potato salad that was decent. 

I certainly didn't leave hungry! I didn't leave feeling like I would come back though either. The vibe inside just screamed "gimmick" and "tourist attraction here" which our guest from Germany agreed. The server was just too pushy about trying to get us to buy different things. My husbands meal was a joke especially for the price, so I lucked out with the chicken dish I ordered. I'm glad I experienced Hofbruhaus at least once.

First of all, many thanks to the awesome Deb L. and her fun-loving hubby Michael, for hosting tonight's UYE at this elegant restaurant!  (It's definitely "date night" material-- and not only for romantic couples; I spotted a father and daughter, dressed to the nines, and they looked like they were having a great time!)  Nine of us were in attendance, and I'd say that the dinner was a huge success!  This was my first visit, and while I had to leave shortly after the food came out, I felt sad leaving this very lively group-- it was great to have caught up w/ Deb, Mike, and Heather C., and so nice to have made new acquaintances!  I hadn't even left the building yet, and I already knew I was coming back!  (Heather, we're definitely doing breakfast SOON!)

While waiting for other Yelpers to arrive, I'd inquired about whether HB only served wines, since that was the only drink menu that was presented to us, but no, our friendly and very helpful server Chelsea said that HB had a full bar, and that she would return to let us know what specialty cocktails they had to serve that evening.  Besides their house red sangria ($9?), HB was also offering a Blackberry mojito ($9) and a St. Germain elderflower margarita ($11).  While both sounded delicious, I decided to go w/ the mojito since I have a large bottle of the elderflower liquor ($32!) sitting in my fridge back home (I was inspired to buy after having some elderflower champagne flutes at Chandler's Cork!)  Oh. My. God!  If you like berries, you MUST try this mojito!  It was so full of muddled whole blackberries, you'd think it was puree, and it wasn't overly sweet-- I felt like I was having quite a nutritious beverage!  I hardly tasted the alcohol...  I very much wanted to order another one, but I knew I had to leave early.  I cannot wait to come back for happy hour!  :D

By the time everyone showed up and had a chance to make introductions and make really interesting chit-chat (again, Deb and Mike were great hosts!), we were ready to order and eat!  I kid you not, everyone's selections looked amazing!  I'm sure we'll be reading about their selections soon enough, so let me tell you about mine...

I was curious about the gouda mac 'n cheese from the very moment I read about it on Deb's prior review, so I knew to order these.  How fortunate to see that the Thai BBQ baby back ribs came w/ a side of it, as well as a green apple slaw.  I concede that the mac 'n cheese was good, but I think it would've been better w/ more cheese and slightly more crunchy breadcrumbs.  The sour apple slaw provided a nice crunch and just enough sweet-sour to counteract the spiciness of the baby back ribs.  Ohhh... those tender ribs!  The BBQ sauce was thick, sticky, sweet, yet had a great kick!  (I didn't find it too spicy, but others might... you've been warned!)  It was very fortunate for Mom that I had to leave the party so soon, or else she would not have had the chance to try the leftovers; there wouldn't have been any to take home!  (And yes, she's already eaten the rest of the meal!)

Afterwards, I stopped at the adjoining market to take home a slice of Chocolate-peanut butter banana bread cake ($5), a Strawberry-blackberry handpie ($5), and a goat cheese-chive potato cake ($3).  (So many of the others had a potato cake as a side to their entree, and I was so envious-- they looked great on the plates, and everyone said they were delicious, and I completely agree w/ them!)  Loved the potato cake's great textures- the caramelized outer crust had enough crunch, but quickly yielded to reveal the buttery potato delight, w/ goat cheese crumbles all-throughout inside-- not at all greasy, and I loved the rich and creamy consistency that the goat cheese gave to the potato cake!  I will have to buy some of these to take home on every visit from now on!  FYI, the desserts were perfect, as well!  The crust on the handpie tasted almost like shortbread, the sugared top of the crust was exquisitely crisped, and the fresh berry filling also incorporated a citrus-y element-- my guess is orange peel/bergarmot oil essence.  The banana bread cake was so moist, had beautiful texture (see pics),  not too sweet, and packed full of banana goodness... Loved the peanut butter layer under the chocolate ganache "icing" (no powdered sugar used in their icings here!).  The cake also had peanut butter drizzle all over the top.  It's a pretty cake, and I wouldn't hesitate to order a whole one to-go...  

Hey, Heather-- you free this weekend??

This is the second time a club in a Wynn property has embarrassed me in front of friends/colleagues. 

Let me preface this review by saying that I know Labor Day Weekend in Las Vegas is nuts. I've been partying in Vegas for the better part of five years now; it's the second most expensive/busy weekend of the year or something to that effect.

That said, I booked a cabana here fully prepared to spend a lot of money. And I am the EASIEST person to help. No wacky requests, nothing. Just take my money and give me what I'm told I'm getting. I showed up with a bunch of my friends and we had a minimum spend of $2k (which is realistically more like $3k), which I thought was totally reasonable for the cabana that particular night. It was no problem, but the holier than thou attitude that I got from some of the staff was extremely off-putting. Yes, I know you're busy. Yes, I know you're stressed. But if I'm buying bottles and bottles at a 1000% markup... be a little nicer. Smile. Take five minutes to make sure we're all set. Don't ignore me when I need help. You're supposed to be bending over backwards for me, you're a VIP host. Customer service goes a long way. I'm not going to name any names in my review, but I am going to be honest.

So we waited in line for about 10 minutes before getting in. Totally standard, no problem. But, when we got in, the cabana I was promised was mysteriously unavailable. Instead, I was offered a daybed. I politely refused and asked to speak with a manager. This was embarrassing, since I was entertaining friends from out of town, and had kind of been hyping up the night since Surrender is the hot spot.

The manager came by, and I ended up having to kick him $200 to "upgrade" me to what I was promised originally. This is after I had already tipped out over $400 to the hosts and door staff. It's not like I didn't take care of my people; this wasn't my first rodeo. Tangentially, I know I'm breaking all the rules by mentioning that I tipped out, but fuck it. I'm pissed. I had been pre-authed the night before for the cabana, I had confirmed it twice, and then I got bait-and-switched. Not happy, Surrender. If you wanted to sell the cabana for a higher price to someone else, fucking tell me before I show up with a group, and don't you dare try to pull a bait and switch.

Anyway, we finally get up to the cabana and got our drinks a full hour after we arrived at the door. The host I had booked the table through passed me off to someone else, and (thankfully) he was fantastic, friendly, thorough. Our waitress was sort of around, our bussers friendly, our security fine. No above and beyond; if anything, the service was worse than I expected. The club itself was gorgeous and the night was beautiful, which is the only reason that this place isn't getting one star. Seriously, it was ridiculous. I'd give the club and the ambiance 5 stars, but the staff was less than stellar that night. In a city of hospitality, I was not impressed.

MIdway through the night, I had two friends get in touch with me to join the party. No problem, right? Wrong. My hosts told them my party was full, they had to wait in line, pay a $75 cover. It's a little absurd, considering we were going to purchase two more bottles when they came in, and they were just given a flat out no when they asked to join our party. I stepped outside to speak with a host - I wasn't even drunk - and I was given the cold shoulder. I produced another $100, he palmed it,  still didn't help my friends. Laughing.

All I have to say is, if Surrender treats the people who spend a ton of money this way, I can't even imagine coming here without table reservations. I learned an expensive lesson at the Encore, and this isn't the first time the Wynn staff has treated me like a second class citizen (see my XS review). Is my money different or something?

Overall, less than pleased. I will say this, though; if I ever return, I'd be more apt to return during the day than the night, and it'll be on someone else's dime so I don't have to deal with anybody.

7pm... Wow He is right on time ... great.... 

All dressed up for once in my life... Stilettos, LBD, and makeup... 
its new for me ... I'm usually in jeans on a date :P 

walks me to the car... unlocks the door and walks around... doesn't even bother to open my door while I'm already there? O..K... 

As soon as we start walking up to this place I'm automatically excited, i can smell all the good things from inside :) 

the lighting is really calming and warm... we were seated right away.. it took a minute for them to get to us for our drink orders ... they had so many take out orders it was insane... so i figured it had to be good right?! 

in the mean time i learned that my date is a vegetarian... well that's cool and all but somehow it turned into me defending my right to eat meat... i was really calm about it and just let it roll off but i was annoyed... 

as soon as we ordered our food.. like the second the lady walked away he looked at me with the weirdest look ever and said "Aren't you going to go and wash your hands?" WTF!!!!!! like he expected me to just get up and make a dash for the restroom... do i look like I'm 6yo? "um well dude... I'm sure we have some time... ill wait a little before i go and wash my hands... " he continued to look at me like i was gross or something.... weird 

he got a Thai beer and i got my usual water with extra lemon :) and the beer was really good... I'm not sure what its called but if you translate the title to English it means brother... (he igoogled it) it had a nice flavor... and its the same price as a soft drink lol score! 

once we got our food i was soo excited! i got the sweet and sour chicken .. with steamed white rice... they had the pineapple, onions, green bell peppers and a new one for me... TOMATOES!! and it was delicious!! just amazing... 
he had something vegetarian... with noodles and broccoli... 

so the whole time throughout dinner he proceeded to laugh out loud with his mouth FULL of food... and talk really loud at me with his mouth still full of food... and i mean its about to fall out of his mouth... it almost ruined my dinner... to bad i was too focused on the bell peppers! mmmm 

then he proceeded to pick food off his place and put it on my mine to try... which would have been cool... if he didn't use his HANDS to serve it... I'm glad to know he had just washed his hands but still... really?!? 

once we were finished he got the check... then showed me and started bitching about it! it came to a total of $22 and some change... um two dinners plus a beer... man that's a great deal in my eyes... plus I've never had a date show me the bill before... isn't that like a man rule? hmm i thought it was... so he takes care of it and we leave... still with me opening all my own doors... :( and as the drive to the next destination he continued to belch out loud without covering his mouth or saying "pardon me or excuse me" or anything.... and kept talking about how he had to go to the bathroom ... i was horrified! 

End Result.... 

Good Food... Nice and clean bathroom..the soap leaves your hands SUPER soft and touchable :) 
The Service was nice... 
Nice atmosphere... 
Horrible date... 
Wish i had had better company :( 

oh and i Tossed out his number...

There seems to be a bit of hate for this restaurant based on previous reviews.  Luckily for me there weren't many negatives about my meal here.  So busy in my escapades around Las Vegas on my second day there I completely forgot about taking a break for lunch.  After perusing the menu the night before and observing dishes of what other patrons seemed to be enjoying I decided to drop in on the Dragon Noodle Co. inside the Monte Carlo Hotel & Casino for an early dinner.

I was seated quickly by the restaurant's hostess.  Because it seemed not too busy I was given the option of sitting at a table, at the bar, in the lounge, at the sushi bar or in the main dining room.  I chose the latter, and I was quite surprised as the main dining room was nearly full.  This is another pricey Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas; although, it is not nearly as pricey as Jasmine at the Bellagio.

The heavy fabric napkins are all sleeved in paper holders printed with the restaurant's graphics (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=TaA0bI9GiB-96VrSODPxEw).  The restaurant uses a baby boy's face (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=DY_GqwfhoJGhbAY1ghUYDg) similar to the little peach boys of Chinese folklore (supposedly brings good fortune) as its main logo, and that image is amusingly plastered throughout the dcor of the restaurant.  The wait staff will come around, unsleeve your napkin and place it on your lap for you.  I was quite new to this service so I stopped the young lady and gestured that I can do that myself.  Looking back it was pretty comical what I was actually thinking, but she took my beverage order and walked away.

Three menus are presented, a dinner menu, a sushi menu and a huge, thick binder listing wines and spirits served.  It's a bit too early for a drink, and I never eat sushi at Chinese restaurants so away went those two menus.  They give you time to order here.  My peripheral vision noticed the waiter glancing my way every now and then, but he did not approach my table until I put down the menu.  I ordered the Salt & Pepper Calamari and the Roast Duck half.  Steamed rice is included with most entrees.

My bowl of rice and the calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=-HfxZmaC7AGYoN11jcimug) were brought out rather quickly.  Understandable as roast duck usually warrants additional preparation time.  The calamari was very good.  The calamari filets were scored, battered and deep fried.  There was just a hint of greasiness.  Salt, pepper and chopped jalapenos are used to season the battered calamari which were served on a bed of shredded lettuce with minced onion and garlic and more jalapeno slices.  The calamari had a nice kick to it.

The roast duck (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=trW1SO7_8uHDTfpnsdTGpQ) was brought out a short time later.  It was served with a sweet and sour plum sauce which I found to be a bit generic in taste.  Where do these places find these ducks that are thick in meat and flavor and can't be found in San Francisco?  I loved the duck which was traditionally roasted Hong Kong style with the thin crispy skin similar to Peking ducks.  The flavor of the marinade was very good and there was tons of duck meat to enjoy.  

It took me a bit of time, but I managed to polish off everything.   Even so the waiter came by twice to check if everything was okay and whether I wanted more rice.  At the end of my meal he brought me a hot disinfectant towlette sealed in plastic to clean my hands and face.  I passed on dessert although the thought of having some freshly fried sesame balls did enter my mind.

**Disclaimer: This is probably going to be a 2 part review just like I did for my 400th with Ortolan... we need a higher character limit....**

FINALLY!!  Hubert Keller is one of my favorite chefs, so ever since I first heard about him a couple years ago, I told myself next time I was in either Las Vegas or San Francisco, I HAD to go to Fleur de Lys.

It happened to be restaurant week in Las Vegas so our group had come here getting that menu in mind.  However that didn't last very long.

Our reservation was for 8:30, but a table where they were planning on seating us was taking their sweet ol' time and we were forced to wait.  After about 10-15 minutes of waiting outside, the hostess finally came up to us and offered us to wait in their lounge and enjoy complimentary champagne in their LOWLY lit lounge to apologize for the longer wait.  Free champagne?  Yes please!  The hostess was also kind enough to keep us updated on the table, waiting maybe an additional 10 or so minutes.

The lighting in the dining room was a little better and was thinking I could get away taking pictures without using my external flash on my camera (I hate using flash in a fine dining restaurant as I feel its a little bit of a distraction and nuisance).  Our table was slightly tucked away off in the corner, making out meal semi private.  Within a New York minute, our server, Marcus, was at our side, giving us our menus.  So like I said, we had come having in mind that we were going to get the restaurant week menu for $50.  However, right when we opened the menu, right there staring us down was Chef Keller's "Elegance Menu", which was 4 courses (instead of 3 on the RW menu) for $89.  Yes, a little hard to justify an extra course for $39, but, while some were the same, had more and better choices.  Such "better" choices included veal and potato ravioli and filet mignon.  The RW menu did not have the ravioli or the filet.

I started with the ahi tuna tartare with shaved fennel salad, a ginger ponzu sauce, and fennel seed tuile.  The tuna was very fresh and the ponzu wasn't too overpowering or salty.

My next course I ordered the veal and Yukon gold potato ravioli with English peas, veal jus, pea shoots, and a sunchoke foam.  The ravioli were pretty good but I do have to say the veal jus was a little salty.  I still very much enjoyed this dish.

For my entree, I ordered the prime filet mignon, with a potato puree, baby spinach, wild mushrooms, salsify, and a red wine reduction.  Medium rare of course.  The meat was cooked perfectly, though slightly underseasoned. The vegetables were perfect and the potato puree was very buttery.  There was an option to add black truffles and foie gras to the filet for an additional $25, and while I didn't partake in that, 2 others did.  The size of the foie was as round as the filet and they put A LOT of truffles.  I'm not talking about like maybe 3 or maybe 5 slices of black truffles.  It was a PILE of truffles, I'm guessing at least a dozen slices.  That right there, at $75/oz, definitely worth the $25.  And while seeing that much foie and truffles made me sad I didn't get it, they both gave me some of theirs so it was like I had gotten it myself.  Oh man... the foie was just... I had to take a moment.  I also said I didn't want to eat or drink anything else after having the foie for fear of washing away the flavor.  It was ethereal.

As much as I wanted to savor the foie gras, our dessert courses came out.  With souffle on the menu, I knew at least 3 or 4 people in our party would order it, so instead of ordering one for myself, I decided I would just steal a couple of bites of theirs and order the other item: a banana chocolate lava cake, served with a shot of peanut butter milkshake and Baileys ice cream.  The lava cake was really good and had a pleasantly subtle banana flavor.  The peanut butter milkshake was good.  I honestly didn't really get the Baileys ice cream.  Personally to me it just seemed to be a little bit of a disconnect.  I mean, if the pastry chef would kindly explain why he chose Baileys ice cream, then I'd probably understand.  But until then, your guess is as good as mine.

I'll end here for now because of the 5000 character limit... remainder of review shall come tomorrow....

***Lotus of Siam is a very good Thai restaurant and easily the best value I've ever had in Vegas, which is filled with overpriced and mediocre restaurants***

Lotus of Siam is a very well respected Thai restaurant in Las Vegas (it recently won a James Beard award).  The restaurant is off The Strip but not too far away.  The restaurant is located in a deserted kind of strip mall and has a no frills decor, but it is nice enough.  The restaurant is clean and has warm colors (the walls are outfitted with many photos--I guess with pictures of celebrities though I did not take a close look).  The restaurant is also bigger than I expected and was very busy (luckily, we had reservations).

The menu at Lotus of Siam is huge.  There is an unbelievable number of dishes and they range from all kinds of proteins (beef, pork, shrimp, chicken, many kinds of fish) to many different types (soups, salads, noodles, appetizers, and so on).  We tried several things.  Here is the rundown.

(Deep fried chicken wings stuffed with ground pork and served with sweet and sour sauce).  The chicken wings were moist and flavorful as well as crispy (and not greasy).  The sauce was thin and mostly sweet.

(Tom Yum Kung hot and sour soup with shrimp, lime juice, lemongrass, and straw mushrooms) The soup had a strong citrus flavor as well as good fragrance from the fresh herbs.  There was a very generous portion of shrimp, which were plump and moist.  The soup was surprisingly spicy and left quite the tingling on the tongue.

(Thai Beef salad with onion, tomato, chili, lime juice, and greens) I liked this one more than my friends, who were surprised by its lack of salad-ness.  The salad was mostly a stir fry, but the meat was nicely cooked and had a good flavor.  I liked the lime flavor as well as the moistness of the plate.

(Charbroiled prawns with garlic black pepper sauce) The prawns were big, moist and tender.  The garlic black pepper sauce was good and not too overpowering.

(Pad Thai with chicken, egg, green onion, bean sprouts, and chopped peanut and Thai fried rice with shrimp, egg, onion, and tomato) Their Pad Thai and their fried rice were the only disappointing dishes of the night.  The noodles were too soft and clumped together too much.  The other ingredients were fine, but the overall flavor was nothing special compared to other Thai spots I've tried.  The same could be said for their fried rice.

(Crispy duck with chili, mint leaves and Thai basil) The duck was very good--moist but with a great crispy and crunchy outside batter.  The garnishes were flavorful and fragrant.

(Braised beef short rib panang with a red cream curry sauce and cognac) The creamy sauce was great--great flavor and incredible fragrance.  The short rib was just okay.  While mostly tender, the short rib varied from kind of dry in some parts to too fatty in other parts.

(Fried banana rolls) I liked the very egg roll-like wrapper (crispy, thin and not too sweet).  The banana was sweet and good.  I liked it, but it was nothing exceptional.

(Coconut ice cream) The ice cream had a good flavor and was creamy, but it was a little sorbet like.

Service was friendly, but it did take a while for us to put in our order.  The first dishes took a little bit of time to come out and I wished that our second run of dishes would have been spaced apart more (too much came out at the same time).

Prices were very good.  Given the quality and the fact that Lotus of Siam is in Vegas, the meal was easily the best bang-for-your-buck meal I've ever had in Vegas.

While I am not that experienced with Thai food, I really enjoyed Lotus of Siam.  Many of the dishes were good.  Since Las Vegas has so many overpriced restaurants, it was very refreshing to try a place like Lotus of Siam where you could spend less but not sacrifice in terms of quality.  If I was ever in Vegas again with a big group and needed a satisfying but also reasonably priced dinner, we would definitely head to Lotus of Siam.

The strip mall has a huge and free parking lot.

8/25/12

Met a friend here for my first breakfast at Dottie's.  I knew he was excited to try this location, since he'd been to the flagship in SF.  He told me to bring my appetite and warned that he was going to over-order, but I think we did breakfast just right! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dotties-true-blue-cafe-scottsdale?select=QA8KkDikOa6kjSROv7te6A#d3sa8tTy-MDlsNGtfoGc9w

It was a beautiful morning, with most of OTS's inhabitants seeming to still be in bed-- I quite enjoyed the open spaces and lack of pedestrian traffic as I parked into a lot right outside Dottie's front doors (we planned to meet at opening time 7:30a).  Michael was seated just a few minutes before, and I believe we were Dottie's first customers.  Found the interiors quaint- a diner atmosphere for sure, but cleaner, and definitely more inviting.  On my way to the restroom a few minutes later, I found that Dottie's has a second room, whose space seemed more peaceful, as I don't recall seeing a kitchen there, with cooks bustling about.  I mentioned to Michael about the second room, which surprised him, since the very room we were in was already a lot larger than the one he'd visited in SF.  

Coffee was good, for a non-specialty blend (we were told it was a Shamrock Farms product), and we very much appreciated how our cups were filled constantly!  Excellent service by our server, whose name escapes me right now (starts with a "T," I think), even though I had to remind her about the whipped cream for our Peach cobbler crumble cake. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dotties-true-blue-cafe-scottsdale?select=pU0UjuOSuVWv03e03_g56Q#pU0UjuOSuVWv03e03_g56Q  The fresh-whipped cream arrived almost immediately, and was it a beauty! https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=4120027511918&set=a.4107818566702.163328.1020200359&type=3  I wholeheartedly recommend others order this pastry should it ever find its way on the daily specials board again! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dotties-true-blue-cafe-scottsdale?select=P-eydevPkLcST4_L6W4nvA#P-eydevPkLcST4_L6W4nvA

While Michael ordered the Blueberry cornmeal hotcakes he's had to skip on his SF visit (they had pumpkin bread French toast on the menu then, hello!), I naturally gravitated to the Cinnamon roll French toast, hold the powdered sugar, with honey-cured ham and a fresh fruit cup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dotties-true-blue-cafe-scottsdale?select=zlftv8fqh0KnEmmCuX6azw#zlftv8fqh0KnEmmCuX6azw  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dotties-true-blue-cafe-scottsdale?select=0cPhOrlomtoSQW1ERxB6TA#0cPhOrlomtoSQW1ERxB6TA  Another excellent dish, which I polished off almost immediately-- awesome combo of textures when combined with the terrific pure maple syrup (!!) served here.  Buddy, I hope you had more than the one piece I remember giving you... (I'm thinking I gave you two!)  I must say that I think that the entree should've had a couple more pieces of CR French toast on there.  ;)  Seriously, though, the photo (thanks to friend for adding them on here) looks like it's lacking something.  Buddy said "the powdered sugar," but I would've liked some mascarpone cream sauce, or a generous drizzle of creme anglais...

I couldn't try the fresh-baked Cinnamon roll (powdered sugar icing), but I did enjoy the bites I had of the Blueberry-white chocolate streusel muffin Mike had also ordered off the specials board.  The blueberries were HUGE and the white chocolate combo made for a very tender and moist cake, and the streusel topping added another great textural layer.  Mike "doesn't do leftovers," and so I was able to go home with some, and I will say that the peach cobbler crumble cake was just as good the next day, while not so much with the muffin... If I were you, I'd share that pastry with two or more companions, for it certainly won't keep.  

We were given a sample of the sausage and biscuits, and while I enjoyed the spice level of the food, I wasn't too crazy about this dish, but I'm sure it's because my digestive system can't handle red and green bell peppers (although I can handle other peppers without problems).  However, I will say that the tiny bit of biscuit I had was very, very nice- tender, but not too much so, and flaky.  I'd order one or two on future visits, definitely.  

Very fun breakfast, and I certainly wouldn't mind returning again!  :D

This was my goal when I went to Vegas. 

I looked up all the buffets ,and this was just the best one out there.  
We got in line around 1:40 pm on a Saturday, and paid by 2:58 !!! saving 3 dollars lol because 3  - 10 pm is dinner, so the price increases from 41.99 - 44.99. 

It took another 20 minutes after we paid to be seated. 

I was shocked that they had SO MUCH SEATING, there are empty tables everywhere, so I'm guessing they understaff in order to profit ( which most places do ).  When we were walking to our table, I saw many tables that had not been cleared of plates, but were just waiting to be filled. 

Unlimited drinks ( fruit juices ( they have fresh squeezed watermelon juice, carrot juice, etc, but unfortunately, when we tried to order them they ran out :( , coffee, soft drinks, tea w/ real honey !!! imported from France !!!! , ) 
The coffee was hot, but I wish they used a darker roast, because there wasn't that much flavor.

alcoholic drinks are extra. 

Seafood = oysters ( I had about 35 of these, I wish they were bigger, they were soo small compared to the picture shown in the advertisements)  The oysters flesh was kinda washed apart, like they had been washed too much.  So the flesh of the oysters became flaky. 
            crab legs =   I had a small piece of crab from my friends place, it was a little salty but not that bad, I like how you can choose to steam the legs.  I don't eat crab / try not to, because they are becoming endangered. 
            Mussels & clam & paella = all yummy esp the little bits of ham in the mussel soup 
            Cocktail shrimp = the shrimp were bigger than most shrimp cocktail i've eaten, not as big as tiger shrimp though . 
             
Meat = prime rib juicy and tender 
             lamb chop = could have been more tender, and they had a whole bucket of them sitting on the serving station, so I'm not sure how long they were cooked before they were served. 
             slider = soo tender and i loved the mayonnaise spread the had on the buns 

Mexican = fresh tortillas & guac & the mexican style sweet corn w/ butter & cheese & chili  the mexican pollo soup ( i'm not sure what it was called ) it was red and oily on top was very yummy and savory. 

Japanese  = They had tuna poke salad !!!  & the fish was very fresh ! 
               sadly no sashimi, but the sushi was all very fresh. 
                also have your choice of miso soup ( make your own ) 

Chinese = typical chinese food, they had xiao long bao and lo mai gei !!! 
               xiao long bao is the soup dumpling, and lo mai gei is the glutinous rice with meat inside.   sweet & sour soup was good too !

Italian =  they had 6 different kinds of dried meats to choose from 
                (Prosciutto, Pancetta, Dried Beef, Salami, and a few other kinds ) 
                these were all delicious, and tasted very good with the cheeses & fresh fruit they offered. 

Fruit  / Salad = I didn't have any salad because I didn't want to waste space in my stomach, but the honey dew was so sweet !!! Too bad they ran out after everyone else figured out how delicious it was.  The watermelon wasn't that sweet. 

Cheese = I tried the white cheddar, and blue cheese, and my friend said the parmesan was yummy even though she doesn't usually like cheese.  I tried the blue cheese on accident, and spat it out because I hate blue cheese. But if you liked blue cheese, you would like there blue cheese. 

Dessert = I don't save dessert for last, I feel like if you do that then you will run out of room in your stomach.  I prefer to intersperse my dessert within my meals at buffet, that way you can try everything. 
             Creme bruleee = they have chocolate & regular creme brulee here, I tried the chocolate one and it was pretty good. 
          TIramisu = so good and light !!!! unhh i really liked it. 
          Chocolate dipped strawberry =good 
           Chocolate & cheesecake pop = so decadent and rich and creamy. the white chocolate cheesecake pop was SO GOOD. I would buy these separately if they offered them. 
           Flan = i finished all of it so good. 
           White / pink fluffy marshmallow = mmm so light ! home made too i think ! I even felt cute eating it ! 
           Mini red velvet cupcake = so cute loved the decoration ! and cheesecake frosting was delicious. 
          Syringe dessert = i enjoyed injecting my dessert with red jam like filling, too bad they are probably not reusable. 


Gelato = only tried the sorbet, blood orange, tangerine, and watermelon mint all sooo refreshing light and fruity. 

Crepes = so good !!!! ate a whole bunch of the fresh fruits that they offered as well !!! 


We ended up staying at the buffet for 2 hours, I wish I stayed for longer, and walked some laps around the buffet so I could have eaten more. 

P.S.Cannot believe I wrote so much, I commend anyone whom actually read all of this shit.

After reading so many reviews on the positive and negative about the place I just didn't know what to expect.  My opinion after chowing down there is that there's a lot to love about the place and a lot to be... What's the right word?  Annoyed at...

Maybe we'll discuss the positive first, the food!  Let me first explain that I hardly EVER order chicken at a restaurant.  Usually it's never cooked right.  Sure I order wings here and there, but never as a main dish.  It's usually too dry.  I hardly even eat chicken at home, I can't cook it right either!  So going to a BBQ place while dieting creates a lot of challenges.  One is that the BBQ chicken (non-fried) was the best option.  So I was nervous, real nervous.  But let me tell you... It. Was. Awesome!  So tender and juicy and flavorful.  Best chicken I've ordered in a restaurant EVER!  I was in cluck cluck heaven!  

We went hog wild (funny, right?) and ordered every single one.  When in Rome, right?  So let's go down the list.  

Cornbread: Okay, but a little too grainy for my taste (and $3 for one slice!!)
Potato Salad: Okay.  I like Potato Salad with crisp not mushy potatoes, and they were but the taste just wasn't there for me.
Mac n' cheese: Good.  It was incredibly creamy and tasty, but not the best I've ever had (Kelly's, Six Penn Kitchen, etc.).
Coleslaw: Okay. Vinegar based, which I usually dig, but again, just wasn't the best I've ever had
Baked Beans: Delicious!  I loved the taste!  Bacon, perhaps a little sweet Maple Syrup or Cinnamon?  Whatever, it tasted awesome!
Greens: The winner!  It was vinegar based as well and bursting with flavor.  Toss in some more bacon and bam, best of the night!

The food presentation is pretty cool too.  They just bring out everything on a big metal try and every side comes in a different looking pan it's probably cooked in.  I loved the BBQ too because again, the magic ingrediant, it had a ton of vinegar flavor!  Good thing they had extra sauce on the table because I doused my chicken in it.  

The bad.  It's WAY overpriced.  The food is simple but good.  The meats are $12-$22 for half and full racks and the sides are $1-5 on their own.  Why the high price?  Do you want to be upscale BBQ?  Does that even make sense?  Upscale I imagine has a totally different environment to go with it.  The sad thing is, it's pretty good so I bet they won't lower prices.  

The decor is minimal and simplistic.  Red gingham walls and long picnic table seating.  I wouldn't mind the picnic tables if they were a little skinnier.  It's true what everyone's saying, it's hard to hear the person across from you.  Also, if it's busy and there's a wait, people at the front are standing there with no tables to put drinks on while they wait and pretty much starring down the people sitting at the tables right in front of them.  It's just awkward and I feel like they need some high tops up front or some bench seating.    

If they lowered prices, I'd probably throw on another star and be back more often.  Because of that very reason, I probably won't visit often, even though I did enjoy it.  Time will tell....

You can serve me terrible food.
You can mix me a crappy cocktail. 
Your ambiance can fall flat. 
You can even charge me more than I want to pay.

But take note Tempest (and really any other business in Madison and beyond) you can't be complacent. I mean you can, but I will not patronize your business nor will I recommend it. 

When you turn the lights on, polish flatware and open your doors you are entering into an agreement with those that are coming to spend money that you want their business. But after 4 visits and an event that I unfortunately brought 28 people out for, you have done nothing to make me think you a. want my business, b. care to make money. So I have to ask... why show up to work? 

Tonight was the last straw. My friend and I were sitting at the bar for ten minutes before someone came over not to ask us what we wanted to drink or to show us menus, but to stand there. To stand there and look at us blankly until we asked if happy hour was still going on. He said yes and lobbed the conversation back our way, didn't go over the happy hour specials of which there are many. I felt terrible for suggesting we grab light bites and drinks to this friend who had never been to Tempest. 

*flash forward*

I'm not eating sugar right now and the brown sugar sauce that tops their scallops is entirely too sweet, so I asked for seared scallops with the bacon lardons that typically top the dish but not the sauce. I explained if the kitchen wasn't interested in accommodating my request and leaving the sauce out, I'd find something else. Surprise, the scallops came out with the cloyingly sweet sauce and this is how the next few moments went:

BARTENDER: Yeah, I said just the scallops and lardons, so maybe they can't separate the lardons from the sauce? 
COREY: Ok, well I don't eat sugar, so I can't really eat these, there's no way to get just seared scallops, no sauce?
BARTENDER: I mean, that's what I asked for, so I guess they can't do it. Did you want these? 
(I'm sort of fuming at this point)
COREY: No, I mean I can't do the sugar so....
BARTENDER: They'd be on the house.

GO TO THE KITCHEN AND SAY THESE CAME UP WRONG, CAN YOU SIMPLY SEAR SCALLOPS AND PUT BACON ON THEM? What's the challenge here? 

*flash forward some more*

Drinks went empty, food was eaten, and it took forever to catch someone's eye to get refills or order more. Why? Because it was more important for a gaggle of servers to talk with the bartenders about what a proper wine pour looks like. I counted 5 at one point staring at the same glass of white wine, then repeating this behavior 15 and 25 minutes later. So detail oriented.

Last up, the gent that cases the joint, a manager I assume, does laps around the restaurant every time I've been there, but never asks how we're doing. And that's really the crux of my issue. I know full well a business can't be 100% "on" 100% of the time, we all have bad days. But when leadership at the top has no vested interest in how people spending hard earned money feel about their establishment, that trickles down, and I want no part of it. 

There are plenty of restaurants in town that serve seafood by people who are interested in striking up conversation, making menu recommendations and righting wrongs that may occur when things go awry in the kitchen. I'll go to those places, a giant wooden boat and tea lights don't do it for me.

What a lovely surprise located in...well...Surprise! Mr. Hottie and I decided to have dinner somewhere different. The plan was left to me so I decided to head out to Surprise. I have heard some rumblings of a new bistro out there so I hopped on Yelp to look it up. I made a reservation for 8pm and headed out the door. 

When we arrived we were immediately struck by the nice decor and cool music. We were greeted warmly and had to wait only a few moments to be seated. We got a nice dimly lit corner table, perfect. We surveyed the patrons, while the website does say the attire is casual, I wouldn't suggest coming in shorts and a t-shirt. Those who did, didn't look like they belonged. Maybe shorts and a polo? Maybe.
 
Anyway, onto our visit. Our hostess seated us and asked us if we had been there before. We responded no and she went on to thank us for our visit and welcome us to the bistro. What was cool about her greeting was that it wasn't like she was running through a script in her mind, it was actually a genuine welcome! No dead behind the eyes Scottsdale hostess here! Our waitress, Jessica was friendly and bubbly. She usually worked the lunch shift so she was a tad shaky on dinner service but we were forgiving. She was doing a great job and trying really hard to make sure we were happy. 

We started out with a martini. Mr. Hottie had a "Stuffed Goose" which is Grey Goose with stuffed blue cheese olives. I had the Valentino, a pomegranate martini. We both enjoyed our cocktails. We also ordered a 2004 petit syrah to go with our dinner. 

Ahh.. dinner. Let's start with the appetizer. (Tree hugger/PETA member beware) 
We ordered the foie gras. The plate was very unceremoniously dropped onto our table by a food runner. She didn't even announce what the food was, just sort of plopped it in front of us and said "There ya go!". Not kidding. Oh well, a minor hiccup. While I was expecting a nice seared piece of duck liver, we got something more in the line of pate. It came with hunks of toast and a compote of apple and figs. It was still VERY delicious. Not as savory as a seared piece of liver, it was still very yummy and I will get it again. 

We also shared a beet and goat cheese salad. I grew up thinking that I detested beets. They came out of a can, and they tasted like pennies. WRONG. I actually got coaxed into trying beets again and they were so yummy! The goat cheese with the beets were great! The bed of arugula was a little much for me, but that's a personal choice.  

Mmm Dinner...We both ordered something from the Chef's entrees of the day. Don't be sad when you see the small dinner menu. The chef adds about 3-4 entrees onto that. Mr. Hottie ordered the thick cut pork chop topped with an apple and bacon mixture, and on the side was broccolini and curried cauliflower, talk about savory and spicy (not HOT but just full of flavor). The pork chop was perfectly cooked, if you like your pork chop well done. It wasn't too dry and the meat was moist and tender. The curried cauliflower was crisp and fresh, not at all mushy.  I had the duck breast with sticky rice, cabbage rolls and a slice of roasted pineapple on the bottom. It was DIVINE. The duck breast was juicy and delicious. All the flavors ran together in harmony. The cabbage rolls were just that, a small egg roll filled with cabbage. Sounds simple right? Wrong, the cabbage was so good. It was very well seasoned and the roll wasn't greasy at all. The ONLY thing I would have changed is that the ball of sticky rice was CRUNCHY on the outside. I don't know if that was the intention of the chef, but being a sticky rice/ any rice eater, it came off as though the rice had been left out to dry. Other than that, heaven. 

We took our time with our dinner, sat, drank wine, and surveyed the area again. The chef had made an appearance at the table next to us. I understand that one of the gentlemen at at the table was from France and that is where the Chef is from. So she made a very friendly visit. As our dinner lulled and the restaurant emptied a bit, we were hoping the chef would stop by to say hello as she was blowing out candles around us, but she left us alone with our wine. Oh well, maybe next time I'll grab her. After all there was a lot of hand holding and goo goo eyes going on at our table. Maybe she didn't want to interrupt. We did get visits from the Chefs Hunky Husband who was very courteous, and the Hostess came by again to make sure our visit was going well. Talk about great service! 

Vogue Bistro is a breath of fresh air in an area riddled with chain establishments. I suggest restaurant owners take notice and maybe form a restaurant row or something. Wouldn't that be cool!
I have a feeling that Vogue Bistro will be on my list of places to go whenever I'm way out west. This place was fantastic and a must try!

My bf & I have always been fans of Gordon Ramsay. After watching the whole season of Master Chef Jr. I was mindblown at how those little kids could replicate Ramsay's infamous beef wellington. Everytime I see pics of his wellington, I start salivating, hoping to try it one day. Well...THE DAY FINALLY CAME!! I know he has the London West Hollywood restaurant in L.A., which served the wellington, but the reviews weren't great. I'm so glad I waited to try his food in Vegas, rather than the L.A. restaurant!

We had reservations at 9:30pm, but arrived to vegas a little late Fri night due to traffic. Luckily, they were able to accommodate us at 10:15PM.
NOTE: HELL'S KITCHEN TASTING MENU STOPS AT 930PM

We were guided through the "tunnel" and given the option to our table upstairs via elevator or stairs. The view upstairs is amazing with this giant neon structure of Gordon's hands making the wellington. The interior is chic decorated in colors of black and red w/ a big British flag painted on the ceiling. Downstairs is an open kitchen, bar, and framed photos of Ramsay. It's very classy yet romantic at the same time

Our server Yaron was such a sweetheart! We came for our anniversary & he made it very memorable. I felt like royalty dining in this restaurant!  After browsing the menu, Yaron pulled up the meat cart and the carnivore in me wanted to devour every meat on that cart! He said that if I finished the 24oz bone in rib eye, he'd applaud and give me a free t-shirt. I will most definitely be back to take on this challenge :D

Shortly after ordering, the fresh breads came out on a plate (different than most places serving it in a basket). We ended up eating 2 plates of the bread 'cause it was so bomb! I wanted to get some to-go at the end of the night, but forgot to ask. ALL 4 VARIETY OF BREADS WERE SOO GOOD. My fav were the brioches w/ truffle and pancetta (bacon). The walnut baguette was good as well especially w/ the butter. I LOVE the butter here w/ the sea salt. Gives texture & taste. 

English Chowder - smoked haddock, scallops, fingerling medallions, 
citrus pearls. Wow at first I thought it'd be like clam chowder, but this takes chowder to a different level. Initially it came out in the soup bowl w/ just the scallop, haddock, etc. & then the server pours out the soup from a little pot. Very nice, thick consistency yet not over laden w/ butter. Scallop was cooked to perfection! It was a very filling soup, not your typical chowder.

Maine Lobster - O..M..G.. the lobster was a work of art. The lobster cream was delicious, I wanted to lick the whole plate. Lobster was cooked to succulent and had a beautiful red color. Very tender, buttery smooth, fresh. The lentils were cooked perfectly as well, but I do wish that they accompanied this dish w/ something else other than lentil.

Beef Wellington for 2 - Over $100 for this bad boy. It's funny the say for 2, when really it's just one wellington, but cut in half. So usually if you order wellington for 1, you get just half the wellington..It literally took 45 mins to get this dish. The wait was agonizing 'cause my mind just kept thinking about how good it'd be. When the plate finally came my heart was racing. This dish looked exactly like it did on T.V.! Everything was beyond amazing. Pastry crust was flaky, filet inside was roasted to medium rare. All the flavors in one bite blended so well I was so amazed. The potato puree and red wine demi glaze were excellent. The glazed vegetables (parsnips & carrots) accompanying the dish had glaze that were shimmering.

Demi Roasted Bone Marrow - HUGE bones plated beautifully, decorated w/ green salsa verde. These totally blew away Mastro's bone marrow. I didn't care if my arteries would be clogged, these babies tasted so rich as we scooped the marrow out from the big bones.

Sticky Toffee Pudding - I noticed every table ordered this and so we had to try it since everyone raved about it & it's their signature dessert. I'm not sure why they call it pudding, when it it really is a date cake. I LOVE the brown butter ice cream, it's cute how they even made it look like a stick of butter. Yaron drizzled the toffee syrup onto the cake and as it flowed spreading throughout the plate I couldn't wait to dig in. The date cake was moist and when you eat the ice cream w/ the cake & toffee, it's an explosion of sweetness in your mouth.

We didn't finish til after midnight and were the last ones to leave the restaurant (they close at midnight). Midway through our meal, we felt bad staying so late so we told Yaron that he could bring out the dessert when the Wellingtons came out, but he insisted no rush and that we should take our time to enjoy our meal. That is customer service at its finest. We never felt rushed at all, truly an amazing experience at this restaurant. Can't wait to come back! O BTW, I wanted to get a pic w/ Christina, but was notified she has left and is now exec chef at BurGR!

Michelin Stars #38-39

Oh Vegas, such a perfect town for indulgence and gluttony. Guy Savoy (not pronounced how you'd think) was chosen as a nice special dinner for my wife and myself, for no reason other than to live it up. 

Being an old married couple and knowing dinner could be 3+ hours, we took the earliest reservation at 6pm. The space was grand and empty upon arrival and we were seated with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains to the south. The mostly white decor was only interrupted but the occasional ultra-bright piece of "art," all of which I loved. After a quick glance at the menu, the only option worth considering was the full Innovation menu with a shared wine pairing. And now on to the show!

1. Foie and Toast Amuse: 
What's not to love about foie anything, truffles, and some crisp bread to add some texture. A perfect way to say hello while having your ear licked with taste.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#q-5nZctMRztBoHuzI-9IiA

2. Waffle and Parmesan Amuse: 
Kind of a weird one but god damn if that wasn't one of the best bites of waffle I've ever had. Another wow bite. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#k-HfOiDwUHjQDk2yS_A-Ug

3. The Bread Cart: 
Dude, they make this every single morning. I guess it's less impressive when you consider the small army of people in the bowels of these hotels that are there 24/7 doing everything. But somewhere down there is someone making over a dozen different types of artisanal bread just for Guy Savoy. We tried over half the selection over the course of dinner and they were all amazing and better.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#CeIpoN0mqYabwMCCuRhM2A

4. Tomato Amuse:
And the "ooos" and "aaahhs" just kept coming from us with this one. They must have made five or six different types of intricate tomato preparations just to combine into something that took two bites. Every area of tomato flavor was highlighted, from the sweet to the vinegar, and it was masterfully finished with a nibble of a tomato chip.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#kgqj-Czz4DtXuRe4HMI7wg

5. "Concass" of Oysters:
Concasse is the French culinary word for crushed or ground up. Here it was a dish of oyster pieces topped with seaweed and an amazing lemon granite. Bite after bite was amazing, we couldn't get over how perfectly well the chopped oysters worked with the crunchy lemon ice. It was everything you could ever want from an oyster dish. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#gVFhIUDM1qU2dkxH3XxtsA

6. Langoustine in Cold Steam:
At this point we were sure they couldn't keep up with this level of amazing food, but they did and did so with one of the more over the top presentations I've seen;

Click play - http://instagram.com/p/dsw_tpTRCa/

Basically what you have here are two preparations of langoustine on a perforated plate, over a bowl of dry ice, that then has a nori broth poured into it creating the "steam" effect. What it really did do was to add a lovely and visible aroma to the place of amazingly delicate langoustine sashimi. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#HVKWHN7wRaciqzmZzUiHFw

7.  Asparagus, Caviar and "Fresh" Cheese:
The title of the dish pretty much gives it away. Though again, the presentation was beautiful, the flavors all wowed, and the cheese foam was closer to a meringue in texture. But hot damn, that was some damn fine caviar. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#5ubR8rXxh6w0WRwNHKzo2Q

8. Salmon Iceberg:
This is the first time I've ever had a chef "cook" something tableside on a block of dry ice;

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#71j9M9W4E8w5KRyMX73O9w

Served by head chef Mathieu Chartron, he graciously rattled off the thinking behind this unique preparation as he plated our ice cold salmon and proceeded to top it off with a very hot broth. The resulting hot/cold mixture was divine. Hard to say for certain if the dry ice treatment really did much, but it was very fun and ended in more oooos and aaahhs from us. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#wGN_mNDWyRB53ISlRUzaqg

9. Lobster:
I really need the before pic to show how this one played out. Basically a nice piece of lobster was presented with a few cylinder shaped veggies on the parameter. Then the servers went on to unwarp each of the veggie rolls and layer them atop the lobster, then topped it all with a wonderful smoked butter sabayon sauce. The result wasn't as pretty as the start, but the flavor combination worked its magic once again on us.

LOSING!!!

This is not my favorite hotel on the strip. Is it full of history with old rooms that smell? Yes that is the smell of History. Come on Sinatra has a suite here. I am sure there are things in this hotel we do not want to know anything about, so sometimes it is better to just hold your nose & deal with it.

I have only stayed at this hotel because of work. I would never personally pick this place ever.

When I check-in, I asked for a Humidifier and I was promptly told, "the Riv does not have any". I informed the check-in agent that I stay in Vegas 3 times a year & every hotel has humidifiers. She promptly told me I was wrong & she questioned what hotels I stayed at last. I informed her and she said, "That is hard to believe because one of the hotels I mentioned was a sister property and they do not have humidifiers!" I looked at her and said, "I am sorry because they gave me one for a week!"  So frustrating! Why are you arguing with me?

Two days went by and I was about to go to Walgreens to purchase a Humidifier. I decided to call Housekeeping and just ask. The Manager in Housekeeping said, "I wish you would have called two days ago because I think I am out of them!" I was so mad that I actually listened to the front desk. I should have just called two days ago. The Manager was so sweet because I asked her to call me back within the hour because if I did not hear from her I would go and buy one. Five minutes later there was a knock at my door and I was handed a humidifier.  That was 5 star service but the front desk not knowing or even making an attempt to get me a humidifier was 0 stars.

My dry cleaning was suppose to be in my room by 7pm the night before. As I was getting ready in the morning I noticed my dry cleaning was not there. I tried several times to call the Bell Hop, to inquiry about my dress shirt but no one ever picked up the phone. So I decided to pick up my shirt myself & went down on my way to work. I informed the Bell Hop my shirt was never delivered. He then looked at me and said, "Did you look in the closet?" I honestly wanted to biff myself in the head and say, "I wish I had a V8!" I looked at him and said, "Really?" He then went to look for my shirt but made sure to tell me that he probably did not have it. Guess what? He had my shirt. Then he had the rudeness to say, "I am going to need to see your ID!" I looked at him and said, "What are the chances that I gave you my last name, my room number, color of shirt and that it wasn't delivered to my room and it isn't my dress shirt???" He said, "Well I have to be sure!" I said, "Just be sure you are making me late for work and I now have to get dressed in the Lobby bathroom now!" Honestly what is the deal with these guys! Are people stealing dry cleaning in hotels?

I also had to leave notes around my room to inform the maid not to touch my stuff. Please do not move my toothbrush and various bathroom stuff. Is it really necessary?  The kicker was the day I walked in and my room was not made and it was 7pm at night. I called the manager and he said, "I see your room has been marked off as cleaned!" I told him to come on up or I could email him photos. He asked if he could send up the maid now and I said, "No! I am in my room & I am good!" Five minutes later there was a knock on my door from the maid who insisted to come in and clean my room. I had to tell her that I was good & did not want my room cleaned. It was more principal. Don't check my room off as clean and then not clean it.

The kicker is this. I decided to go green & check-out from my television. It then asked me to find the keyboard in the room to type in my email to send me out a final bill. I then opened every drawer in my room to find the keyboard. I then called down to the front desk and was informed that none of the rooms have keyboards. Really? Why tell me to check out from the room & I can not get a bill emailed to me. The front desk manger promised me to email me my final bill. It has been 7 days since I have checked out I have not gotten my final bill. I called after 24 hours and had them email me again. No email. I have in fact called 5 times & I have them send out emails to two different email addresses. Guess what? No email. 

I also had food here once too. I had one of the pre-packed salads from the coffee shop. I opened my salad only to find wilting lettuce in the container. So gross! That was the first & last time that I ate at the hotel. If you stay here you are going to be taking cabs down the street or walking to get to any decent restaurants. There is nothing to do at this end of the strip!

I am hating this review right now because I am taking a big deep breath & reliving this lack of customer service at the Riv! This hotel is not a Five Star Hotel. My room was suppose to be non-smoking but it still smelled like smoke. I guess after 58 years you will never be able to get the smoke of the walls!

Wow. Just wow. I am amazed at how much Morton's has changed. I hadn't eaten at Morton's for years, so seeing it was apart of Restaurant Week 2013 it seemed like a good time to go back. Too bad we couldn't go back in time to when I remember Morton's being an excellent place to eat!. 

I made the reservation a few days before, but after arriving I don't think that reservation would have mattered because they were not busy at all and the bar was dead. They did have a menu board after you walk inside promoting Restaurant Week and the RW menu they were offering. After being seated in a comfy booth, a gentleman came over to take our drink order and inform us that he was glad we were seated away from the construction dust. Say what?!?! He said they were doing some remodeling and we got lucky seats. Gee thanks... Not! I wasn't prepared to start off the evening hearing about that and feel he should have kept it to himself. Some things you just don't relay back to the customers.

Our server, Jessie, was attentive checking on us often and never letting our drinks get half empty. Jessie went over the RW menu with us and answered any questions we had. A large "Onion Loaf" was brought to the table with some whipped butter. This is a big loaf! I thought it was good, but seriously it tasted like the onion bun on the beef n cheddar at Arby's. For the RW menu the price was $50.13 per person. For the first course I chose the "Chopped Salad" and I have to say this was the one thing I really enjoyed. The chunks of blue cheese were amazing! I loved having such good sized chunks of blue cheese throughout the salad. The extra fresh cracked pepper I requested was nice too. For the 2nd course, I chose the 8oz filet well-done. Yep, I ordered a steak well-done! Get over it, it's MY steak! The filet is a thicker cut of meat, so when cooked properly it can still melt in your mouth even well-done! This was the first time in my entire life that I have ordered a well-done filet that didn't need to be butterflied. The steak lacked flavor and certainly didn't melt in my mouth. Even the crispy parts lacked flavor! I don't know if Morton's is being cheap with the RW menu, or if they really have gone downhill, but this steak isn't anything close to what I have had here in the past. 

You can clearly see by the RW pictures posted and other pictures posted that Morton's slims down the portion size on some dishes when you order from RW menu. Tsk Tsk! The sides hubby and I chose (came with the 2nd course) were the "Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes" and "Lyonnaise Potatoes" since we weren't fond of the other options. The mashed potatoes were creamy yet had soft chunks of potato in it too. I thought the mashed potatoes were actually decent. The lyonnaise potatoes on the other hand were terrible. The pictures of previous yelpers lyonnaise potatoes looks different from what we got. First off the onions were chewy and nasty. Eating the onions was like chewing on grass. Gross! The potatoes were straight up french fries! This dish was a fail.

So it came time for dessert and I knew I wanted the "Key Lime Pie" I just didn't know it would also be a fail. Key lime pie is one of my favorites (had the worst before this occasion in Florida believe it or not!) and I didn't think Morton's would be the worst ever key lime pie I have eaten. As it was placed in front of me, I could smell some fresh lime and grew excited. Pffft the only thing "lime" about this pie was the few lime zests they scattered on top. That was the smell, just some lime zest. This pie had no tartness at all! It was just bland and like eating nothing. I did not finish it since it bored and disappointed me. 

I started eating at The Mint, or today known as top of Binions, Hugo's Cellar, etc. at a very young age. My parents taught us how to have manners and how privileged it was for someone of our age to be eating in a place like that. To this day we still eat at those places and have the same exact manners. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way rules changed because there were 2 others tables seated near us about half way through our meal. At one table there was a guy wearing light colored jeans and a baseball cap. At the other there was a boy, maybe 6 or 7, making loud sounds, running around the table in circles waving his arms in the air, and the father laughing and encouraging it. I remember when if your jeans weren't dark enough you weren't allowed to dine. A baseball cap is just disrespectful, and the kid running around with no control isn't just the parents fault, but Morton's too. Like I mentioned earlier, the place wasn't very busy and this kid and his noises were obvious enough that someone at Morton's should have said something. They would have when I was younger so what has changed now? I am not paying a good chunk of change to have that going on around me. Because of yelps character limit, Morton's should be glad I can't comment any further! :)

I've had the wonderful opportunity to visit Brooklyn Bowl not once, but twice in one week and let me tell you, I couldn't WAIT to write this review.  Instead of writing a review the first time, I waited for two visits, so I could write a really well balanced review. I thought the first time was too good to be true. Man, I'm glad I waited...

FINALLY, a REALLY great space on the strip.  As a local, I try to stay away from the strip as it's too congested and inconvenient for the everyday life.  This place, will absolutely bring me back time and time again.  When you approach "The BB," you'll notice a very aesthetically pleasing olden day-type cinema sign.  From the outside, it doesn't look that big, but don't let that fool you!  Once you enter, you'll make your way up the escalators.  To the right is a little bar, high top table seating area.  This area is full of large windows which offers great views of the Linq.  To the left of the concierge desk are the restrooms and a couple of ATM machines.  Pass the desk and there's either an outdoor space with table tops and a smoking section to the right, and a lovely restaurant with another bar!  Then, the good stuff:  Passed all that, is a HUGE concert venue area and 16 lanes of bowling.  WOW!  Don't worry, there's a few more bars to keep you liquored up all night long.  If that's not enough, make your way to top VIP area where there's lots of balcony space for the concert, sofas for seating and 16 more lanes to bowl on!  In the VIP area, there's also a bar, an outside roof deck and even a very eclectic living room which offers comfortable couches, big screen tvs, quirky signs and lights, all encompassed with a quieter atmosphere.  SOOO AWESOME!!!  

Brooklyn Bowl is full of amazing features. All around, there's leather couches, palm trees, artsy signs, vines covering the walls and lots of exposed brick. Shows lots of character. The staff is also on point!  They are nice, attentive and EVERYWHERE.  All I have to say is the staffing department did an amazing job!  (There's your shout out, Java!) In all seriousness, one of my former coworker left our company to work at this place and I'm glad she did.  I'm absolutely amazed!  On my first visit, our server was Michael, who goes by Micah.  He was AH-MAZE-ING.  So accommodating, so nice and personable, so awesome. I firmly believe the overall experience comes from the tone a server sets and The BB is filled with positive servers and bartenders.  

I'm not going to lie, the drinks aren't cheap.  I payed about $12 for my Ketel One vodka and soda water.  WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?  You're on the strip.  If you're going to come here, make sure you can afford it.  If not, I think Southpoint has bowling and dollar drinks LOL.  I don't mind it at all, because I don't do this very often.  On both visits, I also had the awesome opportunity to try their food for free.  Here's what I had and here's what I thought:

BBQ pork sliders with cole slaw:  The pork was tender and flavorful.  The cole slaw added a crunchy texture and sweet taste.  The bun was good, maybe too thick, but didn't hurt the experience.

The San Gennaro Pizza:  VERY GOOD pizza.  It's filled with sausage, mozzarella and pepper.  This pizza is packed with sausage!  Lots of toppings offered NO complaints LOL. 

Chicken wings:  THE BEST THING THEY HAVE, BY FAR!  The batter was crispy and crunchy and light.  It was so flavorful with spices and not overpowering. It was served with honey which is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  It really just takes the wings to the next level.  So delicious.

Rolling Stone really hit home when they said Brooklyn Bowl is "one of the most incredible places on earth."  I really believe that on a Las Vegas strip perspective.  Who would have thought a venue that offers bowling and live music in one place would be such a hit!  This is exactly what Vegas needed.  Opening up with one of the coolest bands, The Roots, was a great move on their part.  Listen, if you're in the area, turn north on Koval and make a turn into Winnick street.  You need to park your car and walk to Brooklyn Bowl.  This place will blow you away.  Trust me, it's simply AH-MAZE-ING!

After seeing the pictures being posted on yelp I really wanted to try this place. I have to say getting inside wasn't so easy for me. I was confused about which door was the main entrance. There was an employee who saw me trying to get in and was nice enough to come outside and direct me the right way. I had explained that I was there with a reservation and he mentioned that the rest of my party hadn't arrived yet and he said they were still getting a couple things ready to open for the day so he gave me a lunch menu to look over. 

I have to say the inside looks like a gas station or farmhouse. With the decor, I would expect to find BBQ type food on the menu. Since Hops and Harvest is a farm-to-table concept, maybe they thought the decor and menu would mesh but it doesn't seem a fit to me. There are some awesome happy hour specials from 3-6pm daily. There is a bar and beer, cocktails, and wine are on the menu. The tables are very spacious. We were sat at a booth and the table was so long! You could easily fit 6 or 8 people in just one booth. There is also a patio outside with tables if you prefer to dine there. 

I was sad to see the salad I saw on yelp wasn't on the lunch menu. I asked our server about it and she said it was on the dinner menu but that she would check if it could be made for lunch and I was in luck. I ordered the "Heirloom Tomato" priced at $8.50 and was pretty shocked when it came to the table. It was tiny! The plate is way too big for the amount of food being put on it. That being said, it was so good! The tomatoes were fresh and delicious, the blue cheese really paired well with them. I would have gladly paid more to have a bigger portion. I noticed that during happy hour you can currently get this same salad for $4.50 and given the size, that price would be more appropriate and I would for sure order the heirloom tomato again. My friends ordered the "Grilled Cheese Bites" and I sampled just a taste. It was good! I saw several things on the menu that looked appetizing so I will be back to check it out. I didn't ask, but I'm sure a phone order could be placed to pick up lunch to-go.

Pains me to write this review but it needs to be said. 

You order your pizza to the pizza man and then go pay at the counter. It's a  DIY drink, condiments, utensils and such situation. 

We ordered light since we had a early dinner to go to but haven't eaten breakfast or lunch. I'm glad we did. 

Chopped Salad -I like the salami that is in there with the tomato, onion and lettuce, but it's just a simple, good solid salad. It's a really fine chop so you get a little bit of everything in each bite. They do small and big portions. We did a small which was still quite sizeable and good for sharing between two. This was the best part of the meal - simple salad. 

Marguerita style pizza with meatball and onions - While the ingredients were fresh, it just missed the mark in composition. It was too wet. By the time we were done with the first slice which had a bit of a wet tip (that sounds dirty), the rest of the pizza was soaked on the bottom. The sauce probably needs to be reduced down a bit. 

The structure of making your pizza is choose a base ($7 marguerita, white, pomodoro) and a la carte toppings $1 most, $2-3 for stuff like chicken and prosciutto. Really reasonable to pay $1 for stuff like pepperoni, but I think maybe stuff like garlic slices or a few pieces of onion should be less? I think that's like on different levels since one is substantial vs"flavoring" type topping, and it's cheap compared to a meat. As far as napolitana style pizzas goes, it's alright. I'll go across town to Settebellos than to down the street to here if it doesn't improve in the sog factor. Because of this, I definitely wouldn't recommend trying takeout. Come eat this fresh...just to be safe. 

Anyways when we paid, the BF asked for just some ice water. The girl said they didn't have cups for water at this time and does he want a fountain soda (neither of us drink soda).  I looked over to the fountain and there wasn't ice tea sitting near it which is the only other thing I can drink. There was clear cups and paper cups sitting inbetween her and the BF but there was no cups for water. She asks the person behind her if they have water cups and they said no they don't have water cups. She asked if we wanted to buy bottled water instead, that it's only a dollar or buy any other drink. So the BF clarified, so we cannot have ice water, cannot have a cup except this specified water cup that they do not have, we can only buy water which the answer was basically yes. I think there was no "water cup" but just maybe hope that we would buy something else perhaps than get free tap water or maybe buy a soda but still get water in it? I dunno. It was just a really awkwardly painful conversation to witness. 

Fine we will get two waters which turned out not to be a dollar which she kept telling us it was. I'm not trying to be a nickel and dimer, I'm just annoyed at the situation based on principle. I really need to drink a lot of water and it always sucks having to stick to a small bottle of water and conserve it between bites or buy multiple bottles that add up to the price of my whole meal.

Gah, now I feel like one of those Yelpers that's rambling over something trivial. Which it is in some ways and really isn't at the same time. I want to go to a restaurant and eat relaxed, have water refilled and tip well for that service. 

I went to go look at gelato since it sounded promising from Nelsons review, but unfortunately it was looking pretty melted and off so I opted out of dessert as well. Unfortunate. 

I just don't know how I feel about this place. When you have such a known name as Parma by Chef Marc it's going to be compared to it's successful sister. That place is warm service that recognizes regulars, patient and enthusiastic about explaining the menu, and has attention to detail to make your dining there magical. It's something that is a notch above the usual so it is weird to go from that to a no service place. The people weren't mean, but that whole exchange was really weird with the water cup.... I really don't think that would fly at Parma. Atmosphere and service is part of what sells Parma so why not translate that magic into a pizza place? This isn't a really pricey place, but it isn't cheap that semi-service isn't possible. 

I'm so disappointed. I had high hopes. I hope it changes, but I will watch from afar and see if a Yelperazzi can convince me in their review I need to come back. I really hope I will once this is a restaurant but for now this is a under construction fast food.

It was Pittsburgh Restaurant week and I was beyond excited to try a few new places.  We booked reservations to two places, one being Paris 66 Bistro  and this was the H's pick.  I checked out their prefixed menu online and thought yea this could be really good.  
 
Parking was tricky, but they have a valet at a very reasonable price of $3.00.  The restaurant is quaint but nicely decorated.  They have white table cloths but cover them with paper I guess to save the effort of changing the linens every few hours.  When I say every few hours I mean that was about the time it took us from start to finish to complete our experience.  Not a positive.

After being seated we glanced the prefixed menu, which we had already decided upon and waited.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited some more.  Our waiter finally appeared, not sure what took him so long, but he seemed stressed.  We ordered drinks wine for me French Martini for the H, and immediately put in our order.  I requested the escargot and asked about the Boeuf Bourguignon which was one of the options for the entre the other was salmon.  Our waiter immediately began pushing this lamb special they were having.  He stated he would not order that and he didn't like it.  Compared it to a well done stew.  Um ok.. I said what about the salmon?  He said that was better than the beef but still not one of his favorites and wouldn't suggest it, but he said the sauce was really good.  What the heck?  He was pushing the regular menu and or the special, even stated the food on the menu was much better than the not so cheap $45.00 prefixed meals.  . We didn't allow this to alter our intentions of ordering off the restaurant week menu but I did decide to go with the salmon over the beef.  We both got the goat cheese salad for the appetizer, H went for the beef regardless of the waiters disdain for it, and I got crme brulee and he chocolate mousse.

To the most annoying part. The wait!  We waited for everything!  Our initial drinks took 15 minutes and when done  we waited forever with empty glasses.  The best part is I pushed the glasses to the edge of the table as to be noticed easily as our waiter passed several times, yet he did not stop to address it.  No actually he sped up as to avoid us calling him out as he dashed past our table.  I would have considered them moderately busy, not hustling past tables that are in need of drinks busy!  So we probably waited about 15 minutes before he finally stopped to get us a refill.  The refill process wasn't quick either, and we noticed that the servers made their own drinks.  Hmmm in a management perspective I think this is a bad idea.  But hey if it works for them, which it don't, then oh well.  He brings the drinks and in the process of setting them down he catches the H's on the tacky white paper covering the table cloth and spills a good sip or two of his martini.  The waiter blames the spill on said paper and says the next one's on me.  

At least 30 more minutes, and still nothing. We came hungry this wait was excessive.  About 45 minutes in we got some bread and he dropped off a complimentary bowl of zucchini foam, quite tasty.  An hour in and finally my escargot show up.  H wouldn't even consider trying these puppies and good thing cause they were tiny.  They were quite good, but drowned in butter, garlic, and parsley that that was the primary flavor so I can only describe the escargot texture like a portabella.  Again very good, just wonder what they would have tasted like without all the disguisers.    

Hour and 15 in, salads show.  I have never waited so long for a side salad, yet it was quite delectable.  The goat cheese mixed with the fresh veggies and delicate dressing made a very well balanced salad.  The problem, it was a small portion so we ate it in less than 5 minutes leaving us hungry and waiting for entres.  So another 35 minutes pass and they show up.  The H really liked his beef so I am glad the waiter didn't deter his opinion, however it held the same challenge as the previous courses.  Small, tiny, teeny, itsy bitsy.  My meal held a little more bang for your buck.  The salmon was done nicely, though this sauce that was spoken of was hardly apparent.  The rice and asparagus that accompanied the dish were perfectly cooked.  In the course of eating again we were out of drinks and the empty glasses again sat at the edge of the table, where I would learn they would spend the rest of the night since he hustled past plenty of times without stopping.  Our final course desert arrived, Tasty we both enjoyed.

So in the end would I go again.  Unfortunately probably not.  The food was quite flavorful, but the portions do not represent the price tag, and being dodged for drinks in the almost 3 hours we were there was frustrating.  I would think that would be a no brainer, hello we want wine and cocktails, we drink more your tip goes up, sadly no.

Welcome to another "Hype of Charlotte!" Here is the "chronicle" of the night:

It's my good friend's birthday coming up and he wanted to get dinner here. I went online, made a reservation for 8:15pm last night. I also browsed their menu online, thus I know this is a pretty pricey joint. The funny thing to me is that their seafood entrees are better priced than their meat entrees ($20s vs $30-40s). I don't have problem with the price for as long as the food and service are up to par.

I guess the night was doomed before it even began. I called ahead trying to make sure I know where to park. No answer. Well, I know my way around uptown fairly well, so I figured it should be pretty easy to spot the parking garage. So this forever-been-abandoned-building-formerly-known-as-The-Park does NOT have a public garage that I could see. I drove around that block of Caldwell @ 3rd/4th Street 2.5 times and it's simply baffling how to get in there. I ended up parking on the street at the meter (which is free after 6pm during the week). AND the main entrance to the building faces in away from the main street (Caldwell) next to a gravel parking lot. It's the most bizarre setup just to get into the place.

Once I walked through the sliding door to the building (which is also partly a hotel), I saw 2 valets sitting on their behinds. Well, I guess that may have explained the parking fiasco... they probably should have been outside by the door so at least we had a valet option. It wasn't even cold. Then we got "ordered" to use the elevator on the right by the door lady because the elevators weren't clearly marked.

22 floors upward later, we walked into Fahrenheit. Looking into the bar area, I could see the appeal. There were big windows/doors opened up to the balcony area, the breeze was coming in to the bar. The lights of the beautiful city skyline in front of it. BUT it's nothing a nice hotel in a bigger city where it's typical to have a roof top bar couldn't offer. So this is the 1st establishment in Charlotte that offers it... it just details how behind Charlotte can be (as much as I love my adopted hometown).

Hostess apparently was in crisis mode with another patron who placed a to-go order. From the sound of it, this lady placed an order over an hour ago, and the food still wasn't ready. She must be staying at the hotel, because she said she was tired and she just wanted food and if it's not already cooked, she's fine not eating at this point. YIKE! Not a good sign... shouldn't a situation like this be handled professionally AWAY from the front door by a manager???? 

We got seated promptly, to the left of the entrance, in a side dining area. We walked by several big tables (6+ top). We ended up at a  2-top table in between two big parties. I felt very squeezed in. And by gosh, there was no air circulation. For those who know me personally, you know I am NOT a high maintenance person. But no one should feel uncomfortable in any restauarant, let alone a high end establishment. And NO ONE greeted us. There was no water. Nothing, nada.

By now my friend and I just looked at each other and contemplating leaving. The waiter who was busy handling one of the big tables next to us finally turned to us and acknowledged the fact that we were there. At this point we decided to move ourselves to the bar area. I stopped by the hostess station to inform her of our move. She smiled and said that's ok. 

Well, call me crazy, but shouldn't that be a hint that something went wrong? In that case, shouldn't a manager be informed that guests just moved themselves to the bar for unknown reasons? And thus shouldn't a manager stop by to at least inquire and pretend it mattered?? Instead we got a visit from a waitress. She asked if we didn't get any service, which we said yes. She then said she was afraid that was the case because she saw us and she was about to come over to take care of us. I don't know if it was a case of concern, or a case of table section turf war.

The bartender was... present. That's the best description I could muster. He was there, but he wasn't friendly or attentive. He got us our drinks, took our food order and efficient. 

Food... finally we got to the food. At this point we didn't know if ordering food was a good idea. We talked about going to another place for dinner. But we ended up order the lobster sandwiches ($13) and spring rolls ($9). Food arrived in RECORD TIME. I meant, we ordered, food came. It felt more like the food was already done and we just happened to order it. Food was ok at best. There were 2-3 small pieces of lobster meat on each of the 3 sliders. The minced chicken in the spring rolls were a little dry. 

4 drinks (3 Jim Beam & Coke = $28.50 and 1 Chenin Blanc $8) and 2 small plates set me back $73. It was the worst $73 I spent. 

Words of advise: just because it's new, has pretty view, has a chef's name attached to it does NOT make it a great restaurant automatically.They have much works to do.

The only thing that could've possibly made my meal at The Estate House any worse, is if we had to pay for it...

My bf and I stopped by for a drink on the night of their grand opening about 2 weeks ago... it was beautiful and the staff was pleasant; many of them my bf knew from previous workplaces.  So, he decided to have his birthday dinner there.  BIG MISTAKE!

The meal we had last night was a comedy of errors... First off, there were 12 of us there and the way that they sat us (in the Butler's Pantry) was not ideal for our group.  We took things into our own hands and pushed our 2 tables together to make it easier to talk amongst ourselves.  

Although Roman (I think that was our waiter's name) had good intentions, our service was horrendous!  We had to ask for menus after a half hour of being seated.  We had to ask for bread several times before it arrived probably an hour later, and then some of us (like myself) never even received any bread.  We also had to ask for water and drink refills throughout the 3 HOURS we were there...

The menu itself was extremely pricey and fairly limited.  Not only that, but the menu lists a special 'tasting menu' but somehow it wasn't available yet... nor were there any specials.  We all finally decided and were able to place our order.

One thing that the staff was good at was clearing and bringing back fresh silverware.  I think they moved my silverware around 3 times even though I would've been good with just one set.  Since they cleared my silverware that I hadn't touched before appetizers were finally served, I had no fork even if I wanted to sample from someone else's order... The Wild Arugula Salad that was supposed to arrive with "Warm Camembert," toasted marcona almonds and  blood orange vinaigrette arrived cold and all 3 people that ordered it had to send it back... other appetizers that arrived and some of the people in our party ate were the mussels and the winter squash risotto.  

So, like I said, our reservation was for 7:30 and we were all seated by 7:45... so, when I looked at my watch and saw it was after 9:30. I was a little bit disappointed that our entrees weren't there yet.  After all, we were planning on meeting some other friends for drinks after dinner, and this was taking a really long time.  I think that everyone else at the table was feeling the same way.  We were all hungry and antsy and upset that the waiter or GM hadn't even acknowledged that it was taking a ridiculously long time.  So, the birthday boy spoke up... and asked for the GM.  I think it took another 30 minutes before the GM came over and acknowledged us.  Note - the food was still not there.  He was reactive instead of proactive apologizing but not offering anything.  He asked what we wanted him to do and we all just said to bring our food!  At this point it was 10pm.  He promised it would be there in 5 minutes.  Ron (another member of our group) looked at his watch and 5 minutes later, still no food.  Roman attempted to bring us a bottle of wine, but we didn't even want more to drink at this point...

So, at about 10:10. our food began to arrive in piece meal...  2-3 entrees at a time and several minutes apart.  Many of the entrees were overcooked and had to be sent back and the person that ordered marlin was served tuna by accident so when the person that ordered the tuna didn't have her meal, we figured out their mistake.  The waiter then had the audacity to ask the person that ordered the tuna if she wanted a new one.  (There was already a bite taken out of the tuna that was served in error).  Of course she did!  Unfortunately, we were all done 20 minutes later when the new tuna finally arrived.  I had the "Estate House Fruit De Mer" which was actually pretty good.  (However, at 10pm, anything would've been good in my eyes).  

We basically had to tell the GM that there was no way we were going to pay for this horrendous meal... you would think we'd get apologies again or something, but no.  We left a decent tip for Roman, and never even had birthday cake for the birthday boy... bummer!  At that point we just wanted to get the hell out of there!

Fortunately, we had much better service upstairs at the 3rd floor level bar where they had a piano player until 11pm.  We met some other friends there and attempted to laugh at the miserable meal we'd just had... Side note - Charles Barkley and his wife were also at the restaurant and had a 3 hour meal as well - we know this because we swapped stories over drinks upstairs after the fact.

The Estate House has a lot of kinks to work on... I doubt I will ever return to eat there again... I do recommend going for the ambiance and drinks on the top level.  Gina and Bill will take good care of you there... Aside from that, I would tell you to save your time and $$.

The the foodie fest has changed since it first started. They have much more covered areas with seating and tables but I'm afraid that took up space that was once was occupied by many more food trucks at previous foodie fests here at the Silverton. The seating was desperately needed though so what can ya do?!  I ran into people at the event complaining about paying to get in. I don't have any complaint about paying however it should be cheaper. It seems odd to pay just to get in so you can pay for food but if it were free to get in then I'm sure everyone and their adopted cousin would show up and it would be even more packed and no fun!

We went the first day on Friday, and arrived around 6:00 pm. I was happy to have found a great parking spot right away. I was even happier when I saw there was nobody in line to get in! We had noticed a long line on the way in and thought we would have to wait in it. I asked the cashier at the gate if I was in the right line and she said that we could purchase tickets or show our online ticket so getting in was a snap! The tickets at the gate were $10 per person, $8 for senior citizens, children under 54" were free and that got you a wristband to get in into the foodie fest all 3 days for the one price. They had some trucks taking debit/credit cards but at the gate and most of the food trucks only took ca$h money. The 2nd day we went was Saturday and there was still no line at the gate but the lines inside were insane. I still had a few trucks I wanted to try the 2nd day but wasn't willing to wait 2 plus hours for them so just got something from the few lines that were short. I think it just depends what time and day you show up that determines your experience. They had a carnival off to the side of the foodie fest with rides and games carny food. 

It wasn't busy at first. Well, not including White Castle! They had such a long line. Thank goodness I am not a burger eater because the wait was at times up to 4 hours for White Castle however it did smell good around their tent. I wanted to make a couple rounds to see what I wanted to try.

Slow Cal BBQ:
It smelled too good outside this truck not to try something. There was only one person in front of me so I didn't wait long to order. After pondering the menu board I ordered the "Linker" combo priced at $9. This was a sandwich with hot links, pork and BBQ sauce. You get to choose your BBQ sauce and it is homemade. I chose "Dam Bro" and it was spicy and good! It came with a side so I chose "Red Beans & Rice" and it was full of yummy flavor! I was stoked to find out that they are not just in Cali anymore but also here in Vegas! I will for sure eat from this truck again! During the 2nd day of our visit I stopped by this truck to try their "Cajun Potato Salad" and it was so good!

Torpedo Potato:
After seeing pictures I knew I wanted to try this place! I am also glad I tried it when I did because I had maybe 6 people in front of me but later in the night and the following day that I passed by it was very, very long! I ordered the "Original Tornado" and had them add sour cream & onion and nacho cheese. It cost $7.50 and I loved it! I wish we had one of their trucks here in Vegas!!!!!

Roamin' Dough:
We met up with some friends who wanted to stop at this truck. My friend ordered the "Bacon Wrapped Dates"priced at $5 and they were so darn good! When we came back to the foodie fest the 2nd day I stopped and ordered some and they were just as good as the day before. 

Fluff Ice:
I was checking out another truck and when I came back around the corner I found my hubby in line for this truck. I also found fellow yelper Nelson Q in line behind hubby! It was nice to catch up with Nelson but what was great was the history lesson he gave us about boba! I had no idea what it was or what it tasted like. I wanted to try the "Strawberry Fluff" with blue honey boba. It cost $7 and was huge! It is hard to describe the fluff ice but it is shaved ice with condensed milk and I'm sure something else I just know it was yummy! The boba tasted chewy and kinda like a gummy bear. It was neat to try the boba but I can't say I am a fan. 

Wa Da Pho:
While in line one of the owners told it this was there launching day! They had fancy TVs and ipad looking menus. My friend ordered "Da Pho-licious Q" for us to share. I had high hopes for this truck since it is local and just starting out. The sandwich wasn't that great. I really enjoyed the bread a lot but the meat was so thick that when you went to bite into it the meat all comes out and you are left with just bread. I would try something else from this truck but not this sandwich again.

Deep Fried Vendor:
I didn't see a name for this place it wasn't a truck but a vendor in a booth. They had all sorts of deep fried goodies. I wanted to try the "Deep Fried Reese's Big Cup". It cost $5. I felt the price was too steep but I ate every bite and loved it!

I will be back!

C'est magnifique! 

I was really blown away by the food at March Bacchus!  I'm mad at myself that it took me so long to go and try this place out.  So many missed meals are running through my head right now.  Here were the highlights:

1. The food was amazing and easily 5 stars!  We tried a lot of things and everything we ordered was super tasty and tummy pleasing!  

The meal started for both us us with French Onion Soup.  We each got our own because my hubby knows I don't share French Onion Soup with anyone!  The soup was fantastic! It is easily in my top 5 of all time.  This is saying a lot because I have been to France and ate a lot of French Onion soup while visiting.

My hubby had the wine braised beef and it was really very good.  A knife wasn't even needed to cut the meat because it would just fall apart on it's own.  It was packed with flavor and really was yum-tastic.  

I went with the classic Steak Frites, because it is really one of my go to entrees.  My steak was cooked perfectly and was served with a delicious herb butter that was melting all over it.  The frites or french fries were some of the best I have ever eaten in my life, and i know a thing or two about french fries! To top it off, it came with the most fabulous Barnaise I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.  If it wasn't such a nice spot, I might have licked the ramakin clean because it was that yummy! 

My hubby got Tiramisu for dessert.  I'm not a Tiramisu fan, so I can't say much about it, however the hubs said it was delightful!

2. The atmosphere is beautiful.  The restaurant is set right on one of the lakes in Desert Shores.  You can't beat waterfront dining, especially in the middle of the desert.  I almost forgot that we were in Las Vegas, which makes for a great evening out.  Great great great location!

3. The staff was all very friendly.  Everyone we encountered was smiling, happy, friendly, and helpful.  Yay for happy people!

So with all of this good stuff, why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5?  There were a couple of snafus that made them lose a star.  Here they are:

1. We made reservations ahead of time.  I had mentioned it was our anniversary and we would like nice table.  When we got there, the hostess made a big deal of only having one table left and having to squeeze us in.  The table we got was up against the wall.  The floor around us had some broken glass as well.  It seems to have been missed during a clean up effort, but we could easily see it.  There was also several tables wide open for the entire time we were there right next to the water.  I guess we weren't special enough for those seats.

2. The servers were all super nice, but stretched thin.  When we had our server, she was awesome.  The problem was we had to wait long periods in-between visits because she was so busy.  I don't mind a leisurely dinner, but this was a bit extreme.  Luckily we had made over night babysitting arrangements, otherwise we would have had to leave well before we were done with dinner.

So the food is awesome, the locale is beautiful, and it is a great place for a nice night out, just make sure you booked your babysitter for an extra hour or 2.

I was in my Hometown for the Christmas celebration with my family. My Dad wanted to treat us to an All-You-Can-Eat Friday Night Fish Fry and gave us a couple of places that serve one. It wasn't hard for me to choose. Prairie Lanes was a place that I spent many hours at as a kid. The Bar & Grill part is all new & refurbished, so I wanted to see the new changes. Plus, I remember there not being a menu because of the limited options they had "back in the day". Now, they have a full menu to offer. We made plans to all meet up at 5:30. 

Prairie Lanes has ample parking all around and we found plenty of spots available. They have entrances on the North, South, and smack dab in the middle of the place. The best entrance for the Bar & Grill is the middle. You will find the Bar area immediately. There is a host stand, and they will find you a table or booth. We needed a table for 7 and there was no issue with that. We got a big round one right away. Getting settled in, our server stopped by asking about drinks. I don't think anyone of us knew what we wanted. She offered waters to us all, which we accepted. When she returned with the waters, only two of us had figured out what we wanted to drink. I asked about tap beers and our server grabbed a table tent off a booth to show me. She said she would be back with the two sodas that were asked for. Most choices seemed domestic on the tap list. Our server brought the sodas and started taking our food order at this time. In all, 3 AYCE Fish Fry's, one senior Fish Fry, and two kids meals. I also ordered a High Life on tap. The Fish Fry comes standard with Beer Battered Cod, Salad Bar, Soup Bar, & choice of potato. The choice of potato is French Fries, Baby Reds, or Potato Pancakes. I went with the Pancakes. Alyssa did Baby Reds. 

I checked out this Soup Bar first which is right next to the Salad Bar. They offered up 3 kinds of Soup. Clam Chowder, Chicken Noodle, & Wisconsin Cheese. They also offer bowls & cups for dishing your Soup in. I grabbed a bowl of Clam Chowder and headed back to the table. Alyssa made her way up when I got back. I put a little pepper in my Chowder & dumped in the little packet of oyster crackers offered. Creamy, Hot & Fresh. But as Alyssa put it. It tastes like it came out a bag. It wasn't bad. Just....basic. I went up a second time to try the Chicken Noodle. I did a cup of it. The noodles are big and thick. The broth is flavorful. Hardly any chicken in it. Next up, Salad Bar. This is surprisingly solid. They have all the bases covered on this one. Everything was fresh & full. They had an attendant right there monitoring it. Coleslaw is available here, too.  It's something that I didn't try. 

I was a couple of bites into my salad when our dinners arrived. The Fish looked good. Two pieces of Golden Fried Beer Battered Cod. The Potato Pancakes not so much so. When I think of Potato Pancakes, these I didn't have in mind. They were little McDonald's like Hash Browns. Or Larger Burger King like Hash Rounds. Take your pick. Tasted like 'em, too. Straight out the freezer. Slid out the bag. Into the fryer. They tried to make them authentic by providing Applesauce & Syrup to dip them into. The Baby Reds Alyssa got were nice. They looked pan fried. The Cod Loins were cooked too much. Cutting in, they clumped instead of flaked away. Biting down, you knew it. Firm. Not tender. It's one of those thing where it's not bad, just not good. Seeming that they only offer one kind of Cod, Deep Fried. They should be able to handle cooking it the right time. Ah well. There's always the reorder, right? Those were overcooked as well. Not burned, just over done. By 2 or 3 minutes. When I mentioned this later, everyone who ordered Fish thought the same thing. I had to ask for lemon, as for that didn't come with the supper, but tartar sauce did. It tasted fine, just seemed like it came out the bottle.

Our server was so very patient with us. When we were indecisive of drinks, she didn't blink an eye. She was always checking up on us. Awesome job by her. The AYCE Friday Night Fish Fry costs $11.99 here. Could be worth it, if the Cod is cooked proper. For what we got, it's a little steep. The menu here is nice. They have a burger that me, living in the Twin Cities, was surprised to see. The Juicy Lucy. While it might not be the way I'd spell it (Jucy Lucy), it sure was a welcome to see. I tried to get someone at the table to order one, to no avail. Probably a good thing. I'll take 'em out for an authentic one when they come to visit us.

Where do I even begin! When I first heard of a Mexican Asian restaurant opening up, I had no idea what to expect but I figured that since I like both cuisines, I would probably enjoy it. I was right. They did a great job fusing the cuisines. In fact, what took the relationship so long to bloom!? 

Ambiance:

Looks are deceiving and the exterior of this place looks nothing like the interior. From the outside, you'd think it just looks like any other generic restaurant, but don't be deceived. Step through the doors and you immediately enter this open, airy and trendy restaurant that even has a real tree hanging out in the middle of the restaurant...yes a tree! I especially found the pictures of random people on the chairs pretty entertaining. The restaurant itself has a combination of a wrap around bar and then dining area. Make a reservation to be on the safe side! This is great spot for a night out with friends, a double date or event a spot to get a couple cocktails and apps! 

Food & Drinks: 

Now, moving on to the most important part, food and drinks! First, the drinks. I enjoyed the Passion Fruit sangria and boy does that pack a punch! I expected it to be sweet, but instead it was pretty potent...in a good way! Next, the food. This restaurant is all about sharing the plates and it's nice because that means you can try much more! Everything on the menu looked delicious, so our group of four ordered it all! 

Guacamole - they serve up some of the most unique guacamole choices I've ever seen! We decided to order the Lump Crab Guacamole. I'm ruined because I don't think I will ever be able to enjoy "regular" guacamole again. It was the perfect amount of crab and the key lime added a tasty twist. The only downfall was that it only came with four tortilla chips and if you wanted to order more, it was $1 more per order of chips. The guacamole is already $14, so with the additional chips, it made for a pricey appetizer! 

Rock Shrimp Tempura - I'm such a fan of rock shrimp and especially when it has some Asian flavoring to it. This dish was anything but disappointing and I could have gobbled this dish up all by myself! The rock shrimp tempura comes with a variety of veggies including tomatoes and green beans. The summer mayo had the perfect flavorful kick to it. I want my own order next time!

Rollo Chingon Sushi Roll (cooked) - This roll comes with grilled shrimp, guacamole, jalapeno and has a balsamic strawberry glaze. See where they do a good job fusing the two cuisines? I had no idea I was eating a Mexican food sushi roll because it tasted delicious! It came with eight bites and was great for sharing.

Suzuki Roll - This roll was another great Mexican Asian combo with spicy tuna, avocado, and then a chipotle aioli! They have eight bites in a roll so this was another good one to share and very flavorful. 

Summer Corn - order this! I loved it and could have eaten it all on my own. The spiced popcorn on top of the corn created an interesting yet flavorful kick to it! 

Bacon Wrapped Dates - an order comes with six, so there's plenty to share however you will want more than one! These little guys are so good! The combination of salty bacon and sweet date compliments each other perfectly.

Half Lobster _ Crab Dynamite - order this but be warned, you won't want to share! This was the best thing I ate on the menu! 

After my experience, I would say that my top three favorite things I ate were the rock shrimp, corn and lobster/crab. I would order the three items next time but I would probably order the lobster as my own entree next time. It's that good!

07/05/12 

Had two Voice Daily Deals ($10 for $30) to use up before the 14th, so I asked my young cousin to meet me for dinner.  I'd never eaten here before, but I know from the reviews that it's popular for happy hour.  Indeed, the HH menu sounds fantastic, and so do the prices.  However, these certificates were only good for dinner, and so here we were.  But first, about the location-- it's tucked away a bit, away from the road, so don't blink, or you might miss it.  There are many parking spaces, so that's not an issue unless you're there for HH.  (If you are, then come early.)  FB has a small patio area that looks promising, if only it was decorated a little better.  I remember seeing two tables, but cousin remembers four.  I don't think there are misters to help keep cool.  Inside, it's even smaller.  I would say about six tables of two- and four-tops, and about five to six seats at the beautiful blue-tiled bar.  Sit here to maximize on atmosphere, have questions about the wines or cocktails, and if you want to be entertained by the staff.

My cousin doesn't drink, so she had water, while I tried the guava mojito.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=pCA97HLAPYRN0bJTQUs1Pw#pCA97HLAPYRN0bJTQUs1Pw  It tasted like a regular mojito, but a bit sweeter.  It's alright- nothing fantastic.  Maybe I'll try a regular one, without the added flavorings, during HH one of these days.  After poring through the menu and asking our server Steve (who is also the bartender) about the dinner special (ribeye), I found I could only try ONE item, since everything else had allergens all over the entrees (shellfish, corn, guacamole, bell peppers, dijon reduction, etc.), instead of just added on top, and so I ordered the Natural Farm Chicken Breast, with tomatillo sauce, pico de gallo, goat cheese, and bacon. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=o8X2VwUplwqRZfvuQUunDA#o8X2VwUplwqRZfvuQUunDA  My cousin ordered the ribeye special, with mushrooms and a dijon reduction.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=fMtwu_Aw8ynU-gaOspzWWQ#fMtwu_Aw8ynU-gaOspzWWQ  Entrees come with your choice of two sides from the following choices: green chile cornbread casserole, jalapeno creamed corn, sauteed organic green beans, chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes, and maple-glazed carrots.  Cousin chose the cornbread and creamed corn, and I asked for the green beans and mashed potatoes.

Cousin LOVED everything on her plate!  She especially liked the cornbread.  I enjoyed my dish, as well.  I liked how spicy it was, which may turn some people off, but I thought everything worked well together, especially the addition of the goat cheese, which helped to cut the spiciness.  I say add more cheese!  Loved the bacon bits, as well.  The green beans were sauteed to perfection-- nice green color and crisp, and not greasy.  We both thought the mashed potatoes were very tasty!  It's a good thing I liked the dish, since it's the only one I can order, unless they offer something new as a special.  

We were too stuffed to order dessert, and it's a good thing, too, since out of the five choices (Ancho chocolate torte, Banana burrito, Kahlua creme brulee, Horchata bread pudding, and Homemade Key Lime pie), I could only have the brulee, and I wasn't feeling like creme brulee that evening.  

Prices were too high for me to consider dining here for dinner without a discount.  Now, it's one thing if the menu is all-organic, but it isn't.  Service was attentive and friendly, so that's a plus.  Loved the intimate setting, but only if I can sit at the bar- we sat at a table.

07/12/12

Came back solo to use up the second certificate.  This time I sat at the lovely blue-tiled bar, even though the seat wasn't too comfortable, especially after leaving a massage session...  It was great fun speaking with bartender Steve and server Kevin.  "T-Bone" was nice, too -- he always made sure to open the door for guests.

Had the chicken breast again http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=P_dIQjZufh2dJ6m_rjYmTA#P_dIQjZufh2dJ6m_rjYmTA, with a glass of sauvignon blanc, and the Kahlua creme brulee.  The chicken is as good as I remembered it, but this time there was even less goat cheese!  However, the creme brulee made up for it.  The best part of the dessert were the caramel and chocolate sauces that accompanied it.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HGvNE87fvK5PwKMZBDkTbA?select=tmq5bH42X_to8nG9fuT6yg#tmq5bH42X_to8nG9fuT6yg  Mmm!  I'd like to have these over ice cream, but not the Thrifty ice cream that accompanies many of the dessert plates offered here.  (Sorry, but I cannot have products that use corn syrup.  Besides, I'd rather have ice cream made from high-quality ingredients, and carrageenan and corn syrup, high fructose or otherwise, aren't.)

Thanks for honoring the Voice Daily Deals, FB!  I'll be back with family and friends for happy hour, maybe.

Yay - I see I'm the first to review the first Arizona franchise of "the leader of the salad revolution." I'd heard of Tossed before (maybe because it was voted "NYC's best salad" by New York Magazine.) Or, maybe because my friend opened a similar concept called Dressed in Atlanta... either way, I'm the kind of girl that loves a big salad for lunch, and I'm psyched to have a place like tossed here in Arizona...

As of today, October 10, Tossed has been open just over a week. So I know I can't be too tough on them... when we went a few days ago, they were still getting used to being open. Even so, it was a positive experience.  The space itself is pretty large for a salad restaurant.  I think it used to be an Arizona Bread Company - I hope it does well at this location as I'd love for it to stay!

I was with my brother; I asked if he'd join me for lunch at tossed since I really wanted to try it.  We walked in and figured out to go to the side that was to order in (as the other side was for catering and take out orders) - it was kind of confusing, but we later learned (from Gazwan Paulus, the Area Developer) that bigger signs are on their way.

Since I'd picked up one of the tossed menus before we went, we both were somewhat familiar with it, but it still took me a few minutes at the register to design my own salad from their huge list of ingredients.  Zack chose from the list of "specialty salads and creative interpretations of familiar favorites" and ordered the Southwest Blackened Chicken Salad.  I finally chose my unique combo of greens, chick peas, chopped tomato, avocado, turkey, and maybe celery.  I also suggested to Zack that we order one of their whole wheat crepes (that are made fresh in the store to create crepe wrap sandwiches) to share.  After we ordered and payed, we were given a # to bring to the table - I do like the fast casual concept.  However, it was not until after we ordered that we were able to actually see all of the ingredients in front of us - I may have chose differently after seeing everything laid out in front of me...

Regardless, it was only a matter of minutes before  our beautiful salads were delivered to us.  Presentation was beautiful, service was friendly, and best of all, our salads were delicious!  I'd taken the suggestion from Tori (the girl who took our order) to taste the Strawberry Balsamic Vinaigrette as my dressing and it was delicious - Thanks again, Tori!  We were both pleased with what we ordered; the crepes were a light, chewy, unique texture that we both really enjoyed as well.  Somehow a bite or two of cheese made it into my salad which isn't the end of the world, but I knew I hadn't ordered it- I'll let it go since they are still so new.

There are a ton of other salads that I look forward to designing at tossed and I cannot wait to go back for more!  You may want to check it out online before you go as the menu can be a bit overwhelming.  Prices range from $6.95 - $10.95 but can get even more expensive if you like to add a ton of ingredients.  I'd plan on spending about $10 per person on average.  Not so bad... oh, and they also soup, smoothies, and sweet treats including freshly baked cookies, brownies, and fruit - there is something for everyone.

As we were leaving, we met the Area Developer I spoke of above and he was really nice... he wanted to make sure we had a good experience and he told us of their plans to build locations of tossed all around the Valley.  I hope they will consider coming to Old Town because that's where I'll be soon!

So I just got back from Vegas...... and you know that anytime anyone who goes to Vegas and back always have a new review posted shortly.  (You don't understand how excited I am to be back just so that  I can write this review for you...LOL!)  So without any further delays, let me share with you what I've discovered while I'm there for a very short, quick, and fun weekend!

COSMOPOLITAN.... A brand spanking new hotel sitting right next to Bellagio, has finally opened up it's doors to the glitzy lights of Vegas.  Even though this review is not about COSMO, let me tell you a little bit about it....  This is a Marriott created hotel (NOT part of the City Center / MGM Group), it's got the Planet Hollywood hip feel to it, but man... the design was just to...CRAMMED!  They try to squeeze so much decor into this place that they made it feel so small!  Anyway, there is your sneak peak into COSMO... please do read my future reviews on this place... (Or check it out yourself!)

So the highlight of this review of course is the Wicked Spoon Buffet.  Like what I would usually do now once I'm at a location I'll check in on yelp and try to read the reviews prior.  So before deciding to give this place a try I found out that it's a Tapas-Style buffet.  I was like "huh?" but let me tell you... what an awesome concept this place is!!!

So we went for lunch (The dinner the night before was insane with lines snaking throughout the buffet so decided to delay my experience)  No lines at 2:30pm, got in immediately, and off to the food we went...

Let's start with the drinks like how a normal meal would go... we asked for ice tea, coke, lemonade, and water... all were normal except for the water!  It was Aquahealth water (http://www.aquahealth.com/)...Never heard of it but it was some really delicious dispensed water!  (Very much like Voss Water for those of you have tried that before!)

The food was simply crazy!  Everything pretty much was served in small portions but all in miniature cookwares!  (small pots and pans, frying basket, etc.)  So the presentation was 5 stars right there!

Food was decent tasting.... (sweet potato fries in small basket, dungeonese crab claws on porcelain dishes, white truffle risotto in an All-Clad like sauce pan (mini-version!) and many many more!  Unfortunately I can tell you everything I've had simply because there were no names but a description in front of each of the servings (much like an high-end restaurant), but all the food tasted pretty good and you can definitely tell that they focused on the quality and not just quantity.  The only complaint that I would have with this place is properly the warmth of the food served... again, this place was opened 10 days ago so I'm gonna let that go...(thus the -1 star)  I'm sure that once they have everything in place things will be simply awesome!  (But they do have a pretty decent selection of food available all in Tapas-Style servings!)

The mini-dessert island is no joke!  Everything was all attention to detail oriented so it's awesome to see it being displayed!   But their highlights of the dessert island was the following in my personal opinion...

Madelines:  Mini madelines super buttery yet soft!  OMG.... it is one of the best I've had and it's super cute!  Tiny and delicious!!! (great poppers!)

Gelato Bar:  10 flavors to choose from!  Al delicious and not overly sweet!  (Like They Cup in City Center)  Great flavor and just right!  Served in mini cones!

Chocolate Dipped Strawberries:  THE BIGGEST AND SWEETEST Choco-dipped strawberries I've seen in my life!  And it was simply the best period...  Imagine... wait staff on their break getting some food to the back breakroom..... what's on their plate?  Only Choco-dipped Strawberries....  Gotta Get'em All!!!!!  You will not regret trying this for sure!

Finally, the service was awesome!  Our waitress was super nice, attentive, and very accommodating!  Again I can't imagine how they will be once they are finally all in sync with this place say a month from now...  It's gonna be awesome and I'm already looking forward to it!  So kudos to the awesome service training!

One ending high note.... we spoke with one of the managers Jackie (totally funny, awesome, and again, accommodating to the max!)  She mentioned that currently her head chef is driving her nuts!  He is literally creating new dishes on the fly on almost a daily basis (in 10 days of opening they had 7 menu change!)  She said that so many locals came here several days in a roll just to see what's new the next day!  That is simply crazy, I personally don't think they can keep that up, but if they do... I will almost have to rank them higher than my all time favorite Sterling Buffet...

So... let's get the food hot and tasty, and keep the inspirations flowing on a daily basis.... Wicked spoon....I'm hoping that you can be my new number one on my buffet favorites list!  Trust me... that will be some accomplishment!

Wickedly Awesome!

I saw a lot of mixed reviews on Burger Bar (both for this location and the one in San Francisco), but I was still eager to try it after seeing it featured on Top Chef Masters.

It actually took some time to find it.  Burger Bar is not located in Mandalay Bay but Mandalay Place, which is a little shopping mall adjacent to the casino.  It was late in the morning (just before 11:00am) and the mall was pretty empty.  When Burger Bar opened though, there were quite a few groups waiting to go in.

The atmosphere was kind of like a chain family restaurant without all the kitsch and decorations.  The atmosphere was loud, casual and comfortable, but there was nothing to it.  The dining area was not that big.  Seating was available via tables, booths and the bar.

The focus on the menu, of course, was burgers and fries.  While it was expensive for burgers and fries, it did not feel expensive for Las Vegas.  Many menu items were less than $20 and gourmet burgers do go in the $12-$18 range in L.A.  At Burger Bar, there are a few pricier burgers and burgers can be customized with some fancy ingredients (like lobster) that can lead to some really pricey burgers.

I went with the American Kobe Beef burger.  The burger was about small-to-medium sized.  A lot of burger places like The Counter and Father's Office definitely have bigger burgers.  The bun (which can be customized) was nice.  The tomatoes, green leaf lettuce and onions were fresh, but they were very ordinary.  I got some cheese, which was an extra cost, and some homemade Dijon mustard.  The meat had a good flavor and was juicy (also not too greasy).  It was not anything great, but it was a decent, okay burger.

I ordered some of the fat fries, which the waitress recommended.  Skinny fries and sweet potato fries were also available.  I liked the fries, but they were not as hot as they should have been, which was kind of odd.  Since they just opened the restaurant, I was surprised the fries tasted like they had been sitting around for a while.  I've definitely had my share of food in Vegas that was served cold, but I would think this place would have a higher standard.

The milkshake was expensive but good.  It was a chocolate and Nutella milkshake.  It had a good flavor and consistency.  It could have been a little colder.  It was topped with crunchy hazelnuts, chocolate syrup and chocolate whipped cream.  It was definitely heavy on the chocolate and probably could have used something contrasting to balance the shake out.  While I liked the shake, the portion was a little on the small side.

The waitress was very good--attentive, informed about the menu and friendly.

There is a lot of bad and overpriced food in Vegas because the casinos know they have a captive audience and they let their standards slip.  Burger Bar, while not great, is definitely better than some of the Vegas restaurants I've tried.  It also presents a better value (though maybe slightly overpriced, considering the size of portions, when compared to some burger joints in other major cities).  Still, if you go to one of those cafes in Vegas, you are probably going to spend right around the same amount for a burger.

I probably would not make a special trip to Burger Bar, but if we were around Mandalay Bay again, needed some food and weren't looking to spend too much, Burger Bar would definitely be a place I would give another try.

Final Note: For me, celebrity chef restaurants often feel more like a brand than a representation of the chef's food because the chef is hardly ever there.  Chef Hubert Keller was there that day; he was not in the kitchen though.  He was having a meeting (outside of the restaurant in the mall area).

I bought a yelp deal ($10 for $20) a few months back for this place not knowing they weren't open yet. Kind of frustrating that they would post the deal and not even be open, but it did say at the bottom of the yelp listing it was "coming soon" so I will take the blame. Their Facebook page said they would be opening the following month, but that never happened. I reached out to Caf Casera by e-mail to see if they had any updates on when they would be opening. The owner responded promptly and said they were working out some last minute things and should be open soon and they would let me know when they opened. The owners word was kept, I received a e-mail letting me know they were opening and ready for customers. It took me a couple weeks after receiving the e-mail to make my way over, but with as long as I waited already what was a couple more weeks? 

Walking in hubby and I were greeted and given menus right away. originally, we planned to eat inside the restaurant, but the fountain machine wasn't set up yet and they only had cans of soda ($1) and bottled water ($1.25) so we decided to order our food to-go and get drinks from a gas station. What a bummer because they had Cherry Coke! I spoke with one of the owners, Julie who said they were waiting for the "Coke man" to come hook it up. I had a wonderful conversation with Julie who also introduced me to her husband and mother-in-law. I could tell while talking to Julie, just how genuinely passionate her and her family are about the food they are serving. She told me how they are there at 5 am each morning making everything from scratch including the corn and flour tortillas that are all personally made by her mother-in-law. 

Some of the menu items here will be something you have seen before at other restaurants, but I promise you Caf Casera puts there own twist on each dish and I personally haven't ever tasted anything like it. I have never heard of "Sizzle" which is the specialty here, so I obviously had to try it! 

Sizzle Tacos ($7.95) - Seasoned ground pork and beef, onions, cabbage and cheese sauce inside 2 crunchy taco shells. The taco shells tasted amazing! They had such a fresh flavor and weren't greasy at all. The stuff inside the shell is an acquired taste for sure. I thought it was alright, but can't say I would order it again. Hubby took a bite and thought it was the best thing out of everything we ordered and he ended up switching me his Bean & Cheese Burrito for it. The burrito was so good! The flour tortillas here aren't your average flour tortilla, they are a bit thicker. The beans and rice were great. The beans are thick and the rice has a nice flavor, nothing dry or mushy about it.

Cheese Quesadilla ($2.25) - The menu says it is grilled with Colby cheese inside, but honestly it tasted more like Velveeta cheese. The cheese was very pasty. The tortilla was kind of burnt on the outside too. After two bites I was done, I just didn't like it. 

Sopaipilla ($2.75) - Yes! This was great. I have had different versions, but not one like this before. They put cinnamon and powdered sugar on it and it can easily be shared. It does have a sweet flavor, so if sweet things aren't your style you can try one plain. I enjoyed the sweet flavor and would order it again. 

As I sat there waiting for my food to be prepared, I noticed the menu boasted that the dishes were prepared with a "New Mexico Flair" so if you want green chile they can add it for 75 cents. It confused me because if the dish is prepared with New Mexico Flair, wouldn't it already have the green stuff in it? Julie was kind enough, because I forgot to order the chile on my tacos, to give me 2 free sides of it. This was awesome green stuff indeed! Hubby was just eating it with a fork, cold and all. I do wish the chile came warm and was already included with the food, since the food is prepared when you order it, a customer could just say they don't want it on there. Oh well they were gooooood!

The inside was very clean and the decor was nice. There are about 4 tables inside if you don't want to take your food to-go. Caf Casera also offers breakfast burritos on their menu. Purchase a yelp deal and give this family run business a try! 

Mon - Sat .... 7 am until 10 pm
Sunday - Closed

Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas, Carlo's Bakery! I ate at Buddy V's a couple weeks ago and one of the managers stopped at our table to check on us. After letting him know I was a "Cake Boss" fan, he let me know when the bakery would be opening and that contestants from "Next Great Baker" would be there. I obviously cleared my schedule for opening day! Carlo's Bakery (located inside The Venetian) is literally right across from Buddy V's and the pathway between them is a little more narrow than usual, so I wondered about how they were going to tame the long lines because there was no way there wouldn't be one.  

The grand opening was at 6 pm, so I wanted to get there early hoping to beat some of the crowd. I had my hubby and 2 nieces with me and we arrived to Carlo's Bakery around 5 pm to find a long line formed already. Venetian security had a field day with this one! We found our place at the end of the line and even though there were a lot of people in front of us, the line only grew l-o-n-g-e-r behind us. I was thankful for the spot we had after seeing just how long the line got! I appreciated that we were given samples from Carlo's employees while we waited. So let me talk about the wait. WOW! It was almost a 4 hour wait from the time we first got in line and actually got inside the bakery. I know that is a long time, but it wasn't so bad with all the activity going on around us. Between the free samples and seeing people from Next Great Baker and Cake Boss go by and stop to talk to us and take pictures, it didn't feel like 4 hours and honestly was a freaking blast! Hubby was a real trooper holding our spot in line while we would take off to get our picture with Buddy, Grace, Danny, Mary and people from NGB. 

Poor Buddy! He really didn't have the proper help keeping people back (like I said the pathway is a little more narrow than usual) and at one point they did have a line to meet him, but they had to stop it because so many people were crowding around and there wasn't a clear path for the people walking by who had no idea what Carlo's Bakery even was lol. At one point, Buddy came back for pictures and my nieces and I were able to get a picture. After the picture, Buddy gave one of my nieces a great big hug and a kiss on her forehead. She was SO excited smiling bright and cried a little saying "I'm never washing my face again" ...bless her precious young heart! They both had a blast and it's one experience they will never forget, myself included!

One inside the bakery, we were greeted and the girl who helped us was very friendly and helpful. it was kind of crazy inside the bake shop with people, so I just randomly picked out different things I could see. Ordering was quick, but getting what I ordered took a bit. While we waited (maybe 10 minutes) the sweet smell inside was heaven and I liked the open windows showing the bakers working. They have these windows not just inside the bakery, but outside too. When my name was called I went up to pay for my order and saw everything was packaged nicely. This was a great experience and I will most definitely be back!

Lobster Tails ($5.95) - Excellent! Try this! It's flaky with a cream inside and a little Bailey's Irish Cream. This was my favorite of what I tried. 

Eclair ($2.50) - This was cut if half and had a filling. It also had chocolate on top. This was pretty good. I thought at first site that it didn't have enough chocolate on it, but the chocolate was thick and the right amount.

Cream Puff ($2.50) - Custard filled with powdered sugar on top. I took a bite and thought it was good, so I told hubby to try it and he finished it. Glad I at least got a bite!

Chocolate Cannoli ($3/Mini) - This I figured I would like, but I ended up loving it! The amount of filling was decent. I'd order this one again.

Cannoli ($2.50/mini) - The filling has a ricotta cream with chocolate chips. I did like this one a lot and would eat it again, but I personally preferred the chocolate cannoli.

Strawberry Tart ($2.85) - This was my least favorite. If you do try this, I would recommend eating it soon. When I got home with my box, the strawberry tart looked like it melted a bit and the strawberry slid off. None of that really bothered me because I hadn't had it before and didn't know it wasn't something that didn't travel well. The way it tasted did bother me though, The bottom was rock hard and I had trouble even biting into it. I might try it again in the future, but am in no rush.

Chocolate Fudge Cupcake ($3.50) - I had the option between a vanilla or chocolate cupcake and chose the chocolate. It had a chocolate fudge frosting with sprinkles on top. This was just average. Not bad, but not great.

Carrot Cupcake ($3.50) - Of the 2 cupcakes I tried, this was the best. The cupcake was moist and the cream cheese frosting was very good. 

They also have merchandise for sale (mugs, cookbooks, etc.) and take special orders for cakes and other goodies.

Oh, St. Francis, how can you get is so right, but so wrong all at the same time?!?!?

I particularly love their HH menu with delicious meal choices stolen right from their regular menu for under $10 and $5 cocktails before 6pm every day, even on weekends. To have a great HH in Cenpho, you've got to have good food options and good drink options, not just one or the other. 

I've ordered close to half of the items on their menu and hands down, my favorite is the chicken salad sandwich. I usually order it sans toast, and without the bread. The dressing on the chicken salad is delicious, but slightly over powering, so I also suggest asking for half of the dressing. I also enjoy the Meatball appetizer, but I would suggest sharing this one with a couple of people. It's basically two or three big meatballs, while delicious, I've usually had enough after one and am ready for my chicken salad.

I always enjoy their vegetables; they're oh so delicious, perhaps even up in the amazing category. This has been hit or miss for me, but I usually try to get them to serve whatever their vegetable is that day. I enjoy St Francis for their fresh and delicious flavors, they can do some great things with veggies here, the trouble is they don't ever seem to want me ordering them. I'm at about 50 / 50 when it comes to them subbing out veggies for the fries, so when they don't seem to want to accommodate, I generally get the side salad instead. They usually give me some response like, the kitchen can't make you a side of vegetables, that dish comes with either fries or a side salad, and I ultimately give in on the salad. 

Honestly, why do you need to be so b*tchy about subbing out fries for vegetables, as if there is no kitchen back there. I'm not asking for free food, charge me for the change and call it a day. Is it impossible for you to imagine someone might NOT want to eat fries!?!?! 

On one occasion, I was here with a large party of 15 or so for a birthday meal. We made reservations and requested that separate checks be accommodated; well, it appears there was a breakdown between the person who made the reservation and the wait staff who apparently don't like doing separate checks. They refused to accommodate this request, and it started to get awkward. I was not looking to make a big deal out of it, I took care of the bill myself, and went on about our evening without upsetting the nights festivities, but that could have been handled better, much, much better than me paying for everything myself.

A few notes to St. Francis operations.
Why is it so difficult for your staff to accommodate something other than fries with a chicken salad sandwich? You're a restaurant, you make food, I want food, please make me the food, so I can eat the food and leave happy.

Why take a reservation with the stipulation of accommodating separate checks and then have your wait staff groan about how they can't do separate checks?

Staff should be accommodating where they can, I don't feel I'm being unreasonable here to expect to be able to order what I want to order, and pay how I want to pay.

I guess the moral of this story is, if you want to come with a large group, they will probably make a big deal out of it, so be prepared. If you want to change up your meal with something as *crazy* as vegetables, good luck. With all that in mind, I still think St. Francis is one of my favorite spots. I'll be back by myself for sure, I might even bring my friends, but only if I'm planning on covering the check.


Happy Yelping Phoenix!

SHUT IT DOWN!

I was incredibly disappointed when we went to grab dinner here last night. Chef Ramsey would have been so upset at the lack of customer respect. It was like they really didn't care. And I found this unacceptable. 

The hostess took us to our table which was a very cool table but it was not very comfortable for our group to have dinner at. It was so low, that there was no way we could even eat or cut our meat. If we were just drinking then we would have hung out here all night. I asked the hostess for a booth, which was right next to the original table. 

She told me that the 4 empty booths were reserved and we couldn't sit there. I asked the hostess how embarrassed would she be if we sat at the uncomfortable table and no one showed up for those 4 booths in the next hour.  She ignored me and didn't respond. 

She then told me that this was the only table we could have. The sad part is that 60% of the tables were empty and she refused to seat us anywhere else.  I told her I wanted to speak to the manager. She went back to the hostesses station told the other girl and the second hostess rolled her eyes. Honestly I'm the customer.  I don't need to see that. The hostess made a phone call to the manager, who never picked up his phone.  She then went in the back and when she came back she gave us one of the booths we had requested. Wow! What changed?

First, why did it take me 10 minutes to get a booth in a restaurant that was only 40% full. Secondly, I asked to speak to the manager and the manager never came out. Why? Completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Really where is the manager and why didn't he come over to talk to us. 

On a side note: At 10:22pm, we were seated and at 12:19am the booths were still empty.  In fact, nobody ever sat in any of those booths for almost 2 hours. It became apparent that the hostess completely lied to us by telling us they were reserved. Who is training the staff to act like this?

Plus we sat at our table with no service for about 10 minutes. I believe the hostesses probably thought it was funny to send no one over.  We all discussed leaving but decided to stay. 

At 11:52pm all of the lights went full blast, during our meal. It was so bright it hurt our eyes. I spoke to the guy cleaning the tables and he went to speak to the manager and the lights went back down after 5 minutes.  We were just trying to finish our dinner. He came back and said, "the manager had no idea who turned all the lights on!" I think the manager might need a visit from GR and he may have his lights turned on. The waitress told us the lights go full blast every night at that time. I think it must be on a timer, like last call for alcohol. But it should not blast all the lights in the dinning areas. It was not a fun feeling as we ate our dinners. 

My first drink didn't look like the picture in the iPad menu. And I was told by the waitress that the drinks never look like the photos in the iPad. Then why do we have photos of the drinks in the iPad? Again this is wrong and not right. GR would be screaming at someone. 

I went to order another drink at 12:00am but was informed that the bar was closed. I said really and why didn't someone tell us it was last call. There was no response. I told the waitress that I was just having a wheat beer and it shouldn't be a problem to pour a pint. All the bartenders were still there. She went to ask and came back with my pint but I noticed that the Orange slice was missing and about an inch of beer was also missing.  I asked where was the orange slice (this beer is suppose to come with it) and I was told that it was wrapped in Saran Wrap and put away. I asked her to grab me a slice and she said that it wouldn't be possible. Why is this dinner so painful?

I'm so mad that I haven't even got to reviewing the food yet.  The best thing we had here was the fingerling potatoes. It was a side dish but it was the star of the show. My buddy was not happy with his lamb. It was covered in a cheese and he felt it was over powering. I liked my PEI mussels and clams but didn't love them. They came with chorizo, carmelized fennel and lemon zest. I've had better mussel dishes elsewhere. I will say that the shellfish was fresh and only two clams had some sand in them. 

Would I come back here again? Probably never! So you're saying there's a chance? I would only probably ever eat here if Chef Ramsey was actually here running it. This place needs to be on one of those Restaurant Rescue Food shows and its only been open 4 months. I was also informed by the staff that GR had only been there 5 times in the last 4 months, since this location opened. If that is true then, he really needs to spend some time here fixing the many issues. I think the loser of Hell's Kitchen might be running this place?

I let my love of GR influence my choice to stay! Next time I will follow my brain and not my heart. We should have all walked.

Amlee Chinese Cuisine is a local family run business. They have been in business for over 30 years. I remember eating here when I was a teenager and really enjoying the food and lunch specials at Amlee Chinese Cuisine. After going to the movies at nearby Galaxy last week we passed by here so, I suggested to hubby that we come back and try this place and see if it was still as good as I remembered. With a fellow yelper in tow we headed for dinner here last night and wasn't disappointed. 4.5 stars!

Walking in we were greeted and taken to our seats. Water and menus were brought right to our table right away. We shared "family style" and picked out somethings we all like. Food is brought out on a cart and served to you. 

Fried Wontons ($5.95) - These came 12 per order and I liked them. Light, yet crunchy with a small bit of chicken in the center. It came with a sweet and sour and spicy mustard dipping sauces. 

Szechuan Chicken Salad ($10.95) - Yum! The salad was tossed in front of us. The portion was huge and there was plenty to go around. I really liked the flavor of the dressing best and the fresh carrots stood out.

Vegetable Fried Rice ($8.95) - I felt there could have been a little more flavor in this dish. The size was perfect especially if sharing, but the carrot and peas didn't really stand out flavor-wise. The rice was cooked just right though.

Szechuan Beef ($16.95) - So good! The beef was so tender and the whole dish together just tasted great. The huge fresh mushrooms were tasty.

Orange slices were brought to each of us at the end of the meal. I felt the charge of $3.95 for a soda was steep. Free refills, but almost the price of an appetizer. The service was great and we left full and pleased! The owner stopped to talk to us for a moment and she's genuinely passionate about the type of food they are putting out as well the type of service they provide.

They offer delivery so call to check the areas they cover. You can also place your order for pick-up if you don't want to dine inside. They have lunch specials that range in price from $7.95, $8.95, $9.95 and $10.95 depending on what you order and it includes soup, egg roll and choice of steamed or egg fried rice.

I came to Fogo during Restaurant Week 2013. After trying to make a reservation the first weekend of restaurant week, I was denied because they were already booked. Since this was going to be one of my birthday meals, hubby said to call back and ask for something towards the end of the week so he could take the day off for it. I called back asked about Friday, August 30th (last day of restaurant week) and the woman on the phone said 2 pm was available so I reserved the spot. When we arrived on the 30th the parking lot seemed dead. For a place that was booked the weekend before, why did it seem nobody was here? I soon got my answer on the front door. They stop serving lunch at 2 pm and pick dinner back up at 5 pm. Fogo called as well e-mailed me conforming the reservation, so I was baffled. 

Entering Fogo we were greeted and taken to our table. We sat for a few minutes and then our drink order was taken. I then headed to the salad bar where I was surprised at how some stuff looked very fresh and other stuff looked like it had been sitting there untouched for a while. There was food scattered about along the salad bar and the ranch dressing had a ladle from another dressing inside of it and the ranch ladle was just laying on the counter. I avoided having ranch (my fav) on my salad because there was just too much of a mixture of who knows what inside of it. I went with a few things that looked fresh like tomato, mozzarella, croutons, parmesan and the basil dressing I put on it was delicious. 

I wasn't able to have anymore salad, but will explain about that later. So, the meats started coming. The servers were nice, but I don't know if they understood us or what. I told them what type of meat I would like and they would bring something else. They asked how I liked my filet and I said closer to well-done and I get brought a piece of raw red meat. The meat was seriously hit or miss. Some pieces were either very flavorful and tender while others were too raw or nothing but grizzle. The best thing here isn't the beef, but the sausage and bacon wrapped chicken. They do cook those 2 things right and the bacon wrapped chicken might just be the best I have ever eaten. Included with the meal were sides. The 'Mashed Potatoes" were just average. The "Cheese Bread" was dry and disgusting. The cheese bread tasted like a old biscuit. The "Carmalized Bananas" were actually very good, but the "Crispy Polenta" wasn't for me. I don't know if this experience was due to the time of our reservation or not. I wouldn't have even picked the time if it weren't suggested to me by Fogo. 

Then dessert came. Fogo claims the "Papaya Cream" is their most requested dessert. Most requested by who?? Sure it looks pretty upon presentation, but this dessert had zero flavor. I could have opened a jar of baby food (the dessert was that consistency) and tasted more flavor. Everyone at my table left their dessert unfinished. 

Too bad I didn't try more from the salad bar before we got cut off. The server came to our table and said that the salad bar was going to be closing so the employees could eat. WTH?!?!?!?!?!?!? The RW menu price was $30.13 and included an all you can eat salad bar, endless meats and a dessert. By this time we had only been seated maybe 20 minutes and were the only customers. I felt like we were the ones intruding on the employees eating since it was several of them at the salad bar and sitting at the tables near us. I first must that I think it is a great perk that the employees get to eat a free meal. They work hard and if the food is going to waste anyway then why not let them enjoy it too. I just don't understand why paying customers get cut off so they can have that perk. Dinner didn't start until 5 pm and it wasn't even 2:30 so these employees could have let us enjoy our meal and then stuff their faces. I contacted Fogo about this and got a call back from Whitney, who said they do let the employees eat, but they should have waited until we were finished. Whitney never once said she was sorry on behalf of Fogo and never returned the promised phone call the following day. Just because the small salad I was allowed to eat tasted good and the bacon wrapped chicken was to die for, doesn't mean everything else was acceptable. I would much rather give my money to Texas de Brazil.

It's not often that a new hotel and casino opens up in Las Vegas, especially one that's transplanting some of LA's most well-known restaurants. With the food and all the hype surrounding the SLS, I've been pretty excited for the place to open! So much so, that we decided to book a room and stay here on opening night. For a 325 square foot room with a single king bed in the "Story Tower", our rate was $209 per night and we stayed just 1 night.

When we first arrived at about 6pm, we made our way to the parking garage that you enter from Paradise. And although we were trying to check in, we weren't allowed to valet or pull up to the front for unloading, as were told they were just too full and busy. After finally finding a spot in the garage, we were faced with broken elevators and had to carry our bags down 5 flights of stairs. Thankfully we just had 1 bag with enough for 1 night, so it wasn't a huge deal, but it was frustrating and not the best first impression. When we got to check-in, they were well aware of the elevator issues and offered us a couple free drinks at the Monkey Bar, which is just across the way. The check-in by the way, was pretty straight forward, quick and painless.

For the rooms, they offer several different types and there's 3 towers...the World Tower, the Lux Tower and the Story Tower, which is where we stayed. The room itself was a bit on the small side, but it was quite impressive. When you walk in, your attention is immediately drawn to the opaque white bed and couch that have dimmable lights build right into them! There's also a 55" TV hanging from the wall and a giant mirror on the ceiling above the bed that might catch your attention. The styling is very modern with a darker grey paint, and yellow accents underneath a strange industrial concrete style ceiling. Both the bathroom and shower, which are separated, also feature bright yellow tiles, and are hidden behind two large sliding mirrors. For the size of the room, I was pretty impressed with the layout and use of space. And although expensive, the mini bar was nicely stocked. We did have issues with some lights and the TV not working in the room, but that easy to look past. Overall though, I can't say I'd recommend paying $200 a night here...actually about $260 after all taxes, fees, etc.

When it comes to the casino itself, their main focal point seems to be restaurants and nightlife. In my opinion, these are super solid restaurant choices and worth the visit alone. However, if you aren't a partier, you might find yourself bored here. Compared to other casinos, the machines and tables seem to be limited and they are all very close together. There's also minimal shopping choices and apart from a coffee shop, I was surprised to see that they didn't include any type of dedicated dessert/treat spot here. For the most part though, I thought the overall style of the place was alright. But some things were strange and seemed out of place, like the open industrial ceiling, and the buffet which is upstairs and completely separate from just about everything. By the way, the Sunday breakfast/lunch buffet was $31, and the dinner $37...ouch!

My feelings on the employees are very mixed. As many people have mentioned, the amount of employees standing around and doing nothing but talking was a bit ridiculous. I can understaff overstaffing for grand opening, but on several occasions we saw 3+ employees in a group just kind of standing around and chatting. We also had our fair share of issues during our stay, and our interaction with the staff was a bit hit and miss. Since this was the first day, I won't get too far into all our issues but we had to visit the desk 3 times and speak with 3 different managers due to room problems and huge bill discrepancies. On Saturday night, we spent an hour dealing with a $140 charge for two drinks at the Monkey bar. Then on Sunday, it took us over an hour just to check out because our bill was beyond messed up, to the tune of over $200. However, Aubrey who checked us out was extremely nice, patient and seemed genuinely apologetic about the mess we had on our hands. She was the reason I decided to bump this review up to 3 stars, instead of 2. 

With SBE behind the place, I really thought they would have a lot smoother launch. I mean, you obviously can't expect a flawless experience on opening weekend, but I was a bit surprised to see just how many issues they had. I was also disappointed with some of the pricing they have set up. Bottled beers at the center bar are $8 each and a Gatorade at The Perq coffee shop was $5! Yes, it's a casino but c'mon. And why are there no locals specials for anything?

All in all, we had a great time and the restaurants will surely keep me a regular at SLS. However, it was a bit overhyped and unless they bring out some killer room rates, this wouldn't be my choice for another staycation.

This review is just for the sushi part of the restaurant because we didn't try the Teppan side but we will be back for sure to give it a shot. From the little I saw it looked like they put on a good show.
Thanks to Living Social for this find. I love Japanese food and sushi so when I was looking around for what I call "Prepaid Date Nights" I saw this place and bought the deal. I didn't even know this place was here.
It was Saturday night so time to break out one of these "Prepaid Date Nights" out and give it a try. Just another unassuming place in a strip mall. When you open what looks like a big wooden door the inside is very nice. Teppan tables on one side and regular tables on the other with a sushi bar along the wall next to that. The hostess came up, had our reservation and we were seated immediately. The Teppan tables looked full but there were plenty of regular tables available. Some of the parties at the Teppan tables looked like they don't get let out much. They were having a little too good of a time. Drinky drinky. But it was all a good time. Our waitress Colleen came over right away and was very very nice. She explained the menu, the happy hour specials, I still haven't figured out exactly when happy hour is at this place but whenever it was it was going on now so let's do it, and she offer suggestions. All of the wait staff had these LED name tags with their names scrolling or dropping or going by in different ways. My girlfriend and I both thought they were really cool. I can never pick sushi rolls because everything sounds so good. I would order way to much food. So my girlfriend is in-charge of ordering sushi whenever we go out. She hasn't picked bad yet. I did make the suggestion that I wanted to try some spicy rolls like the Arizona roll. So we ordered the I Sushi roll, the Arizona roll, the Vegas roll and the baked I Sushi roll. We had never heard of a baked roll so we were curious plus if they are putting their name on it it must be a specialty.
We ordered drinks. She got some green cocktail thing with pineapple, which she really liked and turned out according to Colleen to be one of the more popular drinks, I thought is tasted good too and I don't really like pineapple. I got a Kirin Ichiban. Bonus points for having this. How can you be a Japanese place and not have Kirin. We also got two ice waters. Here is another thing this place does that I really like, they put a slice of cucumber instead of a slice of lemon in the waters. I do not like lemon in my water. If I wanted lemon aid I would have ordered it and I wouldn't have because I don't like it. But cucumber was so much better. Extra points for this original thought. At least the first time I have seen it.
The rolls came out pretty quick. Now it was not that busy but even then some places take quite awhile to roll. But these came out bam, bam, bam. Wow were they good. So fresh. I mean the fish was swimming around happily this morning fresh. Like we lived in a coastal city fresh. The I Sushi roll had jalapenos and chipotle sauce on it but it was a good hot not a burn your face off hot. The Arizona roll had jalapenos on it too but didn't seem as hot as the other. Of course it's heat might have been swimming upstream from the I Sushi rolls heat. The Vegas roll was very good too but I think my favorite of the night was the baked I Sushi roll. They were all very good but this one was just that much better. They had a lobster and crab ball on top of a small roll on it's side then they baked the whole thing. It was so warm and good. Even though I was full I could have eaten more of that one.
We both really enjoyed the food and the service. We will definitely be back here with or without a coupon of some kind. The prices where very reasonable. Especially with the level of freshness of the fish. Next time we will try the Teppan for sure but probably still order a roll or two of this great sushi. This just became my new favorite place for sushi. So much better than the place down the street. I don't care if that place is all you can eat I would much rather come here. I will take fresh, great sushi and exceptional service over all you can eat any day. Keep up the great work I Sushi & Teppan.
