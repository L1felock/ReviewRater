I think this place took notes of the complaint of the smoke smell here, cuz as soon as i walked in here, i felt like the place was doused in perfume. I had a headache, and this place made me super nauseous with their overpowering vanilla scent trying to hide the smoke. 
Other than that, the place is beautiful- and has one of my favorite stops in vegas- Jean Phillipe Patisserie. Dude stayed here before for a bachelor party and our friends stayed here also. Thumbs up on their stay. Very modern rooms. 
And more important note again, there is a Jean Phillipes.

I was in an accident a few months back and USAA referred me to Gerber Collision, they had my car in and out, and painted perfectly. They replaced the rear bumper and passenger fender. The job was great and they patched my tire up for free! They were very nice and professional. They even gave me a ride to Enterprise Car Rental just as an added bonus. I will go to Gerber every time I need body work done. Hands down.

Best shop in town.
Every employee at Dyno-Comp is well-informed and treats the business like their own. This translates to quality work and attention to detail, as well as attention to the client.  Nobody is trying to screw you or upsell, and the work they do is bar none the best available.
I personally have dealt with Richard, Ken, and Ron, and could not be happier. 
If you want your car to go from just a car to something truly special, do yourself a favor and take it here.

LOBSTER ICECREAM!!!

is the reason i bookmarked this place. i was excited cuz i was staying at planet hollywood. as i did research, reviews were lukewarm. I tried the lobster icecream and it was ok. I'd rather spend my $ at Earls. if ur a lobster freak, it's worth a looksie as they have many items like lobster grilled cheese, with waffles, lobster rolls- which are $22 for the large ones.

I did a hypnotherapy session with Sydney a few weeks ago and I absolutely loved it. She came to my house to do the session so I would be comfortable and relaxed. The session lasted for approximately one hour and she used techniques to provide better energy flow in and out of my life/body. I had filled out a questionnaire beforehand so Sydney was prepared with a session before she came over. After the session I literally felt lighter for days and was bouncing around. I am looking forward to my upcoming Past Life Regression session that we are scheduling soon. Sydney is amazing to work with, you will not be disapointed!

Oh snaaap. If you wanna feel like Sharon Stone in 'Casino' circa 1975, then put on that sparkly silver dress and get your ass to the Fireside Lounge. While so many places in Vegas are trying to go old school back to Sinatra in the 50s, Peppermill boldly stays in the 70's...tacky floral uniforms and all.

The restaurant part is okay, but lounge is where it's at. Sitting around the water/fire pit on those cheese plush couches makes you wonder why disco ever ended. ...well, other than the million obvious reasons, but the cheesy throwback amazingness of this place can't be beat.

Over the years, I've been in a lot of sheet metal; Ferrari, Porsche, Bentley, you name it.

I've also been fortunate enough to have driven at the Charlotte Motor Speedway when it first reopened in several different cars.  But I have no idea what to say about Tesla, except something humorless about their cars not needing a cigarette lighter.

I've seen quite a few around town. And yes, it's a very nice car but... $122K for a Model S? I'll admit there's certainly a je nes se qua to them that attracts folks.  The stock price is another story. Really.  

The showroom also seems to do a brisk business in shirts, hats, et cetera.

But I hope they survive, live long and prosper.  If only because I don't want to hear about them being an electric deLorean.

Enjoy!  If you can.

Every so often a business closes for remodeling and then snap; reopens.

In the process, it also looks like my old review has been misplaced. This Starbucks use to be much larger and was an ideal setting for client meetings. Sadly, no more.  The new version is much smaller, with an angular setup.  It looks as if part of the old space has been acquired by Jumba Juice.

The Baristas who work here seem to be the same happy group, while it looks like no one has been displaced due to the store's downsizing.  Note, the outdoor seating now overlaps both the businesses on either side.

We are a family of six and moving from a 3200 sq. ft. home is no easy feat.. After interviewing several other moving companies, choosing Creative Moving and Packing was an easy decision. Conrad was professional, knowledgable, and flexible - our closing date changed 3 times and Conrad said, "no problem, we'll make it work".  The employees that packed us up and moved us were friendly and courteous; they helped make one of the most stressful events in life (moving) into a smooth transition for me and my family. I highly recommend this company for any type of move.

Could this store BE any smaller (said in my best Chandler Bing voice)? I seriously walked in with Rickie, stayed 90 seconds, and said "Dude, I gotta git outta here!" Fortunately they had a guitarist/singer on the back patio with a coffee pot full of java and some cookies. How cool is that? Said musician was eventually joined by a little girl who played her clarinet. Played is being kind. Poor thing. That clarinet squeaked more than the brakes on my 95 ghetto beemer. More than Peter Brady's voice during puberty. But how cute it was. How very Bohemian. Rickie scored The Knife CD he's been looking for and the staff was VERY helpful and not all weird slacker don't bother me cuz I'm too cool to move from behind the counter cuz I just know you two queers are looking for Brittney Spears or Madonna crap and that is so lame...NO...not at all. Nicest of nice. And we were cool. Besides. I'd never heard of The Knife. That was always my nickname for OJ. And he WAS not there. Oh. Cuz he's in jail! HA HA! Anyway, I digress. Stinkweeds!

Beautiful show; loved the intimate settling.

Reminds me of O show but the stage is a round circular shape; lot smaller & more intimate feeling making you feel like you're closer to the stage. 

Vivid & passionate colors used throughout this show.

Loved the beautiful flowers that bloom at the end of the show.

Highly recommend this show; this is one of the better Cirque Soleil shows in Vegas. =)

FYI, you can buy discounted tickets on day of the show at Tix4Tonight but you have to go in person to buy them; they have plenty of booths & locations within casinos so don't worry.

Hit the spot... but definitely not ranked up there as a favorite.  The eggrolls were somewhat dried out!  The soup didn't have the same taste that I have come to look for in pho broth.  The service was not horrible but definitely wasn't as good as other restaurants, even though they weren't so busy when we went to visit.

They were rather stingy with paper napkins ... and water.

Been there once... and that's okay for me.

It's definitely not the Encore or Wynn. The spa is lovely. The gym has great equipment but no bottled water. The rooms were okay but seemed dated. The whole sunken living room idea seems very 1970. Getting help from the concierge was a bit frustrating as they were at capacity. They were able to accommodate a late checkout, which was appreciated but I would not choose to stay here again as I think there are several Vegas properties that are much nicer.

I would rather be a freegan and dumpster dive then ever swing into the Rainforest Cafe again. I would rather eat.....
....at the worst Applebee's in America
....vending machine food
....my own flesh

Now, Rainforest could be fun if you were 12 and drunk. Then the overly fried foods and canned sauces could cure your munchies. I would have rather had Totino's pizza rolls than the nasty appetizer combo we shared. The plant and animal filled space could really use the services of Merry Maids. Really. How do you clean all that crap? 

The rainforest "thunderstorm" is as exciting as the one in the produce section at Safeway. So if you have kids who like to drink, you might have a good time here. Otherwise I say stay home and check your trash like a good freegan.

"Exit to lef"
Every time I hear this, I'm thinking, "There's a t at the end of left! A t for God sakes"! Then I calm down and fixate on the homeless man rubbing his feet.

While I'm glad I don't have to rely on public transportation to get work (I walk actually), I LOVE having it in my hood. I've taken it to the movies, to get a haircut and to the movies and to get a haircut. OK. So I haven't used it that much. 

Trains arrive, it seems, in 10 to 15 minute intervals. Trains are (so far) extremely clean. I miss the advertising however, like in NYC. I want posters about STD's and community colleges. Gimme something to look at.

This place is super-clean with a friendly staff (mostly Spanish-speaking but I'm fluent so THERE :P).  There are *no* pigeons running around this place.  Always a plus!
You use a card here, no quarters dug from under the couch cushions.  I like that.  
The place is spotless.  There's always someone cleaning up.  The machines are regularly cleaned out of forgotten socks and panties.
They even have a little store with a variety of different detergents!  
They are open late, which seems to be when I go there.  Many TVs throughout, tuned into different stations.  There's even a PacMan machine to play!

Oh no!  I only just saw that they closed down when I decided to post long overdue pictures of one of my favorite treat spots on The Strip!

At least I still have a super cutesy apron from this place to remember them by.  My favorite cupcake of theirs was the Kir Royal.  It was described as a moist raspberry cake with bubble champagne buttercream.  Every cupcake I have ever gotten from them was moist and airy.  The buttercream can get a tad on the sweeter side but it's nothing you can't fix by removing some of it off.  This place loved using the edible glitter as well.  

Oh well.  I'll keep warm and fuzzy memories of The Cupcakery in my thoughts.  Farewell, old friend!

"Just Say No!" has been around for years to protect our children from drugs.  Well, if you are over 18 there is one drug you must try...Absinthe, the best show at Caesars Palace.  If you want to hear Celine...watch Titanic.  The best entertainment at Caesars is this "trip" of a lifetime, without a drug test. The venue is a 1800's wooden/stain glass tent from Belgium, set outside at Caesars Palace.  The interior is dark and mysterious with wooden chairs around a small stage and a bar.  The air is that of a freak show and you are waiting for the Elephant Man to come out. Go early and enjoy the whole venue, which includes a very eclectic outdoor lounge filled with artwork and sculptures that are a cross between a haunted house and Alice in Wonderland. The New York Times has called this show Cirque du Soleil meets Rocky Horror.  The acts are so intensely entertaining that you are either crying from laughing or praying on your knees that nobody gets hurt from their amazing feats of acrobatics and stunts.  This show is by no means for the timid.  The performers are so talented and death defying, you experience that sensation of driving by a car accident where you don't want to look but you just HAVE to.  Just say YES to Absinthe!

Granted CLT seems to have an Einstein Bagels everywhere, but this one offers a more interesting food option.  The sandwich was very good. But I felt for the folks behind the counter who were friendly, but because it was New Years Day, looked like they were pulling a double shift.

I ordered the Turkey bagel.  It was very good, had a fair amount of meat on it and the bagel stood up to the toasting. All pluses in my book.

The two carne asada tacos I had were basically two of the smallest tacos that I have ever seen. The taste was so so. They have a great outdoor patio and plenty of room in the dining area.

But I don't see myself coming back to America's Taco Shop.

22" wiener, $27, meh. 
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=4ZfcCa4m5RWvO4EFzfYm1A

I know it's unfair but I have to compare all hot dogs to what you can get at Costco for $1.50. And in this case, I would have happily forwent the baguette, chili, bacon, cheese, kraut, etc. etc., for a dozen Costco dogs and Polish dogs. 

Here, the massively long and narrow wiener was overcooked to the point where the skin was starting to crinkle and pull away from the meat (that's what she said? Ew). Add too many par toppings and you have an overpriced novelty dog at an equally novel bar-type thing. 

Fun if you're an Alice Cooper fan or need a bar to get sloshed and watch games at. But this review is just for the dog.

Shhhhhh! can you keep a secret?  

We stumbled upon a secret pizzeria in the new Cosmopolitan hotel.

It was 3 in the morning and we roll in jonesin for some food.
Nico was such a sweetheart, he told us stories, listened to ours, and gave us advice on life, love, and all things worldly.  He was like an elder teaching us life lessons while he kneaded dough and turned it into pizza for us!

It literally turned from this.....

                       \*/

Great pizza, nice crust, and awesome company.  Nico hooked us up and managed to teach us about life all in 30 minutes.  He made me feel like I was in Italy and if this was his pizzeria he'd have given us the pizza for free!  Nico made our trip a memorable one.

Even though this would pretty much be a one and done for anyone living in Las Vegas, I highly recommend checking out the Neon Museum.  Having the lights on definitely added awesome effect to the signs for the 7:30pm tour.  My wife and I both agreed this was much better to see at night.

Our tour guide, April, was chockful of great information.  She really enhanced what would have been a 10-15 minute walkthrough sans guide to an hour tour full of history and fun stories.  That alone made it well worth the locals admission of $22.  Some of my favorite signs included Sassy Sally's, the humungous Treasure Island skull, the H tile board of the Horseshoe and the creepy at night looking Jackpot Motel sign.

I'm reminded of a Doctor's reading of an x-ray when he comments "unremarkable" when reviewing Lucky Boy Burger Shop. I order a burger which comes with fries and a shake since they don't have free refills on their sodas. The shake was the best part of the meal. The burger was "unremarkable". The fries were meh.

I think they should just close the dining area and make it drive thru because they don't have a restroom for their customers. Meh. I've experienced better.

I'd like to personally shake Mr Tofu's hand.  While I cannot medically prove it, I am 100% certain that their soondubu contains undefined healing properties.  Some how some way, I always feel better after a meal here.  

Got a cold?  Screw the Nyquil and get the spicy kimchi soondubu.

Bad day at work?  Beef soondubu=good f'n day

Broken leg?  Just splash a little pork soondubu broth on your leg and it'll probably heal instantly.  

Venereal disease?  Wait a couple of minutes before pouring it all over your crotch since it comes out piping hot.  Don't want to scare the other customers with your screaming.  Perhaps the seafood soondubu would be best for this.    

At $8 a bowl, even my wallet feels better!

This may be the first review that I've awoken from a deep dream of peace to write.  Ok, first I had to make a pit stop, but then it was time to pen my thoughts and aspir... ooooh hoooold on, brb...

Now, where was I.  Here's a fun fact... the human body can hold up to a quarter of its own weight in disposable fluids, whose liberation can be mobilized by Arriba's own spinach enchiladas.  Ole!

That's right, the green leafy vegetable made famous by a marble-mouthed sailor, now compels me to blow my own ballast tanks... again and again

But I have to say, this couldn't have come at a better time, with tomorrow being the inaugurate outing of my office's hiking group.  Magic 8 Ball says "Signs point to yes" that I'll collapse 27 minutes into the trek from dehydration, and possibly require professional extrication.

You know what doesn't require professional extrication?  The cauldron of dysentery brewing in my lower GI.  Spiiiicy!

But to be fair, its not all waterloo, Arriba's.  I really should thank you for lightening my load, even though I've really never felt more bloated and irritated.  *quizzical look*

And if I ever nurture the desire to tarry in your cantina, which is somewhat reminiscent of The Blue Oyster on tango night, I'll be sure not to waste the opportunity, and schedule that pesky colonoscopy for the following morning.  Osmoprep's got nutin on you, honey.

I've heard they officially changed their name to Big Pile of Crap. 

I'm sorry. I know this is a discount store. I'm not expecting cappuccino and Evian while shopping, though it would be a lovely touch.  But could you sweep the floor? I mean you sell brooms for God's sake. 

I did score a coffee bean grinder for twelve bucks. But I was covered in cardboard box grime. It's cluttered and hard to navigate the filthy aisles. 

Really? Is sweeping too much to ask? Listen, if I ever stop by again, I'll bring my Swiffer.

My ode to Estelle Getty:
Picture this. Scottsdale. Hotel Indigo pool. 
A middle aged gay man holding a glass of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc runs to make a photo opp at Rickie's fashion show.
He didn't realize the three svelt female models with air bags for breasts were nude. Naked. Sin ropa! Nada lotta!
Except for their bikini-painted bodies. Yes. Body paint. 
By the pool. Me. Them. Slippery floor. Slippery glass of wine. 
As the photo is being snapped, I find myself losing my balance and I think, as I was going down with the wine, I should grab on to someone's clothing. To brace my fall. In front of hundreds. 
Well. They're nude. There is nothing to grab onto. Me and the wine go down spilling wine on all three of the models.
Causing their body paint to start streaking! SNAP goes the photo. 
Oh. Hotel Indigo? The services? Valet guy parked my car. Hostess greeted me. Bartender overserved me. The models hated me. 
Good times...

Girls and guys gone wild! TAO Beach is crammed with gorgeous people... but it's way too close for comfort - for me at least. The pool is tiny, and by the end of the day, half the water has been splashed out of the pool and is completely murky. 

We didn't have to wait in line or pay a cover to get in on a Saturday afternoon, which was a plus, but the place was a madhouse. On the upside, because the place is so small, it's much easier to make friends with complete strangers who will let you hang out in their lounge area.

For the ultimate Vegas pool party experience, my vote is definitely for Wet Republic or Encore Beach Club.

If you like books, old LPs, and games... then Bookmans is your first and only stop.

I love book stores.  I particularly like used or old bookstores. I'm also not a be fan of dust or mildew and thankfully Bookman's does a great job keeping everything fresh and clean. 

Recently after roaming the store for hours, I picked up my assortment and decided to cash out.  Well, I was the lucky winner the Shopper of the Day and like that. my fifty dollar tab was wiped clean.  Made me want to go back and pickup the rejects. LOL

I'm not sure if this location is larger than the one in Mesa, but it appears so. But Mesa might have a greater selection of records and old LPs.

Come, look, browse; you'll be glad you did.

Seriously feel like I'm in Hawaii every time I come here. This has been one of my favorite bars in Vegas for years and I don't think that will ever change! With island inspired drinks filled with various rums and juices... bring your sweet tooth! They even sell collection glassware for $20 and it comes with one of their signature drinks. Ive bought all of them haha. Vegas's best Mai Tai by far and amazing decor what more could you ask for! Oh yea and on Fridays from 4-8 if your wearing a Hawaiian shirt your drinks are half priced! The only bad thing about Frankies is there aren't more locations in town.

I took my 2002 Saturn into this shop based on the good reviews on Yelp.  I was not disappointed.  Bogi is terrific!  I picked her shop because it isn't too far from where I work and they took me to work and picked me up when my car was done. I was tired of going into shops where they tell you need other work done. Bogi explained everything to me. What sold me was I met a man there taking his car in (told me he had a newer car under warranty) and he told me he felt better taking his car into Bogi's place rather than the dealer! She is terrific! Will definitely take my car back to her.

Welcome to Chuck E Cheese from Hell!  

Not only would this attraction be suitable for family fun, but it'd also be great if you were looking to do a modern version of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas".  I witnessed a couple of tourists in midst of that and I gotta admit...I was jealous.  They bathed in the KISStory and rocked out harder than anyone else when the band's late 80's hit "Forever" blared out the speakers.  I doubt they ever made it to playing golf.

This is unquestionably the best mini-golf course in Las Vegas.  The black lights, awesome tunes, incredible memorabilia (Eric Carr's Porsche right up front!) and KISS animatronics really transported me somewhere else.  The enormous models of Paul Stanley's Ibanez Iceman, Ace Frehley's triple humbucker Gibson Les Paul and then Gene Simmons' tongue on the 18th hole were insane.

My only gripe was that holding a scorecard, pencil, putter, golf ball and beer from hole to hole became as annoying as listening to a Peter Criss interview.  At least the beers were cheap.  It was $2 for the first round, $3 for the second etc.  That definitely eased my pain of being the worst mini-golfer in the world.    

Here's a $3 off per person coupon:
http://vegas4locals.com/couponkissminigolf.html
That makes it $8.95 for out of towners and $6.95 for locals.  SONIC BOOOOOM!!!

Would I spend $300 per night on a room? Hell to the no. Will I sign up for their text message promo list and get a code to get a room at about $90 per night. Fuck yeah.

I got just such a deal for a 700 sq ft HRH suite with two queen beds over Christmas weekend. And I've gotta say these are pretty nice digs. Two big TV's a ginormous swanky bathroom (complete with kickass deep soaking tub), comfy beds, roomy couches, and a sweet bar area... this is how you do Vegas right, kids.

Sure, it's kind of a bitch to take a cab whenever you want to go to the strip, but with Hard Rock being directly across from Hofbrauhaus and Double Down... well, color me happy.

4pm check out time, at no additional cost. In Vegas? Yes, it does exist, and it exists at Trump. It's an excellent buffer after going all night long, because the thought of getting up at 10 or 11 is just plain awful. 

The bathroom is huge and includes a shower large enough to fit a party of four people (if that's your kind of thing) and a bathtub deep enough to store all your winnings. And there's a TV in the mirror in the event you want to bathe in your money and catch some prime time.

The rooms are spacious and though there's no casino to amuse you, it's walking distance from some of the more desirable entertainment locations of the strip.

Your nose will also appreciate the distinct (and pleasant) smells in the lobby and elevator.

They accept AMEX, Visa & MC, but appreciate cash for gratuity.  I think they'd prefer cash for the whole shebang... I know I would.

They also have no qualms with putting a bright coat of hi-gloss on your little piggies... they will call your bluff... so know this before wandering down a bad path.

And when your done, strut those newly pedicured feet down the asphalt runway to Inta'Juice for a little wheatgrass action.  No one's gonna spoil your party, not today!

HEALTH IS HAPPINESS

  The Peccole Ranch Walking Trail (PRWT) is an unsigned Summerlin trail system in the neighborhood bounded by Hualapai Way to the west, Charleston Boulevard to the north, Fort Apache Avenue to the east, and Sahara Avenue to the south. After experiencing PRWT, I see it as three connected concrete trails winding through a continuous linear park. Trail 1 starts at Hualapai Way to the west which is 0.4 miles north of Sahara Avenue. A tunnel carries it under Grand Canyon Drive. After intersecting with a spur trail, it heads northeast. A second tunnel carries it under Red Hills Drive. Leaving the tunnel it parallels Apple Drive up to it concludes at Trail 2 near Charleston Boulevard. This is the physical fitness trail. Fitness stations with cooresponding descriptive signs adorn the parkscape. They include a vertical ladder, chinning bars, and squat-stretch bench. If health is happiness, this is the trail to happiness. Trail 2 runs south of the commercial and residential development along Charleston Boulevard from Hualapai Way to a couple hundred feet east of the Apple Drive tunnel. Trail 2 weaves through a linear disk golf course. Trail 3 is the spur trail off Trail 1, which continues the due-east direction of PRWT past a surface crossing with Preakness Pass to the easternmost point at Fort Apache Road.

  In late November, I spent a couple of hours enjoying an adventure on PRWT. It reminded me of its sister linear parks in Summerlin: The Pueblo Park and Cottonwood Canyon. However, there were a few characteristics that separated PRWT from its sister linear parks. In comparison, it is a more compressed space bordered by walls instead of larger homes up on hills; with the exception of the trail east of Preakness Pass,  the landscape is golf course green grass; and parking lots are nonexistent. 

  My adventures along PRWT color me impressed. Graffiti is nonexistent. Mature pine trees and colorful trees that left sprinklets of fallen leaves on golf course green grass attracted birds. Birds were everywhere. Many of the adjacent backyards have humingbird feeders. The white concrete trail is a work of art that gently weaved between the bordering walls of the linear park and under picturesque tunnels. Green streetlamps complimented the parkscape. The gentle inclines added texture to the trail. And the fitness stations are a celebration of good health.

  This is an unadvertised trail. Signing and parking lots are nonexistent. My advice is to park at either the Sahara West Library parking lot or Hualapai Commons Shopping Center anchored by Smith's at the southeast corner of Charleston and Hualapai. To reach PRWT from the Sahara West Library, you will walk north on Grand Canyon Drive for 0.4 miles until you reach the overpass. The Hualapai Commons is adjacent to PRWT. Both parking lots are a relatively short distance east of the 215.

  After spending a couple of hours exploring PRWT I felt uplifted and a few pounds lighter than when I came into the trail. I felt healthy! As the sign says on the fitness trail "health is happiness. " And because this is the season of giving, I want to give people happiness by recommending an adventure on the Peccole Ranch Walking Trail.

This is my favorite store in the entire valley. So many new things to look at everytime you enter the store, the staff is so friendly, trade in prices are fair and I love their cafe. Grab a book and a coffee or a sandwich and relax on a couch. I go there for my expanding video game collection as well and every time I go in there is so much new inventory I feel like its a whole new store to dig through. Check this place out. The classic nick nacks alone is enough reason to pop in and look around. There is absolutely something for everyone.

You would have no idea which show I was referring to if I said I saw it in Las Vegas and it starred a group of fairly attractive women doing dance routines to prerecorded music while topless.  That not only describes "Sydney After Dark", but also current strip shows like "Fantasy", "X Burlesque" and "Crazy Girls".  

Australian accents aside, there is nothing new being offered here.  As I watched the prerequisite cowgirl scene, I wondered how/why THIS had become the formula for Vegas topless shows?  Maybe having a girl that sings makes it classier than a strip club?  There has to be a more creative way to present half naked girls!  Oh!  They have a girl in a leotard doing an aerial scarves act!  That was so cool and original like 10 years ago but a snoozefest today.  A topless comedian would have been much better.    

Keeping with the Aussie theme, they dance to mostly native artists from the "lahnn daahn undah" like AC/DC, Tina Arena, Sia and INXS.  I can only guess their sultry version of "Locomotion" was inspired by Kylie Minogue.  They even did an aboriginal routine which left me feeling cultured and educated.  That's a lie. 

The few people in attendance (15% capacity at best) were all moved up to the best seats so buy the cheapest ones if you're going to pay.  I would recommend "Fantasy" at Luxor over this.  The girls are hotter!

Ugh...This place made me pee from my butthole...

I didn't like this buffet at all...

I dunno...Even though there was so much food around, I didn't feel like anything caught my attention or made me want to eat it.  The meats were overcooked, everything was fried or covered in gross batter, and a lot of stuff had like barbeque sauce or a tomato based sauces on it.  

I literally had more gelato than i did food.  That's the only good thing I somewhat liked.  "Somewhat" is the key word there.  

I didn't even eat that much here and yet I felt so gross and sick afterward.  blah no me gusta (I especially hate buffet sushi...wtf...what's the point?  I always wanna give them a chance and I get some and it makes me vomit in my mouth.)

ps.  I've had better food at Hometown Buffet, and that's just sad...

Best buffet on The Strip! Not to mention it's also located inside the best hotel in Vegas. Prices vary on the day of week, but the brunch buffet on Tuesday was only $22, which included unlimited champagne. What a deal!

Their international selection is absolutely mouthwatering. Your eyes will definitely be bigger than your stomach, so make sure you pace yourself. Hightlights included pastas served in mini skillets, fried chicken wings in mini fry baskets, awesome carving station, giant made-to-order omelettes and a beautiful array of desserts.

Save the buffet for your last day. Perfect cure for those hangovers!

A great chill place to sit out on the patio and enjoy the beverage of your choice and some pizza. I went here with a group of Yelpers as Fate Brewing was the payoff after hiking Pinnacle Peak on our Hike & Brew UYE.

First of all, the service was outstanding and individual checks were written without any fuss. It was gorgeous day outside for some conversation, drinks and food. I had the sausage pizza with goat cheese sans the mushrooms. That pizza was wall to wall sausage. I unfortunately negated the calories I burned hiking by eating that pizza but my tummy was very happy. The pizza tasted very good and was reasonably priced.

I might have to try some other items next time but to tell you the truth it would be hard to pass up on that pizza.

Three Birds left and pounds of Steel makes for good target practice! 

The Pittsburgh Steelers have one of the best records in football history. They have won 5 out of 42 Super Bowls. Only 3 teams have won 5 and that is the Steelers, the Cowboys and the SF 49's. Seeing the Steelers are the only one of those three in the playoffs, they could break all records this year, by winning 6 Super Bowls. IF they go to the Super Bowl again this year, it will be their 7TH appearance.

IF, is the biggest word in the English language. If my grandmother had 4 wheels, she would be a box car. 

I was not thrilled when Bill Cowher left the Steelers, but I must say Mike Tomlin has done a fine job and we were blessed, to have had two great coaches. 

I have been an avid collector of autographed sports memorabilia for many, many years. I have quite a lot of autographed Steelers merchandise, including a football jersey signed by the Steel Curtain. 

I can't help but admire that more and more each week and think of how Mean Joe Green and LC Greenwood will be watching the games, with nerves of steel and how Ernie Holmes and Mad Dog Dwight White will be smiling down upon Big Ben, Willie Parker, Hines Ward, Troy Polamalu, Harrison, Holmes and the rest of the team. 

This week the Steelers have home field advantage of a ridiculous time of 6:30 against the Ravens. The Ravens play hard and rough and my fingers are crossed that we beat them for a third time this year. 

Everyone is thinking of how great it would be to have a PA. Super Bowl. I went to Heinz Field for the 2004 Eagles/Steelers game. I drove from Philadelphia along with Eagles Fans galore. We won and it was an awesome ride home. 

GO STEELERS!! You rock my world! Give me one for the other hand!

I've been here a couple of times. It's decent cheap food. The owner's like to call it the Italian Chipotle. 

Basically you go thru the line like an assembly line and order your pasta and then the toppings and then pay. I think the angel hair pasta works perfectly for this type of eatery. First timers usually get crazy and load up on the toppings. I just get a meat item and some marinara sauce. They give you a bunch of pasta in your bowl so you won't leave that place hungry.

I like Duck, roasted and with some plum sauce on the side. I'm not so excited about Duck & Decanter. It's just okay for me, 2 1/2 stars if I had that option since I'm only interested in lunch and not their wine or any of the fancy foodstuffs that they carry. The best attribute about this place is the outdoor seating while being surrounded by some large trees.

For starters, there's a funky smell going on when you first walk into the place. I think the sandwiches are weak. You can look at a picture of my Reuben Sandwich with the toasted burnt bread and judge for yourself. To me, it looks like a number eight hitter's batting average, weak. I've had a decent salad in the past as well. 

This place has definitely not made the cut on to my regular lunch rotation.

Lost in translation?

What it should be:  A working businessman's meal.  100g-150g of high quality, heritage pork, coated in fresh bread crumbs and fried golden brown.  The small portion is accompanied by AYCE rice and cabbage.  Do it yourself sesame based sauces for the tonkatsu and to dress the cabbage.

What they offer:  A simple menu.  Choice of either the softer, less fatty tenderloin of the slightly more firm loin from an everyday pig.  Served traditionally or as a donburi or with curry.  Rice, miso soup, and cabbage completes the meal (not AYCE).  Make your own sauce, grinding your sesame seeds and mixing in the house sauce which has a good dark soy background and hints of plum perfume.  

What I got:  Tried both the tenderloin and loin.  An oily, excessively thick eggy crust of not freshly made breadcrumbs (taste like store bought panko) surrounding an over cooked piece of pork.  Hawaii yeeps, think L&L quality.

Ultimately it's better than your average plate lunch place and not a bad deal for the novelty and price.  Tonkatsu snobs, look elsewhere.

I came here to celebrate my nephews 3rd birthday. The park is nestled in a neighborhood of houses. Since the park is dog friendly, I brought my dog, Brownie along for the party. I walked her on a trail that went around the park as well took her over to the large grassy area the park has to interact with the other dogs there. The grassy area isn't fenced in, so I was surprised at how many pet owners had their dogs off leashes, tsk tsk. The bathroom is large and has entry on either side of the building for males and females. They have an area where the kiddos can get wet, but unfortunately the day we were there the wind was blowing and it was cold, so most of the kids played at the playground. The playground is nice even though the swings were roped off for repair and I am a girl who loves to swing so that was a bummer! The park was clean and the area that was reserved for the party was spacious enough with a shade structure and the nearby bathrooms, BBQ grill and trash cans were convenient. They also have a small skate park too, but I didn't make it over to check it out fully. The water fountains were clean and lights came on in the park after a certain hour and lit everything up fine. All in all a decent neighborhood park.

Pancakes were not steaming hot. They give one small hard as a rock ball of butter that punctures the skin of the pancake. Hash browns were not served with the pancakes. The wife's French Toast was obviously frozen and not served hot.

A little advice for Ihop management. Have an Ihop management type that likes pancakes order pancakes with one hard minuscule piece of butter on barely lukewarm pancakes and see if he/she enjoys that meal. Then go  over to the Waffle House and learn how butter should be served. For those management people that need the cliff notes version, you serve the butter soft and the pancakes hot so that the butter melts on to the pancakes.

I've heard some scuttlebut over the years that there are health code regulations about serving butter soft. I find that hard to believe since every other restaurant I visit seems to have soft butter.

This will definitely be my last visit to Ihop.

Yep. David B. Once again the wise sage atop Mount Yelp. I called another locksmith who never returned my call. I called Stagecoach and they said they could help me tomorrow. That's cool. I had a safe in my office and the batteries died and I was unable to open the safe. But you have to open the safe to put in new batteries. Suckky I know! Stagecoach called back and said they can be here in an hour. YEE HAW! Stagecoach to the rescue.

That didn't happen. On accounta he's dead. But it was a man named Dean. Lean, mean Dean! No. Not mean at all. He fixed my safe. Installed new batteries at no charge. Yep. Free. Last time I got free batteries was at Castle Boutique when I bought a...oh...wait...my mom reads these reviews. Anyhoo. You got key issues. Lock is jammed. Or your office safe is on the fritz.

This review is way old but since I'm sick and have nothing better to do than stare at my feet and feel like crap I thought I'd catch up on old reviews before they are erased from memory.

Happy Hour is where its at son!

I volunteered with a group from yelp to help with the "backpack for kids" program. Bins were organized along 2 sides and ready for us to gladly tackle it! We put on our handy dandy yelp finger-less gloves (thanks Drew!), grabbed a plastic bag, went down the line putting the amount posted on each food/drink bin in the bag and repeated the process until we were finished. It only took a couple of hours and together we packed over 3,200 bags! It's such a shame any child is hungry, but thank heavens for this program! These will go to children who might have nothing to eat over the weekend or when they are not at school. I had obviously heard of Three Square before, but I had no idea about this program as well the other volunteer opportunities available. I'm happy to have helped knowing how many kids were given meals and plan on volunteering here again! You should too! 

Check the calender on their website or call for upcoming opportunities that you can get involved in!

Not absolutely sure if this is the first business of this business model to open in the 702, but I am absolutely sure that it is the newest and only business of this kind currently in operation.

Cafe Teaze is what I would considered a hybrid business model combining a boba tea shop and a Vietnamese coffee shop (just Google or Bing it if you want to know more).  Specifically, the menu is what you would normally find at a boba tea house in California and the waitstaff are all bikini or lingerie clad women. The best part for me and I am sure for the target market is that these waitstaff are friendly and beautiful, and could easily transition from serving you boba milk tea to fitting right in at import model photo shoots.

What can you order here?  11 types of milk teas (from the simple milk tea to Ma-Cha Ice Cream Milk Green Tea with or without boba), 5 different iced flavor teas (Lychee Green Tea and Passion Fruit Black Tea are what look the most appealing to me right off the bat), 6 varieties of Flavored Snow Ice, 5 hot milk tea options and 9 snacks (popcorn chicken, fried wontons, and spiral potato just to rattle off a few).

Let's be frank here, even if your name is not Frank or Francis Underwood, I am here first and foremost for the eye candy, without getting hassle for doing the looking. That reality is what the proprietor is relying on in attracting new customers. However, the beverage and food are what the owners are banking on for lots and lots of repeat business after the novelty wears off a bit.

For me hopefully the novelty will never wear off :)

I love going here for lunch!  I have been there several times because it is close to work and I have to get out of the office!  I love the soups here. Just had the vegetable and the ingredients were so fresh.  The salads are also very good.  I have tried the blueberry wrap and that is one of my favorites.  I have heard from the owner that she will even be delivering to office buildings in the area.  This is the best place to go if you like everything fresh.  Perfect vegetarian spot!

What happened to you, Rain!? You're like a celebrity, once glamorous and incredibly popular, but that has fallen into obscurity. You used to be the posh spot, the happenin' talk of the town... but now you're overused, dirty, discarded. 

This review is long overdue and almost joined Rain by also falling into obscurity.

The layout is still cool, the music still poppin', but never in my life have I come across SO MANY ROAMING HANDS in one place. How shady can a place be such that at least 75% of the male population is trying to violate the females?!? I'd be dancing and suddenly a hand had appeared up my skirt and all the way up my thigh. I immediately moved away and noticed my lady friends were undergoing the same horror from other men. 

I was uncomfortable on the dance floor, and that NEVER happens. I love to dance and meet people and have a great time, but I'm not about to put myself out there for THAT. Gross!

Let's just say I won't be back. Ever. Unless they have a successful Perv Purge movement.

DATE TIP: Fellas, let me break it down for you. Women typically don't appreciate random hands up their skirts. At least buy them a drink first! Ha.

Admittedly, I like Popeyes! And yes, I am a Fan!

Whether its this one, or the one in Blythe coming back from California, it's a real treat to pick up some NOLA inspired food.  Their Cajun Gravy is to die for! Really.

Stopped in today to catch up with Scott D. We have been checking into businesses on Yelp together for over four years. Long time! It's been a fun four years and nice to kick back with a friend who also loves Popeyes!

I had a Po'Boy Chicken sandwich, which wasn't bad.  But I wouldn't insult any of my NOLA friends by calling it a true Po'Boy.  I also ordered three chicken strips and asked for a Cajun Gravy chaser.  LOL  It ran me just under $8.00, not a steal but a fair price. A better deal is what Scott ordered, their Tuesday Special of 2 pieces of chicken, biscuit and Pop for $2.99.  "Love that Chicken at Popeyes!"

Enjoy

Great burgers. My friends and I love this place and it is a rule that every Vegas trip ends with a meal here before finally manage to drag ourselves back to the airport. Last time we went, when it was my buddies turn to order, we looked at him and he was passed out, his head resting on the table....so one of these stars is definitely for comfort.

Do not order large drinks here. 

They use the same amount of coffee in all sizes. Coffee is the most expensive part of an espresso drink, selling larger drinks with the same amount of coffee at premium prices is dishonest. 

I know of NO other shop that sells coffee in this manner, a large drink always means more coffee.

One star until this policy changes.

EDIT: 

Just physically removed from Roosevelt Tavern by the owner Matt Poole (same owner of Giant) because: 

"You are an asshole. You proved it by not fixing your Yelp! review for over two weeks. You are not welcome in any of my places ever again." 

I responded that this was actually the first time I'd ever spoken directly with him, he said I owed him a phone call and that I didn't know how social media worked. By leaving a bad review I was stealing food from his children's mouth. ?? 

Also the owner of Matt's Big Breakfast, keep this in mind when you're deciding where to spend your hard earned money.

Just used them to move from Ahwatukee to Central Phoenix and these guys were outstanding! I've moved 5 times in the Phoenix area and each move has had problems. One time the movers didn't bring enough wardrobes. I didn't have any problems with Creative. Jesse and Eric were terrific! They were very fast and professional. I had to store my stuff for a week because my new place wasn't ready and Conrad (the owner) quoted me a fair price. They are the best and deserve all the great reviews. I have no complaints about this moving company and highly recommend them. One thing I appreciated was fact Conrad always answered my emails and was in constant contact with me about the move. It relieves a lot of stress when you have a professional mover. I called a lot of movers but based my decision on Yelp. I always use Yelp to find local businesses.

I was scheduled to fly to Las Vegas on January 5, 2014, however, my Newark Delta flight via Detroit was cancelled due to the weather. The earliest flight I could get to Vegas was two days later from JFK on January 7. My original hotel stay was at the Planet Hollywood, but, because my arrival was delayed I had to find an alternative hotel.

I found the Quad, which was the former Imperial Palace on the strip. I never stayed here but, as a Total Rewards member their last minute room pricing was the most reasonable so I reserved a room. Big mistake.

When I arrived I found the taxi had to drop me off at the rear of the hotel due to the hotel construction still going on. I noticed a lot of young people checking into the Quad I guess due to the low room cost. My check-in was smooth. As you can see from my room pics, my room was ok, which was fine. 

My only complaint about this hotel is the construction going on in and around the hotel. Some areas of the hotel are still well worn. The hotel location is fine between Harrah's and across the street from Ceasar's Palace.

See the pics of my TR1724 room, which I paid $136 for the first night and $169 for the second night in early January 2014.

I would probably not return here. I much prefer Planet Hollywood or any of the other strip hotels, which do cost a little more.

Okay, while I love Chris and I love his product I despise their group reservation policy. We called weeks ago for a reservation for 9 towards the end of May, they told me that we need to call one month to the date at 5 o'clock.. so today that call was made at 5 o'clock, the stupid matter of factly bitch told me that the reservations were gone at 4:30.. okay, if you're going to fuck around with the way you do things that's one thing, but being a dumb bitch about it is completely another. 

I think I'm finally over my love for this place.. I mean 3 weeks ago we showed up and was told the wait was 4.5 hours.. I don't wait that long for pizza.. while his pizza is great, its just fucking pizza.

Advice: get a bigger place!!

Sorry but I'm still fuming mad!!

We were in Vegas this past weekend and decided to check out Sushi Samba.  We did the tasting "omakase" menu and it was a hit with everyone on the table.  We got a nice sampling of everything there, it was all superb.  My favorite were the yellowtail tacos, yumm!  Most of all, we had a really great waitress, unfortunately i can't remember her name but she was very well informed and on top of it and she's the reason i'm giving this place 5 stars.

Is a trip to Vegas ever complete without a visit to a Cirque du Soleil show?  I think not.

Whats a trip to Vegas without seeing some naked girls swimming and writhing in a giant human-sized fish bowl filled with water?

                          .'                     '.
                         /~~~^~~~^~^~~~\

                                '---------'

I saw the fishbowl and I knew right away I was in.  
They hypnotize you 
They seduce you, every act more titillating than the next
They make you sell your soul to the man next to you
You forget everything
You wake up and the next moment you're sitting in a vat of writhing bodies
Will you obey?

I'm sore.  I guess that means I did.

PS- If you're looking for a conservative show, this probably isn't for you and your family.  But the crude humor, the scantily clad muscled men (wrap him up i'll take him to go) and barely there women.  This was definitely my kinda show.  Crazy moves, random stunts, perverted jokes...This was definitely perfect for me.

Don't get seats in the front rows if you don't want to be called on.  :)

You want some bread to go with that cheese?

I'm immediately reminded of Chuck E.  Cheese, The Country Bears etc.

Cheap animatronics with some fire & water thrown in for spectacle, Fall of Atlantis is a free attraction located in the Forum Shops of Caesar's Palace.  King Atlas has to decide upon who his replacement should be to the  throne, his daughter who has special water effects, or his son who contributes the pyrotechnics.  Gods itervene & have some choice words for King Atlas & his offspring.  The climax brings about a dragon who lays the smackdown on all the Atlanteans & lays waste to Atlantis
http://www.vegas.com/attractions/on-the-strip/caesars-atlantis-fountain/

I know it's free, but I feel like the Fall of Atlantis cheapens the "baller" atmosphere of Caesar's Forum Shops.  I mean, with Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Louis Vuitton and Ferragamo attracting the rich clientele, you'd think there would be something more worthy of the demographic?  To me, the best part of the Fall of Atlantis is the large aquarium, with rays, puffers and other assorted marine creatures.  Of course, I grew up on Jacques Cousteau, so I'll always be partial to the sea ;p

Fall of Atlantis shows at the top of the hour, every hour, starting at 11am.  

I suppose if you were slurring your speech & crap-faced drunk, this show would be more entertaining.  All in all, I say let the tourists watch this lame spectacle of out-dated robotics & head over to something more worthy of your time, like the Bellagio fountains or one of the buffets.

Grab your fork and knife.  No slices here.  True Napolitano pizza in Vegas (or as close as you're gonna get without a trip to Italy).

So it's a small chain of restaurants, all good.  Quality ingredients atop a perfectly blistered, chewy, well seasoned crust served by a proud and friendly staff.  Win!  

This is the real deal.  They even follow the the standards laid down by the Italian government that define such trivial things as the basic ingredients of the crust, its thickness, and the cooking temperature.

The Margherita DOC is excellent.  The standard to judge all Napolitano pizza by, a simple base of crushed, ripe, acidic tomatoes, fresh milky Mozzarella, fresh basil, and a splash of EVOO.  Near perfect.  The diavola with its fennel flavored, gently aged finnochiona, sweet roasted peppers, garlic and mozzarella equally good.  Too simple?  The pizza Capricciosa with its aged, porky porsciutto, oil poached artichoke hearts mushrooms olives basil all atop the same sweet, acidic tomato pure topped with fresh mozzarella, outstanding without being overloaded with toppings.

The only weakness, the namesake Settebello.  The sausage lacked the aged, umame flavor so characteristic in Italian cured meats.  A minor point considering.

Very inexpensive for the quality.

Now if they would just move the tables much closer, encourage chatting it up with your neighbors, get some disposable paper table coverings and serve an abundance of wine....

Green has the best vegan food in Phoenix. Weather or not if you are vegan, there is something there for you. Very artsy inside, fantastic staff, amazing "soynamis" AKA a vegan DQ Blizzard. They have a small grocery area in the front as well, all vegan but all amazing. I always get their special without even looking and have never been let down. The spicy Po Boy, and the Mexicali Burger are my fav off the menu, you also get a side and I never stray from the delicious curry pasta salad. On top of it all, they are very fair priced, 2 meals, 2 drinks, and 2 deserts, usually runs about $20. That's great for in house made healthy food.

I was very excited to be chosen for this event, and not just because I got a sneak preview of J-WoW's sweater.  It was also to be the first time the lunch bunch would meet our cyber friend, Kazi, in person.

The venue was fantastic, located between 2 parking garages, next to an outdoor ice rink.  Upon arriving at the registration table, I spied the Santa photo op, so I grabbed Kazi for her first ever Yelp Elite photo (show some love and friend our newest Elite)

While at the bar, I indulged in a cherry vanilla porter, and I liked it.  The trio of ample hummus bowls were a delight, and I'm not ashamed to admit returning for seconds.

The hot chocolate was the finest I've ever tasted, especially after adding peppermint syrup and a heaping mound of whipped cream. 

While the food and beverage was delightful, the conversation was the high point, and I was lucky enough to spend a few minutes with the beautiful and engaging Kazi.  I loved seeing my friends... and meeting new Yelpers face to face is the icing on the cookie! (which there were a lot of)

I witnessed my first ever ugly Christmas poncho when J-WoW's +1, Linh, made his grand entrance.  Santa Sat on my lap, and my cheek was kissed by a pretty little lady who disappeared into the crowd. 

All in all, a pretty good night

The house of Petrossian is known world wide for one thing; CAVIAR.  Before you jump down my throat, Petrossian only sells farm raised or sustainable caviar.

Hidden in plain sight off the Bellagio lobby.  Masked as a place to get a quick drink or take high tea while listening to live piano music.  No, no.  Ignore the distractions, stay focused on the prize.

Glassy green gray pearls shimmering with highlights of gold atop a mother of pearl spoon.  Delivery, then; the nutty flavor burst forth, a hint of yolky goodness, a creaminess coats the palate all finishing in a slightly briny oceanic wash.  A sip of chilled vodka to erase the flavor and begin the enjoyment all over again.

The caviar service comes complete with chopped egg whites, yolks, crme fraiche, onions, chives, and blinis but seriously, there is no better way to enjoy this treat than dive-bombing.  Extreme quality and freshness.

Want to learn about caviar and vodka pairings?  Try the three caviars (Royal Ossetra, Royal Transmontanus and Royal Siberian), three vodka tasting (Ciroc, Chopin, Level).  At $105, the tasting is a great way to sample the different flavors.

A dozen vodkas and a good selection of champagne if you must.  Vegas resort pricing.

Note: From Petrossian's website, a description of the flavors and types of caviar offered:  http://www.petrossian.com/caviar-1.html

"Champagne wishes and caviar dreams", maybe but then again consider, there are only three materials suitable for making caviar spoons:  24k gold, mother of pearl, and plastic.  Cheers!

Fat Heads makes some seriously fat/phat sandwiches.

I got a crazy good grease-wich when I came here in December. An artery clogger combination of egg, cheese, Linguia, thick bread, and other random elements of pure tastiness.

Each bite was worth the 10 dribbles of grease that would drip out onto my crumpled collection of napkins.

If you're in the area and looking for a fun rowdy place to watch a Steelers game with good food - def stop at Fat Heads. If you're looking for a "fill you up, can barely move once you're done" -  meal -  check out Fat Heads. If you're looking for a nice selection of unique beer brews - come to Fat Heads.  If you're looking for a casual place to catch up with friends - over a massive plate of nachos - go to Fat Heads  (though be prepared to wait awhile if it's game night.)

If you're looking for something light and some peace and quiet - - eh.....- you may want to head elsewhere.

Sorry to ruin the party concerning the high Yelp rating for this company, but this is my story. 

I called these guys and we agreed that they would come over to my house at 4pm for a regular service call. So I took off some time from the office to meet them at my house. I called them at 4:10pm and asked them what was going on, I had to leave a message. After a few minutes, they called me back and said they didn't have a technician near my house since they were in other parts of the valley so we would have to reschedule. WTF?

I rescheduled for the next week and while they called me about 15 minutes before the scheduled appointment, I told them that I was in another part of the valley and couldn't make the appointment. I then continued with my awesome lunch.

Ok. So I've never actually been to Two Hippies BHOTAB...but I'm going to review it anyway. JUST KIDDING! I've had take out but someone else has always picked it up for me. You know. I have people for that. First off I must say for bong sake you have the longest restaurant name evah! Secondly I must say your pork tacos really hit the spot. Granted one side of the tortilla becomes a bit slimy by the time it reaches me (from my people) and the foil is unwrapped (again, my people) and I finally plunge that delicious hippie taco into my boca. The pork is moist (ewww, i don't usually say moist...OMG...I said it twice) and a little crunchy in parts. Perfection. Seasoned with love. Like a good hippie. A few beans, cabbage, cheese and tomatoes thrown in and I'm happier than a hippie at a Patchouli sale. Or happier than a hippie in a muraled van selling incense and bongs on Venice Beach. Or happier than....oh...you get the idea. All this love for under $2 a taco. Now I know why you are Outgrageous! I may tye dye a t shirt, get out the Nag Champa and pop in Dazed and Confused. Now. Damnit. Where is that bag of Doritos?

This chocolate heaven at the Aria hotel just makes me so happy. As soon as i saw those chocolate flowers on the wall http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=zqVvDm_-ikgvhPMZrUK3Lg, i was giddy!
There was the gelato bar with a great variety of flavors: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=7K-QKzgV0XdrlZOX9aMRng, a crepe station, sandwiches, cakes galore, pastries, chocolates and lots of fun and cute stuff - from wedding cake favors http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=wzlynGBt9AZbLQevhF8jjg to Thrilla
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=ZRq2lJn-JoOHLqUOZNYQVg
It was almost impossible to pick which cake i wanted. We settled on triple chocolate cake (so decadent!) topped with a fab macaron. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=HfgazxGFRJ6nZO2MXGcNsQ
We also shared a tasty crepe: rich and very indulgent. Loved it! 

One thing i didn't love was when I asked a worker if they sold individual macarons and the guy said yes and pointed me to the coconut macaroons. I was even more annoyed when I saw labels for the rose macaron cake say macaroon. However the prepacked macarons were labeled "French macarons".  Anthony N pointed it out to me that macaroon is the English translation for macaron; but seriously at Jean Philippe I would like to see it labeled Macaron, especially when they ALSO sell macarooooons. It's like a prestigious french restaurant having "fat liver" on their menu instead of foie gras. Luckily my annoyance quickly dissipated when i took a bite of that triple chocolate cake!!!

Let me start this Yelp by saying I've never given the business to a stripper. Are we clear? Ok.

I'll tell you why this place gets five stars... Because not one but two of the dancers offered to go home with me. 

One for $250. She said "If you have $250, we can go somewhere together." And then she licked my ear and showed me her guns. Her shift was over and she was in street clothes, mind you.

So guess what happened next? 

Stripper two (who actually did leave with me - long story) said, "Gross, some skanky girl licked you and her breath was terrible." I was embarrassed, yet psychologically removed from that experience.

What happened with Stripper two is a great story but I don't know that I want to share it here. But if you go to this club, one piece of advice (Useful alert!): the less attractive dancers require money to leave with you. The self-possessed hotter ones do not. However, if you get her naked in your bed, do no verify pre-coitus that she is not, in fact, a prostitute, because she will leave and call you names as your front door slams behind her. Or so my buddy tells me. Such trifling arrows of human amusement are not found in this man's quiver of irresponsible behavior.

The service and selection at Churchill's is as good as it gets! 

A friend of mine bought me a humidor from here as a gift. There was a continual problem with the small humidifier that attaches to the inside of the lid. 

After many attempts at fixing the issue, they made the decision to upgrade me to the next size, almost twice as big as well as upgrading the humidification system inside the box. 

Every time I walk in I'm greeted with a hello and if I need anything they're right there to take care of me. 

I drive out of my way to go here and this is the only place in town that I'll buy my cigars from.

A great place for a great  happy hour!

I love how they start early, at 2PM goes to 6PM. They have beers for $5, wine and cocktails for $7. I'm not a fan of mojitos, but their Poolside Cruzan Mojito is really good! It's so much more refreshing than any mojitos I've ever had!

Their bar bites are $5-$9. They have a lot of interesting things like Po-Boy sliders, crawfish fritters, and ahi tuna tacos, but I didn't have any of that. I had their $1.50 oysters instead. It was so fresh like they just got their oysters from the ocean that day!

My husband was so in love with their oysters that we decided to come back before our flight back to San Jose. He said they were some of the best he ever had. With suitcases in hand, we practically ran here. We were 3 minutes late for happy hour and the hostesses insisted that happy hour was over. That was fair and that was fine, but I was a bit irritated when one of them said, "We already have a long happy hour." At least she forced a smile on her snobby face when she said that.

I've been to Erased three times now. Time for my review and I'll post some before and after pics. I echo previous reviews in the location being clean and nice. Erased uses the NaturaLase QS 2J laser which is state of the art. Contrary to popular belief, It doesn't hurt as bad as you would think. The technology has come a long way thankfully. I had a black tattoo removed many many years ago and that was full blown torture... and that was WITH numbing cream and I have a high pain tolerance. Couldn't imagine it without that cream... Geez! The doctor had to physically hold my foot down and it took everything within me to not kick that doctor in the face it hurt so bad! And you could smell your skin burning in the room. It was downright awful! I'm so appreciative of the fact that the tattoo removal experience is not like that anymore because to be honest, I don't know if I could do it again. Certain ink colors hurt worse than others and if the tattoo is near a bone or on a sensitive area, you might feel more pain but it's over so fast, it won't even phase you. If you could handle getting the tattoo in the first place, you can definitely handle the removal process so don't be a puss people! If you want to get it done, do it! And better yet, do it at Erased!

I'm saying goodbye to "the only tattoo that mom's like" (Tigger & Winnie the Pooh) along with a daisy with a peace sign in the middle on my butt and a daisy on my toe (the friendship tattoo curse). Sayonara to all these mistakes! I'm not regretting this decision one bit. I promise to post pics of my progress along the way for all to see.

Not a build your own disaster place.  No teriyaki or yakisoba garnish.  BurGR is not about reinvention but about creating the every day burger on steroids and what a great burger it is.

Take a flavorful, plump, juicy, fire grilled burger put it in a good brioche bun, top it with greens (arugula instead of lettuce), cheese (fresh European instead of Kraft singles), onions (as jam), tomato (oven roasted) sauted mushrooms (chanterelles); you get the picture.

The chanterelle burger is delicious. Pungent chanterelles, spicy arugula, and the onion jam compliment the char flavor of the beef.  The Euro burger equally good.  Earthy truffle aioli, tart goat cheese, peppery arugula, and sweet oven roasted tomato.  As with the chanterelle burger, the toppings bring out the flavor of the beef.

The two meat burgers are creative and delicious.  Props to the farm burger with its slightly gamy duck breast "bacon", sharp English cheddar and fried egg.  A great interpretation of the Midwest classic.  Ooey, gooey, juicy and messy.  Delicious.

For sides, parm truffle fries.  Nuff said.

Somewhat inconsistent service and probably the reason for the burgers arriving over temperature.

Tip: use your Total Rewards card to get a minuscule discount (don't bother getting a card if you don't have one).

Never thought I'd see the day when a British chef honored our humble burger.  Cheers!

1300+ reviews don't lie. This place is quite delicious. 

Why the one star? Because I ate here on Tuesday 4/23 and started having food poisoning symptoms two days later. It's been five days and I'm still in pain and have lost 13 pounds due to so much water loss. I had to visit the ER yesterday for dehydration. After multiple complaints from other patrons, Firefly was shut down today for a health inspection. 

However, this is not the first time I became ill after eating here. A couple years ago, I had their fish sticks and started violently vomiting soon after. After some time, I decided to give this place another chance. Everything was good...until now. 

It's such a shame because Firefly has delicious tapas and drinks. This was my go-to place for a long time. But apparently staff members aren't keeping clean and washing their hands or they're not handling their food properly.

I've already given this place a second chance. A third chance? I highly doubt it. Eat here at your own risk.

Forget about those other foot massage places that "waste" your 1 hour treatment time by soaking your feet for half an hour. This no frills, straight to business foot massage business is the real deal!  No "happy endings" here, unless it refers to satisfied customers with their full body therapeutic massages.

I actually dropped in on a whim, as I was feeling very uncomfortable with severe neck and shoulder cramps. I did the quick Yelp search to see which massage places are still opened and picked one of the closest ones.  I parked at the massage place next door by accident, but am very glad I walked the last few feet to Good Season's Foot Spa () for their "ancient professional reflexology".

My therapist was Tom, and I learned that he has been doing this in California for 12 years. He was definitely an old pro at helping customers feel better with his expert hands.  If all you are expecting is a good foot massage, Tom will probably be overkill. If you walked in with sore shoulders and back, Tom is the one you should seek out.

I am so satisfied with my first experience that I made an appointment to go back in 12 hours.  Now if that is not a ringing endorsement, I don't know what else would qualified.

Note: $15/hour grand opening special applies before midnight, after that it is $20/hour. Visa and MasterCard accepted, but American Express is not recognized ($1 per swipe surcharge).

"We don't fit in" says my poker bud.

"What are you talking about" I say.

"Look around, everyone in here is Asian" he whispers.

"And what are we?" I answer dumbfounded.

"No, I mean they are like Wong Fu Asian.  You know, guys in skinny jeans carrying around stuffed animals for girls who weigh 90 pounds or less and take pics with whisker fingers" he continues.

Laughing uncontrollably "Shut up and eat your menu".

Sweet Raku is about hand crafted, refined, JAPANESE desserts; delicate flavors and natural, subtle sweetness.  This is not the diabetic sugary desserts most Americans are familiar with.  A fresh fruit would have the same amount of sweetness as their offerings.

Tip: Opt for the three course tasting.  Widest selection and best value.

Standout examples:

Mt. Fuji - A neutral chestnut sponge cake topped with lightly candied chestnuts robbed in ribbons of airy chestnut cream.  An ode to the chestnut.

Ringo - Modern take on the apple pie.  Barely sweetened apples sandwiched between flaky, slightly salty crust atop white chocolate.  A blown sugar apple filled with cream and an aromatic, slightly bitter sweet honey ice cream, all dusted with powder sugar finish the plate.  

Good selection of coffee and tea drinks.  Well chosen wine list.  Great off Strip prices.

And yes, the menu was delicious.

A group of us came here for breakfast and really enjoyed D'lish.

We ordered their drip coffee and some bagels and found everything tasty.  The coffee was strong and HOT! If water boils at 212F, then D'lish serves it at 210F LOL  What was great about it?  It wasn't over roasted and burnt like the Green Mermaid.  Actually the three of us enjoyed our conversation waiting for it to cool.

The bagels were another surprise.  Given the small space of D'lish's building, I would love to find out where the get them.  My suspicion would be NY Bagel on Scottsdale Road, up near Shea Blvd.  But no matter, they were very good and hit the spot.

We'll be back for lunch.

The Chandelier is a multi-story love bar in the middle of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. It's a memorable setting with memorable drinks and plenty of unique couches, seats, and tables. It's easy to find a spot just right for you and your friends.

Plus one star for having several flavors of Hangar One Vodka available!

Another bonus star for super friendly, but efficient servers. No complaints at all.

My wife rated the Cosmopolitan hotel's house Cosmopolitan ($15) her favorite drink in Vegas. If she's happy, then I'm happy. 

I was looking for something different and tried a cocktail called Bruce Tea ($14) with Kai Coconut Pandanus Vodka, St. George Thai Basil Eau de Vie, Lemongrass-infused Coconut Cream, Birdseye Chili, Ginger Puree, Kaffir Lime Leaves, and sprinkled with Matcha Tea Powder. It was too different. I switched to Hangar One Mandarin and Tonic ($14) for the rest of the evening.

If you are staying or visiting the Cosmopolitan Hotel, it will be hard to miss the giant crystal strands of the Chandelier. It may not be a destination bar, but it is the best bar at the Cosmopolitan. Don't miss the opportunity to relax for a few rounds of drinks.

This is my favorite Fox Concept restaurant.  I couldn't believe it.  The place is beautiful and so far the food we have tasted has been amazing.  My husband cannot get enough of the Korean skirt steak.  I took a few bites and I almost wanted to order that.  I rather save my calories for the drinks and dessert.  The Fig and Ginger mule is my favorite, specially when Tanner makes it, although Christina did a really good job also.  I cannot have enough of the Croissant Bread Pudding, it is a diet buster, but so worth it.  Next time I am going to have the salmon appetizer, the person sitting next to us at the bar recommended it highly.  It looked delicious.

Move. the. hell. over, Earl of Sandwich. I found a new late-night lover and it's NY style pizza in Vegas. 

My girlfriend raved about this place, while I rolled my eyes and insisted we go to Earl instead. She convinced me and we walked on over after a long night at the Marquee (both conveniently located in the Cosmo) and we were all speechless after our first bite. 

We ordered a combo of white cheese, sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms. I've never been a HUGE fan of pizza, but this thin, wide slice was simple and flawless. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=3cIZSbjXqJxr59N_84xHKQ

Do you remember when Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael (TMNT) ended their adventure by tearing down a slice of ooey gooey cheese pizza? 

WE FELT EXACTLY LIKE THAT (or at least I did).

Love the music.
Love the entertainer.
Didn't love the performance.

Michael Jackson One reminded me how much I love Michael Jackson music and also reminded me how much I miss the entertainer that he was.

This Cirque du Soleil show was still very good ... less because of the "story" or "acts" and more for the pure joy, inspiration, and energy hearing Michael Jackson songs brings. Actually the story of 4 misfits searching for the white glove, shoes, hat, and sunglasses of MJ was downright silly. I really didn't care for Shy or Clumsy (the other two are called Sneaky and Smarty Pants). Less of them and more of the music could of made Michael Jackson One a 5-star experience truly worthy of the $155/ticket (plus additional Ticketmaster fees).

A few highlights:

 * A hologram of Michael Jackson dancing to "Man in the Mirror" was like watching a cool movie of Michael up close. 

 * The "Bad" performance brings back memories of break dancing ...

 * "Billie Jean" features dancers in multicolored lit suits and acrobats around the theater.

 * "Thriller" filled with trampolines and zombies was ok.

 * More than once, the show shares messages of hope and equality ... especially during "They Don't Care About Us."

 * "Smooth Criminal" may of been my favorite ... because I love the song and the "lean"

Some of the songs were:

 - Beat It
 - Leave Me Alone
 - Bad
 - Smooth Criminal
 - I'll Be There
 - Human Nature
 - Jam
 - They Don't Care About Us
 - Earth Song
 - Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'
 - The Way You Make Me Feel
 - Dangerous
 - Dirty Diana
 - Workin' Day and Night
 - Billie Jean
 - Thriller
- I Just Can't Stop Loving You
 - Man in the Mirror
 - Can You Feel It
 - Black or White
 - Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough

Those are some memorable tunes ... Forget about all the distractions and story. 

      Go for your love of the music. 
      Go for your love of the entertainer. 
      Remember how much you miss Michael Jackson.

The Showroom is located at 951 Wigwam Pkwy Henderson, NV. That's just off of 215 and the Gibson exit. Its kinda hard to find if you're not paying attention.

The showroom is really well setup and they have rocks and more rocks. flagstone, stones, gravel, soils and just about any landscape design info you could need. Way better than big box stores as they're locally owned and know the desert landscape and the best options.

Plus you can go to their website and see lots of rock examples and measuring tech info. Also they have a sister company that is Nevada outdoor Living with BBQ island and equipment, higher end patio furniture, waterfalls, statues, fire pits and more.
 
Prices seem high on the patio items and BBQ options but they mostly high end quality stuff that costs a little more. We got a deal on a small set and were happy. The rock options for the yard are still in the making but the prices are right and they deliver.

Staff was friendly and very helpful.

You will get a bunch of good ideas for your landscape dreams. Go in and check it out.

For my birthday weekend, I simply could not refuse an all inclusive triple threat package offered by the esteemed Wynn resort, which included complimentary tickets to Le Reve, room upgrades at the hipper and edgier Encore suites, VIP access to XS and free buffet! I know, It was pretty much a no-brainer in my book.  

Upon arrival at the Encore, parking was a breeze! Complimentary valet had me out of my car and in the registration line in a snap! Speaking of registration, I was convinced to "upgrade" my existing upgrade to a 60th floor panoramic suite. I know, I'm weak, but i'm glad I gave in! The upgraded room was magnificent! It came with an expansive living space with two plush queen beds, large bath with shower and separate soaking tub and outstanding views of the Las Vegas strip!  And who can forget about the remote controlled curtains and bathroom TV ;)  Tack on top of that premium gaming options, the exquisite resort grounds, and exceptional dining options, which include sumptuous tapas at La Cave and spectacular brunch fare at Tableau, and you've got yourself one happy birthday boy!   VIP access to the hottest clubs on the strip like XS and Surrender and premium shopping at premier boutiques like Herms, Chopard & Louis Vuitton doesn't hurt either.  If golfing is your thing, Steve Wynn's got the largest 18 hole golf course on the Strip!  

Honestly, I practically spent my entire weekend here and rarely felt the need to ever leave the grounds. Now that's not an easy feat for any resort given all the tempting hotel and entertainment options out there!  

Happy Times!

"Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound?
That only echoes through the night."

The French Canadian with pipes like an angel, the gifted Celine Dion.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#Kbvx9GtNiElinZ0HzpQ_Lw

Celine looked absolutely stunning, captivating the Friday night audience with her melodic voice & touching lyrics.  I felt quite a few goosebumps as she sang hits such as-

"But when you touch me like this,
and when you hold me like that.
I just have to admit,
that it's all coming back to me."

Our seats located in the rear orchestra had a great view of the stage, off center left.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#w6Yz3Dx-Wgzi0dRHERURxQ

Celine did several covers of other artists' songs, but I would've preferred if she sang more of her music library.  She even performed 2 hologram duets, one of which was interestingly enough, with herself.  Can't say I didn't get the most Celine Dion for the dollar ;p

"Cause I am your lady,
and you are my man.
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can."

Of course, the song that everyone anticipates, "My Heart Will Go On", lived up to all expectations & mesmerized the fortunate concert goers.  Towards the end of the song, Celine was surrounded by falling water that artistically cascaded down to make a magical experience, both audio & visual.  Think Fountains of Bellagio in reverse.

Can't have a concert w/o merchandise
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#84ZlgUYEgyq-PDy-eNr-YA

A true showstopper & deserving of headlining the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace,  Celine Dion puts on an extravagant show that will pull the heartstrings & touch you to your very soul.  Her powerful voice wil captivate & strike you with awe as to how such strength can come from such a small frame.  A tremendous show that absolutely has to be experienced before her run is done.

Highly recommend!

Scary things to me:
Paris Hilton has a career. 
Sarah Palin. Really. She's like the new Anita Bryant. 
My fathers' overgrown eyebrows. Trim, daddy, trim!
Droves of high schoolers leaving school just as I'm trying to find Barrio Cafe. 

Seriously. Like thousands of them. And I couldn't find the damn restaurant. What was I gonna do? Roll down the window (well, not roll down, seriously, who rolls down windows anymore?) and holler out in my best lispy voice, "Hey, squeeze me fellas, I'm going to a wine tasting at the Barrio Cafe. Y'all know where that is?" Since all teenagers carry guns, yes, that scared me. 

Finally. I found it. And entered. 

Cute. Cozy. Middle of the day, so empty. Great, vibrant art. And a very attentive and friendly staff. Often times at this time of day, restaurants really drop the ball. No ball dropping here.
I had La Paloma margarita which is made with a grapefruit soda. Think Squirt and Patron! And after a couple of these babies I was in el bano squirting out that Patron. Dee lish however. 

I ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar. Enchiladas of the Sea for my non Spanish speaking peeps. You know what? It was good. Not great. And the presentation was somewhat messy. I couldn't find the crab or the scallops (which were the size of the ends of q-tips by the way). They were lost in the sauce and the cheese. But I devoured it as the blue corn tortillas sang to me. My friend had a chickent torta. Big and rustic. Like Janet Reno. She loved it! 

I will most definitely be back. Hopefully I will not have to navigate through the plethora of pubescent people and hopefullyl I will pick that Barrio menu item that will blow my calcentinas off. 

Oh. That's blow my socks off. BTW. Adios for now mi yelpitas!

If you LOVE TO SHOP, this is pretty much a MUST STOP for you. But if you're like me who would rather gamble and eat in vegas than spend hours in a mall, this place is pretty intimidating. If it wasn't for the goal of finding Vosges chocolates at the most furthest point possible from where we were, i would rather be taking a nap with those men waiting for their women on the benches. The bad thing about this place, is if ur not interested in most of the stores, to get to one end to the other, you pretty much have to go through all the same stores you just passed, to get back if you want to stay out of the sun. I was looking for a secret passageway that would just transport me back to the casino (cuz i can walk miles through a casino if i wanted) but i couldn't find one. And that "show" is a bit creepy- u know what im talking about!

I give 4 stars though for housing Max Brenner Chocolate Heaven. 
Next time, i have to walk through this place, My first stop will be to get my Chocolate cookie from Max Brenner to make the backtracking more bearable and find Payard Patisserie.

One of things I love to do, is taking Sunday drives through Fountain Hills and stopping at the Fountain.

Since moving to the Valley, I've found there's something relaxing about doing this.  The streets are almost always empty and when you do encounter someone they are always deferring and polite.  I know we're more than halfway through 2013, but it reminds me of Sundays before the Blue Laws changed in the mid-1970s

Euro Pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz/euro-pizza-cafe-fountain-hills#hrid:5OBFv-7_N9nhSi04xgy90A   has a nice view of the fountain.  I would recommend it for lunch or dinner.  Ask to sit outside by the railing unless it's too hot.. It goes off every hour on the hour. http://www.fh.az.gov/fountain-park.aspx

Enjoy!

I was about to start a new weight lost challenge, but knew before that was to start I wanted something sweet and good!  I was in the area for lunch and saw that there was this sweet looking bakery at the end of the shopping center, so I knew that's where I was headed to!

I ordered the Salted Carmel Mocha cupcake to go, just from looking at it I was already drooling! You could clearly see the salt crystals on the top of the drizzled caramel!  Its my new craving, salty/sweet! Can't get enough it!

Got back to work and got to try it out! Let me tell you! The cake part of the cupcake was amazing! It was a moist chocolate with chocolate chucks inside! Yes!! Chucks!!! Yummy!!! The frosting, omg, you get a nice blend of mocha, caramel and salt!! OMG HEAVEN!!!!  This was a perfect cupcake for me!

Also for you ice cream lovin fools (I'm more of cake brownie person) they serve thrifty ice cream, I remember back in the day, that was the bomb ice cream!!  And if you have a crazy sweet tooth, they also have for sale shoots of frosting!!! Forget the cake and go straight to the sweet stuff!!!

Bacon and Eggs chocolate!!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LpJvitnw7vU5UW-3KE9kjA?select=05V2dKzM-R3p4oJRngv_Tw
Cute! 

If you love funky, exotic, expensive chocolate, this place is a good place to check out. They have these fun, funky chocolate bars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LpJvitnw7vU5UW-3KE9kjA?select=AgIkITFbopwNhh8aTyzBVQ you can find also at Whole Foods and some candy shops: Bacon Chocolate being their most famous i think. I've had it before and it's pretty good salty sweet. 
If i didn't have so many sweet places to hit, i would have liked to have had more time (and MONEY) to try their different truffles. A cool stop at the Forum Shops for a unique chocolate fix.

Taiwanese ice, Vegas style.

Am I in hell?  It's 110 degrees.  The Prius says 125 outside.  I'm seat belted in and  on the 15 when I realize I'm still wearing a hoody.  AC not cooling s#!%.  Finally, the trailer.  Frost Bites Shavery and relief.  Within minutes cup in hand.  Scoop one, light, fluffy, COLD, ahhhh.  Scoop two, body temperature falling, I'm forgetting I'm still wearing a hoody.  Scoop three; NOOOOO, it's melting!!!

This is good stuff.  Hawaii yeeps, think Frostcity on steroids.  Ribbons of fluffy goodness are shaved  from blocks of highly concentrated. naturally flavored ice.  Light, fluffy, delicious for the first two or three scoops then the texture changes it quickly becomes wet and "mushy", the sweetness becomes cloying.  Stick to the smallest size.  You can always get another.  (went back four times in one visit.  Scoop, scoop, toss, order, scoop, scoop, toss... Things we do for yelp)  

Flavors are strong and delish while the ice stays ice.  Vanilla (cloying sweetness), mango (floral, intense, cloying finish), green tea (bitter sweet tea flavor, best once melted), black sesame (nice sesame aroma, different, cloying finish).

Toppings are akin to a froyo bar, ie big chunks of fruits, nuts, crackers, candy, and cookies.  They detract and overpower the ice.  Too much crunch or texture and flavor.  

Inexpensive ranging from $2.25 to $6.25 for a family size cup.

Very good but more of a sweet treat than a chilling refresher (I guess that's why we have beer).

Let me give you this little tip:

Do not attend a Vegas Strip Club with your brothers and/or male family members.  Under any circumstances.  No ifs, ands or butts.  Just don't.  Seriously.

It's awkward.  And upsetting.  And awkward.  

Little did I know that while my cousin Lauren and I watched our respective brothers get lapfucked by a pretty pair named Pilot and Perfect, that our benefactor had already paid for us to get our own laps snizzed on by Mercedes, a tight little tan blonde.

She sauntered over, asked the boys of the group that weren't busy getting jacked in a backroom somewhere to buy her a redbull (redbull is stripper cryptonite) and then sorta draped over us...

And that's when we both got felt up. 

Mercedes:  You guys both have really big boobs!

Rachel and Lauren: ...

*Stripper grabs our boobs*

Mercedes:  Are they real?

Rachel and Lauren:  *nod simultaneously* 

: |

Mercedes:  Mine are fake.

Rachel and Lauren:  *shock and awe* You don't say?

*Rachel and Lauren get the hell out of Spearmint Rhino*

Getting felt up without dinner or even a drink purchased for me beforehand felt wrong, but watching my brother enjoy a lap dance a little too much was enough to hurtle my nice seafood dinner out of the depths of innerspace onto the floor.

I'll give it up for the strippers super soft skin, though.  It's nice.  And they smell good too.  Lauren and I are thinking about creating a perfume called "Stripper".  It will be a blend of cucumber melon and coconut nectar with glitter.  Lots of glitter.

Oh, and they have pretty nice fake boobs. 

If you like that sort of thing.

Yet another really good burger option for the Chandler/101 area!

Over the last few months we've gotten a Smash Burger and now a Burger21 last week. If UR into red meat, how can you go wrong?

I came here to grab something for a late night at the office and Burger21 hit the roof of my flavortown mouth. Sorry Fieri!  LOL

I kept it simple. The cardiac arrest Blue Cheese and Bacon burger for only $7.95 and a Chocolate Malt ($4.95) to wash it down. Both were good. 

Expect to pay $12 or so, if you order a soft drink. Don't  those iced cold beers looked good? There's a real high probably I'll be back with some co-workers real soon.

I've been awaiting a great eatery to replace the now defunct Chandler BBQ Company, and the wait was worth it.

I've had both the meat tortellini with bolognese and the marscapone with butternut squash ravioli, both made from scratch, both delightful.  I have huge expectations for their artichoke parmesan.  The restaurant does have a Facebook page when you can come and get a little extra info.  It's quaint and cute on the inside (seats 16) and they have a nice sized outdoor patio with ample seating, for al fresco dining.

The chef, Carlo, is friendly and excited for you to try his creations.  They have a chalkboard menu behind the counter, where you'll place your order, and a deli case with meats, cheeses and olives... soon to include desserts.

They offer hot and cold sandwiches, salads, pasta (with your choice of six sauces), and a few side dishes.  The beverage options include a fountain station.

Stop by for lunch or dinner.  Stay for the ambiance or get it to-go!

"What would you do if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key."-"With A Little Help From My Friends", Beatles

Beatles LOVE, with seating in the round, so not a bad seat in the house.  It's been showcased on the Strip for a long time now, and still draws the crowds nightly.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?select=z2BQr5kmAM5La12sRzvQSg#z2BQr5kmAM5La12sRzvQSg

We used Tix4Tonight to score some primo seats for cheap.  There's a part of the act where a surpise is brought out to the audience and we happened to be the very last row to participate.  I won't spoil it, but it was fun!

Pre-show, some clowns put on some comic relief by, literally, blowing smoke up people's arses.  Kinda creepy, kinda funny - it was great seeing people's reactions.

The highlights of Beatles LOVE, for me, were the aerialist during "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" & the act featuring "Strawberry Fields Forever".  Very touching.  I didn't care much for the halfpipes and rollerbladers.  Oh, and the music is on blast!  I'm talking loud!  So, just be mindful of that, if you have sensitive hearing.

Overall, a great show worth the money & time while in Vegas!  I highly recommend using Tix4Tonight for purchasing tickets the day before/day of.  Our seats were great & we saved a lot of money.  I'm generally not a Cirque du Soleil fan, but I highly enjoyed this eclectic & colorful show.

You know what? I watched the Pound Puppies too. I had dreams of rescuing one of those little Hogan's Heroes clones from their little prison, but in real life that isn't necessarily the best way to go.  Cooler never got parvo.

There is a lot of tramatic backstory to my dog ownership that i will spare you but lets say I have been scarred and it took a lot for me to agree to go here to even look.

Several kennels were full of dog shit...haha yeah dogs live there, no sick looking dogs laying in puddles of runny wrong coloured dog shit, it kennels with healthier looking dogs rolling around in the same sick shit. Yes I am being intentionally vile with my language to make the poit of how vile it was. SHIT!

We saw a dog that we loved. I said no; she said please...then a woman told us this dog was on "the list" yup his last day on god's green earth if he didn't get adopted so we took him. A day or so after we pick him up his little cough is turning into a scary and serious sounding wheez so we take him to the vet, over a thousand dollars later we are told the dog has both pnemonia and parvo...surprise surprise since we picked hi up he had dried SHIT in his fur (keep in mind he was not to be bathed for two weeks because of having just been neutered, yes a freshly operated on dog with dried shit in his fur)
 Oh and puppies don't really recover from that sort of thing so w paid the very nice vet to kill out dog...euthenasia...super....

As she bawls her eyes out I man up to call and let the MCACC know hoping they can take some preventative measures, ya know like not let other dogs roll in the shit that he left. (Parvo is super contagious). They let us know the only action they would take was to make note in our file so that if we went to adopt again they would know we didn't already have a dog in the household...yup...My next dog will be adopted from a much more responsible shelter. I understand low budgets and whatnot but how much does it cost to hose runny shit out of a kennel? GRRR.

I really like this place because it has a lot of potential. One of the tweaks I would make is to get a decent honey mustard dipping sauce. Also, I thought calling out people's name in the restaurant with their food order was annoying. I guess I find that annoying because I was trying to get some reading in during the lunch break. I did like their ketchup dispenser. No more worrying about ketchup splattering on your shirt. Next time I'll have to take a picture of it.

This was my first time in a Raising Cane so I decided to order the Caniac which consists of 6 chicken strips plus a bunch of crinkle fries and a soda for about $8 dollars. I thought you get a lot for your money. I enjoyed the chicken strips but they would have tasted much better with the honey mustard sauce.

Unfortunately, Joe's was already our second choice of the night (after seeing the long line at Bacchanal) and we weren't going in search of a 3rd restaurant. We were hungry, so, let's eat at Joe's.

Luckily, the other food was pretty tasty. We started with some glasses of inexpensive Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon and a Colossal Lump Crab Cake ($17). I liked the big bits of crab that didn't require (or have) much other seasoning (4 stars). 

Equally, the Chilean Sea Bass with Miso Glaze & Bok Choy ($37) and 20 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye Steak ($53) were 4-star entrees. The sea bass was flaky and the miso subtle. Meanwhile, the juicy and tender rib eye was meaty despite not being an elite steak. As a side, we split a creamy Wild Mushroom Mac and Cheese ($11) that excited thanks to the mushrooms and disappointed with lame cheese (3 stars).

Sadly, the service was weak. We suffered long gaps between being seated, ordering, getting food, or service. We wanted to try the acclaimed Key Lime Pie, but chose to try a different place at the Forum Shops at Caesars rather than put up with the poor service.

Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab is famous in Miami for fantastic Stone Crabs and Key Lime Pie. We didn't get to try either. Instead, Joe's became a basic Joe Schmo steak and seafood chain with high prices for the average Joe.

Crab Corner brought me back to my childhood with their Maryland blue crabs. I cried tears of joy when I tasted them for the first time. I had searched high and low for crabs that were seasoned just like I remembered them from back in the day and I hadn't found exactly what I was looking for until I found Crab Corner. This is easily one of my favorite places in Vegas. I just wish it was closer to where I live! 

The guys that own the place are as awesome as their food is. They're very friendly and are helpful with whatever you need. Good service, good times. Bring a bunch of friends and have at it. Crab Corner has a casual atmosphere that is perfect to drink a few brewskies and get down and dirty with some crabs. Bibs and a hearty appetite recommended!

This review is dedicated to my late grandfather, whom I acquired some of my writing genes from. He passed away before the new year. I used to eat Maryland blue crabs by the swimming pool at his house in the summertime. I will miss him.

A 24 hour cheap hot sandwich place is a vegas jackpot!!!  I always find myself having sandwich cravings and i'd been spending weeks looking at the reviews. I had decided way before i stepped into the store at PH, that i would be ordering the Full Montagu- Roast beef and turkey!!! 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=pqiqUiWVESs9LubdKK2zcw
We were still full from breakfast, so i didn't get to try a second sandwich as i had hoped (i'm definitely getting the canonball meatball sammie next time). I'm sure after i try a few more different sammies here, i would upgrade to a 5, but based on just the one i had, i just needed a little something more. More mayonaisy sauce? Avocado? Not sure. But i am not craving it, as i do with Cooks, Mendo, Caps or Langers. But... I will be back for sure to get the cannonball and get ANOTHER brownie whoopie pie !! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=DbdvnjAtWRE2Hj0_MbX26Q

I don't really want to put art, and the experience of it into text. Because good art transcends it. 

It won't do you much good - for me to oooo and aaaah over the hours spent wandering through a large poignant building of installation art pieces. Describing in extreme detail all of the sounds, sensations, and lack of both which I experienced in each art piece. 

Nope - it won't do either you or me - any good.

Especially when I have a word limit here.

Cause you won't be able to picture what I type. No matter how hard I try. I'll ruin the surprise of certain exhibits. The mystery.  And it will only frustrate me - that I can't convey how intrinsically cool and alluring the Mattress Factory is.

I mean the name alone is cool. Sexy even.

But. I will tell you that you should go.

If you're in Pittsburgh for even a couple of hours. Don't waste time on things like food, sports, or anything else you may have planned on doing. Just go to the Mattress Factory. 

Go alone if you have to.

But even better.

Find someone that you enjoy spending time with. Someone who lets you say "that's so cool...." over and over again about every exhibit. Someone who may even see each piece the way you do. Or maybe not.

And then just pass away the day at the Mattress Factory. Wandering and experiencing. You won't have to worry about uptight museum people following you around. Or tired tourists. Or "is that it?" art. Or sterile marble floors - which echo with every step. You just don't need to worry about much when you go here. 

The Mattress Factory is the perfect place to let yourself slip. If even a little.

It's a special, one of a kind place, nestled in a random neighborhood, away from the hustle. Away from packed bars. 

Away from it all.

We came here last evening to listen to that great voice which is Mandy Patinkin. Wow it was even better than we could have imagined.

His vocal range is incredible. He started with some old old Broadway tunes from the 40s and 50s. Then moves on and starts softly speaking these words without music:

Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see

So you say to yourself. No!  He's not going to sing it. And, he doesn't. He just leads into the middle of another old Broadway tune. So you think, what was that?  Well, it was a tease. 

He starts having a dialogue with the audience about his marriage and wife.  But then comes back to it. Now accompanied by Paul Ford on the piano. He sings the entire song. Bohemian Rhapsody. All the parts. Wow! Freddie Mercury would have been proud!

That's how the evening went. Interspacing old show tunes with some more recent melodies.  He sang a few from Steven Sondheim's "Sundays in the Park with George".  It was a show he was nominated for a Tony.  The best of the night, was his singing of Oh Shenandoah. What made it special was his stopping midway to recite the first part of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. He goes back to Oh Shenandoah, then finishes the second half of Gettysburg Address and the last verse of Oh Shenandoah. Absolutely beautiful.

Surprisingly no tunes from Evita. A show he won the Tony for his role of Che, and made famous with Patti Lepone.  He finished the evening with a tune from the movie Ragtime and the music of Randy Newman. 

There were two curtain calls. He and his pianist Paul Ford looked exhausted after a non-stop ninety minutes. We left feeling as if we had just enjoyed something special. This was our first time to the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts and we were very impressed.

Electric Daisy Carnival is not just a destination, a place, a celebration, a setting, or a music festival. It's a life changing experience, an adventure... a magical wonderland! It was an ethereal, surreal journey. 

This year EDC is my first and I would not change it in any other way because of the memories we created together with friends and the new. So much fun/cool experience! 

There is no way I can describe EDC because you have to be there in order to feel the experience with other 350,000+ people. 

The goods: 
-The largest rave in America stretched out approx. 1.5-2 miles apart with over 350,000+ attendees. Holy. 
-Spectacular decors and stage set ups. I loved the Kinetic Field set up the most! That celestial castle mimicked Little Mermaid's castle of gold or Disney's Sleeping Beauty castle or some form of cathedral structure! Very remarkable and incredible. THE LIGHT INSTALLATIONS ARE PHENOMENAL! Now I can understand why Insomniac spent over $35 million dollars+ toward the productions. 
-It goes from dusk to sunrise. 
-Free water, but the line can be cruel-some. Stay hydrated please!
-65+ carnival rides are fun to ride with your friends and make good memories. 
-The artists! Hardwell, Tiesto, Calvin Harris, Dash, Avicii, Kaskade, Carnage, Alesso, and all of the biggest EDM DJs you know. 
-You'll meet some of the friendliest people on the planet. I got to PLUR with some of amazing new friends! 
-THE FIREWORKS. 

-The bads: 
-Beer is overpriced.. $8 for a can of Budlight? 
-No cell signal, so don't rely on catching receptions. Bring some walkie talkies.
-Parking. It's the worst when trying to get out of Speedway. 
-Traffic. It takes minimum of 45 minutes to 4 hours to get to the carnival from the Strip. 
-Running out of toilet papers in the rest rooms, so bring some for yourself. 

All in all, I had the best experience with friends I will forever cherish! This is something everyone in their 20s should experience once in their lifetime.

Thank you Pasquale Rotella, CEO and Founder of Insomniac Productions, for making this happen every year. It was literally the BEST WEEKEND OF MY LIFE surrounded with good and positive vibes. Rolling bowling balls. Awesome kandis. Oh my gawd, awesome DJs. PLUR. Sleep is for the weak. #insomiac. EAT SLEEP RAVE REPEAT!

See you next year under the electric sky!

This Swiss bakery has been my go-to spot for cakes and macarons. I first noticed this bakery on Yelp, and the owner makes everything from scratch with natural ingredients. Foot traffic is rare, and the interior encompasses large glass cases, tiled floor, and colorful chocolates and European pastries to fill out the dcor.

The quarter sheet Custard Cake ($29.98) came with soft spongy cake, custard, and airy textures with moderate sweetness. My friends raved about its light-tasting qualities and I really enjoyed it too. The website says the cake can feed 15-20 people, but I always have leftovers to share with others.

The quarter sheet Tiramisu ($29.98) came with good moisture and mascarpone flavor, but the consistency of the custard needed to be more refined. The overall flavor was borderline bland, and without rum this cake could use another anchor such as an aromatic coffee to render that special effect. It was a solid cake, but I have had better.

I absolutely loved their Macarons ($1.50). It all started with a crisp airy texture, followed by a soft chew and persistent flagrant ganache at the center. I have tried the Red Velvet, Pistachio, Chocolate Orange, Pumpkin Pie, Almond, Blueberry, and Coconut flavors. They were all striking, memorable, and the fruit flavors were particularly delectable. The textures and flavors on these Macarons were consistent on each of my previous visits. It never fails.

Each time the service was forward, efficient, and responsive. I find it helpful to communicate directly with the owner, as he is knowledgeable and always finds ways to meet my expectations. Eventually I'd like to order off the menu and try the Saint Honore Cake, Poppy Seed Bread, and other Macaron flavors.

This is a nice stop for a sweet treat. You can go inside or they have a drive-thru. The girl at the register was friendly and helpful with the going over the menu and their popular items. I had a "Dole Whip Float" priced at $4.50 for a medium. It soft-serve pineapple with pineapple juice and whip cream. Yum! If you are a pineapple lover then this is for you! It was a nice treat and I will try the next one with orange juice instead just to see what it is like. They have other items on the menu like broaster chicken, sandwiches, salads, coffee and a kids menu. I have found a new stop on my way back to Vegas!

Located on the third floor by the pool table in the Cosmo, you'll find a long dark hallway flanked with vintage record covers leading to a small pizza joint serving freshly baked pizza pies. It's really no secret that the secret pizza puts out some of the best late night eats this side of the strip! But most importantly, if you're staying at the Cosmo, there's no need to trek out in inclement weather or battle the strip crowd for good grub either.  

Thankfully, on the late night I stumbled in, the line wasn't too obnoxiously long. Be warned, on certain nights when the Marquee or Chelsea has an event, you could be waiting for quite awhile for your slice, so plan accordingly! 

Overall, the pizzas are very tasty. Thinly sliced NYC style (for you to fold and eat)
with a variety of topping options. My personal favorites are the works and white pizzas. They've got loads of condiments like oregano, granulated garlic, cheese, chili flakes etc for you to customize your pies, well. 

Happy Eats!

Gorgeous pool where the mermaids play. It's such an idyllic setting with the cascading waterfalls and calm waters. Add an alcoholic beverage to complete the picture and you're all set. Relax in this beautiful scene or meet some fun people to party with. Anything's fair game in Vegas, after all!

There are plenty of lounge chairs if you just want to kick back and recover from a long night. Grab a towel and catch some sun. Make sure to wear sunblock anytime you're outside in Las Vegas. The desert sun will own you. Guaranteed.

If you've napped long enough, take your drink with you into the pool and meet some highly interesting folks. You know how it is. When everyone's drinking, anyone can become your new friend.

So whether you're seeking the water nymph of your dreams or just have some fun, this is the place to be!

DATE TIP: The huge waterfall may *seem* like a nice romantic idea, but it's NOT romantic to piggyback someone right under the waterfall's force and just stand there forever. Once you get to the other side though, it becomes a private oasis.

This is a very chill place to kick back and have a casual meal before and after a hard night of gambling or taking in a show. 

The last time I was here was before The Doors cover band Strange Days show. I had a Rueben sandwich with fries. The service was great and the Rueben was excellent as well. I'll need to try different items the next time around based on some other Yelper reviews.

Vegas requires a surprisingly large amount of thinking. Does the club pay for the cab? Sometimes. One-guy-one-girl rule? Usually. Be sure to tip... or not. Buy her a drink... or not.  $30 cover?? 

Did I just go to a strip club or do my taxes?

I'm at a point in my life where i'm trying to find meaning and depth in the world... and this is the last place in the last city I should be in. It just doesn't do it for me. But it's always good to try new things, and thus lovable Yelper, AJ, made sure I didn't leave without getting my first lap dance.

Keane: So.. uh... what are you into?
Girl: *surprised look*
Keane: Uh.. I meant... things to do.
Girl: I've been going to a lot of late night clubs... Oh! You have really soft hair. What do you use?
Keane: ... shampoo.

*examines my shirt*

Girl: What is "Yelp"?

Aw, shit. Now it's on...

Booked the Penthouse and all i can say is....WOW!!!!

The panoramic view of the strip from the corner Penthouse was breathtaking and the spacious rooms were elegant, modern & clean.  The beds you ask? Nice and firm, just the way i like it! Flat screens in every room. What's next? the toilet? lol
Oh, and the fully automated shades and daily "turn down" service was pretty impressive, too!
  
Throughout my weekend stay, service was on point and the hotel staff didn't miss a beat.  Even on my last day, they provided complimentary limousine service to the airport!  Very swank.

My only complaint would be that my darn ears kept popping as I rapidly ascended the elevator to the 54th floor.  But hey the view from that soaring height was worth a few annoying pops in my ear and luckily after a couple of days, i adjusted ;)  

The spa at the hotel was also clean, contemporary and most importantly, relaxing. They had all the facilities i've come to expect from a fine resort hotel spa (i.e. TV lounge with refreshments, expansive fitness room, jacuzzi & whirlpool, steam room, and sauna.  

Located inside the newly built City Center, this smoke free & eco-friendly hotel is within walking distance to all the local hotspots, dining, and entertainment on the main strip.
If you're looking for a relaxing recovery after a night of complete decadence, this just might be your ticket to paradise.

Happy Times!

Encore Beach Club is G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S. Kaskade Sundays is what's up. Like Wet Republic and Rehab, it's all about scene and be seen - you will be surrounded by beautiful bodies. Unlike Wet and Rehab, you will NOT be afraid to get into the pool! 

Mr. Wynn did an amazing job getting this luxurious beach club built in a matter of months. It's located at the front of Encore - I don't even recall them being under construction when I was there in April. The layout is beautiful with three pools and two levels of cabanas, and rainfall "cages" with a stripper pole in the center if you want to show off your skills. 

Kaskade definitely brings the party on Sundays, but the vibe is definitely more chill than Wet and Rehab (hence the cleaner pools). He's set up right in the middle in front of Surrender (the nightclub) and there's a small area for people to dance. 

We got in for free (doesn't hurt to know the promoters), however cover is $30 for women and $50 for men. You'll easily drop $100+ on drinks, so you might want to consider reserving a lounge chair ($150 drink minimum) or if you can splurge, reserved a day bed or cabana (some with your own personal see-through pool), which will run you thousands. Otherwise you can grab a towel and post up along the edge of the pool.

There are two bar areas, a few tables to gamble and "The Grill" to order food. Share a few salads, which are huge, and the turkey club wrap - the more healthy options on the menu. Food babies are not attractive here.

Horrible Horrible Horrible!!!!!!

For a dedicated customer whose been loyal for over 10 years, I've never been more disappointed in an airline than JetBlue 

Our flight was scheduled to depart at 2:45 pm over the New Years weekend and while we were waiting in line to check in, our flight was suddenly cancelled due to inclement weather.  That's not all. The rescheduled flight wasn't set to leave until three whole days later! Holy moly, i had to get back to work! That being said, they made no attempt to accommodate me or pay for the inconvenience. No hotel, no taxi voucher or nothing. They did offer a refund if I didn't want to take the ridiculous flight that was leaving three days later. I think you can figure out the choice I made. The heavens were looking over me that day and I managed to nab a late flight leaving to LAX 8+ hours later that evening. 

I swore never again to fly JetBlue but when February came around, I had to make reservations for a business trip and because my Amex preferred airline was JetBlue, I just took the leap of faith. I flew out of long beach with no hassle but when it came time to flying back home, trouble was brewing yet again. 
This time, the flight gate was changed last minute without any changes made on the overhead flight monitors. I was chilling in the airport lounge and checking the monitors periodically, and there was no gate change announcement until I arrived at the gate to depart. To add insult to injury, they stated the 5pm flight was delayed until 7pm for maintenance issues. 2 hours later, they dropped the bomb on us and said the flight was cancelled. I scrambled again, just like I did in January to find another flight. Thankfully I found another flight with absolutely no help from JetBlue whatsoever. JetBlue emailed me and offered a 75$ credit towards my next flight. Hmmmmm, would you fly again with them when your flight was cancelled twice in less than 6 weeks? I think not. I tried calling and asking for a refund or reimbursement for all the inconveniences (ie having to find another flight same night, leaving at a much later time than my scheduled flight, no accommodations, driving from Santa Ana airport to long beach to get my car, etc) The rep responded with a resounding "No compensation, only 75$ credit towards another flight" I asked to speak to a supervisor, she again responded with "No"  I'm done with this airline and if you have any common sense, you should avoid them like the plague. Horrible service, no regard or consideration whatsoever for their customers and completely unreliable.

Vegas' top sushi restaurant.

NOT an AYCE joint.  ZERO Americanized rolls.  PURE Edo style sushi.  

Before all my sushi loving yeeps book the trip; meaning no disrespect to the Vegas food scene, Kabuto is the best in Vegas, but does not come close to touching the perfection that is the two Michelin star Urasawa in LA.  Granted, it does not come close to the $500 per person price tag of Urasawa either.

Rambling food history lesson:  This is classic  Edo style sushi born from necessity (no refrigeration in the early 19th century).  Large fillets of fish (toro) wont spoil as fast at room temperature like small fish (saba) with their bacteria filled intestines or turn rancid from their oxidizing fat (ie anago).  Yummy thoughts.  So, big fish = raw, small fish = marinated, oily fish = cooked.  Most are brushed in shoyu  and include wasabi, to inhibit spoilage.

Culinary artistry / craziness has taken over and the humble street food is now served in minimalist zen surroundings,  beautifully sauced and presented the way the chef feels it should be.  Its considered disrespectful for the diner to alter the sushi.

Although you can order individual sushi, the omakase ($80) or nigiri sampler ($48) is the best way to experience the ideal progression of flavors.

Selections change daily depending on availability.  The seafood is sourced globally.  All extremely fresh.  The chu-toro and o-toro correctly graded and a fatty delight.  The giant clam and ama ebi cloyingly sweet with the perfect oceanic finish.  Firm texture.  The list goes on and on.

Very good quality, delicately seasoned, short grain rice.  Nice compaction, holding its form but not breaking the individual grains.  

For all its refinement, this is one bite finger food (don't expect pieces of fish so large it slides down your throat and sticks out of your mouth at the same time). Toss the chopsticks aside and dive right in!

Highly recommended.

Recognize the chef?  Bravo's Top Chef contestant, consulted for XXX, worked at world class YYY, Michelin Chef ZZZ says he's "the greatest thing since boiled chicken".  Celebrity chef or otherwise, food must speak for itself.

Dishes are artfully presented.  Portions are very small for the price.  Flavors run from boring to interesting to "delicious but" to bizarre.  Examples:

Watermelon salad with goat cheese, a classic, is very refreshing but could benefit from a drizzle of aged balsamic to boost sweetness and complexity.  The hint of wasabi does nothing.  The watermelon lacked the "in season" fruity goodness.  Boring.

Quinoa fried rice with sun dried pineapple and tofu is intriguing.  Good first bite but unless you are a quinoa lover, the texture of the and nutty flavor of the grain quickly becomes one dimensional.  The pineapple lacks the acidic punch to brighten the dish.  Interesting.

The roasted duck breast is delicious.  Perfectly cooked, mid rare.  Mineral duck flavors enhanced by the honey.  A great side of grilled baby bok choy to add bitterness and crunch.  Just be sure to scrape off the ridiculous addition of children's breakfast cereal.   Blood soaked Kix.  Really?  Delicious but.

Miso toffee ice cream.  Wait for it.... Disgusting.  The first bite is good,  but with each successive bite, the miso flavor builds to the point your brain tells you not to swallow.  Fermented ice cream.  Bizarre.

Very small selection of micro brews.  Nice selection of sake.  High off Strip prices.

Bottom line, the food is not for everyone.  There are many better options for more globally accepted creativity.  You're better off looking to the Strip for excellence.

I think my friends secretly hate me...I'll give the good, the drinks are pretty damn good. Some really nice eye candy.

The bad why is it so sticky??? I'm hoping spilled drinks and not body fluids......I understand college bar but ladies have some class as much as I love the hot outfits seriously pick a person not 8. I did actually buy 2 guys drinks for having the dirtiest pick up lines. I agree on other reviews if your're looking for a STD, maybe roofied this is the club for you.

The Mecca.  The holiest of all things burger.  It's a west coast operation, so I only get the chance to In-N-Out once every few years (insert joke here).  But it never disappoints!

The menu is as simple as it gets - burger, cheeseburger, fries, drinks.  But don't let that fool you, there's nothing simple about it.  I'm guessing the most popular menu item is the Double-Double...two patties with two slices of cheese.  From there you can go off menu and order any kind of burger you want.  The first number is patties, the second is cheese slices.  Haven't had the chance to try a 4x4 yet, but that will be happening in the next few months.  Beyond that, you can also dabble in the secret menu and get your burger protein style (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun), or animal style (includes grilled onions and animal sauce).  It's impossible to go wrong.

French fries can also be ordered animal style, but the plain version is just as good.  One of each is even better.  And as far as milkshakes, you have to go with Neapolitan...a combo of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.

It's that simple, yet that perfect.

One of the most unique steakhouses in Vegas offering a rare culinary delight:  MONTHS aged dry aged beef.

Read on, I promise not to talk about what the process really is.

Called "Riserva", the once USDA prime beef is aged six to 11 months before being trimmed and served.  The result is unlike "younger", 30-75 day dry aged beef.  The shorter aged steaks retain a beefy texture, very tender with a pronounced nutty, bleu cheese aroma and flavor with a massive umame finish.  The months aged beef, think prosciutto.  Broiled rare to mid rare at a low temperature.  There is no thick outer crust.  The flavor is mild and nutty with only the hint of bleu cheese aroma.  The beef is dense and oily.  It has a very different mouth feel.  It is extremely sweet.  Amazing but not for everyone.

Tip:  Request the "Riserva" steaks when making reservation.  The amount of aging doesn't matter.  The piece is selected when it has reached the correct characteristics.

Traditional dry aged steaks are excellent.  The rib eye and porterhouse both possess the classic umame packed dry aged goodness.  Excellent sear, tender and juicy.  Both steaks are meant to be shared.  If dining alone, both the bone in New York strip and Bone in filet mignon offer the same experience as the porterhouse in a more manageable 16oz portion.

All steaks are rubbed with rosemary before cooking.  It imparts a strong, woodsy flavor that enhances the sweetness of the beef.

Not into aged beef?  The 20oz bone in veal chop is excellent.  Natural, pasture raised veal, it has a light beef flavor with a soft texture.  It's dry rubbed with thyme and porcini powder that imparts a very flavorful earthy goodness.  A drizzle of fresh olive oil adds the perfect richness.

For starters, the fried calamari, "Shrimp alla Diavola", and Bucatini Amatriciana are excellent but why fill up.  You can get these at Batali's Italian eatery, B&B Ristorante.

The restaurant captures the spirit of Italy, an enjoyable, casual, jovial evening.  Don't go with an elegant stick up your, you know.  The bread will make your hands oily and gnawing the bone is encouraged.

Bravo!

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-spice-market-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:T3hJAv1ROUL5uVY92C2o4A

I had a plan to pace myself so I could enjoy the entire day of buffets.....well, of course that plan went out the window with Buffet #1.....and it was downhill from there....I was stuffed by the time we were done with the Flamingo Buffet.  Needless to say, I gained 5.5 lbs after this ordeal.....and I'm still trying to work off the lbs in the gym.

Overall, it was a fun time and I recommend giving it a try at least once.  The schedule we had was perfect and we were on time for every buffet, except the last one.....but that was because there was a concert that night at Planet Hollywood and it made parking a little longer than expected.  If I was to do it again, I'd only go to 3 Buffets.....the Rio, Harrah's, and Planet Hollywood.  I'd have Dinner at the Rio & Planet Hollywood, and Lunch at Harrah's.  Those were the 3 best buffets out of the group and you can easily fit 3 of those in a 24 hour schedule.

The 7 in one day was very agressive and I won't do it again.....but I don't regret participating in the event.....all of the Yelpers in our group had a blast.

My new favorite lunch place in Vegas! I've visited Milos in Greece and New York and am so excited that there is now one in LV. 

They offer a set lunch for $22. You get the choice of several appetizers, a few different mains and dessert. 

We ended doing one set lunch and ordering the Milos special, a must when at any Milos! It's lightly fried zucchini and eggplant with tzatziki and fried Greek cheese. OMG, I could eat this all day long. Plus their tzatziki is like yogurt of the gods. It's super thick and filled with cucumbers. 

For the set lunch, we ended paying a lot of supplemental charges for the octopus and the lobster spaghetti but it was worth it. I think next time I'd do the dips to start instead of the octopus, but regardless everything was wonderful. 

The atmosphere is bright, with some seating outside, which is so lovely for lunch. I hate feeling like you are in the basement of a casino for lunch and that is not the case at Milos. 

Dessert was some of that thick Greek yogurt with strawberry puree. We licked the bowl. You get the picture. Have you booked a table yet?!

I've only been here for lunch but based on some reviews regarding breakfast I may be missing something.

The first time I went in here I was kind of overwhelmed by all the choices. It didn't make it any easier trying to decipher the menu plastered above the grill area, that was kind of awkward. I'm not certain if they have a paper menu.

I struck up a conversation with a regular and he pointed me to the Gyros special. I ordered that and didn't really dig it too much. The next trip I tried the pastrami and was not too impressed. Both meals BTW, were ginormous. Next, I said to myself if this was an IQ Test and you had to choose something from a place that was called the BURGER Factory what should you choose? Burger, dummy. Yes, I tried a burger the next time through and liked it. So I would rate the burgers a 4 and the rest of the stuff a 2 to average out to a 3 star rating for the total body of work.

Also, they take credit cards. So this is not a cash only place.

You can't say no to these amazing slabs of meat!

I ordered the **Steak Bordelaise** which is topped with caramelized onions and accompanied by frites. The steak is incredibly tender and melts in your mouth! The sweetness from the caramelized onions blended so well with the meaty juiciness. And I couldn't stop popping those frites in my mouth, one after another. They had the perfect texture: thin and crisp yet dense in flavor.

The **Paris Romance** cocktail, elegant and refreshing, is composed of Malibu Rum, Amaretto, a splash of pineapple juice, a dash of Grenadine, grapefruit juice, and some secret magic ingredients. Served in a chilled martini glass, it is the perfect accompaniment to such a fine-tuned meal.

The decor and ambiance reflect classy French charm, without being overbearing in the slightest. For dinner it was dimly lit and offered a warm comforting vibe. Service was flawless, although I have to say we made it pretty easy since we all knew we wanted steak and frites. 

You will definitely get the bang for your buck here. Upscale experience but at way more reasonable prices than many other restaurants in Las Vegas. Use your $$$ for going out later that night or hitting up the tables. :)

DATE TIP: Oui oui!

While it's expensive and far from flawless, Rose. Rabbit. Lie. is the most unique venue I've ever been to. I can see people having a love/hate relationship here, but trust me, it's worth going just to find out which camp you belong to. 

As mentioned earlier, drink prices are absurd. $16 a drink, including beers. Yes, I bought my friend a $16 Stella. Gross. However, this isn't just a bar. There are a ton of roaming entertainers, including a a piano player, an 8-bit band(?), a burlesque dancer, tap dancers, magicians, a beatboxer, aerialists, etc. performing every 15 min or so. So you're paying for an overall experience, which is cool. I spoke to some diners about the performances and they all said they were welcome distractions and didn't take anything away from the meal. So there's that...

Take some time to explore the different rooms and all of their features. You'll find little quirky things all over the place. At midnight the venue opens up and there's a small show with many of the roaming performers. In the end, I dropped $100 on drinks, but was entertained thoroughly for 2.5 hours. Sure, that $$ could've bought a Cirque tik, but this is a totally different experience.  

Full disclosure: I didn't eat a thing nor did I see a ticketed performance (midnight show only).

Hippies scare me.     So in my preparation to go to this place I ordered Xanax from an on-line Canadian pharmacy, which I have been taking for three days now.  Bought a tazer from Spy Headquarters in case one of them tries to hold me down and pours patchouli oil on me.  The fifth of gin that I slammed in the parking lot really helped with that last bit of extra courage that I needed to partake my journey into hippie-land.

It was all for nothing. No hippies around, just a teenager behind the counter.  This place is tiny and the counters are about at mouth level. I don't know how anyone under 7'6" could easily eat off of them.  

Anyways for $5 flat, you get a kick ass burger, a school lunch bag half full of well seasoned skin-on fries, and a can of soda.   It's true that the fries could have been a bit more crispy but they tasted so good I got over it real quick.

I'd be afraid to ask what the special ingredient is because they might say "it's organic, don't panic".  

Jerry's dead, but this place lives on.  Thanks hippies!

My only complaint about Short Leash is that they don't follow me around town in the food cart, which means I cannot eat delicious hot dog concoctions all day! How unfair is that?!?

Well, Amber... we all know you are a VEGAN, so why do you want to be followed around by a hot dog cart? 

Well, Reader... Short Leash has VEGGIE DOGS! That is right... this delicious, convenient, amazing food cart has VEGGIE DOGS!

The bread, however, is not vegan. But that is fine, because they chop up your wiener into little bite sized pieces and load it up with one of the many (50+??) ingredients they have available. And when you don't get it with bread, you get two!

I top my double wiener with pinto beans, sauteed onions, green chilies, jalapenos, and tomatoes. I'm going to come up with a name and have them name one special after me.

Excellent customer service, positive vibe, delicious, high-quality ingredients, and I legally get to say wiener six times in 1 review!

Wiener wiener wiener!

It really pains me to give this place a two star rating. The owner and the staff are really nice people but my emotions from this place has ranged from not bad to this sucks over the last few visits.

The last time I was there my burger and fries were gnarly bad. The fries were not cooked and tasted like oil and the burger had me thinking what was I thinking by coming here for lunch. Well at least I got a free soda by checking in on Yelp.

As painful as it may sound, even hippies must retire one day.

My favorite free attraction in Vegas.  Yes, even beating the street people giving out cards with naked women on them J/K ;p

The Fountains of Bellagio are located in the heart of the Strip, where visitors can enjoy a beautiful display of water being shot high into the sky, in tune with music.  
http://www.vegas.com/attractions/on-the-strip/bellagio-fountains/

Strolling along the Strip, especially at night, it's a great sight to behold, whether with friends or your significant other.  Last time I was there, we saw the Fountains with Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" playing.  Later on, on the way back to our hotel, we saw it again with Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On".  Such an extravagant spectacle for the senses!  There's just something about an oasis of moving water right before your eyes in the middle of the searing desert,  music tickling your tympanic membranes.  All for free!

Great views from the front of Bellagio, or when dining at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  The show runs every 15-30 mins, with the start times depending upon the day.  

You can't miss this attraction at the Strip, literally & figuratively.  I know when I'm in Vegas again, I'll certainly enjoy checking out the Fountains of Bellagio several times more.

Highly recommmend!

Just got this message from one of the owners (their review is under Jestin M.) 

this is me one of the owner of Tina's cafe.  you are obviously a poor idiot who is miserable in life.  If you have a nerve, you should've tell your complaint to us instead of crying out on yelp.  We have so many flowers and will continue doing great. Tina will bit the fack out of you if you come and let her know who you are.  ASS HOLE. Go back to your Mexico and eat corn with your whore mother.  by the way, your picture looks like a a guy who is infected with some kinds of disease.   Your women is ugly as you btw (lol)

So after this I personally called and spoke with a manager, they confirmed Jestin works there. Even though I was being cordial with my tone and trying to be helpful in saying that this was my experience, maybe others are experiencing the same thing and that can help fix the problem, they proceeded to say a few things I wont retype here and hung up. 

I responded back and so did they. If you want to read that here is a screen shot of that: 
http://i.imgur.com/PvcBz.jpg

So it was not enough for them to say that message. They just texted me this right now (since I called with my cell). 

"You keep mentioning 5yrs old about your stupid compain, we will report your info to be investigated if you are a child melester. Tina has a right not serve you for the safty of our customer. Take your little 10 dollar to mcdonald's. Lol"

Here is a screen shot of the text I just got from the business phone number:

So if you feel like this is a place you would like to try out after reading this, by all means take your chances.

They INTERPRETATE the music so well!!! 
(Holla at ABDC season 1 fans!)

It was very difficult keeping the show tickets a secret from my dude- a huge Jabba fan. Bought them about a month in advance, we got 3rd row seats for about $70.00 each. Pricey indeed, but it was so worth it to see them live, so close and their 1.5 hour show was packed to the brim with Jabba-ness. When i could finally reveal the big surprise of the tickets, we were full of giddy smiles the entire time. From the very entertaining preshow until the end, we were fully ENTERTAINED!!!! 
Actually reading some of the things in the negative reviews made me sad and little butt-hurt that they were not ENTERTAINED! These are no skinny lizards- but some of the baddest mofos i've ever seen dance. I didn't give a f*ck if some of the story was a little odd or didn't really make sense to me the whole time. I was just happy to see them recreate some of their ABDC performances as well as a whole slew of new routines. ABDC fans will recognize special guest appearances by SuperCr3W members, which was awesome. I loved the playfulness of the glow in the dark sequence, the oldskool segment and the Single Ladies ofcourse. I especially liked the KB solos and it was fun spotting the individuals behind their masks, like Phil's booty shaking and Rynan's impressive headspins. 

A MUST SEE for TRUE Jabbawockeez fans!!!
Great show for hip hop music/dance fans.
Hit or miss for those unfamiliar.

Get seats in the front or center aisle and you may get picked for audience participation!

My favorite part of Vegas - right here.

Sure it's nice to walk around in the daytime, but it's better in the night. Why? Because that's when everything is completely lit up! Keep those cameras handy when you're walking around here. You can even take some pictures of certain areas of the strip when you're walking on the "overhead" crosswalks. It's not just the lights to enjoy, but also some of the free shows that are available, including Mirage's Volcano and Bellagio's Dancing Water Fountains.

Be mindful of your surroundings when walking around, especially in the night. Sure it's touristy, but as what some other reviewers pointed out, there were some sketchy people hanging around (panhandlers, con artists, etc.). For this reason, I take away one star.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely be back here!

After surviving my first tornado scare in Madison, Wisconsin, my partner in crime, Daniel L. and I ventured out to this well known local BBQ hangout for some good old smoky ribs and all the fixings.

With the Midwest reputation of having some of the finest meats, it was a no brainer to order the 1/3 slab BBQ smoked ribs and pork shoulder sandwich combination dinner ($14.75). The staff mentioned the pork shoulder and the beef brisket were the top sellers besides the ribs.

The pork shoulder was pigilicious! The shredded meat was perfectly seasoned with the rub and then hickory smoked which gave its own taste without the addition of the BBQ sauce. It also impressed me because there were was no sign of grease on the pork. The bun was a standard bread bun compared to the sweet roll which accompanied the dinner combination. We took the recommendation of the staff and ordered the extra meat (additional 5 ounces for $3) since were feeling extra carnivorous! The BBQ pork ribs came with five succulent ribs with the meat just waiting to fall off the bone. Each bite had a generous coating of their famous award winning BBQ sauce. 

Our dinner combination came with two choices of side orders which we picked the baked beans and cole slaw. Both were served in a small styrofoam cups along with the BBQ sauce. It's easy to see why the BBQ sauce won numerous award because of it's rich, sweet and peppery flavor. I'm not a fan of cole slaw but this one exceed my expectations with its creaminess and was extra cold. The baked beans maintained a firm texture and should be ordered with any meal because the sauce was so addictive.

The cabin style interior holds 11 tables and is very close to the Madison airport. The actual BBQ pit is located a few miles away from the restaurant. So grab your dental floss and wet naps and eat some authentic BBQ at Smoky Jon's!

REVIEW #400.

Vegas' penultimate restaurant.  

Hailing from Michelin three star pedigree, Restaurant Guy Savoy Paris, earning two on it's own before the Guide abandoned the city, is an experience to savor.  Dishes are innovative but prepared in a classic style (no molecular gastronomy or modernist cuisine) showing classic French refinement and restraint.  The progression of courses near perfect with the memory of a flavor from the previous dish enhancing or contrasting playfully with the next.  Beautiful plating with every ingredient contributing to the dish.  The ambiance, contemporary elegant.  The service, flawless but not stuffy.  A true Michelin star experience.

Tip:  Opt for a multi course menu. 

The Innovation - Inspiration Menu ($348) is incredible.  Multiple amuses, ten innovative courses, and multiple desserts in a near perfect progression.  It features many of the signature dishes of the Paris restaurant including the incredible artichoke and black truffle soup.  Velvety smooth, rich from a touch of cream, brooding sweet vegetal flavor of artichokes perfumed by the unmistakable scent of shaved black truffle accented by shaved, aged parmesan.  A mushroom brioche spread with black truffle butter accompanies the soup.  Sensory overload.  Something more innovative?  Caviar with frozen celery root mousse.   A bite, the caviar flavor shines then a bite of the mousse, a hint of vegetal flavor then as the mousse thaws, an explosion of celery flavor that cleans the palette for the next bite.  Think drinking a frozen vodka shot.

Dishes and menus are seasonal.  Be on the lookout for the "prestige" menus.  The current black truffle prestige ($420), outstanding.  A truffle prepared in many variations that it never gets boring.  From being the featured ingredient of an acidic winter marche salad to a background note in a duck consomm, sublime.

Massive wine list with emphasis on France.  Very good vintage depth.  Very high Vegas resort pricing.  A cognac lounge features some of the rarest pours to be found including the 140 year aged Hardy Perfection and the ultra limited edition, Hennessy Ellipse.

Only pet peeve, the restaurant should prohibit the use of mobiles and the taking of photos.  There is nothing more irritating than flashes going off in the dining room as guest take photos of their plate.

A true foodie or balling out of control?  This place is for you.  Then again, if you consider a multi course menu in the Paris restaurant cost between 360 - 490 and the airfare another $6,500 ($1,000 supplement for Hawaii yeeps), you're getting 95 percent off.  What a bargain!!!

The year: 2010.
  
The episode: "Phoenix."

The Man: Adam Richman, himself.

The Challenge: Chompie's "The Ultimate Slider Challenge."

...12 Original Jewish Sliders: each one brisket-filled and gravy-drizzled, stacked as well with mini potato pancakes, Jack cheese, and onion strings.  Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.  Instead, I ordered the Combo.  And after tearing through an incredibly tasty two, alongside a cup of Matzo Ball soup, I was full.  Adam, however, he Manned-up!  Sadly, though, after a hard-fought battle, he--as many have before him--ultimately threw in the towel. The Challenge, it seemed, proved too hefty.  Food had won.

...However, if one, brave soul decides to accept this heaping challenge ($39.95) and conquers this plattered beast, it's free.  But not only that: upon winning, you will be forever immortalized on Chompie's "Hall of Fame" website (http://chompies.com/wall-of-fame/) and an "Ultimate Slider Challenge" T-shirt awaits you and your bragging self!! You bad!!  (By the way, there's no California representation on that website, zero, none, not one, nada...  Who'll step up?

This having been my first time to Chompie's, I was truly impressed!  A Yelp check-in offer allowed for a free bagel from their awesome deli/bakery; our very cool server, Trudy, brought out a few, free cookie samples for this first-timer; and our just-as-cool host made lunch suggestions, which we ordered verbatim.  As promised, those Sliders were "deli-icious."  And the Matzo Ball and Chicken soup hit the spot.  But I couldn't leave...not yet.  As full as I was, I couldn't head back to CA without first trying the carrot cake, could I?  I mean, you don't blame me, right?

So, "Man vs Food"...  That takes care of Phoenix: Alice Cooper'stown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/alice-cooperstown-phoenix?hrid=esDZwjuGZQlkpKrZAC_guQ), Los Reyes de la Torta (http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-reyes-de-la-torta-phoenix-2?hrid=nJiqRCfTtxs2bIoFrPdmkA), and now Chompie's.  On deck, LA.

So as 4 of us were waiting in line to buy tickets at 9:15pm on a Sunday, a random, friendly girl gave us three tickets and in a flash she was gone.  We were in total disbelief.  I was still skeptical up to the part where they scanned the ticket.  Saved us $111!!  I owe her some Sprinkles at the very least if we ever cross paths again.  

Currently the largest observatory wheel in the world (wonder how much of a pain it will be when it becomes the 2nd), there's not much to say about the ride itself.  You go around for 30 minutes, see the strip, snap pics and it's over.  The waiting area before getting to the actual wheel is very Disney Worldesque.  

The "guide" is a guy on a video screen dishing out facts and bad jokes (420 ft! You're really high!!).   I wonder why they didn't have different performers from Caesars shows doing video segments instead?  Imagine what the Gazillionaire and Penny would say?!  They could do the "quiet tour" with Teller.

The biggest variable with how enjoyable your ride will be are the others in your pod.  Each pod is supposed to fit 40 people.  I saw a family with 5 small and loud kids on their rollerskate sneakers in front of us and I would have done almost anything to avoid being in the same pod including lighting myself on fire.  We rode with about 20 others that were fine and excited to be on the ride.  

Other things:

- Try to go for the seats on the immediate right upon getting into the pod.
- Nighttime has to be better than daytime.  
- Please go to the restroom before getting on.

Chiploplo, Chipoodle, Chipotopolay

Looking for a pre-show meal, we saw the nearby choices of A)McDonald's, B)Panda Express or C)Chipotle.  Considering I don't like McDonald's, Panda Express is on my usual restaurant rotation & I haven't had Chipotle in a few years, the time was ripe to give Chipotle another go.

My choice - the barbacoa bowl.  

My 2 cents - It was..........how do I put this?  Boring.  Boring like the scene in "Ferris Beuller's Day Off" where Ben Stein is going "Anyone..........?  Anyone.........? Beuller........?Beuller.........?"  Boring like having a CSPAN viewing party on Valentine's Day.  Nothing says "sexytime" than Senate hearings in HD;p

Now, it wasn't bad, per se.  It's just, as I get older, I want my tastebuds to be titillated!  (I just said "titillated" *giggle*)  The portions were good.  The price was reasonable.  Also, kudos to the staff for efficiently moving the big Las Vegas line along.  Wait was minimal.  To me, I'd rather go to a local taqueria for some authentic and cheap fare, w/o the line of hipsters, Beliebers and Twi-hards.  

Chipotle is situated in a primo location to lure in the tourists.  The restaurant was clean and the staff knows how to handle the crowds coming in for sustenance, like me.  

Chipotle has it's fans, and more power to them for liking what they like.  I may return if I'm walking by, the next time I'm in Vegas.  It's convenient and the prices are reasonable, considering the dining options in the casinos.

Chocolate is the Chuck Norris of sweets. It is possibly the tastiest substance ever created by mankind. Sure, chocolate can cure hunger, but it can also be paired with any food, stop wars, and, in many cultures, is part of mating rituals. Chocolate is like sweet edible sex.

If you're still reading, you can stop now cause ... ya, I know ... "I had you at chocolate."

No sane person could turn down chocolate if offered. When my wife proposed going to Max Brenner at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace for dessert, she knew from my drool that I was no fool.

We were greeted at our table by a hyper server. Dude was clearly choco-rushin' and bouncin' off the walls. I loved his energy, but never did quite figure out what he was recommending. Does it matter? Chocolate is a synonym for "yum."

The Chocolate Fondue and Choctails were tempting (of course); however, we opted for Max's Fried Dough ($14.25). This sweet icon is one huge thin crispy plate of Fried Dough drizzled with Chocolate Chunks, Toffee, Chocolate Ice Cream, and Milk Chocolate Ganache. The animated server said there was no way the two of us could finish it ... I laughed and dove in with both hands. He knows this is chocolate, right? It's a messy and filling dessert designed for a whole family to share...or not share. (4 stars)

We also split a Chocolate Hazelnut Milkshake ($7.95) with Vanilla Ice Cream, Milk Chocolate Ganache, Chocolate Hazelnut Spread, Milk, and Whipped Cream. The shake was smooth, sweet, & superior. If Vincent in Pulp Fiction was surprised by a $5 milkshake imagine how he'd react to an $8 shake. Who needs vodka? It's got CHOCOLATE. I don't know if it's worth $8, but it's pretty f-in good! (4 stars)

Max Brenner, I don't know who you are, but I do love chocolate. So, yep, I'm a sucker ... and a fan ... cause there are only two kinds of people in this world, those who love chocolate ... and those who love chocolate, but won't admit it.

Buh, whaddaya mean you don't have chocolate cactus? ;p

Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden is a free & worthwile distraction when you want to be away from the Strip for awhile, but still close enough to head back to continue availing yourself of sinful debauchery and/or losing your entire savings account.  

The Cactus Garden greets visitors as they arrive.  When I went, I admittedly wasn't a huge cactus fan.  I dunno - maybe it's the spines, maybe it's the phallic looking Saguaro cactus.  Cactus just wasn't my cup of tea.  Ethel M has an assortment of cacti on display, which I've read are adorned with lights during the Holiday season.  My horticultural buddy, who collects cacti, has given me various fruiting cacti like the Peruvian Apple cactus, which has made me appreciate the hardy & resourceful cactus.  If I were to go back, I would look at the garden with a more loving glance.

The Chocolate Factory is a self-guided tour.  Visitors read the various displays on the voyage of a caocao bean into fancy packaging.  The highlight of course, free samples!  Halfway through the tour, visitors get their choice of sample - milk, dark or white chocolate.  I may have obtained a couple samples via a few well-timed out walkthroughs ;p  The tour ends in the chocolate shop, with the chocolates fetching a pretty hefty price.  Looking for more familiar choices?Then, on the left is.............

M&M's World!  Purveyor of all things M&M.  Lots of cute lil knickknacks for the M&M lover.  I remember seeing a chess set, which is pretty dope.  It was interesting to see all the items available to buy, but nothing that I wanted to take home.  Now, if they had M&M colored nipple stickers, then M&M's World would be in business.  I'm Asian, so they'd be milk chocolate M&M's ;p
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Overall, a cool free place to check out while you're in Vegas.

Recommend!

A cool place to check out AT NIGHT for some cheesy fun! The light show is the main attraction : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=o6mHisZZA0tj7RjX7W1ccw.
Came here to check out the ZIPLINING (Freemont Flightlines) and the light show. Tons of people- GREAT people watching. Saw some familiar faces : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=baqnWN8WDv_vdGcYDljwNg. 
My favorite group was this one: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=cvn4V62FYXTCGj7WLVx4tg
I also saw a Justin Bieber look alike here, with his mom heading out near his bedtime. You can check out a live 80's cover band, street performers, cheap eats- my favorite thing here was the time when the neon light show overhead plays "We Will Rock You" from Queen. Forgot to get my deep fried twinkie to complete my experience...

They charge for parking (what?) in the structure, so park at the nearby hotels like the CAL instead.

Clever name, a take on the sub-genre of Western films, except with a "y" at the end. Possibly to sound more "Americanized", like they did when changing the spelling of the last names when immigrants arrived through Ellis Island. The menu pays homage to the old films with sandwiches named after them, like "Hang 'Em High" and the "Magnificent Seven". 

Greeted at the door by Andrea, he immediatley started telling me all about the meats and cheeses in the deli case. A thick Italian accent, and a very enthusiastic sales pitch, we started talking about where he is from in Northern Italy, he went on to tell me all about his products in the store. The place is small, but they have a pretty extensive menu. 

 One of my favorite things in life is a charcuterie and a cheese board, complete with a glass of wine. I now have this in my neighborhood. Pretty large selection of imported Italian cheese as well as imported cold cuts like: speck, prosciutto crudo, soppressata, mortadella and your usual salami and pastrami. The cheese is what really peaked my interest, the gorgonzola was off the charts delicious. A strong bite, this is not your usual gorgonzola that we are used to. Fontina and Asiago rounded up my tasting. 

They have an assortment of pastas, some made in house, some imported from Italy (they are frozen) as well as house favorites like eggplant parm and steak milanese. Also available are some housemade desserts (try the Tiramisu, it was fantastic) as well as imported Bindi Cakes. They do have beer and wine available as well. They offer seasonal specials, like rice arancini, which I will definitely come back to try. Andrea said they do cater, and they also offer cheese/cold cut trays. 

This is a true Italian Deli, don't come in looking for a turkey sandwich and complain that they don't have it. It's not Subway. "Whattsa matta you"!

This is the busiest Walgreens I ever been to, there are good reason why.  First of is located in the Las Vegas Strip, it between Palazzo and Venetian.  Just next to the popular Tao Night Club.  This is the place to get you food, water and other important items restocked.  Eating and drinking is pricey in the Strip, you can save tons of money just shopped here, and just aware that most hotel in the strip does not had microwave or the fridge unless you got a suite type of room.

Price is slight higher than what you fight in most other Walgreen, but is understand since the high cost of the strip in general, even a foot long subway cost $10, but you still manage to find 99 cents Arizona Tea in here.   If you wanted to eat a nice buffet later of the day, this is good place to get you breakfast and late night snack fix without had to spend much.  Save those money can use more in party and gamble =)

This is the first (hopefully last) show I've ever attended where the headliner lip-synced the majority of their performance.  I knew going in that would be the case, but it still bugged the crap out of me.  There are a ton of Yelp reviews that mention it.  Almost none of them care and joyously devour her show like it's all you can eat ice cream.
  
Just being in the same (albeit very large) room as Britney Spears, wafting in her aura and celebrity is where their satisfaction is.  She could have been brushing her teeth on stage for all they cared.  My wife argued that I would go see Red Sox designated hitter David "Big Papi" Ortiz if he did a Vegas lip-sync/dance show and it's nothing different than this.  She's right.  I totally would.    

The scene was a sea of ladies dressed in club clothes, packs of gay men that knew the words to every song, Eurotrash, and significant others like myself that questioned whether the metal detectors at the entrance were for Britney's safety or to prevent a person like me from shooting/stabbing myself mid-show if she sang (ummm...performed?) a song like the inadvertent sex change anthem "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman".  The energy in the venue was palpable when you combined all that with the $45 "Work Bitch" caps, the homemade costumes worn, and people pre-gaming big by double fisting their $12 cocktails.

Of course I got a bunch of dudes a row up that refused to sit at any point during the show. Ballads, dance interludes, parts that she wasn't even in; they were all "Fuck it!  We're standing!  It's Britney, bitch!"  That meant we couldn't see anything unless we stood too!  So even when the majority of people were sitting during certain parts, I was still out of my seat which probably made me look like a really big fan of Miss Spears.  Puke.  I actually shelled dough out for this show so I'd be damned if I were to miss a wardrobe malfunction.  

Songs were....stage was...dancers were....screw that!  Go read other reviews for that stuff.   I didn't cross this show off my bucket list, I crossed it off my fuckit list.

Good food, okay service.

If you're looking for good authentic Asian food in the Venetian in Vegas, this is your place.  However, like many of the very authentic Asian restaurants, the service was completely lacking.  Our waitress visited our table only twice, once to take our order and the second time to bring the bill.  Otherwise a server brought our food, and no stopped by again to ask if we needed anything else. 

I tired to send back a plate because it wasn't what I wanted, and the hostess essentially told me "no", because they'd through the food away and it'd be wasted... so I just kept it and ate, but after a few more bites it wasn't all that bad after all  :-)

I guess what they lack in service they make up for in the food.

My quest for the ultimate donut in Vegas continues. This time I visited the Donut Hut, another highly regarded establishment in the Yelp community. Will this take the throne of Ronald's? We shall see.

A small shop located on the east side of Vegas, it's on Desert Inn and Mojave, between Pecos-Mcleod and the 515. I've never actually driven on this road before. It's so old school, it's like driving through a time warp! The hours are great, Tues-Sun 7:30 pm to 1 pm; it's great for late night snacks, and morning breakfast (I think the guy changes the hours regularly, so, don't hold me to those hours)

The donuts here are more of your traditional variety. I decided to pick up three to go.

- Apple Fritter : It was crisp, and soft in the middle. It doesn't have as much apple flavor as the one at Ronald's. Plus, the one at Donut Hut is smaller than the one at Ronald's. But otherwise, it was very tasty.

Glazed donut - well made glazed donut. Soft, but not doughy. Not too sweet, which is good. 

Cruller - first time trying a cruller. Choux dough shaped in a fluted ring, then fried. Light and airy, not too sweet. It was solid.

I paid 3.85 for all three, and I got a really good value for what I paid. Does this beat out Ronald's? No. It is a great option for those living out east, or those who want a late night donut.

BTW, when you enter the store, you will see pictures of policemen all over the wall. The owner told me why.. policemen are the best judges of a good donut. LMAO

How can anyone complain about the ONLY service I'm aware of here in Vegas that will deliver food to you, while you dictate from your living room dressed in nothing but panties?

Really? I'm sorry y'all. I'm not following you here! You have a better solution, let me know. For now, all of my bets and money are with Road Runner Food on this one... For their excellent service and price for what they offer, I am truly a fan.

If it wasn't for them, I would have never gotten my ROTD on Yelp for reviewing Amore Taste of Chicago Pizza. Roadrunner was singlehandedly responsible for introducing me to this amazing restaurant. I always give credit where credit is due, and it is is definitely due here. All of this transpired from the comfort of my own home, while surfing the net in my panties. And yes, I'm gladly putting my own name and rep on the line by telling you that Roadrunner really rocks! I cannot stress this enough!

Sure, I have to put clothes on to answer the door but who cares? I still got to order in my panties and I relish in that fact! And to think that I just killed every guy's fantasy about delivering the "extra large sausage pizza" to my house in those last few sentences. Haha! I'm sorry.

Special thanks to Vicki for handling my order and making my day. This girl definitely deserves a raise! *a little hint hint nudge nudge for the higher ups that may be reading this*

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 43/100

Pretty decent hotel. The only time I've ever stayed here was when I was a child so I don't remember too much of it. 

LOCATION: 
More towards the south end of the strip, across the street from New York New York.

EXTERIOR:
Look for the big green building with the big lion in the front. The entryway/lobby/drop off/pick up area is actually not located directly on the strip, but rather around the corner along the cross street that runs perpendicular to the strip.

INTERIOR:
HUGE HUGE HUGE lobby. Much larger than a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's pretty nice! They also have a pretty decent sized casino as well, and the theater where they host the KA Cirque du Soleil show is surprisingly ginormous. I was so surprised that that size of a theater was inside this hotel. 

SHOPPING:
Unfortunately, the shops at this hotel are pretty crappy. Nothing interesting except for a bunch of souvenir shops, and places where you can get everything bad for you - alcohol and sweets.

I feel like MGM used to be good, but with the addition of all of the newer hotels on the strip, it's losing its game. So unfortunate since MGM owns so many of the hotels on the strip!

I have a dark and shameful past...Yelp is probably that best place for me to let it all out and begin the healing:)

Before I became the humble software marketing genius that I am today, I was a suit...a corporate stooge...I wasn't workin' for the man...in most cases, I was the man:)

During that time of my life, I picked up some very unsavory habits...including one of the most unsavory habits ever visited on self-important executives...fountain pens:)

God help, me...I still love them so:)

I still have every one of them and I still use them with regularity (I know, I make my living with the keyboard...more or less...but when I write for pleasure, it's usually on a fine Rhodia #19 graph pad, with one of my 73 lovely "writing instruments":)

There is something both soothing and exciting about the flow of ink on fine paper...sometimes, it's the only way to get a really coherent sentence together:)

Some of my pens, I can refill from my inkwell, but many require cartridges...cartridges that they don't always sell at Staples or Office Depot...

That's when I set off for the far reaches of Old Town Scottsdale and swing by Scottsdale Pen Company...home of all things pen:)

It's like a head shop, but for a different kind of addiction:)

What a gorgeous and glorious selection of truly marvelous writing instruments, writing instrument related paraphernalia and objet d'art:-)

They have the cousins to my Mont Blanc's, the younger brothers and sisters of my beautiful Parkers and Waterman's and Sheaffer's...they even have the utilitarian antecedents of my everyday Lamy's and Rotring's:)

They have beautiful new Acme's, Pelikan's and Pilot's and mechanical pencils, like my Faber-Castell Fat Boy:)

Oh, and the paper...lovely leather bound journals and tablets, beautiful Rhodia tablets from France...I get goosebumps! :-)

Finally, they have ink...lots and lots of ink...in cartridges, in bottles...and I need ink!

They had cartridges for my Cross and my Rotring, when I thought I was going to have to go to Colorado Pen or something...so glad I didn't have to go that route:)

It was definite "win" for me...I get to support a wonderful local business...I got to "use" a bunch of new pens (try that at Pink's)... and I got a whole new place to hang out and indulge my pen fantasies...at least until they get the restraining order:-)

At the very last minute before driving to Lost Wages, I booked a single room at the Microtel Inn & Suites ($70 on Orbitz).  Having never heard of the chain, I pretty much felt I was rolling the dice with this one.  But since no true tourist in Lost Wages ever spends more than a few hours in the room, I figured, what the hell?  It can't be any dingier than my last stay at Excaliber.

Well, this joint (obviously new or newly remodeled) is light years ahead of the MGM, Excaliber, and even the Mirage in cleanliness and the bed and pillows are waaaay more comfortable.  Rooms are modest, but decor and amenities are up-to-date and modern.  Amenities range from flat screen Vizios, microwaves and even a mini fridge to store your booze in to drink before hitting the casinos.  They even do free breakfast until 9:30am!

However, the BEST part about this hotel is that it's 100% NON SMOKING, so you don't get that nasty smoke stench that (despite Febreeze) seeps into the walls, carpet and draperies over time (*ahem MGM!).  It's also a few miles just south of the main strip off of Las Vegas Blvd with simple, no hassle parking right in front.  This makes it super mellow for getting in and out.

Overall, I highly recommend this place if you 1) want to save on cash, 2) don't mind staying outside the strip, and 3) want a non-smoking, super mellow place to get in and out of during your weekend of ephemeral debauchery.

Note:  No King beds.  They only do Queen Sized.  Check out is at 12pm (not 11am like most hotels on the strip)!

I was in the unfortunate circumstance this past weekend of having to wake up at 630am to drive and pick up my Bountiful Basket from Ahwatukee. To help offset the sleep, I decided to grab an iced coffee from the king of coffee, Dunkin Donuts.

As I walked back to my filthy, dusty car, I got the overwhelming desire to wash it. Now, folks, on the rare occasions when I want nothing more than to clean my car or house, I try to monopolize on the opportunity, so I drove around to three different car washes in an attempt to get my baby cleaned... but as luck would have it, not one god damned place was open.

Just when my will to live was seconds away from being squashed, I suddenly remembered that there was a Groupon special a week ago for Clean Freak, and I felt like it was a moment of Nachos (see Dallas G.) so I decided to see if the Nachos Gods were on my side this day.

Well guess what, Clean Freak was open! And I was excited because that big blue tunnel was just fascinating! And what is this? $10 for the most pricey wash that cleans my tires too?? AND air freshener?? SCORE!!! And to boot, the cashier dude was in holiday spirit wearing his Halloween costume!

Now, here comes this crappy part... the wash really wasn't that good. My windows weren't clean and there was still grime all over my tires. I had to buy window cleaner. None of the dead bugs came off my grill, either.

Oh.... and the vacuum's... I honestly believe that they could have sucked an unborn child from my womb had I been carrying one. But instead it got one of the many pieces of my stereo console. I'm sure that is going to cost me good money to replace. Thanks.

Next time I have to make such an effort to get my car washed, I will just live like a filthy slob until I can find time to make it over to Danny's Family. It may cost $25 but at least my car is clean and I don't have to worry about losing my uterus.

LOVE The Barrymore!! What a hidden gem and one of the best meals I have ever had in Vegas! I've been to many upscale restaurants opened by celebrity chefs, but this honestly blows many of them away. Located inside the Royal Resort behind Encore, you'd never expect to find such a fabulous restaurant here. The interior is Mad Men-esque with chic retro decor and a really swanky ambiance.

Food and cocktails were phenomenal and the service was unpretentious and top notch. Everyone was super friendly and we even had the pleasure of meeting their amazing chef de cuisine Francisco Campa.

The seared foie gras was to die for! My friend and I shared one order, but considered ordering another because it was just that delicious. We also enjoyed their decadent lobster mac n cheese, and the fish and duck specials of the night were amazing. Be sure to ask for recommendations and hear about their specials. For cocktails, I really loved the Virginia Hill (Pisco, Lillet Blanc, peach syrup, fresh lemon juice, egg whites, 
peach bitters, sage). You really can't go wrong with anything though.
Book a table here and thank me later!

I drank the punch, now after five visits, I'm either have an addiction or I'm a fan.

From the city that invented a Fre Kin Gud sushi roll and yum yum sauce springs Yonaka Modern.  The food is playful.  A fusion of Japanese / Peruvian / Argentinian cuisine popularized by Nobu Matsuhisa.  From the flavors to the presentation, this is the poor man's Matsuhisa (Beverly Hills, LA).  Oh yeah, it's good!

Dishes deliver a punch.  No monochromatic plates here.  Bold flavors that try to push the boundaries of sweet, sour, bitter in a single dish.  Excellent use of texture.  It is not uncommon to have a deep fried leaf sitting atop a piece of delicate fish.

Order an assortment of small plates and share.  

I won't ruin the "joy of discovery", besides the menu changes as specials come and go.  One day, teriyaki foie nigiri topped with candied quinoa, live uni another,   The menu staple, deep fried Brussels sprouts with lemon, chili, mint, and puffed rice is amazing.  It looks a mess but as a dish, it's comforting. Vegetal, sweet, sour, bitter; the perfect match to beer.  Ingredients are fresh and seasonal.

All nigiri sushi comes with a twist.  A sauce of this, an unusual garnish of that (hamachi with a spicy jalapeo miso and a cilantro leaf; unagi with togarashi and a leaf of Thai basil).  The rice is good and the fish fresh. Go crazy, order one of each.

Service is very good; friendly and attentive.  Prices are very reasonable.  Two happy hours (17:00-18:30 / 23:00-02:00) make it even more inviting.

One of the best in Vegas on or off the Strip.

I used to think this venue was named for the dress size of girls in minidresses who lined up to get their butt cheeks stamped in exchange for free admission.  But, after making my way here last Monday, I'm guessing the name stands for Excess.

Because they spared no expense, friends.  This place is huge, the vibe is sexy, and the people are as beautiful as money can buy.  Especially on a Monday in Las Vegas.  It's industry night, so expect to shake it harder for free perks.  

We arrived shortly before Midnight and paid a cover charge ($20 for me; $30 for him).  Then, on a hunch, I dropped my name to a dude with a clipboard, he checked the guestlist (sign up free on the Wynn's website to be contacted soon by a promoter: http://www.encorelasvegas.com/#/nightlife/xs_reservations/) and then REIMBURSED us for the cover charges.  That's right, they said, "you shouldn't have to pay" and actually put $50 BACK on our card... which paid for a few vodka sodas for yours truly.

A cute gal wandered around with tequila and vodka-guava shooters.  Might want to ask how much they are in advance, since $12 a pop adds up when you offer to buy a round for your friends.

Fun Tip: Find the Las Vegas Weekly photographer on premises and get yourself featured in the online photo album here: http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/photos/2010/jan/26/128774/

We danced until 3am to hip hop mash-ups and had a blast.  Warm vibe from everyone on the indoor/outdoor dance floor - which helps when you fall on your face from 4.5" heels that weren't intended to be walked in and need strangers to pull a Humpty Dumpty and get you upright again.  Hypothetically.

Five divinely XSessive stars.

One of the great things about living in the southwest, is how all the food traditions have followed us here. 

Want a Philly Cheesesteak? Forgetaboutit!  New Yawk deli? We've got dat too!  A Chicago dog? Abs-so-freakin-lootely! LOL  How about that Aaron Rogers and George Wendt commercial?  Grill Class, I love it!  

It seems Chicago style, Vienna Beef places are all over greater Phoenix. What you don't see too often, are these family owned places. In Chicago you have Mom and Pop places all over. Each one trying to create their own piece of heaven for their loyal customers. 

Well I believe Dazzo's is one of those places too. You come in, you are greeted by one of the Dazzo family members. Warmly! None of that phony baloney stuff. Just, "thanks for coming in!  First time here?  Where are you from?"  They also have family pictures all over the wall, going back to when they first opened. Nice! 

And if UR interested, they also have a nice collection Chicago team Sun Times clippings, mostly of the Bulls and Cubs stuff. 

Okay, this is all great Georgie, but what makes it so special?  Well, the food!  Grilled Jumbo Dogs, Red Hots, Fire Dogs, Brats, Italian Beef -- they have them all and they're cooked fresh, just for you. Delicious!

Another plus are their French fries. They're exquisite and topped with a nice mixture of seasoning salt. I'm not a big fries guy, but I might come back for some more of them. 

But when I do come back, I'll bring more Cash because they don't accept Plastic. 

Enjoy!

Fantastic fries ..., but the Farm Burger was flavorless & dry. It should be renamed the Farm BoreGR. The famous Farm was totally not worth our 30-minute wait in line.

Luckily, a Hell's Kitchen Burger was much better ... thanks to add-ons of Duck Breast Bacon and a Fried Egg (both of which are on the Farm BoreGR) which complimented the Hell's Kitchen Jalapeo, Tomato, and Avocado.

Truffle Parmesan Fries (Lunch $10) 
... featured large Potato Cuts that were exhilarating without the normal oiliness of French Fries. The flavor blend of Truffle Parmesan, Truffle Salt, and Truffle Aioli was Truffletastic. Of course, at $10 you'd hope these were better than your normal burger joint fries ... and they were. (4 stars) 

Hell's Kitchen Burger (Lunch $13) 
... is one of the popular burger choices with Asadero Cheese, Roasted Jalapeno Peppers, Avocado, and Roasted Tomatoes. It would of been 3 stars except we added, for a few $ extra, Bacon and a Fried Egg. (4 stars with add-ons)

Farm Burger (Lunch $14) 
... was probably the most hyped burger on Yelp; however, despite the goodness of Bacon and ooze of a Fried Egg, this was a dry blah disappointment. Olivia wanted to return it, so, I gave her half of my HK Burger. If you get the Farm BoreGR add Avocado and Jalapeno Peppers to add any flavor. (2 stars)

Batch 19 Beer ($7)
... Bold and hoppy like Gordon Ramsay himself, this Coors-brewed Pre-Prohibition Style Lager helped take the edge off. If I go back to Gordon Ramsay ... and there is no line ... then I might just plop down in front of one of the TVs and relax with an order of the Fries and this brew.

With a slow wait and overpriced BoreGRs, the cool factor for Gordon Ramsay BurGR isn't enough to elevate this burger joint among the elite food destinations in Las Vegas.

Who you callin a Byatch! Bow down for your master! 

I read my first reviews of Bachi a while back and bookmarked it away for a Vegas trip.

Thanks Dave G. and Craig R for enlightening me to the way of the Bachi Burger. My journey is now only 1/2 complete as this young grasshopper is ready to fly, again the voices of Dave & Craig come creeping into my mind. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=TECziqmB2XZ4E5psSvvKJw#TECziqmB2XZ4E5psSvvKJw

You must first journey to the East. Search for the Windmill and the Bermuda, the masters told me and you will find the truth.

The masters again spoke to me. " Put up the ragtop or your rent a car will get stolen dummy"  https://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/photo/1PZEIhmTjSzNrMhMfWU6IQ/l.jpg

Finally this journey must come to an end or is it a new beginning?

TASTE:  HELL YEA!
Kiki's Burger ... one hell of a bad boy, a large burger sportin an eartty mushroom taste like an ugly redheaded stepchild at an Irish fair. This was one great burger! A true 5*****Star 

Oxtail Chili Fries ... I've had oxtail spaghetti ragu, soup, pho and even a Jamacian oxtail jerk, but never had it as a chili base before. Its marrow/ gelatin rich flavor is an awesome boot in the pants to an otherwise plain beef chile. I reccomend this for anyone going to Vegas.. It kicks tail!

My masters are calling me back to Anaheim. http://www.yelp.com/biz_user_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA/upload?upload_finished=1&successful%5B%5D=JqImqMytH8fVTrxRkv14mg

SERVICE:   here is off the hook, you know they got a good thing going and make sure you do too. Clean, polite and willing to help you find the right food for your taste.

I'll be back to try so many things that my stomach would not let me this time.

I over heard that one is opening in LA sometime soon, Bachi Burgers, On Sawtelle in W. LA., Sign me up masters!

We used these guys to cater street tacos for our daughter's 1yo birthday party.
If you have an upcoming event and need awesome food and great service at a great price, use Taqueria Guadalajara.  These are legit street tacos.
   Hector was my contact person, and he was very accomodating and professional. We ended up increasing the guest list significantly near the party, and it was no problem. 4 types of meat are included - went with carne asada, chicken, chorizo, and al pastor (pork). All four were good, but the consensus was that the al pastor was the best. 
   David came out to our house and set up about an hour before food was to be served. He started grilling, and set out the vegetable bar, which was huge. There were pickled onions, carrots/jalapeno, some sort of slaw, lettuce, pico de gallo, onions, and green and red salsas. David was extremely courteous, and stayed to serve until the last person was done eating - in 100 degree heat outside. Cleanup was great, you wouldn't even know they were there. 
  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because David did leave a "Tips" box out on the table. My feeling is that at a catered party, it is the host's responsibility to tip for good service. Expecting the guests to tip is a little awkward. Just my opinion, but not a huge deal. 
Would use them again in a heartbeat, as will many of my guests.

***update***
Our original posting was deleted by Yelp. Now this posting went from being "recommended" to currently hidden at the bottom of the "not recommended" reviews... So far, 21 users thought it was useful. Why are you hiding my review, Yelp? Could it be because I gave a NEGATIVE review based on my OWN experience? So much for being able to trust your site for unbiased reviews.
*********

Our previous review was deleted by Yelp for "violating their guidelines" so I'll post another review that only relates to our personal experience with their boarding facility.

We used Green Acre Boarding in Oct of 2013 for a 3 night stay. This place was presented as a great place for dogs... Free roam and lots of kids to play with your pups.  

This seemed like a great scenario for our 1yr old golden but our 11 year old sheltie just needed a safe place to stay. When I dropped our dogs off, I told MaLeisa that our sheltie didn't enjoy playing with other dogs (she would run away from her own loving, gentle, golden retriever brother at home) and that she just needed a quiet place to rest & observe during her stay. I was assured by MaLeisa they could accommodate that and that she would be fine.

Upon picking up our dogs we were told by MaLeisa that our sheltie "was playing in the yard with another dog and having a great time and next thing she knew, Todd was carrying her in because she had blood on her." Our dog had blood oozing from her ear, cuts across her face, was dry heaving and could barely walk. (And, "they had already washed her.") Our Sheltie collapsed in exhaustion once we got her into our vehicle. Unfortunately, our sweet girl had to be put down the following week as she never fully recovered from her injuries. 

Green Acres makes you sign a contract saying your dog will be dehydrated and exhausted upon returning home but that these are all normal results of a boarding experience. Add to that your dog will reek (which was explained away as being from the flood irrigation they use.) 

We had already pre-booked another stay at Green Acre for later in the month but obviously cancelled that stay after the injuries to our sheltie. I'm sickened and sad that I ever entrusted my dogs to the care of Green Acre.

I stopped by here for lunch and tried out their lunch special, 2 slices of cheese and a 20 ounce bottled soda for $5.95 including tax. There were 3 employees inside when I walked in who all greeted me and were very nice. They have tables inside and a TV. I sat at a table while my food was being prepared and it wasn't long before it was ready. I also asked for a "Cannoli" priced at $3.25 to be packed to-go and it was made fresh to order. The pizza was just so-so to me. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. The price was certainly right! The Cannoli was actually very good and one of the best I have had. Those alone are worth stopping by for.

They offer delivery to a wide range of the valley.

One of the most intimate and unique dining experiences you will ever experience in Sin City!

Having tried most of the fine dining restaurants in Vegas, I thought i'd seen it all til i was pleasantly surprised with a shiny golden ticket in the mail!

When that fateful evening arrived on Saturday October 13th, I was like Charlie waiting in eager anticipation to finally visit Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.  Truth be told, I wasn't quite sure what was in store for me but i had a feeling it would be something good! 

In fact, as soon as we stepped into Jaleo, we were cordially seated at the bar and kindly given the drink menu for the evening on a handy iPad! Since I was feeling celebratory, i decided on the wine pairing with my meal and  as soon as our server found out it was my birthday, he gave us a glass of cava on the house! Now that's service IMO! 

After that, we were escorted to a dimly lit and intimate private room with a semicircular bar surrounded by wooden card catalogs housing Jose Andre's eclectic tchotchkes, which he apparently collected from his travels around the world.  At this time, the chef introduced himself and proceeded with a brief explanation of the evening's events.  Without a moment to spare, the chef and his skilled staff worked feverishly on the first dish. Liquid nitrogen began to billow over the counter and within moments, we were presented with beautiful bite size pieces of food art. About 20 or more dishes followed in succession, each skillfully crafted to engage and amaze!

I must admit, I arrived with high expectations, but the chef and staff at  definitely did not disappoint. It was a truly unforgettable experience that was filled with intrigue and spectacle. An intimate showcase inspired by traditional Spanish dishes, masterfully executed by the talented chef and staff.  is bar none one of the most interesting and enjoyable dining experiences I've ever had in Vegas! With that said, it's an experience you should make when visiting the city because like magic, it could soon disappear!

Happy Eats!

Hated it.
Yes, it was cheap. Yes, it's centrally located. Yes, it's disgusting.

A couple of friends and I went for a turn around trip to Vegas for the night. We knew we weren't going to spend that much time in the room because we were there to eat and play some tables. Who knew that we weren't going to spend that much time in the room because we didn't want to be in it? Granted, yes- it was off season and we only spent $15 for the room- but I wish I would have spent $15 more to stay at one of the nicer hotels. We were being cheap, and we paid for it.

I knew it was an older hotel, but come on... a little updating (and cleaning) wouldn't hurt, would it? Being on the main strip next to all of these other nicer hotels, you would think they would try to up their amenities a little. At least run a steam cleaner over the effing carpets.

It took forever to find the check-in from the garage. There was a place that looked like a front desk, but wasn't really a front desk? A maintenance person had to tell us where to go. Check-in was fun, too. The lady pulled out a map that looked like something from an Indiana Jones adventure and proceeded to draw our route to the room. We were really confused when we had to exit the hotel to get to our room. WTF. There was a separate section that resembled a Motel 6 from the 70's. That's where our room was.

Upon opening the door, we were greeted by more dilapidated furniture, stale air and heavily stained carpet. Either someone had a crazy orgy in here before us- or there was a homicide. Needless to say- I waited until I got home to shower and I refused to take off my shoes.

Yes, it's cheap. But spring a little more for a nicer room regardless if you're just there to party. I'd hate to wake up face down on that carpet.

Chef Daniel Boulud's triumphant return to Vegas.  This incarnation, a modern brasserie using the freshest, locally sourced, seasonal ingredients in updated, French classic dishes.  Intriguing elements in every dish brighten flavors and awaken the palate.  Add some beautifully imagined French craft cocktails; this is not your typical austere brasserie.

The requisite classics are there; a well made pate de champagne bourguignon with bits of this and that served with house made cornichons and whole grain mustard with bread, the authenticity of which is rarely tasted outside of Europe.  The obligatory shellfish plateau; a mountain of fresh seafood, begging for a glass of Sancerre.  The austere coq au vin, with it's perfectly braised pieces of chicken amidst lardoons, mushrooms and pearl onions.  All good but pale in comparison to dishes showcasing the chef's Michelin pedigree.

The artichoke veloute is incredible.  Velvety smooth.  Huge vegetal flavor of artichokes balanced with cream around a mushroom royale.  Bits of mushrooms provide texture.  A submerged "crouton" soaked in butter adds even greater richness.  Pair the dish with the "Bee's Knees" and be blown away by the complexity created by the sweetness, acidity, and richness.  The salmon rillettes, all the flavor of salmon, made smooth, rich, and creamy.  Hints of fennel add a wonderful anise notes, fried capers add texture and briny salinity.  Finally the dry aged Brandt ribeye.  Simply grilled served with a barnaise sauce, more acidic and with herbaceous notes than most that heightens the nutty, bleu cheese flavor of the steak.

Tip:  Lunch is a deal.  $26 for two courses, $33 for three.

Tip:  Match a craft cocktails with each dishes.  Cocktails are extremely complex with the use of many different bitters.  Most have great acidity.  Dare I say, perfect pairings work better than wine.

Very good wine list.  Heavy emphasis on France.  Decent vintage depth.   Best "value" in older vintages.  

Contemporary, bright ambiance.  Excellent, relaxed service.  You would never know the restaurant has been opened for only a month.

Definitely a welcome addition to the Vegas culinary scene.

I used to love coming to Hancock for fabric, but stopped because the selection changed and I couldn't find any fabric that I liked unless I had it special ordered. I stopped in today to check out their fabrics to see if they had any neat holiday patterns or kits and also I needed to pick up some craft glue to finish up some Christmas gifts I'm making. When I walked in there was 2 older woman and they saw me yet didn't greet me or even say hello. After looking around a bit at the fabric and seeing that it all looked dated, I walked up to another lady I noticed and asked her if they sold craft glue and she directed me to it and asked if I needed any help finding anything else. Hancock is smaller than Hobby Lobby or Michael's, so the selection and brands are limited. The craft glue was actually the same price as it would be at the other mentioned stores, but I also could have used a 40 percent off coupon at those other said places, making the craft glue more expensive here if I were to come here to get it each time unless Hancock offered the same coupon that could be used daily and that I could just pull up on my phone like I can at the other places. I did sign up for some sort of rewards card, so if they send deals worthy enough, I'll stop by no problem. The fabric today was on sale 40-50 percent and that's good, but the selection was terrible. The quality of the fabric at Walmart (if you can even find it anymore because they have taken a lot of their fabric isles down) is very poor, so it's nice to have a place like Hancock that has good quality fabric, but it has to be on sale to be worth it and they need more patterns that aren't so dated. I can see stopping by here in a pinch, but will stick to getting my regular crafting supplies at Hobby Lobby and Michael's where the selection and deals are better.

What a spiritual, uplifting Catholic Community!

From the opening notes of the hymn, "All are welcome in this place", I knew how special Saint Patrick's was to me.

"Let us build a house
where love can dwell
And all can safely live,
A place where
saints and children tell
How hearts learn to forgive."

There are so many things I want to share about coming here for 5 pm Mass. First is coming into their sacred space and hearing a first class Choir and musicians practicing . Their group also includes a pianist, a person on Keyboard and a very young College age drummer.  They were great, and not just for the practice, but throughout the service. They all worked well together and didn't overwhelm the senses. The music of Paul Hillebrand and the heavenly voice of their Cantor Jill Bagshaw are incredible and needs to be experienced to be appreciated.  

"Let us build a house where prophets speak,
And words are strong and true,
Where all God's children dare to seek
To dream God's reign anew."

Second is the friendly parishioners who sat around me, including some long time friends. Even though Father Eric was away on vacation, the folk at Saint Patrick's didn't seem to miss a beat. Their ministry to the poor of spirit here in the valley is well known, particularly their efforts at Justa Center.  But it's also the nearly four dozen other ministries, where they offering themselves as the hands and body of Christ, which makes you realize how special this community is.

"Let us build a house where love is found
In water, wine and wheat:
A banquet hall on holy ground,
Where peace and justice meet."

I've come to Mass here many times and the Liturgy is wonderful. I have never felt this way in any other Catholic Church.  It is so moving, to stand up and have the entire church hold hands for The Lord's Prayer, and I do mean everyone. It's special and I only wish I could convey how moving it is to feel the spirit in this church when it happens. It's just amazing to have over five hundred members standing, holding hands and reciting not a prayer by rote, but with feeling and love that makes it so special. 

"Here the love of God, through Jesus,
Is revealed in time and space;
As we share in Christ the feast that frees us:

All are welcome, all are welcome,
All are welcome in this place."

5 Stars for the intimate Study Bar Alone... the best craft cocktails in Vegas!...yes that's a bold statement...Still, the rest of RRL is on point as well!

rose. rabbit. lie. is the latest happening at The Cosmopolitan.

It is billed as a "rebirth of the social club" and a "grand social experiment."  so, there you go...I'm sure that explains it perfectly.  Essentially what they have done is broken down the walls (some of them anyway) between typically separate venues like a restaurant, club, cocktail bar, and a live entertainment theater and brought them together in one spot.  The club doesn't start until after the last show, the restaurant is semipermeably divided from the entertainment, but the interplay creates a unique experience for sure.  There are several bars in the space as well--including one sensational place for quintessential cocktails...The Study...

The Study...  This niche bar is a small secluded treasure inside of rose. rabbit. lie.  They offer well-crafted, often boozy, but always balanced cocktails.  The Study serves up many classically inspired drinks as well as offering several modern variations.  The staff is staff here is elite and will work off the menu to delightful results as well.  The drinks start around $16 and are worth the price.

Nocturne is the show at RRL.  It is a whimsical interplay of circus acts...wait...or is it side show acts?...you'll have to find your way into the Cloak Room to know for show.  The shows are different at each time slot, but similar in concept.  I found the 8pm & 10pm shows to playfully fun and amusingly cheesy.  The individual acts range from tap dancers to contortionist; tight wire to burlesque; balance acts to aerial ropes.  In the same way that Coldplay is Radiohead Light, Nocturne is Absinthe Light.  Great in it's own right, but falling short to purists of the original.

Disinterested servers with their noses held high.
The Sommelier had a stick shoved so high up his butt he could barely make sense. Insisting we could not bring in a bottle of wine if it was on the wine list. We told him that we had already checked and it was not on their wine list.  He checked (more than once) and couldn't find it on the list. He finally gave in.  The bottle of Lodi Gluttony 2006 Old Vine Zinfandel was the bottle we brought for this occasion. We had every intention of ordering a second bottle from their list. But as it turns out we didn't want to spend any more time at Bouchon than we needed to. It was NOT the way to start a Birthday dinner.... Or any dinner for that matter.     
The Food   
The scallops were amazing according to my Grandson 
The sausage (Boudin Blac) ordered by my Grandaughter, didn't seem to impress her
Son-In-laws salad nicoise was not what he expected. Seems it was more of a tuna salad on lettuce. But he said it tasted good 
The Roasted Leg of Lamb was not memorable -literally 
The beautifully presented Pork chop Delmonico was tasty, but way to tough to chew.
The best thing was Son-in-laws first course of a micro greens that seem to have a light sprinkling of a Nutty Gremolata and topped with deep fried calamari rings. I'm having a hard time getting that salad out of my mind. I'll have to try my hand at making it, because I won't be back to Bouchon.
Snobbery makes good food taste bad. 

Sheesh, I can't believe I put on high heels for this.

The four of us came here for lunch and had a great time.

Spinato's has a nice ambiance as you enter and you will notice a great many Chicago posters, such as Illinois Central, Chicago Worlds Fair and B&W photos of the bridges crossing the Chicago River. Nice!

The food is equally good. The four of us each ordered different pizzas but really enjoyed the flavor.  This not your classic Chicago deep dish place, so you might be surprised by the thin crust cut into squares.  We really enjoyed it, and reminded us of the Edwardo's chain.  http://www.edwardos.com/

The pizza also has that sweet tomato sauce they served in St. Louis.  My friend Marvin A. is right, "it's over the top" sweet.  And it will surprise you when you first try it, but it works well.  In St Louis, they use Provel cheese which has a more buttery and creamy taste.  But here the manager Tim assures me they use mozzarella.  Still, it was very good.  

We enjoyed Spinato's and will be back.

Enjoy!

I've always had mixed feelings about the Cheesecake Factory.

I am not much of a cheesecake aficionado, and they have always struck me as an icon of american food excess.  The few times we've eaten in one, we have always left with a bagful of leftovers capable of feeding a third world family for a week.  A slight exaggeration, but not by much I believe.

On the positive side, Cheesecake Factory makes some really interesting and tasty dishes.  I have also found that I have become susceptible to subliminal messages while watching Sheldon and Leonard discuss their BBQ Burger on Big Bang Theory. LOL

So here I was shopping at the Mall and wondering about lunch, when I walked passed Cheesecake Factory and thought of Sheldon and Leonard's discourse.  See link: http://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/series-1-episode-5-the-hamburger-postulate/

So instead of their preferred BBQ Burger, I went with the Classic Burger for $10.50 (see photos). Wow it was huge (maybe a 1/2 lb.) and very, very good. 

A couple months back we were in LVS and had an enjoyable dinner at Gordon Ramsey's "BurGR". This burger is a close second to that carnivorous experience. I'll say it again, wow. 

Cheesecake's Classic Burger is grilled on an open flame and it picks up all that smokey taste from the grill. A nice touch was the sliced grilled red onion which is served on top. 

In summary, an absolutely Four Star Plus experience; and yes I am a Fan. Maybe next time I'll try Sheldon's BBQ Burger. Hmm, I just realized my review feels more like a Chuck Lorre vanity card. LOL

Enjoy!

I love Public House this was my second time here. The restaurant is located in the Venetian hotel. Let's keep this simple. 
Food we ordered all appetizer.
Poutine with duck confit and Stout gravy was delish,but it wasn't the best. Make sure to add  a fried egg to it. 
Lamb Meatballs was awesome. The tomato sugo,and the herb bread crumbs was on point. The lamb meatballs was cook perfectly. Highly recommend.
Steak Tartare. This for me was my favorite dish. The tenderloin was super tender. The capers beer mustard dressing was wonderful. What made the dish even more was the perfectly poached egg. That made the dish rich and creamy. Get this dish with the poached egg extra ($2.50).
Southern Fried Quail was fantastic. The quail fried perfectly crispy layer and very moist in the inside. Had a lot of great flavor going on.
And lastly The Foie Gras Torchon. This one I was a little disappointment with. So past on it. 
As for the drinks Huge selection of wonderful craft beers. 
The service was great and helpful. You'll see me around public house again.

This was my first time in Terminal 3 since I was flying Virgin America to LA and I do have to say that it's pretty awesome because it's new, modern, open, and spacious. Checking in is a breeze if you must do so. All the airlines are all lined up with awesome LED screens indicating each airline's specific counter. 

The security now has two separate lines - one for regular screens and individuals who have TSA Pre-Check. The TSA Pre-Check line moved pretty quickly even if it looks pretty long. Just remember folks, put all your stuff in your bag and don't have any metal like belts, coin change, etc. on your or in your pockets. It'll make the line move much more quickly!

After getting through security, there are plenty of screen to inform you of you arriving and departing flights. The terminal is pretty big with huge windows that let in plenty of light. In true Vegas style, there are slot machines around every corner in case you have extra time before your flight.

There are plenty of food options such as Pei Wei, Burger King, Carl's Jr., and Coffee Bean. I think there are a couple more options, but I noticed these just from looking for food. They also had your basic stores in case you wanted some snacks, reading material, Las Vegas memorabilia, etc. The bathrooms are also modern and clean, which is always a plus.

The terminal is very accommodating to tech savvy folks. There is free wi-fi for your use and there's also a dedicated charging station. It would've been better if there were chargers are each seat, but that's just me being picky.

If I have to fly to Las Vegas again, going through Terminal 3 would be awesome. It has everything I need to literally make the time fly! You will not be disappointed!

Who would have thought I'd find myself downtown at a rundown casino like Palace Station, but there I was on a late Sunday night enjoying one of the most satisfying dishes sin city had to offer! 

Yup, I'm talkin about the Pan Roast at Oyster Bar! 

Do yourself a huge favor and order the palace version with shrimp chicken andouille sausage and crab. I added lobster too. But either way, It's the bomb, cuz its all about that crazy good sauce! Keep in mind however, to truly enjoy this dish, you've gotta love your spice! Trust, each bite will be a scorching spoonful of fiery goodness! Chunks of meaty sausage, chicken and seafood in every bite and I bet you won't be able to put your spoon down! Well, except to wipe your forehead from the sweat cuz this bad boy is hot hot hot! But oooh soooo hot diggity good! I ordered a level 7 (1-10 being spiciest) and it was just right!

We started with 1/2 a dozen oysters on the half shell, and that was an excellent intro to our fantastic meal! The oysters were fresh and went down the hatch nicely with a swig of cold frosty Kirin! 

We also ordered the shrimp scampi. It came served with loads of succulent tiger shrimp, a heaping serving of fresh chopped garlic and noodles swimming in a pool of buttery glory. Although it was tasty, it simply couldn't hold a candle to the signature pan roast IMO! 

I'm tellin ya, order the pan roast and enjoy! Your taste buds and tummy will thank you for it!

Happy Eats!

My son in law & daughter treated myself and his mom to a Mom's night out down at the Celebrity Theater.  Now this review isn't about the show we saw, but more on the venue. 

I have lived in the valley for 13 years and never knew this place existed, crazy right?

We arrived an hour early so we went down into the club area and son in law & I had some drinks, this is a cool little waiting spot, it did fill up quickly, but didn't feel over crowded. 

Then the doors opened, and I have to say, I enjoyed the set up, we were only 6 rows back from the stage, but after looking around I can't honestly say there isn't a bad seat in the house, and this is a smaller more intimate venue where the stage turns, so everyone can get a great view.  

The seats were comfortable, the show was great. I truly enjoyed my night out with them! Definitely will be checking the event calendar to see what acts/shows will be coming because I don't mind going back!

***The rotating and constantly moving stage of Ka is very impressive; also impressive are the many cinematic elements that Ka employs, making the show feel dramatic, exciting and unique***

Ka was my first Cirque show and I enjoyed it.  The production values were great and the stage and theater were both very impressive.  The show feels like a real spectacle and with the amazing stage, Ka feels like a show that you could only see in Vegas.

There are other good things about Ka.  I really liked how they made the show cinematic.  With the music and the great lighting, there are moments in the show that feel like you are watching a movie on the big screen (the best example is when they make the stage look like its underwater and with the curtain and lighting, it appears that one of the performers is saving someone from drowning and rising to the surface--very well done).

They try to tell a story with Ka too.  It is not a great story, but the story elements kept my interest in Ka more than Mystere (which was more like a series of disjointed vignettes).  Still, after a while, I felt like I had seen enough and I got a little bored.

There are definitely some strong acrobatics, but you might not see the big and more traditional acrobatics like you would see in Mystere.  Still, there is a piece with huge moving spheres that is very exciting, suspenseful and fun.

Ticket prices for Ka are not too bad.  You can typically find tickets for a lower price than O.

The theater is nice (with a good temperature) and they had some decent concessions.  The theater is also roomy enough and does not feel as packed or hot as Mystere's theater.

I enjoyed Ka.  I am not sure if I am ever going to be a huge fan of Cirque shows, but I thought there were mainly elements of Ka that will stick with me (much more than Mystere).  With the very nice venue, the amazing stage and the great cinematic elements, Ka feels like a special and worthwhile show (definitely worth considering if you are in Vegas and looking for a good show).

Ka is in the MGM Grand, which features free parking (both valet and a parking structure--very easy to find a spot in this parking structure).

I have been somewhat flummoxed over how to rate Which Wich.

I believe Which Wich does a nice job making a pricey average sandwich in a quirky feeling store (see photo of the Arrows).

We have been here several times and came yesterday after receiving a coupon by email for a free Regular (Small). My friend used my punch card for a free tenth one.  What that means is that they credit your bill for $5.50.

We both ordered the brown, thinly sliced roast beef. Which Wich defines their sizes as Regular 7", Large 10" and Super 14" You have the option of adding various veggies, or toasting it a la Quiznos. Like Quiznos, Which Wich weights how much meat you get and I would imagine that Regular has about 3 ounces. 

It's only a guess on my part since there is a five foot wall separating you and the person preparing your sandwich.  Why would you not want me to see how you are preparing my sandwich?

My friend's sandwich didn't weight that much when I picked it up.  I ordered the Large 10" (photo) with double meat (a $3.00 up charge). It felt like what a regular would feel like at Jimmy Johns or Jersey Mikes.  So you are paying $5.50 for a 7" sandwich which has about the same meat that Subway puts on their $3.00 six inch.  Yep I know, it's not really a 6 inches.  

In summary, that's $8.50 for a sandwich which would be $5.95 at Jimmy Johns, or $6.95 at Jersey Mike's (all prices do not include taxes).  Good thing they were comping me $5.50. LOL

My suggestion...  drive a little further down FLW to get a better sandwich and a better deal. Sorry.

EDIT 12/2/2014: Chef Hong no longer works there.  Booooooo

I will definitely be a regular now that Chef Hong (ex-Moko) is bringing out his inventive dishes at Kanji.  The former Geisha House location comes off like an Epcot Center restaurant for Japanese food.  The multiple teppanyaki stations, large sushi bar, block wood furniture, full bar, high ceilings and bright lights are very welcoming.  The complimentary sake bomb (one of the best Yelp check-in offers currently) only enhance that feeling.  

Like an amazing movie sequel (very rare), all of Hong's beloved edible characters are here: beef short ribs, 30 hour pork belly, shrimp risotto, in-house smoked fish etc.  They're now being presented with some new and interesting twists from his original, wizardly recipes.  What stay consistent are the flavors, quality and creativity.  There are also some new plates like the excellent miso glazed Chilean seabass and 7 hour pork shoulder.  Seriously.....find me a local sushi joint that's pushing out entrees like these and I will wear a Britney Spears shirt for a week.  

They don't offer AYCE sushi, but the nigiri I've tried has been of excellent quality.  We were informed that they receive fresh shipments every two days which is pretty remarkable.  Kanji also offers a killer late night happy hour from 10pm-2am Monday through Saturday that I plan on checking out pretty soon.

I'm not a gambler a drinker, so LV is not really my kind of town, unless I'm off the strip. The Rio is just that, a little of the strip and closer to where the locals go. 

Upon arrival, I was upgraded to a larger suite, SWEET!!!. The room was very nice, looked clean, didn't smell of yesterdays smoke, alcohol, or any flow play. The bed was a nice comfy size, king. Not sure why the t.v. is placed on the side wall, kind of difficult to watch in bed even have to do the head crank when seated on the couch, opposite the bed. 

The bathroom was fairly clean. I don't understand why hotels especially of such caliber don't wash their shower curtains. Upon inspection, I opened the curtain an almost hurled because of the sour smell the curtain spewed. It was nice to see that they automatically provided those little things you tend to forget, such as toothbrush, toothpaste and shower stuff. The vanity area is a bit odd, nice that there is a single cup coffee maker, but why put it on a shelf and one has to pull out and place on the vanity counter. Couldn't they just raise the shelf above to give the coffee maker enough room to open for water and the coffee packs? I was tempted. 

The casino itself is like any other, noisy and people everywhere. The downside is the HVAC. It must be the original unit since every time I walked out of the casino, I smelled of stale cigarettes. Yeah, I didn't spend much time there. I did, however, spend enough time to try their Pho restaurant. I will be writing a review for this place, so I won't say much here except, that was Pho? Blah. 

The room was nice and the price was good, should I go back to LV, I may consider staying here again.

I love this place!  I noticed a lot of people there and wondered if it was worth the trip.  I wasn't disappointed.  On the day I went, I had a vegieburger and it was really good, came with a salad and blue chips. I brought half of it home and had the other half for dinner.  I also ordered a drink that was cherry and chocolate (delicious).  I am a big fan and would go more but it is a little expensive.  Also took a slice of the chocolate pomegranate cake (their signature dish) and it was really outstanding.  I shall return!

A smooth club promoter named Emmanuel approached us in the mall and dangled free champagne before us.

Now...

I am a champagne lush. I don't like much else... unless it involves fruit, ice, and well...a sophisticated combination of Baileys, Guinness, and Jamison - but I am all over...yes all over - anything having to do with champagne.

So after watching the incredible Le Reve - we made our way over to Blush, with our VIP bands, to get our bubbly on.

I have to admit that I didn't have high expectations for the space, so Blush exceeded any and all pre-conceived notions I had. There was plenty of room to move, good music, the bartenders and cocktail waitresses were friendly (and hot...), the space itself was glamorous and sophisticated, and as soon as we found ourselves in the picturesque and daintily lit outside patio area, some nice folks smiled at us and quickly made room on their table.

It was our first night in Las Vegas, and with our fake eyelashes batting, our brown skin hues pressed up the white chairs, and our bubbling champagne in hand - we couldn't help but bask in the sexy outdoor glow of the night. 

For any girls looking for a low-key way to start the night, I couldn't recommend Blush more. Unfortunately for guys, they do charge a 30 dollar cover, which Blush, though chic and beautiful - is not worth.

Also, while you won't have to fight your way through a glazed eyed crowd, one could even remark and find fault with how mellow the crowd is/was. 

When we were there, people were evidently interested in conversing and mingling. Very few people, in fact no people were dancing, despite the quality music flowing through the lovely space. 

I personally loved the low-key vibe of Blush, but if you're looking for your destination Vegas night spot  full of of table top-dance moves - Blush may be too timid for your liking.

When I tell people where I grew up they often respond with "I didn't know people grew up in Las Vegas." True, it's a transient town but whenever I get together with fellow natives I find it hard to resist the pull of the buffet. 

This much I've learned: Atlantans have fried chicken. New Yorkers have bagels. Bostonians have lobster rolls. And we Las Vegans have the buffet. Though I managed to be in LV for less than 48 hours, I made sure a trip to the buffet with a couple of old friends was on my itinerary.

On Sunday morning we waited about 20 minutes in line for the chance to gorge ourselves on prime rib, mashed potatoes, creamy corn chowder, soft serve ice cream with Butterfinger pieces on top, shrimp, roast turkey with gravy, slices of cheese, sushi, grapefruit segments, champagne and a lot more that I cannot recall at the present moment.

But as I dug into my plate I looked across the table at my friends and said, "Now I feel like I'm home. . ."

I was here shopping in Scottsdale's Old Town just around lunch time. I got hungry so I checked the best place for lunch in the area on Yelp and found The Mission, was highly rated. It was across the street from where I was standing so we headed that way.

When we arrived we were able to get a table in the outside courtyard in the front of the restaurant. We informed the waiter we had very little time for lunch. The three of us ordered margaritas with salt at $8 each. They charged an extra $2 for one with Cointreu. We ordered two Almejas Al Vapor stews for $14 each and one shaved Kale salad for only $10. The shaved kale salad consisted of aji amarillo vinaigrette, baby heirlooms, blood orange, goat cheese & marcona almonds. My friend loves kale. The Almejas Al Vapor is a peruvian clam stew, rock shrimp, chorizo, pan de yucca, aji amarillo & roasted corn. I especially enjoyed the unusual appearance and spice of the stew. See my pic. The stew made me want to go to Peru for some more. I have never been to Peru. 

The waiter was very expeditious in serving us.

My total bill for the three of us for lunch was a very reasonable $69 without gratuities and we were all happy with our meals, margaritas and service.

Oh Ma Gawd! Samantha needs to get her sweet little ass to Talavera. Then she would have her best meal so far. This certainly ranks as one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. From the lobby of the masculine Four Seasons (like Ralph Lauren masculine, not Martina Navratilova masculine) to the bar to our own private dining room, everything was simply outstanding. 

Chef Frank Robertson had prepared a special seven course meal for our party, we just had to select our own entree and the decision was agonizing. I went with lobster served with corn, baby squash and cabbage. Perfection! Preceding my entree we had three amuse bouche; Blue Fin Tuna Poke, Sesame, Avocado ; Heirloom Tomato and Burrata, Basil, Orange Olive Oil, Balsamic and I'll be darned if I don't remember the third.

 Did I mention we had predinner cocktails? Belvedere and freshly squeezed grapefruit juice for me and a round of Absolut LA drinks for most of the others. And the wine. It was pouring like Morton salt. My favorite was a Carneros Pinot Noir. Like drinking liquid velvet! Other foodies raved about the filet, the scallops and the sea bass. Prices for entrees ran from high 20s to mid 40s. Worth every penny. Dessert for us were several plates of sweets...small pieces of various delights from truffles to cakes and pecan bites. I felt like Lucy on the chocolate factory line. Dare I say I stashed a few in my cleavage for the ride home? 

Misc:
Service was five stars all the way. Thanks to all who made our party special.
The long fire "pit" outside is fabulous.
Views of the Valley....uh...maze...ing!
Cloth handtowels in the restrooms. Nice touch. Cotton is afterall the fabric of our lives. 
Chocolate does tend to melt when nestled between your shirt and your chest. 

Cheers my yelpitas. Here's to a fabulous winter in Arizona!

In 24 hours...

You are committed to getting your dinner, midnight snack, breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, pre-dinner and dinner again.  Well, that was my original plan when I first heard about this deal but here's what really happened...

8:11pm dinner - Caesars Palace's Bacchanal Buffet.  This is the hottest spot in town for buffets right now.  If you decide to dine here, there is a supplemental charge of $15 on top of what you already paid.  And it's for each time you decide to dine here within 24 hours. (Retail value $49.99)

9:30am breakfast - Paris Le Village Buffet.  Such a darling place to dine at. (Retail value $20.99)

3:30pm lunch - Flamingo Paradise Garden Buffet.  All the grannies and pappies dine here.  I believe they are locals.  But they have an amazing desert spread and the food was not too shabby. (Retail value $19.99)

6:15pm dinner - Planet Hollywood The Spice Market Buffet.  We were still full from lunch but forced ourselves to sit and eat more crab and nibbled on everything else.  Since this was our last buffet stop, I made sure I enjoyed as much crab as I could squeeze into my already bloated belly. (Retail value $29.99)

Did I get enough to eat?  Yes
Did I get my money's worth?  You bet I did
Was the supplemental charge at Caesars worth it?  Yes, it was
Would I do this again?  Hell no!

We planned our entire day around making it to these buffets and it added in some unnecessary stress.  I did it, I loved it, I won't be doing it again.  But for those of you who love to eat buffets, then this is seriously the best deal in town.  Go for it.

Cost savings analysis!
Paid $49.99 + $15 = $65
Retail value $49.99 + $20.99 + $19.99 + $29.99 = $120.96
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAVINGS!!!!  $55.96 

OR

$65/4 meals = $16.25 for each buffet (winning!)

Just don't throw up afterwards, then you'll really get your values worth :)

Why does everything have to be SO BIG?! Usually we Yelpers don't complain about that (ha!), but in this case it's just ridiculous. Not to mention the potential for inducing heart attacks is immeasurably increased. It must be part of the appeal / gimmick, but too bad larger sizes don't translate to better food quality.

We were here for breakfast at 8 AM after a long night of partying and gambling (we hadn't slept yet) so at this point everything * should * have tasted good, right?

My Grilled Cheese with ham was hearty and a decent size -- thankfully not a monstrosity. The "Hash Browns" were more like a plateful of overcooked potato chunks, most of which were too hard in texture to eat. The "Side of Bacon" turned out to be an overflowing platter of much-too-crunchy, strange looking meat strips.

Service was friendly when we arrived, but seemed more hassled as the room began filling up for breakfast. 

All in all, an okay experience but would only come back for convenience (a.k.a. when staying at the Mirage and cannot make it to a restaurant outside the hotel).

TIP: Size isn't everything.

DATE TIP: Size isn't everything. Wait, what?! I'm talking about the sandwiches!

For brunch we decided to come to  Bouchon, and it didn't disappoint. From the get-go the service was top-notch. Our( forgot his name) waiter did an amazing job. He explaining the special they had that day and for his services. But I had to give it to the manager Jonathan. He was so professional,and friendly. He kept on coming by to our table and asking if the food  tasted to our likening. 
As for the food their pastries were fabulous. It was fresh and was  still nice and warm, and not to sweet. Highly recommend the pastrie platter.
The special omelette with skirt steak and potato was just ok. Nothing to fancy  about it.
Their chicken and waffle is a must try dish. The chicken was so moist and well season. The waffle with bacon bits and chives was awesome.
In the end it was a great brunch, and amazing service from start to finish.
Thank you again Jonathan for your hospitality, and your staff for an excellent service, and the wonderful food.

Went there on opening weekend on Saturday.

1.  A billion stair-steps everywhere.  I had fun watching drunk girls trip and fall all over the place.  TROLOLOLOL, loads of laughter.  Someone is going to fall and die and they will get sued and eventually shut down.  You would think being built by Asians, this place would have better engineered walk-ways and lighted staircases, but NOPE.  Instead they hire a bouncer to hold a flashlight to shine each and every staircase.  Kids, this is why you go to college.

2.  Do we really need an Asian themed club?  AS IF THERE AREN"T ENOUGH ASIANS IN VEGAS CLUBS.  Yeah I said it, I'm Asian too, UMAD?  Can we have some diversity?  This way, we won't scare all the White girls and Hispanic girls, you know, the ones actually capable of flirting and talking to strangers instead of the circle jerk AZNs.

3.  No outside patio!!  Some times I just want to connect with a smart girl and stare at her big, beautiful eyes, and tell her my awesome stories instead of just getting bumped by Rotunda and have armpit sweat slapped on my face.  Can't beat XS' outdoor patio.

4.  They don't give out tap water!  The bottle water is 9$!  I didn't come here to drink and get stupid, I came here to flirt, and being the stingy Asian that I am, I think 9$ for water is a really bad deal.  My six pack requires a lot of babysitting and no thanks alcohol.  Asian girls: don't ask me to buy you a drink or if I have a table... especially those of you coming from LA.  It makes you sound really classless and ghetto.  You're not a princess and you're not entitled to free things.  Mommy spoiled you too much.

If you're a nerdy Asian guy who is tired of being BETA and put in the FRIEND ZONE by your rude bitchy Asian female friends and you want to be alpha, aesthetic, and learn how to pick up girls in Vegas or anywhere for that matter, hit me up.  Here is a video of me in Vegas.

Best way to relax in Vegas before your flight home! They definitely know how to pamper you here. Two words: Free B&B (Buffet & Booze).

The lunch/dinner buffet offers light, delicious options. The highlight for me were the super tender **Braised Short Ribs** served over slow-cooked creamy polenta. Warm, savory, and juicy! Also delightful were the **Spinach & Ricotta Gnudi**, perfect little dumplings with a dash of tomato and basil. A fresh corn salad, roasted zucchini, and arugula salad were flavorful and healthy side dishes. The **Vanilla Honey Panna Cotta with Summer Berries** gave the meal a smooth finish.

A whole array of cocktails welcomes you at the bar. Just take your pick and go relax. Love this perk!

You can get some work done in the conference area or in one of the more private work booths. Or sit back and watch TV in the lounge area. Or take a sweet nap on the comfy reclining personal couches. We opted for #3 -- nap.

The decor is very mod and clean, while the setting is quiet and relaxing. My only complaint is that at one point, two employees began talking pretty loudly in Spanish. The serene vibe was slightly ruined, but I was already so content on my cozy napping device that I dozed off anyway.

Overall the service was phenomenal. You will want for nothing.

TIP: Open to AmEx members only. One-day passes are $50, or complimentary for Platinum members. Thank you, travel buddy!

LAS VEGAS RESTAURANT WEEK!!!

$20.00 3 course lunch!!!

I wanted to hit a bunch of places for LVRW, but i could only make it to this one plus dinner at Del Friscos. I read some previous reviews that this place used to be alot more high end, and made some changes to make this more of a tapas place with a bar. It definitely looked more price friendly and $20 for 3 courses was a steal!

I started off with a nice caesar salad, complete with a tiny anchovie and yummy fontina and brioche croutons http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=i2U5iJLxkTWXSHQAdivVNA

The shortrib sandwich was next http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=LcQPsvafLFyw9GLqWZMl9Q.
It was almost like a bahn mi. Bread was yum and shortrib was tasty. I enjoyed it better when i put some of the coleslaw into the sammie. 

Lastly was some tasty sorbets for dessert http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=rWJOt4nICtNbUqEqtZaIIQ

We also added an order of the Cuban Panini. I wished we had ordered the tuna tacos instead. The panini i think would have tasted better with some bacon in it. hahaha. The bread was a little too heavy. HOWEVER the FRIES were amazing!!! I think they were twice fried in duck fat or something, cuz i seriously started to break out after i ate some. But it was yummy!

This is Michael Mina at his casual best!  An American pub;  Skeptical poker buds and I walk in ready to be insulted but were pleasantly surprised.  Straight to it, the food.

Remember, Mina is a master of seafood; namely lobster so...

There back!  Lobster corn dogs.  Incredibly sweet chunks of perfectly cooked lobster in a crispy, fluffy, semi sweet corn dog coating with a tangy whole grain mustard and crme fraiche.  Simply put, good eats.

Other starters such as the duck spring rolls with ginger chili dipping sauce, mint and cilantro (excellent with the earthy flavor of moist duck accented by a decent "Asian" dipping sauce that brings forth the flavor of the oily duck meat and a great, light, crisp tempura or maitake mushrooms in a soy, scallion dipping sauce are excellent.  As with all Mina's restaurants, try what sounds different.  While not authentic Asian, still very good flavors.

For larger plates, the Lobster roll with jalapeno creamed corn is excellent.  It's not Northeast authentic but who cares.  Rich, perfectly cooked lobster in a crisp, buttery roll surrounded by a very spicy creamed corn.  The flavor of the jalapeno brings a rich chili taste that contrast well with the sweet, cold water lobster.  The Korean BBQ salmon burger is also good eats.  Soy marinated, cooked medium, and accompanied by cucumber kimchi and ginger aioli is incredibly well balanced.  Complex texture.  Simply delicious.

Great pub style service.  Friendly and correct.

Nice selection of craft cocktails and infusions.  Solid but not too creative beer list.  OK wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.

A worthy replacement for Seablue.

OUTSTANDING seafood.

"That was really good.  What was it?" asks my Midwest white friend

"Spicy jellyfish with bean curd" is my straight face response.

"Huh?  So what is this?" he stupidly continues.

"Um, sea cucumber with abalone"; again straight faced.

"What?!?" With great exasperation in his voice.

"And this is Santa Barbra Spot Prawns with their egg clutch, deep fried crab with fermented black beans, steamed live fish with ginger onion, and the soup was made from tiger shark fin".

"I think I'm going to be sick" is all he can say.  Sorry I can't help but to explode in laughter.

Joyful House is a Cantonese seafood restaurant for the initiated.  I'm not sure if I should even write this review.  It's one of those places that long time Asian Vegas locals cherish.  Yes its won the "Best of Vegas" from the Review Journal but that barely speaks to it's hidden greatness.

So maybe they need to get to know you before they reveal their secrets, persist.  For example, you MUST ask for their spot prawns with the eggs.  Yes, they are now $12 each but they are worth every penny.  Eggs exploding in your mouth with the essence of fresh shrimp.

The spicy jellyfish was excellent.  Clean oceanic flavor accented by sesame and chili oil, and a touch of soy.  The sea cucumber with abalone, a tender sweet explosion of sea flavor.

Don't hate me but this is one of the few places that still uses real shark fin.  While I deplore fining and think it's inhumane, I couldn't resist.  It's been 12 years since I had the real thing.  Add a jigger of Remy XO, perfect.

This is not your typical Cantonese restaurant.  Yes, if you choose, they make great Americanized favorites (beef broccoli. shrimp fried rice, "Peeking duck", lemon chicken, shrimp with honey walnuts) but ultimately only those in the know will experience it's greatness.

Shhhhh.  Not for everyone.

"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster." - Henry Hill in Goodfellas (and secretly most guys watching the movie)

The Mob Museum was better than expected (3.5 stars), but, at $20/person, not exactly an offer you can't refuse. Here's what Wise Guys know:

 * Open 10:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. (8:00 p.m. Fri/Sat)
 * Adult: $20; Child (10-17): $14; Under 10: Free; Seniors/Military: $16; 
 * Nevada Residents can save $6 ... so $14 and $10
 * $30 Tickets for 2 Museums available: Neon Museum plus Mob Museum
 * Parking Lot next to Mob Museum is $5 ... or use a downtown casino lot & walk
 * Located inside the historic (1933) Las Vegas Federal Courthouse & Post Office
 * The self-guided tour takes a couple hours and covers 3 floors
 * The Mob Museum shows how Prohibition led to the expansion of the Mafia
 * The real wall from the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago is there
 * Exhibits cover legends Al Capone, Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel
 * Also Sam Giancana, Lefty Rosenthal, Mickey Cohen, John Gotti, & Whitey Bulger
 * The FBI & government get props for their battle against the mafia
 * Weapons, crime scene pics, and mob stories are everywhere
 * Lots of photographs of real mobsters and stories of their "real" families
 * The history of Las Vegas in the pictures/displays was very interesting to me
 * There's as much memorabilia of Las Vegas as there is for La Costa Nostra
 * Original casino/bar photos were fascinating; my how far Vegas has come
 * Liked displays on connections between mob families in different U.S. cities
 * One floor is dedicated to the actual Courtroom used for a Kefauver Hearing in 1950
 * Of course, Mob Movies are highlighted/celebrated, too.
 * No food/beverages, professional cameras, or large bags ... and no weapons
 * Small Mob Museum Gift Shop had some friendly people working there

At times, the Mob Museum feels like a romanticized Hall of Fame for organized criminals and law enforcement catching them. Because it is relatively modern, many of the displays keep your attention. It's not in the "must-visit" category for a Vegas vacation or weekend, but if you're tired of the casinos, clubs, shows, and action on the Las Vegas Strip then you may consider the Mob Musuem to "see what everyone's not talking about."

Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat

Marquee Nightclub was packed. The music was thumpin' and the drinks were flowin'. Who cares if there were more dudes on the crowded dance floor than ladies? We were there to jump and dance ... and after quickly staking out a spot in the middle near the front, that is exactly what we and a few hundred of our new best friends did.

Tip #1: Stay at the Cosmopolitan. Go online and book a room because it includes free admission to Marquee through a much shorter line. It'll also give you a place to freshen up before hitting the club and crash/party afterwards. Ask for a room in the East Tower for convenience to Marquee.

Marquee Mondays makes Marquee a reason to stay in Sin City an extra day. The EC Twins and Nadia Ali performed on the Monday before Christmas and this was like an early gift from Santa.

Tip #2: Get on the main dance floor early cause by midnight it was wall-to-wall people with almost no one getting in or out. Many "couples" were frustrated with the tight quarters, so, come prepared for bumpin' and jumpin' with people from all around the globe.

DJ Lisa Pittman worked it at the pool while Eddie Makabi and another DJ pumped up the beats inside before the headliners came out around 12:30. Nadia did a 30-minute live set which had the crowd frothing and then the energy reached a peak with the frenetic twins.

Tip #3: Get a table if you aren't planning to stake out a spot on the crowded dance floor. If you are just wanting to chill at a club, the outdoor pool vibe and tables may be best or get one of the prime spots inside so you and your crew can dance in your own area.

Drinks are expensive ... of course, and table service is crazy expensive. Plan accordingly.

Marquee was a blast. We loved the vibe, the confetti, foam light sticks, blasts of cold air, and non-stop beats. If you get free admission to Marquee while staying at The Cosmopolitan then it is easily a 5-star night for any EDM fan.

Living up to the hype.  A warm and contemporary Italian American eatery that delivers great tastes with the energy that is Vegas.  

This is not an authentic taste of Italian regional specialties rather refined and prettied up versions of Italian American favorites.  All good, it works.

The majority of the menu centers around small plates of antipasti shared family style.  Flavors are very complimentary so ordering a wide variety of dishes works.  An incredible simple grilled broccoli rabe natural bitterness is enhanced by hints of char and smoke but brought to life by a spicy, chili vinaigrette.  Sweet peppers stuffed with a tangy goat cheese and peppery olive oil create a very well balanced dish exploding with freshness.

For seafood antipasti, do not pass on the lobster arancini.  Dressed with a spicy pomodoro of Calabria chili and a touch of a herbaceous basil aioli that elevates the sweetness of the lobster.  Slightly cloying mouth feel but great flavors.  

Great selection of well made salumi.  Try a variety.  The Bresaola and finocchiona as good as any in Tuscany.  Add a selection of cheeses with perfectly paired condiments (Mozzarella with a citrus chili pesto,  Parmigiano with honey).  

Small selection of pastas.  The lobster ravioli excellent.  Perfectly cooked sheets of pasta surrounding chunks of barely cooked through lobster perfumed by tarragon.  Richness on richness but it works.

The only weakness of the restaurant are the mains.  A mustard, walnut, and raisin crusted rack of lamb, while perfectly cooked was one dimensional, needing more herbaceous, lemony gremolata.  A bone in "Tuscan" rib-eye topped with a sunny side up egg did not make sense.   The yolk did nothing to elevate the flavor of the beef rather giving it an unpleasant yolky aftertaste as it cooled.

Service is a work in progress.  Slow and lacking confidence.  This will definitely improve with time.

Decent wine list at Vegas resort prices.

Guys, admit it, Giada turned you on to cooking shows.  Now the chance is here to try the food you know you never cooked.  Worthy.

Another fun staycation. I'm just glad it was free! The room was clean and spacious enough for us. We let them know ahead of time that we would need to use the sofa bed and they assured us that it would have a blanket, sheets and pillows, but it didn't. The sofa bed was not comfortable and flimsy. The following morning were able to get room service to set the bed up right. It still wasn't comfy, but at least had sheets and such. The regular bed was comfy and roomy. Room service spoiled me with a bag of yummy caramel popcorn that I couldn't put down. The kitchen area is nice if you bring your own pots, pans, utensils and food! The kitchen was bare. I didn't plan on cooking a meal anyway so found it useless. There is a small stove-top yet no coffee maker? I didn't get that. At least at a "motel" I would have had a coffee maker and coffee/tea packets complimentary. The fridge was stocked, but I didn't get anything from it since it is overpriced. Be careful when opening these fridges because if you even pick something up to look at, the sensor will know and charge your room for it. 

There is a cafe, bar, starbucks and of course room service for food options, but nothing else as far as I could see for dining. At least there are other hotels within City Center to check out dining options at and of course shopping. I can't say I would recommend this place to anyone but if you get the chance to stay here for free, do it!

A late night dessert restaurant is something every area of town needs, and the southwest area is no exception.  So Serenade is definitely a welcome addition to this part of town! 

We arrive after 8 pm and most of the tables are occupied by those enjoying hot drinks, on their laptops, or enjoying a sweet treat.  We grab the one large table by the counter and it takes awhile for us to decide.  Ultimately, we get the Honey Bread ($8.50) (aka Honey Toast) with extra honey and two drinks - the Pistachio Latte ($4.50) and the Peppermint Latte ($4.50).  The flavor is quite subtle for the Pistachio Latte and the Husband enjoyed it.  The Little Guy preferred my Peppermint Latte more though.  The honey bread is lovely as usual, but they do offer a Garlic version for 50 cents more.  Apparently it's garlic butter instead of plain butter used on it. 

The menu has your standard cafe drinks, hot and cold.  Waffles, cakes, pizzas, and pastries are among the items to munch on.

They offer outside seating and blankets too!

Stamp cards are available via the Epoxy app, so download for your Buy 9 Get 1 Free cards.  

Since they are located in the Smiths's Shopping Center, and the same corner as Rice N Noodle and Patty's Closet, there is plenty of parking available.  Free WiFi - look for the pass code on the board behind the register.

Overall, a nice alternative to meet up with friends at for coffee and cake.

My parents taught me, "when you don't have something nice to say, then don't say anything at all."

Yelp has taught me, "when you don't have something nice to say, tell it like it is."

Sorry mom and dad, Yelp FTW!

I like my restaurants how I like my style, un-cramped; unfortunately, this place is packed full with wall to wall tables and chairs leaving about 3 inches in between you and the guy at the table next to you. Don't plan to come here during the lunch rush with a big group, you're lucky if you can fit one or two people through the door. The parking isn't that appealing either, you are practically parked in the middle of 16th street traffic. :-/

La Condesa makes a pretty good taco, and their salsa ain't bad either. To their benefit, they do have some fairly unique salsa's to choose from, such as strawberry, peanut, and pecan; but in my opinion, unique doesn't necessarily = awesome. Any of their tacos will do you right, but my favorite is their pork.  

In my opinion, and lets face it, if you're reading my review, that's exactly what you're looking for right? La Condesa over stated when they went with Gourmet in the name. Sure, everybody likes their taco's but who wants to pay $9 for two tacos and leave feeling like they were packed in like sardines in the middle of a seedy neighborhood? If it isn't obvious yet, I don't plan on coming back soon, I can take or leave their salsas and tacos and wouldn't be bothered either way.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, hope you find that hidden taco gem you've always been searching for.

Pita House is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. They've got me craving it often but I don't feel bad because their food is every bit as healthy as it is delicious. Everything is made fresh and in house including their bread. There isn't a can opener on site and nothing is processed.

I'm in love with their tabouli salad (see photo). It's been absolutely perfect every time I've ordered it. The beef kabob skewers are also great with their famous garlic sauce. It's a must try! I've ordered their gyros and those are yummy too. They serve theirs on a pita and not that thicker flatbread like I've had at Greek restaurants. Possibly because their food is Lebanese and this is a different style. I have no complaints though. Just wanted to point out that it was uncommon to me. Regarding the rest of the menu, I haven't gotten too adventurous with that yet so I can't comment. However, this is one of those places where I am willing to bet that everything on the menu is good. Next thing I plan on trying is their hummus. I was with a friend that ordered that and it looked amazing!

Service is excellent and staff is all friendly. 

Random Quirky Fact - Apparently the cast of TLC's Sister Wives are fans too. You'll see their autographed promo card near the cash register. And all this time I assumed they lived in Utah...

Excalibur Hotel is child's play compared to the elite hotel resorts of Las Vegas ... at 1/2 the price tag ... making it a deal for you bargain hunters or families on vacation. If you have children or need a "beginner" hotel for the whole Vegas experience, choose Excalibur.

Welcome to the future site of a cool five-star Vegas Mecca. Once they tear this down and build a new mega-resort, you can tell your grandkids that you stayed here back when it was Excalibur. 

Until then, here's what you'll find ...

 * Hotel Rooms ... nothing fancy, but you've slept in worse (probably)
 * A Casino with lower table limits and more frowns
 * A small Sports Book for Dad to prove he was right about the home team
 * Food is like choosing a restaurant at your local mall
  ... Excalibur Buffet ($23 for dinner and less for breakfast or lunch)
  ... Buca di Beppo - American chain of Italian-style re-heated food
  ... Dick's Last Resort - The Applebee's of Vegas
  ... A Steakhouse with $41 Rib Eye Steak or a 3-course Sirloin meal for $37
  ... Baja Fresh - Mexican Fast Food
  ... Food Court with Krispy Kreme, McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Cinnabon, & more
  ... Octane Lounge (Fri/Sat) & the "Lounge" are bars for adults to reminisce
 * Entertainment is great if you're letting mom plan your trip
  ... Tournament of Kings: Jousting banquet ($66) using your hands to eat
  ... Thunder From Down Under: Mom's/Girl's Night Out ($57 - $67) - chiseled abs
  ... Australian Bee Gees - Tribute show ($45-$60) not as fun as Fallon & Timberlake on SNL
  ... Fun Dungeon is a huge arcade full of games (10am-10pm)
  ... Pool with bar & food service full of kids taking a Dungeon break
  ... Shopping is limited to mall-style boutiques for kids and mom's
  ... A Wedding Chapel - Good luck.
 * That funky aroma you smell is annoyed disappointment ... or weed

For now, Excalibur survives as a low-end property in the MGM Resorts brand (with the MGM, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay, Aria, Vdara, Mirage, and Bellagio). Its prime location on the South end of the Vegas Strip at the corner of Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd is the future site of something much, much better. Til then, Excalibur has accepted it's cheap existence and you should, too.

I'm going to have to side with the vinyl on the window.  NLS does open at 10am M-F, and thankfully for me, my second excursion to this unexpectedly spacious scuba store was fortuitous.

Walking in, I executed the traditional panoramic overview, sweeping my head from left to right, at which point I noticed Sheldon.  Throwing him a head-nod, I offered up a "What's up?" that probably sounded more like "S'up".  That is the bane of being raised on the streets of suburban Massachusetts, where the kids who weren't allergic to bee stings called the shots, and would gut you as soon as look at ya.

I mean, I wasn't actually raised ON the streets, but I did spend a fair share of my time playing near them.

I've been to a handful of dive shops here in the valley, and NLS has one of the larger showrooms.  Their assortment of gear isn't as vast as say, Sports Chalet, but its not a corporate conglomerate... and although I'm pretty sure I used that word incorrectly, as an adjective, it provided the appropriate amount of disparagement.

Interesting note... purchases over $700, if made through an approved GE Capital line of credit, will enjoy a full Gregorian calendar year of deferred interest.  Combine that with the 10% discount extended for being a club member, and that, my friend, spells savings.

For example, the regulator, oct (the yellow line and breather), wireless tank transmitter, and gigantic wrist computer I'm looking at run about $1900 combined.  Subtract the 10%, and divide principal-only payments over 12 months, factor in sales tax... minus the amortization, carry the two...

OK, I think we can all agree, I'm no math whiz.  But, if you purchase a regulator, you'll get the Equipment Specialist course for free.  That's a total prize package worth over $160 US... and I'm gonna do it... and not just because I said I was going to do it in this review... although that is mostly the reason.

And if lake diving aint yo thang, then stop by the trip and travel kiosk, located conveniently in the west wing.  NLS hosts monthly trips to San Carlos MX for only $599 pp based on double occupancy.  Here's the kicker.  You ain't staying in some musty hotel.  No my friend, your accommodations are located in an oceanfront luxury home.  That's how Antonio Banderas would roll, and gosh darn it, why should your roll have any less butter than his?  Two days of 3 tank dives are included, with an available third day of room and diving for a modest up-charge.

Have a little more chang-chang in your pocket, then consider Honduras.  Not only are they know for cigars and the flesh trade, but their diving is unparalleled.  Two words: shark diving.  Get up close and personal with the spiney blast-bots of the sea.  Only $1650 pp based on double occupancy.

All trip deposits are $500 min.  All gear can be rented at NLS.  I'm happy to have a shop, close enough to my house, to call my own.

P.S. That same GE credit card can be used at Global Bikes too.

Like other Yelpers, I found out about this hole-in-the-wall via another Yelper.  I have had it bookmarked for a while!  I haven't gone before today because they only accepted cash!  You guessed it, they accept plastic now.  Whoop.  Awesome.  

I tried the beef tongue, carne asada and chicken tacos.  I thought the tacos were amazing.  I am definitely a food venturing American and I am ashamed to admit that I just love the insides of tacos, but I usually leave the shells.  Either I was super hungry today, or those shells were amazing because, I ate all 3 shells too.  

While the tacos were great, the salsas and pickled veggies were amazing to me.  They have a salsa bar stocked with whole roasted jalapeos, pickled veggies, and regular, chipotle and green salsa.  The salsa was so yummy that I am pretty sure I ate enough of the regular salsa to have been charged for a bowl of salsa soup.  Just fantastic to me.

One nice thing, this retaurant has expanded and can accommodate small groups for lunch or dinner.  

The parking lot is small.  I saw strange things happening at the businesses mext door and I saw some kids walk in large bowls of what looked like was food for someone, I just hoped it wasnt for serving in the restaurant.  Alas....

My return factor for this place is 100% and it could very well be tomorrow!

I came here because a group of us were downtown.  When I entered I thought that it was a stupid gimik but I went a long with it because I was hungry and in a hurry. 

We ordered our food and when it arrived it wasn't the greatest.  It didn't taste that great and the atmosphere was cheesy.  

While we were eating we heard a couple come in and ask to be seated.  The nurse at the front told them that they would have to put on a hospital gown.  The girl in the couple looked at the gowns and noticed that they weren't clean.  Thats when I looked mine over and noticed that she was right.  She immediately said that because she has been diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; she shouldn't be forced to wear that.  I know someone who lives with that disorder so I know that they have high anxiety when it comes to cleanliness.  The nurse argued with her until the girl asked to talk to a manager.  The nurse yelled across the restaurant to an old guy in a Dr outfit who claimed he owned the place.  

He arrogantly asked "what's the problem," in the same tone the nurse was having with the two patrons.  The girl stated that she didn't want to wear the medical gown because she didn't trust how clean it was and the manager said, "leave then!"  

The girl responded, "you would rather us eat somewhere else instead of voting with our dollars here?"

The so called manager started to get in both of the couples faces in an aggressive manner.  The male part of the couple was just standing there and didn't say a word until the manager started to make the couple feel apprehensive. The old manager then threatened the guy after the couple had exited the front door.  Thats when the guy started to stand his ground and call the manager out as a coward.  The guy told the manager to come at him if he wanted to threaten him otherwise he should go back inside and eat a %@)#.  "You obviously like a lot of meat in your mouth."  I started rolling after that and expected the manager to do something.  

I thought the situation absurd because the so called 'owner' threatened a couple who wanted to pay to eat at his horrible restaurant.  Then when the manager was bowed up to, he had to cowar back and close the door.  

I wont be coming back to this place after the way I saw patrons were treated and after I saw that the restaurant won't make exceptions for someone who has been diagnosed with a disability.   The "owner" made the situation worse and made himself look like a coward.

I have been to Marquee a few times already, but this time is THE WORST experience ever. Yeah, the lines are extremely long, the wait is probably 1-2 hours, and it was crowded in the venue...but all this still won't make me as mad and as disappointed...

Basically,  two of my friends and I had a couple drinks at the bar, then we went to the dance floor and started dancing. My friend and I decided to take another shot at the bar...While we were walking to the bar, we got stopped by the security and asked us to follow them. At this point, I thought that, "I guess I am really fucked up and I'm going to get kicked out!"

So we continue to follow the security, which leaded us into a room. Next thing the security in the room yelled at us and said, "Where is the E? Why are you guys selling E?"  The fact that we did not have any E or drugs, my friend and I were really confused. We told them we didn't have any drugs, but the security kept yelling and questioning us and even said that they got us on tape for evidence.

At this point, I was EXTREMELY frustrated and felt very disrespected, so I took all my belongs out from my pocket and told them," Find the fucking E if you can!!!"  Since they couldn't find E or drugs, you would think that they would apologize for the mistake and let us go... HELL to the Fucking No... They said, "Here's the deal: you guys are banned from Marquee, Tao and the Cosmopolitan property forever." Then, they took a picture of us, and released us from the back door... is this a fucking joke?

First of all, your asses did not find any drugs from my friend and I. Second, you guys were even trying to threaten us with all kind of tricks: "We have everything on the tape!" "We will call the police!" and other bullshits as well, to forces us to admit something we did not do! Where is the fucking justice?!

Recently I was invited to a dinner which featured several of the most famous Las Vegas Japanese restaurant owners. It was unanimous in their opinion that they believed RAMEN TATSU was the best TOKYO RAMEN-YA in America. Yes, you heard that statement correctly. TATSU is NOT a Kyushu Ramen-Ya, it is a TOKYO style Ramen-Ya that specializes in Shoyu style broth. If you don't believe me, ask the owner himself. The owners name is Wayne and he is a very respected man in the LV Japanese-American community. 

RAMEN TATSU is unique in the fact that all ingredients are natural/organic style. Wayne uses three different types of natural chicken bones for the broth in his Tokyo style ramen. He also uses three different types of natural pork bones for his Tonkotsu ramen. No other ramen-ya in Las Vegas goes this far out of their way to produce such a rich broth. Many Japanese yelpers express that the reason California(Sawtelle Blvd) ramen is so much better than LV ramen is because the California places use this style of cooking. The cook and owner has been the force behind many of the popular ramen-yas in Los Angeles. He was the man responsible for the recipes which have now achieved notoriety, the same recipes from the LA ramen-yas that attended this years Ramen festival at the Rio Casino. 

The signature dish at RAMEN TATSU is the Shoyu-Tonkotsu fusion. This variation of ramen has become increasingly popular in modern day Japan. It's origins stem from the Kobe area, where it has become a new subregional variation of ramen. On account of the fact that Wayne is from Kobe, he has many years of experience preparing this subregional variation.  The recipe at TATSU remains unchanged from the recipe from Kobe while Monta's Shoyu-Tonkotsu is not the authentic recipe, instead it is merely an invention of the Kurume cook(who is now a Brazilian dude), who mixes his Kyushu broth with a generic nonaffiliated shoyu broth. What I am expressing is that RAMEN TATSU has the only authentic Shoyu-Tonkotsu in LV. And, this is the item you should order during your next visit.  

The Curry- During your next visit at RAMEN TATSU, you should not neglect the Japanese Curry. TATSU uses their own secret recipe which facilities a unique taste which upon my assessment is superior to CoCo Ichinbanya and Kaba Curry. In a demonstration of unique cooking styles, the Chicken broth from the ramen is used as the backing for the curry. Wayne's own particular Gram Masala is then instilled into the broth, and combined with three different types of vegetables. The resulting product is curry that is as addictive as Mr. Zenbayashi's recipe. And during a recent conversation with Mr. Zenbayashi, even he verbally approved of Wayne's recipe. That is a major compliment coming from the man who runs the highest rated Curry-Ya in yelp history. 

They also have Shio Ramen which is great for older Japanese folks. A lot of older Japanese people like my Dad refuse to eat Tonkotsu and Miso Ramen, and eat nothing but Shio. 

I will argue that RAMEN TATSU is the most authentic Japanese Ramen-Ya in America. It remains true to the regional recipes in Japan, and the owner refuses to submit to western pressures to "Americanize" his recipes(as you can see, many of the negative reviews are due to the fact that the recipe is not americanized). For example, Wayne recently terminated contracts with noodle suppliers because he felt they were not completely authentic to Japanese standards. For the last few weeks, several Japanese noodle companies have been competing for the contract, while Wayne assesses and samples them all to determine which is the most appropriate. The whole reason that Tsukemen is no longer on the menu is because Wayne demanded his distributors send noodles which were 100% authentic to the dish and made in Japan. He would not accept anything lower, and would NEVER serve an item that wasn't 100% authentic to the traditional Japanese recipe. Tsukemen will return shortly from my understanding. This establishment represents the Japanese culture very proudly and will not give into the pressures to westernize the menu. This is the reason there is no Togarashi. This is the reason there is no Srirachi. This is the reason why there is no cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon. Just like the owner of Kabuto, Wayne won't breech protocol which was established in Japan by the Japanese, for the Japanese. And I respect him a lot for this. Complaining that there is no  Shichimi Togarashi at a ramen-ya is like bitching to the chef at Kabuto about why there is no California rolls while you soak your chutoro nigiri in a mixture of shoyu and wasabi that you plan on eating with a fork. I have to say that I vouch for RAMEN TATSU and encourage all the Japanese-American residents of LV to support this business. 

Just a final note- The music they play here is the theme music to the Final Fantasy games, and old school anime like Cutey Honey, Candy Candy, and the Miyazaki films

Surreal pool party experience. Vegas does it unlike anywhere else, and Wet Republic is no exception when it comes to getting WET!

So you know what you're getting into:

1) Getting tickets in advance substantially cuts down waiting time.
2) Arriving early (before 1pm) does the same.
3) Cabanas cost $1,500.
4) There are lockers available to stow your stuff.
5) The bar sells drinks in enormous lidded cups. Get these and you won't regret it when the splashing starts! Unless you like chlorine as part of your alcoholic mix.
6) It is calm and beautiful when you arrive early and hardly anyone is there. It gets increasingly more chaotic and cramped up through peak pool time (~3pm).

* * * Now, so you know what you're REALLY getting into: * * *

Be prepared for a poppin' party. And when I say poppin', I mean POPPIN'. Super crowded, off the chain, dope beats, crazy splashing. Beach balls are constantly flying, some that may come your way and bonk you on the head while you are distracted, completely unaware. Good thing they're only beach balls! Then the huge inflated whales start coming out. These are much heavier than the beach balls and have more of an impact on your head. But everyone is too busy dancing and having fun to care. NOTE: You can't ride the whales. You can try, but it's impossible.

By the time the headliner DJ (Steve Aoki) takes over, it becomes so rowdy both outside and inside the pool. Outside the pool, a large crowd is clamoring up by the DJ booth. Aoki sprays the crowd with champagne and even throws a large cake with white frosting at them. He is carried overhead by the crowd. Rafts and inflatable animals (flamingos, ducks, and monkeys) are deployed. It's a hot, hot mess on land!

In the pool there is so much splashing that tidal waves are straight up rolling. One guy was so ecstatic to be in the pool that as he thrashed around, he brought his hand down (with his phone) hard onto my forearm. Thanks for the enormous bruise! Of course I didn't feel it until the next morning, probably because of the booze and adrenaline. Before I know it, 4 hours have passed and the drinks and music are still flowing. Wet Republic sure knows how to make it last!

TIP: Be ready to party. Go hard or go home!

DATE TIP: You can most certainly find a date here. Enormous margaritas + dancing in the water + people in swimsuits? Oh yeah, no doubt.

My family and friends have been getting together for a few years here to grub. That will be happening no longer. The last 3 visits were terrible and the last visit specifically was not good. I'm sad about this because I really loved the food before, but now it's just not consistent. On this last visit we were the only customers in the restaurant yet it still took over an hour to receive our food and the food came out staggered. My niece only wanted Egg Drop Soup and they totally forgot to bring it to her and only did so after asking a 3rd time about it. When she finally got her soup it was like a bowl of gloppy gel. I loved the soup here before, so I have no idea what has happened, but it wasn't even edible. What I loved ordering here most, Strawberry Chicken, tasted awful. One thing that wasn't easy to ignore was the nasty smell inside. It smelled so badly of like sewage or something. Then at the end of the meal we noticed roaches on the floor! OMG I was so ready to leave. Drinks come in cans and refills aren't free. After loving this place for so long it's a major disappointment to see New China Cuisine go so downhill.

Las Vegas residents should feel privileged that in our town we have the very best Ramen-Yas in America. I grew up in the largest Japanese Districts of Los Angeles county where the so called "best ramen" comes from. Nothing in Little Osaka or Little Tokyo can compare to the Ramen we got here in Las Vegas. Back in LA, all we had were Hakata Ramen-Yas. There were literally a thousand of them. We had two Tokyo Ramen-Yas(Koraku and Chin-Ma-Ya), and one gigantically overrated Sapporo Ramen-Ya named Santouka. Here in LV, we don't got a Santouka but we got something that is a million times better, RAMEN SORA! 

We all know by now that the 3 Major Ramen Variations are: Sapporo(MISO), Hakata(TONKOTSU), and Tokyo(SHOYU). Here in Vegas our Ramen scene does not follow that generic formula. The scene is dominated by an extremely rare Osaka Ramen-Ya(Fukumimi), and a unique Kyushu variation from Kurume(Monta). The only traditional Ramen-Ya we have is a Sapporo one, which of course is SORA RAMEN. For decades, SORA has been a very popular ramen-ya in Japan. Yoshi-San, who owns and operates many of the better Japanese restaurants in town, decided to make a deal with the owners of the original SORA and acquire the rights to the secret recipe. Thanks to the great Yoshi-San, the most popular Miso Ramen recipe has finally come to America. And to make things better, it came to Las Vegas! Thank again Yoshi.

I wanna give credit to Ian, for always providing excellent service to us. Ian has incredible ramen knowledge.. maybe even more than me. 

For the longest time, SORA was the only Ramen-Ya in Las Vegas that served Shio Ramen(recently Koraku came to town). But, nobody cared because the only people who eat Shio ramen are geriatric Japanese people who bitch about how Miso isn't supposed to be in ramen(My Dad). But, in all seriousness, there is actually a reason why many Sapporo/Hokkaido Ramen-Yas serve Shio. A while ago I was talking with a local Japanese hero at Sushi on Rainbow, who told me that there is a port city in Hokkaido that is world famous for their unique version of Shio ramen. And today many Sapporo Ramen-Yas will present a "knock-off" version of this unique recipe. We always assume Hokkaido Ramen is Miso, but I guess that's not entirely true.  So don't feel embarrassed to order Shio at a Miso ramen restaurant, you are still being true to protocol. 

Curley noodles! Miso Ramen is supposed to have curly and thick noodles. SORA is the only ramen-ya I have been to that gets this right. Santouka has straight noodles even though they claim they are Sapporo. Monta, recently decided to get their act together and began serving "curly" noodles with their miso. I appreciate their attempt to be more authentic to the Sapporo style, but Monta's noodles are way to thin for Miso. 

The Killer Spicy Miso Ramen is what I usually get here. Out of the 10 times I have ordered it, there were 2 times when I couldn't finish it. When you order this, you need a lot of water refills and extra napkins. The spices make you sweat profusely. When Ian is working, he will remember that you are taking on the Killer Spicy challenge and will come around often to refill your water. The other servers unfortunately don't, making the experience more difficult. 

People in Los Angeles think they know what good or "authentic" Miso Ramen is. In reality, they have no clue. We here in Las Vegas have the very best Miso Ramen-Ya in America. In the past, all the big name restaurants in Japan decided to open up their American locations in LA, so it was really awesome to finally get one here in Las Vegas for a change. We got lucky this time... and yeah, f*ck you Los Angeles!

Sadly Al's Beef is gone but Fired Pie is a nice addition to the Northsight neighborhood!  

I came here today for a late lunch. There were no cars parked in front and the inside was cavernously and deserted. Fired Pie I've learned believes their market is providing "a fast, casual and customizable options for your pizza or salad desires. We use local brews, organic foods, cognizant of sustainability and the ..."  Yeah, yeah but do they make a good pie?  In a word, yes. 

This, in some ways, is the pizza world's answer to Jimmy Johns. In essences, "Pizza so Fast you'll Freak!"  LOL  They cook their pies in a wood fired 700 F degree oven, so they're done in less than four minutes. Nice!

The crust is ultra thin and the toppings are very good (see photos). I'm not sure if one individual 10" pie will satisfy you if you have a hardy appetite. But I thought it was very good and filling.  

I had the Tomato & Basil, which has the look of a Margherita pizza, but Fired Pie adds garlic and several types of cheeses for a nice taste.  

The cost was a fair $7.75 (not including tax) and seems like a good alternative to the sandwich/subs guys over near the 101 and Pima.  Specialty pizzas are $2.00 extra. 

So Three and half Stars+, A-Okay!

We ended up at the airport with a few hours to kill, and wanted to have a decent meal at a sitdown restaurant, versus a fast-paced sandwich shop.  We were in the C Terminal, and Zinc looked like the best option.  The menu was pricey, but that wasn't completely surprising being in an airport and our expectations of the food quality.  Unfortunately, we were wrong.

The French onion soup was a good version, but for $14 it needed to be better than just good.  And that was the highlight of the meal.  The steak frites were a complete let down.  It consisted of a flat iron steak, served medium rare.  I guess you have to pay extra for flavor, because it had none.  And the steak itself was so tough and full of fat that it was difficult to chew.  The frites were basically frozen shoestring fries, loaded up with some kind of red seasoning that was also flavorless.  The only thing that made the food passable was an orange sauce that accompanied the steak.  I'm not quite sure what it was, and it wasn't that great, but it was the most flavorful component of the entire meal.

I would go one star based on the food alone, but the service was good and it was one of the only places in the terminal where you could sit back and relax, and not feel rushed.  Just plan on eating somewhere else first, and maybe hitting Zinc for a couple of cocktails and skipping the food.

Don't get fooled by the Trio of fries!!!

If i see a fries sampler, i always want to get all of them. It said on the menu- waffle fries, steak fries and petit fries. You would think petit fries would be shoestrings (a neighbor made the same mistake), but they were just mini waffle fries. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=F4NLspbB1o4xetDmIEKmXQ. You're better off just ordering two different kinds. We ended up too full and not even finishing half of the trio order. Good to share though between 4 people or more. 

I got the signature burger Le Paris. Comes with brie, caramelized onions and bacon. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=5ZAFIRT5zqm6FeTlTH-9zg Tony got the Le Blue http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=t3WtvkSrPOn7tGN-TZwrLw with blue cheese, avo and bacon. 
The burgers were decent, but at 12 bucks each, i wanted Uhmaaazzing and they were not. The hefty burger patty was perfectly round and flattened, but i like my hamburger kind of mishapen so you get those nice charred marks around the edges. 

Service was friendly, everything tasted ok, but i wasn't wowed enough to add to my vegas favorites. 
Inside the Paris Hotel. 
Buddies: please chime in on your best burger in vegas!

WHAT? I can't hear you!
Grace? Died 30 years ago!
Good luck conversing.

I don't review many chains, but I am going to take a stab on this one.  Been meaning to check out a Yard House ever since Josh A's glowing endorsement on the Talk boards awhile back.  102 tap beers sounded right up my alley.  Didn't think I had ever been to one before, but it was pointed out to me that I was at one in San Diego in the Gaslamp Quarter a couple years ago.  Remember really having liked it.  Probably would have gone 4 or 5.  Low 3 on today's visit.

The music was blaring loud this evening.  I'm sorry, but Matchbox 20 was not meant to be played that loud.  They are not even that good as background music.  I thought the waitress was going to kiss my mother on the lips as she was leaning in so close to hear the order.  Do they really think people like the music that loud?  Most of the customers were either parents with kids or gray-haired snowbirds.  No one was rocking out to it. 

Had two Uinta Hop Notch's which I have never seen anywhere else before.  Quite tasty.  The menu is very extensive both on beer and food.  Got the Mediterranean flatbread as an appetizer.  It was not good.  No sauce whatsoever, just toppings on crust.  Would have also been much better if the tomatoes were sun dried.  Would not get it again.

The blackened swordfish tacos were pretty good.  Little light on the fish, but excellent flavor with a healthy dose of guacamole.  I would definitely get these again.  Also had a couple bites of the Vodka Shrimp Pasta.  Think I will get that the next time I go when they open at West End in St. Louis Park.  Hopefully, they will use the volume dial on the music more prudently.

Where to begin?

I came here yesterday to purchase a cup of tea, but what I encountered was a high pressured sales experience!

Recently I noticed that Starbucks bought Teavana and I decide to give it a try.  Teavana is located across the street from my office in Kierland. I went inside and asked about their Rooibos or other white teas.  It was too late in the day for a Oolong and I wanted something light.  

When we lived in Seattle, I use to enjoy stopping at Peet's Coffee & Teas in Fremont. http://www.yelp.com/biz/peets-coffee-and-tea-seattle-2 Their selection was outstanding and I had high hopes for Teavana.

I vaguely remember hearing stories of the hard sell employed here.  Sadly, they were all true.

I came in and asked if they sold hot tea, or were they strictly a bulk outlet. No, I was told they did both.  Great!  I asked if they carried any Rooibos, or other white teas and I was shown some strong black teas and Oolongs.  "Danger Will Robinson", I thought.  I corrected the salesperson and said I wanted something lighter, that didn't have as much caffeine. 

Well, this went on for a while, but I finally purchased a Grande size cup of one of their teas for $5.45. It took ten minutes, after several false started.  As I was leaving, I tasted a samplers outside and decided to get some tea for home.  The tea I like, Samurai Chai Mat wasn't sold in a bag and  I was informed that I needed to purchase one of their tins for $7.00!  Hmm, okay I thought.

I asked for a small amount to take home.  They filled the tin and I was told that would be $56.00. I said empty half the can and then it was $34.00. So I asked how much was it an ounce and was told $6.30.  In the end, I paid $19.53 for 3.1 oz and along with my $7.00 tin including taxes it came to $27.57.

I've skipped the blow by blow dialogue. In sales, these tactics are called the "Assumptive Close". It's where the salesperson, assumes you want the largest amount, or a fully loaded car, er tea -- until they are corrected. It can be exasperating and somewhat annoying.

In the future, I'll pass and stick to Starbucks. I never thought I would ever say that!

My friend and I have wanted to go to the Butterfly Wonderland for a while and the time came to go! We met up on a Sunday morning and got our ticket to check them out!  

What does Butterfly Wonderland got going for them? Well they are the only butterfly atrium in the valley and they say they are America's largest butterfly atrium too. , they say the butterflies inside the conservatory come from butterfly farmers from Costa Rica, Malaysia, Ecuador, Thailand & the Philippines as well as within the US and another fun fact Arizona is home to 344 species of butterflies.  Here comes the sticker shock: its 18.95 plus tax which equals to 20.26 I think it was.  

Once you pay your ticket you walk inside and have to wait in a hallway because you will be directed to watch a 14 minute movie on the migration of the Monarch Butterfly in 3D, we had to wait a few minutes because there was a show already playing.  The movie is cool; you follow a year in the life of a few Monarchs. 

Once your movie is over you are shown into the conservatory, now this is where the fun is it, so many amazing beautifies fluttering around, some look like they are in a game of tag, some just seeing what everyone else is up to, if you stand still and make small movements you might be blessed to have a few land on you, also was told if you wear bright colors they will be attracted to you too, You are not allowed to hold out your hand or try to touch them, but they are allowed to land on you.  I had a few land on me and also had a few fly too close to my face and gave me a butterfly smack or too! Haha  I could spend hours in the conservatory just watching the butterflies enjoying the sun light.

A few things, the conservatory is a tropical rain forest, its humid and misting water is happening, so dress for the rain forest, leave your bags & purses in the car, no need for all that, watch where you are walking the butterflies land everywhere and just make sure you don't step on them. Also inside the conservatory you will see a Koi fish pond, I thought that was cool but also thought hey don't they eat bugs that might land on the water,aawwee poor butterflies that became fish food .

Once you leave the conservatory you go into a smaller room and check to see if you are smuggling any butterflies, and I know that sounds funny, but there were a few that tried to escape before we went through the door. 

Then you get to check a cool ant farm, some fishes and other stuff, and even stick your hand in a tank to touch a sting ray, and yes I did that, but I have fed sting rays before too, it's a cool experience.

This was an enjoyable time, we spent maybe 2 hours enjoying everything, do I feel its worth the 20 buck entry fee, no I don't, but will I be a sucka and do it again yep I will haha.

Regardless of where you are on Saturday, this is definitely the place to be on Sunday! Well, for brunch that is.

From the relaxing views of the well manicured gardens to the elegant dining atmosphere, no detail is overlooked at this posh "English tea party" inspired restaurant. 

The brew here is eye opening and the OJ is freshly squeezed. Small details IMO that make the dining experience that much more enjoyable. In this day and age, we all know little things do mean a lot!

In regards to the brunch fare, I was pleasantly surprised with both the quality and flavor. You can tell the execution was performed with distinction & care.

Although the white chocolate French toast was the claim to fame here, I was hooked by the pictures of fluffy blueberry pancakes on my iPhone Yelp app. Suffice it to say, I was not disappointed at all. It was as fluffy and soft as I expected. I would have preferred more fresh blueberries, but with all things considered,  it was still quite a treat. Especially when I drizzled a generous amount of that warm maple syrup on top and watched it cascade down each thick layer of divine, doughy goodness!

However, the highlight of the meal had to be the Duck Croque Madame. I'd even venture out to say that it's the single best thing I've ever had for brunch thus far in Vegas! Topped with a fried egg (now how can that be wrong?!) this French sandwich was packed with mouthwatering deliciousness!  From the perfectly tender morsels of duck that tasted like it was slow roasted for hours, to the melted Gruyere and caramelized onions (reminiscent of a french onion soup), it was like a virtual foodgasm in my mouth!

So there ya have it, pleasant atmosphere, beautiful views, and incredibly good food.  What more could you ask for? That's right, seconds!

Happy Eats!

(This is an asian persons attempt at rapping, I'm sorry in advanced)

*Throws a beat*

Shit I feel like a balla right now...

I should have a prostitute on my left arm right now...

Where the prostitutes be at right now...?

Oh shit, this place is fancy right now...  

The prostitutes must be high class in disguise right now....  

Scanning the room looking for hooks and tricks right now....

I'm not quite sure why...but I thought it would be fun for right now...

I don't really know what me and the prosties would do, maybe grab a coffee and discuss how they got into the biz maybe...who knows?  *pictures Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman*  Naw I ain't that lucky...

This hotel is new, and with new things comes an exciting new smell.  Like buying a new jacket and wearing it out the store.  Or driving out of the car dealership in a brand spanking new Benz and sniffing the leather.  It's all about the small little things that matter.  And this hotel didn't miss one detail.  Everything was impeccable, down to the wallpaper, amenities, service, decor, rooms, staff.  No detail was left unworked.  Even the crystals in all the lights in the hallways made me smile as they twinkled.

The bars and shops inside this hotel were beautiful, except everything was honking expensive so I didn't really buy anything except drinks.  The pools are beautiful, the spa offers deliciously decadent services and massages.  I have no idea if they have a gym because I didn't go looking for one because I'm on vacay!

The room was like a mini apartment, careful for the mini bar though because if you move the bottles they'll try and charge you!  Make sure to check!

The bed was super comfy, the tv that controlled everything in the room was really cool, the balcony view overlooking the strip was stunning.

There are so many things to see and do in this hotel you don't even have to leave.  We barely left the hotel to do anything because its like a little city in here.  No need to venture out into the elements :)

I love art in all forms--paintings, sculpture, poetry, song, and dance.  I am a "FIRM" believer in supporting artists because they try to tell us a story--through their eyes.  On Saturday, my friend and I stuffed our faces with bacon wrapped hot dogs at Echo Park for Javier's Bacon Wrapped Goodness UYE.  Afterwards, we had nothing to do and thought why not go out and support our starving artists--it's all about giving back.  Lets go to Vegas!!

Service - Woohoo! As good as it gets! + soft and silky skin
Cleanliness - Ambiguous
Price - Enough!
Seafood - Yes, some people refer it to that.
Meats - Yes, yes, yes!!
Vegetables - I think this costs extra.
Dessert - Yes it is.
Fruits - Forbidden fruit?

What was ordered:

"Stoner" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - This Anglo artist told me that she works better inebriated.  I was interested enough to purchase her body of work for my friend--who was also inebriated.  As Stoner revealed her art, she yelled out "And they are all natural!!"  I am "technically" a doctor since I was a Biological Science major as an undergrad and I have some expertise in human anatomy.  The mammary were indeed natural and quite a stunning pair.
 
"Ms. Foodie" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - This Asian artist hails from Arizona and is a recent transplant to Las Vegas.  Her and I had a thorough conversation regarding food.  She loves food trucks because the food is so tasty, cheap, and is convenient in her line of work.  "The Foodie" also loves breakfast and a big fan of dumplings.  She loves to dance to Trance music.  Her body of art is all natural and very inspiring--Frida Kahlo would love her work.

"Frisco" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - "Frisco" is from the Norcal region--San Jose to be exact.  I told her I went to school in Sacramento.  "Frisco" found it amusing that Sacramento rhymed with Frisco.  She chose the name Frisco because it sounded sexier than San Jose.  She loves to dance to Trance music.  Her body of work is all natural--and all so buttery smooth.  "Frisco" told me she is selective with her clients--must be my innocent eyes.  She gave me a kiss on the cheek and told me to go find her later.

"Brazil" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - "Brazil" comes from the lovely country of Brazil.  She loves soccer.  I told her "Soccer?!  You must mean "futbol."  She was very impressed that I knew that--Brazil told me that my name is spelled Joan in Brazilian--accent on the "a."  I asked her what is her favorite food in Brazil and she told me bbq meat--she goes back once a year.  I am a giver so I purchased one of her bodies of art for my friend.  She loves to dance to all kinds of music.  I was too busy perusing Frisco's catalog to notice whether Brazil's art was natural or not.

"Mexican Fusion" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - The young and innocent Mexican Fusion is from Anaheim as well--lucky me.  Her friend was putting on a show and invited her to come along this one night--she didn't have to drive so tagged along.  This artist is a fusion of Mexican and Spanish--her father is from Spain so she gets her light complexion and dark hair from him.  My guess is that she got her body from her mother--lucky me.  She also likes to dance to Trance music.  Mexican Fusion's body of art is all natural--lucky me.

I can already imagine the responses to this review--"Where are the pictures, John?!"  It is true that a picture is worth a thousand words, however, I believe art needs to be experience face-to-face--in the moment.  I strongly urge for all of you to go support your local artists!  FYI - Art ain't cheap!

I wanted to like this gym. I really did. It's gorgeous, after all, and their salespeople do a great job of talking it up. 

First off, I have a very busy and ever-changing schedule. This probably made me a poor candidate for this gym to begin with, as their hours and classes are limited. Anyway, I visited the gym in April and was impressed with the sales rep, the facility, and the quality of trainers. I had very limited time that day (the story of my life!), so I filled out a little card (I did not complete any membership paperwork) and left to carry on with the day.

In May, I began the stressful and lengthy process of home buying and got even busier! David Barton Gym began charging my credit card, and I was fine with that.

Come June, I'm still absolutely slammed and haven't been able to get to the gym. At this point, I had been getting repeated phone calls from these clowns asking me to come in and fill out the paperwork. With everything I had going on, David Barton Gym wasn't a priority. I was fine with them charging me the membership fee. I had no issues. But what did they do? They threatened me. They started telling me that I would be charged MORE because I hadn't filled out the paperwork...

Long story short, I decided this wasn't the place for me due to bad customer service and asked them to simply stop charging my card since I had never officially become a member anyway . I didn't ask for any refunds whatsoever. What did they do this time? They refused to stop charging me unless I filled out the membership paperwork. 

Huh? OK...well, long story short again: Silly me capitulated and signed the membership paperwork along with the cancellation paperwork at the same time, again never asking for a refund. However, David Rivera (who is great, by the way - I feel sorry that he works for that company because he deserves better) insisted that I accept a refund for May. That was a nice gesture. I kept telling him it wasn't necessary, but he insisted so I finally accepted.

Fast forward to July. No refund from David Barton for May as promised, and I didn't really care at that point. I had closed on my house and was in the midst of cleaning, preparing, and moving. It had been a CRAZY two months, and the David Barton Gym was the last thing on my mind.

When I finally got a chance to get my files in order after the moving process, I discovered that David Barton Gym had never STOPPED charging my card! I was in possession of cancellation paperwork that indicated no further charges would be made after May, yet I had charges for June and July.

Making a long story short for the last time, it's August 14 and I STILL haven't received a penny back. I'm left with the conclusion that this place condones fraud and tries to get away with it whenever possible. The General Manager, Greg Refner, has no customer service skills (and no desire to serve or be fair to people) and certainly no urgency for anything...unless it's getting someone to sign membership paperwork under duress. 

I am really appalled at the way in which this entire debacle was handled. I'd suggest staying away from this place at all costs, no matter how glamorous it may seem.

Finally!! 

I've had the Charcoal Room on my list of eats since I moved out here a few years ago.  My neighbor, some co-workers, and even friends/family from California even recommended the Charcoal Room to me. But when it came to other Yelpers, most haven't been here or reviewed them.  The Charcoal Room has a lot of pros and very little cons.  You don't get what you pay for here, you get more.  And if you're having steak, you get a lot more.  I got their petite filet and it was delicious.  Their petite is about 6 oz, juicy, and most importantly, very tasty. Don't let the price fool you.  For less than $30, I had a steak that rivals some of the 5 star steak houses out here.  My filet was so tender that I think I used a butter knife to cut through it.  I had my steak with a side of their Caesar salad, lobster corn chowder, sauted mushrooms, and asparagus.  All portions were huge and I ended up with leftovers. My GF opted for their roasted chicken and baked sweet potato.  Her meal was hooked up too.  I swear she was served half a chicken and a football sized sweet potato.  She said her meal was good as well.  

I have no complaints about the service.  We were seated right away, our orders were taken, and our food was served in a timely manner.  I left the Charcoal Room very satisfied and my only regret is not coming here sooner.  We got a lot of food and paid less than $100 for it.  Yes...I'm sure I will be back.


PS: No pictures of their steak and no pictures of their fabulous forks.  I was focused the night I ate here....focused on my beautiful date.  1OAK!

It is with a bit of sadness that I write this review.  But I am sure that it will be therapeutic in the end.

I took my little dog here for the past 5.5 years.  Most of the time, he went here for boarding and he loved it.  When he would arrive, he would jump from seat to seat in my car and the care takers in the kennel knew my dog and they all loved him very much.  My dog loved this place.  

I liked the indoor/outdoor kennels for him because he liked to run around.  At the end of each visit, my baby boy would come home exhausted from all the jumping and excitement.  Depending on how long he stayed, sometimes, he would just rest for the first day back home.  He loved the excitement of barking at the other dogs and bouncing bouncing bouncing around.

My little guy was also cared for very well when he went here for boarding and I also allowed the doctors there to take care of his veterinary needs.  Once when I was out of town, they phoned me to tell me that the doctors had taken a look at him to make sure he was ok because he seemed to be having some problems.  I appreciated the call.  The doctor that I spoke to explained to me the symptoms to look for when we arrived home.  I did, but never saw them and he was healthy.  VERY healthy.

My dog, unfortunately, got out of our yard and was hit by a car.   I had to bring him here for the last time.  I called the office before bringing him down, as he was already dead and I just didn't know what to do.  Misty was so kind to me and helpful and comforting.  I was understandably upset by it all.  But she comforted me when I needed it and had the paperwork ready for me when I arrived.  I was given all of the information and options for handling my dogs remains.  I paid and I went on my way.  

This office is great.  While some may complain about the prices, I know my dog loved it here.  I would recommend them over and over again.  I know Jack would.

The grilling of food over an open flame is almost 125,000 years old.

And, the Habit Burger story is an interesting one. http://www.habitburger.com/story/  Yet the charbroiling of hamburgers and chicken is a cooking technique that many fast food places have yet to master.  Until now that is. We came here this past Saturday and came away thinking, Wow.

The menu is very familiar.  It will remind many of "In 'n Out" in it's simplicity and style of service.  Their Char-burger is $2.95 and the Double Char is $3.95. I don't know if you can order it animal style, but the burgers are delicious.  Yes, delicious.  It has that smokey char-boiled taste down to where you will want lick your fingers.

Other grilled Habit Burger sandwiches include, Chicken for $5.75, Tri-Tip beef $6.25, as well as Veggie options and Albacore Tuna.  The Sides include French fries, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and a salad range in price from $1.85 to $2.65.  

Besides a side of salad, Habit Burger also has six different Specialty Salads to choose from, ranging from a Garden for $3.95 to a Santa Barbara Chicken Cobb for $6.95.

A couple of burgers, a side of sweet potato fries and a drink ran us $12.68, including tax.  Wow.  Less expensive than "SmashBurger", slightly more than "In 'n Out"; but a lot better tasting.  Nice.

Enjoy!

Rosati's Pizza is my go to pizza joint. They are basically a carry out place. I live too far away for delivery. So that tells you how far I'll travel for an excellent tasting pizza.

They currently have this special where you buy a large and get the medium (excludes the toppings) 1/2 off. I hope I haven't let the secret out on that special. It's been going on for well over a year. I always bump into a lot of Chicago people when in here. I always get a bigger pizza than I can eat since it's the perfect breakfast food. After all, who can resist some reheated pizza the next morning for breakfast!

I really like the thin crust but my family prefers the deep dish. So I'm stuck eating deep dish all the time, lol. This is the best tasting pizza I have had in Arizona. The Cenpho folks might want to venture out of their box and try this pie. This is something even the east coasters would enjoy. 

Once in awhile they'll even mess up your order but they are quick to rectify it if you give them a chance. And once in awhile they'll even burn your pizza a little. Even with these rare annoyances I keep coming back to this Rosati's location every time.

"I must.  I must.  I must INCREASE MY BUST!"

And I squeeezed.  And I flexed.  And I waited.  And I waited...

18 I was (3 years ago...ok fine, 4...and then some), and the twin peaks were like small mounds.  The other girls were wearing big bountiful lacy things and I still hadn't outgrown my sports bra.  They had told me that I must do my exercises.  So exercise I did...religiously.  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3TZB3upHZY )  The only thing the Bust Song and dance ever accomplished was a deflated ego and an increase in my pectoral muscles.  When the realization came that I was gonna need a bro instead of a bra, ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfONNfAjyrc ) the insanity stopped.  Naive much?  Yes.

ENTER:  Gallagher's Steakhouse's beautifully dry aged, bright scarlet, marbled beef displayed in a sealed glass case for all passersby to admire.  It's like that gorgeous girl you had your eyes on but just wanted to look at, not really converse with.  Why?  Because she just didn't taste as good as she looked.  Wait.  I'm still talking about the cow.  Right.

The Signature New York Steak is dry aged for 21 days in order to allow the flavors to seep in.  Although somewhat flavorful, it's rather tough even when served medium rare.  Try it with the accompanied sauces ($3 each).  We liked the Brandied Peppercorn served in a gravy boat.  The peppercorn provides that perfect kick along with the brandy reduction.  

Although the restaurant advertises the signature steaks displayed in their case, it's really nothing more than a good marketing ploy.  The mystery of dry aged beef to be more wonderful in flavor is as appealing as ExtenZe for Men.  In the end, it's nothing more than a stiff wind.

The true star of the evening was the 18 oz Cowboy Ribeye.  Sure, it was bigger than my face, but I rode that cowboy like any good cowgirl would...right into the sunset.  Each bite exploded with flavor.  It was tender, robust, and served with crispy string onions which was the perfect accompaniment.  Service was very attentive and friendly, which earned them an extra star.  Overall, a decent steakhouse though a bit gimmicky.

When Suzanne Somers told me that I could have buns of steel, I took a beating with the Thigh Master.  When the Shake Weight promised to revolutionize the way I tone my arms and shoulders, I ended up looking like I was JACKING. SOMEONE. OFF.  Yes, I fall for gimmicks as much as the guy who bought that Snuggie to free his hands for the remote (as well as "other" activities - notably after popping his ExtenZe pill).  Gallagher's may not have really lived up to the hype, but its marketing genius keeps people like me coming in, in hopes that the product really will deliver.  Every now and then, it's good to keep the hope alive for us infomercial-suckers.

Perhaps one day, I will learn that The Clapper cannot clap off an idiot.

That my ChiaPet will not play fetch.

That I may not "increase my bust" by squeezing my arms across my chest...

But like my breastesses, these hopes and dreams, though late to bloom, would one day become reality...however small and humble.  You just gotta believe...preferably with a Visa or MasterCard ready in hand.

Big yummy breakfast food. AKA comfort food overload deluxe.

My x-brother-in-law told me about The Hash House A Go Go several years ago while we were fishing in Mexico. He said "dude you are gonna love this place, we're going when we hit the docks tomorow, the breakfast there is off the hook."  But it wasn't in the cards as we got thick in the fish and opted for some fresh bluefin sashimi instead.

So fast forward several years, that Hash House place is still ingrained in the back of my mind and what do ya know, while taking a breather from the Venetian's casino I go for a walkabout and stumble on a sign that tells me there is a HHAGG in the Imperial Palace Hotel. So I go thru this construction maze of an entry to the IPH and into the hottest (like 90 degrees) casino on the planet. I go pass the performing blues brothers  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9wjTzw8bEYOTQJk41V8WQw?select=TZSIV-_ypvbTuH7mh_f8cg#TZSIV-_ypvbTuH7mh_f8cg blackjack dealers and up an escalater to find that they are closed! Damn, so I make plans for the next days breakfast.

Wake up at zero dark thirty (6:30) so I can have B-fast before going to the Fabtech trade show. I get there NO LINE! Yes the casino gods are favoring me today. I asked to be seated at the bar for quicker service. This was the first time I ever ordered a glass of milk at a bar, it felt wierd. I then ordered up a Andy's Sage Fried Chicken.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=W3BT2l3t-ifYfCtQ_Q2vbQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

FOOD: Andys Sage Fried Chicken ... This was a giant breakfast, the chicken and eggs atop a couple of biskets piled onto a heap of country style mashed potatoes loaded with bacon bits all covered up with a benedictish gravy with diced bell peppers. This was some good stuff a solid 4 **** Star for me. But less bisket and more of that yummy gravy and it would have been 5 Stars.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VDLsrE-gNdkh8N82jlEo5A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

SERVICE: From the hostess taking my picture http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Eo1U2kj6OyU_a_Kr9pC-6A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw and quickly seating me, to the bar (milk) tender who was way cool and friendly, the service was great, fast and polite. 5*****Stars

I'll be back.

After reading MaryLou D's review on Yelp, a group of us from my office decided to come here for a late afternoon lunch.

We were blown away by this Mom (sorry, no Pop) place. Nana is cooking up some really tasty food. I had the Carne Asada burrito, which was huge.  Take a look at my knife and fork (photo) next to this bad boy. 

Second, the flavors were outstanding and we couldn't get over the amount of meat that she gave us.  Even at $6.50, there must have been well over a cup and a half of diced Carne Asada. Wow. 

While she was making our food, we got a chance to catch up on our favorite Mexican Soaps on the flat screen TV, munching on some chips with some really good and flavorful homemade salsa (with four alarm heat), and all the while enjoying a 16 oz bottled long neck Coke. Atmosphere. Atmosphere. Atmosphere! We didn't want to go back to work. Time moves slowly here, but not Nana. She's always hustling!

Expect to pay around $11, including a very generous Tip to Nana for this incredible meal. Four Stars and yes, we are Fans. Thank you MaryLou!

I hate buffets, but I had heard so many good things about Bacchanal I said I'll give it a whirl for breakfast ($28/each).  We had:

Freshly squeezed juices like carrot and cucumber
Smoked salmon & cold shrimp
Steak & egg
Biscuits and gravy, sausage and cheesy tots
Fried chicken and waffles
Sorbets:  Thai tea; fig & balsamic; mango chile lime; and blood orange

There were also your basic fare of eggs, bacon, hash browns, waffles, and an extensive array of desserts.

The juices were excellent and full of flavor.  I had four:  5 Stars.  In addition, the salmon and shrimp were fresher compared most buffets:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the hot dishes disappointed.  They were not warm.  In addition, the biscuits were not that moist, the sausage in the gravy was not crumbled well, and there wasn't enough pepper:  2 Stars.

On the other hand, the sorbets were really good and flavorful, with the mango chile lime being my favorite.  You could really taste the chile:  5+++'Stars for the latter flavor.  The woman who served me was from Puerto Rico, and we struck up a conversation in Spanish which was cool.

The remainder of the service was spotty.  Although there were many open tables, it took a while to be seated.  The group in front of me thought the same.  Additionally, we had to ask for water, and our glasses were not refilled.  Lastly, we told one server that we were going to the restroom.  However, when we returned, someone had cleared our table:  2 Stars.

I would come back here for breakfast.  However, I would not come back for dinner ($55), and wait an hour or more.  There are far better things to do in Vegas, than wait in a buffet line.

Mr Arm: That's 3/4 of a dead dove sewn to 1/4 of a deceased shark and that over there is a German Shepard penis.
Me: Neat-O. 

Mr Arm: Can you guess what's in that jar?
Me: A cat sewn to a bat? 
Mr Arm: You're half right.
Me: A bat-bird? 
Mr Arm: Getting colder...
Me: bat-bunny?
Mr Arm: Colder
Me: **squinting eyes to decipher the remains floating in the jar of embalming booze**
Mr Arm: It's a cat. Just a cat. No hybrid here, the hair's just gone.
Me: I see.  

**These are actual conversations from my tour of Trundle last Saturday, and one of the best tourist destinations I've ever had the good fortune to see**

First off, I can't believe I get to be the first to review the infamous Trundle Manor. What.An.Honor. But I do have one question: How the hell has Trundle flown under the Yelp radar for so damn long? Step up your game, Pittsburgh! Don't let these gems pass you by. 

All my life I've been told that I'm strange, and in that life I've been to a lot of strange places, but this one is up there--even for me. Defo top 5, maybe even top 2 and absolutely a place a you should put on your bucket list, no matter who you are. Sure, dead sh*t in jars, hobo treasures and the singing steam-punk stomach tumor of a beloved belly dancer might not sound like everyone's idea of a good time, but try to keep an open mind and know that one trip to Trundle Manor will not only act as the centerpiece of your Pittsburgh memories, but as a major talking piece for the rest of your life. Promise. The only issue will be trying to find any place that can live up to the wonderment and awe of Pittsburgh's TM. 

The Curators of Trundle Manor's curiosities are the aforementioned Mr Arm and his lovely lady-friend/fiancee, Velda Von Minx. There's also a live cat amongst all the collected, stuffed and jarred felines named Little Devil who's just the biggest sweetheart. Their story is pretty cute and while I don't want to ruin it for you, it involves two taxidermied married squirrels that are on display in the den. Touring the manor is by appointment only, but there are times of the year where they don't do tours at all because the demand is just too high, namely in October when Halloween requests run rampant. If you're lucky enough to get an appointment to tour the manor, you should note that there is no official cost, though donations are accepted (and encouraged... by me). Keep Trundle truckin'! They'll accept cash in the donation box in the foyer or donation of dead animals, medical devices, cleavers, alcohol (no beer) or anything creepy, just don't be cheap--There's lots of eyes watching you at the manor. 

Among the many oddities already mentioned, you can also spy a number of the items below and then some. 
- Papa, Momma and Baby Bear + GoldiFox
- An old-timey medical syringe that's large enough to act as a cattle prod
- A cat on a hat
- Legos
- Colon photos
- 100+ year old stuffed fox
- Old electro-shock machine
- Jar of human teeth
- Jar of human skin flakes
- Jar of human finger and toe nails
- Tentacles
- A family of amphibians
- A happy turtle/chick hybrid family of five
- Steampunk bears
- Bindle stick bundles
- A gerbil named 'poop'
- Ray guns
- Gimp-type masks
- Original Addams family goodies
- Carnival treasures
- Classically un-classic built-up cars, fit for the zombie apocalypse
- I got lucky and found a rogue bird foot on the floor during my tour, so keep your eyes peeled for hidden treats
- And soooo much more...

When you go (and you NEED to go) be sure to take pics, bring a decent donation and do ask as many questions as can. Half the fun is getting to hear the story behind each of the items from Velda and Mr Arm. If curious, peculiar, macabre are your thing, or even if you were ever a fan of the hit Nickelodeon show Cat-Dog, this is THE place to hit up if you're interesting in seeing a collection of quirk that you won't see anywhere else in the entire world.

Don't tell anyone Christopher. But I have a serious crush on you and your elegant eatery and your fabulous Crush Lounge. This could rival my Scott Baio crush in the 70s. Or my crush on arrugula, beet and goat cheese salad in the 80s. Or even my 90s crush, yep, again, Scott Baio. 

We were greeted by a lovely host person who gave us the 411 on our dining options. We chose the restaurant kitchen bar which had happy hour prices on food and drink. No sooner had Rickie and I bucked up to the bar did we have our server take our drink order: two iced teas and a large flat water. Soon to follow was some delicious pillowy yet crunchy French bread with a ramekin of soft buttah!

While we waited for our food it was most entertaining watching the kitchen staff prepare for what was sure to be a very busy Valentine's weekend. And since I was already with my Valentine, I was most happy. 

We had a delicious cheese plate with herbed chevre, Manchego, Pecorino Romano and a mild cheese I won't even try to spell. I had a crispy, creamy pizza with goat cheese, roasted garlic and oven dried tomatoes. Very good though I kept thinking of my favorite flat bread delight at St. Francis. Hmmm...Rickie had a burger he enjoyed though the top bun was very doughy and not pleasant to eat. Yam fries were tasty though a dipping sauce would have been fun. All that was only $36!

Now. Is it just me but does every new restaurant try to out do the next guy with the jazziest bathroom sinks? Well, I'd have to say, Christopher's takes home the gold. A huge communal sink with a wall in front of you that shoots out water below as you rub your hands over hundreds of little rocks. Enjoyable! 

And now in the 2000s I have a new crush. And it's a sink. Sorry Scott. 

OMG...I think I just finished my 400th review! Cheers my yelpitas!

Every adjective you've heard about the Cosmopolitan is true. It's a chic, contemporary, opulent, decadent, lovely, lavish, romantic, artsy, naughty, and hip hotel located in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip with amazing panoramic views, a bevy of restaurants, and a very cool club in Marquee.

Olivia Z. and me stayed in a luxurious Terrace One Bedroom on the 62nd floor with an outdoor Private Terrace offering a magnificent panoramic view of the neon-lit Strip. The room featured separate king bed and living areas including a kitchenette. The bathroom had dual sinks, shower, and a wonderful Japanese Soaking Tub (that was an amazing way to unwind at the end of each day).

Stay in the East Tower if you want to be closer to the Strip, Restaurants, Marquee Day & Night Club, and Bars. It was very convenient for us. Since Cosmopolitan is next to Bellagio, many rooms (with up charge) offer a view of the Fountains or you can easily walk there to catch a few of the Fountain Shows. Another upgrade option is a Upgrade to a Wrap Around Terrace on a corner which was really promoted when we checked-in.

Resort Fees are $28 and include access to the Gym, Pool, and WiFi (2 devices only).

Self Parking is easy. If you are staying in the East Tower, be sure to drive all the way to the east side of the parking lot for convenience to your elevator. Also, note the shortcut entrance/exit from the east tower, too. Valet is easy, too. It is all done in the parking structure and very comfortable and convenient.

Wicked Buffet is over-rated, but ok. Holsteins, on the other hand, makes an amazing burger (The Risng Sun with Kobe-style Beef & add Fried Egg). Secret Pizza isn't a secret anymore. Comme Ca is a relaxing choice for happy hour. STK and Scarpetta are so-so for the higher prices.

The Cosmopolitan Las Vegas may not be a 5-star hotel or casino, but it is a convenient, chic, contemporary, lovely, romantic, artsy, naughty, and hip place to celebrate and have fun in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 42/100

I am HUGE lover of the city of Paris and anything related to it. My apartment is Paris-themed with Eiffel Towers, macarons, bonjour signs, etc. everywhere. I was disappointed that my boyfriend couldn't get us hotel reservations at the Paris Hotel, but after visiting it this past weekend, I was actually kinda glad that we didn't end up staying there.

This hotel looks beautiful on the outside. The huge Eiffel Tower, of course, is a smaller, fit-to-scale version of the real thing in Paris. The building with all of the rooms in it actually looks like many of the buildings in Paris. They also have the Arc de Triomphe which is quite a spectacle as well.

My bf and I came here to dine at Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant. Because of where we parked in the garage, we had to walk through a bit of the shops and restaurants to get to where Steak was located on the main casino floor. It feels as if you are roaming the streets of Europe, but nothing inside the whole shopping/restaurant area really screamed PARIS to me. It was just like European-esque, but not really Paris. Also, I felt kind of claustrophobic in there because although the Venetian and Caesars Palace have the same thing where you feel like you're walking in Europe and there's a fake sky ceiling above, I feel like the ones in Paris are much lower and it just felt...busy and stuffy. 

The smell from the restaurants was slightly nauseating. It gave me gross flashbacks of bad quality, overpriced Italian from Disneyland near Pirates of the Caribbean. That is super specific but it was not bringing back good memories for me. Kinda like the smell when you first start riding on Pirates and you pass by the Blue Bayou restaurant...hahaha.

Overall, this hotel just seems dated to me...and not really that big to accommodate large amounts of people. There was some sort of marketing convention going on while we were there, which made it even more busy and claustrophobic than usual. 

3 stars for a nice outer appearance, Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant, and having a good location on the strip!

I'm just not into this place anymore. I was so stoked when it was being built and even after it opened I was a weekly regular. With nearby options like Burger King and McDonald's, I was excited to have a place that would be different and have a variety of menu options. The online ordering is pretty much useless. I place my order online because it is supposed to be convenient yet I still end up most of the time waiting in my car and having to go inside and get my food only to find out it isn't even ready. I have no issues with going inside and ordering something and waiting for it, but when a place offers online ordering so that you don't have to do those things and cut down on wait time and can't get it right it becomes useless. Then when I finally get my food it is overcooked. This wasn't an issue when they first opened however maybe because they are expanding around town too fast consistency is an issue. This last time my Omelet was yet again crispy and brown (overcooked) and hubbys breakfast burrito tasted awful (we used to eat these a couple times a week) and the tortilla was hard and the pancakes had a burnt flavor. The potatoes that came with my breakfast were dry and clearly came from a frozen bag. A lot of people think this is a "healthy" only food establishment... Wrong! After too many failed attempts... I give up!

This place is awesome!  If you've never had a pasty, think of it as a huge empanada.  If you've never had an empanada, think of it as the biggest and best gourmet hot pocket ever...and maybe think about trying some new restaurants :)

Choices, choices, choices!!  So many fillings to try.  My wife got the Veggie Chicken Tikka Masala.  Their faux meat of choice is a British brand called Quorn.  It's not as firm as Gardein but blended really well with the curried sauce, potatoes, peppers and had great texture.  I got the Veggie Cottage Pie (Quorn vegetarian ground beef, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar. With a side of HP sauce.) that really hit the spot as it was savory and just got better bite after bite.  We also got to see the guys make a set of pasties by the bar and it looked as homemade as you could get.  

I'd say this would be an ideal place for lunch but you'd be seriously missing out on one major thing...their beer list!!  That is unless you can get away with being buzzed and having beer breath at work.  If that's the case, please PM me your work address so I can apply.  There are a ton of great beers from Joseph James to Chimay to a lot of British brands I have never heard of.  I got a beer that tasted like banana bread.  The bartender told me he didn't like it, my wife hated it, I loved it!!!

Then there's the whole atmosphere...really cool!  No video poker at the bar.  No TV anywhere!  The Cure and Sex Pistols blaring from the speakers.  Very refreshing!

In the ever evolving world of sandwiches, many claim to produce the best sandwich in the world.  Among the contenders are the likes of Capriotti's, Mendocino Farms, Which Wich? and many more. Among this iconic list of sandwich makers, there are droves of fans and haters alike.
But make no mistake, The Earl of Sandwich makes some of the most addictively good sandwiches i've enjoyed in a very long time! Tack on the competitive prices and it makes it even better! So it's safe to say i'm a fan when it comes to the Earl's cheap & tasty eats!


The Original with Roast Beef - 
The bread was excellent! As soon as I grabbed the warm bag in my hand, I knew I was in for a toasty treat!
The bread was perfectly crisp on the outside yet warm and fluffy on the inside. Not thick, bread-y, dry & spongy like most other places. The roast beef was piled high and it was juicy and full of mouthwatering flavor!

Jerk Chicken Sandwich
Filled with generous portions of chunk grilled chicken breast (not sandwich meat), red peppers and of course a good helping of zippy banana peppers, this zesty lil number was quite flavorful and surprisingly juicy (considering it was chicken breast!) but my favorite has to be the original for overall mmmmmm mmmm mm factor!

Dessert
Brownie Cream Sandwich
Imagine two chocalatey rich brownies sandwiching a decadent layer of sweet vanilla frosting...yup it's insanely rich and sweet! I advise you to purchase a glass of milk with this decadent number cuz you'll definitely need it!

Service was nifty & quick and they got us in and out in no time flat! Don't forget that all toppings are free with the exclusion of avocado, so pile it high if you so desire! And did I mention the prices? Only 6$ for a delicious hot sammie! That's a steal for a great sandwich on the strip I might add!

With that said, it's a no brainer...if you're out after the club looking for some awesome late nite eats or just strolling the strip, give EoS a try, you won't be disappointed!

Happy Eats!

Sprinkles is at The Linq (between the Flamingo and the Quad). Cupcakes are $3.75 each and an additional 50 cents if you want it in a box instead of a wax bag. They have more than one door. The left is cupcakes only while the right side is both cupcakes and ice cream. They have prices and flavors posted and only offer certain flavors on different days of the week. You can check their website or download the Sprinkles app to find out what flavors they have that day. 

I just went to the cupcake side on this visit, but plan on trying the ice cream in the future.  I ordered a "Doggie Cupcake" priced at $2.50 that is sugar-free and has a yogurt frosting. It had a cute little orange bone on top. My dog, Brownie loved it! She licked the top off first and then ate the rest. I had a "Lemon Meringue" that was very good. The lemon cake had graham cracker lining and delicious tasting lemon curd in the middle. The top had toasted marshmallow that was good, but had a chewy outer layer that was tough to eat, so that was all that was left of the cupcake I didn't finish. They have tables and chairs outside of the store. As I was sitting there eating my cupcake, Candace Nelson the founder of Sprinkles came outside to greet customers. She was very sweet and signed autographs and took pictures with people, including myself! They have a decent amount of tables and chairs outside, but they were pretty filled up and the inside of the store was busy yet the line moved along smoothly. 

There is a cupcake ATM outside (near the ice cream side) on the patio and it's open 24 hours. The cupcakes are still $3.75 each, but come boxed so you have to pay the extra 50 cents. Hubby had a strawberry cupcake that I tried a bite of and liked, so I got one of those from the cupcake ATM to see how it worked. The ATM is user friendly and the screen allows you to see your cupcake coming to you from inside the store to when the door lifts open on the ATM revealing a pink box. I thought it was cool and even though the store is open late, it is neat knowing you can get a Sprinkles cupcake at any hour. 

Hours:
Sunday - Wednesday 10 am to 12 am
Thursday - Saturday 10 am to 1 am

El Dorado Cantina is one of my favorite new restaurants in town.  This definitely rivals Javier's at Aria for the "high end" Vegas Mexican cuisine market, but the prices are way more reasonable.  Chef Paco and his staff are churning out some really good stuff.  

Want a great way to spice up a weekday dinner?  How about doing as the Aztecs did back in the day (century) and start off with some grasshoppers?  Yes, sir!  EDC's "chapulines" can be prepared sauted either in garlic lime or habanero.  For the uninitiated, the closest thing to compare them to would be crispy shrimp tails but juicier.  The habanero order offered terrific heat and not in a painful, shoot me in the face kind of way.  At $7.50, it was a large portion that could have easily satisfied a party of six.  Not for everyone by any means, my wife was literally one and done, but I enjoyed it and had plenty to take home (fried rice, anyone?).

"Imperial Shrimp" was everything I look for in an appetizer: seafood stuffed Pacific wild shrimp wrapped in bacon and then lightly fried. The creamy heat (sounds gross, right?) from the chipotle ranch dressing that accompanied the dish was awesome.  More things in life should be wrapped in bacon!  I should start a national campaign.

We chose to split the humungous carne asada entre.  The citrus marinated steak was medium rare perfection.  I loved the big slabs of grilled cactus that it came with.  We probably boxed up 70 percent of the plate.  Goddamn nachos and salsa....

You'd think that would prevent us from ordering dessert, but the flan and tres leches cake somehow made it to the table.  The latter was plated nicely and the rum flavor made me feel like I was on vacation.  It was a great end to the meal and I can't wait to try more.

Of all the changes over the years at the Boulevard Mall, this Cinnabon is still here! I was in the area and thought I'd pop in to see if it was still around since I hadn't enjoyed one of their tasty gems in years. This was the only place in the food court with a line and the smell coming from Cinnabon was wonderful. There was a lady rolling out dough and another quickly moving customers in line through. They had the usual classic Cinnabon and Minibon warm and ready to eat and some packaged for those who want to take some on the go. Priced at $13.99 I picked up a "Classic 4 Pack" for take home and priced at $3.99 an order of "Cinnabon Stix" (5 pc.) that came with a side of cream cheese frosting. Hubby and I munched on the stix during out ride home and didn't really like them as much as we hoped to. The stix needed more cinnamon sugar to be enjoyable in my opinion. The classic rolls I heated up for dessert later were very good! There was plenty of cinnamon and cream cheese frosting on them and they heated up nicely. 

I noticed something else on the menu called "Center of the Roll" which is nothing but centers from their classic rolls pilled together with cream cheese frosting. I know what I'm trying next time!

***Aria is very generic, but the rooms (especially the bigger ones) are comfortable and very nice; it also has a good location, but you really have to walk to get to The Strip***

Aria is one of the new very tall hotels at City Center in Las Vegas.  Here is a rundown on the pros and cons (a pleasant experience overall).

Pros:

--Nice rooms.  Contemporary, clean and comfortable.

--Location.  City Center is near a lot of the action (with casinos like Caesars and Bellagio closeby).

--Lots of places to eat in the hotel.

--Because of its newness, the smoke smell is less strong.  Still, I feel Bellagio and Wynn are better at clearing out the smoke.

--A different option.  Not as "theme-like" as other casinos.  This could be a pro or con depending on how you feel about those "theme-like" casinos, but at least it provides an option for those who are looking for something else.

--The interior/decor of the hotel/casino (like the rooms) are modern and sleek.

--The exterior is pleasant to look at and all glass (very similar to the Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott at LA Live).

Cons:

--While Aria is located on the Strip, it is a little bit of a walk to get down to the sidewalk to visit other casinos.  I like walking in Vegas, but this may be a con if you are not wearing comfortable shoes (or need to get somewhere quick by foot).

--The rooms are small.

--I think their rates are a little higher than other serviceable hotels nearby.

--I only tried one food place (Cafe Vettro) and it was not good.

--While this place is a different option, the lack of a theme or style gives the hotel kind of a too simple feel.  Once again, good or bad depending on your perspective.

I haven't stayed at many hotels in Vegas so it is hard for me to rank Aria, but my experience at Aria was pleasant overall.  Since Aria is near a lot of casinos I like, I would come back, but I would do so only if I got a good deal.

Note: They have little packaged accessories (such as an iPod auxiliary cable and charger) next to nuts and candies on the counter.  These are obviously things (expensive things) you can buy (like the minibar).  The items are weight sensored so if you pick one of them up, the hotel automatically charges your room.  So you lift it, you bought it.

They will take it off your credit card if you picked it up to just get a better look.

Trivia: Aria was featured on a recent episode of ABC's The Bachelorette.

From a master of seafood comes; well, nothing new.  And, it's a good thing.

Mina's flagship restaurant.  The dining space exudes a warm, contemporary elegance.  The excellent service, practiced and friendly.

Tip:  The restaurant offers a special vegetarian tasting menu, 

Tip:  Pass on the tasting menu and opt to order a la carte.  Larger, more complete portions and many signature dishes are not featured elsewhere.

To start, the caviar service.  Three types of osetra caviar are offered.  Opt for the least expensive (the preparation will mask the subtleties of the caviar).  Have it prepared as a parfait (a potato pancake topped with crme fraiche, cold smoked salmon and topped by a mound of caviar).  The nutty, yolky goodness of the caviar enhances the oceanic flavor of the salmon.  A shot of vodka pairs perfectly, striking the palate clean between luxurious bites.

Wanna give the perfect gift to your favorite sad, pitiful, unfortunate foodie from Cali?  "Whole Roasted Foie Gras".  Literally a foie roast, the entire foie is pan roasted and carved table side accompanied by a brioche pain perdu (custardy French toast), an assortment of pears including one sauted in brown butter, a sweet date puree with strong notes of cinnamon, allspice, and anise, sauced by a red wine reduction and dusted with foie powder.  Perfect flavor combination.  Well balanced richness. 

For mains, pass on steaks.  You can get them anywhere.  Focus on the sublime Maine Lobster Pot Pie; tender, juicy poached whole Maine lobster in a truffle lobster cream and root veg.  The phyllo crusted sole, perfectly cooked, perfect textural contrast of the phillo crust surrounding a moist, clean flavor of the sole.  The fish sits atop a rich crab brandade (crab mixed with potato and olive oil), the peppery essence of the olive oil adding complexity.  Both components are tied together by a tangy mustard sauce.  Finally the Miso glazed Chilean sea bass.  Simply put the best, most refined miso fish you've ever had.  Nuff said.

Outstanding wine list.  Typical Vegas resort prices

Tip:  Reservations for prime tables and times can be hard to come by.  Book a month in advance with open table.  Platinum and Noir mLife members book through the mLife site for a guaranteed table on short notice.

Simply put; worthy.

Lo-Lo's is a nice experience in southern cooking without leaving Phoenix. You can see why everyone raves about the place.

Three of us came here for breakfast last week and really enjoyed ourselves.  The only drawback was that we arrived at 8:15am. Yelp had the opening listed incorrectly as 7 am.  Lo-Lo's  OPENS AT 9 AM! I have posted a updated photo, with the correct times from the front door.

We ordered two coffees and a iced "fruit punch" Kool-Aid for $3.00 each to start. I had the #8 Betty Boop for $8.00. It comes with one piece of southern fried chicken breast, along with a plate covering waffle. It wasn't bad, but mine was a little mushy and didn't stand up well to the syrup. 

As for the chicken, I regret that it was somewhat dry and not juicy. The smashed sides of two sausage paddies for $2.00 was great and it had a nice flavor.  I would come back just for the smashed sausages and Kool-Aid anytime!

My two friends ordered the #14 CJ's, which is one waffle, one egg, and a small bowl of grits for only $6.00 (a steal); and the #11 Kimbo for $7.00, which is two giant waffles. My friend reported that his waffles were cooked longer and they looked golden brown. 

Spending some time in the south, I really miss having Grits. Oatmeal is not the same thing. The Grits at Lo-Lo's are very good. If you have never tried them before, Lo-Lo's would be a good introduction. But skip the cheese on top. The best I've ever enjoyed came with small pieces of bacon in it. Yum! Now, which way is the Mayo Clinic? LOL

Our bill for three including taxes, but before gratuities ran us $34.86. Overall the food and service was very good. I would say Three and Half Stars good, rounding up to Four.

In a city full of displaced Chicagoans longing for their beef, dogs, and deep dish it would seem odd to some that one of the most exciting Windy City imports to Sin City in years has arrived in the form of Japanese Street food but having been lucky enough to attend the soft opening this Saturday suffice it to say that Yusho is poised to buck the trend of "celebrity chef" Strip-side dining.  Owned by Matthias Merges and nothing short of stellar in its Avondale location where service, sourcing, and skills befitting his Michelin starred past found new footing in reinterpreted yakitori, a visit to Yusho at the Monte Carlo begins with the space, a jazzed up version of the original with a long floorplan plus eye-popping colors juxtaposing the gleaming open kitchen and with knowledgeable servers brought in from icons like Savoy and Robuchon without any pomp or pretense the 'experience' unfolds like few others - casually refined and a whole lot of fun, the kitchen and front of house doing each other justice even on day one.  Speaking to the cuisine itself, having already visited the original twice a few selections were made while allowing the kitchen carte blanche otherwise and beginning with pristine oysters each of the eleven courses that followed proved superlative, the signature 2xChicken as good as ever while eggplant, pork shoulder, and crispy duck served with bao all served notice that that Fat Choy is no longer the only game in town.  Surprised by the nutty, acid kissed octopus before being wowed by both the umami-laden wrapped Wagyu and a fluffy okonomiyaki serving up funk and heat tempered by fruit it was finally with a duo of desserts that we concluded and although the softserve remains a worthy staple it was the doughnuts that stole the show, an unexpected lightness from the tofu beneath sophisticated herbal notes and crystallized ginger, just barely sweet.  Admittedly a fan of Chef Merges dating back to a meal partly responsible for stoking my love of fine dining during his tenure at Charlie Trotter's only time will tell whether such a radical departure from the Vegas 'norm' will yield success, but with a great team already in place and a dynamic cocktail menu including several draught options alongside the sort of food this city has not yet seen I know I'll be back soon because whether for drinks, bites, or a full meal Yusho is the sort of restaurant Las Vegas Boulevard needs.

Everything is pretty small and served like tapas, but somehow its surprisingly filling.  There were definite highs and lows to this meal, but I think there were a few dishes that excelled while only a few weren't quite what we had hoped for.

There was a big group of us so I managed to sample quite a big portion of the menu.

Highlights:

Carnitas tacos-served with guac, pork rinds, and a verde sauce!

Like water for Chocolate- fried quail served with dragonfruit and edible flowers.  

Chilaquilles- tortilla chips cooked in a pan with a salsa verde and cheese.  Kinda like nachos.

Mango "sticky rice"- this is something quite interesting.  The sticky rice part was made into a mousse and ripe mangoes.  I've never seen this before and it was really cool.  The "rice" element were like rice crispies on top.  

Chocolate "terrain"- Awesome chocolate mold of a Chinese soldier with a spicy chocolate mousse inside.  It was served with cookie crumbs to look like sand, and a ginger ice cream that was spicy and sweet all at the same time.

Things to skip:

Oceans Nest- fried noodles served with stirfried saucy seafood and veggies.  We ate all the lobster out of it and then left it there.  It was super bland.

Lamb potstickers- pretty presentation with the little edible flowers and everything but it was bland and looked more exciting than it tasted.

Overall, I thought the place had a whimsy to it that I thought was fun.  The ambiance was interesting and diverting, the waitress and wait staff were helpful and went out of their way to see to our requests.  While some of the food is a bit overpriced and small, I really enjoyed their desserts, there is something light hearted and comical about them.  They were the highlight of the meal.  If nothing else, come and have dessert and a laugh all at the same time.

I attempted when they were in Henderson, but was a day late and a cup of shave ice short. They were apparently moving over to a spot in Chinatown (now open!) and I would have to wait a couple more weeks. While on a taco trek UYE last week I was told that SnowFlake Shavery would be added as one of our stops and was thrilled! This isn't ice cream and it isn't a sno-cone. I know there is a lot of confusion to what shave ice is and I am learning myself, but you wont find any artificial syrups here! If you haven't had it before, it is something you need to experience first hand. The appearance, texture and taste is something special. SnowFlake Shavery uses fresh and all natural ingredients. Flavors range from chocolate, vanilla, cantaloupe, mango, coconut, green tea, black sesame and depending on the season you might be lucky enough to try the banana! I missed out, but heard it was fantastic! 

Sizes: Regular ($3.49) Large ($4.75) Monster ($6.49)

Step 1 - Choose your flavor and size
Step 2 - Choose your toppings priced 50 cents each
Step 3 - Choose sauce priced at 25 cents each (first sauce is free) 

I ordered the "Ex-Straw-Binary" (regular) and it had strawberry snow, strawberries, strawberry sauce and I had them add chocolate sprinkles and extra strawberry condensed milk. The strawberry condensed milk is SO good! The shave ice is very light. The portions are big and even though the regular looks like something you wont be able to finish, give it a try because it wasn't filling at all to me. It was just refreshing and yummy. I will be back to try other flavors!

The employees are very friendly and willing to answer any questions you might have. If you aren't sure about a flavor just ask and they will give you a sample. Don't forget to ask for a rewards card because when you buy 10 you get one free!

I came across this place on yelp and wanted to check it out. We used to have some Hostess outlets in the NW part of town (since closed) that I liked and was hoping to find something similar to that in this place. I found much more than I expected! Walking in I was greeted by a friendly cashier who asked if I had been in before. When I told her I hadn't, she went over the different sections and said to ask if I had any questions. They mostly have Entenmann's, Oroweat, Thomas, Grandma Sycamore's and Sara Lee goods, but they also have other stuff like Bear Creek soup and Boboli pizza crusts. I got a loaf of Sun Maid cinnamon raisin bread for just $1.75 and Texas Toast for the same price. Bagels were $1.99 and I picked out some pizza crusts, english muffins and other pastries. The prices here are drastically lower compared to buying these items at the grocery store. Not even Walmart has a "rollback" like this! 

When I got to the register I was given a stamp card. You get a punch for every dollar you spend. Once the card is full you can get a free item by the brand listed on the card. For every $9 spent you also get to pick something free (changes everyday) from the premium section near the front door. I also received a $1 coupon to bring back towards my total purchase for a future visit and the cashier told me I can combine them! The $1 coupons can only be used during the month on them so make sure to pay attention to that. You get a $1 off coupon for every $8 you spend.The cashier said what is sold here isn't leftover stale stuff from the grocery stores like most people think. She says Bimbo is the largest bread supplier and the stuff sold here is leftovers, but fresh leftovers that grocery stores, etc. had no shelf room for. Nothing I purchased was past a "sell by" date and was soft and fresh. This bakery outlet isn't anywhere near where I live, but I work in the area once a week and will make a point to stop and load up on delicious savings.

For 20 something dollars, I could understand some of the 4/5-star reviews detailing brunch. But for $50 at dinner, it fell short.  I'm certain I didn't eat $50 worth of food, my fault for not eating everything!!!  If I tried a bite of everything they had, I would totally pass out from a food coma without really savoring and enjoying (that's why I'm a bad candidate for buffets).  Plus, we had seafood on our brains, wanting everything under sea, especially a variety of crab.  Failed!  All they had were snow crabs. I suppose AYCE lobster is out of the question for $50.  Stop being so unrealistic, Gigi!!!

I did like the shrimp cocktail shot glasses!  Very convenient, tasty and cool spin to a just pile of shrimp as I've seen at other buffets.  Bone marrow was another yummy treat, haven't seen that anywhere else.  I love bone marrow (and clogging my arteries)!! Gelato station was a nice touch.  No white chocolate covered strawberries, only dark chocolate!  Booo!!!  Prime rib was just ok.  Nothing else really caught my attention.  A few other complaints from my table were, not a wide variety and items like bread/pastry were stale and even hard.

Our server was friendly and attentive, I appreciated that.  Didn't appreciate the attitude from a worker at one of the stations. Too long to detail the incident, but I wasn't being out of line.

Will definitely opt for Bacchanal instead next time.

Recommendation:  Take it all off!  Get in the bed nude!  (Stop it.  I'll get back to this).

Note:  This review is for Aria Sky Suites, the hotel within the hotel.

One of only 83 Forbes Five Star and a AAA Five Diamond award winner, Aria Sky Suites is the pinnacle of "rentable"  Vegas experience (once again, stop it).  This is the home of the much talked about Sky Villas.

The experience begins with complimentary airport limo service.  Arrival through a gated, private entrance.  Extends to a private checkin where your daily news paper choices are noted, your personal itinerary discussed (if you used the concierge book shows and make dining reservations - best seats and impossible to get tables included) then  you are swept to your suite.

Suites and villas are contemporary with excellent finishes.   Yes, you will probably play with the kitchen faucet for five minutes before finally figuring out how to turn it on, another five staring at a 5'x5'x2' "cube" and wondering who would want to sit on that until you try it and yet another thirty trying to program your room kicking yourself for telling the bell man you could figure it out on your own.  In the end, high tech and comfortable.

Master bathrooms are massive.  Each bedroom has its own.  Marble and glass throughout, his and her vanities, separate area for the ladies to pretty themselves up, separate tub, steam shower, separate water closet with heated seat and washlet, and full walk in closet with a safe large enough for most full size notebooks..  That little zip-lock bag slowing you down at TSA?  Forget it.  All toiletries are provided.  Teeth too good for Colgate?  Contact the concierge and have whatever you want ordered to your suite.

No worrying about throwing used towels on the floor to be replaced.  If it's used it's changed (including your sheets), not once but twice daily with turndown service.   The bedtime chocolates are wonderful.

Friendly and professional service throughout with no air of snootiness. 

Suites start around $600 per night for high level mLife members.  Book through the mlife.com for the best rates.  You do need to pay the dreaded "resort fee" but for the budget conscious, there is a 24/7 private lounge that provide all the bottled water, juices, soda, coffee, tea, and fruits you want.

Oh yeah, the sleeping naked tip.  Just do it.  Sheets are softer and more inviting than any clothes you probably own.  Turn down the AC and enjoy the cocoon of comfort.

My Friday night plans fell through and wound up with my son and his boyfriend and we were starving I asked them if they were up to trying out a new Thai place that we haven't been to yet and they answered back quickly with a yes, let's go!

We got their around 8:45pm and the place was sort of emptied out, but it was perfect for us. I also noticed that I got a free Thai Tea for checking in on Yelp! How sweet is that!  

For starters we ordered the chicken satay, the chicken was delish and full of flavors, the peanut sauce was amazing! My son and I at the same time said we could bath in the peanut sauce it was that good! Apple doesn't fall far from the tree I guess. But that sauce is amazing! Love it! 

One ordered the Massaman Curry, mild and that dish looked so very yummy! He said it was delish too! The other one ordered the Chicken Pad Thai mild without bean sprouts and he loved it too!

I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai as well, but had my Thai hot baby, bring on the heat I say! I enjoyed the Pad Thai, the noodles where perfectly cooked, the chicken was very tender and so tasty! The pad Thai did come with tofu, which next time I know to have it without tofu but since it was already on my plate I went ahead and tried it out, and well it was flavorless and blubbery, like you would imagine a whale to be. It's not my thing, but I tried :) .

My son and I have a favorite little Thai place on the other end of Mesa that we love, but I think Thai Spices just might have knocked them out, can't wait to come back and try the pineapple fried rice of course with chicken!

What a great place for breakfast! BBD has a very warm, friendly, family feel to it. Cindi was our server and she is fantastic! She took the time to answer all our questions and never let my coffee cup go empty. The coffee by the way was delicious! The menu was on newspaper and there are stories also on it telling the (you are allowed to keep it) story of BBD and other stuff. Most of the food on the menu is made from scratch and it says you can customize your order any way that you like and if they can do it, they will.

I ordered from their "little less" menu which has smaller portions. It was still enough to fill me! For $6.99 I had 1 egg, 2 pieces of bacon, hash browns and sourdough toast. The egg was cooked just the way I ordered it, the bacon had great flavor, the hash browns were too tasty and the sourdough toast was great! Something simple as breakfast is easy to mess up, but they do it right here. I also ordered a "Bear Claw" priced at $4.49 however I was too stuffed from breakfast to tackle that big boy! Cindi packed it to-go for me and said to just pop it in the microwave for 25-30 seconds before I'm ready to eat it. She also said the bear claws are made at each location daily! That bear claw made for one mighty fine dessert :)

Lunch and dinner is also served here at BBD. I have no doubt it is probably tasty, but I'm sure this will me more of a breakfast spot for me since I enjoyed that so much.

Alot of things go into a fabulous experience at a club.

You need a fabulous space.

Fabulous people.

Fabulous prices.

And lots of fabulous space to bust out your fabulous moves.

Tao - was an impressive fabulous space, but the people and number of them crammed into one dance space (the downstairs area was much less crowded, but not much was happening) were short of fabulous, we couldn't score a seat unless we had ordered bottle service, and the price of entry for the guys in our group as well as the drinks once inside were far from fabulous.

So overall Tao was not the fabulous experience we had hoped over.

There were two creepy baths, boasting two naked women sitting in rose-petal water as we entered. Both women looked bored and unimpressed, and at the moment I knew our night at Tao was not looking up. The music was erratic Top 40 stuff, like most of the clubs in Las Vegas, and once we made our way to the second floor dance area, we were bombarded with throes of pushy girls. 

With no room to dance or move, we managed to squeeze our way into the VIP section and ended up partying the night away with some friendly Welsh guys, which helped the night pass a little smoother, but after about an hour and half we couldn't get out of Tao soon enough.

If you're OK not being able to bust out your fabulous booty shake move, cause you'll probably boot out five girls from the dance floor in one shake - you have so little room to move - then come here - you'll probably have a good time. 

But if crowds aren't your thing - ask the locals for a good club recommendation that night - and go there instead.

Trust..

I had an appearance at the Chandler Performing Arts Center across the street on Saturday, January 25th.  My wife and I decided to make a road trip out of it and had intended on arriving a couple of days early to visit with family and do some sightseeing. Since I used to live in Arizona, I wanted to show her around a bit.  Our reservation was for the two bedroom Presidential Suite.  We arrived in Chandler at 7:10 pm, after driving for nearly eight hours.  We pull up to the valet station, but there is no valet in sight.  We leave our car in front and go up to the check-in desk and ask about the valet/bell hop.  The gentleman behind the counter (I didn't get his name) informs us that the valet/bell hop service ends at 7pm and that we had "just missed it"  We then proceed to at least check in to our room. The gentleman tells us that the Presidential Suite is occupied. My wife and I were both in disbelief.  He said that the current occupant is there for two nights and we were scheduled to stay four nights, so we could move rooms once it's available.  To make up for the inconvenience, we were promised all sorts of comps including "free breakfast" coupons.  My wife and I were so livid and tired we just wanted to lay down.  All we requested is for our rooms to be adjoined.  While the hotel clerk was scrambling to find us rooms, another gentleman named Brandon recognized me and offered to take our bags to our room.  Once we arrived in our rooms, we discovered that our rooms were NOT adjoining.  The next morning, we were contacted by the front desk to alert us that the Presidential Suite was available, but it only had one bedroom.  The other room would be "close by"  We decided to just stay put in our original rooms.  At least they were next to each other and fortunately, the rooms are very nice.  Leading up to the night of my performance, I wanted to get my pants pressed. I called the front desk and I was told that there is no laundry service on the weekends. So, no valet or bell service after 7 and no laundry service on the weekends.  I have never heard of this!  I thought these were just standard hotel services.  I later get a knock on my door by a hotel employee delivering our "free breakfast" coupons.  I mention the "no laundry on weekends" policy and she confirmed it, but offered to press my pants for me.  Unfortunately, I didn't get her name  but I'm certain I got this service because she also recognized me.   Regardless of that, I did appreciate that.  

My wife and I decided to check out a day early, since we'd prefer to be home together instead of in separate rooms.  When we checked out we were given our room charges bill and there were no comps or free breakfasts.  Needless to say, if we ever return to Chandler, we will not be staying at the Crowne Plaza.

This review is for the deli.

I had been wanting to try this place and was surprised to find out they have a deli and restaurant! From the front of the building, the deli is on the right and the restaurant is on the left. 

I ordered a "Sicilian Sandwich" priced at $6.99 and a "Meatball Parmigiana Sandwich" also priced at $6.99 for hubby since he was lost looking at the bread loaves they had for sale. The girl behind the counter gave me a receipt and said I needed to pay the girl at the front. Heading towards the front I noticed some yummy looking desserts and decided to get a slice of "Pecan Cheesecake" priced at $4 per slice. Hubby picked out a focaccia loaf that cost $1.90 and we were set. 

The Sicilian sandwich was really good! It didn't look like there was much to it, but it packed a lot of flavor. Half way through our sandwiches, hubby and I decided to switch and the meatball sandwich was cheesy, delicious and something I would order again, but I liked mine better. I had the pecan cheesecake later for dessert and it was much better than other places around put out. The focaccia loaf however wasn't fresh. To be fair, we did come in just after 8 pm, so the bread was maybe baked earlier in the day, but they should mark the baked goods down after a certain point. I enjoyed the sandwiches and dessert enough to return! 

Inside was clean and the employees were very friendly and helpful.

Spoon is easily one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. For fine dining, I put them in the top five.
Been here four or five times now just to make sure I was not dreaming. But for sure this is a solid four stars and edging on five. A few subtle enhancements could tip the scale to 5.
Dcor is nice and trendy with several seating areas including a great bar.  Service includes John the top sommelier in the area, usually two hostesses, well-mannered servers and great bartenders. Service is prompt and a drink order results in libations within 5 minutes along with a choice of waters. There is a very ample selection of cocktails and wines by the bottle or glass.
I should mention there is a prompt and courteous valet service as another notch up the service pyramid.
Next the wonderful bread basket with warm selections of biscuits, awesome cornbread and ciabatta or some other artesian bread with sugar or honey butter to complement. We usually need a second basket as a testament.
The short menu is a design to keep choices interesting but not drone on, the ingredients fresh, the food delicious and it changes often enough to keep regulars coming back.
Seafood is my favorite here in appetizer and entre, but the soups and salads are fresh and outstanding as well. A very well enjoyed appetizer choice from the other night we had the 'bacon and eggs' appetizer which was seared pork belly, 5 minute egg (just right) sauted spinach, and hollandaise. Also we had the crispy duck confit which was a fabulous set of ingredients of crispy duck, 3 grain salad, Indian spices, goat cheese, cucumber yogurt, and toasted almonds. Almost sounds like decadence and just about was.
Around the tale we had the shellfish pappardelle; Alaskan black cod; cassoulet which interestingly was comprised of roasted pork, chicken sausage, duck confit, braised cannellini + cranberry beans, herbed bread crumbs, and farm egg. This was 'dryer' version of cassoulet a French peasants, style stew.
We have tried many other appetizers and entrees on our other visits and they all were as wonderful as these I mention here. All had the same complexity of ingredients, preparations, with flavors all overwhelmingly pleasing to the senses.

We are usually big fans of the foodie flavors that come out of Fox Concepts, but felt this one fell a little short for us.

True Food Kitchen is the brain-child of Dr. Andrew Weil and Sam Fox. Their two-fold mission is that every dish served must not only be delicious but must also promote the diner's well-being. Our palates were somewhat uninspired by the offerings

True Foods is also showcasing proper proportions and the benefits of an anti-inflammatory food pyramid diet of Dr Weil. The only problem is the menu prices need to go on a diet too.  Everything is tasty, but a tad pricey

Our introduction might have also been tempered by the amateurish hostess station, which seemed more interested in having a conversation with a girlfriend friend who stopped by, rather then sitting the customers.  We watched in amusement until our turn came. LOL  

Our server was a bit spacey too.  She was MIA for long stretches of time during our meal and was only bailed out by the other servers.

We tried the Spaghetti Squash (photo) with a "protein" of Chicken Sausage and the Teriyaki (photo) with a "protein" of chicken with brown rice. BTW, "protein" is True Kitchen's favorite add on noun.  

As for our meal, we found the squash was overwhelmed by it's spaghetti sauce, which was mildly spicy which we liked.  Though we really enjoyed the chicken sausage "protein".  As for the the Teriyaki it was somewhat bland and overwhelmed by the brown rice.  Hard to believe.  We did enjoy the Pomegranate Limeaide (photo) and the Honey Ice Teas.

Expect to pay around $30 per person, including one non alcoholic drink.  Our return factor is less than twenty percent.  Sorry.

SITEREP:
If you've been following along in the newspapers, Fox Restaurant Concepts made national headlines in February 2012, when PF Chang's acquired a 51 percent stake in True Foods after providing a initial $10 million in start up costs back in 2009.  http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2009/08/10/daily51.html
http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/morning_call/2012/02/pf-changs-buying-majority-stake-in.html

They are showcasing a cookbook from Dr. Weil and chef Michael Stebner which includes more than 125 original recipes.  On the menu you will find Spring Salad with Aged Provolone, Curried Cauliflower Soup, Corn-Ricotta Ravioli, Spicy Shrimp and Asian Noodles, Bison Umami Burgers, Chocolate Icebox Tart, and Pomegranate Martini and much more. 

They are hoping for a 50-restaurant rollout of the concept, over the next several years. The average 5,000 square feet True Foods space highlights the use of reclaimed wood and environmentally friendly materials, costing about $2.5 million and $3 million in each location.

Omakase!!
I'm a fan of Chef Nobu and I've been dreaming of dining at one of his restaurant some day. Well tonight was the night

I got a seat at the sushi bar. 
A great way to see the action up front and personal. 

I went with the Omakase (Chef's Choice)
13 cold dishes
3 hot dishes
Desserts

Here's the rundown:
Cold dishes:
Nobu Tako w/ Jalapeo Sauce - a great way to start things off. 

Toro Tartare - Wow, melts in your mouth goodness. 

Toro, Big Eye Tuna, Abalone, Tamago, Scallop w/ Fresh Pickled Ginger - this was the nigiri part of the meal. Every thing was great. Fresh, clean tasting sushi. Yum!!

Amaebi w/ Uni, Egg Custard & Snapper - the shrimp and Uni was ridiculously good. Egg custard was so creamy and tasty. The anapper had a yuzu sauce that was so good (and I don't usually like yuzu)

Xxx salad, Amberjack,  xxxxx - I didn't get the names on the last 3 cold dishes, but they were all good. 

Hot dishes. 
Grilled Diver Sea Scallop w/ Tomato Sauce & Chive Oil - Scallops were perfectly cooked, but that sauce was AMAZING!!

Wagyu Beef w/ Garlic Butter & Brussels Sprouts. OMG!  Melts in your mouth goodness. PERFECT!!

Ramen w/ Crab and Vinaigrette Broth. A nice dish to finish the meal. 

Dessert:
Sudachi Cream, Merengue, Hazelnut and Black Sesame Ice Cream - a Napoleon (sideways). That sudachi (Japanese Citrus) cream was delicious. Hazelnut provided the crunch. A thin chocolate sheet provided the sweetness. That black sesame ice cream is the BEST ice cream I've had in a long long time. It was creamy, not too sweet and the sesame flavor shines through. I highly recommend it. 

Service was SUPERB!
From start to finish, I was pampered. 

For me, one of my dining dreams come true and it lived up to everything I imagined it to be. 

My Rating:
5 Star Plus!! 
Try it for yourself and decide.

I have been to this restaurant on several occasions, including my most recent experiences with their brunch menu. The atmosphere was much more upbeat in the morning than their dinner hours. Facing the street was the open bar accompanied by the sunny patio. On this Sunday, the lazy sunshine was slowly triggering through its rustic interior. 

I highly recommend their Eggs Benedict ($13). My dish came with perfectly poached eggs, English muffin, hollandaise sauce, crispy potatoes, and smoked salmon. The thick cut smoked salmon was delicious and not too salty. The thick gooey hollandaise sauce added refinement to the fantastic doughy texture of the English muffin. There was great purpose, balance and distribution of flavors. The potatoes were lightly salted and quite addictive. It had all the elements I was looking for in a benedict. 

I also enjoyed the Fall Squash Risotto ($13) served with crispy pork belly, squash, parmesan, rosemary honey, and risotto. The pork belly was nicely marbled to provide a nice contrast to the perfectly executed risotto. I wished this dish could come with more squash to accompany the risotto, but otherwise it's a dish I'd order again.

The Farmer's Market Frittata ($10) was really fantastic too. It came with oyster mushrooms, asparagus, cheddar, arugula, tomato, and other seasonal vegetables layered on top of the omelet. The combination of veggies was fresh and the range of diverse flavors further complicated the omelet at the bottom. It's a lighter alternative than the benedict, but we still had plenty of leftover to take home.

The dishes that did not live up to my expectations were the Cinnamon Roll ($5) and the Iron Skillet Pancake ($8). The Cinnamon Roll was expensive but also humongous and good to share. It tasted dry, bread-like, and lacked the full on moisture that I prefer in a cinnamon roll. It's a novelty and highly visible at every table, but unfortunately not something I'll be ordering again. 

The Iron Skillet Pancake came with olive oil, dark chocolate, berry compote, whipped cream, and maple syrup. The price was too steep for a single pancake. The pancake was easy to cut into until the sticky crispy outer ring. The berry compote was overwhelming the dark chocolate, but it was still a decent pancake without the expected wow factor.

My dining companion did not enjoy the coffee, so it's not something I would recommend. Service can be inconsistent, but friendly and responsive when you have their attention. There's not a lot of innovative breakfast and brunch restaurants in the Phoenix area, so St. Francis is a solid option for those looking for conventional wisdom with a twist of refinement. The other downside to the experience was parking. They have a small lot, and the required valet can be frustrating as you wait for your car when it is parked right in front of you. 

With all considered, 3.5 stars for the overall experience. I'd be interested in coming back for dinner.

I gave away our card with 4 stamps at the end of the meal.  THAT'S how sure our group was that none of us would ever return.  

This isn't sushi in the Japanese sense.  These are crazy freakin rolls/inventions that contain some raw fish in, on or around them.  Calling this Japanese is very misleading.  The typical roll on the menu sounds like this:

"Tastes and smells like your bitchy ex-mother in law's 1st semester college sophomore roommate who did the whole lacrosse team on a dare and got Hepatitis C roll:  Baked inside out roll stuffed with eel, cream cheese, bbq sauce, avocado, super super super white tuna, chopped yellowtail and spicy tuna, shishito peppers, scallop, garlic and salmon on top with orgasm, yum yum, and fuck me in the ass sauce on the side."

As you can see, they used the whole "I Love Sushi" concept and took it way over the top.  This could be a potentially fun dinner (as many Yelp reviews can attest) trying all the insanity but there were enough misses to warrant my negativity.  It wasn't fun, but it sure was funny.  

- Sushi rice was off.  Slimy?  Low quality?  I don't know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.  I see a lot of reviews raving about sashimi though.
  
-Speaking of sauce...what's up with drenching sauce all over nigiri?  Several pieces of nigiri came with sauce on top as a default.  We actually had to request it without.  Freshness of the fish was ok.  None of us died afterwards.  

-Pretty sure that was shrimp cocktail drenched in a soy sauce base and topped with scallion advertised as amaebi. 

-1 order of green tea was not green but it might have been due to the lipstick contamination on the side of the cup.  The liquid was a very, very light brown.  The server claimed it was green tea despite my protest.  Magically, the next cup of tea was suddenly very green.  So that's where Dirk Arthur has been performing all this time!!

- I didn't know uni came in so many colors.  The most suspect pieces were left on the plate.  The server didn't even question it.  She just took them away like she knew.

- My native Japanese dinnermates found the tamago presentation to be hilarious.  A tamago house!

At least the unagi was good.  Congratulations on well cooked eel!  Have a good life.

If this is a new trend of having tasty steamed buns ("bao" if you read it in Cantonese) following a foot race I'm loving it!  

I had the pleasure of ordering and eating from this food truck (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/great-bao-las-vegas?select=IYXd86zCnkTdXHihCywYNg#RRkCwVYiUUhxC2gY4bScQA) back in December after participating in the Las Vegas Great Santa Run as it and another dozen or so food trucks were all lined up in the race assembly area ready to feed the nearly 10,000 Santas who turned out for the event.

The Great Bao truck was easily one of the more popular trucks with a steady line of people ordering food and another group waiting for their orders.  I waited too, but it was until the crowds diminished before I put in my order.  The menu was pretty simple (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/great-bao-las-vegas?select=IYXd86zCnkTdXHihCywYNg#nLQH80BQIF9oW2S7iGVl1g).  They basically had four types of steamed buns, bagged chips and refreshments.  The buns were pretty inexpensive at $3.50 each or 3 for $10.  The 3 bao combo also included a drink and a bag of chips!

I'm not sure what I was thinking when I placed an order for 2 buns instead of 3.  I didn't realize my mental breakdown until I had paid for my order.  Maybe it was the temporary meltdown of having run hard for a short distance race or maybe I was just wacky from seeing all that red from the people in Santa suits at every direction I turned.  Anyway, I ordered 1 Roast Duck bao and 1 Pork Belly bao and nothing else since I had collected an armful of race refreshments from other event sponsors.

By this time the staff had their routine down to perfection, and my made to order steamed buns (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/great-bao-las-vegas?select=IYXd86zCnkTdXHihCywYNg#Sd1ztJyGREFdt-vAbJi7ng) were ready lickety-split.

The Roast Duck bao was delicious.  The plum sauce was just sweet enough as to not overpower the taste of the roast duck, and I loved that they included a piece of green onion which reminded me of the Peking Duck and steamed clamshell buns we enjoy at Chinese banquets.  The piece of duck I had, however, was a bit dry and slightly burned as you can probably notice in the photo that I've posted.

I lucked out on the Pork Belly bao as they gave me a huge piece of pork belly with very little fat on it.  Even though there was a sauce, a smidgeon of what looked like minced pickled veggies and a sprig or two of fresh cilantro all I could really taste was the delicious pork belly and the subtle sweetness of the steamed bun.

This was my first experience with any Las Vegas food truck and I liked it ... a lot!

Happy Hour Review:

After two years, it's time for an update.  

We really like the Happy Hour at Tommy Bahama's. It's one of our ole standbys, along with Brio Tuscan Grill.  Tommy Bahama's works hard at that laid back, island feel. Downstairs you have a small bar and patio surrounded in a U-shape by the retail store.  The water misters actually do a great job and you wouldn't know its over 100 degrees outside. Really!  Upstairs they have an additional bar, with the main dinning area, along with some private rooms

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
As I mentioned there's a relaxed feel here.  Or, maybe it's their delicious and yummy Mojitos. The crowd is a mixture of all ages.  We had a few teenagers behind us, along with a few out of town'ers.  But it's really hard to categorize the group, except to say that everyone is usually laughing and having a good time.

MENU:
I've attached the  two sided HH menu(photo) along with the appetizers from the regular menu.  The food is very good. Some regular menu items can be pricey, like the salads that start at $16.00.  But, almost all of the HH food is $6.00. Our favorites are the Sirloin Sliders(photos) and the Fish Tacos, but everything is good.

SERVICE:
We have never had any problems with the service. You have your regular server, but everyone pitches in, and I don't mean when you put your credit card down.  Water glasses are refilled on a timely basis.  Inquiries are made about your food and if you are ready for the next item. Nice.

FOOD:
Their Small Plates menu has: Ahi Tuna Poke for $6.00; Fish Tacos for $6.00; Prime Burger Slider for $6.00; Edamane Hummus for $5.00; Crispy Plantains for $5.00; yummy Macadamia Goats Cheese for $5.00; also yummy Jerk Chicken Lolloipops for $5.00 and Candied Spiced Nuts for $5.00.  All delicious.

As for drinks, the Cocktails are $6.00 and include: Mai Tai, Mojito, Sangria, Margarita, and something called a Crazy Cuban and Spiced Hurricane. So you won't go thirsty here.

PRICES:
Our most recent bill came to $43.00 including taxes but not gratuities. But, it's usually in the $31.00 to $37.00 ranges with two drinks. This time we shared a salad and there was no upcharge for a second plate.

Enjoy!

I finally made it over to Pink Box Doughnuts to see what everyone has been raving about. I will say one thing, you cannot compare Pink Box to places like Dunkin' Donuts or Winchell's because they are simply different. After having Pink Box, I can't see ever going to one of those chains again when I can go to a locally owned shop and taste the love in each bite. These doughnuts are made from scratch daily.

They have the doughnuts broken down into 3 different types: classic, specialty and gourmet. The classic such as "Glazed" or "Buttermilk" are $1 each. The specialty doughnuts like the "Bavarian Creme" are $1.25 each and gourmet favorites like the "Fat Elvis" or "Date With A Nutty Pig" are $1.75 each. They have half and full dozen boxes (pink of course!) with prices ranging from $8.50 - $12.50 for those.

I saw on Facebook they were now selling "Cronuts" so of course I asked about those. They were sold out! I spoke with Lance behind the counter who said they had made Cronuts 3 times that day already. I went just after 11 am so apparently people are scrambling to try them. Not having tried the original from NYC, how can I really compare it though? I guess I just want to taste it and get some sort of idea what it might be like. I will try again! Lance says you can just call ahead and if they have the menu item you are looking for then they will hold it for you. 

So I decided that I needed to try the "Fat Elvis" after hearing about it and I am kicking myself for not trying this sooner. DELICIOUS! It is just flat out good! The Fat Elvis is topped with chocolate icing & a caramelized banana, and filled with a homemade peanut butter & banana filling. This doughnut had me feeling stingy since I didn't want to share a single bite with hubby, but I had to darn it!

The 'Apple Fritter" needs some work. The texture is perfect. It is soft and chewy inside, and crunchy on the outside where it needs to be. The thing that gets me is why it's called an apple fritter if there are no apples in it? I didn't bite into a single apple! Boo-Hoo!

When I saw a Doughnut with fruit loops on it I had to give it a try. I was told by a worker that this was called the "Fruit Loop Doughnut" and I get the fun concept, but it just doesn't work. The long glazed doughnut is really good, but the fruit loops they put on top just absorb the glaze they rest on so they are soggy and chewy. 

Last and certainly not least is the "Cinnamon Tornado" and I have to tell you, it lives up to the name. When I took the first bite it was like a tornado of instant flavor, and it seriously melted inside my mouth. Very yummy.

There was a sign out front that said they are now open 24 hours on weekends.

A new Ross yay! This makes me one happy girl :)

If you have been to Ross before then you wont find too much different about this one. They still claim to offer 20% - 60% off department store prices and and by what I saw they are doing just that. The fact that some find the brand name goods here "so last season" means nothing to me as long as the quality is good, I like it, the price is right and it's cute! I love that I can get such good quality items for less. 

The bedding area is a good friend of mine. If I want new sheets or pillows I always buy them at Ross. I picked up some sheets yesterday for $29.99 that retailed for over $100! I have bought this brand before in 2 others colors and love them so I was glad to come across them again. That is one thing about Ross, you might find something you love and go back and it's gone, or you go to another location and they have a completely different selection. 

The shoes are my favorite part about Ross! I can find shoes for every occasion at such great prices here! From flip-flops to high heels they have the cutest selection. It doesn't hurt that right now is "shoe week" so they were all marked down even more.

If you are looking for a new handbag or wallet then check here before heading anywhere else. I for years have bought my handbags and wallets from Ross and I feel much better about buying the same brand name handbag here over buying it at a major department store and paying more. They have a great selection at this location and even had the newer style of the one handbags I currently use so I snatched that baby up!

You will also find a good selection of women, men, kids and baby clothes. The one thing to keep an eye out for is clothes that might be ripped or stained. I find a lot of cute clothes I pick out might have a rip or odd color on it so I pay extra attention to make sure what I am buying looks new and good quality. 

You can also shop for stuff for the kitchen, jewelry, home decor etc. They have some really adorable kitchen decor. Gift cards are available in any amount between $10 - $250 and you can purchase them at the store or customize your own on their website. I will be here a lot!

Finally a solid option in my neck of the woods. I've never been to a Barro's Pizza until a few weeks ago when they opened up one a couple of miles from my house.

They have a spacious dining room with a self serve soda machine, including Diet Dr. Pepper, and one flat screen TV in one corner of the room. They might want to consider getting another TV. You order at the cashier and they bring your food to you. My wife and I go here when we don't feel like cooking.

Major kudos to Barro's Pizza for not price gouging on pasta like a lot of places. Seriously, I've been to casual restaurants that want to charge $10-$12 dollars for penne with meatballs. At Barro's, you can get a small plate for less than $4 dollars. And that's plenty to fill an adult up at lunch. I tried their Calzone for $8.95. It was okay, nothing to write home about. It included a couple of toppings. They certainly don't make the world's greatest pizza but it's decent and very economically priced. My wife loves the garlic bread, but it's a bit too garlicky for my taste. Note to management, start serving artichokes for pizza and don't chop those onions so small.

Most of the time my wife and I spend about $7-$12 dollars to eat here unless we order a pizza. They have sandwiches which I haven't tried yet. I am eating my way thru their entire menu so I'll eventually try all their offerings.

The owner of Primp and Blow, Melodi Harmon, left me with such a horrible taste in my mouth, I had to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, something I've never done before. Here are the problems I experienced with the services:

-When I booked my appointment for a facial, blowout and makeup application, I made it clear I needed to be done no later than 4:30 p.m. and also mentioned an Arizona Spa Girls special I was doing when I booked my appointment. The person who booked me gave no indication she wasn't aware of the special, and she told me to come in at a certain time so I'd for sure be gone by 4:30 p.m. since I had dinner reservations. The makeup artist was late, so the facialist graciously started applying my makeup for me, even though she wasn't who I was booked with.

-When I checked out, right at 4:30 p.m. when I was supposed to have been gone by, the guy at the desk ran my card incorrectly twice and supposedly refunded the purchase--the third time it was ran, it was locked out because Bank of America froze it for fraud because it was run so many times in a row. Also, the owner, Melodi, (who called another Yelp user a pig in an e-mail---not surprising) puzzledly asked me at the desk about whether I was sure about the special--something that was not only insulting to me but also showed her lack of customer service and communication with the organizations she deals with. She said she'd e-mail me a receipt and get payment later, since I was late and my card was now frozen. I was unable to use my card the rest of the night and the next morning and had to rely on my friends to pay for me. I then had to spend more than a half-hour talking to Bank of America to unfreeze it.

-After saying she'd e-mail me a receipt that weekend (and telling me in a phone message that she had e-mailed it twice more), Melodi then called me and told me I needed to call my bank again to ask about the charge. I e-mailed her a screenshot of the statement from Bank of America showing there was still a pending charge from her, which my bank said she simply needed to push through. I spent another half-hour talking to them about this, being placed on hold, being transferred, etc. I spent more time combing through more than 1,200 spam messages in my Gmail to find the supposed three receipts Melodi sent me--nothing came up, and when I called her about this, she had someone at the front desk call me to get my "correct" e-mail--she had never sent me a receipt like she said.

-I tried to explain to Melodi that the time I had spent trying to fix the problems she caused (maybe 3 hours or more) made me feel like it was unfair to pay for the services I received. I would pay for my Clarisonic facial brush I bought once I got a correct receipt. She e-mailed me two more incorrect receipts, showing her lack of conscientiousness and unawareness in general. She then threatened to call the police and press charges against me for stealing--though the whole reason why I didn't want to give her my credit card info again is obvious (I didn't want her to freeze it again), and I wanted to know the correct amount of cash to bring to the salon.

I support local businesses immensely and would never steal from one. Her unwillingness to remedy the situation demonstrates her cluelessness as a business owner. I'm disappointed because of her inept ability to deal with customers effectively.

UPDATE: Primp and Blow posted this on their Facebook page. They don't care about Yelp users.

"We just needed you to pay for the stuff you took and the services you had. It has been over a month. Did you really think you could get away with not paying? It was sad that it took me threatening to call the POLICE on you to get you to pay! Thanks for paying it was the right thing to do. :-) Who cares about yelp!I I do not. ;-)"

One often hears a rendition of the famous adage to enjoy the journey rather than to rush through it, and this is one prime example of such great advice.
We were intrigued by the 1000 plus reviews for Bouchon, so our aim was to dine at this establishment for brunch.  However, i couldn't muster any more energy to walk that extra 10 minutes through the windy Venetian Hotel, so we ended up at Postrio instead.  MUST.EAT. NOW.  lol.  this was an amazing gem with prime real estate seating.  

LUNCH FARE: 

RICOTTA GNOCCHI with Sweet Fennel Sausage Bolognese ($25)
a soft ballad of flavors dance together with each bite.  so soft with potatoes oozing out.  each bite was outstanding and just the perfect portion.

TRIO OF HOUSE MADE SAUSAGES ($16)
Housemade Mustard, Pickled Vegetables, Grilled Country Bread, Baby Mache.  
yes, appetizer portion, but i knew i had to save room for dessert.  my ideal type of meal is usually 60% protein, 30% veggies, and 10% carbs, and this dish delivers exactly that.  executed so well, each bite was heavenly.  the sausage on the far right had pistachios, so pistachio lovers -- make note.  the fuchsia looking vegetable adjacent to the pistachio sausage is actually pickled watermelon.   it's not the typical watermelon that one would purchase at the local market.  this type of melon had the tight texture & consistency of a daikon or a radish, yet it was a watermelon.  

CHOCOLATE MELTING BEIGNETS were fabulous! ($12)
the chocolate beignets were oozing with warm chocolate filling and dusted with powdered sugar.  one proper spoonful of ice cream  was the perfect complement to the warm beignet.  the vanilla dipping sauce was just an icing to the dish -- it was great, but not necessary, but definitely did not hurt it at all.  for a dessert, everything was "not too sweet" either, which is always perfect in my books. 

for Mimi L,  they carry Banoffee, which is a banana & toffee cream pie ($9).  Other delectable treats include chocolate cream pie ($9), warm apple pie ($9), lemon cheesecake ($10), chocolate souffle ($12), and housemade ice cream or sorbet ($8)

****

SERVICE was impeccable.  Our server, Luigi, was nothing short of accommodating and awesome.  the pseudo "outdoor" seating gave us a great glimpse of St Mark's Square, where performers entertain passerbys.  the festive atmosphere and costume of the performers really enhances the "Venetian" feel.

lastly, love how the manager emails me personally to welcome me back to the restaurant.  i had received a similar email from Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill at MGM Grand.  great personal touch.  definitely worthy of 5 stars =)  Mr. Puck, i'm starting to become a fan of yours.

Many Las Vegans have declared that pursuing authentic Taiwanese food in this town is like finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. My ever-growing curiosity in this uniquely ethnic cuisine, as well as guidance from people who are knowledgeable about this food has led me to Noodle Pot. I can say, without a shadow of doubt, that this establishment has superseded  my expectations!

Following a brief stop at the Shavery, I ran into Will (a.k.a. the artist formerly known as SnowFlake), along with a couple of Yelper's, and we decided to go to Noodle Pot. I have driven past this joint many times without thinking twice to stop in. It was a startling revelation to learn that, according to Will, Noodle Pot has some truly legitimate  Taiwanese grub in Vegas. Most notably, I wanted to try the national dish of Taiwan, spicy beef noodle soup.

I admire extraordinary mom-and-pop, hole-in-the-wall resto's, and Noodle Pot fits the bill to a tee. The comfortable yet lively vibe keeps the interaction going. After the server sat us down, we ordered some appetizers along with the spicy beef noodle soup.

Cold Vegetable Appetizer Plate - The first time I ordered this it came with pickled cucumbers and other vegetables, and wheat gluten. The cucumbers were marvelous, with the correct amount of saltiness to harmonize with the sweetness used in the sauce. The wheat gluten was another smash hit. It tasted incredibly akin to a concoction of beef and chicken. 

(Note: Coming here on a separate visit, and ordering this dish again, they had replaced the wheat gluten with soy sauce hard-boiled eggs. I notably did not enjoy them, and I was not too confident to which tree the egg grows on, but that's just me ((hehe)).

Pork and Chive Dumplings - Another sublime feature! The dumpling wrappers tasted hand made, and the filling inside was outstanding with perfectly tender pork matching the bright flavor of the chives. The vinegary soy sauce dip was the icing on the cake.

Beef Roll - My least favorite item, but pretty splendid nonetheless. Slices of beef and cilantro wrapped around a thin crepe. I actually prefer other Chinese versions that use a thicker, flakier scallion pancake in which the inside is coated with hoisin sauce. But, it was delish.

Spicy Beef Noodle Soup - the "Pice de rsistance" to our meal. We opted for the wide noodles instead of the regular noodles (think of it as thicker version of pappardelle). The noodles were perceived as if they were hand made and hand pulled, even though they probably came from a special noodle factory. The broth was nuts! It was packed with beef flavor, but exceptionally delicate. Hints of tomato added depth. Large portions of tender beef dotted the soup. Also, if the server has not brought out the chopped pickled cilantro, ask for it. That combined with the baby bok choy in the soup will give the dish a marvelous variation!

Many have mentioned this before, but I will proclaim it again. CASH ONLY!!! Save the plastic for the surgeon's table! :D

(Another side note: I took my brother here when he visited and at the time they had run out of beef so we opted for the Spicy Beef Tendon Soup. Even though I was fine, my brother returned home and had the hershey squirts for the next few days. The soup comes with a tremendous amount of tendons, so if you are not used to eating lots of offal or weird animal bits, I would be cautious when ordering this version).

I recently stayed here for a bachelor party. The hotel lobby was decked out with sick flat screen columns that looked like wall paper, but changed throughout the day. The check-in counters used iPads (with a stylus?!?), though it seemed like a fairly frivolous addition. 

Service at this relatively new hotel was extremely rough. We had a block of rooms reserved together before we arrived, however at check-in that information was lost and people were checked into rooms all over the place. The staff worked hard to get us rooms in the same tower at least and ended up comping us each for one night and giving us half off the second night (a few of us were stuck room-less for 3 hours). In addition to the check-in mishap there was a "cleaning" problem in one of the rooms. I won't get into the details, but it needed immediate attention, which unfortunately had to be requested multiple times. Also on Sunday morning I ordered room service that never arrived, when I called to check on it they suggested I go to the buffet instead.

My suite had a great view of the Bellagio fountain. Decor was attractive and it felt spacious enough for one. The bachelor got a massive bungalow (he was majorly upgraded due to our many service issues). It had a private entrance to the hot new club: Marquee as well as 3 floors, views of the club, and an outdoor hot tub. Unfortunately the lack of sound insulation meant he couldn't sleep until the music stopped (after 5am). Also the fancy stereo system wasn't working on the main floor so we couldn't pipe in any music. Furnishings in the bungalow (like the couch) seemed designed more for ease of cleaning than style.

While it's a cool looking hotel for now, I suspect the heavy use of technology means it won't look or feel modern for all that long unless they have a big budget for frequent upgrades. In my mind... Encore remains the Vegas champ.

I had been wanting to give this place a try for sometime now. The location on Eastern is 5 star all the way, but the same vibe isn't felt at this location for me. The menu board above the register is painful to look at because it's awkwardly hanging. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu and checking on us while eating. I ordered a "Pizza Puff" combo priced at $4.50 plus 50 cents each for the addition of chili and cheese to the fries, onions were free. The pizza puff had cheese, sausage and sauce inside. It did taste ok. It reminded me of something you got for school lunch when you were younger, but in a very slightly better way. The basket of chili cheese fries is over $4 alone, so upgrading your combo with the addition of chili and cheese for just a buck makes it cheaper for the same size. The fries were good and the onions very fresh. The chili was not god though. I have had canned chili that tasted better. The basket of fries was a huge amount, but I really didn't eat but a few bites and then just couldn't eat anymore so a lot was wasted. I'd give the food here a 2 star rating alone, but I'm factoring service and cleanliness inside, so 3 stars seems fair. They do have some seating outside with umbrellas on the tables for shade. There is a bar with maybe 6-ish stools to sit at or you can sit at a table, but the tables are small (most seat 2 people) and if you get stuck sitting along the back hall area it can feel cramped. Currently on Tuesdays they offer wings for 50 cents each.

I decided to check out Commonwealth for its opening weekend and I'm glad I did- this place is amazing!  Located in Fremont East right next to Le Thai, locals have another bar they can hop to during the course of the evening.

Get your ass inside and find a beautiful, expansive space with plenty of seating.  Admire the art and lighting while enjoying a craft beer or fancy cocktail.  Or, better yet, admire the beautiful bartenders pouring your drinks.  I was thoroughly digging on the boys in suspenders.

There is also an outdoor patio area upstairs if you want to smoke or enjoy the view of Downtown.  I believe there is another bar up there as well.

To get an idea for drink prices, my husband ordered a draft beer (Alley Cat Amber, which was really good) and I had a well drink.  They came out to be about $7 a piece.  Someone next to us ordered a sidecar (that looked yummy) and theirs was $9.

The crowd was diverse and included hipsters, cool kids, and quite a few guys dressed in suits.  Everyone was friendly and enjoying their time at Commonwealth.  Someone even bought the bar a round of shots (before it got too crowded, of course).  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the crowd stays the way it is and doesn't get overrun with bros.

We got in around 9:00 or 9:30 (on a Saturday) and it wasn't too busy and we were able to find a seat at the bar.  An hour later, however, was a completely different story.  There were wall-to-wall people and standing room only.  Depending on if you want to just chill or you're out to mingle, you should keep this in mind.

What made me fall in love with this place so much?  Was it the gorgeous atmosphere?  Was it the friendly crowd and staff?  Was it because they stole my iPod to create their music playlist?  Maybe it was just the cute boys in suspenders?  Well, whatever it was made me fall pretty hard for Commonwealth and I'm anxiously awaiting our next date.

With the exception of a check-in snafu caused by the very "green" & inexperieced hostess, I'd have to say I had a pretty good experience at the tea lounge at the Mandarin Oriental.  I just have one point of advice, check your reservation with the hostess at least three times. By then, it may sink in for her.

Ok, let's carry on shall we?

Located adjacent to registration above the 23rd floor, you'd think the Tea Lounge was part of the lobby. But make no mistake, these premium seats come at a lofty price tag and a reservation to boot.  

Luckily, we were seated by the panoramic window as I requested and service, albeit a bit slow, was paced nicely and lent to the whole relaxing afternoon tea experience.  With that in mind, the tea selection was fairly limited but adequate for my needs. There were a host of green teas and herbal teas to accommodate most individual preferences and tastes IMO. Since I just arrived from a massage session, I went with the introspective herbal relaxation tea. The tea service runs from 2-5 pm daily and reservations are highly recommended as there are only a few tables in the lounge.  The views can be quite spectacular if you're seated by the window. We had a perfect view of the strip and City Center and the natural lighting was equally relaxing and calming.  

The food selections included a selection of finger sandwiches inspired by English afternoon "high tea" traditions, but where was the cucumber cream cheese?
In any case, the selections included a savory smoked salmon cucumber and watercress spread sandwich (my favorite of the bunch) egg salad & chives on brioche, curried chicken salad, and black forest ham. The tea service also included the best scones I've ever had in my life! These were buttery, light, flaky and irresistibly good. They came out nice and warm, served with some fresh berry jam, marmalade and an imported Devonshire clotted cream (extremely smooth and very addictive.) So addictive, in fact,  I found myself wanting to spread it on practically everything!  
Lastly, our afternoon tea service was completed with a selection of small bite sized desserts and pastries, which included macarons, tarts and chocolates.

By the end of the meal, I felt nicely sated and totally relaxed. I would definitely return on my next trip to Vegas but im going to have to put that hostess on check!

Happy Eats!

The decor for this place was definitely the best part. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f1eeViD_rhRG4-MIFgZsEA

It was a nice day so we got seated on the terrace overlooking the Vegas strip.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=FR6MuipnPqtxwIo9BUVZHA

There are some hotties working up in here.  I kept drooling over one of the waiters.  He was Asian, built, slight scruff, and had tattoos on his right arm.  I wanted to order him and take him to go but he wasn't on the menu :(

Order:  Crab cake, mac and cheese, pomme frites, Croque madame, and shrimp cocktail.  For dessert we ordered the caramel tart and the chocolate terrine.  

Crab cake came served with a remoulade and topped with a frisee salad.  It was actually pretty good, nice and meaty with large chunks of crab, yet it was still crispy and held up.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=p_zZ9eP10crf4OoTMMPw-w

Shrimp Cocktail came with huge jumbo shrimp.  I'm not a big cold shrimp fan so it was just okay for me.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f0eXikNX8SVFSiTNYpvs2Q

Croque Madame is basically a ham and cheese sandwich topped with an egg.  I wouldn't order it.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=hz67b-rY5NF_D8MfoFhpyw

Mac and Cheese came out awesome looking, but upon further tasting it fell pretty flat.  It needed something to lighten it up and give it some flavor.  My friend squeezed some lemon on it and she said it made it a lot better.  They need to work out that recipe and give it some ooomph!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=xWVNfswLh_diFTC__WeVMg

The chocolate terrine was too dark for me.  I normally enjoy dark chocolate but this was a tad too bitter for me.  It just tasted like straight up cocoa powder.  I wouldn't order it again.

The caramel tart was really good, but the crust was super stiff and thick which normally I like :)  but not in a dessert.  Flavor-wise though, it was the better of the two.  It came with caramel ice cream and candied macadamian nuts and wafers.

The waiter was cordial and accommodating.  He was telling us about life in Vegas because I was thinking about applying to schools there.  Overall, it was a nice relaxing meal.  There were highs and lows but pretty solid still.

Vegas local, here. I live at MGM/Signature.

SLS is at the very last Monorail stop at the far north end of the strip where the old Sahara hotel used to be. SLS definitely isn't 'ghetto'. I try to reserve that word for hotels like The Stratosphere and Circus Circus that truly are low-class, both inside and out. But let's just say the SLS is underwhelming. You can probably skip this place on your next Vegas trip.

The whole establishment gave me a really negative feeling inside. I'm not a New Ager so I don't really buy into the idea of positive and negative "vibes" or "energies"... but I've gotta say, something felt off about the place. Other things just left me scratching my head.

One of the head scratchers is the hotel's theme. What's their target demographic? Who are they trying to appeal to? They had a Pancake Griddle in there with a line of senior citizens out the door. The wait time must've been two hours or more. But then adjacent to that, they're trying to promote a nightclub. I can easily envision a late evening scenario where the long lines of seniors (some with walkers, wheelchairs, etc.) who are waiting to eat at one of the restaurants gradually gets intertwined with the twenty-somethings waiting for the nightclub. Seems like that could be awkward.

The floor in one area of the hotel was covered with what appeared to be fur or hair. I suspect there were farm animals in the hotel at one point. But why?

The part that bothered me the most though was the massive, rather intimidating security presence on the casino floor. Felt like I was in Ferguson, MO. or something. I took out my iPhone to video one of the restaurants that I thought had a really interesting decor, thinking I'd post it on my Facebook -- but within seconds, one of the guards approached me and said that no photographs or videos were permitted in the hotel. The dude wasn't messing around and I'm not exactly an alpha male who's prone to challenging people, so I quietly complied and then subsequently deleted the video.

He was professional and respectful to me and went out of his way to let me know why no photos are allowed: "because of 9/11". Really? Because of 9/11? I was tempted to give him a "What'choo' talking' 'bout, Willis?" because every other strip location I've visited seems to have no prohibitions on videos/photos (unless you're trying to video a card game, etc.) -- but whatever.

Anyway, I kind of feel like the SLS views all of their patrons as suspects or potential threats. I hightailed it out of there and likely won't return. The whole thing makes me realize how important it is for me to stay in my "safe zone": Caesars, Mirage, Aria, Cosmo, Mandalay, Fashion Show Mall, and of course my home base at MGM. People seem to like me at those places and value my business (or at least they do a good job of faking it) but man, if I stray a bit too far north, it's downright hostile! 

My recommendation is to skip SLS. So many great hotels in this town. No need to waste your time here.

Where to even BEGIN my review of this DUMP and the MINDLESS, BRAINWASHED, FOOLS who wait in line to catch a glimpse of NOTHING inside is the question.  

Not since "Pink's Hot Dogs" in Los Angeles, have I seen such a ridiculously long line of mindless, brainwashed, DONKEYS waiting to be disappointed!  Fools from all over the world who actually BELIEVE what they see on TV and are easily manipulated into thinking they are in for a treat by standing in line with other MORONS just like them!  Well let me pull the curtain back for all who are planning on coming to Las Vegas and hoping to catch a glimpse of the Pawn Stars cast members and believe they will be walking into a nice clean business that is filled with unique treasures and valuable items they have seen on TV.  After waiting in line for hours, and the curtain is finally pulled back, one will see NOTHING they are expecting!  And are sure to be disappointed!  But one will of course piss their money away on cheap souvenirs before walking out.....IDIOTS!

No cast members work here anymore (Except for shoot days), the place is a DUMP with S#@T for sale just thrown into their dirty display cases with no effort for neatness (Just as any educated person would expect from a pawn shop) but perhaps the best gag of all is the fact that this rat hole makes more money off selling their merchandising items to mindless tourists then by buying and selling items shown on Pawn Stars.  Some of the WORST merchandising items ever created from a TV series (i.e. cast member bobble heads, lame coins w/cast members faces on the, cheap low quality T-Shirts, and various other garbage that sophisticated people would never even consider buying!) P.T. Barnum said it best....."There is a sucker born every minute, and two to take 'em".....in this case, four to take 'em!!!!

Good luck trying to call these clowns, they NEVER answer the phones....not even sure why they still have phone lines, a waste of money if you ask me.  I tried calling them several times due to a rare poster I saw on the show that I wanted to buy.  Guess they are no longer in business to sell items (Except for their TV branded merchandise)

The donkey selling hot dogs outside to the brainwashed crowd, while it is a genius idea to take even further advantage of the long line of fools, I believe the cart is owned by a relative of the pawn shop owner (Go figure)  They also claim to sell "Vienna" hot dogs, which anyone that has been to Chicago knows, are the BEST dogs in the world.  But I highly doubt they are Vienna, my guess is they are Ball Park dogs bought in bulk at Costco and are only being passed off as authentic Vienna dogs.  The Vienna brand umbrella that is displayed above the cart was most likely pawned for pennies on the dollar from a customer years ago.  

Most of you, if not all of you reading this will most likely NOT take my advice of saving you time, money, and your high expectations, and will venture into the long line of waiting SUCKERS anyway.  While it is not my goal to UNBRAINWASH you, it is my goal to pull back the curtain and let you know in advance what to expect when you arrive at this DUMP with the rest of the donkeys.  

While I can't fault the owners of Gold & Silver Pawn for profiting off the success of their hit television show, I can fault them for poor customer service.  Not only do they NOT answer the phones, they also do not list any items of interest that were bough on the show, on their website.  However one can CERTAINLY buy their merchandising GARBAGE online!  It is clear Gold & Silver Pawn is no longer in the pawn business, they are in the retail business of selling themselves.  The only question left is.....how long will it last? Enjoy!

FOIE GRAS...F-orget O-ther I-nsignificant E-xperiences G-et R-eady (for an) A-mazing S-andwich at Goodwich.
That is what possessed me to drive from Henderson to Downtown with a growling stomach looking for a unique lunch and not settle for everyday boring because my usual lunch date has stomach issues.
I get to this little shack around 12pm with normal looking people standing in line...not a weird downtown crowd at all. I didn't know what everyone meant by "OG"...until I looked across the street and saw OG Topless Bar (good landmark)...maybe where the bad witch lives lol.
I walked up to order looking at the simple menu (with descriptions of ingredients, yay) knowing I was going to try the much talked about "Foie" even though I had a lot of apprehension from never having eaten foie gras in my life. I was bewitched by all the positive descriptions everyone posted about this sandwich that I had to have it...good, bad or otherwise I was going to try foie gras today. The gentleman who took my order was very reassuring that it would be a treat for me and that at $9, it was a great way for me to try it and not break the bank. I found an empty chair to eat that made me feel like I was a young student at school having my favorite sandwich at lunch.
As you can already tell, I LOVED it! Such a strange combination to put together but it all works. Foie gras mousse/terrine that had a creamy texture with light earthy, almost truffle-like hints (not at all gamey), this very crispy thick chicken skin (like when you hit the crispy skin jackpot on a perfectly roasted chicken), chopped almonds, and pickled purple cabbage that made sense as a necessity to cut the richness of the foie gras, all inside a grilled crunchy white bread that scrapes the inside of your mouth a little. Creamy, crunchy, savory...I couldn't believe this taste explosion that I enjoyed with each bite to the last. Oh yes. I finished the whole thing! I was really blown away how
 much I enjoyed this sandwich. It was life changing lol. It would be wonderful to see Goodwich occupy a space in the upcoming Galaxy Market in the Arts District...a space for artisanal foods, craft brews and aspiring restauranteurs.

Okay, I've been beaten into submission. Yes, you can enjoy a wonderful dining experience in a restaurant that serves only buffet.  Jasmine Tokyo is that place!

Our merry little group included ring leader, buffet master extraordinaire Rand H, along with Robyn N, Mike C and myself.  As noted elsewhere, Jasmine Tokyo is located in the old Claim Jumpers space, near the corner of 70th Street on Shea.  

Both the exterior and interior hasn't changed that much either.  The only difference you'll notice are the huge buffet stations that run down the middle of the restaurant.  On the right side, as you come in, they've re-positioned the bar to the back and added a huge sushi station. I have posted a zillion pictures online.

The food was extraordinary.  It wouldn't have been better, if it was prepared individually in the back.  Everything was fresh and served in smaller, more manageable portions.  This is one of those restaurants (buffets) where you can only take a small amount of food on you plate, because you want the opportunity to try everything.  According to Rand, they have nearly 130 different choices, including eight different gourmet ice creams.  The ice cream by the way, is the only food item that is served to you upon request.

My bill was $11.99 before taxes, less a "20% Yelp Discount" that came to $10.66 including taxes, but before tip,  Our server Mirian F was outstanding and always there refilling our glasses or cleaning our table.  Very nice.

Enjoy!

Level 107 Lounge is on the 107th floor of the Stratosphere Tower. That's the best thing ... and worst thing ... about Level 107 Lounge. The bar is great because it's near the top of the tallest tower in Las Vegas offering a vast 360 view of the city and dessert ... while it's bad because the Lounge is in the subpar Stratosphere. 

It earns 3-4 stars for a pair of reasons.

** Reason #1: Free
You can ride the elevator up to level 107 without purchasing a ticket to the top. Why pay $$ to go to the observation deck on level 109 when you can go to level 107 for free? The Lounge is close to the center of the tower and you can't get next to the windows, but the view is the same Vegas.

** Reason #2: Happy Hour BOGO
Happy Hour occurs twice per day at Level 107 and serves a limited selection of "signature" cocktails 2-for-1. Early Happy Hour is 4:00 - 7:00 pm and (really) Late Happy Hour is 1:00 - 4:00 am. Each cocktail is $15 and both must be the same. The 10 cocktails available for the special include Lemon Drop, Blue-tini, Cosmic Cucumber, Chocolate Masterpiece, Last Tango, Mango Madness, Summer Mint Margarita, Razz Jito, White Peach Margarita, and Summer Sangria. You can also get some appetizers for half price during the early happy hour.

My wife and I popped in for some happy hour drinks and to catch sunset. It was easy to get to the top and even easier to order. To see the LV Strip, sit on the side with the Bar. We chose $15 Chocolate Masterpieces with Van Gogh Chocolate Vodka, Godiva Chocolate Liqueur, and White Chocolate Liqueur. Round 2 was two $15 White Peach Margaritas with Sauza Silver Tequila, Peach Schnapps, White Peach Puree, and Sweet & Sour Mix. Both drinks were SUPER sweet as you'd expect with names like that. It was happy hour and I was on vacation with my sweetie, so, I guess it was ok to throw back a few sweet cocktails, too.

Note that it didn't seem "required" that drinks were purchased either, so, I guess you could just go to Level 107 Lounge for the view (I think). Self-parking is free at the Stratosphere.

The view from the Observation Deck may be better, but instead of spending $18 for the elevator ride to the top, spend $18 ($15 plus tip) on a couple cocktails while enjoying the view relaxing in the Level 107 Lounge.

***I was disappointed with O; it could just be that I am not a big fan of Cirque du Soleil shows, but I felt this one had quite a few boring parts and it was expensive (but understandable considering its popularity); there were definitely some great spectacle moments, but not enough for me to truly enjoy this one***

The first Cirque du Soleil show I saw was Ka and after having seen Mystere and O since then, I think Cirque du Soleil is not for me.  I liked Ka though I thought it was a little slow in parts and did not have much in terms of high flying acrobatics.  Mystere had more acrobatics, but it had no story (only a series of vignettes) and it just kind of meandered and did not have the spectacle of Ka.  O is kind of like a cross between Ka and Mystere.  It has the spectacle of Ka and the disjointed series of vignettes with no story of Mystere.

The signature element of O is the water, of course.  It is nicely done, but it does get repetitive with all of the synchornized swimming.  They do a lot of nice diving elements including some very high dives that is impressive.

Despite the uniqueness of using water (which definitely goes well with Bellagio given their fountain show), I actually preferred the stage at Ka more.  I found that much more interesting and that along with some stylized touches and uses of curtains and lights made Ka feel much more cinematic.

Ka also had a storyline.  While it was not a great story, it did connect the scenes fairly well.  With O, there is no story.  It is much more like Mystere where there are just a series of acrobatic vignettes including mini-sections with clowns (while I did not love the lightly comedic clown elements of Mystere, I thought they were better than the clowns at O--the scenes were slow, uninteresting and not funny).

While there was no storyline, I think they could have done a better job of tying the vignettes together given the underlying connection of water.  There was not really an embracing of the water.  There were horses, a safari landscape and men dressed in long red coats and white wigs (they seemed to come from a different show all together).  There was even a maid, who pushed a laundry cart, and picked up the clothes (left thrown on the floor after a performer clothing change on-stage); pushing the cart was kind of all she did (I did not get that one; for all I know, Bellagio housekeeping could have just accidentally wandered onto the set).

I think more ocean-themed vignettes would have tied everything together though it could have potentially resulted in cheesiness if not done right.

Still, there were bright spots.  The first trapeze vignette, high above the water, was really interesting and I have not seen a trapeze act quite like the one at O.  It created kind of a nervous and exciting anticipation that was truly special.  The diving was good.  It did get a little repetitive, but there were some great dives--both from high up as well as exciting moments where divers were launched across the stage like rockets).

The arena was beautiful.  There was a greatly lit blue dome above seating and the opening and closing of the red curtain was nicely and very interestingly done.  Seating was comfortable too.

Ticket prices are expensive.  Because of O's popularity, it is hard to find discounted prices for O.  You could probably find similar tickets for Ka at maybe half the price and even less for Mystere.

O might be the most iconic show on The Strip so it is definitely one to consider if you are traveling to Las Vegas for the first time or are a big Cirque du Soleil fan.  If you are not a big Cirque fan or have never been to one of their shows, I would suggest seeing one of their more price friendly shows like Ka or Mystere first to see if this is the type of entertainment you really enjoy before paying the high prices for O.

Like other Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free and self parking.

I always make a point to inquire as to what people do for Christmas dinner. This is easily mistaken as an interest in learning and understanding other cultures, when in reality I'm just looking for a scapegoat. 

Just once, when someone screams "YOU EAT CHEF BOYARDEE FOR CHRISTMAS!?" at me, I'd like to be able to say "oh yeah...well [insert your name] eats [insert something like but not necessarily puppy tails and applesauce]!"

For like, a long time, my family have made hand-made ravioli for Christmas. It's a long and laborious process that takes up the better part of a Sunday afternoon. So naturally that's when I decided to pick up a gift certificate for someone from Tammie Coe.

We're almost knuckle deep in flour and grated cheese when I call to see when they close. 

The ravioli was going to take us 2-3 hours to finish. 

And guess how much longer Tammie Coe was open? That's right, 2-3 hours.

The smell of dough still fresh on my threads, Misty S and I jetted (or should I say "jetta'd"...fuck you) to central phoenix to pick up the gift certificate before the dogs realized they preferred raw dough to dog food. 

Now, I had been to Tammie Coe quite a few times,  usually in tow with Amanda B. Since layers of delicious frosting tend to clash with layers of expensive makeup, I usually opt out of eating any of their tasty treats. I simply sip on a peach tea and pretend I'm not starving for some fucking cake.

But there we were, on a Sunday morning, dressed in our pajamas, having missed breakfast and looking forward to three hours of pasta-making.

Misty S said looking at all the food made her hungry.

Well, yeah.

Saying that Tammie Coe doesn't make you hungry is like saying Bandaids doesn't bring you deep, deep shame.

So along with the gift certificate we got two chicken salad sliders, a peach tea, iced chai, and one of those giant chocolate chip cookies I like to call "diabetes frisbees".

The sliders were all kinds of delicious. Even my veg-leaning squeeze thought so. And considering the prices at other places in the area, you're not going to beat a $2 sandwich. Unless you rob the place.

Would a yelp review count as evidence in court? 

"Your honor, I present to you Exhibit Y, where the defendant  writes 'and as I walked out of the restaurant, money in hand, the cowering hostess muttered to me 'thank you for coming, have a nice day'. Three stars for outstanding hospitality." 

The peach tea was, as expected, great. I almost wish someone would find a way to fuck up peach tea so I could judge how good all this tea I've been drinking really is. The few sips I had of Misty's iced chai latte were above and beyond Starbucks quality. 

But then again, what isn't?

After living here 10 years I figure I have seen enough to have something to say.

What started as a rural community with a few subdisions and of course the toursist attraction of a street full of casinos & hotels. The Strip.

Then it was NightClubs,StripClubs,MegaRessorts, and World Class Dining & Entertainment.

This place has morphed into a Metropolis with freeways criss-crossing the city and MegaResorts, Supermalls, neighborhood strip malls and neighborhood casinos suburban communities like Summerlin, Del Webb, Lone Mountain, and all the subdiviisions.

Houses were built by the 1000's overnight with imported labor. Population went from 60K to over 300K in less than 5 years.

WHat happend?

Schools are 48th in the country which is BAD.Huge class sizes, very underqualified teachers and lots of non-english speaking.40% high school drop out rate!!

Healthcare is non-existant-UMC the county hospital receycled needles spreading Hepatitis last year.Plus nurse shortages.

Courts, County Commission, Mayor and other Governemnt Offcials are corrupt as they come.-The mayor is a former mob attorney. County officials have been indicted & convicted of many crimes, Judges & lawyers arrested regularly. Its madness

Parks & Recreation is where we actually exceed expectations. Theres lots of parks and stuff to do without having to gamble.Lots of sporting events for the kids.

Jobs-Well pay is relatively low unless you are in a high tip paying job or a stripper or something illegal.
Most jobs on the Strip require a Sherrifs Card which cost you $40-$50 and requires a background check and fingerprinting at the police station.
Some jobs also require a Health Card for food handling etc, this requires you to go to the hospital and get a TB shot and watch a video some people have to get other shots too.
Then there the TAM card-Tobacco & Alcohol Managemnt-waitresses,bartenders,clerks and lots more have to get this card which requires a class & test to complete. Plus it cost you $80-#$00.

Food & Entertainment.-Well everyone knows about the Fancy Chefs and all their Fancy restaurants on the Strip but Las VEgas is filled with culinary delights. Many people relocate here and bring their own cuisine and styles.

There's tons of community events for familys and Vegas knows how to throw a party. The big Holidays are always loaded with tourists  but you kind find many intimate events throughout the year.

Lots of quality librarys and other resources.


Casinos have been allowed to build in residential neighborhoods so now nearly every neighborhood has a casino of some kind which is nice if you like $2.99 breakfast & other thinngs casinos offer.

The bus system has added the Duece to its fleet making ir a little better but its still a little slow. The monorail has been erected but not completed. It seems it would be a better beenfit going to & from the airport to the strip.

Many of the traditional casinos had been imploded & new ones bigger & brighter and more expensive have been built in their place. Condos on the strip have become a reality and even Trump has come to town.

Our XFL Football team came & went. We have lots of sporting events and concerts to attend and at reasonable prices.No real chance of ever getting a PRO sports team..

Las Vegas is hot & sunny 300 days a year and for some a little too hot but we adapt and learn to beat the heat.

We have pools in our backyards all hotels and apartments have them too. Lake Mead & Hoover Dam is just a drive to the water even though its been less than impressive over the years.

It's pricy to live in the city but you have everything you need right in the neighborhood, lots of great finds & deals around, usually plenty of jobs to go around and there's always a little luck.

You can take a vacation just by going down the strip or downtown , theres always something new & exciting. Learning to use the comp system at the casinos makes living in Vegas so much funner.

Prostituion may not be legal but there's plenty of Escorts for you and Marijuana has been decriminalized so the cops don't fuck with you plus the quality has gotten alot better with all the legal supply in California nearby.I love this place all you can eat munchies for under $10 everyday!!

I had a slice of pizza from this place at a friends house shortly after they first opened. I couldn't remember if I liked it or not, so I suggested to hubby that we try this place for dinner. The employees inside were very courteous and friendly and the guy who gave me the pizza let me know they offer delivery, which is a plus if you like the pizza. 

Hungry Howie's claims to be "The Home of the Flavored Crust" and offers 8 different types to choose from. The concept here I do like. It sounds like a too good to be true pizza place. Well, it is in my opinion. The 8 types of flavors are butter, asiago cheese, cajun, butter cheese, ranch, sesame, garlic herb and onion. Sounds great right?

I ordered a large "Cheese Pizza" and a large "1/2 Pepperoni and 1/2 Sausage Pizza" as well "Asiago Howie Bread" to go along with the pizza. When I first opened the pizza it looked great. I asked for the cheese pizza to have butter cheese crust. I could see the ring of butter soaked into the pizza box around the crust and it didn't bother me because I did order a pizza with butter on it, but the crust as well the pizza in general had no real flavor. Maybe all the butter cheese flavor soaked into the pizza box instead? The pizza wasn't gross, it just wasn't great. Very average for all the flavor the menu claims to offer. Hubby had garlic herb on his crust and after I sampled a bite of his crust I tasted no garlic flavor. The howie bread I found to be dry and not the type of cheesy I was looking for. The total was $25.93 for the 2 pizzas and bread which I wouldn't have minded if the food tasted as good as it looked. I might be up for trying this place again in the future, but not anytime soon. 

Other things offered on the menu are salads, calzones and wings. You can also order online.

Yagyu, Yama Sushi, Yellowtail, Yonaka, Yoshinoya, Yummy, Yusho, Yu-Yu, Yuzu.  There are many Japanese restaurants in Vegas that begin with a Y.  Some are much more authentic than others, and some are definitely more delicious.  While Yuzu comes in last place alphabetically, they are near the top of the list when it comes to their food.  Yuzu would also probably get you more points in Scrabble than the other restaurants.  

The service is friendly and quite attentive.  This is not really an entree style restaurant, it's best to go with friends and order multiple dishes and share family style.  We tried many things, so I'll just go through each of them:

Sashimi Salad Yuzu Style - Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, carrot, celery, cucumber, radish sprouts and seasonal vegetables.  The description doesn't do it justice: It's like a Japanese mini- taquito or flauta, but instead of meat & cheese wrapped in a tortilla, it's julienned veggies arranged lengthwise and wrapped in sashimi, served on top of greens.  The presentation rocked my socks.

Cold Green Tea Buckwheat Noodles - The noodles had a good texture and firmness, but green tea noodles typically don't float my boat.  Because it's hard to float on noodles.  And I don't have a boat.

Yellowtail Jalapeno - Good, but many restaurants have this.

Halibut Carpaccio -  Instead of a typical soy or citrus sauce, the halibut was served in a basil sauce.  Good flavor and texture, the basil wasn't overpowering.  Just enough to tickle your fancy.

Yuba Sashimi - The menu notes that this is limited to five servings a day; all tofu is made in-house, and this is the tofu skin resulting from that.  I liked it more than I thought I would, but I'm a bigger fan of the zaru tofu.  Still, it's good to try what homemade tofu tastes like to see if it tickles your pickle.

Zaru Tofu - Zaru means basket, and tofu means tofu.  Yuzu's house made tofu is served in a basket with some grated veggies.  Put the toppings on the tofu, pour a bit of the zaru sauce on it, mix and eat.  The sauce was like a less salty, slightly sweet soy sauce.  I liked this dish a lot; if the Yuba Sashimi tickles your pickle, this will turn your pickle into a cucumber.

Chicken Karaage - Good rendition of karaage.  Not too oily, the chicken was flavorful and moist.

Salmon Collar - This was cooked very well.  The salmon was not dry at all.  Not a dish I typically order though.

Yuzu Sorbet - Yum, yum, yum.  This is a perfect treat for summer, plenty of refreshing yuzu flavor.

Black Sesame Pudding - Tasted just like black sesame, but didn't float my boat (pudding buoyancy, lack of boat)

Soy Milk Pudding - Tasted like soy milk.  Nothing wrong with it, pudding just doesn't teeter my totter.

Unlike other restaurants, Yuzu's menu is not large, it consists of a single sheet of paper, double sided.  The above represents a good chunk of the menu, and everything was executed well.  Although many dishes are served with a sauce, nothing is over powering.  Flavors can be delicate, but are balanced.  One visit has already made me a fan, and I can't wait to go back.

Ellis Island, you are dead to me!

Oh Ellis Island, I have been a fan for over 10 years. I have been a loyal customer. I have sung your praises from mountain tops. I brought my friends to enjoy the goodness (or should I say former goodness) of your $7.99 steak dinner. But no more! After the experience I had last night, you are indeed now dead to me and hopefully to all the people who read this review.

Ellis Island, I stuck with the even after you continually raised the price of your steak dinner from $4.99 to $5.99 to $6.99 to what it is now $7.99.

Ellis Island, I stuck with you despite the increasingly awful service...your employees have no sense of urgency nor do they understand customer service.

Ellis Island, I stuck with you even after finding out that your "center cut sirloin" is indeed just beef scraps combined with meat glue, rolled up into a loaf and cut into "steaks."

But, after the experience I had last night with your obnoxious, insensitive, offensive, bully of a restaurant manager I will never visit your establishment again.

I arrived on a Monday night at 9:15pm very excited and hungry. I was really looking forward to a "steak" dinner. We were unenthusiastically "greeted" by a hostess who told us there was a 20 minute wait. Odd, the restaurant was more than half empty...in fact the casino was almost empty. The hostess then directed my attention to a printer paper sign stating the kitchen is being cleaned and anyone who arrives after 9:30 pm will only be able to order off of a limited menu. As we were given a 20 minute wait time I asked the hostess if we would be able to get the steak dinner...she said no. I told her we were there now and if we were seated by 9:30, the supposed cut off time, would we be able to order the steak dinner...she said no. I explained we came specifically for the steak dinner, having walked from the strip, and asked if there was any way we could get the steak dinner...she said no. I then asked to speak to the manager.

After a long wait the manager finally arrived...with a security guard. Really, a security guard? Please look at my Yelp picture...do I look like a threat? The manager stood about 2 inches from my face and proceeded to tell me No over and over again. He kept interrupting me when I pointed out his restaurant was empty, that the hostess was specifically giving wait times so that that people would have to order off the limited menu, etc. I told him his manner and policies were completely unacceptable. I finally just asked, "Am I going to be able to order a steak dinner?" He got even closer to me and yelled, "No!" I then informed him that I would make sure to tell everyone about this terrible experience and he yelled in a close and threatening manner, "Don't threaten me!" I told him that I was not threatening, just informing him that this is what is going to happen and this is what happens when people receive horrible customer service like this. We then walked out, while the manager continued to yell at us.

Amazing! I have never had an experience like this. Just an FYI to you my Yelp friends...this is the experience you can expect from Ellis Island. Inferior food, inferior service, all served up to you by a manager who is a bully. Enter at your own risk.

Follow the yellow brick road to the emerald city and you'll find the golden lion! It's the first thing you see as you enter the main lobby.

This hotel is pretty grand, alright, at least in size. Being the largest hotel and casino in Las Vegas, maybe they feel they don't need to be the best in customer service. Granted, there were over 15,000 people from my company for a huge convention, but they should be equipped to handle as many guests as can fit in the hotel, right? They're just lucky the other 15,000 people went elsewhere.

Need to Spend $?
---------------------
Plenty of restaurants, touristy shops, and of course... massive casino space. Many vehicles for spending dolla bills! The food court gets wicked crowded so I tended to opt for **Blizz**, which is just around the corner and has some healthy juice options (see Blizz review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/blizz-las-vegas?hrid=9pL5NN9VJ-YEqvD0mBJjBA). Also MGM is home to **Cirque Du Soleil's 'Ka'**. Not my favorite Cirque show, but still an interesting one. My favorite Cirque show is the Beatles' 'LOVE', which you can only catch in Las Vegas. (see LOVE review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?hrid=FBWaEYnI5TPtpuBeePDZdA).

Need to Catch Some Sun?
-------------------------------
They have not one, not two, but FOUR pools! If those weren't enough fun for you, they have 3 whirlpools and waterfalls too. It's a 6.5 acre complex of pool action and also includes a quarter mile lazy river. As if you hadn't already consumed enough food and alcohol, they have 5 bars and a full service Cabana grill. You can even get a poolside massage. What?!

Need to Feel Large and In Charge?
----------------------------------------
The **MGM Grand Garden Arena** is there for you! When you're here, you can't help but feel the power and energy of thousands of people in one space. Amazing sound systems and visual effects really enhance the experience. If your company is cool enough to play EDM (electronic dance music) for 5 hours, I can guarantee you'll have a great time here. Arena staff are friendly and helpful, which is a huge contrast compared to much of the hotel.

Need to Dance?
-------------------
Other than partying with my company's EDM fix, you can also hit up **Hakkasan**, one of the hottest nightclubs in Vegas. No wonder this place won the title of "#1 Nightclub in the World" by Playboy Magazine. All the top DJ's spin here, including resident DJ's Tiesto and Calvin Harris. Then of course there's also **Wet Republic** at the ultra pool, complete with the resident DJ's, a newly expanded 95-foot bar (neverending alcohol), a huge LED display, party cabanas/bungalows, and of course tons of people ready to party in their bathing suits. A super fun day party! (see Wet Republic review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/wet-republic-ultra-pool-las-vegas?hrid=KRe8TmiGoVdgNzKIFNxjgw)

All in all, the MGM Grand has a LOT to offer. Just wish their customer service could keep up.

TIP: Be prepared when asking for extra towels. Staff may sound as shocked as if you had asked for their firstborn child.

DATE TIP: Plenty of venues here for a hot date!

In a word, Twist.  

The mere idea of the word is enough to send your token foodie's stomach into a conniption fit of pure desire.  The mere whisper of the word is enough to trigger endless blogging and tweeting due to sheer sweaty-handed anticipation.  The mere realization of the word is enough a road trip all the way to Lost Wages to see what all the fuss is about.  

And so it was done.  Off to the south Las Vegas strip we would go in search of langostine (among other things), prepared in the manner of a man who pretty much put langostine on the map.  

Being the gastronomic simpleton that I am, I decided I couldn't pass up a grand opening invite to the first ever dinner service at Twist by Pierre Gagnaire (December 5, 2009).  But in lieu of a ginormous appetite, what I really should've packed was my brain.  Food this complex, this multi-layered, and this (pardon my crude undertone) "weird", simply can't just be engulfed.  It requires several hours of thinking, ruminating, pondering or whatever-the-hell-it-takes to justify paying $400 a head for arguably one of the fanciest and most thought-out meal you'd ever dream of having this west of the Mississippi.  It's been days since engulfing this meal and I STILL can't wrap my head around it (and my stomach definitely had its work cut out for it too).

Surprisingly, it took nearly 5 hours to complete this marathon of a 6-course tasting menu plus 6 courses of added appetizer supplements (note: every single thing I ate is pictorially posted here).  And don't you dare go on thinking that I'm slow and that 12 courses aren't all that much, because under Pierre Gagniere's roof, that really means like 36 presentations.  Do the math.  

Throughout this marathon dinner complete with cocktails and fine wine, Voss water and a few $8 diet cokes sprinkled in "here and there", I began to realize the perplexity as this:  Pierre Gagnaire is, quite truthfully, an enigma of a man.  Forget that he's Michelin starred-this, iconoclastic-that.  Forget that he practically invented all that we have come to realize is "fusion" cuisine.  And just forget that his so-called eponymous "other" location on Rue. St. Balzac near the Champps Elysees is thought of as being the "3rd best restaurant" in the world by Restaurant Magazine (El Bulli in Spain is the 1st).

Pierre Gagnaire creates an inspiring vision for this type of weird food, which is, not surprisingly, just weirdly delicious.  He's even a lovable weird guy himself, so appropriately charming and entertaining us like a "crazy uncle" might do during his brief cameo at our table.

And as we were appropriately informed by our server David, the whole idea is to "taste and experience" all the ingredients which God put on this earth, which might occasionally occur in 1 singular dish.  This is most evident in the first of 3 presentations of Gagnaire's "Shellfish Royale" - somewhat of an oyster extravaganza with a backdrop of toasted beef gele and shallots, as well as his last presentation of "King Sea Bream", a curiously concoction of a "bonito-shellfish gele" with mozzarella ice cream.  I loved the fact seared scallops aren't even safe from Gagnaire's innovative antics as "black olive gelee" provides a certain Mediterranean setting, but then squab breast and foie gras come in to steal the show.  The end result of these seemingly contradictory flavor combinations and layers is this:  each bite resembles something that you have never ever tasted, with few ways to describe them, save for these vague examples --  My first time eating Pierre Gagnaire cuisine allowed me to taste 5 different representations of the langostine, including the unmistakable "head", allowed me to taste (and like) seafood mixed with cheese mixed with meat, and allowed me to eat something that tasted like the splendor that exists in a tidepool.  

Overall, do I have any idea what this means?  Not on your life.  The only thing I can muster up is that a dinner under Pierre Gagnaire's roof is absolutely positively unlike any other eating experience you will ever have.  Ever.  Go there, and you will see.  The originality of it ensures that you cannot and will not be disappointed.

It is ALL about the Aromatherapy Scrub & Massage at Imperial Health Spa. But brace yourself, bitches. There's no gentle, relaxing touch involved so if that's your thing, don't even bother reading any more of my review. The hearts and rainbows and jumping unicorns and rose petals are just not the type of things that transpire over at the Korean Spa. So if you're a bad ass like me and you're from the school that whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, do feel free to read on... 

They will scrub you within an inch of your life and elbow the shit out of knots in your back but it's sooo worth it! No pain no gain baby! Brunhilda from Ryan and Sean's Not So Excellent Adventure has nothing on the chicks that work here! If you don't get that reference, don't feel bad. It's just some obscure, cheesy movie that I happen to have acted in so I wouldn't expect you to have any idea what I'm talking about. And if you do get it... I'm impressed! Extra cool points in my book for you!

Come earlier than your appointment time. Like half an hour early minimum. They want you to be human soup with the rest of the nudists that enjoy the facilities here pre-scrub/massage. Oh and jump into that steam room for a few too if you can handle it. I can't take it too long though. I get wayyy too hot! *insert cute boys sending me compliments like "Yeah, that's right, you ARE way too hot!" here*

My suggestion is to come here before an airbrush tanning session. Get all that dead skin off your body and then head over to see Terry over at Bronzed. But actually the ideal thing is to do this the day or two before because they put a bunch of hardcore moisturizer/oil on you which is not good to have on your skin before an airbrush tanning session because it will make it so the tanner doesn't stick and defeat the whole purpose of your doing the scrub in the first place.

They do just about everything that can be done to pamper you here during this treatment. And there are two different options. One's $125 and the other is $150. Only difference between the two is that one is longer than the other. The Aromatherapy Scrub and Massage appointment goes as follows:

Your scrubber/massage lady comes and finds you in the steam room or jacuzzi. You go back with her and get completely nude. She scrubs the hell out of you as you contemplate your escape route and/or start thinking of a way you can start climbing the ceiling. She shows you all the nasty skin she has taken off of you and you're like, "Wow! I guess I definitely needed this! I swear I don't live in a cardboard box under a freeway overpass!" Then she washes you with this pineapple smelling soap and one of those poof things. This is one of my favorite parts of the treatment because the scent is very intense and smells amazing! After that they wash your hair for you and condition it while giving you a bit of a head massage. Then they seat you up and give you some soap for your face and have you go get in the shower while they clean up all your dead skin off the table so everything is nice and clean for the massage portion that is coming up next. After your shower, they hand you a towel and have you lay down on the table face down. Then they dry you off some more and begin the massage. After that they flip you over and massage a little more, then put a mask on your face. While the mask is drying, they massage your neck and shoulders. Then they peel the mask off and that's the end of your aromatherapy scrub and massage treatment. 

All in all it is a great experience that I recommend and partake in often. So if you see me running around naked 'round these parts, don't be surprised. And sorry dudes... it's not co-ed in the naked area although the men do have their own birthday suit section at this spa. No clue what goes on back there so you're on your own there, buddy. To all the ladies out there... Maybe say hi or something if you see me... Or not. Cuz that like might be awkward since we're like naked and stuff. I dunno... I'm pretty easygoing so if you don't mind, I won't. Your call either way, fellow yelpers. 

All I know is this... You will leave here glowing and looking fantastic, feeling like a new woman! This place is the bomb diggity and the sheer number of checkins I have listed above should speak volumes about how much I love this place!

What to write for my 1600th review?

Sometimes, sage sayings can be contradictory. For example, the definition of intelligence is sometimes given as the ability to learn from one's past mistakes but it is also said that the definition of stupidity is repeating the same action again and again and expecting a different outcome!

With certain honourable exceptions such as Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley, I tend to be wary of restaurants in hotels, regarding them as traps for hotel guests too lazy to leave the hotel in search of a top notch meal

However, when I booked to watch Ka at the MGM Grand, I was intrigued by the omakase tasting menu at Shibuya, the Japanese restaurant located in their restaurant row. With a line-up of ingredients including toro, wagyu, foie gras and lobster, it looked very promising though I knew that it would take a first rate Japanese meal to satisfy me as I was also dining at another local Japanese legend in Vegas and favourite amongst Yelpers on the same trip - Raku (http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/raku-las-vegas#hrid:kQccGZ8GEw6cqZNBUqkwpQ)

I made my reservation via the hotel website and the only wrinkle in the evening was that my table wasn't ready at the time I booked

The restaurant is gargantuan, a definite contrast to the intimate Raku but I did appreciate the stylish surroundungs. There was a Vegas buzz of excitement to the place and despite the size of the operation, my food arrived quickly but the meal was well paced

1. Amuse of Kushi Oyster with Apple Momiji and Orange Ponzu
I usually like my oysters freshly shucked, briney and metallic from the sea but here, the citrus notes did enhance the meaty oyster

2. Trio of hamachi
This delicate fish was served in different preparations. Firstly as a sashimi with a hint of garlic, ginger and pepper. Then a tartar where the minced fish was mixed in with tobiko and garlic-infused ponzu. Lastly again as sashimi with wasabi, wasabi oil and Hawaiian red salt. A lovely contrast of 3 preparations

3. Sashimi duo
My first slice of sashimi was one of my favourite fish - chu toro (fatty part of the tuna belly), served with ginger soy sauce and spiced crunchy garlic. The other piece was kanpachi, yuzu juice and black truffle oil. Yummy sashimi

4. Tataki of Australian wagyu beef, lemon tamari soy, tarragon oil and garlic chips
The beef was almost sweet with freshness and the lemon lifted it with the nice contrast of crunchy garlic chips

5. Ezi Ebi
If I tell you that this dish was Australian lobster tail and day boat scallops in uni sake butter sauce and that it tasted every bit as magnificent as it sounds, I think I can rest my case

6. Niku
Braised Kobe-style short rib was served with sauted foie gras and rounded off with sweet and spicy soy. The meat was meltingly tender and the sauce wasn't over-sweet. The umami hit from the foie gras was heavenly as usual

7. Maine Lobster Miso Soup, Green Onions, Shitake Mushrooms
No ordinary soup as you can tell from the ingredients!

8. Nigiri with freshly grated wasabi root

9. Dessert Tasting
Raspberry-Yuzu calpico pannacotta, choco-lychee mousse cake, and mochi ice cream proved a tasty, sweet and surprisingly light end to a magnificent meal

As you can tell just from reading the review (until Yelp invents smell-o-vision or taste-o-vision, I'm afraid my photos will have to do with helping me enhance my words), this was a legendary meal. Top class ingredients were treated sympahetically and allowed to sing with complementary sidekicks that enhanced and not take over. Recognisably Japanese but with a nod to western ingredients

As for restaurants in hotels, I'm very happy to eat my words provided the words are as delicious as the food at Shibuya!

We had a wonderful evening here last night after sitting outside in our heated car for forty minutes. LOL

Well as you might known, it's been cool here in the valley lately. And, sitting outside for a table to free up wasn't an option. Which BTW, I believe sums up nicely our thoughts of Basil & Garlic. Who would wait forty minutes in the cold, for a table unless it was something special?

And special it was, owner Nadine came over and welcomed us.  She was sweet and warm, both to us and everyone in the restaurant. That was how the evening went and you can understand why so many people flock here. 

We started with a salad with a home made Italian dressing for only $1.50.  For dinner we ordered the Chicken Parmesan with Angel Hair for $15.95 (photo) with a side of Sausage ($2.85). The cutlets were huge and very flavorful. We also ordered the Lasagna for only $13.95. It too was huge and meal for two. 

I cannot convey how wonderful the evening was and how pleased we were with the food and the warmth of our host.  The food was Four Stars plus and the value over Five Stars.  Our bill came to a very fair $36.75. 

Enjoy!  We look forward to our next visit.

If at first you don't get in, try, try again! This is what I told myself after visiting the first time on a Saturday night only to learn that it was a three-hour wait for a bay (the private golf areas). The next time we tried to visit, we came at a down time and luckily scored a bay right away! I'm so excited to see a place like Top Golf come to the Valley. My only question is, what took them so long and why don't other fun entertainment spots like this open up more often!? 

Golfer or not, this is a really fun time and it's family-friendly so Mom & Dad can have a cocktail while the children play! It's like a driving range meets a bar meets a golf arcade. Now, if you are a golfer, you might never want to leave and if you aren't a golfer, this might kick start you into wanting to play. We had a lot of fun and can't wait to continue to visit, especially when the weather cools down!

Here's how it works. 

1. First time you visit, you will go to the check-in counter and buy a card for $5. This card will serve as your license to golf and that means you can bypass the first counter on your next visit. You will also pay for the first hour which varies in price depending on the time of day: $25 an hour (total, not per person) from open until Noon, $35 an hour from Noon-5 and $45 an hour from 5:00 until close. 

2. After you've signed up and purchase your card and first hour, they send you over to the concierge where they will set you up with your bay or put you on a wait-list depending on the time of day. 

3. Now that you're set up, you can head over to your bay and start to play. The bay comes with golf clubs and a private area with couches and misters so even if you don't want to play, you can still hang out and watch! 

4. The bays run by the hour, so when your hour is up, you can pay for another half hour or hour right at your bay, making it easy (and pricey!)

5. You will get your own server at your bay and they offer a full bar and full menu of tasty food.

*** If you just want to come and drink, they also have a full bar set-up so you don't have to rent a bay. ****


Tips:

1. If you're a golfer, you can bring your own clubs. 

2. If you like to play with a glove, bring it with you. 

3. Wear comfortable clothes. 

4. You don't need golf shoes but I suggest you wear closed toed shoes. I played in flip flops and it wasn't very fun. 

5. If you don't want to play golf, you can still hang out with your friends in the bay while they play.

I wish I could give this place 6-stars. I even changed my last meal on earth in my profile to Bacchanal Buffet- it was that good.

Weekends are WAY more expensive because of brunch. We had a little mishap when we called and asked for prices and were given the wrong information. When we told the cashier that- she said that we should have called the buffet and not the hotel. WTF- you work there, right?

Anyways- it was off-season in Vegas, so we only waited about 10-minutes before being seated. Because it was brunch, mimosas were complimentary and we were going to get our money's worth. We 

I seriously could list out all the food that I ate, but that would be a super, super long review. If you want to know- you can see the photos I posted while here. Everything was scrumptious!

A couple of standouts:
- Beef brisket: It was smokey, tender and came in a big slab on your plate. You could break apart the meat with your fork with little effort. This one of my favorite things.

- Eggs Benedict with skirt steak: A small individual portion served in a cast iron skillet. The egg yolk was calling my name from across the restaurant. I ate two without any effort, but had to contain myself before going back for a third. They also have this same dish with fried chicken instead. I wanted beef. The meat is tender and has that nice grilled flavor. Break the egg and it's like a slop of heaven soaking into your bottom piece of English muffin.

Quail egg flatbread: This came lathered with small little over-medium eggs and bacon. The outer crust was crispy and you heard that crunch when you broke it apart or took a bite. It definitely had that wood-brick oven taste, though, I'm not sure how it was cooked. 

I am just going to say that you HAVE to eat here at least once. Like a tourist destination, you should make it a PRIORITY. Screw the bodies exhibit, screw the Grand Canyon- you need to go to Caesar's Palace for their Bacchanal Buffet. It's seriously worth it.

With so many notable spots for fusion cuisine having popped up in the middle of the desert over the past few years, Japaneiro kicks the door down and slam dunks their excellent menu into the Asian fusion ring with authority. 

Like a lot of the gushing reviews already mention, the chalkboard specials by the entrance is where the gold is.  My advice would be to take a picture of it to look over with your tablemates so you're not like me and getting up to look over the board again and again as if it were on display at a museum.  

I can never say no to foie gras.  If foie gras told me to jump off a bridge, buy it diamond earrings or crash my car through a convenience store, I'd do it.  It was well cooked and those tasty notes of fatty tenderness in a savory sauce were music to my mouth.  I even showed some restraint by offering the last bite to my wife. :P

The Nigerian prawns tasted as impressive as they appeared.  Large and succulent, the truffle butter sauce that it was accompanied by took it to another level.  The green salad offered a nice balance to the whole dish.  I admit I sucked on the shrimp shells to savor the flavor and only felt 3.1% ashamed/embarrassed about it afterwards.  

Our meal luckily managed to carry over to the late happy hour that occurs M-F 10pm-midnight.  Ending the meal with some great small bites like the salmon/tuna/beef tacos and miso black cod lettuce wraps.  The standout was the rock shrimp with its terrifically crispy fry, micro wasabi kick and cream sauce made it an absolute steal for $5.50.  I guess that shows how good these chefs are; they even managed to make rock shrimp interesting!

The lack of description for many of the items caused me to underestimate things like the "European Sea Bass" until I saw it brought to another table near the end of our meal.  The fish looked marvelous with the meat being filleted post-grill and the rest of the carcass twisted up for an interesting look.  I was practically seething with jealousy!  

Lesson learned: everything is awesome and get that the next time.

Our group got hungry so with the lack of planning, we decided to just go across the street to Johnny Rockets.

FOOD - 1 Star: I ordered:

- Chili Cheese Fries: These were ok. They were really heavy on the chili and the cheese was barely there. It would've been way better to actually have the cheese on the top instead of under the chili.

- Sweet Potato Bacon Cheese Fries: I enjoyed the sweet potato fries myself, but the cheese... if you can call it that... was pretty disgusting. I don't know why they couldn't use real cheese. Instead they used some liquid cheese that you'd find at the movie theater and so it had this weird taste to it. The only thing that kind of saved it was the bacon, but even that was overpowered by the liquid cheese. This ruined my appetite and I had to eat around the cheese, which was almost impossible since it was all over the place.

- Smoke House Single Burger: This was pretty good, but smaller than I thought it would be. Maybe I don't come here often enough, but the burger was small. The taste was spot on. You can't go wrong with a meat patty, cheese, onion rings, and bacon.

SERVICE - 2 Stars: The staff was friendly, but literally only approached us to drop off the menus and to deliver food. No one checked on us at all during the meal. I need an extra fork and literally had to flag someone down to get it.

ATMOSPHERE - 2 Stars: It's your typical Johnny Rocket's setup and my biggest issue with the place was the fact there was no soap in the restroom. I'm glad we had hand sanitizer with us, but that's just gross.

RECOMMENDATION: Overall, I'd say you can skip this place. Go to Capriotti's or Joe's Pizza in the same shopping center instead. You'll get way better food for the money you're paying.

So long Pink's, hello The Wiener's Circle! I was sad to see Pink's go, but the location was never going to work with the jacked up prices and confusion with the names they gave the hot dogs compared to what they are actually called at the original location in California. So, The Wiener's Circle enters in its spot. Will it last? Time will tell! I must admit, I did watch the TV show they had on a while back and found the games they played with the customers (at night they curse at the customers and play crazy ass games... It's intended, expected to all customers and hilarious) funny. I was surprised they opened up in Vegas, but hey it saved me the trip to Chicago for the moment! The original location in Chicago has been in business for over 30 years.

Looking over the menu board, I was surprised at how fair the prices were. The prices here range from about $2-$3 higher depending on the item compared to the Chicago menu. Being in a casino we can expect higher prices, but they weren't too outrageous. I ordered "Wieners in a Blanket" priced at $4.99 for 6. They are made fresh to order. I had my choice of sauce and chose honey mustard. That honey mustard had a real good flavor and paired nicely with the tasty blanketed wieners. They also come 12 to a order, but the 6 was good enough for me. Priced at $4.99 I also ordered "Cheddar Fries" and wow were they good! The fries are fresh cut and come 1 pound per order. The cheese they put on top was very good! Hubby and I split a "Char Polish" priced at $6.99 and came with mustard, relish, onions, pickle, tomato, celery salt and sport peppers. It was pretty good. Next time I would ask for a lighter char, but a decent hot dog with nice toppings. All the burgers and dogs come with those toppings unless you tell them to leave it off. They are happy to customize your order so just ask! If you are in a pinch for time you can phone your order ahead and just pick it up. Aside from lunch and dinner they also serve breakfast and offer Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

Open letter to restaurant customers everywhere (especially Yelpers):

The inc.com article recently discussed in Yelp Talk makes good points about the serious impact that Yelp can have on a business, positive or negative.
http://www.yelp.com/topic/tempe-new-article-on-yelp
http://www.yelp.com/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.inc.com%2Fmagazine%2F20100201%2Fyouve-been-yelped.html

Despite any controversy the article also may have included, I realize the importance of being a responsible reviewer more after reading it, and hope I can share that feeling and understanding with you now.

Especially when it comes to independent, unique, one-of-a-kind places -- would you really want your favorite local flavor to disappear because a yelper or two didn't like a particular server's muffintop or tone of voice?

With that in mind, I must humbly take on a review Update that 's weighed heavily on my soul for some time.

Several months after my initial review of Steakenburger, I received a note from the owner, Tom.  He sent a personal message instead of a public comment, and did NOT at all make the mistake some proprietors do by responding in an angry or condescending tone to my critiques.  Instead I found the response to be brimming with *CLASS*.

I received a sincere and heartfelt letter apologizing for my experience and asking a chance for redemption.  If you read below, you can see that they took the review and steps to address its criticisms VERY SERIOUSLY.

I would like to invite all Yelpers to remember to give second chances and update their reviews often, even the bad ones, whenever appropriate to do so.  
Sometimes things go wrong that are outside of the biz's control.
Sometimes a rogue server is having a pissy day and takes it out on you.
Sometimes they just make a mistake.

We all do.  And we always want another chance, don't we?  Ask us and we'll tell you we DESERVE it, too.   

-----------------------------------------------------------------
"Ryan C-
My name is Tom Philp, owner of SteakenBurger.

First, I am bummed about your bad experience.  With that said, I truly appreciate your candid feedback.  I cringe every time I re-read your experience (which is often), but I believe your review has made us a better restaurant.

While we are still hiring from the human race, and will make mistakes, I'd like to believe that we listen to our critics and respond with systemic adjustments to prevent future similar occurrences.

I have waited some time to respond to insure that I felt comfortable that we had improved our processes and consistency.  

I'd like to invite you back for a do-over ....
I've read all of your reviews and know that I could get skewered again if we fail you, but also feel that we would get a favorable review IF (and only IF) it is warranted.  At the risk of your wrath, I invite you back. 

Thank you for your consideration of this invitation.

Tom & Judie Philp
SteakenBurger"
---------------------------------------------------

The folks at Steakenburger are a class act, and I wish them great luck in their tough business endeavors.

Steakenburger earned their redemption, and they highly DESERVE it! 

I went back for the food, becasue it is unique and fresh and tasty.  
The Steakenburger was a delicious meat-pile, cooked to ideal doneness, and yet still juicy without feeling greasy.  
The homecut fries seem to be double fried now, or something, becasue they had a crisp outside while retaining a potatoey mushiness inside -- perfectly cut thick with the skins on.  Homecut fries are hard to crisp up, and they've done a wonderful job with this recipe.  

There are ten different flavors of wings (let's see if I can remember them: mild, med, hot, suicide, zombie (?!?), bbq, honey bbq, honey hot, habanero, damn i fell short!) and there is even a neat challenge to eat a certain number of habanero wings within an hour and get your picture on the wall of fame.  
I'm sure Adam Richman has this one on his radar allready for a future MvF.  Steakenburger is way more deserving than some of the junk that's been on DDD, too (Chino Bandido, blech)

In summary: GO TO STEAKENBURGER !

If their Shanghai Xiao Long Bao  is the only item on their menu, I would still be dropping by this latest Chinese restaurant to open up in Las Vegas's greater Chinatown area. Now before you all go crazy and question why it is only getting 4 and not 5 stars on Yelp, let me explain.

It is good, not the best I've ever had, but I enjoyed it. In fact, after my unplanned XLB crawl of the 2 newest restaurants that serve it to open up on the west side, I can say A & K Chinese Restaurant (aka Heng Long Chinese Restaurant, if going by their name on the credit card receipt) was the clear winner of the head-to-head XLB CHALLENGE over Edamame Restaurant on Wednesday, May 7th, 2014.  

You don't have to take my word for it though. What I think is "good" could be "that is the worst, flavorless blah blah I have ever had!"  (Funny random thought: what if water is being judged right now?)

Anyway, seems like we are blessed with more and more XLB options in Las Vegas, which means to make it, the chefs all have to up their games. Translation: consumers are the winner. Yay!

I also had their Three Treasures Dumpling  (12pcs) per order and it was pretty good too. The fact they hand make these is just wonderful.

On my first visit I also tried their Pan Fried Pork Bun  (8 pcs) $7.95. If you go by yourself, this item alone will be enough to send you home with a full belly. It was just okay, the doughy bun on the outside is thinker than what I have had in Taiwan (which was THE BEST  at that busy night market), so maybe not fair comparison.

Beef Pancake Roll  $7.95. Decent. There are better ones I have had within a 2 mile radius.

Hot Purple Sweet Potato Juice , small $2.25. It was an experience to try this. It is basically purple sweet potato drink, not really sweet, but a creamy dessert alternative beverage.

Service overall was good.  I happened to have been there when they were not busy, so that might have helped too. Plus I can speak enough Mandarin Chinese to get by in restaurants, so that certainly helped.

Decor/Ambiance was pleasant. Music playing in the background was not Chinese, but instrumentals of popular American songs, which you probably wouldn't even pay attention to unless you focus on it.

Price/Value: I think it was good overall. 

Note: this is NOT your typical Chinese takeout restaurants. I must admit I am not familiar with most of their menu offerings, because I am not at all an expert on Shanghainese cuisine. But they also described their cuisine as  (New style of Jiangsu and Zhejiang - per Google Translate, which is still like Hexcodes to me). But come for their XLB, and if you are adventurous enough, you can explore their other menu items.

Expect an UYE for Xiao Long Bao  crawl and another one to just explore this restaurant's menu (yeah, I am definitely gonna need backup).

Bonus: Love that American Express is accepted along with other forms of credit card payments.  :)

Whoahhhh!!! Now this is what i call a throw down!

Of course, i'm referencing Bobby Flay's inventive cuisine at his southwestern themed restaurant in Caesar's palace, Las Vegas.   

It was our first night and after winning a grip of change form the slots at Caesar's, my friend suggested eating at Mesa Grill for din din.  I wasn't too familiar with the restaurant but when I realized it was Bobby Flay's joint, my interest was certainly piqued.  

Truth be told, i'm not a Flay fanatic by an stretch, but a little star power never hurt anyone IMO.  With that said, there's always the pressing issue of hype over substance which in turn had me proceeding with cautious optimism.  

As we made our way across the bustling casino and stepped into the restaurant, I definitely felt the warmth of the contemporary Latin theme throughout the communal dining space, which was flanked with rich reds and soft golden hues. 

Within moments, the hostess greeted us and proceeded to lead us to our seats.  Our server wasted no time in taking our orders, as well.

In record time, we got our beautifully plated appetizers and entrees. 
Let's just say my doubts melted away with my very first bite! Wow, this food had big, bold flavor and the quality was incredible! 

Here's a rundown of what we had:

Shrimp tamale - Plump, juicy and mouthwatering gulf shrimp in a fresh corn meal that was both rich & flavorful. Outstanding! 

Tuna nachos - Fresh chunks of seasoned ruby red tuna in a sweet & tangy sauce that had a pleasant citrusy finish. The crisp corn tortilla added a nice contrast in texture to this refreshingly vibrant dish! Lip smacking goodness in every bite!

Pork tenderloin - This dish was absolutely phenomenal!!! The meat was like a perfectly cooked filet! It was soft, buttery and rich. Perfectly decadent and oh so flavorful! Honestly, the meat was so tender, i kept asking my friends "Are you sure this is pork?" 

Spice Filet - Buttery, tender and succulent beef filet with a pleasant kick from the house spices! Scrumptious!

Lamb chops - Beautiful crust and perfectly pink inside. Boasting a magnificent charbroiled flavor that was absolutely addicting! Seconds please!

Corn - Fresh cuts of corm kernels with explosive flavor and fantastic texture. This is a side you don't wanna miss!

After consuming all that delicious food, we simply had no additional room for dessert. Besides, wehad our minds set on some chocolate decadence at Max Brenner's afterwards (review forthcoming)

Overall, service was attentive, friendly and fast. The food, of course, was incredible and most importantly, it didn't break the bank either!

Why? Because this birthday boy didn't have to pay...lol

Happy Eats!

It's in the name. They like to smash burgers! The menu says they use 100% certified angus beef. The burgers are fresh, never frozen, and cooked to order. If you prefer chicken instead of burgers you can find that here too.

Yesterday I picked up my favorite the "Avocado Club" (crispy chicken) for lunch priced at $6.99 and it was delicious. The all white meat crispy chicken has nice flavor. The sandwich had bacon that was freshly cooked, not microwaved or something questionable. Also the sandwich has lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing on it. I love the fries! I'm not picky about how skinny or fat my fries are as long as they are good and these fries paired with the garlic they put on them makes for a nice side to your sandwich or burger. The "Fried Pickles" priced at $2.29 are not good at all here. I have tried them twice now and they are way too greasy. 

They offer a few different salads if burgers and chicken aren't your thing. Also on the menu is the "Spicy Black Bean Burger"  for you veggie burger eaters. For dessert (like you have room) they offer Haagen-Dazs shakes! They range in price from $3.99 - $4.29 and you can get classic vanilla, chocolate and strawberry or you can go for a oreo or nutter butter shake. The "Nutter Butter" is super tasty. There is a kids menu and they serve Coke products (yay coke) and beer. 

I must admit that I only ever come here with a coupon. I signed up for the e-mail club and for my birthday I get a free shake and throughout the year I get coupons for BOGO on entrees. I always present my coupons before I place my order and have never had an issue. There is a offer with your yelp check-in for 10% off any SB meal, but they wont let you combine it with a coupon you already plan to use so I haven't even redeemed mine yet. Nice lunch spot especially with a coupon.

It's been a while since I've been so inspired by a restaurant that I felt it necessary to write a review immediately after returning from my first visit. As you can see by all the glowing reviews so far, the Buddha Belly Deli is well on it's way to becoming a success story. I foresee this restaurant as having the uniqueness necessary to become one of the places that tourists come to for an "off the strip" experience. I also predict it to climb the charts in the Yelp list of top restaurants in Vegas/Henderson amongst the likes of The Sparklings and Soho Japanese. I was one of the first few customers of those restaurants when they were new and it's clear to me that Buddha Belly Deli has that certain "je ne sais quoi" that those other restaurants did. So mark my words here. This restaurant is definitely a keeper and if you haven't been here yet, you should definitely cross it off your to-do list. Get to it!

Enough about me singing Buddha's praises, let's talk about the food. I tried the top three items that all the trailblazer yelpers before me recommended and I was a fan of all three of them.

I started with the Thai Clam Chowder. Such an ingenious idea to merge an American classic with Tom Kha soup. Good stuff!

Then I moved on to the "Pho Dip" which is a Vietnamese spin on the classic French Dip sandwich. The dipping broth is pho soup. The sandwich consists of a soft & squishy fresh French bread, perfect for absorbing that yummy pho like a sponge. The inside is filled with slices of rare beef, jalapeos, onion and bean sprouts. A definite must try.

Last but not least I had the Szechuan Shrimp Po-boy... Crispy shrimp, spicy Szechuan mayo & shredded lettuce sandwiched between a sliced baguette. It wasn't spicy enough for me so I think next time I'm going to try out the homemade spicy sauce that Nate was raving about and kick my sandwich up a notch.

Then there were the little touches, like the container of forks being labeled "Fork You" and the knives were labeled something else equally clever but I can't remember for the life of me. My point though is that it's obvious the owner thought of something creative right down to the last little minute detail... A detail that was not lost on me. Totally my style of the way I would do things if I had a restaurant. Now I must know what every single thing is labeled so I need to come back and see. Inquiring minds wanna know! Great conversation piece for guests.

I'm already plotting and planning my next visit. I can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu. Another patron was recommending their Sloppy Joe to me and said it's so good that it brings tears to his eyes. This is an awesome new addition to the community and it's right next door to a really good nail salon, not that you need any further incentive to visit but I'm just saying...

Forte was mysteriously closed on a recent Saturday night, yet my wife was unable to shake her hunger for Eastern European cuisine.  Nothing else would do.  You know those Snickers commercials "you're not you when you're hungry"?  My wife turned into Dolph Lundgren aka Ivan Drago from Rocky 4.  For a brief moment, I feared for my life ;)  A Bulgarian friend recommended BG Bistro a while ago and it was the perfect time to give it a shot. 

I found it curious that outdoor seating was offered when all to see was a Smith's supermarket parking lot.  The cigarette smoke hit me as soon as I entered.  Was this their way of staying authentically Eastern Europe?  I kinda felt like a tourist.  With all the college football games going on that moment, they opted to show golf and soccer on their TV's to enhance the Europeanness.  I could see the smoke being a huge turnoff to prospective patrons, definitely wore it upon exit.   But on this evening, we would NOT be deterred.   DRAGO!!!

Our friendly waitress walked us through the menu and specials.  The priciest entres were the daily specials of lamb chops or grilled trout for only $13.  I was so close to getting one of them, but the kufteta was calling my name.  Grilled Bulgarian meatballish burger patties made with pork were juicy and accompanied by 3 small salads: potato, bean (blaaand), and cabbage.  The tomato sauce on the side went well with the kufteta, we asked for more.    

I should have traded out the bean salad for fries topped with Bulgarian feta.  Lots of tables ordered that as a stand-alone dish.   Bulgarian feta is good stuff.  It's quite different from the popular Greek version, creamy while still being firm.  That really shines when shredded like in the shopska salad at the start of our meal.  It also tasted great when baked in a clay pot with lukanka, egg and tomato sauce.  The lukanka had a nice, lean salami and bacon taste to it.  I'd love to try their other dried meats.  The Bulgarian red wine was served cold and went well with everything.  A bottle was only $18.  Nazdrave!  
   
Got talked into the biscuit cake for dessert after some arm-twisting.....light twistin..............OK....no freaking twist at all.  She simply suggested it and we said yes.   Glad we did!  It was like a sweeter tiramisu.  

So the food definitely made up for the smokiness, but BG Bistro would not be for everyone.   Pretty cool that it's in the same plaza as Villa Algarve though.  A burgeoning international plaza!!

Holy Customer Service NIGHTMARE.

WOW. The lack of professionalism the entire staff showed leading up to our reservation followed through to 3 months later when our issue from NYE was not resolved... One word... NIGHTMARE. An all around headache that I would not care to every partake in ever again. 

Please note the actual club itself is gorgeous. However, that doesn't give anyone the right to completely forget any form of customer service. 

LONG story short:
Had a reserved table for NYE.
Arrived at 10:30pm and were given the reserved table for a party of 12 on stage.
11:30pm - removed from the table with no explanation, sent around trying to talk to the managers to figure out what was happening. Did I mention this was NYE and all happening right before the ball drop?
11:50 - told the team of 3 that had handled our reservation was not working the night of. WHO CARES! We had emails and confirmations of the reservation. 
11:55 - the option to get a table that fits 4 behind the stage next to the pool when we had a party of 12. So yes, a table that did not fit our group nor was it anywhere near the DJ booth or dance floor.
Basically learned that someone else offered more money for our table so we were booted. We were told we would receive a refund. It is now 3 months after and we are still waiting on the refund. Atrocious. 

In the last of the 23 emails returned back and forth, this was the closing: "Please let me know if you decide to visit again and I will personally make sure your experience is flawless." BAHAHAHA! Right... because that is what we were told when we made our original reservation for NYE. Did I mention we planned this in September? Yes, 3 months of planning down the drain thanks to greedy club managers and owners. 

Big name DJs? Yes
Bottle Service & VIP? Yes
Huge areas to move around? Yes... however, during the high tourist months, they pack them in. Also, if you are in one spot of the club and have to get to the other side and there are crowds... give yourself 20 minutes. Not even joking. 
Great sound system? Yes
Fun lights and confetti? Yes
**Absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with in any club around the world. TRIPLE YES.**

How much would you pay for a popular & busy buffet with hundreds of quality choices?

   A: $54
   B: $74
   C: $94
   D: Anything ... just let me in the freakin' buffet already

Be prepared to pay any of those prices at Bacchanal Buffet cause this is the current "It" buffet in Vegas. Caesar's Palace can pretty much charge whatever they want. The line is KuRAAAYzeee. We tried to go for dinner Monday before Christmas and the line was 3 1/2 hours long. That's over 200 minutes. We read on Yelp about an "Express" option for $20 extra, but it wasn't available that night. We left.

So, we came back on Christmas Eve for a late lunch. The set-up was different and line much shorter ... because it was a 25-minute line to put your name in for a time slot 3 1/2 - 4 hours later. The registration part is cool if you can wait. I can't. Luckily, the "$20 Express" option was available at that time. Whew! Seriously, I would of paid anything to skip the wait. So, after paying $74 for lunch per person, we headed to ... the next line. It took another 25 minutes to get seated with express. 

      This better be one hell of a buffet!

            It was. 

Here's what I pigged out on for a couple hours ... 

Meats & Seafood
 - Chilled Shrimp
 - Chilled Crab Legs
 - Warm Crab Legs
 - Rack of Lamb
 - Oysters on the Half Shell
 - Prime Rib
 - Sausages
 - Chicken
 - Ribs
 - Mussels
 - Chinese-style Crab
 - Crawfish

Sides
 - Caprese Salad
 - Sliced Pineapple
 - Pho Noodle Soup
 - Turkey Pot Pie
 - Charcuterie Meats
 - Cheeses
 - Steamed Dumplings
 - Creamed Leeks & Lobster
 - Sushi Rolls
 - Cranberries
 - Sliders
 - Bread
 - Crab Benedict
 - Chinese Broccoli

Desserts
 - Fresh Crepes
 - Red Velvet Whoopie Pies
 - Gelato
 - Creme Puffs
 - Vanilla Creme Brulee
 - Chocolate Creme Brulee
 - Buttercream Pops
 - Cheesecake Pops
 - Berry Mousse Tarts
 - Fresh Cookies

Bacchanal Buffet really is a great buffet. It is, of course, overpriced and hardly worth the wait, but if you want quality and choices like this in Vegas you have to either pay for it or have the patience of a very bored saint to stand in line. When you do finally get into Bacchanal, go nuts on the seafood and meats so at least you feel like you're making it worth your money/time.

We arrived at 5:00 pm to check-in and were told by the front desk agent that our room wasn't ready yet and that they couldn't give us an estimate of when it would be. The hotel's check-in time is 3:00 pm. In order to compensate us, they gave us a $150 discretionary account to use on whatever we wanted in the hotel as well as an upgrade from our terrace suite to a wraparound suite. We believed this was more than fair and were perfectly happy to wait until our upgraded room was ready. When we were notified that it was, we checked in and the agent confirmed with us the $150 account.

After a lovely Saturday night of enjoying the admittedly beautiful view provided by our upgraded room and the drinks from the bar paid for by the $150 discretionary account, we cleaned up and checked out at 12:00 noon. 

The front desk agent told us that we would be charged $94 for incidental expenses beyond what was provided by the hotel. We knew that it was highly unlikely for us to have spent that much money that night, and asked for a receipt accordingly. The agent pulled it up and told us that the hotel had originally given us $50, not the $150 figure which we had been told - twice! After I corrected her, she brought in the front desk manager, David Bayley, who told us that he couldn't do anything and that we'd have to wait until 5:00 pm for yesterday's front desk manager to arrive so that she could sort out the issue.

After coming back at 5:30, we asked a front desk agent, Kira, if we could speak to yesterday's front desk manager. She said that yesterday's manager wasn't there and that we should talk to her instead. What followed from Kira was an extremely condescending if superficially pleasant treatment of us, implying that we were lucky enough to have been upgraded to a different room and that we should have been happy with what we received. Eventually, she deigned to give us an additional $50 comp credit out of "good will", but refused to do anything else, telling us that she'd ask the original agent we received the $150 credit from later to verify our story and that she'd follow up with us via email.

We, of course, were profoundly skeptical that anything would be resolved over email and asked to speak again to the manager, David. After Kira briefed David about our complaint, he came out to tell us, essentially, to leave the hotel and be happy with what we already received. Only after requesting to speak to David's superior did he finally decide to call the original agent to confirm our story. He told us that the original agent couldn't remember the amount she had compensated us, and that they'd cancel out our balance of $94.

First of all, this incident shows a stunning lack of integrity by the front desk agents. They had first told us to wait until 5:00 pm for a manager that never showed up, then told us to leave Vegas while they investigated the incident and that they'd follow up via e-mail, and finally that they'd give us a $50 credit out of "good will" - admitting no wrongdoing - and that we should just leave. The entire time, we felt that they were trying to delay and make it as inconvenient for us as possible so that we'd leave without the issue being resolved. Only after threatening to escalate the issue to upper management did the David take any substantive steps to solve the problem.

Second was the painfully condescending attitude of the front desk. Kira and David seemed to believe that $94 was a great deal of money to us. It wasn't. They didn't understand that our complaint was about the principle that we shouldn't have to pay extra for administrative mistakes made by the staff. They told us that they'd give us a $50 credit to our account out of "good will" with all the smug superiority an aristocrat might throw a dime to a beggar, treating us as though we were simply haggling to get the best deal we could. 

Finally, the whole incident reflects the sheer incompetence of the front desk. Even if they believed that we were lying about the original $150 credit, which certainly was the impression we received, good business sense behooves them to simply cancel out our balance. $94 is nothing compared to the thousands of dollars they're going to forgo via our entire network of friends who will never again stay at the Cosmopolitan. 

At the very end, after they finally canceled out our balance, I asked for Kira and David's business cards so that I knew whose names to mention to the world. David, to his credit, wrote down his name and contact information on a slip of paper. Kira, however, wrote but one word on a slip she handed me - "Kira". No last name, no phone number, no email address. My friends and I couldn't help but laugh at the cowardice she displayed through that simple omission. Anyone decent person doing his or her job competently and with integrity has nothing to hide - unfortunately, Kira seemed to lack both.

Don't stay at the Cosmo. Your dignity is more important than having a nice view.

I've had my hair done by the infamous Kim Vo & I don't consider myself fortunate. You couldn't pay me to go back to him. I gave him two chances but he lost me as a client! Not that he cares because Kim is some "big shot" hairdresser (allegedly). But please allow me to explain because YOU REALLY SHOULD NOT GO HERE!

I thought Kim was a nice guy, so it sucks to have to write this, but this is about hair here & I make my money partially based upon how I look. The results of his work has messed with my livelihood & I'm not happy about it! In short, Kim majorly screwed my hair up & this isn't some isolated incident. I'm completely baffled as to why Kim is a so called "celebrity hairdresser" yet THIS doesn't seem to be common knowledge:

"Kim Vo Firestarter" it's appropriately titled... http://gomezhyatt.com/2010-03-22-kim-vo-firestarter/

I wish I'd read all this BEFORE I went to him because if I had, I would have never let him come within 50 ft of my hair! The whole reason why I went to him was his BS marketing about how he's the "best blonder in the business" & how his blonde techniques are actually healthy for your hair. And I'm embarrassed to say that he caught me with his marketing hook, line and sinker. His PR company must be GOOD at burying info because it turns out that Kim is actually also famous for allegedly burning people & frying people's hair off. You can google all of this info yourself or you will hear it from time to time on Chelsea Lately, as apparently he fried her hair hair off too. Luckily I wasn't burned but I had to cut ties because Kim Vo left my hair in the worst shape that it has ever been in my life after only two visits with him. 

Kim does a GREAT job alright... at packing on the clients like an assembly line! The first time I saw him I was amazed at how fast he works. I was happy with my color but I did notice some tiger striping which was also pointed out to me every time I had a blowout. I think "Who did you hair?!" were the exact words my stylist said when she looked at all the bleeding from the foils in the back section that I was unable to see. But stupid me ignored these warning signs & I somehow thought perhaps it was my fault & that maybe I had tapped the foils by accident while under the dryer. And Kim had me roped in with his lil used car salespitch about how I have to give him a good four visits for my hair to be where it should be. So back I went for time #2 at his salon in Vegas at The Palms. I had been noticing that my hair was sticking up straight every morning like I had been sticking my finger in a light socket so I said something to Kim about it thinking that maybe I should cut my hair even shorter because it was obviously still damaged. Kim talked me out of it though. He related a story about how he was having the same issues with his own hair that morning & that it was sticking up because our hair was short & that we didn't have the weight of it being long to weigh it down. His explanation quieted my concerns & I entrusted him with my hair again. After this visit, my hair condition got even worse & then it finally hit me that HE was the one who was messing my hair up! That's when I started reflecting, & think about it, if he can't even get his own hair right, that is NOT a good sign! And the other thing is that I've had short hair before & I never had issues with my hair sticking up straight like it did under his care. So yeah, the length of my hair was not the problem. It was Kim Vo that was the problem. And let me just say, he is FIRED & officially off my Xmas card list! He's actually lucky I'm not waiting for him in a dark alley to show him my wrestling moves & brass knuckle phone case demonstration, LOL!

And now that I'm done with him, it's crazy how many horror stories I've heard about Mr. Vo which lead me to the articles/shows talking about how he (allegedly) burns people & fries hair. And I also heard that he uses some really hardcore bleach on everyone's hair because when he does his little assembly line action it allows him to lift the hair quicker which means mo clients + mo money = win for him. So if these things are true, then to Kim, you are really nothing more than a dollar sign & that pisses me off. The guy doesn't give a flying F#$K about your hair's health & I had to get back on the extension train & spend a lot of $$ to fix what he did. I just wish someone had said something on Yelp &/or this info wasn't buried by PR campaigns because I definitely would have thought twice about going to him. I'm pissed I drove all the way to Beverly Hills to see him the first time & paid a fortune x2, only to have my hair ruined! So that's my story. Maybe you won't have to fry your hair off or ruin it like he's done to me & others (allegedly). It's really a shame because I wanted to like Kim! I just got sucked in to all the hype. If I can save one person from my fate, this review will have been worth it.

The last place we went to before leaving Vegas was First... and yes, we ended up saving the best for last! If you want to be a complete glutton, and get the most bang for your buck, you must put First on your list of restaurants to hit up in Vegas.

It's only been open for about two months, so we actually just stumbled upon it while we were on our way out of The Shoppes at Palazzo. We were drawn in by the really cool space, and their touch screen menu outside posted extremely appealing inexpensive gourmet comfort food options. Once inside, we got seated at one of the large booths looking out onto the Strip, so we had a perfect view of the pirate show across the street at TI. 

Instead of plain old bread, we were brought pretzels that came with three dipping sauces. If you want, they offer a $5 cheese fondue to go with it. Our server, Carolyn, was awesome, and gave us recommendations on the food and drinks. We decided to start off with the Mojito Lamb Chops which were topped with Mint glaze, 151 and lime and torched at the table. We were impressed with the three thick cuts, and they were perfectly medium-rare. For entrees, I had the wide papardelle pasta with a heaping portion of forest mushrooms in a delicious truffle butter sauce. My guy had the Sesame Miso Glazed Salmon topped with seaweed salad on a bed of sticky rice, which was fantastic. The presentation was beautiful and the salmon was nice and flaky. For dessert, we indulged in the chocolate bar (which tasted like a 100 Grand as an ice cream bar) and the donut sundae... mmm... donut. 

For cocktails, I highly recommend the Cotton Candy Kiss (Grey Goose, elderflower, vanilla, pineapple, cranberry), especially if you're a sweet tooth. It's such a pretty cocktail, and even the presentation is lovely! The martini glass is rimmed with crushed Life Savers and comes with a blue fluff of cotton candy. The liquor is poured over it when it's brought to the table. 

The awesome thing is that they are open late, and I mean really late. They have a special late night menu from 1am-4am Sun-Wed and 1am-6am Th-Sat.

This place would be amazing in the Mission in SF -- foodie hipsters would flock here... I hope they open one up there!!

We contacted Maleisa Hughes last year regarding watching our three dogs (golden retriever, afghan hound and a chihuahua.  The prices were reasonable considering what other sites cost, as they were only charging $20 per dog and they were willing to give a discount for the third dog, so the price was set at $50 per day.  We scheduled a visit to their home and brought our 2 big dogs to introduce them to the owners.  We saw that there was an acre which looked fun for the dogs. They invited us into their home and said the dogs would be treated like members of the family if boarded with them and that all play time outside would be supervised.  Maleisa said they had been boarding dogs for years and were experienced and advised we book early for any dates we wanted as they limited the number of dogs boarded to six dogs.  We felt that was reasonable on a property of that size.  Our dogs were all very well socialized with people and other dogs as we routinely went to dog parks so we felt this would be a great place to bring them. We booked a weekend last fall just to test the place out and see how it went.  We checked in often, via text and and we were told the dogs were doing great and having lots of fun.  The day we picked them up they were out in the yard with the owners running around with a few other dogs and seemed content.    My Afghan hound went to the corner of the yard when he saw me and hid behind some ducks in an open pen, I assumed he didn't want to go home as he had enjoyed his stay.   We went ahead and booked the Christmas week to bring the dogs again.

Christmas rolled around and one of my adult children announced she would be home and offered to watch the dogs for me.  As we had already booked with Green Acres, I didn't feel right about canceling at the last minute, as I had noticed that the owners had numerous young children and felt it would not be fair to deprive the family of the income we had promised.  I did opt to leave the chihuahua home, as I felt he might not be safe running around with bigger dogs.  We boarded the big dogs for about 9 days.  When I came to pick up the dogs that time, they were let out of a room in the back of the house and the afghan hound ran to me with his tail between his legs and couldn't wait to get out of there.  I noticed that both dogs were filthy and smelled HORRIBLE.  I can't even describe the stench, but it took several baths to finally get rid of the odor.  I found it odd because the acreage is all grass, so I couldn't figure out where that stench would have come from.  

Outside of the smell, the dogs seemed fine until a few weeks later we attempted to go back to the dog park where we had gone many times over the years, and when we entered the park the afghan hound FREAKED out and started aggressively barking at the other dogs that ran up to greet him as if to say, "stay away from me".  I had to grab him and remove him to avoid a dog fight.  We attempted to return to the park a few times thereafter and he behaved the same way each time.  He even freaked out on a walk when he saw another dog across the way.  We spoke to a trainer regarding the behavior and he told us once a dog is in that mind set it is VERY DIFFICULT to break it.  We were very sad and couldn't figure out what could have triggered such a wild swing in temperament.  We finally realized that his behavior HAD to have been impacted by the stay at the boarding facility.  Looking back now, if he was stuffed in a room with 30 other dogs, it would have driven any dog mad, or to fear aggression.

We couldn't prove that anything horrible had happened to our dog at that point, it was just a feeling that something bad had happened there and we decided we probably should not use them again.

We decided to hire my niece and nephew last week to watch our dogs while we were out of town, because of that gut feeling something was wrong over there and came back to the news that 17-21 dogs had died in the Hughes' care, or lack thereof.  All I can think about is, IF I had cancelled our plans during Christmas and left the dogs with my daughter, I WOULD HAVE BOOKED last week with the Green Acres and my dogs would have been among those poor souls who lost their lives.  We were the lucky ones...I may not be able to take my temperamental hound to a park anymore, but at least he is alive.  My heart is breaking for all the families who lost their sweet puppies.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 45/100

I had read some amazing reviews about Jean Philippe Patisserie, so I HAD to come here on my recent visit to Vegas this past weekend.

It is located in the Bellagio hotel, just a little bit past the Conservatory & Botanical Gardens. There are signs pointing towards which direction it is located in!

I was actually pretty surprised at how small this place was. I had envisioned to be a full bakery/patisserie with tons of cute little cafe tables/chairs and whatnot, but that wasn't the case. It's like a circular area with the employees/staff all in the middle, and you kinda just walk around the counter to look at all of the pastries, gelato, sandwiches, etc.

One wall has the famous chocolate fountain, which honestly...was not as big as I had pictured. When people said it's the "biggest chocolate fountain in the world" I was thinking like straight up Willy Wonka status. This was totally not the case! Granted, it was a really nice glass display and I really liked that they had dark, milk, and white chocolate pouring in it, but I didn't think it was as mindblowing as I had expected it to be.

Along the circular walls they have a bunch of packaged goodies like chocolates, candies, hot chocolate mix, etc. They also have some fake cakes on display. I'm not sure if they actually bake fancy cakes here, but the displays were nice!

Unfortunately I had just eaten lunch and wasn't hungry at all, so I didn't any of the pastries although I had REALLY wanted to try some of them out! They didn't have a HUGE selection but some of them looked very tasty! I ended up getting a scoop of the dulce de leche gelato ($3+), and the Jean Philippe vanilla hot chocolate mix ($18).

The gelato was ok to me. Presentation wasn't the nicest, and also it was really soft...like to the point where it was basically melting! Gross. I wasn't impressed.

I made the hot chocolate mix when I came home, and I must say, this stuff is INCREDIBLE. It reminds me of the hot chocolate at Churros Calientes in Los Angeles. Super thick, rich, and decadent. omg, it is incredible. I'm glad it turned out well because $18 for only a few cups of hot chocolate was pretty pricey! Even more than Godiva and some other high end chocolate brands.

Overall, I liked Jean Philippe but I wasn't as blown away as I thought I was going to be. I definitely would return to actually try some of their pastries and maybe even their crepes (which are supposed to be amazing). 3 stars!

"I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know
I've got to know
What is this place that I have found? 
What's this?" - J. Skellington


The lunch bunch had wanted to enjoy Crepe Bar for many months, but had been previously scared away by reports of insane wait times and limited seating (sohwee Janee P).  Realizing that they took reservations, I set aside a table for 6 (really 8) about two weeks prior.  And boy, am I glad I did.

Walking in with Ann R, I didn't see an available table in the place... which is when I noticed J-WoW and Linh were occupying the table of highest honors... the reserved hi-top.

Realizing that our party of 4 was not getting any larger, we shifted to one side of the table to free up four contiguous chairs, because we're thoughtful and stuff.

Our Sep outing found us at Salut Kitchen Bar with the greatest waitress of all time: Keary.  I found her male counterpart: Cody.  This dude embodied the essence of Crepe Bar, fun, witty, timely, and able to turn down a bribe.  I'll be back with more cash...

Being our first time, the table took a while to lock in on palatable entrees, and Cody didn't rush, even though the place was packed.  Even better, since we were at a reserved table, we didn't have to order at the counter.

Dining in a group really is the only way to go.  I paid for one savory crepe, yet was a partaker in four amazing crepe combinations.  I couldn't pick a favorite, they were all so good!

And Cody had the sensibility to hold off on the sweet crepes until our party had completed round 1.  But what's this?  We were being treated to a sampling of paper thin cut radishes on cultured butter.  Hey, it could have been served with ignorant margarine, and I wouldn't have known the difference, but it was nice to feel so froufrou... because, you know.. I'm in the fast lane from LA to Tokyo.  Okay

Upon arrival, I knew J's dessert was going to take the cake.  That crepe was bananas, B.A.N.A.N.A.S.  That crepe was also nutella, N.U.T.E.L.L.A!

One more round of free resplendent Rollos and we were ready for our PhotoOp... which Cody and team made happen.  Overall, it was a FABULOUS lunch.  I'll award the Crepe Bar an: A + + + + + + + + + + !

And I didn't even have to use my AK, today was a good day

When Jared asked me what I wanted to do for my birthday, my reply was "dinner at Modern Steak."  So, that's exactly what we did... and I couldn't have asked for anything more!

We walked in and were immediately impressed with the extremely glamorous atmosphere.  Like, over the top, swanky, cool, but not quite overdone - almost like Vegas decor.  Ruthie was our server and she was fabulous!  I knew exactly what I wanted when I walked in... Jared took awhile longer.  But Ruthie was patient and sweet.  

I started with a dirty martini.  Jared ordered a glass of Cabernet a little while later.  We ended up ordering a bunch of stuff and sharing.  Yes, I was the birthday girl, but I did manage to snag a copy of our receipt.  This is what it looked like:

-Meris King Crab App - $24
-Asparagus - $9
-Rst Mushrooms - $10
-Ketel One Martini $13
-Chopped Salad - $9
-Chilean Sea Bass - $$35
-G_Manifesto (J's glass of wine) - $12
-12 ox Meyers NY Strip - $30
----------------------------------------
Total before tip - $152.21

I loved loved loved the chopped salad... lots of chopped up veggies and the perfect amount of Champagne vinaigrette.  And the beautiful thing about sharing at Modern Steak is that they split everything in the kitchen... and the portion sizes were still quite generous.  The king crab app is served warm and is melt in your mouth delicious but it literally comes in a jar full of a butter sauce so be forewarned.  The mushroom and asparagus sides were amazing also.  I honestly enjoyed every bite! In addition to what is listed on the bill, we enjoyed fresh baked potato and parmesan herb bread... delicious!  And the sea bass was fantastic and the steak was perfectly done per our request.  We skipped desert but ended up having another drink in the bar with friends.

What a perfect way to celebrate my birthday!

This will for sure be a go-to place for special occasions in the future.  

Oh, and if you go, make sure to pay a visit to the rest room - it's adorable!  Lastly, a hidden Yelp tip, courtesy of my dude: "if you buy $100 worth of FRC gift cards, you'll receive $120 worth in return. That is a pretty good immediate return on your money; much better than my stock portfolio... enjoy!"

FINALLY!! I've been waiting for this location to open f-o-r-e-v-e-r! With the location on the Strip closing, it couldn't have come at a better time. Walking in I saw the usual lines for adobada, asada, etc. You have to pay attention to the signs so you know what line to get in. I only ever get adobada, so I usually go straight to that line and hubby usually goes straight to the asada line. Sometimes I do feel like an asada taco, so hubby just gets mine when he gets his and that saves time and my food from getting cold. This last visit the line wasn't bad at all and the place had a good amount of heads in it. I only waited maybe 5 minutes in the adobada line and hubby waited less than that in his line. The wait time will no doubt change depending on the day at time, but the wait is worth it. I had an "Adobada Taco" ($2) and an "Adobada Mulas" ($4, I requested mine to me made on flour tortillas) and they were both so good! I asked for them both with pineapple and the dude hooked me up with a fair amount. The adobada has such great flavor and is very addicting! The taste just keeps you wanting more. They do have seating inside, but I noticed they are working on the other part of the building, so maybe they will add more seating there?? That will be good for those who like to eat inside, but a lot of people, myself included, just eat at our cars. They offer a variety of meats including asada, adobada, lengua, sesos, buche, tripa, suadero and chorizo. You can get any of these meats in a taco, mulas, tostadas, vampiro, sopes and even over fries. This place is absolutely legit when it comes to tacos and I'll be a regular for sure!

I had read some great Yelp reviews about this place and anything Keller has got to be good. So I figured when in Rome....

Or is it when at the Venetian do as the French do?  Very confusing. So as I swaggered out of the hotel in the morning to my trade show at the convention center I made a 6:30 dinner reservation for later that night. Oh man it smelled good, I almost stayed for breakfast.

After a long day at the convention center, it came time for dinner and man I couldn't wait to dive into Bouchon and do a French belly flop!  

I was immediately seated and my first (of many) waiters came to get me started off. I'm not much of a wino so I asked about the beer selection they had to offer and settled on a dark pumpkin spice number.

The 2nd was  bringing some bread shells and pistachio's  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouchon-las-vegas?select=w-8xsdNVt1DXAJhXaGNLsw#gQ8-2YOTknwRmAxwp1fVEw   as the 3rd waiter was showing me the menu. A newsprint deal that wrapped around the cutlery and napkin.  Crap! I told the waiter I don't have my glasses and can hardly see. The restaurant was dim and oozed romance too bad I was alone and blind. But waiter #3 to the rescue! He had a mini LED flashlight and I was able to read the menu and find some choices for my dinner!

STARTERS: 
French onion soup ... What else? I love FR Onion soup and Bouchon's soup is no slouch. It kicked ass! One of the best I've ever eaten. 4.5*****Stars http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=yXvxjUxdZxTXkv4b1pp6HA&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw
I finished every drop!
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_ncmx4f7Cpjk-12I0buXgQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

SALAD: ... Salade Marachre au Chvre Chaud
I can't even pronounce half of that, but it was a great fru fru salad with a tasty hunk of goat cheese and a delish red wine dressing, I ate every leaf of that bad boy. 4.****Stars
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=iK0praadEO0s1HXWN_P5iA&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

ENTREE: ... I ordered the Steak Frites. OMG that steak was heavenly! Melt in my mouth tender, juicy and  topped with caramelized shallots & matre d'htel butter (light garlic butter and caramelized onion medley). One of the best steaks I've ever eaten. The mountain of shoe string fries never got limp or soggy and were a perfect match for my steak. 5****Stars
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lilGGLerloMXwscZ4D2TCg&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

DESERT: ... I managed to strike up a conversation with the guy to my left, who it turns out was the Keller resturants IT guy who was visiting for work, he suggested the Poire Belle Hlne for my dessert. OK I'm game I said. The poached pear and hazelnut ice cream with a chocolate sauce was spot on. Too bad my camera died, but my tongue was working overtime on this insider tip. 5*****Stars

The restaurant is impeccable and the service here is top notch!  I had a great experience here and can't wait to come back again.

The chefs of today may well be the Van Goghs of our time. The care and precision of modern food presentation has made some of the creations on our plates incredible edible works of art.

The Japanese have the art of food presentation imbued in their food culture and they really put their heart and soul into making their food a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.

On my visit to Las Vegas last September, I was starting to feel a bit jaded about eating at the big corporate named restaurants on the strip and sought out a dinner spot more in keeping with being a locals' favourite. A Yelp search threw up Raku and a quick check with local Yelp friend Emily R confirmed that it was one of her favourite spots in town.

I was especially drawn to their kaiseki menu, where they create a unique menu based on the best ingredients available that day. A quick phone call secured  my dinner reservation and as requested on their website, I pre-ordered the kaiseki menu.

My taxi dropped outside Raku, which is located in a non-descipt small off-Strip mall. Any initial fears about the unprepossessing surroundings were soon dispelled by the warm welcome I received on entering the restaurant. There was a general hubbub of conviviality in the restaurant all evening with many customers obviously being happy regulars.

I bagged a seat at my favourite place to sit in a restaurant - at the counter watching the chefs at work. I was able to chat to the main chef all evening, who was very happy to engage and explain things to me about my unfolding gastronomic adventure.

Every dish was a work of art and there were quite a few new flavours for my palate to savour.

1. Mountain potato croquettes in dashi broth

2. Eight mini treasures, including creations such as tofu skin with wasabi and egg with sashimi

3. The house signature homemade silken tofu with salmon roe and homemade green tea salt and soya sauce

4. Fluke sashimi and liver with spring radish and grated onion dipped in ponzu sauce

5. Japanese/Spanish mackarel marinated in yuzu

6. Foie gras/egg custard/summer truffle served in an egg shell

7. Eel with shisho pepper

8. Uni with egg

9. Kobe beef on hot rock flamed with Hennessy XO sauce

10. Mixed tuna over rice

11. Panna cota

As you can see, the list of ingredients is like a who's who of the best ingredients to pass one's lips. Everything was a delight to eat.

 I love the way that Japanese cookery has given exquisite food presentation to the west but in return, the has given them ingredients like foie gras to cook with.

Service was always with a smile all evening.

The final touch of class came at the end of my meal when the chef confessed that normally, they don't do the kaiseki menu for only one person due to the large amount of prep time involved but as I was visiting from London, they made an exception.

Arigato, Aburiya Raku!

If you are looking for a really good Italian beef sandwich, you will find it here. Hubby and I stopped here for dinner and left full and satisfied. The inside is clean and there are plenty of tables. The employees were friendly and went over some of the menu items with us. They have Italian sausage, wraps, char-grilled burgers, hot dogs, salads, chili, tamales and fries, but my first time I had to try what they are famous for.

So, I ordered an "Italian Beef Sandwich" (regular Al) priced at $6.35 and added provolone and hot peppers for 50 cents each topping as well asked for the sandwich to be dipped. The bread really held up everything in it very well. Napkins are required when eating this sandwich dipped! The beef was tender and had good flavor and the peppers added a nice flavor to the sandwich. I also ordered a small "Cheddar Cheese Fries" priced at $3.85 and just thought they were average. Next time I am going to try them with different toppings. I liked that my food was made fresh in front of me. There isn't a drive-thru here, but if you are on a time crunch you can phone in your order for pick-up.

Maggiano's can sometimes feel like an endless party. 

I remember working in the Sears Tower when we first heard that Chili's (Brinker Intl') had bought the rights to the concept. In short, we were all bummed and felt they would goof it up. 

Well so much for our misgiving's, they sold off Macaroni Grill and made a decent attempt at allowing a little bit of Chicago's Italian scene to come alive for the rest of the country. 

Now don't get me wrong, this restaurant isn't perfect, as they were this past Friday evening. Yes, the Hostess station still seems confused as Laura M noted in her review last year. But where can you get a good meal for two, including appetizers, drinks and dessert, along with two especially prepared take home entrees for $55?  Really!

So we started with a glass of Merlot ($8.00), Soup ($3.95)and a Sausage appetizer ($8.50 which was a meal in itself, see photos).  For out entrees, we had their Classic Pasta for $12.95 and Mama's Lasagna $14.95.  Both were very good, though the entrees came first and our server's boss was indifferent at best while being distracted with a larger party.  Our server Hannah was outstanding, but so much for our easy going, pre-Christmas romantic meal.

For dessert, we shared two of their petite samplers for $3.50 each and coffee.  Their Apple Cobbler and dark chocolate Truffle balls were delicious and worth the trip.  We highly recommend them.  The regular sized dessert are good, but way over the top in size.

The bill came to $66.16, less a $10.00 off coupon from their email list.  So if we stopped here, it would be a fair $55.37 and not a bad deal, right?  But Maggiano's was still offering their buy two, take two home special. Nice! So we had enough for a second dinner sometime this week.  All and all, a delicious option. 

Enjoy!

There have been some changes at the DMV and I'm impressed. No more waiting in a long line yay! This new "Dash Pass" system worked well. With the Dash Pass you can text, call or go online and put yourself in the line without having to even go down to the DMV until it's your turn. They will text you with how many people are ahead of you and your estimated wait time and then they send you a command list so you can text back whenever you want to find out things like how long your current wait time is or to let them know if you need more time or even if you want to be taken out of the line. They text you with fair enough warning about when your turn is so you know when to arrive at the DMV and they let you know around that time what window you will need to go to. This is seriously awesome! I never would have thought I'd give the DMV 5 stars, but this new system really worked great for me twice now and the employees were even really friendly. I needed to renew my license so I had to go inside. Usually I avoid going inside since they have the DMV kiosks around town at a variety of places and it's so convenient to stop and register your car at the kiosk and you can do it at any hour. Sometimes though you just can't avoid having to go inside and now it's not that bad having to do so. The snack bar seems to get bigger and bigger and the line of people at it cracks me up, but hey why not grab a hot dog, nachos or cotton candy while at the DMV? When it came time to pay for my license renewal and the lady told me it would cost $41.25 I was shocked. I asked why so much now and she said that I would be getting a license good for 8 years. Say what?!?! Apparently those born even numbered years get the 8 year license and those in odd numbered years that renew will continue to receive the 4 year license until 2017 and then get the 8 year license after that. I kind of like the idea of not having to go back for 8 years a lot. I'm kind of surprised though since people do age differently among other things. I didn't have an issue with finding a parking spot like I have many times before and that was nice. I'm guessing the parking lot wasn't so bad because people are maybe using Dash Pass. I am happy to say that I had a quick and painless experience at the DMV.

Of all the Roberto's locations around Vegas this 'berto's location is one of the more consistent. It's located between Home Depot and Capriotti's. I have been coming here on my lunch break and more recently yesterday after a trip to Home Depot. The inside is clean and the guy at the register who has taken my order each time is friendly and actually goes over your order with you to make sure it's right if you customized anything. Like the other locations in town, you can get your chicken taco fix for only 99 cents on Wednesdays with a limit of 12 per person at that price.

The "Adobada Taco" at a cost of $2.75 each was good. It had marinated pork, guacamole and fresh salsa on it. There was meat falling out of the taco because they weren't stingy with the fillings. One thing I love here is the "Rolled Tacos" that come in different options. You can choose chicken, beef, sour ream, guacamole or just cheese. I don't like their guacamole that much, so I just got the rolled tacos (beef) with cheese. The rolled tacos with cheese cost $2.35 and are easily a meal by itself for me! So darn cheap and it tastes good. I love the "Carne Asada Fries" here, but only get them when I have someone to share with because it's such a huge portion. The asada fries cost $8.10 which is a great price for the size of it. We are talking fries, beans, sour cream, salsa, cheese and a pile of carne asada. It does come with guacamole, but I asked that it be left off. The menu here has many options for everyone. 

Inside there are plenty of tables and a small salsa and veggie bar. It has been filled with customers when I have been here, so I am going to start calling my lunch order in to avoid the wait time. If you are on a time crunch and it's Wednesday, calling in your order is smart as well because more people are there that day loading up on the 99 cent chicken tacos.

I have been hearing about the great cuisines in Phoenix and decided to come to this popular Italian restaurant to get a first impression. Located in a house with a spacious front patio, the interior encompassed a full bar area, breakout dining rooms, hardwood floors, and red brick walls. A friendly staff, constant foot traffic, and opportunities for people watching added to the festive, home-like atmosphere. I came here for dinner with a group of five that included fellow Yelpers Fia R, and Kurdy S, and decided to order antipasti and two pizzas to share. 

For antipasti, we went with the server's recommendation and ordered the Burrata ($14). The platter came with fresh mozzarella, balsamic drizzles, razor thin prosciutto, and toasted bread. I was impressed by the mozzarella, as it was light, airy, flavorful, and easy to spread across the warm crusty bread. The gentle flavors between the balsamic and prosciutto went hand in hand, as they complemented the mozzarella and bread without hindering it. This is a must get for those visiting for the first time. 

Next, we shared the half Diavola and half Magherita Pizza ($13). The Diavola was pleasantly spicy, as the pizza was inspired by the centrality of spicy salame embedded in mozzarella and tomato sauce. I also enjoyed the Margherita, as the light tasting tomato sauce, mozzarella, and fresh basil were spot on delicious. One noteworthy limitation regarding their pizza was the soft crust. It had a nice flavor but the texture was also flimsy and unexpected. 

Finally, we shared a half Procida and half Tartufata Pizza ($14). The Procida came with mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, Asian pears, chopped arugula, goat cheese and black pepper. The goat cheese flavor was very sharp, so I didn't particularly enjoy it as much as the other finesse tasting pizzas. The Tartufata arrived with mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and white truffle oil drizzles. I enjoyed the smoky flavor stemming from the pizza, but the combination of strong-flavored white truffle oil and cheese didn't go particularly well for me. 

3.5 stars. Overall, it was a delicious meal with plenty to rave about. I suggest interested diners to be aware of possible long waits, especially for those arriving later in the evening. Additionally, I also would not suggest this place to those who have a strong preference for thin, crispy crust pizzas. Their desserts were also limited to crepes, which we didn't care for on that particular evening. I must say, the place is great for dates, but the noise level can be pretty loud. Despite these limitations, our water was constantly refilled, and we were attended to frequently without much interruption. It was a great way to start a new journey in Phoenix. I hope to find the perfect crust in the area before coming back.

I read about this new attraction in the Las Vegas Sun and decided to make a trip down to Fremont Street to give it a try.  Since my Son was off of school today, I brought him along.  The attraction is located on the far East side of Fremont Street, which is closest to Las Vegas Blvd.  The best place to park is the parking garage on the corner of Fremont Street & Las Vegas Blvd.  It's pretty cheap for parking....we were there for 2 hours and paid $3.

I posted a video on YouTube if you want to see the experience:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxzOl3TXeJs

The ticket office for this attraction is on the Fremont Street level next to the Walgreens.  Tickets are $15 each for 1 ride, $25 for 2 rides, $30 for 3 rides....that's per person.  In other words, 3 people riding once will pay $45 total.....capiche?  Cool....

Since we didn't know if we'd enjoy it, we paid $15 each for the single ride.  We should have paid $30 each for the 3 pack.....because we ended up riding a 2nd time.  The girl was cool and only charged us $10 each for the 2nd ride as if we paid for the 2 pack....not sure she'll hook you up like that though, so don't expect that.  (see pics for full price list and all day discount pricing)

The launch pad is I think 60 ft in the air and you access it by going to the 5th floor (roof) of the parking garage, which is the same building the ticket office is located.  We made our way up there and waited in line.  Everyone in line was pretty nervous, including myself.  I'm not a fan of heights, but wanted to give this a try.  My Son was pretty brave....he wasn't nervous at all....until we got up to the edge of the platform.

You get strapped into a harness and get some instruction.  Here are some tips:

- Don't wear flip flops or sandals with no ankle straps....if you do, they'll make you take them off and put them in a netted bag.

- Purses or bags without secure straps will not be allowed on the ride.

- Don't wear anything with loose pockets or if you do, don't put anything in them because it could fly out easily.

- Don't wear loose sunglasses.  They could fly of easily with the airflow generated during the ride.

- They don't allow pictures to be taken during the ride, for obvious reasons...ie your camera could slip out of your hands and seriously injure someone on the ground.

It sounds like a lot of rules, but it's common sense.  Knowing this in advance will save you a trip back to your car or hotel room.

The zipline can handle groups up to 4 people at one time.  A quick hint if you want to get on/off the ride fast.....ride as a single.  They're always looking for a single to fill up a group of three, which happened often while we were there.

We were nervous on the final walk up the stairs to the launch pad....when you get up there the instructor will attach you to a cable until you're secured on the zipline.  Each person will be hooked up to the zipline and given instructions on what to do.  I admit, I was nervous all the way up until the launch of our 1st ride.  It looks much higher from the launch pad than from the ground.

After everyone is given instructions, he releases the safety clip and you lift up your legs and your body weight launches you down the zipline.  If you want to go really fast, tuck your knees up to your chest like a cannon ball dive in a pool.....you'll pick up speed right away.  If you stay in this position, you'll maximize your speed all the way through the ride.....this was a tip given to us by the instructor.

The ride itself is very fun.....you feel like you're flying above everyone, because you are.  It was very exhilarating and I felt free.  The landing is the roughest part.....you slam into a padded stopping mechanism and your momentum swings you up quickly while an employee secures your line with a rope.  I was amazed at how fast we came in on the landing.....the 2nd time around I nailed the employee in the shoulder with my knee....I'm surprised he didn't go down.  He said it happens all day long.....I wouldn't want his job.

After your ride, you get your picture taken and you have the option to purchase pictures of your ride.....prices are $10 each for the 1st 2 pics, then $5 a pic after that.  I paid for 4 pics since we couldn't take any on the ride itself.....nice to have as a souvenir for the 1st time, won't pay for it again though.  I didn't post those pics because I don't have a scanner.  The pics I posted of people on the zipline were other riders.  The pics from the launch pad was from my perspective....I put the camera away just before launch.

Overall, it was an exhilarating ride and we had a blast.

Will we return?  There's no doubt about it.....I'm taking all of my friends who visit from out of town to ride.

YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!! FINALLY! This location has been set to be a Tommy's for a longggggg time, but I guess there was an issue with the billboard being too close to the building or something. Who cares why it is open now!!!!!

There isn't much parking directly out front of this Tommy's (there is handicapped parking) however this Tommy's shares the whole parking lot with the rest of the shopping center and it isn't a far walk at all. If you are a true Tommy's fan the few extra steps wont kill you and since you are likely to be eating chili here you can use those few extra steps! There is also a drive-thru. It appears that because the drive-thru has little space that they only put in the few spots up front to detour accidents and want customers to park in the shared shopping center spaces.

It didn't surprise me to see this place packed when I walked in. There was a long line of hungry customers. I got in line while hubby kept an eye out to snag a table. The girl who took my order was very friendly and repeated my order to make sure it was right. I then made my way to fill up our drinks while the order was being made and grab some good ole Tommy's napkins. The napkins here are more like paper towels and necessary when eating here! 

The food was ready and I was ready to dig in! I ordered a #4 "Chili Cheese Dog, Fries and drink" priced at $8.55 after requesting my drink be a large and adding chili, cheese, mustard and onion to the fries. Yum! I had to cut the chili dog in half and share it because it was hearty. The fries were delicious and held up the chili and other toppings perfectly. Hubby ordered the "Caliente Burger Combo" and gobbled it up. Our friend ordered a "Chili Tamale" priced at $3.25 and he really enjoyed it. We left very full and satisfied! 

Anybody who has been to the original location at Beverly and Rampart knows the nostalgia that goes with that location. There will never be another like it, but we can certainly be thankful to have a location right here in Las Vegas to go to and make memories. Thank You Tommy's for branching out of California and making your presence in Nevada!  

 "If you don't see the shack - take it back!"

The buffet at the Wynn didn't excite me as much as I wanted.  I went there for lunch after reading the list of food selections posted on a sign at the entrance.  Everything seemed to sound better than it tasted, and nothing really stood out as spectacular or memorable.

I started out pretty lightly taking just three items (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=5jI7M5Be86FJFVm9Aeis-g), and I only enjoyed one.  That's approximately what I experienced throughout the meal, for every one item I liked there were always two that I didn't like.  The Kobe beef slider looked great, but the patty was ice cold when I bit into it.  The potstickers had big chunks of inedible pork fat.  The roasted strip loin was very good.  The slice I had was slightly overcooked for my preference, but it was tender, juicy and had good beef flavor.

The beef flank steak was also good.  Sliced thick with a sweet marinade, most of the cuts were overcooked by sitting under the heat lamp, but it had good flavor.  I love fish, but the fish here was awful.  The sea bass was not fresh and crumbled instead of flaked.  The grilled salmon was only partially cooked as I could see and taste the frozen core within.  The red snapper tasted bland.

I did find a pasta dish to my liking.  The Pappadella had flat noodles in a creamy tomato sauce and was laden with big chunks of shrimp.  On the other hand the lump crab mac 'n' cheese was creamy and cheesy but what little crab meat was already picked off.  The pizza tasted like crap I can buy at Sbarro and the sushi simply isn't worth mentioning.  I tried more than half of what was offered, and when nothing really wowed me I moved along to the desserts.

The decadent Oreo Mousse Cake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=-fSEZvHdYCxfipPsAjtONg) was very chocolately, very rich and very sweet even for my chocoholic taste.  I love mint and I tried the Mint Chocolate Mousse (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=xtPuLkTf4GfltHy12Mpsow).  The mint mousse was thick and gummy, but the bottom layer of chocolate cake was very moist.  It was very much like eating toothpaste on top of chocolate cake!

The Blueberry Tart (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=9cExiCHnu3lfOCwVZwt7EQ) was good.  It was very light and not too sweet with a citrus mousse on top of thin shortbread and a light film of blueberry jam in between.  I liked the Tapioca Pearl Mousse with Mango and Lychee (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=9cnd5txt44wiE2US_S8oUw) also.  Soft mini tapioca balls are folded into a light mousse and layered over a mango flavored gelatin with a strip of lychee fruit inside.  I liked the Lime Mousse with Raspberry Gelle (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=wPy6KDF48APMGm3faAecJw) also, but more so because it was tart.  There is a small piece of sponge cake sandwiched in between the tart lime mousse and the sour raspberry gelatin.

If the only differences between lunch and dinner are the price and the frozen crab legs I think I'll pass on The Buffet at The Wynn.

Prior to dining, my only familiarity with the Katsuya name was from TMZ.  If I were making half a milly per TV episode, this would be in my regular dining rotation too!  The menu's prices are on par with Nobu, Sushi Roku or Blue Ribbon.  

At least those restaurants offer some kind of a chic atmosphere.  Katsuya felt like an upscale diner with a sushi bar plunked in the middle.  The bright lighting, noise from the casino and the constant yelling of "Irashaimase!" over and over and over by employees made this a decisively unsexy spot.  I can't imagine tourists would want this kind of setting for a pricey sushi meal on the strip.  If a booth at Nobu's outpost at Caesars Palace is Kate Upton, it's kind of Rosie O'Donnell here.  Power lunches or corporate dinners? Yes.  Anniversary dinners or bachelorette parties? No!  

For those reasons, my wife and I chose to sit at the bar since the people working there looked like they were having a good time.  All them were super nice and knowledgeable of all things Katsuya. They also made some awesome cocktails to boot.  I loved the "Sahara Cooler" which consisted of Ketel One Oranje vodka, Aperol, passion-fruit pure, fresh lime juice, and Stiegl Radler Grapefruit beer.  That was instant refreshment.  One of the bartenders, whose name escapes me but I remember being a Chargers/Eagles fan, created a wonderful version of a prickly pear cocktail for my wife. 

The plan was to not order items we could get at local, off the strip Japanese spots like Kyara or Raku.  So $8 edamame (shockingly saw lots of people order this), anything from the robata grill ($12 for asparagus with no bacon) and $11 karaage were out of the question.  

Want to know what was?  Rare Wagyu filet with foie gras on top!  So tender and soooo decadent, it was like a story I never wanted to end.  The plum wine sauce reduction really added a nice balance.  Lobster and truffle chawanmushi was another dish I don't see everyday.  Despite the small portion being steamed in a Japanese tea cup, I thought it tasted great and would probably order it again.  Dig in from the bottom for maximum truffle taste.

I thought the Wagyu sashimi seared with hot oil and topped with chives and ginger was very good too.  The oil they used made it taste more like a Chinese dish which was a nice little changeup from the other beef dish.  Seared tuna with Japanese salsa was equally as good.  The high quality of the fish was easy to see as well as taste.

My wife was still hungry and had her eye on the "Wafu Carbonara" which was simply described as "slow-cooked bacon, soy reduction, and soft poached egg".  I tried to talk her out of it since she makes a great version of this dish at home.  Unsurprisingly, I lost that battle.  One of the bartenders assured us this was something worth having and she was right.  The huge chunks of pork belly with bonito flakes and sauce/egg mix just oozing over the ramen noodles was a hearty dish and a nice ending to the meal.

**Review #600: The single best meal I've ever experienced**

To celebrate our one year wedding anniversary, my wife and I ate a feast fit for  royalty at Chef Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak. 

Located inside the MGM Grand, Craftsteak is a dimly lit, elegantly decorated high end steak house. 

The menu at CS is littered with amazing sounding salads, sides, steaks, seafood, desserts and more. Instead of trying one or two things, my wife and I decided to make this meal a memorable one and partake in their Domestic Wagyu tasting, which included a grand total of FOURTEEN dishes in three courses.

Farmers Market Fruit Plate  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=iPcZn31A-sZQZdAPIT5Yzw

Everything and I mean EVERYTHING we ate was phenomenal. Not one dish disappointed me. I've had many meals in my life and this one now ranks as the biggest and best yet. The salads were great. The meat was juicy and melted in my mouth. The sides were fantastic and the desserts were mind blowing. I did have some favorites, which I'll list below. 
My favorite dishes in the first course were the tartare and the warm Frise salad.
My favorite dishes in the second course were the Wagyu ribeye and the Yukon Gold Puree (best mashed potatoes EVER). 
My favorite dessert was the cinnamon monkey bread.

The service here was top notch. We had two separate servers, both of whom were friendly and attentive. Both answered any questions we asked and trust me, we had a few.  

The price for the Wagyu tasting menu was $140 a person, which was not bad considering the massive amount of incredible food we received. In all honesty, I could not afford to do this on a weekly (or even monthly) basis but since I got lucky the night before at the Roulette tables, this meal only set me back about thirty dollars of my own money. Thanks, Vegas. 

If you ever have the opportunity to dine at Craftsteak, even if you can't afford a steak tasting (tastings start at $100 a person), then just order off their regular menu. I can't highly recommend Craftsteak enough. This truly was THE BEST meal I've ever had in my entire life.

Short review: This is the best steakhouse in Vegas right now.  I have been to every other place in town and Gordon Ramsay Steak is #1 with a bullet!  Carnevino? Botero? Cut? Stripsteak? Old Homestead? They've all taken a backseat.

Longer review:

I made a reservation a month in advance for my wife's birthday as this is probably the hottest restaurant on the strip at the moment.  We had heard so many great things and were already foaming at the mouth as we circled the faux Arc de Triomphe.

The entrance was cool.  Is this what modern London restaurants look like?  I wouldn't know since I'd just eat Indian if I were there.  All the hostesses looked like they were ready to redo Robert Palmer's "Addicted to Love" video at a drop of a hat.  Now that everyone under 25 years old has no idea what I am referring to...on to the food!

We had drinks at the bar while we waited for the table.  I got a gin martini which was accompanied by a very tasty green olive stuffed with bacon and cheese and the wife got the "English Garden" cocktail.  That was a terrific drink as well and very refreshing.  The Ipad cocktail menus were neat to zip through and certainly beat flipping pages.  

Finally get seated, order a bottle of red and the wife goes with the "Sonoma Farms Foie Gras" with strawberry jam, bacon bits and buttered slices of English muffin.  WOWOWOWOW!  I've eaten some duck liver in my life but never like this.  Whoever came up with this creation deserves an award!  I'd like to have this for breakfast 3 times a week.  How many points is this on Weight Watchers?  

I went with the "Maine Lobster" which was stuffed with chorizo, poached in butter with cream and corn.  That was great as well but all I wanted to do was trade it in for more foie gras.  

My wife always gets filet mignon so I was prepared to get the beef wellington but she threw me a curve and actually went wellington.  I knew that the famed butcher Pat LaFrieda from NYC provided all the beef cuts here.  Great meat for sure but we had been to Old Homestead not too long before and thought it might taste kind of the same.  How freakin wrong I was!!  I was ridiculously taken aback upon my first bite of the ribeye.  This is the same cut of ribeye that Old Homestead gets?  Really??  It was mindblowing how different it was seasoned and prepared.  I was in a beef trance and loved every bite.  My wife really liked the beef wellington and the one bite I had was scrumptious but I was too wrapped up in the monster cut in front of me to focus on anything else :P

We had the standard creamed spinach and mac & cheese for sides and both were done perfectly.  Service was A+ too.  Too full for dessert.  

Other notes:

- I stopped watching "Hell's Kitchen" a few years ago since it seemed like the same season every year but the winner from the most recent season started at the restaurant last week.  She was open to photos and autographs to whoever wanted them.  

- Ordering fish at a place that specializes in steak is like ordering a hamburger in a Chinese restaurant.  I don't get it.

- Don't forget your Caesars Entertainment players card.  You'll save a wee bit on dinner.

After seeing so many of my friends check in to this place and proceeded to give it no less than 4 stars, I knew it had to be good. Just the pictures alone made my gut instinct (also known as my stomach growling and my mouth drooling) tell me it was gonna be good!

So I take my wife here to dinner on a late Friday afternoon around 5. We are greeted warmly and are seated immediately. Nice place. Very spacious. They even have a little stage for bands to perform I assume. Before we even see our server, there was already another guy putting down a basket of chips, salsa, and bean dip on our table. Talk about calming down a hungry customer! What an awesome feeling it is to chow down on some delicious chips and salsa while trying to decide what wonderful menu item(s) to order. Besides the chips and salsa, they also give you a cup of fideo soup before your entre comes out. 

So we go with Juan's Flaming Combo for 2. It's your choice of two meats (Chicken, Steak, or Pork. Shrimp is a dollar extra), grilled with onions, green and red peppers on a sizzling fajita skillet. We chose Steak and Shrimp. When they bring it out, not only is it sizzling, but they throw some alcohol on top of it (some kind of tequila I think) and ignite it with a lighter. Which at this point makes you understand why they call this place "Juan's Flaming Fajitas and Cantina". This dish comes with your choice of rice, beans, and pico de gallo or sour cream, guacamole, and sauted veggies. I went with the first choice while my wife went for the second so we can try all options. Turns out all items are very good. Of course to round it out you get either flour or corn tortillas because what is a fajita without the tortilla? It's like having a gun with no bullets or brushing your teeth with no toothpaste. It just wont work without it. 

As for the service, we didn't have to ask for anything. One thing that really stood out was that even though our server was doing an excellent job already, another server from another area saw me finish my water and as I was putting the empty glass at the edge of the table, she proceeded to fill it with fresh water. Wow! I like the fact that other servers are not just looking after their own area, but are more than willing to help out their fellow servers when it comes to simple things like refilling water glasses. Bravo to whoever does the customer service training at this place. Keep up the good work for im sure every customer will notice these things.

So any time I see or hear of anything fajita, I will automatically think of Juan's Flaming Fajitas! Im looking forward to bringing my friends and family here! Ole!

Honey Salt is the newest restaurant to open in Summerlin, tucked away in the corner suite that was once occupied by Nora's Wine Bar at the NW corner of Rampart and Charleston.  Offering a menu inspired by comfort food with farm to table ingredients, as well as a seasonal cocktail menu, I can easily see this restaurant becoming a locals favorite.

There are three menus that are available depending on the time of day you dine in.  Lunch is served from 11:30am - 3:00pm (http://honeysalt.com/menus/lunch-menu/), dinner is served from 5:00pm till closing (http://honeysalt.com/menus/dinner-menu/), and there is an "in-between" menu served between lunch and dinner that seems to be a scaled back offering of the lunch options.  I stopped in during lunch and dined at the bar, where I started with a Midnight Rambler: a specialty cocktail made with bourbon, bitters, honey and orange peel.  The honey added just the right amount of sweetness to balance out the drink without overpowering the bourbon; my kind of drink!

For lunch I had their Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich: creamy slaw, durkees dressing, brioche roll, served with a chopped salad (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/honey-salt-las-vegas?select=lQ4mQi9Nm-ycsd6-r2kDIQ#lQ4mQi9Nm-ycsd6-r2kDIQ).  This is a very, very good chicken sandwich.  There are two pieces of chicken that are lightly breaded and very juicy, which gets complimented by pickled and mustard flavors from the other ingredients.  It's one of those dishes that is so good that I'll have to convince myself to order something else the next time I visit...

A big surprise was the salad that is served with this sandwich.  Don't let the "chopped salad" description fool you, it's a salad served with cubed cheddar, edamame, carrots, radishes, avocado and I think kale.  Very good salad that came together well texturally; I would order this on its own if I wanted a lighter meal.

Overall Honey Salt screams quality.  I'm pretty darn sure this review will get bumped to 5-stars after I try some more things on the menu.  Will they be successful?  Time will tell.  Or you could listen to me and eat there now, before word spreads and you're no longer able to walk in without having to wait for a table.

I have been stopping by here for lunch and like the subs I have had. Inside is very clean and the employees are friendly and say hello when I walk in. They have plenty of tables if you want to eat inside, but I get my food to-go. The meat is sliced fresh and the sandwiches are made to order. Sometimes they can get busy around lunch time and since I'm on a time limit for lunch, I just call in my order for pick up so that it's ready when I arrive. 

Hook and Ladder - A medium costs $5.99 and includes a pickle. The sub has smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham and monterey jack cheese. I like it "fully involved" which means it comes with deli mustard, mayo, onion, lettuce and tomato. Per my request they leave the lettuce off. The subs are served hot and this sub is my favorite of them all. Usually I don't like deli mustard, but there is something about it on this particular sub that just makes it taste great. 

Firehouse Meatball - A large costs $8.49 and depending on your appetite could be shared between two people. This sub has Italian meatballs, provolone, marinara and Italian seasonings. I usually order this one "sweet and spicy" which means they add pepper sauce and red pepper flakes. I really like this meatball sub a lot. It's always hot, the bread good, meatballs good, melted cheese good, but..... there is a consistency issue with the taste of the sweet and spicy part. Sometimes it's just right and sometimes they put so much pepper sauce that it's too hot. When this sub is good it's very good, but when it's drenched in pepper sauce it's hard to taste anything else. 

The medium sub is just perfect for my appetite. If you are the type like my husband who eats 1 footers, you might want to order the large sandwich. They also offer catering.

I've read that brevity is the soul of wit...

Brevity is also a wonderful thing when it comes to the waiting time for your dinner of Italian peasant food...pizza:)

Brevity is not Pizzeria Bianco's strong suit...(nor mine, in writing reviews, but we're not talking about me:)

After my second visit in 4 years (and 4th visit overall), I'm trying to figure out what PB's strong suit is:(...public relations and marketing, perhaps?

Creating the "Pizza Placebo Effect"?

I generally try not to knowingly go anyplace that aggravates me, whether it's for dining, for drinking, for entertainment, for using the restroom...really for pretty much anything:)

So why were we back at PB after a good solid 4 year run of avoiding this particular aggravation?   

Other people, that's why:)

Other people wanted to go to PB...other people wanted to try the Wiseguy and the Marghareta and see Chris's oven and have mozzarella cheese and what not... and so the Beautiful Carin (who has the patience of a saint) and I took them out to PB the other evening...well, it was evening when  we started:(

We went...we waited...we had some pizza...and it was pretty average artisan pizza...

Was it the worst pizza I've ever eaten?...oh no...'sup, Totino's?

Was it the best pizza that I can remember eating?...oh no...How you doin' Flying Pie in Portland and Di Fara in Brooklyn?

Is PB worth the aggravation?...Sadly, not for me:(

For me, it's hard to overlook the attitude at the door, and the "you're barely worthy of eating here" attitudes of the servers (both in Bar Bianco and Pizzeria Bianco), as I try to enjoy my evening.

I understand that all the kids "assisting Chris" at PB think they're pretty special to be working at PB and all...but...it's a pizza joint...would it hurt them to at least try to be personable and pleasant?

It's also hard for me to overlook the multi-hour wait to dine at PB (and, truth be told, we've been here before...we did come expecting a wait...we were prepared to have wine and relax...I even had my flask, so I had a scotch and tried to relax)...still 3  1/2 hours...for pizza?

I can fly  1/2 way to NYC in the time it takes to get a table (and the flight attendants on Continental are sweet and pleasant to me...feed me drinks in 1st class...you know...they make me feel appreciated:)

And speaking of "appreciated"...it's hard for me to overlook the lack of appreciation we've encountered at PB:(

The few times we've been to PB, the staff hasn't seemed to be in a pleasant mood...very quick to tell us "the rules of PB" and eager to let us know that if we weren't good little customers, there were 50 more people in line that would happy to take our places:(

You know what... they are right...there were 50 more people that would have loved to see us leave and they would have moved up in the queue.

But it's obnoxious of the folks at PB to make that the overriding theme of the evening and it belies any pretense that they might try to concoct about "customer service" and being the "the best possible pizza experience for each customer"...the attitude of "we're PB and you're not" is pervasive and unpleasant:(

And frankly, when I spend well over $200 for pizza, wine and cheese for 4 in the course of a 3+hour wait, get a rush job on the very late dinner and a lamentable lack of service from the waiter (who's busy chatting with friends or "regulars" at the counter)...well, it causes me aggravation.

But the good news is that I won't be back for another 4 years...less aggravation for me and more spaces in the line at the door:)

I purchased a $10 for $20 groupon so we could try this place out for dinner. Upon walking in we were greeted and right away offered a sample of their Huli Huli Chicken and Kalua Pig. Both of these were equally good, but I really loved the Huli Huli Chicken. After reading the menu board I decided to go with the "3 Tacos" with 2 on flour tortillas and 1 on crispy corn. I was torn on which meat to choose for my tacos, so the man behind the counter said I could mix and match them. Cool! I ended up going with chicken, pig and steak tacos and paying the extra $1.35 for guac on them. A lot of places would charge for the guacamole per taco, but I was just charged the 1 price and got a generous portion on all 3 tacos. The tacos were delicious! The charred pineapple verde adds a nice flavor addition, the meat is tender and has great flavor, the tortilla was soft and good and the price was right for what I got. The guacamole is worth buying just as a side to have with chips, but I have to admit that if there was some sort of Hawaiian pink salt in it, I didn't see it or taste anything except for fresh yummy guac. Hubby had a "Pulehu Steak Burrito" and loved it, but found the size to be too small for his hungry appetite. I still had half of a taco left so I was very fulfilled! So full that I didn't even taste a bite of the "Cheese Quesadilla" priced at $2.50 (meat extra) that we also ordered. 

I also had to make room for dessert later because I got a bag of "Coconut Bark" priced at $3.50 to try. Whoa!! This stuff is addicting! I have never had anything like it before and honestly don't even know for sure what all was in it. It seems like a saltine cracker with a layer of brown sugar or caramel and then a layer of chocolate and coconut. Whatever it is, I want more! 

You can eat inside, outside or even grab some grub from their drive-thru.

I hadn't been to this place in over 12 years so I decided to take hubby to try it out and see if it was still any good. There is no drive-thru, this is a small little building where you walk-up and place your order. If there is actual parking for this place someone let me know because it seems people still just pull up along the curb, hop out and order, get their food then roll out. I just figure the parking situation adds adventure to the experience ha! There is seating right outside of the ordering window which is nice, if mother nature is being nice :)

As I walked up to the window I immediately recognized the owner. He is a character for sure! He let me know he was celebrating 18 years in the same location. I told him I had read in the Review Journal a few years back that Celine Dion liked to stop at Hot Dog Heaven for a hot dog on her way home. The owner had an immediate response that had both my husband and myself laughing so hard! I'd repeat what he said, but it might not be appropriate so just trust me it was hilarious or ask yourself next time you stop by! 

So I ordered a "Vienna All Beef Hot Dog" priced at $2.79 on the menu board, but I was charged $2.89 before taxes. It's only 10 cents, but still the prices should be listed correctly. I asked for mine loaded so it came on a poppy seed bun and had a pickle, onions, tomatoes, sport peppers and true green relish. I asked for the celery salt to be left off.  This hot dog was as good as I remembered it. It really is a simple thing yet hits the spot. I also ordered "Chili Cheese Fries" priced at $4.19 and the chili cheese fries only come in one size unlike the plain fries. The chili cheese fries can easily be shared between 2 or more people. The chili is made from scratch and being a Chicago joint there is no beans in the chili. The chili was pretty good, but not as good as Original Tommy's. The fries are nice and fat so they hold up the chili and cheese nicely. Hubby ordered a "Maxwell Street Style Polish Dog" that was priced on the menu at $4 and some change, yet I was charged $5.19 for it before tax. Look, I really don't mind paying whatever you are charging if it is fair, but it needs to be posted correctly or it is just misleading and people will wonder about shadiness. 

They serve Coca-Cola here as well Barq's root beer if that is your thing.

They only take CA$H MONEY for payment, so stop at a bank or have some cash on you because cash is king at this place.

Bacchanal Buffet, the highly touted buffet in Las Vegas I coveted. Family and friends have indulged. It was my turn =)

No wait time! Wednesday at 6pm. YES!!

I was seated immediately and my drink order placed. It was time to indulge. 

I scoped out each station, taking mental notes of what looked good. 
I decided on the seafood station for my first plate. 
My second plate was from the carving station (BBQ & Prime Rib this evening)
My third plate was from the cheese & cured meat station. 
Last but not the least, Dessert. 

My food rating of each dish:
GREAT DISHES
*Lamb Chops - tender, perfectly cooked medium rare, yum!! Get the mint jelly too. 
*Shrimp Cocktail - Big pieces of shrimp. Not over cooked like most shrimp cocktails, perfect. 
*Goat cheese with fig - wow, wow, WOW!
*Mushroom & Truffle Soup - this was decadent, creamy with that earthy richness, Yum!!

GOOD DISHES
*Oyster Shooter - the oyster was just okay, but the liquid it came in was delicious. Cucumber juice?
*Brisket - I asked for the fatty part, yum!  Melds in you mouth goodness. I didn't see any BBQ sauce though. 
*Polenta - the only thing I got from the Italian station. 
*Wagyu Slider - delicious. It would have been better with mayo. (Which I found after I ate it)
*Mango Pudding - the coconut jelly made this dish good!!
*Coconut Calamansi Dacqoise - I don't know what a "Dacqoise" is, but it was like a macaron to me. Lol. 
*Beignet - great with coffee, just too sweet. 

OKAY DISHES
*Raw Oyster - it would have been better if it was sucked better. The oyster was still attached to the shell and a lot of shell bits in the oyster itself. 
*Prime Rib - the medium rare parts were good, other parts were very chewy. 
*Creme Brle - not too sweet, yum. 
*Goat cheese with basil - good flavor!!

BAD DISHES
*BBQ Pork Spare Ribs - too salty & not tender. 
*Jonah Crab Claws - even though they were pre cracked, it was still hard to eat. The crab meat was stuck to the shell. Over cooked. 
*Mint Gelato - first gelato I asked for was pistachio, I got "Mint" instead. Since I ask for 3 other flavors, by the time I got to my table, the mint had started to melt and ruined the other 3. Oh, I don't like mint ice cream / gelato. 

Info: The plates are HOT. Super hot. Be careful. If you want cold plates, get them from the salad station. 

Service was good. 

Suggestions: it was hard to get some of the dishes. For example the soups. The clearance between the pot and the shelves on top of it was too low. It was hard not to spill the soup because the ladle was hitting the shelving. 

The flow of some of the food station was also a bit off for me.

I didn't get anything from the Chinese & Mexican stations, I was too full. Lol. 

The food here was good, I definitely indulged, okay, over indulged. Lol. 

Solid 4 Stars. 
Try it for yourself and decide.

I was debating a 3 or 4 star for this place on my drive home.  I decided this place is certainly over the 3.5 star mark, so 4 star it is.

First, you will find that the Cleaver Koi is on the west side of Central/Lite Rail in a small copper/bronze colored building that has a small breezeway down the middle.  The sign out front is small.  You should turn on/down (don't U turn) Glenrosa St or if you U-turn, be sure to turn into their parking lot at the FIRST left turn (just north of the building) you get to.  If you try that second turn, you will be turning into the wrong parking lot and you will have to circle around on Central and come back again.  Don't ask me how I know this.  But I will say it could be helpful information for those who are not familiar with the area.

Cleaver Koi is a very "neat/cute" space.  I LOVE the ambiance, the look and feel of the restaurant.  It has an atmosphere that is right on par with Central Phoenix, hipster, chic, cool.  I stopped in there today, a Saturday, for lunch. The cleaver Koi has been open about 2 months, so there wasn't a crowd, but the server mentioned that the day before on a Friday, they were completely packed pretty much the entire lunch and dinner service.  So as the masses are finding out about this place, it is filling up like good CenPho restaurants do.

My friend and I ordered a variety of things.  Here's my take on a few of memorable things.

My favorite item was the "Pig Face" dumplings!!!  Amazingly delicious and savory with an appropriate level of spice.  Tender dumplings that practically melt in your mouth. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#TwNmKVIhbSWHQgm22KMfQw

We also tried the following notable things:
Salt and Pepper Shrimp:  worth having again.  I was pleased with the size and amount of this dish.  I would have had that as an entre.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#QJLxMqO42DMuun5bZzDsoA

Peking Duck Steamed Bun:  Oh man, the duck is very good!  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#uy69wuSn45EnO-Z0sUj88Q

I will definitely come back here for HH when I get the opportunity.  I originally planned to have the roasted pork ramen, but I ended up ordering the Massaman Noodles.  I was satisfied with it, but I ordered it thinking that the noodles would be in a more brothy/soup-like base.  but this dish is certainly a curry (gravy) texture (as the menu stated) and the dish could be eaten with chopsticks.

Oh, they have the cutest crafted cocktail menu... there's one drink "Hey Bartender"... you tell them the spirit and the flavor choice you like... the bartender creates a drink just for you.  It worked twice for us!  Awesome, loved it.

It's hard to look at life the same way after you've stayed at the Skylofts. We're talking about two story lofts, unbelievably luxurious amenities, just gorgeous designs at every corner, and being able to get anything you want or need with just one phone call.

Everyone here leaves a 5 star review because it's true, the Skylofts give you a true 5 star feeling. At $10,000 a night, it better! Now, keep in mind, I didn't pay that fee. I simply know somebody who gets sponsored by MGM Grand and he extended his generosity to me. Some reviewers claim the Skylofts are worth every penny. Well, even my friend would say that if he had to pay the full fee, it would NOT be worth every penny. If you could have an incredible double suite at Caesar's Palace for $800, who wouldn't do that instead of spending 10 grand?

Like most people who dine at The French Laundry, post the picture of their bill in a very braggadocious manner, and claim it's worth every penny, they usually don't genuinely mean it. Instead, what they're really saying is, "This was insanely expensive and very possibly overpriced. In an attempt to make myself feel better, I will act as if I paid for this comfortably and without a shred of regret, as if my experience was so moving that I would do this as often as financially possible. Here, please act as if you care about this picture of the tab any more than I would care if you posted one. Envy me. Please, envy me. It'll give me the validation I need." 

Now, before I sound too cynical, I should note that I don't mind people who live flashy lives, so long as they earned their possessions from their own work. Hey, if that's what makes you happy, I'm happy. Just try not to unnecessarily rub it in my face. Now, I'll reiterate that there's so much to love at the Skylofts. We're talking private elevators, pool tables, movie rooms, the best personal service, access to private restaurants, and anything you'd expect if you were part of the 1%. There's a reason I got disillusioned and materialistic from Vegas. And, quite surprisingly, the Skylofts was not a huge part of that. It was more from the food destinations, the overall treatment, and the carefree spending of money that left a real impression. In other words, it was the people I was with and their behaviors that impacted me the most, not a physical place. Would I pay $10,000 a night for a Skyloft? Hell no. But was it one of the best experiences of my life? Hell yes. 

To having great friends. And hopefully enjoying life's great experiences without getting too ripped off. After all, I still want to dine at The French Laundry. But I doubt I'll pay for the preposterous $150 corkage fee.

Perched atop the 64th floor of the majestic Hotel at Mandalay, Mix boasts some of the best views of the south strip in Vegas. Once you set foot inside the lavish ivory themed dining room, you know you're in an Alain Ducasse restaurant. The space simply oozes the charm and elegance of his signature opulent style reminiscent of the dining room at the Hotel Plaza Athne in Paris.  The glitz and glamour of Vegas is also quite apparent and you can't help but be dazzled by the contemporary and elegant atmosphere that envelops you.

With the beautiful weather I had been  experiencing over the weekend, I opted for patio seating with a direct view of the Vegas strip below. 

After glancing through the menu, I decided  to try Chef Ducasse's signature Tasting Menu with wine pairings.

Breads came out soon after with a selection of focaccia, French baguette, dinner rolls and sourdough with unsalted and an interesting "peanut" butter. The breads were room temperature and butters were cold so spreading was not pleasant but the breads served their purpose of filling my gullet til the main courses arrived. 

Amuse

Foie gras royale with port reduction and mushroom foam 

- this enticing little number exhibited a pleasant airiness and irresistible aroma from the mushroom foam and the interesting mix of flavors and textures married well together lending a savory yet earthy element to this whimsically fascinating dish

Gnocci
With Parmigiano Reggiano, veal jus and sun chokes.

Not the best Gnocci I've ever had but satisfying nonetheless. This dish had an incredibly comforting feel to it. I especially enjoyed the contrasting textures from the light & crispy chips and tender enoki mushrooms served with the dish. Warm, rustic yet subtle and familiar flavors were easy on my palate. 

Main lobster curry with coconut basmati rice 

- it's hard to go wrong with lobster, especially when you infuse thai flavors into a dish. The perfectly cooked lobster was bathed in a pool of curry and served stop luscious coconut rice. A delectable marriage of flavors.

Filet mignon Rossini with foie gras and black truffle sauce 

- this was easily my favorite dish of the night. The combination of filet mignon, foie gras and black truffle is like the holy trinity of fine dining.  The result will almost always result in endless drooling and licking the porcelain off your plate. 

Predessert

Coconut foam and mango rum cocktail. An exhilarating drink with bright notes and a sweet finish. Excellent palate cleanser and a perfect way to prepare my taste buds for the sweet finale.

Baba a la marnagnac

Unfortunately I wasn't as impressed with my dessert.
The liqueur for the cake was too strong and pungent while the flavors were just were too heavy handed. I may have myself to blame for that, as I may have given the cakes too heavy of a pour of the accompanying liqueur.

Overall, food was good but I must admit that I expected more from a multi Michelin star chef like Alain Ducasse.  IMO, the dishes lacked that wow factor that I was eagerly anticipating.  Service was also on the clumsy and awkward side the night I dined, as well. For instance, my wine pairing for one of my dishes was completely forgotten until I reminded the sommelier. Additionally, the wait staff seemed a bit hurried and rushed.  The furniture itself, which has probably seen better days, was in desperate need of an update, too. During my dinner one of my guests had to change their seat out because the chair was collapsing. For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected a bit more, at least chairs that weren't falling apart at the seams. 
With that said, they changed the chair out without a hitch and there were some redeeming factors which included the stunning views, beautiful setting and expansive bar next door.  
3.5 stars for now and hoping the restaurant makes some improvements on the menu, furniture, and service in the future.

Until then...

Happy Eats!

I have a million things I need to do today but they are ALL on hold so I can write about how awesome this place is. They are not even fully up and running (Grand Opening is 9 July, folks) and they've already won me over. Why?

Their Espresso is at the top of my list. It is very well balanced: not too weak, not too bold, not too bitter and a really pleasant aftertaste that makes for a well-rounded consumption of coffee. Maybe my response was psychosomatic but it really took me back to Europe for a moment.

I read about their beignets and the reports are not exaggerated. They are fried up perfectly light and just a tad crispy. As much as I love donuts this was such a step up I don't know if I can ever go back. 

So my first visit here was like a mini-vacation to France and I feel like I got back a little joie de vivre. There was a bit of a wait to get my order but the folks took my coffee order while I was in line and I got to start savouring before I put in my pastry order so props for being mindful of the customers and doing their best to look after us. Since the beignets are made to order, it is worth the wait....trust me.

They also have some tasty looking gelato and their cooler already had some deli foods like olives and cheese (I need to come back soon to pick up some parmesan). I can only imagine what awesome goodies they're going to have. Once they get their liquor license we can look forward to French wine and craft beer for sale. They also have fresh flowers for sale. How awesome will you be when you bring home some fresh flowers and a bottle of wine and some cheese? Oui, oui!

The inside is very pleasant and has a nice European feel  with white walls and French Country dcor. I had a chance to chat with the owner's wife and they are really great people so this is a great new business that is well worth patronizing. I think it is a great concept and am so happy that we have this in Phoenix. It is dangerously close to where I live so I could very soon turn into a beignet whore-consider yourself warned!

Parking is a bit of an issue and after going around the block twice I had to park across the street and walk in the 115 degree heat....but it was worth it. I do hope that they find reason to open earlier during the week in the future because I would be in for coffee every day on the way to work.

Really great place run by good people. Well worth checking out and I can't wait to see how much more I love them when they are completely up and running!

Dang, Cantina Laredo - I wanted to like you so hard!  Like a hot date that ends in a restraining order, like an incredible hike that ends in poison oak or skunk spray - I've walked past this place for years, imagining a swanky, high-end Mexican food joint behind the dark windows and high prices; sadly, what I found was a very regular, uninspired restaurant serving up some rather meh Mexican food.  This was a 'man behind the curtain' Wizard of Oz moment for me.

Good things?  Mmmmmm - the warm spicy salsa which they serve along with another milder cold one (not so good) and chips is the reason this place gets 2 very enthusiastic stars from me - SO DELICIOUS!  It was hook-me-up-to-a-feed-bag delicious.  Service was quick and pleasant.

After that though, it all goes downhill.  Being vegetarian, I can 99% of the time find something meatless and tasty when I go out to eat but there were very few such options here.  I ended up selecting the Enchiladas de Espinaca and subbed in a Cheese & Onion one to shake things up a bit (I know, I'm very exciting).  When my meal came out, the waitress said she had the kitchen put zucchini alongside my Mexican rice instead of beans (wtf - who in their right mind opts out of beans for zucchini at a Mexican food restaurant?!); so began the first of my meal modifications - I might note here that while being veggie, I am a pretty low-maintenance diner.  So, just as the black beans are being brought out, I realize the sauce atop my cheese enchilada consists of red chili with beef chunks - again wtf - in my 31 years of life on this earth, no Mexican food joint I've ever visited has ever converted a cheese enchilada to a meat one via the sauce!  The waitress said they could make me a new cheese & onion with sour cream sauce atop (cringe).  The mushroom and spinach enchilada was kinda gross - something about the oil they used to saut the spinach in gave it a strange taste and the button mushrooms looked like they had been plunked into it straight out of a can.  The zucchini and cheese & onion enchilada were nothing I would ever want to order again.  Black beans were alright - hard to mess those up though.  

In defense of Cantina Laredo, if you're a big meat eater, perhaps you might have more luck here than I.  The place was clean, the workers were nice, the one aforementioned salsa is killer.  But this place is neither authentic nor new-agey Mexican, not worthy of the steeper price points, and certainly lacks any great ambience to carry the lackluster food.  Don't think I will be auditioning this place for a second date or hike - would strongly consider rolling around in poison oak or getting skunk sprayed over coming back - it was that bad.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 52/100

Stayed in this hotel with my bf for the first time a few weeks ago and absolutely LOVED IT!

I had never heard of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay before. Apparently it's the nicer of the two towers at Mandalay Bay, and consists entirely of suite-style hotel rooms. 

My bf had booked our stay about four months in advance through Expedia, and he only paid around $110 per night for a HUGE suite for the two of us! It was amazing and you definitely get a bang for your buck!

Parking is free, as with most if not all of the hotels in Vegas. The parking garage is HUGE and has stairs, escalators, and elevators. There's also valet parking and a taxi drop off/pick up area.

Check-in was quick and easy. Lines weren't long and it took us around 5 minutes.

Decor/ambience is really great in this hotel. It doesn't really have a theme like a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's just modern, classy, and trendy. I really liked it!

Elevators were kinda confusing since depending on what floor you're on, you have a certain set of elevators you have to take. However, the elevators are AWESOME and INCREDIBLY fast! We stayed on the 20th floor and it only took a few seconds to get from our room down to the lobby and back!

Our suite was AMAZING. There was a living room area that had a couch, desk, chairs, coffee table, and a huge television! There was also a guest bathroom located right by the door if you have people over. It's a 1/2 bath so just a sink and toilet, but still really awesome! There's also a mini-bar area, but make sure you don't touch any of the items there because they are monitored with a weight system, and you are automatically charged for anything you pick up. 

The bedroom area of our room was really nice. We had an incredible king sized bed with a HUGE wall unit that had a TV in the middle, and his and hers closets on either side of it. The closets even had lights inside to see your clothes, and robes, slippers, hangers, etc.!

Our main bathroom was HUGE! It came with two sinks, toilet, a big shower, and a ginormous bathtub that could fit like 3 people in it. My college dorm room was honestly smaller than this bathroom...it was crazy!

The Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson show plays at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. We didn't watch it, but we plan on watching it during one of our future visits! 

The MIX Lounge at the top of the hotel is supposed to be da bomb. We didn't end up going up there but we saw a ton of people waiting in line to go up.

The ONLY things I didn't love about THEhotel were:

1) LACK OF WIFI IN ROOMS. I think they only had ethernet but that is useless when you only have your smart phone and iPad with you.

2) NO REFRIGERATOR IN SUITE. The bf tried to create a makeshift refrigerator with our ice bucket. Didn't really work...

3) LOCATION. That it's on the far south end of the strip. Like literally the last hotel. Fortunately we drove to Vegas so we used our car to drive further up the strip, but if you don't have a car I can imagine it being a huge issue. It's quite a long walk from THEhotel towards the middle/north end of the strip.

I would definitely stay at THEhotel again and highly recommend it! 5 stars!

Third times a charm? This makes three times I have seen a pizza spot in this location. I stopped in and ordered a "Monday's Special" which is a large cheese pizza for $9.99 and additional toppings are extra. Inside was very busy so I guess others are wanting to this place out too. While I was waiting for my pizza, I noticed they have pizza by the slice for sale. I asked if they could add a slice of Sicilian (cheese) to my order priced at $3.25 and make it to-go. My husband isn't a fan of a lot of sauce on a pizza, but I'm the opposite. I asked for a side of sauce (cost .85 cents) to go along with my pizza for dipping and it and I ended up really liking the flavor. The pizza had a thin crust and the right amount of cheese for it. The pizza wasn't very greasy at all and hubby and I both enjoyed it. The Sicilian slice tasted great and had the crisp crust it should, but I was a but disappointed when I got home and opened the paper bag it was in and it was just on a paper plate inside the bag. They did just open, so it's possible they ran out of to-go boxes, but I hope it's not this way all the time. The Sicilian slice was actually my favorite part. The employees were nice and with the different specials they have going on and the food being decent, I can see coming back.

Most pizza joints have a "slice special" and it has a certain time it runs and sometimes only on certain days. Well, here you can get 2 slices and a drink for $5.50 7 days a week anytime. I thought it was a plus that I could get a slice special for dinner instead of just a restricted lunch time special. Aside from pizza they also have wings, fingers, salads, strombolis, pasta, sandwiches and desserts. They also cater.

My Favorite Vegas Sweet Stop! I got chocolate wasted and wouldn't have minded spending a whole day in this chocolate dream. 

Their chocolate drinks are heavenly. Friend had an italian in a cute hug mug http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=efFt78-ToFIXyJm5ZIjr4g
Dude had an 80s milkshake which was soooo delicious! Love the alice in wonderland "Drink Me" cup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=WslMBkiMScJAM6fOITjHQg

I ADDED BACON to my Guilt Free Omelette (CG style) and this was one of my favorite breakfast dishes i've had in a long time (thanks Janice C!). The omelette had some veggies and cheese, came with a side of potatoes. It came with an awesome sweet biscuit served with a side of butter and a side of milk chocolate!!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=WjX7TqdKnJfQ8_rL21lnNw. The potatoes dipped in the chocolate worked delicious as well. 
Friend had the Brenner Kobe Burger- but didn't swoon over it. But the fries were good. Dipped them in chocolate- even better! 
Shared a apple cinnamon waffle and it came out soo pretty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=ZM1r3Jgh1rIOAd8CLg_w8g
Loved loved the tiny vial of chocolate sauce and the tiny chocolate pearls to dress up our waffles. The Vanilla icecream made it all perfect. 
While waiting for your food, u can check out the boutique inside filled with chocolate galore. The bill even came in the cutest chocolate bar like tin. 
I couldn't leave without getting me the chocolate walnut cookie that Dru C wrote about, at the stand where they also display the chocolate pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=4XrN-0eKjrZ_O1MZPwUwDA, cupcakes and chocolate syringes! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=Y_OtGVh8HWQQzXQcHFcZRg
If u like the texture of Mrs Fields cookies, you will love this one which is 10 times better.I can say this is the best cookie i've ever had! It's $5.00, but it's big and super packed with chocolate and every bite is buttery bliss. Just make sure to eat it right away or if you're gonna savor it bite by bite like me and keep putting it away only to open the bag again to take another bite- get an extra bag cuz the grease will seep through- in the good way of course. 

I cannot wait to go back to get myself a couple more cookies and stay for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

*at the Forum Shoppes at Caesar across from the huge ass H and M store. Mens while ur waiting for your girl at the 3 floor H and M, you can get yourself a chocolate syringe and die happy.

I don't expect this to go anywhere, especially given the level of customer service (or lack thereof)  I received this past weekend at the SLS Las Vegas. Nevertheless, I feel the need to vent so here goes.

I booked a 4-day stay at the SLS in order to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday as well as to ask her to marry me. I had heard that the SLS was a small hotel, recently refurbished and that it provided a hip and trendy way yet friendly atmosphere. I was especially attracted to the fact that the SLS is somewhat removed from the strip and that afforded us some much needed quiet and privacy.

24-hours prior to my arrival I called the hotel to confirm my reservation (which I booked directly with the hotel on-line) as well as to advise reservations that I had a late flight in and therefore required late check-in. At first the agent couldn't locate my reservation and actually told me that I did not have one. After 20-minutes on the telephone he finally located my reservation under the confirmation number i had given him. He told me that he would notate the system about the late arrival and that I should have no problems from there.

I arrived at the SLS shortly before midnight on the 8th only to find out that my reserved room had been assigned to someone else. The agent at the counter seemed clueless about what to do next so I jokingly suggested that she upgrade me to a suite - which she said she would do. The problem? Well the "suite" was a room with two under-sized double beds. Given that this was supposed to have been a romantic getaway long weekend I did not consider the sleeping arrangements to be ideal. I then proceeded to call the front desk who told me they would call me at 10AM the next day when my original room became available. The call never came.

At 11:00 AM on the 9th I went to the front desk to inquire about the room and was told by the employee that no rooms were available, that I should consider myself lucky to have the room I had because it was better than my original room and that perhaps I should check out and try to check back in after 3PM if something became available. Really?!?!?! Not being able to tolerate any more stupidity my girlfriend and I decided to go to the SLS buffet for breakfast. While on the way I stopped to ask an employee if the buffet was open and where it was located. They told me that they didn't know where it was located and went on to tell me that they were likely no longer serving food at 11:30 AM so my girlfriend and I went to the MGM buffet instead. We subsequently found out that the SLS Buffet is indeed open for breakfast, lunch and dinner - but more to follow on that one. 

While all of this was going on my girlfriend was attempting to track down a package that she had delivered to the hotel. The person at the front desk told her to check with the FedEx Office. The FedEx Office told her to check with the mail room. Nobody knew anything about the package so I asked the concierge and explained the story to her. She was surprised to learn that the SLS had an actual mail room. She did locate it, however we were promptly informed that we could not go to the mail room because it was an employee only area. The concierge was helpful in that she offered to have a bell-hop deliver the package, the problem however is that the package wasn't delivered to us until 4-hours after the request.

Back to the room fiasco - we stayed in the room with the undersized beds. The lack of helpfulness of the staff wore us out.

Back to the buffet - we finally made it there Sunday. The food was great, it's a shame that there was nobody around to bring us drinks - the wait staff (in typical SLS fashion) was missing and less than helpful.

Oh and then there is the cab ride where the valet at the gate stopped our cab driver to yell at him (using profanities) and asking what country he thought he was driving in because he accidentally turned out in the wrong direction.

To top it all off everyone at the SLS kept addressing me as Mr. Fxxxxo when my name is Sxxxxxe. Fxxxxo is my girlfriends last name. Given that I made the reservations, that I paid for the trip and that everything was under Sxxxxxe I am unsure why the SLS couldn't get something as simple as my name right. 

SLS - Our experience was horrible. I ended up not proposing to my girlfriend because of the stress that you put on both of us. You ruined my girlfriend's long birthday weekend and we will never be back. It's really a shame because on the surface the SLS is a great hotel but when you put lipstick on a pig you still have a pig and that is exactly what the SLS is - a painted pig.

Again, I expect this will fall on deaf ears but I really needed to vent.

Had the most Mind blowing Experinece here!

This place rocks!  Seriously they have hundreds of gems, fossils, rocks etc etc. I wish they were closer to get to.

So my friend Dawn R. who flew in from Portland for the Yelp Spring Break had been looking for 6 gems for a Feng Shui thing in the living room.  Everything on the internet was just a online store and not a business that you could walk into.  When it comes to gems and minerals you want to hold and see.  Think about a diamond for example.  Wouldn't you rather see it and touch in person before buying!   Well the Yelp Ap came to the rescue again.  

This place is on the outskirts of downtown and easy to get to.  I wasn't sure want to expect since there was less than 10 reviews but WHOA when we walked in it was like DAYUM.  They have A LOT of stuff.  They have the place organized by the minerals, gems and fossils in the front.  When you go to the back you can find even more minerals, gems in all type of sizes and shapes and even a sections of beads.  Another smaller room where they have Buddhist statues.  I was totally impressed with the amount of items this place carries.

I personally was not looking for anything in particular.  I was looking at some pendulum and I tried out a few.  There was one answering me even when I was not holding it so I getting it.   I also purchased a Moldavite http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavite.  Something I had never heard of until that day.  I was curious to know more about it and Miguel was the one who took the time to explain what it was and how people use it.  Being that I had by Reiki 1 & 2 done and he was a Reiki Master and had also done theta healing I knew exactly what he was talking about in terms of energy work.  I could totally feel the warmth from this one gem from holding it in my hand.  I felt like what one may feel when having a hot flash.  It was pretty odd how this little gem was giving off that much energy.  There are only 3-4 mines and it is estimated that it will all be gone in the less than 10 years so I thought I should get one.   So I picked a pendant http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jMrpr92nMEhe4cC4FF00VQ?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#hddvoHue4g2iC-Tv6KuvRA and a chain I like and put it on.  The pendant sat right between my heart and throat chakra and I could immediately feel the warmth in my chest area.   

Now this is when things got interesting.  As we were checking out, Miguel had left to the back room to grab a bag for my pendulum.  When he returned he told me to put out both hand and close my eye.  Hmmm that is a strange request but I obliged.  He then put a good size spirit quartz in both hands and told me to hold on an feel.  I seriously never ever ever felt so much energy and vibration coming from gem before.  It was so intense my hands were shaking.  It shot up through my arms and straight to my chest and was pounding right were the Moldavite pendulum lay.  I was totally speechless and all that came out of my mouth was Oh Shit, Oh my goodness, Oh Damn Oh my god etc etc.   A minute or so into it Miguel proceeds to share with me a message from my spirit guide to not be so hard on myself and to take things slowly and to take my time.  With the massive energy and vibration going through me and what I was hearing I teared up big time.  This was so unexpected and a great surprise.  It was one of the most amazing experience I had in a store!!!  Now this is not to be expected with every person that comes in but I was totally opened to it and was ready for it and so I welcomed it.  Freaking amazing.   I was feeling that energy pretty much all day, it was freaking great!!!! 

Anywho, if your' looking to buy a few pieces for feng shuei or maybe even by a Moldavite and you happen to be visiting sin city you have got to stop by this place.  It's a gem of a place!

Locale ~ Downtown 
Offerings ~ Gems, Minerals, Jewelry, Statues
Extras ~ Ask for Miguel,  He is very knowledgeable and helpful!

***There are some great things about Guy Savoy like the lobster with beets in cold steam, the great service, and the nice dining room, but like other Las Vegas restaurants, it is very overpriced***

Guy Savoy definitely reminds me of Joel Robuchon.  They both feature formal fine dining French cuisine from esteemed chefs and very expensive tasting menus and a la carte items as well as lavish bread carts and dessert trolleys.  The restaurants are quite different though.  Savoy has a minimalist and modern decor.  It feels much more elegant, comfortable and less distracting than the over-the-top and all over the place elegant decor at Robuchon.  Savoy also features much more personable service that is still professional and polite.

In terms of the food, it is hard for me to compare Savoy to Robuchon because I had a few a la carte items at Savoy while I had a tasting menu with many, many courses at Robuchon.  In terms of bread, Robuchon is better.  Both feature a wide variety of bread, but I felt Robuchon's bread had better textures as well as much more distinct flavors (Robuchon's bread was warmer and felt fresher too).

Robuchon's dessert trolley is significantly better than the one at Savoy.  Robuchon's lavish dessert trolley is an extravagant and over-the-top movable feast of sweets while Savoy is more of a small selection sweets on a nice tableside cart.  Variety is not the only reason why Robuchon is better.  The sweet treats at Robuchon have much better (and more interesting) flavors.

In terms of the food, I had really good things at Robuchon and Savoy but nothing as good as what I have had at Bay Area fine dining spots like The French Laundry, Cyrus or Manresa.

There were bright spots.  I really liked the lobster and jumbo lump crab with beets and cold steam from seaweed water.  There were great beet cups filled with creamy beet mousse and soft, fresh and moist crab.  There was also lobster carpaccio that was topped with minced golden beets; the beets had a great sweet flavor that was reminiscent of fruit.  There was also warm and nicely cooked lobster meat--fresh, moist and soft.

There was even puff pastry topped with beet ribbons.  The finishing touch was great seaweed aroma from the cold steam that enveloped the food (cool effect and great fragrance).

I also liked the mushroom brioche topped with black truffle butter.  The brioche was warm, buttery, crispy, and flaky (and the black truffle flavor was very prominent).  The accompanying black truffle and artichoke soup was just okay.

The amuse of foie gras with brioche was good--rich, creamy and a great foie gras flavor.  The pumpkin soup amuse was good though surprisingly thin.

Other courses were not as good.  The crab tart was just soggy and boring and I probably should have ordered the veal three ways as my entree.  They present the veal chop before they slice it and it was very nicely cooked--a great golden brown sear.

My entree was a variety of game birds cooked in a pot.  The cooking in the pot yielded tender and moist meat, but there were no contrasts in textures so the meats were a little uninteresting.  I thought the pheasant was good.  I thought the squab was good too, but I prefer it when they achieve a crispy skin on squab.

I was not a fan of the Mallard duck.  Like the squab, there was no crispy skin.  The flavor of the duck was very strong--interesting but not my favorite flavor.  The texture was off-putting.  The texture of the duck meat was squishy and a tad rubbery; it ended up being similar to the unique texture of squab.

The garnishes were good though a tad rustic for such a fine dining spot.  There was some good sweet and sour cabbage and wild mushrooms.  There was also a nicely cooked, buttery and smooth foie gras.

While the savory courses were a mix of good and average, I was not a fan of Savoy's desserts.  I ordered the coconut six ways and while I really liked the light and crispy coconut flakes and tapioca, I did not like the rest of the dish.  It was like various bland ingredients in water.

The mignardises from the trolley were okay; the pate de fruit was kind of hard and overly sugared.  The dark chocolate ice cream was rich and good though and I liked the flavor of the earl grey sorbet with English cream and black pepper. 

As mentioned, service was good; prices were too high, but that is often the case with high-end Vegas restaurants.

I did not love Robuchon, but I preferred it to Savoy.  There were some nice things about Savoy, but the food is just too expensive for just so many okay dishes.  I think your money would be much better spent on a dinner at an upscale Bay Area spot like Manresa.  If you do want a nice dinner in Vegas, I recommend the much more price friendly Picasso or L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (seasonal tasting menu).

Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Caesars Palace offers both free valet and self parking.

After an evening of nonstop Vegas-style partying, the only words I managed to utter from my dry raspy voice the following morning was...water please!!!

In addition to replenishing my body with much needed liquids, I was feeling mighty peckish, as well!  After much deliberation, our group decided on a calm & relaxing sit down Saturday brunch at Thomas Keller's Bouchon. 

Located on the 10th floor inside the Venetian, the restaurant embodied what I've come to expect from a fine French bistro. The vibe was chic & refined yet relaxed and unfussy.  There were comfortable banquettes throughout the main dining area as well as outdoor seating in the patio area. We were subsequently seated inside. At 12:00pm, the sun was beaming from the patio, so our location filtered the intense light perfectly, which suited me and my solar sensitive eyes just fine. 

Complimentary house made jam was magnificent! The jam is freshly prepared each day and depending on the chef's mood, a different flavor variety is served. Today, he was feeling strawberry, which is my personal favorite! They served us an Epi baguette to share and it was fantastic, as well. Warm, buttery crust with perfectly chewy texture. Coupled with the soft butter and sweet pucker inducing jam, it was a match made in the stars.

The entrees were orchestrated perfectly as we didn't have to wait long at all.

Chicken n waffles - The waffles were made with bacon n chives and sourdough batter. It was airy and crisp with a lightly sweet flavor and a savory finish. It was so good i almost forgot to use the syrup!
The chicken was roasted perfectly and it was insanely moist & tender! The chasseur wine sauce was rich and flavorful with an alluring aroma. Some of my guests enjoyed the savory flavor so much they poured the irresistible sauce over their waffles, too!

Pork belly was fatty and incredibly flavorful and juicy.  Accompanied by the creamy hollandaise sauce, it was absolutely delicious!

Corned beef hash was phenomenal! Well seasoned pieces of corned beef mixed with all the traditional fixins that will impress any die hard corned beef hash purist!  Trust, this was far from canned! 

Short rib was tender, the fontina cheese was fragrant and the whimsically tiny jingle bell peppers added a pleasant little kick to this fantastic dish!

Beignets were served fresh out of the oven but they were quite dense and tasted more like doughnuts IMO Overall, they were very moist and with the added raspberry preserve filling, they added a sweet finish to our savory entrees.

Our service throughout the meal was very consistent with coffees, water, and juices always filled to the brim.

By the end of the meal we were absolutely stuffed!  But I didn't mind at all :D

My friends and I had a wonderful time and it was great feeling totally replenished and revived with good quality food that was masterfully prepared with fantastic service to boot. The strong coffee didn't hurt either!  I'm not quite sure if this particular location was ever awarded a Michelin star but IMO Thomas Keller deserves praise for a dining experience that was unpretentious, comforting and very enjoyable!

When we all left, I was sated, 100% refreshed and ready to take on the world, well at least another round of partying :) 

Hey, it's Vegas for crying out loud.

Happy Eats!

Dating Guide for Dummies, Vol. 4: How to properly club & hit on a group of bodacious bimbos at an A-list Vegas night club.

In this edition of DG for D's, I'm going to cover a premiere Vegas night club and extract it's venue perks towards your benefit.  This is also one of the few clubs where every girl will still look amazing after the lights turn on, so there's no need to rush out.

When you go to a night club, you need to be fresh, look fresh, and feel fresh.  The girls don't get Barbie'd up for nothing in this town so you need to do your part too, but do it with a cool sense of casual-class and finesse.  Down-dress with a nice untucked dress shirt with your sleeves rolled, slim designer jeans, dress shoes other than black, and a loose, solid tie (optional, but highly recommended). 

Now on to the venue, XS is a club where the guys "can" get some loving, but how, you ask?  I feel your pain brother, that's why I wrote this installment.  Main rule of thumb, don't wait in the 2 hour line and don't go in broke.  Even if you manage to walk in with a group of lovely girls, you will need to order drinks.  Your best bet is to cut the line by booking a VIP table and/or cabana with your boys and splitting the costs.  Girls love VIP and they love free bottle service so you're sure to attract a herd of them.  With that said, if you're not hitting it off, limit those skanks to 1 drink or risk getting played.

Did I mention the girls are easy?  For the most part they are.  Trust me, 85% are there to get some sort of action: simple flirting, subtle make out sessions, someone to dance with, or straight answer how they like their eggs in the morning question.  Over easy please.  Stay away from the other 15%, you'll immediately know who they are and don't question the validity of these statistics, it's certified as I've scientifically proven them during my last visit.

Make sure to stay away from any pair of girls since they usually want to dance with themselves, unless they approach you or emit an inviting aura a la cutesy wandering eyes.  Also, steer clear of groups larger than 4 unless you have backup.  There's too much criticism amongst these felines and you'll be heavily scrutinized.  Even if the entire group digs you, it takes one crazy bitch to say stop-no-and-don't to ruin your game.  3 is the magic number fellas, there are less girls to impress and you'll get a chance to charm them up on a more intimate level.  If you happen to cusp one away from her pack, the other two girls will still have each other so she's really not leaving her girls hanging.  Once you do, take her outside to cool off and dance at the shallow end of the pool.  Trust me and get your feet wet, this will show her your fun, adventurous side.

If you arrive a little late, well that's perfect!  The girls are already liquored up from the many guys offering them free drinks.  This is a good thing as these guys haven't read my guide so they're making our jobs easier and cheaper.  They don't call me Dr. Date, aka Mr. Steal-Your-Girl for nothing.  Have no shame, just roll on in and commit a robbery.  Also remember, these girls are already wet from how magnificent the venue is: the euro style dcor and endless stripper poles, flashing lights and fancy limelights, gorgeously-lit pool area and spacious outdoor dance floor, loungy plush-white day beds, and party-rocking-world-class dj's.  XS is really doing us a favor.  You paid for it so use it towards your advantage.

Now go, young padawan, for you have the tools necessary to roam the short skirts of XS.  May good luck and fortune bestow upon you.  And remember kids, what happens in Vegas, stays...except for herpes.  That shit will come home with you.

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Warning! Going to Sam Fox Restaurants for Happy Hour after a movie can be habit forming. 

We have heard many good things about this Italian farmhouse concept, but we were little hesitant given that we found the lunch at North in Kierland just okay.  Our caution however, was unwarranted.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
We arrived around four-thirty and the parking lot was mostly empty. Were they open we thought? But as we approached the front door, it was opened by a hostess and we were invited in. Nice.  

We said we had come for the Happy Hour and were escorted not to the bar, but to some tables along the back wall. We were given menus, both Dinner and HH and heard a brief explanation of the fish special. Very cozy and very nice. I have taken a few photos of the inside of the restaurant.  The mood is upscale and dare I say 'hip".

MENU:
Like other Fox places, the HH menu is more of a starting point of samplers. For instances, if you like HH serving of freshly made meatballs and spaghetti, then maybe you'll like the lager dinner serving.

The HH menu has about a dozen items, mostly in the $5.00 - $8.00 range.  They have Caesar Salad, Arancini, Pizza of the Day $8, Chef's Board of meats and cheese $10, Zucca chips $3.  Two holdovers from other restaurants are the Castelvetrano Olives $3 and Spiced Nuts $2. These two look similar to the Olive & Ivy's offering. http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-and-ivy-scottsdale#hrid:XB-E39WNviGs1MkkQ4XIxw

As you would expect, they also have all beers and well drinks priced at $4.00 to $5.00.  But what we found special, are all their wines marked at 50% off.  They will also re-cork it for you to go.

Here are links to the menus:
http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/North_40th_Menu_Happy_Hour.pdf
http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/North_40th_Dinner_Menu2.pdf

SERVICE:
We found the service to be very professional.  Yes, the water glasses were refilled on a timely basis, but also the wait staff comes by and chats with you about your food and answers any questions you have very knowledgeably.  We actually got into a very detailed discussion on Washington State wines and Oregon Pinots with our server Vail.

FOOD:
We started off by ordering a Washington State Chardonnay, but found they didn't have any chilled.  We then opted instead for the Snoqualmie Riesling, which was somewhat sweet, with a hint of cherries.

We tried the HH Caesar Salad for $5.00 and the HH Spaghetti, also for $5.00. The salad came with some of the most delicious croutons that had a smokey taste we have ever had.  A definite must.  The spaghetti was equally interesting and flavorful.  The meatballs must be cooked in a marinara, and has a complexed layering taste which was different than the pasta sauce, which has a hint of fennel. Wow.

Next we ordered the Margherita Pizza ($11.00) off the Dinner menu, see photos. It was very good but we found the cheese slipped off when you bit into a wedge. 

For dessert, we each ordered the Gelato scoop for $3.00 and the Tiramisu for $6.00, both off the dinner menu.  I've taken pictures of the Titamisu.  It came in a glass ramekin with an amazing amount of delicious mascarpone cheese and flavorful Kahlua.

PRICES:
Our petite Happy Hour dinner of six items, ran us $41.50 before taxes and gratuities.  It also included the bottle ($23.00, 50% off) of Riesling, which our wonderful server Vail re-corked for us. As we left, the parking lot was full with a dozen cars waiting to be parked.

Enjoy!

Heard about the 16 oz Ribeye for 12.99 here so of course I had to investigate. It's a tough job but hay, somebody has to do it!

As you come in, the bar is the first thing you run into. That's great if you want to eat and drink while inhaling second hand smoke. Just go around to your left and into the actual dining room where there is about 6 booths and 3 tables.

If you are lucky, you just might get Holly as your server. She is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and she provides great service. The vibe I got from her was all positive. It seemed to me like she actually enjoyed her job. Needless to say, I knew I was going to give her a generous tip when it was all said and done.

As promised, I ordered the 12.99 1 pound Ribeye which comes with your choice of Fries or Onion Rings (I got the Onion Rings and man, they were so good!). I also added a side salad which is only a dollar more with any meal. I ordered the Ribeye medium rare topped off with my request of sauted onions and mushrooms. I assume they have been offering this Ribeye deal for a while now because my steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it. It was so juicy and  tender that my wife was kicking herself for not ordering it. Refer to my pic of the inner portion of my exquisite piece of meat. To me, that's how all steak should be cooked and look like when its cut apart.

My wifey ordered the Pretzel appetizer (which is funny because it could be a meal in itself cuz its so huge!) Comes with 3 sauces. Hot mustard, Jalapeno Cream Cheese, and Nacho Cheese infused with Beer! Now that last sauce was kind of weird but definitely a change of pace if you have never had it.

Now probably the only obvious thing that stood out as a negative for me was that even though we were in the supposed "Non Smoking" dining section, you can still smell the smoke coming in from the bar. At the time of our dining experience, I smelled only a little bit of smoke and when we got home, some of the smell was on our clothing. I can only imagine that on really busy nights, the smoke factor would be even worse and that your clothes will smell like an ashtray full of cigarette butts later on.

So if you are ever craving steak, especially Ribeye, then Jacksons Bar and Grill is the place for you! Doesn't matter if it's 11 pm at night or 9 am breakfast time, you can get it at any time because these guys are 24/7!

Cue Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue", because the curtain just went up yesterday on a new Five Star food experience!

For most Chicago food lovers, Portillo's holds a special place.  Yes, there are several hundred Italian Beef and Char Dog places up there.  But it was Dick Portillo and his family who first capitalized on turning Chicago comfort food into a culinary science.  Then they made it into a destination stop with all of the visual entertainment of their theme restaurants.  Very simply, the food was very good and it was a fun place to go.

This Portillo's is no different.  Here they have a 50s/60s Retro Theme.  As I waited in line last night, it was more like a carnival atmosphere.  Of the nearly four hundred ahead of me, there was ne're a raised voice or a sad face. Everyone was laughing and telling stories.  

As you entered the restaurant after forty-five minutes to an hour outside, and then realizing you had another forty-five minute wait inside -- you looked around and saw nothing but a sea of happy, satisfied customers chowing down on their favorite food.

I was ordering for three, since I had two hungry somebodies waiting at home for my food delivery service.  For myself, I ordered the Big Italian Beef wet ($5.95) with sweet and hot peppers giardinera ($0.90) and Mozzarella ($0.50) and a Jumbo Hot dog ($2.99) with everything on it.  Boy, did if goof.  The prices for the food are outrageously fair and reasonable.  Heck, I left thinking they got my order wrong with all the food they gave me. 

Their beef sandwich was nearly a foot long and I needed to cut it in half.  There was no way any human being could finish something this big and I didn't.  The amount of beef on half, was more than double what I have had in the past at any other restaurant! They could have easily sold my half sandwich for the $5.95 that I paid.  My jumbo dog was also very good, but I should have ordered it charred instead.  It was worth the wait, everything was delicious.

The other items on my family's order, were two Beef 'n Cheddar croissants for $5.25 each, another Jumbo Dog with an order of large Fries ($2.19) and onion rings ($2.09), along with four hot giardiners ($0.45) and one pop.  Our total came to $35.95, including taxes and could have easily fed four.  As I said, I goofed and over ordered by a mile!

Other items on the menu that we didn't try are: the 1/3 of pound Char Burgers for $3.95, or the double for $6.19. They also have a Halibut  or Tuna sandwich $5.19, and a Veggie Sandwich for $5.35. Portillo's is famous for their Garbage Salad which is $7.69.  They also have a Chicken Caesar for $6.59.  Their Shakes are $2.69/ $3.39 and Malts $2.79/ $3.59. For something completely different, they also have Tamales $1.89 and a Tamale in a Box for $2.99.

In Yelp-ese, a Four Star experience is "Yay! I'm a fan."  A Five Star is "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"  Before tonight, I would have said Portillo's was a Four Stars. But NOT after this evening.  To even the toughest critic or curmudgeon, they would have to admiit that this is as good as it gets!  Five Stars.

Enjoy!

I had this place bookmarked after seeing several delicious looking pictures being posted on yelp. Hubby and I decided to come here for dinner and we left full and satisfied. The beer here is brewed on site and has won several awards at the Great American Beer Festival and The World Beer Cup. Did I try any beer? Nope! Another visit I will though ;)

We sat in a comfy booth in the dining area. Our server was very nice and checked on us often and went over any questions we had. The menu had so many good choices so hubby and I decided to pick out 2 different things to share. We ordered the "Buffalo Chicken Wrap" priced at $10 and the "South Side Cheese Steak" priced at $10 with a $3 up charge for the substitution of onion rings instead on fries.

Buffalo Chicken Wrap - The chicken tenders are handmade and tossed in hot sauce then put into a tortilla with lettuce, tomato and chipotle ranch. I asked them to leave the lettuce out. The chicken was all white and cooked perfectly. The whole wrap would have been good to me if the hot sauce wasn't on it. It wasn't hot at all and tasted like straight up vinegar. The portion was great and the fries that came with it were delicious. I asked for a side of ranch to dip my fries in and the ranch was cold, thick and delicious. Hubby thought the wrap was OK, but this isn't something I personally would order again unless is was minus the funky vinegar flavor. 

South Side Cheese Steak - This has beef with peppers, mushrooms, and onions, with their our own signature beer cheese sauce. This sandwich was just delicious! The steak was tender and flavorful, the peppers and onions cooked just right and the beer cheese sauce makes this sandwich a match made cheese steak heaven! The onion rings were beer battered and yummy! I could easily just eat a plate of the onion rings!

Happy Hour is daily from 4 - 7 pm. HH is only available in the beer garden, loft and lounge according to their menu.

While there we noticed a promotion for "Slot August Nights" where you can stop in and enter to win a 1966 Ford Mustang! You can enter at their other locations Magoos, Loose Caboose, Golden West and of course here at Chicago Brewing Company. Just ask your server for details.

My first visit being so-so, I decided to give Teriyaki Madness a second try to see if I liked it any better. For me it was still the same so-so experience and I don't get the hype over this place. Inside is very clean and they have plenty of tables to choose from and the booths are spacious which is nice. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu. Some of the food I ordered was really good and some of it was not so good. I do get coupons in the mail sometimes for BOGO offers, so I can see coming back with a coupon and probably will since the rice and chicken are pretty darn good and I work in the area, but I can't see making a point to come here often. 

Spicy Chicken Teriyaki Plate ($8.99) - I took the white rice that came with it and mixed it with the chicken. I liked the flavor of the chicken a lot. There was a good portion of both rice and chicken. I'd order this again for sure. 

Spicy Beef Teriyaki Plate ($9.49) - For an extra $1 this time I chose noodles instead of rice. The noodles were a bit dry and lacked flavor. The beef was tender and tasted good, but I tasted teriyaki flavor and no spice which was a bummer because I had enjoyed the spicy chicken and the chicken actually kick. The overpowering flavor of teriyaki on this one will most likely mean that I will stick to the spicy chicken instead.

Chicken Egg Roll ($1.99) - Inside I saw tons of what appeared to be black pepper yet the egg roll really had no flavor. It was filled with a generous amount of chicken, but it was greasy and flavorless. 

Chicken Pot Stickers ($3.29) - These were a greasy and overcooked mess. On the menu these are described as "crazy good" and I got 5 of them that were crazy greasy and hard. The inside tasted not so great. I will stick to the stickers elsewhere. 

Stir-Fry Veggies and a Green Salad are each options for sides. The salad came with a sweet dressing that tasted good. The veggies were basic yet tasty and fresh. 

Orders are made fresh so if you are on a lunch break or crunched for time then call your order in so it's ready or at least being made while you are on your way to pick it up.

I didn't have such a great experience at the Sugar Factory inside the Paris, so when I found out this is where we would be meeting up for a birthday dinner, I was a bit bummed. I hadn't been to this newer location at Town Square though and only had dessert and drinks at the Paris location, so trying actual food from Sugar Factory I had a open mind for. Walking in they have candy and lollipops for sale, but they have price tags on them that are way overpriced. I couldn't ever see spending what they are charging for a sucker that spins. 

Our server, Manolo was great. He checked on us often and seemed genuine, not pushy trying to get us to order apps, drinks, merchandise, etc. He just was the type of server you wish you always had when eating out. The place was packed inside and even the tables outside the restaurant were filled, but the servers did a great job at taking care of everybody. 

I ordered a "S'mores Martini" priced at $14 and was a bit disappointed. Sure it looked cute and tasted alright, but it tasted more like candy than anything I would catch a buzz off. My hubby's Reese's drink was much more tasty. Priced also at $14 I had a "Garbage Bowl Salad" for dinner and substituted the vinaigrette that comes on it for ranch dressing. The salad had lettuce, pepperoni, salami, cucumbers, tomato, avocado, mozzarella and provolone. The menu said it also came with croutons, but what a bummer they weren't on the salad! There was enough other stuff so it worked out. The salad was really good. I liked the crisp, fresh lettuce and the amount of ripe delicious avocados they put in it. The bottom was filled with salami and pepperoni as well. I kept eating and eating and still there was salad left! 

The key with Sugar Factory is to come here when it's HH or with some type of deal/coupon. The drinks and much of the menu is just way too overpriced and coming here and paying full price will more than likely leave not only a dent in your wallet, but will probably leave you feeling like not ever coming back. Currently there is a yelp check-in offer for $15 that gets you $25 (not valid Fridays & Saturdays) and they have a groupon right now for this location where you can pick from a few different deals depending on the size of your party. Sugar Factory also has different deals depending on the day. The HH runs Mon - Fri from 3 pm - 6 pm where you can get BOGO cocktails and half off appetizers, pizzas and burgers. If you are coming here to drink anyway then coming here when it's better priced makes more sense.

P.S. The cel reception in here is no good! I had no signal most of my visit and when I did it was just 1 bar. Everyone at my table had this same issue.

P.S.S. The music is TOO LOUD! It's hard to have a conversation with people sitting next to you because the music is annoyingly loud.

EAT, pretty simply put, how could I go wrong as I Yelped up a something to eat this morning for some breakfast before returning home from Vegas? 

I generally stay clear of the places that appear so sublime on Yelp, but I was hungry and I was biting on the the Yelp hook again for a relatively new place with a short track record. My GPS in the rent-a-car told me this place didn't exist WTF was this some kind of Yelp trick? I found it anyway a half dozen blocks down from the Fremont Street Experience downtown, nestled under an old apartment complex.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#1FLXhCFNGaHKlo7mePjUCQ  Maybe 707 never existed before Eat made her home here???

After feeding the meter across the street I crossed and hesitantly I walked into a nicely appointed, clean semi industrial, semi earthy space of a restaurant  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#5hwJW33twIKPbYqGXborAw  with only a few customers and was greeted by a tall dude (forget his name) with face full of jewelery, a punker hair-do and a dark gothish demeanor. He showed me to a table and got me some coffee right off. Nice guy.

As I read the menu I knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore Toto, there were a bunch of menu choices that were out of the box and sounded very promising. http://eatdowntownlv.com/breakfast/

FOOD ORDERED:
Truffled Egg Sandwich Two farm-fresh scrambled eggs with wild mushrooms, chives, feta, bacon and smashed potatoes

WHAT I GOT:
Truffled Egg Sandwich and some country style fried potatoes. The sammy was great, yummy thick sliced bacon atop a couple of fried eggs laced with shrooms and some chives and a kiss of feta cheese crumbles on a croissant roll. This sammy was good! And the taters were well seasoned and tasty as well. 4.5*****STARS
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#atNQH5fb6TgXBd6UtOgXkw

The service was great too. Plenty of refills, checked on me couple times too. Had their s**t together.  4.5 **** Stars

I also briefly met Natalie Young  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#kz1WySQnziPX0GxnBQvwQA the chef / owner as she was kicking it with a few patrons at the table next to me. She seemed like a very nice and down to earth gal.

She explained that breakfast crowd for some unknown reason was always a bit slower but lunch and later times were always slammed full of customers. I can believe it if the Lunch and Dinner choices are anything like breakfast food. While a little pricey (still cheaper than the Vegas strip restaurants) it's so worth it.

This place is as cool, hipster, and the food is as good as you are likely to find in a local Las Vegas eatery. Its a local downtown eating establishment that's not on the beaten path when it comes to locale or food. This place is what most trendy LA places wish they were  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#lSlXZcBJk6tow9WEoEUcsw hip with legit with great food and real atmosphere.

I gotta try the chicken fried steak next time it looked awesome!

I'll be back, next time in Vegas!

This ain't no Hometown Buffet, yo!

FYI, I am NOT a fan of buffets! When my brother wanted to spend his birthday here out of ALL the other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I wanted to say, "What?!?! Are you serious?!?! What the heck is wrong with you?!?! Do we really need 3000 calories in one meal???"

But hey, he was paying for our dinner at $36.95/person so I just kept my mouth shut. I'm sure my bratty face showed how I was feeling anyway. While dining here, I realized that the food was much better than most buffets. Actually, it's the best buffet I've been to so far.

Excellent dishes:
Thai Beef Salad
Crab legs
Smoked Salmon
Chicken with some kind of mango salsa
Pepperoni Pizza
And so many more but I can't remember cuz I was in a food coma.

Not so great dishes:
All the sushi rolls - rice was old, dry, tough. Sushi is never good at a buffet. I know this but I was curious, I just wanted to try it.
And some other things but I can't remember cuz I was in a food coma.

Then there's the dessert area....EEEEEEEEEEEEKKK!  It was HEAVEN!!! A crepe station, gelato, cookies, carrot cake, cheescakes, cupcakes, mousse, chocolate-dipped marshmallows, etc. The creme brulee was my favorite! I think I tried almost ALL of them. YAY for sugar!!! I had about 10 desserts on the table in front of me. WOOO!

Service was excellent! I wish I remembered the name of the guy who helped us with drinks and other things cuz he was really patient with the 18 of us. We needed more utensils, napkins, drinks and we changed the seating for the kids, our requests seemed endless but we didn't have to wait long to get them. When my family realized he was Filipino, they were all over him and kept asking him questions: "Where do you live?" "Where's your family?" "How long have you been here?" "Can you take our picture?" "Can you take one more?" "Okay, one more picture?" I felt sorry for the guy but it didn't look like it bothered him at all. He never stopped working or smiling while he was answering a billion questions...and thank you for taking 50 pics of us!

I had so much fun trying so many different things! I'm glad my brother celebrated his birthday here. For a buffet, this is really good!

We have dined here many times and brought a guest this time. The atmosphere in the main dining room is very nice as in a warm gentleman's clubby room kind of way. There are great paintings on all the walls including a great one of Mr. Rogers and there are several mounted animal heads high-up on some walls.
  
Their bread and the selection is very good including the pumpernickel and lavash. They serve butter that is some the best you can get. "European-style" Cultured Butter I would say.

From the Bar we ordered a Grey Goose martini with blue cheese stuffed olives perfectly made and the olives were some of the best I have had. The apple martini was weak for some reason but had good taste. With dinner a bottle of Concha y Toro, Marques Casa de Concha 2010 Carmenere went so well with our steaks.

To start I had the Wedge salad that was pretty good for sure right up there with some of the best. The lettuce was appropriately extremely cold and crisp. While the blue cheese dressing was good indeed, it could have been a little stronger of the blue for my own taste, but the tomato wedges and the bacon were outstanding. The Onion soup was tasty with a great topping of oozy melted crusty cheese.  We also had Wagyu Beef Carpaccio that I would grade outstanding.

Specials of the night are always worth a review and discussion with your server. Tonight, one that sounded great was a preparation of wild pacific salmon, but we were here for the steaks tonight.

My dry age strip steak was a very flavorful piece of meat and the tenderloin with porcini sauce and the poached lobster was a super combination, tender and flavorful, decadent perhaps; just great . The filet that we asked to be treated with the Kona was very good. Also at our table we had he porterhouse which was a good size, nicely done and very tasty. To reiterate a bit, we enjoyed good flavor with all the steaks and all were prepared as ordered.

Service, first and last was outstanding. Our server's knowledge was just short of encyclopedic. Everything about everything on their menu and anything about all the food and perpetrations she was able to recite.  She was very professional, fast and prompt in an apparent effortless and smooth manner. Wine she knew all about, yes she did. "Oh I think you would want that wine filtered", so she decanted our wine as her own recommendation for what we had. "Not going to finish the wine; want it back in the bottle", not a problem and immediately it was done. 
They are very busy on the weekends and when we arrived for our 8PM reservation the dining rooms were at 95 percent full. If you arrive without a reservation you might have a chance to eat in the lounge area high tops, bar, or the few tables in the area. 

If you like great dining and great steak and can afford an upscale price; Capital Grill is worth the occasional experience.

I'm a fan of Papa Murphy's. Some people are weird about buying pizza and sides that they have to bake at home, but that's just some people being weird. There is usually some type of deal going on and they send coupons in the mail, so with any type of deal it is really worth it considering what a frozen pizza costs and tastes like. You can call your order ahead or stop in and watch them make it fresh. You can choose lighter or extra sauce, cheese and toppings to customize the pizza to your liking. The employees inside this Papa Murphy's are friendly and helpful with going over specials, but when I went on grand opening day, the people there from Sunny 106.5 were very rude and didn't help represent Papa Murphy's well. I was actually relieved to find out it was the radio station being so rude and not the actual Papa Murphy's employees because it would have detoured me from going back. I did score a free pizza (the very last one, nice!) because they were giving out 100 free pizzas to customers that day. 

They have pizzas of all shapes and sizes. They have the mini-murph pizza kit to take home so your kids can put together a pizza for themselves and then see their creation after it bakes. The pizzas also come in signature, pan, delite and stuffed crusts. Most of the pizzas bake at 425 and only take around 10 minutes aside from the stuffed pizza which takes around 25 minutes. The pan pizza is definitely good, but beware when cooking the pan pizza and keep your eye on it because there is butter or something at the bottom of that one and it can burn easy if you let it go too long and when you take the pan pizza out of the oven it's really hot, so let it stand for 5 minutes before slicing. The cheesy bread comes in regular and thicker sizes, both being equally delicious. With a coupon I usually pay about $6 or $7 for a pizza and adding 2 sides it's $6, not including the thicker cheesy bread. One thing I tried on my last visit that I hadn't before is the s'mores dessert pizza. Wow that thing was good! I preferred the s'mores pizza much more than the chocolate chip cookie dough they offer and it is a great price as one of the 2 sides you can pick. My hubby likes the cookie dough here, but I personally do not. If you are signed up for the e-club they usually send you a coupon for free cookie dough on your birthday. They also have pumpkin shaped pizzas at Halloween time and heart shaped pizzas for Valentine's Day, usually at a special price that I like to pick up. All in all this is a decent take-n-bake pizza spot.

Tucked away in the strip mall, this small Cuban bakery has been overlooked and undervalued by many who don't frequent the area or knows very little about the cuisine. Once inside, there are only six small tables. The red tablecloths, glass dessert counter, tiled floors, and bright natural lighting coming through the doors nicely accentuated the dcor. Fellow Yelper Kurdy S and I were the only non-Spanish speaking customers during this afternoon. Like many of the nearby restaurants, the atmosphere was fitting as a casual lunch spot.

For appetizer, we shared the Tostones Rellenos de Roja Villeja ($4.49). The plate came with four fried green plantains holding a small scoop of tender shredded beef on top. The plantains had great texture on the outside to add to the soft green banana flavor on the inside. The beef was tender, flavorful, complex, and very nicely seasoned. I can eat these all day long.

We also had a side order of Plantanos Maduro Fritos ($2.49) that came with soft bananas served piping hot, perfectly fried, and sweet. It was nicely glazed, but also unexpectedly oily. 

Next, the Cuban Sandwich ($6.95) came with shredded beef, ham, and mustard. The bread had an awesome crunch with an excellent secondary chew. The sandwich was big enough to share and the dish also came with French fries. The way they kept it simple without all the fillers made this one of the best Cuban Sandwiches I've had so far.

Finally, the Filete a la Plancha ($9.99) came with a big serving of grilled sole, black bean rice, and salad. The sole was fresh, moist, tender, and had good flavor but slightly over salted. The black bean rice had great flavor and moisture--much better than the one at Victor's 1959 Caf. The lightly dressed salad provided a nice change of pace to the sole.

Antithetical to the cuisine's longstanding stereotype of being bland, this place simply rocks. Service however, was friendly but also inattentive, offbeat, and at times awkward. For instance, the food and bill took forever to come, and our water was never refilled even though the restaurant was not busy. Despite the shortcomings, interested diners should still come for the impressive lineup of dishes and great prices. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their other seafood and chicken items followed by their great looking desserts.

After my outstanding experience here, it goes without saying that Wolfgang Puck's take on steaks is a "cut" above the rest!

Tucked inside the Palazzo resort, Cut exhibited a refined contemporary appeal and warmth that was both inviting and comforting.  I especially enjoyed the service by Tara who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. 

After allowing us to peruse the menu for awhile, she returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts and I must say, they all looked enticing! 

Shortly after, we were served our wine and breads, which included the usual steakhouse suspects of fragrant & savory onion focaccia, pretzel roll, one of my personal favorites, mainly because of the firm outside texture and soft and chewy inside... and it wasn't too salty like most other pretzel breads I've come across. 
Parmesan bread stick took a close second  place for its addictive light, crisp & crunchy texture with a generous coating of Parmesan breading on the outside.

Bone Marrow Appetizer - From the buttery soft marrow to the warm, flavorful mushroom sauce, it was a blissful combination of ingredients and love. Simply unbelievable. If there's one single dish from this entire trip, I will be craving for months afterwards, it will definitely be this!

Steak Tasting 
American Kobe Style from snake river - paired with a house steak sauce. The beef was perfectly tender and seared beautifully leaving my mouthwatering for another juicy bite. The tangy flavor of the steak sauce was a perfect addition to the meat as it brought on a bright acidity to the steak. Let it be known, I'm determined to get the recipe for that irresistible sauce!!!!
USDA prime dry aged - much softer and juicier than the New York, this cut of steak was praiseworthy in every way. Honestly, it was a cut of perfection on a plate and the accompanying chimichurri sauce added a brightness to my palate that made it all the more satisfying. 
Australian wagyu from Blackmore -
Worthy of it namesake, was truly the best of the best. It's like they took 50 steaks and concentrated all the beefiness into one bite. The best steak I've ever had. It came with a barnaise sauce but honestly this piece needed nothing to dress it. It was perfect all on its own.

White corn had a fresh & crunchy bite with a slightly sweet caremelized exterior that added a pleasant rustic flavor to the dish 

Dessert
Baked Alaska - Tasted like a giant strawberry mochi. Btw, that's a good thing!  It also came with a small lemon bar, which had a lip puckering natural citrusy flavor!

Banana Creme pie came with chocolate ice cream, sauce, and chocolate crunch pearls. Now that's what I call a triple chocolate threat! Having said that, It was surprisingly mild and less cloyingly sweet, which I really enjoyed.

Before we left, Tara gave us more sweets in the form of a chocalate truffle cookie bar and a chewy peanut brittle...both were absolutely delicious! 

Service was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. But i'd have to say Tara made all the difference! She transformed a pleasant meal to an unforgettable dining experience with her natural charm and warm tableside manner, which easily made the evening five stars in my book!

Bravo to CUT for an exquisite meal and extraordinary service! 

You bet ill be back for an encore! 

Until then...

Happy Eats!

Whenever I get the inkling to play poker, this is one of my favorite places to play.  The decor is ornate yet sophisticated, crowded yet intimate, intimidating yet accommodating.  Where else are you gonna be able to find a poker game in town where Johnny F-ing Chan is standing a few feet from you chatting with the floor manager as you sip on an expresso, proceed to call down an all-in river bet after flopping the nut straight, and throw a few chips from the two stacks of high society that you just raked in to order Thai food from a restaurant within the Aria resort to be delivered table side?   Sounds too much like a deleted scene from Rounders but inevitably a true story starring yours truly, thereby prompting me to pay homage to one of the great poker movies by throwing in a few related quotes from Teddy KGB.  

"Mr. Son of a Bitch, let's play some cards!"
Offering a variety of game options ranging from 1-3 no limit and pot limit Omaha to higher stakes in the Ivey Room where you will likely spot a recognizable pro on any given day, there is constant turnover of players ranging from all levels of skill.  There is also a daily no limit hold-em tournament that starts at 7PM where first prize typically takes in a few thousand dollars and the top 5-6 get paid out on a $125 entry fee. 

"Just like a young man coming in for a quickie, I feel so unsatisfied"
Need some distractions from the cards?  There are multiple flat screen TVs broadcasting various sporting events and the sports-book is a few yards down if one needs to place bets.  The room has an open structure where one has an unobstructed view towards the entrance for people- watching as folks heading to and from the nightclubs stumble back and forth.  Unlike a lot of the other smaller poker rooms, the majority of the servers and a few of the dealers here are quite easy on the eyes (just saying). 

"Want a cookie?"
 If you need to refuel with food, Five-fifty pizza is a few doors down for a nice hearty slice and the Jean Phillipe patisserie is also a short walk for gelato, pastries, and packaged sandwiches/salads.   If you want to stay at the table, you will be hard-pressed to find the variety and quality of dining in any other poker room in town delivered to your seat with a cheesecake factory-like menu that offers a smorgasbord of options from various Aria restaurants on the premises.  Just be sure your eating habits don't serve as a tell when you have a monster hand like Teddy KGB crunching his Oreos.

"In my club, I will splash the pot whenever the fuck I please."
Complimentary drinks!  You can customize your coffee whether it be cappuccino, mocha, espresso served with a classy rock candy sugar stick in a hard mug (although you can request a plastic cup as well), or choose from a variety of sodas and juices including pineapple, watermelon, and  freshly pressed carrot (a few bucks extra), as well as Fiji bottled water, Perrier sparkling water, and I've seen a range of spirits ordered ranging from beer and tequila shots to red wine and cognac (these are the players you need to get in a hand with especially after they've knocked back a few, remember the words of Mike McD "it's immoral to let a sucker keep his money").

"Hanging around, hanging around. Kid's got alligator blood. Can't get rid of him"
Be sure to check in with your Mlife card since 2-3 dollars gets credited to your card with every hour of play, which can help comp for some of the meals above.  A masseuse is also available at an hourly rate on the premises to massage your backside as you play  if your back starts feeling the strain of a long session on the felt.

"That's a position raise.  I call"
Pro-tip: the weekends can often get very busy with long waiting lists.  If you call the number on the the yelp page, they accept calls to be placed on the list before you arrive in person.

"Nyet! Nyet! No More! No! Not tonight! This son of bitch, all night he, "Check. Check. Check." He trap me!"
The poker room is located within a short walk of the self-park lot so be sure to park on the 2nd floor for the shortest path to the tables as well as to minimize your walk of shame on those nights you are delivered a bad beat or on tilt.  

"Respect is all you have left in the morning!"
For any poker player, this is a quintessential Vegas experience where you get the opportunity to partake in exciting gambling action, great food/drink, people-watching and celebrity sightings, and hopefully a cinematic story to take home regardless of where the chips may fall.

I had been eyeing this place for a while because I heard the pastrami and corned beef was good here. Wrong! Maybe it used to be? First, they have no signs posted showing where this place is. They have the usual signs saying which way to go for what, but nothing for Zoozacrackers Deli. I finally looked up the number for Wynn and called to ask. I explained that I was standing in the casino and needed help finding this place! The woman who answered was polite and guided me to the correct place. Zoozacrackers Deli is attached to the sports book. The music being played is so loud that hubby and I had to yell at each other to have a conversation.

I walked up to the line that was somewhat long, but it moved fast. The woman who took our order was very friendly. Priced at $12.79 I ordered the "1/2 Deli Sandwich & Soup Combo" and because I wanted a Reuben it was $2 extra. I wanted to try their lemonade, but not at $5.50 a glass with no refills! The sodas are $3.79 each and you get free refills. The food took a while to come out, but when it did I couldn't wait to try it.

Reuben Sandwich - This was just flat out gross. All I could taste was swiss cheese and grease. The corned beef had no flavor. It looked good at first until I started to eat it and noticed the meat changes from a good color to fatty parts and gray colored parts. It just didn't look or taste like quality corned beef and the grease was all over my hands. The sandwich is supposed to come with sauerkraut yet it was in a small dish on the side of the sandwich. What the heck? Why wouldn't they have just put it on the sandwich to begin with since I didn't ask for it to be left off or anything? Weird. Also what is up with the size of this sandwich? I know I ordered the half sandwich, but when you have places like Greenberg's and Carnegie in town putting out the type of sandwiches they are, I can't see why anyone is coming here. Where's the beef?!?!?! I felt sick in my stomach from the grease and right after leaving ended up feeling sick through the night. No good.

Tomato Bisque - Size on this is great. The taste is blah. 

I expect more from a place inside the Wynn and was surprised at how dusty and dirty this place was. I did see a lady going around sweeping the floor, but a rag on the surrounding stuff would be awesome. Our total was $38.76 for 1 sandwich, 1 half sandwich, 1 bowl of soup and 2 sodas.  With other places that put out a much tastier sandwich and portion and the fact that I got sick and felt the price for what I got wasn't good, I wont be back.

                 PRICE FOR 2: $99.98 (TR price) + $8.10 (tax) + $16.42 (tip) = $124.50
                 WAIT: 25-30mins
                 SERVER: IRANDA - (1/5). We had to chase her down 3x, she ignored our table completely. When we asked for coffee, she brought us 1/2 empty cups (spilled coffee all over the saucers). VINCE (4/5), not our server, was friendly, paid closer attention & cleared our table multiple times.
_________________________

Bacchanal can be overwhelming since there are a LOT of dishes to choose from. Between Bacchanal & Wicked Spoon, if you only have time for one and care more about the selection - go to Bacchanal. (Save room for the CREPES!) 

THINGS I CRAVE: 1.) Lasagna, 2.) Prime Rib, 3.) Crepes, 4.) Machaca, 5.) Posole.

Personally, though, Wicked Spoon still wins in just a few minor areas: a few key dishes that are well executed, bone marrow at dinner, and smooth creamy gelato as opposed to the grainy ice cream at Bacchanal. It's also slightly less expensive, less crowded, and comes with much more consistently reliable service.

CONSENSUS: Would try to make time for both on my next trip to Vegas - Bacchanal for lunch, Wicked Spoon for dinner.

I wanted to try a new place for dinner and am glad we found this one. Here It's worth it for just the drinks alone! This place used to be a Pizza Hut, but once you step inside you forget about all of that. Inside was very clean and they offer plenty of seating. You walk up to the counter to place your order and then they give you a number to place on your table. When your food is ready it is brought out to you. Our food didn't all come at the same time which seemed odd. The girl who took the order was very nice and offered me samples of their freshly made drinks. 

Watermelon Agua Fresca ($2.50) - Very tasty and refreshing. I couldn't put it down! They have many other flavors just ask for a sample to see which you'd like. 

Mini Taco Al Pastor ($2) - This has onions cilantro, salsa and a fair amount of meat. I thought the tortilla tasted good and the taco was decent. Not as good as some of the street vendors I have been to, but decent for the price and nice flavor. They also have tacos similar to "Los Tacos' that are $4.50 each, but come with sour cream, rice, rice, beans, cheese, salsa and avocado.

Rice and Beans ($2) - Sadly, they were out of rice. I said that it was ok and I'd just try the beans. They apologized and gave us an extra side of beans instead. I was hoping with a place called Frijoles, that they would have amazing beans. I just thought they were ok. They weren't bad. Just nothing wow and could have used more seasoning or something.

Chips and Guacamole ($3) - I love that they use fresh avocados here! The guac tasted great, but could have used a bit more salt. The chips were very good.

Cheese Quesadilla ($2.50) - Simple yet tasty from the first bite. The tortilla tasted good and it wasn't loaded with cheese, but what was there could be tasted and it was good. Simple can be very good sometimes! 

I'm glad we tried this place and look forward to coming back and trying more. The only downside, they have no salsa bar. They need a salsa bar!

Five of us had dinner at The Carlton last night and it was a wonderful dining experience. 

For appetizers we had: 1 jumbo lump crab cake, 1 beet salad, 1 lobster and crab gnocchi, and 2 house salads. The Jumbo Lump Crab Cake which I ordered, was meaty with crab and was very rich sitting atop of Julianne vegetables. The Dijon Cream and fresh herb sauce it came with was just delicious. The gnocchi was tender and mild which allowed the lobster and crab to predominate the flavor profile. It was served in a Spinach, Caramelized Onions and Tomato-Ketel One Cream base. Very tasty indeed.
Salad eaters, house and beet, all said they were great as well. These were all very good size appetizers so you might save some for taking home if you plan on heavy entrees and tend to fill-up fast.

With the appetizers we also finished off two lemon cream martinis, one sour apple martini and one Grey Goose on the rocks with a twist, and one Arnold Palmer (AP refills aplenty). All drinks were made well. The had a nice martini list, a pretty good wine by the glass list and a full wine list which comes out on an iPad. Pretty cool approach. I am not counting but they say they have over 500 wines on the list. Enough to match any taste or meal. Later for dinner we wanted some rich, creamy full mouth Chardonnay so the proprietor suggested Sonoma-Cutrer for us. This was delicious and great match with our food.

Dinner entrees were hard to choose from the extensive menu which includes some great daily specials which they say usually change every day. Sticking with a theme, I went the seafood route all night and choose the Florida Grouper which was prepared oven roasted and was fresh Parmesan crusted and served with Lobster Pierogies, Spring Vegetables and Roast Garlic Butter. Oh my was this meal ever rich and tender. The Grouper was completely melt in your mouth fresh and tender, and I exaggerate not one bit. The Pierogies were moist, tender and full of lobster stuffing and it went so well with the Grouper. Boy this was a satisfying choice.
 
Three people, were enticed by the 14 oz. medium to medium rare Prime Rib. They all came out looking absolutely beautiful. Jody who is the real Prime Rib  connoisseur said that his ranked up with the best of them. Jody has traveled and lived or visited may cities for extended stays.  He has lived in Las Vegas so he had the opportunity to eat a Lawry's Prime Rib several times. To which I can say when I ate there with him a time or two, and I thought it was the best I ever had. So that puts The Carlton up with the best prime rib places in our judgment.
Linda went for the Ahi Tuna entre, which she said was extremely fresh and tender with the fabulous Tuna flavor one seeks in the best sushi. But it doesn't come naked. It's preparation is fresh Wasabi-Panko crusted with the Ahi Tuna seared rare and served with Curry-Coconut Orzo, Asian Greens, Hearts of Palm-Julienne Carrots and Yuzu Butter. This was a beautiful and tasteful preparation. Had enough to bring home and it served as a special breakfast this morning.

I have to say that everything was really outstanding at The Carlton. Topping it off with some personal service, Kevin Joyce, the owner stopped at our table to see if we were enjoying or meals.  Have to hand it to Kevin, his professional staff, and especially Executive Chef Mark Swomley who has been there for 16 years. The Carlton itself has been around for 27 years which I think is a real testament to its enduring quality and service. You can not go wrong here.

They say, you can never go home, or go back. Well, I've never bought into that. 

Over the years, we've been in almost a dozen or so Chart Houses. Sadly, many have closed due to whatever corporate reorg was going on at the time. I miss the ones in Steamboat and Newport, RI the most. Great locations and views. 

So it was with some excitement that we made reservations here for Easter Sunday dinner. Surprisingly, we have never been to this location.

We arrived a few minutes before six and found our hostess in a middle of a hiccups fit. I offered to frighten her but she decline. I guess I was scary enough. LOL

There was also some confusion over our reservations, but it didn't last long. We were escorted to our table, over by the window with a magnificent view of the lake. You got to give Chart House credit for choosing some great locations!

We started with a glass of Merlot and Pinot each. Both were very good for house wines. We also opted for the salads, the warm bacon dressing was delicious, as was the Caesar.

Things started slowly declining from here. I asked about getting their Callahan Prime Rib End Cut ($33.99). Seems the kitchen couldn't make up their minds if they had one. 

First it was no, then yes and finally surprise, they delivered a regular cut. It was tasteless with no flavor at all. When we were paying I mentioned it to our server, all they could say was, "oh yeah."  Grrr. LOL. The other entree was their Beef Tenderloin Medallions ($31.99) which was very good. 


For dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake to share with some coffee. It came damaged and somewhat of a mess. LOL. See our photo, versus the Chart House one. Our waiter apologized saying they should have been picked it up sooner. (Okay, why didn't you bring us another one?). 

The current owners of Chart House is Landry, a very classy and sharp organization.  I would suggest they work on this location before they need to close this one too. 

Our bill, including two glasses of wine ran us $80.00 a person, including taxes and gratuities. 

Now why didn't we go to Capital Grill I wonder?  Well, maybe next time.

For a positive review of a Chart House, I call your attention to my friend Norm's recent experience in Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz/forte-european-tapas-bar-and-bistro-las-vegas?hrid=Gpo-2lh59Bru8sKqgRm5Hw

After the last 2 visits, I feel differently about this Cabo location. Not all of the Cabo's are consistent and now this one isn't either. Major bummer! There was no line when hubby and I arrived, but we still stood there waiting for about 10 minutes before someone noticed us. I would have wondered if they were even open, but I called prior to see if they had a wait and any specials going and the girl who answered the phone said to come on down. Then once we were seated it took another 10 minutes to have chips, salsa, bean dip and drinks brought to out table. It would have been nice if we were acknowledged sooner.

We ordered "Chili Con Queso" priced at $5.99 to start. This is the one thing here that is still consistently good. It has a blend of cheeses with onions, tomatoes, serrano chilies and comes with tortilla chips. For the price it is a great deal and goes a long way. I had the AYCE "Crispy Tacos" for my meal priced at $8.99 that included beans and rice. The beans were cracked on top and hard. The rice was so dry and flavorless. My tacos (chicken and ground beef) had a terrible flavor and the bottoms of the taco shells were so greasy and soggy that when I picked up my first taco the bottom fell out. I would have asked for new tacos, but the place was packed and I only saw 2 servers and one person clearing tables, so flagging someone down wasn't easy. I had honesty gotten my fill with the chips, salsa, bean dip (it wasn't cracked and hard like the beans on my plate) and chili con queso anyway and didn't want to wait any longer than we had been waiting during our experience already.

Our server was nice (what I saw of him) and I could tell he was really trying, but with very little staff on hand he could only do so much. Maybe if they had the proper amount of help they could have put out better dishes like I have had in the past and service would have been more timely and just all around better.

I really enjoy the Sicilian pizza from the Cugino's across town, so when I noticed this location I wanted to check it out. Before walking in, I noticed a sign at the door promoting their current specials. When I saw they offered a 2 slice Sicilian special with drink I knew that would be what I wanted to get. I have been in more than once and the same sign is out front with several different specials on it, but they don't always have them all available. So far each time I have been in (even at dinner time) they don't have any Sicilian ready unless you order a whole pizza. They only have had some regular slices available. When I asked the guy behind the counter about it, he said that it just depends what time you get there and says they sell out quick. If people like it so much why not have more of it ready? Oh well I do agree it's tasty! I ended up getting the 2 slice special with a drink. For just cheese slices it's only $4.99 and with pepperoni it's $5.99 which isn't bad at all. The slices are decent size and like how the crust is thin yet has just the right crispness to it. I have eaten inside, but I have also taken my lunch back to work with me and I like that the pizza is still nice and warm and the crust isn't soggy by the time I drive back and eat it. This is a plus because let's face it, not all take-out tastes the same once you get it home vs. eating it right when you get it. The inside is clean and the employees are friendly. Definitely better than average pizza, so if you are in the area give it try.

I am still alive. I am still grateful. I still remember. 

This week, I celebrate the outcome of a lifesaving surgery. This time each year, I take a road trip to remember how lucky I am to be alive and the life lessons that I learned from almost dying. 

El Cortez. A great find. A bargain-priced well-run, cleaner-than-most hotel in old-school downtown dirty Vegas. This location is perfect for a variety of traveler's wants, especially mine.

Steps from the double-decker 'Deuce' bus which runs the strip 24 hours a day starting here. If you have no means of transportation or just love saving lives by letting sober hands take the wheel, having the Deuce, ($7 per 24 hours) steps away is critical.

I didn't love Vegas my first visit. I flew in from LA, stayed at Cesar's Palace, took taxis to and from exclusive nightclubs and fancy steak houses with my former-frat-boy ex. 

Since, I've stayed at a gamut of convenient-to-the-strip hotels, found a nonexclusive place to dance and liked it. But I didn't love Vegas until I found the old-timey Vegas that resides at the Fremont street experience, steps from El Cortez. 

Why I prefer 'downtown' to 'uptown' in general represents one of the reasons my nickname at Yelp is "grassroots girl". The other, is that this account, like all my social networking, began to respond with an authentic voice to corporate injustice. My commitment to the ideology behind both is also what I celebrate this week, why I came & why I loved it here.

I lost my memory once years ago. Can you imagine waking up ten years from now with no memory of the time passing within those ten years? That was me, years ago. 

I was a broke teenager with lavender hair who carried picket signs and fronted a rock band, 13. When I woke up, I was VERY different, twenty something. It wasn't just the blond hair or the fancy car in my driveway that was different, I didn't know my mail carrier's name nor did I care. *The good news about finding out the bad news about yourself, is that you can change.

I'll be prone to falling in love with "uptown" things forever. I will fall off the course once set for myself, ideals included. Ridiculous insecurities will drive my wants to "fit in" and "be accepted". I'll have the opportunity to be both ashamed or proud of where I came from.

With any luck, I'll hang on to 'grassroots' ideals. Won't be easy. Once a year, I will take a road trip to remember how I'd once forgotten everything I stood for on the path to acceptance from everybody but me.

If you want access to the most exclusive nightclubs, if you like the limelight, if you steer from classic towards the newest, coolest, chicest, you might not like it here. If you send your food back because it never meets your standards, if you only frequent the "in" spots only when the "in" crowd is there, this might not be for you. 

If you have not yet deleted all memory of the years spent turning your once-idealistic values to shit, you might choose to stay elsewhere. There was a time in my life when this place wasn't up to my standards.

 I was an asshole. A bitch. A stuck up jerk who only cared about the label beneath her lapel and the logo on her car keys. I'm not saying that I'm not all of the aforementioned still. (I am) It will be a lifetime uphill battle to avoid becoming that way again completely. Loving my stay here is proof that I have not fallen all the way off the tracks.

We had two double beds on the 5th floor. Room 5509 had a GREAT view from the window. We used the coffee maker to make hot water for tea. (the coffee is meh) We watched the big flat-screen TV for the weather report. Over 100 degrees!

A fridge was given to us on request, on the house. We filled it with fruit, drinks and milk for cereal which we purchased from the bodega spotted from our beautiful window view. 

We took advantage of the Shea butter lotions, soaps and high-end toiletries provided. We used the lush bath towels and called down for more. We took some extra towels to the dingy pool 2 blocks away, but we had the pool all to ourselves so had a great time swimming anyway.

I drank espresso every morning from the coolest cafe/record store/art gallery in the world located just steps away. We watched the 'Tribute To Queen' show at the Fremont experience where water was 2 for $1. deep fried Oreo cookies, 99 cents each & green cans of cream ale, 2 bucks. 

We shared steak dinners ($6.99) in the middle of the night when the "gambler's specials" roll out. We treated ourselves to a  $6.25 breakfast buffet (coffee & OJ included) from Vegas Club down the block. We waited behind the wise elderly locals outfitted with walkers and wheel chairs who smiled at us. We smiled back. 

We slept all day in the cool comfort of personalized AC without hearing neighbors or slot machines. We felt safe leaving the casino late-night. Highly recommended. Will return. Hopefully, grassroots forever.;-)

We were fortunate enough to have lunch here today - on their soft opening day.

This is a rare opportunity in Vegas to enjoy plates prepared by a Michelin starred chef himself, not just by a name on its signage.

Eventually this place will be a kaiseki restaurant - a traditional multi-course Japanese dinner - of only 12 seats, but due to limitated availability of uncommon ingredients required for kaiseki, liquor license, etc. they will only offer Japanese comfort food lunch in the coming months.

It was a three-course lunch for $20:

- First course: Triple layered vegetable soup served chilled - Seven vegetables in the first layer, soy sauce based brown gele in the second layer, avocado and egg white with Japanese sake in the third layer
- Second course: Petite Assorted Appetizer - Flavored edamame, marinated cucumber with sweetened miso, yuzu flavored shrimp, soy flavored Japanese taro potato, deep fried lotus roots
- Main course (choose one from three): a) Chicken Rice Omelette - egg omelette over white steamed rice sauted with ketchup, onion, green peppers, chicken, bacon and mushroom. b) Tonkotsu Ramen Noodle Soup Wok Charred - pork based ramen. c) Black Curry over Steamed Rice - traditional Japanese style curry over white steamed rice.

The first cource - the three layered soup was amazing. Very complex tastes mingled on my tongue, the potato-ish veggie flavor on the top followed by the sweet gele, deepened with the avocado. All completely grated, but I was still able to tell the texture, scoop and taste individually or all at once.

There came the second, more traditional kaiseki-like appetizer. This time, we could see the basic attributes of natural ingredients were preserved, yet amusing presentation of craftsmanship was well displayed. The finish of shrimp was like what we eat for Osechi that would bring back old timey memories. Satoimo (Japanese taro) came with tangy rock salt. Cucumber came hocho-crafted with mildly sweet moromi-miso. Deep fried lotus roots had perfect crunchiness that played nice in the mix. However, the edamame was lacking the finishing touch. Not only that the flavor was nothing special, it felt awkward to pull out beans from the pod by hand.

We chose Omurice (Rice Omelette) and Tonkotsu Ramen for the main.

As much as I would like to say the Omurice was perfect, it was also pretty basic to be honest. Considering that Omurice has been less accepted in the US market, I can understand that the straightforward path is a safe bet, but for matured taste buds like ours, some you-cannot-do-it-at-home factors seemed to be missing. My personal preference is rice less steamed and eggs more runny. Also I personally like demi-glace sauce better, or at least the ketchup could use some twist.

Now the best part- the tonkotsu ramen! I was blown away. I know it's like cheating to compare ramen elaborated by a kaiseki chef with shops serving bowls in every 60 seconds, it was the best ramen I've had in this competitive Las Vegas market. The broth had very intricate flavors, but was not too greasy or heavy. Quite contrary, the aftertaste was pleasantly light. Chashu was a little sweetened, which added a unique perspective. Typically noodles are straight and thin for tonkotsu, but wavy noodles used by Omae worked to fully enjoy this rich-yet-not-too-rich broth.

In the end, all those three (plus drink) for $20 was a well considered price point. It's on a high-end for lunch, particularly for local clientele, but is a steal for the quality of food and service.

Some obvious opening day flaws aside, this place is very promising. I spotted some misses in the food as described above, but I will hold off my full review until they start offering kaiseki, a big missing piece in the Las Vegas culinary scene.

4 stars + 1 for a forward looking factor.

I shouldn't give this place a two because the description says, "Meh.  I've experienced better."  Well, I haven't experienced better because this is my only experience with a male strip club.  

I should give this place a big fat ZERO because I'm pretty sure the bartender roofied me.  

Why do I think he roofied me?  Let me tell you.  

A friend of mine had her bachelorette party in Vegas and her maid of honor thought up this brilliant idea of making us all wear corsets- bridesmaids/friends in black and the bride in white.  Well, I'm rather busty, but luckily I saw my drunken future and prepared for the inevitable.  More about this later. 

So, we make The Olympic Garden our first stop and right away the guys bombard us.  They cornered us individually so that we couldn't consult on who everyone was buying lap dances for, and thus we all bought multiple lap dances for the same people.  This is when I learned that lap dances make me uncomfortable, especially if I haven't even had a damn drink yet.  I actually made the poor guy so uncomfortable he asked me if I was feeling ok.  I just don't find guys who kiss their own biceps while gyrating on top of me sexy... I find it funny and maybe a little sad, but not sexy.  

After I was dance raped, I made my way to the bar where I recognized the bartender.  My dad owned a bar and I knew this guy had totally worked for him (Note to self- my dad must be a real asshole if this guy did indeed roofie me [sorry daddy, but I'm sure you stopped reading at dance rape if for some reason you stumbled upon this review] and also, this is a small, small world).  So, I asked the guy and after finding out who I was he started pouring me shots.  I had about three the entire time we where there.  Trust me, I can handle three shots and this was all I had to drink for the rest of the night.  Not only that, but he was the only person who came in contact with these shots other than my mouth.  

This is where my memory gets fuzzy and eventually it just goes dark, but before I forget who I am I decide it'd be fun to call home and tell my dear old dad who I ran into.  Thank God my brother answered and screened the call.  I don't even know what I said to him, but he told me I was pretty out of it.  Last memory from here on out is an image of the limo pulling up and my friends piling in. 

The next day.  I wake up in my hotel room with a start.  I have no idea where I am at first.  I have no idea how I got there and I have no idea how I got out of the corset from last night.  This is where my friends and my boyfriend at the time fill me in.  Luckily, he just happened to be there for the bachelor party, but unfortunately my near death state forced him to miss out on all the stripper action.  Haha, sucker.  

So, apparently I was completely gone like I'd never been before.  I fell down multiple times in public places and even knocked a friend into an open trash can.  It was so bad that a security guy at MGM Grand offered me a wheelchair, but my friends were afraid he was just some random guy trying to molest me so they continued to lug me around.  I had horrible bruises all over my body the next day to prove just how embarrassing this all must have been.  Here is where my good planning for a drunken future comes in.  I knew that my corset had a tendency to slip, so I wore a lace cami underneath just in case I got too drunk to pay attention to wardrobe malfunctions.  This proved rather smart because all the falling down pulled my corset right off of you know what.  If I hadn't been wearing that cami I would have looked like I was dressed for a topless review. 

I also puked in a cab at some point.  The cab driver started yelling in another language and a girl I barley knew caught my freakin' throw up in her hands.  IN HER HANDS! 

Once they got me to the room, I was completely out.  I mean, dead to the world.  Well, until I guess one girl got on my nerves enough to wake me out of my stupor.  My friends told me she was complaining about everyone wanting to wait around a bit to make sure I was okay.  So, I popped my head up long enough to say, "Be cool, bitch."  That was the last thing I would do or say until the morning.

My poor boyfriend got wind of the state I was in and said I looked like a dead person when he went up to check on me.  He missed out on the rest of the night for fear I would stop breathing.  Apparently, I was completely non-responsive.  

The next day, I wanted to kill myself.  I have never felt a hangover like that in my entire life.  It was HORRIBLE.  

In conclusion, I have no way of knowing what was in those drinks.  All I know is that no amount of binge drinking ever rendered me completely unconscious and without memory of an entire night worth of events.  Everything after leaving the strip club is like a dark hole in my memory- it's just blank, as if the rest of the night didn't even exist.

P.S.  I highly identified with The Hangover... for obvious reasons.

When I was asked to dine at a AAA Five Diamond, Forbes Five Star, Three Michelin Star, Wine Spectator Grand Award and Chef of the Century's restaurant, the question wasn't IF...It was WHEN!

My last night in Vegas marked the unforgettable occasion and as soon as I opened those shiny glass paned double doors, I knew I was in for a treat!  As I walked across the foyer into the main dining room,  I left the hustle and bustle of the frenzied casino behind me and I was instantly transported into a luxurious 1930's style French bistro with a huge crystal chandelier cascading above me. Honestly, this place was dripping with opulence!
Truth be told, I do get a bit uncomfortable in fancy schmancy restaurants.  Perhaps it's the well pressed white table cloths or the half dozen stuffy staff serving my every whim, but this place was not like that at all.  The servers were warm, friendly and present without being overbearing, which was really nice!  Add to that the elegant yet inviting atmosphere and I was feeling like a king! A hungry one at that!    
 
As soon as we were seated and handed our nicely bound menus, I instantly knew in my mind that I wanted to try the 16 course tasting menu.  Heck, you only live once, right? 

Because we were in a festive mood, we decided on a bottle of bubbly and for me, a bottle of Veuve Clicquot fit the bill perfectly!

Then came the famous bread cart in all its glory! Wow! It was a sight to see! There were more than a dozen breads to choose from to start the meal and i think we tried almost all of em!  Three magnificent breads, however, stood out from the pack.  Those being the buttery cheese brioche, savory bacon epi, and chewy cheese baguette.  

Then, of course, came the food! Honestly, it was so beautifully plated there were times I simply felt it was a shame to eat it! But I got over that hurdle fairly quickly. 

Now, I don't plan on boring you with the entire 16 course blow by blow, but I will focus on the dining highlights which made the evening extra special for me!

Amuse Bouche "sangria emulsion" refreshingly light citrusy blood orange cream emulsion above a chilled jam in a whimsical dry ice bowl with small chunks of apples and berry sangria gelee.  Lip smacking tartness with a delightfully smooth & creamy finish! Excellent way to awaken the palate!  

Trio of Caviar 
Caviar with Asparagus - Although not the most interesting pairing of the evening, the flavors of the fresh green asparagus and salty caviar played well against each other. 
Salmon Tartare with Shiso Sprouts and Caviar - The textures were delicate and the flavors were refined.  
Daikon Cous Cous with Caviar - The thin delicate slivers of cool daikon wrapped around fluffy cous cous and topped with caviar was an exhilarating finish to an interesting play on Japanese cuisine.       

Lobster - Topped with fragrant black truffle, the langoustine ravioli was magnificent! The grilled lobster was simple yet beautifully presented. Subtle flavors but hey it's lobster! Sometimes a good thing shouldn't be messed with! The smooth & creamy sea urchin fennel potato puree was inspiring and texturally inviting, as well.

Chestnut Soup over Foie Gras Foam - Rich frothy and flavorful with savory bacon bits. The chunks of roasted chestnuts added a subtle sweetness to this warm and rustic soup. 

Bone marrow - One of my personal favorites! The marrow was luscious, rich and supple in texture. It also exhibited the most irresistible aroma! The popcorn added a pleasant textural dimension to this delightful dish.

Sea bass - Beautifully seared, this magnificent piece of fish came bathing in an irresistible butter sauce. The artichoke balanced the flavor profiles nicely. 

Birthday Cake - As the evening came to a close, the staff came out with a cart embellished with lavish decorative baubles and a small sign that read "Happy Birthday" The accompanying birthday cake was extraordinary! Perched on a large black pedestal, it was absolutely majestic but all I could think of was digging into it!  To my surprise, it was a mango meringue ice cream cake and although we couldn't take it home with us, we did indulge in two large decadent slices and it was fantastic! Bravo to the dessert chef!

If that wasn't enough we were given free reign of the mignardises (dessert cart) that had a vast selection of petit fors, small cookies and yes...macarons!

They boxed up the cookies and gave us an additional box of marshmallow treats to take home with a copy of the menu and a nicely bound colored brochure documenting the magical evening.

I'd have to say this was by far the most amazing dining experience
of my life.  Would i do it again? Someday. 

But for now, I'll just revel in the fine memories of an unforgettable evening that will leave my palate in infinite bliss!

Happy "Birthday" Eats, Part Deux!!

First and foremost this is my first review and I cant believe how absolutely appalled I am.  But, here it goes.....So my wife and I are in town for a family emergency and decided to have lunch because we had a lil time on our hands. We drove past HAG on LV blvd and it caught my eye because of the name and I love a great burger. Upon entering I was excited and looking forward to it the place seems almost like a Hooters but for Burgers. The smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicky for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear items that others have wore before but I figured hey WTH the waitress we had was very personable and  nice but was new. the prices were very high for such a simple menu. My wife ordered the smallest burger and fries and I was talked into the Quad bypass burger. with like 20 strips of bacon! I asked our waitress if the restaurant offered military discount as I often do when I am on a budget and travelling. She said "Let me ask" upon returning she said "No sorry" I was thanked her for asking. Either way I though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so I was looking forward to the food regardless. At this point I was very excited and amused on the place and was talking to my wife about how this place should/would be a goldmine. They offered malt liquor (Strange in a restaurant)in a can I ordered a Tecate she a sugar Coke.
Now for the twist of events..... Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes which is great but I was skeptical, The Burger was massive and looked so good but it was warm to the touch at best I had approx 3 bites and noticed the bacon looked as if had been microwaved from being cooked days ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistency-(Gross) The cheese was not melted, The fries looked like they were cooked in old oil due to the almost black color in nature. I tried my hardest to stomach this but I couldnt. I proceeded to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cooked to order at first she replied yes and then said something that made me raise an eyebrow, she began on informing me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old because of the way the owner is. I asked her to elaborate and she said he is so cheap that he makes his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut costs. She also informed me she almost walked out her second day on the job because of what he acts like in his day to day operations. She looked excited when I asked to speak to him about the quality and preparation of my food. When the Owner/manager Jon came to the table he sat down opposite from me and was very hostile. At this point I was pretty much amazed I would assume he would address my concerns in a professional and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimidation and apprehension. I said I would please like another burger due to the dissatisfaction of it not being fresh. He looks at myself and my wife and says' " In six years I have never comped a meal and it won't be today!!" I proceeded to inform him I simply wanted another burger and I am not looking for a comp. He then informed us that he would call the police if we didnt pay I said I would not pay for a burger like this especially one that i didnt touch. From his demeanor at this point I wanted to leave so i said look I will pay for my wifes and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this quality of food.
At this point I felt threatened and was basically being held against my own will. I said fine Please call the police. He proceeds to lean over and say, You know what " you started it when you asked for a discount" I was like "What"? He then says I cant stand the "F" ing military I was so appalled that he was addressing me like this in general and then he begins to say, I'm from Oxnard, Ca. and we used to beat the "S" out of filthy mexicans like you! At this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief He leaves and the table next to me were also expressing there disgust in the food and as he saw us speaking with them he said to leave right now we were trespassing! As I leave I attempt to tip my waitress and he rips the money from my hand! My wife and I wait outside for the police THE WHOLE TIME WE are waiting quietly the owner is harrassing us going on a tirade about my race and my occupation being totally distasteful in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up (LVPD) I provide them ID and they are in absolute disbelief they resolve the issue after questioning and bottom line it does not matter the police officer said I had to pay I totally understand and uphold the law but requested that I receive what I pay for (At least I gave it away to a homeless man.
BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: 1. DO NOT GO THERE FOR QUALITY OR FRESHNESS  IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS NOT 2. THE OWNER IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING. 3.YOU ARE WARNED. PLEASE DONT BE ROBBED OR DEGRADED LIKE ME  GO ANYWHERE ELSE.

This was supposed to be a very special dinner as it was my husband's birthday and we had plans to see the DVE comedy tour following dinner along with drinks after.  Unfortunately our dinner at Ten Penny made the rest of the evening very uncomfortable for my husband and very upsetting for me.  I will start with a positive.  We had reservations at 5:30 on a Friday, and for some reason hit like the worst traffic driving into town.  I was getting nervous about being late so I called to see if we could bump up our time 15 minutes.  The lady checked and said yes provided we left by 8:30 because that table was reserved by another party then.  That was no problem and she accommodated my request.

When we arrived we were seated at a semi-circle booth type table along the wall.  I liked the view and the openness of the restaurant.  I ordered a Sangria.  It was ok, sort of weak on the alcohol part.  For my next drink I ordered a Rapture Helltown IPA, which I was told 5 minutes later they just ran out, so I had to pick something else...   Since this was my husband's birthday I was encouraging him to eat whatever he wanted as I was treating and since neither of us had eaten that day I knew he was hungry.  He decided on a BBQ Chicken Flatbread for an appetizer were I had the mussels.  I enjoyed my mussels minus one thing.  They only came with one piece of bread.  I LOVE mussels, but the broth is right up there with what makes them awesome so one piece was inadequate.  I requested more bread, and the waitress asked if I wanted the "bread basket"?  Sure... Ok this part stinks.  The bread in this basket was not suitable what-so-ever for sopping up mussel broth.  There were two muffins, I believe blueberry and raspberry, a dinner roll, and some old twisty roll.  This bread clearly was not the like the crusty bread I had a mere piece of originally.  Ok that was disappointing as I left almost all the broth in the bowl.  I noticed my husband eating his flatbread fast at first and very slow at the end.  Really unusual.  

Onto the main course.  I ordered the seared duck breast, that came with Jasmine Rice, a ginger root puree, with baby bok choy, and a saba glaze prepared medium rare.  My husband ordered the traditional burger, just lettuce and tomato medium cooked.  My thoughts on the duck were mixed.  The duck, though cooked properly lacked seasoning and the worst part was they didn't render down the thick fat surrounding the meat which is unappealing and inedible.  This is cooking 101, render fat down.  The rice was overdone and gummy, but I did like the bok choy with the glaze.  I looked at my husband who was eating his burger slower than a vegetarian with a gun to their head.  "What's wrong?"  I ask. He starts to say he isn't feeling real good all of a sudden, stating he thinks he has heartburn... Not a good sign.

So we finished up and paid.  I spent well over 10,000 pennies on this Ten Penny meal...Pretty pricey meal.  We headed on down to catch the show.  Here is why I wouldn't give Ten Penny a second chance.  Only 15 minutes into the show, my husband is in visible pain.  Grasping his gut he bolts out of the theater and missed most of the second comedian's act leaving me sitting alone watching the event I also spent well over 10,000 Pennies on for his birthday present.  He returns 20 minutes later to tell me how he just tossed his entire dinner and felt awful.  He said it started at the flatbread, as he noticed it wasn't really cooked all the way (doughy) but ate it anyway.  He said as soon as he finished he started to begin to feel sick.  He felt really awful the rest of the night and just as a reminder this was HIS BIRTHDAY!!!  I am not a happy camper that I take him here for his birthday, spend a decent amount of dough, only for him to get sick maybe poisoned and miss some of the show we went to and feel awful the rest of the night.  I would like to go two stars since the service was adequate, accommodating, and friendly but I think most can understand why I just can't.

The food is outstanding but you have to wait for it. Is it worth it?

The Oyster Bar is inside the Palace Station Casino. The bar only has 18 seats. 

We got here at 8:30 pm on a Monday thinking we could avoid the infamous wait. No such luck, eleven people ahead of us in line. The line did not move for 40 minutes. When it finally moved, it went quick. At the one hour mark, we got seated. Yay. 
Well not so fast. 

After you're seated, you're given a sourdough roll and butter. Thank you, thank you thank you. We were starving and that helped a lot. A few minutes go by and they take our order. We waited so long I memorized what we wanted a half an hour ago lol. 

40 minutes later our soup comes out. 
An hour & 15 minutes from being seated we got the oysters. 
At the two hour mark from being seated we got our entrees. 
3 hour 15 minutes from waiting in line to finishing our meal. 
Was it worth it?

Here's the rundown:
New England Clam Chowder - Delicious. The bowl was full of clams and the soup was just outstanding. 

Oyster (a dozen) - was so so good. Cocktail sauce, horseradish and lemon accompanied the oysters. One of the best oysters I've ever had. The chef was having problems with one of the oysters (didn't want to stay in the shell) we were playfully teasing him about it and he was such a sport about it. We all had a good laugh and he put an extra oyster in for us. A bakers dozen, all delicious. 

Plaza Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab, chicken and andouille sausage. It's my first pan roast and it was delicious. The brandy and cream was a good combination. All the proteins were cooked perfectly. I specially liked the andouille sausage, a little hint of spiciness worked well with the broth.  I got a number 7 on the heat scale. It was not spicy for me at all. I could not finish my bowl, it was so rich and I had a lot of oysters. Lol. I will have a good lunch tomorrow for sure. 

I was also able to taste the following dishes. 
Combo Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab and lobster. My Mom's choice. Zero on the heat scale. It was as good as mine. Tasted the lobster and that was very good. Good amount of it too. Lol. 

Bouillabaisse - was so good. My brother's dish. 7 on the heat scale. It was spicy. Ouch. But it was really good. The broth was clean and very flavorful. It had shrimp, crab, lobster, mussels & clams. Great broth. I would get this next time. 

Service was excellent. The chef was friendly and entertaining. 

The wait. It didn't bother me at all. It was more entertaining than anything else. I got to talk to other people waiting in line and making fun of the situation we were in. I even got to meet a couple of local Yelpers and she told us about a Korean/Mexican fusion restaurant (Komex). The 3 hours went by really fast. 

It's an experience I won't soon forget and isn't that why we go to these places and go through all the hoops. Lol
Was it worth it?
I say Yes!!

We had great service
We had great food. 
We had great conversations
We had a memorable night. 

I'll definitely be back

***Bellagio has many iconic Las Vegas elements like the fountains, their seasonal gardens, the popular Cirque du Soleil show O, and high-end cuisine; these features make Bellagio a must visit to at least just take a look; however (on my visit), my room was not as nice as other upscale hotels I have stayed at on The Strip***

When I first visited Las Vegas a long time ago, Bellagio was the most talked about hotel and the most upscale hotel (or at least near the top) on The Strip.  Since then, there have been many new hotels that have joined The Strip and some as elegant or even more elegant than Bellagio.

Bellagio definitely has a beautiful exterior with the impressive and vast lake as well as the signature fountains.  Inside, you will find the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens--a constantly changing (with the seasons) exhibit that makes for a good photo opportunity.  Bellagio also features quite a few notable fine dining spots including Picasso, Le Cirque and Michael Mina.  There is also a gourmet French patisserie (Jean Philippe) though all of these great things are open to the public and do not require a room stay, which is expensive though often less expensive than The Cosmopolitan, Wynn or Encore.

My room was nice.  It was fairly contemporary though there were a lot of traditional touches with the bedding and furniture.  The room did lack the sleek and modern look of the rooms at Aria.

The bathroom was nice--very spacious with standalone showers and bath tubs.  There were a few areas where the room could have been better.  The TV was an old fashioned deep TV and not a flat screen.  I often never turn on a hotel room TV though I imagine some would be disappointed to find such an outdated TV in an upscale hotel like Bellagio.

The other negative, which was a big one, was the room temperature.  The A/C unit was not that good and even after having maintenance look at it, the room just never got cool enough, which can be a concern here due to the very hot summers.  It seems other Yelp reviews indicate the same issue regarding poor A/C units.  However, I believe Bellagio has been refreshing the decor in their rooms so maybe these outdated elements and poor A/C units have been (or will be) improved (I think they have moved onto flat screen TVs).

Also included in the stay was access to the fitness center, which was nice.  The pool area was also nice--many different pools and lots of greens, fountains and other scenery if you are just looking to lounge around.

Service was friendly and prompt.

Room rates are high at Bellagio, but there are times of the year where you can find reasonable room rates.  Bellagio has a room rate calendar on their website, which makes for a useful tool to help you pick a time to stay at Bellagio (best room rates are often during the week though and several top Vegas shows are dark and high end restaurants are closed in the early part of the week).

I wished I liked my room more at Bellagio.  I actually liked Caesars Palace more.  I have heard the quality of the room really varies at which tower you stay at Caesars Palace, but the room I had there felt nicer, more elegant and more comfortable than Bellagio.  And even though my first stay at Aria was at a very small room, my second stay there was at a much bigger room and its modern and sleek look felt more upscale than Bellagio.

If you can get a good room rate at Bellagio though, it can be a good hotel choice on The Strip.  It is still a nice hotel and it has a great location--right next to Caesars Palace and The Cosmopolitan, which is a real hot spot right now.  Even if you do not stay at Bellagio, it is a must visit for first time Las Vegas travelers to check out the Fountains of Bellagio, the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens and some of their food (either a more cost friendly option like Jean Philippe or one of their upscale restaurants like the good-for-Vegas Picasso).

Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free valet and self parking.

This is the BEST steakhouse off the strip.  And even with that, Echo & Rig has SO much more going for it!

I came here with a 8 adults and 4 kids for my wife's birthday dinner on a very busy Saturday night.  Even though they normally don't take reservations, the manager I spoke with on the phone the day before (Cheryl) was very helpful as I had my eye on the big long striped wooden table that was pictured on their site and they saved it for us.  We arrived a few minutes before and were treated to passed hors d'oeuvres of their homemade salami and smoked chicken.  Yum freakin yum.

With so many small plates offered, Echo & Rig is meant for groups so everything can be shared.  We split 3 salads and they all threw curveballs to the palate.  The kale salad with yellow beets, toasted hazelnuts and goat cheese was really nice.  Their "over the rainbow salad" was an explosion of flavor featuring farro, quinoa, red, yellow & orange bell peppers, corn, red onion, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, almonds, herbs & Champagne vinaigrette.  That's a vegetarian's dream right there.  And the fried spinach salad with red onion, cauliflower, broccoli was fantastic with the chile-lime vinaigrette was probably my favorite of them all.  The crispness of the spinach combined with the heat from the dressing was quite a combination.  

We ordered a bunch of small plates and the standouts for me were the cauliflower with chili de Arbol, crispy shallots and onions and the roasted garlic mashed potatoes with sharp white cheddar but the description didn't do that justice.  It was almost like a super hash brown with a really nice dijon sauce.  I was also able to sample the burnt peas, pumpkin squash, grilled thick cut bacon with bbq sauce (no sauce needed), butcher's sausage and mac and cheese.  All of them were solid options and everything was devoured by the group.  

I got the "Spencer Steak" which was one of the 3 ribeye cuts offered.  Each steak comes with a complimentary sauce and I went with charred onion but sauce just isn't necessary when the meat is awesome.  My medium rare cut was closer to rare but it was probably better that way.  It was everything you wanted in a steak...tender, juicy and flavorful.  My wife's rare filet mignon was cooked perfectly and just got better bite after bite.

Then there's the freakin value of it all!!  The priciest entree is only $35!  NO corkage fee (we brought 3 bottles), NO cake fee (got a cake from Patisserie Manon) and they lit the candles and brought it out.  The total bill for 8 adults and 4 kids came out to what 2 people would spend at Carnevino.  Total Wine and More is just across the way in Boca Park so pick something up there.  

I cannot wait to come back since there are so many other dishes I must try like bone marrow carne asada and Hawaiian cowboy.  I also can't wait for them to bust out their brunch and late night menus.  They also have tables set up on a balcony overlooking the Tivoli Village fountain which would make for a terrific date night.   

The staff was top notch from beginning to end and the experience here wouldn't have been as wonderful as it was without their great work.  They earned their tips and then some! I'm ready to go back for lunch.  

Say hi to the pig heads outside!!

I stopped in here for dinner and wasn't disappointed. It's inside Doc Holliday's if you can really say that since it seems more of a next door neighbor to the bar. I figured I would be walking through the bar to get to Maribel's and you can, but the door I went into led me straight inside Maribel's. Hubby and I were greeted right away and told to sit wherever we wanted. Our server was excellent! She got our drink order and brought us some chips and salsa right away. I usually like chunky salsa and this salsa was thin, but it had a lot of good, fresh flavor and the chips were tasty. For $3.99 I ordered a side of Chips and Guacamole and my oh my was it so good! It was made fresh to order and had such great flavor. I'm very impressed at the price of the chips and guac considering it was fresh and the portion was good. If you are a fan of guacamole you must try it here at Maribel's! They have daily specials for just $5 that includes a drink. 

Monday - Chicken Enchiladas 
Tuesday - Carne Asada Tacos
Wednesday - Fish Tacos
Thursday - Carne Asada Burrito
Friday - Chicken Sub
Saturday - Shredded Beef Burrito
Sunday - Hamburger or Cheeseburger

I was there on a Tuesday, so I decided to go with the Carne Asada Tacos. You get 3 tacos, rice, beans and a drink. If you want flour tortillas you can also get that for no additional charge, but you get 2 tacos instead of 3 and our sever said they are bigger than the regular ones. Options are nice! The asada had good flavor and the tacos were filled nicely, especially for the price. The beans were good and the rice was even better. It's awesome that you can get quality food that tastes so good for $5 plus tax and leave stuffed. Inside was clean and they have TV's. I can't say enough about our server. She checked on us often and took the time to chit chat with us for a bit letting us know about other specials and I could tell she was genuinely passionate about the food being served here. They even take phone orders if you don't have time or want to eat inside. I saw several people picking up to-go orders. I don't live in the neighborhood that Maribel's is in, but when I am on this side of town, I will definitely be stopping by for some good grub!

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Imagine you had a long day. And you wanted to relax and indulge in something incredibly scrumptious, delectable, and sinfully good.  Well... Think Sow.  Salty Sow.

We were over near the PV Mall and we decided, spur of the moment, to get something nearby. We thought of sushi and a few other places. But then we saw the three golden neon arrows pointing to the front door of the Salty Sow. 

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
The Salty Sow has that nouveau feel to it. The bar is off to the left as you enter, with a large kitchen straight in front of you. You see a lot of wood and interesting lighting (photos). But the feeling is very intimate. Even with other diners nearby, you cannot hear their conversations. The clientele is mixture of millennials and older, with a dozen or so sitting at both the bar and the dinning area. 

MENU:
Like most places in the Valley, the Happy Hour menu is a jumping off point for the  Dinner menu. When you are seated you are given both menus. There seems to be no pressure to order off of one or the other. The focus of the food is all things pork. So if you love bacon, then you have found your Nirvana in this life. LOL

Almost all the items on the Happy Hour menu are $5,00 and you find things like: Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries, Truffled Deviled Eggs, Pork Belly Tacos and Braised Beef Tacos and much, much more

SERVICE:
Everything is relaxed and our server Holly was excellent.  Folks stop by and ask about your meal and dishes are bused quickly

FOOD:
Okay, the best thing we tried was the HH Fried Chicken that came with a honey glaze and a large sweet potato biscuit (photo).  Even here there was bacon on the underside of the chicken.  It was moist, flavorful and delicious!

We also order two tacos which were equally good that came with a fried egg on top (photo).  But you must try the Duck Fat Fries, which were seasoned with herbs and salt.  It also comes with a poached egg yoke on top (photo).  Great stuff.

PRICES:
Everything at Happy Hour is $5.00 and it ends at 6:30 with the ringing of a cow bell.  Ahh, "we need more cow bells!"  LOL  Our bill came to $37.50 before taxes and gratuities, including two items to go and a soft drink ($2.50).

Debbie Downer:
Just before the check, we asked our server if we could order two items to go.  We also asked what the up-charge would be.  To our surprise, she said it would be the same price.

As we were leaving, the Culinary Manager approached us and said: 
"We normally don't allow people to order off the Happy Hour menu to go."  As I stamered to say we had checked first with our server, she said: "I'm going to let it go this time, but don't do it again."

I ate here for Restaurant Week Spring 2014 and again the following night from their regular menu. The portions here are nice and the different types of dishes on the menu make it hard to decide what to order. Our server, Perry is fantastic! He checked on us often and made sure everything was to our liking. Managers, Adam and Christopher also stopped by our table at different times to introduce themselves and make sure we were enjoying everything. I could tell that not just the managers care about the experience of every customer, but the servers and rest of the employees do too.

The cost for the RW week dinner was $30.14 per person which I found to be a very fair price considering what I got. I had the following:

Buddy's Caprese

Chicken Parm & Spaghetti

Zeppole

The next day I at the following:

The meal started out with warm bread and oil and balsamic. Nice start!

Buddy's Caprese ($16) - This salad is sooooo good! It had charred green beans, burrata, tomatoes and balsamic. The variety of tomatoes and different colors of them were nice. The tomatoes tasted so fresh. The burrata was fantastic! So soft and tasted great. 

Buddy's Salumi and Cheese Board ($21) - Prosciutto, spicy capicola, genoa salami, gorgonzola, pecorino, grana padano, pickled veggies, olives and grilled bread arranged beautifully on a cheese board. The meats had such great flavor and the olives (they contain pits) had a nice garlic flavor to them. All the cheeses were good, but the gorgonzola was my favorite. It was creamy and easy to spread on the garlic toast. Delish!

Chicken Parm & Spaghetti ($23) - This is oven baked with provolone and mozzarella. I thought mine from the night before was soggy, so I asked that it be cooked longer this time and it was just perfect. Nice and crispy were is should be and the cheeses tasted good. The spaghetti on the side had marinara on it and parmesan and even though I barely had room, I couldn't let it go to waste! I did take half of my chicken parm home and it reheated nicely. 

Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake ($9) - The cake was warm and baked perfectly. It also came with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream that was excellent. 

Zeppole ($9) - These are served hot and coated in a spiced sugar. 2 dipping sauces accompany them, lemon raspberry jam and chocolate. The raspberry jam I wasn't crazy about, but the chocolate dipping sauce tasted great. 

They also have a kid's menu as well a lunch menu that offers burgers and sandwiches. I am eager to come back and check some of the sandwiches out. I was very pleased with the service, food and atmosphere. The first night, we sat at a table near the bar area next to a large window that overlooks the strip. The next night we sat at a booth that was closer to the kitchen. Both are different experiences so try them both! They also can host events here.

When you combine the quality of ingredients, service and tremendous value, Soho is a place worth coming back to again and again.  Dinner for 4 came out to around $60 before tip and we got to try a nice variety of dishes.

It was easy to see and taste the high grade fish they used right off the bat in the "Seared Tuna Special" which included crispy shallots, sweet onion, micro greens and chili oil combined with super fresh nigiri cuts of maguro.  This was a terrific mix of flavors.  $11!  That's about 50% off the strip price.  I almost wished I didn't have to share it.  

I couldn't turn my back on the $3 (!!) Soho Tostadas and went with the tuna with Hawaiian poke sauce.  The tostada itself was made of taro and there were some delicious chunks of tuna on top mixed with cilantro and avocado cream.  Another great starter for sure.  The rock shrimp done tempura style was also nice portion for $7 and came with 3 unique sauces that I fail to remember the details of since my wife was seriously sweating the end of the Seahawks/Rams Monday night game due to some sports bets she had.  It was nice they had one TV up.

Hydro Bibb Black Cod for $5 was a total freakin tease that ensured I'll get a full order of miso marinated black cod the next time.  Even the smaller portioned cod were cooked really well and the combo of cool lettuce, crispy wontons and fish was kind of like a deluxe protein taco.  

Those all were excellent opening acts for what I was personally here for which was the short rib dish.  Ever since I saw that one picture of all those short ribs being grilled, I knew it was destiny!  It totally delivered.  The one rib was like something out the The Flintstones and tasted as good as it looked.  It was juicy and so tender that you could've just picked at it with chopsticks sans fork and knife.  

The chef and owner of Soho, John Chien Lee, stopped by our table to ask how things were and gave us a breakdown on the business.  We were still open to one more dish so I asked him for a recommendation.  He asked what we liked and we said salmon.  He asked if we wanted something cooked or raw and we said raw.  He said he'd make something special for us off the menu (YES!) and 10 minutes later brought over this delectable dish with 8 pieces of scallop wrapped with salmon topped with a little green, lemon and some other stuff I can't remember.  John whipped up this dish thinking it would be a great finish to the meal after the heaviness of the short rib and MAN was he right.  Then he told us it was on the house!  Thanks, John!!  I suck for not taking photos of anything.  

Las Vegas strip quality for locals!  Check it out.

I just literally got back from there and I have mixed emotions. I would say my experience was bittersweet. Let me explain.

What is it about bacon that makes everything good? The saltiness? The greasy goodness? Maybe its the fact that it is really not good for you that it makes it taste that much better. Well, the fact that this place has a bacon theme is what sold me.

With that said, I came with my wifey to check it out. I ordered The Cure and she ordered the Man Candy. We also got the Garlic Parmesan Fries because I love garlic. Then, we capped it off with dessert by getting the Panookie.

The Cure (13.95). Pork Belly with 2 Fried Eggs and Tomato Jam on a French Baguette. 
This entre was a bit overwhelming. First off, it is very messy, as soon as you pick it up, you have grease and/or egg yolk running down your arms. The pork belly itself was more belly than pork. A lot of fat with some slivers of actual pork. It tasted decent, but a lot of the fat turned me off.

Man Candy (6.95). Glazed Bacon with Cayenne accompanied by Maple Syrup to dip it in. 
Now this masterpiece is a magnificent piece of art that has been placed in a jar for your eyes to feast on. Dip it in the syrup and you will be in bacon heaven. Now this entre alone is worth the trip just to come here. I recommend getting this no matter what you or your party decides on getting. 

Garlic Parmesan Fries (4.95). French Fries sprinkled with grated Parmesan Cheese and Garlic Powder.
Now this I was a bit disappointed. To me, if you are going to serve the best Garlic Parmesan Fries, use real bits of garlic and sliced parmesan/romano cheese. The best I have had is at another restaurant that I will not mention out of respect for these guys. Message me if you are interested in that place.

Panookie (5.00). A niced sized Cookie baked in a aluminum dish topped off with Whipped Cream, Ice Cream and Chocolate Syrup.
It's exactly as described. Ours was a bit burnt on the bottom so it was a bit hard. I think it was a bit overcooked. It probably would of been great it it wasn't burnt.

Service was decent. Our server was on point with order taking, refills, etc. which it should of been because it was just us and another party of 2 she was serving.

Ambience: Since it's called "Bacon Bar", you have to picture a typical bar scene with people hanging out and of course, smoking. Even though we were seated in the "Dining Area", we weren't really sealed off from the smoke coming from the bar. So basically you will be inhaling second hand smoke guaranteed. At the bar you have to be 21. But you can bring your kids to the dining area. Now this to me is a big negative. You and your party will be exposed to secondhand smoke.

So my 3 star rating is a bit generous since my original thought were 2 stars. Like I mentioned earlier, the Man Candy alone warrants a visit here. For you not so bacon lovers, they have other things like Pizza, Wings, Pasta, etc. for your other dining options so bacon doesn't have to be your default choice.  Also, they are open 24 hours which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. Next time I will try the Bacon Burger and I will see if it can be bumped up to 4 stars.

I never have been a huge fan of Johnny Rocket's, so when I found out The Wiener's Circle would be taking the spot JR was in, I was happy. A lot of the signs say it's near the bowling alley when it's actually closer to the doors near the buffet. I have enjoyed my experience at The Wiener's Circle inside Red Rock, but there is something about this location inside Santa Fe that was just better to me. If you are familiar with the original The Wiener's Circle in Chicago, then you know they have a different attitude when it gets dark. Here at this location they don't sling any insults (they play games with customers and sling expected insults at the original location after a certain hour even handing out free food and shirts sometimes) or play any games, but what I have experienced is great customer service. The guy who took my order was very nice and patient while I went over the menu. He also told me about different combo deals that include fried and a drink. I have to give them props as far as the menu prices go. Being in a casino usually means marked up prices and sometimes not the same product you'd expect, but I found the prices to be fair and the food tasted great. I've been back a few times now and will be back plenty more! 

Char Dog - I got the combo priced at $6.99 that came with fries and a drink. The dog had onions, relish, mustard, pickles, tomatoes, peppers and celery salt. I asked that the dog be lightly charred and that's exactly what I got. The cook even came over to our table to make sure I liked it. I had them add cheese to my fries and the cheese sauce is thick and delicious! I could eat a huge pile (they already give you 1/2 pound with your order) of just those fries covered in cheese and my taste buds would be happy. 

Chicken Fingers - As a combo it was $7.99 with fries and a drink. They also give you a choice of mustard, ranch and honey mustard to dip your fingers. I really like the honey mustard here it goes well with the fingers. The fingers didn't look to plump or appetizing when I first saw them, but they really had good flavor and the chicken tasted good enough with out any sauce to dip, but trust me and pair it with the honey mustard. 

Wieners in a Blanket  - These were $4.99 and tasty little bites! They come 6 to an order, but when I got my order I noticed I had 8 of them. Score! You can choose a dipping sauce for these so I obviously chose honey mustard. I don't think these would fill someone alone, but they make a great snack to share along with your meal or nice portion for a kids meal. 

They have booths and tables or you can get your food to-go.

After doing some shopping, hubby and I decided on coming here to Jayde Fuzion for dinner. We didn't leave hungry! We were greeted with a warm welcome and our server was fast as we sat at the table to get our drink order. The service was excellent here. Our drinks never went empty and our server answered all of our questions.

The menu is very simple without having a ton of items on it, but it was still hard to decide was to order since it all looked so good. The prices are also very reasonable. We decided to get different items from the menu and just share it. 

Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($8) - These were pretty good. I personally prefer a crunchier lettuce, but it was good. The menu said this dish was spicy however there wasn't any kick to the dish all. The chicken still had good flavor and it is worth the price. It came with 3 lettuce cups and when I asked our server for more it was no problem.

Cashew Chicken ($15) - My favorite dish of them all! It was a great portion of chicken and put over white rice it was perfect. There were plenty of cashews and this is a dish I would probably order every time. 

Gochujang Pork ($15) - Apples are in this dish, but I didn't taste them. That's OK because whatever flavor it did give the pork, I loved! I will say that this was also supposed to be a spicy dish and there was again no kick at all. It's sort of frustrating when a dish says it will be spicy and it isn't, but it did have great flavor and I would eat it again. As with the other dishes it was a decent portion. 

Honey Walnut Shrimp ($18) - I don't eat seafood. I didn't try these! The menu says it was supposed to have a creamy mayo sauce, but hubby said the shrimp tasted more like a really sweet orange and wouldn't order them again. I thought they were presented well and nicely sized. 

Yuzu Doughnuts ($7) - These are yummy! The doughnuts are very light and not greasy at all. The doughnuts were filled with tasty yuzu glaze and more glaze with pistachios were on top. The refreshing citrus flavor and light texture of the doughnuts made for a nice dessert. 

They didn't open until 5 pm (when we happened to arrive) and people were already waiting to get in. You might want to call ahead and make a reservation. And come hungry! There is also a sushi bar.

Located in Old Town Scottsdale, this gastropub has been one of my favorite restaurants due to their superb ingredients, consistency, originality, and service. The location is easy to miss on the street corner, and strangely I haven't had problems with parking in the amount of times I have been here.

They open in the late afternoon and dim the lights once dinner hours kick in. The interior is underscored by a full bar in the middle surrounded by rows of tables and booths dressed in white tablecloths and small candles. Even though the atmosphere gets loud later in the evenings, the venue is a nice date spot or small gatherings.

For appetizer, their Original Chopped Salad ($12) is a must get. The firm couscous, fresh arugula, corn, aged asiago, and smoked salmon was a delicious combination that gave pop and texture in every bite. I highly recommend it.

Among the entrees, I top two dishes are the Smoked Duck Breast ($28) and Roasted Buttermilk Chicken ($20). The Smoked Duck Breast comes with two thick cuts of duck breast served tender and medium rare. The pieces were very soft to cut into with refined seasonings to go nicely with the sweet potato hash and braised greens. I wished the sweet potato could be a tad sweeter for a change of pace, but the greens were fresh and delicious to couple with the succulent duck. 

Kudos to the chef, I'm not sure how the Buttermilk Chicken came out so tender and full of flavor! It was served with corn-butter bean succotash, roasted Brussels sprouts, truffle oil, and pecorino Romano on top. The thick cut was grilled and impressively moist with a refined buttermilk flavor in the backdrop. It was simplicity mixed with complexity. This is a dish for those who do not like to take risks, but it's also one that will impress both foodies and non-foodies alike. 

The Fair Trade Short Ribs ($30) came with coffee rub, dried cherry BBQ sauce, roasted parsnip puree and seasonal veggies. The ribs lacked a desired smoky flavor, but it was nevertheless complex and cuts at the touch of knife. The ribs were moist, and the tangy and zesty cherry BBQ sauce gave it an added dimension. The parsnip puree round out the flavors to go in-between the meats. 

The Lamb Burger ($13) came with Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion tzatziki, and fries with house-made ketchup. The lamb was tender, super moist, with a detectable seasoning and good lamb flavor. The soft rolls held the burger together nicely, but for a dish this good, the fries could come with a few innovative dipping sauces other than ketchup. 

For dessert, I was not all that impressed with the Choco-Chile Bread Pudding ($10). The chili flavor could be more pointed to add to the scoop of tortilla ice cream and dulce de leche. The quality of the bread pudding was rather stiff, flavorless, and one-dimensional. I wished the bread pudding could have more flavors embedded, so it does not create a distinct separation between dull and rich flavors. Since the bread pudding came highly recommended by the server, I got the sense that dessert is not really their specialty.

Service was very friendly, responsive, attentive, personable and knowledgeable. My meals were always nicely orchestrated, and the servers were extremely knowledgeable about the menu. One time I had a two year old at the dinner table and they were very accommodating with everything he needed. 

However, I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups. I tried to organize a large dinner and the person on the phone was not friendly and required a hefty minimum for drinks. Her requirements were quite unusual since I had organized many other dinner events at other restaurants in the past. Other than that, there's plenty to like about this place. I'd be happy to return to try their Happy Hour menu and other items such as the Grilled Cheese Sandwich and Mac n Cheese.

Thanks to fellow Yelper Kurdy S for finding this place!

Looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant in downtown Las Vegas? Look no further.  La Comida has arrived.  

New restaurants are opening left and right in Las Vegas, especially in the downtown area.  One things for sure, La Comida is a refreshing change from your usual bar food, appetizers, and fried food.  Here at La Comida, you get authentic tasting Mexican dishes.  When you think of Morton's, their steakhouse, N9NE, Ghostbar, and Rain comes to mind.  And because this is a Morton's establishment, expect no less than quality, upscale, and great service. 

My first thought upon arriving here was "Wow".  Although this place was packed on their very first night, we were greeted by almost every staff member.  Smiles are free and we got them.  My second thought, another "Wow".  Las Vegas' who's who was here tonight.  I'm not going to mention names, but the energy was surely in the air tonight.  

There's seating indoors, at the bar, and at the patio outside.  The ambiance includes an attentive staff, wide open restaurant, and a ton of people watching.  Can you imagine this place on the weekend? This restaurant was extremely busy, but there's no rush once you're in and no one seems to be rushing you out.  In other words, this restaurant has a chill feel to it.

As for the food, you really can't go wrong.  Everything made here is authentic. The food was so authentic that I even had a tough time reading the menu.  But our lovely server, Camila, took the time to give us her recommendations and even gave me a short Spanish lesson. My main dish was their Carne de res a la Parrilla (beef skirt steak).  The steak is prepared to your liking on top of a bed of mushrooms and peppers.  The wild mushrooms were so good that I could eat a bowl of this stuff ala carte.  As for the steak itself, I wish I had seconds it was that juicy. Terri R had their Camaron de Golfo (buttered shrimp dish) and for dessert their Platanos Fritos (banana w/ice cream).  It's obvious that Terri loved her dish since she finished the whole thing.  Plus, she told me numerous times "I love my food".  

It's awesome when new restaurants open in Las Vegas, specifically Downtown Las Vegas. Owners Jenna and Michael Morton open it's doors today on an invite only with an expectation to open officially mid-week.  Jenna and Michael didn't miss a beat with their soft opening.  The restaurant was fully staffed, the talent at the bar kept patrons drinks full, and the ambiance matches what us locals expect at DTLV.  Even better, they took the time to meet, greet, and take photos with everyone.  My suggestion...visit or bookmark this place for a fun and happening dining experience.

Originally hubby and I were going to try a different place, but it was too packed so I decided to look up what was nearby on the yelp app. I had Fat Boy bookmarked and it was only a couple of blocks from where we tried to eat first, so we headed to Fat Boy.

Walking inside there wasn't much space and there were plenty of customers. There are maybe 4 or 5 tables and we were lucky enough after ordering to snatch one up. The food is made to order and since it was busy we had to wait our turn for our food to come out, but I was patient since it smelled of yummy pizza throughout the place and the vibe inside was awesome.

I asked the man who took our order if the bacon was made fresh since this would alter if I would order it or not. He said that indeed was! I ordered a "BLT Sandwich" priced at just $3.24 for the sandwich by itself, or $6.23 to make it a combo with fries and a drink. I made mine a combo and substituted regular fries for "Chencho Fries" which was a very smart decision. The BLT came out on a burger bun with fresh shredded lettuce, tomato and mayo. I was surprised at the amount of bacon on the sandwich for the price. I was pleased with the flavor of the BLT and would happily order it again with a little extra mayo. You can order the Chencho Fries with skinny or fat fries. The cashier suggested the skinny fries so I went with that and hubby had the fat fries with his. The Chencho Fries have a little bit of chicken with green sauce and cheese. Yum! I loved these fries! Get over here and try these fries! Hubby had a "Pastrami Boyger" and couldn't stop talking about how good the pastrami was so we came back a couple days later for dinner again!

This time hubby went with a full on "Pastrami Sandwich" and loved it. I knew after smelling the pizza a couple days before that I had to give it a try. They have a pick-up only special where you can get a 14" one topping pizza for $5.49 so I was all over that! I ordered a cheese pizza and a side of ranch to dip it in. The owner (turns out this was who took our order the first time) came over to our table and talked to me about the pizza and how he makes the dough from scratch everyday. The pizza was cheesy and the sauce and crust tasted great. I just can't believe how good it tastes for such a great price. I don't live near Fat Boy, but it's worth the drive and I will absolutely be back! 

They offer a good variety of menu options from pizza, boygers, wings, fingers, salads, sandwiches, milkshakes, bottled drinks and fountain drinks. They also offer boyrritos, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas and even serve breakfast! They have different specials and family deals too.

Since we were in Phoenix for an entire week, we asked around for lots of restaurant recommendations.  Pizzeria Bianco was mentioned quite often.  Some said it was the best pizza in Phoenix, while others said they were known nationally for their pizza.  Since we were only a few blocks away, we headed over on a Saturday night to check it out. 

The first thing you notice when you get there is how small the location is.  It's an old house that's been converted into a restaurant.  There are approximately 12 tables, along with bar seating for an additional 10 people or so.  Since it was a Saturday night, the wait time was 30-45 minutes.  

You have the option of waiting outside at the picnic tables next to the restaurant, but seeing how Phoenix is in the middle of a desert that's not a great option during the summer.  What is a great option is walking next-door to Bar Bianco.  It's also an old house that's been converted, but this time into a bar and lounge area.  It makes for the perfect spot to have an adult beverage and relax while you wait for your table.  And the system they have in place is stress-free.  When your table is ready, the hostess calls over to the bartender to let them know.  Easy as can be.

We ended up sitting at the bar, which worked out great because the bartender shared lots of information about the restaurant with us.  Bianco is known for their artisanal pizza, in the certified Neapolitan style.  We ordered three pizzas as well as an appetizer, so we could try a little bit of everything.

First up was the appetizer of Spiedini, which consisted of Fontina cheese wrapped in prosciutto, served warm over a bed of greens (spinach, I believe).  Warmed Italian meat and cheese? Yes, please!  Next up were the pizzas; Margherita, Sonny Boy, and Wiseguy.  All of the pizzas are cooked in the wood-fired oven, giving the thin crust a delicious crispness.  The Margherita was delicious in its simplicity of tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil.  The Wiseguy had sausage and the most amazing caramelized onions I've ever tasted, thick sliced and full of seasoning.  These are the kind of onions you would expect to be served as a side dish at a high-end steakhouse.  But my favorite pizza of the night was the Sonny Boy.  I loved the sodium-laden combination of salami and kalamata olives.  It may be too salty for some, but I thought it was perfect.

Although the Sonny Boy was my favorite, the other two weren't far behind.  It's a very simplistic menu, with only a few preset options of pizza.  But everything we tried was awesome, and the reputation for being the best pizza in Phoenix appears to be well earned.

OFFENSIVE. Tonight I had the most offensive and unprofessional experience at Yasu; I will never ever go back and I would only recommend it to someone I hate.

A group of four of us arrived at Yasu for our 6:30PM reservation and were seated promptly. We chatted for a while as water and other beverages were brought out and we went ahead and ordered the chef's choice menu so we could see the best of the best that Yasu had to offer. I've had great experiences with chef's choice at Yen, Pure, and a number of places in Boston so I expected the same from Yasu.

We entertain ourselves for a while until the first course arrives. 8 kumamoto oysters with uni and roe. Great play of textures and flavors. Kudos. Plates are removed and now we are getting excited, sashimi must be coming next and we are ready for it! The special fish selections of the day looked fantastic.

About 20 minutes goes by and we get our second course, red snapper carpaccio. it is seared and served at room temperature. One of my pieces had i don't know, tendon or something that made it unyielding to my chopsticks, and frankly, the temp of this dish was iffy. Flavors decent, but this is not the mass quantity of sashimi or nigiri I was anticipating.

The restaurant starts filling up. I see a massive plate of rolls come out of the kitchen and I nearly squeal with glee...until I watch it come to rest at another table.  This starts happening at a regular pace, and then I realize it's been a full 30 minutes since we've had anything at our table. A server comes by so I ask when the next dish will arrive. She mumbles something about the chef's choice taking a little longer than other orders and walks away.

Another cooked plate. A gross mushroom custard, a single shrimp on a skewer, an 1/8th of a cup of japanese eggplant in red miso sauce, a shard of spanish mackerel with some sort of puree, and two bits of jumbo clam. Everything tastes fine, but we are OVER the cooked plate situation.

Yet ANOTHER 30 minutes goes by. No server, nor manager comes to apologize for the delay. We watch literally dozens of delicious looking rolls, nigiri and sashimi fly out of the kitchen to other tables. We also watch 4 other couples come in after us, eat loads of food, and leave before us. We are still hungry.

Next course...Clams in miso broth. We are not offered spoons for the broth. We look at each other, thinking, "we ARE at a sushi restaurant, are we not?" but go ahead and eat the clams.  When the server comes by and asks how it is we tell her that we hope the next course will begin the actual SUSHI part of this dinner. She says yes, we are having live scallops.

About 25 more minutes pass and I'm starting to vibrate with righteous indignation. We are clearly paying a fucking fortune for this meal and we are receiving terrible treatment. The "live scallops" are boiling in miso broth over a mini-charcoal grill. They are so over-cooked they are RUBBERY. We hurry to get them off the coals and into our mouths before they are completely ruined.

Finally we tell the server that we are going to have to INSIST on getting some raw fish on the table. She says that's what's coming next. "Next" meaning ANOTHER 30 minutes later. We wait so long that finally we tell the server we are NOT going to continue with this absurdity and that we want the check. "oh your next course is ready!" "we don't want it. We want to leave" These are the exact words out of our mouths. Instead of bringing the check she brings the plates, telling us that Chef Yasu "wants us to have them." We all resist and the plates are set down anyway and finally our hunger makes us cave and we eat. We have now been at Yasu for TWO AND A HALF HOURS. We've had five courses that were not enough for two people, much less four.

Another 15 minutes pass before the check arrives. In that time, the manager has come out, not to rectify the situation, or apologize, but to call us ignorant and classless. He literally looks at us and accuses, "Have you ever had omakase before? It is always slower." We look at him and tell him in all of our sushi eating years we have never had an experience akin to this. We also point out that we were expecting SUSHI, as in RAW FISH. He tells us we told the server we would eat 'anything'. I asked him if the name of his restaurant was Yen SUSHI Bistro and he looks at me, puzzled. Then I see that we have been charged $20 for the last course that we TWICE tried to send back. I speak to the manager who tells me "if Yasu wants to charge you for it, he will charge you for it." I kid you not. All in all each course was mercilessly over-worked, only average and Yasu is on a major ego trip. Don't waste your time and money here.

Fine Dining while watching the open kitchen here was one of my favorite dining experiences in Vegas. We had made reservations for the L'Unique menu which was designed for people who wanted a complete meal but had limited dining time (such as before a show). For $59.00, we got to enjoy a fantastic meal of an app, entree and dessert- all served within about 15 minutes. 
Started with a bread basket that i'm sure would make Anthony N's bread basket notes. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=wcB4tCCHDP-MVZgumBWRIw It was served with 3 kinds: baguettes, country rolls and croissant rolls. The croissant was my favorite. They give u generous pads of butter and will give u extra bread- so eat up! You will be hard pressed to find better bread baskets. 
For the L'unique menu, we got to choose from two different items for each part of the meal. Between the bf and i, we got to try all of them. 
My dish: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=WtpRh5soYH-ievHYOznn7g
Everything was beautiful and tasted amazing. They gave a pretty good amount of lobster with the sole and the sauces and vegetables were perfect. The salmon and tuna tartare was yum and tasted very fresh. The dessert was light and delicious and so very pretty :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=_t-FoXFZtmghxSyON9UZzg
Dude had the flank steak (cooked perfectly) with buttery mash potatoes, asparagus and the lemony berry dessert. Dude dislikes veggies, but he loved every bite of his meal.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=IDFSuLaOxP67CEmLH10DuA
The best part of this experience is watching the chefs making these beautiful dishes. Every chef had their special tasks in making each dish complete to perfection. We even saw a chef using tweezers to carefully place pieces together of a salad. Although the chefs and servers move swiftly to try to complete your meal in the promised 15 minutes, you never feel rushed or see anything done hastily. Our waiter checked on us just enough times to make sure everything was great and took the time to make conversation as well and answer any questions we had. 

Dude is a notoriously slow eater, and i had surprise tickets for him to see the Jabbawockeez after dinner. While he was busy taking photos of the decor and watching the chefs- i was afraid we were never gonna get to the show in time at the rate he was going, not even having touched his bread yet. But as dinner was served- to see his reaction to finally finding a vegas hotel restaurant that he truly enjoyed (he always complains they r never great)- from him watching the chefs, to enjoying every morsel on his plate, was well worth the price and nervousness!!!

*if you want the Ultimate Robuchon experience, go to his restaurant next door.  (inside the MGM)

After reading so many reviews on the positive and negative about the place I just didn't know what to expect.  My opinion after chowing down there is that there's a lot to love about the place and a lot to be... What's the right word?  Annoyed at...

Maybe we'll discuss the positive first, the food!  Let me first explain that I hardly EVER order chicken at a restaurant.  Usually it's never cooked right.  Sure I order wings here and there, but never as a main dish.  It's usually too dry.  I hardly even eat chicken at home, I can't cook it right either!  So going to a BBQ place while dieting creates a lot of challenges.  One is that the BBQ chicken (non-fried) was the best option.  So I was nervous, real nervous.  But let me tell you... It. Was. Awesome!  So tender and juicy and flavorful.  Best chicken I've ordered in a restaurant EVER!  I was in cluck cluck heaven!  

We went hog wild (funny, right?) and ordered every single one.  When in Rome, right?  So let's go down the list.  

Cornbread: Okay, but a little too grainy for my taste (and $3 for one slice!!)
Potato Salad: Okay.  I like Potato Salad with crisp not mushy potatoes, and they were but the taste just wasn't there for me.
Mac n' cheese: Good.  It was incredibly creamy and tasty, but not the best I've ever had (Kelly's, Six Penn Kitchen, etc.).
Coleslaw: Okay. Vinegar based, which I usually dig, but again, just wasn't the best I've ever had
Baked Beans: Delicious!  I loved the taste!  Bacon, perhaps a little sweet Maple Syrup or Cinnamon?  Whatever, it tasted awesome!
Greens: The winner!  It was vinegar based as well and bursting with flavor.  Toss in some more bacon and bam, best of the night!

The food presentation is pretty cool too.  They just bring out everything on a big metal try and every side comes in a different looking pan it's probably cooked in.  I loved the BBQ too because again, the magic ingrediant, it had a ton of vinegar flavor!  Good thing they had extra sauce on the table because I doused my chicken in it.  

The bad.  It's WAY overpriced.  The food is simple but good.  The meats are $12-$22 for half and full racks and the sides are $1-5 on their own.  Why the high price?  Do you want to be upscale BBQ?  Does that even make sense?  Upscale I imagine has a totally different environment to go with it.  The sad thing is, it's pretty good so I bet they won't lower prices.  

The decor is minimal and simplistic.  Red gingham walls and long picnic table seating.  I wouldn't mind the picnic tables if they were a little skinnier.  It's true what everyone's saying, it's hard to hear the person across from you.  Also, if it's busy and there's a wait, people at the front are standing there with no tables to put drinks on while they wait and pretty much starring down the people sitting at the tables right in front of them.  It's just awkward and I feel like they need some high tops up front or some bench seating.    

If they lowered prices, I'd probably throw on another star and be back more often.  Because of that very reason, I probably won't visit often, even though I did enjoy it.  Time will tell....

I had eaten at the Earl of Sandwich on the strip a few times and liked it, but never new we had another location at the Palms. That was until I got a coupon booklet in the mail for a variety of places at the Palms, Earl of Sandwich being one of them. I signed up for the Earl of Sandwich e-club after the first time I ate at the strip location and for my birthday this year they sent a coupon good for 1 free sandwich and 1 free drink, no purchase required. Score! Since I had the coupon from the booklet at the palms with a BOGO and the birthday coupon this seemed like the perfect time to try the location at the Palms and eat for almost free. :)

This Earl of Sandwich is located in the food court of the Palms Hotel & Casino, between Chronic Tacos and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. It is open 24/7. The one thing I noticed different about this location from the other one on the strip is they have no inside seating. You have to find a table (not many) in the middle of the food court. Also, the "order here" and "pick up here" lines are very close together. While placing my order I had to move out of the way and stop placing my order twice so that other customers could get their food. They need to really make some adjustments as far as where people should place an order and pick one up. 

The girl at the register who took my order was very friendly and polite. She had trouble getting one of the coupon codes to scan and after she asked the manager for help several times,  was finally able to get it on her own. I felt bad that the manager was ignoring her and talking on her cel phone instead. They had a promotion going on called "Dine with the Royal Couple" that offered 2 sandwiches not regularly on the menu. The 2 sandwiches were the "Avocado BLT" and "Pastrami Reuben" both priced at $6.99, but I used the BOGO and ordered 1 of each. I left off the kraut and thousand island dressing and just requested mustard be put on it. I usually would love having the sandwich the way it came, but hubby doesn't like the other stuff so we just customized it a bit since we were sharing each sandwich. The Pastrami Reuben was very good, but skimpy on the meat. Hubby would have to eat 2 of these to get full. The Avocado BLT was also very good except some bacon pieces were too fatty while the other pieces has great meaty flavor. The bacon was cooked fresh so kudos for that. All the sandwiches are made fresh to order here. They were generous with the fresh avocado too. So for the free sandwich from the birthday coupon I ordered a "Full Montagu" priced at $6.49, but of course the awesome coupon took care of that! The Full Montagu has roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, tomato and mustard sauce. I had them leave off the lettuce. So with everything I said was in the Full Montagu you would expect something pretty big right? Nope! This sandwich was very good, but again just too skimpy on what they put between the bread. With the coupons we did get full though! I do like that the sandwiches are generally under $6.49 so even if hubby needs to order 2 to get full, it really isn't any more in price then ordering a burger and fries at a average restaurant. 

Earl of Sandwich also offers a variety of salads, wraps and artisan soups (soup selection changes daily). They also have sides like coleslaw, potato salad, pasta salad and chips. Breakfast is served daily until 11 am and they use fresh cracked eggs! There is a kids menu and when it comes to dessert Earl of Sandwich has a lot of tasty looking sweets, including brownies made with Ghirardelli chocolate.

We've been eating at LOS for years and have been there so many times that luckily we've managed to order most of the menu. However we have 2 different ways we order when visiting LOS. The first way is just me and my hubs on a casual weeknight, we tend to order the few dishes that we haven't tried yet . The other is a weekend night with several guests along for a Thai feast. So this review will focus on the later, a sort of best of LOS if you will.

On a side note you do not come here to order Pad Thai and the other super popular Thai dishes. LOS is famous for Northern style and Chef Chutima specialties, stick to those and you will not be disappointed. Also, LOS has 4 condiments but be sure to ask for all 4.. chili paste, chili powder, pickled jalapeo will be brought out in a caddy but the 4th is separate.. its thai chili in fish sauce and lime juice, you'll have to ask for this one. When they bring it lift the lid of carefully and inhale the fragrance. This to me is the LOS perfume and let me tell you this condiment is scorchingly hot. Its burns both ways but it tastes truly amazing! 

Apps..

#12 Stuffed Chicken Wings.. while these can be found elsewhere, the preparation here is a deep fried crunchy version that's amazing with pickled jalapeo and sticky rice. 

#13 A. Nua Dad Deaw which is Issan style beef jerky. Seriously, it's jerky so think deeply flavored slices of chewy meat. Its fun to eat especially with sticky rice and some of the accompanied sauce. 

#14 Nam Kao Tod.. this is like the premier LOS appetizer, if you can order only one app, make it this one. We call this one simply crispy rice with sour sausage. However its the little pieces of sausage arent sour but have a porky lime flavor thats addictive paired with fresh ginger, green onions, chili, peanuts and of course this is all nestled into a pile of light crispy rice. Served with cucumber chips this tastes great using the chili fish sauce condiment. BTW, if you prefer the sausage whole order #66.

Salads..

#45 Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad.. little deep friend pieces of cat fish with slices of apple and peanuts then dressed with lime juice.. Its bright, crispy and one of my favorites here. 

#59 Koi Soy.. okay so technically this isn't a salad but the coolness of this dish sits perfectly in the salad space for me. So what is it you ask? It's Issan style beef tartare. Yep raw beef and its a gorgeous dish with minced beef dressed with chili, rice powder and lime. We've ordered this at a spice level 4 and let me say that our faces felt like they were going to burn off. Order at a 1 spice level and add your own heat via condiments. Trust me on this.

Entrees..

A. Khao Soi.. typical street food noodle dish but the version here is crazy good. We always order beef with this but if you're feeling like a high roller get the beef short rib version (you'll pay more but its marginally more tender). Its simple, toothsome egg noodles afloat in a curried coconut bream broth garnished with red onion, lime and pickled cabbage. Its rich, thick and a must order. 

K. Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry).. this is one of those dishes that has a far reaching flavor profile. To me this curry could easily be on a table in India.. its dark deep pork richness is fork tender and perfect over steamed rice. However many prefer to eat this one with sticky rice. 

Drunken Noodles.. we order this a couple of different ways depending on what the table wants.. most popular way is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Sea Bass with extra noodle. The sea bass is lightly dusted and deep fried until its light and crispy. Inside the meat is light, flakey and a great contrast to the rich smokey noodles. The other preparation for us is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Duck. Same as above but with slices of deep fried duck breast (no bones in either). The duck is rich, slightly fatty and bursting with flavor. For me the duck is my favorite preparation but I also like heavier meat flavors. 

Garlic Prawns.. so for the longest time we never ordered this dish as we thought it was just a Chinese style dish, boy were we wrong. This is where Chef Chutima works her Thai culinary magic. She takes large shell on shrimp and cooks them in such a way that the meat is tender and juicy while the shell is as light and crispy as a potato chip. Yes, you eat the shell, legs and all. This is truly a magical dish for us. 

Dessert.. 

We're usually so full right about now that desserts of sticky rice and mango seems just to heavy for us. Though look up my review for Luv-It Frozen Custard for a tongue cooling treat (its close to LOS).

At some point in the future I will write a companion review to this review for those who want to explore other dishes but have been overwhelmed with the scale of the menu. Oh and in case you're wondering the amount of dishes we ordered above are good for about 4-6 people. Though we're really big eaters so a party of 4 is more like it for us. 

Bon appetite!

Wow. Just wow. I am amazed at how much Morton's has changed. I hadn't eaten at Morton's for years, so seeing it was apart of Restaurant Week 2013 it seemed like a good time to go back. Too bad we couldn't go back in time to when I remember Morton's being an excellent place to eat!. 

I made the reservation a few days before, but after arriving I don't think that reservation would have mattered because they were not busy at all and the bar was dead. They did have a menu board after you walk inside promoting Restaurant Week and the RW menu they were offering. After being seated in a comfy booth, a gentleman came over to take our drink order and inform us that he was glad we were seated away from the construction dust. Say what?!?! He said they were doing some remodeling and we got lucky seats. Gee thanks... Not! I wasn't prepared to start off the evening hearing about that and feel he should have kept it to himself. Some things you just don't relay back to the customers.

Our server, Jessie, was attentive checking on us often and never letting our drinks get half empty. Jessie went over the RW menu with us and answered any questions we had. A large "Onion Loaf" was brought to the table with some whipped butter. This is a big loaf! I thought it was good, but seriously it tasted like the onion bun on the beef n cheddar at Arby's. For the RW menu the price was $50.13 per person. For the first course I chose the "Chopped Salad" and I have to say this was the one thing I really enjoyed. The chunks of blue cheese were amazing! I loved having such good sized chunks of blue cheese throughout the salad. The extra fresh cracked pepper I requested was nice too. For the 2nd course, I chose the 8oz filet well-done. Yep, I ordered a steak well-done! Get over it, it's MY steak! The filet is a thicker cut of meat, so when cooked properly it can still melt in your mouth even well-done! This was the first time in my entire life that I have ordered a well-done filet that didn't need to be butterflied. The steak lacked flavor and certainly didn't melt in my mouth. Even the crispy parts lacked flavor! I don't know if Morton's is being cheap with the RW menu, or if they really have gone downhill, but this steak isn't anything close to what I have had here in the past. 

You can clearly see by the RW pictures posted and other pictures posted that Morton's slims down the portion size on some dishes when you order from RW menu. Tsk Tsk! The sides hubby and I chose (came with the 2nd course) were the "Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes" and "Lyonnaise Potatoes" since we weren't fond of the other options. The mashed potatoes were creamy yet had soft chunks of potato in it too. I thought the mashed potatoes were actually decent. The lyonnaise potatoes on the other hand were terrible. The pictures of previous yelpers lyonnaise potatoes looks different from what we got. First off the onions were chewy and nasty. Eating the onions was like chewing on grass. Gross! The potatoes were straight up french fries! This dish was a fail.

So it came time for dessert and I knew I wanted the "Key Lime Pie" I just didn't know it would also be a fail. Key lime pie is one of my favorites (had the worst before this occasion in Florida believe it or not!) and I didn't think Morton's would be the worst ever key lime pie I have eaten. As it was placed in front of me, I could smell some fresh lime and grew excited. Pffft the only thing "lime" about this pie was the few lime zests they scattered on top. That was the smell, just some lime zest. This pie had no tartness at all! It was just bland and like eating nothing. I did not finish it since it bored and disappointed me. 

I started eating at The Mint, or today known as top of Binions, Hugo's Cellar, etc. at a very young age. My parents taught us how to have manners and how privileged it was for someone of our age to be eating in a place like that. To this day we still eat at those places and have the same exact manners. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way rules changed because there were 2 others tables seated near us about half way through our meal. At one table there was a guy wearing light colored jeans and a baseball cap. At the other there was a boy, maybe 6 or 7, making loud sounds, running around the table in circles waving his arms in the air, and the father laughing and encouraging it. I remember when if your jeans weren't dark enough you weren't allowed to dine. A baseball cap is just disrespectful, and the kid running around with no control isn't just the parents fault, but Morton's too. Like I mentioned earlier, the place wasn't very busy and this kid and his noises were obvious enough that someone at Morton's should have said something. They would have when I was younger so what has changed now? I am not paying a good chunk of change to have that going on around me. Because of yelps character limit, Morton's should be glad I can't comment any further! :)

I noticed ZiKiZ while in the area a couple months ago and decided to bookmark it based on the positive reviews and the food sounded good. I met yelper Tracy P here for lunch and walking in we were greeted right away. The 2 men behind the counter were very friendly and told us about their menu. They said they specialized in customizing any order with what's offered on the menu. You pick if you want a wrap, salad or bowl (prices vary) and then pick what you want inside. They have chicken, steak, crab and falafel and a variety of veggies. 

Priced at $7.99 I ordered a "Chicken Wrap" with salad mix, red onion, black olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, ZiKiZ sauce and feta cheese (.50 cents extra for feta) inside a sundried tomato tortilla. I said that I would be eating the wrap inside, but would like the chicken on the side to-go. The guy looked at me kind of funny and said I needed to pick a protein to go into my meal. I looked funny back at him because he just told me a minute prior that they specialized in customizing any order, so what was the big deal with just putting the chicken on the side? I like the Greek Salad Wrap over at The Great Greek on Warm Springs and was hoping to create a wrap somewhat like that. I just said the chicken inside the wrap would be fine. My friend, Tracy had a coupon for $5 off any order over $20 which was a nice bonus. The guy accepted the coupon with no problem, but he majorly messed up when it came to ringing up our order. We wanted to add 2 sides and 2 drinks for an additional $2.99 each. He never asked us what sides we wanted and when we were looking over the menu deciding which ones we wanted, he says "oh I thought you'd want fries" and I was wondering why he was picking for us. I said no, we never asked for fries and don't want those, but we'd like to try the ZiKiZ rice. He then brought only 1 side of rice over and not the 2nd. Then he starts to talk to the next customer and we haven't even received our drink cups. I ask for them and he only hands 1 cup over. What the heck? We mentioned that we needed the other drink (deciding to just give up on the 2nd side we never received) and he just smiles and hands a cup over. I wasn't given a receipt, so I don't know how he charged me. I am thinking he didn't ring up the 2nd drink and side or something, but with the coupon our total was only $15 and some change, so not a bad price to try a new place out.   He did give the coupon back and said to save it to use again.

The rice was very bland. I really tasted no flavor and decided since it was in a container already to just take it home and give it to my dog with her dinner. The wrap was just average. I did like the taste of the tortilla, but the chicken really had no flavor and the veggies stood out more as far as flavor goes. With them not customizing my order the way I wanted, the food only tasting average, the mix up with sides and drinks and the food not being that great, I can't see coming back.

SHUT IT DOWN!

I was incredibly disappointed when we went to grab dinner here last night. Chef Ramsey would have been so upset at the lack of customer respect. It was like they really didn't care. And I found this unacceptable. 

The hostess took us to our table which was a very cool table but it was not very comfortable for our group to have dinner at. It was so low, that there was no way we could even eat or cut our meat. If we were just drinking then we would have hung out here all night. I asked the hostess for a booth, which was right next to the original table. 

She told me that the 4 empty booths were reserved and we couldn't sit there. I asked the hostess how embarrassed would she be if we sat at the uncomfortable table and no one showed up for those 4 booths in the next hour.  She ignored me and didn't respond. 

She then told me that this was the only table we could have. The sad part is that 60% of the tables were empty and she refused to seat us anywhere else.  I told her I wanted to speak to the manager. She went back to the hostesses station told the other girl and the second hostess rolled her eyes. Honestly I'm the customer.  I don't need to see that. The hostess made a phone call to the manager, who never picked up his phone.  She then went in the back and when she came back she gave us one of the booths we had requested. Wow! What changed?

First, why did it take me 10 minutes to get a booth in a restaurant that was only 40% full. Secondly, I asked to speak to the manager and the manager never came out. Why? Completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Really where is the manager and why didn't he come over to talk to us. 

On a side note: At 10:22pm, we were seated and at 12:19am the booths were still empty.  In fact, nobody ever sat in any of those booths for almost 2 hours. It became apparent that the hostess completely lied to us by telling us they were reserved. Who is training the staff to act like this?

Plus we sat at our table with no service for about 10 minutes. I believe the hostesses probably thought it was funny to send no one over.  We all discussed leaving but decided to stay. 

At 11:52pm all of the lights went full blast, during our meal. It was so bright it hurt our eyes. I spoke to the guy cleaning the tables and he went to speak to the manager and the lights went back down after 5 minutes.  We were just trying to finish our dinner. He came back and said, "the manager had no idea who turned all the lights on!" I think the manager might need a visit from GR and he may have his lights turned on. The waitress told us the lights go full blast every night at that time. I think it must be on a timer, like last call for alcohol. But it should not blast all the lights in the dinning areas. It was not a fun feeling as we ate our dinners. 

My first drink didn't look like the picture in the iPad menu. And I was told by the waitress that the drinks never look like the photos in the iPad. Then why do we have photos of the drinks in the iPad? Again this is wrong and not right. GR would be screaming at someone. 

I went to order another drink at 12:00am but was informed that the bar was closed. I said really and why didn't someone tell us it was last call. There was no response. I told the waitress that I was just having a wheat beer and it shouldn't be a problem to pour a pint. All the bartenders were still there. She went to ask and came back with my pint but I noticed that the Orange slice was missing and about an inch of beer was also missing.  I asked where was the orange slice (this beer is suppose to come with it) and I was told that it was wrapped in Saran Wrap and put away. I asked her to grab me a slice and she said that it wouldn't be possible. Why is this dinner so painful?

I'm so mad that I haven't even got to reviewing the food yet.  The best thing we had here was the fingerling potatoes. It was a side dish but it was the star of the show. My buddy was not happy with his lamb. It was covered in a cheese and he felt it was over powering. I liked my PEI mussels and clams but didn't love them. They came with chorizo, carmelized fennel and lemon zest. I've had better mussel dishes elsewhere. I will say that the shellfish was fresh and only two clams had some sand in them. 

Would I come back here again? Probably never! So you're saying there's a chance? I would only probably ever eat here if Chef Ramsey was actually here running it. This place needs to be on one of those Restaurant Rescue Food shows and its only been open 4 months. I was also informed by the staff that GR had only been there 5 times in the last 4 months, since this location opened. If that is true then, he really needs to spend some time here fixing the many issues. I think the loser of Hell's Kitchen might be running this place?

I let my love of GR influence my choice to stay! Next time I will follow my brain and not my heart. We should have all walked.

We have really enjoyed other Ramsay restaurants. The wait for BurGR is just ridiculous! We were told it would be a 2 hour wait and they would let us know by text (they text your phone) when the table was ready. I'm not much of a burger eater and rarely order them anywhere, but with Ramsay having his name on the restaurant must mean it's going to be worth the 2 hour wait right? Wong! When I first heard how long the wait would be, I wasn't even upset. I had been wanting to try BurGR and with a wait time like that I got more excited to try one of these well loved burgers. One thing is they have strict rules here at BurGR. When we got the text alert that our table was ready, some of us needed to use the restroom on our way back to the restaurant. Now we were on the property, never left. The hostess still refused to seat anybody until everybody was there and accounted for. Really? it seemed like we were on a field trip and the bus driver was counting heads to make sure everyone was on the bus.

Once we got seated it took 10 minutes for our server to acknowledge us and he took our appetizer order, but not our food order. He literally took off after we said what app we wanted. Around 15 minutes later our "Roasted Jalapeno Poppers" priced at $12 showed up at the table. They looked so good!!! Too bad they didn't live up to what I saw. The insides were still cold. It was only hot on the outside and the poppers were a real disappointment to our whole table. The cheddar ranch that comes with it just tasted like regular ranch. The poppers come in shot glasses with the ranch and we still had one left on the table that nobody really wanted. 20 minutes later our server came back to take our dinner order. Phew it was some wait time from beginning to finish at this place! Hubby and I decided to split a burger and a hot dog and the fries and rings are a generous portion so we just got 1 order of each for the table to share. 

"Just Fries" ($8) - They are hand-cut and come with a side each of curry ketchup and chipotle ketchup. I really feel for the price you get a lot of fries and even if sharing, you will still have plenty. The problem is the fries came out ice cold. I picked one up to taste and spit it back out. Nobody at our table wanted to eat the fries. 

"Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings" ($9) - Parmesan cheese on the rings with  chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip on the side. Again, the portion and price are very fair, but the rings were straight up ice cold and the ranch is ranch, nothing cheddar about it. 

"American Burger" ($13) - The burger had american cheese, onions, tomatoes, pickles and butter lettuce. When our food arrived to the table, 40 minutes after placing the order, I'm pretty sure my mouth started to drool as the burger was put down in front of me. It looked very good. I will say they after cutting the burger in half, I noticed that it was cooked just as I requested which is actually hard to come by here in Vegas. Too bad the actual burger had zero flavor. The burgers are grilled over apple and cider wood is what they brag about here yet the burger seriously had no flavor and like the other food it wasn't even warm. There was way too much bun going on with this burger and every time I took a bite the bread fell apart as the rest of the burger. It was just not good at all. There wasn't anything I ate during this experience that was enjoyable. 

"Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg" ($13) - Too much dog, not enough bun. Did taste decent, but they need a bigger bun for it. Better than the burger! Hmmm.

I let our server know that the food was cold and the fries and rings were so ice cold that  t hey must have been sitting for a while. Our server responded with "Sorry, I was busy doing stuff and then I had to go to the bathroom" to which I replied "did you at least wash your hands after touching your junk and brought our food" and he just said "I'll take the fries off" and then he was gone. The whole meal should have been free since it was mostly still on the table because we didn't want to eat it. I said very clearly and loudly that I had a total rewards card to get the discount on our bill and he just shrugged it off and charged the card with the regular prices anyway. If you have a total rewards card then you save so much off each menu item. So you can see where this can actually add up every time a menu item is added to the tab. I said something to him and he said that he would correct it, but it would take a long time and the card would have to be charged twice to fix it. We just said to forget it and I told him it would come from his tip. My friend ordered a burger and paid extra to have an egg added and was specific about it having a runny yolk. Our server said that wouldn't be a problem, but when our food came the egg on her burger was cooked way too long meaning no runny yolk. Such a major disappointment Gordon Ramsay BurGR turned out to be.
