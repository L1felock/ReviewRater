I was in an accident a few years ago and was told to see a chiropractor, which I was really hesitant to do. 

I was recommended to Health Coach and boy was it the best move I made. Their philosophy is to take a holistic approach to getting you healthy as quickly as possible. 

The staff is great and I felt comfortable putting my health in their hands.

I was in an accident a few months back and USAA referred me to Gerber Collision, they had my car in and out, and painted perfectly. They replaced the rear bumper and passenger fender. The job was great and they patched my tire up for free! They were very nice and professional. They even gave me a ride to Enterprise Car Rental just as an added bonus. I will go to Gerber every time I need body work done. Hands down.

Secret pizza is the shit. Sober or drunk, it's worth the wait and the ridiculous conversations and interactions from all the sloppy mcsloppersons standing in line for a slice makes it quite entertaining as well. I liked the pepperoni, but I loved the white pizza with ricotta, mushrooms (?) and pepperoni! Just get a whole pizza for your group instead of ordering individual slices, because they're like the Pringles of the pizza world, once you pop you can't stop.

Neiman Marcus meet Salvation Army. Salvation Army meet Neiman Marcus. Nice. 

Wow. A vintage/thrift store that doesn't smell like my Aunt Helen's wig closet. No stench of mothballs, decaying bodies or stale smoke from an old pack of Capri Ultra Light Menthol 120s. 

Organized. Well staffed. Well, staffed by people who are actually engaging and interested in you. Unlike SO many other similar shops in this area where you get a little bit of "OH, you are so lucky to peruse my crap" attitude. 

Most importantly...great stuff. Vintage Italian dishware (think Fiesta with a Tuscan twist), Disney movie stills, framed, and selling for a mere Abraham and an entire case of well lit (much like myself at the time of shopping) Prada, Jimmy Choo and Minola Blanaks!! Just my luck! None in my size.

I ordered a couple of carne asada tacos and a large soda for $7.77. They have that soda dispenser that can deliver just about any soda known to man. They were out of the Diet Dr. Pepper so I was saying no bueno until I saw that they had Diet Barq's Rootbeer. Nice save!

The two carne asada tacos I had were basically two of the smallest tacos that I have ever seen. The taste was so so. They have a great outdoor patio and plenty of room in the dining area.

But I don't see myself coming back to America's Taco Shop.

I love going here for lunch!  I have been there several times because it is close to work and I have to get out of the office!  I love the soups here. Just had the vegetable and the ingredients were so fresh.  The salads are also very good.  I have tried the blueberry wrap and that is one of my favorites.  I have heard from the owner that she will even be delivering to office buildings in the area.  This is the best place to go if you like everything fresh.  Perfect vegetarian spot!

I like Duck, roasted and with some plum sauce on the side. I'm not so excited about Duck & Decanter. It's just okay for me, 2 1/2 stars if I had that option since I'm only interested in lunch and not their wine or any of the fancy foodstuffs that they carry. The best attribute about this place is the outdoor seating while being surrounded by some large trees.

For starters, there's a funky smell going on when you first walk into the place. I think the sandwiches are weak. You can look at a picture of my Reuben Sandwich with the toasted burnt bread and judge for yourself. To me, it looks like a number eight hitter's batting average, weak. I've had a decent salad in the past as well. 

This place has definitely not made the cut on to my regular lunch rotation.

4pm check out time, at no additional cost. In Vegas? Yes, it does exist, and it exists at Trump. It's an excellent buffer after going all night long, because the thought of getting up at 10 or 11 is just plain awful. 

The bathroom is huge and includes a shower large enough to fit a party of four people (if that's your kind of thing) and a bathtub deep enough to store all your winnings. And there's a TV in the mirror in the event you want to bathe in your money and catch some prime time.

The rooms are spacious and though there's no casino to amuse you, it's walking distance from some of the more desirable entertainment locations of the strip.

Your nose will also appreciate the distinct (and pleasant) smells in the lobby and elevator.

I'd like to personally shake Mr Tofu's hand.  While I cannot medically prove it, I am 100% certain that their soondubu contains undefined healing properties.  Some how some way, I always feel better after a meal here.  

Got a cold?  Screw the Nyquil and get the spicy kimchi soondubu.

Bad day at work?  Beef soondubu=good f'n day

Broken leg?  Just splash a little pork soondubu broth on your leg and it'll probably heal instantly.  

Venereal disease?  Wait a couple of minutes before pouring it all over your crotch since it comes out piping hot.  Don't want to scare the other customers with your screaming.  Perhaps the seafood soondubu would be best for this.    

At $8 a bowl, even my wallet feels better!

This was the 4th service I tried. The other pet sitters I used didn't follow my instructions and some wouldn't even return my calls when I checked to see how my pets were doing.

I've been here a couple of times. It's decent cheap food. The owner's like to call it the Italian Chipotle. 

Basically you go thru the line like an assembly line and order your pasta and then the toppings and then pay. I think the angel hair pasta works perfectly for this type of eatery. First timers usually get crazy and load up on the toppings. I just get a meat item and some marinara sauce. They give you a bunch of pasta in your bowl so you won't leave that place hungry.

Used Creative moving about a month ago. What a great, family-run business. The guys were on time, courteous, and professional. They don't drag their feet - their goal is to get the job done right and as efficiently as possible. As a matter of fact, they came in UNDER the estimate! Not one broken item in the whole move. They carefully wrapped and padded our furniture, and took great care to avoid dinging walls, etc.
Would use Creative again in a heartbeat, and will be recommending them to everyone we know. Could not be more pleased after you hear so many negative things about other movers.

Over the years, I've been in a lot of sheet metal; Ferrari, Porsche, Bentley, you name it.

I've also been fortunate enough to have driven at the Charlotte Motor Speedway when it first reopened in several different cars.  But I have no idea what to say about Tesla, except something humorless about their cars not needing a cigarette lighter.

I've seen quite a few around town. And yes, it's a very nice car but... $122K for a Model S? I'll admit there's certainly a je nes se qua to them that attracts folks.  The stock price is another story. Really.  

The showroom also seems to do a brisk business in shirts, hats, et cetera.

But I hope they survive, live long and prosper.  If only because I don't want to hear about them being an electric deLorean.

Enjoy!  If you can.

Tickety Tacky in only the best way possible.  I actually really like this place.  The neon lights reminds me of my mothers make up in the 90's.

Nick the waiter was a sweetheart.  I am ridiculous in my requests sometimes, but he managed to cater to all of them.

The portions are huge!   My steak and spinach salad was delicious!  The steak was tender and medium rare just as I requested.  I asked for candied walnuts in it and Nick brought me a bowl of them!  That's what I call service.

Late night eats in Vegas!  I'll definitely be back!

Sorry to ruin the party concerning the high Yelp rating for this company, but this is my story. 

I called these guys and we agreed that they would come over to my house at 4pm for a regular service call. So I took off some time from the office to meet them at my house. I called them at 4:10pm and asked them what was going on, I had to leave a message. After a few minutes, they called me back and said they didn't have a technician near my house since they were in other parts of the valley so we would have to reschedule. WTF?

I rescheduled for the next week and while they called me about 15 minutes before the scheduled appointment, I told them that I was in another part of the valley and couldn't make the appointment. I then continued with my awesome lunch.

This may be the first review that I've awoken from a deep dream of peace to write.  Ok, first I had to make a pit stop, but then it was time to pen my thoughts and aspir... ooooh hoooold on, brb...

Now, where was I.  Here's a fun fact... the human body can hold up to a quarter of its own weight in disposable fluids, whose liberation can be mobilized by Arriba's own spinach enchiladas.  Ole!

That's right, the green leafy vegetable made famous by a marble-mouthed sailor, now compels me to blow my own ballast tanks... again and again

But I have to say, this couldn't have come at a better time, with tomorrow being the inaugurate outing of my office's hiking group.  Magic 8 Ball says "Signs point to yes" that I'll collapse 27 minutes into the trek from dehydration, and possibly require professional extrication.

You know what doesn't require professional extrication?  The cauldron of dysentery brewing in my lower GI.  Spiiiicy!

But to be fair, its not all waterloo, Arriba's.  I really should thank you for lightening my load, even though I've really never felt more bloated and irritated.  *quizzical look*

And if I ever nurture the desire to tarry in your cantina, which is somewhat reminiscent of The Blue Oyster on tango night, I'll be sure not to waste the opportunity, and schedule that pesky colonoscopy for the following morning.  Osmoprep's got nutin on you, honey.

We were in Vegas this past weekend and decided to check out Sushi Samba.  We did the tasting "omakase" menu and it was a hit with everyone on the table.  We got a nice sampling of everything there, it was all superb.  My favorite were the yellowtail tacos, yumm!  Most of all, we had a really great waitress, unfortunately i can't remember her name but she was very well informed and on top of it and she's the reason i'm giving this place 5 stars.

I had my first taste of Firehouse Subs today and decided to go with the Beef & Cheddar eight inch sandwich with a large Diet Dr. Pepper from their fabulous soda machine. That machine kind of reminds me of Rodney Dangerfield's character in the Caddyshack where he had that golf bag that played music, so versatile just like the soda machine delivering many different types of sodas. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3A9rLoz_0o

The Beef and Cheddar sandwich comes with bbq sauce and mayo. I got it without the mayo and it tasted fabulous. The only problem was that I felt a little hungry after eating it. So there's the rub, an excellent tasting meal with just a little bit of meat. Five stars for taste but one star for not putting out my 5 alarm hunger pangs.

The service and selection at Churchill's is as good as it gets! 

A friend of mine bought me a humidor from here as a gift. There was a continual problem with the small humidifier that attaches to the inside of the lid. 

After many attempts at fixing the issue, they made the decision to upgrade me to the next size, almost twice as big as well as upgrading the humidification system inside the box. 

Every time I walk in I'm greeted with a hello and if I need anything they're right there to take care of me.

Yet another really good burger option for the Chandler/101 area!

Over the last few months we've gotten a Smash Burger and now a Burger21 last week. If UR into red meat, how can you go wrong?

I came here to grab something for a late night at the office and Burger21 hit the roof of my flavortown mouth. Sorry Fieri!  LOL

I kept it simple. The cardiac arrest Blue Cheese and Bacon burger for only $7.95 and a Chocolate Malt ($4.95) to wash it down. Both were good. 

Expect to pay $12 or so, if you order a soft drink. Don't  those iced cold beers looked good? There's a real high probably I'll be back with some co-workers real soon.

Up until this past week it's been about four years since I've been to Corleone's. My wife ordered a chicken sandwich which she loved. So that was a major hurdle to satisfy the picky eater in the family.

 I had the sausage, greenpeppers and onions with the marinara sauce. Since I've been minimizing my consumption of bread lately, I just ate everything except the bun. The presentation of the meal is pretty impressive when you look at two large buns filled with stuff. But when you get into the meat of the meal you find that there's a lot more bun than meat. I have to say that I enjoyed the meal but thought the ratio of meat to bun was pretty weak.

I say this place is Yelped correctly at 3 1/2 stars.

1300+ reviews don't lie. This place is quite delicious. 

Why the one star? Because I ate here on Tuesday 4/23 and started having food poisoning symptoms two days later. It's been five days and I'm still in pain and have lost 13 pounds due to so much water loss. I had to visit the ER yesterday for dehydration. After multiple complaints from other patrons, Firefly was shut down today for a health inspection. 

However, this is not the first time I became ill after eating here. A couple years ago, I had their fish sticks and started violently vomiting soon after. After some time, I decided to give this place another chance. Everything was good...until now. 

It's such a shame because Firefly has delicious tapas and drinks. This was my go-to place for a long time. But apparently staff members aren't keeping clean and washing their hands or they're not handling their food properly.

I've already given this place a second chance. A third chance? I highly doubt it. Eat here at your own risk.

This is a nice casual place to get some fish. They cook it up anyway you want it (cue Journey), whether it be fried, grilled, blackened, etc.

I have ordered the Taco Mountain every time I've been there. You have a choice of other types of meat besides fish. I always go for the fish. I find that the fish is always fresh and cooked just right. The next time I go in there I'll have to order something different. Pro Tip - This place is a zoo during Fridays when Lent is in season. When you can't find a parking spot, you might as well go with Plan B.

Three Birds left and pounds of Steel makes for good target practice! 

The Pittsburgh Steelers have one of the best records in football history. They have won 5 out of 42 Super Bowls. Only 3 teams have won 5 and that is the Steelers, the Cowboys and the SF 49's. Seeing the Steelers are the only one of those three in the playoffs, they could break all records this year, by winning 6 Super Bowls. IF they go to the Super Bowl again this year, it will be their 7TH appearance.

IF, is the biggest word in the English language. If my grandmother had 4 wheels, she would be a box car. 

I was not thrilled when Bill Cowher left the Steelers, but I must say Mike Tomlin has done a fine job and we were blessed, to have had two great coaches. 

I have been an avid collector of autographed sports memorabilia for many, many years. I have quite a lot of autographed Steelers merchandise, including a football jersey signed by the Steel Curtain. 

I can't help but admire that more and more each week and think of how Mean Joe Green and LC Greenwood will be watching the games, with nerves of steel and how Ernie Holmes and Mad Dog Dwight White will be smiling down upon Big Ben, Willie Parker, Hines Ward, Troy Polamalu, Harrison, Holmes and the rest of the team. 

This week the Steelers have home field advantage of a ridiculous time of 6:30 against the Ravens. The Ravens play hard and rough and my fingers are crossed that we beat them for a third time this year. 

Everyone is thinking of how great it would be to have a PA. Super Bowl. I went to Heinz Field for the 2004 Eagles/Steelers game. I drove from Philadelphia along with Eagles Fans galore. We won and it was an awesome ride home. 

GO STEELERS!! You rock my world! Give me one for the other hand!

I came here to celebrate my nephews 3rd birthday. The park is nestled in a neighborhood of houses. Since the park is dog friendly, I brought my dog, Brownie along for the party. I walked her on a trail that went around the park as well took her over to the large grassy area the park has to interact with the other dogs there. The grassy area isn't fenced in, so I was surprised at how many pet owners had their dogs off leashes, tsk tsk. The bathroom is large and has entry on either side of the building for males and females. They have an area where the kiddos can get wet, but unfortunately the day we were there the wind was blowing and it was cold, so most of the kids played at the playground. The playground is nice even though the swings were roped off for repair and I am a girl who loves to swing so that was a bummer! The park was clean and the area that was reserved for the party was spacious enough with a shade structure and the nearby bathrooms, BBQ grill and trash cans were convenient. They also have a small skate park too, but I didn't make it over to check it out fully. The water fountains were clean and lights came on in the park after a certain hour and lit everything up fine. All in all a decent neighborhood park.

Get the chili dog!

Dillon's is a chain down in Arizona.  BBQ is their specialty.  Kind of like the Famous Dave's of the Southwest.  Have been to the Glendale location in the past.  Solid.  This place brings it to another level.  Situated on Lake Pleasant, just outside of old timers land in NW Phoenix burbs. 

They have a vernicular to get you down to the Lake? How cool is that? I am sure that I will appreciate that in my later ages when I retire down there in my golden years.  Look at the old guy getting busy!:

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dillons-morristown?select=wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqA#wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqA

Anyways, their chili dog is out of this world.  See my picture.  Comes on a hamburger bun with two sliced dogs, topped with cheese and jalapenos and BBQ pulled pork.  Just died and went to heaven.  Gives the Gopher Bar a run for its money. 4.99999!

The newest kid on the strip is still the sexiest!

Yup, as soon as you walk into the lobby, you are invited in with the allure of large glass columns with ever changing themes. Chic mirrors and chandeliers dripping with crystals from the ceiling and everything around you just seems to sparkle with a sleek, sexy flare that is all Vegas. 

I checked in for the July 4th weekend and got up sold by a very aggressive front desk clerk that insisted on getting me into the penthouse.  I settled for a 910sq. ft. angle suite on the 58th floor with additional Japanese soaking tub, terrace with a view of the Bellagio fountains, kitchenette with fridge & microwave and an additional full sized bath with shower. Not too shabby.   

The room I must say was very spacious, the view off the expansive terrace was breathtaking and i used the soaking tub practically every night after the clubs so it worked out great!

My only complaint was with housekeeping.  There's a circular red paper note you're supposed to leave on the bed to have your linens changed, which i did but every night i came back to the room, my sheets were done but not changed! It was ridonkulous! Even the dirty pillow that had some sketchy black skid mark smeared on it (that i never used from day one) remained in my room til the last day i was there....nuts!

Perhaps all the smoke and mirrors at the entrance lobby had me blinded by the hotel's sexy charm but with all due respect, my stay was very enjoyable and despite the minor flaws, I had a fantastic time... 

With that said, the hotel was conveniently located in the heart of the strip. It's steps away from the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood and Paris...and the Sahra Spa, brunch and pool were very enjoyable...and partying at the Marquee & Bond was priceless!


Happy Times!

Stone Crabs ... We came to Joe's for the famous Stone Crabs ..., but they didn't have any. Why? Only Joe's knows. We should of left.

Unfortunately, Joe's was already our second choice of the night (after seeing the long line at Bacchanal) and we weren't going in search of a 3rd restaurant. We were hungry, so, let's eat at Joe's.

Luckily, the other food was pretty tasty. We started with some glasses of inexpensive Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon and a Colossal Lump Crab Cake ($17). I liked the big bits of crab that didn't require (or have) much other seasoning (4 stars). 

Equally, the Chilean Sea Bass with Miso Glaze & Bok Choy ($37) and 20 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye Steak ($53) were 4-star entrees. The sea bass was flaky and the miso subtle. Meanwhile, the juicy and tender rib eye was meaty despite not being an elite steak. As a side, we split a creamy Wild Mushroom Mac and Cheese ($11) that excited thanks to the mushrooms and disappointed with lame cheese (3 stars).

Sadly, the service was weak. We suffered long gaps between being seated, ordering, getting food, or service. We wanted to try the acclaimed Key Lime Pie, but chose to try a different place at the Forum Shops at Caesars rather than put up with the poor service.

Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab is famous in Miami for fantastic Stone Crabs and Key Lime Pie. We didn't get to try either. Instead, Joe's became a basic Joe Schmo steak and seafood chain with high prices for the average Joe.

I was very excited to be chosen for this event, and not just because I got a sneak preview of J-WoW's sweater.  It was also to be the first time the lunch bunch would meet our cyber friend, Kazi, in person.

The venue was fantastic, located between 2 parking garages, next to an outdoor ice rink.  Upon arriving at the registration table, I spied the Santa photo op, so I grabbed Kazi for her first ever Yelp Elite photo (show some love and friend our newest Elite)

While at the bar, I indulged in a cherry vanilla porter, and I liked it.  The trio of ample hummus bowls were a delight, and I'm not ashamed to admit returning for seconds.

The hot chocolate was the finest I've ever tasted, especially after adding peppermint syrup and a heaping mound of whipped cream. 

While the food and beverage was delightful, the conversation was the high point, and I was lucky enough to spend a few minutes with the beautiful and engaging Kazi.  I loved seeing my friends... and meeting new Yelpers face to face is the icing on the cookie! (which there were a lot of)

I witnessed my first ever ugly Christmas poncho when J-WoW's +1, Linh, made his grand entrance.  Santa Sat on my lap, and my cheek was kissed by a pretty little lady who disappeared into the crowd. 

All in all, a pretty good night

Try saying Bobby Q three times really fast in a southern accent. It sounds like you're saying Barbeque.

I can't believe that I've been living in this area for a few years and I just started patronizing Bobby Q's. There's definitely a happening vibe to this place after dark. The place is packed and the air is buzzing with conversations and laughter. They have ample seating inside and outside. We met some friends that have never been here a few weeks ago and they became instantly hooked.

We ordered steaks, pulled pork, ribs and brisket. Everything along with the sides were fabulous. My brisket was tender and the flavor instantly transported my taste buds to a happy place. The pulled pork was equally as good. I've had the ribs on other trips to Bobby Q and have always enjoyed them. I got a big thumbs up on the steak from my dining companion so I'm going to have to try that next time I'm in the house. The tab for four people without alcohol and before tip was $70. 

This is definitely my favorite BBQ place in the metro area.

It's BRITNEY, B*TCH!!!!

Fabulous show!!!  Lights, theatrics, vivid sets, striking costumes, outrageous dance performances, smooth song transitions ... It was a very entertaining show!  Her songs alone will get you off your feet to dance, dance, dance ... So I didn't mind standing 95% of the 90-minute show.  You could sit but you wouldn't be able to see since everyone was standing and dancing, which makes for a high energy, fun show.

We all have heard it time and time again, she lip syncs her shows ... SO WHAT!!!  She's not Adele or any high caliber vocalist!!  I'm sure they're not jumping and flying all over the stage at their concerts, it's impossible to dance and sing perfectly!  So prerecorded?  I don't care!!  She's an awesome performer with beat-thrilling, ass-shaking songs!  

Btw: Sorry that douche cheated on you, Brit.  Good job dropping his @ss!!!  Demand to be cherished and nothing less!!!   You looked great, post popping out 2 kids!  Keep it up, girlie!!!

*This review is dedicated to Brandon C. for reviewing Brit's boutique http://www.yelp.com/biz/britney-spears-boutique-las-vegas?hrid=XPYdszVwVxkPiTZ2qqrLPA.  Now go watch the show!!!!  lol!

Well Happy New Year everyone!

I was in the area and remembered there was a Luke's of Chicago nearby.  Sadly, to paraphrase Shakespeare's Hamlet: "Alas, poor Luke (Yorick)! I knew him" well!  

Seems the Chicago dog placed closed a while ago, replaced with the 5 minute pizza place Fired Pie. We have a Fired Pie up on Northsight in Scottsdale.  It too has moved into a former Chicago dog place, in that case Al's Beef.

I arrived around 1:45 and had only a few folks ahead of me in line.  I ordered their Tomato Basil (see photos) adding saut onions and mushrooms.  It came to only $7.75 which has to be a steal.

There was a nice amount cheese and sauce, with a hint of garlic.  It had a nice flavor and made me think of more expensive pizza places like Pomo's Cucina. The only drawback is that it's an "ultra thin" pie which they press out ahead of time (again see photos).  On the plus side, Fired Pie also has a small wine and beer list

So Four Stars, and yes I am a Fan.

Completely and utterly RIDICULOUS.

We came here for - surprise, surprise - a bachelorette party, but in stark contrast to the other partygoers, we were completely sober.  

Which ensured that I can reiterate with absolute confidence: completely and utterly RIDICULOUS.

The show started with a very loud montage of shows that these guys have been on - the View, Oprah, Jennifer Love Hewitt talking *about* them on Jay Leno.  It was essentially an extended commercial for something that we were already there for.  Then the guys came out and did a group dance that looked more like an aerobics routine than the HAWTEST ALL-MALE REVUE IN THE WORLD.  

This is how it went:

1.  Group dance: aerobics, aerobics, aerobics...FLASH CHEST! (crowd screams)...aerobics, aerobics, aerobics...FLASH ABS! (crowd screams)...aerobics, aerobics, aerobics...FLASH CHEST AGAIN! (crowd screams).  Guys go amongst the crowd (crowd screams).

2.  Individual dance: guy comes out, does aerobics, comes out into the crowd to find a cute veiled bachelorette to join him onstage.  Said bachelorette accepts lapdance, fondles chest and ass, gets a hug, and goes back to her seat.  Dancer does more aerobics then returns backstage.

Repeat steps 1 and 2 ad nauseum, then end show with step 1 again.

We were hoping for a lot of ass, maybe a glimpse of the package, but all we got was a lot of aerobics performed by men with too many clothes on.  Seriously, when they took off a pair of pants, (SURPRISE!) there was ANOTHER pair of pants on underneath.  When they took off the boxer briefs, (SURPRISE!) there was a g string on underneath.  They would have lasted freaking forever in a game of strip poker.  

I'm giving them an extra star for the sheer amusement they gave me (I laughed A LOT during this show), and because one of the guys shook my hand at the end.  Oh, and for all the Guns 'N Roses and Bon Jovi.  But really, why do women have to sit through all this crap when female strippers get right to the point and go straight for the pole?  

Hey Mick Dundee, dispose of the cheese and just show me your damn goods.

I was reading in my IBD yesterday that Zoe's Kitchen was going public today. So why not write a review.

My first experience with Zoe's Kitchen was a couple of years ago at a CMYE at this location. I thought it was good but unfortunately too far from the house or work. Well, since the office moved nearby, I go here about once a week.

I order the 2 Chicken Kabobs which comes with a Greek Salad, rice and a few very small pitas. I really enjoy this meal even though I think it's a bit too pricey. I saw a couple of dudes enjoying the Steak Kabobs the last time I was in there, so I'll probably order that next time.

Chiploplo, Chipoodle, Chipotopolay

Looking for a pre-show meal, we saw the nearby choices of A)McDonald's, B)Panda Express or C)Chipotle.  Considering I don't like McDonald's, Panda Express is on my usual restaurant rotation & I haven't had Chipotle in a few years, the time was ripe to give Chipotle another go.

My choice - the barbacoa bowl.  

My 2 cents - It was..........how do I put this?  Boring.  Boring like the scene in "Ferris Beuller's Day Off" where Ben Stein is going "Anyone..........?  Anyone.........? Beuller........?Beuller.........?"  Boring like having a CSPAN viewing party on Valentine's Day.  Nothing says "sexytime" than Senate hearings in HD;p

Now, it wasn't bad, per se.  It's just, as I get older, I want my tastebuds to be titillated!  (I just said "titillated" *giggle*)  The portions were good.  The price was reasonable.  Also, kudos to the staff for efficiently moving the big Las Vegas line along.  Wait was minimal.  To me, I'd rather go to a local taqueria for some authentic and cheap fare, w/o the line of hipsters, Beliebers and Twi-hards.  

Chipotle is situated in a primo location to lure in the tourists.  The restaurant was clean and the staff knows how to handle the crowds coming in for sustenance, like me.  

Chipotle has it's fans, and more power to them for liking what they like.  I may return if I'm walking by, the next time I'm in Vegas.  It's convenient and the prices are reasonable, considering the dining options in the casinos.

I love this place!  I noticed a lot of people there and wondered if it was worth the trip.  I wasn't disappointed.  On the day I went, I had a vegieburger and it was really good, came with a salad and blue chips. I brought half of it home and had the other half for dinner.  I also ordered a drink that was cherry and chocolate (delicious).  I am a big fan and would go more but it is a little expensive.  Also took a slice of the chocolate pomegranate cake (their signature dish) and it was really outstanding.  I shall return!

Ted's is a Phoenix original by way of Buffalo and has probably fed tens of thousands ASU students and teachers over the years.

Ted's history is similar to that of other Hot Dog pioneers like Paul and Betty Pink, Nathan Handwerker, and Dick Portillo. All who started with just a Hot Dog cart, and grew their business into something very special. 

But Ted's is the immigrant story of Theodore Spiro Liaros, who came to the US from Greece at the turn of the last century.  

One of these days, someone will take the time to write the history of all the hard working Greeks who came here with just the shirt on their back, to start a restaurant or food business.

But I digress, because you come to Ted's to enjoy the charcoal grilled hot dogs and hamburgers and all the friendly conversation on line. Ahh, and those charcoals are white hot (see photo), which makes their food oh so delicious.  

They have Hot Dogs, Hamburgers, Brats, Italian Sausages, French Fries and home made beer batter like Onion Rings (photo), along with Milk Shakes and Malts.

Ted's is really just great food, served simply. I can highly recommend those afore mentioned All Beef Hot Dogs, Sausage and Onion Rings. All the tube steaks are $3.79 and you can take home some of their special bottled mustard for $5.39 as I did.

Enjoy!

When it comes to parties, Steve Wynn's Encore Beach Club and XS Night Club are still the gold standard for the hottest spots in town.

I came to the Beach Club on Sunday at around 2:oopm to see Calvin Harris and surprisingly there was hardly no wait at all! I've heard horror stories where people were turned away even though they bought tickets for the show because the venue was beyond capacity. In any case, we got in, I was happy...

SCORE!!

As soon as we walked through security, I witnessed an ocean of skin filling the entire space! And this pool area was huge! 

Damn these people are beautiful! I suggest ordering drinks on the left side of the entrance cuz the drinks were bigger, stiffer and the same price!  

I tried the food as well and it was also very good! I recommend the grilled chicken sandwich and the steak sliders, both were mouthwatering good and excellent accompaniments to our drinks!

Calvin Harris came out about 3:00pm and the crowd was buzzing by now with anticipation! There was so much energy in the pit but it was all positive, no hating, no shoving or any nonsense like that...it was all love and good times and that's how it should be!

Bravo Encore Beach Club!

I had a slammin time and I look forward to coming back very soon!

Happy Times!

Fukuburger, Fuku so good!

Located inside FAME at the LINQ, Fukuburger offers innovative Asian-inspired burgers, fries and loco moco for those looking to tantalize the palate.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#k0iG_a95OyoEJpJz9Fumsg

When I saw the Tamago burger ($7.99), I knew I had to have it.  I'm an egg slut from way back.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#gr4jTA0IVQkD2Pw7J-Qd9w
Fuku-patty with furikake & teriyaki, finished with crispy onion rings & fried egg.  The first bite was like a rainbow shining down on me. Like Willy Wonka farted candy into the air.  Runny egg oozing over the delicious patty, the sweetness of the teriyaki married together with the crunch of the onion rings.  A fairly sized burger, I felt the pricepoint was a decent value, considering it is Vegas.  I relished each delicious bite.

Service was okay.  It took a while for my burger to be cooked, but I know it's made fresh to order so I can't complain.  There is bar seating directly in front, with tables insided & outside FAME.

Free jelly candy!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#DNzhAcLMgJFh-kOR8wLL_w

Fukuburger, I'm a big fan!  The Tamago burger was the real deal & one of the highlights, of many, from my trip to Vegas.  I hope you come back to SoCal so I can satisfy my cravings for your Asian-inspired delectables again!

Highly recommend!

"I have no idea what our PIN is. I"m sorry. What other information may I give you."
"The social security number for the primary customer."
"Oh, well that's my partner and I'm not sure what it is. I have our address, phone number, our account number..."

"OK Melika. Look honey. I'm trying to GIVE you money. I'm not changing my plan or even making fun of your dumb ass company yet. Just wanna GIVE you money."
"Without your PIN or social security number I cannot tell you the minimum due but I can take a payment."
"Oh. Well now we're getting somewhere. Melika. By the way, we're you named after a coffee maker? Great let's pay $165 like I did last month and see where that gets us."
"Thank you sir for you payment. And, yes, I was named after a coffee maker. Thank you for choosing Cox Communications for all your media and digital needs. Have a nice day."
Two days later. Our cable and internet is turned off. Because she could not tell me my minimum amount and I was short by $4.83. Our services were turned off. And I didn't "choose" Cox. It was forced on me like Catholicism and puberty. Cox? You suck!

So as 4 of us were waiting in line to buy tickets at 9:15pm on a Sunday, a random, friendly girl gave us three tickets and in a flash she was gone.  We were in total disbelief.  I was still skeptical up to the part where they scanned the ticket.  Saved us $111!!  I owe her some Sprinkles at the very least if we ever cross paths again.  

Currently the largest observatory wheel in the world (wonder how much of a pain it will be when it becomes the 2nd), there's not much to say about the ride itself.  You go around for 30 minutes, see the strip, snap pics and it's over.  The waiting area before getting to the actual wheel is very Disney Worldesque.  

The "guide" is a guy on a video screen dishing out facts and bad jokes (420 ft! You're really high!!).   I wonder why they didn't have different performers from Caesars shows doing video segments instead?  Imagine what the Gazillionaire and Penny would say?!  They could do the "quiet tour" with Teller.

The biggest variable with how enjoyable your ride will be are the others in your pod.  Each pod is supposed to fit 40 people.  I saw a family with 5 small and loud kids on their rollerskate sneakers in front of us and I would have done almost anything to avoid being in the same pod including lighting myself on fire.  We rode with about 20 others that were fine and excited to be on the ride.  

Other things:

- Try to go for the seats on the immediate right upon getting into the pod.
- Nighttime has to be better than daytime.  
- Please go to the restroom before getting on.

SLS = STAY THE F*CK AWAY

What, the acronym doesn't match? Well, it doesn't f*cking matter, because you should avoid this place like the f*cking plague.

Here is a (too long) list of things that went wrong during our less-than-48-hours stay:

1. The elevator in the attached parking structure broke down TWICE for extended periods of time.

2. LiFE Nightclub didn't let anyone in until about 11:30 Friday night despite a HUGE line outside because of an isolated power outage.

3. THERE WAS NO HOT WATER FOR AT LEAST 6 HOURS ON ONE OF THE NIGHTS. THIS IS THE MIDDLE OF F*CKING VEGAS WINTER AND YOU HAVE NO HOT WATER?! SERIOUSLY?!

4. Despite all of the above, it still took me and my dad hours of bitch-mayhem at the front desk to get our ridiculous $28/night resort fee waived.

5. Housekeeping was EXTREMELY cheap. Used up toiletries were NOT replaced the second day.

I would give this place zero stars if Yelp allowed it. But since I'm forced to give it at least one star, I will say that the hotel rooms do have cool illuminated infinity mirrors. But that's it.

Where other companies implode old hotels and rebuild something new and magnificent, SBE only slightly remodeled the old Sahara.

NEVER AGAIN.

This chocolate heaven at the Aria hotel just makes me so happy. As soon as i saw those chocolate flowers on the wall http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=zqVvDm_-ikgvhPMZrUK3Lg, i was giddy!
There was the gelato bar with a great variety of flavors: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=7K-QKzgV0XdrlZOX9aMRng, a crepe station, sandwiches, cakes galore, pastries, chocolates and lots of fun and cute stuff - from wedding cake favors http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=wzlynGBt9AZbLQevhF8jjg to Thrilla
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=ZRq2lJn-JoOHLqUOZNYQVg
It was almost impossible to pick which cake i wanted. We settled on triple chocolate cake (so decadent!) topped with a fab macaron. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=HfgazxGFRJ6nZO2MXGcNsQ
We also shared a tasty crepe: rich and very indulgent. Loved it! 

One thing i didn't love was when I asked a worker if they sold individual macarons and the guy said yes and pointed me to the coconut macaroons. I was even more annoyed when I saw labels for the rose macaron cake say macaroon. However the prepacked macarons were labeled "French macarons".  Anthony N pointed it out to me that macaroon is the English translation for macaron; but seriously at Jean Philippe I would like to see it labeled Macaron, especially when they ALSO sell macarooooons. It's like a prestigious french restaurant having "fat liver" on their menu instead of foie gras. Luckily my annoyance quickly dissipated when i took a bite of that triple chocolate cake!!!

Love the music.
Love the entertainer.
Didn't love the performance.

Michael Jackson One reminded me how much I love Michael Jackson music and also reminded me how much I miss the entertainer that he was.

This Cirque du Soleil show was still very good ... less because of the "story" or "acts" and more for the pure joy, inspiration, and energy hearing Michael Jackson songs brings. Actually the story of 4 misfits searching for the white glove, shoes, hat, and sunglasses of MJ was downright silly. I really didn't care for Shy or Clumsy (the other two are called Sneaky and Smarty Pants). Less of them and more of the music could of made Michael Jackson One a 5-star experience truly worthy of the $155/ticket (plus additional Ticketmaster fees).

A few highlights:

 * A hologram of Michael Jackson dancing to "Man in the Mirror" was like watching a cool movie of Michael up close. 

 * The "Bad" performance brings back memories of break dancing ...

 * "Billie Jean" features dancers in multicolored lit suits and acrobats around the theater.

 * "Thriller" filled with trampolines and zombies was ok.

 * More than once, the show shares messages of hope and equality ... especially during "They Don't Care About Us."

 * "Smooth Criminal" may of been my favorite ... because I love the song and the "lean"

Some of the songs were:

 - Beat It
 - Leave Me Alone
 - Bad
 - Smooth Criminal
 - I'll Be There
 - Human Nature
 - Jam
 - They Don't Care About Us
 - Earth Song
 - Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'
 - The Way You Make Me Feel
 - Dangerous
 - Dirty Diana
 - Workin' Day and Night
 - Billie Jean
 - Thriller
- I Just Can't Stop Loving You
 - Man in the Mirror
 - Can You Feel It
 - Black or White
 - Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough

Those are some memorable tunes ... Forget about all the distractions and story. 

      Go for your love of the music. 
      Go for your love of the entertainer. 
      Remember how much you miss Michael Jackson.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 60/100

Pretty solid shopping mall in Vegas! One of the best ones I visited during my most recent trip. It's huge and actually feels like a real mall as opposed to some of the hotels who have a few shops (less than 20-30) and consist of stores that nobody would ever be interested in actually shopping at.

At the front of the mall, there's a smaller area that consists of several floors with an awesome winding escalator. On the second (or third? I can't remember), it leads further back into a whole other section of the mall...which goes on for forever! So many stores! They range from normal/average, to high end and luxury brands. There are also lots of restaurants and cafes located in the mall.

The one reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because I felt like I was getting kind of confused as to the layout of the mall. It's weird how there's the small-ish entryway area (reminds me of the big mall in San Francisco), and then on one floor it kinda just continues further and farther away from everything else. Also, the mall map directory was kind of confusing and I wasn't sure what direction to walk in.

I would say this mall is comparable to the Venetian's, except slightly different architecture! Both very European.

Grassroots rates 3 1/2 stars for me but I'll round up with 4 stars for this review. They serve the beer ice cold which I love. I started off with the appetizer of the pulled pork sliders which were delicious. For the main course I had the sliced brisket with some funky side to it which was forgettable as far as I'm concerned. They don't give you enough BBQ Sauce so you have to ask for more. The brisket was just okay for me, and for what they were charging it should have tasted much better.

The service was decent. This place is a great alternative if you ever get stuck waiting in line at that hip pizza place across the way. I would definitely come back and try some other menu items. Just when I thought it was safe to carry the Discover Card I find out that this place doesn't accept it. I think the Discover Card was rolled out in the mid 1980's. Hey Grassroots, if you want to be that upscale and sophisticated go to restaurant and bar then you'll have to accept all major credit cards.

You can't say no to these amazing slabs of meat!

I ordered the **Steak Bordelaise** which is topped with caramelized onions and accompanied by frites. The steak is incredibly tender and melts in your mouth! The sweetness from the caramelized onions blended so well with the meaty juiciness. And I couldn't stop popping those frites in my mouth, one after another. They had the perfect texture: thin and crisp yet dense in flavor.

The **Paris Romance** cocktail, elegant and refreshing, is composed of Malibu Rum, Amaretto, a splash of pineapple juice, a dash of Grenadine, grapefruit juice, and some secret magic ingredients. Served in a chilled martini glass, it is the perfect accompaniment to such a fine-tuned meal.

The decor and ambiance reflect classy French charm, without being overbearing in the slightest. For dinner it was dimly lit and offered a warm comforting vibe. Service was flawless, although I have to say we made it pretty easy since we all knew we wanted steak and frites. 

You will definitely get the bang for your buck here. Upscale experience but at way more reasonable prices than many other restaurants in Las Vegas. Use your $$$ for going out later that night or hitting up the tables. :)

DATE TIP: Oui oui!

Just got this message from one of the owners (their review is under Jestin M.) 

this is me one of the owner of Tina's cafe.  you are obviously a poor idiot who is miserable in life.  If you have a nerve, you should've tell your complaint to us instead of crying out on yelp.  We have so many flowers and will continue doing great. Tina will bit the fack out of you if you come and let her know who you are.  ASS HOLE. Go back to your Mexico and eat corn with your whore mother.  by the way, your picture looks like a a guy who is infected with some kinds of disease.   Your women is ugly as you btw (lol)

So after this I personally called and spoke with a manager, they confirmed Jestin works there. Even though I was being cordial with my tone and trying to be helpful in saying that this was my experience, maybe others are experiencing the same thing and that can help fix the problem, they proceeded to say a few things I wont retype here and hung up. 

I responded back and so did they. If you want to read that here is a screen shot of that: 
http://i.imgur.com/PvcBz.jpg

So it was not enough for them to say that message. They just texted me this right now (since I called with my cell). 

"You keep mentioning 5yrs old about your stupid compain, we will report your info to be investigated if you are a child melester. Tina has a right not serve you for the safty of our customer. Take your little 10 dollar to mcdonald's. Lol"

Here is a screen shot of the text I just got from the business phone number:

Who would have thought I'd find myself downtown at a rundown casino like Palace Station, but there I was on a late Sunday night enjoying one of the most satisfying dishes sin city had to offer! 

Yup, I'm talkin about the Pan Roast at Oyster Bar! 

Do yourself a huge favor and order the palace version with shrimp chicken andouille sausage and crab. I added lobster too. But either way, It's the bomb, cuz its all about that crazy good sauce! Keep in mind however, to truly enjoy this dish, you've gotta love your spice! Trust, each bite will be a scorching spoonful of fiery goodness! Chunks of meaty sausage, chicken and seafood in every bite and I bet you won't be able to put your spoon down! Well, except to wipe your forehead from the sweat cuz this bad boy is hot hot hot! But oooh soooo hot diggity good! I ordered a level 7 (1-10 being spiciest) and it was just right!

We started with 1/2 a dozen oysters on the half shell, and that was an excellent intro to our fantastic meal! The oysters were fresh and went down the hatch nicely with a swig of cold frosty Kirin! 

We also ordered the shrimp scampi. It came served with loads of succulent tiger shrimp, a heaping serving of fresh chopped garlic and noodles swimming in a pool of buttery glory. Although it was tasty, it simply couldn't hold a candle to the signature pan roast IMO! 

I'm tellin ya, order the pan roast and enjoy! Your taste buds and tummy will thank you for it!

Happy Eats!

When the king of pop decided against "Beautiful Young Thing" for his epic 1982 album, Thriller, that set the wheels in motion for what we know today as BYT.

When this place is packed, and it gets packed, you'll be doing the moonwalk as patrons enter and exit by means of any open crevice between you and the other line-mongers.  Michael was so right... You Are Not Alone, but tough it out, because once you sink those bleached choppaz into your first bite, you'll Wanna Be Startin Somethin.

I can personally vouch for the carne asada, chicked and birria tacos, with the later being my favorite.  My wife and I split a carne, cheese and bean burrito.  My only complaint was the fatty chunks, and the gristle.  I wont ding them too hard, as they were totally slammed.

The biggest disappointment of the night came in a styrofoam cup.  The side of frijoles we ordered had to have been from a can... like a can of Rosarita.  I can see them needing a fallback with as  busy as they were, its possible they could have sold out of the good stuff.  I wont know for sure, until my return visit.  I use Elmer's Tacos or Rancho Market as my bean baseline, so be on your A game guys, because based on The Way You Make Me Feel will determine if I'm going to continue to Rock With You, or not... because I will Remember The Time.

I also polished off an order of chips & salsa, a Mexican coke and a large horchata... so I left pre-diabetic and pretty stuffed... so much that I almost didn't recognize that Man In The Mirror.

Friends ask: What's your favorite car?

I say: Hands down, super cars!  Who doesn't drool for the exotics?!

Friends go on to tell me that there's a track in which you can drive them as fast as you want, yadda yadda. 

Me: No Brainer! Of course I want in!!
 
If you can't be behind the wheel for whatever reason, hey, you can be a back-seat driver! As I was waiting for my turn I saw a few people riding as a passenger alongside a real race car driver.  I felt their excitement just by looking at their expressions as they got out of the car. They sure got the ride of a lifetime! 

Most of the employees here are a friendly bunch. They know what they are doing and seem to enjoy their jobs. The owner was on duty that day and noticed we were waiting for quite a while, so they offered my friend a free upgrade and tried to move things along as fast as possible. He paid for the regular Ferrari and got to drive the scuderia instead. I notice that they keep adding more and more cars to their garage! How I wished they had a McLaren when I was there!

Okay, okay. I'll leave you all with a cheesy picture. Here's a photo of me in a ridiculous helmet but in a white lambo:

The year: 2010.
  
The episode: "Phoenix."

The Man: Adam Richman, himself.

The Challenge: Chompie's "The Ultimate Slider Challenge."

...12 Original Jewish Sliders: each one brisket-filled and gravy-drizzled, stacked as well with mini potato pancakes, Jack cheese, and onion strings.  Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.  Instead, I ordered the Combo.  And after tearing through an incredibly tasty two, alongside a cup of Matzo Ball soup, I was full.  Adam, however, he Manned-up!  Sadly, though, after a hard-fought battle, he--as many have before him--ultimately threw in the towel. The Challenge, it seemed, proved too hefty.  Food had won.

...However, if one, brave soul decides to accept this heaping challenge ($39.95) and conquers this plattered beast, it's free.  But not only that: upon winning, you will be forever immortalized on Chompie's "Hall of Fame" website (http://chompies.com/wall-of-fame/) and an "Ultimate Slider Challenge" T-shirt awaits you and your bragging self!! You bad!!  (By the way, there's no California representation on that website, zero, none, not one, nada...  Who'll step up?

This having been my first time to Chompie's, I was truly impressed!  A Yelp check-in offer allowed for a free bagel from their awesome deli/bakery; our very cool server, Trudy, brought out a few, free cookie samples for this first-timer; and our just-as-cool host made lunch suggestions, which we ordered verbatim.  As promised, those Sliders were "deli-icious."  And the Matzo Ball and Chicken soup hit the spot.  But I couldn't leave...not yet.  As full as I was, I couldn't head back to CA without first trying the carrot cake, could I?  I mean, you don't blame me, right?

So, "Man vs Food"...  That takes care of Phoenix: Alice Cooper'stown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/alice-cooperstown-phoenix?hrid=esDZwjuGZQlkpKrZAC_guQ), Los Reyes de la Torta (http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-reyes-de-la-torta-phoenix-2?hrid=nJiqRCfTtxs2bIoFrPdmkA), and now Chompie's.  On deck, LA.

Place is bomb dot com
Must visit when in Phoenix
In my top five joints 

Long before Yelp or the Travel Channel, my go to source for finding the best places to check out when travelling was a book called "Eat Your Way Across the USA."  I think this was only one of two places in Arizona that the book featured.  Went to Richardson's for the first time in probably the late 90's or early 2000's and have been hooked ever since.  It is among my absolute most favorite restaurants.

A couple years back, the original location was destroyed by fire.  This was my first time in the new location which is right around the corner from the original spot.  The interior looks almost exactly like the old location.  They now have mandatory valet, though, which I am not crazy about.

In the past, I have gotten the huevos rancheros and the enchiladas.  Best I have ever had for both.  Today, I got the Trio which was Swordfish, Salmon and Mahi Mahi.  Came on a tortilla with asparagus and carrots.  Outstanding!  They have five dollar mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys during brunch hours.  Had one mimosa and one bellini.

I wish I had just come to Richardson's straight from the airport when I arrived last Tuesday.  It is that freaking good!

Best way to relax in Vegas before your flight home! They definitely know how to pamper you here. Two words: Free B&B (Buffet & Booze).

The lunch/dinner buffet offers light, delicious options. The highlight for me were the super tender **Braised Short Ribs** served over slow-cooked creamy polenta. Warm, savory, and juicy! Also delightful were the **Spinach & Ricotta Gnudi**, perfect little dumplings with a dash of tomato and basil. A fresh corn salad, roasted zucchini, and arugula salad were flavorful and healthy side dishes. The **Vanilla Honey Panna Cotta with Summer Berries** gave the meal a smooth finish.

A whole array of cocktails welcomes you at the bar. Just take your pick and go relax. Love this perk!

You can get some work done in the conference area or in one of the more private work booths. Or sit back and watch TV in the lounge area. Or take a sweet nap on the comfy reclining personal couches. We opted for #3 -- nap.

The decor is very mod and clean, while the setting is quiet and relaxing. My only complaint is that at one point, two employees began talking pretty loudly in Spanish. The serene vibe was slightly ruined, but I was already so content on my cozy napping device that I dozed off anyway.

Overall the service was phenomenal. You will want for nothing.

TIP: Open to AmEx members only. One-day passes are $50, or complimentary for Platinum members. Thank you, travel buddy!

Sadly Al's Beef is gone but Fired Pie is a nice addition to the Northsight neighborhood!  

I came here today for a late lunch. There were no cars parked in front and the inside was cavernously and deserted. Fired Pie I've learned believes their market is providing "a fast, casual and customizable options for your pizza or salad desires. We use local brews, organic foods, cognizant of sustainability and the ..."  Yeah, yeah but do they make a good pie?  In a word, yes. 

This, in some ways, is the pizza world's answer to Jimmy Johns. In essences, "Pizza so Fast you'll Freak!"  LOL  They cook their pies in a wood fired 700 F degree oven, so they're done in less than four minutes. Nice!

The crust is ultra thin and the toppings are very good (see photos). I'm not sure if one individual 10" pie will satisfy you if you have a hardy appetite. But I thought it was very good and filling.  

I had the Tomato & Basil, which has the look of a Margherita pizza, but Fired Pie adds garlic and several types of cheeses for a nice taste.  

The cost was a fair $7.75 (not including tax) and seems like a good alternative to the sandwich/subs guys over near the 101 and Pima.  Specialty pizzas are $2.00 extra. 

So Three and half Stars+, A-Okay!

***update***
Our original posting was deleted by Yelp. Now this posting went from being "recommended" to currently hidden at the bottom of the "not recommended" reviews... So far, 21 users thought it was useful. Why are you hiding my review, Yelp? Could it be because I gave a NEGATIVE review based on my OWN experience? So much for being able to trust your site for unbiased reviews.
*********

Our previous review was deleted by Yelp for "violating their guidelines" so I'll post another review that only relates to our personal experience with their boarding facility.

We used Green Acre Boarding in Oct of 2013 for a 3 night stay. This place was presented as a great place for dogs... Free roam and lots of kids to play with your pups.  

This seemed like a great scenario for our 1yr old golden but our 11 year old sheltie just needed a safe place to stay. When I dropped our dogs off, I told MaLeisa that our sheltie didn't enjoy playing with other dogs (she would run away from her own loving, gentle, golden retriever brother at home) and that she just needed a quiet place to rest & observe during her stay. I was assured by MaLeisa they could accommodate that and that she would be fine.

Upon picking up our dogs we were told by MaLeisa that our sheltie "was playing in the yard with another dog and having a great time and next thing she knew, Todd was carrying her in because she had blood on her." Our dog had blood oozing from her ear, cuts across her face, was dry heaving and could barely walk. (And, "they had already washed her.") Our Sheltie collapsed in exhaustion once we got her into our vehicle. Unfortunately, our sweet girl had to be put down the following week as she never fully recovered from her injuries. 

Green Acres makes you sign a contract saying your dog will be dehydrated and exhausted upon returning home but that these are all normal results of a boarding experience. Add to that your dog will reek (which was explained away as being from the flood irrigation they use.) 

We had already pre-booked another stay at Green Acre for later in the month but obviously cancelled that stay after the injuries to our sheltie. I'm sickened and sad that I ever entrusted my dogs to the care of Green Acre.

I appreciate French food and like it more than I should. 

I also love NOLA and their Laissez les bons temps roulern!

But, the French Grocery is really not a grocery store at all. You cannot buy any grocery items, like you might find in a typical Champion or Carrefour. No Carte Noire coffee, no Maille moutardes, et cetera

They also do not cook, nor serve food here.  Everything is pre-made, wrapped for sale and kept in a refrigeration case. The only exception is the bakery items and a small chilled salad deli case. 

When we arrived on Friday just before five, there were also very few items left in the refrigerator. There was no croissants, no french bread or much of anything in the bakery case except for some small $1.75 cookies.

There were a couple of small individual Quiche Lorraines (which didn't contain any bacon or ham) and a few small baguette sandwiches, like you would find in Gare du Nord. 

The French Bakery also has a wine section, along with a few French press coffee pots. As others have noted, the lighting is poor and makes the store feel dreary. There are a few tables scattered in this cavernous store. But I am unsure what they are used for since you cannot sit and eat any of the chilled items. 

I believe the French Grocery is set up to appeal to working couples on the go --who want something more interesting than the Take Out selection of Fresh & Easy.  Of the six items we ordered, the best was the chocolate Pot de Creme for $3.50. Our total including tax came to $32.11

But if you come to the French Grocery thinking of Le Pain Quotidien, Le Madeleine, or even local Amuse Bouche (Surprise), you might leave disappointed.   Sorry!

When in Rome, eat pizza.

If you're in Buffalo, NY, you must have wings.

West Tropicana and Jones Blvd??  Chicken fried steak.  

I'll call it CFS from here on out but "Chicken from Satan" might be a better acronym.

It's rare that I get out of bed early enough on a Sunday to check out any of the dizzying array of excellent brunches around Vegas.  So when my first 2 planned spots went to hell, I chose to eat my feelings at the Black Bear Diner.  Anyone that works here will tell you that CFS is the most popular dish.  They were coming out of the kitchen and into the packed dining area like an assembly line.

Beef that is breaded and deep fried like chicken is kind of a mind blowing thing for non-Americans.  I had to repeat how my entre was being prepared to my Japanese wife twice.  It was a lot to wrap her head around and it should!!  According to BlackBearDiner.com, the CFS with hash browns, gigantic biscuit and 2 eggs totals 1580 total calories, 70 grams of fat, 20 grams of saturated fat, 4870 mg of sodium and 170 grams of carbs.  Holy....fucking.....shit.  This is the exact opposite of Crossfit.  CrossFAT!!

Funny how "comfort food" always makes me feel like death at the end.  Good thing the urgent care center across the street stays open late.

One of the great things about living in the southwest, is how all the food traditions have followed us here. 

Want a Philly Cheesesteak? Forgetaboutit!  New Yawk deli? We've got dat too!  A Chicago dog? Abs-so-freakin-lootely! LOL  How about that Aaron Rogers and George Wendt commercial?  Grill Class, I love it!  

It seems Chicago style, Vienna Beef places are all over greater Phoenix. What you don't see too often, are these family owned places. In Chicago you have Mom and Pop places all over. Each one trying to create their own piece of heaven for their loyal customers. 

Well I believe Dazzo's is one of those places too. You come in, you are greeted by one of the Dazzo family members. Warmly! None of that phony baloney stuff. Just, "thanks for coming in!  First time here?  Where are you from?"  They also have family pictures all over the wall, going back to when they first opened. Nice! 

And if UR interested, they also have a nice collection Chicago team Sun Times clippings, mostly of the Bulls and Cubs stuff. 

Okay, this is all great Georgie, but what makes it so special?  Well, the food!  Grilled Jumbo Dogs, Red Hots, Fire Dogs, Brats, Italian Beef -- they have them all and they're cooked fresh, just for you. Delicious!

Another plus are their French fries. They're exquisite and topped with a nice mixture of seasoning salt. I'm not a big fries guy, but I might come back for some more of them. 

But when I do come back, I'll bring more Cash because they don't accept Plastic. 

Enjoy!

I have never written a review, but I feel compelled to write one for the Marquee. From my experience, the Marquee staff is clearly racist against black people, and therefore regardless of everything else deserve the lowest rating possible.

I got a table with bottle service for my little brother's 21st birthday. Our group had 7 people. When the staff came to escort us to our table, they let the 5 people that were not black in, and then stopped the two black guys and asked them if they are with us. The guys were clearly with our group.

Then we show ID's. The girl checking ID's checks everyone's ID, and then when it gets to one of the black guys, checks the ID for a good 15 minutes, while the rest of us wait, on the other side of the ID check. They bring an extra person to check this clearly valid driver's license from Florida, while they harass us for waiting for our friends to get in to be escorted to our table.

After that we got into the club, and by the end of the night, both of the black guys were kicked out of the club, with an 'X' marked in permanent marker on their wrists so they can't get back in.  While I did not see what happened, I know everyone in that group. They are long time friends of my little brother's and they are some of the coolest, nicest people I know. They are not the kind of people that cause trouble in clubs.

It is inconceivable to me that this was a series of unfortunate mistakes or coincidences. My friends were kicked out for being black and not dressing "white" enough. I expect we would have had less problems if they put on a white button-up shirt, suite and tie and tried to look extra friendly and smile extra big for the racist Marquee staff. I think the Marquee staff saw two black males and assumed they would cause trouble, so they gave them as much trouble as they could and ultimately kicked them out.

This was our experience and we had bottle service. One can only imagine how the staff must treat black males they determine are "too black" that just want to come in and have a good time. I'll never go to this club again.

I moved from a condo to a house 6 streets away but wanted to use movers to move the heavy furniture. I found the glowing reviews on Yelp and decided to give them a try.

I called to schedule my move in date 5 days before my move and they were able to accomodate. The representative on the phone was very nice and knowledgable, explaining everything about the process and an estimated cost based on the size of my condo and number of furniture.

They called a couple days before the move to affirm the date and time, and then the movers called an hour before the scheduled time to let me know their arrival time. The movers were all very professional, very nice, and very attentive. Any items they weren't unsure about where to place it, they asked before moving it in. They also moved a couple pieces of furniture around since I wasn't completely sure where I wanted everything to go.

Finally, I decided that morning that I wanted to switch out the washer and dryer between the condo and the house. Without hesitation, they said they'd be happy to do that, so they swapped them out and hooked them up in the two places without any complaints.

Given that I was only having them move my furniture and I moved all my "stuff" myself, I did think it took them quite a while to move everything, but that's because they wrapped all pieces of furniture in plastic wrap before loading them on the truck and were very careful with all my furntiure. I had an antique large bookcase that they successfuly moved without any wear or tear.

If you're looking for a cheap and quick place to move your stuff, this is not the company for you. But if you have good quality furniture that needs gentle care in moving between two locations, I would definitely recommend them.

They say good things come in small packages. Well this has to be the smallest Peter Piper that I've been to yet. 

What I really like about this place is that they actually have pizzas lined up and ready to eat.  A fair share of Triple P's aren't ready for the 11:30 lunch crowd and hardly have any pizzas available. I chalk that up to poor management. They're usually too busy making pizzas for the carry out crowd instead of the dining room. This place is the exception and seems to be managed correctly.

Another thing that is very cool about this location is that they give you one of those flashing buzzers when your customized pizza is ready to go. So you don't look like an ass when you're cutting in line to get your special order. I hate when I order a pizza and it's half way eaten by the time I get up there.

As far the taste, of course Peter Piper is an average tasting product but it's a cheap lunch. The only thing is that this place can get pretty crowed since it has a relatively small dining room. But they do have plenty of parking.

In 24 hours...

You are committed to getting your dinner, midnight snack, breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, pre-dinner and dinner again.  Well, that was my original plan when I first heard about this deal but here's what really happened...

8:11pm dinner - Caesars Palace's Bacchanal Buffet.  This is the hottest spot in town for buffets right now.  If you decide to dine here, there is a supplemental charge of $15 on top of what you already paid.  And it's for each time you decide to dine here within 24 hours. (Retail value $49.99)

9:30am breakfast - Paris Le Village Buffet.  Such a darling place to dine at. (Retail value $20.99)

3:30pm lunch - Flamingo Paradise Garden Buffet.  All the grannies and pappies dine here.  I believe they are locals.  But they have an amazing desert spread and the food was not too shabby. (Retail value $19.99)

6:15pm dinner - Planet Hollywood The Spice Market Buffet.  We were still full from lunch but forced ourselves to sit and eat more crab and nibbled on everything else.  Since this was our last buffet stop, I made sure I enjoyed as much crab as I could squeeze into my already bloated belly. (Retail value $29.99)

Did I get enough to eat?  Yes
Did I get my money's worth?  You bet I did
Was the supplemental charge at Caesars worth it?  Yes, it was
Would I do this again?  Hell no!

We planned our entire day around making it to these buffets and it added in some unnecessary stress.  I did it, I loved it, I won't be doing it again.  But for those of you who love to eat buffets, then this is seriously the best deal in town.  Go for it.

Cost savings analysis!
Paid $49.99 + $15 = $65
Retail value $49.99 + $20.99 + $19.99 + $29.99 = $120.96
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAVINGS!!!!  $55.96 

OR

$65/4 meals = $16.25 for each buffet (winning!)

Just don't throw up afterwards, then you'll really get your values worth :)

Probably the best Pad See Ew I've ever had, but let's start from the beginning...

Immediately upon walking in, I was given... bar none... the most hospitable reception in my short history of dining.  It was comprised of a greeting (including being called by name) and a hug from the cutest little thing, who I had just met.

We started off with a chicken satay app, which was accompanied by a creamy peanut sauce and cucumber salad.  Removing the delicious skewered meat from the wooden spears brought me back to days of yore, when I would covertly poke my little sister in the closest appendage, with the sole purpose of evoking a squeal, all the while under the auspices of my no-nonsense parents.

My go-to Thai dish is Pad See Ew.  I've seen it spelled differently, but I'm hip.  This dish was one to be savored.... no, to be fawned over and then savored.  Using my meticulous chop-stick skills, I pampered each delicate noodle into my quivering mouth... which evoked blissful visions of lazily floating down the Chao Phraya river... and mind you, I've never even been to Thailand.

I'm not saying the dish was laced with opium, but at some point, I do recall fancying a ride atop an Asian Elephant passing through the seven levels of the Candy Cane forest.

My lunch companion, Chris, ordered the basil fried rice, which was more akin to an architectural wonder than an entree.  Using his meticulous spoon skills, I witnessed him moving mountains... of succulent rice and fixins... never to be seen again, for at least eight hours.

And just when I thought our culinary journey was disembarking, the same vision of loveliness appeared to my right, presenting a showpiece comprised of cake, cream and maraschino cherry.

Knowing my chop-sticks would only make a mess of things, I grabbed a spoon.  It had been so long... but it felt good in my hand.  A little cold.  I raised that utensil to the sky, and with an intense bellow, I cried "By the power of GreySkull, I shall have you as my own".  As I started my initial swipe, I noticed Chris had already gotten 2 or 3 bites in during the fanfare.

BAM!  The cake was bursting with coconut gusto, or maybe it was the ice cream.  I'm embarrassed to think of what I probably looked like as I descended into that dessert feeding frenzy.

I'd like to offer apologies to any staff and/or patron within line of sight.  I don't get out much, and unfortunately whenever my taste buds are stirred up like that, its plain and simple mob mentality.  I cant get in their way!  I wont!

After paying the tab, I bid a fond adieu to the huddled kitchen crew, and noticed their horror stricken faces.  The audible syllables "Mujumbo hielan friacah" lilted through the air as I passed... which I believe meant: "Great manly warrior"... no, my bad, wrong dialect... it actually means: "Portly destroyer with awkward shirt cleavage".

I look forward to my return visit, where I will exercise self control... or maybe just exercise

Living up to the hype.  A warm and contemporary Italian American eatery that delivers great tastes with the energy that is Vegas.  

This is not an authentic taste of Italian regional specialties rather refined and prettied up versions of Italian American favorites.  All good, it works.

The majority of the menu centers around small plates of antipasti shared family style.  Flavors are very complimentary so ordering a wide variety of dishes works.  An incredible simple grilled broccoli rabe natural bitterness is enhanced by hints of char and smoke but brought to life by a spicy, chili vinaigrette.  Sweet peppers stuffed with a tangy goat cheese and peppery olive oil create a very well balanced dish exploding with freshness.

For seafood antipasti, do not pass on the lobster arancini.  Dressed with a spicy pomodoro of Calabria chili and a touch of a herbaceous basil aioli that elevates the sweetness of the lobster.  Slightly cloying mouth feel but great flavors.  

Great selection of well made salumi.  Try a variety.  The Bresaola and finocchiona as good as any in Tuscany.  Add a selection of cheeses with perfectly paired condiments (Mozzarella with a citrus chili pesto,  Parmigiano with honey).  

Small selection of pastas.  The lobster ravioli excellent.  Perfectly cooked sheets of pasta surrounding chunks of barely cooked through lobster perfumed by tarragon.  Richness on richness but it works.

The only weakness of the restaurant are the mains.  A mustard, walnut, and raisin crusted rack of lamb, while perfectly cooked was one dimensional, needing more herbaceous, lemony gremolata.  A bone in "Tuscan" rib-eye topped with a sunny side up egg did not make sense.   The yolk did nothing to elevate the flavor of the beef rather giving it an unpleasant yolky aftertaste as it cooled.

Service is a work in progress.  Slow and lacking confidence.  This will definitely improve with time.

Decent wine list at Vegas resort prices.

Guys, admit it, Giada turned you on to cooking shows.  Now the chance is here to try the food you know you never cooked.  Worthy.

Sprinkles is at The Linq (between the Flamingo and the Quad). Cupcakes are $3.75 each and an additional 50 cents if you want it in a box instead of a wax bag. They have more than one door. The left is cupcakes only while the right side is both cupcakes and ice cream. They have prices and flavors posted and only offer certain flavors on different days of the week. You can check their website or download the Sprinkles app to find out what flavors they have that day. 

I just went to the cupcake side on this visit, but plan on trying the ice cream in the future.  I ordered a "Doggie Cupcake" priced at $2.50 that is sugar-free and has a yogurt frosting. It had a cute little orange bone on top. My dog, Brownie loved it! She licked the top off first and then ate the rest. I had a "Lemon Meringue" that was very good. The lemon cake had graham cracker lining and delicious tasting lemon curd in the middle. The top had toasted marshmallow that was good, but had a chewy outer layer that was tough to eat, so that was all that was left of the cupcake I didn't finish. They have tables and chairs outside of the store. As I was sitting there eating my cupcake, Candace Nelson the founder of Sprinkles came outside to greet customers. She was very sweet and signed autographs and took pictures with people, including myself! They have a decent amount of tables and chairs outside, but they were pretty filled up and the inside of the store was busy yet the line moved along smoothly. 

There is a cupcake ATM outside (near the ice cream side) on the patio and it's open 24 hours. The cupcakes are still $3.75 each, but come boxed so you have to pay the extra 50 cents. Hubby had a strawberry cupcake that I tried a bite of and liked, so I got one of those from the cupcake ATM to see how it worked. The ATM is user friendly and the screen allows you to see your cupcake coming to you from inside the store to when the door lifts open on the ATM revealing a pink box. I thought it was cool and even though the store is open late, it is neat knowing you can get a Sprinkles cupcake at any hour. 

Hours:
Sunday - Wednesday 10 am to 12 am
Thursday - Saturday 10 am to 1 am

Finally a solid option in my neck of the woods. I've never been to a Barro's Pizza until a few weeks ago when they opened up one a couple of miles from my house.

They have a spacious dining room with a self serve soda machine, including Diet Dr. Pepper, and one flat screen TV in one corner of the room. They might want to consider getting another TV. You order at the cashier and they bring your food to you. My wife and I go here when we don't feel like cooking.

Major kudos to Barro's Pizza for not price gouging on pasta like a lot of places. Seriously, I've been to casual restaurants that want to charge $10-$12 dollars for penne with meatballs. At Barro's, you can get a small plate for less than $4 dollars. And that's plenty to fill an adult up at lunch. I tried their Calzone for $8.95. It was okay, nothing to write home about. It included a couple of toppings. They certainly don't make the world's greatest pizza but it's decent and very economically priced. My wife loves the garlic bread, but it's a bit too garlicky for my taste. Note to management, start serving artichokes for pizza and don't chop those onions so small.

Most of the time my wife and I spend about $7-$12 dollars to eat here unless we order a pizza. They have sandwiches which I haven't tried yet. I am eating my way thru their entire menu so I'll eventually try all their offerings.

WHAT? I can't hear you!
Grace? Died 30 years ago!
Good luck conversing.

I don't review many chains, but I am going to take a stab on this one.  Been meaning to check out a Yard House ever since Josh A's glowing endorsement on the Talk boards awhile back.  102 tap beers sounded right up my alley.  Didn't think I had ever been to one before, but it was pointed out to me that I was at one in San Diego in the Gaslamp Quarter a couple years ago.  Remember really having liked it.  Probably would have gone 4 or 5.  Low 3 on today's visit.

The music was blaring loud this evening.  I'm sorry, but Matchbox 20 was not meant to be played that loud.  They are not even that good as background music.  I thought the waitress was going to kiss my mother on the lips as she was leaning in so close to hear the order.  Do they really think people like the music that loud?  Most of the customers were either parents with kids or gray-haired snowbirds.  No one was rocking out to it. 

Had two Uinta Hop Notch's which I have never seen anywhere else before.  Quite tasty.  The menu is very extensive both on beer and food.  Got the Mediterranean flatbread as an appetizer.  It was not good.  No sauce whatsoever, just toppings on crust.  Would have also been much better if the tomatoes were sun dried.  Would not get it again.

The blackened swordfish tacos were pretty good.  Little light on the fish, but excellent flavor with a healthy dose of guacamole.  I would definitely get these again.  Also had a couple bites of the Vodka Shrimp Pasta.  Think I will get that the next time I go when they open at West End in St. Louis Park.  Hopefully, they will use the volume dial on the music more prudently.

LAS VEGAS RESTAURANT WEEK!!!

$20.00 3 course lunch!!!

I wanted to hit a bunch of places for LVRW, but i could only make it to this one plus dinner at Del Friscos. I read some previous reviews that this place used to be alot more high end, and made some changes to make this more of a tapas place with a bar. It definitely looked more price friendly and $20 for 3 courses was a steal!

I started off with a nice caesar salad, complete with a tiny anchovie and yummy fontina and brioche croutons http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=i2U5iJLxkTWXSHQAdivVNA

The shortrib sandwich was next http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=LcQPsvafLFyw9GLqWZMl9Q.
It was almost like a bahn mi. Bread was yum and shortrib was tasty. I enjoyed it better when i put some of the coleslaw into the sammie. 

Lastly was some tasty sorbets for dessert http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=rWJOt4nICtNbUqEqtZaIIQ

We also added an order of the Cuban Panini. I wished we had ordered the tuna tacos instead. The panini i think would have tasted better with some bacon in it. hahaha. The bread was a little too heavy. HOWEVER the FRIES were amazing!!! I think they were twice fried in duck fat or something, cuz i seriously started to break out after i ate some. But it was yummy!

Friday night and it's 4am.  You've been drinking with your friends since at least 9pm.  It's Scottsdale, so nothing is open and you've exhausted all the fun you can possibly have laughing at drunk idiots gobble down subs at The Philadelphia Sandwich Company (one of my favorite pastimes).  As you drive down Scottsdale Road you see Zorba's and flash back to your senior year of high school, when you and your friends would go into these places and giggle like the innocent little girls you used to be.  I decided it was high time I revisited this Old Town institution. 

Maybe it was the vodka, but I have never felt more comfortable and welcome in a sex shop before.  Usually I get that paranoid feeling that everyone is watching me and keeping tabs on the things that peek my interest.  

I asked the nice young gentleman behind the counter to give my friends and me a tour.  He let me ask stupid questions like:
-"What's your best seller?"  While holding the largest double dildo I have ever seen in my life.  Apparently Zorba's sells a lot of those, just is case you wanted to know.
-"How often do you clean these things and are you the one who has to do it?" In reference to the obvious jack-off rooms.  He kept saying something about no touching being allowed.  He showed me how the little window separating two private rooms will unfog when both rooms are occupied.  So, let that be a warning to you... unless you're into voyeurism I guess.  

He continued to indulge my inane questions so that I could get a good laugh.  Maybe he was bored and got some entertainment out of it too.  Thanks Zorba's for being such a good sport.  I hope you will be entertaining Scottsdale's youth for generations to come.

I don't write many updated reviews but I believe The Parking Spot deserves some Yelp love.

 I've been using this place for about 4 years and the service is consistently superior. There's covered parking so your car is not baking in the sun so you're less likely to come back with an unbearably hot interior. You get a USA TODAY paper when you enter the facility and a bottled water for each occupant of your car when you leave the facility. That water really hits "The Spot" after being subjected to the heat when you're coming back from a temperate climate. You can sign up for thespotclub which you can link your credit card for payment and keep track of the points you use which can be redeemed for free parking. In fact, I called the customer service people at their corporate headquarters because I changed my email address and couldn't get into the site online. For some reason my points were gone too. But they restored my 2,000 plus points within minutes. I guess they thought I was inactive since I hadn't been on the website in years.

All the shuttle drivers are friendly and take care of your luggage (commercial here, Please tip your drivers). They give you a card to remind you which parking space you parked at such as I211. They respond quickly at the terminal when you call and say you are ready for pick up. I usually fly out of terminal 3 so they pick you up at door number 5 on the North side. The vans are air conditioned, what more do you need.

Also, the people that are at the booths are excellent as well. When you call, they know how to answer your question properly. They direct you where to park and take care of your payments at the booth. The Parking spot advertises in the magazines in front of you on your airplane. So you can usually find a coupon for 20% off. I believe a 24 hour stay is $10.95 without coupon. Also, you can get three hours of parking by showing your AAA Card. So if you want to meet people inside the terminal and don't want to pay for airport parking this is what you do. And if you decide to park for more than 3 hours you can use your AAA Card for a 10% discount. They have another service where they'll wash your car by the time you get back. 

There's a Parking Spot 1 and a Parking Spot 2. This review is for Parking Spot 1 on Washington street.

Right now they are open Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays from 7 am - 12 pm. Admission is free if you are walking in, but $3 to drive in with your vehicle. There is parking right across from the entrance if you decide not to drive in. I grew up coming to this orchard for school field trips as well with family and friends. I love that this place is still here! The area is rich in history, which could take a whole review alone so, I recommend reading up on it sometime and maybe you will appreciate the area even more. They have such a huge orchard that depending on the time of season you come, you really need to dress accordingly especially if you plan on walking through. There is about 60 acres to explore. They have a stand at the entrance if you just want to grab some stuff already picked, or you can take your time exploring the orchard and pick what you like. They provide wagons for you to use.

When I visited yesterday they were offering the following:
Carrots - $1 per pound
Beets - $1 per pound
Cucumbers - $1 per pound
Green Tomatoes - $1 per pound
Apricots - $1 per pound
Squash - $1 per pound
Zucchini - $1 per pound
Peaches - $1 per pound
Honey - $7 for the honey bear and $20 for a quart
Garlic - $2 for 3 bulbs or $10 for 3 pounds
New Potatoes - $2 per bag
Onions - $1 each
Peanut Butter - $6 each
Almond Butter - $8 each 

I came specifically for a honey bear and some peanut butter. Both sell out fast and aren't always available. If you can get your hands on some, I recommend it! The honey is fresh and comes right from the orchard. The peanut butter us a huge hit in our house and doesn't last long. If you ever at the orchard when they are making fresh apple cider donuts you must try some! They are usually only a couple bucks and SO worth it! Sign up for their weekly newsletter and find out when they have available for harvest and what types of food items they might be cooking up.

El Dorado Cantina is one of my favorite new restaurants in town.  This definitely rivals Javier's at Aria for the "high end" Vegas Mexican cuisine market, but the prices are way more reasonable.  Chef Paco and his staff are churning out some really good stuff.  

Want a great way to spice up a weekday dinner?  How about doing as the Aztecs did back in the day (century) and start off with some grasshoppers?  Yes, sir!  EDC's "chapulines" can be prepared sauted either in garlic lime or habanero.  For the uninitiated, the closest thing to compare them to would be crispy shrimp tails but juicier.  The habanero order offered terrific heat and not in a painful, shoot me in the face kind of way.  At $7.50, it was a large portion that could have easily satisfied a party of six.  Not for everyone by any means, my wife was literally one and done, but I enjoyed it and had plenty to take home (fried rice, anyone?).

"Imperial Shrimp" was everything I look for in an appetizer: seafood stuffed Pacific wild shrimp wrapped in bacon and then lightly fried. The creamy heat (sounds gross, right?) from the chipotle ranch dressing that accompanied the dish was awesome.  More things in life should be wrapped in bacon!  I should start a national campaign.

We chose to split the humungous carne asada entre.  The citrus marinated steak was medium rare perfection.  I loved the big slabs of grilled cactus that it came with.  We probably boxed up 70 percent of the plate.  Goddamn nachos and salsa....

You'd think that would prevent us from ordering dessert, but the flan and tres leches cake somehow made it to the table.  The latter was plated nicely and the rum flavor made me feel like I was on vacation.  It was a great end to the meal and I can't wait to try more.

It's hard to believe the 5-diamond, all-suite Venetian Hotel rose from the dust of the Sands way back in 1999. The opulent Casino, famous Grand Canal Shoppes, 24-hour Race & Sports Book, and large Suite Hotel Rooms (with sunken living room and Italian-marble baths) are just a few reasons the Venetian still reigns as a spectacular destination for an unforgettable Las Vegas vacation.

Of course, the Venetian is inspired by Venice, Italy (sorry, California). Several detailed replicas of landmarks from Europe's most beautiful city include Piazza San Marco (St. Mark's Square) with Campanile di San Marco (St. Mark's Campanile Bell Tower) and columns for the Lion of Venice and Saint Theodore. Other notable reproductions are Palazzo Ducale (Doge's Palace), Ponte di Rialto (Rialto Bridge), and Ponte dei Sospiri (Bridge of Sighs). 

Here are your best bets for a good time at the Venetian:

Rooms
 * There are more than 4,000 suites at the Venetian
 * Luxury Suites with King bed are standard & 650 sq ft
 * A 700 sq ft Bella Suite has 2 Queens for about $30 more
 * For either, about $40 upgrades to a Suite with a View
 * A Venetian Piazza Suite is 1400 sq. ft and only $150 above Luxury
 * Another $50 can get you a Venetian Prima Suite (1500 sq ft)
 * Rates get high for larger Renaissance & Penthouse Suites
 * An In-Suite Breakfast offer is available, but not my style
 * The Venezia Tower is newer, but may not be for everyone
 * Book online & check discount packages for the best deals
 * Daily resort fee: $25 + tax ($3): Fitness Center, Internet, & 1 coffee

Dining
 * 15 Fine Dining ($$$$) restaurants are tempting
 * Recommend CUT, Bouchon, Delmonico, AquaKnox, or SUSHISAMBA

 * Lipshtick rotates female stand-up comedians ($75-$120)
 * Human Nature has Australians singing Motown ($74-$118)
 * Get married (if you must) at one of their Wedding locations
 * The DaVinci Exhibit was a waste of $27.50 to see replicas
 * Canyon Ranch SpaClub isn't cheap, but you're on vacation
 * Semi-romantic types can ride a gondola indoors and out

Shopping
 * Grand Canal Shoppes has shops along an indoor canal
 * The stores are open 10am - 11pm (midnight on Fri/Sat)
 * More than 160 stores with mall favorites, boutiques, & high-end
 * Louboutin, Burberry, Ferragamo, & Fendi are highlights
 * Some will like Jimmy Choo, Coach, DvF, or Michael Kors
 * It'Sugar is always sweet

Parking & Location
 * Near the North end of the Vegas Strip by its sister, The Palazzo
 * Across from the Mirage and Treasure Island
 * Free parking is in an 11-story parking garage
 * Follow signs from main Venetian entrance
 * Valet is easier sometimes if you don't mind waiting & hate walking

The Venetian Resort Hotel and Casino is a truly remarkable Vegas Strip hotel offering upscale value and amenities for reasonable prices. It should be one of the first places you check for reservations before any trip to Las Vegas.

BurGR is definitely a fun place.

I'm not a big fan of GR's TV persona or schtick.  Though there is something positive to be said about his mercurial nature and focus on detail.  So, given our short eleven hours in Vegas, we decided to come here.

At the heart of BurGR, you'll find some good food and I believe GR poking fun at himself.  The restaurant has several photos, as does the menu, of him hands up in a fit of mock anger.  I believe, there's a wee sparkle and impishness in those eyes.

So, what about the food you say?

It's good!  Very good in fact.  And, those BurGRs are worth every penny of the $14.00 to $17.00 you'll pay to enjoy them.

The reason isn't too hard to understand.  Given that mercurial nature, GR chose to cook the food: "Paying special attention to not only the ingredients but the method, beef patties will be cooked over an open flame fueled by hard woods."  

So it isn't too difficult to see why they have a complex smokey taste, that layers nicely with the various toppings and ingredients. 

We had the American and Euro BurGRs.  The Euro (photo) came with truffle aioli, goat cheese and arugula, while the American came with american cheese, butter lettuce, tomato, pickles and red onion.  Both were delicious, though the Euro was more interesting on the palate.  GR's focus to detail even shows up on the selection of the bun. Nice!

Another WOW if you will, were the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Seems the BurGR fries are "hand-cut and thrice cooking will ensure extra crispness" and they use Kennebec instead of Russet potatoes  which "offering a lighter, less starchy and crisper fry"  

Okay, we agree.  But what makes them special, is the hair like shavings of parmesan cheese (photo) with a special aioli oil sauce for dipping. Ohh, are they good.

So, with a glass of wine, a nice pint of Leinenkugel on tap, a couple of BurGRs and some of those wonderful Truffle Fries, expect to pay around $27.50 each, not including gratuities or taxes.

Enjoy!

Lo-Lo's is a nice experience in southern cooking without leaving Phoenix. You can see why everyone raves about the place.

Three of us came here for breakfast last week and really enjoyed ourselves.  The only drawback was that we arrived at 8:15am. Yelp had the opening listed incorrectly as 7 am.  Lo-Lo's  OPENS AT 9 AM! I have posted a updated photo, with the correct times from the front door.

We ordered two coffees and a iced "fruit punch" Kool-Aid for $3.00 each to start. I had the #8 Betty Boop for $8.00. It comes with one piece of southern fried chicken breast, along with a plate covering waffle. It wasn't bad, but mine was a little mushy and didn't stand up well to the syrup. 

As for the chicken, I regret that it was somewhat dry and not juicy. The smashed sides of two sausage paddies for $2.00 was great and it had a nice flavor.  I would come back just for the smashed sausages and Kool-Aid anytime!

My two friends ordered the #14 CJ's, which is one waffle, one egg, and a small bowl of grits for only $6.00 (a steal); and the #11 Kimbo for $7.00, which is two giant waffles. My friend reported that his waffles were cooked longer and they looked golden brown. 

Spending some time in the south, I really miss having Grits. Oatmeal is not the same thing. The Grits at Lo-Lo's are very good. If you have never tried them before, Lo-Lo's would be a good introduction. But skip the cheese on top. The best I've ever enjoyed came with small pieces of bacon in it. Yum! Now, which way is the Mayo Clinic? LOL

Our bill for three including taxes, but before gratuities ran us $34.86. Overall the food and service was very good. I would say Three and Half Stars good, rounding up to Four.

Vdara is a winner! It has a ton to offer without having to spend a ton of money for it. During CES/AVN weekend, I was able to book 2 nights here for $169/night, which was the best value on the Strip for that weekend. The City Center hotel is just over a year old, so the rooms are really nicely appointed with modern amenities. Although there is no casino and not much in terms of dining options, it's conveniently located next to The Cosmopolitan, Aria and Bellagio, so it's just a short walk to some of the best gambling, clubs and restaurants in Vegas. An additional upside is that the hotel is clean and smells really nice when you walk through the lobby because no smoking is allowed and they pump this lovely scent through their vents. I wish my house smelled like that. 

My BFF and I enjoyed our suite; bed was super comfy, bathroom was really nice and stocked with Aveda products, and there was a mini kitchenette, great for heating up leftovers at 4am. Our other friends stayed in a similar sized king room that had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains so we got a great view of the water show at night. But the rest of our friends had the best suite of all: the 1,447 square foot 2-story penthouse suite with two bedrooms, 2.5 baths, living room and fully equipped gourmet kitchen. There were 6 people staying here, and at $600/night, it was such a steal. Like I said, you can feel like a big baller without breaking the bank here. Unfortunately, their check-in process was a bit of a nightmare as the suite was not ready at 3pm, but they did give them spa credits.

I'd definitely consider staying here again, especially since it's just a hop, jump and a skip away (ok, maybe a painfully long walk if you've been dancing in stilettos all night) to The Cosmo, my new favorite casino resort.

Surreal pool party experience. Vegas does it unlike anywhere else, and Wet Republic is no exception when it comes to getting WET!

So you know what you're getting into:

1) Getting tickets in advance substantially cuts down waiting time.
2) Arriving early (before 1pm) does the same.
3) Cabanas cost $1,500.
4) There are lockers available to stow your stuff.
5) The bar sells drinks in enormous lidded cups. Get these and you won't regret it when the splashing starts! Unless you like chlorine as part of your alcoholic mix.
6) It is calm and beautiful when you arrive early and hardly anyone is there. It gets increasingly more chaotic and cramped up through peak pool time (~3pm).

* * * Now, so you know what you're REALLY getting into: * * *

Be prepared for a poppin' party. And when I say poppin', I mean POPPIN'. Super crowded, off the chain, dope beats, crazy splashing. Beach balls are constantly flying, some that may come your way and bonk you on the head while you are distracted, completely unaware. Good thing they're only beach balls! Then the huge inflated whales start coming out. These are much heavier than the beach balls and have more of an impact on your head. But everyone is too busy dancing and having fun to care. NOTE: You can't ride the whales. You can try, but it's impossible.

By the time the headliner DJ (Steve Aoki) takes over, it becomes so rowdy both outside and inside the pool. Outside the pool, a large crowd is clamoring up by the DJ booth. Aoki sprays the crowd with champagne and even throws a large cake with white frosting at them. He is carried overhead by the crowd. Rafts and inflatable animals (flamingos, ducks, and monkeys) are deployed. It's a hot, hot mess on land!

In the pool there is so much splashing that tidal waves are straight up rolling. One guy was so ecstatic to be in the pool that as he thrashed around, he brought his hand down (with his phone) hard onto my forearm. Thanks for the enormous bruise! Of course I didn't feel it until the next morning, probably because of the booze and adrenaline. Before I know it, 4 hours have passed and the drinks and music are still flowing. Wet Republic sure knows how to make it last!

TIP: Be ready to party. Go hard or go home!

DATE TIP: You can most certainly find a date here. Enormous margaritas + dancing in the water + people in swimsuits? Oh yeah, no doubt.

I know, I know, this is a brand new steakhouse in Vegas and I probably committed every faux pas in the book by ordering the fish. But I did it. And I don't regret it for a minute.

FOOD:
---------
As our group asked for my opinion on appetizers, I knew I had to select the **Smoked Pork Terrine** because it offered the sublime foie gras, of which I have been deprived for ages, being a Californian and all. Combined with delicious pickled figs and pepper jelly atop a piece of bread, this appetizer was everything I wanted and more.

I was a little worried that choosing the **Roasted Market Fish** would be a total mistake, but it was delicious! It turned out to be Sea Bass with a tomato paste and zucchini relish. The bass was prepared perfectly, being sufficiently firm while also smoothly melting in the mouth. This would rival any bass from an acclaimed seafood restaurant. I sampled a piece of Anna's **Porterhouse** and it was divine. I would definitely order it on my next visit.

For side dishes we got the roasted mushrooms, asparagus, creamless sweet creamed corn. We all thought the asparagus could have used some more flavoring or some sort of creative twist, but the corn was a huge hit with its buttery smoothness.

SERVICE / AMBIANCE:
-------------------------------
Absolutely outstanding. Every member of the staff we encountered was on point, very warm and helpful, and extremely professional. Our server had an entertaining sense of humor. Even the busser impressed us with his refined gestures.

The decor is mod and clean with beautiful wood accents everywhere. The open kitchen in the back is a nice touch.

Of course you get what you pay for, so be ready to lay down some cash. For four people (3 steaks, 1 fish, 3 sides, 4 drinks), we each fronted about $100.

DATE TIP: With swankified dining at its best,
How could your date not be impressed?

A lifesaver during my last Vegas trip. My first mistake: assuming everything there would be fattening and unhealthy like every other crepe place. But wait! They have fresh cleansing juices. Oh my! I've never been into juicing but this place changed my mind for sure. 

Have you ever become FITTER during a Vegas trip?!? Well, it happened to me. I was very pleased with the surprising results. How did it happen?

All hail the **Detoxifyer**! Densely packed with kale, celery, apple, beet, ginger, and lemon, the juice is delicious compared to many of the healthy concoctions out there. Of course it can't compare to a sugary juice, but it does soooo much more.

I had arrived in Vegas knowing I would be attending a pool party at Wet Republic after 4 days of eating terribly. There were no vegetables or good salad options anywhere around. So I had a feeling I'd gain weight by the time I had to don a bikini. But hey! Detoxifyer to the rescue! One juice once a day for 3 days was enough to do the trick. On the 4th day I put on my swimsuit and was actually impressed. I couldn't believe it.

If you need something more substantial to eat (I did), try **The Fitness** crepe and add Alfredo chicken to the mushroom spinachy mozzarella goodness. I split one of these with with my friend and also had the Detoxifyer.

The only thing I'd change about this place is the system to indicate when orders are ready. They have to shout the order number out and then people come up and take items without having to show a receipt. Maybe a more automated system that shows a number and patrons have to show proof of purchase. My order was stolen twice! Granted the MGM Grand was overrun by about 15,000 people from my company's convention. But still, such a system would help even on a daily basis.

Overall I love Blizz for introducing healthy juice options to me. Thank you to the clerks for the recommendation! And special thanks to the Detoxifyer! You've really opened my eyes.

DATE TIP: The Detoxifyer will definitely get you ready for your next hot Vegas date. 

TIP: [[[ T.M.I. Alert ]]] Remember that what you put in must also come out. You may have to use the restroom slightly more often than before, and things may look the same color as when you consumed them. The Detoxifyer is a vivid pomegranate color. Haha, I told you it was TMI. You've been warned!

I finally made it over to Pink Box Doughnuts to see what everyone has been raving about. I will say one thing, you cannot compare Pink Box to places like Dunkin' Donuts or Winchell's because they are simply different. After having Pink Box, I can't see ever going to one of those chains again when I can go to a locally owned shop and taste the love in each bite. These doughnuts are made from scratch daily.

They have the doughnuts broken down into 3 different types: classic, specialty and gourmet. The classic such as "Glazed" or "Buttermilk" are $1 each. The specialty doughnuts like the "Bavarian Creme" are $1.25 each and gourmet favorites like the "Fat Elvis" or "Date With A Nutty Pig" are $1.75 each. They have half and full dozen boxes (pink of course!) with prices ranging from $8.50 - $12.50 for those.

I saw on Facebook they were now selling "Cronuts" so of course I asked about those. They were sold out! I spoke with Lance behind the counter who said they had made Cronuts 3 times that day already. I went just after 11 am so apparently people are scrambling to try them. Not having tried the original from NYC, how can I really compare it though? I guess I just want to taste it and get some sort of idea what it might be like. I will try again! Lance says you can just call ahead and if they have the menu item you are looking for then they will hold it for you. 

So I decided that I needed to try the "Fat Elvis" after hearing about it and I am kicking myself for not trying this sooner. DELICIOUS! It is just flat out good! The Fat Elvis is topped with chocolate icing & a caramelized banana, and filled with a homemade peanut butter & banana filling. This doughnut had me feeling stingy since I didn't want to share a single bite with hubby, but I had to darn it!

The 'Apple Fritter" needs some work. The texture is perfect. It is soft and chewy inside, and crunchy on the outside where it needs to be. The thing that gets me is why it's called an apple fritter if there are no apples in it? I didn't bite into a single apple! Boo-Hoo!

When I saw a Doughnut with fruit loops on it I had to give it a try. I was told by a worker that this was called the "Fruit Loop Doughnut" and I get the fun concept, but it just doesn't work. The long glazed doughnut is really good, but the fruit loops they put on top just absorb the glaze they rest on so they are soggy and chewy. 

Last and certainly not least is the "Cinnamon Tornado" and I have to tell you, it lives up to the name. When I took the first bite it was like a tornado of instant flavor, and it seriously melted inside my mouth. Very yummy.

There was a sign out front that said they are now open 24 hours on weekends.

Located way off the strip in an unassuming shopping center, you'd probably miss this restaurant if you blinked. Luckily, the stellar reviews made in part by my fellow Yelpers piqued my interest in finding this elusive favorite. Now locating the place is a challenge in itself but landing a reservation is equally exhausting!
As fate would have it, I landed a 9pm dining reservation. Woot! Little did I know, however, that a reservation merely meant when you arrived, you'd be relegated to waiting an additional 10-15minutes for your seat. 
That being said, I took the opportunity to park it at the sidebar to glance over the extensive menu while guzzling down a bottle of Asahi with shots of chilled nigori. 
Honestly, by the time I was seated, I was about three sheets to the wind! I know, I'm a cheap date.

Now onto the food shall we?

I went with the server's recommendations as well as my seasoned Yelp buddies' choices who've had successful dining experiences here previously...

Negitoro Blue Fin 35$ fresh and buttery slices of blue fin tuna with a cast of delectable condiments that left my taste buds doing a happy dance! Trust me, the experience is virtually umami x 10! 

Wagyu Sashimi 20$ - thinly sliced filets of premium rare wagyu beef with a hint of wasabi on top and accompanied with a special savory soy dipping sauce. The first bite was like velvet on my tongue and the mouthfeel was literally like butter melting in my mouth. Superb!

Agedashi tofu 7.50$ 1/2 order -a delightful dish with compelling flavors and an irresistibly soft texture that had me pining for more 

Butter sauted scallop 7$ x2 - my favorite dish of the evening. The butter poached scallops were soft and supple with an incredibly mouthwatering garlicky flavor and fluffy texture. Absolutely amazing!

Enoki Mushroom & Bacon 3$ x2 come on now, we know everything tastes better with bacon and this was no exception. Just order it and thank me later.

Chicken wrapped chicken skin 3x2 -tender chunks of chicken breast wrapped in succulent chicken skin. An indulgent  experience that is second to none 

Poached Egg with Sea Urchin & Salmon Roe full cast of delectable ingredients that left my taste buds in a tailspin of delight. Intriguing enjoyable and texturally fascinating! 

Other notable dishes included:
Kobe Garlic Skirt 7.50 x2
Kurobuta Pork Cheek 4.25$ x2
Foie gras egg custard 10
Duck in balsamic 4.50$ x2
Iberico Pork 10 x2
Nigori 40$ well worth it! IMO I bought 2 bottles :)

All in all, I had a great dining experience at Raku and it's safe to say I'd gladly return to enjoy their enticing small plates again and, of course, to imbibe in their spirits!

Happy Eats!

My family and friends have been getting together for a few years here to grub. That will be happening no longer. The last 3 visits were terrible and the last visit specifically was not good. I'm sad about this because I really loved the food before, but now it's just not consistent. On this last visit we were the only customers in the restaurant yet it still took over an hour to receive our food and the food came out staggered. My niece only wanted Egg Drop Soup and they totally forgot to bring it to her and only did so after asking a 3rd time about it. When she finally got her soup it was like a bowl of gloppy gel. I loved the soup here before, so I have no idea what has happened, but it wasn't even edible. What I loved ordering here most, Strawberry Chicken, tasted awful. One thing that wasn't easy to ignore was the nasty smell inside. It smelled so badly of like sewage or something. Then at the end of the meal we noticed roaches on the floor! OMG I was so ready to leave. Drinks come in cans and refills aren't free. After loving this place for so long it's a major disappointment to see New China Cuisine go so downhill.

Straight out of Cali and family owned. This location was originally built to be a Dunkin' Donuts, but DD never opened. I'm glad Tom's swooped in! You will find a variety of options on the menu here from burgers, tacos, burritos, sandwiches, bacon & eggs, pancakes, steak, pork chops,  fish & chips, salads, smoothies, and Mediterranean & Greek options, and believe it or not much more! They have some pretty good all day specials if you like breakfast.  Seniors 55+ get a free cup of coffee with any breakfast or lunch purchase.

Hubby and I decided to split the "Pastrami Sandwich Combo" priced at $9.59 plus 40 cents for cheese. The combo came with fries and a drink. I also wanted to try the "Zucchini" priced at $3.99 and it came with a side of ranch. The pastrami sandwich was SO good. The bread held up the sandwich well and the mustard and pickles were just right. I know this is something that I will for sure be back for. Good pastrami in Vegas is hard to come by. The fries were excellent. I wasn't actually crazy about the zucchini. The ranch that it came with was a decent size though. They make the onion rings and zucchini from scratch. I want to try the onion rings next time, but will pass on the zucchini again. 

They have a drive-thru if you don't want to eat inside. The burgers are made fresh to order and the steak and chicken is hand trimmed on site. There are a lot of things I want to try here at Tom's so I will be back!

Everything is pretty small and served like tapas, but somehow its surprisingly filling.  There were definite highs and lows to this meal, but I think there were a few dishes that excelled while only a few weren't quite what we had hoped for.

There was a big group of us so I managed to sample quite a big portion of the menu.

Highlights:

Carnitas tacos-served with guac, pork rinds, and a verde sauce!

Like water for Chocolate- fried quail served with dragonfruit and edible flowers.  

Chilaquilles- tortilla chips cooked in a pan with a salsa verde and cheese.  Kinda like nachos.

Mango "sticky rice"- this is something quite interesting.  The sticky rice part was made into a mousse and ripe mangoes.  I've never seen this before and it was really cool.  The "rice" element were like rice crispies on top.  

Chocolate "terrain"- Awesome chocolate mold of a Chinese soldier with a spicy chocolate mousse inside.  It was served with cookie crumbs to look like sand, and a ginger ice cream that was spicy and sweet all at the same time.

Things to skip:

Oceans Nest- fried noodles served with stirfried saucy seafood and veggies.  We ate all the lobster out of it and then left it there.  It was super bland.

Lamb potstickers- pretty presentation with the little edible flowers and everything but it was bland and looked more exciting than it tasted.

Overall, I thought the place had a whimsy to it that I thought was fun.  The ambiance was interesting and diverting, the waitress and wait staff were helpful and went out of their way to see to our requests.  While some of the food is a bit overpriced and small, I really enjoyed their desserts, there is something light hearted and comical about them.  They were the highlight of the meal.  If nothing else, come and have dessert and a laugh all at the same time.

"I must.  I must.  I must INCREASE MY BUST!"

And I squeeezed.  And I flexed.  And I waited.  And I waited...

18 I was (3 years ago...ok fine, 4...and then some), and the twin peaks were like small mounds.  The other girls were wearing big bountiful lacy things and I still hadn't outgrown my sports bra.  They had told me that I must do my exercises.  So exercise I did...religiously.  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3TZB3upHZY )  The only thing the Bust Song and dance ever accomplished was a deflated ego and an increase in my pectoral muscles.  When the realization came that I was gonna need a bro instead of a bra, ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfONNfAjyrc ) the insanity stopped.  Naive much?  Yes.

ENTER:  Gallagher's Steakhouse's beautifully dry aged, bright scarlet, marbled beef displayed in a sealed glass case for all passersby to admire.  It's like that gorgeous girl you had your eyes on but just wanted to look at, not really converse with.  Why?  Because she just didn't taste as good as she looked.  Wait.  I'm still talking about the cow.  Right.

The Signature New York Steak is dry aged for 21 days in order to allow the flavors to seep in.  Although somewhat flavorful, it's rather tough even when served medium rare.  Try it with the accompanied sauces ($3 each).  We liked the Brandied Peppercorn served in a gravy boat.  The peppercorn provides that perfect kick along with the brandy reduction.  

Although the restaurant advertises the signature steaks displayed in their case, it's really nothing more than a good marketing ploy.  The mystery of dry aged beef to be more wonderful in flavor is as appealing as ExtenZe for Men.  In the end, it's nothing more than a stiff wind.

The true star of the evening was the 18 oz Cowboy Ribeye.  Sure, it was bigger than my face, but I rode that cowboy like any good cowgirl would...right into the sunset.  Each bite exploded with flavor.  It was tender, robust, and served with crispy string onions which was the perfect accompaniment.  Service was very attentive and friendly, which earned them an extra star.  Overall, a decent steakhouse though a bit gimmicky.

When Suzanne Somers told me that I could have buns of steel, I took a beating with the Thigh Master.  When the Shake Weight promised to revolutionize the way I tone my arms and shoulders, I ended up looking like I was JACKING. SOMEONE. OFF.  Yes, I fall for gimmicks as much as the guy who bought that Snuggie to free his hands for the remote (as well as "other" activities - notably after popping his ExtenZe pill).  Gallagher's may not have really lived up to the hype, but its marketing genius keeps people like me coming in, in hopes that the product really will deliver.  Every now and then, it's good to keep the hope alive for us infomercial-suckers.

Perhaps one day, I will learn that The Clapper cannot clap off an idiot.

That my ChiaPet will not play fetch.

That I may not "increase my bust" by squeezing my arms across my chest...

But like my breastesses, these hopes and dreams, though late to bloom, would one day become reality...however small and humble.  You just gotta believe...preferably with a Visa or MasterCard ready in hand.

Spoon is easily one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. For fine dining, I put them in the top five.
Been here four or five times now just to make sure I was not dreaming. But for sure this is a solid four stars and edging on five. A few subtle enhancements could tip the scale to 5.
Dcor is nice and trendy with several seating areas including a great bar.  Service includes John the top sommelier in the area, usually two hostesses, well-mannered servers and great bartenders. Service is prompt and a drink order results in libations within 5 minutes along with a choice of waters. There is a very ample selection of cocktails and wines by the bottle or glass.
I should mention there is a prompt and courteous valet service as another notch up the service pyramid.
Next the wonderful bread basket with warm selections of biscuits, awesome cornbread and ciabatta or some other artesian bread with sugar or honey butter to complement. We usually need a second basket as a testament.
The short menu is a design to keep choices interesting but not drone on, the ingredients fresh, the food delicious and it changes often enough to keep regulars coming back.
Seafood is my favorite here in appetizer and entre, but the soups and salads are fresh and outstanding as well. A very well enjoyed appetizer choice from the other night we had the 'bacon and eggs' appetizer which was seared pork belly, 5 minute egg (just right) sauted spinach, and hollandaise. Also we had the crispy duck confit which was a fabulous set of ingredients of crispy duck, 3 grain salad, Indian spices, goat cheese, cucumber yogurt, and toasted almonds. Almost sounds like decadence and just about was.
Around the tale we had the shellfish pappardelle; Alaskan black cod; cassoulet which interestingly was comprised of roasted pork, chicken sausage, duck confit, braised cannellini + cranberry beans, herbed bread crumbs, and farm egg. This was 'dryer' version of cassoulet a French peasants, style stew.
We have tried many other appetizers and entrees on our other visits and they all were as wonderful as these I mention here. All had the same complexity of ingredients, preparations, with flavors all overwhelmingly pleasing to the senses.

Pizzeria Bianco isn't just a restaurant, it's an institution.  Ever since I moved to the Valley of the Sun five years ago, I've watched peoples' eyes glaze over as they ramble on and on about how amazing the food is there; many argue that it serves up the best pizza in Phoenix (if not the country).  Why it took me so long to get there is a mystery but after going today, I can unequivocally say that the rumors are all true - it is fabulous!

LOGISTICS: Nestled in the Southeast corner of Heritage Square near the Arizona Science Center, Pizzeria Bianco sits in a rather small brick building with an outdoor patio and charming little bar.  While the space restriction makes for a more intimate dining experience, I could easily see this place becoming swarmed with diners during peak hours; so perhaps coming before or after the main lunch/dinner rush would be a good idea for those who are patience-challenged or in a time crunch.  Park in the structure off of 5th and Monroe - the restaurant validates your ticket (I ended up paying $0 instead of the usual $12).  

FOOD: Wow!  Just wow!  I ordered the Market Salad, which consisted of fresh local cantaloupe and honeydew melon, cucumbers, mint, red onions, and peppers served in a yogurt dressing; it was hands-down one of the most creative and refreshing salads I've ever had!  They serve their sodas in old fashioned glass bottles and bring freshly-baked bread with olive oil to your table - haven't had olive oil that good in ages!  If you can't decide on one pizza combo, they're great about doing halfsies.  I ordered a half Margherita, half Rosa (red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, and Arizona pistachios) pizza - both were sheer perfection!  Crust is heavenly, ingredients are beyond fresh, innovative toppings - who'dve thunk pistachios would taste so good on a pizza?!      

SERVICE: Pizzeria Bianco runs like a well-oiled machine.  The service staff is amazing - both friendly and fast.  They greet every single guest who comes and goes - pretty impressive! 

I don't really think you can go wrong here.  I came in skeptical but left a believer; somehow they worked their magic over on me - another happy Pizzeria Bianco customer.  A thousand flies can't be wrong!  ;)

I've been by several times and loved everything I had each time. The employees are very courteous and make you feel like family when you are there. I like how affordable the menu is for the quality of food that you get. For $7.99 I got a "Smoked Brisket Sandwich" and for a few bucks more I made it a combo which included a side and a drink. I also added an additional side of "Cheezy Mac & Cheese" to my order. The brisket is smoked for 18 hours and is the best brisket I have had in town. The meat has such great flavor! When it comes to flavor the beans have it and like the brisket, the beans here are the best I've had in town. The macaroni and cheese was very good too. I'm not the type to eat meat off of the bone, but I did try a rib and I enjoyed every bite! So tender and flavorful! For dessert I had "Banana Pudding" priced at $3.99 and it was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. 

Inside is clean and smells like heaven. So does the parking lot where you can on most days see the man himself outside smoking up some of the tasty meats they offer here. If you want to eat at home they offer a variety of party packs. They will even come to your home and bring their own grills and smokers to cater your event. Call them to find out about the packages they have and pricing. I am going to definitely keep the catering in mind for the future!

Follow the yellow brick road to the emerald city and you'll find the golden lion! It's the first thing you see as you enter the main lobby.

This hotel is pretty grand, alright, at least in size. Being the largest hotel and casino in Las Vegas, maybe they feel they don't need to be the best in customer service. Granted, there were over 15,000 people from my company for a huge convention, but they should be equipped to handle as many guests as can fit in the hotel, right? They're just lucky the other 15,000 people went elsewhere.

Need to Spend $?
---------------------
Plenty of restaurants, touristy shops, and of course... massive casino space. Many vehicles for spending dolla bills! The food court gets wicked crowded so I tended to opt for **Blizz**, which is just around the corner and has some healthy juice options (see Blizz review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/blizz-las-vegas?hrid=9pL5NN9VJ-YEqvD0mBJjBA). Also MGM is home to **Cirque Du Soleil's 'Ka'**. Not my favorite Cirque show, but still an interesting one. My favorite Cirque show is the Beatles' 'LOVE', which you can only catch in Las Vegas. (see LOVE review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?hrid=FBWaEYnI5TPtpuBeePDZdA).

Need to Catch Some Sun?
-------------------------------
They have not one, not two, but FOUR pools! If those weren't enough fun for you, they have 3 whirlpools and waterfalls too. It's a 6.5 acre complex of pool action and also includes a quarter mile lazy river. As if you hadn't already consumed enough food and alcohol, they have 5 bars and a full service Cabana grill. You can even get a poolside massage. What?!

Need to Feel Large and In Charge?
----------------------------------------
The **MGM Grand Garden Arena** is there for you! When you're here, you can't help but feel the power and energy of thousands of people in one space. Amazing sound systems and visual effects really enhance the experience. If your company is cool enough to play EDM (electronic dance music) for 5 hours, I can guarantee you'll have a great time here. Arena staff are friendly and helpful, which is a huge contrast compared to much of the hotel.

Need to Dance?
-------------------
Other than partying with my company's EDM fix, you can also hit up **Hakkasan**, one of the hottest nightclubs in Vegas. No wonder this place won the title of "#1 Nightclub in the World" by Playboy Magazine. All the top DJ's spin here, including resident DJ's Tiesto and Calvin Harris. Then of course there's also **Wet Republic** at the ultra pool, complete with the resident DJ's, a newly expanded 95-foot bar (neverending alcohol), a huge LED display, party cabanas/bungalows, and of course tons of people ready to party in their bathing suits. A super fun day party! (see Wet Republic review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/wet-republic-ultra-pool-las-vegas?hrid=KRe8TmiGoVdgNzKIFNxjgw)

All in all, the MGM Grand has a LOT to offer. Just wish their customer service could keep up.

TIP: Be prepared when asking for extra towels. Staff may sound as shocked as if you had asked for their firstborn child.

DATE TIP: Plenty of venues here for a hot date!

Happy Hour Review:

After two years, it's time for an update.  

We really like the Happy Hour at Tommy Bahama's. It's one of our ole standbys, along with Brio Tuscan Grill.  Tommy Bahama's works hard at that laid back, island feel. Downstairs you have a small bar and patio surrounded in a U-shape by the retail store.  The water misters actually do a great job and you wouldn't know its over 100 degrees outside. Really!  Upstairs they have an additional bar, with the main dinning area, along with some private rooms

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
As I mentioned there's a relaxed feel here.  Or, maybe it's their delicious and yummy Mojitos. The crowd is a mixture of all ages.  We had a few teenagers behind us, along with a few out of town'ers.  But it's really hard to categorize the group, except to say that everyone is usually laughing and having a good time.

MENU:
I've attached the  two sided HH menu(photo) along with the appetizers from the regular menu.  The food is very good. Some regular menu items can be pricey, like the salads that start at $16.00.  But, almost all of the HH food is $6.00. Our favorites are the Sirloin Sliders(photos) and the Fish Tacos, but everything is good.

SERVICE:
We have never had any problems with the service. You have your regular server, but everyone pitches in, and I don't mean when you put your credit card down.  Water glasses are refilled on a timely basis.  Inquiries are made about your food and if you are ready for the next item. Nice.

FOOD:
Their Small Plates menu has: Ahi Tuna Poke for $6.00; Fish Tacos for $6.00; Prime Burger Slider for $6.00; Edamane Hummus for $5.00; Crispy Plantains for $5.00; yummy Macadamia Goats Cheese for $5.00; also yummy Jerk Chicken Lolloipops for $5.00 and Candied Spiced Nuts for $5.00.  All delicious.

As for drinks, the Cocktails are $6.00 and include: Mai Tai, Mojito, Sangria, Margarita, and something called a Crazy Cuban and Spiced Hurricane. So you won't go thirsty here.

PRICES:
Our most recent bill came to $43.00 including taxes but not gratuities. But, it's usually in the $31.00 to $37.00 ranges with two drinks. This time we shared a salad and there was no upcharge for a second plate.

Enjoy!

The decor for this place was definitely the best part. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f1eeViD_rhRG4-MIFgZsEA

It was a nice day so we got seated on the terrace overlooking the Vegas strip.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=FR6MuipnPqtxwIo9BUVZHA

There are some hotties working up in here.  I kept drooling over one of the waiters.  He was Asian, built, slight scruff, and had tattoos on his right arm.  I wanted to order him and take him to go but he wasn't on the menu :(

Order:  Crab cake, mac and cheese, pomme frites, Croque madame, and shrimp cocktail.  For dessert we ordered the caramel tart and the chocolate terrine.  

Crab cake came served with a remoulade and topped with a frisee salad.  It was actually pretty good, nice and meaty with large chunks of crab, yet it was still crispy and held up.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=p_zZ9eP10crf4OoTMMPw-w

Shrimp Cocktail came with huge jumbo shrimp.  I'm not a big cold shrimp fan so it was just okay for me.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f0eXikNX8SVFSiTNYpvs2Q

Croque Madame is basically a ham and cheese sandwich topped with an egg.  I wouldn't order it.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=hz67b-rY5NF_D8MfoFhpyw

Mac and Cheese came out awesome looking, but upon further tasting it fell pretty flat.  It needed something to lighten it up and give it some flavor.  My friend squeezed some lemon on it and she said it made it a lot better.  They need to work out that recipe and give it some ooomph!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=xWVNfswLh_diFTC__WeVMg

The chocolate terrine was too dark for me.  I normally enjoy dark chocolate but this was a tad too bitter for me.  It just tasted like straight up cocoa powder.  I wouldn't order it again.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=LeYT8q4sUDeDQrM6-jxIeA

The caramel tart was really good, but the crust was super stiff and thick which normally I like :)  but not in a dessert.  Flavor-wise though, it was the better of the two.  It came with caramel ice cream and candied macadamian nuts and wafers.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=Uv9LtnwzyrTIZFS6DEGv3w

The waiter was cordial and accommodating.  He was telling us about life in Vegas because I was thinking about applying to schools there.  Overall, it was a nice relaxing meal.  There were highs and lows but pretty solid still.

With so many notable spots for fusion cuisine having popped up in the middle of the desert over the past few years, Japaneiro kicks the door down and slam dunks their excellent menu into the Asian fusion ring with authority. 

Like a lot of the gushing reviews already mention, the chalkboard specials by the entrance is where the gold is.  My advice would be to take a picture of it to look over with your tablemates so you're not like me and getting up to look over the board again and again as if it were on display at a museum.  

I can never say no to foie gras.  If foie gras told me to jump off a bridge, buy it diamond earrings or crash my car through a convenience store, I'd do it.  It was well cooked and those tasty notes of fatty tenderness in a savory sauce were music to my mouth.  I even showed some restraint by offering the last bite to my wife. :P

The Nigerian prawns tasted as impressive as they appeared.  Large and succulent, the truffle butter sauce that it was accompanied by took it to another level.  The green salad offered a nice balance to the whole dish.  I admit I sucked on the shrimp shells to savor the flavor and only felt 3.1% ashamed/embarrassed about it afterwards.  

Our meal luckily managed to carry over to the late happy hour that occurs M-F 10pm-midnight.  Ending the meal with some great small bites like the salmon/tuna/beef tacos and miso black cod lettuce wraps.  The standout was the rock shrimp with its terrifically crispy fry, micro wasabi kick and cream sauce made it an absolute steal for $5.50.  I guess that shows how good these chefs are; they even managed to make rock shrimp interesting!

The lack of description for many of the items caused me to underestimate things like the "European Sea Bass" until I saw it brought to another table near the end of our meal.  The fish looked marvelous with the meat being filleted post-grill and the rest of the carcass twisted up for an interesting look.  I was practically seething with jealousy!  

Lesson learned: everything is awesome and get that the next time.

I could tell you all the reasons why you shouldn't go here. But what good of a reviewer would I be if I told the Yelp community to stay away because this place is far too amazing and you're not good enough to take part in it. Every food lover who can appreciate the beauty in a piece of raw fish should have the chance to experience what Kabuto has brought to Las Vegas. But good luck trying, there are only 18 seats in the entire restaurant and once word gets out, it ain't gonna be easy to get in.

Kabuto is part of the Mon Restaurant Family (Monta, Goyemon, Sushi Mon) and another development from restaurant stylist Martin Koleff. Martin is a pioneer for authentic Japanese eateries in Las Vegas. And at the sushi bar, I was rubbing elbows with those who were more than familiar with Martin's talents. He even popped in for a brief hello during my meal. 

I was told the Omakase Course ($80) will not be available until after the grand opening. I went with the Nigiri Course ($48) but you can order a la carte if you wish. I was served a pineapple appertif sake, a small cucumber salad with sea snail, and 10 pieces of the best fish I've ever had. You can state your preferences, but I had the chef choose for me. He was actually quite vocal and very friendly! He was conversational and took the time to explain the origin of each fish. The giant clam and bull eye were a couple of my favorites. And the uni with ikura were to die for. After your 10 pieces are served, you have the option of ordering more nigiri or moving on to your handroll. I ordered an additional saba then finished my meal. If you love mackerel. Order it here. I've now found the best saba in Las Vegas.

Dessert is not taken lightly here either.  In a couple of months, a Japanese pastry shop is to join this family of restaurants right next door. You have a few dessert options with the nigiri course--mochi, ice cream, or the strawberry layered crepe I ordered. Before I started eating, the chef busted out his iPhone and showed me a picture of a bunch of rocks. Confused, he explained to me the pastry chef's vision. She created the pink and white layers to resemble the layers of rock and sandstone at Red Rock. It was touching, and very delicious.

To be quite honest, I've never been to Japan. My understanding of Japanese tradition is a smattering of information from the internet and my Japanese-immigrant friends. But even I can tell that authenticity and quality are of the utmost importance here. From the food to the decor, Kabuto lives and breathes culture. Its unlike any sushi "joint" you've ever visited in town. I won't discourage you from visiting this magnificent addition to the Las Vegas community. But if you walk in expecting a baked roll with cream cheese, please, turn around and leave those 18 seats for the rest of us.

If I were on my deathbed, I would request to be wheeled over to eat at Bacio because it would feel like a LIFETIME!!!

I dined here because of a $150 food credit.  With so many quality restaurants in Las Vegas, the ones at The Tropicana aren't on the top of my list.  They're not even on the list.

But color me surprised when I saw their 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings for only $39.  Hey!  That made "restaurant week" look expensive.  It's a shame we didn't even get to the third course after 2+ hours.  I felt even worse for the couple from Italy at the next table playing the same waiting game.  Why in God's name would actual Italians eat here?!?!  

Their saving grace was that the food I did try was actually decent.  The "Risotto Capesante" with scallops, asparagus and prosciutto paired with a crispy white wine was surprisingly good.  I would've been happy with this dish as all four courses.  The "White Peach" salad I received over an hour later was also good but the wait made it taste a little less good.  My dinner companions ordered a la carte and got the veal parmigiana (huge and juicy) and shrimp risotto 90 minutes after ordering.  If they actually got this whole "serving food in a timely manner" down, Bacio wouldn't be a half bad place.  

What the heck was going on in the kitchen??  My guess was the chef suffered from narcolepsy.  We had less than 35 minutes to make a 10pm show at Caesars Palace.  I spoke with the manager to express my displeasure and he took the 2 course dinners off the bill.  The server was super nice, apologetic and took care of a round of drinks too.  At least they made an effort to make it right.  They then boxed up our last two courses of lobster gnocchi (rubbery) and apple granola cheesecake.  The dessert then melted in my car and went straight into the garbage.

Craving pizza, we stopped here for dinner. Inside they have a decent amount of seating, though some of the seating is a bit too close to the next table. We seated ourselves and our server came over a few minutes later to greet us. There were no other customers when we arrived (some came in later) and it seemed odd that no employees were noticeable until the server came from the back. I ordered the "Mozzarella Sticks" priced at $6 to start. About 15 minutes later our server came back to take our main order (no mozzarella sticks in sight) and hubby and I shared a medium "Chicago Style Pizza" with 1/2 pepperoni & sausage and 1/2 garlic & ricotta. The pizza was priced at $19.65 and even for a medium pizza, it was hearty. I asked the server about the mozzarella sticks and she said they should be right out. Another 10 minutes later they arrived! I don't know what went into preparing them, but they took damn long enough! I thought the sticks were very good. Not worth what we waited, but good. The server did warn us that the pizza would take about 30 minutes. Lie! An hour later the pizza came out. I felt like family at this point I mean we had been there so long! The crust on the pizza was perfect and the sauce tasted great, Unfortunately, the garlic and ricotta were visible yet the flavor of them barely stood out at all. I might give the deep dish another try with different toppings in the future since the crust and sauce were good, but with some of the toppings I chose this time lacking in flavor (you should be able to taste fresh garlic!) and how long it took for service, I can't see coming back anytime right away. 

They charge $3 for delivery according to their menu. Mon - Fri they have a pizza and salad buffet for $7.95 (dine-in only) from 10am - 2pm.

Dang, Cantina Laredo - I wanted to like you so hard!  Like a hot date that ends in a restraining order, like an incredible hike that ends in poison oak or skunk spray - I've walked past this place for years, imagining a swanky, high-end Mexican food joint behind the dark windows and high prices; sadly, what I found was a very regular, uninspired restaurant serving up some rather meh Mexican food.  This was a 'man behind the curtain' Wizard of Oz moment for me.

Good things?  Mmmmmm - the warm spicy salsa which they serve along with another milder cold one (not so good) and chips is the reason this place gets 2 very enthusiastic stars from me - SO DELICIOUS!  It was hook-me-up-to-a-feed-bag delicious.  Service was quick and pleasant.

After that though, it all goes downhill.  Being vegetarian, I can 99% of the time find something meatless and tasty when I go out to eat but there were very few such options here.  I ended up selecting the Enchiladas de Espinaca and subbed in a Cheese & Onion one to shake things up a bit (I know, I'm very exciting).  When my meal came out, the waitress said she had the kitchen put zucchini alongside my Mexican rice instead of beans (wtf - who in their right mind opts out of beans for zucchini at a Mexican food restaurant?!); so began the first of my meal modifications - I might note here that while being veggie, I am a pretty low-maintenance diner.  So, just as the black beans are being brought out, I realize the sauce atop my cheese enchilada consists of red chili with beef chunks - again wtf - in my 31 years of life on this earth, no Mexican food joint I've ever visited has ever converted a cheese enchilada to a meat one via the sauce!  The waitress said they could make me a new cheese & onion with sour cream sauce atop (cringe).  The mushroom and spinach enchilada was kinda gross - something about the oil they used to saut the spinach in gave it a strange taste and the button mushrooms looked like they had been plunked into it straight out of a can.  The zucchini and cheese & onion enchilada were nothing I would ever want to order again.  Black beans were alright - hard to mess those up though.  

In defense of Cantina Laredo, if you're a big meat eater, perhaps you might have more luck here than I.  The place was clean, the workers were nice, the one aforementioned salsa is killer.  But this place is neither authentic nor new-agey Mexican, not worthy of the steeper price points, and certainly lacks any great ambience to carry the lackluster food.  Don't think I will be auditioning this place for a second date or hike - would strongly consider rolling around in poison oak or getting skunk sprayed over coming back - it was that bad.

She sells seashells by the seashore
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#72KODOc9wIrLiJCmEbU6Ew

30% off via Tix4Tonight deal of $2/person

Living out our inner Katniss & going through our "Hunger Pains", we needed something yummy to fill our tummies.  Not being in the mood for a burger or whatever fried crap available, we thought Thai food sounded good.

SEA:The Thai Experience is located back in the boonies of Bally's Hotel & Casino.  The cuisines served are both Thai & Vietnamese.  The ambiance was rather nice, with the center of the restaurant having a fountain pool with a Buddha statue, surrounded by wood tables.  On the periphery, standard tables to dine at, with a private area for large parties.

Being Vegas, we knew we shouldn't expect prices similar to the local haunts back home.  I was almost taken aback as to how much things were, but with 30% off, it helped sweeten the sour taste of overpriced food.

Fried calamari($12)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#GfhhEFZn2GCeSDFfXlbYiA
Lightly breaded calamari, fried to a nice texture, accompanied with sweet chili sauce.  Nice & chewy, these were really good.  I'm a big squid fan, and I enjoyed each fried piece from the sea.  

Pad Thai, with beef ($18)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#yUTLbpFitScqvHh75IGvBQ
Sweet, sour & filling, the pad thai had fair portions & was as good as any that I've had dining at my favorites.  

Honey walnut shrimp fried rice ($18)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#dUTI_D4Rxdqi6-iHIxXNUA
Winna, winna!  The highlight of our meal, the honey walnut shrimp fried rice  made me want to pop a wheelie in a Tuk-Tuk down Las Vegas Blvd.  Crunchy walnuts & bell peppers, a pleasing amount of deveined shrimp with a medley of vegetables  wok-tossed with seasoned rice.  The portions were great, and I relished this dish, since we only had appetizers for dinner the night before.  

Service was on the slow side.  The place wasn't too busy when we arrived, so I didn't understand why our food took longer than necessary.  Our drinks were kept filled & we had a nice meal, enjoying Thai music & the sound of falling water from the Buddha fountain.  

In summation, we had a nice Thai lunch at SEA:The Thai Experience.  Would I dine here w/o the Tix4Tonight deal?  Heck no!  Way too expensive for stuff that's 3 times more costly than restaurants I usually go to.  However, the food was good & we were happy.  Furthermore, the ambiance was a nice respite from the frenzy of the Strip.

Recommend with the 30% off Tix4Tonight deal

This ain't no Hometown Buffet, yo!

FYI, I am NOT a fan of buffets! When my brother wanted to spend his birthday here out of ALL the other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I wanted to say, "What?!?! Are you serious?!?! What the heck is wrong with you?!?! Do we really need 3000 calories in one meal???"

But hey, he was paying for our dinner at $36.95/person so I just kept my mouth shut. I'm sure my bratty face showed how I was feeling anyway. While dining here, I realized that the food was much better than most buffets. Actually, it's the best buffet I've been to so far.

Excellent dishes:
Thai Beef Salad
Crab legs
Smoked Salmon
Chicken with some kind of mango salsa
Pepperoni Pizza
And so many more but I can't remember cuz I was in a food coma.

Not so great dishes:
All the sushi rolls - rice was old, dry, tough. Sushi is never good at a buffet. I know this but I was curious, I just wanted to try it.
And some other things but I can't remember cuz I was in a food coma.

Then there's the dessert area....EEEEEEEEEEEEKKK!  It was HEAVEN!!! A crepe station, gelato, cookies, carrot cake, cheescakes, cupcakes, mousse, chocolate-dipped marshmallows, etc. The creme brulee was my favorite! I think I tried almost ALL of them. YAY for sugar!!! I had about 10 desserts on the table in front of me. WOOO!

Service was excellent! I wish I remembered the name of the guy who helped us with drinks and other things cuz he was really patient with the 18 of us. We needed more utensils, napkins, drinks and we changed the seating for the kids, our requests seemed endless but we didn't have to wait long to get them. When my family realized he was Filipino, they were all over him and kept asking him questions: "Where do you live?" "Where's your family?" "How long have you been here?" "Can you take our picture?" "Can you take one more?" "Okay, one more picture?" I felt sorry for the guy but it didn't look like it bothered him at all. He never stopped working or smiling while he was answering a billion questions...and thank you for taking 50 pics of us!

I had so much fun trying so many different things! I'm glad my brother celebrated his birthday here. For a buffet, this is really good!

I expected Carson Kitchen to be a little busy based on the buzz, but not a 30 minute wait on a Sunday night.  At least my wife and I were able to get drinks and hang around their outdoor area in the back.  The whole thing was quite an eye opener for me.  Who would have thought even 5 years ago that something like this would be thriving on 6th St and Carson???  Amazing!

The dining area was a little cramped but still maintained a cool vibe.  The open kitchen, bustling servers and unique seating area kind of enhanced the experience.  I wouldn't come with more than a party of 4 until their outdoor and upstairs areas are done.  Our server informed us those areas would be complete in about a week.

I'd classify the fare as "New American".  Kerry and his staff do some really interesting twists.  Their "Wellington Empanada" was a delicious way to start the meal.  I enjoyed their take on the typical empanada crust.  It was light with some crunch and soaked up the excellent sauce on the plate nicely.  

My wife gasped when she saw they offered "Crispy Chicken Skins" and ordered it almost before our server got out the word "hello".  Breaded and deep fried chicken skin isn't exactly clean eating but holy shit was it awesome.  Maybe chicken skin really is the new bacon!  It was a glorious way to swiftly kick my diet right in the balls.  Both of us weren't really big on the smoked honey dipping sauce it came with and opted to use the rich empanada sauce instead.

We shared the "Rabbit Ragu" and the "Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak" done rare.  The rabbit was delightful and the sauce delivered a surpisingly spicy kick.  Thankfully, the spaghetti was made of squash.  I needed some vegetables after my mini guilt trip on the chicken skins :P The steak was a little more medium rare than rare but the sauce and light espresso flavor made up for it.

Can't wait to drink and dine outside next time!

There have been some changes at the DMV and I'm impressed. No more waiting in a long line yay! This new "Dash Pass" system worked well. With the Dash Pass you can text, call or go online and put yourself in the line without having to even go down to the DMV until it's your turn. They will text you with how many people are ahead of you and your estimated wait time and then they send you a command list so you can text back whenever you want to find out things like how long your current wait time is or to let them know if you need more time or even if you want to be taken out of the line. They text you with fair enough warning about when your turn is so you know when to arrive at the DMV and they let you know around that time what window you will need to go to. This is seriously awesome! I never would have thought I'd give the DMV 5 stars, but this new system really worked great for me twice now and the employees were even really friendly. I needed to renew my license so I had to go inside. Usually I avoid going inside since they have the DMV kiosks around town at a variety of places and it's so convenient to stop and register your car at the kiosk and you can do it at any hour. Sometimes though you just can't avoid having to go inside and now it's not that bad having to do so. The snack bar seems to get bigger and bigger and the line of people at it cracks me up, but hey why not grab a hot dog, nachos or cotton candy while at the DMV? When it came time to pay for my license renewal and the lady told me it would cost $41.25 I was shocked. I asked why so much now and she said that I would be getting a license good for 8 years. Say what?!?! Apparently those born even numbered years get the 8 year license and those in odd numbered years that renew will continue to receive the 4 year license until 2017 and then get the 8 year license after that. I kind of like the idea of not having to go back for 8 years a lot. I'm kind of surprised though since people do age differently among other things. I didn't have an issue with finding a parking spot like I have many times before and that was nice. I'm guessing the parking lot wasn't so bad because people are maybe using Dash Pass. I am happy to say that I had a quick and painless experience at the DMV.

I've been coming here for a long time since before when it was Xtreme Sushi and through the new ownership change. I must say that I love it the most now that the new owner(s) has/have taken over. The food is a lot more consistent. They've added some new artwork and chairs which made the atmosphere a whole lot nicer and tied everything together more with the decor. Plus they got rid of the awful grimy menus that had seen better days and have added new rolls, my favorite being the Burn Your A** roll. The Yoshi roll from the past is still on the menu so it looks like they've kept some of the more popular rolls. I'm pretty sure that they will accommodate orders from the old menu in case there's something you miss from before. It's a lot of the same people that work here so that's half the battle right there.

The employees are all great and personable. It's very much like the tv show Cheers type atmosphere. Once they get to know you, they will roll out the red carpet, including remembering your name and what you order to make you feel at home. I'm just waiting on my little name plaque at the sushi bar where I always sit. ;)

It's the little things like this to consider when there are so many other options for AYCE sushi in Las Vegas. They really care and appreciate your business here. Therefore, I vote in favor of trying out this local gem.

PS: Why in the hell did someone upload a photo of their dog in their review of this place? I love dogs like the next person but seriously? WTF!?

My first visit being so-so, I decided to give Teriyaki Madness a second try to see if I liked it any better. For me it was still the same so-so experience and I don't get the hype over this place. Inside is very clean and they have plenty of tables to choose from and the booths are spacious which is nice. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu. Some of the food I ordered was really good and some of it was not so good. I do get coupons in the mail sometimes for BOGO offers, so I can see coming back with a coupon and probably will since the rice and chicken are pretty darn good and I work in the area, but I can't see making a point to come here often. 

Spicy Chicken Teriyaki Plate ($8.99) - I took the white rice that came with it and mixed it with the chicken. I liked the flavor of the chicken a lot. There was a good portion of both rice and chicken. I'd order this again for sure. 

Spicy Beef Teriyaki Plate ($9.49) - For an extra $1 this time I chose noodles instead of rice. The noodles were a bit dry and lacked flavor. The beef was tender and tasted good, but I tasted teriyaki flavor and no spice which was a bummer because I had enjoyed the spicy chicken and the chicken actually kick. The overpowering flavor of teriyaki on this one will most likely mean that I will stick to the spicy chicken instead.

Chicken Egg Roll ($1.99) - Inside I saw tons of what appeared to be black pepper yet the egg roll really had no flavor. It was filled with a generous amount of chicken, but it was greasy and flavorless. 

Chicken Pot Stickers ($3.29) - These were a greasy and overcooked mess. On the menu these are described as "crazy good" and I got 5 of them that were crazy greasy and hard. The inside tasted not so great. I will stick to the stickers elsewhere. 

Stir-Fry Veggies and a Green Salad are each options for sides. The salad came with a sweet dressing that tasted good. The veggies were basic yet tasty and fresh. 

Orders are made fresh so if you are on a lunch break or crunched for time then call your order in so it's ready or at least being made while you are on your way to pick it up.

Bouchon is THE ideal brunch spot after a long night (and/or morning) in Las Vegas. Roll out of bed (or the club) and get yourself over here for some hearty delicious grub! 

Anna R. and I strolled over in the hot sun and arrived around 11 AM. We were told there would be a 25 minute wait. Since we hadn't eaten much the day before, we were practically starving. Luckily they offer seating at the bar, so we gratefully decided to sit there.

We each ordered a Croque Madame -- Anna highly recommended it and the description on the menu made the dish undeniable. I had no other choice. While we eagerly waited, we each enjoyed a refreshing **Hibiscus Cocktail**. Just the right amount of bubbly and lightly sweet for a morning meal. The candied hibiscus at the bottom of the glass was delicious! 

When the **Croque Madame** finally arrived, I wasn't quite ready for what I saw. Beautiful presentation -- a sunny side egg perfectly placed atop a ham and cheese sandwich with thick bread, accompanied by a huge mound of french fries. As I cut this creation open, I happily observed the cheese oozing out from within the folds of the sandwich. I was also very pleased when the egg yolk started running all over the absorbent bread and the rest of the sandwich. HEAVEN. And those fries are extremely addictive and come in a dangerously generous portion.

Service at the bar was excellent. The bartenders checked on us frequently and made sure we were taken care of. My only complaint is that it took around 30 minutes to get our food. The restaurant seemed to be understaffed on Labor Day Sunday, as there were several tables available that were not being used. I was surprised that an establishment of this caliber would not be fully staffed for a holiday when lots of hungry folks would be waiting for a table.

OVERALL: Extremely pleased with the food and service, but I hope they can fully staff all their meals so there aren't such long waits and unallocated tables.

DATE TIP: This is a super cute breakfast/brunch spot with French decor and a warm vibe. Consider taking your date here in the morning after a fun night!

After an evening of nonstop Vegas-style partying, the only words I managed to utter from my dry raspy voice the following morning was...water please!!!

In addition to replenishing my body with much needed liquids, I was feeling mighty peckish, as well!  After much deliberation, our group decided on a calm & relaxing sit down Saturday brunch at Thomas Keller's Bouchon. 

Located on the 10th floor inside the Venetian, the restaurant embodied what I've come to expect from a fine French bistro. The vibe was chic & refined yet relaxed and unfussy.  There were comfortable banquettes throughout the main dining area as well as outdoor seating in the patio area. We were subsequently seated inside. At 12:00pm, the sun was beaming from the patio, so our location filtered the intense light perfectly, which suited me and my solar sensitive eyes just fine. 

Complimentary house made jam was magnificent! The jam is freshly prepared each day and depending on the chef's mood, a different flavor variety is served. Today, he was feeling strawberry, which is my personal favorite! They served us an Epi baguette to share and it was fantastic, as well. Warm, buttery crust with perfectly chewy texture. Coupled with the soft butter and sweet pucker inducing jam, it was a match made in the stars.

The entrees were orchestrated perfectly as we didn't have to wait long at all.

Chicken n waffles - The waffles were made with bacon n chives and sourdough batter. It was airy and crisp with a lightly sweet flavor and a savory finish. It was so good i almost forgot to use the syrup!
The chicken was roasted perfectly and it was insanely moist & tender! The chasseur wine sauce was rich and flavorful with an alluring aroma. Some of my guests enjoyed the savory flavor so much they poured the irresistible sauce over their waffles, too!

Pork belly was fatty and incredibly flavorful and juicy.  Accompanied by the creamy hollandaise sauce, it was absolutely delicious!

Corned beef hash was phenomenal! Well seasoned pieces of corned beef mixed with all the traditional fixins that will impress any die hard corned beef hash purist!  Trust, this was far from canned! 

Short rib was tender, the fontina cheese was fragrant and the whimsically tiny jingle bell peppers added a pleasant little kick to this fantastic dish!

Beignets were served fresh out of the oven but they were quite dense and tasted more like doughnuts IMO Overall, they were very moist and with the added raspberry preserve filling, they added a sweet finish to our savory entrees.

Our service throughout the meal was very consistent with coffees, water, and juices always filled to the brim.

By the end of the meal we were absolutely stuffed!  But I didn't mind at all :D

My friends and I had a wonderful time and it was great feeling totally replenished and revived with good quality food that was masterfully prepared with fantastic service to boot. The strong coffee didn't hurt either!  I'm not quite sure if this particular location was ever awarded a Michelin star but IMO Thomas Keller deserves praise for a dining experience that was unpretentious, comforting and very enjoyable!

When we all left, I was sated, 100% refreshed and ready to take on the world, well at least another round of partying :) 

Hey, it's Vegas for crying out loud.

Happy Eats!

Prior to dining, my only familiarity with the Katsuya name was from TMZ.  If I were making half a milly per TV episode, this would be in my regular dining rotation too!  The menu's prices are on par with Nobu, Sushi Roku or Blue Ribbon.  

At least those restaurants offer some kind of a chic atmosphere.  Katsuya felt like an upscale diner with a sushi bar plunked in the middle.  The bright lighting, noise from the casino and the constant yelling of "Irashaimase!" over and over and over by employees made this a decisively unsexy spot.  I can't imagine tourists would want this kind of setting for a pricey sushi meal on the strip.  If a booth at Nobu's outpost at Caesars Palace is Kate Upton, it's kind of Rosie O'Donnell here.  Power lunches or corporate dinners? Yes.  Anniversary dinners or bachelorette parties? No!  

For those reasons, my wife and I chose to sit at the bar since the people working there looked like they were having a good time.  All them were super nice and knowledgeable of all things Katsuya. They also made some awesome cocktails to boot.  I loved the "Sahara Cooler" which consisted of Ketel One Oranje vodka, Aperol, passion-fruit pure, fresh lime juice, and Stiegl Radler Grapefruit beer.  That was instant refreshment.  One of the bartenders, whose name escapes me but I remember being a Chargers/Eagles fan, created a wonderful version of a prickly pear cocktail for my wife. 

The plan was to not order items we could get at local, off the strip Japanese spots like Kyara or Raku.  So $8 edamame (shockingly saw lots of people order this), anything from the robata grill ($12 for asparagus with no bacon) and $11 karaage were out of the question.  

Want to know what was?  Rare Wagyu filet with foie gras on top!  So tender and soooo decadent, it was like a story I never wanted to end.  The plum wine sauce reduction really added a nice balance.  Lobster and truffle chawanmushi was another dish I don't see everyday.  Despite the small portion being steamed in a Japanese tea cup, I thought it tasted great and would probably order it again.  Dig in from the bottom for maximum truffle taste.

I thought the Wagyu sashimi seared with hot oil and topped with chives and ginger was very good too.  The oil they used made it taste more like a Chinese dish which was a nice little changeup from the other beef dish.  Seared tuna with Japanese salsa was equally as good.  The high quality of the fish was easy to see as well as taste.

My wife was still hungry and had her eye on the "Wafu Carbonara" which was simply described as "slow-cooked bacon, soy reduction, and soft poached egg".  I tried to talk her out of it since she makes a great version of this dish at home.  Unsurprisingly, I lost that battle.  One of the bartenders assured us this was something worth having and she was right.  The huge chunks of pork belly with bonito flakes and sauce/egg mix just oozing over the ramen noodles was a hearty dish and a nice ending to the meal.

So my closest 17 relatives and I were going to Vegas and I wanted to try to introduce them to some interesting food that they might not otherwise try. Talking to a group like that is like herding cats! MY GAHHHD!!! It was such a loooooong, painful process! I showed them pictures, menus, prices, and spent hours deciding what to eat for our 3 days in Vegas.

While talking about our dining options, I often heard: "It's expensive!" "Buffet! Let's go to a buffet!" "That's such a small portion!" "Let's go to the Filipino restaurant!" "Umm...where else can we go?" GEEEEZZZZ. I wanted to end my misery so I gave up persuading them to eat somewhere else.

PAN SEARED SCALLOPS - Yessss, oh yeeeees...These scallops were perfectly seared, fresh and tasty! The red wine sauce was so good that I actually ate all the brussels sprouts and parsnip pear pasta that came with it. The sauce had a tremendous flavor but it didn't cover up the scallopy flavor! Is "scallopy" a word? Well, it should be!

Nothing else was as superb as the scallops, though.

COMPLIMENTARY BREAD - They gave us so much! Unfortunately it wasn't fresh off the oven. I didn't even mind if it was recycled but at least heat it up! The olive oil/balsamic vinegar it came with was spicy and wasn't good. My family, on the other hand, must've liked it cuz they inhaled most of the bread and the olive oil, maybe because the entrees were taking too long.

OSSO BUCCO - This was the special that night but it wasn't that special. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, it was alright but it was thirsty. I was not impressed with the risotto it came with either, it was a little tough. A little more water all around would be great!

TIRAMISU - It was decent and that's all I can say about that.

PANNA COTTA - Light, silky, creamy, yummy! But it was just like many a panna cotta I've had.

SERVICE - Needs improvement! We were the only customers for a while and their service was so slow. Our entrees took about 45 minutes. It got even slower when more people came in. Our waitress was MIA for so long that we asked another waiter for the dessert menu. It took about 15 minutes for everyone to decide what to get and our waitress was still missing when we were ready to order. When we asked for our waitress the waiter replied, "She's busy." Uhh...how about us??? We didn't want to be late to the Cirque du Soleil show! So another waiter took our order. We finally saw our waitress again when she served our dessert.

I was kind of disappointed that my family chose to eat here cuz there are so many other excellent restaurants in Las Vegas. It wasn't a total bummer because the scallops kicked serious ass, the panna cotta was good, and my family liked their dishes. So in the end I guess I didn't mind so much that we had dinner here, but I don't think I could be convinced to eat here again.

Make sure you come prepared to stand in line here at the Bachannal Buffet. Being one of the more popular buffet's on The Strip, this line can get outright outrageous I heard.  We were lucky this time,  waiting less than 45 minutes, after hearing stories of people waiting 1-2 hours. BTW, you can opt to pay an extra fifteen bucks to enter via the "Preferred" line. Nope, I'll wait. After paying for two, which by-the-way set me back a cool $102 bucks, we were escorted to our seats and invited to start anytime we wished. Ah, my dining companion and I decided we would make a "dry run" through the entire buffet to prepare ourselves for the journey ahead of us. After familiarizing ourselves with the setup, we proceeded to get our food. For me, the first stop was the Asian section. Being savvy enough to discipline oneself to realize that there is one big huge buffet ahead and not to fill up on starch here can be difficult here.  There was a nice layout of sushi and other Oriental delicacies. As I made my way around the buffet, I couldn't help but notice the standard items found in most buffets. People were piling their plates with crab legs, which btw were probably snow crab, really skinny. I think I took maybe two small legs. I made my way to the prime rib, which is kinda how I judge a good buffet. I asked for a medium rare piece, but was a little disappointed in it's being dry. There were other meats, but they looked equally dry also. The oysters are good, though, very fresh. They have a nice display of fish in the display case which made for a great photo op!  The Mexican section was pretty good, but I think the star of this buffet had to be the dessert section. Macarons, cakes, pies, cake pops, even mochi ice cream! A dessert lover's paradise! All in all, I have to give this buffet a three star rating because I felt it was a bit overrated and because the meat section wasn't what I expected. The service was fair, although I noticed towards the end of our meal it got slow and our drinks went un-refilled... Would I go back? Probably not, I did want to try the brunch one day though. I think for the money, there are other better choices in Vegas.

After my outstanding experience here, it goes without saying that Wolfgang Puck's take on steaks is a "cut" above the rest!

Tucked inside the Palazzo resort, Cut exhibited a refined contemporary appeal and warmth that was both inviting and comforting.  I especially enjoyed the service by Tara who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. 

After allowing us to peruse the menu for awhile, she returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts and I must say, they all looked enticing! 

Shortly after, we were served our wine and breads, which included the usual steakhouse suspects of fragrant & savory onion focaccia, pretzel roll, one of my personal favorites, mainly because of the firm outside texture and soft and chewy inside... and it wasn't too salty like most other pretzel breads I've come across. 
Parmesan bread stick took a close second  place for its addictive light, crisp & crunchy texture with a generous coating of Parmesan breading on the outside.

Bone Marrow Appetizer - From the buttery soft marrow to the warm, flavorful mushroom sauce, it was a blissful combination of ingredients and love. Simply unbelievable. If there's one single dish from this entire trip, I will be craving for months afterwards, it will definitely be this!

Steak Tasting 
American Kobe Style from snake river - paired with a house steak sauce. The beef was perfectly tender and seared beautifully leaving my mouthwatering for another juicy bite. The tangy flavor of the steak sauce was a perfect addition to the meat as it brought on a bright acidity to the steak. Let it be known, I'm determined to get the recipe for that irresistible sauce!!!!
USDA prime dry aged - much softer and juicier than the New York, this cut of steak was praiseworthy in every way. Honestly, it was a cut of perfection on a plate and the accompanying chimichurri sauce added a brightness to my palate that made it all the more satisfying. 
Australian wagyu from Blackmore -
Worthy of it namesake, was truly the best of the best. It's like they took 50 steaks and concentrated all the beefiness into one bite. The best steak I've ever had. It came with a barnaise sauce but honestly this piece needed nothing to dress it. It was perfect all on its own.

White corn had a fresh & crunchy bite with a slightly sweet caremelized exterior that added a pleasant rustic flavor to the dish 

Dessert
Baked Alaska - Tasted like a giant strawberry mochi. Btw, that's a good thing!  It also came with a small lemon bar, which had a lip puckering natural citrusy flavor!

Banana Creme pie came with chocolate ice cream, sauce, and chocolate crunch pearls. Now that's what I call a triple chocolate threat! Having said that, It was surprisingly mild and less cloyingly sweet, which I really enjoyed.

Before we left, Tara gave us more sweets in the form of a chocalate truffle cookie bar and a chewy peanut brittle...both were absolutely delicious! 

Service was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. But i'd have to say Tara made all the difference! She transformed a pleasant meal to an unforgettable dining experience with her natural charm and warm tableside manner, which easily made the evening five stars in my book!

Bravo to CUT for an exquisite meal and extraordinary service! 

You bet ill be back for an encore! 

Until then...

Happy Eats!

I've had my hair done by the infamous Kim Vo & I don't consider myself fortunate. You couldn't pay me to go back to him. I gave him two chances but he lost me as a client! Not that he cares because Kim is some "big shot" hairdresser (allegedly). But please allow me to explain because YOU REALLY SHOULD NOT GO HERE!

I thought Kim was a nice guy, so it sucks to have to write this, but this is about hair here & I make my money partially based upon how I look. The results of his work has messed with my livelihood & I'm not happy about it! In short, Kim majorly screwed my hair up & this isn't some isolated incident. I'm completely baffled as to why Kim is a so called "celebrity hairdresser" yet THIS doesn't seem to be common knowledge:

"Kim Vo Firestarter" it's appropriately titled... http://gomezhyatt.com/2010-03-22-kim-vo-firestarter/

I wish I'd read all this BEFORE I went to him because if I had, I would have never let him come within 50 ft of my hair! The whole reason why I went to him was his BS marketing about how he's the "best blonder in the business" & how his blonde techniques are actually healthy for your hair. And I'm embarrassed to say that he caught me with his marketing hook, line and sinker. His PR company must be GOOD at burying info because it turns out that Kim is actually also famous for allegedly burning people & frying people's hair off. You can google all of this info yourself or you will hear it from time to time on Chelsea Lately, as apparently he fried her hair hair off too. Luckily I wasn't burned but I had to cut ties because Kim Vo left my hair in the worst shape that it has ever been in my life after only two visits with him. 

Kim does a GREAT job alright... at packing on the clients like an assembly line! The first time I saw him I was amazed at how fast he works. I was happy with my color but I did notice some tiger striping which was also pointed out to me every time I had a blowout. I think "Who did you hair?!" were the exact words my stylist said when she looked at all the bleeding from the foils in the back section that I was unable to see. But stupid me ignored these warning signs & I somehow thought perhaps it was my fault & that maybe I had tapped the foils by accident while under the dryer. And Kim had me roped in with his lil used car salespitch about how I have to give him a good four visits for my hair to be where it should be. So back I went for time #2 at his salon in Vegas at The Palms. I had been noticing that my hair was sticking up straight every morning like I had been sticking my finger in a light socket so I said something to Kim about it thinking that maybe I should cut my hair even shorter because it was obviously still damaged. Kim talked me out of it though. He related a story about how he was having the same issues with his own hair that morning & that it was sticking up because our hair was short & that we didn't have the weight of it being long to weigh it down. His explanation quieted my concerns & I entrusted him with my hair again. After this visit, my hair condition got even worse & then it finally hit me that HE was the one who was messing my hair up! That's when I started reflecting, & think about it, if he can't even get his own hair right, that is NOT a good sign! And the other thing is that I've had short hair before & I never had issues with my hair sticking up straight like it did under his care. So yeah, the length of my hair was not the problem. It was Kim Vo that was the problem. And let me just say, he is FIRED & officially off my Xmas card list! He's actually lucky I'm not waiting for him in a dark alley to show him my wrestling moves & brass knuckle phone case demonstration, LOL!

And now that I'm done with him, it's crazy how many horror stories I've heard about Mr. Vo which lead me to the articles/shows talking about how he (allegedly) burns people & fries hair. And I also heard that he uses some really hardcore bleach on everyone's hair because when he does his little assembly line action it allows him to lift the hair quicker which means mo clients + mo money = win for him. So if these things are true, then to Kim, you are really nothing more than a dollar sign & that pisses me off. The guy doesn't give a flying F#$K about your hair's health & I had to get back on the extension train & spend a lot of $$ to fix what he did. I just wish someone had said something on Yelp &/or this info wasn't buried by PR campaigns because I definitely would have thought twice about going to him. I'm pissed I drove all the way to Beverly Hills to see him the first time & paid a fortune x2, only to have my hair ruined! So that's my story. Maybe you won't have to fry your hair off or ruin it like he's done to me & others (allegedly). It's really a shame because I wanted to like Kim! I just got sucked in to all the hype. If I can save one person from my fate, this review will have been worth it.

I'm the first real person to review this place, let all other fake spammers be gone!  Yelp should really work that shizzle out.  Zack S...um this place closes at 11 so you couldn't have possibly hit the bar...so yeah if your gonna post fake reviews at least check your facts..

This place has so much potential, yet the ridiculously bad service just overshadowed everything good they did.

This is probably the worst service I have ever received in my life.  

Do you guys remember in Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts goes into the first store on Rodeo and the snooty lady acts like she's too good for this place?  Well that's what they did to us.

Where's the hostess?  Oh she's chatting with her friend...*ignoring me*

We finally get seated and then we sit and wait...

and wait...

and wait...

finally I get up and ask one of the waiters at the cash register to send over someone...

She treats us like we're a nuisance to her, she's singing along to the song that's playing...(WTF?)  I think they turned up the music louder as more people left because by the time it was near closing time it was blaring hip hop music...really weird considering it was a nice casual Italian restaurant.

We order almost 200 bucks worth of food, and then she's like "is that it?"

excuse me bitch...watch the attitude...

Wait, wait, watch as all the waiters get together to talk about us...seriously I can see you whispering about us....this is so unprofessional right now....

We seriously waited for like an hour and a half, it was ridiculous!  The place was practically empty!  The waiters were standing around and chatting with each other.  I took pictures as evidence!

This place is supposed to be a nice place, for the prices they charge they should have a whole restaurant re-staffed because it was ridiculous!  I have never felt more uncomfortable and treated so rudely in my life!

I also wanted to order take out for later and apparently they don't have take out boxes?  You're a restaurant?  You don't have boxes?  Seriously?

This is the worst experience in a restaurant I have ever had.  I've gotten better service at Carls Jr in a shady neighborhood than this.  

I won't hesitate to tell everyone to avoid this restaurant when you're in Vegas because this was outrageous!  No one treats me like that and gets away with it!  I wish I had a You've been yelped card so I could give them a piece of my mind.

I'm like those crazy housewives who have nothing better to do...I won't stop calling to speak to management until someone is fired.  I'm serious, no one gets away with treating me like that without suffering repercussions.  We don't play that, I'm sorry I'm not one of those quiet asian people who take your shit...I will not be silenced... You best believe.  You're done..The end.


*note I left for the manager*

"This is probably the most unprofessional and ridiculous restaurant I have ever had the misfortune to experience, not just from the our waitress, but the waitstaff and blatant ignorance from most of the employees I had to encounter."
                                                                   Anthony Nguyen

Third times a charm? This makes three times I have seen a pizza spot in this location. I stopped in and ordered a "Monday's Special" which is a large cheese pizza for $9.99 and additional toppings are extra. Inside was very busy so I guess others are wanting to this place out too. While I was waiting for my pizza, I noticed they have pizza by the slice for sale. I asked if they could add a slice of Sicilian (cheese) to my order priced at $3.25 and make it to-go. My husband isn't a fan of a lot of sauce on a pizza, but I'm the opposite. I asked for a side of sauce (cost .85 cents) to go along with my pizza for dipping and it and I ended up really liking the flavor. The pizza had a thin crust and the right amount of cheese for it. The pizza wasn't very greasy at all and hubby and I both enjoyed it. The Sicilian slice tasted great and had the crisp crust it should, but I was a but disappointed when I got home and opened the paper bag it was in and it was just on a paper plate inside the bag. They did just open, so it's possible they ran out of to-go boxes, but I hope it's not this way all the time. The Sicilian slice was actually my favorite part. The employees were nice and with the different specials they have going on and the food being decent, I can see coming back.

Most pizza joints have a "slice special" and it has a certain time it runs and sometimes only on certain days. Well, here you can get 2 slices and a drink for $5.50 7 days a week anytime. I thought it was a plus that I could get a slice special for dinner instead of just a restricted lunch time special. Aside from pizza they also have wings, fingers, salads, strombolis, pasta, sandwiches and desserts. They also cater.

We contacted Maleisa Hughes last year regarding watching our three dogs (golden retriever, afghan hound and a chihuahua.  The prices were reasonable considering what other sites cost, as they were only charging $20 per dog and they were willing to give a discount for the third dog, so the price was set at $50 per day.  We scheduled a visit to their home and brought our 2 big dogs to introduce them to the owners.  We saw that there was an acre which looked fun for the dogs. They invited us into their home and said the dogs would be treated like members of the family if boarded with them and that all play time outside would be supervised.  Maleisa said they had been boarding dogs for years and were experienced and advised we book early for any dates we wanted as they limited the number of dogs boarded to six dogs.  We felt that was reasonable on a property of that size.  Our dogs were all very well socialized with people and other dogs as we routinely went to dog parks so we felt this would be a great place to bring them. We booked a weekend last fall just to test the place out and see how it went.  We checked in often, via text and and we were told the dogs were doing great and having lots of fun.  The day we picked them up they were out in the yard with the owners running around with a few other dogs and seemed content.    My Afghan hound went to the corner of the yard when he saw me and hid behind some ducks in an open pen, I assumed he didn't want to go home as he had enjoyed his stay.   We went ahead and booked the Christmas week to bring the dogs again.

Christmas rolled around and one of my adult children announced she would be home and offered to watch the dogs for me.  As we had already booked with Green Acres, I didn't feel right about canceling at the last minute, as I had noticed that the owners had numerous young children and felt it would not be fair to deprive the family of the income we had promised.  I did opt to leave the chihuahua home, as I felt he might not be safe running around with bigger dogs.  We boarded the big dogs for about 9 days.  When I came to pick up the dogs that time, they were let out of a room in the back of the house and the afghan hound ran to me with his tail between his legs and couldn't wait to get out of there.  I noticed that both dogs were filthy and smelled HORRIBLE.  I can't even describe the stench, but it took several baths to finally get rid of the odor.  I found it odd because the acreage is all grass, so I couldn't figure out where that stench would have come from.  

Outside of the smell, the dogs seemed fine until a few weeks later we attempted to go back to the dog park where we had gone many times over the years, and when we entered the park the afghan hound FREAKED out and started aggressively barking at the other dogs that ran up to greet him as if to say, "stay away from me".  I had to grab him and remove him to avoid a dog fight.  We attempted to return to the park a few times thereafter and he behaved the same way each time.  He even freaked out on a walk when he saw another dog across the way.  We spoke to a trainer regarding the behavior and he told us once a dog is in that mind set it is VERY DIFFICULT to break it.  We were very sad and couldn't figure out what could have triggered such a wild swing in temperament.  We finally realized that his behavior HAD to have been impacted by the stay at the boarding facility.  Looking back now, if he was stuffed in a room with 30 other dogs, it would have driven any dog mad, or to fear aggression.

We couldn't prove that anything horrible had happened to our dog at that point, it was just a feeling that something bad had happened there and we decided we probably should not use them again.

We decided to hire my niece and nephew last week to watch our dogs while we were out of town, because of that gut feeling something was wrong over there and came back to the news that 17-21 dogs had died in the Hughes' care, or lack thereof.  All I can think about is, IF I had cancelled our plans during Christmas and left the dogs with my daughter, I WOULD HAVE BOOKED last week with the Green Acres and my dogs would have been among those poor souls who lost their lives.  We were the lucky ones...I may not be able to take my temperamental hound to a park anymore, but at least he is alive.  My heart is breaking for all the families who lost their sweet puppies.

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Warning! Going to Sam Fox Restaurants for Happy Hour after a movie can be habit forming. 

We have heard many good things about this Italian farmhouse concept, but we were little hesitant given that we found the lunch at North in Kierland just okay.  Our caution however, was unwarranted.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
We arrived around four-thirty and the parking lot was mostly empty. Were they open we thought? But as we approached the front door, it was opened by a hostess and we were invited in. Nice.  

We said we had come for the Happy Hour and were escorted not to the bar, but to some tables along the back wall. We were given menus, both Dinner and HH and heard a brief explanation of the fish special. Very cozy and very nice. I have taken a few photos of the inside of the restaurant.  The mood is upscale and dare I say 'hip".

MENU:
Like other Fox places, the HH menu is more of a starting point of samplers. For instances, if you like HH serving of freshly made meatballs and spaghetti, then maybe you'll like the lager dinner serving.

The HH menu has about a dozen items, mostly in the $5.00 - $8.00 range.  They have Caesar Salad, Arancini, Pizza of the Day $8, Chef's Board of meats and cheese $10, Zucca chips $3.  Two holdovers from other restaurants are the Castelvetrano Olives $3 and Spiced Nuts $2. These two look similar to the Olive & Ivy's offering. http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-and-ivy-scottsdale#hrid:XB-E39WNviGs1MkkQ4XIxw

As you would expect, they also have all beers and well drinks priced at $4.00 to $5.00.  But what we found special, are all their wines marked at 50% off.  They will also re-cork it for you to go.

Here are links to the menus:

http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/North_40th_Dinner_Menu2.pdf

SERVICE:
We found the service to be very professional.  Yes, the water glasses were refilled on a timely basis, but also the wait staff comes by and chats with you about your food and answers any questions you have very knowledgeably.  We actually got into a very detailed discussion on Washington State wines and Oregon Pinots with our server Vail.

FOOD:
We started off by ordering a Washington State Chardonnay, but found they didn't have any chilled.  We then opted instead for the Snoqualmie Riesling, which was somewhat sweet, with a hint of cherries.

We tried the HH Caesar Salad for $5.00 and the HH Spaghetti, also for $5.00. The salad came with some of the most delicious croutons that had a smokey taste we have ever had.  A definite must.  The spaghetti was equally interesting and flavorful.  The meatballs must be cooked in a marinara, and has a complexed layering taste which was different than the pasta sauce, which has a hint of fennel. Wow.

Next we ordered the Margherita Pizza ($11.00) off the Dinner menu, see photos. It was very good but we found the cheese slipped off when you bit into a wedge. 

For dessert, we each ordered the Gelato scoop for $3.00 and the Tiramisu for $6.00, both off the dinner menu.  I've taken pictures of the Titamisu.  It came in a glass ramekin with an amazing amount of delicious mascarpone cheese and flavorful Kahlua.

PRICES:
Our petite Happy Hour dinner of six items, ran us $41.50 before taxes and gratuities.  It also included the bottle ($23.00, 50% off) of Riesling, which our wonderful server Vail re-corked for us. As we left, the parking lot was full with a dozen cars waiting to be parked.

Enjoy!

This is the BEST steakhouse off the strip.  And even with that, Echo & Rig has SO much more going for it!

I came here with a 8 adults and 4 kids for my wife's birthday dinner on a very busy Saturday night.  Even though they normally don't take reservations, the manager I spoke with on the phone the day before (Cheryl) was very helpful as I had my eye on the big long striped wooden table that was pictured on their site and they saved it for us.  We arrived a few minutes before and were treated to passed hors d'oeuvres of their homemade salami and smoked chicken.  Yum freakin yum.

With so many small plates offered, Echo & Rig is meant for groups so everything can be shared.  We split 3 salads and they all threw curveballs to the palate.  The kale salad with yellow beets, toasted hazelnuts and goat cheese was really nice.  Their "over the rainbow salad" was an explosion of flavor featuring farro, quinoa, red, yellow & orange bell peppers, corn, red onion, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, almonds, herbs & Champagne vinaigrette.  That's a vegetarian's dream right there.  And the fried spinach salad with red onion, cauliflower, broccoli was fantastic with the chile-lime vinaigrette was probably my favorite of them all.  The crispness of the spinach combined with the heat from the dressing was quite a combination.  

We ordered a bunch of small plates and the standouts for me were the cauliflower with chili de Arbol, crispy shallots and onions and the roasted garlic mashed potatoes with sharp white cheddar but the description didn't do that justice.  It was almost like a super hash brown with a really nice dijon sauce.  I was also able to sample the burnt peas, pumpkin squash, grilled thick cut bacon with bbq sauce (no sauce needed), butcher's sausage and mac and cheese.  All of them were solid options and everything was devoured by the group.  

I got the "Spencer Steak" which was one of the 3 ribeye cuts offered.  Each steak comes with a complimentary sauce and I went with charred onion but sauce just isn't necessary when the meat is awesome.  My medium rare cut was closer to rare but it was probably better that way.  It was everything you wanted in a steak...tender, juicy and flavorful.  My wife's rare filet mignon was cooked perfectly and just got better bite after bite.

Then there's the freakin value of it all!!  The priciest entree is only $35!  NO corkage fee (we brought 3 bottles), NO cake fee (got a cake from Patisserie Manon) and they lit the candles and brought it out.  The total bill for 8 adults and 4 kids came out to what 2 people would spend at Carnevino.  Total Wine and More is just across the way in Boca Park so pick something up there.  

I cannot wait to come back since there are so many other dishes I must try like bone marrow carne asada and Hawaiian cowboy.  I also can't wait for them to bust out their brunch and late night menus.  They also have tables set up on a balcony overlooking the Tivoli Village fountain which would make for a terrific date night.   

The staff was top notch from beginning to end and the experience here wouldn't have been as wonderful as it was without their great work.  They earned their tips and then some! I'm ready to go back for lunch.  

Say hi to the pig heads outside!!

I really enjoy the Sicilian pizza from the Cugino's across town, so when I noticed this location I wanted to check it out. Before walking in, I noticed a sign at the door promoting their current specials. When I saw they offered a 2 slice Sicilian special with drink I knew that would be what I wanted to get. I have been in more than once and the same sign is out front with several different specials on it, but they don't always have them all available. So far each time I have been in (even at dinner time) they don't have any Sicilian ready unless you order a whole pizza. They only have had some regular slices available. When I asked the guy behind the counter about it, he said that it just depends what time you get there and says they sell out quick. If people like it so much why not have more of it ready? Oh well I do agree it's tasty! I ended up getting the 2 slice special with a drink. For just cheese slices it's only $4.99 and with pepperoni it's $5.99 which isn't bad at all. The slices are decent size and like how the crust is thin yet has just the right crispness to it. I have eaten inside, but I have also taken my lunch back to work with me and I like that the pizza is still nice and warm and the crust isn't soggy by the time I drive back and eat it. This is a plus because let's face it, not all take-out tastes the same once you get it home vs. eating it right when you get it. The inside is clean and the employees are friendly. Definitely better than average pizza, so if you are in the area give it try.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 52/100

Stayed in this hotel with my bf for the first time a few weeks ago and absolutely LOVED IT!

I had never heard of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay before. Apparently it's the nicer of the two towers at Mandalay Bay, and consists entirely of suite-style hotel rooms. 

My bf had booked our stay about four months in advance through Expedia, and he only paid around $110 per night for a HUGE suite for the two of us! It was amazing and you definitely get a bang for your buck!

Parking is free, as with most if not all of the hotels in Vegas. The parking garage is HUGE and has stairs, escalators, and elevators. There's also valet parking and a taxi drop off/pick up area.

Check-in was quick and easy. Lines weren't long and it took us around 5 minutes.

Decor/ambience is really great in this hotel. It doesn't really have a theme like a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's just modern, classy, and trendy. I really liked it!

Elevators were kinda confusing since depending on what floor you're on, you have a certain set of elevators you have to take. However, the elevators are AWESOME and INCREDIBLY fast! We stayed on the 20th floor and it only took a few seconds to get from our room down to the lobby and back!

Our suite was AMAZING. There was a living room area that had a couch, desk, chairs, coffee table, and a huge television! There was also a guest bathroom located right by the door if you have people over. It's a 1/2 bath so just a sink and toilet, but still really awesome! There's also a mini-bar area, but make sure you don't touch any of the items there because they are monitored with a weight system, and you are automatically charged for anything you pick up. 

The bedroom area of our room was really nice. We had an incredible king sized bed with a HUGE wall unit that had a TV in the middle, and his and hers closets on either side of it. The closets even had lights inside to see your clothes, and robes, slippers, hangers, etc.!

Our main bathroom was HUGE! It came with two sinks, toilet, a big shower, and a ginormous bathtub that could fit like 3 people in it. My college dorm room was honestly smaller than this bathroom...it was crazy!

The Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson show plays at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. We didn't watch it, but we plan on watching it during one of our future visits! 

The MIX Lounge at the top of the hotel is supposed to be da bomb. We didn't end up going up there but we saw a ton of people waiting in line to go up.

The ONLY things I didn't love about THEhotel were:

1) LACK OF WIFI IN ROOMS. I think they only had ethernet but that is useless when you only have your smart phone and iPad with you.

2) NO REFRIGERATOR IN SUITE. The bf tried to create a makeshift refrigerator with our ice bucket. Didn't really work...

3) LOCATION. That it's on the far south end of the strip. Like literally the last hotel. Fortunately we drove to Vegas so we used our car to drive further up the strip, but if you don't have a car I can imagine it being a huge issue. It's quite a long walk from THEhotel towards the middle/north end of the strip.

I would definitely stay at THEhotel again and highly recommend it! 5 stars!

As they say, "time marches on".

The original POMO was a very special pizzeria, that transported it's diners back to Italy. It was located further south along Scottsdale Road in the Borgata Shopping Center, next to Blanco's. Though small, it had an intimate feel where you could have an easy conversation with you server. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz/pomo-pizzeria-napoletana-scottsdale-2#hrid:DP4ygw0P_5831sjXGX5ecA

The "new" Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria feels like a concept restaurant, sort of like Fox's Olive & Ivy or North, which is not a bad thing. But gone is that old world Italian Grotto elegance and feel. I guess it's only fitting that it's in the former Blooms space. 

Also gone is any mention of POMO's being a certified Napoletana pizzeria, from either APN (Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani) or VPN (Verace Pizza Napoletana). But in truth, the pizzas are still very good and they now have a new, much larger wood fired brick oven. 

The square footage feels three times larger. At times it seems like a dozen or so wait staff are rushing around, delivering pizzas to almost forty tables and that is just inside the restaurant. The outside space is equally large, with a heavy duty tarp covering the diners. I eyed at least two Culinary Managers on the floor keeping track of the staff and food. Nice!
 
The three of us arrived around two o'clock on Black Friday. We were seated pretty quickly, with a good view of the pizza oven. I would highly recommend the location and view. The menu has been updated. And yes it may seem more expensive, given the pricier location near Gainey Ranch and the Hyatt Regency, but it's not. 
http://www.pomopizzeria.com/pomo-scottsdale-menu.pdf. 

I started out by ordering a Cappuccino ($4.00) which was as good as anything I've had at the green mermaid. It had a nice taste but lacked foam. My friends ordered a diet soft drink and a black ice tea, both $2.50. 

Since we remembered how tasty the bruschetta was at the old POMO's we decided to start there. We had the Sorrentina for $7.95 (see photo), which was very good with a hint of garlic. 

Next we decided to share two pizzas. One was their famous Regina Margherita.  It was as tasty and good (though somewhat smaller) as it's predecessor.  I've posted two pictures, a before and after if you will. It was priced at $12.95, same as before.  

The other pizza was their Amatriciana, which comes with saut onions and tiny amount of diced panchetta. It too was very good and priced at $14.95. I believe the key to their delicious tasting pizzas, is the constant and watchful eye as they cook in an over 850 F oven. 

A new addition not found in the old Restaurante, is a grab and go sandwich annex, called "Forno Fabbri, an Italian Market & Mozzarella Bar".  It's to the left as you come into Pomo Cucina and very similar in size and setup to the ones found in Olive and Ivy or the Herb Box. It's a major plus for a quick weekday lunch, one which I will try in the near future. 

Our total for three came to $48.42, including taxes but before gratuities. It seemed fair and the food as I've mention is very good. So Four Stars and yes, we are a Fan of the new Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria. 

Enjoy!

Dating Guide for Dummies, Vol. 4: How to properly club & hit on a group of bodacious bimbos at an A-list Vegas night club.

In this edition of DG for D's, I'm going to cover a premiere Vegas night club and extract it's venue perks towards your benefit.  This is also one of the few clubs where every girl will still look amazing after the lights turn on, so there's no need to rush out.

When you go to a night club, you need to be fresh, look fresh, and feel fresh.  The girls don't get Barbie'd up for nothing in this town so you need to do your part too, but do it with a cool sense of casual-class and finesse.  Down-dress with a nice untucked dress shirt with your sleeves rolled, slim designer jeans, dress shoes other than black, and a loose, solid tie (optional, but highly recommended). 

Now on to the venue, XS is a club where the guys "can" get some loving, but how, you ask?  I feel your pain brother, that's why I wrote this installment.  Main rule of thumb, don't wait in the 2 hour line and don't go in broke.  Even if you manage to walk in with a group of lovely girls, you will need to order drinks.  Your best bet is to cut the line by booking a VIP table and/or cabana with your boys and splitting the costs.  Girls love VIP and they love free bottle service so you're sure to attract a herd of them.  With that said, if you're not hitting it off, limit those skanks to 1 drink or risk getting played.

Did I mention the girls are easy?  For the most part they are.  Trust me, 85% are there to get some sort of action: simple flirting, subtle make out sessions, someone to dance with, or straight answer how they like their eggs in the morning question.  Over easy please.  Stay away from the other 15%, you'll immediately know who they are and don't question the validity of these statistics, it's certified as I've scientifically proven them during my last visit.

Make sure to stay away from any pair of girls since they usually want to dance with themselves, unless they approach you or emit an inviting aura a la cutesy wandering eyes.  Also, steer clear of groups larger than 4 unless you have backup.  There's too much criticism amongst these felines and you'll be heavily scrutinized.  Even if the entire group digs you, it takes one crazy bitch to say stop-no-and-don't to ruin your game.  3 is the magic number fellas, there are less girls to impress and you'll get a chance to charm them up on a more intimate level.  If you happen to cusp one away from her pack, the other two girls will still have each other so she's really not leaving her girls hanging.  Once you do, take her outside to cool off and dance at the shallow end of the pool.  Trust me and get your feet wet, this will show her your fun, adventurous side.

If you arrive a little late, well that's perfect!  The girls are already liquored up from the many guys offering them free drinks.  This is a good thing as these guys haven't read my guide so they're making our jobs easier and cheaper.  They don't call me Dr. Date, aka Mr. Steal-Your-Girl for nothing.  Have no shame, just roll on in and commit a robbery.  Also remember, these girls are already wet from how magnificent the venue is: the euro style dcor and endless stripper poles, flashing lights and fancy limelights, gorgeously-lit pool area and spacious outdoor dance floor, loungy plush-white day beds, and party-rocking-world-class dj's.  XS is really doing us a favor.  You paid for it so use it towards your advantage.

Now go, young padawan, for you have the tools necessary to roam the short skirts of XS.  May good luck and fortune bestow upon you.  And remember kids, what happens in Vegas, stays...except for herpes.  That shit will come home with you.

I went to Del's with my girlfriend on the night of the Restaurant Impossible relaunch, eager to see how the show transformed it. While hectic, the night was a lot of fun and the food was reasonably tasty. The menu was small (as is usual on relaunch night), but had plenty of good choices. There were some high points- the mozzarella sticks, garlic bread and biscotti. As for dinner, I had an average chicken cacciatore, while my girlfriend had chicken parmigiana that was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. She was happy enough with it that she was looking forward to having it again.

The servers were enthusiastic and accommodating, which was impressive considering everything they went through that day. As the night went on, we were both troubled when we overheard the owner complaining to regulars that the show had forced her to severely shrink her menu. She pledged to go back to the old menu once things were back to normal. I couldn't help but wonder why. After all, if you appear on Restaurant Impossible, isn't that a pretty glaring sign that something is wrong with your current menu?

About three months later, we figured that it was time to go back with a couple of friends. As expected, the smaller menu was gone and the bloated original menu was back, plus a few of the Restaurant Impossible dishes. I was dumbfounded by the breadth of choices. In addition to the long list of entrees, Del's also offers pizza and 12 kinds of pasta that can be combined with 13 different sauces. I can't help but think that our meal would have been better if the menu was tightened up.

We started with mozzarella sticks and garlic bread, the strongest parts of the meal. The mozzarella sticks were a tad overdone, but were still very tasty, especially with the accompanying tomato sauce. The strong garlic bread was a welcome change of pace from what often passes for garlic bread elsewhere. Unfortunately, my French onion soup was middling at best. In addition to being very sweet, it had an unappetizing layer of oil on top of the melted cheese. My girlfriend and buddies found their iceberg salads to be mediocre.

The meal continued to go downhill with the entrees. I had gnocchi with butter and garlic sauce. The butter and garlic sauce was flavorful and strong, but the gnocchi were dense and slightly chewy. My girlfriend, pleased with her chicken parmigiana on our first visit, ordered it again and was severely disappointed. The chicken was buried in sauce. I tried it and agreed- the breading was a soggy mess, while the chicken was drier and tougher than on our first visit.

The desserts that we saw floating around looked very good, but we were all far too stuffed from dinner to try anything. Del's portions are huge, which they charge accordingly for. As it is, I think the large portions are meant to counteract the middling quality of the food. Three out of the four of the people in our party had enough leftovers for another full meal.

The restaurant itself is still bright and clean, just as it was on relaunch night. Service was well-paced, friendly, and honest. The food and menu need work, though. Cut out some of the dead weight on the menu and give the staff the opportunity to focus on creating better quality dishes. I'm sure Del's doesn't want to shake things up too much for fear of losing their regulars... but if they fail to change, they're never going to create any new regulars.

My favorite buffet in VEGAS!!! 

I came here close to when it opened years ago and remembered loving it and finally got a chance to return and i was happy it was still as good as i remember. 

Off the strip, i came here with my family after outlet shopping on a wednesday lunch. We heard about a senior deal for people over 50, but unfortunately THEY ENDED THE SENIOR DEAL. Still, it's a great deal as we only paid $16.00 per person and they have one of the biggest selections and also UNLIMITED WINE AND BEER AND GELATO!!!

PRICES: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=aVc7XXpYbfEx0zQX1169bA

Breakfast M-F 7am-10:30 $11
Lunch M-F 10:30-2:30 $16
Dinner M-Th 4pm-9pm $24
Seafood Brunch Sat/Sun 9am-2:30pm  $34
Seafood Dinner  Fri: 4pm-10pm $34
                               Sat/Sun 2:30-10pm $34

Recommendation: Go for a late breakfast and stay for lunch items, which is plenty of food!

If u want crab legs, don't bother going during the weekday lunches (not sure if they have it during weekday dinners) cuz they dont' have any.

BUT, there's so much stuff! Everything was pretty good except for the sushi, which was terrible that day. Really hard rice! :(
However, i enjoyed DESSERT the best as you can see from my pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=-2R7iQN7p-BTqDGQACzHXA
Creme Brulee, meringue cookies, carrot cake, RV cupcakes, panna cotta, tiramisu, mousse cake, chocolate cake. GELATO of many kinds, tarts, 

MEATS: Brisket, ribs, tri tip, pork loin,ham

Others: small selection of chinese food/mediterranean/mexican /indian.mussels, seafood ciopinno, shrimp scampi, baked ziti, BACON, fried shrimp, fried mushrooms, fried chicken, mash, asparagus, sweet potatoes with marshmallows, cream corn and spinach 

Sad to see some of the prices have hiked up since i originally went, but i would definitely recommend this place if ur tired of waiting in huge long lines and paying the same price or more and getting charged extra for drinks. 

Located in the M Resort- that blue building u see off to the right before you get to the strip. A great place to stop on the way home!

Have you often wondered why so many middle-aged  Japanese people here in Las Vegas always tell you that they go to SUSHI ON RAINBOW for sushi instead of the multi-million dollar bankrolled sushi restaurants like Kabuto or Goyemon? Why do these former or current Japanese nationals prefer to eat at an older sushi bar that doesn't have fancy or exciting dcor? The answer is that SUSHI ON RAINBOW to MANY of us people of Japanese descent is actually a symbol of pride for our community. And, the owner is a very respected man to us Japanese-Americans.

When I was a little kid in Southern California, I first heard about Shogo-san and the famous sushi restaurant in Newport Beach. Sushi just did not exist in the area. Everytime a sushi restaurant poped up, it would quickly go out of business. Remember that sushi, and the idea of eating raw fish was not accepted by the American mainstream back then. The sushi bar that Shogo worked at was the only sushi bar in the area that had made it. Japanese people would drive 50+ miles just to eat there. Shogo-San was one of the 1st generation sushi chefs, along with the famous Ichiro Mashita who came to America from Japan with a dream to one day popularize sushi in America. They had to endure so much hardships during those days, but like most Japanese and Asian-Americans during that era, they fought hard to find success in the land of opportunity. Today, there is a Sushi bar on every street due to their labor. So, when I found out that Shogo had purchased SUSHI ON RAINBOW from the original owner, I was ecstatic! A great legend of California Sushi was now here in Las Vegas! This was a dream come true. 

Shogo-san has over 40 years of Sushi experience. During his youth in Kyushu, he was a very respected edo style sushi chef. Went through years of apprenticeship before he even get the opportunity to the touch the actual fish. Today, his years of experience really shows. Though the majority of his day revolves around making California Rolls for westerners, there is also a "secret menu" for those who appreciate real sushi. What I love is how every week they got something different. I've had an Edo Chirashizushi, Shinko, Engawa, a Uni-Ika mix, Maguro no Zuke, Yamaimo, and many other traditional Japanese dishes that aren't in any other J-restaurant in town. Every time I eat here I feel even more proud to have Japanese blood in my veins. 

Unlike most sushi bars in LV, SUSHI ON RAINBOW get's all it's items from true Japanese and Japanese-American distributors. The fish is from a real Japanese seafood distributor(not a Korean distributor), that get's their fish from cold waters such as Canada, and Alaska. Fish from colder waters will have meat that has more of that fatty marbling that we enjoy so much. Even the Japanese ice creams(plum wine, green tea) come from a famous Japanese ice cream company in Torrance.  

If you are a true sushi lover, the 1st thing you will notice is how Shogo's nigiri technique is unrealistically perfect compared to the other Sushi joints in town. Remember that he has had over 40 years experience. You will see immediately that even the chefs at Kabuto don't have his precision. And the funniest thing is that Shogo is very humble + modest and doesn't even brag about how great he is.

There used to be a guy named Hiro-san who worked here who was also a former edomaezushi chef from Japan.  Holy crap, that guy was like the best chef I had ever seen. But, he retired a few months ago. That totally depressed the hell out of me. 

Kyuu-chan is their new apprentice sushi chef. He is of Chinese descent but he makes a lot of Japanese chefs look like amateurs due to his amazing talent. Shogo is such a a hardcore Japanese man, that he made Kyuu learn how to speak Japanese to be a chef here. He also made the Latino cooks in the back learn Japanese, or they couldn't work. It's the coolest thing ever! There is so much old school Japanese discipline in this kitchen. But, Shogo himself is such a friendly and positive guy. You can talk to him for hours. And the coolest thing about him is that he knows everything about Japanese history and pop culture! I've had the most fascinating conversations with him.

I love coming to SUSHI ON RAINBOW and showing my respect to these great Japanese heroes. Also, every time I come here it's like that scene in "Goodfellas" when Robert DeNiro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they get him whatever he wants, and they even got a spot saved for him. I NEVER order here, all I say is "Omakase" and they take care of everything for me. 

I've written 100s of Yelp reviews, but SUSHI ON RAINBOW is my absolute favorite restaurant in not just Las Vegas, but the whole world.

I never have been a huge fan of Johnny Rocket's, so when I found out The Wiener's Circle would be taking the spot JR was in, I was happy. A lot of the signs say it's near the bowling alley when it's actually closer to the doors near the buffet. I have enjoyed my experience at The Wiener's Circle inside Red Rock, but there is something about this location inside Santa Fe that was just better to me. If you are familiar with the original The Wiener's Circle in Chicago, then you know they have a different attitude when it gets dark. Here at this location they don't sling any insults (they play games with customers and sling expected insults at the original location after a certain hour even handing out free food and shirts sometimes) or play any games, but what I have experienced is great customer service. The guy who took my order was very nice and patient while I went over the menu. He also told me about different combo deals that include fried and a drink. I have to give them props as far as the menu prices go. Being in a casino usually means marked up prices and sometimes not the same product you'd expect, but I found the prices to be fair and the food tasted great. I've been back a few times now and will be back plenty more! 

Char Dog - I got the combo priced at $6.99 that came with fries and a drink. The dog had onions, relish, mustard, pickles, tomatoes, peppers and celery salt. I asked that the dog be lightly charred and that's exactly what I got. The cook even came over to our table to make sure I liked it. I had them add cheese to my fries and the cheese sauce is thick and delicious! I could eat a huge pile (they already give you 1/2 pound with your order) of just those fries covered in cheese and my taste buds would be happy. 

Chicken Fingers - As a combo it was $7.99 with fries and a drink. They also give you a choice of mustard, ranch and honey mustard to dip your fingers. I really like the honey mustard here it goes well with the fingers. The fingers didn't look to plump or appetizing when I first saw them, but they really had good flavor and the chicken tasted good enough with out any sauce to dip, but trust me and pair it with the honey mustard. 

Wieners in a Blanket  - These were $4.99 and tasty little bites! They come 6 to an order, but when I got my order I noticed I had 8 of them. Score! You can choose a dipping sauce for these so I obviously chose honey mustard. I don't think these would fill someone alone, but they make a great snack to share along with your meal or nice portion for a kids meal. 

They have booths and tables or you can get your food to-go.

I stopped in here for dinner and wasn't disappointed. It's inside Doc Holliday's if you can really say that since it seems more of a next door neighbor to the bar. I figured I would be walking through the bar to get to Maribel's and you can, but the door I went into led me straight inside Maribel's. Hubby and I were greeted right away and told to sit wherever we wanted. Our server was excellent! She got our drink order and brought us some chips and salsa right away. I usually like chunky salsa and this salsa was thin, but it had a lot of good, fresh flavor and the chips were tasty. For $3.99 I ordered a side of Chips and Guacamole and my oh my was it so good! It was made fresh to order and had such great flavor. I'm very impressed at the price of the chips and guac considering it was fresh and the portion was good. If you are a fan of guacamole you must try it here at Maribel's! They have daily specials for just $5 that includes a drink. 

Monday - Chicken Enchiladas 
Tuesday - Carne Asada Tacos
Wednesday - Fish Tacos
Thursday - Carne Asada Burrito
Friday - Chicken Sub
Saturday - Shredded Beef Burrito
Sunday - Hamburger or Cheeseburger

I was there on a Tuesday, so I decided to go with the Carne Asada Tacos. You get 3 tacos, rice, beans and a drink. If you want flour tortillas you can also get that for no additional charge, but you get 2 tacos instead of 3 and our sever said they are bigger than the regular ones. Options are nice! The asada had good flavor and the tacos were filled nicely, especially for the price. The beans were good and the rice was even better. It's awesome that you can get quality food that tastes so good for $5 plus tax and leave stuffed. Inside was clean and they have TV's. I can't say enough about our server. She checked on us often and took the time to chit chat with us for a bit letting us know about other specials and I could tell she was genuinely passionate about the food being served here. They even take phone orders if you don't have time or want to eat inside. I saw several people picking up to-go orders. I don't live in the neighborhood that Maribel's is in, but when I am on this side of town, I will definitely be stopping by for some good grub!

I never thought that I would have such a horrifying experience at this club, which I've been to a handful of times in the past. I came to celebrate my birthday with my cousins and things were fine until around midnight when we took a break from dancing. We were outside near the bar and gambling tables when I noticed a security guard talking to one of my cousins (I'll refer to him as K). I stepped in to make sure everything was ok because the guard looked pretty intense. When I inquired, the guard said that K had a flask and wouldn't turn it over. (This was true because we had asked him to bring one--although he actually didn't even use it!) The guard said he had to leave, so I said we were sorry and we would all go with him. Yes, these things happen and I knew we were wrong for bringing the flask. When I said we were going, too, the guard said we couldn't go with him, but we could meet him somewhere. I grabbed a few of my cousins and we just hurried through the club as the guard led him away. Then another guard came by to help escort him (K was compliant and it seemed unnecessary to have two guards, but whatever. We just hurried up to make sure we could be with him.). Anyone who has been to clubs and has gotten asked to leave knows that it is normal and expected for your group to go with you to make sure everything is ok. But when we reached the elevators to go down, they wrenched him away from us and now there were six guys. Four were in the elevator with him, pinning him against the wall. We asked the two men in front of the elevator, who were blocking us from him, why we couldn't go with him. We said that we didn't want to cause any problems, but we just needed to know he would be ok. My cousin tried to have the manager let her in, but he pushed her back.  K started calling for help because they were hurting him. We could see that the four guards had him slammed against the wall and were starting to choke him out to keep him from calling to us. I can still see the fear in his eyes and I will never forget the sounds of his voice. He was so scared and we were so helpless, trying to just protect him from whatever was about to happen. K is the sweetest kid, and he was compliant.  He was not drunk or belligerent. They were using unnecessary force and they wouldn't even tell us where they were taking him and why 4-6 men were needed to make him leave. He struggled against them only when they started hurting him and choking him. We left the club and asked the front door bouncer what we should do next and where we could find him. He advised us to go back to our hotel because they would most likely put him in a cab. But it was so suspicious that we couldn't just leave with him! It's as if they didn't want us to witness what they were doing, which was using unnecessary force for no good reason. We left for our hotel and told the rest of our family to wait there to see if they would release him, which they did about 20-30 minutes later. 

When K came back, he told us what happened. He had been choked out (there were red marks all over his neck) and he was holding a paper towel covered in his blood. He had woken up on the floor near a back elevator of the hotel because they had choked him out to the point of a black-out. If that wasn't traumatizing enough, the guards asked him repeatedly what he remembered. He was alone and afraid, and although he remembered every horrific moment of their abuse, he was afraid to say a word of it. He knew it'd make it worse and they'd probably keep him longer...so he said he didn't recall. And they implied that he had probably accidentally hit his head or fell and passed out somehow. But the truth is they did it! They feigned ignorance and pretended to play nice at that point to cover up their dirty deed. They got him a paramedic to clean up all the blood on his face and hands...there was even drops of his blood on the floor. He cried when he told us because he was so traumatized.  My heart truly broke for him and I was so appalled at this wrongdoing. It could have happened to any of us! It has probably happened before to other people...people who were compliant and didn't want any trouble, just like K. We knew we had to try to do something to correct this huge injustice and act of violence, so we called the Cosmopolitan hotel to file a formal complaint. Then we called the LV police. They sent two officers to our room to take down a report. Neither acts yielded any progress. I felt that we got brushed off as if this incident wasn't important. I cannot believe that nothing can be done. I fear for everyone's safety that goes to Marquee now. I will never set foot in this club again. I advise that no one else go here either. What happened is so wrong, and I plead with you to spread the word about this injustice. Please do not give this place your business.

Had the most Mind blowing Experinece here!

This place rocks!  Seriously they have hundreds of gems, fossils, rocks etc etc. I wish they were closer to get to.

So my friend Dawn R. who flew in from Portland for the Yelp Spring Break had been looking for 6 gems for a Feng Shui thing in the living room.  Everything on the internet was just a online store and not a business that you could walk into.  When it comes to gems and minerals you want to hold and see.  Think about a diamond for example.  Wouldn't you rather see it and touch in person before buying!   Well the Yelp Ap came to the rescue again.  

This place is on the outskirts of downtown and easy to get to.  I wasn't sure want to expect since there was less than 10 reviews but WHOA when we walked in it was like DAYUM.  They have A LOT of stuff.  They have the place organized by the minerals, gems and fossils in the front.  When you go to the back you can find even more minerals, gems in all type of sizes and shapes and even a sections of beads.  Another smaller room where they have Buddhist statues.  I was totally impressed with the amount of items this place carries.

I personally was not looking for anything in particular.  I was looking at some pendulum and I tried out a few.  There was one answering me even when I was not holding it so I getting it.   I also purchased a Moldavite http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavite.  Something I had never heard of until that day.  I was curious to know more about it and Miguel was the one who took the time to explain what it was and how people use it.  Being that I had by Reiki 1 & 2 done and he was a Reiki Master and had also done theta healing I knew exactly what he was talking about in terms of energy work.  I could totally feel the warmth from this one gem from holding it in my hand.  I felt like what one may feel when having a hot flash.  It was pretty odd how this little gem was giving off that much energy.  There are only 3-4 mines and it is estimated that it will all be gone in the less than 10 years so I thought I should get one.   So I picked a pendant http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jMrpr92nMEhe4cC4FF00VQ?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#hddvoHue4g2iC-Tv6KuvRA and a chain I like and put it on.  The pendant sat right between my heart and throat chakra and I could immediately feel the warmth in my chest area.   

Now this is when things got interesting.  As we were checking out, Miguel had left to the back room to grab a bag for my pendulum.  When he returned he told me to put out both hand and close my eye.  Hmmm that is a strange request but I obliged.  He then put a good size spirit quartz in both hands and told me to hold on an feel.  I seriously never ever ever felt so much energy and vibration coming from gem before.  It was so intense my hands were shaking.  It shot up through my arms and straight to my chest and was pounding right were the Moldavite pendulum lay.  I was totally speechless and all that came out of my mouth was Oh Shit, Oh my goodness, Oh Damn Oh my god etc etc.   A minute or so into it Miguel proceeds to share with me a message from my spirit guide to not be so hard on myself and to take things slowly and to take my time.  With the massive energy and vibration going through me and what I was hearing I teared up big time.  This was so unexpected and a great surprise.  It was one of the most amazing experience I had in a store!!!  Now this is not to be expected with every person that comes in but I was totally opened to it and was ready for it and so I welcomed it.  Freaking amazing.   I was feeling that energy pretty much all day, it was freaking great!!!! 

Anywho, if your' looking to buy a few pieces for feng shuei or maybe even by a Moldavite and you happen to be visiting sin city you have got to stop by this place.  It's a gem of a place!

Locale ~ Downtown 
Offerings ~ Gems, Minerals, Jewelry, Statues
Extras ~ Ask for Miguel,  He is very knowledgeable and helpful!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 39/100

My boyfriend and I were on a mission to try all of the Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas this weekend! BurGR was our second stop of the trip!

BurGR is located literally right inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel. SUPER easy to get to from the lobby! They have this AWESOME glass window display with a metal structure emitting a bunch of flames all over it. It's really interesting and a great storefront display! They also have a bunch of Gordon Ramsay merchandise at the front such as t-shirts, cookbooks, glasses, etc.

We were able to walk right in and get seated immediately. However, a few minutes after we had been sitting at our table, I looked over to the front of the restaurant and there was a HUGE line! We got super lucky that there was nobody there when we entered at around 11:15am.

The decor of this place is super trendy, modern, and basically a sports bar with all of the large screen TVs on all of the walls displaying football and other popular sports. There are also lots of flames everywhere (I'm assuming are related to Hell's Kitchen) and a photo of Gordon Ramsay.

Waiter service was great, as usual. Our waiter immediately came to us and asked if we wanted to take a look at the drink menu, which is an iPad 2 that they give you to look at. It is an interactive menu that has all of the drinks sorted by category (beers, cocktails, red/white wine, etc.), descriptions of each drink, and even photographs. There's also a tab with Gordon Ramsay's biography and photograph, which I thought was pretty cool.

We ordered two waters, a cup of coffee, and then took a look at the menus. The menus were pretty amusing because they, too, had a giant photo of Gordon Ramsay that surprises you when you first order them :P

My bf and I ended up sharing the Shake #4 - creme brulee pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie. THIS WAS AMAZING! I had seen photos of the shakes on Yelp and was curious to try them because I've never had a shake infused with pudding before. Thanks to this shake, I am a HUGE fan of the pudding + shake combination from now on :) So yummy! The two flavors look separated (with creme brulee on top and oreo on the bottom), but surprisingly when you sipped on it, the flavors were combined and complimented each other very well. I would love to come back to try the other 4 combinations!

As for burgers, I ordered the Uber Cheese Burger (fontina cheese + raclette cheese + goat cheese), and my boyfriend got the American burger (american cheese + butter lettuce + tomato + pickle + onion). As a HUGE cheese lover, my burger was absolutely PERFECT for me! It was literally just the patty + 3 types of cheese, which was exactly what I wanted. My bf nearly inhaled his American burger and said it was super good. We unfortunately decided to skip out on getting fries because we didn't have the appetite to eat that much food! I would definitely like to come back to try the truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries.

When we received our bill, we were given an iPod that had a little survey/questionnaire for us to answer based on our dining experience at BurGR. The Yelp Elite in me naturally reached for this and began answering the questions like crazy :P I thought it was pretty cool how much they integrated the use of iPads and iPods at their restaurant!

Overall, 5 stars for a really trendy, hip atmosphere, great service, and delicious food! I would love to come back during my next visit to Vegas! :)

They say, you can never go home, or go back. Well, I've never bought into that. 

Over the years, we've been in almost a dozen or so Chart Houses. Sadly, many have closed due to whatever corporate reorg was going on at the time. I miss the ones in Steamboat and Newport, RI the most. Great locations and views. 

So it was with some excitement that we made reservations here for Easter Sunday dinner. Surprisingly, we have never been to this location.

We arrived a few minutes before six and found our hostess in a middle of a hiccups fit. I offered to frighten her but she decline. I guess I was scary enough. LOL

There was also some confusion over our reservations, but it didn't last long. We were escorted to our table, over by the window with a magnificent view of the lake. You got to give Chart House credit for choosing some great locations!

We started with a glass of Merlot and Pinot each. Both were very good for house wines. We also opted for the salads, the warm bacon dressing was delicious, as was the Caesar.

Things started slowly declining from here. I asked about getting their Callahan Prime Rib End Cut ($33.99). Seems the kitchen couldn't make up their minds if they had one. 

First it was no, then yes and finally surprise, they delivered a regular cut. It was tasteless with no flavor at all. When we were paying I mentioned it to our server, all they could say was, "oh yeah."  Grrr. LOL. The other entree was their Beef Tenderloin Medallions ($31.99) which was very good. 


For dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake to share with some coffee. It came damaged and somewhat of a mess. LOL. See our photo, versus the Chart House one. Our waiter apologized saying they should have been picked it up sooner. (Okay, why didn't you bring us another one?). 

The current owners of Chart House is Landry, a very classy and sharp organization.  I would suggest they work on this location before they need to close this one too. 

Our bill, including two glasses of wine ran us $80.00 a person, including taxes and gratuities. 

Now why didn't we go to Capital Grill I wonder?  Well, maybe next time.

For a positive review of a Chart House, I call your attention to my friend Norm's recent experience in Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz/forte-european-tapas-bar-and-bistro-las-vegas?hrid=Gpo-2lh59Bru8sKqgRm5Hw

When you combine the quality of ingredients, service and tremendous value, Soho is a place worth coming back to again and again.  Dinner for 4 came out to around $60 before tip and we got to try a nice variety of dishes.

It was easy to see and taste the high grade fish they used right off the bat in the "Seared Tuna Special" which included crispy shallots, sweet onion, micro greens and chili oil combined with super fresh nigiri cuts of maguro.  This was a terrific mix of flavors.  $11!  That's about 50% off the strip price.  I almost wished I didn't have to share it.  

I couldn't turn my back on the $3 (!!) Soho Tostadas and went with the tuna with Hawaiian poke sauce.  The tostada itself was made of taro and there were some delicious chunks of tuna on top mixed with cilantro and avocado cream.  Another great starter for sure.  The rock shrimp done tempura style was also nice portion for $7 and came with 3 unique sauces that I fail to remember the details of since my wife was seriously sweating the end of the Seahawks/Rams Monday night game due to some sports bets she had.  It was nice they had one TV up.

Hydro Bibb Black Cod for $5 was a total freakin tease that ensured I'll get a full order of miso marinated black cod the next time.  Even the smaller portioned cod were cooked really well and the combo of cool lettuce, crispy wontons and fish was kind of like a deluxe protein taco.  

Those all were excellent opening acts for what I was personally here for which was the short rib dish.  Ever since I saw that one picture of all those short ribs being grilled, I knew it was destiny!  It totally delivered.  The one rib was like something out the The Flintstones and tasted as good as it looked.  It was juicy and so tender that you could've just picked at it with chopsticks sans fork and knife.  

The chef and owner of Soho, John Chien Lee, stopped by our table to ask how things were and gave us a breakdown on the business.  We were still open to one more dish so I asked him for a recommendation.  He asked what we liked and we said salmon.  He asked if we wanted something cooked or raw and we said raw.  He said he'd make something special for us off the menu (YES!) and 10 minutes later brought over this delectable dish with 8 pieces of scallop wrapped with salmon topped with a little green, lemon and some other stuff I can't remember.  John whipped up this dish thinking it would be a great finish to the meal after the heaviness of the short rib and MAN was he right.  Then he told us it was on the house!  Thanks, John!!  I suck for not taking photos of anything.  

Las Vegas strip quality for locals!  Check it out.

First and foremost this is my first review and I cant believe how absolutely appalled I am.  But, here it goes.....So my wife and I are in town for a family emergency and decided to have lunch because we had a lil time on our hands. We drove past HAG on LV blvd and it caught my eye because of the name and I love a great burger. Upon entering I was excited and looking forward to it the place seems almost like a Hooters but for Burgers. The smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicky for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear items that others have wore before but I figured hey WTH the waitress we had was very personable and  nice but was new. the prices were very high for such a simple menu. My wife ordered the smallest burger and fries and I was talked into the Quad bypass burger. with like 20 strips of bacon! I asked our waitress if the restaurant offered military discount as I often do when I am on a budget and travelling. She said "Let me ask" upon returning she said "No sorry" I was thanked her for asking. Either way I though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so I was looking forward to the food regardless. At this point I was very excited and amused on the place and was talking to my wife about how this place should/would be a goldmine. They offered malt liquor (Strange in a restaurant)in a can I ordered a Tecate she a sugar Coke.
Now for the twist of events..... Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes which is great but I was skeptical, The Burger was massive and looked so good but it was warm to the touch at best I had approx 3 bites and noticed the bacon looked as if had been microwaved from being cooked days ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistency-(Gross) The cheese was not melted, The fries looked like they were cooked in old oil due to the almost black color in nature. I tried my hardest to stomach this but I couldnt. I proceeded to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cooked to order at first she replied yes and then said something that made me raise an eyebrow, she began on informing me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old because of the way the owner is. I asked her to elaborate and she said he is so cheap that he makes his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut costs. She also informed me she almost walked out her second day on the job because of what he acts like in his day to day operations. She looked excited when I asked to speak to him about the quality and preparation of my food. When the Owner/manager Jon came to the table he sat down opposite from me and was very hostile. At this point I was pretty much amazed I would assume he would address my concerns in a professional and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimidation and apprehension. I said I would please like another burger due to the dissatisfaction of it not being fresh. He looks at myself and my wife and says' " In six years I have never comped a meal and it won't be today!!" I proceeded to inform him I simply wanted another burger and I am not looking for a comp. He then informed us that he would call the police if we didnt pay I said I would not pay for a burger like this especially one that i didnt touch. From his demeanor at this point I wanted to leave so i said look I will pay for my wifes and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this quality of food.
At this point I felt threatened and was basically being held against my own will. I said fine Please call the police. He proceeds to lean over and say, You know what " you started it when you asked for a discount" I was like "What"? He then says I cant stand the "F" ing military I was so appalled that he was addressing me like this in general and then he begins to say, I'm from Oxnard, Ca. and we used to beat the "S" out of filthy mexicans like you! At this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief He leaves and the table next to me were also expressing there disgust in the food and as he saw us speaking with them he said to leave right now we were trespassing! As I leave I attempt to tip my waitress and he rips the money from my hand! My wife and I wait outside for the police THE WHOLE TIME WE are waiting quietly the owner is harrassing us going on a tirade about my race and my occupation being totally distasteful in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up (LVPD) I provide them ID and they are in absolute disbelief they resolve the issue after questioning and bottom line it does not matter the police officer said I had to pay I totally understand and uphold the law but requested that I receive what I pay for (At least I gave it away to a homeless man.
BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: 1. DO NOT GO THERE FOR QUALITY OR FRESHNESS  IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS NOT 2. THE OWNER IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING. 3.YOU ARE WARNED. PLEASE DONT BE ROBBED OR DEGRADED LIKE ME  GO ANYWHERE ELSE.

I had my hopes up for this place. Walking in it seemed like a fun atmosphere, but quickly it felt like more of a tourist attraction. From the start our server was trying to get us to buy raffle tickets. It didn't stop there. When she would check on us, she was saying things like "if you like the taste of that, we sell it in our gift shop" and at the end of the meal even asked if she could walk with us to the gift shop (we told her that we didn't want to go earlier and thanked her for the info) to pick somethings out so she could meet her goal since she was in the lead for some sort of competition with the other employees for work. To put people on the spot so many times is rude. Ask once and if the customer is interested they will tell you! 

What encouraged us to come here was because I have family here in town that is hosting an exchange student from Germany and I thought she would not only like this place, but maybe feel a bit of home. We sat at nice long table that is shared with the other customers. I don't personally like that, but that's the theme here so it was fine. There was live music being played which was cool. 

Priced at $19.99 we started out with the "Sausage Tower" at the suggestion of our server. She said it was a "hidden" menu item since it isn't on the menu and it would give us a good taste of the different sausages they have. Sounded good to me! When it arrived, it looked like a tower of heaven. There were 3 dishes. 1 dish had chicken bratwurst, pork sausage and veal bratwurst on a bed of sauerkraut. The 2nd dish had krainer, grilled weisswurst and a frankfurter with potato salad. The 3rd dish had 2 fresh baked pretzels with 2 types of dipping sauces. Of all the sausages I only really liked the taste of a couple of them, so it was nice to be able to sample it all instead of just ordering a certain sausage dish that I might have had a type of sausage in it that I wasn't to find of. The pretzels were pretty good and the mustard sauces had good flavor. For my meal I had priced at $4.95 a "House Salad" and priced at $14.95 the "Grillhendl" which is a chicken dish. The salad was average, but the chicken dish was above average. The chicken was roasted and stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions. The chicken was crispy and had a good flavor. It also came with a side of potato salad that was decent. 

I certainly didn't leave hungry! I didn't leave feeling like I would come back though either. The vibe inside just screamed "gimmick" and "tourist attraction here" which our guest from Germany agreed. The server was just too pushy about trying to get us to buy different things. My husbands meal was a joke especially for the price, so I lucked out with the chicken dish I ordered. I'm glad I experienced Hofbruhaus at least once.

I'm in Las Vegas with my father for one night (don't ask, we're not getting married or any sick Red state shit like that) and I refuse to eat where we are staying because as much as I love me some free room service, I cannot handle when my only choice on the menu is a STEAMED VEGETABLE PLATTER.  that is right.  it is a platter of steamed vegetables and a scoop of white rice.  just typing that sentence makes me want to get sick all over this computer.  now, you might be thinking, "Laura, aren't you on Weight Watchers?" and to that I say, "Fuck you."  

So anyway, I decide we're going to be adventurous and take a trip off the strip to a mostly vegetarian restaurant that I've been to before called Long Life Vege.  It's about a ten minute cab ride away, it's cheap and they have delicious fake meat.  Delicious.  While my dad may hate fake meat product, there is nothing the man loves more than cheap (the dude likes to be told how much you spent on his birthday present and if it's under $10 he will be all, "HIGH FIVE!" Once, my sister got him a pair of toe nail clippers from Mac Frugal's (RIP) for 99 cents and the man shed a tear.  HE CRIED, HE WAS SO PROUD) so we were in a cab faster than you can say, "faux chicken chow mein."  Well, our cabbie was a delightful chap from Somalia who was very affable and talkative and when he asked why we were going to a vegetarian restaurant, my dad said, "Because this one's a VEGAN!  Hahaha!' and they laughed and laughed.  Good one, you guys!  It IS hilarious when someone is vegan!  HAR DEE FUCKING HAR HAR.

we pull up to Long Life Vege and the motherfucker is closed.  GODDAMMIT.  we ask our cabbie for restaurant recommendations and he suggests Merkato since it is nearby and he is a regular.  We get to Merkato and as we are getting out of the cab, both my dad and I realize that we forgot our wallets.  Well, actually, my dad forgot his wallet and I "forgot" mine, you dig?  I ain't paying when money bags is around!  I wrangle dogs for a living and my father gets hundred dollar bills poured on his head just for waking up.  Plus, there will be no social security left for me when i'm old and I gotta save NOW!  and by save NOW!, i mean buy that new ipod phone because it's SWEET!  do you think it comes in pink??

We take a cab back to the hotel, my dad get his wallet, takes out another $100 from the ATM and we drive back to Merkato.  The cab is $45 at this point so my dad gives the guy what he thinks is $70 because he has put up with our insanity for the evening.  You're saying to yourself, "Who gives a fuck, Laura?" And to that I say, "Wait for it. You will get a mild satisfaction at the end but it's probably still not worth reading the whole long ass review."

We walk into Merkato and are the only non-Ethiopian people in the place and it's crazy crowded.  Both VERY good signs for potential deliciousness.  I order the veggie combo (which was a very typical veggie combo: yellow lentils, red lentils, mustard greens, enjera salad, etc) and it was MAGNIFICENT.  One of the best i've had and I've had A LOT.  my dad got the dead lambert and said the flavor was fantastic but there was too much fat and gristle.  now, contrary to popular belief, i haven't always been vegan.  i used to eat meat and let me tell you, i liked the grossest meat.  tendons and gristle and marrow...i mean, i would CLEAN a chicken bone and then use a splinter to pick my teef.  i was a hardcore red neck of an obese 9 year-old until i figured out i was eating bambi.  ANYWAY, if you are currently like i was when i was 9 years-old, then get the lamb and when you're done, have your cholesterol checked because i'm pretty sure you're gonna drop dead at any moment.  

So, we finish our fantastic meal about 15 hours after we first walked in (that's how they roll in Ethiopia.  Slowly.  But friendly.  Like this review.) and as he's paying, my dad realizes that instead of the $30 tip he thought he left our lovable cabbie, he gave him $115 tip.  MY DAD'S BAD!  we also realized that we had no way back to the hotel. luckily when i asked our waitress to call us a cab, she was all, "hold on" and disappears.  two minutes later, a guy who was eating a few tables over has us in his cab, headed back to the hotel.  Major bonus.

In the end, we're dealing with:

Cab rides: $135.  
Dinner: $25 (for two HUGE plates plus two beers and tea)
Average Cost of Dinner for Two People in Las Vegas in Some Cheesy Rip Off Restaurant On The Strip: $200.  

So anyway, I think we still did good.  And there's a cab driver (Yasin!  Holla!) who is high rolling tonight.  Or, you know, sending money back to his family in his war torn country.  As my dad put it, his company is paying and screw those jerkwads, the better man (Yasin! Holla!) wins tonight!  I love my dad.  

I am finally done, you can rest your eyes.  Get up, stretch, do some squats, get the blood flowing...you've been here awhile.

SHUT IT DOWN!

I was incredibly disappointed when we went to grab dinner here last night. Chef Ramsey would have been so upset at the lack of customer respect. It was like they really didn't care. And I found this unacceptable. 

The hostess took us to our table which was a very cool table but it was not very comfortable for our group to have dinner at. It was so low, that there was no way we could even eat or cut our meat. If we were just drinking then we would have hung out here all night. I asked the hostess for a booth, which was right next to the original table. 

She told me that the 4 empty booths were reserved and we couldn't sit there. I asked the hostess how embarrassed would she be if we sat at the uncomfortable table and no one showed up for those 4 booths in the next hour.  She ignored me and didn't respond. 

She then told me that this was the only table we could have. The sad part is that 60% of the tables were empty and she refused to seat us anywhere else.  I told her I wanted to speak to the manager. She went back to the hostesses station told the other girl and the second hostess rolled her eyes. Honestly I'm the customer.  I don't need to see that. The hostess made a phone call to the manager, who never picked up his phone.  She then went in the back and when she came back she gave us one of the booths we had requested. Wow! What changed?

First, why did it take me 10 minutes to get a booth in a restaurant that was only 40% full. Secondly, I asked to speak to the manager and the manager never came out. Why? Completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Really where is the manager and why didn't he come over to talk to us. 

On a side note: At 10:22pm, we were seated and at 12:19am the booths were still empty.  In fact, nobody ever sat in any of those booths for almost 2 hours. It became apparent that the hostess completely lied to us by telling us they were reserved. Who is training the staff to act like this?

Plus we sat at our table with no service for about 10 minutes. I believe the hostesses probably thought it was funny to send no one over.  We all discussed leaving but decided to stay. 

At 11:52pm all of the lights went full blast, during our meal. It was so bright it hurt our eyes. I spoke to the guy cleaning the tables and he went to speak to the manager and the lights went back down after 5 minutes.  We were just trying to finish our dinner. He came back and said, "the manager had no idea who turned all the lights on!" I think the manager might need a visit from GR and he may have his lights turned on. The waitress told us the lights go full blast every night at that time. I think it must be on a timer, like last call for alcohol. But it should not blast all the lights in the dinning areas. It was not a fun feeling as we ate our dinners. 

My first drink didn't look like the picture in the iPad menu. And I was told by the waitress that the drinks never look like the photos in the iPad. Then why do we have photos of the drinks in the iPad? Again this is wrong and not right. GR would be screaming at someone. 

I went to order another drink at 12:00am but was informed that the bar was closed. I said really and why didn't someone tell us it was last call. There was no response. I told the waitress that I was just having a wheat beer and it shouldn't be a problem to pour a pint. All the bartenders were still there. She went to ask and came back with my pint but I noticed that the Orange slice was missing and about an inch of beer was also missing.  I asked where was the orange slice (this beer is suppose to come with it) and I was told that it was wrapped in Saran Wrap and put away. I asked her to grab me a slice and she said that it wouldn't be possible. Why is this dinner so painful?

I'm so mad that I haven't even got to reviewing the food yet.  The best thing we had here was the fingerling potatoes. It was a side dish but it was the star of the show. My buddy was not happy with his lamb. It was covered in a cheese and he felt it was over powering. I liked my PEI mussels and clams but didn't love them. They came with chorizo, carmelized fennel and lemon zest. I've had better mussel dishes elsewhere. I will say that the shellfish was fresh and only two clams had some sand in them. 

Would I come back here again? Probably never! So you're saying there's a chance? I would only probably ever eat here if Chef Ramsey was actually here running it. This place needs to be on one of those Restaurant Rescue Food shows and its only been open 4 months. I was also informed by the staff that GR had only been there 5 times in the last 4 months, since this location opened. If that is true then, he really needs to spend some time here fixing the many issues. I think the loser of Hell's Kitchen might be running this place?

I let my love of GR influence my choice to stay! Next time I will follow my brain and not my heart. We should have all walked.

Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas, Carlo's Bakery! I ate at Buddy V's a couple weeks ago and one of the managers stopped at our table to check on us. After letting him know I was a "Cake Boss" fan, he let me know when the bakery would be opening and that contestants from "Next Great Baker" would be there. I obviously cleared my schedule for opening day! Carlo's Bakery (located inside The Venetian) is literally right across from Buddy V's and the pathway between them is a little more narrow than usual, so I wondered about how they were going to tame the long lines because there was no way there wouldn't be one.  

The grand opening was at 6 pm, so I wanted to get there early hoping to beat some of the crowd. I had my hubby and 2 nieces with me and we arrived to Carlo's Bakery around 5 pm to find a long line formed already. Venetian security had a field day with this one! We found our place at the end of the line and even though there were a lot of people in front of us, the line only grew l-o-n-g-e-r behind us. I was thankful for the spot we had after seeing just how long the line got! I appreciated that we were given samples from Carlo's employees while we waited. So let me talk about the wait. WOW! It was almost a 4 hour wait from the time we first got in line and actually got inside the bakery. I know that is a long time, but it wasn't so bad with all the activity going on around us. Between the free samples and seeing people from Next Great Baker and Cake Boss go by and stop to talk to us and take pictures, it didn't feel like 4 hours and honestly was a freaking blast! Hubby was a real trooper holding our spot in line while we would take off to get our picture with Buddy, Grace, Danny, Mary and people from NGB. 

Poor Buddy! He really didn't have the proper help keeping people back (like I said the pathway is a little more narrow than usual) and at one point they did have a line to meet him, but they had to stop it because so many people were crowding around and there wasn't a clear path for the people walking by who had no idea what Carlo's Bakery even was lol. At one point, Buddy came back for pictures and my nieces and I were able to get a picture. After the picture, Buddy gave one of my nieces a great big hug and a kiss on her forehead. She was SO excited smiling bright and cried a little saying "I'm never washing my face again" ...bless her precious young heart! They both had a blast and it's one experience they will never forget, myself included!

One inside the bakery, we were greeted and the girl who helped us was very friendly and helpful. it was kind of crazy inside the bake shop with people, so I just randomly picked out different things I could see. Ordering was quick, but getting what I ordered took a bit. While we waited (maybe 10 minutes) the sweet smell inside was heaven and I liked the open windows showing the bakers working. They have these windows not just inside the bakery, but outside too. When my name was called I went up to pay for my order and saw everything was packaged nicely. This was a great experience and I will most definitely be back!

Lobster Tails ($5.95) - Excellent! Try this! It's flaky with a cream inside and a little Bailey's Irish Cream. This was my favorite of what I tried. 

Eclair ($2.50) - This was cut if half and had a filling. It also had chocolate on top. This was pretty good. I thought at first site that it didn't have enough chocolate on it, but the chocolate was thick and the right amount.

Cream Puff ($2.50) - Custard filled with powdered sugar on top. I took a bite and thought it was good, so I told hubby to try it and he finished it. Glad I at least got a bite!

Chocolate Cannoli ($3/Mini) - This I figured I would like, but I ended up loving it! The amount of filling was decent. I'd order this one again.

Cannoli ($2.50/mini) - The filling has a ricotta cream with chocolate chips. I did like this one a lot and would eat it again, but I personally preferred the chocolate cannoli.

Strawberry Tart ($2.85) - This was my least favorite. If you do try this, I would recommend eating it soon. When I got home with my box, the strawberry tart looked like it melted a bit and the strawberry slid off. None of that really bothered me because I hadn't had it before and didn't know it wasn't something that didn't travel well. The way it tasted did bother me though, The bottom was rock hard and I had trouble even biting into it. I might try it again in the future, but am in no rush.

Chocolate Fudge Cupcake ($3.50) - I had the option between a vanilla or chocolate cupcake and chose the chocolate. It had a chocolate fudge frosting with sprinkles on top. This was just average. Not bad, but not great.

Carrot Cupcake ($3.50) - Of the 2 cupcakes I tried, this was the best. The cupcake was moist and the cream cheese frosting was very good. 

They also have merchandise for sale (mugs, cookbooks, etc.) and take special orders for cakes and other goodies.

SCAM!

Yes, that's right... I said "SCAM!"

The Spearmint Rhino has always been a place that's come up as one of the top strip clubs in Vegas. Of course I had to go check it out while in Vegas this weekend with my friend. 

First off, we knew about the free limo thing, but weren't able to work that one out. We ended up taking a cab and also paying the steep cover to get in. On the surface, this joint made a decent first impression. A bevy of beautiful girls. You couldn't really go too wrong here looks-wise. Girls here are so consistently good looking, you would think you walked on to a strip club movie set. 

It didn't take long though before we started to see the cracks in the foundation here... and they run deep.

Before we could even take it all in, I get accosted and molested by this tall blond Eastern European girl who tried dragging me back to VIP. I had to say "no" half a dozen times and yank my arm away from her before she took the hint. 

She kept touching my dick through my pants while trying to pull me to the VIP lounge talking about 200 dollars and how I didn't want to sit at a table because it's no fun there. Well, maybe I like sitting in the main room having drinks and talking to people. Maybe I don't want to go have a private dance with a complete stranger. 

That shit is awkward. I would like to get to know someone a little bit first. What if I find out your personality is shit and then I'm stuck in the VIP room with some hot asshole and 200 bucks lighter? Plus, I don't really want some stranger touching my dick instead of a handshake... I suppose I'm weird that way. 

My friend and I walked around the club a few times looking for a seat. They let too many people in here. Absurdly too many. I was told to go talk to a guy up at the front if I wanted a seat. He put my name on his list and said he would try to find me something and to just keep checking back with him. I wandered around some more and had 3 more girls come up to me and touch my dick and try to drag me off to the back room. It got quite annoying rather quickly. Let me fucking sit down for 5 minutes. 

My friend and I decided to just sit at one of the two bars and have a drink while we wait. Another girl comes up to us and guilts me into buying her a drink. I hate that. I don't buy girls drinks at bars. I buy my date drinks. I buy my friends drinks. I don't buy strangers drinks because they are pretty... or in their bra and panties for that matter. 

She did turn out to be useful though because she informed me that if I don't give the guy at the door 100 bucks, I won't get a seat ever. She was kind enough to walk around the place with us looking for open seats. We ended up lucking out by asking a guy if we could sit at his table with him. It was a great spot too. Things were turning around for us. 

Then my friend asked the girl who ushered us around the club if he could buy our new friend a dance for sharing his table with us, and she said she didn't do $20 dances - she only did VIP. We all immediately lost interest in her and sent her away. That kind of attitude was just a buzzkill. 

This became the standard pretty much - it seemed that most girls there refused to give you a $20 dance on the floor, but would only go back to VIP. I don't want to go to VIP - it's creepy. I don't want to get any more intimate than just the standard lapdance. Looking around, we noticed very few dances on the floor going on - just a long-ass line to the VIP area. 

I even had one filthy blond scam artist liar tell me she was under contract and couldn't do $20 dances. She kept coming up to me throughout the night trying to drag me off to VIP. I kept saying I didn't want to go and she kept insisting. I felt like I was trying to wander off a used car lot and a sleazy salesman in a bra and panties wasn't letting me leave. 

I had a Larry David moment with this girl. She finally guilted me into going back to the room. She insists I give her the money first - her counting it took up the first song. Then she started doing the worst half-assed standard boring soulless yawn-inducing lapdance without going anywhere near my lap. I stopped her after about 30 seconds and told her I felt swindled and cheated. I wanted to leave and get my money back. 

Long story short - It became a big embarrassing ordeal for everyone, but the manager ended up giving me 40 bucks back. It was the principle of the thing for me at this point. We promptly left after this.

Spearmint Rhino has attractive girls, and some of them were actually nice. It's possible to have a good time. However, most girls here seem to only do the VIP room and scam you out of your cash. Drinks are overpriced, it's too dark inside, and they pack it so full it's standing room only. 

Arizona clubs give better dances for half the price, the girls don't act like they're too good for the job, and they let you get to know them a bit before you decide you want to go to the VIP lounge with them.

I purchased a yelp deal ($12 for $20) a while ago and attempted to eat here close to a month ago, but the power was out so the girl who was inside said she wouldn't be able to serve us since they had no power to cook with. Bummed since I had this place on my radar due to all of the positive yelp reviews and the the food sounded good, I understood and figured we'd just come back another time. Fast forward to a few days ago when hubby and I decided to give this place a try again. This time the power was on yay! Walking in it is confusing because there is no sign saying to seat your self or to wait to be seated. After standing there for a few minutes and seeing no employees I decided we would just seat ourselves. There were already a couple other filled tables, so I figured the employees might have been taking care of their orders in the back and it turns out there was just one girl working the whole floor and one cook in the back. Once she noticed we were there she did check on us often and was very friendly. Inside has mostly purple walls and bright red booths. It's obvious they are going for a Mardi Gras theme, but it could have been done better. Most of the decor has signs on it that say "for sale" since they are closing at this location.

I ordered what was probably the most simple thing on the menu, but it was what sounded good. Priced at $6.95 (regular size) I ordered the "Royal Street" and priced at $2.95 the "Bananas Fosters Rue Royal" for dessert. 

My sandwich came with a side of Cajun Fries and Coleslaw. The coleslaw was crunchy and had just the right amount of dressing tossed in it so it wasn't dry or soggy. The problem with the coleslaw though was it had absolutely no flavor at all and after three bites I put it aside. I was surprised at the side of fries since the menu said it came with a side of "Cajun Chips" and after seeing the pictures on yelp, I was really looking forward to trying them. Now let me get to the fries. The fries were absolutely perfect! The fries were cooked just right and whatever seasoning they put on them tasted really great. I wished I had no coleslaw and all fries. I don't know what the Cajun Chips tasted like, but i'm sure the Cajun Fries I had made up for it. 

The sandwiches come in regular and large sizes. The Royal Street is a grilled cheese with tomato sandwich. If you want your sandwich "dressed" you will get the addition of lettuce, tomatoes, mayo and pickles. Since I ordered a grilled cheese I wondered how that would turn out, but our server said it was one of her favorite sandwiches on the menu and it is really good with the additions, so I went for it. I have to first say that I really did enjoy my sandwich and would totally eat it again. Now let me say that the sandwich just wasn't what the menu described. There was nothing grilled about it. The bread was extremely good. I mean the bread was so soft and tasty and still held the fillings in nicely. I did order a grilled cheese though and the bread had no grill marks and there was nothing crunchy about the bread. The kids menu even mentions that if your kids have a hard time eating crunchy bread to let them know, but a kid would have no problem eating the bread on the sandwich I had. I also kept hearing the microwave going off and the door opening and closing and when hubby asked me how they got the cheese on both pieces of bread melted if they didn't grill it, the whole noise of the microwave came to my mind. I don't know that's what they did, but the sandwich wasn't at all a grilled cheese. 

When I ordered the Bananas Fosters Rue Royal for dessert and I heard our server tell the cook the order, I heard the microwave start up again. I think they were heating up the bananas maybe. This was a decent dessert. I wish there was more bananas it it, but hubby and I both enjoyed sharing it and there was a nice big scoop of ice cream in it that was perfect for sharing. 

I asked our server about the chips/fries switch up and she said that they signed a 6 year lease, but wont be able to stay at the location they are in because the whole building will be coming down with the expansion of the freeway. She said that the owner is unfortunately going through some health problems right now and between that and moving locations (if they can find one she says) some of the menu isn't available right now. If you are craving alligator or Cajun chips you are out of luck. They wont be serving them and some other items until they figure out where and if they are moving. The girl was very nice and like I said I did like my food aside from the coleslaw, but it would have been better for the server to let us and every customer know what is and isn't available on the menu so they aren't disappointed when they get something else on their plate or have to pick something else to eat and look over the menu again. I hope they do find another location and work out the kinks because I'd try them again in the future.
