I used these guys 3 times so far...the first time I used them it was a hot summer day in August and I remember the owner had a sprained arm wrapped up in a sling. He was out there assisting his team moving furniture with one arm.  Creative moving defiantly exceeded my expectations.

I was in an accident a few years ago and was told to see a chiropractor, which I was really hesitant to do. 

I was recommended to Health Coach and boy was it the best move I made. Their philosophy is to take a holistic approach to getting you healthy as quickly as possible. 

The staff is great and I felt comfortable putting my health in their hands.

Hit the spot... but definitely not ranked up there as a favorite.  The eggrolls were somewhat dried out!  The soup didn't have the same taste that I have come to look for in pho broth.  The service was not horrible but definitely wasn't as good as other restaurants, even though they weren't so busy when we went to visit.

They were rather stingy with paper napkins ... and water.

Been there once... and that's okay for me.

Secret pizza is the shit. Sober or drunk, it's worth the wait and the ridiculous conversations and interactions from all the sloppy mcsloppersons standing in line for a slice makes it quite entertaining as well. I liked the pepperoni, but I loved the white pizza with ricotta, mushrooms (?) and pepperoni! Just get a whole pizza for your group instead of ordering individual slices, because they're like the Pringles of the pizza world, once you pop you can't stop.

Neiman Marcus meet Salvation Army. Salvation Army meet Neiman Marcus. Nice. 

Wow. A vintage/thrift store that doesn't smell like my Aunt Helen's wig closet. No stench of mothballs, decaying bodies or stale smoke from an old pack of Capri Ultra Light Menthol 120s. 

Organized. Well staffed. Well, staffed by people who are actually engaging and interested in you. Unlike SO many other similar shops in this area where you get a little bit of "OH, you are so lucky to peruse my crap" attitude. 

Most importantly...great stuff. Vintage Italian dishware (think Fiesta with a Tuscan twist), Disney movie stills, framed, and selling for a mere Abraham and an entire case of well lit (much like myself at the time of shopping) Prada, Jimmy Choo and Minola Blanaks!! Just my luck! None in my size. 
 
Flo. I love you! So glad you found another gig after Mel's. And for those who aren't a fan of Flo's. 

KISS MY GRITS!

I can just imagine all the hardships that those fabled explorers Lewis & Clark had to endure as they explored the unchartered West of the USA from 1804 to 1806. Harsh weather conditions and long hunting expeditions in search of food.

In my quest for sustenance today I ventured out to the local KFC to bag some chicken. It was like watching a movie scene in slow motion as it took probably close to 10 minutes before I received my food. Yeah, we've come a long way since 1806 where they could only wish to even capture any food within 10 minutes. In addition, I guess since the outdoor air temperature is only 89 they didn't feel like it was worthy to turn on the air conditioning. There was no air flow with fans, it was stifling in the restaurant.

Now the food did taste great but there is plenty of room left to improve the customer service and ambience of this place.

4pm check out time, at no additional cost. In Vegas? Yes, it does exist, and it exists at Trump. It's an excellent buffer after going all night long, because the thought of getting up at 10 or 11 is just plain awful. 

The bathroom is huge and includes a shower large enough to fit a party of four people (if that's your kind of thing) and a bathtub deep enough to store all your winnings. And there's a TV in the mirror in the event you want to bathe in your money and catch some prime time.

The rooms are spacious and though there's no casino to amuse you, it's walking distance from some of the more desirable entertainment locations of the strip.

Your nose will also appreciate the distinct (and pleasant) smells in the lobby and elevator.

Welcome to Chuck E Cheese from Hell!  

Not only would this attraction be suitable for family fun, but it'd also be great if you were looking to do a modern version of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas".  I witnessed a couple of tourists in midst of that and I gotta admit...I was jealous.  They bathed in the KISStory and rocked out harder than anyone else when the band's late 80's hit "Forever" blared out the speakers.  I doubt they ever made it to playing golf.

This is unquestionably the best mini-golf course in Las Vegas.  The black lights, awesome tunes, incredible memorabilia (Eric Carr's Porsche right up front!) and KISS animatronics really transported me somewhere else.  The enormous models of Paul Stanley's Ibanez Iceman, Ace Frehley's triple humbucker Gibson Les Paul and then Gene Simmons' tongue on the 18th hole were insane.

My only gripe was that holding a scorecard, pencil, putter, golf ball and beer from hole to hole became as annoying as listening to a Peter Criss interview.  At least the beers were cheap.  It was $2 for the first round, $3 for the second etc.  That definitely eased my pain of being the worst mini-golfer in the world.    

Here's a $3 off per person coupon:
http://vegas4locals.com/couponkissminigolf.html
That makes it $8.95 for out of towners and $6.95 for locals.  SONIC BOOOOOM!!!

You don't know how much I love you,
You don't know how much I care.

This review is way old but since I'm sick and have nothing better to do than stare at my feet and feel like crap I thought I'd catch up on old reviews before they are erased from memory.

Happy Hour is where its at son!
1/2 off Steaks (and a gnocchi I just couldn't pass up)

The vibe is straight up sexy, (I never use that word because I feel awkward saying it out loud) but its just dark, sultry and sleek and straight out of an old-school movie.  

The specialty cocktails are divine, the bartenders take their time and they know wassup.  Quality drinks cost money, but oh what a way to burn.

They are killing dogs. Abusive. They should not be in business. They are running a tourture ring.Gabby Ugartte -Recently our dog, Shadow, stayed at Green Acres Boarding in Gilbert. When my mom picked him up he was covered in paint and what looked to be chemical burns. Along with a 106 degree fever. They didn't contact our family or the vet and refused to help with any bills despite the fact this was because of their negligence. I want as many people to know as possible that this place is a terrible place for your pets. Please please please help inform people about this place by sharing these pictures or just letting people know. I don't want any other pets lives to be put at risk.

I like Duck, roasted and with some plum sauce on the side. I'm not so excited about Duck & Decanter. It's just okay for me, 2 1/2 stars if I had that option since I'm only interested in lunch and not their wine or any of the fancy foodstuffs that they carry. The best attribute about this place is the outdoor seating while being surrounded by some large trees.

For starters, there's a funky smell going on when you first walk into the place. I think the sandwiches are weak. You can look at a picture of my Reuben Sandwich with the toasted burnt bread and judge for yourself. To me, it looks like a number eight hitter's batting average, weak. I've had a decent salad in the past as well. 

This place has definitely not made the cut on to my regular lunch rotation.

Sorry to ruin the party concerning the high Yelp rating for this company, but this is my story. 

I called these guys and we agreed that they would come over to my house at 4pm for a regular service call. So I took off some time from the office to meet them at my house. I called them at 4:10pm and asked them what was going on, I had to leave a message. After a few minutes, they called me back and said they didn't have a technician near my house since they were in other parts of the valley so we would have to reschedule. WTF?

I rescheduled for the next week and while they called me about 15 minutes before the scheduled appointment, I told them that I was in another part of the valley and couldn't make the appointment. I then continued with my awesome lunch.

We were in Vegas this past weekend and decided to check out Sushi Samba.  We did the tasting "omakase" menu and it was a hit with everyone on the table.  We got a nice sampling of everything there, it was all superb.  My favorite were the yellowtail tacos, yumm!  Most of all, we had a really great waitress, unfortunately i can't remember her name but she was very well informed and on top of it and she's the reason i'm giving this place 5 stars.

The service and selection at Churchill's is as good as it gets! 

A friend of mine bought me a humidor from here as a gift. There was a continual problem with the small humidifier that attaches to the inside of the lid. 

After many attempts at fixing the issue, they made the decision to upgrade me to the next size, almost twice as big as well as upgrading the humidification system inside the box. 

Every time I walk in I'm greeted with a hello and if I need anything they're right there to take care of me. 

I drive out of my way to go here and this is the only place in town that I'll buy my cigars from.

Over the years, I've been in a lot of sheet metal; Ferrari, Porsche, Bentley, you name it.

I've also been fortunate enough to have driven at the Charlotte Motor Speedway when it first reopened in several different cars.  But I have no idea what to say about Tesla, except something humorless about their cars not needing a cigarette lighter.

I've seen quite a few around town. And yes, it's a very nice car but... $122K for a Model S? I'll admit there's certainly a je nes se qua to them that attracts folks.  The stock price is another story. Really.  

The showroom also seems to do a brisk business in shirts, hats, et cetera.

But I hope they survive, live long and prosper.  If only because I don't want to hear about them being an electric deLorean.

Enjoy!  If you can.

I had my first taste of Firehouse Subs today and decided to go with the Beef & Cheddar eight inch sandwich with a large Diet Dr. Pepper from their fabulous soda machine. That machine kind of reminds me of Rodney Dangerfield's character in the Caddyshack where he had that golf bag that played music, so versatile just like the soda machine delivering many different types of sodas. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3A9rLoz_0o

The Beef and Cheddar sandwich comes with bbq sauce and mayo. I got it without the mayo and it tasted fabulous. The only problem was that I felt a little hungry after eating it. So there's the rub, an excellent tasting meal with just a little bit of meat. Five stars for taste but one star for not putting out my 5 alarm hunger pangs.

Used Creative moving about a month ago. What a great, family-run business. The guys were on time, courteous, and professional. They don't drag their feet - their goal is to get the job done right and as efficiently as possible. As a matter of fact, they came in UNDER the estimate! Not one broken item in the whole move. They carefully wrapped and padded our furniture, and took great care to avoid dinging walls, etc.
Would use Creative again in a heartbeat, and will be recommending them to everyone we know. Could not be more pleased after you hear so many negative things about other movers.

This location is in Green Valley just off the 215 freeway.

TOTAL meltdown in service. Slow and non apologetic about the service from the management. Wasn't just me, it was all tables and they keep filling em up no matter what. Was there 1 1/2 hours and couldn't even get dessert. CRAZY!

Huge food portions, blah nothing to taste but presentation of the food was nice.

Lack of leadership with excuses. Didn't really care too much about excuses as I'm the customer and went with an expectation of quality food and professional service.
Neither was delivered on this visit.

I may or may not go there again

I vividly remember my first bite of their red velvet cupcake 8 years ago at their Beverly Hills location.  I'd never had cupcake like that before or since.  There have been copycats sneaking their way into Las Vegas over the years with mixed results and never living up to Sprinkles for me.  They finally made it and I am psyched!  

Yeah so 6 cupcakes costs $22.50.  I was surprised when the cashier asked me if those were for here or to go but then I saw a guy with 6 of them at a table by himself.  Damn, dude.

We ordered 3 red velvet, a peanut butter chip, lemon meringue and black & white.  Those other 3 were nice and all but it's all about the red velvet.  The cake was perfectly moist and the frosting is like no other.  Funny how they put the takeout box into a resealable plastic bag...like drugs.  I am sure Sprinkles is well aware of their addictive qualities.

Even the line on Sunday at 11pm was about 15 minutes.  Looking forward to giving the cupcake ATM a whirl when the line is an hour plus.

The newest kid on the strip is still the sexiest!

Yup, as soon as you walk into the lobby, you are invited in with the allure of large glass columns with ever changing themes. Chic mirrors and chandeliers dripping with crystals from the ceiling and everything around you just seems to sparkle with a sleek, sexy flare that is all Vegas. 

I checked in for the July 4th weekend and got up sold by a very aggressive front desk clerk that insisted on getting me into the penthouse.  I settled for a 910sq. ft. angle suite on the 58th floor with additional Japanese soaking tub, terrace with a view of the Bellagio fountains, kitchenette with fridge & microwave and an additional full sized bath with shower. Not too shabby.   

The room I must say was very spacious, the view off the expansive terrace was breathtaking and i used the soaking tub practically every night after the clubs so it worked out great!

My only complaint was with housekeeping.  There's a circular red paper note you're supposed to leave on the bed to have your linens changed, which i did but every night i came back to the room, my sheets were done but not changed! It was ridonkulous! Even the dirty pillow that had some sketchy black skid mark smeared on it (that i never used from day one) remained in my room til the last day i was there....nuts!

Perhaps all the smoke and mirrors at the entrance lobby had me blinded by the hotel's sexy charm but with all due respect, my stay was very enjoyable and despite the minor flaws, I had a fantastic time... 

With that said, the hotel was conveniently located in the heart of the strip. It's steps away from the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood and Paris...and the Sahra Spa, brunch and pool were very enjoyable...and partying at the Marquee & Bond was priceless!


Happy Times!

Three Birds left and pounds of Steel makes for good target practice! 

The Pittsburgh Steelers have one of the best records in football history. They have won 5 out of 42 Super Bowls. Only 3 teams have won 5 and that is the Steelers, the Cowboys and the SF 49's. Seeing the Steelers are the only one of those three in the playoffs, they could break all records this year, by winning 6 Super Bowls. IF they go to the Super Bowl again this year, it will be their 7TH appearance.

IF, is the biggest word in the English language. If my grandmother had 4 wheels, she would be a box car. 

I was not thrilled when Bill Cowher left the Steelers, but I must say Mike Tomlin has done a fine job and we were blessed, to have had two great coaches. 

I have been an avid collector of autographed sports memorabilia for many, many years. I have quite a lot of autographed Steelers merchandise, including a football jersey signed by the Steel Curtain. 

I can't help but admire that more and more each week and think of how Mean Joe Green and LC Greenwood will be watching the games, with nerves of steel and how Ernie Holmes and Mad Dog Dwight White will be smiling down upon Big Ben, Willie Parker, Hines Ward, Troy Polamalu, Harrison, Holmes and the rest of the team. 

This week the Steelers have home field advantage of a ridiculous time of 6:30 against the Ravens. The Ravens play hard and rough and my fingers are crossed that we beat them for a third time this year. 

Everyone is thinking of how great it would be to have a PA. Super Bowl. I went to Heinz Field for the 2004 Eagles/Steelers game. I drove from Philadelphia along with Eagles Fans galore. We won and it was an awesome ride home. 

GO STEELERS!! You rock my world! Give me one for the other hand!

1300+ reviews don't lie. This place is quite delicious. 

Why the one star? Because I ate here on Tuesday 4/23 and started having food poisoning symptoms two days later. It's been five days and I'm still in pain and have lost 13 pounds due to so much water loss. I had to visit the ER yesterday for dehydration. After multiple complaints from other patrons, Firefly was shut down today for a health inspection. 

However, this is not the first time I became ill after eating here. A couple years ago, I had their fish sticks and started violently vomiting soon after. After some time, I decided to give this place another chance. Everything was good...until now. 

It's such a shame because Firefly has delicious tapas and drinks. This was my go-to place for a long time. But apparently staff members aren't keeping clean and washing their hands or they're not handling their food properly.

I've already given this place a second chance. A third chance? I highly doubt it. Eat here at your own risk.

You want some bread to go with that cheese?

I'm immediately reminded of Chuck E.  Cheese, The Country Bears etc.

Cheap animatronics with some fire & water thrown in for spectacle, Fall of Atlantis is a free attraction located in the Forum Shops of Caesar's Palace.  King Atlas has to decide upon who his replacement should be to the  throne, his daughter who has special water effects, or his son who contributes the pyrotechnics.  Gods itervene & have some choice words for King Atlas & his offspring.  The climax brings about a dragon who lays the smackdown on all the Atlanteans & lays waste to Atlantis
http://www.vegas.com/attractions/on-the-strip/caesars-atlantis-fountain/

I know it's free, but I feel like the Fall of Atlantis cheapens the "baller" atmosphere of Caesar's Forum Shops.  I mean, with Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Louis Vuitton and Ferragamo attracting the rich clientele, you'd think there would be something more worthy of the demographic?  To me, the best part of the Fall of Atlantis is the large aquarium, with rays, puffers and other assorted marine creatures.  Of course, I grew up on Jacques Cousteau, so I'll always be partial to the sea ;p

Fall of Atlantis shows at the top of the hour, every hour, starting at 11am.  

I suppose if you were slurring your speech & crap-faced drunk, this show would be more entertaining.  All in all, I say let the tourists watch this lame spectacle of out-dated robotics & head over to something more worthy of your time, like the Bellagio fountains or one of the buffets.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 60/100

Pretty solid shopping mall in Vegas! One of the best ones I visited during my most recent trip. It's huge and actually feels like a real mall as opposed to some of the hotels who have a few shops (less than 20-30) and consist of stores that nobody would ever be interested in actually shopping at.

At the front of the mall, there's a smaller area that consists of several floors with an awesome winding escalator. On the second (or third? I can't remember), it leads further back into a whole other section of the mall...which goes on for forever! So many stores! They range from normal/average, to high end and luxury brands. There are also lots of restaurants and cafes located in the mall.

The one reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because I felt like I was getting kind of confused as to the layout of the mall. It's weird how there's the small-ish entryway area (reminds me of the big mall in San Francisco), and then on one floor it kinda just continues further and farther away from everything else. Also, the mall map directory was kind of confusing and I wasn't sure what direction to walk in.

I would say this mall is comparable to the Venetian's, except slightly different architecture! Both very European.

When it comes to parties, Steve Wynn's Encore Beach Club and XS Night Club are still the gold standard for the hottest spots in town.

I came to the Beach Club on Sunday at around 2:oopm to see Calvin Harris and surprisingly there was hardly no wait at all! I've heard horror stories where people were turned away even though they bought tickets for the show because the venue was beyond capacity. In any case, we got in, I was happy...

SCORE!!

As soon as we walked through security, I witnessed an ocean of skin filling the entire space! And this pool area was huge! 

Damn these people are beautiful! I suggest ordering drinks on the left side of the entrance cuz the drinks were bigger, stiffer and the same price!  

I tried the food as well and it was also very good! I recommend the grilled chicken sandwich and the steak sliders, both were mouthwatering good and excellent accompaniments to our drinks!

Calvin Harris came out about 3:00pm and the crowd was buzzing by now with anticipation! There was so much energy in the pit but it was all positive, no hating, no shoving or any nonsense like that...it was all love and good times and that's how it should be!

Bravo Encore Beach Club!

I had a slammin time and I look forward to coming back very soon!

Happy Times!

Completely and utterly RIDICULOUS.

We came here for - surprise, surprise - a bachelorette party, but in stark contrast to the other partygoers, we were completely sober.  

Which ensured that I can reiterate with absolute confidence: completely and utterly RIDICULOUS.

The show started with a very loud montage of shows that these guys have been on - the View, Oprah, Jennifer Love Hewitt talking *about* them on Jay Leno.  It was essentially an extended commercial for something that we were already there for.  Then the guys came out and did a group dance that looked more like an aerobics routine than the HAWTEST ALL-MALE REVUE IN THE WORLD.  

This is how it went:

1.  Group dance: aerobics, aerobics, aerobics...FLASH CHEST! (crowd screams)...aerobics, aerobics, aerobics...FLASH ABS! (crowd screams)...aerobics, aerobics, aerobics...FLASH CHEST AGAIN! (crowd screams).  Guys go amongst the crowd (crowd screams).

2.  Individual dance: guy comes out, does aerobics, comes out into the crowd to find a cute veiled bachelorette to join him onstage.  Said bachelorette accepts lapdance, fondles chest and ass, gets a hug, and goes back to her seat.  Dancer does more aerobics then returns backstage.

Repeat steps 1 and 2 ad nauseum, then end show with step 1 again.

We were hoping for a lot of ass, maybe a glimpse of the package, but all we got was a lot of aerobics performed by men with too many clothes on.  Seriously, when they took off a pair of pants, (SURPRISE!) there was ANOTHER pair of pants on underneath.  When they took off the boxer briefs, (SURPRISE!) there was a g string on underneath.  They would have lasted freaking forever in a game of strip poker.  

I'm giving them an extra star for the sheer amusement they gave me (I laughed A LOT during this show), and because one of the guys shook my hand at the end.  Oh, and for all the Guns 'N Roses and Bon Jovi.  But really, why do women have to sit through all this crap when female strippers get right to the point and go straight for the pole?  

Hey Mick Dundee, dispose of the cheese and just show me your damn goods.

Love the music.
Love the entertainer.
Didn't love the performance.

Michael Jackson One reminded me how much I love Michael Jackson music and also reminded me how much I miss the entertainer that he was.

This Cirque du Soleil show was still very good ... less because of the "story" or "acts" and more for the pure joy, inspiration, and energy hearing Michael Jackson songs brings. Actually the story of 4 misfits searching for the white glove, shoes, hat, and sunglasses of MJ was downright silly. I really didn't care for Shy or Clumsy (the other two are called Sneaky and Smarty Pants). Less of them and more of the music could of made Michael Jackson One a 5-star experience truly worthy of the $155/ticket (plus additional Ticketmaster fees).

A few highlights:

 * A hologram of Michael Jackson dancing to "Man in the Mirror" was like watching a cool movie of Michael up close. 

 * The "Bad" performance brings back memories of break dancing ...

 * "Billie Jean" features dancers in multicolored lit suits and acrobats around the theater.

 * "Thriller" filled with trampolines and zombies was ok.

 * More than once, the show shares messages of hope and equality ... especially during "They Don't Care About Us."

 * "Smooth Criminal" may of been my favorite ... because I love the song and the "lean"

Some of the songs were:

 - Beat It
 - Leave Me Alone
 - Bad
 - Smooth Criminal
 - I'll Be There
 - Human Nature
 - Jam
 - They Don't Care About Us
 - Earth Song
 - Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'
 - The Way You Make Me Feel
 - Dangerous
 - Dirty Diana
 - Workin' Day and Night
 - Billie Jean
 - Thriller
- I Just Can't Stop Loving You
 - Man in the Mirror
 - Can You Feel It
 - Black or White
 - Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough

Those are some memorable tunes ... Forget about all the distractions and story. 

      Go for your love of the music. 
      Go for your love of the entertainer. 
      Remember how much you miss Michael Jackson.

Well Happy New Year everyone!

I was in the area and remembered there was a Luke's of Chicago nearby.  Sadly, to paraphrase Shakespeare's Hamlet: "Alas, poor Luke (Yorick)! I knew him" well!  

Seems the Chicago dog placed closed a while ago, replaced with the 5 minute pizza place Fired Pie. We have a Fired Pie up on Northsight in Scottsdale.  It too has moved into a former Chicago dog place, in that case Al's Beef.

I arrived around 1:45 and had only a few folks ahead of me in line.  I ordered their Tomato Basil (see photos) adding saut onions and mushrooms.  It came to only $7.75 which has to be a steal.

There was a nice amount cheese and sauce, with a hint of garlic.  It had a nice flavor and made me think of more expensive pizza places like Pomo's Cucina. The only drawback is that it's an "ultra thin" pie which they press out ahead of time (again see photos).  On the plus side, Fired Pie also has a small wine and beer list

So Four Stars, and yes I am a Fan.

Ladiessssssss....hold tight to those purses!

If you're a woman standing on the dance floor with a purse, you're a target. There's some kind of crime ring happening that can ruin an entire Vegas trip if they get their hands on too many personal items. They appear to be pick pocketing cell phones and if they can wiggle a wallet out while they're at it, game on. A handful of girls in our group noticed their cell phones were missing about an hour into the night and once those of us that still had ours started flashing the ground to see if we could find them, ladies dancing around us jumped in announcing that their cell phones had been swiped, too.

Sadly Hakkasan's security guys couldn't do anything about it, because their job is to keep the fire lanes clear and keep bottle service VIPs away from the commoners. It's a shame because if they had just put a few more security guards on the dance floor after the many complaints we sent their way about the situation, some people could have been safe from the thievery.

Losing your phone or ID on a Vegas weekend is probably one of the worst scenarios you can think of because your whole life is put on hold and you have to jump through hoops (while on vacation) to get everything back in order.

Props to securing kick ass DJs and the unlimited confetti budget, but there's a serious issue taking place under Hakkasan's roof that needs to be addressed. And fast.

If I could give Green Acre Dog Boarding no stars...I would.  Stay away from this dog boarding facility.  It appears that Yelp has been removing ALL of the negative reviews that this place has had, and I this facility is STILL taking in animals despite what happened two weeks ago (and Yelp saying they are closed).  Four of my five dogs died while under the care of this boarding facility.  I was "promised" that no more than ten dogs would be cared for at a time.  When we dropped our dogs off, there was only two "larger" dogs and about four small dogs at their house.  My dogs ran around the yard, and seemed to be OK.  We were going out of town for two funerals, and our five dogs (English Bulldog puppy, Manchester Terrier, Pit Bull, Great Dane, and rescue dog) were to stay at their facility for about ten days.  I received a call very late at night that four of our dogs had ran away and died from heat exhaustion (one of which being a six month old puppy and one being a 12 year old blind/deaf dog).  I later found out that my four "furry children" were only four of the twenty-some dogs that died under their care, and i was lied to...they did not run away; they were neglected.  I had NO CLUE the owners were going to be out of town, or I would have had ANYONE I could think of go pick them up.  On top of this tragedy, not once have we received any type of apology for our loss from the owners.  They met my family upon drop off, and knew we had two small children we would have to explain this to...no remorse...no apology.  Please don't take any animal here.  They shouldn't be allowed to care for animals.

Up until this past week it's been about four years since I've been to Corleone's. My wife ordered a chicken sandwich which she loved. So that was a major hurdle to satisfy the picky eater in the family.

 I had the sausage, greenpeppers and onions with the marinara sauce. Since I've been minimizing my consumption of bread lately, I just ate everything except the bun. The presentation of the meal is pretty impressive when you look at two large buns filled with stuff. But when you get into the meat of the meal you find that there's a lot more bun than meat. I have to say that I enjoyed the meal but thought the ratio of meat to bun was pretty weak.

I say this place is Yelped correctly at 3 1/2 stars.

Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat

Marquee Nightclub was packed. The music was thumpin' and the drinks were flowin'. Who cares if there were more dudes on the crowded dance floor than ladies? We were there to jump and dance ... and after quickly staking out a spot in the middle near the front, that is exactly what we and a few hundred of our new best friends did.

Tip #1: Stay at the Cosmopolitan. Go online and book a room because it includes free admission to Marquee through a much shorter line. It'll also give you a place to freshen up before hitting the club and crash/party afterwards. Ask for a room in the East Tower for convenience to Marquee.

Marquee Mondays makes Marquee a reason to stay in Sin City an extra day. The EC Twins and Nadia Ali performed on the Monday before Christmas and this was like an early gift from Santa.

Tip #2: Get on the main dance floor early cause by midnight it was wall-to-wall people with almost no one getting in or out. Many "couples" were frustrated with the tight quarters, so, come prepared for bumpin' and jumpin' with people from all around the globe.

DJ Lisa Pittman worked it at the pool while Eddie Makabi and another DJ pumped up the beats inside before the headliners came out around 12:30. Nadia did a 30-minute live set which had the crowd frothing and then the energy reached a peak with the frenetic twins.

Tip #3: Get a table if you aren't planning to stake out a spot on the crowded dance floor. If you are just wanting to chill at a club, the outdoor pool vibe and tables may be best or get one of the prime spots inside so you and your crew can dance in your own area.

Drinks are expensive ... of course, and table service is crazy expensive. Plan accordingly.

Marquee was a blast. We loved the vibe, the confetti, foam light sticks, blasts of cold air, and non-stop beats. If you get free admission to Marquee while staying at The Cosmopolitan then it is easily a 5-star night for any EDM fan.

My favorite free attraction in Vegas.  Yes, even beating the street people giving out cards with naked women on them J/K ;p

The Fountains of Bellagio are located in the heart of the Strip, where visitors can enjoy a beautiful display of water being shot high into the sky, in tune with music.  
http://www.vegas.com/attractions/on-the-strip/bellagio-fountains/

Strolling along the Strip, especially at night, it's a great sight to behold, whether with friends or your significant other.  Last time I was there, we saw the Fountains with Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" playing.  Later on, on the way back to our hotel, we saw it again with Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On".  Such an extravagant spectacle for the senses!  There's just something about an oasis of moving water right before your eyes in the middle of the searing desert,  music tickling your tympanic membranes.  All for free!

Great views from the front of Bellagio, or when dining at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  The show runs every 15-30 mins, with the start times depending upon the day.  

You can't miss this attraction at the Strip, literally & figuratively.  I know when I'm in Vegas again, I'll certainly enjoy checking out the Fountains of Bellagio several times more.

Highly recommmend!

"Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound?
That only echoes through the night."

The French Canadian with pipes like an angel, the gifted Celine Dion.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#Kbvx9GtNiElinZ0HzpQ_Lw

Celine looked absolutely stunning, captivating the Friday night audience with her melodic voice & touching lyrics.  I felt quite a few goosebumps as she sang hits such as-

"But when you touch me like this,
and when you hold me like that.
I just have to admit,
that it's all coming back to me."

Our seats located in the rear orchestra had a great view of the stage, off center left.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#w6Yz3Dx-Wgzi0dRHERURxQ

Celine did several covers of other artists' songs, but I would've preferred if she sang more of her music library.  She even performed 2 hologram duets, one of which was interestingly enough, with herself.  Can't say I didn't get the most Celine Dion for the dollar ;p

"Cause I am your lady,
and you are my man.
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can."

Of course, the song that everyone anticipates, "My Heart Will Go On", lived up to all expectations & mesmerized the fortunate concert goers.  Towards the end of the song, Celine was surrounded by falling water that artistically cascaded down to make a magical experience, both audio & visual.  Think Fountains of Bellagio in reverse.

Can't have a concert w/o merchandise
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#84ZlgUYEgyq-PDy-eNr-YA

A true showstopper & deserving of headlining the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace,  Celine Dion puts on an extravagant show that will pull the heartstrings & touch you to your very soul.  Her powerful voice wil captivate & strike you with awe as to how such strength can come from such a small frame.  A tremendous show that absolutely has to be experienced before her run is done.

Highly recommend!

Who would have thought I'd find myself downtown at a rundown casino like Palace Station, but there I was on a late Sunday night enjoying one of the most satisfying dishes sin city had to offer! 

Yup, I'm talkin about the Pan Roast at Oyster Bar! 

Do yourself a huge favor and order the palace version with shrimp chicken andouille sausage and crab. I added lobster too. But either way, It's the bomb, cuz its all about that crazy good sauce! Keep in mind however, to truly enjoy this dish, you've gotta love your spice! Trust, each bite will be a scorching spoonful of fiery goodness! Chunks of meaty sausage, chicken and seafood in every bite and I bet you won't be able to put your spoon down! Well, except to wipe your forehead from the sweat cuz this bad boy is hot hot hot! But oooh soooo hot diggity good! I ordered a level 7 (1-10 being spiciest) and it was just right!

We started with 1/2 a dozen oysters on the half shell, and that was an excellent intro to our fantastic meal! The oysters were fresh and went down the hatch nicely with a swig of cold frosty Kirin! 

We also ordered the shrimp scampi. It came served with loads of succulent tiger shrimp, a heaping serving of fresh chopped garlic and noodles swimming in a pool of buttery glory. Although it was tasty, it simply couldn't hold a candle to the signature pan roast IMO! 

I'm tellin ya, order the pan roast and enjoy! Your taste buds and tummy will thank you for it!

Happy Eats!

Fukuburger, Fuku so good!

Located inside FAME at the LINQ, Fukuburger offers innovative Asian-inspired burgers, fries and loco moco for those looking to tantalize the palate.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#k0iG_a95OyoEJpJz9Fumsg

When I saw the Tamago burger ($7.99), I knew I had to have it.  I'm an egg slut from way back.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#gr4jTA0IVQkD2Pw7J-Qd9w
Fuku-patty with furikake & teriyaki, finished with crispy onion rings & fried egg.  The first bite was like a rainbow shining down on me. Like Willy Wonka farted candy into the air.  Runny egg oozing over the delicious patty, the sweetness of the teriyaki married together with the crunch of the onion rings.  A fairly sized burger, I felt the pricepoint was a decent value, considering it is Vegas.  I relished each delicious bite.

Service was okay.  It took a while for my burger to be cooked, but I know it's made fresh to order so I can't complain.  There is bar seating directly in front, with tables insided & outside FAME.

Free jelly candy!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#DNzhAcLMgJFh-kOR8wLL_w

Fukuburger, I'm a big fan!  The Tamago burger was the real deal & one of the highlights, of many, from my trip to Vegas.  I hope you come back to SoCal so I can satisfy my cravings for your Asian-inspired delectables again!

Highly recommend!

I really like this place because it has a lot of potential. One of the tweaks I would make is to get a decent honey mustard dipping sauce. Also, I thought calling out people's name in the restaurant with their food order was annoying. I guess I find that annoying because I was trying to get some reading in during the lunch break. I did like their ketchup dispenser. No more worrying about ketchup splattering on your shirt. Next time I'll have to take a picture of it.

This was my first time in a Raising Cane so I decided to order the Caniac which consists of 6 chicken strips plus a bunch of crinkle fries and a soda for about $8 dollars. I thought you get a lot for your money. I enjoyed the chicken strips but they would have tasted much better with the honey mustard sauce.

I was reading in my IBD yesterday that Zoe's Kitchen was going public today. So why not write a review.

My first experience with Zoe's Kitchen was a couple of years ago at a CMYE at this location. I thought it was good but unfortunately too far from the house or work. Well, since the office moved nearby, I go here about once a week.

I order the 2 Chicken Kabobs which comes with a Greek Salad, rice and a few very small pitas. I really enjoy this meal even though I think it's a bit too pricey. I saw a couple of dudes enjoying the Steak Kabobs the last time I was in there, so I'll probably order that next time.

Chiploplo, Chipoodle, Chipotopolay

Looking for a pre-show meal, we saw the nearby choices of A)McDonald's, B)Panda Express or C)Chipotle.  Considering I don't like McDonald's, Panda Express is on my usual restaurant rotation & I haven't had Chipotle in a few years, the time was ripe to give Chipotle another go.

My choice - the barbacoa bowl.  

My 2 cents - It was..........how do I put this?  Boring.  Boring like the scene in "Ferris Beuller's Day Off" where Ben Stein is going "Anyone..........?  Anyone.........? Beuller........?Beuller.........?"  Boring like having a CSPAN viewing party on Valentine's Day.  Nothing says "sexytime" than Senate hearings in HD;p

Now, it wasn't bad, per se.  It's just, as I get older, I want my tastebuds to be titillated!  (I just said "titillated" *giggle*)  The portions were good.  The price was reasonable.  Also, kudos to the staff for efficiently moving the big Las Vegas line along.  Wait was minimal.  To me, I'd rather go to a local taqueria for some authentic and cheap fare, w/o the line of hipsters, Beliebers and Twi-hards.  

Chipotle is situated in a primo location to lure in the tourists.  The restaurant was clean and the staff knows how to handle the crowds coming in for sustenance, like me.  

Chipotle has it's fans, and more power to them for liking what they like.  I may return if I'm walking by, the next time I'm in Vegas.  It's convenient and the prices are reasonable, considering the dining options in the casinos.

I stopped in for lunch to check out this new pizza place. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta used to be here. I recognized the girl at the register when I walked in, so I asked her if they just changed the name, but she said that Mark Rich's recipes transferred over when the new owners bought the business in this location. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta still currently operates another location, using the same recipes and ingredients, but has nothing at all to do with Giani's NY Pizza and Pasta.

I ordered the lunch special for $5.95 which was 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The pizza slices were a good size. I didn't care for the pizza though. They might be using the same recipe the previous owner used, but it doesn't mean it comes out the same and it just didn't for me. The pizza was somewhat burnt and had a stale taste to it like maybe it was from the day before. This is a real disappointment for me because I regularly shop in the shopping center Giani's is in and enjoyed stopping for pizza. Good thing "Above the Crust" is just around the corner though on Ann Rd so there still is a solid pizza joint in the neighborhood I can go to.

I appreciate French food and like it more than I should. 

I also love NOLA and their Laissez les bons temps roulern!

But, the French Grocery is really not a grocery store at all. You cannot buy any grocery items, like you might find in a typical Champion or Carrefour. No Carte Noire coffee, no Maille moutardes, et cetera

They also do not cook, nor serve food here.  Everything is pre-made, wrapped for sale and kept in a refrigeration case. The only exception is the bakery items and a small chilled salad deli case. 

When we arrived on Friday just before five, there were also very few items left in the refrigerator. There was no croissants, no french bread or much of anything in the bakery case except for some small $1.75 cookies.

There were a couple of small individual Quiche Lorraines (which didn't contain any bacon or ham) and a few small baguette sandwiches, like you would find in Gare du Nord. 

The French Bakery also has a wine section, along with a few French press coffee pots. As others have noted, the lighting is poor and makes the store feel dreary. There are a few tables scattered in this cavernous store. But I am unsure what they are used for since you cannot sit and eat any of the chilled items. 

I believe the French Grocery is set up to appeal to working couples on the go --who want something more interesting than the Take Out selection of Fresh & Easy.  Of the six items we ordered, the best was the chocolate Pot de Creme for $3.50. Our total including tax came to $32.11

But if you come to the French Grocery thinking of Le Pain Quotidien, Le Madeleine, or even local Amuse Bouche (Surprise), you might leave disappointed.   Sorry!

Just got this message from one of the owners (their review is under Jestin M.) 

this is me one of the owner of Tina's cafe.  you are obviously a poor idiot who is miserable in life.  If you have a nerve, you should've tell your complaint to us instead of crying out on yelp.  We have so many flowers and will continue doing great. Tina will bit the fack out of you if you come and let her know who you are.  ASS HOLE. Go back to your Mexico and eat corn with your whore mother.  by the way, your picture looks like a a guy who is infected with some kinds of disease.   Your women is ugly as you btw (lol)

So after this I personally called and spoke with a manager, they confirmed Jestin works there. Even though I was being cordial with my tone and trying to be helpful in saying that this was my experience, maybe others are experiencing the same thing and that can help fix the problem, they proceeded to say a few things I wont retype here and hung up. 

I responded back and so did they. If you want to read that here is a screen shot of that: 
http://i.imgur.com/PvcBz.jpg

So it was not enough for them to say that message. They just texted me this right now (since I called with my cell). 

"You keep mentioning 5yrs old about your stupid compain, we will report your info to be investigated if you are a child melester. Tina has a right not serve you for the safty of our customer. Take your little 10 dollar to mcdonald's. Lol"

Here is a screen shot of the text I just got from the business phone number:

I used to love coming to Hancock for fabric, but stopped because the selection changed and I couldn't find any fabric that I liked unless I had it special ordered. I stopped in today to check out their fabrics to see if they had any neat holiday patterns or kits and also I needed to pick up some craft glue to finish up some Christmas gifts I'm making. When I walked in there was 2 older woman and they saw me yet didn't greet me or even say hello. After looking around a bit at the fabric and seeing that it all looked dated, I walked up to another lady I noticed and asked her if they sold craft glue and she directed me to it and asked if I needed any help finding anything else. Hancock is smaller than Hobby Lobby or Michael's, so the selection and brands are limited. The craft glue was actually the same price as it would be at the other mentioned stores, but I also could have used a 40 percent off coupon at those other said places, making the craft glue more expensive here if I were to come here to get it each time unless Hancock offered the same coupon that could be used daily and that I could just pull up on my phone like I can at the other places. I did sign up for some sort of rewards card, so if they send deals worthy enough, I'll stop by no problem. The fabric today was on sale 40-50 percent and that's good, but the selection was terrible. The quality of the fabric at Walmart (if you can even find it anymore because they have taken a lot of their fabric isles down) is very poor, so it's nice to have a place like Hancock that has good quality fabric, but it has to be on sale to be worth it and they need more patterns that aren't so dated. I can see stopping by here in a pinch, but will stick to getting my regular crafting supplies at Hobby Lobby and Michael's where the selection and deals are better.

This is the first (hopefully last) show I've ever attended where the headliner lip-synced the majority of their performance.  I knew going in that would be the case, but it still bugged the crap out of me.  There are a ton of Yelp reviews that mention it.  Almost none of them care and joyously devour her show like it's all you can eat ice cream.
  
Just being in the same (albeit very large) room as Britney Spears, wafting in her aura and celebrity is where their satisfaction is.  She could have been brushing her teeth on stage for all they cared.  My wife argued that I would go see Red Sox designated hitter David "Big Papi" Ortiz if he did a Vegas lip-sync/dance show and it's nothing different than this.  She's right.  I totally would.    

The scene was a sea of ladies dressed in club clothes, packs of gay men that knew the words to every song, Eurotrash, and significant others like myself that questioned whether the metal detectors at the entrance were for Britney's safety or to prevent a person like me from shooting/stabbing myself mid-show if she sang (ummm...performed?) a song like the inadvertent sex change anthem "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman".  The energy in the venue was palpable when you combined all that with the $45 "Work Bitch" caps, the homemade costumes worn, and people pre-gaming big by double fisting their $12 cocktails.

Of course I got a bunch of dudes a row up that refused to sit at any point during the show. Ballads, dance interludes, parts that she wasn't even in; they were all "Fuck it!  We're standing!  It's Britney, bitch!"  That meant we couldn't see anything unless we stood too!  So even when the majority of people were sitting during certain parts, I was still out of my seat which probably made me look like a really big fan of Miss Spears.  Puke.  I actually shelled dough out for this show so I'd be damned if I were to miss a wardrobe malfunction.  

Songs were....stage was...dancers were....screw that!  Go read other reviews for that stuff.   I didn't cross this show off my bucket list, I crossed it off my fuckit list.

Rosati's Pizza is my go to pizza joint. They are basically a carry out place. I live too far away for delivery. So that tells you how far I'll travel for an excellent tasting pizza.

They currently have this special where you buy a large and get the medium (excludes the toppings) 1/2 off. I hope I haven't let the secret out on that special. It's been going on for well over a year. I always bump into a lot of Chicago people when in here. I always get a bigger pizza than I can eat since it's the perfect breakfast food. After all, who can resist some reheated pizza the next morning for breakfast!

I really like the thin crust but my family prefers the deep dish. So I'm stuck eating deep dish all the time, lol. This is the best tasting pizza I have had in Arizona. The Cenpho folks might want to venture out of their box and try this pie. This is something even the east coasters would enjoy. 

Once in awhile they'll even mess up your order but they are quick to rectify it if you give them a chance. And once in awhile they'll even burn your pizza a little. Even with these rare annoyances I keep coming back to this Rosati's location every time.

They say good things come in small packages. Well this has to be the smallest Peter Piper that I've been to yet. 

What I really like about this place is that they actually have pizzas lined up and ready to eat.  A fair share of Triple P's aren't ready for the 11:30 lunch crowd and hardly have any pizzas available. I chalk that up to poor management. They're usually too busy making pizzas for the carry out crowd instead of the dining room. This place is the exception and seems to be managed correctly.

Another thing that is very cool about this location is that they give you one of those flashing buzzers when your customized pizza is ready to go. So you don't look like an ass when you're cutting in line to get your special order. I hate when I order a pizza and it's half way eaten by the time I get up there.

As far the taste, of course Peter Piper is an average tasting product but it's a cheap lunch. The only thing is that this place can get pretty crowed since it has a relatively small dining room. But they do have plenty of parking.

The grilling of food over an open flame is almost 125,000 years old.

And, the Habit Burger story is an interesting one. http://www.habitburger.com/story/  Yet the charbroiling of hamburgers and chicken is a cooking technique that many fast food places have yet to master.  Until now that is. We came here this past Saturday and came away thinking, Wow.

The menu is very familiar.  It will remind many of "In 'n Out" in it's simplicity and style of service.  Their Char-burger is $2.95 and the Double Char is $3.95. I don't know if you can order it animal style, but the burgers are delicious.  Yes, delicious.  It has that smokey char-boiled taste down to where you will want lick your fingers.

Other grilled Habit Burger sandwiches include, Chicken for $5.75, Tri-Tip beef $6.25, as well as Veggie options and Albacore Tuna.  The Sides include French fries, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and a salad range in price from $1.85 to $2.65.  

Besides a side of salad, Habit Burger also has six different Specialty Salads to choose from, ranging from a Garden for $3.95 to a Santa Barbara Chicken Cobb for $6.95.

A couple of burgers, a side of sweet potato fries and a drink ran us $12.68, including tax.  Wow.  Less expensive than "SmashBurger", slightly more than "In 'n Out"; but a lot better tasting.  Nice.

Enjoy!

Wynn wins in my book, as far as buffets go.

I am not much of a gambler or a buffet person, but I come here to increase my odds of being a winner.

Since buffets are almost always a quantity over quality compromise, this place is not for everyone.  I'd rather dine at Michael Mina's, where I can get a lobster pot pie and their Kobe beef with seared foie gras.

My attitude is that I am not going to eat like a pig so that I can get my money's worth.  I simply enjoy their wide selection of food presented in a classy way and savor the beautiful experience.

Certainly, you will see some diners, like Yelpers Cat C, Janice C, Flora C and Angelique Q, pigging out on the crab legs and prime ribs for a few hours.  

I, on the other hand, love to sample a little of everything.  Think of the buffet as one HUGE INTERNATIONAL SAMPLER PLATTER, which includes salad, fried rice, shrimp cocktails, bacon, soup, Mexican food, crme brulee, crepe, fruits, dim sum, sushi, prime rib, king crab legs, fish, grilled meat, and gelato/ice cream.  Plus bottomless champagne!

The fiddy-dollar meal is not going to break anyone's piggy bank, so don't overstuff yourself.  Save $12 for their brunch.

If you are a buffet fanatic, this is your first choice destination.  Bellagio takes second place.  Third comes Rio.  

The staff is very attentive and friendly.  Seating is comfortable, but there is a long line to get in during peak hours.

Most importantly, the bathroom is close by.
It is true that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.
So did my #2.  Wooooosssshhhh!

I dedicate this review to Janice C.  She's half-Chinese.

I went here to see the Coyotes play my home town Chicago Blackhawks. The place was sold out and consisted mostly of Chicagoans. I had no problem high fiving fellow fans after each of the 5 goals that the hawks scored. And of course they won going away that night. I guess it's a sad commentary on society in general when you have to go through a metal detector to go into the stadium. 

I had excellent seats since they were about 10 rows from the glass at the faceoff circle. I was positioned near the Coyotes net to see most of the Hawk's goals. The lines at the concession places weren't too bad but I'm pretty ticked that the dude as we entered our section wanted to see my tickets. I guess he wanted me to juggle my food and drinks in the air while I fished out my tickets from my pocket. He saw my "Are you kidding me look" and explained that they were sold out. I explained to him that I've gone to plenty of sold out games in Chicago without the attitude from the Stadium staff. How can the management expect fans wanting to pay $10 bucks for parking plus $80 plus dollars per ticket and still wanting to endure the hassle of their staff inside? Management might want to think about that for awhile.

Pro tip about going to the game. Don't expect to get any free pizza from their cheerleaders when you're wearing the away team's colors. Getting out of the parking lot was fairly easy as well. Also, thank goodness that cell phone reception is a little inconsistent near the ice so you don't have to listen to people on their phones.

Surreal pool party experience. Vegas does it unlike anywhere else, and Wet Republic is no exception when it comes to getting WET!

So you know what you're getting into:

1) Getting tickets in advance substantially cuts down waiting time.
2) Arriving early (before 1pm) does the same.
3) Cabanas cost $1,500.
4) There are lockers available to stow your stuff.
5) The bar sells drinks in enormous lidded cups. Get these and you won't regret it when the splashing starts! Unless you like chlorine as part of your alcoholic mix.
6) It is calm and beautiful when you arrive early and hardly anyone is there. It gets increasingly more chaotic and cramped up through peak pool time (~3pm).

* * * Now, so you know what you're REALLY getting into: * * *

Be prepared for a poppin' party. And when I say poppin', I mean POPPIN'. Super crowded, off the chain, dope beats, crazy splashing. Beach balls are constantly flying, some that may come your way and bonk you on the head while you are distracted, completely unaware. Good thing they're only beach balls! Then the huge inflated whales start coming out. These are much heavier than the beach balls and have more of an impact on your head. But everyone is too busy dancing and having fun to care. NOTE: You can't ride the whales. You can try, but it's impossible.

By the time the headliner DJ (Steve Aoki) takes over, it becomes so rowdy both outside and inside the pool. Outside the pool, a large crowd is clamoring up by the DJ booth. Aoki sprays the crowd with champagne and even throws a large cake with white frosting at them. He is carried overhead by the crowd. Rafts and inflatable animals (flamingos, ducks, and monkeys) are deployed. It's a hot, hot mess on land!

In the pool there is so much splashing that tidal waves are straight up rolling. One guy was so ecstatic to be in the pool that as he thrashed around, he brought his hand down (with his phone) hard onto my forearm. Thanks for the enormous bruise! Of course I didn't feel it until the next morning, probably because of the booze and adrenaline. Before I know it, 4 hours have passed and the drinks and music are still flowing. Wet Republic sure knows how to make it last!

TIP: Be ready to party. Go hard or go home!

DATE TIP: You can most certainly find a date here. Enormous margaritas + dancing in the water + people in swimsuits? Oh yeah, no doubt.

It's hard to believe the 5-diamond, all-suite Venetian Hotel rose from the dust of the Sands way back in 1999. The opulent Casino, famous Grand Canal Shoppes, 24-hour Race & Sports Book, and large Suite Hotel Rooms (with sunken living room and Italian-marble baths) are just a few reasons the Venetian still reigns as a spectacular destination for an unforgettable Las Vegas vacation.

Of course, the Venetian is inspired by Venice, Italy (sorry, California). Several detailed replicas of landmarks from Europe's most beautiful city include Piazza San Marco (St. Mark's Square) with Campanile di San Marco (St. Mark's Campanile Bell Tower) and columns for the Lion of Venice and Saint Theodore. Other notable reproductions are Palazzo Ducale (Doge's Palace), Ponte di Rialto (Rialto Bridge), and Ponte dei Sospiri (Bridge of Sighs). 

Here are your best bets for a good time at the Venetian:

Rooms
 * There are more than 4,000 suites at the Venetian
 * Luxury Suites with King bed are standard & 650 sq ft
 * A 700 sq ft Bella Suite has 2 Queens for about $30 more
 * For either, about $40 upgrades to a Suite with a View
 * A Venetian Piazza Suite is 1400 sq. ft and only $150 above Luxury
 * Another $50 can get you a Venetian Prima Suite (1500 sq ft)
 * Rates get high for larger Renaissance & Penthouse Suites
 * An In-Suite Breakfast offer is available, but not my style
 * The Venezia Tower is newer, but may not be for everyone
 * Book online & check discount packages for the best deals
 * Daily resort fee: $25 + tax ($3): Fitness Center, Internet, & 1 coffee

Dining
 * 15 Fine Dining ($$$$) restaurants are tempting
 * Recommend CUT, Bouchon, Delmonico, AquaKnox, or SUSHISAMBA
 * Over 20 casual eateries will fit more budgets

 * Lipshtick rotates female stand-up comedians ($75-$120)
 * Human Nature has Australians singing Motown ($74-$118)
 * Get married (if you must) at one of their Wedding locations
 * The DaVinci Exhibit was a waste of $27.50 to see replicas
 * Canyon Ranch SpaClub isn't cheap, but you're on vacation
 * Semi-romantic types can ride a gondola indoors and out

Shopping
 * Grand Canal Shoppes has shops along an indoor canal
 * The stores are open 10am - 11pm (midnight on Fri/Sat)
 * More than 160 stores with mall favorites, boutiques, & high-end
 * Louboutin, Burberry, Ferragamo, & Fendi are highlights
 * Some will like Jimmy Choo, Coach, DvF, or Michael Kors
 * It'Sugar is always sweet
 * Many of the restaurants are located along the Grand Canal

Parking & Location
 * Near the North end of the Vegas Strip by its sister, The Palazzo
 * Across from the Mirage and Treasure Island
 * Free parking is in an 11-story parking garage
 * Follow signs from main Venetian entrance
 * Valet is easier sometimes if you don't mind waiting & hate walking

The Venetian Resort Hotel and Casino is a truly remarkable Vegas Strip hotel offering upscale value and amenities for reasonable prices. It should be one of the first places you check for reservations before any trip to Las Vegas.

Level 107 Lounge is on the 107th floor of the Stratosphere Tower. That's the best thing ... and worst thing ... about Level 107 Lounge. The bar is great because it's near the top of the tallest tower in Las Vegas offering a vast 360 view of the city and dessert ... while it's bad because the Lounge is in the subpar Stratosphere. 

It earns 3-4 stars for a pair of reasons.

** Reason #1: Free
You can ride the elevator up to level 107 without purchasing a ticket to the top. Why pay $$ to go to the observation deck on level 109 when you can go to level 107 for free? The Lounge is close to the center of the tower and you can't get next to the windows, but the view is the same Vegas.

** Reason #2: Happy Hour BOGO
Happy Hour occurs twice per day at Level 107 and serves a limited selection of "signature" cocktails 2-for-1. Early Happy Hour is 4:00 - 7:00 pm and (really) Late Happy Hour is 1:00 - 4:00 am. Each cocktail is $15 and both must be the same. The 10 cocktails available for the special include Lemon Drop, Blue-tini, Cosmic Cucumber, Chocolate Masterpiece, Last Tango, Mango Madness, Summer Mint Margarita, Razz Jito, White Peach Margarita, and Summer Sangria. You can also get some appetizers for half price during the early happy hour.

My wife and I popped in for some happy hour drinks and to catch sunset. It was easy to get to the top and even easier to order. To see the LV Strip, sit on the side with the Bar. We chose $15 Chocolate Masterpieces with Van Gogh Chocolate Vodka, Godiva Chocolate Liqueur, and White Chocolate Liqueur. Round 2 was two $15 White Peach Margaritas with Sauza Silver Tequila, Peach Schnapps, White Peach Puree, and Sweet & Sour Mix. Both drinks were SUPER sweet as you'd expect with names like that. It was happy hour and I was on vacation with my sweetie, so, I guess it was ok to throw back a few sweet cocktails, too.

Note that it didn't seem "required" that drinks were purchased either, so, I guess you could just go to Level 107 Lounge for the view (I think). Self-parking is free at the Stratosphere.

The view from the Observation Deck may be better, but instead of spending $18 for the elevator ride to the top, spend $18 ($15 plus tip) on a couple cocktails while enjoying the view relaxing in the Level 107 Lounge.

We used these guys to cater street tacos for our daughter's 1yo birthday party.
If you have an upcoming event and need awesome food and great service at a great price, use Taqueria Guadalajara.  These are legit street tacos.
   Hector was my contact person, and he was very accomodating and professional. We ended up increasing the guest list significantly near the party, and it was no problem. 4 types of meat are included - went with carne asada, chicken, chorizo, and al pastor (pork). All four were good, but the consensus was that the al pastor was the best. 
   David came out to our house and set up about an hour before food was to be served. He started grilling, and set out the vegetable bar, which was huge. There were pickled onions, carrots/jalapeno, some sort of slaw, lettuce, pico de gallo, onions, and green and red salsas. David was extremely courteous, and stayed to serve until the last person was done eating - in 100 degree heat outside. Cleanup was great, you wouldn't even know they were there. 
  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because David did leave a "Tips" box out on the table. My feeling is that at a catered party, it is the host's responsibility to tip for good service. Expecting the guests to tip is a little awkward. Just my opinion, but not a huge deal. 
Would use them again in a heartbeat, as will many of my guests.

Living up to the hype.  A warm and contemporary Italian American eatery that delivers great tastes with the energy that is Vegas.  

This is not an authentic taste of Italian regional specialties rather refined and prettied up versions of Italian American favorites.  All good, it works.

The majority of the menu centers around small plates of antipasti shared family style.  Flavors are very complimentary so ordering a wide variety of dishes works.  An incredible simple grilled broccoli rabe natural bitterness is enhanced by hints of char and smoke but brought to life by a spicy, chili vinaigrette.  Sweet peppers stuffed with a tangy goat cheese and peppery olive oil create a very well balanced dish exploding with freshness.

For seafood antipasti, do not pass on the lobster arancini.  Dressed with a spicy pomodoro of Calabria chili and a touch of a herbaceous basil aioli that elevates the sweetness of the lobster.  Slightly cloying mouth feel but great flavors.  

Great selection of well made salumi.  Try a variety.  The Bresaola and finocchiona as good as any in Tuscany.  Add a selection of cheeses with perfectly paired condiments (Mozzarella with a citrus chili pesto,  Parmigiano with honey).  

Small selection of pastas.  The lobster ravioli excellent.  Perfectly cooked sheets of pasta surrounding chunks of barely cooked through lobster perfumed by tarragon.  Richness on richness but it works.

The only weakness of the restaurant are the mains.  A mustard, walnut, and raisin crusted rack of lamb, while perfectly cooked was one dimensional, needing more herbaceous, lemony gremolata.  A bone in "Tuscan" rib-eye topped with a sunny side up egg did not make sense.   The yolk did nothing to elevate the flavor of the beef rather giving it an unpleasant yolky aftertaste as it cooled.

Service is a work in progress.  Slow and lacking confidence.  This will definitely improve with time.

Decent wine list at Vegas resort prices.

Guys, admit it, Giada turned you on to cooking shows.  Now the chance is here to try the food you know you never cooked.  Worthy.

WHAT? I can't hear you!
Grace? Died 30 years ago!
Good luck conversing.

I don't review many chains, but I am going to take a stab on this one.  Been meaning to check out a Yard House ever since Josh A's glowing endorsement on the Talk boards awhile back.  102 tap beers sounded right up my alley.  Didn't think I had ever been to one before, but it was pointed out to me that I was at one in San Diego in the Gaslamp Quarter a couple years ago.  Remember really having liked it.  Probably would have gone 4 or 5.  Low 3 on today's visit.

The music was blaring loud this evening.  I'm sorry, but Matchbox 20 was not meant to be played that loud.  They are not even that good as background music.  I thought the waitress was going to kiss my mother on the lips as she was leaning in so close to hear the order.  Do they really think people like the music that loud?  Most of the customers were either parents with kids or gray-haired snowbirds.  No one was rocking out to it. 

Had two Uinta Hop Notch's which I have never seen anywhere else before.  Quite tasty.  The menu is very extensive both on beer and food.  Got the Mediterranean flatbread as an appetizer.  It was not good.  No sauce whatsoever, just toppings on crust.  Would have also been much better if the tomatoes were sun dried.  Would not get it again.

The blackened swordfish tacos were pretty good.  Little light on the fish, but excellent flavor with a healthy dose of guacamole.  I would definitely get these again.  Also had a couple bites of the Vodka Shrimp Pasta.  Think I will get that the next time I go when they open at West End in St. Louis Park.  Hopefully, they will use the volume dial on the music more prudently.

Everything is pretty small and served like tapas, but somehow its surprisingly filling.  There were definite highs and lows to this meal, but I think there were a few dishes that excelled while only a few weren't quite what we had hoped for.

There was a big group of us so I managed to sample quite a big portion of the menu.

Highlights:

Carnitas tacos-served with guac, pork rinds, and a verde sauce!

Like water for Chocolate- fried quail served with dragonfruit and edible flowers.  

Chilaquilles- tortilla chips cooked in a pan with a salsa verde and cheese.  Kinda like nachos.

Mango "sticky rice"- this is something quite interesting.  The sticky rice part was made into a mousse and ripe mangoes.  I've never seen this before and it was really cool.  The "rice" element were like rice crispies on top.  

Chocolate "terrain"- Awesome chocolate mold of a Chinese soldier with a spicy chocolate mousse inside.  It was served with cookie crumbs to look like sand, and a ginger ice cream that was spicy and sweet all at the same time.

Things to skip:

Oceans Nest- fried noodles served with stirfried saucy seafood and veggies.  We ate all the lobster out of it and then left it there.  It was super bland.

Lamb potstickers- pretty presentation with the little edible flowers and everything but it was bland and looked more exciting than it tasted.

Overall, I thought the place had a whimsy to it that I thought was fun.  The ambiance was interesting and diverting, the waitress and wait staff were helpful and went out of their way to see to our requests.  While some of the food is a bit overpriced and small, I really enjoyed their desserts, there is something light hearted and comical about them.  They were the highlight of the meal.  If nothing else, come and have dessert and a laugh all at the same time.

I moved from a condo to a house 6 streets away but wanted to use movers to move the heavy furniture. I found the glowing reviews on Yelp and decided to give them a try.

I called to schedule my move in date 5 days before my move and they were able to accomodate. The representative on the phone was very nice and knowledgable, explaining everything about the process and an estimated cost based on the size of my condo and number of furniture.

They called a couple days before the move to affirm the date and time, and then the movers called an hour before the scheduled time to let me know their arrival time. The movers were all very professional, very nice, and very attentive. Any items they weren't unsure about where to place it, they asked before moving it in. They also moved a couple pieces of furniture around since I wasn't completely sure where I wanted everything to go.

Finally, I decided that morning that I wanted to switch out the washer and dryer between the condo and the house. Without hesitation, they said they'd be happy to do that, so they swapped them out and hooked them up in the two places without any complaints.

Given that I was only having them move my furniture and I moved all my "stuff" myself, I did think it took them quite a while to move everything, but that's because they wrapped all pieces of furniture in plastic wrap before loading them on the truck and were very careful with all my furntiure. I had an antique large bookcase that they successfuly moved without any wear or tear.

If you're looking for a cheap and quick place to move your stuff, this is not the company for you. But if you have good quality furniture that needs gentle care in moving between two locations, I would definitely recommend them.

Lord knows how many businesses have come and gone at this address over the years like Underworld, Black Label, and Emergency Room etc.  Its transformation into Gyu-Kaku has been nothing short of amazing.  The ultra cool lit entrance begged the question...does Tron eat here?  Being seated while a female sung cover of Savage Garden's "Truly, Madly, Deeply" at 300 BPM's blared through the stereo made me think it possible if he were drunk.  

We considered the course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 for a moment but saw a lot of filler that would have ended up untouched like cheese wontons, chicken cheese fondue, house salad, fried chicken (ok,ok, maybe one piece), calamari and S'mores.  Our initial server, Keiko, recommended we start with the spicy cabbage salad over the kim-chee.  Thankfully, we listened.  Crispy, spicy and dare I say refreshing?  It was a fine way to whet our appetite.        
 
Standing out among with meats was the beef tongue and harami skirt steak.  Quality matched the price and both delivered on what decent yakiniku should be.  We also enjoyed the kalbi short rib and although the Angus beef ribs were a little too fatty for the wife, I happily devoured it.  The mushroom medley cooked in an unbeatable combination of soy sauce and butter was a nice side dish.  

The only letdown was the "Spicy Kalbi Bibimbap".  They got the stone pot right but the rest of it?  It was as if it were made by a northern Swedish resident with no knowledge of Korean cuisine attempting to replicate it through hearsay.  I would have rather ordered the sliced duck breast, an atypical yakiniku offering, or dessert over this pointless filler.  

Despite that, I know I'll be back and stick to grilling.  It's yet another welcome dining choice around Spring Mountain.  3.46729311238987 stars.

How much would you pay for a popular & busy buffet with hundreds of quality choices?

   A: $54
   B: $74
   C: $94
   D: Anything ... just let me in the freakin' buffet already

Be prepared to pay any of those prices at Bacchanal Buffet cause this is the current "It" buffet in Vegas. Caesar's Palace can pretty much charge whatever they want. The line is KuRAAAYzeee. We tried to go for dinner Monday before Christmas and the line was 3 1/2 hours long. That's over 200 minutes. We read on Yelp about an "Express" option for $20 extra, but it wasn't available that night. We left.

So, we came back on Christmas Eve for a late lunch. The set-up was different and line much shorter ... because it was a 25-minute line to put your name in for a time slot 3 1/2 - 4 hours later. The registration part is cool if you can wait. I can't. Luckily, the "$20 Express" option was available at that time. Whew! Seriously, I would of paid anything to skip the wait. So, after paying $74 for lunch per person, we headed to ... the next line. It took another 25 minutes to get seated with express. 

      This better be one hell of a buffet!

            It was. 

Here's what I pigged out on for a couple hours ... 

Meats & Seafood
 - Chilled Shrimp
 - Chilled Crab Legs
 - Warm Crab Legs
 - Rack of Lamb
 - Oysters on the Half Shell
 - Prime Rib
 - Sausages
 - Chicken
 - Ribs
 - Mussels
 - Chinese-style Crab
 - Crawfish

Sides
 - Caprese Salad
 - Sliced Pineapple
 - Pho Noodle Soup
 - Turkey Pot Pie
 - Charcuterie Meats
 - Cheeses
 - Steamed Dumplings
 - Creamed Leeks & Lobster
 - Sushi Rolls
 - Cranberries
 - Sliders
 - Bread
 - Crab Benedict
 - Chinese Broccoli

Desserts
 - Fresh Crepes
 - Red Velvet Whoopie Pies
 - Gelato
 - Creme Puffs
 - Vanilla Creme Brulee
 - Chocolate Creme Brulee
 - Buttercream Pops
 - Cheesecake Pops
 - Berry Mousse Tarts
 - Fresh Cookies

Bacchanal Buffet really is a great buffet. It is, of course, overpriced and hardly worth the wait, but if you want quality and choices like this in Vegas you have to either pay for it or have the patience of a very bored saint to stand in line. When you do finally get into Bacchanal, go nuts on the seafood and meats so at least you feel like you're making it worth your money/time.

In the ever evolving world of sandwiches, many claim to produce the best sandwich in the world.  Among the contenders are the likes of Capriotti's, Mendocino Farms, Which Wich? and many more. Among this iconic list of sandwich makers, there are droves of fans and haters alike.
But make no mistake, The Earl of Sandwich makes some of the most addictively good sandwiches i've enjoyed in a very long time! Tack on the competitive prices and it makes it even better! So it's safe to say i'm a fan when it comes to the Earl's cheap & tasty eats!


The Original with Roast Beef - 
The bread was excellent! As soon as I grabbed the warm bag in my hand, I knew I was in for a toasty treat!
The bread was perfectly crisp on the outside yet warm and fluffy on the inside. Not thick, bread-y, dry & spongy like most other places. The roast beef was piled high and it was juicy and full of mouthwatering flavor!

Jerk Chicken Sandwich
Filled with generous portions of chunk grilled chicken breast (not sandwich meat), red peppers and of course a good helping of zippy banana peppers, this zesty lil number was quite flavorful and surprisingly juicy (considering it was chicken breast!) but my favorite has to be the original for overall mmmmmm mmmm mm factor!

Dessert
Brownie Cream Sandwich
Imagine two chocalatey rich brownies sandwiching a decadent layer of sweet vanilla frosting...yup it's insanely rich and sweet! I advise you to purchase a glass of milk with this decadent number cuz you'll definitely need it!

Service was nifty & quick and they got us in and out in no time flat! Don't forget that all toppings are free with the exclusion of avocado, so pile it high if you so desire! And did I mention the prices? Only 6$ for a delicious hot sammie! That's a steal for a great sandwich on the strip I might add!

With that said, it's a no brainer...if you're out after the club looking for some awesome late nite eats or just strolling the strip, give EoS a try, you won't be disappointed!

Happy Eats!

I gave away our card with 4 stamps at the end of the meal.  THAT'S how sure our group was that none of us would ever return.  

This isn't sushi in the Japanese sense.  These are crazy freakin rolls/inventions that contain some raw fish in, on or around them.  Calling this Japanese is very misleading.  The typical roll on the menu sounds like this:

"Tastes and smells like your bitchy ex-mother in law's 1st semester college sophomore roommate who did the whole lacrosse team on a dare and got Hepatitis C roll:  Baked inside out roll stuffed with eel, cream cheese, bbq sauce, avocado, super super super white tuna, chopped yellowtail and spicy tuna, shishito peppers, scallop, garlic and salmon on top with orgasm, yum yum, and fuck me in the ass sauce on the side."

As you can see, they used the whole "I Love Sushi" concept and took it way over the top.  This could be a potentially fun dinner (as many Yelp reviews can attest) trying all the insanity but there were enough misses to warrant my negativity.  It wasn't fun, but it sure was funny.  

- Sushi rice was off.  Slimy?  Low quality?  I don't know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.  I see a lot of reviews raving about sashimi though.
  
-Speaking of sauce...what's up with drenching sauce all over nigiri?  Several pieces of nigiri came with sauce on top as a default.  We actually had to request it without.  Freshness of the fish was ok.  None of us died afterwards.  

-Pretty sure that was shrimp cocktail drenched in a soy sauce base and topped with scallion advertised as amaebi. 

-1 order of green tea was not green but it might have been due to the lipstick contamination on the side of the cup.  The liquid was a very, very light brown.  The server claimed it was green tea despite my protest.  Magically, the next cup of tea was suddenly very green.  So that's where Dirk Arthur has been performing all this time!!

- I didn't know uni came in so many colors.  The most suspect pieces were left on the plate.  The server didn't even question it.  She just took them away like she knew.

- My native Japanese dinnermates found the tamago presentation to be hilarious.  A tamago house!

At least the unagi was good.  Congratulations on well cooked eel!  Have a good life.

With so many notable spots for fusion cuisine having popped up in the middle of the desert over the past few years, Japaneiro kicks the door down and slam dunks their excellent menu into the Asian fusion ring with authority. 

Like a lot of the gushing reviews already mention, the chalkboard specials by the entrance is where the gold is.  My advice would be to take a picture of it to look over with your tablemates so you're not like me and getting up to look over the board again and again as if it were on display at a museum.  

I can never say no to foie gras.  If foie gras told me to jump off a bridge, buy it diamond earrings or crash my car through a convenience store, I'd do it.  It was well cooked and those tasty notes of fatty tenderness in a savory sauce were music to my mouth.  I even showed some restraint by offering the last bite to my wife. :P

The Nigerian prawns tasted as impressive as they appeared.  Large and succulent, the truffle butter sauce that it was accompanied by took it to another level.  The green salad offered a nice balance to the whole dish.  I admit I sucked on the shrimp shells to savor the flavor and only felt 3.1% ashamed/embarrassed about it afterwards.  

Our meal luckily managed to carry over to the late happy hour that occurs M-F 10pm-midnight.  Ending the meal with some great small bites like the salmon/tuna/beef tacos and miso black cod lettuce wraps.  The standout was the rock shrimp with its terrifically crispy fry, micro wasabi kick and cream sauce made it an absolute steal for $5.50.  I guess that shows how good these chefs are; they even managed to make rock shrimp interesting!

The lack of description for many of the items caused me to underestimate things like the "European Sea Bass" until I saw it brought to another table near the end of our meal.  The fish looked marvelous with the meat being filleted post-grill and the rest of the carcass twisted up for an interesting look.  I was practically seething with jealousy!  

Lesson learned: everything is awesome and get that the next time.

"GO WEST, YOUNG MAN" 

That was one of the first things to pop into my mind when I first heard about our much loved Frost Bites Shavery opening a possible new second location somewhere near Chinatown.  Now that FBS has opened at Seoul Plaza (where you can find: Raku, Monta Ramen, Big Wong, Japanese Curry Zen, Trattoria Nakamura-Ya, Kabuto and that awkward "massage" place where tourists leaves via taxi with a big grin on them faces) rebranded itself as SnowFlake Shavery, the famous partial quote by the American author Horace Greeley  about westward expansion and Manifest Destiny could be applied to our favorite shaved snow biz from Hendertucky.  +2 for just being soooo mucho more closer to the Westsiders. 

For those that have not tried shaved snow from SFS before, it is not the shaved ice you might have tried before with colorful syrups poured over the coarse shaved ice.  It is a more refined icy treat with powder snow or frozen cotton candy-like melt-in-your-mouth experience.  Think shaved ice version 2.3, so to speak.  All made with 100% NATURAL INGREDIENTS, no artificial flavorings or syrups used (which is the reason why taro is not one of the available flavors - sadly artificial taro flavorings trumps all natural taro shaved ice made from real taro only).

Ordering 101:

Step 1:  Choose a size: Small, Large, Monster
Step 2:  Choose a flavor:  From Vanilla, Cantaloupe to Green Tea and Black Sesame.
Step 3:  Add a topping ($0.50 per selection):  Fresh fruits to candy and cereal.
Step 4:  Top it off with a sauce (first one free, +$0.25 after that one):  Condensed Milk, Strawberry Condensed Milk, Chocolate and Caramel.

If you are not sure, they also have helpful combos for you to pick from or help jump start your shaved snow creativity.  Although I have had Green Tea and Black Sesame Shaved Snow all by itself, and didn't think it needed any toppings or sauce. It is that good!

Come and try it now that it is closer for everyone that does not live in Henderson.

I think it is better than the ones I tried in SoCal and Taiwan (except the fresh mango from Taiwan is way better).

Here are just a sampling of other real customer testimonials:

Cathy C loves this place, because it is dessert sans guilt.
Sandy K said it is so good it is like [frozen] crack.
Norm K said Mango with coconut sounds good to me!
Philip T thinks he like this more than frozen yogurt now.
Roger T thinks Green Tea + Mochi + just a drizzle of Condensed Milk is dessert heaven.

So what you be waitin' for? Come get some SnowFlake!

DISCLAIMER:  To harry I:  I am not a shill (I am deeply offended by being called that even if I had to first look it up in a dictionary).  And I am not a professional reviewer, but I will take that as a compliment.  And I believe in paying for the products and services from businesses (I want to review the customer service and experience that everyone gets), and writing a honest review of my personal experience.  If I happened to be passionate about it and write the review with flair, all the better.  Being new to Yelp you should read Yelp's Terms of Service, plus the site's Content Guidelines and Review Guidelines.  You can go back to tell your celebrity chef friend that if he is really passionate about the food he serves, he will not be using artificial powders. Is his product bad? NO.  But it is like comparing real orange juice (SnowFlake Shavery) to SunnyD (KSC).

She sells seashells by the seashore
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#72KODOc9wIrLiJCmEbU6Ew

30% off via Tix4Tonight deal of $2/person

Living out our inner Katniss & going through our "Hunger Pains", we needed something yummy to fill our tummies.  Not being in the mood for a burger or whatever fried crap available, we thought Thai food sounded good.

SEA:The Thai Experience is located back in the boonies of Bally's Hotel & Casino.  The cuisines served are both Thai & Vietnamese.  The ambiance was rather nice, with the center of the restaurant having a fountain pool with a Buddha statue, surrounded by wood tables.  On the periphery, standard tables to dine at, with a private area for large parties.

Being Vegas, we knew we shouldn't expect prices similar to the local haunts back home.  I was almost taken aback as to how much things were, but with 30% off, it helped sweeten the sour taste of overpriced food.

Fried calamari($12)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#GfhhEFZn2GCeSDFfXlbYiA
Lightly breaded calamari, fried to a nice texture, accompanied with sweet chili sauce.  Nice & chewy, these were really good.  I'm a big squid fan, and I enjoyed each fried piece from the sea.  

Pad Thai, with beef ($18)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#yUTLbpFitScqvHh75IGvBQ
Sweet, sour & filling, the pad thai had fair portions & was as good as any that I've had dining at my favorites.  

Honey walnut shrimp fried rice ($18)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#dUTI_D4Rxdqi6-iHIxXNUA
Winna, winna!  The highlight of our meal, the honey walnut shrimp fried rice  made me want to pop a wheelie in a Tuk-Tuk down Las Vegas Blvd.  Crunchy walnuts & bell peppers, a pleasing amount of deveined shrimp with a medley of vegetables  wok-tossed with seasoned rice.  The portions were great, and I relished this dish, since we only had appetizers for dinner the night before.  

Service was on the slow side.  The place wasn't too busy when we arrived, so I didn't understand why our food took longer than necessary.  Our drinks were kept filled & we had a nice meal, enjoying Thai music & the sound of falling water from the Buddha fountain.  

In summation, we had a nice Thai lunch at SEA:The Thai Experience.  Would I dine here w/o the Tix4Tonight deal?  Heck no!  Way too expensive for stuff that's 3 times more costly than restaurants I usually go to.  However, the food was good & we were happy.  Furthermore, the ambiance was a nice respite from the frenzy of the Strip.

Recommend with the 30% off Tix4Tonight deal

I have never fully appreciated nouveau cuisine. It has always left me a little hungry and a few Benjamins short. LOL 

Our introduction to Cantina Laredo was somewhat inauspicious, since they misplaced our reservations on a busy Friday night.  

We also had the same experience with the hostesses that fellow Yelp'er Teehee wrote about.  But in end, we had a nice evening, with our bill coming in at the low end.  

After the confusion and a five minute wait, we were seated near the patio. It was a nice location and we had the added bonus of observing a pre-wedding family dinner of eighteen. 

Cantina Laredo likes to market itself as serving "modern Mexican food in a sophisticated, vibrant atmosphere. ... with a Mexico City style menu."  I believe it's more Mexican petite nouveau cuisine. 

We started off with a delivery of chips and two types of salsa. The milder version had a nice tomato base. But it was the spicier one, with fire roasted peppers that was the standout. It was complex and so delicious, that you could have eaten it with a spoon. 

Next was their table-side guacamole making called Top Shelf for $9.99. It was an exquisite. Now I make this all the time at home, yet it always seems tastier when someone else is doing it. LOL

Somewhere along the way our white honey sangria was dropped off. It was very good and fairly priced served in large 12 oz flute glass. Nice!

For dinner we decided to share two entrees. One was their Vera Cruz Enchiladas (photo), which was a nice mixture of spinach and chicken for $13.99; and the other was the Carnitas Tacos for $13.79.  The enchiladas had a nice flavor and kick. Both were very good, with the street tacos seeming deceptively small. 

The bill came to about $30 a person including drinks, but before taxes and gratuities. 

So Four Stars, and yes we are Fans of Cantina Laredo. While eating here might not get you a doggie bag for later, you will go home feeling as though you've enjoyed something special.  Remember to make reservations like we did! LOL

I expected Carson Kitchen to be a little busy based on the buzz, but not a 30 minute wait on a Sunday night.  At least my wife and I were able to get drinks and hang around their outdoor area in the back.  The whole thing was quite an eye opener for me.  Who would have thought even 5 years ago that something like this would be thriving on 6th St and Carson???  Amazing!

The dining area was a little cramped but still maintained a cool vibe.  The open kitchen, bustling servers and unique seating area kind of enhanced the experience.  I wouldn't come with more than a party of 4 until their outdoor and upstairs areas are done.  Our server informed us those areas would be complete in about a week.

I'd classify the fare as "New American".  Kerry and his staff do some really interesting twists.  Their "Wellington Empanada" was a delicious way to start the meal.  I enjoyed their take on the typical empanada crust.  It was light with some crunch and soaked up the excellent sauce on the plate nicely.  

My wife gasped when she saw they offered "Crispy Chicken Skins" and ordered it almost before our server got out the word "hello".  Breaded and deep fried chicken skin isn't exactly clean eating but holy shit was it awesome.  Maybe chicken skin really is the new bacon!  It was a glorious way to swiftly kick my diet right in the balls.  Both of us weren't really big on the smoked honey dipping sauce it came with and opted to use the rich empanada sauce instead.

We shared the "Rabbit Ragu" and the "Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak" done rare.  The rabbit was delightful and the sauce delivered a surpisingly spicy kick.  Thankfully, the spaghetti was made of squash.  I needed some vegetables after my mini guilt trip on the chicken skins :P The steak was a little more medium rare than rare but the sauce and light espresso flavor made up for it.

Can't wait to drink and dine outside next time!

So, my only question for La Grande Orange Pizzeria is...can I please live here?  Seriously, this place is GREAT!  There really is no formal division between the pizzeria and grocery parts of the store, so I'm going to talk about both.  Grocery-wise, the place carries a broad mix of classic candies, wines, cookbooks, tchotchkes that rotate seasonally (I've picked up some great holiday items here in years past), and grocery staples; they also have a cafe that serves up oatmeal, eggs (friends rave about the Commuter Sandwich), salads, sandwiches, and sushi rolls.  Word to the wise - bring some extra napkins because their bakery will make you drool!  Order up front at the counter, pick a seat, and then keep your ears perked for when they call your name.  Friendly staff, cool ambience - I always find myself Shazam-ing the music here!  ;)         

As far as the pizza is concerned, the crust is insane!  It almost reminds me of really good sourdough bread, toasted and crispy, not too thin and not too thick.  All the ingredients are fresh and the pizza permutations creative.  They serve up your pie on a slab of wood - nice presentation!  Sadly, I am a creature of habit - once I find something that's to my liking, I latch on and order it every time I return for the rest of my life :/ At this particular establishment, these personal faves would be the Rocket Man Pizza (spicy red fresno chilies, broccolini, roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes) and the Classic Chocolate Pudding - wow, just wow!  I make my poor husband drive all the way across town to come here - he always grumbles but in the end, admits that the place IS pretty delicious.  

The only negative - and it definitely a BIG negative - is the parking situation.  La Grande Orange has the tinsiest micro parking lot known to man.  On a good day if the parking lot gods are smiling down on you, you just might find an open 20 minute parking spot (I haven't been impressed that they actually enforce the time restrictions).  But, if you go on their website under the 'Secret Parking' link (shhhh!), you will find a diagram depicting other parking options that are slightly farther away.

So yeah, come check out La Grande Orange for some great pizza, brunch, baked goods, groceries...the list goes on.  One of my favorite places in Phoenix!

Thomas Keller is known for being a freakin' genius and since French Laundry is super expensive, Bouchon is a more cost-effective way to taste Chef Keller's masterpieces. 

So, I dragged 17 of my closest relatives here to experience one helluva breakfast! Many in my family, by the way, think IHOP is the best breakfast place on earth...*groan* *eyes roll* I hoped this place would give them an eye-opening, revelatory, perspective-altering dining experience!

FOOD (And yes, I sampled ALL these dishes):
Moules au Safran et a la Moutarde ($25.50) - WHOA. Mussels and fries for breakfast??? Oh hell yeah! I HAD to try it! Fries were cooked and salted perfectly. Tiny mussels steamed in white wine, mustard, and saffron...so tasty, so fresh! After the mussels were devoured, I wanted to grab the egg-shaped metal bowl and gulp down the remaining liquid. The white wine in that liquid was so distinct! Don't worry, I didn't lose my composure, I subtly used my spoon to enjoy the leftover yumminess.

Breakfast Americaine ($22) - This was served with two eggs any style, bacon, sausage, and toasted brioche. It also came with your choice of breakfast pastry, juice, and coffee. The most memorable thing about this dish was the surprisingly delicious strawberry croissant that didn't even look like a croissant. It was actually kind of ugly, but when I put a piece of it in my mouth...HOLY MOLY! I was surprised by how tasty it was! Warm, moist, sweet, with a hint of strawberry; soft and crunchy at the same time.

Bouchon French Toast ($12) - Brilliantly executed! A French toast cylinder with layers of bread pudding, brioche, custard, and apples. So light! so sweet! So moist! So nice to look at, I almost didn't want to eat it!

Gauffres ($12) - Waffles with fresh strawberries, sweetened with maple syrup and vanilla butter. Light, sweet, crunchy! Oh yesssss...

Les Oeufs ($13) - Nothing impressive. The scrambled eggs and country sausage were decent. The toasted brioche was good after I covered it with the made-in-house strawberry jam. I am not a fan of fruit preserves, actually I hate them but this strawberry jam was excellent. The potato croquettes were alright. Christopher C said they were good with ketchup.

Cinnamon Oatmeal w/Candied Orange Peel & Raspberry Puree ($7) - Bland but it was served in a cute little metal bowl. The raspberry puree was so subtle I could hardly tell it was there. And where was the candied orange peel? I couldn't see or taste it. The raspberries on top added a little flavor. It was a little better when we added the small cup of brown sugar that was included. We experimented and added some strawberry jam and oatmeal was way better!

Pecan Sticky Bun ($4.25) - Oh myyyyyy! Topped with crunchy pecans, this bun is very sticky, very sweet, and very good!

Hibiscus Champagne Cocktail ($12.50) - I ordered a mimosa but when they brought it, I saw this drink on the tray going to another table and I had to have one too! What a pretty cocktail! The hibiscus was fun to eat! When a person says no to this champagne, they say no to life!

SERVICE:
We had two waiters all to ourselves. We didn't wait too long for our drinks & food but they seemed to disappear after our food was served. It was hard to flag down our waitress when I wanted another champagne. Also, it took a while for my dad to get his coffee refilled.

I was proud of my family for being adventurous and trying something other than Ihop or McDonald's for breakfast. Even though we didn't get stellar service, they enjoyed their breakfast here. I sure LOVED it! After eating top quality food at this restaurant, I would love to eat at French Laundry. Hmmm...I might have to wait to win the lottery.

My first visit being so-so, I decided to give Teriyaki Madness a second try to see if I liked it any better. For me it was still the same so-so experience and I don't get the hype over this place. Inside is very clean and they have plenty of tables to choose from and the booths are spacious which is nice. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu. Some of the food I ordered was really good and some of it was not so good. I do get coupons in the mail sometimes for BOGO offers, so I can see coming back with a coupon and probably will since the rice and chicken are pretty darn good and I work in the area, but I can't see making a point to come here often. 

Spicy Chicken Teriyaki Plate ($8.99) - I took the white rice that came with it and mixed it with the chicken. I liked the flavor of the chicken a lot. There was a good portion of both rice and chicken. I'd order this again for sure. 

Spicy Beef Teriyaki Plate ($9.49) - For an extra $1 this time I chose noodles instead of rice. The noodles were a bit dry and lacked flavor. The beef was tender and tasted good, but I tasted teriyaki flavor and no spice which was a bummer because I had enjoyed the spicy chicken and the chicken actually kick. The overpowering flavor of teriyaki on this one will most likely mean that I will stick to the spicy chicken instead.

Chicken Egg Roll ($1.99) - Inside I saw tons of what appeared to be black pepper yet the egg roll really had no flavor. It was filled with a generous amount of chicken, but it was greasy and flavorless. 

Chicken Pot Stickers ($3.29) - These were a greasy and overcooked mess. On the menu these are described as "crazy good" and I got 5 of them that were crazy greasy and hard. The inside tasted not so great. I will stick to the stickers elsewhere. 

Stir-Fry Veggies and a Green Salad are each options for sides. The salad came with a sweet dressing that tasted good. The veggies were basic yet tasty and fresh. 

Orders are made fresh so if you are on a lunch break or crunched for time then call your order in so it's ready or at least being made while you are on your way to pick it up.

There have been some changes at the DMV and I'm impressed. No more waiting in a long line yay! This new "Dash Pass" system worked well. With the Dash Pass you can text, call or go online and put yourself in the line without having to even go down to the DMV until it's your turn. They will text you with how many people are ahead of you and your estimated wait time and then they send you a command list so you can text back whenever you want to find out things like how long your current wait time is or to let them know if you need more time or even if you want to be taken out of the line. They text you with fair enough warning about when your turn is so you know when to arrive at the DMV and they let you know around that time what window you will need to go to. This is seriously awesome! I never would have thought I'd give the DMV 5 stars, but this new system really worked great for me twice now and the employees were even really friendly. I needed to renew my license so I had to go inside. Usually I avoid going inside since they have the DMV kiosks around town at a variety of places and it's so convenient to stop and register your car at the kiosk and you can do it at any hour. Sometimes though you just can't avoid having to go inside and now it's not that bad having to do so. The snack bar seems to get bigger and bigger and the line of people at it cracks me up, but hey why not grab a hot dog, nachos or cotton candy while at the DMV? When it came time to pay for my license renewal and the lady told me it would cost $41.25 I was shocked. I asked why so much now and she said that I would be getting a license good for 8 years. Say what?!?! Apparently those born even numbered years get the 8 year license and those in odd numbered years that renew will continue to receive the 4 year license until 2017 and then get the 8 year license after that. I kind of like the idea of not having to go back for 8 years a lot. I'm kind of surprised though since people do age differently among other things. I didn't have an issue with finding a parking spot like I have many times before and that was nice. I'm guessing the parking lot wasn't so bad because people are maybe using Dash Pass. I am happy to say that I had a quick and painless experience at the DMV.

Dang, Cantina Laredo - I wanted to like you so hard!  Like a hot date that ends in a restraining order, like an incredible hike that ends in poison oak or skunk spray - I've walked past this place for years, imagining a swanky, high-end Mexican food joint behind the dark windows and high prices; sadly, what I found was a very regular, uninspired restaurant serving up some rather meh Mexican food.  This was a 'man behind the curtain' Wizard of Oz moment for me.

Good things?  Mmmmmm - the warm spicy salsa which they serve along with another milder cold one (not so good) and chips is the reason this place gets 2 very enthusiastic stars from me - SO DELICIOUS!  It was hook-me-up-to-a-feed-bag delicious.  Service was quick and pleasant.

After that though, it all goes downhill.  Being vegetarian, I can 99% of the time find something meatless and tasty when I go out to eat but there were very few such options here.  I ended up selecting the Enchiladas de Espinaca and subbed in a Cheese & Onion one to shake things up a bit (I know, I'm very exciting).  When my meal came out, the waitress said she had the kitchen put zucchini alongside my Mexican rice instead of beans (wtf - who in their right mind opts out of beans for zucchini at a Mexican food restaurant?!); so began the first of my meal modifications - I might note here that while being veggie, I am a pretty low-maintenance diner.  So, just as the black beans are being brought out, I realize the sauce atop my cheese enchilada consists of red chili with beef chunks - again wtf - in my 31 years of life on this earth, no Mexican food joint I've ever visited has ever converted a cheese enchilada to a meat one via the sauce!  The waitress said they could make me a new cheese & onion with sour cream sauce atop (cringe).  The mushroom and spinach enchilada was kinda gross - something about the oil they used to saut the spinach in gave it a strange taste and the button mushrooms looked like they had been plunked into it straight out of a can.  The zucchini and cheese & onion enchilada were nothing I would ever want to order again.  Black beans were alright - hard to mess those up though.  

In defense of Cantina Laredo, if you're a big meat eater, perhaps you might have more luck here than I.  The place was clean, the workers were nice, the one aforementioned salsa is killer.  But this place is neither authentic nor new-agey Mexican, not worthy of the steeper price points, and certainly lacks any great ambience to carry the lackluster food.  Don't think I will be auditioning this place for a second date or hike - would strongly consider rolling around in poison oak or getting skunk sprayed over coming back - it was that bad.

I'm a fan of Papa Murphy's. Some people are weird about buying pizza and sides that they have to bake at home, but that's just some people being weird. There is usually some type of deal going on and they send coupons in the mail, so with any type of deal it is really worth it considering what a frozen pizza costs and tastes like. You can call your order ahead or stop in and watch them make it fresh. You can choose lighter or extra sauce, cheese and toppings to customize the pizza to your liking. The employees inside this Papa Murphy's are friendly and helpful with going over specials, but when I went on grand opening day, the people there from Sunny 106.5 were very rude and didn't help represent Papa Murphy's well. I was actually relieved to find out it was the radio station being so rude and not the actual Papa Murphy's employees because it would have detoured me from going back. I did score a free pizza (the very last one, nice!) because they were giving out 100 free pizzas to customers that day. 

They have pizzas of all shapes and sizes. They have the mini-murph pizza kit to take home so your kids can put together a pizza for themselves and then see their creation after it bakes. The pizzas also come in signature, pan, delite and stuffed crusts. Most of the pizzas bake at 425 and only take around 10 minutes aside from the stuffed pizza which takes around 25 minutes. The pan pizza is definitely good, but beware when cooking the pan pizza and keep your eye on it because there is butter or something at the bottom of that one and it can burn easy if you let it go too long and when you take the pan pizza out of the oven it's really hot, so let it stand for 5 minutes before slicing. The cheesy bread comes in regular and thicker sizes, both being equally delicious. With a coupon I usually pay about $6 or $7 for a pizza and adding 2 sides it's $6, not including the thicker cheesy bread. One thing I tried on my last visit that I hadn't before is the s'mores dessert pizza. Wow that thing was good! I preferred the s'mores pizza much more than the chocolate chip cookie dough they offer and it is a great price as one of the 2 sides you can pick. My hubby likes the cookie dough here, but I personally do not. If you are signed up for the e-club they usually send you a coupon for free cookie dough on your birthday. They also have pumpkin shaped pizzas at Halloween time and heart shaped pizzas for Valentine's Day, usually at a special price that I like to pick up. All in all this is a decent take-n-bake pizza spot.

After my outstanding experience here, it goes without saying that Wolfgang Puck's take on steaks is a "cut" above the rest!

Tucked inside the Palazzo resort, Cut exhibited a refined contemporary appeal and warmth that was both inviting and comforting.  I especially enjoyed the service by Tara who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. 

After allowing us to peruse the menu for awhile, she returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts and I must say, they all looked enticing! 

Shortly after, we were served our wine and breads, which included the usual steakhouse suspects of fragrant & savory onion focaccia, pretzel roll, one of my personal favorites, mainly because of the firm outside texture and soft and chewy inside... and it wasn't too salty like most other pretzel breads I've come across. 
Parmesan bread stick took a close second  place for its addictive light, crisp & crunchy texture with a generous coating of Parmesan breading on the outside.

Bone Marrow Appetizer - From the buttery soft marrow to the warm, flavorful mushroom sauce, it was a blissful combination of ingredients and love. Simply unbelievable. If there's one single dish from this entire trip, I will be craving for months afterwards, it will definitely be this!

Steak Tasting 
American Kobe Style from snake river - paired with a house steak sauce. The beef was perfectly tender and seared beautifully leaving my mouthwatering for another juicy bite. The tangy flavor of the steak sauce was a perfect addition to the meat as it brought on a bright acidity to the steak. Let it be known, I'm determined to get the recipe for that irresistible sauce!!!!
USDA prime dry aged - much softer and juicier than the New York, this cut of steak was praiseworthy in every way. Honestly, it was a cut of perfection on a plate and the accompanying chimichurri sauce added a brightness to my palate that made it all the more satisfying. 
Australian wagyu from Blackmore -
Worthy of it namesake, was truly the best of the best. It's like they took 50 steaks and concentrated all the beefiness into one bite. The best steak I've ever had. It came with a barnaise sauce but honestly this piece needed nothing to dress it. It was perfect all on its own.

White corn had a fresh & crunchy bite with a slightly sweet caremelized exterior that added a pleasant rustic flavor to the dish 

Dessert
Baked Alaska - Tasted like a giant strawberry mochi. Btw, that's a good thing!  It also came with a small lemon bar, which had a lip puckering natural citrusy flavor!

Banana Creme pie came with chocolate ice cream, sauce, and chocolate crunch pearls. Now that's what I call a triple chocolate threat! Having said that, It was surprisingly mild and less cloyingly sweet, which I really enjoyed.

Before we left, Tara gave us more sweets in the form of a chocalate truffle cookie bar and a chewy peanut brittle...both were absolutely delicious! 

Service was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. But i'd have to say Tara made all the difference! She transformed a pleasant meal to an unforgettable dining experience with her natural charm and warm tableside manner, which easily made the evening five stars in my book!

Bravo to CUT for an exquisite meal and extraordinary service! 

You bet ill be back for an encore! 

Until then...

Happy Eats!

I don't expect this to go anywhere, especially given the level of customer service (or lack thereof)  I received this past weekend at the SLS Las Vegas. Nevertheless, I feel the need to vent so here goes.

I booked a 4-day stay at the SLS in order to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday as well as to ask her to marry me. I had heard that the SLS was a small hotel, recently refurbished and that it provided a hip and trendy way yet friendly atmosphere. I was especially attracted to the fact that the SLS is somewhat removed from the strip and that afforded us some much needed quiet and privacy.

24-hours prior to my arrival I called the hotel to confirm my reservation (which I booked directly with the hotel on-line) as well as to advise reservations that I had a late flight in and therefore required late check-in. At first the agent couldn't locate my reservation and actually told me that I did not have one. After 20-minutes on the telephone he finally located my reservation under the confirmation number i had given him. He told me that he would notate the system about the late arrival and that I should have no problems from there.

I arrived at the SLS shortly before midnight on the 8th only to find out that my reserved room had been assigned to someone else. The agent at the counter seemed clueless about what to do next so I jokingly suggested that she upgrade me to a suite - which she said she would do. The problem? Well the "suite" was a room with two under-sized double beds. Given that this was supposed to have been a romantic getaway long weekend I did not consider the sleeping arrangements to be ideal. I then proceeded to call the front desk who told me they would call me at 10AM the next day when my original room became available. The call never came.

At 11:00 AM on the 9th I went to the front desk to inquire about the room and was told by the employee that no rooms were available, that I should consider myself lucky to have the room I had because it was better than my original room and that perhaps I should check out and try to check back in after 3PM if something became available. Really?!?!?! Not being able to tolerate any more stupidity my girlfriend and I decided to go to the SLS buffet for breakfast. While on the way I stopped to ask an employee if the buffet was open and where it was located. They told me that they didn't know where it was located and went on to tell me that they were likely no longer serving food at 11:30 AM so my girlfriend and I went to the MGM buffet instead. We subsequently found out that the SLS Buffet is indeed open for breakfast, lunch and dinner - but more to follow on that one. 

While all of this was going on my girlfriend was attempting to track down a package that she had delivered to the hotel. The person at the front desk told her to check with the FedEx Office. The FedEx Office told her to check with the mail room. Nobody knew anything about the package so I asked the concierge and explained the story to her. She was surprised to learn that the SLS had an actual mail room. She did locate it, however we were promptly informed that we could not go to the mail room because it was an employee only area. The concierge was helpful in that she offered to have a bell-hop deliver the package, the problem however is that the package wasn't delivered to us until 4-hours after the request.

Back to the room fiasco - we stayed in the room with the undersized beds. The lack of helpfulness of the staff wore us out.

Back to the buffet - we finally made it there Sunday. The food was great, it's a shame that there was nobody around to bring us drinks - the wait staff (in typical SLS fashion) was missing and less than helpful.

Oh and then there is the cab ride where the valet at the gate stopped our cab driver to yell at him (using profanities) and asking what country he thought he was driving in because he accidentally turned out in the wrong direction.

To top it all off everyone at the SLS kept addressing me as Mr. Fxxxxo when my name is Sxxxxxe. Fxxxxo is my girlfriends last name. Given that I made the reservations, that I paid for the trip and that everything was under Sxxxxxe I am unsure why the SLS couldn't get something as simple as my name right. 

SLS - Our experience was horrible. I ended up not proposing to my girlfriend because of the stress that you put on both of us. You ruined my girlfriend's long birthday weekend and we will never be back. It's really a shame because on the surface the SLS is a great hotel but when you put lipstick on a pig you still have a pig and that is exactly what the SLS is - a painted pig.

Again, I expect this will fall on deaf ears but I really needed to vent.

I'm the first real person to review this place, let all other fake spammers be gone!  Yelp should really work that shizzle out.  Zack S...um this place closes at 11 so you couldn't have possibly hit the bar...so yeah if your gonna post fake reviews at least check your facts..

This place has so much potential, yet the ridiculously bad service just overshadowed everything good they did.

This is probably the worst service I have ever received in my life.  

Do you guys remember in Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts goes into the first store on Rodeo and the snooty lady acts like she's too good for this place?  Well that's what they did to us.

Where's the hostess?  Oh she's chatting with her friend...*ignoring me*

We finally get seated and then we sit and wait...

and wait...

and wait...

finally I get up and ask one of the waiters at the cash register to send over someone...

She treats us like we're a nuisance to her, she's singing along to the song that's playing...(WTF?)  I think they turned up the music louder as more people left because by the time it was near closing time it was blaring hip hop music...really weird considering it was a nice casual Italian restaurant.

We order almost 200 bucks worth of food, and then she's like "is that it?"

excuse me bitch...watch the attitude...

Wait, wait, watch as all the waiters get together to talk about us...seriously I can see you whispering about us....this is so unprofessional right now....

We seriously waited for like an hour and a half, it was ridiculous!  The place was practically empty!  The waiters were standing around and chatting with each other.  I took pictures as evidence!

This place is supposed to be a nice place, for the prices they charge they should have a whole restaurant re-staffed because it was ridiculous!  I have never felt more uncomfortable and treated so rudely in my life!

I also wanted to order take out for later and apparently they don't have take out boxes?  You're a restaurant?  You don't have boxes?  Seriously?

This is the worst experience in a restaurant I have ever had.  I've gotten better service at Carls Jr in a shady neighborhood than this.  

I won't hesitate to tell everyone to avoid this restaurant when you're in Vegas because this was outrageous!  No one treats me like that and gets away with it!  I wish I had a You've been yelped card so I could give them a piece of my mind.

I'm like those crazy housewives who have nothing better to do...I won't stop calling to speak to management until someone is fired.  I'm serious, no one gets away with treating me like that without suffering repercussions.  We don't play that, I'm sorry I'm not one of those quiet asian people who take your shit...I will not be silenced... You best believe.  You're done..The end.


*note I left for the manager*

"This is probably the most unprofessional and ridiculous restaurant I have ever had the misfortune to experience, not just from the our waitress, but the waitstaff and blatant ignorance from most of the employees I had to encounter."
                                                                   Anthony Nguyen

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 52/100

Stayed in this hotel with my bf for the first time a few weeks ago and absolutely LOVED IT!

I had never heard of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay before. Apparently it's the nicer of the two towers at Mandalay Bay, and consists entirely of suite-style hotel rooms. 

My bf had booked our stay about four months in advance through Expedia, and he only paid around $110 per night for a HUGE suite for the two of us! It was amazing and you definitely get a bang for your buck!

Parking is free, as with most if not all of the hotels in Vegas. The parking garage is HUGE and has stairs, escalators, and elevators. There's also valet parking and a taxi drop off/pick up area.

Check-in was quick and easy. Lines weren't long and it took us around 5 minutes.

Decor/ambience is really great in this hotel. It doesn't really have a theme like a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's just modern, classy, and trendy. I really liked it!

Elevators were kinda confusing since depending on what floor you're on, you have a certain set of elevators you have to take. However, the elevators are AWESOME and INCREDIBLY fast! We stayed on the 20th floor and it only took a few seconds to get from our room down to the lobby and back!

Our suite was AMAZING. There was a living room area that had a couch, desk, chairs, coffee table, and a huge television! There was also a guest bathroom located right by the door if you have people over. It's a 1/2 bath so just a sink and toilet, but still really awesome! There's also a mini-bar area, but make sure you don't touch any of the items there because they are monitored with a weight system, and you are automatically charged for anything you pick up. 

The bedroom area of our room was really nice. We had an incredible king sized bed with a HUGE wall unit that had a TV in the middle, and his and hers closets on either side of it. The closets even had lights inside to see your clothes, and robes, slippers, hangers, etc.!

Our main bathroom was HUGE! It came with two sinks, toilet, a big shower, and a ginormous bathtub that could fit like 3 people in it. My college dorm room was honestly smaller than this bathroom...it was crazy!

The Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson show plays at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. We didn't watch it, but we plan on watching it during one of our future visits! 

The MIX Lounge at the top of the hotel is supposed to be da bomb. We didn't end up going up there but we saw a ton of people waiting in line to go up.

The ONLY things I didn't love about THEhotel were:

1) LACK OF WIFI IN ROOMS. I think they only had ethernet but that is useless when you only have your smart phone and iPad with you.

2) NO REFRIGERATOR IN SUITE. The bf tried to create a makeshift refrigerator with our ice bucket. Didn't really work...

3) LOCATION. That it's on the far south end of the strip. Like literally the last hotel. Fortunately we drove to Vegas so we used our car to drive further up the strip, but if you don't have a car I can imagine it being a huge issue. It's quite a long walk from THEhotel towards the middle/north end of the strip.

I would definitely stay at THEhotel again and highly recommend it! 5 stars!

First and foremost this is my first review and I cant believe how absolutely appalled I am.  But, here it goes.....So my wife and I are in town for a family emergency and decided to have lunch because we had a lil time on our hands. We drove past HAG on LV blvd and it caught my eye because of the name and I love a great burger. Upon entering I was excited and looking forward to it the place seems almost like a Hooters but for Burgers. The smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicky for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear items that others have wore before but I figured hey WTH the waitress we had was very personable and  nice but was new. the prices were very high for such a simple menu. My wife ordered the smallest burger and fries and I was talked into the Quad bypass burger. with like 20 strips of bacon! I asked our waitress if the restaurant offered military discount as I often do when I am on a budget and travelling. She said "Let me ask" upon returning she said "No sorry" I was thanked her for asking. Either way I though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so I was looking forward to the food regardless. At this point I was very excited and amused on the place and was talking to my wife about how this place should/would be a goldmine. They offered malt liquor (Strange in a restaurant)in a can I ordered a Tecate she a sugar Coke.
Now for the twist of events..... Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes which is great but I was skeptical, The Burger was massive and looked so good but it was warm to the touch at best I had approx 3 bites and noticed the bacon looked as if had been microwaved from being cooked days ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistency-(Gross) The cheese was not melted, The fries looked like they were cooked in old oil due to the almost black color in nature. I tried my hardest to stomach this but I couldnt. I proceeded to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cooked to order at first she replied yes and then said something that made me raise an eyebrow, she began on informing me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old because of the way the owner is. I asked her to elaborate and she said he is so cheap that he makes his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut costs. She also informed me she almost walked out her second day on the job because of what he acts like in his day to day operations. She looked excited when I asked to speak to him about the quality and preparation of my food. When the Owner/manager Jon came to the table he sat down opposite from me and was very hostile. At this point I was pretty much amazed I would assume he would address my concerns in a professional and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimidation and apprehension. I said I would please like another burger due to the dissatisfaction of it not being fresh. He looks at myself and my wife and says' " In six years I have never comped a meal and it won't be today!!" I proceeded to inform him I simply wanted another burger and I am not looking for a comp. He then informed us that he would call the police if we didnt pay I said I would not pay for a burger like this especially one that i didnt touch. From his demeanor at this point I wanted to leave so i said look I will pay for my wifes and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this quality of food.
At this point I felt threatened and was basically being held against my own will. I said fine Please call the police. He proceeds to lean over and say, You know what " you started it when you asked for a discount" I was like "What"? He then says I cant stand the "F" ing military I was so appalled that he was addressing me like this in general and then he begins to say, I'm from Oxnard, Ca. and we used to beat the "S" out of filthy mexicans like you! At this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief He leaves and the table next to me were also expressing there disgust in the food and as he saw us speaking with them he said to leave right now we were trespassing! As I leave I attempt to tip my waitress and he rips the money from my hand! My wife and I wait outside for the police THE WHOLE TIME WE are waiting quietly the owner is harrassing us going on a tirade about my race and my occupation being totally distasteful in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up (LVPD) I provide them ID and they are in absolute disbelief they resolve the issue after questioning and bottom line it does not matter the police officer said I had to pay I totally understand and uphold the law but requested that I receive what I pay for (At least I gave it away to a homeless man.
BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: 1. DO NOT GO THERE FOR QUALITY OR FRESHNESS  IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS NOT 2. THE OWNER IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING. 3.YOU ARE WARNED. PLEASE DONT BE ROBBED OR DEGRADED LIKE ME  GO ANYWHERE ELSE.

Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas, Carlo's Bakery! I ate at Buddy V's a couple weeks ago and one of the managers stopped at our table to check on us. After letting him know I was a "Cake Boss" fan, he let me know when the bakery would be opening and that contestants from "Next Great Baker" would be there. I obviously cleared my schedule for opening day! Carlo's Bakery (located inside The Venetian) is literally right across from Buddy V's and the pathway between them is a little more narrow than usual, so I wondered about how they were going to tame the long lines because there was no way there wouldn't be one.  

The grand opening was at 6 pm, so I wanted to get there early hoping to beat some of the crowd. I had my hubby and 2 nieces with me and we arrived to Carlo's Bakery around 5 pm to find a long line formed already. Venetian security had a field day with this one! We found our place at the end of the line and even though there were a lot of people in front of us, the line only grew l-o-n-g-e-r behind us. I was thankful for the spot we had after seeing just how long the line got! I appreciated that we were given samples from Carlo's employees while we waited. So let me talk about the wait. WOW! It was almost a 4 hour wait from the time we first got in line and actually got inside the bakery. I know that is a long time, but it wasn't so bad with all the activity going on around us. Between the free samples and seeing people from Next Great Baker and Cake Boss go by and stop to talk to us and take pictures, it didn't feel like 4 hours and honestly was a freaking blast! Hubby was a real trooper holding our spot in line while we would take off to get our picture with Buddy, Grace, Danny, Mary and people from NGB. 

Poor Buddy! He really didn't have the proper help keeping people back (like I said the pathway is a little more narrow than usual) and at one point they did have a line to meet him, but they had to stop it because so many people were crowding around and there wasn't a clear path for the people walking by who had no idea what Carlo's Bakery even was lol. At one point, Buddy came back for pictures and my nieces and I were able to get a picture. After the picture, Buddy gave one of my nieces a great big hug and a kiss on her forehead. She was SO excited smiling bright and cried a little saying "I'm never washing my face again" ...bless her precious young heart! They both had a blast and it's one experience they will never forget, myself included!

One inside the bakery, we were greeted and the girl who helped us was very friendly and helpful. it was kind of crazy inside the bake shop with people, so I just randomly picked out different things I could see. Ordering was quick, but getting what I ordered took a bit. While we waited (maybe 10 minutes) the sweet smell inside was heaven and I liked the open windows showing the bakers working. They have these windows not just inside the bakery, but outside too. When my name was called I went up to pay for my order and saw everything was packaged nicely. This was a great experience and I will most definitely be back!

Lobster Tails ($5.95) - Excellent! Try this! It's flaky with a cream inside and a little Bailey's Irish Cream. This was my favorite of what I tried. 

Eclair ($2.50) - This was cut if half and had a filling. It also had chocolate on top. This was pretty good. I thought at first site that it didn't have enough chocolate on it, but the chocolate was thick and the right amount.

Cream Puff ($2.50) - Custard filled with powdered sugar on top. I took a bite and thought it was good, so I told hubby to try it and he finished it. Glad I at least got a bite!

Chocolate Cannoli ($3/Mini) - This I figured I would like, but I ended up loving it! The amount of filling was decent. I'd order this one again.

Cannoli ($2.50/mini) - The filling has a ricotta cream with chocolate chips. I did like this one a lot and would eat it again, but I personally preferred the chocolate cannoli.

Strawberry Tart ($2.85) - This was my least favorite. If you do try this, I would recommend eating it soon. When I got home with my box, the strawberry tart looked like it melted a bit and the strawberry slid off. None of that really bothered me because I hadn't had it before and didn't know it wasn't something that didn't travel well. The way it tasted did bother me though, The bottom was rock hard and I had trouble even biting into it. I might try it again in the future, but am in no rush.

Chocolate Fudge Cupcake ($3.50) - I had the option between a vanilla or chocolate cupcake and chose the chocolate. It had a chocolate fudge frosting with sprinkles on top. This was just average. Not bad, but not great.

Carrot Cupcake ($3.50) - Of the 2 cupcakes I tried, this was the best. The cupcake was moist and the cream cheese frosting was very good. 

They also have merchandise for sale (mugs, cookbooks, etc.) and take special orders for cakes and other goodies.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 58/100

Dining at Gordon Ramsay Steak was what I was most looking forward to on my most recent trip to Las Vegas. Fortunately, Chef Ramsay did not disappoint! Post-vacation, I still believe that our date night at Gordon Ramsay Steak was my favorite part of our weekend getaway!

GR Steak is located inside the Paris Hotel, right in the middle of the casino at the front of the hotel. The seating hostesses/kiosk are actually right outside of the restaurant, and I don't think they let you in unless you have a reservation or they're ready to take you inside.

We had made a reservation several months in advance, although I don't think you need to wait THAT long to reserve ahead of time. When you first enter, you are in a cylindrical tunnel that serves as the restaurant bar. Apparently it is supposed to represent the London Tube, and represents you traveling from Paris (the hotel) into England, GR's homeland.

While waiting for our table to be setup, they had seated us at the bar. After about a 5-10 minute wait, we were finally seated at our table, kind of off to the side near the kitchen/bathrooms.

I was kind of surprised at how busy/noisy it was in the restaurant. I knew it would be popular with GR's name tacked onto it, but it was a lot bigger and noisier than I had expected. Not a super intimate, romantic date nice restaurant. More trendy and lively.

Service was EXCELLENT at GR Steak! Our waiter, Freddy, was awesome. He came out and introduced himself, and then provided us with an iPad 2 that had the entire drink menu on it. It was really awesome because it showed photos of each mixed drink, the list of ingredients, etc. Then it had the beer and wine list as well. The last tab consisted of a photo and biography of Gordon Ramsay.

They also had a tasting menu, complete with autographed keepsake photo of Gordon Ramsay, but it looked pretty heavy and was also very expensive so we opted out of it. Freddy wheeled around a cart to our table and explained all of the different cuts of meat. Very informative and I loved the visual display. Freddy's speech was a bit scripted, but he said it with a smile and was very polite and well-mannered, which I really enjoyed! The guy who brought out our food/bussed our table was also super friendly and very courteous! Excellent service as well.

What we ordered:

--BREAD--
Ok, I had to mention this because they give you four types of bread with this butter that supposedly has volcanic salt on it, and omg, this is probably some of the best bread and butter I've ever had at a restaurant. All 4 types were incredible and I felt like I almost got full just from the bread! AND when the guy packed our to-go boxes, he packed us a fresh batch of new bread and butter! SO AWESOME!

--DRINKS--
PIMMS CUP: 
Wasn't a huge fan. I was interested because it had Pimms lemonade but it didn't taste that great. Also I felt like it had too much stuff added into it, like different slices of fruit and mint leaves.

WYDERS PEAR CIDER:
The description literally said it would give a pleasant ticklish kick. Definitely did!

--STEAKS--
BEEF WELLINGTON:
So, I basically felt obligated to order this because I knew Beef Wellington is Chef Ramsay's signature dish. I've never had Beef Wellington before so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I really loved the flakiness of the crust, and it blew my mind how it wasn't soggy at all! The meat was soft and delicious. I could also taste the lining of foie gras and that was pretty interesting. I didn't LOVE the foie gras but I thought it was good.

KOBE FILET MIGNON:
My boyfriend decided to YOLO and go with the Kobe filet mignon. Pricey, but totally worth it! I had a piece and omg, that was some melt in your mouth steak! He could not get over how good it was and said it was the best steak he's ever had. Excellent!

--SIDE DISH--
TRUFFLE MAC N CHEESE:
I LOVE me some truffles AND mac n cheese, so this was a winner! Super ooey gooey and cheesy, just the way I like it!

--DESSERT--
STICKY TOFFEE BREAD PUDDING WITH BROWN BUTTER ICE CREAM: OMG, this was SO FREAKING GOOD! I was really sad that I didn't finish mine because I was already so full...but seriously, I was in love with this dessert. I would go back JUST for the dessert. Interestingly enough, I thought that the ice cream was much sweeter than the sticky toffee pudding. They complimented each other very well and it was great! Highly recommend!

Overall I think my boyfriend spent around $250. TOTALLY WORTH IT! I would come back again for sure! :) Great job, Chef Ramsay and staff!

We have really enjoyed other Ramsay restaurants. The wait for BurGR is just ridiculous! We were told it would be a 2 hour wait and they would let us know by text (they text your phone) when the table was ready. I'm not much of a burger eater and rarely order them anywhere, but with Ramsay having his name on the restaurant must mean it's going to be worth the 2 hour wait right? Wong! When I first heard how long the wait would be, I wasn't even upset. I had been wanting to try BurGR and with a wait time like that I got more excited to try one of these well loved burgers. One thing is they have strict rules here at BurGR. When we got the text alert that our table was ready, some of us needed to use the restroom on our way back to the restaurant. Now we were on the property, never left. The hostess still refused to seat anybody until everybody was there and accounted for. Really? it seemed like we were on a field trip and the bus driver was counting heads to make sure everyone was on the bus.

Once we got seated it took 10 minutes for our server to acknowledge us and he took our appetizer order, but not our food order. He literally took off after we said what app we wanted. Around 15 minutes later our "Roasted Jalapeno Poppers" priced at $12 showed up at the table. They looked so good!!! Too bad they didn't live up to what I saw. The insides were still cold. It was only hot on the outside and the poppers were a real disappointment to our whole table. The cheddar ranch that comes with it just tasted like regular ranch. The poppers come in shot glasses with the ranch and we still had one left on the table that nobody really wanted. 20 minutes later our server came back to take our dinner order. Phew it was some wait time from beginning to finish at this place! Hubby and I decided to split a burger and a hot dog and the fries and rings are a generous portion so we just got 1 order of each for the table to share. 

"Just Fries" ($8) - They are hand-cut and come with a side each of curry ketchup and chipotle ketchup. I really feel for the price you get a lot of fries and even if sharing, you will still have plenty. The problem is the fries came out ice cold. I picked one up to taste and spit it back out. Nobody at our table wanted to eat the fries. 

"Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings" ($9) - Parmesan cheese on the rings with  chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip on the side. Again, the portion and price are very fair, but the rings were straight up ice cold and the ranch is ranch, nothing cheddar about it. 

"American Burger" ($13) - The burger had american cheese, onions, tomatoes, pickles and butter lettuce. When our food arrived to the table, 40 minutes after placing the order, I'm pretty sure my mouth started to drool as the burger was put down in front of me. It looked very good. I will say they after cutting the burger in half, I noticed that it was cooked just as I requested which is actually hard to come by here in Vegas. Too bad the actual burger had zero flavor. The burgers are grilled over apple and cider wood is what they brag about here yet the burger seriously had no flavor and like the other food it wasn't even warm. There was way too much bun going on with this burger and every time I took a bite the bread fell apart as the rest of the burger. It was just not good at all. There wasn't anything I ate during this experience that was enjoyable. 

"Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg" ($13) - Too much dog, not enough bun. Did taste decent, but they need a bigger bun for it. Better than the burger! Hmmm.

I let our server know that the food was cold and the fries and rings were so ice cold that  t hey must have been sitting for a while. Our server responded with "Sorry, I was busy doing stuff and then I had to go to the bathroom" to which I replied "did you at least wash your hands after touching your junk and brought our food" and he just said "I'll take the fries off" and then he was gone. The whole meal should have been free since it was mostly still on the table because we didn't want to eat it. I said very clearly and loudly that I had a total rewards card to get the discount on our bill and he just shrugged it off and charged the card with the regular prices anyway. If you have a total rewards card then you save so much off each menu item. So you can see where this can actually add up every time a menu item is added to the tab. I said something to him and he said that he would correct it, but it would take a long time and the card would have to be charged twice to fix it. We just said to forget it and I told him it would come from his tip. My friend ordered a burger and paid extra to have an egg added and was specific about it having a runny yolk. Our server said that wouldn't be a problem, but when our food came the egg on her burger was cooked way too long meaning no runny yolk. Such a major disappointment Gordon Ramsay BurGR turned out to be.
