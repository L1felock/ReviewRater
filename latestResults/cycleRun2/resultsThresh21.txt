Coach has separate distribution channels for Outlets, which is not the same as you find in their store. These are cheaper, less expensive bags.  So when see the "Now $169, originally $298", keep in mind they were never sold someplace else for $298.00.

Simply put, you can buy it cheaper at Macy's during a sale!  Ugh.

I was unimpressed today with this do it yourself (DIY) car wash. 

It was a nice touch having a credit card accepting swipper to go with that Quarter eating dial apparatus that starts at $1.75

However the water pressure is low and the "Spotless" setting is sadly all but ineffective.  In a hard water area like greater Phoenix, you would think they could get this right.

Best shop in town.
Every employee at Dyno-Comp is well-informed and treats the business like their own. This translates to quality work and attention to detail, as well as attention to the client.  Nobody is trying to screw you or upsell, and the work they do is bar none the best available.
I personally have dealt with Richard, Ken, and Ron, and could not be happier.

This is probably the easiest trail that you're ever going to hike besides walking around your block. You only go up an additional 400 plus feet in elevation during the hike. I believe the total loop is a little over 4 miles. This is a great hike for beginners and hiking in groups where you can have casual conversations. There are some rocky parts but mostly this is a dirt trail. This hike at a slow walking pace is about a two hour hike. There are some nice vistas so bring your camera.

We came here for a birthday cruise and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly!

It was a cool 100 degrees that day.  The water breezes made it very nice and tolerable.  The boat did have AC, but we just enjoyed our time on the deck and the feeling of floating along with the currents.  

One of the many cool things are the boaters speeding along the lake.  One had a small pup with a life vest sitting out front, letting his tongue hang out as he enjoyed the wind in his face (photo). Hilarious!

Saguaro Lake is a lot of fun, so bring a camera.

Enjoy!

I think this place took notes of the complaint of the smoke smell here, cuz as soon as i walked in here, i felt like the place was doused in perfume. I had a headache, and this place made me super nauseous with their overpowering vanilla scent trying to hide the smoke. 
Other than that, the place is beautiful- and has one of my favorite stops in vegas- Jean Phillipe Patisserie. Dude stayed here before for a bachelor party and our friends stayed here also. Thumbs up on their stay. Very modern rooms. 
And more important note again, there is a Jean Phillipes.

There are three free tram systems that operate on the west side of the strip. They're a great alternative to the $5 a ride monorail that runs on the east side. Working north, you can get from Mandalay to Excalibur. Get off at Excalibur and cut through New York New York. Enter the Monte Carlo and jump the Monte Carlo to Bellagio tram. I think this one is the more impressive of the trams. While you're waiting for the Monte Carlo tram you can ogle people lounging around Monte Carlo's pool. 

Beat that Toronto Transit!

After getting off at the Bellagio, you can cut through Caesar's Palace and get to the Mirage. At the Mirage you can board the third tram north to the pretty damn ghetto Treasure Island. And from Treasure Island you can then cross the road to the Fashion Show mall.

This tram is located in the back of the two casino resorts. 

The tram itself is nice, but the ride is quite short. But, if you don't feel like walking across from the one resort to the next, then this will help you get over. This is also free too!

I was really impressed by this bagel option at CLT.  

Granted CLT seems to have an Einstein Bagels everywhere, but this one offers a more interesting food option.  The sandwich was very good. But I felt for the folks behind the counter who were friendly, but because it was New Years Day, looked like they were pulling a double shift.

I ordered the Turkey bagel.  It was very good, had a fair amount of meat on it and the bagel stood up to the toasting. All pluses in my book.

Mama Mia! Fast food Italian. Who woulda thunk it? Well. Somebody incompetent and passionless. I would rename this place Yuckoli's. Fits better. 

I knew I was treading on dicey turf going to this joint. But it was in Rickie's old hood and the culinary establishments were limited to fast food and chain restaurants. So I went basic with spaghetti and meatballs (oh God, really, for the love of balls, these circular beef objects were filled with some sawdust like material and blander than Jennifer Aniston's movie career). Not good. We also tried a chicken Alfredo like dish that apparently was made with Elmer's glue. 

Pasty. Bland. And, yes, it does stick to construction paper. 

I wasn't expecting much. But I wasn't expecting to be grossed out. All I can say is "Mama Mia, papsa a pee'ah, daddy's got the diarrhea".

Vanguard has been at the forefront of the low cost/ low management fee mutual fund movement started by John Bogle some forty plus years ago. 

Bogle's philosophy was based in part on the concepts put forth by the University of Chicago Nobel economist Harry Markowitz. It stated that the stock market was truly efficient, and therefore impossible to outperform through stock selection.  Instead, Vanguard offers an Index approach to overcome this conundrum.

Today, the equity markets have embraced the Index fund movement.  No longer is Vanguard just Index'er, but have grown to include ETFs and annuities as well.  Though headquartered back east in Pennsylvania, their Scottsdale complex is huge.  I've found it equally impressive driving past there at 6 am and seeing the entire parking lot full.

As Harry Markowitz proved, it is was impossible to outperform the market by timing your purchases of stocks, so consider an index instead. Yes, I am a fan.

Ok, so now that I have your attention, let's talk about Cafe Teaze. It's a cross between a boba shop and a Vietnamese coffee shop, to some extent. What the knockout for me is their plain milk tea, it is extraordinary. The tea flavor is unmistakably noticeable without being overwhelming. Cafe Teaze unquestionably makes some of the best boba in town. Soft on the outside with a slight chew on the inside, it is carried out to magnificence!

Truthfully, The boba babes in their bikini's and lingerie's are another reason to pop in this budding enterprise. Not only do they look terrific, but they are welcoming and attentive. But please everyone, don't be a male copulatory organ and just come here just to look at the girls, order something like a drink or some food, it's still a business!!!

H&M. Must stand for Happy and Man. Cuz that's what I was after my shopping spree here recently. We scored three pairs of pants and three or four shirts for $150. And I'm talking styling threads dudes! Not some Buffalo Exchange leftovers. Loved that the men's section is on the entire first floor, right when you walk in. It's kind of divided up into three sections, with plenty of merchandise but not so cluttered you accidentally brush up against a strangers boobies while navigating the aisles. Would have liked a better selection of sunglasses (HELLO THIS IS ARIZONA) and belts (HELLO...Oh, I don't really have an end to this one...).

Luckily there was a card on me so my last purchase was recorded.  She was able to find the color of my lost lip gloss.  She also told me that a percentage of the sale of this particular gloss goes to help Aids.  Interesting. I bought two lip glosses.

We are a family of six and moving from a 3200 sq. ft. home is no easy feat.. After interviewing several other moving companies, choosing Creative Moving and Packing was an easy decision. Conrad was professional, knowledgable, and flexible - our closing date changed 3 times and Conrad said, "no problem, we'll make it work".  The employees that packed us up and moved us were friendly and courteous; they helped make one of the most stressful events in life (moving) into a smooth transition for me and my family. I highly recommend this company for any type of move.

Next month, I'll be crossing off the 49th state to enter the Union. Alaska, doncha know? And because my friends are planning on taking me to see the Northern Lights, it's gonna be seriously cold. Like 20 below if I'm lucky. So I need gear. Where else to go but Bass Pro for their huge selection and reasonable prices?

I managed to find some inexpensive boots and socks that will keep my feet warm, a good hat to keep my head and face toasty, and a few other odds and ends that should be good for the Arctic weather I am expecting.

Bass Pro also has tons of other goodies, like hunting and fishing equipment, camping gear, exercise wear and of course, everyone's looking for their Duck Dynasty goodies. Here's the place for all of it and more. Need an ATV or an outboard motor? How's about a kayak or a tent? Yep, Bass Pro has it.

This is a message I received from the owner and my response

Owner: 
Hi,
This is Wes From Polished Nails and Spa on Rainbow Blvd...
I believe youve left negative comments on the wrong Salon. You may have intended to comment on a differant Polished, whom we are not affilaited with. Our staff is all Vietnamese and we never have had a tabitha here. Would you consider deleting the comment?

Wes


My reply:
Hi Wes,

No I did NOT write a comment on the wrong salon. In case you didn't see the stars it wasn't negative it was NEUTRAL. 

As far as "Tabitha" is concerned... if you actually read the post, you would see that I was referring to a television show... and when I got my brows waxed that day... it was funky.

I have come to Polished several times since that review and HAVE had good experiences; however if this is how you treat your clientele and choose to be someone who censors others about their own personal opinions, congratulations you have lost a customer and I am cancelling my appointment for Friday.

Could this store BE any smaller (said in my best Chandler Bing voice)? I seriously walked in with Rickie, stayed 90 seconds, and said "Dude, I gotta git outta here!" Fortunately they had a guitarist/singer on the back patio with a coffee pot full of java and some cookies. How cool is that? Said musician was eventually joined by a little girl who played her clarinet. Played is being kind. Poor thing. That clarinet squeaked more than the brakes on my 95 ghetto beemer. More than Peter Brady's voice during puberty. But how cute it was. How very Bohemian. Rickie scored The Knife CD he's been looking for and the staff was VERY helpful and not all weird slacker don't bother me cuz I'm too cool to move from behind the counter cuz I just know you two queers are looking for Brittney Spears or Madonna crap and that is so lame...NO...not at all. Nicest of nice. And we were cool. Besides. I'd never heard of The Knife. That was always my nickname for OJ. And he WAS not there. Oh. Cuz he's in jail! HA HA! Anyway, I digress. Stinkweeds! Neither stinky. Nor weedy! Check it 08 my yelpitas. Love you!!!!!

"Exit to lef"
Every time I hear this, I'm thinking, "There's a t at the end of left! A t for God sakes"! Then I calm down and fixate on the homeless man rubbing his feet.

While I'm glad I don't have to rely on public transportation to get work (I walk actually), I LOVE having it in my hood. I've taken it to the movies, to get a haircut and to the movies and to get a haircut. OK. So I haven't used it that much. 

Trains arrive, it seems, in 10 to 15 minute intervals. Trains are (so far) extremely clean. I miss the advertising however, like in NYC. I want posters about STD's and community colleges. Gimme something to look at. 

Besides the homeless man's toes.

Wow. What a trip. The quintessential ladies who lunch spot. I thought for sure I'd see June Cleaver here. These women shop and lunch for sport. I'm sure they lettered it in back in the day. A lovely shaded and flowered patio full of wine swilling dames, swapping stories of infedility, recipes gone bad and where to go for botox. These are things I actually eavesdropped, er, um overheard. I had some delicous rolls before the famous strawberry salad. Salad? Hmmm. Pretty damn good. And in the if you can't beat 'em join 'em category. I had a split of Pop. A French champagne served with a straw. Yes people. A straw. Makes the bubbles fizzier and the buzz quicker. Highly recommended. A great place to take mom, granny or your favorite tranny.

I can only offer praises... yes, it can get busy, but it's worth the wait.  The spa pedicure has everything I could want... callous, sugar scrub, hot towel, and my personal fave... paraffin.

It's like that line from Karate Kid, "Get him a body bag!"... yes, I would love to fully immerse myself in that toasty elixir of softness... even m'lady parts.  It's like Snuggle for your epidermis... but alas, they'll only agree to wax your feet... which is good enough for now.

They accept AMEX, Visa & MC, but appreciate cash for gratuity.  I think they'd prefer cash for the whole shebang... I know I would.

They also have no qualms with putting a bright coat of hi-gloss on your little piggies... they will call your bluff... so know this before wandering down a bad path.

And when your done, strut those newly pedicured feet down the asphalt runway to Inta'Juice for a little wheatgrass action.  No one's gonna spoil your party, not today!

Never Again!

This was a place that we made a point of going to every time we were in Vegas, as we've always enjoyed their tapas and blood orange mojitos.  Then we ate there on 4/23/12 and were among the 200+ people impacted by salmonella poisoning due to the fact that these morons don't know how to store food, prep food and wash their hands (see the 5 page, 44 point violation report filed by the Southern Nevada Health District).

As to the other reviewers saying that it is closed for renovations, they are misinformed.  This place was not closed for "renovations".  It was closed for making over 200 people violently ill.  If they do reopen (and I seriously hope they don't), avoid this place at all costs.  The violations show a complete lack of control from management and this place does not deserve your business.  There are way too many great places to eat in Vegas that actually know how to properly store meat.

Thanks for the week of vomiting, dehydration and pissing out of my a** Firefly!

Unbelievably rude service. I came here on a Sunday with two friends and we were the first people in the restaurant. We waited at the front for a while and the servers were too busy chatting with each other to acknowledge us so we sat ourselves. Once our server realized we had sat ourselves she had the audacity to tell us to in a very condescending tone to "wait for the hostess in the future". Again, we were the only people there. Do you really think you can be that rude to people when they sit down and expect them to stay?

We got up and left, and I will not return. Switch has been officially scratched off my list of Sunday brunches for this ridiculous behavior and I will be sure to tell anyone who suggests we visit in the future.

This was the 4th service I tried. The other pet sitters I used didn't follow my instructions and some wouldn't even return my calls when I checked to see how my pets were doing. I can't say enough about Amanda's Pet Sitting! Amanda followed my instructions perfectly and was always in touch with me and returned my phone calls right away. I've used her services for years now and I'm always happy with her service. I recommend Amanda to everyone I know that has pets.

Beautiful show; loved the intimate settling.

Reminds me of O show but the stage is a round circular shape; lot smaller & more intimate feeling making you feel like you're closer to the stage. 

Vivid & passionate colors used throughout this show.

Loved the beautiful flowers that bloom at the end of the show.

Highly recommend this show; this is one of the better Cirque Soleil shows in Vegas. =)

FYI, you can buy discounted tickets on day of the show at Tix4Tonight but you have to go in person to buy them; they have plenty of booths & locations within casinos so don't worry.

If I could give 10 stars to Conrad, Robert and the team, they earned them! These guys were the greatest! I moved from Scottsdale to South Florida - a difficult move alone with two puppies. Conrad was creative and flexible, solved every challenge; he called me along the drive out, and every step of the way to my arrival. Robert was my "Guardian Angel" on the trip; He made it Fun! (well, as much fun as you can have moving). I so appreciate all the hard work, the integrity and genuine care that they took to get me to my new home. All the "stuff" made the trip in great sted!   Robert and Conrad are the best !!

Awesome hotel if you're here for the convention center; not-so-awesome if you're here for everything else! With that being said, it's off-strip and by the north end of the strip. The plus to this location is that it's a pretty short cab ride to the Wynn/Encore.

Most of the time, you can get a room here dirt-cheap through one of those last-minute booking apps/sites unless there's a convention going on. I've gotten a room for $31/nt. Dude, that's cheaper than a janky motel to handle yo business!

The rooms are decent if you're just looking for a place to crash out and shower. It can get pretty lonely here.

Late November...
The desert air, crisp and clean on a Sunday morning,
And I'm surrounded.
Surrounded by multiple games upon multiple screens,
Lions and Pats, Cards and Hawks.
Friends of old sitting across from one another, stories--once told,
Now again and again--flung casually about, bouncing
Here and there and here and there...
The fireplace aglow, and another on-tap round,
Orange-slice garnishings.
Cheers were in order, and the Verrado Grille,
Also relaxing in the mid-morning sun and welcoming any and all
Who have the luxury of lazy, weekend afternoons,
Hosted.

Here, you recline.

And at noontime sharp,
Our Happy Hour,
Suggestions, recommendations, libations...
Fives and sixes, listed mixes,
And fondues and sliders
And caesars and ritas.
Truffles and pretzels, wings, quesadillas...
Verrado Grille makes your stay easy.
The game's not over, however.
So stay awhile.
Enjoy
The moment and the
Smiles
Surrounding
You.

Ok, most people hate going to the laundromat to do their laundry.  I have no choice but actually like coming here.
This place is super-clean with a friendly staff (mostly Spanish-speaking but I'm fluent so THERE :P).  There are *no* pigeons running around this place.  Always a plus!
You use a card here, no quarters dug from under the couch cushions.  I like that.  
The place is spotless.  There's always someone cleaning up.  The machines are regularly cleaned out of forgotten socks and panties.
They even have a little store with a variety of different detergents!  
They are open late, which seems to be when I go there.  Many TVs throughout, tuned into different stations.  There's even a PacMan machine to play!

I'm not driving around town in the car I reserved because when I got off the plane (at 3 am), you didn't have it. 

And I'm like, "Fuck you."

I guess the money I paid wasn't enough...I'm like, "Fuck you."

Yeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari...
All I wanted was a Nissan Versa in white. 
Too much to ask, for you to honor your commitment...
The way you play your game ain't right.

Clearly, Advantage knows how to TAKE the reservation, they just don't know how to HOLD the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.

"Just Say No!" has been around for years to protect our children from drugs.  Well, if you are over 18 there is one drug you must try...Absinthe, the best show at Caesars Palace.  If you want to hear Celine...watch Titanic.  The best entertainment at Caesars is this "trip" of a lifetime, without a drug test. The venue is a 1800's wooden/stain glass tent from Belgium, set outside at Caesars Palace.  The interior is dark and mysterious with wooden chairs around a small stage and a bar.  The air is that of a freak show and you are waiting for the Elephant Man to come out. Go early and enjoy the whole venue, which includes a very eclectic outdoor lounge filled with artwork and sculptures that are a cross between a haunted house and Alice in Wonderland. The New York Times has called this show Cirque du Soleil meets Rocky Horror.  The acts are so intensely entertaining that you are either crying from laughing or praying on your knees that nobody gets hurt from their amazing feats of acrobatics and stunts.  This show is by no means for the timid.  The performers are so talented and death defying, you experience that sensation of driving by a car accident where you don't want to look but you just HAVE to.  Just say YES to Absinthe!

Shhhhhh! can you keep a secret?  

We stumbled upon a secret pizzeria in the new Cosmopolitan hotel.

It was 3 in the morning and we roll in jonesin for some food.
Nico was such a sweetheart, he told us stories, listened to ours, and gave us advice on life, love, and all things worldly.  He was like an elder teaching us life lessons while he kneaded dough and turned it into pizza for us!

It literally turned from this.....

                       \*/

Great pizza, nice crust, and awesome company.  Nico hooked us up and managed to teach us about life all in 30 minutes.  He made me feel like I was in Italy and if this was his pizzeria he'd have given us the pizza for free!  Nico made our trip a memorable one.

Even though this would pretty much be a one and done for anyone living in Las Vegas, I highly recommend checking out the Neon Museum.  Having the lights on definitely added awesome effect to the signs for the 7:30pm tour.  My wife and I both agreed this was much better to see at night.

Our tour guide, April, was chockful of great information.  She really enhanced what would have been a 10-15 minute walkthrough sans guide to an hour tour full of history and fun stories.  That alone made it well worth the locals admission of $22.  Some of my favorite signs included Sassy Sally's, the humungous Treasure Island skull, the H tile board of the Horseshoe and the creepy at night looking Jackpot Motel sign.

The atmosphere and the service made my evening with friends so much more pleasant that I will definitely be back. The food was good, the Mediterranean salad was amazing, that dressing was tasty and not overbearing, the orange chicken was well cooked but not as special as I hoped for, then again, I can't expect miracles from chicken. The desert (tres leches) was great, super sweet so not for everyone but tasty.

Fees, fees, and more fees.  They get you coming and going, and then are understaffed so you get to stand in line for at least thirty minutes.  You'd think with all these fees that they'd be able to have a couple guys frisking people, or hose the floor down more than once a month.  Apparently not!  I'd considered giving them two stars, but then I remembered the fee to PRINT OUT MY TICKET AT HOME, and realized this place is truly evil.  Not that these crazy fees are such a rare thing, but I don't have to give them extra stars if they're evil.  

I'm just waiting for the inevitable "fee to administer additional income related to fees" to pop up.

I've broken up with frozen yogurt.  Boba? Boh-bye.  Haagen Dazs can go fahrvergngen themselves.  This is it!  This is my go to dessert destination in Las Vegas.

There have been so many glowing reviews by a lot of reputable Yelpers that it seems ridiculous that I could add anything else into the mix.  Even though my review of their business when they were known as "Frostybites" expresses my sentiments clearly, I love the Ex-Straw-Binary that much to say it again.

It's probably not the most popular flavor but for some reason, it's the perfect sweet spot for me.  When you combine their shaved strawberry ice with strawberries and then strawberry condensed milk on top of it all, it's like the strongest, sweetest musical note.  

If the Ex-Straw-Binary were a guitar solo, it would be Adrian Vandenberg's solo from the Whitesnake classic "Is This Love".  The tone, the sustain, the subtle power of it all.  I eat it up.  It IS love!!

I do feel a little looney sometimes getting the same thing over and over (I've gotten the pumpkin twice with graham crackers which is a solid 2nd place) but I get over it and get it again.

After a three night stay at the Cosmopolitan and three nights checking out Bond, this small bar near the LV Strip Entrance did not live up to hype. It's a-ok, but was dead all three nights except for some people gambling on machines at the bar. 

This Bond was nothing like the cool suave style of a sexy British spy. 

It was more like Double O Disappointment. Hey-yo!

We must of went during an off period because there were no DJs or dancers any of the nights. It was just a nice, clean bar. Again, it's fine, but nothing exciting or really special if there aren't dancers or DJs.

They had a BABY JESUS pencil topper set!!! OMG, I think I died and went to heaven. 

Plus they had a photo booth and pirate cupcake wrappers, and oh yeah, they had candy. I found it to be a novelty store that happened to sell candy and other eccentric knick knacks. But whoa, what a bunch of poor reviews I see here. I found Smeeks to be a delight. The scene on a Saturday afternoon was kind of a mob scene -- about a dozen or so people kind of crowded the place.

I spent $5 on my Baby Jesus pencil toppers and found prices on other things to be just right -- it's an independent local business selling specialty goods, people.

So go ahead -- spend your money at another chain to save a buck, kwitcherbitchin and move to Buckeye. Thank you. The End.

If you like books, old LPs, and games... then Bookmans is your first and only stop.

I love book stores.  I particularly like used or old bookstores. I'm also not a be fan of dust or mildew and thankfully Bookman's does a great job keeping everything fresh and clean. 

Recently after roaming the store for hours, I picked up my assortment and decided to cash out.  Well, I was the lucky winner the Shopper of the Day and like that. my fifty dollar tab was wiped clean.  Made me want to go back and pickup the rejects. LOL

I'm not sure if this location is larger than the one in Mesa, but it appears so. But Mesa might have a greater selection of records and old LPs.

Come, look, browse; you'll be glad you did.

I used to live on Long Island, so I know a little bit about bagels. This was good, but it wasn't a classic Brooklyn bagel. Maybe it's the water here in the Charlotte area? It was still a good bagel, toasted with some scallion cream cheese.

The coffee was good too.

Nice that they have a free wifi. Comfortable seating area, maybe a nice place to chill with a laptop for a bit.

My only complaint is that when the gal asked me for the combo, it looked like it's supposed to come with a couple of mini-muffins. No biggie - I don't need that many more carbs!

Arrogant Butcher. Arrogant Bastard. Arrogant Butthole. I don't care what the name is, I had a really great time here. Finding it, however, was laughable. This whole Cityscape thing is a big FAIL to me so far. Why they didn't choose to build an open aired mall like Kierland Commons is so Bed Bath and Beyond me. The signage is horrible. The curb appeal is non existent. 

But when we finally turned the corner and saw the big A, the sidewalk was bustling with guests and the inside was energetic, fun and most appealing. 

I had great service. Thank you Winston! The pretzel fondue was fabulous! The scallops with bacon and beans was okay. Not exactly executed as I would have liked. And the crab stuffed chicken was actually quite bland. 

But I washed it all down with a beautiful, buttery bottle of Carneros Chardonnay and all in all a good time was had. 

Arrogant? Perhaps. But certainly Insecure Butcher wouldn't work. So it's a winner so far to me and I will most definitely return.

Chandler Fashion is a nice upscale Mall and one of the best in the greater Phoenix area,

We've been coming here for over five years, longer if you count before we moved to the Valley. It's your typical double decker setup, with the usual anchors like Macy's, Sears, Dillard's, Nordstrom and Barnes & Nobles built in a semicircle.

In many ways, we like Chandler Fashion over the one in Scottsdale with the same name. Scottsdale Fashion has been built-out, piece meal and can be crazy busy at times.  The developer of both is Westcor, a sub of giant real estate holding company Macerich. 
 
Here the movie theater setup makes more sense. It's outside and has a group of restaurants attached to it. So you can stop and eat, before or after your movie. Also, because it's located it's easier getting in and out without the necessity of walking through the Mall.  Nice!

Enjoy the shopping.

I always try to keep my fitness in gear when traveling on biz.

Vegas with all it's sinful temptations of food and drink can ruin it for me so I always try and hit up a casino gym while staying there. The Grand Spa at MGM was a decent little gym with some nice equipment. Very well kept, plenty of cardio, and a good line of machines, dumbells, and some cable equipment. Also on hand are complimentary bottles of water, fruit, and assorted Nature Valley granola bars. 

Hours: 6:00am - 7:00pm Monday - Thursday, 6:00am - 8:00pm Friday - Sunday

Overall, nice gym for a casino with plenty of equipment. $10 a day gym only fee is a deal.

I really hate to give out my annual award for "Best Response From a Business Owner" this early in the year, but I really do think I've found a winner. Here's most of the message I got in my Yelp inbox from Melody H. about my experience:

"Hi Catherine, I remember when you came in and your horrible attitude. I cannot believe you would be so stupid and make-up lies as you did here. I thought to myself when you came in and spoke with me that you were strange. I just had one thing to say after you left and I told the girls there is only so much lip stick you can put on a PIG!"

It's just pure awesomesauce covered with cherries on top! Congrats to Melody H.--you are truly one in a million (and I mean that in the worst way possible, heh).

Welcome to Chuck E Cheese from Hell!  

Not only would this attraction be suitable for family fun, but it'd also be great if you were looking to do a modern version of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas".  I witnessed a couple of tourists in midst of that and I gotta admit...I was jealous.  They bathed in the KISStory and rocked out harder than anyone else when the band's late 80's hit "Forever" blared out the speakers.  I doubt they ever made it to playing golf.

This is unquestionably the best mini-golf course in Las Vegas.  The black lights, awesome tunes, incredible memorabilia (Eric Carr's Porsche right up front!) and KISS animatronics really transported me somewhere else.  The enormous models of Paul Stanley's Ibanez Iceman, Ace Frehley's triple humbucker Gibson Les Paul and then Gene Simmons' tongue on the 18th hole were insane.

My only gripe was that holding a scorecard, pencil, putter, golf ball and beer from hole to hole became as annoying as listening to a Peter Criss interview.  At least the beers were cheap.  It was $2 for the first round, $3 for the second etc.  That definitely eased my pain of being the worst mini-golfer in the world.    

Here's a $3 off per person coupon:
http://vegas4locals.com/couponkissminigolf.html
That makes it $8.95 for out of towners and $6.95 for locals.  SONIC BOOOOOM!!!

Would I spend $300 per night on a room? Hell to the no. Will I sign up for their text message promo list and get a code to get a room at about $90 per night. Fuck yeah.

I got just such a deal for a 700 sq ft HRH suite with two queen beds over Christmas weekend. And I've gotta say these are pretty nice digs. Two big TV's a ginormous swanky bathroom (complete with kickass deep soaking tub), comfy beds, roomy couches, and a sweet bar area... this is how you do Vegas right, kids.

Sure, it's kind of a bitch to take a cab whenever you want to go to the strip, but with Hard Rock being directly across from Hofbrauhaus and Double Down... well, color me happy.

I'd like to personally shake Mr Tofu's hand.  While I cannot medically prove it, I am 100% certain that their soondubu contains undefined healing properties.  Some how some way, I always feel better after a meal here.  

Got a cold?  Screw the Nyquil and get the spicy kimchi soondubu.

Bad day at work?  Beef soondubu=good f'n day

Broken leg?  Just splash a little pork soondubu broth on your leg and it'll probably heal instantly.  

Venereal disease?  Wait a couple of minutes before pouring it all over your crotch since it comes out piping hot.  Don't want to scare the other customers with your screaming.  Perhaps the seafood soondubu would be best for this.    

At $8 a bowl, even my wallet feels better!

Tickety Tacky in only the best way possible.  I actually really like this place.  The neon lights reminds me of my mothers make up in the 90's.

Nick the waiter was a sweetheart.  I am ridiculous in my requests sometimes, but he managed to cater to all of them.

The portions are huge!   My steak and spinach salad was delicious!  The steak was tender and medium rare just as I requested.  I asked for candied walnuts in it and Nick brought me a bowl of them!  That's what I call service.

Late night eats in Vegas!  I'll definitely be back!

YES! I finally got to experience this fabulous show. Being as the Beatles remain my all time favorite band I have been wanting to see this show forever. And i was not disappointed. We had seats in the front row but up on a ledge. I personally think this could have been the best seats in the house. The portray  of the Beatles era was spot on. The dancers were very talented. My favorite set had to be to the song Strawberry Fields Forever. The entire room went red and they had an array of various performers blowing all different types of bubbles. it was visually arousing. There was also an awesome guest interaction they put a huge white sheet over the crowd and pastel colors shown through. I highly recommend seeing this show. Especially if your a Beatles fan.

OK so the bf is a few years younger than I. Just a tad. OK. So, he's 17 years younger. Oh my god! I'm like, a gay male cougar. I'm a manther! Anyway. I digress. A bunch of his same aged buddies wanted to meet at Kobalt. Rickie and I arrived first and discovered a bright, well kept, no dartboards kinda bar. No smell of stale beer. No problem finding a parking spot. It was actually. Civilized. And it's a gay bar in Phoenix? Wow! After having a few rounds of drinks and perhaps forgetting that I was the elder of the group, one of them exclaims...."Yea. This place is pretty cool. Too bad there's so many guys over 40 here." 
Wow. I was one of those guys. But, hey! What? just because some of the hair on my head has made its way into my ear canal and lower back. And just because I  know Harvey Milk was a slain gay rights activist and not a type of dairy beverage. I can't have a place with a piano, a granite bar and a barstaff that truly knows how to make a Gibson. Thanks Kobalt. I'm blue no longer.

Again, upon Adam Richman's heels...  

As a continued fan of "Man vs Food" and after having bookmarked a few of Adam's noted, Phoenician eateries--Chompie's, Alice Cooper'stown, and Los Reyes de la Torta--I saddled up, traversed over 350 sun-scorched miles, and with extreme prejudice negotiated terms of surrender with a literal powerhouse of a Mexican sandwich--one piled high, layered thick, and respectfully ordained "Del Rey."

Muy delicioso!  Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, hot dogs, omelet, chorizo, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce: all hail the King!  Ok, it's true, I may be a bit biased--after all, who am I to contradict Adam?--but unwavering confidence and grandeur shoulder this reigning torta.  My job, put simply: tossing confetti.  How am I doing?  =]

The rundown:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KjOMCauQYI.  (By the way, I visited the West Indian School Rd. location, while Adam opted northward to Sunnyslope's haunt on North 7th St.)

What was even better was being treated like kings, ourselves, while we were there.  We really were.  The service was supreme!  My only regret was not taking a picture of the Elvis statue in the window!  Yes, the King himself.  But I'll get it next time.  Trust me.

Adam...lead on!

Three Birds left and pounds of Steel makes for good target practice! 

The Pittsburgh Steelers have one of the best records in football history. They have won 5 out of 42 Super Bowls. Only 3 teams have won 5 and that is the Steelers, the Cowboys and the SF 49's. Seeing the Steelers are the only one of those three in the playoffs, they could break all records this year, by winning 6 Super Bowls. IF they go to the Super Bowl again this year, it will be their 7TH appearance.

IF, is the biggest word in the English language. If my grandmother had 4 wheels, she would be a box car. 

I was not thrilled when Bill Cowher left the Steelers, but I must say Mike Tomlin has done a fine job and we were blessed, to have had two great coaches. 

I have been an avid collector of autographed sports memorabilia for many, many years. I have quite a lot of autographed Steelers merchandise, including a football jersey signed by the Steel Curtain. 

I can't help but admire that more and more each week and think of how Mean Joe Green and LC Greenwood will be watching the games, with nerves of steel and how Ernie Holmes and Mad Dog Dwight White will be smiling down upon Big Ben, Willie Parker, Hines Ward, Troy Polamalu, Harrison, Holmes and the rest of the team. 

This week the Steelers have home field advantage of a ridiculous time of 6:30 against the Ravens. The Ravens play hard and rough and my fingers are crossed that we beat them for a third time this year. 

Everyone is thinking of how great it would be to have a PA. Super Bowl. I went to Heinz Field for the 2004 Eagles/Steelers game. I drove from Philadelphia along with Eagles Fans galore. We won and it was an awesome ride home. 

GO STEELERS!! You rock my world! Give me one for the other hand!

Man, oh man. You've got game if you shop here. If I were a guy, I would buy my entire wardrobe from Stitched. A combination of classic and contemporary, suiting and street - this is how a man with swag dresses!

The store itself is the ultimate man cave. There's a billiard table in the back, flat screen tvs on ESPN and even a whisky lounge with Macallan scotch lockers to rent. There are also several cool choppers worked into the decor. There's an on-site tailor stitching up sharp suits too, personalized with your name if you'd like. Probably the only thing missing is a cigar bar and hot female cocktail servers.

Price points are really reasonable. A lot of the coats and blazers that I liked were around $250. You'll find ready to wear brands like George Esquivel, Jacks & Jokers, Rag & Bone, Cr8tive Recreation, Louis Stewart and Psycho Bunny.

And girls, the sharp looking men that work here make the visit worthwhile too.

This is the single most annoying thing about lost wages... then again you can collect the escort playing cards and trade them with your friends...

Has anyone ever found or hired the girl from the card and gotten her autograph? Are the girls on the cards really in Vegas and working as an escort? Hmmmm... enquiring minds want to know. Has a businessman in vegas called for an escort and have his daughter appear at his hotel room unbeknownst to either of them? 

Well all these questions and more will likely never ever be answered. Haha

Pro Tip: Really? Like I would know... I have never hired one of these performers. So sorry, No Pro Tip's for you on this one hahaha

But yeah, these illegal alien types working for likely next to nothing, and the girls are likely working for tips... but hey it's the world's oldest profession and this is in Sin City...

Regardless of that, the trash generated by these folks is ridiculous... Literally you see these cards blowing down the boulevard morning noon and midnight... At least they could put a trash can near them to dump that stuff into...

A hands down must see attraction. The first time I saw it in 2006 they played My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion. It was so beautiful I almost cried! The strip side offers the best views in my opinion. 

The fountains are set in a 9 acre manmade lake.  They incorporate a network of pipes with more than 1,200 nozzles that make it possible to stage fountain displays coordinated with more than 4,500 lights. It is estimated that the fountains cost $75 million to build. The fountains were created by WET, a design firm specializing in inventive fountains and architectural water features.

Here are the fountain show times: 

Monday - Friday 
3:00 PM. - 8:00 PM. 
show every 1/2 hour 
8:00 PM. - 12:00 AM. 
show every 15 minutes 

Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays

Loved my stay! 

My aunt and my uncle have a timeshare, and the Hiltons on the strip were booked, so we ended up here at the one by the Convention Center. It was only about 5 minute drive to the strip, it was quiet and very comfortable. 

We were on the 11th floor in adjoining rooms and it was super comfy! One room had a full kitchen, big frig, dishwasher, dining table, washer and dryer, couches and TV, a separate bedroom and restroom. 
The other room, which i was in, had a huge, very comfortable soft bed, a tv, couch, table, dresser, closet, kitchenette with small fridge and a bathroom. Bathroom had a tub and nice oversized showerhead for shower. 

The only things that i would note that was negative was the doors inside the rooms got stuck. The bathroom door would not close correctly and would made a horrid loud sound every time you tried to get out. The middle door adjoining the rooms got stuck too. 

Other than that,  if you are staying for more than a weekend, this place is really clean and comfortable!

A friend of mine likes to point out that Savers, as opposed to Goodwill, is a "for profit" business. No matter, I love them both. 

Like Goodwill, I come here most for the books. The knick-knacks, and all of the other "stuff" is fun to go through and seems to be of very high quality. When the Ulitmate Electronics closed a few years ago, I was surprised that Savers wanted the space. But in the end, I guess it was a matter of location, location, location as they say.

Savers also has a frequent buyer's card and discounts for seniors on Wednesdays. If you sign up, they will email you when they are having sales. Nice!

Last Saturday, I went to Char's Bar
Because it wasn't very far
Riding bitch on a scooter
In a mini skirt barely covering my cooter

This was my first time
Which should've been a crime
Cuz' this place was poppin'
My booty was droppin'
My head be boppin'
Where all the ez katz are flockin'
Drop, pop the collar lockin'
All shades of colors hoppin'
To the beats that be rockin'

$6.00 was the door fee
Stiff drinks? Yes please!
Shots of Patron I was takin'
In hopes of later dirty baby makin'
And even morning breakfast serving bacon?

Only complaint is the restroom
Very slimy, tiny, and grimy

She sang with soul and funk
Nothing dull or bunk
Damn, I'm gettin' drunk!
Singing some James Brown
The crowd was gettin' doowwwnnn
No one with a frown
Up in this Blue's town

I danced and got jiggy
Flirted like Miss Piggy
With all this fun
Under the sun
I was done

But I'll definitely be back
Ready to attack
This place was so cool
Not at all whack

Eyes were closing shut
Baby making, what? What?
Not tonight, don't wanna to fight
Can barely stand with all my might
Losing sight
Gooooooood night!

Dollar Blackjack...Wah?! I'm there
The dealers are ornery but I don't care.
Everyone says this place is run down but I don't think so.  It seems good to me, maybe a bit dated with their decor, but I'm here to gamble and get drunk.  Who cares what it looks like?
I always win so every time I'm in Vegas I come here for a bit to make me some money.
*rubs card on nipple*
I always end up paying for the gas because everyone else lost :(
*shakes fist at Vegas*

I got super drunk one time and peed in the corner...and then ran away.

Girls and guys gone wild! TAO Beach is crammed with gorgeous people... but it's way too close for comfort - for me at least. The pool is tiny, and by the end of the day, half the water has been splashed out of the pool and is completely murky. 

We didn't have to wait in line or pay a cover to get in on a Saturday afternoon, which was a plus, but the place was a madhouse. On the upside, because the place is so small, it's much easier to make friends with complete strangers who will let you hang out in their lounge area.

For the ultimate Vegas pool party experience, my vote is definitely for Wet Republic or Encore Beach Club.

Via  Brazil was a 3 star restaurant in my previous review 3 days ago.  That's nothing to be ashamed about.... it just means the restaurant was nothing great, but not terrible TO ME.  Yelp is a site for posting your opinions.  But some guy named Dustin J. had to send me a private message saying:

"We are very sorry that Our Happy Hour is too expensive for you. 
Please visit McDonalds, Taco Bell and other fast foods if this is too expensive for you"

It took me a minute to figure out what restaurant he was referring to, but when I found 20 photos for Via Brasil, I figured it out  Congratulations, guys, I will never return to your restaurant and will make sure nobody I ever talk to does either.  Worst marketing ever.

It was a spur of the moment thing and happy that it happened! I met up with Rand H, Norm R & Scott W to try the Reign of Thai buffet on a Sunday afternoon.

Every item in the buffet looked delish and fresh,  I tried a variety of things and enjoyed them all, egg rolls, chicken won tons, pad thai, beef massaman curry, chicken pangang curry just to name a few.   Massaman curry is my favorite curry, and normally I chose chicken but the beef was good too!

Service was friendly and learned from the server that it was her aunt and uncle who cooked all the dishes.

Sundays buffet was 10.99 and it is very much worth the price! If I am ever in the area again you bet I will be back!

I use to come down to Coolidge quite a bit and one of the cool things I use to do was come over here and visit the ruins.  A great piece of Arizona history!  Do you remember the Five C's?  Well, this is cotton country.

The Park Rangers will tell you they don't really know how old the ruins are, but most guess at around 600 years plus.  But thanks to a forward thinking US Government, the ruins are now protected by a 70 foot high shelter.  Trust me, it comes in handy in July and August, the two months I seem to visit here most.  LOL.  I would also recommend a visit to the bookstore.  It stocks a variety of First Nation history, as well as info on the area.

http://www.nps.gov/cagr/index.htm

While you are in Coolidge, I would recommend the Gallopin' Goose for drinks or bar food, and Tag's for dinner.  Both are great!

You would have no idea which show I was referring to if I said I saw it in Las Vegas and it starred a group of fairly attractive women doing dance routines to prerecorded music while topless.  That not only describes "Sydney After Dark", but also current strip shows like "Fantasy", "X Burlesque" and "Crazy Girls".  

Australian accents aside, there is nothing new being offered here.  As I watched the prerequisite cowgirl scene, I wondered how/why THIS had become the formula for Vegas topless shows?  Maybe having a girl that sings makes it classier than a strip club?  There has to be a more creative way to present half naked girls!  Oh!  They have a girl in a leotard doing an aerial scarves act!  That was so cool and original like 10 years ago but a snoozefest today.  A topless comedian would have been much better.    

Keeping with the Aussie theme, they dance to mostly native artists from the "lahnn daahn undah" like AC/DC, Tina Arena, Sia and INXS.  I can only guess their sultry version of "Locomotion" was inspired by Kylie Minogue.  They even did an aboriginal routine which left me feeling cultured and educated.  That's a lie. 

The few people in attendance (15% capacity at best) were all moved up to the best seats so buy the cheapest ones if you're going to pay.  I would recommend "Fantasy" at Luxor over this.  The girls are hotter!

Can't wait to come back to Vintage 95 for a date night!

Very romantic atmosphere, lots of comfy furniture, and live music on weekends.

Sarah R. and I tried a glass of the Coto de Hayas from Spain. Believe it was the Tempranillo Cabernet? Memory a little hazy, this was our last stop after a night of drinks. 

Would totally order the bottle, though. 

Their wine selection is pretty extensive, lots of $5/glass options, and I know within a certain timeframe, you get a charcuterie board if you purchase a bottle. 

Full bar for all those that aren't wine lovers. 

Throw this one in your back pocket for date night, guys!

Five bucks.  A burger, fries and can of pop.  How can you go wrong?
I had the Guac burger.  It's the reason I took a star away.  The burger itself was great, but the guac?  Notsomuch.  They do have a good array of different toppings to choose from.  
The fries were shoestring-cut and had a spiced salt sprinkled on them.  It was a good-sized serving.  
I love a can of pop!  They have Shasta, which is two thumbs up for me.  It doesn't have NutraSweet in the diet, but Splenda.  Hooray!
Getting out of this place is a bitch so here's my secret: Go out the back way, through the car wash to get to 7th Street.  Traffic on Indian School, right at the 7th Street light, sucks moose balls.

Remember the movie Brokedown Palace with Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale? And all of the Thai people were so mean to them. 

Oh. It has nothing to do with this review. I was just asking if you remembered that movie. Anyway, you won't find mean Thai people here. It's definitely a team  effort here and everyone was very helpful and most friendly. 

Seating is rather awkward as their isn't any signage indicating what to do, wait or sit. Or order inside. But I was quickly invited to sit wherever. Before I knew it a cold, crisp, simple salad and a menu was place in front of me. Yay! Free salad. The dressing was SO good. I bet Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes didn't get free salad. Course they were too busy being pistol whipped by the prison guards. 

Anyhoo...I ordered the pad thai and it was fantastic. Though I would have loved more tofu. It came with the cutest little spring and a wedge of cold watermelon. YUM! Love watermelon as it so refreshing. 

All this for around eight bucks. I bet you Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes...oh...never mind. Just get your butt to Thai Basil. Where you will be greeted warmly, served efficiently and probably, won't get pistol whipped by a lesbian Thai prison guard.

I'm now combing every William Sonoma to find these puppies. Our mango fresco juice beverage thingie was so refreshing I wanted to jump right in! Rickie said the roasted chicken was succulent. Ok. So he didn't say succulent. I think yummy was the word. The decor is modern and comfortable. I love how they really opened up the room. It is light, airy and has great views.

Its raining Sugar up in He A!

Seriously this place is a sugar addicts dream shop.  Everything here is sweet and sugary.  Came here to redeem one of the My Vegas coupons.  I felt high on sugar the whole time I was in there and I didn't even have any candy.  I picked up some chocolate rocks, malt balls, chocolate covered pretzel and green cotton candy! 

Since I don't have a sweet tooth these were all brought into the office to be shared. 

Eyes ~ So many candies and sweetst!
Nose ~ Smells sweet!.

For my 725th review, I wanted to share a dope alternative to a club in Vegas.  We stopped by here for a drink before having dinner at the Cosmo.  Chandelier is tri-level, w/ the 2nd level being the best in my opinion.

Top shelf drinks were only $10, vs most places that charge $15.  The place is very swanky, w/ a bar on each level, and lounge seats on the side.  In addition, the bartenders and clientele are chill.  We didn't feel any arrogance, and no one cut in line vs Marquee.  Lastly, the vibe is low key vs a lot of clubs in town.

Chandelier is highly recommended for a drink before or after dinner, or if you prefer something more chill vs a club.  A great place to hang out w/ friends or impress a date.

Butter. Sugar. Eggs. Flour. (BSEF) That's all you need to bake your basic cupcake.

But what if you're flying from SFO to LAS to visit your peeps, and you not only don't have any B,S,E or F, you have no time? You call The Cupcakery for a quickie delivery of some of the finest cupcakes east of the Cali border!

While cupcake delivery is a big, pricey splurge (almost $70 for a dozen... half of which is delivery charge), it' well-worth seeing the look of "Ohhh, man that's one good yummy piece of cake" on everyones face as they take a bite of these moist-caked & creamy-topped gems. I was impressed!

Plus, cupcakes are a delightful alternative to flowers, don't you think?

For the record, the Red Velvet was really good, and while it's usually my favorite, I really loved the Vanilla, too!  

It's nice to know the greater Vegas area has a place like the Cupcakery handy... especially since it's so close to my peeps!

You don't know how much I love you,
You don't know how much I care.

This review is way old but since I'm sick and have nothing better to do than stare at my feet and feel like crap I thought I'd catch up on old reviews before they are erased from memory.

Happy Hour is where its at son!
1/2 off Steaks (and a gnocchi I just couldn't pass up)

The vibe is straight up sexy, (I never use that word because I feel awkward saying it out loud) but its just dark, sultry and sleek and straight out of an old-school movie.  

The specialty cocktails are divine, the bartenders take their time and they know wassup.  Quality drinks cost money, but oh what a way to burn.

Hands Down The Most Enjoyable Cirque Experience EVER!!!

If you're a fan of MJ and all his amazing work, this show is a Must See!

From the very start of the show to the very end, the performers had the audience engaged with hands clapping and toes tappin' 
Honestly, even if you have two left feet, you will feel compelled to get up and dance! 
The vibe of the entire show is lighthearted yet thoughtful to MJ's extensive body of work. It embodied the best of MJ and his dedication to music, children and equality.  

I truly enjoyed this show on so many levels and I'm not even a huge MJ fan.

Now, be warned, if you're a Cirque Du Soleil purist looking for the obligatory acrobats this show may not be for you. However, if you love a high energy, creative and unique experience, "One" will not disappoint! 

I guarantee you will leave the show feeling gooooood!

Happy Times!

Popped in to give this place a try as I've heard nothing but good things about their chicken. And the raves are correct. This is really good chicken. A meaty chicken breast that was moist with a very crispy batter that wasn't so thick that it overwhelmed the chicken.

I got a two piece dinner, which came with a dinner roll, a small tub of cole slaw, some tater tots, some hushpuppies and the previously mentioned chicken - one wing and one breast. The tots were excellent. Not too greasy at all, but I was glad to have the one packet of ketchup for dipping.

This was a serious "fried" plate. If they could fry the cold slaw and the dinner roll, I'll bet they would have done so.

Note: This place is TAKE OUT ONLY. There is no dining area that I could see.

OK. Just so you know. When they arrive at your door with your ice, they've already heard "OH!. THE ICEMAN COMETH"! Or "OH, IT'S SO nICEEEEE TO SEE YOU"! Or "ICE ICE BABY ICE ICE BABY"! Hey, I'm just looking out for ya. I have to say, AZ Iceman has saved my icey ass on more than one occassion. Usually the ice machine next to my office is so loud producing cubes I fear a major hail storm has moved in and nobody has alerted me. Lately. Not so much. She's a tempermental one, that ice machine. So a call to AZ Iceman yields an always polite employee who quickly dispatches the Iceman. Soon my cocktails, teas and sodas are fizzy, happy and cold once again. Like Liza Minelli on her wedding night. I don't know what kinda deal you would get, but I shelled out around $70 for 400 pounds of ice. Yes. You heard me. Four hundred pounds. It's like having Carney Wilson delivered, only in the form of ice cubes. I c u soon.

Absolutely my worst Vegas experience yet and TI Vegas risk management and hotel management are to blame! I would give negative stars if I could! 

This place is NOT SAFE!!! I came back to my room with my wife & her two friends after attending a wedding that evening to a scroungey smoking male leaving OUR ROOM with a black sack full of OUR BELONGINGS! Apparently security had been called on this "suspect fellow" 20 min prior and they were IN THE HALL as the man proceeded to ATTACK me and grab me by the throat and then run into the Service Elevator Room and escape through the SERVICE ELEVATORS.... ALL IN FRONT OF SECURITY, WHO WALKED SLUGGISHLY TO US! They didn't even jog!!! And their response to us being attacked and robbed in front of them was to offer to write a report "if we wanted to"!!! OF COURSE WE WANTED TO. And then they continued to try to talk us out of calling the Police, which we ignored and called ourself to file a report with the police. 

Absolutely sketchy and unnacceptable! And on top of it all, management refused to compensate our rooms for the nights stay!! Never coming back, I like my safety more!

I like Duck, roasted and with some plum sauce on the side. I'm not so excited about Duck & Decanter. It's just okay for me, 2 1/2 stars if I had that option since I'm only interested in lunch and not their wine or any of the fancy foodstuffs that they carry. The best attribute about this place is the outdoor seating while being surrounded by some large trees.

For starters, there's a funky smell going on when you first walk into the place. I think the sandwiches are weak. You can look at a picture of my Reuben Sandwich with the toasted burnt bread and judge for yourself. To me, it looks like a number eight hitter's batting average, weak. I've had a decent salad in the past as well. 

This place has definitely not made the cut on to my regular lunch rotation.

Is a trip to Vegas ever complete without a visit to a Cirque du Soleil show?  I think not.

Whats a trip to Vegas without seeing some naked girls swimming and writhing in a giant human-sized fish bowl filled with water?

                          .'                     '.
                         /~~~^~~~^~^~~~\   
                        |           .-"" L_    o |      Fishies!

                          .\__________/.'
                                '---------'

I saw the fishbowl and I knew right away I was in.  
They hypnotize you 
They seduce you, every act more titillating than the next
They make you sell your soul to the man next to you
You forget everything
You wake up and the next moment you're sitting in a vat of writhing bodies
Will you obey?

I'm sore.  I guess that means I did.

PS- If you're looking for a conservative show, this probably isn't for you and your family.  But the crude humor, the scantily clad muscled men (wrap him up i'll take him to go) and barely there women.  This was definitely my kinda show.  Crazy moves, random stunts, perverted jokes...This was definitely perfect for me.

Don't get seats in the front rows if you don't want to be called on.  :)

Dare I say that I like Amore's deep dish pizza even better than the pizza I had in Chicago? No need to hop on a plane to go all the way to Gino's when we have Amore Taste of Chicago here in Vegas. My favorite thing about it... It's hard to narrow it down to only one so here's a few. Their sauce is so flavorful and made from real crushed tomatoes. The ingredients are extremely fresh. Their thick crunchy cornmeal crust is never oily. Every time I have ordered from here, my pizza has been perfectly cooked. 

I love this pizza! I'm just mad that I tried it because now I'm hooked and I'm going to get fat. When I become too out of shape and have to give up modeling because of this guys, I blame Amore! It's all their fault! Don't say I didn't warn you. ;)

The Venetian is almost 5 ***** Star in my book but ...................The only thing wrong .... NO ICE or vending machines on the 11th  floor! WTF -1* Star
I spent a several days here on a recent business trip. Company dime, hell yea!
4 days no police, no ATF officers, no DEA, no FBI, not even a single meter maid, this place is boring. I'm going back downtown where shit happens and it don''t cost $10 bucks for a pack of smokes and nobody looks at ya funny for ordering a bottle  of Bud or for wearing a trucker hat and having a rebel flag tattoed on your neck. I miss Fremont street.

After seeing the touring production of Jersey Boys once or twice (or a lot of times), it was a must-do on a recent trip to Vegas.  

Of course the show revolves around the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.  You get the full biography of how the band came together, and the ups and downs that went along with the group through the years.  The story is told both through narrative and song, making for an entertaining and interactive experience.

Although Frankie is the star, the real driver of the story is Tommy DeVito, played brilliantly by Deven May.  You'll have to see the show for yourself to see why he's truly the lead character.  No spoilers here.

The show is currently being held at Paris, and the theater and lobby area are both spacious and comfortable.  So even if you don't think you're a Frankie Valli fan (didn't think I was the first time I went), it's definitely worth seeing.

The lunch bunch convened on this vegan hotspot to see and be seen... and to try out the bowls.  Imagine my surprise when Linh bucked the system and ordered a vegan bbbq burger with mock bacon.

Had I known that seven minutes later, I would staring longingly at his entree, with his highfalutin thyme fries being the object of my desire, I would have surely placed my order for "ditto" instead of the "diablo red bowl".  Pretty sure J-WoW and her "coconut curry bowl" shared in that sentiment.

The fries are wonderful.  Very thin and crispy, they were reminiscent of succulent pomme frites one might find in a culinary school's student restaurant.  Les frites taient affirmation de la vie!  Oui oui, hon hon!

Knowing Linh won the entree lottery, I put a little more thought into the tSoynami frozen dessert, but that didnt keep Joycie's PB&J treat from walking away with the win, and Linh's Almond Joy non-dairy coming in a close second.  As she took her victory lap, I mused "sometimes you feel like a culinary looser, sometimes you dont".

I'm prepared to dominate on my next foray, because I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!

Lost in translation?

What it should be:  A working businessman's meal.  100g-150g of high quality, heritage pork, coated in fresh bread crumbs and fried golden brown.  The small portion is accompanied by AYCE rice and cabbage.  Do it yourself sesame based sauces for the tonkatsu and to dress the cabbage.

What they offer:  A simple menu.  Choice of either the softer, less fatty tenderloin of the slightly more firm loin from an everyday pig.  Served traditionally or as a donburi or with curry.  Rice, miso soup, and cabbage completes the meal (not AYCE).  Make your own sauce, grinding your sesame seeds and mixing in the house sauce which has a good dark soy background and hints of plum perfume.  

What I got:  Tried both the tenderloin and loin.  An oily, excessively thick eggy crust of not freshly made breadcrumbs (taste like store bought panko) surrounding an over cooked piece of pork.  Hawaii yeeps, think L&L quality.

Ultimately it's better than your average plate lunch place and not a bad deal for the novelty and price.  Tonkatsu snobs, look elsewhere.

Let me give you this little tip:

Do not attend a Vegas Strip Club with your brothers and/or male family members.  Under any circumstances.  No ifs, ands or butts.  Just don't.  Seriously.

It's awkward.  And upsetting.  And awkward.  

Little did I know that while my cousin Lauren and I watched our respective brothers get lapfucked by a pretty pair named Pilot and Perfect, that our benefactor had already paid for us to get our own laps snizzed on by Mercedes, a tight little tan blonde.

She sauntered over, asked the boys of the group that weren't busy getting jacked in a backroom somewhere to buy her a redbull (redbull is stripper cryptonite) and then sorta draped over us...

And that's when we both got felt up. 

Mercedes:  You guys both have really big boobs!

Rachel and Lauren: ...

*Stripper grabs our boobs*

Mercedes:  Are they real?

Rachel and Lauren:  *nod simultaneously* 

: |

Mercedes:  Mine are fake.

Rachel and Lauren:  *shock and awe* You don't say?

*Rachel and Lauren get the hell out of Spearmint Rhino*

Getting felt up without dinner or even a drink purchased for me beforehand felt wrong, but watching my brother enjoy a lap dance a little too much was enough to hurtle my nice seafood dinner out of the depths of innerspace onto the floor.

I'll give it up for the strippers super soft skin, though.  It's nice.  And they smell good too.  Lauren and I are thinking about creating a perfume called "Stripper".  It will be a blend of cucumber melon and coconut nectar with glitter.  Lots of glitter.

Oh, and they have pretty nice fake boobs. 

If you like that sort of thing.

One of our routines after a movie, is to come here for a "le petit dessert".

It also works before the movie as well.  LOL.  It all depends if we're doing Reverse HH next door at Pita Jungle.

There are a few G Spots in Scottsdale.  This one serves just gelato, or frozen milk as I like to think of it.  The one in Old Town has some great pizza.  

Several Yelp'er it seems, have used up their allotment of the word "Amazing' to describe the G Spot.  So I'll add delicious to the lexicon.  We had the Dark Chocolate and Salty Caramel last weekend, after seeing Zero Dark Thirty.

Go!  Enjoy!

Well of course you're named after a Saint. After all, you are simply heavenly! I LOVED my visit to St. Francis. Just like I loved the first year of Charlie's Angels when Farrah was on. Just like I loved Chachi and not Joanie. Just like I love smooth and not chunky. I was honored to have a tour of St. Francis by Mr. Aaron Chamberlain himself. He pointed out the architectural details and history of his career. Right down to family serving spoons used in his grandparents restaurant embedded in to the brick near the front door. The sleek, glass garage door which opens up to Camelback. If you're sitting outside you have a panoramic view of the interior and if you're inside you get a bird's eye view of the street scape. 

The second story (which is in limbo and awaiting a mural and a more defined purpose) is structurally held in place by a "V" shaped collection of steel rods...unfreakinreal! The birch floors on the stairs, the gravel on the patio, the maple beams, the seemless glass front table...I'm having an interior design orgasm! 

Oh. The food? Yep! Yummers! Thin crust pizzas with a airy, pillow crust...tried an arrugula za and had one with figs! The signature salad with a homemade buttermilk dressing (DON'T THINK RANCH!)...it's so much more and the goat cheese brulee made my mouth, my tummy and my soul very happy! You can feel the love from the kitchen as well as an attentive, enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff.

You're like my foodie angel, arriving in CenPho to save fme rom Applebee's and Sweet Tomatoes! I say Halo St. Francis. Halo and welcome to the hood!

I got waxed!

And it was fantastic!

I've been having an inclination to head out to LA to visit Grauman's Chinese Theater & Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum for awhile now.  While in Vegas, we had time to kill so we decided to check out Madame Tussaud's Las Vegas.  I used Tix4Tonight to purchase ticket vouchers for $18/piece, saving myself cash money, which is hard to do when you're in Vegas.  Here's the lowdown-

I had such a good time!  The resemblance of the wax figures to their real-life counterparts vary from spot-on to roughly vague.  Here, posing & touching are encouraged.  Check out my Yelp page for some of the pics I took.  Some I didn't post were a bit on the raunchy side (Fergie & Jenna Jameson, I apologize for my actions that day).  I'm not interested in Nascar/Indy Car racing, so that wing didn't appeal to me & I didn't check out the Scream Haunted House wing.  There was a plethora of wax figures, some w/ props that patrons can use when posing for the camera.  Celebs vary from Tony Bennett & Dean Martin to Katy Perry & 2pac.  Everyone of all ages should get a kick out of the celebs featured here.  There weren't too many people when I was there, so it felt like I had free run of the place, which I gleefully took advantage of.  

To reiterate, I had a blast visiting Madame Tussaud's Las Vegas.  I look forward to visiting the LA location to see whom they have exhibited there.  I remember the old Hollywood Wax Museum that used to be open in Buena Park, and MT blows that out of the water.  I recommend everyone come by and check out Madame Tussaud's for themselves.  You won't regret it!

Good times!

If you're going to watch one Cirque show in Vegas, make it this one!

Trust, it's one of the best Cirque shows i've ever seen on the strip!

From the breathtaking panoramic scenes, amazing set changes, and jaw dropping acrobatic performances, this show is a MUST for any Vegas goer.

The water element was what took this show over the top for me.  Much like Le Reve (not a Cirque Du Soleil affiliated show) it was incredible seeing how the set dynamically changed from dry to wet and even wetter!

Just do yourself a favor and do not, i repeat Do NOT purchase tickets for the front rows. You'll eventually end up breaking your neck trying to see all the aerial performances! For me, the sweet spot for any Cirque Du Soleil show is middle and center. You're able to see everything comfortably from this vantage point and that IMO is priceless!

With the combination of the inspiring live soundtrack, exotic sets and spectacular performances, i can guarantee you will have an unforgettable experience that you will treasure for years to come!

Happy Times!

I had my first taste of Firehouse Subs today and decided to go with the Beef & Cheddar eight inch sandwich with a large Diet Dr. Pepper from their fabulous soda machine. That machine kind of reminds me of Rodney Dangerfield's character in the Caddyshack where he had that golf bag that played music, so versatile just like the soda machine delivering many different types of sodas. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3A9rLoz_0o

The Beef and Cheddar sandwich comes with bbq sauce and mayo. I got it without the mayo and it tasted fabulous. The only problem was that I felt a little hungry after eating it. So there's the rub, an excellent tasting meal with just a little bit of meat. Five stars for taste but one star for not putting out my 5 alarm hunger pangs.

The chef bangs the bell and then everyone yells PAELLA!!!!!!

And with that, I knew the "Arroz Con Costillas De Cerdo Ibrico De Bellota" (made with the ribs of the famous, black-footed Ibrico de bellota pigs of Spain) was ready and would be coming my way any minute.  The paella was rich, flavorful and I gnawed on every rib until nothing was left.  

I semi contemplated another order but then the manicotti/lasagnaesque/alfredoey pork and foie gras canelones with bechamel sauce shut me the heck up :)  My wife wasn't a fan of because it was too cheesy and creamy but I am down for anything foie gras related.  

The seared fresh squid with squid ink sauce, artichokes and pearl onions was delectable.  Nice presentation!  It's rare for a place to serve the whole squid with innards and all.  I initially thought it was stuffed and couldn't put my finger on what was in it until our friendly server informed us.  I'd totally have squid ink as a hot beverage by the way.   

Bottom line is I need to come back here with a bigger group to sample more stuff like a heckuvalot more black foot pig.  If they ever make Pulp Fiction 2, Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace might have a discussion over the $20 gin and tonics.  Oh wait, he was killed.  Nevermind.  I am ready to go to "e" asap!

I was referred to ProtoGym by a good friend and have been extremely satisfied. The gym is owned by the trainer and it is pretty much a one man operation. You are given a scanner key and are able to access the gym 24/7/365. Being that the gym is relatively new (6 months or so) the member base is not huge yet, therefore most of the times I have gone I have had the entire gym to myself. It felt pretty exclusive except the prices are far from it. The gym offers all of the equipment you would need for successful circuit training and cardio. 

The really neat function is the protogym software in conjunction with the gym. When you go in, you go up the the kiosk, scan your key and it brings up your personalized work out. You click for your work out to be generated,  print it out and don't have to worry about what you should be working on that day. The exercises for the day also have instructional 30 sec videos that show you exactly how/what you should be doing. The equipment is well kept and well stocked (medicine balls, mats, boxing bags,  weights, stability balls, balance trainer, cones, high cable stations, etc etc). The website lists in full everything offered at the gym. Mike, the trainer/owner is extremely friendly, knowledgeable and will kick your butt in his boot camp classes. I kind of want to be selfish and not let the word out about this awesome and innovative gym, but at the same time I want him to succeed and stick around.

He offers month to month, no contract memberships, as well as membership options that includes boot camp classes. He doesn't do any third party billing, so when you ask to cancel your membership he will do it without any hassle or headache (I am looking at you 24 hr fitness...).

This Crate & Barrel is one of their two level versions, with a large display of furniture upstairs. It also is a nice compliment to the Pottery Barn across in Scottsdale Quarter. 

Since I work nearby, we're always stopping here to browse after a Starbucks run. The staff is incredibly nice and very helpful. They will go out of their way to order, or call another store to find any out of stock item for you.

Then of course is their world class wrapping.  I know this might seem trivial compared with the high end retailers found in Kierland, but it is especially true for Crate & Barrel. Nothing has ever broken in a bag they pack, no matter how fragile.  

A very nice shopping experience. Enjoy!

I was very excited to be chosen for this event, and not just because I got a sneak preview of J-WoW's sweater.  It was also to be the first time the lunch bunch would meet our cyber friend, Kazi, in person.

The venue was fantastic, located between 2 parking garages, next to an outdoor ice rink.  Upon arriving at the registration table, I spied the Santa photo op, so I grabbed Kazi for her first ever Yelp Elite photo (show some love and friend our newest Elite)

While at the bar, I indulged in a cherry vanilla porter, and I liked it.  The trio of ample hummus bowls were a delight, and I'm not ashamed to admit returning for seconds.

The hot chocolate was the finest I've ever tasted, especially after adding peppermint syrup and a heaping mound of whipped cream. 

While the food and beverage was delightful, the conversation was the high point, and I was lucky enough to spend a few minutes with the beautiful and engaging Kazi.  I loved seeing my friends... and meeting new Yelpers face to face is the icing on the cookie! (which there were a lot of)

I witnessed my first ever ugly Christmas poncho when J-WoW's +1, Linh, made his grand entrance.  Santa Sat on my lap, and my cheek was kissed by a pretty little lady who disappeared into the crowd. 

All in all, a pretty good night

Really gays? What has happened to us? We've become so serious. So mainstream. So. Oh dear. How do I say this...so, so heterosexual! GASP! 

Strollers. Parents. Pets. Lacoste shirts. Topsiders. Soccer moms. Soccer dads. And in my best Sarah Palin voice, "Joe 6 packs". Just normal folks don't ya know. You betcha. 

Where are the inappropriately dressed men in Speedos, glitter and nipple tassels? Dykes on bikes? Minors tripping on E? What has happened to our luster people? Have we become....um, boring? 

Well, I"m not sure. But the Rainbows Festival is darn fun. A small town feel, in a lovely urban setting, filled with the usual food vendors, t-shirts booths and local organizations hawking their wares and services. But overall, the genuine feeling of fun, love and celebration permeated this event. 

Lots of smiles, hugs and waves. And yes, lots of families of all types. And, really, that is what it's all about right. We noshed on turkey legs, tacos and swilled Bud and fruity vodka drinks. Ten bucks to park, but free to get in. How cute and small town is that? Well, not the parking maybe. But who doesn't love a free party? 

Rickie and I had a blast and at the end of our Rainbow, we found a bag full of condoms, lube and free minutes for a gay sex site. Ahhh, my people! Girls and gays just wanna have fun! See ya next year. And don't forget the nipple clamps!

We were in Vegas this past weekend and decided to check out Sushi Samba.  We did the tasting "omakase" menu and it was a hit with everyone on the table.  We got a nice sampling of everything there, it was all superb.  My favorite were the yellowtail tacos, yumm!  Most of all, we had a really great waitress, unfortunately i can't remember her name but she was very well informed and on top of it and she's the reason i'm giving this place 5 stars.

Comme Ca translates as not poorly or not bad ... and that's exactly what Comme Ca restaurant at The Cosmopolitan is ... not too bad.

The restaurant was empty and bar quiet when we popped in for some Happy Hour drinks and appetizers. Service was quick cause, seriously, there wasn't many other patrons.

Select cocktails are $7.50 during Happy Hour. I tried two. The Penicillin Cocktail with Scotch, Ginger, Lemon Juice, Honey, and an Islet Float was sweet and smooth. It could of used another 1/2 ounce of whiskey, but was fine. The lone vodka HH option is a cocktail called Fair Trade with Lemon and Simple Syrup. It was fair.

For nibbles, Olivia Z. and me split an order of the Grilled Beef Tongue ($6). The side of Lemon Aioli and sprinkles of Sea Salt really meshed well with the tender slices of tongue. We both liked it a lot even though the slices were a tad too thick. Oysters on the Half Shell are $2 each during Happy Hour. We got six with two different kinds. I forget the names, but one Pacific Ocean and the other was Atlantic. The Pacific were smaller, but better.

When it comes to Comme Ca for Happy Hour, it is kind of comme si comme ca.

Love the Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio. This location is much smaller than the one at Aria, but has a constant line for a reason: the pastries, desserts, crepes, coffees, and chocolates are divine.

Hordes of people crowd around to take pictures of the World's Largest Chocolate Fountain (according to the strange folks at Guiness), but I was more mesmerized by the fresh crepes, croissants, and cupcakes. We enjoyed a late breakfast 2 days in a row featuring pastries from Jean Philippe and wish we had stayed at the Bellagio longer just to have more.

 * Palmier - Flaky, crisp cookie covered with caramelized sugar 5/5
 * Croissant - Light and airy with a butter flavor to melt in your mouth 4/5
 * Almond Croissant - Filling Crme D'amandes; sprinkled with sugar & almonds 5/5
 * Chocolate Croissant - Jean Philippe chocolate + croissant = yum 3.5/5
 * Blueberry Brioche - Surprisingly addictive slice of bread with blueberries 3/5
 * Blueberry Danish - Light shell and heavy fruit jam heaven 4/5
 * Latte - Pick me up of espresso & steamed milk to start the day 4/5
 * White Cafe Mocha - Sweet mocha (espresso & chocolate) with White Chocolate 5/5

There are two locations and both on Yelp list Aria as the address when in fact the one with the chocolate fountain is in the Bellagio.

Jean Philippe Patisserie at the Bellagio was perfect.

Went here about 1pm on Sunday not very crowded and seated immediately. Menus and drinks followed. Service remained good throughout our visit. That's where the good stopped. The food?....well, let me just say this; "Don't waste your money!" Quality and quantity suffers greatly here. Nothing remotely Japanese at Kabuki only the name! Still hungry when we left and $35 lighter. No drink order either. The cooks here need to go to Japan to see how Japanese food is really crafted! I dislike having that feeling I just got ripped off. Dam!!!

Probably the best deal you can get in Vegas.  For the price of one hand of blackjack you can get a nice hot sandwich and a full belly.  

I came back twice just because I liked it so much.

I dug the Veggie (lent) and it was pretty awesome!  I also had the full Montague and it was delish as well.  The meat is perfection, nice and rare and juicy, I just wish I could have a huge pile of the meat!

The Caprese was okay, I kinda felt like it was an afterthought.  And their was only one piece of basil for the entire sandwich....I'd skip that one next time.

Someone should open up a franchise in LA because it would make a killing.

Pancakes were not steaming hot. They give one small hard as a rock ball of butter that punctures the skin of the pancake. Hash browns were not served with the pancakes. The wife's French Toast was obviously frozen and not served hot.

A little advice for Ihop management. Have an Ihop management type that likes pancakes order pancakes with one hard minuscule piece of butter on barely lukewarm pancakes and see if he/she enjoys that meal. Then go  over to the Waffle House and learn how butter should be served. For those management people that need the cliff notes version, you serve the butter soft and the pancakes hot so that the butter melts on to the pancakes.

I've heard some scuttlebut over the years that there are health code regulations about serving butter soft. I find that hard to believe since every other restaurant I visit seems to have soft butter.

This will definitely be my last visit to Ihop.

Tube steaks.  Yes, tube steaks!

Here are some fun facts, or maybe urban legend.  Babe Ruth was reported to have once ate 12 hot dogs & 8 bottles of soda between games of a double header. He was rushed to the hospital after the game.  What a surprise, right?  

Al Capone's favorite food was???  Anyone?  Bueller?   Nathan's Coney Island!  What no Vienna Beef?  Today, Chicago's O'Hare sells more than 2 million hot dogs a year.  Now I am sure these dogs are Vienna Beef!

I bring this up, because about a year ago SONIC decided to broaden their hot dog menu, with four new dogs: All American, Coney Island, Chicago and New York.  This year they've added a 1/4 pound Footlong to their lineup of Tube Steaks.  http://www.sonicdrivein.com/MenuSection/coneys-hot-dogs

Admitted, I haven't been an SONIC aficionado up until now.  But, a "shout out" to my friend Jennifer W and her family, who must be considered the unofficial Queen of SONIC!  How do you stay so thin?

I was willing to give their new menu items a try.  First the bad news, these aren't Nathan's Famous, Hebrew National, or Vienna Beef.  They aren't even Oscar Mayer!  But, for $3.99 for a 1/4 pound footlong hot dog and Tater Tots, they're not bad.  And, a lot better than Der Wienerschnitzel!

BTW, the  World Record for hot dog eating is 68 set by Joey Chestnut at Nathan's Famous in Coney Island.  It was reputed that former Champ, Takeru Kobayashi ate 69 at a nearby location.  Ugh!~

Had it not been for the Illuminations Half Marathon http://www.yelp.com/biz/illuminations-half-arizona-phoenix, I would have never known...never known that set amidst the majestic Sonoran Desert and surrounded by the beautiful McDowell Mountains--rows upon prickly rows of saguaro cacti maintaining their century-old vigils--sits JW Marriott's spectacular Desert Ridge Resort.

People golf here, it seems.  I mean, the Marriott shoulders two championship golf courses, ones designed in part by Arnold Palmer, and they look seriously cool...if you're a golfer.  I'm not.  In fact, I hate golfing.  Rather, I came here to run.  And these courses, illuminated for the Half Marathon with hundreds and hundreds of glowsticks, were great fun nonetheless--beautiful, even after sundown.

The amenities at the Marriott--lazy river, heated pools, spa, fitness center, tennis courts (to name a few)--were impressive.  And although I hadn't the time to explore them--my stay was short--I took notice, traveling about the resort, snapping a few shots.  Next time--and I'm sure there'll be a next time--I'll give them a try.  What was nice, though, was simply waking early, grabbing a Peppermint Mocha from the in-house Starbucks, and sitting outside, fire pit cozy.  I love mornings!  And in Phoenix, it seems, some golfers enjoy mornings too.

Just used them to move from Ahwatukee to Central Phoenix and these guys were outstanding! I've moved 5 times in the Phoenix area and each move has had problems. One time the movers didn't bring enough wardrobes. I didn't have any problems with Creative. Jesse and Eric were terrific! They were very fast and professional. I had to store my stuff for a week because my new place wasn't ready and Conrad (the owner) quoted me a fair price. They are the best and deserve all the great reviews. I have no complaints about this moving company and highly recommend them. One thing I appreciated was fact Conrad always answered my emails and was in constant contact with me about the move. It relieves a lot of stress when you have a professional mover. I called a lot of movers but based my decision on Yelp. I always use Yelp to find local businesses.

From Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich comes an authentic, contemporary Italian restaurant.  It's good! 

This is not your "we import everything from Italy so we are an Italian restaurant", nor is it "I use my mamma's recipes and she was Italian so this is authentic".  B&B creates classic Italian flavors using what is available seasonally, in the area.  From fresh herbs and produce to house cured salumi, it all goes into creating outstanding authentic food.

Antipasti features a simple but perfect braised tripe alla Romana.  Tender, with no off smell.  Vibrant acidity from the tomatoes add a nice foil to the mildly flavored tripe.  Perfect.  The grilled octopus, heaven.  Toothsome with a charred bitter edge that contrast well with the sweet, spicy, sour limoncello vinaigrette.  The lemony perfume is heady.  Sensory overload on a single plate.

Prima focuses around perfectly cooked, authentic pastas.  The bucatini all'Amatriciana is near Roman perfect.  Fatty, porky goodness of guanchale, bright acidity from pured tomatoes, a zing of acidity from some wine, lightly spiced and finished with pecorino cheese.  If that's too simple, the bone marrow ravioli is to die for.  Rich unctuous goodness surrounded by thin pasta bathed in a veal shank ragu that must have simmered all day.

Secondi proteins are different (lamb, rabbit, quail).  Experiment.  The deep fried sweetbreads, Win.   Crisp on the outside, pillowy on the inside; they pair perfectly with the sweet sour balsamic glazed cippolinis and the sweet bitterness of charred corn.  Don't think about what you're eating and you should be OK.

Massive Italian centric wine list representing DOC / DOCG throughout the country.  Good vintage depth for super Tuscans.  Vegas resort prices.

True Italian service, friendly with great pride taken in what they do.

Ahhhh...the feel of 24 carat gold on my face...

Walking around Kierland Commons in Phoenix the other day with a good friend, Karen, we noticed that one of the stores in the mall carries La Prairie products, the COS Bar.  We stopped in and asked one of the saleswomen in the store, Barbara, about the La Prairie 24 carat gold product.  One of my wisest, oldest, and closet friends who's living the life in London, Davinchi, told me about an interesting experience he had with this particular skin care product which is made in France.  

The product is beautifully encased in a gold cylindrical container that is shaped like a thick, gold-plated, humanoid penis.  Barbara squirted a small amount of the super serum onto the back of our hands.  The serum was clear and viscous.  There were literally tiny, sparkling flecks of gold flakes suspended in the essence that were clearly visible to the naked eye.  Rubbing the serum into my skin with a circular motion, it took a bit of time for it to dissolve thoroughly and to absorb through the outer skin layer.  It left a slightly tacky finish, a slightly golden tinge on my skin, and an earthy, musky fragrance that reminded me of wild vegetation growing in the rainforest.  

Barbara allowed Karen and me to apply a small amount of the product to our faces.  We applied it to the base of our foreheads, cheeks, and nose.  Barbara promised that within a few hours we would notice a significant improvement in our skin hue and condition.

Before leaving the COS Bar, I noticed that the 5 inch, penis shaped, gold plated container only contains 1 fluid ounce of product.  And, the price is $570.  

We walked around the commons for a bit and eventually forgot about the serum on our faces.  But, later that night in my hotel room while brushing my teeth I looked into the mirror at me staring at me and remembered Barbara's promise.  I looked at every detail of my face carefully, every line, ridge, and undulation, searching for improvement.  Everything looked pretty familiar. I sighed. I sighed a heavy sigh of relief.  I guess I wouldn't want to ever be anyone other than me - that's right, me with all my flaws and my imperfect skin.  

I finally noticed that my cheeks seemed to glow in a brighter shade of a golden hue.  But, it was probably because I was happy.

There's no cosmetic that works better than happiness.

Sure, you kids have got your Rain and your Pure and your Snoopy Dog parties, but in keeping with my old lady name, I prefer some of the simple elderly pleasures in life...like bingo. Okay, so maybe I went to keep my mom entertained for a couple of hours...and maybe I've accompanied my mom on many a bingo excursion before, but this was the first to Gold Coast's bingo hall...and I'm more than a fan. 

Picture this hypothetical scenario: you've already withdrawn your $300 for the day, the blackjack tables haven't treated you so well, and you're in dire need of a drink. Hypothetically, of course. Well, for a mere $10 you get unlimited booze (you don't even have to wait for the cocktail gal, you can get your free booze directly from the bar) and the chance to annoy old folks and win a few hundred bucks. 

Sadly, the bad luck wasn't shaken by an afternoon bingo session, but five vodka tonics later...I left there one happy bingo-er.

I volunteered with a group from yelp to help with the "backpack for kids" program. Bins were organized along 2 sides and ready for us to gladly tackle it! We put on our handy dandy yelp finger-less gloves (thanks Drew!), grabbed a plastic bag, went down the line putting the amount posted on each food/drink bin in the bag and repeated the process until we were finished. It only took a couple of hours and together we packed over 3,200 bags! It's such a shame any child is hungry, but thank heavens for this program! These will go to children who might have nothing to eat over the weekend or when they are not at school. I had obviously heard of Three Square before, but I had no idea about this program as well the other volunteer opportunities available. I'm happy to have helped knowing how many kids were given meals and plan on volunteering here again! You should too! 

Check the calender on their website or call for upcoming opportunities that you can get involved in!

The Cycle Pub Crawl took us here as one of the stops but we wish they hadn't. For a chain restaurant, their prices are designed to gouge the nearby tourists. $16 for one Coke and one poorly crafted margarita. This is what you'd expect to pay at a nightclub, but not a crappy chain restaurant.
We all ordered drinks upon arriving and a couple of us had to flag down servers for a missing soda and margaritas. We watched the bartender keep dropping his drink recipe notes. The nachos were disgusting. It tasted like stale chips with what looked like dog food on top...I wouldn't feed this to my dog. The servers had no idea who ordered what and settling the bill was a monumental task for them. Make sure you count your change before you leave.
A very disappointing experience.  I wouldn't waste my time or money since there are plenty of other better places to go nearby.

I was not impressed by Freed's. They make amazing looking cakes and perhaps should change their name to reflect that specialty. Their selection of baked goods is only a smidgen above a school bake sale. Most of the case display shows simple cookies that you can get from a supermarket. I asked if they ever make macarons and it seemed very foreign to them. 
We came in to pick up some fresh fruit tarts and although they looked pretty and the fruit was fresh and firm, the filling was a huge disappointment. It tasted like it was mostly shortening and left a strange film after eating. The cookie part tasted like the Danish butter cookies you get from a tin. None of us took more than a couple bites of it before throwing it away. What a waste. I don't get the hype on this place for anything more than pretty looking cakes.
The upside is the friendly service.

An AYCE sushi restaurant for those who don't like sushi.  Jjanga is about sushi drowned (literally sitting in a puddle)  with sauces that mask  the taste of the seafood.

Typical AYCE quality; previously frozen, gassed and thawed fish and color added fish eggs atop mediocre quality, sticky, seasoned, over compacted short grain rice.  

The nigiri rundown:  Maguro, hamachi, and salmon previously frozen, tako rubbery (not tenderized prior to cooking), the amaebi previously frozen, sticky, ammoniated taste, beef tataki tough, tamago over cooked.

Appetizers are in line with other AYCE joints.  Bought in gyoza and shumai, mayo coated baked mussels, overcooked but flavorful scallop and shrimp skewers, OK teriyaki chicken drowned in cold sauce, chewy steak, overcooked but well seasoned grilled mackerel, and the ubiquitous elongated shrimp tempura (shrimp split lengthwise, heavily coated and fried crisp).

Vegas style rolls are a disaster.  The "dragon roll" (Cali roll with a liquid mayo filling topped by rubbery eel and drowned in a cloyingly sweet, sticky, soy concoction) and the "Jack Pot Special" (Oily shrimp tempura, crab and cucumber surrounded by oil soaked rice topped with spicy crab, shrimp avocado, tempura cast offs and eel with a watered down spicy mayo spooned over all are enough to stop you from trying more.

Fun ambiance.  Fast service at the sushi bar.  $20.95 lunch, $25.95 dinner.  There is a time limit for ordering.  It was not enforced on two visits.

Falling below the pack of AYCE options in Vegas but an option if quantity is all that matters.

I'm a fan of Arby's because I enjoy their Reuben Sandwich and their Turkey Sandwich. It's a chill place with just the right A/C setting. I usually catch up on my reading during lunch so this place ticks all the right boxes in that regard.

My major gripe about this Arby's is in their haste to always upsell you they charge you more than what you order. I upgrade my drink size but it doesn't mean I want their gigantic curly fries. I finally had to read the riot act today and spell it out for them. Many years ago you would get a print out receipt of every item you ordered. These days you get the total you were charged on your credit card but you don't have any idea if you were charged correctly on each item.

So even though I still like you Arby's, I'm not ringing that bell.

One of the best hotels in Las Vegas. The customer service is first class. If you are gambler or non gambler you will be treated with great service. I love the hotel VIP customer service and fast room service. If you are looking for a location on the strip that is steps away from all the attractions and main casinos you found the place. 

If you are person who enjoys gambling and looking for an excellent casino host I would highly recommend Mickey Petkus. Mickey has been my casino host for over 16 years and Mickey is really an excellent host. 

If you are just coming here for a night or a weekend you will love it. The hotel has excellent restaurants to clubs. It all depends how what your evening brings you.

Color me unimpressed. This is an overhyped CenPho eatery that doesn't deliver the goods. Too many people get caught in that "it's local with fresh ingredients" dialogue.  I only care if it tastes good. 

Our office decided to order from here so I ordered a chicken taco and two short rib tacos for $9.30. I'm at a loss to describe any good features about the tacos except to say they are small with two tortillas wrapped together around the meat. I might go back  to try the burger someday. Although I had a taste of their shake and that was decent. So that's why I'm putting this place at 2 stars instead of one star.

This place is great! The sushi is to die for! I really wish they would open one is Los Angeles. If you go try their Viva Las Vegas Roll and the Gojira Roll. They are out of this world good. The mushroom miso was a little weird because it was really not miso-ey (if that makes any sense). 

Also, if you go on a Sunday they have a DJ and their happy hour is amazing. I love happy hour and this is by far one of my favorites in Vegas. If you are staying at the Wynn it is directly across the street. So make sure you give it a try. I would definitely  recommend giving this place a try.

For my 800th review I chose my alma mater, UNLV.  It's been a while since I've graduated from this University.  However, I've had many interns from the school work for me and have hired many graduates over the years.  I also attend a lot of events at the school and remain very close with Alumni.  Here's my breakdown of the school:

PROS

- It's very cheap.  Even though tuition is going up, it's still less than many other State schools.

- Much of the campus has new buildings.  When I go on campus now, it feels like a strange place and I get lost all of the time because its 3x larger than it was when I attended.

- Great professors.  I can only speak about the College of Hotel Administration and the Business School.....the professors were awesome.  I learned so much from them.  Learning is a 2 way street, it's up to you to get as much out of it as you can.  It's not on the professors to make the class how you like it, you have to adjust to their teaching style and learn as much as possible.  To this day I remain in contact with many former professors.

- Nice campus.  By Vegas standards there's a lot of greenery around campus, which is a refreshing change of scenery.

- Library.  One of the best libraries in town is located on the UNLV campus.

- Basketball team.  The UNLV Runnin' Rebels have always been the favorite team in the city.  We've had some good years recently.  Hopefully we'll continue to build upon it and improve as time goes on.

CONS

- Minuscule Endowment Fund.  One of the main reasons UNLV is having a difficult time surviving in this economy is not only because of state cutbacks but also because the endowment is very tiny.  The school needs more support from the private sector.

- Visitor parking.  Student parking has improved dramatically since the time I was a student.....however, visitor parking is a nightmare.  I dread parking every time I go on campus.

Overall, I have fond memories of UNLV.  My experience here has helped me with my career and I've established many lifelong friendships over the years.  I would be proud to send my Son to this school.

Ichiza was shut down by the SNHD on June 30. 
http://vegas.eater.com/archives/2014/07/03/japanese-favorite-ichiza-shut-down-by-snhd.php

Ugh. If you like to play Russian Roulette with your health, keep reading. But personally, I'd never come here again, because they don't practice basic hygiene yet they serve raw fish and raw beef. Yuck. 

The food was decent, 4 stars. It reminds me of a smaller, dirtier Honda-ya in Tustin.  They've got typical Izakaya-style items on their menu, such as sashimi, yakitori and ramen. I really enjoyed the kimchi buta and the famous honey toast. I also got the beef tataki, which was decent, but now I feel queasy that I ate it. . 

The decor isn't much. It feels like an authentic Japanese Izakaya; small, cramped, with a decent sake list and faded pieces of paper taped to the wall. 

Service was ok, it wasn't packed on a Thurs. night when we went. 

Decent place, but with the health concerns and so many other good places to eat nearby, I doubt I'll ever go back here again.

Up until this past week it's been about four years since I've been to Corleone's. My wife ordered a chicken sandwich which she loved. So that was a major hurdle to satisfy the picky eater in the family.

 I had the sausage, greenpeppers and onions with the marinara sauce. Since I've been minimizing my consumption of bread lately, I just ate everything except the bun. The presentation of the meal is pretty impressive when you look at two large buns filled with stuff. But when you get into the meat of the meal you find that there's a lot more bun than meat. I have to say that I enjoyed the meal but thought the ratio of meat to bun was pretty weak.

I say this place is Yelped correctly at 3 1/2 stars.

Best advice I can give you about Great Wall is to BYOA. 

Yep.

I said it. Bring your own Asian. 

Thankfully our group of 10 had two. It was critical in navigating the ENORMOUS amounts of food and certainly critical in deciding which things the gringos could handle.

Thumbs up to postickers, egg rolls, chow mein noodles, shui mai and other various dumplings. 

And a big phew for a tutorial on how to eat fresh shrimp. "Peel off the shell, suck out the brains and then eat the rest."

Yep. 

This is where I swig down a cold Tsing Tao

And the chickens feet. Oh for the love. The freakin' chicken feet. "Just suck off the skin and throw the foot back on the plate."

Yep.

BYOA! I'm telling ya.

I had a BLAST. Carts were everywhere. Service was friendly and swift. Ten of us ate and ate and ate for $200 including tip. Oh. Also one of my Asian American diners informed me that the one man pushing the "porridge" cart only stops at the white people tables because the "porridge" is absolutely frightening to see. Sure enough. He stopped by our tables and scooted quickly by those tables full of Asians. 

I love a place with a sense of humor. 

Great food. Great fun. Great Wall.

I love going here for lunch!  I have been there several times because it is close to work and I have to get out of the office!  I love the soups here. Just had the vegetable and the ingredients were so fresh.  The salads are also very good.  I have tried the blueberry wrap and that is one of my favorites.  I have heard from the owner that she will even be delivering to office buildings in the area.  This is the best place to go if you like everything fresh.  Perfect vegetarian spot!

I'm the Duke so I'm not not a fan. 

Pros: 
-It's just $10 a month and serves its purposes. $20 if you desire massage and tanning machine privileges and other things that $10 more gets you.
-No commitment. You pay monthly and cancel anytime.
-Lots of cardio machines which include treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, stairs, etc. I'm guessing at least 40 machines for cardio so you're not really waiting to go running or walking.
-Clean and well maintained equipment. PF is still pretty new but I'm always seeing gym users and employees wiping down equipment and cleaning. If something ain't working its usually fixed asap.
-Almost everything is in pairs. If someone is using the 10 lbs dumbbells there's another set of 10 lbs dumbbells. If someone is using the leg extension machine there's another one. 
-Equipment are organized and spaced out. Arm equipment are grouped with other arm equipment, back equipment, chest, legs, abs, etc.
-Lots of TVs at least 20.
-Showers always a plus.
-The staffs friendly.
-Temperature and environment is set right.
-Gym is open 24/7 and the staff is there 24/7.
-The Lunk alarm keeping lunks in check.
-Ive never seen it too busy.
-Free pizza and donuts once a month!!!

Cons (not really cons its more like limits or what they're not offering):
-If you want to bench your options are smiths machine or max out with 75 lbs dumbbells.
-Free weight barbells limited to 65 lbs.
-You bring your own towels, soap, shampoo, etc. Its not a motel.
-You can't drop weights, they'll scold you or you'll set off the lunk alarm. 
-No sauna, swimming pools, basketball courts, scales to weigh yourselves.
-Cardio machines don't have USB connections so can't charge ur phones while running a long time. Sorry Android users with bad batteries.
-No free weight Olympic bars.
-3 showers.
-No classes like LVAC, 24hr fitness, or Gold's Gym.

This is a nice casual place to get some fish. They cook it up anyway you want it (cue Journey), whether it be fried, grilled, blackened, etc.

I have ordered the Taco Mountain every time I've been there. You have a choice of other types of meat besides fish. I always go for the fish. I find that the fish is always fresh and cooked just right. The next time I go in there I'll have to order something different. Pro Tip - This place is a zoo during Fridays when Lent is in season. When you can't find a parking spot, you might as well go with Plan B.

Let me start this Yelp by saying I've never given the business to a stripper. Are we clear? Ok.

I'll tell you why this place gets five stars... Because not one but two of the dancers offered to go home with me. 

One for $250. She said "If you have $250, we can go somewhere together." And then she licked my ear and showed me her guns. Her shift was over and she was in street clothes, mind you.

So guess what happened next? 

Stripper two (who actually did leave with me - long story) said, "Gross, some skanky girl licked you and her breath was terrible." I was embarrassed, yet psychologically removed from that experience.

What happened with Stripper two is a great story but I don't know that I want to share it here. But if you go to this club, one piece of advice (Useful alert!): the less attractive dancers require money to leave with you. The self-possessed hotter ones do not. However, if you get her naked in your bed, do no verify pre-coitus that she is not, in fact, a prostitute, because she will leave and call you names as your front door slams behind her. Or so my buddy tells me. Such trifling arrows of human amusement are not found in this man's quiver of irresponsible behavior.

"....and I think to myself, what a wonderful world." - "What a Wonderful World",- Louie Armstrong

Great show by a talented performer!

I watched the beginning of Terry Fator's meteoric rise to Las Vegas headliner on America's Got Talent several years ago.  To describe Terry - he is a singing impressionist ventriloquist comedian.  He does spot-on impersonations & sings better via ventriloquism than others do through their own accord.  It was w/ great anticipation that I finally caught his Vegas show in his very own theatre.

To be frank, this show may be not be everyone's cup of tea.  He is, after all, using puppets.  However, I'm a big fan!  His impressions of past & present performers, such as Cher, Dean Martin, Stevie Wonder & Adele are brilliant.  His comedy sketches are witty & current.  I thought it may have became a little edgy for some w/ one of his puppets "coming out the closet", but I thought it was hilarious.

Terry also sings a few original songs sans puppets during the show.  One entitled "Horses in Heaven" & the other a tribute to the troops.  "Horses in Heaven" is based on a true story of a child w/ cancer.  He mentioned to the audience that the Las Vegas powers that be thought  the song was too heavy & not appropriate for a Vegas show during it's development.  He defied the powers that be, and I enjoyed the song, which made me think of my own experience w/ cancer.  

Our show just happened to be the very one that surpassed 1 million guests to see Terry Fator's Vegas show.  Even better, everyone in attendance received a Terry Fator reusable bag w/ the following contents-

Terry Fator playing cards
2 for 1 at Mirage's Cravings buffet
$10 Free Slot Play w/ the Mirage Player's Card

I took that $10 Free Slot Play & magically turned it into $66 on a $1 slot machine!  Oh yeah, I'm good :)
It was my last night in Vegas, and capped an already great trip.

I highly recommend catching Terry Fator's show at the Mirage during your next trip to Vegas.  I laughed, I was moved & I had an absolute great time.

Excelsior!

Slice window review!

Skip! ... end of review. The only time you should be here is if you're in too much of a rush to eat anywhere else. Due to the chewy dough, unremarkable sauce and the fact that they might have been sitting there all day, all of the slices are mediocre at best. Everything seems pretty low quality, maybe a slight step up from Domino's or Papa Johns. It seems like you can get some higher quality items inside, so maybe do yourself a favor and eat in there, but from what I've seen from the 3 slices I've rocked here, that might not be much better. 

Prices: $4 plain slice, $5 one topping, $5.75 specialty slices...bleh
Compare that to Pop Up Pizza who is serving 2 specialty slices and a soda for $7 and some change :/

"If you need me I'll be watching CSI from the bathtub." 

And that's exactly what I did thanks to the nice little TV on the wall in the bathroom. 

With this all suites hotel connected to Mandalay Bay I was quite pleased when we rolled in. After watching 'The Hangover' 50 times I've had an urge to step up the Vegas game and while we didn't wake up with a tiger in the bathroom I can say this was one of the nicest rooms I've had in my 20+ trips to Vegas. 

Two sinks in the main bathroom. Very nice shower and the deepest of bathtubs. Two big ass flat screen TVs in the bedroom and living room. Extra bathroom off the living room in case you have a friend who is ready to blow chunks from too much partying. 

Our view from the 24th floor had me drunkenly staring from the Mandalay pools to the neighboring hotels and off into the hills. Gorgeous. 

What an amazing stay, I could have slept the rest of my life away in that bed. So comfortable. 

People say Mandalay Bay is a nice hotel... Next time you hear that just say "Pshhhh, I'll be in THEhotel. Mandalay Bay standard is for chumps." Pretty good episode of CSI too.

Scary things to me:
Paris Hilton has a career. 
Sarah Palin. Really. She's like the new Anita Bryant. 
My fathers' overgrown eyebrows. Trim, daddy, trim!
Droves of high schoolers leaving school just as I'm trying to find Barrio Cafe. 

Seriously. Like thousands of them. And I couldn't find the damn restaurant. What was I gonna do? Roll down the window (well, not roll down, seriously, who rolls down windows anymore?) and holler out in my best lispy voice, "Hey, squeeze me fellas, I'm going to a wine tasting at the Barrio Cafe. Y'all know where that is?" Since all teenagers carry guns, yes, that scared me. 

Finally. I found it. And entered. 

Cute. Cozy. Middle of the day, so empty. Great, vibrant art. And a very attentive and friendly staff. Often times at this time of day, restaurants really drop the ball. No ball dropping here.
I had La Paloma margarita which is made with a grapefruit soda. Think Squirt and Patron! And after a couple of these babies I was in el bano squirting out that Patron. Dee lish however. 

I ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar. Enchiladas of the Sea for my non Spanish speaking peeps. You know what? It was good. Not great. And the presentation was somewhat messy. I couldn't find the crab or the scallops (which were the size of the ends of q-tips by the way). They were lost in the sauce and the cheese. But I devoured it as the blue corn tortillas sang to me. My friend had a chickent torta. Big and rustic. Like Janet Reno. She loved it! 

I will most definitely be back. Hopefully I will not have to navigate through the plethora of pubescent people and hopefullyl I will pick that Barrio menu item that will blow my calcentinas off. 

Oh. That's blow my socks off. BTW. Adios for now mi yelpitas!

"Do you know on this one block you can buy croissants in five different places? There's one store called Bonjour Croissant. It makes me want to go to Paris and open up a store called Hello Toast."    Fran Lebowitz

Woke up this morning to find some delicious croissants on the table and a mug of french-pressed Kona coffee all thanks to Mr. W.  This is how every morning should start off.  Being that it was a gorgeous Sunday morning, I sat down on the couch, dragged a throw blanket over my shoulders, ripped a croissant in half, and chewed on the most flaky and buttery croissant ever.  It was light, airy, and delicious.  I was lucky enough to grab a peanut butter filled one and had ended up splitting it with Mr. W.  Also to be tasted was a Bavarian cream filled croissant.

P.croissants has been Mr. W.'s favorite place for croissants growing up, seeing that his childhood home is down the street.  I'm glad he's decided to share this treat spot with me.  I would love to come back and try some of their sandwiches!

Book & Stage is a small bar near the lobby of the Cosmopolitan. After spending 3 nights at the hotel and hitting the bar a couple times, it was a-ok as a hotel bar, but there wasn't any live performances in the evenings, the book portion is small, and there are better bars at the Cosmopolitan. 

The bartenders are nice and all ... like most drink slingers in Las Vegas. No complaints about the service; however, both visits we left and headed elsewhere cause the place was practically empty. When there aren't any live performances on the small stage, then perhaps the niche Book and Stage fills in as a quieter bar choice than other Cosmopolitan hot spots.

That awkward moment when a club is suppose to show off what it has on opening night. I guess it was to bad I was a dude. Arrived late because honestly everything starts at 11pm anyways, to be told, as almost ever other guy in line, the would not be letting anymore males in. This happens at most places in Scottsdale but given the fact it was me and three women I thought I would be fine, but was very mistaken they were told they could go in, but without me, cause that made sense.

None the less, I guess I will not be spending my money here.

Two strikes you're out Barrio Cafe. I love supporting local businesses and have been so pleased to see the arrival of so many to the airport but when I'm at the airport I must put efficiency first. This is where barrio Cafe sadly fails. In the future I will stop in for a drink but I will only sit at the bar and nothing more. This is because the service is sadly some of the worst I've experienced. On two separate occasions I've eaten here and both times the lack of service have almost cost me to miss my flight. After serving the food the wait staff seems to disappear and it's impossible to find them. I would ask and ask and then when I note my need to hurry for fear of missing my flight I have been snidely commented to by the staff. The food and drinks are good but I think the customer service and efficiency needs major improvement if they want to be successful in an airport environment.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 40/100

Quite a pleasure to see while visiting Vegas! There is a huge lake in front of the Bellagio hotel, which is where the water fountain show takes place every 15-30 minutes. My boyfriend and I recently watched it this past weekend and it was wonderful! The particular show we watched was played along to the song, "All That Jazz." 

As much as I loved watching these fountains, I still think that I wasn't as impressed as I could have been. I've watched World Of Color at California Adventure in Anaheim, CA, and I think that World Of Color is MUCH more impressive than the Fountains of Bellagio. Don't get me wrong, the Bellagio fountains are great and definitely the landmark on the strip, BUT they aren't the best I've ever seen.

Located on Las Vegas Blvd near Charleston. In the grungy area so usually do it in the day and it's not good for big parties as the dining room is really small.

This is a follow up review and I Love this place. 

But I'm not over selling it and dont expect a fancy looking decor and designer napkins - it's not gonna happen. The waitress and t.v. are set for spanish...cuban style so be ready.

Lunch pollo criollo , black beans, avacado salad and iron beer.  All we're bangin my drums and made it a better day :)

Fast service  and like eating at a relatives and all really good.

Been eating here for along time.

Ted's is a Phoenix original by way of Buffalo and has probably fed tens of thousands ASU students and teachers over the years.

Ted's history is similar to that of other Hot Dog pioneers like Paul and Betty Pink, Nathan Handwerker, and Dick Portillo. All who started with just a Hot Dog cart, and grew their business into something very special. 

But Ted's is the immigrant story of Theodore Spiro Liaros, who came to the US from Greece at the turn of the last century.  

One of these days, someone will take the time to write the history of all the hard working Greeks who came here with just the shirt on their back, to start a restaurant or food business.

But I digress, because you come to Ted's to enjoy the charcoal grilled hot dogs and hamburgers and all the friendly conversation on line. Ahh, and those charcoals are white hot (see photo), which makes their food oh so delicious.  

They have Hot Dogs, Hamburgers, Brats, Italian Sausages, French Fries and home made beer batter like Onion Rings (photo), along with Milk Shakes and Malts.

Ted's is really just great food, served simply. I can highly recommend those afore mentioned All Beef Hot Dogs, Sausage and Onion Rings. All the tube steaks are $3.79 and you can take home some of their special bottled mustard for $5.39 as I did.

Enjoy!

I wished Bellagio had an electroshock therapy vendor to administer temporary memory loss.  That way I could forget about every other Cirque show I've seen and "O" would blow my mind like it did the first time I saw it in 2002.  Sign me up and please hand me that rubber thing that stops me from biting my tongue.

The writer and director of the show, Franco Dragone, is freakin brilliant!  How in the world does one conceptualize a show like this and then explain to others how it's all supposed to work without being shoved into a windowless van with a one way trip to the funny farm?  I can only imagine the conversations he had before it got the green light:


Dragone: "So honey, it'll be a stage that will change from a big assed pool with 1.5 million gallons of water and back into a dry stage that can be walked on  throughout the show.  And then there will be a ton of synchronized swimmers and the theatre is going to look like a 14th century opera house.  I was thinking during dinner last night that there should be a guy in the show that will set himself on fire."

Mrs. Dragone: "Yes, dear. (rolls eyes)  Don't forget to mow the lawn tomorrow.  We have company this weekend."    


Later in the day....


Dragone: "Aerialists! Clowns! Contortionists! Trapeze! People on a Russian swing and swimmers everywhere!  Sometimes it will all happen at the same time!  Lots of leotards too!"

Dragone's ex-college roommate: "Yeah, yeah.  Sounds sweet.  Pass the bong already."


Sure, there are detractors that say it's too pretentious and artsy fartsy.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  After all these years, "O" is still inspiring, a welcome escape from reality, and a "can't miss" show in town.

You know what? I watched the Pound Puppies too. I had dreams of rescuing one of those little Hogan's Heroes clones from their little prison, but in real life that isn't necessarily the best way to go.  Cooler never got parvo.

There is a lot of tramatic backstory to my dog ownership that i will spare you but lets say I have been scarred and it took a lot for me to agree to go here to even look.

Several kennels were full of dog shit...haha yeah dogs live there, no sick looking dogs laying in puddles of runny wrong coloured dog shit, it kennels with healthier looking dogs rolling around in the same sick shit. Yes I am being intentionally vile with my language to make the poit of how vile it was. SHIT!

We saw a dog that we loved. I said no; she said please...then a woman told us this dog was on "the list" yup his last day on god's green earth if he didn't get adopted so we took him. A day or so after we pick him up his little cough is turning into a scary and serious sounding wheez so we take him to the vet, over a thousand dollars later we are told the dog has both pnemonia and parvo...surprise surprise since we picked hi up he had dried SHIT in his fur (keep in mind he was not to be bathed for two weeks because of having just been neutered, yes a freshly operated on dog with dried shit in his fur)
 Oh and puppies don't really recover from that sort of thing so w paid the very nice vet to kill out dog...euthenasia...super....

As she bawls her eyes out I man up to call and let the MCACC know hoping they can take some preventative measures, ya know like not let other dogs roll in the shit that he left. (Parvo is super contagious). They let us know the only action they would take was to make note in our file so that if we went to adopt again they would know we didn't already have a dog in the household...yup...My next dog will be adopted from a much more responsible shelter. I understand low budgets and whatnot but how much does it cost to hose runny shit out of a kennel? GRRR.

Fat Heads makes some seriously fat/phat sandwiches.

I got a crazy good grease-wich when I came here in December. An artery clogger combination of egg, cheese, Linguia, thick bread, and other random elements of pure tastiness.

Each bite was worth the 10 dribbles of grease that would drip out onto my crumpled collection of napkins.

If you're in the area and looking for a fun rowdy place to watch a Steelers game with good food - def stop at Fat Heads. If you're looking for a "fill you up, can barely move once you're done" -  meal -  check out Fat Heads. If you're looking for a nice selection of unique beer brews - come to Fat Heads.  If you're looking for a casual place to catch up with friends - over a massive plate of nachos - go to Fat Heads  (though be prepared to wait awhile if it's game night.)

If you're looking for something light and some peace and quiet - - eh.....- you may want to head elsewhere.

Do not order large drinks here. 

They use the same amount of coffee in all sizes. Coffee is the most expensive part of an espresso drink, selling larger drinks with the same amount of coffee at premium prices is dishonest. 

I know of NO other shop that sells coffee in this manner, a large drink always means more coffee.

One star until this policy changes.

EDIT: 

Just physically removed from Roosevelt Tavern by the owner Matt Poole (same owner of Giant) because: 

"You are an asshole. You proved it by not fixing your Yelp! review for over two weeks. You are not welcome in any of my places ever again." 

I responded that this was actually the first time I'd ever spoken directly with him, he said I owed him a phone call and that I didn't know how social media worked. By leaving a bad review I was stealing food from his children's mouth. ?? 

Also the owner of Matt's Big Breakfast, keep this in mind when you're deciding where to spend your hard earned money.

Coca~Cola... Iconic. Powerful. Unique.  Why did you have to make this place? In Lost Wages of all places, you may know it as Sin City, or a debaucherous den of sex drugs gambling and prostitution... ohhhh wait, what a PERFECT place to put a family destination =D

Pro Tip: Free Samples... great if you drink the fizzy stuff... and some are floats!!!

Why didn't I think of that? I guess that is why I don't get paid the big bucks... regardless this place is the ultimate homage to the power of swag and branding... I do not know of a single other item that is universally known in every corner of the globe nearly half as well as coke... It's everywhere. The only thing crazier is the weirdo's who want all of the coke swag...

Pro Tip #2: Leave your tooth in coke overnight and it will dissolve =X

So if when I still drank soda, I would have been here, I would have enjoyed it much more than as I got older and realized how evil and bad for you coke really is. At this point, I use it more as a solvent than anything else...

Pro Tip #3: Clean grease off your garage floor, car engine parts, or battery terminals by soaking it in coke or another type of soda, preferably flat...

None the less for all of my tongue in cheek stuff about coke, it is an awesome story and they have a lot of accomplishments for a company... I just think this is a poor choice for a Coke themed facility as I would have thought it was more child oriented. 

Overall this is an interesting place to visit and not half as cheesy as the M&M joint nearby. None the less... it is what it is...

I agree with the other 1 star reviews. This place is a scam. 

Went there last night after a nice run at the craps table. I got duped into going into the VIP. Only after paying the $500 fee was I told that there was a drink minimum of $200 on top. Of course this was after the dance started and now I can't get my money back. Then the stripper told me that I needed to add a tip for the server and her. Now the $500 dance was going to be more like $800. I got up and demanded my Id and credit card back. They refused to give it back unless I signed off on the $200 hidden drink fee for drinks that never even arrived. I ended up leaving my I'd and credit card. 

Low and behold today I have a $400 charge on my card. I have already filed a dispute with my credit card company and plan on doing whatever I can to make sure other people are not scammed. 

This place engages in unfair and deceptive trade practices and should be shut down. 

Bottom line don't go there. If you do go, do not go in the VIP room and DO NOT pay with a credit card.  Stay away from this scam of a place. Go to spearmint rhino or sapphire if you are looking for some adult entertainment.

"You can make the reservation, but you cannot hold the reservation."

Here with a bachelor party last Saturday night and we had a table reservation for the crew. We got there at 10:30pm and they told us we we were too late (claimed we had to be there by 10pm) and they had given our table away. After some bickering they let us in and we found that half the tables in the club were unoccupied and they were most definitely not sold out. 

With some pushing we eventually claimed a table and the night was saved. My poor friend who organized this part of the bachelor party weekend definitely lost a few hairs from the stress of the table initially falling through.

XS charges way too much money to screw up like that, so even though it's one of my favorite party spots in Vegas they only get 3 stars.

Just moved into the area and went to this location. It was so busy but staff was very helpful as I'm not used to this store and couldn't find the things I usually get. One time I went to another store and there was a demo of waffles with pomegranate seeds and yoghurt on it.  At this store there was a  sample with Belgian waffles, strawberries, and whipped cream...delicious!  So I bought the waffles and they were so cheap! I also love their Mediterranean feast meal. They have so many different items and prices are very reasonable. I find that I go to Trader Joe's a lot because of the variety of products and the atmosphere. I highly recommend Trader Joe's.

Come on, it's chocolate. Everybody loves chocolate. Errrrrrbody. 

So, why no love for Ethel M Chocolate Factory? On the drive there, you're excited like a little Violet Beauregarde and the suspense is terrible... you hope it'll last. It doesn't ... cause this chocolate factory is hardly worth the drive nor the most wonderful place in the whole world! 

It's a short self-paced walk through a hallway with a view of a factory without any oompa loompas or rivers of chocolate. It's some people running machines. We went in the afternoon and there was one person cleaning a machine. The "tour" is guiding you to a gift store with overpriced yet average chocolates. 

If my local supermarket or Costco sells Hersheys, Ghiradelli, Lindt, Cadbury, Ferrero Rocher, Guylian, Godiva, or even generic chocolate then do I really need to go here?

The small Cactus Garden is cool for a couple minutes. Of course, you just drove past a lot of cacti to see it. Of all the sites and attractions in and around Las Vegas, is this really how you want to spend your time? If so, pack up the Wagon Queen Family Truckster and head over.

The most impressive thing about the Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden are the tour buses and cars in the parking lot. They prove that everybody loves chocolate. Ethel doesn't need to be like Willy Wonka and promise a free lifetime supply ... because a small free sample seems to be doing a sweet job.

A great place for a great  happy hour!

I love how they start early, at 2PM goes to 6PM. They have beers for $5, wine and cocktails for $7. I'm not a fan of mojitos, but their Poolside Cruzan Mojito is really good! It's so much more refreshing than any mojitos I've ever had!

Their bar bites are $5-$9. They have a lot of interesting things like Po-Boy sliders, crawfish fritters, and ahi tuna tacos, but I didn't have any of that. I had their $1.50 oysters instead. It was so fresh like they just got their oysters from the ocean that day!

My husband was so in love with their oysters that we decided to come back before our flight back to San Jose. He said they were some of the best he ever had. With suitcases in hand, we practically ran here. We were 3 minutes late for happy hour and the hostesses insisted that happy hour was over. That was fair and that was fine, but I was a bit irritated when one of them said, "We already have a long happy hour." At least she forced a smile on her snobby face when she said that.

OMG DD! OMG! I'm eating my roast beef sandwich now, typing this review and pounding my hands on the table like Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally...moaning, groaning and achieving culinary orgasms. 

Now that's a pretty picture for ya!

House roasted roast beef with a blue cheese horseradish spread, red onion, tomato and my favorite green next to Brian Austin Green...arugula! All served on a yummy artisan roll. 

Such a cute place with a case FULL of delicious looking temptations from crab cakes to mashed sweet potatoes to chocolates and cheeses and VINO!! Great staff...friendly and helpful. Why I'm even a proud card carrying member of their sandwich club. And I'm sure it won't take me long to earn that free heavenly sandwich!

DD! Fyi...I will return to you asap!

Yet another really good burger option for the Chandler/101 area!

Over the last few months we've gotten a Smash Burger and now a Burger21 last week. If UR into red meat, how can you go wrong?

I came here to grab something for a late night at the office and Burger21 hit the roof of my flavortown mouth. Sorry Fieri!  LOL

I kept it simple. The cardiac arrest Blue Cheese and Bacon burger for only $7.95 and a Chocolate Malt ($4.95) to wash it down. Both were good. 

Expect to pay $12 or so, if you order a soft drink. Don't  those iced cold beers looked good? There's a real high probably I'll be back with some co-workers real soon.

Yodel -Le - He-Ho!!!   Been dying for some food to remind you of the French Alps? Yes? Well I have got a beautiful place for you to try ... a bit of  yumminess right here on Bell rd... Crepes, Tartines and Fondue ..what more could you ask for ? How about an ice cave ? Yes just when you thought that you'd never see an ice cave for comedians and what not ..there it is...  Seriously... right on the Bar side of the restaurant... Okay new place to try kids and it is really tasty. Husband and  I had the Scallop/Mediterre  Savory Crepe which was lovely  and the Jamon Frankekuchen --which translates loosely   "tasty ham / pear pizza with crescent roll crust  " super delicious ... now the shocker was the over hazelnutation of the  sweet  crepe...   wholly  nutella folks  ...too much ... but yet we ate it all. 
The interior begs for you to take this place seriously as a french
 /swiss alps restaurant  and to be honest it does remind me of a bistro we ate in Lucerne, Switzerland... , there  really is a fake ice cave ala the matterhorn area of Disneyland ,which the owner plans on using as a stage for comedians ..I am laughing already. 
There also is a crepe cam  which shows the making of the crepes in the kitchen  and is televised to the bar  area..ah.. neat.   

Call me and lets go get a crepe together!!

Did not know you could Zipline in Vegas!!! 

Buddy Ken C told me that you can zipline down Freemont Street for about 20 bucks. This definitely peaked my interest, but when the time came, i didn't feel like it- maybe it was the fear of getting stuck in the middle of the zipline and having to wait for someone to come fetch me, while i hang over hundreds of people (which did happen to a girl we saw). The wait on a friday night took a very long time, over an hour. But from all the smiling faces i saw ziplining above me while i watched, it looked like a lot of fun. We videotaped our friend coming down - they sell pictures of you ziplining for $20.00. 
If ur lucky, you might get to zipline during the Queen show, where they dim the lights a bit and play "We Will Rock You". You can zipline at the same time with 3 other people, so it would be a cool group activity (you can get group prices). Maybe next time, if i get buzzed enough, i might take the "leap". I'll be sure to take a considerate plastic bag with me.

Carrot Top elicits such a negative knee jerk reaction from so many.  It's like asking people at a pizza joint if they want anchovies.  When was the last time you actually had anchovies??  The guy has been a Vegas headliner since 2005.  There's got to be a reason why he's been able to stick it out on the strip and fill seats in that theater for the long haul while so many headline comedians have come and gone.  One year they're at the Excalibur, then The Plaza and then there's their one way ticket to Laughlin. 

I didn't think I would enjoy the show as much as I did.  He opened the show at a frenetic pace going from prop joke to prop joke.  Didn't think the joke was funny?  No problem!  There's another one in 5 seconds.  It was like watching the biggest 5 year old wise ass with A.D.D. show off his box of toys.  Freakin hilarious!!  The rest of the show was just as great.  You'll definitely laugh a lot and have a fun time unless you don't laugh at cock jokes.  So yeah....eunuchs may be sensitive to Carrot Top. 

We sat in the second to last row.  There's not a bad seat in the house.  You can purchase the cheapest seats without hesitation if you're still skeptical.

"SAKE SAKE BOOM BOOM !
SAKE SAKE BOOM BOOM !"

Oh, not right now? Well, if you had a fun group like we did and everyone was doing sake bombs then that is what you would be chanting before you take your group shot. Remember to out-do any groups surrounding you.. That's what we tried to do. Tip: Try their pomegranate one ;)

I have been here before when it was Geisha House and it did NOT impress me so I am glad that it is now Kanji. If you have never tried teppanyaki before then I suggest trying it here so you can see it done right.

The staff is attentive, hilarious, and will drink with you. 
Pro Tip: Do the Ji Shot (thank me later).

My favorite starter was the Beef Tataki, great presentation and tasted amazing. The egg rolls and shrimp tempura were also ordered and shared amongst all of us. 

Our teppan chef was Joshua, who was very skilled and entertaining. He kept our group cracking up the whole time he was cooking our food on the iron griddle. Thanks for giving us food shaped as a big heart, Spongebob, flowers, and all the other things you came up with during the cooking process! It was all so delicious, especially the steak.

I will be back for more and to try out the Green Tea Cheesecake that I was too full to order!

A good British steak house in the Paris?  Why not.

Love him or hate him, Gordon Ramsay is a multi Michelin stared chef.  Trying his London restaurants dispelled the myth for me that British food is bland and flavorless.  That said, at Gordon Ramsay Steak, the British signature dishes are the standouts.  As a steakhouse, it falls in the middle of the pack in price and quality behind Cut, StripSteak, and CraftSteak.

Two types of beef, limited cuts (epically if you are not sharing your steak).  28 day dry aged, prime beef is excellent.  Well trimmed.  Good marbling.  Beefy with the waft of umame.  The American kobe is feminine; tender, mild, almost sweet.  They claim the beef rates a BMS 10+ (Japanese A5), could be but it's nowhere near as flavorful as Australian or Japanese wagyu.

The signature dishes are outstanding.  Flavors are bold.  The Beef Wellington with a syrupy, red wine demi packs a flavor punch.  A classic.  The "Fisherman's Grill" is also exceptional.  Perfectly cooked lobster, mussels, scallops served with a silky curry sauce.  Oh yeah!.  

Sides meant to be shared.  The mushroom tart, gratineed spinach and blue cheese mac and cheese are good eats and make the perfect match to the dry aged beef by heightening the umame aftertaste.  Unfortunately their flavors overpower the kobe cuts.

Service is friendly and very efficient.

Very good international wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.

Note:  Use your Total Rewards casino card to get a slight (5-10 percent) discount.  Tier does not matter.

Seriously though, wtf is a container park? I get the concept, but was unsure of the execution. Could a pile of containers really be cool? Would it be a tourist gimmick? A place that you see once, never to return? Well, it turns out it is cool, and I will return many times. 

There are several places to dine, imbibe and shop for quirky items. Mexican, BBQ, jerky, cupcakes, ice pops, cocktails... it's all there with plenty of outdoor seating to combat the small interior dining space. Bolt Barbers are there (in a caboose) to give you a cut 'n shave, there's a play area for the kids, a gigantic slide for drunk adults, live tunes and a massive grasshopper with flames shooting out of its antennas.... what's not to enjoy? There is something for everyone. I think it's definitely a must-see if you're downtown. (note: there might also be some sort of party dome here) 

I've never been to another container park, so there's really no comparison. For now, and possibly forever, it will be the best and worst container park I've even been to.

I mean.. whats there to say that hasnt been said already... This review is based solely on the SLS casino, not the restaurants or shops. 

We pulled up to Valet and we were told it was for hotel guests only. but they let us valet anyways. which was nice. As soon as you walk in you are hit with the dingiest smells of all smells. stale smoke. I am not a fan of the cigarette but it is what it is. We were completely underwhelmed by it all. The "cool factor" felt forced. Almost like a 50 year old woman wearing purple eye shadow and dressed head to toe in some gaudy animal print. Bad vibes all around. I seriously couldn't leave my boyfriend for 5 minutes to use the restroom without 3 hookers approaching him. I mean seriously, the infestation of hookers alone will keep us away from this place.

We were insanely underwhelmed. And its really too bad with places like Bazzar Meats, Fred Seigle, and Life nightclub, I wish they would have gone to different venues. We will be back for those places alone. But as for the SLS... good luck on not going bankrupt your first year.

Admittedly, I like Popeyes! And yes, I am a Fan!

Whether its this one, or the one in Blythe coming back from California, it's a real treat to pick up some NOLA inspired food.  Their Cajun Gravy is to die for! Really.

Stopped in today to catch up with Scott D. We have been checking into businesses on Yelp together for over four years. Long time! It's been a fun four years and nice to kick back with a friend who also loves Popeyes!

I had a Po'Boy Chicken sandwich, which wasn't bad.  But I wouldn't insult any of my NOLA friends by calling it a true Po'Boy.  I also ordered three chicken strips and asked for a Cajun Gravy chaser.  LOL  It ran me just under $8.00, not a steal but a fair price. A better deal is what Scott ordered, their Tuesday Special of 2 pieces of chicken, biscuit and Pop for $2.99.  "Love that Chicken at Popeyes!"

Enjoy

Japanese restaurant, Chinese chef.  Vegas style.  

Imagine Nobu Matsuhisa in a food truck.  Less refined, pseudo Argentinean Japanese that taste great at a great price.

Small selection of relatively fresh, everyday seafood.  The sushi, AYCE quality (this is not an AYCE restaurant).  Average quality seasoned rice wrapped unevenly around massive amounts of filing or compacted to a brick in a mold and topped with this or that then heavily sauced.  Far from what a sushi master would make but the flavors are good.

Two standout "raw" fish dishes, the yellowtail and the white fish.  The first drowned in a yuzu soy, drizzled with garlic oil and topped with jalapeos and micro cilantro; the second drowned in a wasabi shiso vinaigrette and dusted with dry red miso powder.  Both rapidly cook in the acid and take on a ceviche texture but the flavors are solid.

Also noteworthy, the assortment of taro tostadas  Hamachi with salsa verde, salmon with pico de gallo, and Hawaiian style poke (no there are no pineapples in this) all crowned by an avocado cream and cilantro.  A great bite.

Nobuesque tempura (rock shrimp, king crab, assorted veg and shrimp), all not oily but over battered, masking the flavor what's inside but all work with the non traditional dipping sauces ie miso, yuzu aioli..

Finally the soy braised short rib with wasabi.  Well braised and glazed.  The wasabi cream compliments the earthy soy and cuts the richness of the dish.  Excellent.

Friendly, off Strip service.  Casual decor.  UNBELIEVABLE VALUE at around $20pp.

It's not authentic but it's all Vegas baby.

Electric Daisy Carnival is not just a destination, a place, a celebration, a setting, or a music festival. It's a life changing experience, an adventure... a magical wonderland! It was an ethereal, surreal journey. 

This year EDC is my first and I would not change it in any other way because of the memories we created together with friends and the new. So much fun/cool experience! 

There is no way I can describe EDC because you have to be there in order to feel the experience with other 350,000+ people. 

The goods: 
-The largest rave in America stretched out approx. 1.5-2 miles apart with over 350,000+ attendees. Holy. 
-Spectacular decors and stage set ups. I loved the Kinetic Field set up the most! That celestial castle mimicked Little Mermaid's castle of gold or Disney's Sleeping Beauty castle or some form of cathedral structure! Very remarkable and incredible. THE LIGHT INSTALLATIONS ARE PHENOMENAL! Now I can understand why Insomniac spent over $35 million dollars+ toward the productions. 
-It goes from dusk to sunrise. 
-Free water, but the line can be cruel-some. Stay hydrated please!
-65+ carnival rides are fun to ride with your friends and make good memories. 
-The artists! Hardwell, Tiesto, Calvin Harris, Dash, Avicii, Kaskade, Carnage, Alesso, and all of the biggest EDM DJs you know. 
-You'll meet some of the friendliest people on the planet. I got to PLUR with some of amazing new friends! 
-THE FIREWORKS. 

-The bads: 
-Beer is overpriced.. $8 for a can of Budlight? 
-No cell signal, so don't rely on catching receptions. Bring some walkie talkies.
-Parking. It's the worst when trying to get out of Speedway. 
-Traffic. It takes minimum of 45 minutes to 4 hours to get to the carnival from the Strip. 
-Running out of toilet papers in the rest rooms, so bring some for yourself. 

All in all, I had the best experience with friends I will forever cherish! This is something everyone in their 20s should experience once in their lifetime.

Thank you Pasquale Rotella, CEO and Founder of Insomniac Productions, for making this happen every year. It was literally the BEST WEEKEND OF MY LIFE surrounded with good and positive vibes. Rolling bowling balls. Awesome kandis. Oh my gawd, awesome DJs. PLUR. Sleep is for the weak. #insomiac. EAT SLEEP RAVE REPEAT!

See you next year under the electric sky!

Okay, while I love Chris and I love his product I despise their group reservation policy. We called weeks ago for a reservation for 9 towards the end of May, they told me that we need to call one month to the date at 5 o'clock.. so today that call was made at 5 o'clock, the stupid matter of factly bitch told me that the reservations were gone at 4:30.. okay, if you're going to fuck around with the way you do things that's one thing, but being a dumb bitch about it is completely another. 

I think I'm finally over my love for this place.. I mean 3 weeks ago we showed up and was told the wait was 4.5 hours.. I don't wait that long for pizza.. while his pizza is great, its just fucking pizza.

Advice: get a bigger place!!

This used to be called "The Gift of Lights" at Sunset Park, but has a new name and home. The now "Glittering Lights" at Las Vegas Motor Speedway was fun and free for a 2nd year thanks to yelp. There were a lot more cars this year compared to last year. It seemed like there were a few more lights up this year, but pretty much the same light displays just put up in a different spot. The difference I notice here at the speedway vs. susnet park is there is a lot more space for lights. I just wish they filled it all up! It's too bad more businesses don't get involved and set up a light display where it's dark. There is a sign at the gate telling you which radio station you can listen to while you drive through. I enjoyed munching on popcorn and hot chocolate that were for sale by the Boy Scouts at the entrance and seeing all the pretty lights :)

Move. the. hell. over, Earl of Sandwich. I found a new late-night lover and it's NY style pizza in Vegas. 

My girlfriend raved about this place, while I rolled my eyes and insisted we go to Earl instead. She convinced me and we walked on over after a long night at the Marquee (both conveniently located in the Cosmo) and we were all speechless after our first bite. 

We ordered a combo of white cheese, sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms. I've never been a HUGE fan of pizza, but this thin, wide slice was simple and flawless.

I've been awaiting a great eatery to replace the now defunct Chandler BBQ Company, and the wait was worth it.

I've had both the meat tortellini with bolognese and the marscapone with butternut squash ravioli, both made from scratch, both delightful.  I have huge expectations for their artichoke parmesan.  The restaurant does have a Facebook page when you can come and get a little extra info.  It's quaint and cute on the inside (seats 16) and they have a nice sized outdoor patio with ample seating, for al fresco dining.

The chef, Carlo, is friendly and excited for you to try his creations.  They have a chalkboard menu behind the counter, where you'll place your order, and a deli case with meats, cheeses and olives... soon to include desserts.

They offer hot and cold sandwiches, salads, pasta (with your choice of six sauces), and a few side dishes.  The beverage options include a fountain station.

Stop by for lunch or dinner.  Stay for the ambiance or get it to-go!

The Showroom is located at 951 Wigwam Pkwy Henderson, NV. That's just off of 215 and the Gibson exit. Its kinda hard to find if you're not paying attention.

The showroom is really well setup and they have rocks and more rocks. flagstone, stones, gravel, soils and just about any landscape design info you could need. Way better than big box stores as they're locally owned and know the desert landscape and the best options.

Plus you can go to their website and see lots of rock examples and measuring tech info. Also they have a sister company that is Nevada outdoor Living with BBQ island and equipment, higher end patio furniture, waterfalls, statues, fire pits and more.
 
Prices seem high on the patio items and BBQ options but they mostly high end quality stuff that costs a little more. We got a deal on a small set and were happy. The rock options for the yard are still in the making but the prices are right and they deliver.

Staff was friendly and very helpful.

You will get a bunch of good ideas for your landscape dreams. Go in and check it out.

I vividly remember my first bite of their red velvet cupcake 8 years ago at their Beverly Hills location.  I'd never had cupcake like that before or since.  There have been copycats sneaking their way into Las Vegas over the years with mixed results and never living up to Sprinkles for me.  They finally made it and I am psyched!  

Yeah so 6 cupcakes costs $22.50.  I was surprised when the cashier asked me if those were for here or to go but then I saw a guy with 6 of them at a table by himself.  Damn, dude.

We ordered 3 red velvet, a peanut butter chip, lemon meringue and black & white.  Those other 3 were nice and all but it's all about the red velvet.  The cake was perfectly moist and the frosting is like no other.  Funny how they put the takeout box into a resealable plastic bag...like drugs.  I am sure Sprinkles is well aware of their addictive qualities.

Even the line on Sunday at 11pm was about 15 minutes.  Looking forward to giving the cupcake ATM a whirl when the line is an hour plus.

Ladiessssssss....hold tight to those purses!

If you're a woman standing on the dance floor with a purse, you're a target. There's some kind of crime ring happening that can ruin an entire Vegas trip if they get their hands on too many personal items. They appear to be pick pocketing cell phones and if they can wiggle a wallet out while they're at it, game on. A handful of girls in our group noticed their cell phones were missing about an hour into the night and once those of us that still had ours started flashing the ground to see if we could find them, ladies dancing around us jumped in announcing that their cell phones had been swiped, too.

Sadly Hakkasan's security guys couldn't do anything about it, because their job is to keep the fire lanes clear and keep bottle service VIPs away from the commoners. It's a shame because if they had just put a few more security guards on the dance floor after the many complaints we sent their way about the situation, some people could have been safe from the thievery.

Losing your phone or ID on a Vegas weekend is probably one of the worst scenarios you can think of because your whole life is put on hold and you have to jump through hoops (while on vacation) to get everything back in order.

Props to securing kick ass DJs and the unlimited confetti budget, but there's a serious issue taking place under Hakkasan's roof that needs to be addressed. And fast.

Caribbean, mon!
Some water in the desert.
Get the chili dog!

Dillon's is a chain down in Arizona.  BBQ is their specialty.  Kind of like the Famous Dave's of the Southwest.  Have been to the Glendale location in the past.  Solid.  This place brings it to another level.  Situated on Lake Pleasant, just outside of old timers land in NW Phoenix burbs. 

They have a vernicular to get you down to the Lake? How cool is that? I am sure that I will appreciate that in my later ages when I retire down there in my golden years.  Look at the old guy getting busy!:

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dillons-morristown?select=wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqA#wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqA

Anyways, their chili dog is out of this world.  See my picture.  Comes on a hamburger bun with two sliced dogs, topped with cheese and jalapenos and BBQ pulled pork.  Just died and went to heaven.  Gives the Gopher Bar a run for its money. 4.99999!

= = = = = =  DAILY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =

Yay, happiness is a new Buffet!     :-))

So I stopped in to this little place today & found a smallish 17-item Buffet, counting salad items but not sauces & dressings.

Lunch started with some piping hot, THIN Garlic Naan brought to the table.  Loved it!!  Then it was on to salad with Raita dressing, Curried Chicken with bone, Tandoori Chicken, Yellow Dhal, Butter Chicken, Vegetable Korma, Aloo Mutar, Channa Masala, Basmati Rice, & a rice dessert that I failed to write down the name of.

It was a little cold in there and the bathroom was out of paper towels but the dining room is nice, the service was friendly & all of the food delicious!  Good pricing too, at $7.99.     :-)

It really pains me to give this place a two star rating. The owner and the staff are really nice people but my emotions from this place has ranged from not bad to this sucks over the last few visits.

The last time I was there my burger and fries were gnarly bad. The fries were not cooked and tasted like oil and the burger had me thinking what was I thinking by coming here for lunch. Well at least I got a free soda by checking in on Yelp.

As painful as it may sound, even hippies must retire one day.

Picture it, three Asian dudes and one Midwest white dude who never acquired a taste for "Asian" food.

"I'll order for everyone OK?" says my bud, fluent in Cantonese.  Mutterings of indifference. A few minutes later steaming bowls filled with chewy, thin egg noodles and flavorful broth arrive, a generous portion of well braised beef brisket, soft gelatinous tendons, earth tripe, chewy pig ears, airy fish balls, shrimp filled won tons and flavorful mushrooms weighing everything down.

Chopsticks in hand we all dig in.  My Midwest bud, holding his fork, looking like someone stole Christmas exclaims "why couldn't we eat that", pointing at the table with a plate of roast pork.

The waitress answers for us "You eat first.  Good for you.  I bring after you finish".  

To his credit he made it through the noodles and devoured the Chinese BBQ that followed.  Were talking a succulent roast duck with very little subcutaneous fat, the juicy meat permeated by star anise and bathed in its own juices and pured innards; moist, salty roast pork with a golden, blistered crisp crackling skin, and a deeply flavored char siu, moist, some burnt bits for bitterness, sweet with a delicate fermented aftertaste.

Sure, the roast pork and char siu was a little lean but  this is health conscious 2013.

Very inexpensive noodles and rice plates (roasted meats, duck, chicken over rice with choy sum).  BBQ items sold by the pound, roast duck by the whole or half.

Good eats for sure.

Compendium is a new show at Planet Hollywood in which musicians pay tribute to legendary bands featuring live music, multimedia and acting during breaks in sets/costume changes. 

The first band they're paying tribute to is none other than KISS so when I heard that I was all about it. One of my friends who came to town is a huge KISS fan. I arranged to take him along with some other friends to see the show. My entire party had a rockin' good time!

The Sin City Theater at Planet Hollywood is on the smaller side but it makes for a more intimate show. Seating was comfortable and waitresses bring drinks directly to your table. As far as I could tell, there wasn't a bad seat in the house.

Some of the classics played were "Calling Dr. Love", "I Was Made for Lovin' You", "New York Groove", "Lick It Up", "Shout It Out Loud" and "Rock and Roll All Nite".

Luis Reyes does an amazing job as Gene Simmons! That tongue... geez! I was the lucky recipient of a guitar pick from him when he threw it to me. Thanks Luis!

At the end of the show, the band stayed out on the red carpet to take photos with fans which I thought was a really nice touch. The entire band was very personable and friendly.

You can see the Sin City KISS show now through June 30th. Tickets are available on Ticketmaster here:

http://www.ticketmaster.com/Compendium-tickets/artist/1996989

The next band featured will be U2 starting July 3rd.

I've only been here for lunch but based on some reviews regarding breakfast I may be missing something.

The first time I went in here I was kind of overwhelmed by all the choices. It didn't make it any easier trying to decipher the menu plastered above the grill area, that was kind of awkward. I'm not certain if they have a paper menu.

I struck up a conversation with a regular and he pointed me to the Gyros special. I ordered that and didn't really dig it too much. The next trip I tried the pastrami and was not too impressed. Both meals BTW, were ginormous. Next, I said to myself if this was an IQ Test and you had to choose something from a place that was called the BURGER Factory what should you choose? Burger, dummy. Yes, I tried a burger the next time through and liked it. So I would rate the burgers a 4 and the rest of the stuff a 2 to average out to a 3 star rating for the total body of work.

Also, they take credit cards. So this is not a cash only place.

Well it's another weekend and another Sam Fox Concept restaurant to try.  Life is so boring here in the Valley.  LOL

There have been quite a few "premium priced" burger places popping up lately.  So, in many ways Zinburger's only competition in this category has been Hopdoddy. Both are upscale $10 plus burger places, that have interesting choices of tastes, add-ons, buns, etcetera. 

The food at Zinburger is very good. It's served fast and you won't feel like your wallet took a major hit. Our bill came to $33.00 before taxes and gratuities, which is expensive when only compared to the "In 'n Out" and "Habit Burger" of the world. But for us, it's the Zinburger's taste which we feel is unique and worthy of their premium price that makes us want to come back and we will. 

We tried their Kobe Burger ($15.00), Sam Burger ($11.00) and Zucchini fries ($7.00) and blown away the experience. The Sam had applewood smoked bacon, cheese and 1000 island dressing, which all worked well together. But the star was the Kobe, which is served simply with cheddar cheese, mushrooms and mayonnaise.  You have to try it, it's delicious. Really!

Enjoy!

Hubby and I got suckered into a presentation for thei Westgate Vacation Club while on vacation in Las Vegas last week.  We got free dinner and a show for our 2hours of time.  

All in all the presentation was good, the condo units seem pretty nice, and the idea is a great one for people who want to travel more.  

However we do not make any snap decisions and told the sales people that, well you would have thought the world was ending....all of a sudden the higher up sales person accuses us of not being truthful with them, of not making sense since we want to go on more vacations and wanting to spend more time with family....why would we not want to buy into their vacation club....we had to suffer through 2 other sales people and say NO like 10 times before they would let us leave.   

It was more stressful that it should have been....and after being treated that way will never buy anything from Westgate Resorts...  You just don't treat people like that.

This is my favorite Fox Concept restaurant.  I couldn't believe it.  The place is beautiful and so far the food we have tasted has been amazing.  My husband cannot get enough of the Korean skirt steak.  I took a few bites and I almost wanted to order that.  I rather save my calories for the drinks and dessert.  The Fig and Ginger mule is my favorite, specially when Tanner makes it, although Christina did a really good job also.  I cannot have enough of the Croissant Bread Pudding, it is a diet buster, but so worth it.  Next time I am going to have the salmon appetizer, the person sitting next to us at the bar recommended it highly.  It looked delicious.

People say that variety is the spice for life. I couldn't agree more so that's why I ventured out to Cafe Zupas from my normal rotation.

I decided to get a large make your own salad along with a soda for $9.29 (inclusive of tax). They give you plenty of mixed greens and about four ingredients on the salad. I could probably fit all the ingredients that they gave me on a hot dog. If you stick out your hand and look at your ring finger and pinky that would have been about the volume of chicken in the salad. I may have gotten somewhere between a 1/3 to 1/2 of a hard boiled egg as well. They chop up the cucumber and tomatoes very fine. Maybe a couple of teaspoons of each ingredient.

It's safe to say that I won't be fooled again.  At least I enjoyed this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1QtO2KYwVE   (start at 1:14).

Hi. My name is Drew and I have lactose intolerance. Why should you care? Bc I NEVER eat ice cream or gelato... besides AOF. Given, the above statement means I don't have much experience judging gelato, I still think it means a lot that I roll the dice to eat the lovely creamy goodness from AOF. 

From my first time here, a blind tasting, to subsequent visits ordering specialties like cinnamon toast crunch and blueberry pancake, I always leave wanting more. The price is right. The owners are on hand and friendly. What else can you ask for? Then again, I can see how it can be hit or miss, bc your fave flavor from last time might not be there on your next visit, but I've always found a nice substitute. Do it.

When you're far from home, the minute you see a familiar face out in that huge sea of people, you instantly smile. That's how I feel everytime I see the Hawaiian Air Las Vegas ohana... They have that island style spirit that our Hawaii is so famous for. You can tell that they miss home too, in the islands and for them, like us, it's nice to see familiar faces. Hawaiian Airlines has always been my go to carrier when traveling to the west coast and Vegas. They've since moved operations from the old International terminal and now operate out of the new Terminal 3, D concourse. Access by a high speed tram is so easy. The new digs also offer us travelers access to new shops, concessions and yes, slot machines! But getting back to our Hawaiian ohana, it helps to have friendly staff with the Aloha spirit since a lot of times we as travelers need assistance at the gates, etc. I have never felt guilty of like I was bothering any of them whenever I had a question or concern about something. Traveling can be intimidating for some, confusing to others and just downright unpleasant. It sure helps when you have a friendly face to talk to at the beginning of a long journey home and a smile. That alone will cure your anxieties! Keep up the good work Hawaiian!

Oh, and btw, be sure to download the Hawaiian Air app if you have a smartphone, it's so convenient and easy to use. Check in, change seats, upgrade, do it all from the app! You'll never be scrambling to find a computer anymore!

If you want to experience the REAL Vegas, go north on the Strip til you pass the Stratosphere. That's when the REAL fun starts: strip clubs, porn stores, pawn shops and derelicts! Don't be a puss -- check it out!

The jewel of this portion of LV Blvd is Showgirl Video, an adult store with a moderate-to-severe case of the grunge. Bare concrete floors, rack and racks of DVDs with titles like "German Piss-Orgy," dirty magazines and an assortment of dildos, dongs and pocket pussies to enjoy them with.

The walls are lined with ass- and tit-imprints from some of the world's biggest names in porn -- just like at Hollywood's Chinese Theater! Even better, in the back of the store, you can pay $1 to go through a turnstile to a little peepshow area. A marquee shows you who's dancing today -- usually about 4 different girls. Then enter a booth, insert $5, and the shade goes up to reveal who's on duty at that particular moment. It's like a crapshoot -- will it be a scabrous Russian? A meth-addled Floridian?? You never know at Showgirl!!

If the girl really turns your crank, you can pay extra and take her down the hall to the Private Peep area: a series of little booths where she will dance for your eyes only. A menu is posted out front: "Anal $60, Anal w/toy $80," etc. It's a riot!

All in all, a truly unforgettable experience. And, girls -- if you're down on your luck, they'll let ANYONE dance here...even just for a day or two. On my visit, the manager told me about these two co-eds from Colorado on Spring Break, who had lost all their money gambling and needed to earn cash to get home. They wandered into Showgirl with their bikinis, and in three short days they had earned bus fare back to Denver.

This little parable tells me one of two things.. either the bus is a LOT more expensive than I remembered... or there ain't much money in peepshow dancing!!!

I can't help it that I'm addicted to sweet potatoes. So that's why I have been gravitating toward Boston Market lately. My two sides are always sweet potatoes, or should I say my main course is the sweet potatoes and the chicken is my side. The food is excellent, although sometimes the chicken can get a little scrawny looking.

My only complaint about this place is that I'm constantly approached by employees to either sign up with my email address or being asked how's my meal. Last time I was in there I was asked how's my meal twice by the same guy and then a manager came by and asked the same thing. I get the touchy feely customer service thing. But PLEASE, dial it down a bit.

This Swiss bakery has been my go-to spot for cakes and macarons. I first noticed this bakery on Yelp, and the owner makes everything from scratch with natural ingredients. Foot traffic is rare, and the interior encompasses large glass cases, tiled floor, and colorful chocolates and European pastries to fill out the dcor.

The quarter sheet Custard Cake ($29.98) came with soft spongy cake, custard, and airy textures with moderate sweetness. My friends raved about its light-tasting qualities and I really enjoyed it too. The website says the cake can feed 15-20 people, but I always have leftovers to share with others.

The quarter sheet Tiramisu ($29.98) came with good moisture and mascarpone flavor, but the consistency of the custard needed to be more refined. The overall flavor was borderline bland, and without rum this cake could use another anchor such as an aromatic coffee to render that special effect. It was a solid cake, but I have had better.

I absolutely loved their Macarons ($1.50). It all started with a crisp airy texture, followed by a soft chew and persistent flagrant ganache at the center. I have tried the Red Velvet, Pistachio, Chocolate Orange, Pumpkin Pie, Almond, Blueberry, and Coconut flavors. They were all striking, memorable, and the fruit flavors were particularly delectable. The textures and flavors on these Macarons were consistent on each of my previous visits. It never fails.

Each time the service was forward, efficient, and responsive. I find it helpful to communicate directly with the owner, as he is knowledgeable and always finds ways to meet my expectations. Eventually I'd like to order off the menu and try the Saint Honore Cake, Poppy Seed Bread, and other Macaron flavors.

I thought my 300th review should go to a special place.

This is one eye opening museum. One that will radioactively enlighten your day.

This is a branch of the Smithsonian Institution and like all the others this place is very thorough in letting you know the facts from multiple  perspectives. I did the self tour so I could take my time and soak in as much on this place as I could. I even met a Yelp friend Atom.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-atomic-testing-museum-las-vegas?select=sJt8qJbkCXpeFB_9vFhdHg#sJt8qJbkCXpeFB_9vFhdHg

The Museum kind of starts in reverse as the first display is one that shows the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan with a short premier of the A-bombs birth. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=DxttT6mA5FbF1agv35diAQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

You quickly move about the various displays that include to a milti-timeline table of the nuclear era that includes popular things like what the best TV show was, what was happening in Russia  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-atomic-testing-museum-las-vegas?select=oVbywp4289aavJ4pThd8Hg#FhcKP7e0Ueul1pLzHKiLGA  and what kind of nuclear testing was being done at that moment in time. A very interesting history lesson.  

There is a letter penned to the US government from Albert Einstein from 1939 (well before WWII) that discussed the future of nuclear science, power, medicine and weapons and the need for the government to secure however possible the raw materials (uranium) from places both local and abroad.

There are many cool displays from a working Geiger counter that you can use to sample display radioactive things that you'd never imagine are radioactive. I stuck my cell phone and guess what? Light radiation is emitted from a dumb phone. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-atomic-testing-museum-las-vegas?select=oVbywp4289aavJ4pThd8Hg#p23oO9CppodE_yTr8KQdzw

There are interactive displays and one of my favorites was the first theater where you got to feel a blast as if you were there.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=whzFsAV7dW1-ivMEOzJovQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw  This museum is rich with displays and physical / video / audio accounts of what it's like to be on the foreground of this nuclear testing facility  just outside of Las Vegas.

This is a really a historical tour of our nations past that you must have once. 5***** Stars
Additionally there is a display that I did not go to that details area 51 and all the mystery that surrounds it, heard it sucked so I didn't bother.

If you're a history buff and are a quasi-nerd like me you might just dig this place.

Stone Crabs ... We came to Joe's for the famous Stone Crabs ..., but they didn't have any. Why? Only Joe's knows. We should of left.

Unfortunately, Joe's was already our second choice of the night (after seeing the long line at Bacchanal) and we weren't going in search of a 3rd restaurant. We were hungry, so, let's eat at Joe's.

Luckily, the other food was pretty tasty. We started with some glasses of inexpensive Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon and a Colossal Lump Crab Cake ($17). I liked the big bits of crab that didn't require (or have) much other seasoning (4 stars). 

Equally, the Chilean Sea Bass with Miso Glaze & Bok Choy ($37) and 20 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye Steak ($53) were 4-star entrees. The sea bass was flaky and the miso subtle. Meanwhile, the juicy and tender rib eye was meaty despite not being an elite steak. As a side, we split a creamy Wild Mushroom Mac and Cheese ($11) that excited thanks to the mushrooms and disappointed with lame cheese (3 stars).

Sadly, the service was weak. We suffered long gaps between being seated, ordering, getting food, or service. We wanted to try the acclaimed Key Lime Pie, but chose to try a different place at the Forum Shops at Caesars rather than put up with the poor service.

Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab is famous in Miami for fantastic Stone Crabs and Key Lime Pie. We didn't get to try either. Instead, Joe's became a basic Joe Schmo steak and seafood chain with high prices for the average Joe.

This is a very impressive worship space, one which I was fortunate enough to visit just before it's consecration a few months ago. 

An LDS friend gave me a private grand tour and I came away very much amazed with all the work and effort put into this Temple. The only down side was my inability to take any pictures inside. 

For those who know me, I would have normally have taken a couple of dozen pictures. So I was somewhat disappointed that it wasn't allowed, per Mormon custom.  But it was something which I respected on my visit.

This is also one of the largest temples I've ever seen and the grounds are massive. Probably on a par with the one in Las Vegas. The only other LDS Temple I've been inside, is one back in Glenview, Illinois, which is tiny by comparisons. 

I left amazed and very impressed.

I dig faux vegetarian meats and Veggie House exceeded all my expectations.  My buddy reluctantly agreed to meet here for dinner since I am pretending to be vegetarian for the month.  It's a good thing we got here a little before 6pm on a Tuesday because every table was taken in 30 minutes with even more people waiting to be seated.  I can't think of another 2nd floor plaza restaurant doing business this brisk except for Ichiza.  Good for them!

General Tso's (or Tzo or Tsao or Zao or whateverthefuck) chicken was as close as you could get to the real deal and the unanimous favorite dish.  We annihilated it.  We also got the Mongolian beef which was gluten/tofu heaven and the spicy, crispy eggplant was deeeeeelightful.  

I also had the honor of esteemed Yelper, Tony T, stopping by to say hello.  He said he preferred the seafood dishes over the others.  That kind of surprised me for some reason but I will definitely go for some of those next time.  How does one make vegetarian scallop in the first place?

This is Chinese vegetarian heaven!  They even do ramen for chrissakes!

My favorite part of Vegas - right here.

Sure it's nice to walk around in the daytime, but it's better in the night. Why? Because that's when everything is completely lit up! Keep those cameras handy when you're walking around here. You can even take some pictures of certain areas of the strip when you're walking on the "overhead" crosswalks. It's not just the lights to enjoy, but also some of the free shows that are available, including Mirage's Volcano and Bellagio's Dancing Water Fountains.

Be mindful of your surroundings when walking around, especially in the night. Sure it's touristy, but as what some other reviewers pointed out, there were some sketchy people hanging around (panhandlers, con artists, etc.). For this reason, I take away one star.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely be back here!

Frost Bites Shavery and relief.  Within minutes cup in hand.  Scoop one, light, fluffy, COLD, ahhhh.  Scoop two, body temperature falling, I'm forgetting I'm still wearing a hoody.  Scoop three; NOOOOO, it's melting!!!

This is good stuff.  Hawaii yeeps, think Frostcity on steroids.  Ribbons of fluffy goodness are shaved  from blocks of highly concentrated. naturally flavored ice.  Light, fluffy, delicious for the first two or three scoops then the texture changes it quickly becomes wet and "mushy", the sweetness becomes cloying.  Stick to the smallest size.  You can always get another.  (went back four times in one visit.  Scoop, scoop, toss, order, scoop, scoop, toss... Things we do for yelp)  

Flavors are strong and delish while the ice stays ice.  Vanilla (cloying sweetness), mango (floral, intense, cloying finish), green tea (bitter sweet tea flavor, best once melted), black sesame (nice sesame aroma, different, cloying finish).

Toppings are akin to a froyo bar, ie big chunks of fruits, nuts, crackers, candy, and cookies.  They detract and overpower the ice.  Too much crunch or texture and flavor.  

Inexpensive ranging from $2.25 to $6.25 for a family size cup.

Very good but more of a sweet treat than a chilling refresher (I guess that's why we have beer).

I was warned by my friends not to come here :( But I ignored their advice and I woefully regret it... Le Village Buffet is THEE spot that my cousins and I would bust a mission to go to when I was little. I have so many good memories of this place and I really wanted to come back here to revisit those pleasant memories... Well... those are nothing more than illusions of grandeur and definitely the failures of romanticizing about the past. 

I came here alone for breakfast when my friends were all sleeping and recovering from our nighttime adventures. I remember it was really cheap, about $20-something for the breakfast buffet. The people were very nice and accommodating... 

BUT THE FOOD!!!!! 

Bleh, the plate I grabbed was so horrible I had to cut up and re-arrange the food on my plate to make it look like I actually touched it so the lady would take it away. 

I liked their eggs florentine, the ham the grapefruit, the fruits and the orange juice... but quiche was too oily, the selection of scrambled eggs were disappointing and the steak and potatoes were overcooked. The crepe was "okay" but the bananas were too soggy, I just brushed it aside and ate the outside part with the nutella. I didn't even want to eat the breakfast pastries... it was just chocolate croissants, muffins, danish, cinnabuns, etc... nothing special or out of the ordinary... 

This experience does not even come close to how AMAZING I remember Le Village Buffet to be... Definitely not worth stuffing my face for :(

"What would you do if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key."-"With A Little Help From My Friends", Beatles

Beatles LOVE, with seating in the round, so not a bad seat in the house.  It's been showcased on the Strip for a long time now, and still draws the crowds nightly.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?select=z2BQr5kmAM5La12sRzvQSg#z2BQr5kmAM5La12sRzvQSg

We used Tix4Tonight to score some primo seats for cheap.  There's a part of the act where a surpise is brought out to the audience and we happened to be the very last row to participate.  I won't spoil it, but it was fun!

Pre-show, some clowns put on some comic relief by, literally, blowing smoke up people's arses.  Kinda creepy, kinda funny - it was great seeing people's reactions.

The highlights of Beatles LOVE, for me, were the aerialist during "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" & the act featuring "Strawberry Fields Forever".  Very touching.  I didn't care much for the halfpipes and rollerbladers.  Oh, and the music is on blast!  I'm talking loud!  So, just be mindful of that, if you have sensitive hearing.

Overall, a great show worth the money & time while in Vegas!  I highly recommend using Tix4Tonight for purchasing tickets the day before/day of.  Our seats were great & we saved a lot of money.  I'm generally not a Cirque du Soleil fan, but I highly enjoyed this eclectic & colorful show.

Vegas' top sushi restaurant.

NOT an AYCE joint.  ZERO Americanized rolls.  PURE Edo style sushi.  

Before all my sushi loving yeeps book the trip; meaning no disrespect to the Vegas food scene, Kabuto is the best in Vegas, but does not come close to touching the perfection that is the two Michelin star Urasawa in LA.  Granted, it does not come close to the $500 per person price tag of Urasawa either.

Rambling food history lesson:  This is classic  Edo style sushi born from necessity (no refrigeration in the early 19th century).  Large fillets of fish (toro) wont spoil as fast at room temperature like small fish (saba) with their bacteria filled intestines or turn rancid from their oxidizing fat (ie anago).  Yummy thoughts.  So, big fish = raw, small fish = marinated, oily fish = cooked.  Most are brushed in shoyu  and include wasabi, to inhibit spoilage.

Culinary artistry / craziness has taken over and the humble street food is now served in minimalist zen surroundings,  beautifully sauced and presented the way the chef feels it should be.  Its considered disrespectful for the diner to alter the sushi.

Although you can order individual sushi, the omakase ($80) or nigiri sampler ($48) is the best way to experience the ideal progression of flavors.

Selections change daily depending on availability.  The seafood is sourced globally.  All extremely fresh.  The chu-toro and o-toro correctly graded and a fatty delight.  The giant clam and ama ebi cloyingly sweet with the perfect oceanic finish.  Firm texture.  The list goes on and on.

Very good quality, delicately seasoned, short grain rice.  Nice compaction, holding its form but not breaking the individual grains.  

For all its refinement, this is one bite finger food (don't expect pieces of fish so large it slides down your throat and sticks out of your mouth at the same time). Toss the chopsticks aside and dive right in!

Highly recommended.

Pomo Phoenix is near perfect in every way. 

We came here last weekend before a play at Herberger Theater and it reminded us sooo much of their original on Scottsdale Road. Great ambiance, with the owner hovering around, making sure everyone was having a good time. Nice!

We started off with some bruschetta and plate of Carpaccio. Both were delicious. We shared a Regina Margarita and it just took us back to their old location. Wonderful. 

They say you cannot go back, well this Pomo's is pretty darn close to the original. Four and a half Stars rounded up to Five. Expect to pay $45 for two, including taxes but not gratuities. 

Enjoy!!

This is a nice stop for a sweet treat. You can go inside or they have a drive-thru. The girl at the register was friendly and helpful with the going over the menu and their popular items. I had a "Dole Whip Float" priced at $4.50 for a medium. It soft-serve pineapple with pineapple juice and whip cream. Yum! If you are a pineapple lover then this is for you! It was a nice treat and I will try the next one with orange juice instead just to see what it is like. They have other items on the menu like broaster chicken, sandwiches, salads, coffee and a kids menu. I have found a new stop on my way back to Vegas!

If you LOVE TO SHOP, this is pretty much a MUST STOP for you. But if you're like me who would rather gamble and eat in vegas than spend hours in a mall, this place is pretty intimidating. If it wasn't for the goal of finding Vosges chocolates at the most furthest point possible from where we were, i would rather be taking a nap with those men waiting for their women on the benches. The bad thing about this place, is if ur not interested in most of the stores, to get to one end to the other, you pretty much have to go through all the same stores you just passed, to get back if you want to stay out of the sun. I was looking for a secret passageway that would just transport me back to the casino (cuz i can walk miles through a casino if i wanted) but i couldn't find one. And that "show" is a bit creepy- u know what im talking about!

I give 4 stars though for housing Max Brenner Chocolate Heaven. 
Next time, i have to walk through this place, My first stop will be to get my Chocolate cookie from Max Brenner to make the backtracking more bearable and find Payard Patisserie.

Sadly, my knowledge of Greek food comes from My Big Fat Greek Wedding and a killer hangover from a few too many shots of cheap ouzo and pine sap Retsina to wash down "Greek" takeout in Hawaii. 

With those credentials to back me, here goes.  The Great Greek makes very good, tasty Greek food.  Simply put, proteins are juicy and properly cooked, breads are fresh, everything is flavored with fresh herbs and well seasoned.  

Dolmades (grape leaves stuffed with rice dill and other herbs) a real surprise.  Dense, moist and herbaceous, the leaves so tender you can eat them.

Lamb and beef gyro and grilled chicken gyro are real standout.  Juicy, well seasoned, sliced beef and lamb or chunks of chicken , atop simple veg, bathed in a zesty tzaziki, piled with a tart goat milk ricotta all enveloped by a fresh, warm, fluffy pita.

Grilled steak souvlaki, no complaints.  Deeply flavored, juicy tenderloin on skewers over a fluffy rice pilaf.  A squeeze of fresh lemon to brighten up the dish.   Done.  

Finally, desert; baklava.  What's not to love, flaky filo, butter, sugar, walnuts, cinnamon all bathed in honey.

Friendly counter service.  Clean dining area.  Reasonable prices.

Poker Pro Tip:  Give a bud who lives in the area a ride to the WSOP. On the way stop for lunch.  For days after "hey, you want me to stop at that Greek place and get you something?"  Heck yeah!

Ponder if you must, is the food so good because it's different from our norm or is it the difference from its norm that makes it delicious?  It's all Greek to me.

JERK!  

Yes, the flavor of Jamaica. It's in 30 percent of the menu.  That said, what's a group of hungry, foodie poker grinders to do?  Order every "jerk" dish of course.

Side note:  this is not a Jamaican restaurant rather a contemporary neighborhood bistro.  Large portions, good prices, and friendly off Strip service.  Hits and misses on flavor and preparation but overall a great value.

The jerk seasoning, a good spice blend with pronounced allspice flavor that lacks the fiery scotch bonnet peppers heat and floral pepper taste.  Sadly it results in an earthy taste not often complimented by the other ingredients.

The run down:

Jerk oven roasted baby back ribs with grilled pineapple and a buttermilk ranch sauce - Tender but very earthy in flavor.  The pineapple provides much needed acidity.

Jerk fried calamari with a sweet chili glaze - Pass.  Oily, soggy, and a sticky mess.

Couscous salad with jerk seared ahi seasoned with a herbaceous pesto, heirloom tomatoes, goat cheese and a hint of truffle oil is refreshing but the fish is previously frozen.  All good, it's natural flavor is obliterated by the seasoning.

DW fried chicken with cornbread and a jerk cream gravy - Southern cooking taken a little too far south.  Jerk seasoning has a burnt, dirt taste once deep fried.  Flabby dish.

Jerk lamb chops - Excellent.  Cooked to temperature.  The jerk seasoning enhances the natural game and mineral flavor of the lamb.

Jerk filet - Very good.  Like the lamb, cooked to temperature while the seasoning enhances the mineral flavor of the beef.

Jerk chicken breast - Flavorful but slightly dry.  The orange glaze does not pair well.

Overall, a solid neighborhood bistro with a twist.

Ohhhh, Wow. 

What an absolute incredible experience, that you must visit to fully appreciate.  The time, the effort, the money, that went into creating this world class museum, makes the Musical Instrument Museum a must stop for anyone living, or visiting Phoenix. 

One of the great things that made our visit special, was the integrations of the high-tech head sets that activated whenever you approached a exhibit. It is similar, but slightly different to the ones found at The Getty in Los Angeles. 

Upstairs you will find a geographical, country by country musical instrument experience, with the largest being the United States. One of the helpful visual aids is the world map showing the countrys' location.  I don't care how knowledgable your geography may be, you'll be stumped more than once. 

Downstairs is devoted to individual musicians, such as John Lennon, Toby Keith, Elvis, The Police, Leonard Bernstein, Taylor Swift, Carlos Santana, Roy Orbison and much, much more.  They actually have Roy Orbison's hand written words (see photo) of Pretty Woman. Nice!  Let's face it, only at the MIM could you mention all those artists in one sentence.  If you are into guitars, the Fender exhibit is a must stop. 

Parking is free and Admission is only $18.00, an absolute steal. Expect to spend at least two hours plus upstairs and another two downstairs. The Caf Allegro at MIM is open from eleven until two.  Their self serve Caf is open during museum hours and serves Starbucks, soft drinks, beer, delicious cookies and some lighter fair. 

Trust me, whether you start upstairs or down, the Caf will look like a oasis from all that walking.

Enjoy!!

The Mecca.  The holiest of all things burger.  It's a west coast operation, so I only get the chance to In-N-Out once every few years (insert joke here).  But it never disappoints!

The menu is as simple as it gets - burger, cheeseburger, fries, drinks.  But don't let that fool you, there's nothing simple about it.  I'm guessing the most popular menu item is the Double-Double...two patties with two slices of cheese.  From there you can go off menu and order any kind of burger you want.  The first number is patties, the second is cheese slices.  Haven't had the chance to try a 4x4 yet, but that will be happening in the next few months.  Beyond that, you can also dabble in the secret menu and get your burger protein style (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun), or animal style (includes grilled onions and animal sauce).  It's impossible to go wrong.

French fries can also be ordered animal style, but the plain version is just as good.  One of each is even better.  And as far as milkshakes, you have to go with Neapolitan...a combo of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.

It's that simple, yet that perfect.

Located on the third floor by the pool table in the Cosmo, you'll find a long dark hallway flanked with vintage record covers leading to a small pizza joint serving freshly baked pizza pies. It's really no secret that the secret pizza puts out some of the best late night eats this side of the strip! But most importantly, if you're staying at the Cosmo, there's no need to trek out in inclement weather or battle the strip crowd for good grub either.  

Thankfully, on the late night I stumbled in, the line wasn't too obnoxiously long. Be warned, on certain nights when the Marquee or Chelsea has an event, you could be waiting for quite awhile for your slice, so plan accordingly! 

Overall, the pizzas are very tasty. Thinly sliced NYC style (for you to fold and eat)
with a variety of topping options. My personal favorites are the works and white pizzas. They've got loads of condiments like oregano, granulated garlic, cheese, chili flakes etc for you to customize your pies, well. 

Happy Eats!

Within my first hour at Beacher's, I saw:

- A woman with the biggest boobs I'd ever seen crush beer cans, a watermelon and 3 wooden boards with her massive chest.  
- Midgets attached to a harness flying over the club delivering bottles to tables 
- A girl puking into her friend's hand as they were sprinting out of the club (true friendship)
- To my shock and surprise, my wife being excited to see Pauly D (is it 2010 up in here?)
-Lots and lots of confetti

It's a club without a dance floor.  If you're not getting bottle service, you're kind of screwed since there isn't really anywhere to hang otherwise.  It basically turned into a sea of humanity around 1am.  The music was mainly 90's hip hop/R&B with some splashes of EDM.

So the DJ rocks out for about 15 minutes and then there's a "show" which ranges from midget wrestling to magic to a Pee Wee Herman impersonator and then it goes back to the DJ.  Most of the "shows" weren't that great.  I felt like most of them actually killed the momentum of the party.  Everyone is up on their feet jamming out to a fun tune, then they stop the music and everyone has to sit down to watch the show.  

I think people might have loved this stuff 10-12 years ago when Jeff Beacher first gained notoriety for his traveling band of freaks but not when Rose Rabbit Lie has stepped up this kind of game to a whole new level.  The midget bottle delivery was still damn funny though.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 36/100

Beautiful hotel! Probably the nicest one I had visited this weekend, other than THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. It was a vintage, regal and expensive look to it. I have not stayed here, but I was really impressed by my visit this past weekend and would love to return.

LOCATION:
Excellent. Right in the middle of the strip for easy access all over

EXTERIOR:
Beautiful. Especially the beautiful lake in the front which gives it a little bit of distance from the actual street

INTERIOR:
Like I said earlier - regal, fancy, stunning
Entryway has beautiful glass flowers all over the ceiling

SHOPS:
Not too many. Most were very high end stores such as Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Louis Vuitton, etc. More eye candy, but they definitely match the expensiveness of this hotel!

WHAT TO SEE:
Flowers in the entryway
Window shop in the expensive designer stores
Conservatory & botanical gardens (decorated every season!)
Jean Philippe patisserie - home to the "world's largest chocolate fountain"
The famous water fountains out front! Shows either every 15 or 30 min. depending on day/time

I would love to stay at the Bellagio if I could afford it. I think I was expecting the Paris hotel to look more along the lines of Bellagio. Kinda disappointed over there...BUT Bellagio was simply beautiful!

I read a Yelp talk thread that was singing the praises of Niccoli's Deli & Pizza a couple of months ago. So I decided to take the plunge after my office moved to CenPho.

This is a Mom & Pop place that's been around for over thirty years. I talked to the Mrs. for a couple of minutes explaining that I was the new kid in town. She explained the setup where you order and they call you if it's busy but will bring your meal to the table if they're not swamped with customers.

They don't have a soda machine. They sell individual cans. I ordered the meatball sub sandwich. The bread was really soft. They cut up the meat so you don't have your meatballs falling out of the bread like most meatball sandwiches. They have a lot of marinara sauce on the sandwich and it is piping hot. The ladies out there can probably only eat half of the sandwich, that's how big it is. I would say that it had to be one of the tastiest meatball sandwiches I have ever had.

I definitely will be a regular customer of Niccoli's.

Low expectations. That's what I had when we stopped to have a bite before a movie. Not a big fan of deep dish, we were delighted to see "flat bread" pizzas offered. The sausage pizza, while could have been crunchier, was quite good. Service was great considering our friend was so dehydrated from being overserved the previous evening, he must have had a dozen ice tea refills. 

The ambience at these places kills me. It's like Oregano's married Cracker Barrel! There is crap all over the walls. Hey. Who's dusting this stuff anyway. I did notice quite a bit of dust and grease on the light fixture above our table. 

We attempted to try the pizza place a few doors away, but they were closed. I suggested Hooter's but before I finished saying it, we all squealed in all of our gayness...."Ewww...boobies!". So Uno it was. 

But I couldn't help think of that card game Uno. Damn that's a fun game. And I also couldn't get a guy from high school outta my head. His nickname was Uno. He got it one day in the locker room after gym class. You figure it out. 

I'll go again if I'm ever at the AZ Center. I just might bring my Windex and Endust however.

Bryan's Black Mountain Barbeque is definitely at the top of the Barbeque Mountain in the Phoenix metro area. They have plenty of seating both inside and outside the restaurant.

This place is busy and for good reason. You line up and give your order and pay. They also have many different types of sodas, tea and lemonade housed in a giant dispenser where you program what you want via touch screen. They call out your name when your order is ready. 

I really like the brisket and have enjoyed the ribs as well. They have a station where the heated BBQ Sauce is dispensed from a dispenser similar to how you get your ketchup. They season their fries with a lot of salt/spices so ask for plain fries if you're not into the salty/spicy fries. Their beans are also mighty tasty if you decide to go in that direction.

I just wish this place was a lot closer to my house because I love climbing that BBQ Mountain.

I'd say the majority of Celine Dion music I've heard in life has been from dentist offices.  Needless to say, they aren't fond memories.  I clearly link "Because You Loved Me" to drilling sounds and a big light in my face.

But you have GOT to be dead inside if you don't feel something when she hits those big notes in tunes like "Power of Love" or "All By Myself" in a live setting. As a case in point, I heard a wife ask her husband what he thought of the show while exiting, and his answer was "eh".  He looked a shade under 139 years old!  Almost dead!

Not to say the show was all roses.  I found her version of "Live and Let Die" to be punchless and uninspiring.  Especially after seeing Axl's version multiple times a few weeks earlier.  

Glad I saw the show but no way in heck would I ever pay for this.  I sat stage left in the rear orchestra and a seat retailed for $175 before tax and service fees.  It's only worth it for big time fans.  Plenty of those were in attendance.  Watching people lose their minds to the "Titanic" song was very, very interesting.

A group of us came here for breakfast and really enjoyed D'lish.

We ordered their drip coffee and some bagels and found everything tasty.  The coffee was strong and HOT! If water boils at 212F, then D'lish serves it at 210F LOL  What was great about it?  It wasn't over roasted and burnt like the Green Mermaid.  Actually the three of us enjoyed our conversation waiting for it to cool.

The bagels were another surprise.  Given the small space of D'lish's building, I would love to find out where the get them.  My suspicion would be NY Bagel on Scottsdale Road, up near Shea Blvd.  But no matter, they were very good and hit the spot.

We'll be back for lunch.

I see why Amy Winehouse doesn't want to go back to Rehab - - 'cause I don't want to either.

That being said, I voluntarily chose to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel, and willingly signed up to attend the douchebag/dirtyskank party at Rehab last Sunday.  It reminded me of those Spring Break parties you see on MTV, where the girls are having tickle fights on platforms next to a big pool and vodka redbull drinks are served in plastic cups with big straws.

I freaked out a little when my pink sundress wouldn't fly and was forced to walk around in my string bikini...  BUT, nobody vomited at the sight of me, and since everyone was wasted, I suspect I looked pretty damn fine.  In fact, I think it's safe to say it doesn't matter what your body looks like, as long as your outfit and hair/makeup are well assembled.

Kudos to the lifeguard who jumped in and rescued me from the 12 foot deep end .  He couldn't see my head (it was underwater), but had noticed my Rehab Souvenir Drink Cup sticking out of the water (I paid $25 for that, I wasn't gonna let it drown with me).  He dragged me to the shallow end, where I wiped the mascara off my face and promptly headed back to the bar for a refill.

As hotel guests, we had our own entrance, which allowed for easy (and free) entry/re-entry - - and for convenient 6:30 pm scrambling to our room to pass out.   

Note: Watch out for photographers.  When I removed my bikini bottoms in my room, a sopping wet  "Spy on Las Vegas - view pictures here" business card fell out.   There go my political aspirations.

Whoa, I am in heaven. 

A recent review for a place in Chandler made me NEED some Filipino food. Let me back track a few years. 

I worked with a guy who was in charge of hiring for a drug wholesaler, he liked helping friends and family. He was a Polish Filipino. Some of the family he hired were Filipino and would bring Pancit, Lumpia, adobo etc to the potluck type lunches we had. I would even go to family functions with them. I love Filipino food. 

There was a place near me that closed down and I was left with no where to go. I drove past CFB but at the time it was only a bakery...lame 

After seeing the review for the place in Chandler, I had to find a closer place. SO I YELPED... sure enough there it was CFB. It is only 6 miles from work...sweet. 

I roll in and expect to see a dive but instead see a very clean, and larger then expected dining room. Attached was a bakery full of delights. 

I ordered the Pancit with chicken and veggies. It was freaking good. No soy or spicy sauce ALL the normal flavors. I also asked if I could sample some of the Lumpia and it was perfect, fresh, hot, and awesome. 

I will be back for some Adobo and some pastry's. 

They have karaoke on Friday, and a live band on Saturday. So you are warned.

The idea of paying for a self-wash seemed a little silly, but after trying it at home and making a big mess -- only to end up with the dog outside in the mud within minutes after the bathing, and leaving them so moist that a funky smell develops as they dry -- it became an obvious and worthwhile choice.

My first experience with self-wash, at a nearby competitor, was horrible, but my time at Wag&Wash was so much better.

The facility here is clean and fairly spacious.  The stainless steel tubs are sturdy, and the spray equipment and drains all worked well.  They had a rubber brush to use on the dog's fur while sudsing and washcloths available for cleaning ears, etc.

I did have a little trouble with the suction-cup-leash that was supposed to hold my 70 lb dog secured to the front side of the tub.  
It didn't.  
A wet dog jumping over the edge of a slippery wet stainless steel tub that's elevated several feet over a slippery wet tile floor is not a healthy combination for the poor dog, who pulled a "Bambi on ice" and comically (but i'm sure painfully) spread all four limbs out in all directions and landed face first on the floor.  I asked for a non-suction-cup leash and secured him to a bar at front of the tub afterwards, but damage done.

Just go with the basic wash; the pricing options for various extras aren't worth it.  Why pay an extra several dollars for a specific scent of shampoo, when there isn't a conditioner with the same scent, since the conditioner is what the dog ends up smelling like afterwards, not the shampoo?

The blow dryers were powerful enough to blow out not only the water, but lots of leftover hair.  Sometimes the nozzle end blew off the hose, but i'd rather have the blowers be too hard than too soft.

I feed rawmeatybones, so i didn't shop the food selection much, but the premium brands offered are expectedly pricey.  I did pick up a rubber brush for cheap de-furring.

I will be back to use my frequent washer card.

The return of A5 Japanese wagyu to Craftsteak.  A cause for celebration!

The restaurant remains one of the top steakhouses serving the absolute best quality steaks in Vegas.  Backed by a comfortable, contemporary  ambiance, massive wine list and the largest single malt scotch selection in Vegas; Craftsteak has it all.

Steakhouse standard starters.  Straight forward and correct.  The simple hand cut wagyu tartare sets the scene for what is about to come.  Very clean beefy flavor.  Simple.  Sublime.

To the steaks.  Three grades (USDA dry aged Prime, American wagyu, Japanese A5 wagyu).  All very well trimmed with the wagyu grades having no visible fat around the edges.  All very evenly seared with a well developed crust.  

The standard UDSA Prime dry aged New York as expected; tender, beefy, with a good umame finish.

The American wagyu; very tender.  Olive oil viscosity on the finish.  Mild but sweet beef flavor.  If you prefer denser cuts, opt for the 14oz New York or 14oz Rib.  For the deepest flavor, the flat iron or skirt.

Finally, the highest grade Japanese wagyu; A5.  This is a treat.  Large 8oz steaks.  Good beef flavor with no mineral undertones, velvety mouth feel, no cloying fat on the finish.  The rib cap is the most flavorful, followed by the New York strip, rib eye, then the fillet.  Price reflect the quality and rarity; $190 for the rib cap, $260 all others.

The 24 hour braised short rib is to die for.  Probably the bet example of braised perfection I've had.  The connective tissue melts in the mouth and the beef moist and not stringy.  Served perfectly glazed.  Win.

Sides compliment the steaks.  The standout, the assortment of mushrooms (shitake, French horn, hen of the woods, white beech).  Simply sauted.  The perfect blend to boost the umame finish of any steak.  

NOTE:  I've been asked why do I say 6-8oz of Japanese A4-A5 is a lot to eat.  Consider this about NY strip:

8 oz USDA Choice (probably sold in your local area):  aprox 600 cal/  45g fat, / 18g saturated fat
8 oz USDA Prime:  aprox 700 cal / 60g fat / 25g saturated fat
8 oz Japanese A5: 3x - 5x the fat of USDA Prime AND $260

Get it???

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 44/100

The boyfriend and I aren't big drinkers, so fraps at this Starbucks ended up being our first drinks when we first got to Vegas, LOL. This location is nice and big, well lit, and has TONS of seating. We went close to 10pm and they were still open pretty late (might be 24 hours, but I can't remember). 

I decided to try their new caramel flan frap, which was really good! Much better than the caramel frap or the creme brulee frap, IMO. The boyfriend got a peppermint mocha frap and his was great as well.

They only had two people working during the time we went, but they were very friendly asian women who worked with smiles on their faces :)

The only reason why I won't give this Starbucks 5 stars is because it is really expensive. However, all of the Starbucks in LV are much more expensive than normal Starbucks locations are. We got two tall sized fraps and it was over $11...kind of ridiculous.

Recognize the chef?  Bravo's Top Chef contestant, consulted for XXX, worked at world class YYY, Michelin Chef ZZZ says he's "the greatest thing since boiled chicken".  Celebrity chef or otherwise, food must speak for itself.

Dishes are artfully presented.  Portions are very small for the price.  Flavors run from boring to interesting to "delicious but" to bizarre.  Examples:

Watermelon salad with goat cheese, a classic, is very refreshing but could benefit from a drizzle of aged balsamic to boost sweetness and complexity.  The hint of wasabi does nothing.  The watermelon lacked the "in season" fruity goodness.  Boring.

Quinoa fried rice with sun dried pineapple and tofu is intriguing.  Good first bite but unless you are a quinoa lover, the texture of the and nutty flavor of the grain quickly becomes one dimensional.  The pineapple lacks the acidic punch to brighten the dish.  Interesting.

The roasted duck breast is delicious.  Perfectly cooked, mid rare.  Mineral duck flavors enhanced by the honey.  A great side of grilled baby bok choy to add bitterness and crunch.  Just be sure to scrape off the ridiculous addition of children's breakfast cereal.   Blood soaked Kix.  Really?  Delicious but.

Miso toffee ice cream.  Wait for it.... Disgusting.  The first bite is good,  but with each successive bite, the miso flavor builds to the point your brain tells you not to swallow.  Fermented ice cream.  Bizarre.

Very small selection of micro brews.  Nice selection of sake.  High off Strip prices.

Bottom line, the food is not for everyone.  There are many better options for more globally accepted creativity.  You're better off looking to the Strip for excellence.

Seriously good  Japanese comfort food (robata grill) combined with outstanding artistry.

For starters, agedashi tofu.  Sublime; fried house made tofu bathed in a heavenly flavored dashi base topped with briny salmon roe.

From the robata grill, Kurobuta pork cheeks (face, not butt, sweet porky goodness),  enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon (smoky richness), "Kobe" fillet with wasabi (tender, wasabi brings out a mineral earthiness and sweetness), "Kobe" skirt with garlic (razor thin slivers of garlic mixes with melting beef fat), and if they have it, teriyaki foie (orgasmic flavor explosion that goes on and on).

Finally, the kaiseki meals are incredible.  They feature small portions of the best of the robata grill mixed with delicacies not offered anywhere else on the menu.  Some of the dishes are out there.  One night offered sea snails another foie chawanmushi.  Both surprisingly delicious.  Keep an open mind.  The progression of courses in flavors, textures, and temperature is well thought out.  Well worth the $100 or $150.  

Note:  three day advance reservations required for the kaiseki and all members of your group need to order it.

Tip:  always ask if there are any off the menu specials.  Depending on how much they "like" you, you may be in for a real treat (sorry, it's an Asian thing).

Good selection of sake at all quality and price levels. 

Needless to say, highly recommended.

REVIEW #400.

Vegas' penultimate restaurant.  

Hailing from Michelin three star pedigree, Restaurant Guy Savoy Paris, earning two on it's own before the Guide abandoned the city, is an experience to savor.  Dishes are innovative but prepared in a classic style (no molecular gastronomy or modernist cuisine) showing classic French refinement and restraint.  The progression of courses near perfect with the memory of a flavor from the previous dish enhancing or contrasting playfully with the next.  Beautiful plating with every ingredient contributing to the dish.  The ambiance, contemporary elegant.  The service, flawless but not stuffy.  A true Michelin star experience.

Tip:  Opt for a multi course menu. 

The Innovation - Inspiration Menu ($348) is incredible.  Multiple amuses, ten innovative courses, and multiple desserts in a near perfect progression.  It features many of the signature dishes of the Paris restaurant including the incredible artichoke and black truffle soup.  Velvety smooth, rich from a touch of cream, brooding sweet vegetal flavor of artichokes perfumed by the unmistakable scent of shaved black truffle accented by shaved, aged parmesan.  A mushroom brioche spread with black truffle butter accompanies the soup.  Sensory overload.  Something more innovative?  Caviar with frozen celery root mousse.   A bite, the caviar flavor shines then a bite of the mousse, a hint of vegetal flavor then as the mousse thaws, an explosion of celery flavor that cleans the palette for the next bite.  Think drinking a frozen vodka shot.

Dishes and menus are seasonal.  Be on the lookout for the "prestige" menus.  The current black truffle prestige ($420), outstanding.  A truffle prepared in many variations that it never gets boring.  From being the featured ingredient of an acidic winter marche salad to a background note in a duck consomm, sublime.

Massive wine list with emphasis on France.  Very good vintage depth.  Very high Vegas resort pricing.  A cognac lounge features some of the rarest pours to be found including the 140 year aged Hardy Perfection and the ultra limited edition, Hennessy Ellipse.

Only pet peeve, the restaurant should prohibit the use of mobiles and the taking of photos.  There is nothing more irritating than flashes going off in the dining room as guest take photos of their plate.

A true foodie or balling out of control?  This place is for you.  Then again, if you consider a multi course menu in the Paris restaurant cost between 360 - 490 and the airfare another $6,500 ($1,000 supplement for Hawaii yeeps), you're getting 95 percent off.  What a bargain!!!

Fukuburger, Fuku so good!

Located inside FAME at the LINQ, Fukuburger offers innovative Asian-inspired burgers, fries and loco moco for those looking to tantalize the palate.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#k0iG_a95OyoEJpJz9Fumsg

When I saw the Tamago burger ($7.99), I knew I had to have it.  I'm an egg slut from way back.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#gr4jTA0IVQkD2Pw7J-Qd9w
Fuku-patty with furikake & teriyaki, finished with crispy onion rings & fried egg.  The first bite was like a rainbow shining down on me. Like Willy Wonka farted candy into the air.  Runny egg oozing over the delicious patty, the sweetness of the teriyaki married together with the crunch of the onion rings.  A fairly sized burger, I felt the pricepoint was a decent value, considering it is Vegas.  I relished each delicious bite.

Service was okay.  It took a while for my burger to be cooked, but I know it's made fresh to order so I can't complain.  There is bar seating directly in front, with tables insided & outside FAME.

Free jelly candy!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#DNzhAcLMgJFh-kOR8wLL_w

Fukuburger, I'm a big fan!  The Tamago burger was the real deal & one of the highlights, of many, from my trip to Vegas.  I hope you come back to SoCal so I can satisfy my cravings for your Asian-inspired delectables again!

Highly recommend!

Chiploplo, Chipoodle, Chipotopolay

Looking for a pre-show meal, we saw the nearby choices of A)McDonald's, B)Panda Express or C)Chipotle.  Considering I don't like McDonald's, Panda Express is on my usual restaurant rotation & I haven't had Chipotle in a few years, the time was ripe to give Chipotle another go.

My choice - the barbacoa bowl.  

My 2 cents - It was..........how do I put this?  Boring.  Boring like the scene in "Ferris Beuller's Day Off" where Ben Stein is going "Anyone..........?  Anyone.........? Beuller........?Beuller.........?"  Boring like having a CSPAN viewing party on Valentine's Day.  Nothing says "sexytime" than Senate hearings in HD;p

Now, it wasn't bad, per se.  It's just, as I get older, I want my tastebuds to be titillated!  (I just said "titillated" *giggle*)  The portions were good.  The price was reasonable.  Also, kudos to the staff for efficiently moving the big Las Vegas line along.  Wait was minimal.  To me, I'd rather go to a local taqueria for some authentic and cheap fare, w/o the line of hipsters, Beliebers and Twi-hards.  

Chipotle is situated in a primo location to lure in the tourists.  The restaurant was clean and the staff knows how to handle the crowds coming in for sustenance, like me.  

Chipotle has it's fans, and more power to them for liking what they like.  I may return if I'm walking by, the next time I'm in Vegas.  It's convenient and the prices are reasonable, considering the dining options in the casinos.

Booked the Penthouse and all i can say is....WOW!!!!

The panoramic view of the strip from the corner Penthouse was breathtaking and the spacious rooms were elegant, modern & clean.  The beds you ask? Nice and firm, just the way i like it! Flat screens in every room. What's next? the toilet? lol
Oh, and the fully automated shades and daily "turn down" service was pretty impressive, too!
  
Throughout my weekend stay, service was on point and the hotel staff didn't miss a beat.  Even on my last day, they provided complimentary limousine service to the airport!  Very swank.

My only complaint would be that my darn ears kept popping as I rapidly ascended the elevator to the 54th floor.  But hey the view from that soaring height was worth a few annoying pops in my ear and luckily after a couple of days, i adjusted ;)  

The spa at the hotel was also clean, contemporary and most importantly, relaxing. They had all the facilities i've come to expect from a fine resort hotel spa (i.e. TV lounge with refreshments, expansive fitness room, jacuzzi & whirlpool, steam room, and sauna.  

Located inside the newly built City Center, this smoke free & eco-friendly hotel is within walking distance to all the local hotspots, dining, and entertainment on the main strip.
If you're looking for a relaxing recovery after a night of complete decadence, this just might be your ticket to paradise.

Happy Times!

This is the busiest Walgreens I ever been to, there are good reason why.  First of is located in the Las Vegas Strip, it between Palazzo and Venetian.  Just next to the popular Tao Night Club.  This is the place to get you food, water and other important items restocked.  Eating and drinking is pricey in the Strip, you can save tons of money just shopped here, and just aware that most hotel in the strip does not had microwave or the fridge unless you got a suite type of room.

Price is slight higher than what you fight in most other Walgreen, but is understand since the high cost of the strip in general, even a foot long subway cost $10, but you still manage to find 99 cents Arizona Tea in here.   If you wanted to eat a nice buffet later of the day, this is good place to get you breakfast and late night snack fix without had to spend much.  Save those money can use more in party and gamble =)

Okay, I've been holding back on this one.

For three years I have been coming here dropping off my collared work shirts. Over that time, the wheels have started falling off this place  In my original review, I mentioned how management tries hard and when they goof, they try and fix it.  Let me give you two examples.

After writing my original review, four of my shirts started developing tiny holes on the back collar.  Pin size, all in the same place, right rear.  After a few cleanings, the holes became pencil size.  Well, I complained and was given a nearly two hundred dollar credit for the damage. They didn't replace the shirts. But I felt at the time an effort had been made to reach out and make amends.  Hence, my original Three Stars (now lowered to One).

A year later, after I replaced the shirts, my new ones started developing stress tears on the breast pockets. I thought, what the...#$&%!  So I pointed it out and they said I must be doing something to the pockets to cause the rip. 

They offered me a $85 credit toward future cleaning after damaging five shirts!!  I took the credit and decided to move on.  Not surprisingly, many of my co-worked have experienced similar problems. I feel for fellow Yelp friend Esther.  If they had damaged one of my suit...  well  Caveat emptor.

I say never again!

You can't say no to these amazing slabs of meat!

I ordered the **Steak Bordelaise** which is topped with caramelized onions and accompanied by frites. The steak is incredibly tender and melts in your mouth! The sweetness from the caramelized onions blended so well with the meaty juiciness. And I couldn't stop popping those frites in my mouth, one after another. They had the perfect texture: thin and crisp yet dense in flavor.

The **Paris Romance** cocktail, elegant and refreshing, is composed of Malibu Rum, Amaretto, a splash of pineapple juice, a dash of Grenadine, grapefruit juice, and some secret magic ingredients. Served in a chilled martini glass, it is the perfect accompaniment to such a fine-tuned meal.

The decor and ambiance reflect classy French charm, without being overbearing in the slightest. For dinner it was dimly lit and offered a warm comforting vibe. Service was flawless, although I have to say we made it pretty easy since we all knew we wanted steak and frites. 

You will definitely get the bang for your buck here. Upscale experience but at way more reasonable prices than many other restaurants in Las Vegas. Use your $$$ for going out later that night or hitting up the tables. :)

DATE TIP: Oui oui!

One of the most unique steakhouses in Vegas offering a rare culinary delight:  MONTHS aged dry aged beef.

Read on, I promise not to talk about what the process really is.

Called "Riserva", the once USDA prime beef is aged six to 11 months before being trimmed and served.  The result is unlike "younger", 30-75 day dry aged beef.  The shorter aged steaks retain a beefy texture, very tender with a pronounced nutty, bleu cheese aroma and flavor with a massive umame finish.  The months aged beef, think prosciutto.  Broiled rare to mid rare at a low temperature.  There is no thick outer crust.  The flavor is mild and nutty with only the hint of bleu cheese aroma.  The beef is dense and oily.  It has a very different mouth feel.  It is extremely sweet.  Amazing but not for everyone.

Tip:  Request the "Riserva" steaks when making reservation.  The amount of aging doesn't matter.  The piece is selected when it has reached the correct characteristics.

Traditional dry aged steaks are excellent.  The rib eye and porterhouse both possess the classic umame packed dry aged goodness.  Excellent sear, tender and juicy.  Both steaks are meant to be shared.  If dining alone, both the bone in New York strip and Bone in filet mignon offer the same experience as the porterhouse in a more manageable 16oz portion.

All steaks are rubbed with rosemary before cooking.  It imparts a strong, woodsy flavor that enhances the sweetness of the beef.

Not into aged beef?  The 20oz bone in veal chop is excellent.  Natural, pasture raised veal, it has a light beef flavor with a soft texture.  It's dry rubbed with thyme and porcini powder that imparts a very flavorful earthy goodness.  A drizzle of fresh olive oil adds the perfect richness.

For starters, the fried calamari, "Shrimp alla Diavola", and Bucatini Amatriciana are excellent but why fill up.  You can get these at Batali's Italian eatery, B&B Ristorante.

The restaurant captures the spirit of Italy, an enjoyable, casual, jovial evening.  Don't go with an elegant stick up your, you know.  The bread will make your hands oily and gnawing the bone is encouraged.

Bravo!

Bouchon is more than just breakfast.

"I'll buy dinner and the wine" says Lucas, my poker bud from France, "as long as it's French" then giggles.

"Ever heard of Thomas Keller?"  I remark.

"The dry cleaning guy?"  he quips in his thick French accent, as if the chef of one of the greatest restaurants in the US, the Michelin three star French Laundry, can't compare to the French.

"Bouchon it is but if you like the food, you pay the check and twice that to me in cold, hard cash".

"Book it" is the smug reply.

Truly French, baguette, chewy, expertly baked with a crisp crust.  It's required to carry the delicious "stuff" that is to follow:

(1) Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard - Velvety smooth with a clean foie taste, balanced saltiness and a kiss of Sauternes sweetness.

(2) Pate de Champagne; a country style pate akin to a finely ground head cheese.  Delicious tasty bits of this and that.  Perfect with grain mustard and cornichons that elevate it's natural sweetness.

(3) Rillettes aux Deux Saumons (a combination of fresh and smoked salmon rillettes, prepared in terrine and topped with a layer of clarified butter.  Rich, fatty, salty salmon bits begging to be spread on some crusty bread.

Finally the must have, Brandade de Morue ala Provencal.  Not the traditional whipped salt cod and olive oil, this interpretation is deep fried into crisp, light balls of goodness.  Incredible.

A nice selection of creamy goat, sheep, and cows milk cheeses finishes the meal.

Service is French casual and Vegas friendly.

Short but very well chosen French / domestic French style wine list.  $100 average bottle price with few selections below $65.

Oh yeah, "Pay up Frenchie".  He did; in Euros.  Ugh.

Try saying Bobby Q three times really fast in a southern accent. It sounds like you're saying Barbeque.

I can't believe that I've been living in this area for a few years and I just started patronizing Bobby Q's. There's definitely a happening vibe to this place after dark. The place is packed and the air is buzzing with conversations and laughter. They have ample seating inside and outside. We met some friends that have never been here a few weeks ago and they became instantly hooked.

We ordered steaks, pulled pork, ribs and brisket. Everything along with the sides were fabulous. My brisket was tender and the flavor instantly transported my taste buds to a happy place. The pulled pork was equally as good. I've had the ribs on other trips to Bobby Q and have always enjoyed them. I got a big thumbs up on the steak from my dining companion so I'm going to have to try that next time I'm in the house. The tab for four people without alcohol and before tip was $70. 

This is definitely my favorite BBQ place in the metro area.

I have eaten here a few times now and am surprised at how much I like it. I'm not a burger person, so I can't comment on that. The last two times I have ordered the "BLT" priced at $1.49 and can't believe how good it is for a fast food place. They aren't shy on the bacon and it tastes good. I also had a small order of their "Famous Seasoned Fries" priced at $1.69 and found them to be a bit crunchy and overcooked. Priced at 2 for a $1 the "Cinnamon Apple Pie" I had for dessert was a nice finishing touch. The employees here are friendly and they have a dual drive-thru. Even though the fries could use some work, fans of Checkers and Rally's shouldn't be disappointed with the cheap prices and food put out here.

This is one of my go-to Vietnamese restaurants in this area. It's located on the corner of an old strip mall with plenty of parking available. Once inside, the dcor includes tiled floors, black chairs, and sticky tables. Foot traffic is consistent throughout the day, and the bustling dynamic makes it a group and family friendly place to be.

The Pho Filet Dac Biet ($6.25) came with filet tenderloin, beef slices, beef brisket, tendon, and tripe. The broth came with complexity, with depth of beefy bone marrow and star anise, followed by emerging notes of onions, herbs, spices and a mix of fresh veggies. I always asked for the beef to come rare on the side. These thicker marbled cuts often came with a better chew with fantastic moisture. It's comfort food with a tasty spoon. I recommend it.

I also prefer the Pho Filet ($5.75) that came with slices of filet mignon tenderloin beef on the side, fresh plate of veggies, and heaping bowl of bone marrow soup. The broth has been consistent on every visit, and comparing to other Vietnamese restaurants, the beef slices captured all the elements I'm looking for in a good bowl of pho. 

The Pho Filet Tai Gan ($5.95) and Pho Filet Tai Xach ($5.95) were very good options too. They came with a good amount of beef tendon and tripe, respectively. I wished the tendon and tripe could appear in thicker chunks or slices, but these variations of toppings did provide additional elements to the greasy spoon.

Services were friendly, quick, and efficient. It is one of those no frills places where the thrill is in the comfort of the broth without highway robbery. Overall, I still believe the flavors could be more robust with thicker cuts of meat toppings. I'd be interested coming back to try their Bun Bo Hue.

I have a dark and shameful past...Yelp is probably that best place for me to let it all out and begin the healing:)

Before I became the humble software marketing genius that I am today, I was a suit...a corporate stooge...I wasn't workin' for the man...in most cases, I was the man:)

During that time of my life, I picked up some very unsavory habits...including one of the most unsavory habits ever visited on self-important executives...fountain pens:)

God help, me...I still love them so:)

I still have every one of them and I still use them with regularity (I know, I make my living with the keyboard...more or less...but when I write for pleasure, it's usually on a fine Rhodia #19 graph pad, with one of my 73 lovely "writing instruments":)

There is something both soothing and exciting about the flow of ink on fine paper...sometimes, it's the only way to get a really coherent sentence together:)

Some of my pens, I can refill from my inkwell, but many require cartridges...cartridges that they don't always sell at Staples or Office Depot...

That's when I set off for the far reaches of Old Town Scottsdale and swing by Scottsdale Pen Company...home of all things pen:)

It's like a head shop, but for a different kind of addiction:)

What a gorgeous and glorious selection of truly marvelous writing instruments, writing instrument related paraphernalia and objet d'art:-)

They have the cousins to my Mont Blanc's, the younger brothers and sisters of my beautiful Parkers and Waterman's and Sheaffer's...they even have the utilitarian antecedents of my everyday Lamy's and Rotring's:)

They have beautiful new Acme's, Pelikan's and Pilot's and mechanical pencils, like my Faber-Castell Fat Boy:)

Oh, and the paper...lovely leather bound journals and tablets, beautiful Rhodia tablets from France...I get goosebumps! :-)

Finally, they have ink...lots and lots of ink...in cartridges, in bottles...and I need ink!

They had cartridges for my Cross and my Rotring, when I thought I was going to have to go to Colorado Pen or something...so glad I didn't have to go that route:)

It was definite "win" for me...I get to support a wonderful local business...I got to "use" a bunch of new pens (try that at Pink's)... and I got a whole new place to hang out and indulge my pen fantasies...at least until they get the restraining order:-)

One of best hotels in the world. The Wynn hotel is located on the old Desert Inn hotel. It's the only hotel on the strip with a golf course. If you are a person who loves the European decor and beautiful artwork you are in for a treat. As we all know Las Vegas has a lot hotels from low end to high end. 

If you are a person who enjoys high end hotels you must give this hotel a try. The casino is done with outstanding artwork with great art finishing. If you are a high roller or a person plays the slot you will enjoy the great casino layout. The hotels is gorgeous from  A to Z. If you are a picky person when it comes to hotel beds you are going to love the beds here. 

If you are coming to Vegas you must give the spa a try. One of the best spas in the world. If you are buffet lover you will enjoy the outstanding food. I highly recommend  the Sinatra for high end dinning. If you are looking for something more low key check out the country club. You can have lunch over the patio that overlooks the golf course. 

Being a big fan of Caesars Palace for may years the Wynn is my new playground in Vegas. All the way around this is a 5 star resort.

When I was a kid I loved the TV show Hotel starring James Brolin (before he became Mr. Streisand). I was fascinated by hotels. So much that I wanted to live in a hotel. Room service. Chocolate on the pillow. Beds that vibrate for a quarter. Well, I didn't always say they were nice hotels. While I don't live in a hotel, I practically live at The Clarendon.

Things I have done at The Clarendon. And I can't list everything because my mother reads my reviews...

Slept in perhaps the most comfortable bed in the world. 
Attended a rockin' Halloween party dressed as, c'mon, guess...Yep...Hello Kitty.
Attended photo shoots.
Had drinks by that glorious pool and waterfall.
Watched the sunset on the fabulous rooftop patio. 
Become a regular (yep, they even know my name!) at Gallo Blanco.
Had dozens of extremely happy out of town visitors stay here. 
Enjoyed the men's urinals shaped like big red lips.
Dried my hands on that amazing Dyson hand dryer (insert hands for 12 seconds and they're drier than a Napa Brut)
Left my beloved bomber jacket at GB and retrieved it the next day...honest, honest employees.

Great staff from hotel to restaurant. Attentive. Friendly. Professional. I want to move somewhere else just so I can go on vacation and stay at The Clarendon. But. Wait. I don't have to. I can simply cross the street from my pad and enjoy this fabulous Phoenix gem. 

PM for the R rated version. Chow.

This review is long overdue! A friend of mine gave me a gift certificate for a pedicure so I called for an appointment and got placed with Tami. 

My experience was relaxing from start to finish. Tami (the owner) is very friendly and good at what she does. She had recently opened after years of working in the hotels doing luxury pedicures. She has brought her experience in that arena to the strip mall. If you're looking to be pampered with a high end spa quality pedicure without breaking the bank, this is your place! 

The pedicure that I had was amazing! The products that they use are high quality along with the heavenly smells... Let's just say I could get used to treating myself to a pedicure at the Mirror Mirror Salon on a regular basis. I really loved the fact that this salon uses hygienic liners in the bowls where you soak your feet. It's so important, I can't stress this enough! I contracted flesh eating bacteria at a high end nail salon in NYC and I could have lost my toe or worse. After that, I refuse to go anywhere that doesn't use them and finding places that do can be difficult. If I were you, I'd consider going to Mirror Mirror for that fact alone... 

Now as for the high quality products I was mentioning, I'll give you a little play by play. They use a callus softener on your feet followed by a brown sugar souffl scrub. Then comes the glycolic acid mask and healing foot mousse. After that I received one of the best foot massages ever with a rich, moisturizing body butter followed by their yummylicious vanilla paraffin wax.

I made sure I thanked my friend profusely for the gift certificate. I'll definitely return and I recommend checking out this salon. If you do, make sure to say hello to Tami for me. She's great!

We should've known to take our business elsewhere by the previous Yelp reviews and the fact that McFadden's was not so crowded.  But I think my group of five was giddy over getting last minute amazing seats to the Bon Jovi concert, that we just wanted to get a quick bite and a beer and head into the show.

The service was ok until the food arrived and it took a good five minutes to get napkins, forks, and water... The food was decent but nothing special at all.  I had the salmon entree (served with mashed potatoes and spinach) and the others went with chicken wings and chicken fingers (both served with french fries).

Needless to say, our time at McFadden's was the lowlight of the evening.  (And yes, I just made up the word lowlight!) The concert was incredible!  I will not be returning to McFadden's since there are plenty of other options to grab a bite before heading in to Jobing.com Arena.

Chocolate is the Chuck Norris of sweets. It is possibly the tastiest substance ever created by mankind. Sure, chocolate can cure hunger, but it can also be paired with any food, stop wars, and, in many cultures, is part of mating rituals. Chocolate is like sweet edible sex.

If you're still reading, you can stop now cause ... ya, I know ... "I had you at chocolate."

No sane person could turn down chocolate if offered. When my wife proposed going to Max Brenner at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace for dessert, she knew from my drool that I was no fool.

We were greeted at our table by a hyper server. Dude was clearly choco-rushin' and bouncin' off the walls. I loved his energy, but never did quite figure out what he was recommending. Does it matter? Chocolate is a synonym for "yum."

The Chocolate Fondue and Choctails were tempting (of course); however, we opted for Max's Fried Dough ($14.25). This sweet icon is one huge thin crispy plate of Fried Dough drizzled with Chocolate Chunks, Toffee, Chocolate Ice Cream, and Milk Chocolate Ganache. The animated server said there was no way the two of us could finish it ... I laughed and dove in with both hands. He knows this is chocolate, right? It's a messy and filling dessert designed for a whole family to share...or not share. (4 stars)

We also split a Chocolate Hazelnut Milkshake ($7.95) with Vanilla Ice Cream, Milk Chocolate Ganache, Chocolate Hazelnut Spread, Milk, and Whipped Cream. The shake was smooth, sweet, & superior. If Vincent in Pulp Fiction was surprised by a $5 milkshake imagine how he'd react to an $8 shake. Who needs vodka? It's got CHOCOLATE. I don't know if it's worth $8, but it's pretty f-in good! (4 stars)

Max Brenner, I don't know who you are, but I do love chocolate. So, yep, I'm a sucker ... and a fan ... cause there are only two kinds of people in this world, those who love chocolate ... and those who love chocolate, but won't admit it.

Before Bacchanal,  Before Wicked Spoon, Before the Buffet at the Bellagio, Before everyone else got on the bandwagon, This buffet started it all
Buffet Stations, each serving a different cuisine. What a great concept. 

I can remember when this was the "It" or should I say the "Must Eat" buffet in Las Vegas. But alas, It's old, the ambiance is not as vibrant, the food quality and presentation has been surpassed by the restaurant I mentioned above and more, but the Carnaval Buffet still has its mojo. 

I've always enjoyed the Chinese station here. Dim sum, BBQ pork, steam buns & pork and preserved egg congee. I always get the same things. Yum!

Pricing is in line with other buffer. 

Tip: look into the 24 hour pricing. The lady at the register told us it is good for all Caesars casino group for a 24 hour period. Buffet feast for 24 hours? my stomach might not be able to handle that.  Lol. 

Everything was good. The only thing is, Las Vegas is into Great things, newer and better buffets. It might not be as good as the glory days, but it holds its own as far as I'm concern.

A $19 cobb salad with a $3 PBR. Well, let's be real here...eventually we learned of buckets of PBR, six for $15. DEAL! SOLD! The cocktail list is lively, fresh and inventive and pricey as one would expect at a resort. 

We took shelter in our private cabana and had stellar service from AJ. We were served a fruit and veggie platter along with other things we ordered...nachos were delicious...as was my cobb salad.

The cabana was comfortable with a u shaped seating area with complimentary bottled water (well, complimentary my ass...it's part of the $200 that was paid for the cabana...but I digress) and of course plenty of clean, fresh towels. 

The entrance, the grounds, the main pool...everything just so vibrant, clean and utterly breathtaking. The crowd was so NOT douchey. It was a nice mix of old and young, gay and straight and black and white...you get the picture. We met a lot of fun people during our six hours there. 

Now. The best part. My friends, young as they are, were staying for happy hour. Well I had my limit of PBR's and had a Schnauzer in diapers waiting for her afternoon walk, so I decided to split. The concierge directed me to the bellman and said he would help me get a taxi. The bellman asked if a towncar would be ok? Um. Hmm. A pristine, shiny black town car or a roll of the dice with a skanked out taxi with a sweaty, hairy, stinky driver. Yes. Town car. 

It. Was. Perfect. I was sunburnt. Tipsy. And on my way home. The drive down the 51 is so beautiful. When he pulled into my driveway and said it was $29 (a deal!)...I gave him two twenties and thanked him. Cuz that's how I roll.

Horrible Horrible Horrible!!!!!!

For a dedicated customer whose been loyal for over 10 years, I've never been more disappointed in an airline than JetBlue 

Our flight was scheduled to depart at 2:45 pm over the New Years weekend and while we were waiting in line to check in, our flight was suddenly cancelled due to inclement weather.  That's not all. The rescheduled flight wasn't set to leave until three whole days later! Holy moly, i had to get back to work! That being said, they made no attempt to accommodate me or pay for the inconvenience. No hotel, no taxi voucher or nothing. They did offer a refund if I didn't want to take the ridiculous flight that was leaving three days later. I think you can figure out the choice I made. The heavens were looking over me that day and I managed to nab a late flight leaving to LAX 8+ hours later that evening. 

I swore never again to fly JetBlue but when February came around, I had to make reservations for a business trip and because my Amex preferred airline was JetBlue, I just took the leap of faith. I flew out of long beach with no hassle but when it came time to flying back home, trouble was brewing yet again. 
This time, the flight gate was changed last minute without any changes made on the overhead flight monitors. I was chilling in the airport lounge and checking the monitors periodically, and there was no gate change announcement until I arrived at the gate to depart. To add insult to injury, they stated the 5pm flight was delayed until 7pm for maintenance issues. 2 hours later, they dropped the bomb on us and said the flight was cancelled. I scrambled again, just like I did in January to find another flight. Thankfully I found another flight with absolutely no help from JetBlue whatsoever. JetBlue emailed me and offered a 75$ credit towards my next flight. Hmmmmm, would you fly again with them when your flight was cancelled twice in less than 6 weeks? I think not. I tried calling and asking for a refund or reimbursement for all the inconveniences (ie having to find another flight same night, leaving at a much later time than my scheduled flight, no accommodations, driving from Santa Ana airport to long beach to get my car, etc) The rep responded with a resounding "No compensation, only 75$ credit towards another flight" I asked to speak to a supervisor, she again responded with "No"  I'm done with this airline and if you have any common sense, you should avoid them like the plague. Horrible service, no regard or consideration whatsoever for their customers and completely unreliable.

Thanks to Preston's UYE at Lobbys, I now know the spot for a great burger in Tempe!

One of the things I love about Lobby's, its locally owned, and the owner takes pride in his shop!

After studying the menu for a minute I went with a cheeseburger & fries and was told to get some of that Lobby Sauce, I also heard that the Italian beef is the bombdiggity, I'll have to try that next time for sure. 

My burger was perfectly cooked! And it was messy too, but in a good way, everything on the burger tasted fresh too! Great flavor! The fries were delish too! Dip them in the Lobby Sauce and its game over! So good!

Glad to have tried Lobby Burger and plan on coming back soon!

Bigger isn't always better, but sometimes it's exactly what you need. If so, the MGM Grand Hotel is especially good for a big group, conference, or event. It's the largest hotel resort in America (World #2) with rooms branded as MGM Grand, Signature, Skylofts, and The Mansion.

What you'll find at MGM Grand includes:
 * Largest hotel in Vegas with 6,582 rooms
 * Largest casino in Las Vegas
 * 380,000 sq ft convention center
 * 16,800 seat MGM Grand Garden Arena
 * 4 pools including ultra cool Wet Republic
 * A quarter-mile lazy river around the MGM Grand Pools
 * EDM playground Hakkasan Nightclub
 * KA by Cirque Du Soleil theatrical show
 * Brad Garrett's Comedy Club (Headliners vary)
 * Regular performers like David Copperfield
 * A dated activity called the CSI: Experience
 * Access to the Las Vegas Monorail ($5/ride; $12/day)
 * The Forever Grand Wedding Chapel
 * A Salon and a Spa
 * 11 Specialty Restaurants; 6 Casual Spots, a Buffet, and a Food Court
 * Popular: Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak, Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill, & Shibuya
 * Shopping options including Sugar Factory and small boutiques
 * A large (of course) Race and Sports Book
 * The largest bronze statue in the U.S. - Leo the Lion near the LV Strip Entrance

What you won't find includes:
 * The Lion Habitat that closed in 2012
 * The Wizard of Oz theme from the 1990s
 * Anything truly outstanding or unique, but plenty that's a-ok
 * An escape from long walks between areas of the hotel

The MGM Grand Hotel is big. In fact, it's the biggest and most spread-out hotel you'll find anywhere. Rooms range between 3-4 stars. The accommodations are better than they were 5 years ago, but still kind of average hotel rooms ... which is no surprise when you think of the volume of rooms and people they must accommodate.

Three stars means a-ok and the MGM is exactly that ... a boring, but very BIG A-OK.

Bacon and Eggs chocolate!!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LpJvitnw7vU5UW-3KE9kjA?select=05V2dKzM-R3p4oJRngv_Tw
Cute! 

If you love funky, exotic, expensive chocolate, this place is a good place to check out. They have these fun, funky chocolate bars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LpJvitnw7vU5UW-3KE9kjA?select=AgIkITFbopwNhh8aTyzBVQ you can find also at Whole Foods and some candy shops: Bacon Chocolate being their most famous i think. I've had it before and it's pretty good salty sweet. 
If i didn't have so many sweet places to hit, i would have liked to have had more time (and MONEY) to try their different truffles. A cool stop at the Forum Shops for a unique chocolate fix.

Vegas reviews= DONE!!! until i go back in sept :)

If you have a longish lunch hour, go.  I went around 5pm tonight and there was nobody in front of me.  Took me 5 minutes to get my fish burrito (Thanks to Chris T for the recommendation!)
It was HUGE and came with a little cup of two salsas: green and red.  I cut it in half to enjoy the salsas separately.  
Filled to the brim with rice, cheese, beans and the fish and smothered in some sort of sauce, it was delicious!  
Service was super-friendly and everyone had a smile on their face and said "Amy, your fish burrito is ready!"  I mean, the personalized service was great.  Maybe hitting them at a slow hour was what did it.  There is a little retail spot where you can get incense (they're hippies, get it???) and posters on the wall to peruse while waiting.  I took mine home, but the patio is lovely.  There's even a vintage bike parked out front with little baskets filled with potted plants.  How adorable is that????

P-ay-stee, P-ah-stee, or P-aaaa-stee, however you say pasty- it is good stuff.  When I went here with a large group of work friends, we found many interesting ways to say "pasty" and after the beers started  flowing even more ha!  If you are very hungry this is the place to go!  A pasty is similar to a calzone or an empanada but with a thin-ish pastry dough as opposed to a bread/pizza dough around the outside.  You can fill it up with any kind of yumminess you would like and the menu is full of delicious options.  

The drink menu is decent with a good selection of beers and I am a fan of their house cocktails considering 3 out of 4 of them have gin :)

The service can be slow, but they are generally nice and informative.  The patio is great for groups with bench style seating and picnic tables.  Two historic homes make up the building and  inside there is a view of the kitchen and the staff usually waves hi, which is very pleasant and inviting!

This location is at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets (North) and has great deals going on. I didn't intend on coming here or even knew this store was here. After passing by I decided to step inside and check things out. The store was filled with customers as well several staff on hand to assist. The guy who helped me was very nice and helpful in getting me the sizes I wanted to try. I ended up getting 2 pairs on a BOGO deal and was pleased. They offer a variety of styles and colors and have sizes for the whole family.

If you think the service and food is bad, just wait until you write a bad review for this disgusting, dirty poor excuse of a restaurant. My boyfriend and I gave it try because of a groupon he had purchased, and like many others that attempted to redeem it...they treated us like we were trash. I don't think they understand the concept of coupons, otherwise they would have tried to make more of an effort. The fact of the matter is, businesses use coupons and promotions to gain a regular population of customers and bring in revenue...but here at Tina's, they use it as a scam. Well it worked, my boyfriend bought the groupon and Tina's found a reason why we couldn't use it EVERY time we tried to use it. They also have little children working there so maybe they should be checked out concerning child labor laws. My boyfriend has been getting harassed non-stop for giving his honest experience with this business on yelp, not only over yelp messaging but by text message also (apparently their business phone is a cell phone and when he called to make sure the messages were from an employee they saved his number after cussing him out). They continue to be unprofessionally vulgar with the language, threatening and were very racist in their messages (calling him a dirty mexican--when he's not even hispanic) which is UNACCEPTABLE. I am ready to hear the racist and demeaning words they have for me, but I think the world should know how disgusting this place is. DO NOT SUPPORT BUSINESSES LIKE THIS, THEY SHOULD NOT GET AWAY WITH TREATING PEOPLE WITH SUCH A LACK OF RESPECT. There are so many other well-deserving, hard working, personable businesses/restaurants that deserve your time and money. And please believe me, when I get the treats and disrespectful messages because of this review it is going straight to the yelp offices and all over the internet.

Oh and btw, the person harassing us is an employee there and has written a five star review, so I wouldn't trust any of the good reviews on here. This place needs to get shut down.

Come get some of this Mexican goodness! I just finished my taco and peppers and I already can't wait to eat more. 

Note to you anal, debit card carrying people. CASH ONLY. That's how we do here in Little Mexico.

Small tacos are $1.50. Grownup size tacos are $2.50. He also cooks chimichangas, taquitos and fish tacos which are not on the menu. My boss said the fish taco was lightly battered and seasoned to perfection. She even liked it better than a taco shop that rhymes with Poopios. I had the large Carne Asada Taco which was fresh and delicious and had no grizzle and included large slices of avocado. 

The star for me is the hot sauces and the grilled peppers. I tried both sauces: RED which had a smoky hint to it and also the GREEN which tasted clean and not metallic like some do. Now to the effin peppers. He seasoned them with Lemon Pepper and I didn't pay attention to what else and then grills them. They are huge, warm, sweet and full of heat and flavor. I just want to order ten of those bad boys!  What I did was take the guts out of my taco and stuffed them in the peppers. Buh damn!

Did I mention he has his liquor license and clean, little tables set outside and a boom box? Yeah, I think I am changing my name to Hi-me and growing a stache like a true Ranchero in honor of Chuy, Three Amigos and Machete.

Oh Lobsta, Lobsta, Lobsta!  

I do luv all things crustacean so you didn't have to drag me here for a lobster roll.  I've actually had some off the food trucks in Cali and really enjoyed them.  So I was eager to try the one's here. 

Combo Lobster roll with Garlic Tater Tots ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lobster-me-las-vegas#2Lng3Y1DRRiTZgwO36aW_A  They offer 2 sizes medium or large.  I went with a medium and I have to say it had a decent amount of lobster meat in it.  The roll was buttered and grilled up on both sides.  It was perfect meat to bread ratio.  I went with the original flavor with a touch of mayo and lemon.  The menu only listed garlic fries but I like tots so I asked for switch-a-roo and asked for my tots to be married with garlic.

Here is my close up of the lobster seconds before it was consumed http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lobster-me-las-vegas#yWfRR2jZGPrkV1wMVUNebQ

Ladies there is no pretty way of eating these so just shove it in your mouth and enjoy!  Worry about the mess later LOL!  It can get pretty pricey depending on what you order.  In the end it is lobster meat that your getting. 

Eyes ~ Oh Lobster Meeeeeee!
Nose ~ I smell a hint of garlic from my tots!.
Ear ~ Peeps walking by.
Mouth ~ So very very good!.
Tummy ~ Satisfied!

My new favorite lunch place in Vegas! I've visited Milos in Greece and New York and am so excited that there is now one in LV. 

They offer a set lunch for $22. You get the choice of several appetizers, a few different mains and dessert. 

We ended doing one set lunch and ordering the Milos special, a must when at any Milos! It's lightly fried zucchini and eggplant with tzatziki and fried Greek cheese. OMG, I could eat this all day long. Plus their tzatziki is like yogurt of the gods. It's super thick and filled with cucumbers. 

For the set lunch, we ended paying a lot of supplemental charges for the octopus and the lobster spaghetti but it was worth it. I think next time I'd do the dips to start instead of the octopus, but regardless everything was wonderful. 

The atmosphere is bright, with some seating outside, which is so lovely for lunch. I hate feeling like you are in the basement of a casino for lunch and that is not the case at Milos. 

Dessert was some of that thick Greek yogurt with strawberry puree. We licked the bowl. You get the picture. Have you booked a table yet?!

Decadence & debauchery abound at this local hotspot! 

If you're looking to celebrate and get your party on, i highly recommend this club.

Located inside Steve Wynn's Encore Hotel and Resort, the club was buzzing with party goers crammed in a line that appeared to have no end!

To forgo the line, we opted for bottle service with Goose and it was worth every penny!  If you're a dude, plan on paying bottle or slipping the usher a few $$$, that's just how they roll in Vegas.  When in Rome, folks!

With that said, there was still a bit of a frustrating wait inside the club for our table.  Once we got past all that BS, we did indeed land a great table...with a POLE! 

The girls got right up there as soon as we arrived and the party was officially on! The club was huge but oddly enough it was shoulder to shoulder on the dance floor and pretty much everywhere else!  This place was packed, but truth be told, who wants to go to an empty club anyways?! 

A great mix of Top 40 music was blasting with a heavy bass from the large speakers throughout and the club opened out to a beautiful pool area where folks were partying it up outside, as well. 

From there, drinks were up and the evening slowly became a distant blur.
Ok, I recall more than that, but am i actually gonna tell ya? 

Heck no!

What happens in Vegas, right?

Came here to check out the ZIPLINING (Freemont Flightlines) and the light show. Tons of people- GREAT people watching. Saw some familiar faces : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=baqnWN8WDv_vdGcYDljwNg. 
My favorite group was this one: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=cvn4V62FYXTCGj7WLVx4tg
I also saw a Justin Bieber look alike here, with his mom heading out near his bedtime. You can check out a live 80's cover band, street performers, cheap eats- my favorite thing here was the time when the neon light show overhead plays "We Will Rock You" from Queen. Forgot to get my deep fried twinkie to complete my experience...

They charge for parking (what?) in the structure, so park at the nearby hotels like the CAL instead.

My favorite free attraction in Vegas.  Yes, even beating the street people giving out cards with naked women on them J/K ;p

The Fountains of Bellagio are located in the heart of the Strip, where visitors can enjoy a beautiful display of water being shot high into the sky, in tune with music.  
http://www.vegas.com/attractions/on-the-strip/bellagio-fountains/

Strolling along the Strip, especially at night, it's a great sight to behold, whether with friends or your significant other.  Last time I was there, we saw the Fountains with Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" playing.  Later on, on the way back to our hotel, we saw it again with Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On".  Such an extravagant spectacle for the senses!  There's just something about an oasis of moving water right before your eyes in the middle of the searing desert,  music tickling your tympanic membranes.  All for free!

Great views from the front of Bellagio, or when dining at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  The show runs every 15-30 mins, with the start times depending upon the day.  

You can't miss this attraction at the Strip, literally & figuratively.  I know when I'm in Vegas again, I'll certainly enjoy checking out the Fountains of Bellagio several times more.

Highly recommmend!

The Brits have an expression, "Smart by half.' 

I was driving up Scottsdale Road and noticed this new location. I have been on Which Wich's mailing list for a while and remember getting a "Reverse Happy Hour buy one, get one free offer through August 15th" email .

I ordered two medium turkey sandwiches, with extra meat ($3.00 up charge) and a soda.  My thinking was that one would be free and the bill would be around $10.00 or so.  Instead I was told it would be $19.16. Seems the offer reads "order any regular size Wich and get the second Wich free".  Silly me.

The two mediums weighted almost two pounds each.  They felt really, really heavy.  I was impressed. But without that credit, it would have been nearly $27 for those two subs and one drink. Wow

So yesterday I thought I would try the same exercise, but with two "Regular" sized sandwiches.  Without ordering a drink, my bill came to $6.41 and the two subs combined weight barely a pound.

At this point I'm giving up on comparison tests. I'll be sticking to Jimmy Johns or Jersey Mike's.  BTW, both places were empty and it took nearly ten minutes to get my order. So maybe, "Subs, So Slow You'll Freak?" LOL

Sorry, Two Stars and  "Meh. I've experienced better."

This is the first (hopefully last) show I've ever attended where the headliner lip-synced the majority of their performance.  I knew going in that would be the case, but it still bugged the crap out of me.  There are a ton of Yelp reviews that mention it.  Almost none of them care and joyously devour her show like it's all you can eat ice cream.
  
Just being in the same (albeit very large) room as Britney Spears, wafting in her aura and celebrity is where their satisfaction is.  She could have been brushing her teeth on stage for all they cared.  My wife argued that I would go see Red Sox designated hitter David "Big Papi" Ortiz if he did a Vegas lip-sync/dance show and it's nothing different than this.  She's right.  I totally would.    

The scene was a sea of ladies dressed in club clothes, packs of gay men that knew the words to every song, Eurotrash, and significant others like myself that questioned whether the metal detectors at the entrance were for Britney's safety or to prevent a person like me from shooting/stabbing myself mid-show if she sang (ummm...performed?) a song like the inadvertent sex change anthem "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman".  The energy in the venue was palpable when you combined all that with the $45 "Work Bitch" caps, the homemade costumes worn, and people pre-gaming big by double fisting their $12 cocktails.

Of course I got a bunch of dudes a row up that refused to sit at any point during the show. Ballads, dance interludes, parts that she wasn't even in; they were all "Fuck it!  We're standing!  It's Britney, bitch!"  That meant we couldn't see anything unless we stood too!  So even when the majority of people were sitting during certain parts, I was still out of my seat which probably made me look like a really big fan of Miss Spears.  Puke.  I actually shelled dough out for this show so I'd be damned if I were to miss a wardrobe malfunction.  

Songs were....stage was...dancers were....screw that!  Go read other reviews for that stuff.   I didn't cross this show off my bucket list, I crossed it off my fuckit list.

When in Rome, eat pizza.

If you're in Buffalo, NY, you must have wings.

West Tropicana and Jones Blvd??  Chicken fried steak.  

I'll call it CFS from here on out but "Chicken from Satan" might be a better acronym.

It's rare that I get out of bed early enough on a Sunday to check out any of the dizzying array of excellent brunches around Vegas.  So when my first 2 planned spots went to hell, I chose to eat my feelings at the Black Bear Diner.  Anyone that works here will tell you that CFS is the most popular dish.  They were coming out of the kitchen and into the packed dining area like an assembly line.

Beef that is breaded and deep fried like chicken is kind of a mind blowing thing for non-Americans.  I had to repeat how my entre was being prepared to my Japanese wife twice.  It was a lot to wrap her head around and it should!!  According to BlackBearDiner.com, the CFS with hash browns, gigantic biscuit and 2 eggs totals 1580 total calories, 70 grams of fat, 20 grams of saturated fat, 4870 mg of sodium and 170 grams of carbs.  Holy....fucking.....shit.  This is the exact opposite of Crossfit.  CrossFAT!!

Funny how "comfort food" always makes me feel like death at the end.  Good thing the urgent care center across the street stays open late.

They INTERPRETATE the music so well!!! 
(Holla at ABDC season 1 fans!)

It was very difficult keeping the show tickets a secret from my dude- a huge Jabba fan. Bought them about a month in advance, we got 3rd row seats for about $70.00 each. Pricey indeed, but it was so worth it to see them live, so close and their 1.5 hour show was packed to the brim with Jabba-ness. When i could finally reveal the big surprise of the tickets, we were full of giddy smiles the entire time. From the very entertaining preshow until the end, we were fully ENTERTAINED!!!! 
Actually reading some of the things in the negative reviews made me sad and little butt-hurt that they were not ENTERTAINED! These are no skinny lizards- but some of the baddest mofos i've ever seen dance. I didn't give a f*ck if some of the story was a little odd or didn't really make sense to me the whole time. I was just happy to see them recreate some of their ABDC performances as well as a whole slew of new routines. ABDC fans will recognize special guest appearances by SuperCr3W members, which was awesome. I loved the playfulness of the glow in the dark sequence, the oldskool segment and the Single Ladies ofcourse. I especially liked the KB solos and it was fun spotting the individuals behind their masks, like Phil's booty shaking and Rynan's impressive headspins. 

A MUST SEE for TRUE Jabbawockeez fans!!!
Great show for hip hop music/dance fans.
Hit or miss for those unfamiliar.

Get seats in the front or center aisle and you may get picked for audience participation!

I don't get to Five Guys as often as I should, mainly because they started out my way on the east coast and are pretty much everywhere.  So I basically ended up with a case of burnout.  But since it was National Cheeseburger Day, and we were on a tight schedule for lunch, we decided to stop in since it was only a block or so from our hotel.

The thing to realize about Five Guys is that a "little" cheeseburger is actually a normal-sized burger anywhere else.  A regular burger there is actually two patties.  So from there I went with a little bacon cheeseburger, with all of the fixings.  And I immediately realized my mistake in overlooking how good Five Guys is.  It was just a delicious burger, perfectly moist, and bursting with flavor.  Hotdogs have always seemed to be a weak spot and that was still the case at this location.  For as complex and delicious as the burgers are, the dogs are always plain and one note.  Even loading them up with toppings doesn't help.

Note that an order of fries is a massive portion.  You can choose between regular or cajun, but either way you'll have your fill of carbs for about a week.

But don't make my mistake and overlook FG.

I had my first taste of the Capistrami in Vegas and was so excited they opened a location in Beverly Hills, but after coming to this new location, i am reminded that i still like the set up in Vegas the best. 
It feels alot more family run and friendly here.
Place your order first with the cooks, grab your drinks out the fridge and chips to munch on, and pay at the register. Be generous and give them tip for their Beer Fund! 

I've enjoyed the Bobbie and the Slaw Be Jo, (the philly is too spicy for me), but i still love their Capistrami the best. This time we got a 20 inch of that, and 12 inch roast beef Slaw Be Jo. They have tastykakes here, which i have yet to try and i love their potato chip selection. 

If ur tired of buffet gorging or don't have enough money left to keep splurging, and had enough of Sonics, I def recommend trying their pastrami!

When it comes to parties, Steve Wynn's Encore Beach Club and XS Night Club are still the gold standard for the hottest spots in town.

I came to the Beach Club on Sunday at around 2:oopm to see Calvin Harris and surprisingly there was hardly no wait at all! I've heard horror stories where people were turned away even though they bought tickets for the show because the venue was beyond capacity. In any case, we got in, I was happy...

SCORE!!

As soon as we walked through security, I witnessed an ocean of skin filling the entire space! And this pool area was huge! 

Damn these people are beautiful! I suggest ordering drinks on the left side of the entrance cuz the drinks were bigger, stiffer and the same price!  

I tried the food as well and it was also very good! I recommend the grilled chicken sandwich and the steak sliders, both were mouthwatering good and excellent accompaniments to our drinks!

Calvin Harris came out about 3:00pm and the crowd was buzzing by now with anticipation! There was so much energy in the pit but it was all positive, no hating, no shoving or any nonsense like that...it was all love and good times and that's how it should be!

Bravo Encore Beach Club!

I had a slammin time and I look forward to coming back very soon!

Happy Times!

I've been here a few of times with friends, and like the food very, very much.

There is a reason, there are over 500 plus Chicago style (Italian Beef & or Hot Dog) places in Chicagoland and why no one can agree.  

You have Al's Beef, Super Dawg, Gold Coast, Luke's, Joey's, Portillo's, U Dawg U, Little Louie's, Michael's Red Hot, and so on, and so forth.  

Just for fun, type-in: "Italian Beef" into Yelp's Chicago search engine and see all the choices.  I was surprised that the computer didn't crash, and that was just for "Italian Beef", try "Hot Dog" afterwards, too.

So, is it truly a wonder why several Chicago-ites cannot agree on what a good Chicago place is here in the Valley of the Sun?  

What Chicago Hamburger does best, can be found in their name.  Hamburgers!  More specifically, Sliders!

If you have ever been to a White Castle, then you know what a Slider is.  Sorry for ending in a preposition. 

Imagine what a good All Beef Slider would taste like if you used quality meats and put more then 1 oz of meat on a bun.  Now you know all you need to know about Chicago Hamburger Company!   And, the price for this Windy City Slider?  $0.99!

Oh, one additional item -- you need to get here early or late, because the kids start arriving from school around 11:30, and CHC has a ridiculously tiny parking lot.  You've been warned!

So run, don't walk to Chicago Hamburger Company for their Windy City Slider, or to Al's Beef for a great Italian Beef or Luke's for a great Hot Dog.  I call that a division of labor.

Enjoy!

The 9th Island:  Portuguese sausage, spam, jalapeos, pineapple and mozzarella pizza?  I'm so there!

Enter Buddha Belly Deli.  Aside from the odd tribute to Hawaii, essentially a mish mash of Asian flavors creating new Asian comfort food in Hendertucky.  And it's good.

In general, individual components to each dish are well made with the slightly over pronounced flavors.  Dishes lean towards South East Asia but with well controlled spice heat.  A series of house made chili sauces and concoctions can definitely make dishes thermonuclear without masking flavor if desired.

The pho dip lives up the hype.  A banh mi dipped in a flavorful beef pho broth.  Fresh baked roll loaded with five spice rubbed, rare, sliced beef and just the right amount of still crisp pickled been sprouts onions cilantro and basil slathered with hot, pungent Chinese mustard.  Simply put great eats.  The char siu pork roll equally good.  Juicy but not excessively fatty char siu topped with an Asian slaw and hoisin on a sweet bun.  Need I say more.  All sandwiches are accompanies by a side of their house made chips that provide a great textural contrast and neutrality between bites of the flavorful offerings.

A very good clam.  Basically tom yum kung with clams.  Aromatic, herbaceous, rich and warming.

The fries topped with Japanese curry (no coconut milk or aggressive spices of Indian curry) and a fried egg and strips of nori (laver), is and outstanding take on the Midwest classic.  Creamy, messy, and just plain good.

Finally, dragon breath fries.  Not spicy but a good wallop of garlic will remind you of its goodness for hours.

Although not destination worthy from the Strip, a great neighborhood, locals kind of fast food restaurant with a very friendly staff.

An all American steakhouse.  No Australian Wagyu.  No A5 Japanese beef.  Just USDA Prime Nebraska corn feed beef and American comfort food sides that bring out the best in the beef's flavor.

Rule one:  Stick to land.  Visit it's sister restaurant, Lakeside for well prepared seafood.  This is a steakhouse.

For starters, classic foie.  Served incredible thick cut, beautifully seared with slivers of apple, apple puree, tart huckleberries and vegetal celery leaves.  Beautiful balance. Pure decadence.  The charred steak tartare with the classic Worcestershire, Dijon, chives and crumbled egg is equally good.  The slight addition of the heat tightens up some of the beef and releases it's beef flavor.  Good texture and another flavor dimension.

To the steaks.  USDA prime, well aged, extremely well trimmed.  All steaks cooked to temperature, juicy and tender.  Top props to the 28 day, dry aged tomahawk.  Complex, nutty, slightly bleu cheese flavor of the dry aging and deep beefy goodness near the bone.  Win!   The porterhouse for two, the best way to enjoy both the filet mignon and the NY strip.  Less complex flavor but a steak lover's steak.  Once again, excellent beef flavor nearest the bone.

A well made variety of sauces are offered that enrich or brighten the steaks but then again, why rob yourself of the great American beef flavor?

Sides are very well conceived.  They enhancing the smoky, umame characteristics of the beef.  Top props to a great late season creamed corn topped with shaved black truffle.  Sets off all kinds of earthy fireworks when paired with the beef.  Sauted wild mushrooms (enhance umame) and grilled jumbo asparagus with the hint of vibrant lemon juice (contrasting flavor enhancing the beefs natural sweetness) all great choices.

Service is steakhouse familiar and efficient.

Excellent wine list. Good vintage depth.  New world emphasis.  High Vegas resort pricing.

Consistent.  Several repeat visits (thanks to the Wynn Classic tourney).  An American steakhouse that hits the mark.

I like Firehouse Subs for their premium tasty sandwiches, they're absolutely outstanding!  

Recently I've found it somewhat harder to swallow their premium prices.

Years ago, the late Clara Peller became famous for her TV commercial "Where's the Beef?", while complaining at a burger place called, "Home of the Big Bun".

While Firehouse isn't that bad, they are close and Which Wich isn't too far behind either for the same reason.  I'm tired of trying to figure out who is giving out 3oz, or 4oz of deli meat on their subs.  

What I truly enjoy is a creative, well made sandwich, that has er, some beef on it, or in Firehouse's case, some meat.  

Quiznos went though bankruptcy, I believe because they forgot that consumers could see them weighing the meat on a scale, and then removing a slice or two when it was too much.

Okay, here's my beef (pun intended).  A group of us came here for lunch and universally found our checks in the $11.00 range.  So that's a sandwich 12" long, meat, chips and a drink.  How much does a 1/4 lb of the most expensive deli meat cost at Fry's or AJ's?

Sadly, we've found it easier just going to Jimmy Johns down on Chandler Boulevard, asking for double meat and paying $9.50 for the same setup.

I give the manager of this location high marks for draining the liquid from the heated pastrami/corn beef NY Steamer after it came out of the oven.  I was in a Firehouse in Florida recently where they forgot to do this and the sandwich just a mushy mess.

In summary, "Yes, I am a Fan" of Firehouse Subs, particularly for all the local Outreach they do for our Bravest. But I only hope they consider taking their thumb off the scale and put some real meat on those sandwiches. 

Enjoy!

Dear Chef Ramsay, are we not worthy?  

Gordon Ramsay's pub features tasty Americanized pub grub.  It's too bad because the British classics are so much better.

The food.  Fish and chips.   Perfectly cooked, moist cod encased in a crisp crust.  Win!  The chips?  Excessively large, like fried baked potatoes.  They are fluffy and delicate in the middle.  Feminine chips!  A good, vegetal but sweet mushy peas complete the dish.

The Sheppard pie, Americanized.  The addition of beef to the traditional lamb mellows flavor.  The dish is no longer rustic and earthy.  The fat and grease (hey, its flavor) in the stew is gone.  It's been  replaced with a buttery potato crust.  Either way, it goes to your butt.  Tasty yes, but it leaves you yearning.

The pork belly roll is total pork heaven although much less fatty than the British counterpart.  Served simply in its own jus with roasted carrots and pea pure.  Done.

Finally, the beef short rib and cheek sandwich; TRY THIS!  Juicy, tender short rib is combined with the sweet goodness of braised beef cheeks.  Served on sourdough, accented by the very earthy flavors from the horseradish aioli, roasted pepper jam and onion marmalade. Win!

Passable selection of British beers that share space with butt wiper and the like.  High Vegas resort prices.

The dining space is contemporary with a Disneyland feel.  It's a pub by dcor not by the vibe of the guest you expect from a crowded, boisterous, friendly pub.  

If you're wearing a t-shirt that says "I love Las Vegas" go right on in.  This is your kind of place.

Review #300.  

Fishes welcome!  OOPS.  Freudian slip.

When you grind for a living, you can't let out your secrets; except on Yelp and a milestone review.  That said, this is a review for the recreational player.

The Venetian is the best managed, most comfortable, poker room in Vegas.  Friendly dealers, knowledgeable floors, comfortable seats, well spaced tables, huge number of monitors, food and beverage service, even massage service (not the happy ending variety).

Great game selection for low and mid stakes players (NLHE, LHE, O8B, PLO, Open face Chinese, and the occasional mixed game).  Word of caution, the low limit 2/5NLHE ($200-$1000 buyin) games are frequented by Vegas grinders.  Special note to LA players, the mid limit games like the 5/10NLHE ($400 - no max) and 10/20NLHE ($800 - no max) are tougher than those at Commerce.  They play deep stack with the typical buyin 1,000 BB.

Best attended daily tourneys for the casual player. Offered twice a day, they feature low buyin, decent prize pool, a good amount of play and a soft field.

Great tourney series (Deep Stack) that occur multiple times a year.  Mid range buyin's.  Good structure.  Good mix of players.  Great prize pools.

Single table turbo SNGs run throughout the year but pickup during the Deep Stack series.  Various buyins.  Always 10 players and two winners paid in casino checks (no lamers).

Great comp system ($2 per hour for cash games).  Comps can be accumulated and used for table side food service.  Seriously, there's nothing like handling checks and cards for hours then picking up that juicy burger right?  You only have Montezuma revenge once.

Final tip:  Try the espresso.  It comes with a crystallized sugar stick.  Double rush!

Pull up a chair and enjoy!

Vegas requires a surprisingly large amount of thinking. Does the club pay for the cab? Sometimes. One-guy-one-girl rule? Usually. Be sure to tip... or not. Buy her a drink... or not.  $30 cover?? 

Did I just go to a strip club or do my taxes?

I'm at a point in my life where i'm trying to find meaning and depth in the world... and this is the last place in the last city I should be in. It just doesn't do it for me. But it's always good to try new things, and thus lovable Yelper, AJ, made sure I didn't leave without getting my first lap dance.

Keane: So.. uh... what are you into?
Girl: *surprised look*
Keane: Uh.. I meant... things to do.
Girl: I've been going to a lot of late night clubs... Oh! You have really soft hair. What do you use?
Keane: ... shampoo.

I love love love Sun Cyclery! Absolute best bike shop in all of Phoenix. I bought my last two bikes from Sun. Larry, Joe, Adam, Allen, they're all great. They always help me find what I need. They have the best customer service in the world. I'm sure of it. Sometimes I visit them just to hang out and see what's new. That's how cool they are. I was in yesterday having my hub flipped from a single speed to a fixed gear. (Yes they teased me, yes it was playful and welcomed, haha!)

We live in the neighborhood and the guys are always happy to air up our tires and oil our chains. Plans in the works to get the boy a bigger bike for his birthday. They do layaway here so that's awesome. They buy and sell used bikes too! When you buy a bike from Sun they ask you to bring back your bike in a month or so, for your first (and complimentary) tune up (about a $40 value). 
 
The shop has recently been renovated and looks beautiful with the wood paneling on the walls and the extra space. Huge selection of bikes in the shop and out back. Tell the guys what you're looking for and they'll be happy to make some suggestions, pull out bikes for you to try, and get you on the road with a beautiful new ride! 

If you're in the market for a bicycle or just need a tuneup you should absolutely stop at Sun Cyclery. Say hello for me!

In every city, usually across the street or within a short walk of the High School there is a neighborhood hangout. 

The food can run from just average, to exceptional. Elmer's tends to be mostly in the latter camp over the former, what a wonderful surprise.

My two coworkers and I came here for a late lunch yesterday. From the outside, it doesn't look like anything special. Heck, even on the inside it doesn't either. 

Yes, Elmer's is a hole in the wall type place. One that probably wouldn't even make Guy Fieri's DDD list. But the food is good.

I ordered chips, steak burrito and a drink. The tab came to under $9 and if you look at the picture of the chips, it's kind of basic. The Salsa btw comes in plastic squirt bottles. LOL. 

But my steak burrito was the real deal and bomb! Take a look at my picture and know that Chipotle has nothing on this bad boy. It tasted as good as it looks and it's only $5.85.  Nice. 

Enjoy!

I'm going to try to sound as professional and as objective as possible.

+ Luke Warm Broth: "Ohhhh hell naw!"
+ Brown Sprouts and Wrinkly Basil Leaves: "You're kidding, right?!"
+ Stale Rice Noodles: "Can my lunch get any worse?"
+ Dried up Lime that had no more Juice: "Definitely ohh hell naw!!!"
+ Wait time for the Pho: "Beyond ridiculous."

Hi Owner, I hope you are reading this.  Pho at any V-nese is absolutely the numero uno dish that must have no flaws if you want a repeat customer as myself.  I'm sorry, but the dried up lime was just blatant! There's no excuse for not having fresh limes on hand! I've had my share of cutting up limes and I know how much juice I can extract.

The standard for broth temperature should always be hotter than the sun! I should be able to finish my pho with some hot soup remaining.  Brown sprouts and wrinkly basil leaves?! Inexcusable.

Considering the place was below half full, the time for Pho to come out should be fairly quick, not 30 minutes that felt like an eternity.

Its a big time shame.  Your awesome decor can never make up for the quality of food I had last time here.  Its by far the most modern, trendiest V-nese joint I've stepped foot it in.  I respect your Crate and Barrel-like furnishings and high-end bar with TVs, but at the end of the day, it comes down to the food that I expected to shine if we are going to pay a leg and arm for.  $10 Pho? 

Enough said.

Many fine dining restaurants in Vegas resorts seem to be having recession specials right now, so we decided to take advantage of a $39 prix fixe menu L'Atelier is offering. We found out that they stop serving this particular pre-theater menu at 6:45pm. We were running late, and got in closer to 7pm, but the chef still accommodated us. 

The three course meal was served bento box style, with even the dessert on the plate. I can see how this is a convenient wham, bam, thank you ma'am option for people rushing to catch a Vegas show. 

I ordered the king crab and cous cous appetizer, osso buco entree and peach panna cotta dessert. While everything was tasty, portions were definitely on the small side, and nothing that blew me away. It wasn't the quality you'd expect from a Joel Robuchon restaurant. 

Service was pretty mediocre as well. Just because L'Atelier is the more affordable and trendy alternative to its sister restaurant, it doesn't mean it shouldn't put out excellent food and service too.

For brunch we decided to come to  Bouchon, and it didn't disappoint. From the get-go the service was top-notch. Our( forgot his name) waiter did an amazing job. He explaining the special they had that day and for his services. But I had to give it to the manager Jonathan. He was so professional,and friendly. He kept on coming by to our table and asking if the food  tasted to our likening. 
As for the food their pastries were fabulous. It was fresh and was  still nice and warm, and not to sweet. Highly recommend the pastrie platter.
The special omelette with skirt steak and potato was just ok. Nothing to fancy  about it.
Their chicken and waffle is a must try dish. The chicken was so moist and well season. The waffle with bacon bits and chives was awesome.
In the end it was a great brunch, and amazing service from start to finish.
Thank you again Jonathan for your hospitality, and your staff for an excellent service, and the wonderful food.

This is NOT the buffet that used to occupy this building. This is a full-service restaurant, and although it also uses "South China" in its name, it is the antithesis of the 2-star buffet establishment that used to be here.
After you are seated by the friendly hostess, you are given two menus. The shorter "American" menu lists dishes familiar to diners used to "Americanized Chinese" restaurants: beef and broccoli, lo mien, chow fun, and the like. The longer "Hong Kong Style" menu lists dishes characteristic of the more authentic Southeastern Chinese dining establishments.  For example, you'll find Hong Kong style roast pork and roast duck, veggies such as choy sum and sweet pea shoots, various kinds of seafood and tofu dishes, and even dishes that are daunting for the less adventurous American diner (example: fried intestines). 
My friend and fellow yelper John M. (lucky guy, he lives near this place) and I thoroughly enjoyed our orders here. The ingredients were really fresh, the shrimp and fish so succulent and tender, the sauces very flavorful without being overly seasoned, the deep-fried tofu still silky and tender within, the fried rice treated lightly so that it was not greasy. Great food at good prices - most of the entrees are in the $7.95 to $11.95 range.
Glad to have this establishment here, especially since I'm in the Melrose District often.

Let me start by saying I am in NO way a strip club rookie. I live for titties in my face and ass on my lap. This is probably my 15th visit here and I am finally getting time to review. The club isn't the biggest or the most lavish but let me tell you it's down to earth and that's why it gets a solid 5 star. 

If you are planning on visiting the rhino start with calling them at 702-796-3600 to get a FREE limo ride to the club. YES FREE. Save yourself 20 bucks cover at the door and give it to the limo driver who deserves it. Once you walk in you see the dimly lit stages and a bar. Drinks are a tad overpriced but its Vegas and tits are in your face. 10 bucks for a corona, also do yourself a favor and get the chicken strips. I am not messing around when I say they are REALLY good. 

I got here around 4am and the place was PACKED. At least a 1:1 ratio. The girls are not super aggressive like other people say. I took 2 females of my own and they loved the place. They thought it was full of dirty old men looking at ass but was pleasantly surprised when they could walk around, drink and mingle with all the other patrons. Dances are 20 bucks on the floor and of course tip the ladies. Nothing but good vibes. SOLID 5 STAR

At the very last minute before driving to Lost Wages, I booked a single room at the Microtel Inn & Suites ($70 on Orbitz).  Having never heard of the chain, I pretty much felt I was rolling the dice with this one.  But since no true tourist in Lost Wages ever spends more than a few hours in the room, I figured, what the hell?  It can't be any dingier than my last stay at Excaliber.

Well, this joint (obviously new or newly remodeled) is light years ahead of the MGM, Excaliber, and even the Mirage in cleanliness and the bed and pillows are waaaay more comfortable.  Rooms are modest, but decor and amenities are up-to-date and modern.  Amenities range from flat screen Vizios, microwaves and even a mini fridge to store your booze in to drink before hitting the casinos.  They even do free breakfast until 9:30am!

However, the BEST part about this hotel is that it's 100% NON SMOKING, so you don't get that nasty smoke stench that (despite Febreeze) seeps into the walls, carpet and draperies over time (*ahem MGM!).  It's also a few miles just south of the main strip off of Las Vegas Blvd with simple, no hassle parking right in front.  This makes it super mellow for getting in and out.

Overall, I highly recommend this place if you 1) want to save on cash, 2) don't mind staying outside the strip, and 3) want a non-smoking, super mellow place to get in and out of during your weekend of ephemeral debauchery.

Note:  No King beds.  They only do Queen Sized.  Check out is at 12pm (not 11am like most hotels on the strip)!

If you've been looking for the best kept secret in Phoenix, this isn't really you're place, cause it's not that much of a secret anymore. If you're looking for an urban escape into the farming community of Phoenix past, then be sure to stop in for a visit.  I've always heard good things about Morning Glory caf here at the farm at south mountain for brunch on the weekends, we had a visitor in town, wanted food, was looking for an experience we've never had, one plus one equals two, so we ended up at the farm!

I'm so glad we chose to dine at morning glory, the entire place is super cool. Lined in an old pecan grove, there are a handful of shops to check out, some artist studios, two or three places to eat, and the grounds are a great place to take in also. This was the perfect stop for brunch before we headed up to the top of south mountain to check out the views. For anyone in the market, this is also a wedding venue, it's a venue like none other in Phoenix - if you're looking for that. :-)

Happy Yelping Phoenix, be sure to put this on your bucket list for Phoenix if you haven't been yet!

If you're visiting you should know the inmates booking number and the only things you can bring with you are a key and an ID.  Also, visiting is over a black and white monitor and phone, no more in person visits.

The ideal candidate for a job with the jail is highly insecure.  The MSCO remedies this insecurity by giving them a badge on their uniform and control over a small population of people who have already been stripped of any rights or privileges- basically powerless.  When you give sad people like that any kind of power, they automatically abuse it because they don't get any respect in their pathetic real lives.

Unfortunately, when you visit someone in jail, you have to interact with these mental midgets.  I've been here to visit someone and they didn't know if they could accept a passport as acceptable identification.  A group of them had to huddle together and weigh in on it before they decided a government issued identification was acceptable.  Another time I came, they said they couldn't let me in because they couldn't find me in their "system" which I thought was a good thing.

Most recently though, the Chaplin made a special arrangement for me to see my brother in person when our father passed away.  I didn't ask, he offered.  On my way to the jail I prepared myself for some type of hullabaloo with the dum dums running the visitors station.  Sure enough, as soon as I told them the Chaplin sent me they informed me that the Chaplin doesn't run the Maricopa county sheriffs office.  I reminded him that I never suggested anything as ridiculous as the Chaplin running the sheriffs office but merely that he called me and told me to come see my brother.  After about 20 minutes of talking as slow as possible to 5 different detention officers, I gave up and walked out. It's like they all share one brain and the brain calls in sick all the time.

This place ruined my weekend. I came to Vegas to get married and was told by a friend how incredible this place is expected to be. So I looked it up and on their website, this place looks phenomenal! 

I'm a firm believer in getting one chance to make a first impression and as soon as I park my car and unload, I realize the parking lot elevators are broken. As if carrying luggage down 4 flights isn't bad enough, we get to the check in counter and it literally took each front desk person an average of 20 minutes to check in each guest, us included. Finally, we get to the room and I will say the ambiance is nice, but the room sizes are tiny. Turning on the tv and it says it has a "server error" aka it doesn't work. I plan to ask the GM if we can cancel one of our nights so that we can relocate to the Venetian. 

I probably should have done my due diligence and checked the yelp reviews before booking, but I guess I didn't expect many flaws from a brand new hotel.

I went here to see the Coyotes play my home town Chicago Blackhawks. The place was sold out and consisted mostly of Chicagoans. I had no problem high fiving fellow fans after each of the 5 goals that the hawks scored. And of course they won going away that night. I guess it's a sad commentary on society in general when you have to go through a metal detector to go into the stadium. 

I had excellent seats since they were about 10 rows from the glass at the faceoff circle. I was positioned near the Coyotes net to see most of the Hawk's goals. The lines at the concession places weren't too bad but I'm pretty ticked that the dude as we entered our section wanted to see my tickets. I guess he wanted me to juggle my food and drinks in the air while I fished out my tickets from my pocket. He saw my "Are you kidding me look" and explained that they were sold out. I explained to him that I've gone to plenty of sold out games in Chicago without the attitude from the Stadium staff. How can the management expect fans wanting to pay $10 bucks for parking plus $80 plus dollars per ticket and still wanting to endure the hassle of their staff inside? Management might want to think about that for awhile.

Pro tip about going to the game. Don't expect to get any free pizza from their cheerleaders when you're wearing the away team's colors. Getting out of the parking lot was fairly easy as well. Also, thank goodness that cell phone reception is a little inconsistent near the ice so you don't have to listen to people on their phones.

We used these guys to cater street tacos for our daughter's 1yo birthday party.
If you have an upcoming event and need awesome food and great service at a great price, use Taqueria Guadalajara.  These are legit street tacos.
   Hector was my contact person, and he was very accomodating and professional. We ended up increasing the guest list significantly near the party, and it was no problem. 4 types of meat are included - went with carne asada, chicken, chorizo, and al pastor (pork). All four were good, but the consensus was that the al pastor was the best. 
   David came out to our house and set up about an hour before food was to be served. He started grilling, and set out the vegetable bar, which was huge. There were pickled onions, carrots/jalapeno, some sort of slaw, lettuce, pico de gallo, onions, and green and red salsas. David was extremely courteous, and stayed to serve until the last person was done eating - in 100 degree heat outside. Cleanup was great, you wouldn't even know they were there. 
  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because David did leave a "Tips" box out on the table. My feeling is that at a catered party, it is the host's responsibility to tip for good service. Expecting the guests to tip is a little awkward. Just my opinion, but not a huge deal. 
Would use them again in a heartbeat, as will many of my guests.

When somebody writes about a laundromat and says, "I love this place" and "This is the Cadillac of laundromats", then that is the kind of laundromat for me!  

My stupid washer decided to crap out on the Sunday between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, so by the time I bought a new washing machine I had to wait 10days to get my washer delivered!! Boo!  Of course I had been out of town three times in the last three weeks so I had a monstrous load of laundry and my dog was sick so I had some nasty smelling towels, so I decided I just needed to suck it up and venture to a laundromat.  After lots of Yelp searches, review reading and phone calls to laundromats I decided on Eco Laundry.  My research paid off!  

Eco Laundry has lots of washers with multiple capacities:  

1load washer- $1.25
2 load washer- $2.50
3 load washer- $3.75
5load washer- $4.50
6load washer- $6.00

They are all arranged in a very organized fashion with large signs to help you find what you are looking for.  

They also have two sizes of driers: 

Standard load dryer:  $0.25 for 8minutes I believe
50lb load commercial drier: $0.50 for initial 4minutes and I think $0.25 for every additional 4 after it starts.

Since I was making the trek to the laundromat, I decided to do my comforter and all my dog's blankets and stuff.  I had around 10-12 loads that I washed and dried for about $30 in 2hours!  Honestly the most pain in the butt part of it was unloading it and putting it all away when I made it home!

As far as the interior goes it was as pleasant as a laundromat could be.  Brightly lit room with Flat screen TVs throughout, clocks on the walls, stocked up vending machine, soap machine, and coin dispenser.  Oh and FREE wifi!  The cleanliness was far superior than any other laundromat I have been in.  The bathroom is kept locked, which I assume is for cleanliness and anti-loitering reasons, but you can easily ask the attendant for the key. Speaking of the attendants, they have great customer service!  When I called and while I was there, the attendants were very informative and pleasant.  The clientele was a combo of college students, a few couples and some randoms doing larger household items like comforters.  I ended up meeting a very pleasant couple from NYC and we chatted while we handled our laundry.  All around I have absolutely no complaints.  If I ever need a laundromat  in the valley of the sun, Eco Laundry will forever be my spot!   

Oh and make sure to bring cash!  All machines operate on quarters only.

Fabulous find. 

We were leaving Macy's and I asked "where do you want to go for lunch?"  We remembered there was a Habit Burger across the street, so off we went.

So here we are walking past Garbanzo. It was very dark inside with their tinted windows and the signs on the window said "Space Available." So I thought "Wow" that was fast, didn't they just open?  Well, another Phoenix business has closed. 

We get to Habit and the line is out onto the sidewalk. D'oh!  But just then, someone leaves Garbanzo and the lights inside tell a different story. Yes, they're open.  It turns out the sign "Space Available", was for another store.  So the heck with burgers, let's eat Greek/Middle Eastern.  Sorry Habit!

Garbanzo Mediterranean Grill is like the Chipotle's for the Gryos and hummus crowd. It's actually more of a fast food version of Pita Jungle. The food is really good and fresh!  Lunch ran us under $20  and we left very impressed. 

Enjoy!

The night is hot and sticky. The streets of old town have an eerily abandoned feeling as we realize it's 9pm on a Friday night and we are the only pedestrians around. Even in a sundress and sandals, I feel my skin glow with perspiration. After a bit of wandering, we realize we might be lost when I see a corridor lined with vines and trellises and my intuition and sense of adventure tells me to follow it. I grab his hand and lead the way blindly. He begins questioning my decision when I see a mysterious wooden door and before he can finish objecting we realize we found our way to the truth within. 

We step inside and it feels like we found the closet that leads to Narnia. We walk into another world. Another time. Relaxed sounds of jazz caress our ears as our eyes adjust to the darkness and candlelight. We take in the old world feel, the stone, the wood, the beautiful sleek bar...that seems to be beckoning us to sit. Couples and groups of friends absorbed in each other on cushy couches and stools all with a sense of privacy and feeling that there is no world outside of this place and there is no moment other than now. His eyes meet mine and we know this is exactly where we want to be.

As we settle in at the bar, helpful suggestions are ready when we ask. He orders for me, as only seems appropriate in this mysterious and romantic era. Pinot Noir, Cabernet, plates of pt, soppressata, brie, stilton white with cherries. I can taste the pure indulgence dripping off the mere words as they leave his mouth. The wine flows and the food is plentiful. Every sip, every bite, is something to savor and worthy of noting. Our conversation, whispers of love and beauty in each other's ears, lips close enough for a kiss. Knowledge of another world, remembrances of anyone else is lost as we fall under the spell that is Kazimierz. 

When the night is over and we have no choice but to go back to where we came from, we reluctantly step back out into the warm, heavy night air greeted by sounds of traffic and rickshaw drivers ringing their bells. But as we leave, we take with us a secret. A sexy, decadent, mysterious secret that lies behind an old wooden door in the heart of old town. 

The only way to discover that secret is to seek out that door and enter it yourself.

The first time I dined at Chompies I was blown away at how extensive the menu is. I have enjoyed everything that I have ordered. This is my go to place when we get caught between that critical 6pm to 7pm time slot when a lot of restaurants have big waiting times. This is not a knock on Chompies, It just works out that way since their clientele seems to eat earlier in the day.

I've usually order their burgers or the pastrami. My son loves their chicken sandwich. My favorite is the whole pastrami sandwich. It's very tasty and probably the best pastrami I've ever had. It is a mountain of a sandwich. I usually eat half of it and finish the next day for lunch. I order the whole sandwich as opposed to the 1/2 sandwich, soup option since the soup always seems to spill on to the plate when it's being delivered to the table. I don't like soggy sandwiches.

They also serve breakfast items. So if you have that picky eater in your family, this place is definitely an option.

Jimmy's is a long way from home for me. Even my GPS refused to find this place for me. But a quick phone call helped straighten out the directions. This place is owned by a nice couple that used to live in Chicagoland. There was about a 20 minute wait on a busy Saturday night; not a big deal for me.

Thanks to Robyn N. for telling me about this place. I was jonesing for some Chicken Vesusvio. I guess Chicken Vesusvio is a Chicago creation dating back to the Depression. So I was excited to actually have one of my favorites since I haven't been to Chicago in a few months.

I thought the pricing was fair and the dish itself was good (3 1/2 stars) but not the greatest. I would  probably try some other dishes before I ordered it again. For example, their Pizza looked awfully good as all the families seemed to have ordered pizza. I thought the service was excellent as well.

Downtown Pizza Lounge is a nice place to pop into if you're looking for a quick slice of pizza.  The basic set-up is that there are 6-8 varieties of pizza daily, and once you choose the type you it is reheated in the oven for you.  On the day we stopped in, the fresh pies were coming out of the oven so we were able to have fresh pizza, versus the reheated version.  Slices were good, and they have a few different lunch specials to choose from.  If we had gotten slices that had been reheated, I don't think they would have held up so well.   So like most other things in life, timing is everything.

The menu is fairly limited, with buffalo wings and house salads being the only other options.  But if you're in need of a quick pizza fix, go for whichever variety is coming fresh out of the oven and you'll leave pleased.  Overall, closer to 3.5 stars.  Three if you get reheated, four if you catch them fresh.

I was in the unfortunate circumstance this past weekend of having to wake up at 630am to drive and pick up my Bountiful Basket from Ahwatukee. To help offset the sleep, I decided to grab an iced coffee from the king of coffee, Dunkin Donuts.

As I walked back to my filthy, dusty car, I got the overwhelming desire to wash it. Now, folks, on the rare occasions when I want nothing more than to clean my car or house, I try to monopolize on the opportunity, so I drove around to three different car washes in an attempt to get my baby cleaned... but as luck would have it, not one god damned place was open.

Just when my will to live was seconds away from being squashed, I suddenly remembered that there was a Groupon special a week ago for Clean Freak, and I felt like it was a moment of Nachos (see Dallas G.) so I decided to see if the Nachos Gods were on my side this day.

Well guess what, Clean Freak was open! And I was excited because that big blue tunnel was just fascinating! And what is this? $10 for the most pricey wash that cleans my tires too?? AND air freshener?? SCORE!!! And to boot, the cashier dude was in holiday spirit wearing his Halloween costume!

Now, here comes this crappy part... the wash really wasn't that good. My windows weren't clean and there was still grime all over my tires. I had to buy window cleaner. None of the dead bugs came off my grill, either.

Oh.... and the vacuum's... I honestly believe that they could have sucked an unborn child from my womb had I been carrying one. But instead it got one of the many pieces of my stereo console. I'm sure that is going to cost me good money to replace. Thanks.

Next time I have to make such an effort to get my car washed, I will just live like a filthy slob until I can find time to make it over to Danny's Family. It may cost $25 but at least my car is clean and I don't have to worry about losing my uterus.

You can take the boy out of Chicago but you can't take the Chicago out of the boy. Being from Chicago, I've been meaning to try this place for ages.I mean what a cool name, Chizona, pretty easy to figure it out, some McHenry, Illinois guys running a CHIcago place in ariZONA.

I was jonsing for their pizza since it smelled so good but after having pizza two days in a row, I opted for the Gyro and fries. The gyro came with onions, tomatoes and tzatziki sauce plus cut fries with the skins on them. I love the fries, they give you a very generous amount. The gyro was great as well, My wife loved their Italian Beef and said it was better than Al's Beef (sorry Al). My only complaint is there isn't a self serve soda machine, just cans of soda for a dollar. I'm definitely coming back for some pizza because it sure smells good.

I've just finished my own personal challenge of writing 100 reviews in 2012.

"You better cut the pizza in four pieces because I'm not hungry enough to eat six."   Yogi Berra

Nothing beats a cheesy deep-dish pizza with all your beloved toppings.  That original pan crust is crazy delicious.  It's always busy here for a reason.  I personally love the BBQ Chicken.  If you grab it to go, make sure you toss some fresh cilantro on top for even more flavor.  Their wings are also incredible and they even throw some Parmesan on top of the Garlic Parmesan Wings for more cheesy-goodness.  Nello's pies are flavorful and packed full of calories so if you're on a diet, leave it outside and indulge.  This 30+ year-old award-winning establishment is made of love.

I think of dieting for the new year and then I eat Nello's pizza.  No shame.  No regrets.

OUTSTANDING seafood.

"That was really good.  What was it?" asks my Midwest white friend

"Spicy jellyfish with bean curd" is my straight face response.

"Huh?  So what is this?" he stupidly continues.

"Um, sea cucumber with abalone"; again straight faced.

"What?!?" With great exasperation in his voice.

"And this is Santa Barbra Spot Prawns with their egg clutch, deep fried crab with fermented black beans, steamed live fish with ginger onion, and the soup was made from tiger shark fin".

"I think I'm going to be sick" is all he can say.  Sorry I can't help but to explode in laughter.

Joyful House is a Cantonese seafood restaurant for the initiated.  I'm not sure if I should even write this review.  It's one of those places that long time Asian Vegas locals cherish.  Yes its won the "Best of Vegas" from the Review Journal but that barely speaks to it's hidden greatness.

So maybe they need to get to know you before they reveal their secrets, persist.  For example, you MUST ask for their spot prawns with the eggs.  Yes, they are now $12 each but they are worth every penny.  Eggs exploding in your mouth with the essence of fresh shrimp.

The spicy jellyfish was excellent.  Clean oceanic flavor accented by sesame and chili oil, and a touch of soy.  The sea cucumber with abalone, a tender sweet explosion of sea flavor.

Don't hate me but this is one of the few places that still uses real shark fin.  While I deplore fining and think it's inhumane, I couldn't resist.  It's been 12 years since I had the real thing.  Add a jigger of Remy XO, perfect.

This is not your typical Cantonese restaurant.  Yes, if you choose, they make great Americanized favorites (beef broccoli. shrimp fried rice, "Peeking duck", lemon chicken, shrimp with honey walnuts) but ultimately only those in the know will experience it's greatness.

Shhhhh.  Not for everyone.

I count my lucky stars that I am so fortunate to be able to finally eat at  by Jos Andrs.  It was a special occasion and we (surprisingly my husband included because he usually prefers cheap Chinese food over frou frou stuff) both thoroughly enjoyed the EXPERIENCE.  It was a precisely choreographed dance to put together these pieces of food, a play on textures, temperatures and flavors.  It was an experience with the art of food, and I'm not saying it with any disdain for snobbiness this time.  There were 24 morsels of delicious food - all incredibly creative.

The short and sweet version: Precision.  Perfectly choreographed and executed.  Juxtaposition of Flavors and Textures.  Adjectives that come to mind:  Fragrant.  Whimsical.  Airy.  Crunchy.  Ice Cold.  Salty and Sweet.  Warm.  Fluffy.  Umami.  Crumbly.

1.  Rebujito - our starting cocktail smelled like fragrant roses.  
2.  Truffle Cotton Candy - whimsical, fluffy with the aroma of truffle.  
3.  Idiazabal "Macaron" - delightfully crunchy with a cheesy filling
4.  Apple "Brazo De Gitano" - Airy on the outside, creamy blue cheese "espuma" on the inside
5.  Seta Suprise - Creamy 'shrooms
6.  Nitro Almond Cup - NITROGEN cold (not just ice cold) and smooth on the outside, creamy/briny/salty caviar on the inside.
7.  Barquillo - crunchy shell, aromatic Truffle and anchovy foam
8.  Almejas Al Natural - spherical globules encased with the essence of oyster 
9.  Bocatade Bacalao - warm, buttery brioche, savory cod, umami-licious?
10. Crispy Chicken Skin in Escabeche - extra crispy chicken skin + foam
11. Cava Sangria - Pop!  globule of sangria 
12. Artichoke "Puree" with vanilla - creamy, mild, smooth
13. Lobster with Citrus & Jasmine - tender lobster with jasmine flavored air
14. Chickpea Stew with Iberico Ham - globules of essence of chickpea and accents of ham
15. Turbot with Bone Marrow - salty/sweet/bitter combo with crispy bone marrow, turbo fish and coffee grinds
16. Lobe of Foie Gras - savory foie gras combined with fresh orange juice 
17. Secreto of Iberico Pork with Squid + Parsley Foam - tender, squid was a touch burnt I thought
18. Santa Gadea with Cotton Candy - "goat in sheep's clothing," goats milk with sweet cotton candy
19. Flan - creamy, light and airy
20. Pan con Chocolate - MY FAVORITE DESSERT OF THE NIGHT.  Crumbled frozen chocolate sorbet with cream, hints of saffron, crunchy sweet crystallized bread, and olive oil.  
21. "Arroz con Leche" - Another well played piece on texture, temperature and flavor
22. 25 second Bizcocho - fluffy cake with lemon cream
23. Air Chocolates - wow.  bitter chocolate and I usually really like dark chocolate 
24. Cocoa Paper with Dried Strawberry - airy light chocolate with tangy freeze dried strawberry bit

$ to Value Ratio:  4.75/5 Stars... This is definitely debatable (my mom may think it's a complete waste of money), but I rated it high because my experience was impeccable (service was top notch, ingredients were top notch)
Yummy Factor: 5/5 Stars
Texture Satisfaction: 5/5 Stars
Average stars: 4.92 Stars

We were guest 4999 and 5000!  =)

It may be Tryst or Pure or whatever "Sexy name" club on the strip for you during your Vegas trips, but for for a dive barrin' gal like myself, it's the Double Down. ...well at least it is from now on.

Always expecting dives to be at list a smidge too hot and muggy, I was pleasantly surprised by a blast of cool A/C when I walked in and remembered that A/C is an absolute must everywhere in Vegas - even in dive bars. 

And it is a dive. Through and through and through... although with surprisingly clean floors. In fact, after reading about the Double Down and having knowledge of a drink called "Ass Juice," I was actually surprised at just how clean the Double Down was. DOn't get me wrong, it's not pristine, but they keep it in pretty good shape. Must be due to all that puke insurance they offer.

"Puke insurance?" you ask. Yes, puke insurance. For a mere $20, my friend - if you puke, you are not responsible for cleaning it up. Somehow I don't think this is offered on my AAA policy. 

Now, on to the (in)famous drinks. The Double Down falls under my philosophy of "Just because it's the 'original' doesn't make it the best." And that's sadly how I felt about the "original" bacon martini. It wasn't that bacon-y... but at least it was super vodka-y, so you get your $6 worth. 

The ass juice... well, I was thinking of it wrong. When I hear "ass juice," before you're even finished saying the words, I'm already grossed out. So I was expecting something pickley and briney and gross... turns out it's a girly drink with peach schnapps in it. I've decided that it's gotta be called ass juice, as in "Dude, I'm going to get so much ass with this juice."

Strong drinks, ridiculous names for drinks, puke insurance, semi-surly barkeeps... all things for a strong 4-star dive. What bumps 'em on up to 5? Pinball. Not just any pinball - the Playboy Pinball machine. One of my faves. I was bummed that the flippers didn't quite work all the time, but I'll take what I can get... plus they had a photobooth and pool to add to the mix too.

Next time I've been wiped out at the Blackjack tables in Vegas, you'll know where to find me.

A "Japanese" chain restaurant in cities Brentwood, Dubai, Glendale, Hollywood, Kuwait, LA, Las Vegas and South Beach; an NO location in Japan.  It speaks volumes.

Sarcasm aside, and putting it mildly, this is yet another restaurant designed for the gaijin serving faux Japanese fare like silly 15 ingredient sushi creations with even more ridiculous names like a tiger roll or corn crunch roll.  That said, it does a better job than most.

Modern interior, clean lines, and a contemporary vibe provide a great setting for the culinary creations.  

In general, fresh seafood, beautiful, colorful plantings and wonderful presentation that heighten the experience and mask imperfections.

Creative dishes are very good.  A lobster and truffle chawanmushi with its soft, velvety texture, hints of dashi and sweet lobster accented by the earthy finish of truffle is good eats.  The scallop sashimi outstanding.  Brightened by the yuzu, perfect texture with apple and peppery finish of watercress.  The wagyu sashimi, gently seared with oil perfectly accented by the heat and pounced flavor of ginger and bitterness of chives.

Nice selection of wagyu beef dishes including some using A4 Japanese wagyu.  Be careful of the fatty richness.  It's very easy to fill up.  The wagu short rib, rib eye, and skirt steak from the robata grill are a great way to try different cuts and flavors.  The wagyu filet with foie and a plum wine reduction also worthy albeit excessively rich as the plum reduction lacks sufficient acidity to cut through the fat on fat pairing of the wagyu and foie.  Sadly the A4 wagyu rice was excessively oily with a cloying mouth feel paling in comparison to that of BarMASA.

Forget the silly rolls, they are a waste of the very good quality, fresh seafood.  Additionally, the rice for the nigiri is aggressively seasoned, sticky, and compacted with broken grains.  The seasoning takes away from the enjoyment.  Focus on sashimi offerings (ask for any sushi offering as sashimi).  Correctly graded chu and o-toro, very good mirugai, aji, and uni.

Well chosen selection of beer  and very well chosen selection of sake at Vegas resort markup.   

Good service but still showing the "green" uncertainty that will go away with time.

Definitely one of the better "interpretive" Japanese eateries in Vegas today.

As I walked up to will call about thirty minutes to showtime, I was astounded at the line of people to the right of the Crown Theater entrance.  "Damn! Is it like this every night?" I asked the box office person.  "Every Saturday night." he said.  You'd think that the actual "King of Pop" himself was about to hit the stage.  Fortunately, I had golden circle seats and avoided all of that.  Maybe tip the guys working the front to get in early and dodge that whole debacle or fake an injury, start limping and tell them you need to be seated immediately.  It was 90 percent full.    
    
MJ's Live?  Four different cast members play him throughout the week.  We were fortunate to see Justin Dean.  The moves and mannerisms were as believable as they could possibly be.  To his credit, I had a hard time telling when he was actually singing or lip-synching.  He would switch from singing into his headset mic and then to a regular handheld throughout while still wearing the headset which was kind of weird but whatever.

The audience took everything over the top.  One guy at the table up front was sporting a full on MJ Jheri curl hairstyle with sunglasses that he wore the entire time.  At another table was an adorable 3 year old with his own plastic mic that danced his face off, and even did some pop star poses with the guitar player.  Then there were the folks looking for a complete suspension of disbelief and going batshit crazy the whole hour.  "OMG! We luuuuvvv you Michaaaaaaaaal!"  Someone needed a Pepsi.

I can't find the exact word for all of it, but there was a fun, schlocky, "am I really being entertained by this right now?" vibe to the whole deal.  Kids would love it.  3.5 stars.

I usually stay at the V, but the last time I stayed there the experience was less than satisfactory.  I wrote a review, and the Manager responded w/ an upgrade to a Fortuna Suite at the Palazzo (I paid $129/night vs the room normally costs $199/night).  Needless to say, I was very impressed.

The Fortuna seemed liked it was 2X the size of regular suites at the V.  In addition to having the standard large bathroom w/ two sinks, separate shower and TV, the sleeping area was roomy.  It had a desk and the closet wasn't right up against the bed like a standard suite.  Additionally, the sunken living room was spacious.  There was a separate sitting area w/ an ottoman.  Lastly, it also had a great view.  

We were able to check in at the special desk vs general population.  Additionally, the room had not been cleaned by the time we returned from breakfast.  We decided to take a nap before heading out, so the maid had to skip our room.  However, when we left for a pool party around noon, I informed the maid the room was ready for cleaning:  The room was cleaned when we returned in the late afternoon.  I wrote the less than satisfactory experience the last time I was here, because the same thing happened, but the maid didn't clean the room.  

The V used to be the only place I stay in Vegas, but add the P to the list too.  The suites are spacious & luxurious, and the service is excellent.

This place is like the chipotle of pizza joints.  Select your crust, your toppings, and sauce, then they fire it up in an 800 degree Fahrenheit oven in TWO minutes!!  The prices are very reasonable at around $9 a pizza and you can get as many toppings as you would like!  The pizza comes out perfectly crispy!

The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and gave me outstanding recommendations.  I highly recommend the whole wheat crust.   The garlic knots are pretty good too.  Also they have a club where you get items for free after so many purchases and access to promotions that they send out.  Just for signing up I got a free cup of ice cream!  

If you need some pizza on the fly, this is a way better option than most pizza delivery chains in my book!!

I have been somewhat flummoxed over how to rate Which Wich.

I believe Which Wich does a nice job making a pricey average sandwich in a quirky feeling store (see photo of the Arrows).

We have been here several times and came yesterday after receiving a coupon by email for a free Regular (Small). My friend used my punch card for a free tenth one.  What that means is that they credit your bill for $5.50.

We both ordered the brown, thinly sliced roast beef. Which Wich defines their sizes as Regular 7", Large 10" and Super 14" You have the option of adding various veggies, or toasting it a la Quiznos. Like Quiznos, Which Wich weights how much meat you get and I would imagine that Regular has about 3 ounces. 

It's only a guess on my part since there is a five foot wall separating you and the person preparing your sandwich.  Why would you not want me to see how you are preparing my sandwich?

My friend's sandwich didn't weight that much when I picked it up.  I ordered the Large 10" (photo) with double meat (a $3.00 up charge). It felt like what a regular would feel like at Jimmy Johns or Jersey Mikes.  So you are paying $5.50 for a 7" sandwich which has about the same meat that Subway puts on their $3.00 six inch.  Yep I know, it's not really a 6 inches.  

In summary, that's $8.50 for a sandwich which would be $5.95 at Jimmy Johns, or $6.95 at Jersey Mike's (all prices do not include taxes).  Good thing they were comping me $5.50. LOL

My suggestion...  drive a little further down FLW to get a better sandwich and a better deal. Sorry.

My Sweet lovers guide to vegas treats!!

Jean Phillipe patisserie is a must. They have two locations, bellagio with the famous chocolate fountain display  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=5CTu6r-oMEnATEqkMQFtYg and the one at Aria  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=zqVvDm_-ikgvhPMZrUK3Lg which is bigger and has an area to sit down and indulge. U can have a variety of cakes, gelato, chocolates, crepes, pastries.. They do not sell individual macarons but u can buy a packaged set. The crepe, mousse cake and creme brulee gelato I had were all excellent!

Max Brenner @ Caesars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=VM3v-ly8TaqF6Gi21XOCTg is chocolate lovers dream! The chocolate smell wafting alone is intoxicatingly delicious. They not only have a boutique of chocolate treats, u can eat a fabulous meal here and make sure to get a chocolate chip walnut cookie: the best I ever had! 

Check out sugar factory at PH http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pNR0cAPdO4RHulVTFssn-A?select=eFmRocS3vcKGcJNlBTibOQ if u love gummies, lollies etc. but the cupcakes, macarons, gelato looked pretty ordinary.

Bouchon bakery at the Venetian  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=U4VwyUcdlz4Mlsl3hqb5Ug is a great stop if you've never been to any of the bouchon bakeries. It's a small stand as opposed to a shop. Signature bouchons r always great, their macarons r not my fave but huge and pretty. A new fave for me is their carrot whoopie pie!

Vosges at the Forum shoppes is a cool place to check out if u like exotic flavor chocolates. But it can be  pricey.
If u like banana cream pie, the one at Emerils at MGM is awesome!

I went to Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmo http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=v2QzpbqjH_ok7MlKhQsnpw expecting awesome desserts but altho beautiful, I was not too impressed.

Didn't get to check out Payard at Caesars but they have macarons there, altho i'm sure they don't beat Paulettes (now called Lettes) in LA.  Dessert at Wynn buffet  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=IAjMHTukj1EFSbL6WILEgg was disappointing

Other highlights of vegas eats for me was Cosmopolitan pizza, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon@ MGM and Earl of Sandwich @ PH.

Shows: Jabbawockeez at Monte Carlo was super fun and very memorable!

If ur going from LA, if they r open, make sure to visit My Delight Cupcakery in Ontario on the way home. They have the best cupcakes around!!!http://www.yelp.com/biz/my-delight-cupcakery-ontario#query:my%20delight%20cupcaker

*thanks ken c & janice c.for some of the recs!

I love Public House this was my second time here. The restaurant is located in the Venetian hotel. Let's keep this simple. 
Food we ordered all appetizer.
Poutine with duck confit and Stout gravy was delish,but it wasn't the best. Make sure to add  a fried egg to it. 
Lamb Meatballs was awesome. The tomato sugo,and the herb bread crumbs was on point. The lamb meatballs was cook perfectly. Highly recommend.
Steak Tartare. This for me was my favorite dish. The tenderloin was super tender. The capers beer mustard dressing was wonderful. What made the dish even more was the perfectly poached egg. That made the dish rich and creamy. Get this dish with the poached egg extra ($2.50).
Southern Fried Quail was fantastic. The quail fried perfectly crispy layer and very moist in the inside. Had a lot of great flavor going on.
And lastly The Foie Gras Torchon. This one I was a little disappointment with. So past on it. 
As for the drinks Huge selection of wonderful craft beers. 
The service was great and helpful. You'll see me around public house again.

Encore Beach Club is G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S. Kaskade Sundays is what's up. Like Wet Republic and Rehab, it's all about scene and be seen - you will be surrounded by beautiful bodies. Unlike Wet and Rehab, you will NOT be afraid to get into the pool! 

Mr. Wynn did an amazing job getting this luxurious beach club built in a matter of months. It's located at the front of Encore - I don't even recall them being under construction when I was there in April. The layout is beautiful with three pools and two levels of cabanas, and rainfall "cages" with a stripper pole in the center if you want to show off your skills. 

Kaskade definitely brings the party on Sundays, but the vibe is definitely more chill than Wet and Rehab (hence the cleaner pools). He's set up right in the middle in front of Surrender (the nightclub) and there's a small area for people to dance. 

We got in for free (doesn't hurt to know the promoters), however cover is $30 for women and $50 for men. You'll easily drop $100+ on drinks, so you might want to consider reserving a lounge chair ($150 drink minimum) or if you can splurge, reserved a day bed or cabana (some with your own personal see-through pool), which will run you thousands. Otherwise you can grab a towel and post up along the edge of the pool.

There are two bar areas, a few tables to gamble and "The Grill" to order food. Share a few salads, which are huge, and the turkey club wrap - the more healthy options on the menu. Food babies are not attractive here.

Since we were staying at Palazzo, it was ideal to do some pre-partying at LAVO. As hotel guests, I'm sure the Concierge could have hooked it up for us, but as I knew a promoter, my girls and I got a VIP table and open bar from 11pm-midnight. Really, the BEST way to pre-party on a Sunday night.

LAVO is a really nice spot for lounging, especially for a group of girls. The whole space is very chic and intimate, with the restaurant on the lower level and the club on the top. The cocktail servers are all gorgeous - loved their hot corset dresses - and very attentive. Once we were out of a drink, they were right on it. 

The crowd was very mixed - an all ages kind of spot. While it was awesome to see a female hitting the decks, the music was also very mixed and after Mariah Carey's "Fantasy" came on, it was our cue to leave. Not that I have anything against Mariah, but I like singing that song at a karaoke club.

Tip: The promoters all hang out inside the restaurant, and they're pretty easy to spot as they're the guys in suits on their Blackberries surrounded by women.

Four words:  Maine Lobster Pot Pie.

A puff pastry lid tops a "pot" filled with medallions of gently poached in what can only be called an enriched, buttery lobster bisque, uber sweet, Maine lobster tail and delicate claws.  Aromatic root veg and mushrooms balance the hearty dish.  Sensory overload as the dish is plated table side.  

Yes, you can get the same dish at Mina's flagship restaurant but here, it's comfort food, served in a less imposing, contemporary dining room.  American Fish is about outstanding seafood cooked in a simplified, almost rustic manner and it's good.

Standout starters include a refreshing, well balanced ahi tartare.  The natural flavor and richness of the fish is brought out by the tempered use of chili oil and fresh habanero peppers.  Pine nuts add an earthy balance.  Asian pears tone down the fiery spice and provide great texture.  The Seared scallop with Foie remains a winner.  The accents on the dish change with the season but always serve to contrast the sweetness of the perfectly seared scallop to the richness of the foie.

For other mains, the Mustard Marinated Black Cod is a top pick.  Asian influenced (think miso fish); moist, perfectly cooked through.  Simply put, good eats.  Finally, any of the wood grilled seafood on offer are excellent.  All perfectly cooked with no albumin visible.  The gentle smoke flavor adds a bitterness and complexity to the simply prepared fish that will have you longing for another bite.  Note, the wood grilled seafood is served without any sides.  The broccolini with lemon and garlic, complimented well with just the right vegetal goodness and acidic zing to bring the fish to life. 

Very good, relaxed service.  Outstanding wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.  Good happy hour.

Sometimes simple is best.  American Fish delivers.

Who would have thought I'd find myself downtown at a rundown casino like Palace Station, but there I was on a late Sunday night enjoying one of the most satisfying dishes sin city had to offer! 

Yup, I'm talkin about the Pan Roast at Oyster Bar! 

Do yourself a huge favor and order the palace version with shrimp chicken andouille sausage and crab. I added lobster too. But either way, It's the bomb, cuz its all about that crazy good sauce! Keep in mind however, to truly enjoy this dish, you've gotta love your spice! Trust, each bite will be a scorching spoonful of fiery goodness! Chunks of meaty sausage, chicken and seafood in every bite and I bet you won't be able to put your spoon down! Well, except to wipe your forehead from the sweat cuz this bad boy is hot hot hot! But oooh soooo hot diggity good! I ordered a level 7 (1-10 being spiciest) and it was just right!

We started with 1/2 a dozen oysters on the half shell, and that was an excellent intro to our fantastic meal! The oysters were fresh and went down the hatch nicely with a swig of cold frosty Kirin! 

We also ordered the shrimp scampi. It came served with loads of succulent tiger shrimp, a heaping serving of fresh chopped garlic and noodles swimming in a pool of buttery glory. Although it was tasty, it simply couldn't hold a candle to the signature pan roast IMO! 

I'm tellin ya, order the pan roast and enjoy! Your taste buds and tummy will thank you for it!

Happy Eats!

It was late and I was doing some early Christmas shopping in west Chandler and I stumbled upon Zos Kitchen. I decided to run in and grab something. 

But when I got back to my office after my pickup, I was really impressed. I've heard so many good stories, so I wasn't sure if it was going to live up to the hype. 

For my first try, I went with their Steak Stack for $7.59 with a Hummus 5oz side for $0.79(see photos). The damage came to $9.06 including taxes, which seemed pretty good for everything. 

What I wasn't prepared for was the tastiness of their bread. Don't get me wrong, everything was really very good. In fact, if they had used any commercial bread, this still would be a Four Star review. But the flavor of their rosemary bread was incredible. I would have paid $9.06 for a loaf of it. It was delicious! 

So, go enjoy, Zos Kitchen!  I will definitely be back.

LOVE The Barrymore!! What a hidden gem and one of the best meals I have ever had in Vegas! I've been to many upscale restaurants opened by celebrity chefs, but this honestly blows many of them away. Located inside the Royal Resort behind Encore, you'd never expect to find such a fabulous restaurant here. The interior is Mad Men-esque with chic retro decor and a really swanky ambiance.

Food and cocktails were phenomenal and the service was unpretentious and top notch. Everyone was super friendly and we even had the pleasure of meeting their amazing chef de cuisine Francisco Campa.

The seared foie gras was to die for! My friend and I shared one order, but considered ordering another because it was just that delicious. We also enjoyed their decadent lobster mac n cheese, and the fish and duck specials of the night were amazing. Be sure to ask for recommendations and hear about their specials. For cocktails, I really loved the Virginia Hill (Pisco, Lillet Blanc, peach syrup, fresh lemon juice, egg whites, 
peach bitters, sage). You really can't go wrong with anything though.
Book a table here and thank me later!

Swankified and fun atmosphere, especially when you have DJ's like Afrojack and David Guetta in the house! This is a nightclub that seriously knows how to party.

Guide to having a good time at XS:

1. Go on a night with topnotch DJ's whose music you can groove to for many hours.

2. Get a VIP table + bottle service if you can fork up the money. IT'S WORTH IT.

3. Look around. Lots of interesting/strange characters!

4. Dance. Laugh. Have a good time.

The layout at XS is great because you get a great view of the DJ from almost every angle. The outdoor area features a pool where crazy antics take place. There is minimal seating for the general public -- gotta stand if you don't pay up. If you're okay on your feet for hours you'll be fine, but ladies know it is SO worth it to have a table. Not to mention service from the hostesses is excellent and they're also pretty cute.

My favorite part of the night was dancing up on the cushions of our booth seats (happy feet!). It was comfy as well as an awesome vantage point. We could see: 1) all the oddly dressed and/or super drunk people around us and 2) AFROJACK+GUETTA as they dropped those beats!

DATE TIP (Gentlemen): Make a note of the paragraph above regarding seating. The ladies will love you if you have a table. Or at least visit you to rest their feet. ;)

DATE TIP (Ladies): Cushion dancing is awesome, but at an elevated height one is much more prone to creative pickup lines. A small price to pay for the view you get!

We were sooo happy when Sam Fox opened one of his Zinburgers here in Scottsdale Quarter.  Our taste buds leaped for joy.  

We've always enjoyed their Biltmore location. And even though the service here could be better and the location enlarged, the burgers were...  great. 

We returned last evening for our fourth visit. I would plan on a thirty minute wait, but that will allow you to hit some of the nearby stores. The time went by quickly, with a band playing in the promenade.  Nice!

We started off with their yummy fried zucchini sticks ($7.00), adding the Chipotle Mayo dip to the Ranch was a great idea. I decided to try their Kale Caesar ($4.50). It was good, but needed a little more dressing. 

As for our burgers, we ordered the Breakfast ($12.50) open face and their house Zin($10.50).  Mine had an fried egg on top, with applewood bacon,
avocado, cheese, lettuce and mayo; while the Zin had manchego cheese, yummy zinfandel Braised Onions with lettuce and mayo.  Both were delicious.

I believe the secret to Zinburger is how they make their burgers.  Rather compacting the chopped meat and squeezing out all the air pockets. They form them gently. That way the smoky taste permeates the meat.

Expect to pay $20 each plus taxes and gratuities, including soft drinks and one appetizer or small salad each.

Enjoy!

Move over Kuma, there is a new sheriff in the snow ice game, and his name is Frost Bites Shavery. Opened just a week before Kuma opened, this snow ice is taking it to a whole 'nother level!

I found out about this place from the KTNV news website. They were doing a piece on Jet Tila's Kuma that just opened up. Over on the comments page, a few people were writing in that there was another place doing the snow ice, and it was over in Henderson. After a so-so experience at Kuma, I decided to check this place out the next day.

Frost Bites Shavery is a freestanding food truck that is located in the same shopping center as Friendly Donuts on Boulder Highway.. You can usually find them across from the China Inn restaurant. 

When I saw the menu, the first thing that popped out were the flavors, more particularly, black sesame. The owner, Mikey, gave me a sample to try. Let me tell you, I had an epiphany. Here is why. 

When I went to Kuma, I randomly ran into Tony T. As we ate our snow ice, he told me that it originated in Taiwan. He also told me how to tell the difference between OK snow ice, and an exceptional one. The most important thing is the texture. When you eat snow ice, it is supposed to melt in your mouth, almost like freshly fallen snow. At Kuma, when you eat it, you can taste the crunchiness as you chew, almost like a sandy texture. At FBS, after a couple of bites, it melts away.

 Mikey, the owner, told me it took him months to figure the recipe out, and he agreed that it should be smooth, and not a sandpaper feeling. He was also cool to let me try any of the flavors that I wanted. I took samples of the green tea and mango, and they were much superior to Kuma's. 

I ordered the black sesame with mango, and he even put condensed milk on it for no charge. The mango was perfectly ripe, and had a bright flavor. For the black sesame, Mikey actually grinds real black sesame into the milk, and lets the flavors infuse before preparing the ice, and it is phenomenal. It was a stunning snow ice.

I'll be back here because of the great flavors, an awesome, generous owner, and the best snow ice in the Valley!

A good Pho restaurant in Vegas?! Can it be??

Yess!! 

It's about time that I write a review about this place. I live right down the street so you'll find me here for dinner if I'm too lazy to drive out or cook for myself. Their location is great for me, but for the masses they are at a huge disadvantage. They are located on the south side of town, 20 minutes or so away from Chinatown, which is where most people who seek out Vietnamese or any type of Asian food will go. They are also hidden in a complex where there storefront cannot be seen from the street.

When it comes to Vietnamese food, I am quite spoiled. I grew up on my grandma's homemade Pho, so most Pho restaurants in Vegas don't even compare. Pho Annie though...hits the spot! Satiates that craving. 

When I order a bowl of Pho, I like it to be perfect without me having to add any of the condiments available. Hoisin and sriracha should be a dipping sauce for the meat not to flavor the diluted bowl of broth that some places try to serve. Of course everyone has their preferences but regardless the foundation of the dish has to have substance to begin with. 

Their broth is perfectly balanced...very hearty and full of flavor (but not salty) unlike many other restaurants that will serve diluted broth or broth that tastes like MSG. The noodles aren't soggy or undercooked and the vegetables are fresh. Everything just comes together. 

Service could be better, but Vietnamese restaurants are notorious for awkward service. The servers do not look you in the eye when they are talking to you or taking your order. They most likely won't be checking up on you. HOWEVER...you will get your food within 5-10 minutes...which is nice.

This was my first time in Terminal 3 since I was flying Virgin America to LA and I do have to say that it's pretty awesome because it's new, modern, open, and spacious. Checking in is a breeze if you must do so. All the airlines are all lined up with awesome LED screens indicating each airline's specific counter. 

The security now has two separate lines - one for regular screens and individuals who have TSA Pre-Check. The TSA Pre-Check line moved pretty quickly even if it looks pretty long. Just remember folks, put all your stuff in your bag and don't have any metal like belts, coin change, etc. on your or in your pockets. It'll make the line move much more quickly!

After getting through security, there are plenty of screen to inform you of you arriving and departing flights. The terminal is pretty big with huge windows that let in plenty of light. In true Vegas style, there are slot machines around every corner in case you have extra time before your flight.

There are plenty of food options such as Pei Wei, Burger King, Carl's Jr., and Coffee Bean. I think there are a couple more options, but I noticed these just from looking for food. They also had your basic stores in case you wanted some snacks, reading material, Las Vegas memorabilia, etc. The bathrooms are also modern and clean, which is always a plus.

The terminal is very accommodating to tech savvy folks. There is free wi-fi for your use and there's also a dedicated charging station. It would've been better if there were chargers are each seat, but that's just me being picky.

If I have to fly to Las Vegas again, going through Terminal 3 would be awesome. It has everything I need to literally make the time fly! You will not be disappointed!

The Buffet at Bellagio is like one long foodgasm. If you are going to do a buffet in Vegas, this is in the top 3. 

Our last visit was for the July 4 "Holiday Dinner" buffet which was $40.99 per person. It featured the King Crab Legs, Kobe-style Beef, and large Shrimp that are usually only available for the "Gourmet Dinner" ($36.99) on Friday or Saturday. Otherwise, the buffet is only $29.99 for dinner. Lunch, Weekend Brunch, and Breakfast are even cheaper.

I literally gorged myself on King Crab Legs (as were hordes of others). A little butter, garlic, and spice for dipping and I was in crab heaven. Other nice discoveries were small, but addictive Steak Tartar bites, a couple Spicy Tuna Handrolls, steamed Halibut, and some spicy Cornbread. The pizza and prime rib were disappointing. Avoid them. For dessert, some nice cakes were present, but the yogurt machine was Souplantation quality.

Tip: Pay the lunch price before 4:00 and get dinner options at 4:00. Saves you around $10 a person.

Tip 2: Plan to spend about 45 minutes in line... unless you are lucky...and if you're lucky get out of line and go hit the nearest baccarat table before eating.

Visiting Paris Las Vegas is kind of like a trip to Paris, France. No worries, you won't need a guide book. Check yourself in, eat the food, use the wrong verbs, get charged double, and end up kissing strangers - or is that just me? Don't ask.

They say a lot of things about Paris ... it's a place to find inspiration ... a place to discover something new about life ... a place to find love. I say it's a place to discover your fate. Sadly for me, fate seems to be the Paris casino tables liberating my money in ridiculous fashion. Fate should be when people meet on a train or in a Paris cafe and not in line at the ATM machine.

Most people go to Paris, France to fall in love ... while at Paris Vegas, people go for the prime center-Strip location/views plus the good fortune of not having to actually talk to French people. 

The beautiful exterior with iconic Eiffel Tower, Montgolfier Balloon, and Arc de Triomphe are photo op spots un deux trois. Inside, the Casino is like a small French village under a sunny blue sky. Two restaurants with views are Mon Ami Gabi (patio view of the Bellagio Fountains) and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant (view of the Strip). Don't forget, you're either in a caf in Paris or a coffee shop in Vegas. 

Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino is a quaint charming theme hotel in the heart of the Strip, but without better luck at the tables or lower prices, my preference is other hotels in Vegas. Even so, we'll always have Paris ... at least until somebody builds the Berlin Hotel & Casino next door.

This is Michael Mina at his casual best!  An American pub;  Skeptical poker buds and I walk in ready to be insulted but were pleasantly surprised.  Straight to it, the food.

Remember, Mina is a master of seafood; namely lobster so...

There back!  Lobster corn dogs.  Incredibly sweet chunks of perfectly cooked lobster in a crispy, fluffy, semi sweet corn dog coating with a tangy whole grain mustard and crme fraiche.  Simply put, good eats.

Other starters such as the duck spring rolls with ginger chili dipping sauce, mint and cilantro (excellent with the earthy flavor of moist duck accented by a decent "Asian" dipping sauce that brings forth the flavor of the oily duck meat and a great, light, crisp tempura or maitake mushrooms in a soy, scallion dipping sauce are excellent.  As with all Mina's restaurants, try what sounds different.  While not authentic Asian, still very good flavors.

For larger plates, the Lobster roll with jalapeno creamed corn is excellent.  It's not Northeast authentic but who cares.  Rich, perfectly cooked lobster in a crisp, buttery roll surrounded by a very spicy creamed corn.  The flavor of the jalapeno brings a rich chili taste that contrast well with the sweet, cold water lobster.  The Korean BBQ salmon burger is also good eats.  Soy marinated, cooked medium, and accompanied by cucumber kimchi and ginger aioli is incredibly well balanced.  Complex texture.  Simply delicious.

Great pub style service.  Friendly and correct.

Nice selection of craft cocktails and infusions.  Solid but not too creative beer list.  OK wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.

A worthy replacement for Seablue.

Went there on opening weekend on Saturday.

1.  A billion stair-steps everywhere.  I had fun watching drunk girls trip and fall all over the place.  TROLOLOLOL, loads of laughter.  Someone is going to fall and die and they will get sued and eventually shut down.  You would think being built by Asians, this place would have better engineered walk-ways and lighted staircases, but NOPE.  Instead they hire a bouncer to hold a flashlight to shine each and every staircase.  Kids, this is why you go to college.

2.  Do we really need an Asian themed club?  AS IF THERE AREN"T ENOUGH ASIANS IN VEGAS CLUBS.  Yeah I said it, I'm Asian too, UMAD?  Can we have some diversity?  This way, we won't scare all the White girls and Hispanic girls, you know, the ones actually capable of flirting and talking to strangers instead of the circle jerk AZNs.

3.  No outside patio!!  Some times I just want to connect with a smart girl and stare at her big, beautiful eyes, and tell her my awesome stories instead of just getting bumped by Rotunda and have armpit sweat slapped on my face.  Can't beat XS' outdoor patio.

4.  They don't give out tap water!  The bottle water is 9$!  I didn't come here to drink and get stupid, I came here to flirt, and being the stingy Asian that I am, I think 9$ for water is a really bad deal.  My six pack requires a lot of babysitting and no thanks alcohol.  Asian girls: don't ask me to buy you a drink or if I have a table... especially those of you coming from LA.  It makes you sound really classless and ghetto.  You're not a princess and you're not entitled to free things.  Mommy spoiled you too much.

If you're a nerdy Asian guy who is tired of being BETA and put in the FRIEND ZONE by your rude bitchy Asian female friends and you want to be alpha, aesthetic, and learn how to pick up girls in Vegas or anywhere for that matter, hit me up.  Here is a video of me in Vegas.

I was here shopping in Scottsdale's Old Town just around lunch time. I got hungry so I checked the best place for lunch in the area on Yelp and found The Mission, was highly rated. It was across the street from where I was standing so we headed that way.

When we arrived we were able to get a table in the outside courtyard in the front of the restaurant. We informed the waiter we had very little time for lunch. The three of us ordered margaritas with salt at $8 each. They charged an extra $2 for one with Cointreu. We ordered two Almejas Al Vapor stews for $14 each and one shaved Kale salad for only $10. The shaved kale salad consisted of aji amarillo vinaigrette, baby heirlooms, blood orange, goat cheese & marcona almonds. My friend loves kale. The Almejas Al Vapor is a peruvian clam stew, rock shrimp, chorizo, pan de yucca, aji amarillo & roasted corn. I especially enjoyed the unusual appearance and spice of the stew. See my pic. The stew made me want to go to Peru for some more. I have never been to Peru. 

The waiter was very expeditious in serving us.

My total bill for the three of us for lunch was a very reasonable $69 without gratuities and we were all happy with our meals, margaritas and service.

Swanky Anglicised Cantonese served in a modern, chic Asian inspired dining space.  The food; the dog's bollocks.  Excellent.  Unfortunately combine it's Michelin one star status in London with the typical markup on anything Asian on the Strip, the prices will make you ask if they are taking the piss and leave you gobsmacked. (OK enough British slang).

Not your neighborhood Chinese.  You won't find sweet sour here.  Dishes are individual courses.  Some are meant to be shared, others not.  

On this evening, without looking at the menu, asked the server to just bring our party, some of the best dishes.  The result:

Crispy duck salad.  Incredible balance.  The richness of the duck balanced by the bitterness and acidity of pomolo, earthiness of pine nuts and texture from pomegranate seeds.  

Braised abalone with black truffles.  Soft, tender, impregnated by the sweetness of Chinese wine, the earthy flavor of the truffle the aroma enhances the sweetness of the abalone.  

Peking duck with caviar.  Not the classic Peking duck (this one has some breast meat attached) but wow, soft pancake, pungent scallion and snappy cucumber, crisp duck skin and to top it off, caviar whose oceanic flavor adds an incredible, unexpected complexity. 

A delicate, crisp quail with Chinese five spice and chili sauce, a perfectly roasted Chilean sea bass with Chinese honey whose sweet but bitter notes brings out the natural flavor of the fish, an nontraditional fried and steamed dim sum platter whose freshness, taste, and quality, will put all but the best to shame rounded out the meal.

Service is very efficient and friendly.  The wine list, well chosen.  Typical Vegas resort prices. 

So, $245 for Peking duck, $188 per order of abalone, worth it?  Elevated to this level, bloody well right.

I've always had mixed feelings about the Cheesecake Factory.

I am not much of a cheesecake aficionado, and they have always struck me as an icon of american food excess.  The few times we've eaten in one, we have always left with a bagful of leftovers capable of feeding a third world family for a week.  A slight exaggeration, but not by much I believe.

On the positive side, Cheesecake Factory makes some really interesting and tasty dishes.  I have also found that I have become susceptible to subliminal messages while watching Sheldon and Leonard discuss their BBQ Burger on Big Bang Theory. LOL

So here I was shopping at the Mall and wondering about lunch, when I walked passed Cheesecake Factory and thought of Sheldon and Leonard's discourse.  See link: http://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/series-1-episode-5-the-hamburger-postulate/

So instead of their preferred BBQ Burger, I went with the Classic Burger for $10.50 (see photos). Wow it was huge (maybe a 1/2 lb.) and very, very good. 

A couple months back we were in LVS and had an enjoyable dinner at Gordon Ramsey's "BurGR". This burger is a close second to that carnivorous experience. I'll say it again, wow. 

Cheesecake's Classic Burger is grilled on an open flame and it picks up all that smokey taste from the grill. A nice touch was the sliced grilled red onion which is served on top. 

In summary, an absolutely Four Star Plus experience; and yes I am a Fan. Maybe next time I'll try Sheldon's BBQ Burger. Hmm, I just realized my review feels more like a Chuck Lorre vanity card. LOL

Enjoy!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 43/100

Pretty decent hotel. The only time I've ever stayed here was when I was a child so I don't remember too much of it. 

LOCATION: 
More towards the south end of the strip, across the street from New York New York.

EXTERIOR:
Look for the big green building with the big lion in the front. The entryway/lobby/drop off/pick up area is actually not located directly on the strip, but rather around the corner along the cross street that runs perpendicular to the strip.

INTERIOR:
HUGE HUGE HUGE lobby. Much larger than a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's pretty nice! They also have a pretty decent sized casino as well, and the theater where they host the KA Cirque du Soleil show is surprisingly ginormous. I was so surprised that that size of a theater was inside this hotel. 

SHOPPING:
Unfortunately, the shops at this hotel are pretty crappy. Nothing interesting except for a bunch of souvenir shops, and places where you can get everything bad for you - alcohol and sweets.

I feel like MGM used to be good, but with the addition of all of the newer hotels on the strip, it's losing its game. So unfortunate since MGM owns so many of the hotels on the strip!

I'm sure this place is a great hike. However, I've only been to this mountain for the Lori Piestewa Memorial Services. And that is what this review is about.

I remember what it was like when Lori Piestewa was declared a prisoner or war and how my family got calls from Hopi inlaws asking us to pray in our way for her safe return. There were many things online, in our newspapers and on tv - we were so afraid. And then the inevitable came, the news we didn't want to hear.

I don't know if any of ya'll know this, but Tuba City and the Hopi Nation are small places. Both are tight knit communities where everyone knows one another. And the devistation felt by her loss was incredible. I remember a cousin of mine recalled it as "you could hear the cries in the streets". Every Native in the country probably went to bed hungry that night in honor of her.

And as for the name Squaw. I always knew it was bad. It was something you never said,  you never needed to say it. It was always something terrible. Once when I asked my grandfather what it meant he said "a terrible, terrible woman who's unfit to get married." I later learned that it meant, to his tribe, a women who was raped as a child and was deemed no longer fit to bear children. That was the interrpretation I grew up with and that is how I equate it today. I know of the mainstream meaning of that word, as a derogitory term for a vagina. But know that different tribes view it differently. but all meanings are terrible.

I've only been called a squaw once. and unfortunatly, that person knew what it meant and used it in that context. And inspite of my education, eloquence and empathy - I was nothing but a mere squaw to this person and to this state and so was it's mountian. And I gotta admit, it stung a little to hear Squaw Peak Freeway or Squaw Peak used so... lightly. 

It was a wonderful day to hear Governor Napalitano decide to change the name to honor Lori Piestewa. I found it ironic and fitting. An elder once said, "Jessica may have gotten a movie, but Lori got a mountain!" And though she lost her life fighting for the freedoms of all Americans, she won a major battle in the war against using hurtful names from Indian Country's past to casually name things such as: mountains, sports teams, etc.

This little indian girl who cried when she heard that Woman Warrior died is now a young woman who does what she can to push for change in America - and a big part of what inspires me and other women of color (not just natives) was the renaming of this mountain. This Peak is more than just a place for a great hike, it's the beginning of a movement. I have never forgotten that everytime I've traveled to it's base to honor the woman who inspired the change. And I know this woman, where ever she is, smiles down knowing her daughter doesn't have to live in the same world where she once did - where Native women were constantly being cursed at when asked for directions. Where signs all over a city sliced through you like knives. Where you'd try not to whince whenever a non-native on TV spoke about the traffic. It's a wonderful world, I only wish Lori could see it.

Oh Ma Gawd! Samantha needs to get her sweet little ass to Talavera. Then she would have her best meal so far. This certainly ranks as one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. From the lobby of the masculine Four Seasons (like Ralph Lauren masculine, not Martina Navratilova masculine) to the bar to our own private dining room, everything was simply outstanding. 

Chef Frank Robertson had prepared a special seven course meal for our party, we just had to select our own entree and the decision was agonizing. I went with lobster served with corn, baby squash and cabbage. Perfection! Preceding my entree we had three amuse bouche; Blue Fin Tuna Poke, Sesame, Avocado ; Heirloom Tomato and Burrata, Basil, Orange Olive Oil, Balsamic and I'll be darned if I don't remember the third.

 Did I mention we had predinner cocktails? Belvedere and freshly squeezed grapefruit juice for me and a round of Absolut LA drinks for most of the others. And the wine. It was pouring like Morton salt. My favorite was a Carneros Pinot Noir. Like drinking liquid velvet! Other foodies raved about the filet, the scallops and the sea bass. Prices for entrees ran from high 20s to mid 40s. Worth every penny. Dessert for us were several plates of sweets...small pieces of various delights from truffles to cakes and pecan bites. I felt like Lucy on the chocolate factory line. Dare I say I stashed a few in my cleavage for the ride home? 

Misc:
Service was five stars all the way. Thanks to all who made our party special.
The long fire "pit" outside is fabulous.
Views of the Valley....uh...maze...ing!
Cloth handtowels in the restrooms. Nice touch. Cotton is afterall the fabric of our lives. 
Chocolate does tend to melt when nestled between your shirt and your chest. 

Cheers my yelpitas. Here's to a fabulous winter in Arizona!

If you're looking to be wow'ed by a Las Vegas buffet, look elsewhere, toots.

The Feast Buffet located in the Palace Station Hotel & Casino is very affordable for those looking not to spend a lot of money for an AYCE.  Here's my 2 cents on my mealtimes, in chronological order-

Lunch - A step-down from your local Hometown Buffet.  There is a grill where diners can ask for slices of roast beef/turkey, burgers, hot dogs & brats.  Located next to it, is a pasta station where pasta is made to order with whatever choice ingredients the diner desires.  The rest of the hot/cold foods were decent, but nothing extraordinary.  The dessert section was nice w/ various cakes, cookies, sweets and the obligatory nonfat froyo machines.  Overall, meh.

Dinner - See lunch, but w/ a few extra items scattered hither & thither.  Not worth the extra cost, IMHO.

Breakfast -  Now we're talking!  Several egg dishes, mounds of bacon, biscuits & gravy, country fried steak etc.  There is also an omelette station where diners can have an omelette their way.  The dessert section had most of the same items from lunch/dinner, plus various doughnuts and other items.  

The Feast Buffet is an affordable, no-frills buffet.  I recommend breakfast over lunch & dinner for those interested in checking this buffet out.  I had free buffet vouchers, but if I had to pay, I would stick to breakfast.

Excelsior!

We came here recently, when a friend bought us a couples massage.  Our most recent visit brought back all my memories of this great Hyatt locale, just minutes from our front door. 

As I've previously noted, with some minor updating: "The rooms here are amazing, as are the guest services. Looking for Spa Day? Well this Hyatt is the place!  Looking for a beautiful sunset dinner by a fire pit?  No question, then you have to come here.  

If you are lucky to be a Diamond Club member, their Regency Club is one of the best in the world.  I would rank this Hyatt alongside Brenner's Park in Baden Baden; the Savoy or Jumeirah Carlton Tower in London for WOW factor. Simply outstanding!  Stay and enjoy the sunsets and Gondola ride after dinner!"

Our couples massage began with a relaxed, tranquil time outside in their shaded portico (photo), sipping cucumber and fruited mineral water, overlooking the Spa's private pool. 

After a few minutes, we were escorted to our room by two massage therapists to select our scented oils. The hour slipped by ever so slowly and was over before we realized it. Wow, they were very professional and made us feel renewed

But that wasn't the end of our visit. Again we returned to the portico and some quiet time by the pool. One of our friends who was also here for a Spa Day soon joined us. We enjoyed some delicious flavored teas for the rest of the afternoon and some good conversation. The shopping in the Hyatt, though small is excellent. 

As noted before, "...we have stayed at this Hyatt Regency many times when we lived elsewhere.  But now that we live in the valley, it has become a fun place to go for dinning (See: Alto Ristorante e Bar and SWB Southwest Bistro)."  

Come, eat, relax, stay, visit; you'll be glad you did!  Five Stars, simply the best!

Enjoy!!

About a year and a half ago Yelp hosted a Non-Profit "Yelp Helps" evening downtown in Phoenix.  It was an incredible event that in some ways changed my family's life.  

You see, after putting on my name tag and riding the elevator up to the event, I was greeted by our Yelp Community Manager Lindsey, who in short order handed me the cutest Chihuahua named Christian.

Christian was so small and clearly very frightened by all the noise.  I walked around the various organization booths, stopping at the Lost Our Home area while hold Christian.  At some point Lindsey asked for him back; and sadly, I said my goodbyes to the little guy.  

The next day, I found myself searching on-line for the Lost Our Home website.  Looking over their requirements and of course, the pups.  Don't get me wrong, I call all dogs pups.  And guess what?  I found a cute little Morkie  named "Chloe" on their Adoptions page.  See photos.

A Morkie, I learned, is a Maltese and Yorkie mix.  I made a few phone calls and arranged for one of the Volunteers to stop by my home with Chloe to see if she would feel comfortable with our other dog, Oliver and our two cats.

That Sunday, Chloe arrived and she seemed to fit in really well. After the volunteer left we had our family discussion and it was a go!  Later that week we adopted Chloe and she was dropped off at my office soon after.

What you need to know, is how straight forward and easy a process adopting a "foreclosure" animal is from Lost Our Home.  They have many Veterinarian who offer their services on a per diem/pay as you can basis.  It will change your life.  trust me!

BTW, they are looking for Volunteers.  Hint. Hint.

The Better Half and I visited this place for the 1st time last week.  I am a huge fan!  Here's why:

- Easy access off of Harmon Ave, which is off the Strip.

- The property has two entrances on the Strip.  You can sit at a bar or slot machine and have an awesome view of the street level of the Strip.  I bet this will be a great spot on NYE!

- I love the design and decor of the property (see pics).  Chandeliers, various designs in different areas of the casino floor are very impressive.  The artwork here is great too and all over the place.....you have to see it for yourself!

- Jason the Jeweler (designer of the Lakers' 2010 Championship Ring) has a store here.

- Although we didn't eat here, the food options look great.  We want to come back and try Holsteins & STK.

- The employees are very friendly and have a great attitude.  I know they just opened and you should expect that, but believe me it's hard to find that attitude here in Vegas.

- Parking was easy.  The self-parking garage is underground and has the meters that show you how many spaces are available on each level, bonus.

- The bars & lounges here are very cool.  We had drinks at Bond and the Chandelier Lounge.  Both places were comfortable and provided great people watching seats.

Overall, we enjoyed the place and have a bunch of places we want to come back and try out.  I hope they make it in this economy.

Will I return?  Are you crazy?  Of course I will!

Found out through Shannon E. The Fractured Prune's Grand Opening was today, and wasted no time hustling over on my break! 

Apparently, some other guy didn't either: "I drove all the way out here from Apache Junction for a dozen!" 

When I walked in I was immediately greeted by Marilyn. She talked me through their custom donut process: Selecting a custom glaze and toppings before handing off your card to a doughnut designer.

Think combinations like Dreamsicle, Chocolate Covered Cherry, Maple Bacon. 

Decided on two Mint Chocolate Chip doughnuts: One for me to scarf down at work, one for Andrew C for later. 

Because he might murder me later for going alone. 

And I'm not a self-centered, lameface lady friend. Doing "Nice things" goes both ways, ladies. 

These donuts aren't sitting around in a case, either. Custom means made when you order. 

Got back to work and took a bite. Still piping hot, minty, chocolatey, practically melting in my mouth as I ate it. 

This is really a four star review masquerading as a five star: I love the custom concept; however, I'm more of a "classic doughnut" gal: Think Old Fashioned Kruller with some chocolate on it. 

The customer service is what bumped the rating up to five stars! 

Now go, take a doughnut break. Meanwhile, I'll resist inhaling Dude's while waiting for him to pick it up!

A chip collector?   Are you a gambler?  A semi pro Vegas historian?

Then Spinettis is the shop for you.
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=WCyD3030jgcUJSpCJ-jgig&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

I have a friend who is an avid chip collector, he has cases of them, really cool display. He asked me to call him from Spinettis and let him talk to the guy there. Happy to help a friend in need.  I watched the guy started pulling a bunch of old $5 chips from the case and handed me back the phone. "Are there 17of them" my friend asked? I counted..1.2.3.4... Yup. " OK pay him $425 for the lot". WTF I thought for less than $100 wort of chips! My friend is a nut!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/spinettis-home-gaming-supplies-las-vegas-2#TeeFv031vYLnN7cmjtNqDA

But as I looked at the chips and the hundreds of others I could see the appeal. These were some pretty unique chips with some cool artwork. I liked an Elvis one the best.

The guy working the chips was very nice and must really know his stuff, I certainly got a education on the chip collection game. He told me there are people with thousands of them and some go for mega bucks (thousands!). Sorry I left camera in the store. Borrowed these.

They got other stuff for collectors from ash trays to dice to cards from various LV casinos. 

They also have anything you may need to transform your house into a mini casino. Tables, chips, cards, dice, shufflers even bingo supplies, so rush on over there and get yourself in on some of the lucrative casino bucks. Why should Italians and Indians have all the fun?

So if collecting stuff like this floats your boat give this place a try, I'm sure you can find something for your collection too.

I love this place!  I noticed a lot of people there and wondered if it was worth the trip.  I wasn't disappointed.  On the day I went, I had a vegieburger and it was really good, came with a salad and blue chips. I brought half of it home and had the other half for dinner.  I also ordered a drink that was cherry and chocolate (delicious).  I am a big fan and would go more but it is a little expensive.  Also took a slice of the chocolate pomegranate cake (their signature dish) and it was really outstanding.  I shall return!

The absence of flaw in beauty is itself a flaw.

I was in Phoenix for 17 hours a couple of days ago.  

It was a perfectly warm day outside, one of those beautiful early fall days in the desert when the sun bathes everything in clear, comforting sunlight.  It felt great just walking around Kierland Commons in the warm, late afternoon sunshine. 

My friend chose her favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix, Shogun, for dinner.  We got there fairly early and sat at the sushi bar.  Looking around, I noticed that I was the only Buddhahead in the restaurant (and I'm only half-Asian).  "This can't be a good sign", I thought.  Don't' get me wrong:  I don't believe that a restaurant operator's ethnicity must match the culinary heritage of the food he serves.  This can't be right.  Food, like human compassion and friendship, transcends race and ethnicity.  

My friend ordered most of the items off the menu.  We started with a Sunshine Roll, which was heaping mounds of spicy tuna loaded onto a modified California Roll.  The sauce for the spicy tuna was heavily mayonnaise based, which was a bit odd.  It was different, but tasty and original.

The Wahoo Sashimi in ponzu sauce with sliced cucumbers was light and delicate.  Wahoo is ono in Hawaii and is a white fish that is mild and slightly sweet.  It went well with the citrus ponzu.  

The Veggie Roll was odd in that the ingredients didn't blend together at all.  It consisted of cooked asparagus, some kind of weird takuan (pickled daikon radish) that was a bit bitter, kimpira gobou (burdock root), and shisou (mint leaf).  All the wasabi and gari in the world couldn't fix this roll. 

We also had Shake Sushi (Salmon Sushi), Octopus Salad, and some edamame.

The sushi here was so far off the beaten path that the tastes were a bit off, they were almost uncomfortable to my palate.  But, it's good to try different styles of food in different settings.

Food doesn't have to be perfect, or authentic, to be enjoyable.

When I tell people where I grew up they often respond with "I didn't know people grew up in Las Vegas." True, it's a transient town but whenever I get together with fellow natives I find it hard to resist the pull of the buffet. 

This much I've learned: Atlantans have fried chicken. New Yorkers have bagels. Bostonians have lobster rolls. And we Las Vegans have the buffet. Though I managed to be in LV for less than 48 hours, I made sure a trip to the buffet with a couple of old friends was on my itinerary.

On Sunday morning we waited about 20 minutes in line for the chance to gorge ourselves on prime rib, mashed potatoes, creamy corn chowder, soft serve ice cream with Butterfinger pieces on top, shrimp, roast turkey with gravy, slices of cheese, sushi, grapefruit segments, champagne and a lot more that I cannot recall at the present moment.

But as I dug into my plate I looked across the table at my friends and said, "Now I feel like I'm home. . ."

I drank the punch, now after five visits, I'm either have an addiction or I'm a fan.

From the city that invented a Fre Kin Gud sushi roll and yum yum sauce springs Yonaka Modern.  The food is playful.  A fusion of Japanese / Peruvian / Argentinian cuisine popularized by Nobu Matsuhisa.  From the flavors to the presentation, this is the poor man's Matsuhisa (Beverly Hills, LA).  Oh yeah, it's good!

Dishes deliver a punch.  No monochromatic plates here.  Bold flavors that try to push the boundaries of sweet, sour, bitter in a single dish.  Excellent use of texture.  It is not uncommon to have a deep fried leaf sitting atop a piece of delicate fish.

Order an assortment of small plates and share.  

I won't ruin the "joy of discovery", besides the menu changes as specials come and go.  One day, teriyaki foie nigiri topped with candied quinoa, live uni another,   The menu staple, deep fried Brussels sprouts with lemon, chili, mint, and puffed rice is amazing.  It looks a mess but as a dish, it's comforting. Vegetal, sweet, sour, bitter; the perfect match to beer.  Ingredients are fresh and seasonal.

All nigiri sushi comes with a twist.  A sauce of this, an unusual garnish of that (hamachi with a spicy jalapeo miso and a cilantro leaf; unagi with togarashi and a leaf of Thai basil).  The rice is good and the fish fresh. Go crazy, order one of each.

Service is very good; friendly and attentive.  Prices are very reasonable.  Two happy hours (17:00-18:30 / 23:00-02:00) make it even more inviting.

One of the best in Vegas on or off the Strip.

Potbelly's makes a tasty little sandwich for $4.80, and an even better one for $5.00.

I was here today with some friends for their Pre- Grand Opening slated for tomorrow. A suggested donation of $5.00 went to Scottsdale Christian Academy Baseball Team (see photo). After giving my donation, I won a free shake on their spinning wheel.  All the places were food items.

Potbelly is a yummy Midwest sandwich place that has live music in all of their shops.  The older locations have tall ceiling where a banjo, or guitar player sits on the top of the booth area while playing away.  This location has a guitar playing in the corner on the right as you come in. Very cool.

As for the food, Potbelly is known primarily for their their Wreck sub which is $5.00.  It's made with salami, roast beef, turkey and ham along with swiss cheese. They also have two similar subs called:  "Italian" with capicola, mortadella, pepperoni, salami with provolone cheese, also $5.00; and a "Pizza Sandwich" which has many of the above cold cuts but with marinara sauce.  I've had both before and they are good too.

Those are their three upscale sandwiches for $5.00, but their regular ones for $4.80 are equally good.  I particularly like the Roast Beef (which I had today, see photo), but the Turkey Breast, Smoked Ham, Meatball are all delicious.  
  
I've been told by Jim their JV Manager, that their 30% larger sandwiches, called "Bigs", will be rolled out later in the year.  Nice. You also need to try their hand-dipped shakes and smoothies. Delicious!

Enjoy!

I appreciate French food and like it more than I should. 

I also love NOLA and their Laissez les bons temps roulern!

But, the French Grocery is really not a grocery store at all. You cannot buy any grocery items, like you might find in a typical Champion or Carrefour. No Carte Noire coffee, no Maille moutardes, et cetera

They also do not cook, nor serve food here.  Everything is pre-made, wrapped for sale and kept in a refrigeration case. The only exception is the bakery items and a small chilled salad deli case. 

When we arrived on Friday just before five, there were also very few items left in the refrigerator. There was no croissants, no french bread or much of anything in the bakery case except for some small $1.75 cookies.

There were a couple of small individual Quiche Lorraines (which didn't contain any bacon or ham) and a few small baguette sandwiches, like you would find in Gare du Nord. 

The French Bakery also has a wine section, along with a few French press coffee pots. As others have noted, the lighting is poor and makes the store feel dreary. There are a few tables scattered in this cavernous store. But I am unsure what they are used for since you cannot sit and eat any of the chilled items. 

I believe the French Grocery is set up to appeal to working couples on the go --who want something more interesting than the Take Out selection of Fresh & Easy.  Of the six items we ordered, the best was the chocolate Pot de Creme for $3.50. Our total including tax came to $32.11

But if you come to the French Grocery thinking of Le Pain Quotidien, Le Madeleine, or even local Amuse Bouche (Surprise), you might leave disappointed.   Sorry!

Our original posting was deleted by Yelp. Now this posting went from being "recommended" to currently hidden at the bottom of the "not recommended" reviews... So far, 21 users thought it was useful. Why are you hiding my review, Yelp? Could it be because I gave a NEGATIVE review based on my OWN experience? So much for being able to trust your site for unbiased reviews.
*********

Our previous review was deleted by Yelp for "violating their guidelines" so I'll post another review that only relates to our personal experience with their boarding facility.

We used Green Acre Boarding in Oct of 2013 for a 3 night stay. This place was presented as a great place for dogs... Free roam and lots of kids to play with your pups.  

This seemed like a great scenario for our 1yr old golden but our 11 year old sheltie just needed a safe place to stay. When I dropped our dogs off, I told MaLeisa that our sheltie didn't enjoy playing with other dogs (she would run away from her own loving, gentle, golden retriever brother at home) and that she just needed a quiet place to rest & observe during her stay. I was assured by MaLeisa they could accommodate that and that she would be fine.

Upon picking up our dogs we were told by MaLeisa that our sheltie "was playing in the yard with another dog and having a great time and next thing she knew, Todd was carrying her in because she had blood on her." Our dog had blood oozing from her ear, cuts across her face, was dry heaving and could barely walk. (And, "they had already washed her.") Our Sheltie collapsed in exhaustion once we got her into our vehicle. Unfortunately, our sweet girl had to be put down the following week as she never fully recovered from her injuries. 

Green Acres makes you sign a contract saying your dog will be dehydrated and exhausted upon returning home but that these are all normal results of a boarding experience. Add to that your dog will reek (which was explained away as being from the flood irrigation they use.) 

We had already pre-booked another stay at Green Acre for later in the month but obviously cancelled that stay after the injuries to our sheltie. I'm sickened and sad that I ever entrusted my dogs to the care of Green Acre.

We had Melman bucks. So we came for dinner. Just four of us. But holy shit. They fed us like we we're three hundred pound men. Don't get me wrong. I love food. But there's enough, and there's just too much. We split a pasta as a first course. It was adequate, taste wise. But portion wise? How one person could even think of ordering it for dinner is beyond me. I would blow up. Wafer thin? I think not.

We followed with baked clams which were pretty darned good. I like to put a little finely grated lemon rind and romano in my homemade version. I tasted both in theirs. I may sue.

We moved on to a chicken saltimbucca, which was actually quite good. We followed with a salad. I could see the dissapointment in the servers face. When we only asked for espresso after, she seemed sad. 

I almost felt sorry for her. I guess she's used to people who live a week off the leftovers. We did, however, enjoy some very nice wine. So I think that may have made her feel a little better.

What a great surprise, just around the corner from a closed Baja Fresh is Caf Rio Mexican Grill 

There's no comparison to that former Wendy's Mexican food concept. Cafe Rio is the real deal. 

We came here for lunch and then, since we were working late we came back to grab something for dinner.  It's crazy good.  It also wasn't as packed, but the food was really good. 

As you enter, you'll see that standard Mexican cantina decor. Tin lights with punch holes (photo) in them. Bright, very bright painted tables and beautifully made iron stone plates hanging on the walls. All very familiar, but nicer than you've seen before in other places.

After a few visits now, I've ordered most item on the menu.  My favorite?  Their Burrito, Enchilada style ($7.99) with spicy sauce and cheese on top.  Yummy!.  They have that homemade press (photo) working non-stop.  The Burrito stretches to fit, since it's so fresh and the dough hasn't become hard.  Love it.

Their Tacos ($2.99) are also good, as is their Guacamole ($1.99).  But you have to try their Lime-aide drink.  It tastes like a virgin Mojito!  BYOB I guess. LOL

Now I realize this is a chain, and therefore it might not be for everyone, but... a lunch here for $10.00, is a nice alternative to that other place with the corrugated stainless steel fetish.  You know who I mean.

Enjoy!

Dateline 7 May 2009
Scottsdale, Arizona

    Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S.  Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, "That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff."

    Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, "I really like the onion naan."  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.

    The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was "...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger."  This has not substantiated, however.

    Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was "Yummy."

    Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.

    An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.

    Jim W's blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; "...ears haven't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.  I really liked the food but I wouldn't go back on a night when they have dancing again."

A taste of the old country; yep, New York City circa 1890.  The ultimate expression of what many have come to know as Italian or rather I-talian (emphasis on the I and meaning no disrespect) food in the US.  It's origins in Naples, but long since corrupted for American taste and bounty.  The Italian spirit and passion for sharing good food lives on.

Rao's is a fun place to mangia!  Example one, ginormous meatballs the size of your fist.  Flavorful, Perfectly cooked, tender, balls bathed in a hearty red sauce.  A great blend of fatty beef, pork, and lean veal the right amount of breadcrumb filler.  Example two, spaghetti alla Bolognese, a pile of noodles hidden under a thick meaty, flavor charged sauce.

Classic starters.  Baked clams, rich with butter and crisp breadcrumbs, dried herbs and a kiss of lemon; the fritto misto (calamari, shrimp, cod, and zucchini) a slightly crisp, slightly oily, aggressively seasoned; the sauted mussels, sweet and tender sauted in butter then quickly steamed in white wine and garlic.  No complaints.

Classic mains.  Outstanding veal chop served smothered with Rao's classic sauce of mildly spicy, sweet cherry peppers.  Subtle flavor of tender veal along side the clean, pepper flavor and zesty tomato sauce.  It heightens the sweetness of the veal.  Win!  Veal not your thing?   The same sauce tops a tender grilled shell steak (Steak Pizzaiola) and a thick, juicy, double cut pork chop.  The Ossobuco, delicious.  Well braised, tender without being stringy.  A good portion of bone marrow a nice touch.  Finally "Uncle Vincent's Lemon Chicken; charbroiled marinated in a lemon olive oil mixture and finished in the same.  Tart, sweet, bitter, classic.

Portions are large.  

Very good wine list focusing on Italy.  Typical high Vegas resort pricing.

Service is very friendly and efficient.  Exactly what you would expect from an I-talian restaurant from NYC.  Well done.

Best way to relax in Vegas before your flight home! They definitely know how to pamper you here. Two words: Free B&B (Buffet & Booze).

The lunch/dinner buffet offers light, delicious options. The highlight for me were the super tender **Braised Short Ribs** served over slow-cooked creamy polenta. Warm, savory, and juicy! Also delightful were the **Spinach & Ricotta Gnudi**, perfect little dumplings with a dash of tomato and basil. A fresh corn salad, roasted zucchini, and arugula salad were flavorful and healthy side dishes. The **Vanilla Honey Panna Cotta with Summer Berries** gave the meal a smooth finish.

A whole array of cocktails welcomes you at the bar. Just take your pick and go relax. Love this perk!

You can get some work done in the conference area or in one of the more private work booths. Or sit back and watch TV in the lounge area. Or take a sweet nap on the comfy reclining personal couches. We opted for #3 -- nap.

The decor is very mod and clean, while the setting is quiet and relaxing. My only complaint is that at one point, two employees began talking pretty loudly in Spanish. The serene vibe was slightly ruined, but I was already so content on my cozy napping device that I dozed off anyway.

Overall the service was phenomenal. You will want for nothing.

TIP: Open to AmEx members only. One-day passes are $50, or complimentary for Platinum members. Thank you, travel buddy!

My friend and I have wanted to go to the Butterfly Wonderland for a while and the time came to go! We met up on a Sunday morning and got our ticket to check them out!  

What does Butterfly Wonderland got going for them? Well they are the only butterfly atrium in the valley and they say they are America's largest butterfly atrium too. , they say the butterflies inside the conservatory come from butterfly farmers from Costa Rica, Malaysia, Ecuador, Thailand & the Philippines as well as within the US and another fun fact Arizona is home to 344 species of butterflies.  Here comes the sticker shock: its 18.95 plus tax which equals to 20.26 I think it was.  

Once you pay your ticket you walk inside and have to wait in a hallway because you will be directed to watch a 14 minute movie on the migration of the Monarch Butterfly in 3D, we had to wait a few minutes because there was a show already playing.  The movie is cool; you follow a year in the life of a few Monarchs. 

Once your movie is over you are shown into the conservatory, now this is where the fun is it, so many amazing beautifies fluttering around, some look like they are in a game of tag, some just seeing what everyone else is up to, if you stand still and make small movements you might be blessed to have a few land on you, also was told if you wear bright colors they will be attracted to you too, You are not allowed to hold out your hand or try to touch them, but they are allowed to land on you.  I had a few land on me and also had a few fly too close to my face and gave me a butterfly smack or too! Haha  I could spend hours in the conservatory just watching the butterflies enjoying the sun light.

A few things, the conservatory is a tropical rain forest, its humid and misting water is happening, so dress for the rain forest, leave your bags & purses in the car, no need for all that, watch where you are walking the butterflies land everywhere and just make sure you don't step on them. Also inside the conservatory you will see a Koi fish pond, I thought that was cool but also thought hey don't they eat bugs that might land on the water,aawwee poor butterflies that became fish food .

Once you leave the conservatory you go into a smaller room and check to see if you are smuggling any butterflies, and I know that sounds funny, but there were a few that tried to escape before we went through the door. 

Then you get to check a cool ant farm, some fishes and other stuff, and even stick your hand in a tank to touch a sting ray, and yes I did that, but I have fed sting rays before too, it's a cool experience.

This was an enjoyable time, we spent maybe 2 hours enjoying everything, do I feel its worth the 20 buck entry fee, no I don't, but will I be a sucka and do it again yep I will haha.

Why does everything have to be SO BIG?! Usually we Yelpers don't complain about that (ha!), but in this case it's just ridiculous. Not to mention the potential for inducing heart attacks is immeasurably increased. It must be part of the appeal / gimmick, but too bad larger sizes don't translate to better food quality.

We were here for breakfast at 8 AM after a long night of partying and gambling (we hadn't slept yet) so at this point everything * should * have tasted good, right?

My Grilled Cheese with ham was hearty and a decent size -- thankfully not a monstrosity. The "Hash Browns" were more like a plateful of overcooked potato chunks, most of which were too hard in texture to eat. The "Side of Bacon" turned out to be an overflowing platter of much-too-crunchy, strange looking meat strips.

Service was friendly when we arrived, but seemed more hassled as the room began filling up for breakfast. 

All in all, an okay experience but would only come back for convenience (a.k.a. when staying at the Mirage and cannot make it to a restaurant outside the hotel).

TIP: Size isn't everything.

DATE TIP: Size isn't everything. Wait, what?! I'm talking about the sandwiches!

Surreal pool party experience. Vegas does it unlike anywhere else, and Wet Republic is no exception when it comes to getting WET!

So you know what you're getting into:

1) Getting tickets in advance substantially cuts down waiting time.
2) Arriving early (before 1pm) does the same.
3) Cabanas cost $1,500.
4) There are lockers available to stow your stuff.
5) The bar sells drinks in enormous lidded cups. Get these and you won't regret it when the splashing starts! Unless you like chlorine as part of your alcoholic mix.
6) It is calm and beautiful when you arrive early and hardly anyone is there. It gets increasingly more chaotic and cramped up through peak pool time (~3pm).

* * * Now, so you know what you're REALLY getting into: * * *

Be prepared for a poppin' party. And when I say poppin', I mean POPPIN'. Super crowded, off the chain, dope beats, crazy splashing. Beach balls are constantly flying, some that may come your way and bonk you on the head while you are distracted, completely unaware. Good thing they're only beach balls! Then the huge inflated whales start coming out. These are much heavier than the beach balls and have more of an impact on your head. But everyone is too busy dancing and having fun to care. NOTE: You can't ride the whales. You can try, but it's impossible.

By the time the headliner DJ (Steve Aoki) takes over, it becomes so rowdy both outside and inside the pool. Outside the pool, a large crowd is clamoring up by the DJ booth. Aoki sprays the crowd with champagne and even throws a large cake with white frosting at them. He is carried overhead by the crowd. Rafts and inflatable animals (flamingos, ducks, and monkeys) are deployed. It's a hot, hot mess on land!

In the pool there is so much splashing that tidal waves are straight up rolling. One guy was so ecstatic to be in the pool that as he thrashed around, he brought his hand down (with his phone) hard onto my forearm. Thanks for the enormous bruise! Of course I didn't feel it until the next morning, probably because of the booze and adrenaline. Before I know it, 4 hours have passed and the drinks and music are still flowing. Wet Republic sure knows how to make it last!

TIP: Be ready to party. Go hard or go home!

DATE TIP: You can most certainly find a date here. Enormous margaritas + dancing in the water + people in swimsuits? Oh yeah, no doubt.

This is a nice new watering hole for the area, which serves some Mexican inspired pub grub. 

We came for Happy Hour around 5 on a Saturday afternoon. Granted, it was probably unfair of us to come here after last week's foodie extravagance at Gallo Bianco in Phoenix.  But we found the food good and the drinks cold, always a plus. 

The atmosphere is a cross between a sports bar and a Mexican beach cantina. They have a large bar area which extends out onto the sidewalk. You can sit on bar stools outside, on a ceramic window area and still see the game on their two HDTVs inside. 

Salt and Lime is a bar where Dos Equis Lager, Corona Light or Modelo Dark are on tap for $4.00 and come in a pint glass, while their small wine list was $7 a glass. Salt & Lime doesn't carry or serve Sangria. They also had several margaritas on the menu starting at $6 and going up from there. 

The food was good and what you would expect. We started with Guacamole for $5.50 (photo) and shared an order of Nachos ($8.50).  The guacamole had some mango through it, which made it interesting; while the nachos were drizzled with several different types of cheeses. Not bad for bar food. 

Since these appetizers were filling, we ordered some Empanadas ($5.25) and a couple of Tacos for $3.25 each. The empanadas came with shredded chicken(photo) but were overly doughy and had a flour after-taste. The Carne Asada tacos were good, but admittedly we were spoiled from last week's adventure at Gallo. 

The bill came to $42.75 plus taxes and gratuities, so expect to pay $27 each unless you're very thirsty. LOL. 

We found Salt & Lime Three Stars, A-Okay

In my previous life in education, I heard so much about changing our ideas--our culture--and I always thought it was so much happy horse shit! When I read Tony Hsieh's book "Delivering Happiness" and I saw the word culture so much, it gave me dja vu all over again.  (Thanks Yogi)  After my tour of Zappos today, I get it and how it works for this company.  

You sign up online for the tour.  Parking is in the Zappos' garage off Las Vegas Boulevard before Stewart.  You go to the second floor, sign in with the person in the lobby, and wait for your tour.  You're given an ID badge and a name tag.  Several culture reps divide the group and take you to see Zappos at work.  My culture person was Rene and she was a gem!  She was always happy to be asked a question and she had the answers for us.

We saw some of the call center, the culture section where employees were dealing with customers either online or on the phone.  We got to see the Z Caf and the employee patio.

I am sure that the employees are not always smiling and not always happy, but I did see a whole bunch of people who seemed to be happily doing their jobs in a relaxed, informal setting and the idea of culture that Mr. Hsieh has been so focused on works!

The tour lasts just about an hour.  You are free to bring your camera and take photos.  The only thing they ask is that you don't take photos of computer screens (it might have customer information on it or other things that should remain private) and they ask that there be no video.

This is a tour that would be interesting for anyone to take.  It's amazing to see what they did to the old Las Vegas City Hall.

A seductive female devil sporting a two piece bikini, thigh high boots and a pitch fork surrounded by flames & palm trees got my attention.  While staying at the Monte Carlo on Las Vegas Blvd we thought we hit the jackpot having a Diablo's Cantina attached to the hotel.    

The food was kick-ass, I will give them that.  The guacamole was creamy, packed with just the right amount of heat and was topped with diced tomatoes & a sprinkle of fresh sea salt.  We also ordered the chicken nachos, holy shit they were huge.   They had to have weighed at least 5 pounds.  Fresh crisp tortilla chips layered with melted cheese, shredded chicken and lines of sour cream.  Seated at the tables closest to the side walks enjoying the people watching we were spotted by a couple we knew and they joined us for some drinks.  They asked the server to bring us another round clearly saying that the round was on them.  The server not only charged them, but when we received our bill, we were also charged for the same drinks.  I explained to her that you already charged the couple who left for those drinks, and as good as they were I did not lose track of how many $7.50 margaritas I drank.  She then played dumb and sent over the manager.  The manager showed up running his mouth like he wanted to fight. Already having had several drinks & knowing how little the LVPD tolerates patrons beating up a manager of a bar no matter how rude and obnoxious he was, I simply smiled, stiffed the waitress on the tip & left.

Until the incident with the blatant double charging of the drinks and the unnecessary attitude from the manager I thought the food, drinks & atmosphere were 5 stars!! Just a heads up to Diablo's staff, dumb clueless servers who hustles there customers with her pimp like manager's support gets you very few stars.

Woof woof, *pant*, *pant*, *pant*, woof woof  (I'll get back to this).

Keeping it real, this is an eatery created by a marketing group for a TV personality rather than a chef driven restaurant.  Words like fresh, farm raised, organic are replaced by outta bounds, awesome, righteous,  slam dunk, mack daddy.  The flavors are very bold, bordering on over the top.  Most components of a dish compete rather than compliment.    Not a big deal if you spent the evening smoking a couple of cigars or killed your pallet on a packs of cigs.

For "shareable",  respectable "sashimi won-taco" (fried won ton skin shaped like a taco shell filled with ahi mixed with a mango jicama salsa and topped with an odd sweetened soy and a wasabi aioli).  Passable but the aioli adds a flabbiness to the dish and obscures the flavor of the fish.  The "fondue dippers" are bizarre.  Breadsticks are wrapped in pepperoni then self dipped into a fondue of  oil stabilized provolone, sausage, and tomato.  Fans of a greasy pizza will be right at home.

On to the sandwiches and burgers:

"Come Rod.  Come here boy.  Sit.  Awww that's a good boy.  Now shake hands.  Awww Rod's a good doggie".

Contrary to what my ex might say, I'm not a dog.  I don't expect my meal to be tossed on a plank, burger falling over, only half on the bun, toppings and sauce spilling everywhere and fries thrown on for good measure.

A "big dipper" features tender slices of prime rib, smothered by melting pepper jack cheese, topped by over seasoned deep fried onions in a garlic spread with excessive, bitter horseradish.  Impossible to pick up, grease and oil mask the flavor of the beef.  The "off-da-hook smash burger" sports a decent mix of beef but obliterated by the cloyingly sweet, excessive bourbon bbq sauce.  They claim the bun is brioche, honestly the sauce kills the taste buds.  Finally the "mac-n-cheese bacon burger"  Cloying, greasy, way over the top.  The overstuffed burger is impossible to pickup and messy to eat.  A side of flavorful but soggy fries accompanies all selections.

Props for service.  Fast and attentive.  

Great for the Vegas tourist looking for the show.  Locals and regulars look elsewhere.

Taking up residence where Ivan Kane's Forty Deuce used to be is the newest Speakeasy to hit the strip. There's something fun and exciting about entering through a secret door and needing a password to get in. 

I wasn't sure of the stats on the place, so I had called Mandalay Bay box office and the woman had no info to give me, I wasn't sure if we needed tickets prior, or if we purchase there, I then searched the actual 1923 website and didn't get any info there as well. I ended up speaking with concierge and she was the most helpful, this is the info I can pass along to others:

*No cover charge for locals
*$20 cover for non-locals 
*If you're interested in getting a table, you can email info@1923lv.com and they should get back to you within 24 hours.

If you show up around 10p and get yourself a seat at the bar, you'll have a perfect view for the stage, the entire place only holds 150 people, and the place got packed really quick, there were no seats or anywhere to stand by 11. Holly Madison performs 3 times nightly, and the shows run from 11p-2a. 

Jazz band plays intermittently throughout the night as well as a house DJ. They have a small specialty cocktail menu, Pisco Sour included. Our bartender, Marvin, was able to create a cocktail off menu by us telling him what our likes are. 

They have a cigar room in the back and they also sell them at the bar. They do allow smoking in the lounge, and it did get pretty smokey between the cigarettes and cigars, so be warned. 

I loved the burlesque dancers, the 1920's inspired outfits of the cocktails waitresses and bartenders were classy, and the prohibition style cocktails were good. I'd for sure come back.

I love art in all forms--paintings, sculpture, poetry, song, and dance.  I am a "FIRM" believer in supporting artists because they try to tell us a story--through their eyes.  On Saturday, my friend and I stuffed our faces with bacon wrapped hot dogs at Echo Park for Javier's Bacon Wrapped Goodness UYE.  Afterwards, we had nothing to do and thought why not go out and support our starving artists--it's all about giving back.  Lets go to Vegas!!

Service - Woohoo! As good as it gets! + soft and silky skin
Cleanliness - Ambiguous
Price - Enough!
Seafood - Yes, some people refer it to that.
Meats - Yes, yes, yes!!
Vegetables - I think this costs extra.
Dessert - Yes it is.
Fruits - Forbidden fruit?

What was ordered:

"Stoner" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - This Anglo artist told me that she works better inebriated.  I was interested enough to purchase her body of work for my friend--who was also inebriated.  As Stoner revealed her art, she yelled out "And they are all natural!!"  I am "technically" a doctor since I was a Biological Science major as an undergrad and I have some expertise in human anatomy.  The mammary were indeed natural and quite a stunning pair.
 
"Ms. Foodie" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - This Asian artist hails from Arizona and is a recent transplant to Las Vegas.  Her and I had a thorough conversation regarding food.  She loves food trucks because the food is so tasty, cheap, and is convenient in her line of work.  "The Foodie" also loves breakfast and a big fan of dumplings.  She loves to dance to Trance music.  Her body of art is all natural and very inspiring--Frida Kahlo would love her work.

"Frisco" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - "Frisco" is from the Norcal region--San Jose to be exact.  I told her I went to school in Sacramento.  "Frisco" found it amusing that Sacramento rhymed with Frisco.  She chose the name Frisco because it sounded sexier than San Jose.  She loves to dance to Trance music.  Her body of work is all natural--and all so buttery smooth.  "Frisco" told me she is selective with her clients--must be my innocent eyes.  She gave me a kiss on the cheek and told me to go find her later.

"Brazil" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - "Brazil" comes from the lovely country of Brazil.  She loves soccer.  I told her "Soccer?!  You must mean "futbol."  She was very impressed that I knew that--Brazil told me that my name is spelled Joan in Brazilian--accent on the "a."  I asked her what is her favorite food in Brazil and she told me bbq meat--she goes back once a year.  I am a giver so I purchased one of her bodies of art for my friend.  She loves to dance to all kinds of music.  I was too busy perusing Frisco's catalog to notice whether Brazil's art was natural or not.

"Mexican Fusion" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - The young and innocent Mexican Fusion is from Anaheim as well--lucky me.  Her friend was putting on a show and invited her to come along this one night--she didn't have to drive so tagged along.  This artist is a fusion of Mexican and Spanish--her father is from Spain so she gets her light complexion and dark hair from him.  My guess is that she got her body from her mother--lucky me.  She also likes to dance to Trance music.  Mexican Fusion's body of art is all natural--lucky me.

I can already imagine the responses to this review--"Where are the pictures, John?!"  It is true that a picture is worth a thousand words, however, I believe art needs to be experience face-to-face--in the moment.  I strongly urge for all of you to go support your local artists!  FYI - Art ain't cheap!

Went to FEZ for happy hour to kick off my last night being 39, and it was my 1st time to the FEZ, I have driven past it so many time the past few years, so I thought it was about time to stop!

I made reservations because I had a group coming with me, and everything went smoothly! My plans for the day sort of changed, so I wound up being at FEZ 30 mins earlier than I had originally planned, but they already had my area set up and ready, so I just waited there for everyone to show! Staff was so nice and friendly!

I ordered a pomegranate margarita with a sugared rim, and it was perfect!! And very eye catching too! I also tried some of their sweet potato fries, and boy are those yummy!! And tried the pomegranate press too, and what a pleasantly surprising drink that was! 

Happy hour with friends went great! Look forward to coming back and trying out some other drinks, I know for sure I want to try that Dark Chocolate Martini!!

This is without a doubt my favorite club to go to in Vegas!!! 

I was told that they started selling tickets for the outside section only? I totally see how that can be a great idea because I like the outside section more than the inside section. 

The inside section is only fun when I go with a large group of guys to protect me from other people bumping into me... cause if I'm just with my girl friends I'm usually the crazy one that will go and push other people back. That's just too much work!! The stage is pretty dope though. I've seen a bunch of people here, including Dead Mau5 2 years ago and David Guetta over Memorial's Day Weekend. 

Nevertheless that outside area is what really does it for me :D you can dance and take pictures by the pool!! There's an outside bar also!! It isn't hot and stuffy, and it definitely isn't as crowded as the inside!! The only setback is when it rains O_O' When it started sprinkling on Saturday night, I was very worried for my hair and make up... Thankfully the sprinkles stopped and my friends and I were able to party it up!! 

Caution: Don't get pushed into the pool!! I actually know some of the girls who got pushed into the pool this past weekend... Drunk people =/ tsk tsk

Asian fusion tapas is how I would best describe Jayde Fuzion and Seonkyoung, the new Food Network star surely delivered with her culinary vision and concepts!

My advice is to go in a group of 4 and order a bunch of dishes and share.   We loved the Crab Salad - I believe this was one of the dishes featured in the early episode of Restaurant Express.  The salad was so fresh, light and refreshing.  The crab salad is paired with these lettuce endives and sesame wonton chips to scoop the crab goodness up.  This was one of our favorites.

You can't go wrong with the lettuce wraps stuffed with pork belly....YES....pork belly.  Next time I will get the Duck sliders and Korean street tacos as we saw many tables having these dishes.  

There are many traditional Korean dishes such as Japchae and Kalbi and for less adventurous eaters you can order a cashew chicken.  There's an even a full blown sushi bar.  

There's definitely something for everyone.   The best part is most entrees are in the $8 to $15 range so you can order several and share.  Be sure to save room for desserts.  We really enjoyed the Yuzu Donuts - I could eat a dozen of those.  Hopefully chef will bring her famous sticky Asian bbq Ribs.  If you're in the area, be sure to check out this new Asian gem at the M Resort.

Zen and the art of the tanning bed.  I have tanned before and my ex managed one and I can honestly say this one is not like the rest.  I was greated by the owner's fiance as Nyki was not there today.  Jake is a motivational speaker and certainly takes pride in the salon and its underlying concept.

Jake showed me all the beds and the air brush room.  There are three tanning beds and 1 red light therapy bed plus the air brush room.  Many places call it spray tanning but here there are no spray machines, just the art of Nyki and her studio space.   

They have super high intensity beds and basic beds.  Some very notable things that stood out are 1) Jake has extensive knowledge of the tanning process as well as the human mind. 2) The beds all look meticulously clean, new and in full service.  I can't tell you how many tanning places I have been where the beds have faded buttons, lights that are not working, or just look used.  Here, everything looks brand new.  3) The rooms are huge.  Most places minimize space to maximize the number of beds but here, you have room to move around without bumping into the bed, the table, the chair....  The rooms are decorated with themes instead of making you feel like you were in a janitor's closet.  You can write uplifting messages on the walls and are encouraged to do so as well as jot down positive thoughts which are then shared with Jake's school program where he speaks to kids with depression.    Finally, they take pride in the studio. You must remove your shoes and your negativity at the door.  I am glad I decided to check it out.

They currently offer the following deals for Yelpers and possibly non-yelpers too.
1) Free Hug. 
2) $35.00 for $55.00 worth of tanning. This will get you 7 tans in the basic bed or 2 in their higher beds.
3) Free first tan (a short one.)

In addition you can either pay for a certain number of hearts to spend on the tanning machines or you can get monthly tanning.  One of the best things about it is they do month to month billing so you don't need to sign a long term deal to get the better prices.  The prices are reasonable and competitive with chain establishments.

All in all, it was like stepping out of the real world for a few minutes.  If you are in Henderson and want to tan, this is the place you should go!.

Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat

Marquee Nightclub was packed. The music was thumpin' and the drinks were flowin'. Who cares if there were more dudes on the crowded dance floor than ladies? We were there to jump and dance ... and after quickly staking out a spot in the middle near the front, that is exactly what we and a few hundred of our new best friends did.

Tip #1: Stay at the Cosmopolitan. Go online and book a room because it includes free admission to Marquee through a much shorter line. It'll also give you a place to freshen up before hitting the club and crash/party afterwards. Ask for a room in the East Tower for convenience to Marquee.

Marquee Mondays makes Marquee a reason to stay in Sin City an extra day. The EC Twins and Nadia Ali performed on the Monday before Christmas and this was like an early gift from Santa.

Tip #2: Get on the main dance floor early cause by midnight it was wall-to-wall people with almost no one getting in or out. Many "couples" were frustrated with the tight quarters, so, come prepared for bumpin' and jumpin' with people from all around the globe.

DJ Lisa Pittman worked it at the pool while Eddie Makabi and another DJ pumped up the beats inside before the headliners came out around 12:30. Nadia did a 30-minute live set which had the crowd frothing and then the energy reached a peak with the frenetic twins.

Tip #3: Get a table if you aren't planning to stake out a spot on the crowded dance floor. If you are just wanting to chill at a club, the outdoor pool vibe and tables may be best or get one of the prime spots inside so you and your crew can dance in your own area.

Drinks are expensive ... of course, and table service is crazy expensive. Plan accordingly.

Marquee was a blast. We loved the vibe, the confetti, foam light sticks, blasts of cold air, and non-stop beats. If you get free admission to Marquee while staying at The Cosmopolitan then it is easily a 5-star night for any EDM fan.

Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat

Living up to the hype.  A warm and contemporary Italian American eatery that delivers great tastes with the energy that is Vegas.  

This is not an authentic taste of Italian regional specialties rather refined and prettied up versions of Italian American favorites.  All good, it works.

The majority of the menu centers around small plates of antipasti shared family style.  Flavors are very complimentary so ordering a wide variety of dishes works.  An incredible simple grilled broccoli rabe natural bitterness is enhanced by hints of char and smoke but brought to life by a spicy, chili vinaigrette.  Sweet peppers stuffed with a tangy goat cheese and peppery olive oil create a very well balanced dish exploding with freshness.

For seafood antipasti, do not pass on the lobster arancini.  Dressed with a spicy pomodoro of Calabria chili and a touch of a herbaceous basil aioli that elevates the sweetness of the lobster.  Slightly cloying mouth feel but great flavors.  

Great selection of well made salumi.  Try a variety.  The Bresaola and finocchiona as good as any in Tuscany.  Add a selection of cheeses with perfectly paired condiments (Mozzarella with a citrus chili pesto,  Parmigiano with honey).  

Small selection of pastas.  The lobster ravioli excellent.  Perfectly cooked sheets of pasta surrounding chunks of barely cooked through lobster perfumed by tarragon.  Richness on richness but it works.

The only weakness of the restaurant are the mains.  A mustard, walnut, and raisin crusted rack of lamb, while perfectly cooked was one dimensional, needing more herbaceous, lemony gremolata.  A bone in "Tuscan" rib-eye topped with a sunny side up egg did not make sense.   The yolk did nothing to elevate the flavor of the beef rather giving it an unpleasant yolky aftertaste as it cooled.

Service is a work in progress.  Slow and lacking confidence.  This will definitely improve with time.

Decent wine list at Vegas resort prices.

Guys, admit it, Giada turned you on to cooking shows.  Now the chance is here to try the food you know you never cooked.  Worthy.

Michelin Stars #20, 21, and 22

Let me start by answering your questions;

"No" and "No."

For my 30th birthday present, my wife treated me (us) to our first 3 star dining experience. My hopes were sky-high as we rode in our complimentary limo ride into the back of the MGM. We were escorted through the private baller area of the casino to the main entrance of the restaurant. Once inside, we were greeted with what might happen if you filled Barney the Dinosaur with gold and velvet and then blew him up, a purple pantheon of out-of-placeness. 

Of course, when having a once in a lifetime meal, you never order a la carte, you go all out with the 16 course degustation menu. Which leads me to some of my major gripes of the meal; the amuse was counted as a course, there were no intermezzos, apritifs and digestifs to break up the heavy French food, and the amazing cheese cart was not part of the tasting!

I lack the energy to describe each course in detail as I often do, but most of it was really really good. A couple were jaw droppingly good, yet others were only okay, and only okay for any place. For the price and the reputation, I expected so much more. I expected the foie gras to shed new light on the start of the universe and for the veloute to show me god, but no epiphanies were had that night. 

Service was spot on, never smothering or pretentious, and the wine guy guided us well. The pre-dinner bread and separate butter carts were equally amazing. 

For the money though, we both agreed that we would choose Urasawa, Spago, or Providence in a heartbeat for another meal. 

So now for your questions;
Was it worth it? NO
Would we go back? NO

PS - No good pictures because my old cybershot took a shit that day, so I bought a Sony Nex-3 and had no idea how to use it for dinner =[

I was driving through Mt. Lebanon at lunchtime and saw a new sign on Washington Rd. I'm glad I stopped to investigate because I was in for a delicious surprise! 

The Simple Greek is essentially a Greek food version of Chipotle and Qdoba (with all the same greatness!) You can build a pita, a salad, or a bowl with rice, vegetables, sauces, and meats to your own liking. I had a gyro meat rice bowl with delicious sour cream tzatziki sauce, green beans and potatoes in red sauce, and fresh veggies on top. I was so excited that I could decide what flavors to put together! They really make it to suit you--when I asked to try both types of rice in my bowl, the man making my meal was perfectly willing to split it down the middle to make it just the way I wanted it.

Additionally, the staff there was wonderful! I really appreciated that they took the time to explain what was in everything because, as someone with multiple food allergies, I hate to be surprised. Also, the woman in line behind me was asking about the vegetarian options on the menu and the man assisting her seemed very accommodating to her too. Each person I talked to seemed genuinely happy that I was there to eat, and that is always a plus in my book!

The atmosphere is welcoming, the place looks clean and well-maintained, and I'm eager to recommend it to all of my friends!

I HAVE URGES... 

"There is a human urge to clarify, rationalize, justify", said Leonard Bernstein. 

That sounds like a good description of Yelp, doesn't it, but that's not the urge I have. 

This definition is a better fit: 

a. An impulse that prompts action or effort. 
b. An involuntary tendency to perform a given activity. 

I have an urge to go to Las Vegas pronto. 

Do I like to gamble? Yes, sometimes. 

Do I like seeing some great shows? Definitely. 

Do I like going to the International CES, the world's largest consumer technology trade show? Oh, yeah, so much fun. 

Do I like staying in some great sexy hotel room on the Strip? You better believe it. 

But none of these are the reason for my urge. My urge is to go to a little nondescript shack located in a questionable, seedy area away from the Strip. The only strip this place is close to is the Olympic Gardens Strip Club that offers male and female strippers, and where lap dances go for 20 bucks. 

I need to go to Vegas because I want me some ice cream from Luv-It Frozen Custard NOW! 

Frozen custard is French style ice cream. It's lower in butterfat and calories than ice cream, and is made with eggs, which gives this indulgent concoction a creamier texture. It also has much less air whipped into it, and there are two types of air I don't like: people full of hot air (no, I'm not telling now) and ice cream full of air. 

I don't even like Sundaes, but at Luv-It Frozen Custard I am simply hypnotized by everything they have. Western Sundae, their most popular - vanilla custard, caramel, salty pecans and hot fudge? Give it to me now, before I get arrested for yanking it from the hands of some unsuspecting Japanese tourist! Bumble Berry Sundae? What's in it? Wait, I don't care, just pile it on! 

Everything is homemade, frozen custard flavors change every few days, so check their website, if you want to know what specific olfactory and oral pleasures to look forward to. Even their website looks hokily homemade, which in this case is just charming and consistent. 

So, if you want some frozen nirvana, if you're tired of seeing same old, same old corporate clones that look identical in LA, Johannesburg, Vegas and Moscow - this is the place for some instant bliss. 

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas...   I wish Luv-It frozen Custard didn't.

I stayed here on 8/14/10. Like the other review says, the food is AWFUL, the accommodations are CRAP, and the ambiance leaves MUCH to be desired. 

What the other reviewer didn't mention is that the staff is rude beyond belief, and will make you feel like less than a speck of fly shit on a piece of dog shit. No matter how polite you are, it will not serve you one bit...so I recommend venting your anger by voicing your complaints.

Once I voiced my complaints, I was immediately surrounded and attended to by a host of staffers, who led me away into a more private room, where my only company was two crackheads and a drunken barefooted prostitute. But these new accommodations pleased me even less than the old ones. Thankfully, all it took was 4 hours of inconsolable weeping before they upgraded my room to a larger shared suite.

This new room was similarly lacking in ambiance and decor, but at least the company was good. Say what you will about the CCDC's amenities -- the place is ALWAYS packed! And not with just the regular Vegas nightclub crowd, either; during my stay I met a fascinating array of prostitutes, strippers and crackheads. (OK, maybe it WAS the regular Vegas nightclub crowd, now that I think about it.)

The highlight of my experience was befriending a genial middle-aged Asian stripper with a distinctive deformity whereby her hands were missing several fingers, so that they resembled lobster claws. 

"You dancer?" she asked me. 
"No," I replied. 
"Why no?! You so preeeeetty!"
"I'd LIKE to be a dancer," I answered honestly; "I know the money's great... but I'm the world's WORST dancer, and I'd be laughed out of the club!"
"No honey; it eeeeeasy! I show you!"

And so it came to pass that I was the recipient of a lap dance in the holding tank of the CCDC by a lobster-clawed middle-aged Asian woman who had been arrested on charges of domestic violence (she beat up her husband, LOL). Amazing!

"Where did you say you danced again? Spearmint Rhino?!" I found this hard to believe, since supposedly those are the hottest dancers in Vegas.

"Yeah, Spearmint Rhino," she said...but then explained that they only let her dance til 9pm, then made her leave til 3am, when she was allowed back in the club. During those intervening hours, she would sometimes go dance at a less discriminating club. Like the one in the holding tank at the CCDC!

Five stars for the lap dance, five stars for the company...but zero stars for everything else.

With any luck, I will NOT be returning to this establishment!

A late night dessert restaurant is something every area of town needs, and the southwest area is no exception.  So Serenade is definitely a welcome addition to this part of town! 

We arrive after 8 pm and most of the tables are occupied by those enjoying hot drinks, on their laptops, or enjoying a sweet treat.  We grab the one large table by the counter and it takes awhile for us to decide.  Ultimately, we get the Honey Bread ($8.50) (aka Honey Toast) with extra honey and two drinks - the Pistachio Latte ($4.50) and the Peppermint Latte ($4.50).  The flavor is quite subtle for the Pistachio Latte and the Husband enjoyed it.  The Little Guy preferred my Peppermint Latte more though.  The honey bread is lovely as usual, but they do offer a Garlic version for 50 cents more.  Apparently it's garlic butter instead of plain butter used on it. 

The menu has your standard cafe drinks, hot and cold.  Waffles, cakes, pizzas, and pastries are among the items to munch on.

They offer outside seating and blankets too!

Stamp cards are available via the Epoxy app, so download for your Buy 9 Get 1 Free cards.  

Since they are located in the Smiths's Shopping Center, and the same corner as Rice N Noodle and Patty's Closet, there is plenty of parking available.  Free WiFi - look for the pass code on the board behind the register.

Overall, a nice alternative to meet up with friends at for coffee and cake.

Another fun staycation. I'm just glad it was free! The room was clean and spacious enough for us. We let them know ahead of time that we would need to use the sofa bed and they assured us that it would have a blanket, sheets and pillows, but it didn't. The sofa bed was not comfortable and flimsy. The following morning were able to get room service to set the bed up right. It still wasn't comfy, but at least had sheets and such. The regular bed was comfy and roomy. Room service spoiled me with a bag of yummy caramel popcorn that I couldn't put down. The kitchen area is nice if you bring your own pots, pans, utensils and food! The kitchen was bare. I didn't plan on cooking a meal anyway so found it useless. There is a small stove-top yet no coffee maker? I didn't get that. At least at a "motel" I would have had a coffee maker and coffee/tea packets complimentary. The fridge was stocked, but I didn't get anything from it since it is overpriced. Be careful when opening these fridges because if you even pick something up to look at, the sensor will know and charge your room for it. 

There is a cafe, bar, starbucks and of course room service for food options, but nothing else as far as I could see for dining. At least there are other hotels within City Center to check out dining options at and of course shopping. I can't say I would recommend this place to anyone but if you get the chance to stay here for free, do it!

My family and friends have been getting together for a few years here to grub. That will be happening no longer. The last 3 visits were terrible and the last visit specifically was not good. I'm sad about this because I really loved the food before, but now it's just not consistent. On this last visit we were the only customers in the restaurant yet it still took over an hour to receive our food and the food came out staggered. My niece only wanted Egg Drop Soup and they totally forgot to bring it to her and only did so after asking a 3rd time about it. When she finally got her soup it was like a bowl of gloppy gel. I loved the soup here before, so I have no idea what has happened, but it wasn't even edible. What I loved ordering here most, Strawberry Chicken, tasted awful. One thing that wasn't easy to ignore was the nasty smell inside. It smelled so badly of like sewage or something. Then at the end of the meal we noticed roaches on the floor! OMG I was so ready to leave. Drinks come in cans and refills aren't free. After loving this place for so long it's a major disappointment to see New China Cuisine go so downhill.

Excalibur Hotel is child's play compared to the elite hotel resorts of Las Vegas ... at 1/2 the price tag ... making it a deal for you bargain hunters or families on vacation. If you have children or need a "beginner" hotel for the whole Vegas experience, choose Excalibur.

Til then, Excalibur has accepted it's cheap existence and you should, too.

Sadly Al's Beef is gone but Fired Pie is a nice addition to the Northsight neighborhood!  

I came here today for a late lunch. There were no cars parked in front and the inside was cavernously and deserted. Fired Pie I've learned believes their market is providing "a fast, casual and customizable options for your pizza or salad desires. We use local brews, organic foods, cognizant of sustainability and the ..."  Yeah, yeah but do they make a good pie?  In a word, yes. 

This, in some ways, is the pizza world's answer to Jimmy Johns. In essences, "Pizza so Fast you'll Freak!"  LOL  They cook their pies in a wood fired 700 F degree oven, so they're done in less than four minutes. Nice!

The crust is ultra thin and the toppings are very good (see photos). I'm not sure if one individual 10" pie will satisfy you if you have a hardy appetite. But I thought it was very good and filling.  

I had the Tomato & Basil, which has the look of a Margherita pizza, but Fired Pie adds garlic and several types of cheeses for a nice taste.  

The cost was a fair $7.75 (not including tax) and seems like a good alternative to the sandwich/subs guys over near the 101 and Pima.  Specialty pizzas are $2.00 extra. 

So Three and half Stars+, A-Okay!

It takes two to make a food so right
Korean/Mexican is outta sight
Hit it!

I wanna eat right now
I'm Greg N, and I came to chow down
This place is not internationally known
But on the Yelp App on your new iPhone
It's near the top and so highly rated
In Las Vegas: and that's going to be debated
After you order, they give you fresh cooked chips
With pico de gallo and guacamole dips
Some of the best chips that I've ever had
This free offering made me feel real glad
Order three tacos with beef bulgogi
Right on par with that truck called Kogi
Keep the flo' cuz

It takes two to make a food so right
Korean/Mexican is outta sight
It takes two to make a food so right
Korean/Mexican is outta sight

I can't believe that here in Nevada
I ate the most amazing fusion tostada
Thick "nurungji" shell at its base
The fried tortilla with rice replace
With spicy pork bulgogi on top
With shredded cabbage here they don't stop
Pico de gallo they placed on too
And gochujang hot sauce was the flavor glue
One of the best dishes I've had all year
It made me happy, it made me there cheer
It's like PSY and Carlos Santana collaborating
On a megahit song. I'm celebrating
If you go here, order this dish
You will also say this is delish'

It takes two to make a food so right
Korean/Mexican is outta sight
It takes two to make a food so right
Korean/Mexican is outta sight
Hit it!

Now the bulgogi fries are just OK
Not amazing as other Yelpers may say
And the kimchi fried rice was so-so
Many other places for kimchi fried rice would go
Just skip these two and just get
The tostadas and the tacos and you'll be set
Once you get a-hold of these two plates
And you chomp into the food so great
You'll be throwing your hands in the air
And waving them like you just don't care
KoMex is a foodie find
Get off of the buffet grind!

It takes two to make a food so right
Korean/Mexican is outta sight
It takes two to make a food so right
Korean/Mexican is outta sight

I was initially looking forward to visiting this Vietnamese restaurant because of the high ratings on Yelp. The interior gave a modern feel as the red, black, and light wood dcor was spaciously arranged with slow natural lighting coming through the windows.

The Com Ga Nuong ($7.50) came with pieces of chicken grilled to perfection. It was marinated with ginger, lemongrass, shallot, garlic, and served with pickled veggies and steamed rice. The chicken was moist and juicy, but the flavors on the marinade and pickled veggies were faint. The dish had promise, but the flavors were kept too safe and failed to stand out. The dish also came with a bowl of over-salted soup which I could not finish. 

The server kept asking me if I wanted to order something else. Feeling pressured, I ordered the Taro Boba ($3.99) since he said it would be made with real taro. The quality of the boba was decent at best, but the drink was made with powder instead of fresh taro.

I then turned to the female server to inquire about the drink. She said they don't have fresh taro in the restaurant and that the drink was made with powder. Moments later, the sever came back to reassure the drink was made with real ingredient. I was visibly upset by then, so the server went outside for a few minutes before returning to my table to say, "We grind up real taro into powder so it can be mixed into the drink." Since I make boba drinks at home, I can guarantee you that such practice is not only unusual, but this guy must be delusional or in the midst of a cover up.

The owner of the restaurant noticed that I was extremely dissatisfied about being lied to, but did not address the issue to intervene. The second server was at fault too since she did not comp the drink or bring it to the ownership's attention. I told her, "I wouldn't have ordered this drink if I know it's not made with real taro."

I have been eating taro since childhood so I can distinguish those that are artificially made. To insist that they were telling the truth, after the second server had already admitted to the error, earned them a zero star for 1) up selling their customers, 2) dishonesty, 3) lack of intervention and apology to fraud, 4) indifferent ownership.

I would never come back to support this business and encourage the public to do the same.

Chocolate time!

This place is pretty awesome!  We swung by after brunch for an afternoon dessert & walked around the forum shops.  

To start, this really is a 5 star experience.  The amazing chocolates, the service, the atmosphere...  love it!

We ended up sharing a milk chocolate granita & it was so smooth & thick!  It was like an iced hot chocolate, actually, it is.  It was served in the "Drink Me" cup which was the perfect size to share.

The service was spot on & our server never rushed us even when we took forever to decide what to get.  We also found out from him that the chocolate pipes aren't real.  :(

I love the feel of the small caf, very cozy & intimate.  The have regular tables & some bar tables.  The decor was very chocolatey!  They even had 10-lb chocolate bricks for decorations!

We will definitely be back to try everything out!  Especially the fries with chili & cocoa dust!

Located inside the Forum Shops at Cesar's Palace.

It has been a really LONG time since i've been really wowed by sushi. I came to a point in my life where I really questioned whether or not sushi, in general, has become perpetually trite. After visiting Daisho, my opinion of sushi has changed. This is now my favorite AYCE sushi spot in Vegas, and what they are doing here is surprisingly wonderful. Here's why:

First, after walking in the door and being seated by the server at the bar, we were given our menu's. They had the expected items you would see on any sushi menu, but after looking at the appetizer menu, you can tell that these guys are trying to do things distinctive. We had the AYCE menu for 25 bucks, and Tony T. and I started our voyage through this unique menu.

Note: We tried a great volume of items, so I would probably max out the 5000 character limit on Yelp reviews by describing only 1/4 of what we had. There was zilch that I didn't like on menu, but there some dishes that are especially noteworthy.

: Salmon Collar/Yellowtail Collar - This was unbelievable. I was totally blown away, especially by the salmon. The first time I had collar of a fish was at Yonaka, and it was wonderful. On the other hand, the collar at Daisho completely blows Yonaka's out of the water!!! Wonderfully tender, with the natural fat sustaining the moistness of the fish, personally (especially with the salmon), I thought I was eating foie gras. It was prepared with an expert hand, and cooked with precision.  It absolutely melted in the mouth. I'm still thinking about it.

: Uni and Ikura (salmon roe) nigiri - Freshest and highest quality uni and salmon roe i've ever had, EVER. The uni had a delicate, but firm texture, and had a clean taste. The same goes for Ikura as well. 

I FINALLY found a place that makes sushi rice correctly!!!! A great deal of people think that it's effortless to create great sushi rice. What folks don't realize is, that in world-class sushi restaurants, sushi apprentices and beginner trainees spend 3-4  (or more) YEARS learning just how to make rice, before they are given the permission to touch a piece of fish. Making sushi rice in itself, is an art form. And these guys nailed it.

A small footnote: This locale is great for low-carbers. There are more than 5 rice less rolls and plenty of apps that do not contain starch or rice, including collar, poke, oysters, yaki-tori and more!!

See what happens when you wait too long to write your review!? Phoenix Magazine beats you to the punch and lists one of your favorite finds as one of the Valley's best dishes! 

Oh well, I guess I should just feel "validated."

Here's my take on this place:
For $12.50 you get a platter full of diced shrimp ceviche bordered by at least a dozen grilled regular sized shrimp and no less that a whole avocado's worth of wedges. It's served with crisp, flat, tostada chips and is plenty to share! A real value!!

If I'm dining alone, I generally get a couple of pupusas. Pupusas are like thick corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, beans or meat - your pick! They even offer a version stuffed with the loroco flower, which I understand is similar to a squash blossom. Myself? I'm a bean and cheese girl most of the time. And, I prefer them straight up: skip the tomato sauce and slaw topping. 

The chicken soup is flavorful and the portion size is significant, served with a couple of handmade tortillas.

Salvadoreno recently got a beer and wine license, and, a I can't think of a better beverage to wash down a pupusa than an ice cold beer!

Oh! I guess this can be my "scoop" - Salvadoreno is going to start offering a $7.95 lunch buffet from 11 - 3. Buffet items will vary depending on the day of the week.  I'm feelin' a pupusa eating contest as a lunchtime UYE!

A smooth club promoter named Emmanuel approached us in the mall and dangled free champagne before us.

Now...

I am a champagne lush. I don't like much else... unless it involves fruit, ice, and well...a sophisticated combination of Baileys, Guinness, and Jamison - but I am all over...yes all over - anything having to do with champagne.

So after watching the incredible Le Reve - we made our way over to Blush, with our VIP bands, to get our bubbly on.

I have to admit that I didn't have high expectations for the space, so Blush exceeded any and all pre-conceived notions I had. There was plenty of room to move, good music, the bartenders and cocktail waitresses were friendly (and hot...), the space itself was glamorous and sophisticated, and as soon as we found ourselves in the picturesque and daintily lit outside patio area, some nice folks smiled at us and quickly made room on their table.

It was our first night in Las Vegas, and with our fake eyelashes batting, our brown skin hues pressed up the white chairs, and our bubbling champagne in hand - we couldn't help but bask in the sexy outdoor glow of the night. 

For any girls looking for a low-key way to start the night, I couldn't recommend Blush more. Unfortunately for guys, they do charge a 30 dollar cover, which Blush, though chic and beautiful - is not worth.

Also, while you won't have to fight your way through a glazed eyed crowd, one could even remark and find fault with how mellow the crowd is/was. 

When we were there, people were evidently interested in conversing and mingling. Very few people, in fact no people were dancing, despite the quality music flowing through the lovely space. 

I personally loved the low-key vibe of Blush, but if you're looking for your destination Vegas night spot  full of of table top-dance moves - Blush may be too timid for your liking.

I recently had one of the worst days of my life and that's not an exaggeration. I received some really bad news mid day, mid week and kinda walked around in a fog until I get off work at 5:00pm. In a Xanax induced coma; tired and starving due to skipping lunch I happened upon Lucky Boy. I've been meaning to stop in for awhile but just never made it happen.

Now, I'm not one of those chicks that drowns her sorrows in french fries and ice cream, quite the opposite actually so I figured I'd take advantage of my appetite. I ordered an "international burger" and fries and some sort of large carbonated beverage. It was wonderful. The fries were crispy and perfectly salted and the burger was one of the best I've had in a very long time. The ingredients were fresh and the price was right. I'm sure there are better burgers out there, but I can't think of any. I ate the whole fucking thing and was actually sad when the experience was over. 

I'll be back soon to gorge myself on some other menu items. Maybe I'll wait for PMS to kick in, maybe I wont. All I have to say is this- there is something comforting about smothering your insides in cheese and oil. Lucky Boy may not solve all of your problems, but it fills the void in your tummy without having to prepare a meal when you are out of your flippin mind.
And that's something....

This place seems somewhat hidden behind McChevron. Walking in we were greeted and given a chance to glance over the menu. The food is made fresh to order and they have a free salsa and veggie bar. Priced just under $3, I ordered a "Cheese Quesdalilla" and a "Fried Beef Taco" for around $2. Can't say I was a fan of the quesadilla. The tortilla tasted store bought and the cheese was lacking and had a somewhat pasty texture. The fried beef taco wasn't bad actually, but the chicken taco at Roberto's, grease and all, is by far better and larger in size. They have plenty of tables inside and you can call your order ahead of time too. The employees were very nice and inside was clean, but with other nearby options for lunch that I have enjoyed more and this place tasting average or just under, I can't see coming back.

I came to grab dinner at this Japanese restaurant with fellow Yelper Kurdy S, and the experience was a big disappointment. I was initially impressed by the sleek, horizontal interior that included an outdoor patio, sushi bar, bar area, and a long stretch of booths and tables. The restaurant was relatively quiet considering the small and large groups of families that were dining there. They also have a few TVs for those eager to keep track of games and scores.

We ordered the Toyko Frites ($7) that came with shoestring fries sprinkled with seaweed and served with honey jalapeno and spicy aioli dips. The fries tasted rather ordinary and plain. The dips were very simplistic without hints of complexity. I don't think I would pay that much for fries to go with mayo-siracha dip. 

The Assorted Sushi Platter ($18) came with eight pieces of spicy tuna roll, and nigiri that included unagi, ika, sake, tai, maguro, white fish, and ebi. The fish selection was ordinary and on the cheap side. The flavors were rather bland with dry spots, and I thought the red snapper had already turned. 

I was particularly offended by my order of Ikura ($6) that was served half done! Apparently, the sushi chef had run out of salmon roe. He then had the audacity to serve a half way done Ikura and told me that I would be charged half the price for it. Presentation and precision are such a big part of the dining experience in Japanese cuisine. The restaurant should have let me know about this in advance and ask if there is anything else that I would rather have in its place. My face turned as red as the maguro when the order arrived at the table. I had the server to take it off the bill.

Service was grounded in Western paradigm and not very thoughtful at all. Prices were too inflated and the quality from food to service was sub par. I left in disappointment and will never want to come back here again.

**breakfast review**

I had absolutely no expectations at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grll, I don't follow his TV persona or his shows. All I know is that he grills and invades peoples' restaurants for a challenge, how freakin' humble..
But I could honestly say this is one of the best breakfast (or actually brunch) places I've had in a very long time!

I started off my brunch with a Spicy Bloody Mary, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=g_DhgA5vwnDyojJ5hAg00Q
Honestly not worth the $9, but I appreciated the unique olive & chile pepper on the side, and the drink didn't taste like straight up tomato juice + vodka, there were a lot of spices in there! 
Warning, it was quite spicy for a morning drink. I thought "Hey~~~ Whatever, I'm in Vegas,"  but boy, did it kick my @ss that morning. 

Their impressive "bread basket" is breakfast alone! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=Sy-fdjtW7Drd-6LBJ-i3ww

You must get the one and only soup Mesa Grill serves, the Grilled Corn Soup. Delicious and the consistency reminded me of soupier porridge, which made me feel warm and homey :*) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=0UI-AK7kH_DvUWgjOce34g

I admit I was regretful while ordering a salmon dish while Mesa is known for Tex Mex, but my Honey Glazed Salmon w/ black bean sauce was amazing. You can request the salmon medium or even medium rare!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=Wz2EFRR4Kt-uZfR6WPjoPg

My girlfriends also ordered other breakfast staples like a Sweet Potato Hash (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=u4pq7PFOPYytWEhfxCxQ0w) and the Jalapeno scrambled eggs with Ham (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=8YIzCO87s62KyKgqNedm5g). I can easily say these dishes were impressively satisfying breakfast dishes, and definitely exceeded my expectations.

BREAKFAST FOOD SUCCESS!

Their extravagant looking confections and pastries have a tendency to draw visitors in.  That was certainly the case several years ago when I visited their location inside the Bellagio.  This was the second time I've stopped at their newer location inside Aria, but this was the first time I purchased something.

While my buddies were losing their hard earned wages on gaming devices and eye-candy dealers I decided to indulge in another sort of eye-candy taking a mid-day break here snapping photos of Christmas themed confections (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=DELXUM9BD2s0h4e37_gt5Q) and sitting down with an iced mocha (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=95AhWqWjCtxG36p8nBq7xg) and a slice of cake.

I chose the Opera cake slice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=p5YuhVtND3noJCQ6mwU9tA) made up of liqueur-soaked sponge cake, coffee butter cream and chocolate ganache because it seemed like a safer selection than any of the other 20+ varieties of individual cakes, tarts, napoleons and mousses, and I really needed a shot of caffeine from staying up late the previous night and not catching up on my z's in the hours that passed.  I'm normally not a coffee drinker, but I do turn to it rather than to instant energy products.

Maybe because my choice was safe, but the cake slice did not wow me at all.  The flavors all meshed together quite well, but there was no particular component to the dessert that gave it any "oomph."  This was just a sweet slice of cake with, really, nothing special to it.  The cocoa covered truffle that sat atop the cake had an unusually thick shell and the center wasn't as smooth and sensuous as some mass-produced truffles I've sampled.  I actually enjoyed the bitterness and cold from my iced mocha more than I did the cake.

Maybe it was better this way.  Next time I'm in Las Vegas and I walk past their beautiful desserts I know to treat it like I treat other eye candy.  It's better not to sample no matter how delicious or tantalizing they seem to be!

Taquitos Jalisco serves up Mexican street food common to the state of Jalisco.  You might be more familiar with the state capital city, Guadalajara.  This particular restaurant has a "sister" property on Gilbert Road that I've heard has better tasting food than this location.  Hmmm... I may have to find out!  as this was very good Mexican street food!  There's a bandwagon forming for Taquitos Jalisco and it's making stops in Mesa!

Let me jump on the bandwagon for a ride too!  I missed the Yelper Lunch UYE here in April, but I scheduled my lunch group to go here this month.  I'd heard from Robyn N and Rand H that the place was small, but had no idea that by small they meant TINY!  The international lunch group that I organize was about 14 deep for lunch!  We were smart enough to arrive early.  Every table was taken once we got in the door.  Thankfully, it was not terribly hot outside and the tables outside were still open.  We gladly occupied those tables under the shade with the roar of the traffic on Broadway whizzing by.

I sat next to my buddy Dawn K and we split our food!  I ordered 3 carne asada Tacos and 2 Tamales.  I will say that I was disappointed with the Tacos.  The carne asada was a little dry for me.  But still tasty enough to enjoy.  The tamales were fantastic!  I split one of my tamales with the entire group so that everyone could get a taste.  But I saved the other for myself for lunch the next day!  Dawn K ordered a platter with 3 things on it.  Enchilada, Taco and a Chile Relleno.  I tried some of her Chile Relleno!  The chile relleno was extremely good.  It was my favorite thing that I tasted.  

I did not try it, but one lunch'er raved about the fish tacos and Robyn N also said their fish tacos were very good.  A slip of the brain as I would have ordered that instead of the carne asada taco.

Everyone in the group was happy, even the vegetarian lunch'er was happy with his veggie burrito!  Score!  This place is worth stopping in and trying.   

Remember, this is definitely a DIVE!  The parking lot is also very small.  It is on the north side of the street.  Pay attention.  The building is so small, you will likely drive past it and miss the turn.

Parents of children with disabilities, this is the museum for you. The staff here are very empathetic and understanding of their behaviors. For example, if you got an autistic kid who verbally stims, the staff won't tell him to be quiet. I'm giving LVNHM a 5-star review just based on how nice the staff is!!!

The admission fee is $10.00 for adults. I know that most yelpers dropped out of school, and $10 is a lot of money to you guys, but maybe cut back on the Yonaka and Snowflake for a couple of days and you can finally save enough money to come here. Hey, you might even lose some weight so you no longer have to take pictures of yourself at those odd angles where they can't see your body. I'm kidding..I'm kidding...Just busting your balls again. But, LVNHM does participate in a program that allows anyone with a BOA debit card in for free twice a month! So you can keep your Taiwanese shaved ice, bring it here to LVNHM, and eat it in front of the animatronic dinosaur. (note- btw I'm an Art of Flavors guy)

I brought the same kid from my review of "Tony's Container Park" here. He liked this place a lot better than Tony's park for 2 particular  reasons: 1st they didn't stigmatize him and accuse him of being one of the homeless children that live downtown. 2nd, there were no hipsters.

At 2pm we get to feed the sharks, and they even got those blind cavefish that can see things through their other senses. There is also a turtle, a big snake, and a scorpion.  And on the bottom floor they got Double Deck Blackjack, 15 slot machines, video poker and a full bar. Yes, bring all your nerdy Asian yelp friends over here, since you guys never understand sarcasm for some reason...

Since Christmas is coming up they decorated this place really  nice. They also put up a bunch of Hanukkah decorations. This is probably the best time to come. 

On weekends they close real early, so please after your next UYE at Poppy Den, skip Johnny Fontanes for one night and don't stay out till 5 am drinking. But, if you do spend all night drinking, remember to drive really fast because it decreases the amount of time you spend on the road, which equals more sleep! I'm a well educated gentleman so take my advice as fact.

It had been over a decade since I last stayed at the MGM.  Came here during Yelps Spring break and was hoping to get into one of the newly renovated rooms but I ended up in the regular ones.  It was the same weekend as the Billboard Music award.  Too bad I didn't see any celebs.

We got the first room right off the elevator.  I was thinking it was going to be noisy with all the peeps coming and going and the up and down of the elevator but it was actually pretty quite.  The 2 queens size beds were comfortable and the room spacious enough for 2 people.  Big bathroom with plenty of counter space for all the hair and makeup stuff.  

On the evening of the 2nd day we were surprised with a special delivery of champagne and sweets.  We almost made the guy leave stating to him that we didn't order anything LOL.  Well he got our names right and it was a little something from the hotel to welcome us.  

Im not very picky when it comes to hotel accommodations.  As I don't tend to spend much time in the hotel room.  As long as it had a comfortable bed, a TV, nice size shower with good water pressure Im happy.  That said the one thing I was disappointed about was the WiFi.  It was struggling a bit.

Local ~ On the Strip
Room ~ 2 Queen beds and on the 18th floor.
Stay ~ Clean and comfortable.
Extras ~ WiFi struggled a bit.

The grilling of food over an open flame is almost 125,000 years old.

And, the Habit Burger story is an interesting one. http://www.habitburger.com/story/  Yet the charbroiling of hamburgers and chicken is a cooking technique that many fast food places have yet to master.  Until now that is. We came here this past Saturday and came away thinking, Wow.

The menu is very familiar.  It will remind many of "In 'n Out" in it's simplicity and style of service.  Their Char-burger is $2.95 and the Double Char is $3.95. I don't know if you can order it animal style, but the burgers are delicious.  Yes, delicious.  It has that smokey char-boiled taste down to where you will want lick your fingers.

Other grilled Habit Burger sandwiches include, Chicken for $5.75, Tri-Tip beef $6.25, as well as Veggie options and Albacore Tuna.  The Sides include French fries, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and a salad range in price from $1.85 to $2.65.  

Besides a side of salad, Habit Burger also has six different Specialty Salads to choose from, ranging from a Garden for $3.95 to a Santa Barbara Chicken Cobb for $6.95.

A couple of burgers, a side of sweet potato fries and a drink ran us $12.68, including tax.  Wow.  Less expensive than "SmashBurger", slightly more than "In 'n Out"; but a lot better tasting.  Nice.

Enjoy!

Finally... a buffet where Quantity = Quality. Of course, it is still a buffet, so, don't come expecting this to be a 5-star dining experience or some romantic dinner for two. The Buffet at Wynn Las Vegas is a 5-star buffet experience ... with buffet being the key word.

We came for dinner and left about 2 1/2 hours later. I'm sure our waitress thought we were pigs. I know we felt like pigs ... and didn't really care because we loved the food so much.

 - Lamb, Prime Rib, & Game Hen
 - Try to get a table in the well-lit courtyard. It's a nicer atmosphere.
 - Gelato, Candied Apples, Profiteroles, and Chocolate-covered Marshmallows
 - Cheeses and Charcuterie
 - Dim Sum dumplings (so-so) and other Asian dishes
 - More, more, and more.

It may sound like every other buffet and while it is, it also isn't. The little things are nicer. The food is better. The buffet is better.

Pita House is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. They've got me craving it often but I don't feel bad because their food is every bit as healthy as it is delicious. Everything is made fresh and in house including their bread. There isn't a can opener on site and nothing is processed.

I'm in love with their tabouli salad (see photo). It's been absolutely perfect every time I've ordered it. The beef kabob skewers are also great with their famous garlic sauce. It's a must try! I've ordered their gyros and those are yummy too. They serve theirs on a pita and not that thicker flatbread like I've had at Greek restaurants. Possibly because their food is Lebanese and this is a different style. I have no complaints though. Just wanted to point out that it was uncommon to me. Regarding the rest of the menu, I haven't gotten too adventurous with that yet so I can't comment. However, this is one of those places where I am willing to bet that everything on the menu is good. Next thing I plan on trying is their hummus. I was with a friend that ordered that and it looked amazing!

Service is excellent and staff is all friendly. 

Random Quirky Fact - Apparently the cast of TLC's Sister Wives are fans too. You'll see their autographed promo card near the cash register. And all this time I assumed they lived in Utah...

I like the Monte Carlo. It's usually cheaper than the surrounding hotels and the staff have always been super friendly.

Now, it's not the Bellagio- but it's definitely not the Circus Circus. You can get a good Vegas experience in the heart of the strip without breaking the bank. I also like that it's walking distance from the other hotels, so hopping from place to place isn't an issue.

The rooms are clean, but again, no-frills. For us, we don't spend too much time in the room, we usually wander around, shop, gamble and eat. We're not the club type, so having one in the hotel is definitely not a priority.

The casino has the usual slots and tables- but it's not my favorite place to gamble. I prefer heading to the old Vegas where minimums are between $2 and $5. If you go during the week here, they have them, but you're usually playing by yourself. I prefer playing with a crowded table- I think it makes it more exciting (for Blackjack at least...)

Valet is sometimes a little bit of a pain- especially around check-out time for hotel guests. We've waited 45-minutes for our car. After being hungover and tired, that is the last thing you want to do. Yes, it's free. But it's much quicker to just park in the structure and do a quick little hike to get out faster.

Now, I haven't tried the restaurants on property- however, it looks like they aren't favored by a lot of Yelpers. I usually stick to the binging of buffets to fulfill my hunger.

Tip: Check the website and Vegas.com frequently as rates can change drastically from one day to the next.

I have been to Marquee a few times already, but this time is THE WORST experience ever. Yeah, the lines are extremely long, the wait is probably 1-2 hours, and it was crowded in the venue...but all this still won't make me as mad and as disappointed...

Basically,  two of my friends and I had a couple drinks at the bar, then we went to the dance floor and started dancing. My friend and I decided to take another shot at the bar...While we were walking to the bar, we got stopped by the security and asked us to follow them. At this point, I thought that, "I guess I am really fucked up and I'm going to get kicked out!"

So we continue to follow the security, which leaded us into a room. Next thing the security in the room yelled at us and said, "Where is the E? Why are you guys selling E?"  The fact that we did not have any E or drugs, my friend and I were really confused. We told them we didn't have any drugs, but the security kept yelling and questioning us and even said that they got us on tape for evidence.

At this point, I was EXTREMELY frustrated and felt very disrespected, so I took all my belongs out from my pocket and told them," Find the fucking E if you can!!!"  Since they couldn't find E or drugs, you would think that they would apologize for the mistake and let us go... HELL to the Fucking No... They said, "Here's the deal: you guys are banned from Marquee, Tao and the Cosmopolitan property forever." Then, they took a picture of us, and released us from the back door... is this a fucking joke?

First of all, your asses did not find any drugs from my friend and I. Second, you guys were even trying to threaten us with all kind of tricks: "We have everything on the tape!" "We will call the police!" and other bullshits as well, to forces us to admit something we did not do! Where is the fucking justice?!

If you need a spot to get away from it all....look no further!

For a mere $20 (or less with coupons available on various sites) you have access to their facilities where you can relax and detox until they shut off the lights and security drags your naked ass out to the parking lot.  

Paolo D, Regina P, David S and Julie S all give very helpful and detailed reviews on how it'll all go down so you should read them.  I have a few things to add:

- Bring flip flops.  They didn't supply them for me and I walked around barefoot the whole time.  It wasn't bad but I was running out of a couple of the sauna rooms really quickly since the floor was hot.   

- No option for bathing suits.  You will be naked with everyone else.  I am very near sighted so everyone looks like they've been blurred out for public television.

- Be VERY careful when getting into one of the beds in the red clay ball room.  It's like walking on a hundred marbles and the floor is not forgiving.  I wiped out pretty bad and strained my MCL.  My doctor said I'll be fine in a week.  Thanks to all that laughed at me (wife included).  I am going butt in first the next time.  

- The signs say to use each sauna on the 2nd floor for 3-7 minutes.  You can definitely do a little longer than that.  But one guy fell asleep in the red clay ball room (you could hear him snoring) and I am guessing he was in there for a solid hour.  He looked like a total disaster when he came out.  Stay hydrated!

- I never do this but I paid $1 for the 3 minute massage chairs.  There were 2 types.  One was the standard massage which was decent and the other was the "slimming massage chair" which was ridiculous.  The latter just started shaking your butt from left to right, up and down like you were going through terrible airplane turbulence and it also crushed your calves.  Definitely avoid that one.

I know it sounds like I am just complaining but there's a lot to like about Imperial.  The steam rooms are great.  I enjoyed sitting in the sheer heat of the herbal steam room only to jump into the cold tub as soon as I got out.  It felt so refreshing! 

I still think it's a wonderful place that I will be coming back to repeatedly despite my injury.

Convention time.
Twice a year I go to a Safety Convention run by our insurance company. Our group has grown steadily. 10 years ago we were the 7th company to join, today there are 200 companies. Being so big, we need a big place. This years venue the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. 

It's a big hotel, able to accommodate a group like ours (about 150 participants). Our group was the small one. Another group had over 1,000 participants. Yikes. 

The Room:
800 sq ft in area. The beds were comfortable. Bathroom was clean. Living area had a sofa and a work desk. Flat screen TV, mini bar, refrigerator, safe, hair dryer,  iron & ironing board were the amenities they had in the room. All in all, a nice place to relax after a long day of work. 

The Convention:
Big rooms to accommodate us. 
We had breakfast and lunch catered by the hotel. The food was good, but nothing special. 
It is a long long walk to get to the convention area from the hotel. 

The Restaurants
The Rio has quite a few of them. 
They have 2 buffets. The famous Carnival buffet and the Seafood buffet. I've tried both and they are both very good.

Martorano's is an Italian restaurant. We had our group dinner here and food was great. It's served family style so it good for a group. 

They also have a dim sum (KJ Chinese Dim Sum), Indian (Royal India Bistro), seafood (Buzios), breakfast (Hash House A Go Go) & steak (Voo Doo Steak House) restaurants inside the Rio. 

The Casino
All the casino games you expect. They also have a sports book area to bet on games. 

The Rio is off the Strip. They offer 2 free shuttles to their sister casinos on the Strip. One goes to Bally's and the other one goes to Harrah's. There is a return shuttle from both of those casino back to the Rio. It operates every half hour. 

I really enjoyed my time here. 
The convention space was huge. 
The room are nice and clean. 
The restaurant inside the hotel were a plenty. 
The casino area was vibrant and fun. 
A Las Vegas experience indeed.

Playful interpretation of comfort food and innovative craft cocktails served in a bizarre turn of the century brothel meets postmodern industrial  Sci-Fi steam punk dining space.

To be clear, I'm not a fan of the Disneyesque dcor which makes you the thing that looks out of place.

The Boiler Room is a craft cocktail lounge meaning, it's not the beer, neat scotch, or wine kind of place.  Complex, new creations and reinvented, turn of the century cocktails containing multiple liquors, house made infusions, and oils dominate the unique drink offerings.   Tried a few, won't go into them individually, suffice it to say, they are excellent.   It's like drinking a dish.  You can taste the evolving flavor on the palate even after the sip is long gone.  Impressive.

The food hit the mark.  The "Bacon Wrapped Bacon-N-Egg", quirky, difficult to eat but once you stuff it in your mouth, it's like breakfast in a big bite.  Sitting on a piece of toasted brioche is a bacon wraps a cube of pork belly topped with a fried quail egg, tomato jam and guacamole.

The shrimp corndogs, not bad.  Sweet corndog batter coating slightly over cooked jumbo shrimp topped with a vibrant cilantro aioli.  Good flavor, a little excessive on the aioli that leaves a greasy feel in the mouth.

The smoked gravlax are excellent.  Cucumbers, fresh dill, red onion and pieces of gravlax (cured salmon) are placed in a dish with a dome filled with hardwood smoke.  Sensory dining as the smoke tickles your nose before you taste the mild bitterness it has imparted throughout the entire dish.  Excellent texture, just plain fun.

Finally, "Squid-E-Os with Spicy Merguez Meatballs".  A surprise from a disturbing sounding dish.  Tender cooked squid rings sit atop a squid ink / tomato sauce whose oceanic flavor is counter balanced by spicy, earthy meat balls.  It works and is good eats.

Servers are well trained and friendly.  No problems when describing the unusual offerings.

Keep an open mind.  Experiment.  Well worth a visit.

Eff you McDonalds, eff you! 

You told me you had "Real Fruit Smoothies" that were blended to perfection and offered at a reasonable price. You drilled that idea in my head for weeks with your incessant advertising on the sides of buses and mile high billboards with pictures of creamy, fruity smoothies that made my mouth salivate instantly. You knew that I loved smoothies so much that I would go to great and dangerous lengths to obtain one of your so called "Real Fruit Smoothies". You knew that even though I loathed you and everything you stand for, that I would risk it all, risk everything to venture into your mustard arches to try one of your smoothies. 

As soon as I walked in and looked around, I knew immediately that I didn't fit in. I won't get into specifics, but let's just say that many of your patrons have the "I don't have a job and I don't care because I get unemployment checks" look about them. Just sayin'. After I made my way through a throng of screaming kids running around barefoot, I finally made it to the counter. I decided to play it safe and order a strawberry banana smoothie thinking that you couldn't possibly mess that classic flavor up. I wasn't actually able to see you make this "Real Fruit Smoothie", as it was mysteriously whipped up behind the scenes in the back somewhere. I would say that next time I'll pay more attention, but unfortunately for you, there won't be a next time. 

After I made my way out of that hell hole and into the safety of my car, I took my first sip of your much hyped smoothie. I was instantly disappointed. By the time the liquid mush you call a smoothie hit the back of my throat, I knew that I had been duped. I took one more sip just to make sure that I hadn't missed something the first time, and threw the rest out. 

McDonald's....come on. You don't make a "Real Fruit Smoothie" by blending up strawberry juice and banana flavored puree with some ice and yogurt and call it a smoothie. You're supposed to use REAL FRUIT! That drink was about as "real" as Joan Rivers face, or Pam Anderson's boobs...you might fool some dumbasses out there, but I think most people would rather pay a few bucks more and get the real deal down the street at Jamba Juice.  I mean, how hard is it to mess up a blended drink? Congratulations McDonald's, you never cease to amaze me....

"Eat rice, drink tea, slurp noodles, stay healthy".  Maybe.

Accept this about all Asian restaurants on the Strip:
1)  Prices are 2x-3x higher than your local joint.
2)  Portions are smaller but prettier.
3)  Flavors are not authentic.
4)  Specialty drinks are delicious.
5)  Service is excellent.

Straight to it, the food.  It's properly cooked by Western standards.  Veg in stir fries are still crisp and vibrant, deep fried chicken still moist, and scallops tender not rubber balls.  Seasonings and flavors are loosely Asian but are subdued and for the uninitiated.  Don't expect undertones of sweet, fermented fish sauce or umame charged fermented black beans.  The subdued flavors do work better with their creative mixed drinks.

Skip the everyday items or risk leaving upset at the price (miso soup at $9, beef broccoli at $25).  Opt for the extravagant.  The lobster tail in ginger onion soy glaze is good.  Correctly cooked.  The simple earthy soy does enhance the sweetness of the lobster and the ginger adds zest.  The togarashi rubbed seared ahi with a miso lime sauce is very good.

The only serious fault remains the sushi.  Questionable freshness.  The Uni, off color and fishy.  The sweet shrimp, slightly ammoniated and tacky mouth feel.  Creative rolls still miss the mark.  Over sauced, unbalanced flavors, bizarre cooking techniques.  Is the chef so vain he can't try one of the many AYCE joints and see how Vegas style sushi is done?  Face it, asking a Chinese chef to prepare Japanese sushi is the same as asking a Italian pizza cook to make dim sum.

To the credit of management, service problems have been correct.  Everyone is familiar with the menu and can describe dishes.  Bar staff who float ask regular staff before making recommendations.

Standard Asian beers.  Fairly priced introductory sakes.  

Want authentic national and regional Asian cuisines, look off the Strip.  Looking for some great cocktails and correctly cooked "Asian" inspired food Rice and Company modestly delivers.

Big yummy breakfast food. AKA comfort food overload deluxe.

My x-brother-in-law told me about The Hash House A Go Go several years ago while we were fishing in Mexico. He said "dude you are gonna love this place, we're going when we hit the docks tomorow, the breakfast there is off the hook."  But it wasn't in the cards as we got thick in the fish and opted for some fresh bluefin sashimi instead.

So fast forward several years, that Hash House place is still ingrained in the back of my mind and what do ya know, while taking a breather from the Venetian's casino I go for a walkabout and stumble on a sign that tells me there is a HHAGG in the Imperial Palace Hotel. So I go thru this construction maze of an entry to the IPH and into the hottest (like 90 degrees) casino on the planet. I go pass the performing blues brothers  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9wjTzw8bEYOTQJk41V8WQw?select=TZSIV-_ypvbTuH7mh_f8cg#TZSIV-_ypvbTuH7mh_f8cg blackjack dealers and up an escalater to find that they are closed! Damn, so I make plans for the next days breakfast.

Wake up at zero dark thirty (6:30) so I can have B-fast before going to the Fabtech trade show. I get there NO LINE! Yes the casino gods are favoring me today. I asked to be seated at the bar for quicker service. This was the first time I ever ordered a glass of milk at a bar, it felt wierd. I then ordered up a Andy's Sage Fried Chicken.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=W3BT2l3t-ifYfCtQ_Q2vbQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

FOOD: Andys Sage Fried Chicken ... This was a giant breakfast, the chicken and eggs atop a couple of biskets piled onto a heap of country style mashed potatoes loaded with bacon bits all covered up with a benedictish gravy with diced bell peppers. This was some good stuff a solid 4 **** Star for me. But less bisket and more of that yummy gravy and it would have been 5 Stars.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VDLsrE-gNdkh8N82jlEo5A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

SERVICE: From the hostess taking my picture http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Eo1U2kj6OyU_a_Kr9pC-6A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw and quickly seating me, to the bar (milk) tender who was way cool and friendly, the service was great, fast and polite. 5*****Stars

I'll be back.

T is for ... Tantalizing Bars & Restaurants
A is for ... Artsy and Hip
N is for ... Never-ending Naughtiness

Every adjective you've heard about the Cosmopolitan is true. It's a chic, contemporary, opulent, decadent, lovely, lavish, romantic, artsy, naughty, and hip hotel located in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip with amazing panoramic views, a bevy of restaurants, and a very cool club in Marquee.

Olivia Z. and me stayed in a luxurious Terrace One Bedroom on the 62nd floor with an outdoor Private Terrace offering a magnificent panoramic view of the neon-lit Strip. The room featured separate king bed and living areas including a kitchenette. The bathroom had dual sinks, shower, and a wonderful Japanese Soaking Tub (that was an amazing way to unwind at the end of each day).

Stay in the East Tower if you want to be closer to the Strip, Restaurants, Marquee Day & Night Club, and Bars. It was very convenient for us. Since Cosmopolitan is next to Bellagio, many rooms (with up charge) offer a view of the Fountains or you can easily walk there to catch a few of the Fountain Shows. Another upgrade option is a Upgrade to a Wrap Around Terrace on a corner which was really promoted when we checked-in.

Resort Fees are $28 and include access to the Gym, Pool, and WiFi (2 devices only).

Self Parking is easy. If you are staying in the East Tower, be sure to drive all the way to the east side of the parking lot for convenience to your elevator. Also, note the shortcut entrance/exit from the east tower, too. Valet is easy, too. It is all done in the parking structure and very comfortable and convenient.

Wicked Buffet is over-rated, but ok. Holsteins, on the other hand, makes an amazing burger (The Risng Sun with Kobe-style Beef & add Fried Egg). Secret Pizza isn't a secret anymore. Comme Ca is a relaxing choice for happy hour. STK and Scarpetta are so-so for the higher prices.

The Cosmopolitan Las Vegas may not be a 5-star hotel or casino, but it is a convenient, chic, contemporary, lovely, romantic, artsy, naughty, and hip place to celebrate and have fun in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip.

The Trump Hotel is a great crash pad when you're in Vegas. It being a holiday weekend, most resort/casinos on the strip were priced pretty high. However, I was able to find a great deal at Trump on Expedia for $109/night. 

We got a great room on the 57th floor facing the strip. The rooms are nicely appointed. All rooms have two doors to get through so you are away from the hallway and it's extremely quiet. There is a kitchenette that is fully stocked with a stove, microwave, fridge, toaster, blender, utensils, pots, pans, plates, pasta strainer, martini shaker and more. You can cook all your meals right inside your room, but there really isn't a grocery store nearby, so it's pretty unlikely that you will. Each room has a comfy king bed and a sofa bed so you can sleep up to 4. The bathroom has a huge jacuzzi tub and separate shower, and a tv right in the mirror. There is plenty of closet space. And there's also free wi-fi.

The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and you'll receive top notch service as you would expect from a luxury hotel. And that's all it really is. It is NOT a resort/casino. There are only two restaurants, one bar, a pool, spa and gift shop. Which means you'll be spending most of your time being entertained at other places. While it's located across the street from Encore/Wynn and next to the mall, it is set back from the strip, and you will end up taking taxis everywhere you go. So, on one hand, it's nice that you don't have to walk 20 minutes through a casino to get to your room, but if you're there to gamble, this is not the hotel for you.

4 stars for the value and the great customer service. Plus, they allowed early check-in and late check-out. But if you want to go all out, I'd suggest Palazzo or Encore.

I don't write many updated reviews but I believe The Parking Spot deserves some Yelp love.

 I've been using this place for about 4 years and the service is consistently superior. There's covered parking so your car is not baking in the sun so you're less likely to come back with an unbearably hot interior. You get a USA TODAY paper when you enter the facility and a bottled water for each occupant of your car when you leave the facility. That water really hits "The Spot" after being subjected to the heat when you're coming back from a temperate climate. You can sign up for thespotclub which you can link your credit card for payment and keep track of the points you use which can be redeemed for free parking. In fact, I called the customer service people at their corporate headquarters because I changed my email address and couldn't get into the site online. For some reason my points were gone too. But they restored my 2,000 plus points within minutes. I guess they thought I was inactive since I hadn't been on the website in years.

All the shuttle drivers are friendly and take care of your luggage (commercial here, Please tip your drivers). They give you a card to remind you which parking space you parked at such as I211. They respond quickly at the terminal when you call and say you are ready for pick up. I usually fly out of terminal 3 so they pick you up at door number 5 on the North side. The vans are air conditioned, what more do you need.

Also, the people that are at the booths are excellent as well. When you call, they know how to answer your question properly. They direct you where to park and take care of your payments at the booth. The Parking spot advertises in the magazines in front of you on your airplane. So you can usually find a coupon for 20% off. I believe a 24 hour stay is $10.95 without coupon. Also, you can get three hours of parking by showing your AAA Card. So if you want to meet people inside the terminal and don't want to pay for airport parking this is what you do. And if you decide to park for more than 3 hours you can use your AAA Card for a 10% discount. They have another service where they'll wash your car by the time you get back. 

There's a Parking Spot 1 and a Parking Spot 2. This review is for Parking Spot 1 on Washington street.

Alot of things go into a fabulous experience at a club.

You need a fabulous space.

Fabulous people.

Fabulous prices.

And lots of fabulous space to bust out your fabulous moves.

Tao - was an impressive fabulous space, but the people and number of them crammed into one dance space (the downstairs area was much less crowded, but not much was happening) were short of fabulous, we couldn't score a seat unless we had ordered bottle service, and the price of entry for the guys in our group as well as the drinks once inside were far from fabulous.

So overall Tao was not the fabulous experience we had hoped over.

There were two creepy baths, boasting two naked women sitting in rose-petal water as we entered. Both women looked bored and unimpressed, and at the moment I knew our night at Tao was not looking up. The music was erratic Top 40 stuff, like most of the clubs in Las Vegas, and once we made our way to the second floor dance area, we were bombarded with throes of pushy girls. 

With no room to dance or move, we managed to squeeze our way into the VIP section and ended up partying the night away with some friendly Welsh guys, which helped the night pass a little smoother, but after about an hour and half we couldn't get out of Tao soon enough.

If you're OK not being able to bust out your fabulous booty shake move, cause you'll probably boot out five girls from the dance floor in one shake - you have so little room to move - then come here - you'll probably have a good time. 

But if crowds aren't your thing - ask the locals for a good club recommendation that night - and go there instead.

Trust..

BurGR is definitely a fun place.

I'm not a big fan of GR's TV persona or schtick.  Though there is something positive to be said about his mercurial nature and focus on detail.  So, given our short eleven hours in Vegas, we decided to come here.

At the heart of BurGR, you'll find some good food and I believe GR poking fun at himself.  The restaurant has several photos, as does the menu, of him hands up in a fit of mock anger.  I believe, there's a wee sparkle and impishness in those eyes.

So, what about the food you say?

It's good!  Very good in fact.  And, those BurGRs are worth every penny of the $14.00 to $17.00 you'll pay to enjoy them.

The reason isn't too hard to understand.  Given that mercurial nature, GR chose to cook the food: "Paying special attention to not only the ingredients but the method, beef patties will be cooked over an open flame fueled by hard woods."  

So it isn't too difficult to see why they have a complex smokey taste, that layers nicely with the various toppings and ingredients. 

We had the American and Euro BurGRs.  The Euro (photo) came with truffle aioli, goat cheese and arugula, while the American came with american cheese, butter lettuce, tomato, pickles and red onion.  Both were delicious, though the Euro was more interesting on the palate.  GR's focus to detail even shows up on the selection of the bun. Nice!

Another WOW if you will, were the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Seems the BurGR fries are "hand-cut and thrice cooking will ensure extra crispness" and they use Kennebec instead of Russet potatoes  which "offering a lighter, less starchy and crisper fry"  

Okay, we agree.  But what makes them special, is the hair like shavings of parmesan cheese (photo) with a special aioli oil sauce for dipping. Ohh, are they good.

So, with a glass of wine, a nice pint of Leinenkugel on tap, a couple of BurGRs and some of those wonderful Truffle Fries, expect to pay around $27.50 each, not including gratuities or taxes.

Enjoy!

We were downtown chic last week and attended a Mercury game (VIP I might add...for whatever that's worth!) and dined afterward at Hanny's. WOW! Walking in I felt the heaven's had opened and the choir was a-singin'! This space should be my home. Beautiful, modern decor with the right lighting casting a soothing blanket of warmth. Nice. Greeted immediately we sat at a high top table near the window. I was so consumed with the fabulous company I was with I hadn't realized something. We. Were. The. Only. Diners. A few bar flies scattered around the bar in the middle of the room. 9:15 on a Thursday. My heart sank. Or was I actually slipping off the bar stool from those two $9 beers from the Mercury game? 

The good:
Well, service was swift and friendly. Though he seemed a tad nervous. Perhaps because we smelled of lesbians. Not sure. 

Ambience. Duh! Covered that. Including the restrooms and the glassed in elevator shaft. I still get dizzy just thinking of that!

PIZZA. Yep. I never would order pizza in a non pizza place. Rickie did. Rickie won. Rickie ate. Carne pizza. Order it!

The bad:
TINY martinis. Who makes these? Barbie? Tattoo from Fantasy Island? The Lucky Charm leprachaun?

Empty room. Bummer. I like a good, energetic, lively vibe. But we did entertain ourselves with lively banter about nothing important and most certainly became shallow and caddy. Realllllly, makes you want to hang out with me, eh?

The ugly:
My sandwich. The prime rib, with thick slabs o bacon, fried egg on ciabatta. Steak Umms. Was all I could compare it to. So disappointed. One thin, thin, thin, strip of, er, um, prime rib *cough* *cough* Steak Umms. Dry. Bland. Overcooked. Like my Aunt Helen after too much Chardonnay at a backyard BBQ. Onion strings, however, FANTASTIC.

My other diner/Mercury fans were OK with their sandwiches; I remember one had pork the other hard boiled eggs. Not sure exactly. Sorry. Those $9 beers really did a number on me. 

The good Part 2 Electric Boogaloo:
Onion strings! Had to repeat. 

I WILL GO BACK TO YOU HANNY'S. It was sort of like an awkward first date. Started off dicey. In the middle we had some laughs and wiped mayo from our lips. But did we kiss at the end of the night? Hmmm...not so sure. 

Let's see what happens on that second date.

I had seen this food truck at many a Saturday morning market here downtown, but I never paid them much attention.  Then one day I did because I was really hungry and in a rush.  The result was awesomeness!

But the large posted menu is kind of deceiving.  It presents their 4 standard dogs but doesn't fully speak to the uniqueness and deliciousness of their food, nor does it really give you all your options, which are plentiful.  These are some of the things you should know, that you probably won't realize from their menu:

They come on naan fry bread, not buns.
(Though you can request buns, but that would be silly.)
This does not come across on their board anywhere, but it is the foundational magic of their product.

They let you choose your own wiener.
[insert bad joke here]
They have traditional, veggie, bratwurst, and my favorite: beer-hot.  The beer-hot with the naan is the best combo ever!

They have about two-dozen toppings.
You get a hint of this in the descriptions of their standard-four, but it helps a LOT to see the toppings listed out (plus they have some that don't show up on the standard-four).  They have the list up on a small laminate menu by the window.

Their ingredients are mostly local, and some are organic.

I've gotten a beer-hot w/ fresh jalapeos, swiss, cilantro, and red onions; and also a bratwurst w/ sauted onions, sauerkraut, and spicy mustard.

Bottom line is this truck needs more accessible marketing, because they have a GREAT product!

Those who know me will tell you I am one difficult person to impress, a fact that still has my mother wondering where she could have gone wrong. But I promise you I can be impressed, and when it does happen, even I get a little chill up and down my spine. 

If you hope to get my attention, especially with food, you better hit all the right notes at all the same time. From presentation and taste, service and atmosphere, right up to the bite you take out of my wallet, everything needs to fit just perfectly together if you hope to get a rave out of me. You can have the world's best food, but if I have to wait an eternity in line, or drop a small fortune, or suffer miserably apathetic service, then even the world's greatest food can suck.

But when everything you do fits perfectly together; when the food is good and the service is friendly and the price is a bargain, that's when you're doing things right. 

And then there are those rare occasions when all those elements come together, except the food is not simply good it's extraordinary, that's when you're going to start making some serious impressions in my book.

Imagine for me, if you will, a simple bacon cheeseburger. If you are like me, it always has been, and likely always will be, one of life's great guilty pleasures. 

Now imagine that simple bacon cheeseburger: with thick-cut smoked bacon, silky-smooth gruyere, arugula, and perfectly seasoned, grass-fed beef with just a hint of garlic aioli on top. Add all those elements together with the understated genius from The Blind Pig's kitchen and you have a bacon cheeseburger that requires no additional adornment, that challenges the lines of what makes a great burger. If you can imagine that (or better yet, if you can stop by The Blind Pig and try one for yourself) well then you will know firsthand what it takes to impress me - and I can promise you, I am very impressed.

Everybody knows you can get some really great burgers in Vegas these days, but I always find myself walking out wondering whether the extra cost and extra effort were really worth it. I will hold The Blind Pig's $12 "BP Burger" up against any burger in this town and say simply - "beat that!"

Can't wait to try what's next.

When Denny's at 1am is the best meal you have had all day, you know something went horribly awry. 

Really I have nothing good to say about PastaBar other than I'm glad we didn't have a wait at 8pm on Friday night, but that is not saying much. 

The bread sticks they serve in the beginning? Dook 
Wine and beer selection? Also Dook. 

All three dishes we ordered came out lukewarm and the portions are really unimpressive, especially for the prices. I was not wowed one bit by anything, including the fried mozzarella. (which, btw, came AFTER our meal despite the fact that we ordered it first, as an appetizer....) 

Our server was a nice lady, but the service just wasn't good. The food wasn't good. I don't like the decor. I think its overpriced. 

I would really rather have gone to Olive Garden and paid $8.95 for the all you can eat pasta, salad and bread sticks. At least I would have been full when I left.

Thanks Denny's for saving my night.

What a let down this place was.

Probably my mother's favorite place for siu laap!  Since she lives in Glendale, I'm often asked to be the delivery gal to bring her roasted duck, boiled chicken with the head still on, and roasted pork whenever she needs to do some Chinese ceremonial tradition.  If it's not me she's forcing to do the grunt work, it's one of her co-workers.  Regardless, even if it's on the east side, it will always show up to Mommy W. fresh!

I first came across this place when my friend invited us out for dinner.  It seemed to have all your Americanized and authentic foods.  Service can be a bit of a wait but it's definitely worth your time.  Kudos to the chef for making such amazing flavorful food.  Prices are reasonable and the place is clean.  I haven't tried any of their lunch specials but my friend says they're pretty decent.  They make a delicious Mussels with Black Bean Sauce and their Salt & Pepper Shrimp is pretty amazing as well.  And there's nothing like some rice soup [aka porridge] when you want something warm.  It's the Asian chicken noodle soup [comfort food].  I stick with either the pork with the century egg or the fish fillet porridge.  Momma W. makes it best but Best Hong Kong Dining is a close second.  

The only reason why I don't frequent here as often as I should is because parking is always a pain.  There are some other eateries and a grocery store in this strip plaza so parking can be pretty sketchy.  You know us Asian drivers.  Look out!  :P

So I tried going to Drais MDW. That was a fail. I shall literally break it down.

It was after midnight Saturday night when I text the promoter Kim Paul, asking him the price for entry that night. $30 for men, $20 for women is what he said. So awesome. We were set to go. Everything else that night was over $100 for men.

We reach the cashier. Chelse, blonde, thin, early 20s. My girlfriend pays $20 cash for herself. Left is me, 1 other girlfriend and her boyfriend. I was going to pay with my card and they were going to give me the cash. So she rings me up for a total of $70. Sounds right: 20 + 20 + 30.

No. She says "now what about her?" (Referring to my friend right beside me). I said "yeah, $20, $20, $30." N she looks at me like I'm stupid. "No it was never $30 for men. It was actually $40 and that was before guestlist which closed at midnight so it's $50." I tell her "the promoter Kim Paul just told me it was $30. So I want my money back." She says "sorry, there are no refunds" all super bitchy like she owns the place. Lol. So I said "ok well bring me a manager on duty." She says "sure."

Comes back with another doofus and after I explained the situation, he said nothing. Just went to tapping on the screen. After 10 minutes, I get a "void check testing admission" receipt but total said $0.00. I ignored it and left assuming he should've known what he was doing. I'll check my account tomorrow. Silly me.

So here I am back in California calling everyday asking for a manager. On Monday I was able to reach Victor Drai's assistant. Woman. Don't recall her name. She took my name and phone number and also check number from my receipt. Of course they aren't going to call me back, so I call once a day asking for Victor Drai not knowing he was the owner. Just hoping it was the person who would post void the transaction already.

Well he was not happy to hear from me. He answers with his strong Moroccan egotistical accent "how the fuck did you get my number" and "what the fuck do you want" and "give me your fucking number my assistant will help you, not me." So I say "well she's the reason why I call asking for you because she was not able to help me." He says "you're making that up" and again "I'm not going to help you. Give me your number. Do you want to be fucking helped or not!?" I respond with a "Wow you are ridiculous" and he clicks.

I call back and finally a normal person answers and asks how did I get Victor's number. I simply said I didn't. They transfer me when I ask for him. So he new guy gives me the general manager's email so they can help me. I pray to God this is the end of it.

By far the worst customer service experience ever.

I always reward myself after a long run so after a short rest in my hotel room following the half marathon this was the first place I headed to.  

Located on the main level of the Bellagio Resort & Casino the little bakery is difficult to miss with scores of interested passers-by stopped in front admiring the World's Largest Chocolate Fountain (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=Fwze61auOtWIO7qqZftfoA and http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=NNY_w4GCH3S7XDDwwT6EMw) as confirmed by the Guinness people.  Many people seemed to focus in on the delicious Santa (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=vrgekS99XPXpSALLiAv8hA) too as the bakery is all decked out for the holidays.

Decorations are nice, but my focus of attention went straight to the bakery case because all of the little desserts (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=cUvmX9TR0T-SsadcR6CXCw and http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=xd8x-dTVzmXltk3mMp2Bow) on display looked fabulous.  They even had sugar-free selections (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=OliyqIlWdwkr3ssI_z--Vw)!  Everything looked great, but something else I had glanced at earlier caught my attention first.

At the very front of the bakery behind a sheet of curved plexiglass is a crepe station where you can watch as freshly made crepes are prepared on a hot griddle.  They had two crepes on display, a mixed berries crepe (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=Y23VBoGim8Vl8JSUTUQM5w) and a chocolate decadence crepe (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=NHqifygfOqSomQpVOprLyQ).  I ordered one of the chocolate ones.  It took a bit of time to be prepared, but the overall product was worth the wait.  The display crepe actually looked better and had a bit more chocolate and a lot more powdered chocolate, but I'm thankful because the crepe I was served was sweet enough.  The chocolate pieces, shavings and glazes were decadent alright and the crepe was nice and chewy.  I didn't eat all the cream as I felt pretty bloated after this dessert.

I didn't stop with the crepe either.  I returned to the counter and ordered a single chocolate-covered strawberry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=S4rtxwJXeLP4BGi5lakoYA) to take with me to eat at a later time.  My strawberry was a bit squished by the time I returned to the hotel, but it was still delicious nonetheless.  I had fun licking the chocolate off the side of the bag.

The bakery serves gelato also and has a nice assortment of boxed confections on display.  There are other crepe selections also other than the two that were on display.  Jean Philippe Patisserie was the perfect reward to an excellent race.

El Dorado Cantina is one of my favorite new restaurants in town.  This definitely rivals Javier's at Aria for the "high end" Vegas Mexican cuisine market, but the prices are way more reasonable.  Chef Paco and his staff are churning out some really good stuff.  

Want a great way to spice up a weekday dinner?  How about doing as the Aztecs did back in the day (century) and start off with some grasshoppers?  Yes, sir!  EDC's "chapulines" can be prepared sauted either in garlic lime or habanero.  For the uninitiated, the closest thing to compare them to would be crispy shrimp tails but juicier.  The habanero order offered terrific heat and not in a painful, shoot me in the face kind of way.  At $7.50, it was a large portion that could have easily satisfied a party of six.  Not for everyone by any means, my wife was literally one and done, but I enjoyed it and had plenty to take home (fried rice, anyone?).

"Imperial Shrimp" was everything I look for in an appetizer: seafood stuffed Pacific wild shrimp wrapped in bacon and then lightly fried. The creamy heat (sounds gross, right?) from the chipotle ranch dressing that accompanied the dish was awesome.  More things in life should be wrapped in bacon!  I should start a national campaign.

We chose to split the humungous carne asada entre.  The citrus marinated steak was medium rare perfection.  I loved the big slabs of grilled cactus that it came with.  We probably boxed up 70 percent of the plate.  Goddamn nachos and salsa....

You'd think that would prevent us from ordering dessert, but the flan and tres leches cake somehow made it to the table.  The latter was plated nicely and the rum flavor made me feel like I was on vacation.  It was a great end to the meal and I can't wait to try more.

Rosati's Pizza is my go to pizza joint. They are basically a carry out place. I live too far away for delivery. So that tells you how far I'll travel for an excellent tasting pizza.

They currently have this special where you buy a large and get the medium (excludes the toppings) 1/2 off. I hope I haven't let the secret out on that special. It's been going on for well over a year. I always bump into a lot of Chicago people when in here. I always get a bigger pizza than I can eat since it's the perfect breakfast food. After all, who can resist some reheated pizza the next morning for breakfast!

I really like the thin crust but my family prefers the deep dish. So I'm stuck eating deep dish all the time, lol. This is the best tasting pizza I have had in Arizona. The Cenpho folks might want to venture out of their box and try this pie. This is something even the east coasters would enjoy. 

Once in awhile they'll even mess up your order but they are quick to rectify it if you give them a chance. And once in awhile they'll even burn your pizza a little. Even with these rare annoyances I keep coming back to this Rosati's location every time.

I came here because a group of us were downtown.  When I entered I thought that it was a stupid gimik but I went a long with it because I was hungry and in a hurry. 

We ordered our food and when it arrived it wasn't the greatest.  It didn't taste that great and the atmosphere was cheesy.  

While we were eating we heard a couple come in and ask to be seated.  The nurse at the front told them that they would have to put on a hospital gown.  The girl in the couple looked at the gowns and noticed that they weren't clean.  Thats when I looked mine over and noticed that she was right.  She immediately said that because she has been diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; she shouldn't be forced to wear that.  I know someone who lives with that disorder so I know that they have high anxiety when it comes to cleanliness.  The nurse argued with her until the girl asked to talk to a manager.  The nurse yelled across the restaurant to an old guy in a Dr outfit who claimed he owned the place.  

He arrogantly asked "what's the problem," in the same tone the nurse was having with the two patrons.  The girl stated that she didn't want to wear the medical gown because she didn't trust how clean it was and the manager said, "leave then!"  

The girl responded, "you would rather us eat somewhere else instead of voting with our dollars here?"

The so called manager started to get in both of the couples faces in an aggressive manner.  The male part of the couple was just standing there and didn't say a word until the manager started to make the couple feel apprehensive. The old manager then threatened the guy after the couple had exited the front door.  Thats when the guy started to stand his ground and call the manager out as a coward.  The guy told the manager to come at him if he wanted to threaten him otherwise he should go back inside and eat a %@)#.  "You obviously like a lot of meat in your mouth."  I started rolling after that and expected the manager to do something.  

I thought the situation absurd because the so called 'owner' threatened a couple who wanted to pay to eat at his horrible restaurant.  Then when the manager was bowed up to, he had to cowar back and close the door.  

I wont be coming back to this place after the way I saw patrons were treated and after I saw that the restaurant won't make exceptions for someone who has been diagnosed with a disability.   The "owner" made the situation worse and made himself look like a coward.

Recommendation:  Take it all off!  Get in the bed nude!  (Stop it.  I'll get back to this).

Note:  This review is for Aria Sky Suites, the hotel within the hotel.

One of only 83 Forbes Five Star and a AAA Five Diamond award winner, Aria Sky Suites is the pinnacle of "rentable"  Vegas experience (once again, stop it).  This is the home of the much talked about Sky Villas.

The experience begins with complimentary airport limo service.  Arrival through a gated, private entrance.  Extends to a private checkin where your daily news paper choices are noted, your personal itinerary discussed (if you used the concierge book shows and make dining reservations - best seats and impossible to get tables included) then  you are swept to your suite.

Suites and villas are contemporary with excellent finishes.   Yes, you will probably play with the kitchen faucet for five minutes before finally figuring out how to turn it on, another five staring at a 5'x5'x2' "cube" and wondering who would want to sit on that until you try it and yet another thirty trying to program your room kicking yourself for telling the bell man you could figure it out on your own.  In the end, high tech and comfortable.

Master bathrooms are massive.  Each bedroom has its own.  Marble and glass throughout, his and her vanities, separate area for the ladies to pretty themselves up, separate tub, steam shower, separate water closet with heated seat and washlet, and full walk in closet with a safe large enough for most full size notebooks..  That little zip-lock bag slowing you down at TSA?  Forget it.  All toiletries are provided.  Teeth too good for Colgate?  Contact the concierge and have whatever you want ordered to your suite.

No worrying about throwing used towels on the floor to be replaced.  If it's used it's changed (including your sheets), not once but twice daily with turndown service.   The bedtime chocolates are wonderful.

Friendly and professional service throughout with no air of snootiness. 

Suites start around $600 per night for high level mLife members.  Book through the mlife.com for the best rates.  You do need to pay the dreaded "resort fee" but for the budget conscious, there is a 24/7 private lounge that provide all the bottled water, juices, soda, coffee, tea, and fruits you want.

Oh yeah, the sleeping naked tip.  Just do it.  Sheets are softer and more inviting than any clothes you probably own.  Turn down the AC and enjoy the cocoon of comfort.

Gluttony at it's best!!

This is an AMAZING deal!! On a weekday, it's $50 (with total rewards card; $55 without the card) for 24 hours of food!! if you have rewards credits from gambling, you can use it to pay for your buffet! I used mine and got my gluttony pass for FREE!! On the weekend, the rate goes up... $75. the timer starts the very minute you buy it. I suggest starting at dinner like I did to get the most for your money. I probably wouldn't also do this deal on a weekend as the main thing I notice about the weekend is champagne with your meal and since I don't drink that, I do not want to pay extra for it. 

Anyways, the buffets included are (1) Spice Market @ Planet Hollywood, (2) Le Village buffet @ Paris, (3) Flavors @ Harrahs, (4) World Carnival @ Rio, and (5) Paradise Garden @ Flamingo. For a SURCHARGE of $10 you can eat at Village Seafood Buffet - TOTALLY worth it!!! For a SURCHARGE of $15, you can eat BREAKFAST at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers; for a SURCHARGE of $20, you can eat LUNCH at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers; for a SURCHARGE of $25, you can eat DINNER at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers. 

If you want to eat at Caeser's, which is a VERY good buffet by the way, I suggest just eating there WITHOUT the buffet of buffets pass. I think the surcharges for Caeser's is too high, and that's probably due to how popular it is at the moment. Lunch there is $30 on a weekday and $50 for dinner... go during lunch and time it for dinner. The only difference I noticed with cold crab legs...

Anyways. it IS worth it to add the Village Seafood buffet. For my 24 hours of gluttony, I ate dinner at Spice Market ($30), breakfast at Le Village ($20), and dinner again at Village Seafood Buffet ($40). I wanted to really fit in a lunch, but woke up late and ended up having a late breakfast that didn't end will about noon already... otherwise I would had gotten more for my money's worth. In the end, I spent $60 for $90 worth of buffet... and if I had woke up in time and timed my meals better, I would had even gotten more of my money's worth!

I think this is a great deal for food!! Since you have the pass, go during off times to avoid lines and not waste time waiting... Next time I do this, I'm going to get in 4 meals!!! It's also nice because if you are craving a snack, you can also just stop into a buffet, grab some drinks and dessert just because!

If you eat like a bird however, then this is not the deal for you!

The Cosmopolitan's  "grand social experiment".  It delivers!

Walk in to be greeted by five doors.  Some leading into turn of the century meets Star Trek rooms, others, well...  Spaces morph, the experience evolves, life happens all around you.  Live bands, eclectic music, spontaneous vaudeville acts and a stage production, good food, great craft cocktails.  You need to experience it to understand.

Essentially it's a craft cocktail ultra lounge, stage production, and mega club and restaurant all in one.

Breaking it down:

Craft Cocktails - Excellent, many reinvented, from classics.  Very consistent (a rarity when some cocktails contain 10+ ingredients).

Stage Production (Vegas Nocturne) -  Similar to Absinthe.  Acrobatics, comedy, tap dancing, strip teases. No more details as you are sworn to secrecy.  

Club - Still need to experience this.

Restaurant - Inventive and indulgent.  Many items to be shared like the outstanding caviar mini tacos (Yukon gold shells filled with hamachi and drowned in caviar), deconstructed oysters Rockefeller (fried oysters on a bacon butter sauted spinach and bacon dust in an oyster shell) or the tete de cochon (deep fried panko crusted head cheese topped with a poached egg).

For larger dishes, the reinvented beef Wellington (beef tenderloin with a generous portion of seared foie, trumpet mushrooms, studded with cream spinach, topped with shaved black truffle and crowned by a flaky, latticed puff pastry is very good albeit rich.

Incredible caviar service (five types sold by the ounce, half kilo, kilo).

Outstanding wine and champagne list.  Ultra lounge prices.

Tip;  To make the most of your experience:
1.  Make a night of it.  Drinks, dinner, and the show.
2.  Move through the rooms.  There is something different in each.
3.  Make reservations if you want to eat a full meal.
4.  Purchase your tickets in advance for the show.  Don't skimp.  Pay the $135 for the best seats.
5.  Shows are not the same.  The later you go, the edgier.
6.  Be prepared to spend $$$$.  The show, dinner, and some cocktails averages $300 per person.  Add some caviar and bottles of wine and it's easy to drop several dimes.

Now if only I can remember how Alice got home after falling down the rabbit hole.

Buffets should end with you smiling and patting your belly, after having unbuttoned your pants to fit in one last round. When u find yourself at your table sharing the same look with your friends: that blank stare out to nowhere, playing with your food and wondering why you didn't spend that 25 bucks on the Monopoly or Sex and the City slot machine or all red, you know u ain't happy. 
What sucks is that, we came here as our last hurrah lunch before heading home, having eaten many delicious meals- we were pretty disappointed.
I should have listened to my gut feeling after seeing rates of this place dropping in their latest yelp reviews.  It wasn't unsavory looking as the lower end "buffet of buffets" buffets, but it certainly made me wonder what i would be getting if i spent that 40 bucks for dinner on a peak day. Would it be that much better? Or more of the same stuff... A whole station devoted to tortilla chips with only red and green salsa was a bit of a turnoff. 
The dishes i did enjoy were some pork slider thing, leek dumpling, bacon, and hashbrown ball. They had a small selection of Thai and indian food which you dont' find everywhere- but they were ordinary.  What we found ourselves doing, was mixing up some of the dry dishes with the saucy items to make things more interesting... eating our cookies with the icecream or frosting off the cupcakes. The mini cupcakes were cute http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=uJVqblRmMmvsl3P6pkU_KA, frosting was ok, but i am not a huge fan of glitter on my cupcakes. but since we were in vegas, where glitter is a common accessory- i ate it anyways. Frosting was not bad!
Atleast it was very pretty in the atrium where we were seated!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=VIoLtKLPGWmd-H5HZBNDRQ

Wicked spoon is still better and i need to go back to M Buffet, which i remember was pretty good a couple of years ago.

Okay, I've been beaten into submission. Yes, you can enjoy a wonderful dining experience in a restaurant that serves only buffet.  Jasmine Tokyo is that place!

Our merry little group included ring leader, buffet master extraordinaire Rand H, along with Robyn N, Mike C and myself.  As noted elsewhere, Jasmine Tokyo is located in the old Claim Jumpers space, near the corner of 70th Street on Shea.  

Both the exterior and interior hasn't changed that much either.  The only difference you'll notice are the huge buffet stations that run down the middle of the restaurant.  On the right side, as you come in, they've re-positioned the bar to the back and added a huge sushi station. I have posted a zillion pictures online.

The food was extraordinary.  It wouldn't have been better, if it was prepared individually in the back.  Everything was fresh and served in smaller, more manageable portions.  This is one of those restaurants (buffets) where you can only take a small amount of food on you plate, because you want the opportunity to try everything.  According to Rand, they have nearly 130 different choices, including eight different gourmet ice creams.  The ice cream by the way, is the only food item that is served to you upon request.

My bill was $11.99 before taxes, less a "20% Yelp Discount" that came to $10.66 including taxes, but before tip,  Our server Mirian F was outstanding and always there refilling our glasses or cleaning our table.  Very nice.

Enjoy!

I usually only eat Papa Murphy's once or twice a year, but when I do, I enjoy it. I already knew what I wanted when I walked in. In the past, when they have a special promotion going on they have some already made in their cooler to keep the long lines down. This time though my pizza was made fresh right in front of me. I asked for a "Heart Shaped Pizza" priced at $7 and included 1 topping (additional toppings extra). For an additional $6, I added "Cheesy Bread" and "Cookie Dough" to complete the meal. 

Different types of pizza here take different times to cook. I had the original crust so it needed to be baked at 425 for about 12 minutes. The pizza came out nice and tasted good. I baked the cheesy bread at 400 for about 10 minutes and it was pretty good for what it was. If you are going to buy frozen pizza at the store, you might as well come here and get something you can customize for about the same price and it tastes better. The pizza and cheesy bread are baked on the trays they come on, but they do offer instructions if you would prefer the pizza to be baked on your pizza stone or grill. The cookie dough comes in a tub and you bake in on your own sheet. I baked the cookies at 375 for about 10 minutes.

They also offer stuffed pizzas and at home pizza kits for kids.

Better than a food court but not by much.

Part of a growing chain (18 restaurants in 11 states).  It's not fancy.  No build your own anything.  Make a "concept" selection, choose either burger, chicken, or turkey.  For beef burgers, choose a doneness level.  Opt for plain or "crunchified" (silly addition of chips in the sandwich).  Done.

The dcor looks like a burger exploded.  Ketchup red, mustard yellow, golden bun, grilled beef brown.

Burgers are cooked to order, relatively juicy, decent beef flavor but grossly under seasoned.  Not good for mild burgers but welcome for spicy creations which are SPICY.  Toppings are fresh.  The Philadelphia Burger (provolone, griddled onions and hot peppers) packs a spicy punch but is good eats.  The LA burger (avocado, watercress, tomato and cheddar cheese) is so mild the burger is lost.

Definitely NOT a fan of the "crunchified" burgers.  The addition of chips adds a distracting textural contrast and nothing to the taste.  

Simple sides.  The beer battered onion rings best of the bunch.  Fries just OK.  Soggy at times.  The mayo, roasted red pepper, chipotle sauce it's served with is spicy and flavorful.  The sweet potato fries with honey mustard horseradish sauce is a better choice.

Very good, rich milk shake with pronounced flavors (the pistachio is worthy!)

Excellent service.

Overall, inexpensive for the Strip but not worth the pilgrimage or the wait.  This is Vegas.  X times the money does equal X times the pleasure.

Wicked Spoon is simply over-rated. The desserts are the best part and do leave a good last impression, but compared to the elite buffets of Vegas, Wicked Spoon doesn't have the quality, service, freshness, or variety to be considered 5-star. It's a-ok which is totally a-ok.

Sunday night dinner: 3 - 3.5/5 stars

There were no stations for fresh, made to order items like pasta, crepes, salads, etc. Instead portions are placed into small bowls like a cafeteria. There were no fresh sashimi or sushi offerings except two California rolls. The Snow Crab was average frozen fare. Salmon was meh. No XLB. Asian food looked like Panda Express.

On the positive side, Bone Marrow was cool (though not spectacular). By far the most spectacular section is the desserts. 2 flavors of macarons were chewy fun and Red Velvet Cookies were worth a try. Save room for the Gelato and get a couple of the huge Chocolate-covered Strawberries.

Service was fine. Our waitress brought drink (Mojito) re-orders and cleared plates as expected. She earned her tip.

If you are at the Cosmopolitan or nearby hotel then the Wicked Spoon is an a-ok option when in the mood for an AYCE Buffet

A tour de force of Spanish cuisine.  

A meal at E is a dining experience capturing the excitement and joy of discovery through food and conversation.  This exclusive restaurant within a restaurant is a tapas bar on steroids.  Modernist cuisine at its finest as molecular gastronomy collides with traditional techniques.  This is one of the greatest foodie adventures bar none.

There is no menu.  The offerings change with the seasons.  Unfortunately, the incredible salt crusted foie from the fall of 2011 is not a part of the current winter 2012 offering.  All good.  

The ingredients are incredible.  From selections of sublime, umame packed cured ham to the sweet earthiness of roasted Iberico pork to the salty brininess of quality caviar everything works to create flavor explosions.

Sure, every course may not be to your liking but with the huge number of courses, you are sure to find something you can't live without.  The progression of dishes is very bold.  Courses compete with one another, with each making a bolder statement than the last.  Utterly incredible.  

Desert lovers rejoice, the meal ends with multiple deserts.  The only way to describe them is WOW!

Opt for the wine pairing.  The selections tie the meal together perfectly.  

The entire evening is engaging.  You watch the chefs prepare and plate the majority of dishes right in front of you.  Conversation between the chefs and your fellow guest is encouraged.  It is an extremely social meal.  Just wait until you start sharing wine from the porron.  Unintentionally missing your mouth and pouring wine on your face and down your neck is a real ice breaker.

There is only one way to make a reservation at E, through email.  Don't bother calling the Cosmo.  They can't help you.  Send an email request to reserve@ebyjoseandres.com with the number of your party (not to exceed eight), and a range of dates and times.  A restaurant manager will respond and ask about any food allergies and dietary restrictions.  If your restrictions can be met and if there are openings, your invitation will be confirmed.  You will receive your golden tickets via SNAIL MAIL.  Bring them with you.

Probably the best $250 you will spend at a top restaurant anywhere.

An open mind and open heart?  You will have the time of your life.  Highly recommended!

Bachi has a breakfast restaurant?! What!! Obsessed with Bachi Burger as it is, and super disappointed by their ramen, I'm glad HLK lives up to the Bachi name. 

My friends and I are fatties and had the Bella farms foie gras de canard (torchon, jelly, marcona almonds, cornichons, cranberry walnut bread) as a starter. Delicious! It has a pretty thick layer of duck fat on top as well. Yeah, as disgusting as you may feel thinking about eating straight up fat, who cares? Spread that stuff on! 

I had the wild mushroom hash (potato, kale, gruyere, egg, fried onions, bechamel) as well as the corned beef hash (potato, brussel sprouts, onion, egg, bechamel) . No, not all too myself, I'm not that much of a fatty. Disappointed a bit, because none of us were asked how we wanted our eggs cooked. On both hashes they came over hard, which I hate. I love runny yolks, don't take that away from me! Especially on a hash. But other than that, they were both delicious. Corned beef had good flavor. 

Friend got the braised short ribs loco modo ( two eggs, fried rice, onion rings, orange lentil gravy). Looked bomb. Meat was tender. Braised for thirty six hours. 

Also tried the crispy sweet chili chicken and waffle (apple bacon, brussel sprouts, green onion waffle, curry butter). Chicken was very moist, and the sauce on it was delicious. Unfortunately they only put it on one of the pieces. Waffle was ok. Butter ess definitely the high point of the waffle. You get three choices of syrups (maple, coconut, blueberry). 

Overall, good experience. Great service. Thanks Adrianna! Definitely a come back spot.

I love social media. 

Not.

I've been coming here for over six years and found Mike who manages this Leslie's location to be the best. He knew all his customers, knew their likes and dislikes and always went the extra mile to make them happy. 

Well, along comes a new customer who tries to return something that has been opened without a receipt.  Now Mike doesn't make the rules at Leslie's, he just follows them and says, sorry but without a receipt the best he can do is an exchange. 

Well this customer isn't happy about that and takes to social media and writes a very long One Star review, about how terrible he has been treated. Btw, I see now it's been abridged to a few sentences

Guess what, after nearly twenty years, Leslie fires Mike. Now, I don't know Mike personally, I don't have his cell. But I read the review and decided to come in to tell him not worry about it. He was only doing his job. Well, no Mike. I'm told he was let go because of the incident 

Well Congratulations new Yelp'er, you got someone fired. Nice!

Now here's my story. I came in three weeks ago for some sand for my pool filter. The new Manager Peggy says Leslie's is running a 20% off special and they'll replace and install my sand for $180. Well it sounded too good, so I tell her I'm going to think about it and may I get back to her? No problem, the offer is good until Labor Day. 

Guess what?  I come back last weekend and Peggy is gone, been replaced by a really nice, sharp new Manager Bru-Lynn. Seems Peggy er, is no longer with the company. 

So I tell Bru-Lynn I've decided to take the  Leslie's special and replace my sand. Guess what? Apparently there isn't a Leslie's special going on and Bru-Lynn needs to check with her Regional Supervisor to find out what to do. 

Let me be clear, Bru-Lynn is great! Love her! Think she's the best! And yes, I still wish Mike was here. 

So she checks with her Regional Supervisor and I'm told, they're really very sorry -- did I get anything in writing?

I came here for snack before going to Marquee.  Holsteins offers gourmet burgers, @ very high prices.  They also offer salmon and chicken options, as well as apps like wings & calamari.  In addition, you can also get foie gras on your burger for $12 extra.  Lastly, Holsteins offers bamboozled shakes w/ liquor at $11.

I ordered the Gold Standard ($18 - Dry aged beef sirloin burger w/smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli).  Sweet potato fries or rings are a $2 upgrade.  

Unfortunately, the burger should have been called the "Old Standard", because it was a basic burger w/ bacon on top.  The burger wasn't that big, didn't have any distinctive flavor, and it was nothing special especially for the price.  I can get an equivalent burger & fries for much less.  The same goes for the fries.  They were nothing special:  Both 3 Stars.

The ambiance was typical sports bar w/ a bar obviously, lounge seating, and the regular dining room:  3 Stars.  The only thing that was superior was the service from Toshi the bartender.  He was super cool & friendly.  He also comped me on a drink, so I gave him the cost of the drink as an additional tip ($10):  5 Stars for Toshi.

Holsteins is a pricey place to have a burger if you are staying at the Cosmo.  But I would definitely not go out of my way to come here.  However, I would go out of my way to say hello to Toshi, and just have drinks.

So glad I tried this place! El Regio is similar to Roberto's, but way better! Upon walking in I was greeted by the man behind the counter who pointed out the menu board and was helpful in going over it with me and hubby. I told him I purchased a $10 for $20 yelp deal and he took it with no problems. 

I ordered an "Adobada Taco" priced at $2.39, "Cheese Quesadilla" priced at $2.49 and a small drink priced at $1.25 with free refills. All our food was made fresh to order. The adobada taco was the main star for sure. It packed a lot of awesome flavor! Everything about this taco was just fresh and tasty. The quesadilla wasn't greasy at all. The tortilla had good flavor and the amount of cheese was perfect. Hubby ordered a "Carne Asada Burrito" priced at $ $4.89 and a "Shredded Beef Taco" priced at $1.99 and he enjoyed his a lot too. 

Next to the cash register is a salsa and veggie bar. I used the green sauce for my quesadilla and it was so good! If you are in the area before 9 am you can get a breakfast burrito for only $2.49! There is a digital board on the front window promoting their current specials so I don't know  how long it will go on for, but it is the current special right now. 

El Regio is located on Tenaya near Ann Rd just off of the 95. They are open 7 days a week.

Don't get fooled by the Trio of fries!!!

If i see a fries sampler, i always want to get all of them. It said on the menu- waffle fries, steak fries and petit fries. You would think petit fries would be shoestrings (a neighbor made the same mistake), but they were just mini waffle fries. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=F4NLspbB1o4xetDmIEKmXQ. You're better off just ordering two different kinds. We ended up too full and not even finishing half of the trio order. Good to share though between 4 people or more. 

I got the signature burger Le Paris. Comes with brie, caramelized onions and bacon. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=5ZAFIRT5zqm6FeTlTH-9zg Tony got the Le Blue http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=t3WtvkSrPOn7tGN-TZwrLw with blue cheese, avo and bacon. 
The burgers were decent, but at 12 bucks each, i wanted Uhmaaazzing and they were not. The hefty burger patty was perfectly round and flattened, but i like my hamburger kind of mishapen so you get those nice charred marks around the edges. 

Service was friendly, everything tasted ok, but i wasn't wowed enough to add to my vegas favorites.

I know, I know, this is a brand new steakhouse in Vegas and I probably committed every faux pas in the book by ordering the fish. But I did it. And I don't regret it for a minute.

FOOD:
---------
As our group asked for my opinion on appetizers, I knew I had to select the **Smoked Pork Terrine** because it offered the sublime foie gras, of which I have been deprived for ages, being a Californian and all. Combined with delicious pickled figs and pepper jelly atop a piece of bread, this appetizer was everything I wanted and more.

I was a little worried that choosing the **Roasted Market Fish** would be a total mistake, but it was delicious! It turned out to be Sea Bass with a tomato paste and zucchini relish. The bass was prepared perfectly, being sufficiently firm while also smoothly melting in the mouth. This would rival any bass from an acclaimed seafood restaurant. I sampled a piece of Anna's **Porterhouse** and it was divine. I would definitely order it on my next visit.

For side dishes we got the roasted mushrooms, asparagus, creamless sweet creamed corn. We all thought the asparagus could have used some more flavoring or some sort of creative twist, but the corn was a huge hit with its buttery smoothness.

SERVICE / AMBIANCE:
-------------------------------
Absolutely outstanding. Every member of the staff we encountered was on point, very warm and helpful, and extremely professional. Our server had an entertaining sense of humor. Even the busser impressed us with his refined gestures.

The decor is mod and clean with beautiful wood accents everywhere. The open kitchen in the back is a nice touch.

Of course you get what you pay for, so be ready to lay down some cash. For four people (3 steaks, 1 fish, 3 sides, 4 drinks), we each fronted about $100.

DATE TIP: With swankified dining at its best,
How could your date not be impressed?

Recently I was invited to a dinner which featured several of the most famous Las Vegas Japanese restaurant owners. It was unanimous in their opinion that they believed RAMEN TATSU was the best TOKYO RAMEN-YA in America. Yes, you heard that statement correctly. TATSU is NOT a Kyushu Ramen-Ya, it is a TOKYO style Ramen-Ya that specializes in Shoyu style broth. If you don't believe me, ask the owner himself. The owners name is Wayne and he is a very respected man in the LV Japanese-American community. 

RAMEN TATSU is unique in the fact that all ingredients are natural/organic style. Wayne uses three different types of natural chicken bones for the broth in his Tokyo style ramen. He also uses three different types of natural pork bones for his Tonkotsu ramen. No other ramen-ya in Las Vegas goes this far out of their way to produce such a rich broth. Many Japanese yelpers express that the reason California(Sawtelle Blvd) ramen is so much better than LV ramen is because the California places use this style of cooking. The cook and owner has been the force behind many of the popular ramen-yas in Los Angeles. He was the man responsible for the recipes which have now achieved notoriety, the same recipes from the LA ramen-yas that attended this years Ramen festival at the Rio Casino. 

The signature dish at RAMEN TATSU is the Shoyu-Tonkotsu fusion. This variation of ramen has become increasingly popular in modern day Japan. It's origins stem from the Kobe area, where it has become a new subregional variation of ramen. On account of the fact that Wayne is from Kobe, he has many years of experience preparing this subregional variation.  The recipe at TATSU remains unchanged from the recipe from Kobe while Monta's Shoyu-Tonkotsu is not the authentic recipe, instead it is merely an invention of the Kurume cook(who is now a Brazilian dude), who mixes his Kyushu broth with a generic nonaffiliated shoyu broth. What I am expressing is that RAMEN TATSU has the only authentic Shoyu-Tonkotsu in LV. And, this is the item you should order during your next visit.  

The Curry- During your next visit at RAMEN TATSU, you should not neglect the Japanese Curry. TATSU uses their own secret recipe which facilities a unique taste which upon my assessment is superior to CoCo Ichinbanya and Kaba Curry. In a demonstration of unique cooking styles, the Chicken broth from the ramen is used as the backing for the curry. Wayne's own particular Gram Masala is then instilled into the broth, and combined with three different types of vegetables. The resulting product is curry that is as addictive as Mr. Zenbayashi's recipe. And during a recent conversation with Mr. Zenbayashi, even he verbally approved of Wayne's recipe. That is a major compliment coming from the man who runs the highest rated Curry-Ya in yelp history. 

They also have Shio Ramen which is great for older Japanese folks. A lot of older Japanese people like my Dad refuse to eat Tonkotsu and Miso Ramen, and eat nothing but Shio. 

I will argue that RAMEN TATSU is the most authentic Japanese Ramen-Ya in America. It remains true to the regional recipes in Japan, and the owner refuses to submit to western pressures to "Americanize" his recipes(as you can see, many of the negative reviews are due to the fact that the recipe is not americanized). For example, Wayne recently terminated contracts with noodle suppliers because he felt they were not completely authentic to Japanese standards. For the last few weeks, several Japanese noodle companies have been competing for the contract, while Wayne assesses and samples them all to determine which is the most appropriate. The whole reason that Tsukemen is no longer on the menu is because Wayne demanded his distributors send noodles which were 100% authentic to the dish and made in Japan. He would not accept anything lower, and would NEVER serve an item that wasn't 100% authentic to the traditional Japanese recipe. Tsukemen will return shortly from my understanding. This establishment represents the Japanese culture very proudly and will not give into the pressures to westernize the menu. This is the reason there is no Togarashi. This is the reason there is no Srirachi. This is the reason why there is no cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon. Just like the owner of Kabuto, Wayne won't breech protocol which was established in Japan by the Japanese, for the Japanese. And I respect him a lot for this. Complaining that there is no  Shichimi Togarashi at a ramen-ya is like bitching to the chef at Kabuto about why there is no California rolls while you soak your chutoro nigiri in a mixture of shoyu and wasabi that you plan on eating with a fork. I have to say that I vouch for RAMEN TATSU and encourage all the Japanese-American residents of LV to support this business. 

Just a final note- The music they play here is the theme music to the Final Fantasy games, and old school anime like Cutey Honey, Candy Candy, and the Miyazaki films

We ended up at the airport with a few hours to kill, and wanted to have a decent meal at a sitdown restaurant, versus a fast-paced sandwich shop.  We were in the C Terminal, and Zinc looked like the best option.  The menu was pricey, but that wasn't completely surprising being in an airport and our expectations of the food quality.  Unfortunately, we were wrong.

The French onion soup was a good version, but for $14 it needed to be better than just good.  And that was the highlight of the meal.  The steak frites were a complete let down.  It consisted of a flat iron steak, served medium rare.  I guess you have to pay extra for flavor, because it had none.  And the steak itself was so tough and full of fat that it was difficult to chew.  The frites were basically frozen shoestring fries, loaded up with some kind of red seasoning that was also flavorless.  The only thing that made the food passable was an orange sauce that accompanied the steak.  I'm not quite sure what it was, and it wasn't that great, but it was the most flavorful component of the entire meal.

I would go one star based on the food alone, but the service was good and it was one of the only places in the terminal where you could sit back and relax, and not feel rushed.  Just plan on eating somewhere else first, and maybe hitting Zinc for a couple of cocktails and skipping the food.

i have two words for you: herb baguette. I'm not a bread lover but this baguette doesn't need anything to taste good. Forget butter and don't bother dipping in olive oil. How is it possible that bread be so moist, dense, airy and flavorful all at the same time? I have no freakin' idea and that's why I have to buy from Gluten Free Creations, because there's no way I could replicate that. 

Okay okay I have no qualms with gluten. I don't really care what it is because it doesn't seem to affect me negatively, but why should only the celiac kids get the good stuff? And yes, I have tried to find this place twice before and failed (are gluten eaters stupid-er? possibly) but third times a charm when I stopped in this week. I'll admit it, I was looking for a cupcake. I think we all know about my cupcake addiction. GFC sells cupcakes in a 4-pack, which I can't support because that means I have to eat 4 cupcakes and I'm already killing myself at the gym for my one-at-a-time habit. But seriously, they had gluten free banana cupcakes! I was so sad they didn't have a spare to sell me...so sad I bought the mini herb baguettes and a brownie. 

The brownie was a two-person affair, a big frozen delight filled with thick chunks of chocolate. I couldn't tell the difference between it and a gluten-full brownie and that made me very happy. I think it may be time to start the "what makes a good brownie" debate; I feel like it will be a volatile one. I like them chewy with chunky bits. But the fluffy ones are nice too. 

 Truly though, the hero of the day was the herb baguette, which is a little smaller than a 6-inch sub, takes a long time to toast, but is worth the wait. I topped one of mine with farmer's cheese, roasted garlic and roasted red peppers. And I sat at the table crying because I knew each bite I took meant there was one less to take in the future. 

I love you Gluten Free Creations. I'm feeling smarter already.

So hard including this name "Mon Ami Gabi" in our conversation
Frustrated friend: "Augh I don' t know, the Gabi thing in front!!"

Came here because
1) Right in front of our hotel
2) They specialize in slabs of cow :)***

I was very set on ordering the filet mignon with merlot butter once I skimmed the Yelp reviews and was told by our waitress that it was Mon Ami Gabi's house special.

By the way, we had the most thorough and humble waitress. She didn't constantly check on us, but made sure that the our food was delivered as ordered. 
She noticed that my girlfriend's cesar salad was dressed when she clearly said "dressing on the side," but my friend insisted it was okay. At the end, the waitress apologized as we got a free ice cream profiterole with hazelnut chocolate sauce. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=DVi5g-v4i81TzV_X5owU2g ..APOLOGY ACCEPTED!!

I would say the filet mignon was too legit (to quit), I know why they're known for it. It seemed to be cooked medium at first upon the sides, but later realized that toward the center it was medium rare as I requested. I expected the size to be "petit" but it was big enough for me to feel guilty for leaving some behind. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=zxQGjORGM_oGCDJZX0IYNg

I wish they had better sides than the frites, they reminded me of chips. I prefer something creamier, less oily & fried things for my steak sides (heh).

Everyone else enjoyed their meal, and everyone was entertained/distracted by our friend trying to slice our table's loaf of house bread. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=Z6_9c7qeqRbbY2VQX3im4g

Finally!! 

I've had the Charcoal Room on my list of eats since I moved out here a few years ago.  My neighbor, some co-workers, and even friends/family from California even recommended the Charcoal Room to me. But when it came to other Yelpers, most haven't been here or reviewed them.  The Charcoal Room has a lot of pros and very little cons.  You don't get what you pay for here, you get more.  And if you're having steak, you get a lot more.  I got their petite filet and it was delicious.  Their petite is about 6 oz, juicy, and most importantly, very tasty. Don't let the price fool you.  For less than $30, I had a steak that rivals some of the 5 star steak houses out here.  My filet was so tender that I think I used a butter knife to cut through it.  I had my steak with a side of their Caesar salad, lobster corn chowder, sauted mushrooms, and asparagus.  All portions were huge and I ended up with leftovers. My GF opted for their roasted chicken and baked sweet potato.  Her meal was hooked up too.  I swear she was served half a chicken and a football sized sweet potato.  She said her meal was good as well.  

I have no complaints about the service.  We were seated right away, our orders were taken, and our food was served in a timely manner.  I left the Charcoal Room very satisfied and my only regret is not coming here sooner.  We got a lot of food and paid less than $100 for it.  Yes...I'm sure I will be back.


PS: No pictures of their steak and no pictures of their fabulous forks.  I was focused the night I ate here....focused on my beautiful date.  1OAK!

If you want a legit donut then come here to Friendly Donut House! Even if you don't live in the Henderson area, this local run mom & pop business is worth the drive. After hearing so much about it from yelpers and co-workers, I met hubby here for a quick breakfast before work and wasn't disappointed! When I walked in there were several old timers hanging out talking, playing cards and reading the paper. There was this instant family feel that was comforting and inviting. The woman behind the counter greeted us and was patient with us while we made the hard decision of which donut to try. We picked out our few donuts and when I asked if they had any milk, the woman behind the counter said they had regular and chocolate. I was so stoked to see it was "Anderson Dairy" milk! I grew up on that stuff and am addicted to the chocolate milk. Score! The smaller milks were a $1 each. 

So we ended up with a "Bear Claw", "Apple Fritter" and "Cinnamon Roll" that were $1.75 each. The bear claw was filled with apples and it was SO good! I never thought that I could find a place that comes close to my favorite donut shop in Placentia, Ca, but this place does! I split the donut in half with hubby and was pleasantly stuffed. Even though I was stuffed, I managed to take 2 bites of the apple fritter and couldn't believe the apple explosion in my mouth! This was a fritter that had tons of apples in it and all the textures a fritter should have. The cinnamon roll ended up going to one of my co-workers because we just had no room left and wanted someone to enjoy it fresh. How does anybody ever decide on one donut at this place? I will have to go full on and get a dozen to take home next time!

Friendly Donut House accepts CA$H ONLY!

FOIE GRAS...F-orget O-ther I-nsignificant E-xperiences G-et R-eady (for an) A-mazing S-andwich at Goodwich.
That is what possessed me to drive from Henderson to Downtown with a growling stomach looking for a unique lunch and not settle for everyday boring because my usual lunch date has stomach issues.
I get to this little shack around 12pm with normal looking people standing in line...not a weird downtown crowd at all. I didn't know what everyone meant by "OG"...until I looked across the street and saw OG Topless Bar (good landmark)...maybe where the bad witch lives lol.
I walked up to order looking at the simple menu (with descriptions of ingredients, yay) knowing I was going to try the much talked about "Foie" even though I had a lot of apprehension from never having eaten foie gras in my life. I was bewitched by all the positive descriptions everyone posted about this sandwich that I had to have it...good, bad or otherwise I was going to try foie gras today. The gentleman who took my order was very reassuring that it would be a treat for me and that at $9, it was a great way for me to try it and not break the bank. I found an empty chair to eat that made me feel like I was a young student at school having my favorite sandwich at lunch.
As you can already tell, I LOVED it! Such a strange combination to put together but it all works. Foie gras mousse/terrine that had a creamy texture with light earthy, almost truffle-like hints (not at all gamey), this very crispy thick chicken skin (like when you hit the crispy skin jackpot on a perfectly roasted chicken), chopped almonds, and pickled purple cabbage that made sense as a necessity to cut the richness of the foie gras, all inside a grilled crunchy white bread that scrapes the inside of your mouth a little. Creamy, crunchy, savory...I couldn't believe this taste explosion that I enjoyed with each bite to the last. Oh yes. I finished the whole thing! I was really blown away how
 much I enjoyed this sandwich. It was life changing lol. It would be wonderful to see Goodwich occupy a space in the upcoming Galaxy Market in the Arts District...a space for artisanal foods, craft brews and aspiring restauranteurs.

(This is an asian persons attempt at rapping, I'm sorry in advanced)

*Throws a beat*

Shit I feel like a balla right now...

I should have a prostitute on my left arm right now...

Where the prostitutes be at right now...?

Oh shit, this place is fancy right now...  

The prostitutes must be high class in disguise right now....  

Scanning the room looking for hooks and tricks right now....

I'm not quite sure why...but I thought it would be fun for right now...

I don't really know what me and the prosties would do, maybe grab a coffee and discuss how they got into the biz maybe...who knows?  *pictures Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman*  Naw I ain't that lucky...

This hotel is new, and with new things comes an exciting new smell.  Like buying a new jacket and wearing it out the store.  Or driving out of the car dealership in a brand spanking new Benz and sniffing the leather.  It's all about the small little things that matter.  And this hotel didn't miss one detail.  Everything was impeccable, down to the wallpaper, amenities, service, decor, rooms, staff.  No detail was left unworked.  Even the crystals in all the lights in the hallways made me smile as they twinkled.

The bars and shops inside this hotel were beautiful, except everything was honking expensive so I didn't really buy anything except drinks.  The pools are beautiful, the spa offers deliciously decadent services and massages.  I have no idea if they have a gym because I didn't go looking for one because I'm on vacay!

The room was like a mini apartment, careful for the mini bar though because if you move the bottles they'll try and charge you!  Make sure to check!

The bed was super comfy, the tv that controlled everything in the room was really cool, the balcony view overlooking the strip was stunning.

There are so many things to see and do in this hotel you don't even have to leave.  We barely left the hotel to do anything because its like a little city in here.  No need to venture out into the elements :)

About a week ago, our AC finally gave out and died.

We have been trying to keep it alive for the last five years.  Freon, new blower, condenser, still more freon, welding a leak, a new outside fan and heater switch, and finally still more freon.  

So I found myself around midnight searching Yelp for HVAC businesses and couldn't find any in my area.  I then tried "Air Conditioning", nothing.  Finally I expanded the area and found Flores, 

Parker and Sons, George Brazil were also listed.  But after reading a few reviews, I decided to go with Flores.  They had over 55 reviews, by far and away the most of any HVAC business. Of those 55 reviews, an incredible 49 were Five Stars. I also saw and read many of my Yelp friends, and decided to give them a call the next morning.

I knew before they came, that our time was up with the old unit. Though I held out some hope that maybe there was a possible stop gap measure. But it was pretty clear what was needed to be done.  

I spoke to Miguel and Jorge for a long time and we agreed they would work up an estimate. No charge for their hour long visit and stating the obvious. Very professional. 

The next day I received by email an indepth estimate for the new unit and air handler. We had a very old four ton Trane unit which was too small for our house. 

The new Trane unit was going to be five tons (see photos). After reviewing their estimate, I stopped by Costco and other places, as well as searching online. Everywhere, the estimates were at least $2,000 or more higher than the Flores' estimate

I gave them the go ahead and it took a little more than a week. They arrived early yesterday morning and put drop cloths down throughout the house. I was very impressed. 

Flores is actually four brothers, who work very well together. They all have their own specialty. Seems they've done this before. LOL

They arrived at 7:30 am and finished around 5pm. When they were finished, the house was at 89 degrees. It took less than twenty-five minutes for our new AC to get it down 73!

The final bill came in exactly at the original estimate. Wow!  Thank you Miguel, Jorge, Carlos and Jaime!  If I could give you guys Six Stars I would.

ToGo isn't quite the new kid in town, but they are trying hard to make a go of it in the Valley.  

ToGo's origins are NorCal, with a huge following there.  Here, they've met with mixed results so far, closing some locations including one in Scottsdale. 

Their choice of locations have been somewhat puzzling, with no natural customer base like a school or large office park nearby. The other nearby Togo's location (Chandler/Tempe border) is tiny and shoehorned next to a Fry's.  I've driven past it many times not knowing it was there, but this one is much larger. 

My two co-worker and I made a trip here for a late 1:30 lunch one Friday. There was only five or six other here. So it gave us time to chat with the Manager and have him give us a nice introduction and overview to Togo's.

The subs were very good. But the bomb is their Pastrami. It's a killer. Expect to pay $8 including a drink for a small sub, or $10 for the large waist buster. LOL

There's also a frequent diners card and an email club you can join to get online specials. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free drink, see photo. 

So the three of us are now Fans and enjoyed our Four Star meal.

I love Mom and Pop run businesses. 

I was driving along Chandler Boulevard, saw the sign "Family Run Business" and decided to stop.  

There is so much homogeneity in our dinning experience today. Everything is so cookie cutter. 

Yet with that uniformity comes time tested (and test lab) food tastes, that makes us come back for more -- no matter which city or town we find ourselves in. 

But if you are tired of the "same old, same old" as I am, you keep your eye open for these places. Don't get me wrong Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ isn't perfect, but it's a nice change. 

Last night I ordered their Combo Dinner.  That's two specialty smoked meats, two sides, a soft drink and your choice of breads. I went with the Brisket, smoke polish sausage, garlic mash, apple cobbler and jalapeo corn bread for $10.99. They do the same thing for lunch at $7.99. 

I found Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ "A-Okay" and Three Stars good. The meat had a nice smokey taste that lasted after my meal, while the sides were little bland and the corn bread had no kick. BTW, what's with all this 4 Sq signage? I didn't even know they were still in business. LOL

***Aria is very generic, but the rooms (especially the bigger ones) are comfortable and very nice; it also has a good location, but you really have to walk to get to The Strip***

Aria is one of the new very tall hotels at City Center in Las Vegas.  Here is a rundown on the pros and cons (a pleasant experience overall).

Pros:

--Nice rooms.  Contemporary, clean and comfortable.

--Location.  City Center is near a lot of the action (with casinos like Caesars and Bellagio closeby).

--Lots of places to eat in the hotel.

--Because of its newness, the smoke smell is less strong.  Still, I feel Bellagio and Wynn are better at clearing out the smoke.

--A different option.  Not as "theme-like" as other casinos.  This could be a pro or con depending on how you feel about those "theme-like" casinos, but at least it provides an option for those who are looking for something else.

--The interior/decor of the hotel/casino (like the rooms) are modern and sleek.

--The exterior is pleasant to look at and all glass (very similar to the Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott at LA Live).

Cons:

--While Aria is located on the Strip, it is a little bit of a walk to get down to the sidewalk to visit other casinos.  I like walking in Vegas, but this may be a con if you are not wearing comfortable shoes (or need to get somewhere quick by foot).

--The rooms are small.

--I think their rates are a little higher than other serviceable hotels nearby.

--I only tried one food place (Cafe Vettro) and it was not good.

--While this place is a different option, the lack of a theme or style gives the hotel kind of a too simple feel.  Once again, good or bad depending on your perspective.

I haven't stayed at many hotels in Vegas so it is hard for me to rank Aria, but my experience at Aria was pleasant overall.  Since Aria is near a lot of casinos I like, I would come back, but I would do so only if I got a good deal.

Note: They have little packaged accessories (such as an iPod auxiliary cable and charger) next to nuts and candies on the counter.  These are obviously things (expensive things) you can buy (like the minibar).  The items are weight sensored so if you pick one of them up, the hotel automatically charges your room.  So you lift it, you bought it.

They will take it off your credit card if you picked it up to just get a better look.

Trivia: Aria was featured on a recent episode of ABC's The Bachelorette.

When we first moved here six years ago, we really liked going to Flo's. Their dishes were tasty and interesting to the pallet.

The two of us came for a late lunch and thought wow, things have gotten very expensive and the food was just okay. 

I agree with everything my friend Marvin A wrote in his updated review just a few months ago. http://www.yelp.com/biz/flos-scottsdale-3?hrid=TJuxgsGDqv6OjBCHJk7gpw   Also, my friend Scott D brings up some very good points as well. http://www.yelp.com/biz/flos-scottsdale-3?hrid=l4MSDHKXs1IDBvKn1TjaHQ  So I call your attention to both of their reviews. 

It seems Flo's no longer has a Luncheon Menu, only smaller portions of their regular dinner menu. We decided to start off with some pork Pot Stickers for $5.00. We were vanquished, so I decided to ordered two (if only to have some for later, or so I thought). These however were minis, barely half the normal size (see photo) and bland

Our lunch entrees were Chicken with Cashew for $9.00 and the Chicken Asian Peanut sauce over noodles for $11.50 (photos). Both were okay, just not memorable as we remembered eating in Flo's in the past. 

We were saddened to see the direction Flo's has taken. There is no je ne sais quoi anymore. So our return factor is pretty low, though we might give them another try at some point. 

Our lunch bill came in at $30.50 and our server Irene, was very good and kept our water glasses filled. So two and a half stars and barely "A-Okay". Now, where have you taken Flo?

Wynn wins in my book, as far as buffets go.

I am not much of a gambler or a buffet person, but I come here to increase my odds of being a winner.

Since buffets are almost always a quantity over quality compromise, this place is not for everyone.  I'd rather dine at Michael Mina's, where I can get a lobster pot pie and their Kobe beef with seared foie gras.

My attitude is that I am not going to eat like a pig so that I can get my money's worth.  I simply enjoy their wide selection of food presented in a classy way and savor the beautiful experience.

Certainly, you will see some diners, like Yelpers Cat C, Janice C, Flora C and Angelique Q, pigging out on the crab legs and prime ribs for a few hours.  

I, on the other hand, love to sample a little of everything.  Think of the buffet as one HUGE INTERNATIONAL SAMPLER PLATTER, which includes salad, fried rice, shrimp cocktails, bacon, soup, Mexican food, crme brulee, crepe, fruits, dim sum, sushi, prime rib, king crab legs, fish, grilled meat, and gelato/ice cream.  Plus bottomless champagne!

The fiddy-dollar meal is not going to break anyone's piggy bank, so don't overstuff yourself.  Save $12 for their brunch.

If you are a buffet fanatic, this is your first choice destination.  Bellagio takes second place.  Third comes Rio.  

The staff is very attentive and friendly.  Seating is comfortable, but there is a long line to get in during peak hours.

Most importantly, the bathroom is close by.
It is true that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.
So did my #2.  Wooooosssshhhh!

I dedicate this review to Janice C.  She's half-Chinese.

I wanted to like this gym. I really did. It's gorgeous, after all, and their salespeople do a great job of talking it up. 

First off, I have a very busy and ever-changing schedule. This probably made me a poor candidate for this gym to begin with, as their hours and classes are limited. Anyway, I visited the gym in April and was impressed with the sales rep, the facility, and the quality of trainers. I had very limited time that day (the story of my life!), so I filled out a little card (I did not complete any membership paperwork) and left to carry on with the day.

In May, I began the stressful and lengthy process of home buying and got even busier! David Barton Gym began charging my credit card, and I was fine with that.

Come June, I'm still absolutely slammed and haven't been able to get to the gym. At this point, I had been getting repeated phone calls from these clowns asking me to come in and fill out the paperwork. With everything I had going on, David Barton Gym wasn't a priority. I was fine with them charging me the membership fee. I had no issues. But what did they do? They threatened me. They started telling me that I would be charged MORE because I hadn't filled out the paperwork...

Long story short, I decided this wasn't the place for me due to bad customer service and asked them to simply stop charging my card since I had never officially become a member anyway . I didn't ask for any refunds whatsoever. What did they do this time? They refused to stop charging me unless I filled out the membership paperwork. 

Huh? OK...well, long story short again: Silly me capitulated and signed the membership paperwork along with the cancellation paperwork at the same time, again never asking for a refund. However, David Rivera (who is great, by the way - I feel sorry that he works for that company because he deserves better) insisted that I accept a refund for May. That was a nice gesture. I kept telling him it wasn't necessary, but he insisted so I finally accepted.

Fast forward to July. No refund from David Barton for May as promised, and I didn't really care at that point. I had closed on my house and was in the midst of cleaning, preparing, and moving. It had been a CRAZY two months, and the David Barton Gym was the last thing on my mind.

When I finally got a chance to get my files in order after the moving process, I discovered that David Barton Gym had never STOPPED charging my card! I was in possession of cancellation paperwork that indicated no further charges would be made after May, yet I had charges for June and July.

Making a long story short for the last time, it's August 14 and I STILL haven't received a penny back. I'm left with the conclusion that this place condones fraud and tries to get away with it whenever possible. The General Manager, Greg Refner, has no customer service skills (and no desire to serve or be fair to people) and certainly no urgency for anything...unless it's getting someone to sign membership paperwork under duress. 

I am really appalled at the way in which this entire debacle was handled. I'd suggest staying away from this place at all costs, no matter how glamorous it may seem.

The dumplings are their saving grace. One star for each dumpling I ate. Everything else was pretty bad.
First off, they ran out of plates. What kind of place runs out of plates?! The waitress gave us little plastic dipping cups instead.... which doesn't help.. Secondly, I don't think they train the staff very well because when we asked for napkins, she gave us 3 pieces.. we had 4 people in our party.. I mean, give us a little more. No need to skimp on paper napkins... And third (which was the worst), they ran out of dumplings! We ordered pork & zucchini which came out right away however, she said they were still making the pork & cabbage. We thought it would be maybe a 15-20min wait... but we ended up sitting there for over an hour. If they were out, she could've told us at the very beginning so we could've chosen a different flavor or just skipped it totally. 
The four of us ended up cancelling the pork & cabbage ones since we had to leave. Very disappointing. Lucky for them, their dumplings reminded me of the ones my grandma use to make back at home. The skin is hand rolled and chewy just the way I like it. The dumpling is stuffed to the brim with porky goodness and the juices drip off the skin once you bite into it. Dip the dumpling into some vinegar and hot sauce and you have the perfect dumpling. We also ordered some of the apps such as the chicken wings (skip), popcorn chicken (good), and liang ban fen pi (noodles were too long, difficult to mix with the non-existent peanut sauce). Just stuff yourself with dumpling goodness. 

TIP: Wait a few more weeks for this place to work out some of their kinks before you go or you might not even be able to get the dumplings!

It is with a bit of sadness that I write this review.  But I am sure that it will be therapeutic in the end.

I took my little dog here for the past 5.5 years.  Most of the time, he went here for boarding and he loved it.  When he would arrive, he would jump from seat to seat in my car and the care takers in the kennel knew my dog and they all loved him very much.  My dog loved this place.  

I liked the indoor/outdoor kennels for him because he liked to run around.  At the end of each visit, my baby boy would come home exhausted from all the jumping and excitement.  Depending on how long he stayed, sometimes, he would just rest for the first day back home.  He loved the excitement of barking at the other dogs and bouncing bouncing bouncing around.

My little guy was also cared for very well when he went here for boarding and I also allowed the doctors there to take care of his veterinary needs.  Once when I was out of town, they phoned me to tell me that the doctors had taken a look at him to make sure he was ok because he seemed to be having some problems.  I appreciated the call.  The doctor that I spoke to explained to me the symptoms to look for when we arrived home.  I did, but never saw them and he was healthy.  VERY healthy.

My dog, unfortunately, got out of our yard and was hit by a car.   I had to bring him here for the last time.  I called the office before bringing him down, as he was already dead and I just didn't know what to do.  Misty was so kind to me and helpful and comforting.  I was understandably upset by it all.  But she comforted me when I needed it and had the paperwork ready for me when I arrived.  I was given all of the information and options for handling my dogs remains.  I paid and I went on my way.  

This office is great.  While some may complain about the prices, I know my dog loved it here.  I would recommend them over and over again.  I know Jack would.

XS is a gorgeous club, no doubt. Plus, it's huge and you can go outside when it's getting cramped inside. However, like most clubs in Vegas, the cover is expensive ($30 for guys, $20 for girls and Encore guests - there's no guestlist), the drinks are nearly $20 a pop, and terrible, terrible DJ. I personally cannot stand mash-ups of terrible hip hop songs, but I guess the majority of club-goers are down with that and/or have short attention spans. They seriously need to get some good celebrity DJs in there -- they make enough money to have one every night.

The doormen and staff are actually really nice, and luckily we got to bypass the insane line. It looked like the line was rather quick though, and they started letting people inside on Friday at around 9:30pm.

The huge pool area is a nice place to lounge, and you can get bottle service out in the cabanas as well. The bartenders work fast, so getting drinks from the bars isn't a problem. 

There are a lot of beautiful people (ow! 8/14 gallery, page 6 http://www.xslasvegas.com/flash/index.php), and the go-go dancers are pretty hot... so yes, there are a lot of things that make XS way better than all of the other big clubs I've been to in Vegas. It definitely feels glamorous, not trashy. Expect to spend around $100 per person. But then again, money ain't a thing when you're in Sin City!

FINALLY, a place for hipster wannabes from Assfucklandia to circle jerk!!!  It's ABOUT FUCKING TIME I was able to overspend for a drink and mingle with douchenozzles in ascots and Morrissey glasses...what took you so long, downtown Vegas?! Is there any way I can get a punchcard -- mortgage your house 10 times to buy drinks, get one percentage point free? Where do I sign up?????

I'm on the fence about all this downtown boosterism, but on the whole, progress is good... so I went in to support the new local bar. Sure, it SCREAMS douchetown from the outside...but I did go in with an open mind, I swear.

I bit my tongue while navigating the thug mooks manning the velvet rope out front (!). I bit it again when I shelled out $10 for a drink that costs 1/3 that right across the street. But after hanging out at this place for 3 hours, I ain't biting it no more.

So many annoying things about this place. There are these weird sort of security-types loitering around inside who can't/won't answer your simplest questions. The whole fuckin' reason I went here was to check out the upstairs patio, but it was closed. Why? No one knew. I wanted to order one of the hot drinks that are labeled "upstairs" drinks, so wanted to know if they were available though the patio is closed. No one knew. Finally found out from the waitress that they were NOT available, so ordered one of their corny specialty drinks...and it was served incomplete, without the special garnish that is an INTEGRAL PART of the drink. If you're gonna charge exorbitant prices for "mixology" drinks, at least make 'em right!! 

The other annoying aspect is the music -- it's so LOUD! My vocal chords were seriously strained after spending a couple hours here, trying to chat with my date. And that was before the DJ even started up!

Speaking of the DJ, he was the only cool thing about this joint. I expected a douchey hipster type, but he turned out to be an awesomely frumpy older dude with a beer gut, Coke-bottle glasses and stringy, balding hair. He looked more like a children's party clown/secret child molester than your average DJ, and for that I give him MAJOR props.

I actually do genuinely love this bar.......because it keeps all the pretentious assholes in one place, so I don't have to deal with them elsewhere on Fremont St.  So enjoy that $10 jizz fizz, asswad -- I'll be across the street. I'd rather drink among degenerate bluehairs in a smoke-filled casino bar ANY DAY! Hell, I'd rather drink Thunderbird out of a paper bag in the old Ambassador parking lot with that Santa Claus wino....GUARANTEED to be more fun than shouting til your vocal chords are raw with the stuck-up asswads in Commonwealth!

Yesterday was a mistake.

We had a Unofficial Yelp Event setup by Phoenix Buffet King Rand H., along with Masha Z., Arlin B., Mike C., Robyn N., Norm R. and myself.  We were early I guess, arriving at Macaroni Grill just after they opened at 11:10.  

I couldn't tell if there was any other employees here, because the only one who greeted us was the Bartender. Not a good sign.

This foreboding aside, we had a very nice time. One of us bought the table two appetizers, while another a half-priced 1.5 liter bottles of Italian "red" wine. If we stopped there, along with the bread and EVOO, we would have rated Macaroni Grill a lot higher.  

BTW, our bartender/ server, order taker, chief bottle washer was outstanding!  Though she looked tired towards the end of our visit, after covering several tables and the bar!

I ordered the Lunch Combination "Duo" of Caesar Salad and the Capellini Pomodoro pasta.  Both were very good but pricey at $8.50. The bones of the menu are very good. But it looks like the cost accountants are running the restaurant again.  This was the same problem back when Brinkers (Chili's) tried to increase the margins a few years ago.

Let me be specific.  The serving bowls were tiny, tiny, tiny three inch, by three inch ceramics (see photos). So even when you add a delicious, well prepared, flavorful pasta dish, along with a salad in the same size bowl -- how do you charge $8.50? The same pasta dinner comes in a huge bowl for $11.00. So, if this is a business person's lunch, then I probably wouldn't be returning.

Sorry!  I guess I was wrong.  The old Macaroni Grill isn't back.

Feeling like pizza, I called in a order for pick-up. The girl who took my order was friendly and said my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes. I headed over and upon walking in I was quickly greeted by the hostess who rang me up and asked if I needed any crushed red pepper or parmesan cheese added to my pizza box. I sat only for a couple minutes before my pizza was brought out. The inside looks very clean, but I was glad I placed my order for pick-up because it looked too trendy to be eating pizza in there. The hostess opened my pizza box and went over my order and asked if it was to my liking. It looked good!

Priced at $13.50 I had the "Margherita DOC" and the pizzas seem to come in one size here. It is more of a personal size pizza, but not super tiny. I was happy with it and couldn't finish the last 2 pieces. The pizza has crushed tomatoes, fresh buffalo mozzarella, basil, parmigiano reggiano and extra virgin olive oil. The crust was light and crispy, while the center of the pizza was softer. I had trouble picking up the pizza and eating it so I used a fork and knife which I don't mind. The crushed tomato sauce tasted sweet. I loved the amount of fresh mozzarella that was on it too! I'd like to try some of their other pizzas so I will be back. They also have some salads that sounds good!

Have you ever looked at the every day girl that rings your order up at Starbucks, or the semi-cute chick at the bank and wonder what they would look like topless and shaking their money makers on a stage? Is it just me that has that kind of imagination? Anybody? Well, if you have wondered about that, go to Bandaids to find out. 
I had the opportunity to visit Bandaids and I don't regret that I did. We were allowed in after a quick bag check by a bouncer. Another bouncer was nice enough to get us a few tables front and center stage. The service was good and fairly quick considering the number of people in the bar. Some of the guys are a bit pervy of course...offering to buy drinks or lap dances for you in the slight hope that you might be interested in giving them a private dance. No winners that night! Besides, I was there for some boobage! 
The women of Bandaids aren't perfect, they don't have fake boobs, they don't have perfect bodies. They are every day women that happen to strip for the dough. I wasn't left panting over any hotties unfortunately, but I was impressed at the bravery of some of the women that got up on the stage and worked it. I felt A LOT better about my body after going to Bandaids and seeing some of the girls there. 
Will I go to Bandaids again? Yep! It's a chill place and the girls aren't pushy and I didn't feel at all uncomfortable. It would be nice if they improved the bathrooms for the girls, but that's a small detail. Just hover and you'll be fine! I guess you could say I'm a fan of the dive bar and we were treated very well there. Is it a fancy Scottsdale strip club? Nope. It's your friendly neighborhood strip club to grab a beer, see some boobage, and move along.

Happy Hour Review:

After two years, it's time for an update.  

We really like the Happy Hour at Tommy Bahama's. It's one of our ole standbys, along with Brio Tuscan Grill.  Tommy Bahama's works hard at that laid back, island feel. Downstairs you have a small bar and patio surrounded in a U-shape by the retail store.  The water misters actually do a great job and you wouldn't know its over 100 degrees outside. Really!  Upstairs they have an additional bar, with the main dinning area, along with some private rooms

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
As I mentioned there's a relaxed feel here.  Or, maybe it's their delicious and yummy Mojitos. The crowd is a mixture of all ages.  We had a few teenagers behind us, along with a few out of town'ers.  But it's really hard to categorize the group, except to say that everyone is usually laughing and having a good time.

MENU:
I've attached the  two sided HH menu(photo) along with the appetizers from the regular menu.  The food is very good. Some regular menu items can be pricey, like the salads that start at $16.00.  But, almost all of the HH food is $6.00. Our favorites are the Sirloin Sliders(photos) and the Fish Tacos, but everything is good.

SERVICE:
We have never had any problems with the service. You have your regular server, but everyone pitches in, and I don't mean when you put your credit card down.  Water glasses are refilled on a timely basis.  Inquiries are made about your food and if you are ready for the next item. Nice.

FOOD:
Their Small Plates menu has: Ahi Tuna Poke for $6.00; Fish Tacos for $6.00; Prime Burger Slider for $6.00; Edamane Hummus for $5.00; Crispy Plantains for $5.00; yummy Macadamia Goats Cheese for $5.00; also yummy Jerk Chicken Lolloipops for $5.00 and Candied Spiced Nuts for $5.00.  All delicious.

As for drinks, the Cocktails are $6.00 and include: Mai Tai, Mojito, Sangria, Margarita, and something called a Crazy Cuban and Spiced Hurricane. So you won't go thirsty here.

PRICES:
Our most recent bill came to $43.00 including taxes but not gratuities. But, it's usually in the $31.00 to $37.00 ranges with two drinks. This time we shared a salad and there was no upcharge for a second plate.

Enjoy!

I've been to this Szechuan restaurant on numerous occasions. Their chef is from Szechuan, and their extensive menu encompasses both authentic and Americanized dishes.  The sizable square-shaped interior includes good lighting, booths, lazy Susans, and traditional Chinese artifacts. 

The flavors of their Szechuan specialties are far more compelling than the Americanized items. These dishes often include meat, innards, or fish served in red chili pepper and a pool of tongue-numbing hot oil. The propensities of these dishes can be so intense that I often counteract with an order of light tasting vegetable or non-spicy items to lift the taste buds.

For appetizer, I recommend the Beef Tendon in Spicy Sauce ($6.95). The strips of shaved tendon came with firm textures seasoned by hot oil. The same tongue numbing effect can be felt with an order of Fuqi Feipian ($6.95), another chilled dish prepared with beef shank, heart, and tripe. 

For main entrees, my favorite is the Mao Xue Wang ($15.95), a dish stacked with red chili, hot oil, pork blood, intestines, luncheon meat, tripe, and bean sprouts. The Water Boil Fish ($10.95) can be a good choice too due to the thick cuts of fish filets and light tasting ingredients that work in contrast to the heavier spicy oil. Their Ma Po Tofu ($7.95) was fresh, spicy, and addictive too.

Dishes that I like to order to accompany the numbing flavors are the Spicy Cabbage stir-fry ($6.95) and Tea Smoked Duck ($12.95). The sweetness of the cabbage tends to outweigh the peppers in it. The duck's tea smoked flavors had the same effect, but the meat can also appear leaner and boney than expected. I was disappointed in the Xiao Long Bao ($???) due to its thicker skins and ground pork that needed more seasoning. The much anticipated juicy effect was nonexistent. 

The dishes that I don't recommend are the Cumin Lamb ($13.95) and Water Boiled Pork Kidney ($9.95). The composition of the lamb stir-fry with cumin, chili, and sesame was spot on, but the meat was cut too small for me to fully enjoy it. The Water Boiled Pork Kidney ($9.95) also fell into this category for the thinly shaved kidney that tends to lose its ways and chewy texture.

I had mix results with the Americanized dishes. In particular, both the Walnut Shrimp ($12.95) and Orange Chicken ($8.95) failed to stand out. The flavor on the deep-fried chicken with orange slices and sweet and sour sauce fell flat. I'm not sure why they use sweet and sour sauce, and a hint of spiciness would have made it more dynamic. Additionally, the House Foo Young ($10.95) that came with eggs and a mix of seafood and meat was delicious, but the thick savory gravy made it too salty in the end.

Lastly, the Dan Dan Noodle ($5.95) was not made wit the right sauce. The Spicy Wonton ($5.95) was too skimpy and the rice plates such as Shrimp Fried Rice ($7.95) and House Fried Rice ($7.95) were pretty ordinary without the wok tossed airy texture.

Service can be wildly inconsistent depending on the individual server that I was assigned to. Overall, the Szechuan items were tasty and enough to bring me back for more. They also have a lunch special menu but prospective diners should consider their water boiled dishes, meat items, cold plates, and stir-fried vegetables in order to get a decent fare. 2.5 stars. I hope to visit their Chandler location to see if they are any better.

I am a former employee writing this review anonymously to not be targeted at by the Studio Movie Grill. First, the PROS: Front of the house mgmt works really hard and knows how to really manage the place and keep customers happy; the only thing is the bathrooms. Always filthy. Note to mgmt - Make someone clean them at least every 2 hours. Its disgusting and disrespectful to the paying customers.  
   Next: CONS: Kitchen Management is the worst I have ever seen...ever. Employees are mentally abused on a daily basis and consistently yelled at through the whole work period. We worked really hard with getting food orders out on time with no breaks during the whole work period. The "F" word is thrown around by every single person in the kitchen hundreds of times everyday. When you're running back and forth by the door you can hear it. It is a very hostile work environment and many labor laws are being broken here. 
Also when I was running the food I saw a big fat COCKROACH; and I don't mean the ones you see in your home. I've never actually seen them in food, but have seen a few during my 6 mo employment, skitter across the floor. On the bright side, I haven't seen any in the theaters that I've delivered food to. I quit working here because it was disgusting. There is no sanitation in play in the kitchen. 15-20 kitchen workers and only 4-5 wear gloves. THAT'S RIGHT, WHEN YOU ORDER FOOD GUESS WHO HAS THEIR HANDS ALL OVER IT. Cross-contamination exists here. Food Poisoning is extremely high. The cooks grab raw chicken, burgers, chicken tenders, nachos, fries, cheese, and all of the fixings all with their bare hands that are NEVER washed during the whole time they are there. Ever felt sick after you ate? This is probably why. The Health Department needs called and this business needs to be reported to the Better Business Bureau. This place needs new kitchen management that knows what sanitation is.
  Also, the dish machine is broke so everything is half washed. You're lucky if the dish comes out clean. 35% of the dishes in this place is dirty. Hate to be the bearer of bad news but I'm very customer oriented and no establishment should  EVER put their customers at risk.

On my last night in Vegas, I figured I'd hit the strip for some tried and true authentic Thai cuisine at none other than the famous Lotus of Siam. Located in a dilapidated old strip mall north of the main strip, you'd easily miss this place if you sneezed but make no mistake, this place is the real deal folks! At check in, we were told it would be a grueling 45 minute wait. We were then invited to the bar to pass the time.  Needless to say, we enjoyed a shot or two at the bar and made some new friends in some cool gals.  Before we knew it, our table was ready! Way less than 45 minutes I might add.

Our server was kind courteous and very helpful. She took our orders and within moments, our tasty dishes were basking on our table.

Sea bass drunken noodles - if you like chow fun, you will enjoy every bite of this phenomenal dish! Order it medium spicy and top it with the buttery sea bass and you'll be good to go! Satisfaction guaranteed!

Crispy duck - served with a coconut panang curry sauce, I was blown away by the incredible texture and zesty tang of the panang curry, awesomely delicious!

Garlic prawns - jumbo prawns served nice and crispy with the most enticing aroma I've experienced in years. It will make you drool at first whiff and the explosive garlicky flavor will keep you pining for another decadent bite!

Overall, awesome service, impeccable food and good times = A+++ from this guy 

Happy Eats!

I know. I'm updating this about 2-3 weeks after I first got there.  It went from a 3 to 1 purely because I got kicked out for NO apparent reason ... and here's why.

I was standing by the bar next to my boyfriend and I had rested my head on his shoulder area.  I was hugging him too - it was literally the stance of most couples when girls just want to rest their head on their guys. Literally 30 seconds after I did that, we got a tap on our shoulder saying that we had to go. WTF? Not wanting to cause a scene, we followed this bouncer to the door and he asked for my driver's license - so I gave it to him.  He then took my ID, wrote down my entire information, then gave that piece of paper to the bouncers at the entrance so that I couldn't back in ... since there's only one entry way into the club. 

First of all, can I just ask why I was kicked out?  I was perfectly fine - and the bouncer must've known since he asked ME for my ID, looked ME in the eye, gave ME BACK my own ID and watched me walk off perfectly fine. Now, I'm not going to lie and say that I was sober, but I was DEFINITELY not drunk to the point where it's obvious that I need to be kicked out. 

Secondly, if you bouncers are going to be strict, don't be looking around the bar for people to kick out. Because guess what?  My friend YACKED in the MIDDLE of the dance floor. Did he get kicked out? No. And I was kicked out for resting my head on my boyfriend's shoulder?  I wasn't stumbling, I wasn't all over the place. and I wasn't even near yacking or looking like I needed to. 

This club is ridiculous. 
I had SUCH high expectations and I've given this club a second chance that it COMPLETELY ruined - on my birthday weekend too. 

The only good part? The promoter was nice and got us girls in fast.  But after that - downhill. I will avoid this club at ALL costs.  And I suggest you guys do the same -  it's NOT worth it. At all. It's to the point where Marquee seems better. I mean it does have re-entry and an outdoor pool area.

Alice Cooper'stown is directly across the street from the US Airways Center (home to the Phoenix Suns.)  When I first visited the restaurant, the Suns were putting their finishing moves on the Utah Jazz (84-87), and I suppose it was due to the game that business that evening was slow.  However, for me, it didn't matter.  Besides paying respect to Mr. Cooper, an episode of "Man vs Food" wherein Adam Richman and Alice--the shock-rocking legend himself--attack 22"-long "Big Unit" hotdogs was motivation enough: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C86akA3G6rg.

The "Big Unit"--smothered in "Nightmare" Chili, bacon, cheese sauce, sauerkraut, jalapeos, diced tomatoes and onions, sweet relish, and shredded cheddar--is jaw-dropping!  In fact, upon delievery, fire alarms--shrilling throughout the restaurant--direct full attention to this behemoth as it snakes its way toward its next victim: me.  Respectfully named after the now-retired, 6'10" Arizona Diamondback, Randy "The Big Unit" Johnson, this dog headlines.  At $19.99, it seems a bit steep, but I couldn't eat more than a third.  Along with the fries, it easily feeds two or three.  Divided, the cost is more than reasonable.

The "Elaine Benes" Big Salad, the "Johnny 'Beef' Depp", the "Al McCoy" ["The Voice of the Suns" since 1972] Crispy Chicken Salad, the "John O'Hurley" ["Seinfeld's" J. Peterman] Buffalo Chicken Wrap: the menu items definitely hail celebrity.  But why not?  The fare--along this guitar-lined, autograph-infused, rock-n-roll museum--is meant to be fun.  And it is.  Even though, on this evening, the locals were instead supporting their beloved Suns, I had a great time with my friends.  Cooper'stown is worth a try.

I will say that it's an interesting touch that the servers and bartenders should adopt the Cooper-esque eye make-up--it's cool--but our server wasn't enthused: his bother-me-not attitude and poor service had me questioning his allegiance.  I mean, you work at Cooper'stown!  I know that between two servers and four tables, feeling as though you're in the weeds at times is natural, but couldn't you at least "feign" appreciation and interest?  The manager, however, checked-in on us, refilled our drinks, and asked about our visit.  I think he's quite aware.


Note to Mr. Cooper:  

When I was a kid, Alice Cooper album covers completely unnerved--yet intrigued--me.  I was ten, and I remember visiting our neighbors--hard rockers to the core--who had many of your LP's resting against their metal-plated, knob-heavy component stereo system in their living room.  I would walk around their house pretending I was cool and ignoring--or at least attempting to ignore--your nightmare: I couldn't look you in the eye.  At Cooper'stown, however, upon the slightest chance that you might drop in, I'd kept an eye out...just in case!  I'm not afraid anymore...I don't think.   =]   Nevertheless, for your music, your vision, and your endeavors, I'm a fan.  And I thank you.

I came across this place on yelp and wanted to check it out. We used to have some Hostess outlets in the NW part of town (since closed) that I liked and was hoping to find something similar to that in this place. I found much more than I expected! Walking in I was greeted by a friendly cashier who asked if I had been in before. When I told her I hadn't, she went over the different sections and said to ask if I had any questions. They mostly have Entenmann's, Oroweat, Thomas, Grandma Sycamore's and Sara Lee goods, but they also have other stuff like Bear Creek soup and Boboli pizza crusts. I got a loaf of Sun Maid cinnamon raisin bread for just $1.75 and Texas Toast for the same price. Bagels were $1.99 and I picked out some pizza crusts, english muffins and other pastries. The prices here are drastically lower compared to buying these items at the grocery store. Not even Walmart has a "rollback" like this! 

When I got to the register I was given a stamp card. You get a punch for every dollar you spend. Once the card is full you can get a free item by the brand listed on the card. For every $9 spent you also get to pick something free (changes everyday) from the premium section near the front door. I also received a $1 coupon to bring back towards my total purchase for a future visit and the cashier told me I can combine them! The $1 coupons can only be used during the month on them so make sure to pay attention to that. You get a $1 off coupon for every $8 you spend.The cashier said what is sold here isn't leftover stale stuff from the grocery stores like most people think. She says Bimbo is the largest bread supplier and the stuff sold here is leftovers, but fresh leftovers that grocery stores, etc. had no shelf room for. Nothing I purchased was past a "sell by" date and was soft and fresh. This bakery outlet isn't anywhere near where I live, but I work in the area once a week and will make a point to stop and load up on delicious savings.

We are usually big fans of the foodie flavors that come out of Fox Concepts, but felt this one fell a little short for us.

True Food Kitchen is the brain-child of Dr. Andrew Weil and Sam Fox. Their two-fold mission is that every dish served must not only be delicious but must also promote the diner's well-being. Our palates were somewhat uninspired by the offerings

True Foods is also showcasing proper proportions and the benefits of an anti-inflammatory food pyramid diet of Dr Weil. The only problem is the menu prices need to go on a diet too.  Everything is tasty, but a tad pricey

Our introduction might have also been tempered by the amateurish hostess station, which seemed more interested in having a conversation with a girlfriend friend who stopped by, rather then sitting the customers.  We watched in amusement until our turn came. LOL  

Our server was a bit spacey too.  She was MIA for long stretches of time during our meal and was only bailed out by the other servers.

We tried the Spaghetti Squash (photo) with a "protein" of Chicken Sausage and the Teriyaki (photo) with a "protein" of chicken with brown rice. BTW, "protein" is True Kitchen's favorite add on noun.  

As for our meal, we found the squash was overwhelmed by it's spaghetti sauce, which was mildly spicy which we liked.  Though we really enjoyed the chicken sausage "protein".  As for the the Teriyaki it was somewhat bland and overwhelmed by the brown rice.  Hard to believe.  We did enjoy the Pomegranate Limeaide (photo) and the Honey Ice Teas.

Expect to pay around $30 per person, including one non alcoholic drink.  Our return factor is less than twenty percent.  Sorry.

SITEREP:
If you've been following along in the newspapers, Fox Restaurant Concepts made national headlines in February 2012, when PF Chang's acquired a 51 percent stake in True Foods after providing a initial $10 million in start up costs back in 2009.  http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2009/08/10/daily51.html
http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/morning_call/2012/02/pf-changs-buying-majority-stake-in.html

They are showcasing a cookbook from Dr. Weil and chef Michael Stebner which includes more than 125 original recipes.  On the menu you will find Spring Salad with Aged Provolone, Curried Cauliflower Soup, Corn-Ricotta Ravioli, Spicy Shrimp and Asian Noodles, Bison Umami Burgers, Chocolate Icebox Tart, and Pomegranate Martini and much more. 

They are hoping for a 50-restaurant rollout of the concept, over the next several years. The average 5,000 square feet True Foods space highlights the use of reclaimed wood and environmentally friendly materials, costing about $2.5 million and $3 million in each location.

***Like the Jean Philippe Patisserie in Aria, this high-end patisserie features a wide variety of beautiful pastries and cakes; unfortunately, also like that location in Aria, the service is slow here***

I've been to the Jean Philippe Patisserie in Aria a few times and I've definitely had a lot of good things there.  I've had a few average things there too, which feel even worse than they probably are given the high prices.  Service tends to be slow there as well and it stems from a lack of an organized setup and an inefficient use of the staff.

This Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Bellagio is the original Vegas location and it feels very similar.  Like the Aria location, they feature a wide variety of beautiful individual cakes and pastries.  There are also lunch options, crepes and many packaged goods for gifts and such.  I like the setup at this bakery more though.  It is located far from the casino while the Aria location is right in the casino.

I was only able to try the pain au chocolat, but it was good.  The pastry was flaky, crispy and buttery while the chocolate center was smooth and good.  There were many other nice looking items including a very appetizing looking brioche muffin-type pastry that might just rival the citrus pistachio brioche at Bouchon Bakery in Yountville.

Prices were high, but that is to be expected given that this bakery is located in Vegas and that it features very nicely presented pastries and desserts.

Like the Aria location, the service is very slow here.  Part of the slow service is caused by the long lines that this popular spot attracts.  Also, there seems to be a lot of indecisive customers, which is understandable given the wide variety of options you have here.  But the service does feel inefficient.  There seems to be a lot of staff, but the ordering and pickup process is not that smooth.  There were not enough registers open so even though they were taking orders quickly, the cashiers could not process the orders quick enough so the line really started to build.

Jean Philippe Patisserie is a great spot for breakfast pastries and their individual cakes also look good.  It might be one of the best shops in this part of The Strip for a sweet treat.  Unfortunately, the service (while pleasant) is very slow.  If that does not bother you or if you can come here during non-peak times, this Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Bellagio is worth a visit.

Bellagio offers complimentary valet and self parking.

I recently stayed here for a bachelor party. The hotel lobby was decked out with sick flat screen columns that looked like wall paper, but changed throughout the day. The check-in counters used iPads (with a stylus?!?), though it seemed like a fairly frivolous addition. 

Service at this relatively new hotel was extremely rough. We had a block of rooms reserved together before we arrived, however at check-in that information was lost and people were checked into rooms all over the place. The staff worked hard to get us rooms in the same tower at least and ended up comping us each for one night and giving us half off the second night (a few of us were stuck room-less for 3 hours). In addition to the check-in mishap there was a "cleaning" problem in one of the rooms. I won't get into the details, but it needed immediate attention, which unfortunately had to be requested multiple times. Also on Sunday morning I ordered room service that never arrived, when I called to check on it they suggested I go to the buffet instead.

My suite had a great view of the Bellagio fountain. Decor was attractive and it felt spacious enough for one. The bachelor got a massive bungalow (he was majorly upgraded due to our many service issues). It had a private entrance to the hot new club: Marquee as well as 3 floors, views of the club, and an outdoor hot tub. Unfortunately the lack of sound insulation meant he couldn't sleep until the music stopped (after 5am). Also the fancy stereo system wasn't working on the main floor so we couldn't pipe in any music. Furnishings in the bungalow (like the couch) seemed designed more for ease of cleaning than style.

While it's a cool looking hotel for now, I suspect the heavy use of technology means it won't look or feel modern for all that long unless they have a big budget for frequent upgrades. In my mind... Encore remains the Vegas champ.

A welcome addition to the ramen scene on the east side of town.  Located in an inconspicuous strip mall at the corner of Tropicana and Eastern, this is a true neighborhood ramen joint where one is always greeted enthusiastically at the door and local Japanese residents can always be spotted as regulars.  The decor is minimalist but modern and service is prompt and non-overbearing.  

Appetizers that stand out are the karaage (Japanese fried chicken) and the gyoza (pork/chicken pot stickers).  The chicken is served fresh out of the fryer with a nice crispy exterior and juicy interior with a hint of ginger accentuated with a squeeze of fresh lemon whereas the gyoza have a nice char and the dough skin and filling are light enough to leave room for the main course.  

After consuming 15+ bowls of ramen on multiple lunch break visits from work, the key words describing the soups here are consistency and balance.  Whereas I've had a few instances at Ramen Sora and Monta where the soups were either too salty or too bitter (black garlic oil was literally blackened garlic),  the broths here all have a creamy rich depth of flavor and are not overly cloying in the mouth so the resistance to reaching for additional spoonfuls of broth once the noodles are finished is quite low.  Noodles come in thick and thin varieties with decent texture although lacking any true inherent flavor only found at the top joints.  

The standout broth for me is one of the relative newcomers on the menu: the kogashi (or burnt miso) ramen.  I've waxed poetic before on the Mallard reaction in chemistry  applied to food in a previous review(nerd alert!) but here again is yet another example of the magical powers of applying heat to rearrange amino acids and simple sugars to create a new unique flavor.  By charring miso paste, not only is there an intense aroma given off by the broth upon arriving at your table, but the flavor profile retains the savory note of the fermented soybeans we all know and love in miso but also has additional complex notes with an almost caramelized sweetness and a hint of bitterness that is pleasing on the tongue.  The crispy fried onions topping the noodles further enhance the umami tsunami.   I wish I could comment on the tan-tan men (spicy Szechuan style broth), but alas my first experience was on a full stomach from a previous meal so I must defer one to read other fellow yelper's raves on this other unique offering.

For the most part, the choices here are safe and reliably consistent, much like dating the girl next door, but if you're in the mood for something a little more adventuresome and unpredictable, the krazy kogashi ramen or the spicy and fiery tan tan men are worthy "fuku-mi-mi" one night stands (had to do it,  the name of the joint is just begging for a little humorous acknowledgment!)  

P.S.  Don't forget to partake in their generous punch-card system where one is entitled to a free order of gyoza or karaage with every fourth bowl of ramen purchased!

I attempted when they were in Henderson, but was a day late and a cup of shave ice short. They were apparently moving over to a spot in Chinatown (now open!) and I would have to wait a couple more weeks. While on a taco trek UYE last week I was told that SnowFlake Shavery would be added as one of our stops and was thrilled! This isn't ice cream and it isn't a sno-cone. I know there is a lot of confusion to what shave ice is and I am learning myself, but you wont find any artificial syrups here! If you haven't had it before, it is something you need to experience first hand. The appearance, texture and taste is something special. SnowFlake Shavery uses fresh and all natural ingredients. Flavors range from chocolate, vanilla, cantaloupe, mango, coconut, green tea, black sesame and depending on the season you might be lucky enough to try the banana! I missed out, but heard it was fantastic! 

Sizes: Regular ($3.49) Large ($4.75) Monster ($6.49)

Step 1 - Choose your flavor and size
Step 2 - Choose your toppings priced 50 cents each
Step 3 - Choose sauce priced at 25 cents each (first sauce is free) 

I ordered the "Ex-Straw-Binary" (regular) and it had strawberry snow, strawberries, strawberry sauce and I had them add chocolate sprinkles and extra strawberry condensed milk. The strawberry condensed milk is SO good! The shave ice is very light. The portions are big and even though the regular looks like something you wont be able to finish, give it a try because it wasn't filling at all to me. It was just refreshing and yummy. I will be back to try other flavors!

The employees are very friendly and willing to answer any questions you might have. If you aren't sure about a flavor just ask and they will give you a sample. Don't forget to ask for a rewards card because when you buy 10 you get one free!

Spoon is easily one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. For fine dining, I put them in the top five.
Been here four or five times now just to make sure I was not dreaming. But for sure this is a solid four stars and edging on five. A few subtle enhancements could tip the scale to 5.
Dcor is nice and trendy with several seating areas including a great bar.  Service includes John the top sommelier in the area, usually two hostesses, well-mannered servers and great bartenders. Service is prompt and a drink order results in libations within 5 minutes along with a choice of waters. There is a very ample selection of cocktails and wines by the bottle or glass.
I should mention there is a prompt and courteous valet service as another notch up the service pyramid.
Next the wonderful bread basket with warm selections of biscuits, awesome cornbread and ciabatta or some other artesian bread with sugar or honey butter to complement. We usually need a second basket as a testament.
The short menu is a design to keep choices interesting but not drone on, the ingredients fresh, the food delicious and it changes often enough to keep regulars coming back.
Seafood is my favorite here in appetizer and entre, but the soups and salads are fresh and outstanding as well. A very well enjoyed appetizer choice from the other night we had the 'bacon and eggs' appetizer which was seared pork belly, 5 minute egg (just right) sauted spinach, and hollandaise. Also we had the crispy duck confit which was a fabulous set of ingredients of crispy duck, 3 grain salad, Indian spices, goat cheese, cucumber yogurt, and toasted almonds. Almost sounds like decadence and just about was.
Around the tale we had the shellfish pappardelle; Alaskan black cod; cassoulet which interestingly was comprised of roasted pork, chicken sausage, duck confit, braised cannellini + cranberry beans, herbed bread crumbs, and farm egg. This was 'dryer' version of cassoulet a French peasants, style stew.
We have tried many other appetizers and entrees on our other visits and they all were as wonderful as these I mention here. All had the same complexity of ingredients, preparations, with flavors all overwhelmingly pleasing to the senses.

Coco Donuts is locally owned and opened recently. After seeing the pictures on yelp, I just had to try one of their cronuts! Walking in there was a nice sweet smell in the air and the inside was clean and colorful. I saw there were cronuts left and asked the woman behind the counter to go over the flavors with me, which she did and explained the prices. Hubby and I chose to get a 1/2 dozen donuts and a cronut to try.

I chose the "Raspberry Cronut" priced at $3 and wasn't crazy about it. The icing was just too overly sweet and the raspberry filling reminded me of Welch's jelly. I could only eat a couple of bites because it was just too sweet. The cronut was also tough and not flaky like I'd imagined. If this is what Dominique Ansel's taste like, I'm not missing out. Next time I will try one without icing and see how it is.

-Raspberry Filled.... Same Welch's style jelly and the glaze was just too sweet. 

-Apple Filled... This one was good. There was a good amount of tasty apples in the center and the donut was very soft.

-Sugar Twist... Very soft and good, but nothing spectacular. 

-Cinnamon Roll... Soft, a bit too sweet and again, nothing spectacular.

-Chocolate Long John... This was very soft and delicious. It was also a decent size. 

-Chocolate Iced Bavarian Cream... The bavarian cream had no flavor, but the rest of the donut was good.

The donuts here are very, very soft. They are also a good size for the price, but this is just an average donut shop to me. Nothing really stood out and even though I love sweets, too many of the donuts here were just too sweet for me. The woman behind the counter was nice enough to give is 4 donut holes to try and again, they were melt in your mouth soft, but the glazed were just too sweet while the cinnamon sugar believe it or not was perfect. They have a punch card so if you are here buying donuts by the dozen the card will benefit you. The regular donuts are currently 95 cents each and the coffee prices $1.75 - $2.50 so I plan on stopping back by and trying out the coffee with a different cronut or donut to see what it's like.

Half Dozen $5.50 - $5.75
One Dozen $9.50 - $9.95

Specialty and Fancy donuts range from $1 - $3.50 each.

Monday - Friday: 5 am - 6:30 pm or sell out 
Saturday - Sunday: 5 am - 3 pm or sell out

FABU-nothing-LOUS-than-five-stars!!

Palazzo, you were so good to us during our Vegas trip! Let me count the ways...

1. The large suite was SAH-WEET!! 3 LCD TVs in the room (including the bathroom), one for each one of the Three Miss Yelps. Swank and modern decor. Velvet chaise lounges and sofas in our sunken living room for us to chill and use as fun props in our impromptu photo shoots. The beds were so comfortable, and the blackout curtains could have made us sleep until 3pm if some of us didn't have such precise internal clocks.

2. The service was top notch! Our request for extra goodies for our room were accommodated quickly, and a follow up phone call from the concierge was made to make sure we received everything we needed. One of the concierge, Angie, was so sweet and helpful. If it hadn't been for her recommendations, we would have missed out on dining at Okada in Wynn and Koi in Planet Hollywood. The doormen were also all super friendly!

3. The hotel is gorgeous! The newest resort/casino on The Strip, it offers the finest amenities, shopping and dining. Nestled between the fabulous Wynn and Venetian resorts, we were able to walk to each one easily (cabbed it to all other casinos, which is usually $10/way). The pool area is beautiful, and if you rent a cabana, it comes complete with a flat screen TV.

4. The room rates were a steal! Our 2 queen beds suite was a mere $209/night. Although wi-fi was not free, it was only $10/day. 

5. On our final day in Vegas, we decided that I would try my luck at the tables. We scoped out the blackjack tables, and as we were walking by, one of the dealers, Damion, asked us how we were doing. I got a good vibe from him and the rest of the players so I joined in. $15 minimum to play, I dropped down $40. Damion and the other guys at the table were super friendly and fun to play with. They even let me stay in the game when I only had $10 left. The player to my right gave me $15 of his chips to keep me alive when I lost my last chips. I walked away from the table 15 minutes later with $90!! You can call me Lady Luck. ;)

Consider me a big fan!  

I was perusing potential spots for dinner last night and then I saw My T's picture of the 5 spice game hen and it..waS...ON.  They bake the game hen and THEN deep fry it!  Why don't more spots bake and then fry things?  It tasted even better than it looked.  The side of tomato rice was really good too.  I almost never rave about eating bird but I will be having this again.   

Another favorite was their shaken beef salad.  I was shaken up after my first freakin bite!  The beef was so juicy and so tender and only $12!  The hot grilled beef mixed with the cool lettuce, onion, tomato and spices made for one of the best salads I've had in recent memory. 

The Mekong River noodle soup was just ok.  It looked great and was filled with lots of fixings like fish balls, pork tenderloin, quail eggs, veggies and shrimp but the pork based broth fell short for me.  I saw a lot of customers going for the bone marrow soup and holy shit what a spectacle that was.  HUGE bones!  Me would feel like caveman and raise bone like champion (grunt!).  Check out the pics of it.  

But man oh man so much other stuff I want to try like the slow braised pork belly entree, crispy bird nest noodle and more shaken beef!  They're located in the old Cravin Cajun spot so it's great for groups.  I hope they get their liquor license soon.

After two consecutive incidents with the same server, Debra, I'm forced to write this review. First happened February 14th, 2014. My girlfriend and I came in for dinner. She took our order wrong, food came out wrong, runner went back into kitchen, couple minutes later food came out right so no big deal. Debra however pretended it didn't happen and didn't even apologize. Again, no big deal. Left her a 18% tip and totaled it to 90$ on my card. On my credit card statement I was charged 100$. 

I Talked to the manager, Alennry, on the phone and said he was busy at the moment so he gave me his email to explain the situation. Emailed him twice over the course of two weeks and no reply. I ended up letting it go, convincing myself it could have been an honest mistake. 

April 12th, 2014 rolls around and I decide their happy hour sounds good, which it is. Don't get me wrong it's a great happy hour. Again were sat in Debra's section. Funny right? This time I total my card to 33$ and I was charged 38$, same thing with my girlfriends card. Now I'm at the point where I'm very upset because it's clear Debra is forging credit card tips. Being a server in the Vegas industry myself I know this is the biggest no no. 

Now I go in and talk to Nectaly himself about the situation. He seemed very sorry and genuine about the situation and said he would get the money refunded. At the end of the day, the extra 5$ charged on not only one but both our cards is not a big deal, it's the principle that counts. Nectaly emails me saying he's getting statements from his merchant. Takes about a week but he finally gets them. Then he doesn't email back for a couple days and then I finally get an email saying he's in New York and will refund them as soon as he's back. I say that's awesome and couple days go by and no email or refund. I email again and now there's absolutely no response for a week.

And now I'm writing this review. It's upsetting because like I said, their happy hour and food quality is awesome. But this is not the way you do business. The first time could have been an honest mistake but twice from the same server is no coincidence. You don't steal from customers, that's not the way you do business. Please take warning. The managers and owners seem to be more than okay with doing shady business.

**MAIL ORDER REVIEW**
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OGQ_6nIn4QQL2U6t0XeHtA?select=blLLKuO1g4MrD4tQCgzh0g

Craig R. wrote a review for Popped when he visited their shop in Las Vegas.  He said it was awesome and worth trying.  He peaked my interest with the fact they have dill pickle flavored popcorn.  This I had to try so I went online to their website and ordered a nice variety.  Prices are cheap until you add fedex shipping charge to it.  

Their popcorn tastes extremely fresh, has a nice texture, zero unpopped kernels, and there's hardly any remnants of the popcorn hulls.  All the ingredients used tasted very high quality.  Popcornopolis should find out what type of corn they use and change because they have way too many hulls in their popcorn.  

I've ranked flavors below from most to least favorite.

505: Caramel corn with white chocolate, fresh green hatch chilies, and powdered red hatch chilies.  Holy mother of God is this amazing.  Craig says it's the "best damn popcorn I've ever had" and I have to agree.  Hatch chilies are my favorite chili and unlike other products I've had the hatch is the main star of the show.  It stands out front and center slapping you in the face and sending you to New Mexico for it's chili goodness. It's spicy enough to cause you to cough and choke while eating it and the sweetness of the caramel and chocolate turn the choking into groaning while you slam more into your word hole.

Dilly Pickle:  Best pickle tasting snack item I've had.  It's sweet popcorn with a super sour, vinegar biting, fresh dill flavor to it.  Tastes just like a sour dill pickle.  Loved it!

Smore's:  Caramel corn with mini marshmallows, graham crackers, and chocolate.  My wife and I really liked this combo of flavors but I wish they'd mix it a bit better.  Most of the graham crackers were at the bottom of the bag and there wasn't enough marshmallow... but....  the overall taste was fantastic.

Get Toasted: Tastes like cinnamon and sugar.  If you like these two ingredients then this flavor is for you.  Yum!

Bling Bling Cookies & Cream: Caramel corn rolled in crushed Oreo cookies and dusted with metallic edible sparkly glittery things(bling bling).  As soon as you open the bag you get the aroma of Oreo cookies.  It tasted just like it's namesake sans the cream.  I really didn't' taste the cream part, but....  still a great popcorn if you're a fan of oreo cookies.

Chicago:  It's a mix of caramel, white cheddar, and nacho.  It's sweet, salty, and cheesy.  It works.

Salt & Vinegar:  Kettle corn tasting popcorn tossed with vinegar.  Oddly enough it works unlike the buffalo wing flavor below.  Not as acidic as the dill pickle flavor, more mellowed out.  Not my favorite Salt & Vinegar snack but tasty none the less.

Buffalo Hot:  This flavor was disappointing.  It had a nice kick of heat but barely any wing flavor.  I wish it had the flavor intensity of their dill pickle one.  Needs more buffalo wing taste.  Also the base flavor of the popcorn is kettle corn which doesn't really work with buffalo wing.

Spread, spread, spread is what makes the newly renovated buffet at Caesar's phenomenal. The new layout and revamp of menu will give the Bellagio and Wynn a run for their money. 

Coming in for breakfast, I was impressed. It left me wondering what dinner was bound to feature. Near the entrance, in the morning, the cold bar is stocked with fresh juices. The beautiful display of colors draws the eyes in and my hand started grabbing. Orange, grapefruit, watermelon, and carrot were available for the taking. Fresh fruit and parfaits contain tropical fruits such as starfruit sit above.

The next line had many forms of bacon including turkey and three different kinds of pork. Eggs benedict come in a traditional form, but the one using the potato cake was way better. The chiliquiles were soggy since they were constructed ahead of time. The small portions in skillets give the perfect serving of most dishes. The little frying basket of maple tots were drool inducing. Plated servings of regular and red velvet pancakes are placed out as guest take them. Beautiful, the red velvet flavor was not present. Although this concept of single serving goodness is not new, Bacchanal does it much better. 

Moving on, there was an egg station which would prepare your eggs any way you wish or just pick from the rolls, pizzas, and quiche on display. A whole line was dedicated to bagels, lox, and spread. Some are made in advance, but you could easily make your own. 

Continue on for the thinly sliced prosciutto and other meats, then comes the cheese selection. At the very end there is an Asian section which includes the dim sum. I was not impressed with this offering. My friend and I paced ourselves because desserts are essential no matter what time it is.

Between two of us; we got a blackberry cobbler, four kinds of ice cream, a berries and nutella crepe, and waffles. I used the infused honey near the bread station instead of maple syrup for my waffle and it was magic. 

For $16.99, you will not find a better deal for breakfast.

My Friday night plans fell through and wound up with my son and his boyfriend and we were starving I asked them if they were up to trying out a new Thai place that we haven't been to yet and they answered back quickly with a yes, let's go!

We got their around 8:45pm and the place was sort of emptied out, but it was perfect for us. I also noticed that I got a free Thai Tea for checking in on Yelp! How sweet is that!  

For starters we ordered the chicken satay, the chicken was delish and full of flavors, the peanut sauce was amazing! My son and I at the same time said we could bath in the peanut sauce it was that good! Apple doesn't fall far from the tree I guess. But that sauce is amazing! Love it! 

One ordered the Massaman Curry, mild and that dish looked so very yummy! He said it was delish too! The other one ordered the Chicken Pad Thai mild without bean sprouts and he loved it too!

I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai as well, but had my Thai hot baby, bring on the heat I say! I enjoyed the Pad Thai, the noodles where perfectly cooked, the chicken was very tender and so tasty! The pad Thai did come with tofu, which next time I know to have it without tofu but since it was already on my plate I went ahead and tried it out, and well it was flavorless and blubbery, like you would imagine a whale to be. It's not my thing, but I tried :) .

My son and I have a favorite little Thai place on the other end of Mesa that we love, but I think Thai Spices just might have knocked them out, can't wait to come back and try the pineapple fried rice of course with chicken!

Another 4 star Ramen spot in Vegas.  I'm really enjoying hitting up the various one's on every trip out to sin city.  This time it was meeting up with great friends from high school in Japan for a much needed girls weekend.  Being that we grew up eating ramen picking it for lunch was a easy choice.

Ramen Sora serves up all broth type ramen froms shio, shoyu, tonkotsu and miso.  They state they serve Sapporo Ramen which is miso based.  It is def one of my fave broth flavor that I grew up eating in Japan including the instant kind by sapporo ichiban!  Obviously the toppings at each ramen house varies but typically a bowl of miso ramen is served with chashu, bean sprouts and corn.  

Deluxe Sora Ramen ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#hCJU9RRGp3DKxDTlDB3YSA  You get to pick the broth choice and I decided to go with miso.  The bowl came out nice and hot.  Broth had a great flavor not salty as some can be.  Good ajitama. The chashu was nice and fatty and soft.  It was sliced on the thinner side but it was very good http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#D-VllyZqgYKzpRSSEh7PBw The noodles were the yellow curly chijiri type.  It was cooked perfectly and not mushy.  They offer 2 bowl sizes (regular and large) and additional toppings are offered for a reasonable price.  

Gyoza ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#eaaQo6H7y5Ob4t3j7ydoeg Fried up with a decent char.  The filling had a good flavor.  They have a premixed sauce so no guessing on the soy sauce to vinegar ratio. 

Ramen Sora is located a few blocks away from Monta.  Driving by this place in the evening you might think they are closed due to the tinting they have on the window but rest assured they are open.  The single building is of decent size and a good number of tables however I felt they could have used the somewhat open space with another communal table.  Depending on the time you get there you will def have a wait as we did albeit a short one.  

Eyes ~ Nice bowl of noodle goodness!
Nose ~ Smells so good!.
Ear ~ Happy chatting and eating.
Mouth ~ So very very good!.
Tummy ~ Satisfied!

I don't just hand out 5 star reviews. ESPECIALLY after only one visit. But I have absolutely not a single doubt that I will be back for this incredibly fresh seafood. AND I DON'T EVEN EAT OYSTERS! We came on a Saturday night, and luckily since there was a fight going on, there was NO WAIT!! (note taken: come on fight night) After reading a ton of reviews, I pretty much had my heart set on the Signature Pan Roast with shrimp crab and lobster at about level 8 spice level, long before my arrival. But I also got a cup of New England style chowder first. Other than being along the coast in Oregon or Washington, best I have had!  This clam chowder was thick, with HUGE amounts of clams. Exactly what I expected. 
My bf got the shrimp scampi, and the stepson went with the Bouillabaisse. It literally had one of everything in there! Like a big fish stew! Even the sourdough rolls they brought to the table were great. And watching the chef cook your food, as well as others is the best part! 
My boyfriend is semi allergic to shrimp, and he still wanted to return for one of those beautiful lobsters.
The spice in the pan roast was perfection, however next time I will get one scoop of rice instead of two. It soaks up the spice which I am sure most people usually love. The chunks of crab and lobster were full of flavor! It will be hard for me to order anything else. 
The service was great, and in a casino you can't always expect that. Overall a wonderful place for good seafood and fresh shellfish!

Met up with some fellow Yelpers at Short Leash Dog Sit Stay UYE, now earlier in the year I was introduced to Short Leash in the same manor, but it was in an alley off Central and Camelback at a food truck and they were an instant hit with me! Since then Short Leash has expanded/ added an actually restaurant, and we were there to check them out! 

I found my group pretty quick and then after I settled in my seat, and got my date situated (my 8 month old grandson)  I looked around the joint, I like it, it has a nice opened feel, maybe a little hipster, but I dig it!

I knew before I got there what I wanted, I wanted The Bear, I had a taste of it awhile back and had been craving it since then! 

Let's stop for a minute and discuss the Bear, where did they come up with this idea? Who said let's make a hot dog, and then place it on naan bread, then top it with smoked Gouda, Bacon, Bbq Sauce, Peanut Butter and some Cracker Jacks for kicks! Whose idea was this, and who 2nd it?????  I know if I came to the table with this for my kids, they would think I was smoking something! Short Leash Dogs are geniuses!  

The Bear is amazing!!! My dog was a brat, and it was smothered in bbq sauce, peanut butter, Gouda cheese, BACON and yes even the cracker jacks and blanketed in Naan bread!! This is the most amazing hot dog I have had so far!  Just mind blowing how the combinations of everything blend together. Also my bear came with a nice little green salad, eating the salad made me feel less guilty about eating the dog haha got some healthy stuff with it! 

For the little guy I ordered the corn dog bites, though he only ate 1  1/2, he dug the corn meal crust of the dog, devoured that up quickly.  He has 6 teeth and knows how to use them. He wasn't a fan of the jalapeno cheese stuffed dog, but I can safely say, that's pretty banging dog!  Might have to try it out as a Moki, yes I think that's what I'll try next!  

Another great UYE, and Short Leash, you guys have a fan in me!! I will be back!

This may be the only time I ever give a 5 star review and never return back b/c I definitely feel like a creeper in the Teazer.

A few friends wanted to check out the cafe after indulging in a massive food coma across the street.  As we walked in I'm not gonna lie - i was nervous - it felt like going to my first nudie club when I was prepping for SATs.  

Don't come off like an OCG-IT....Don' come off like an OCG-IT .that's Old Creepy Guy....In training.   I like to think i have another 5-10 years before the IT is removed.  

We were greeted by Courtney who was really sweet.  She sat down with us and told us all about the menu.  I really cant remember much about the boba drink I had but for 5 bucks it was great!   We played 6-7 games of Uno with Courtney's house rules and then played a version of Big 2 or VC.

I definitely then pulled the creeper move but i SWEAR it was on accident......she asked our names and it went around the table and for some reason Charlie came out of my mouth.   If you don't know me, Charlie is no where close to what my name is.  Nowhere in the ballpark......At this time my friends were telling a story so i didnt want to butt in and after a few minutes i wasnt gonna say -- oh heyyyyy..... by the way.... my name isn't Charlie....so i ultimately passed the point of no return.  No notes needed - creepy move executed......check

Eventually later, my name came up and did the explaining.  Anyhow time flew by - things felt more natural - the girls are sweet and easy to talk to.  Take care of these girls and tip well.  They go above and beyond exemplary service of any food server.  

I'm not sure if i'll be back after pulling an OCG.   Side note - As I was walking out I saw 2 master Yelpers probably the Co-Dukes not counting the owner... decked out in suits - that was pretty pimp.

#500

My wife and I celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary here.  What a dining experience it was!  

The complimentary gold MGM limo picking us up right in front of our place was sweet.  You must do this!  We were met by a beautiful hostess straight out of a James Bond film as we rolled up to the Mansion.  An amazing place to check out.  I guess this is what playing $25k a hand in blackjack gets you.  

We had all intentions of getting the 16 course dinner but realized there was no chance whatsoever of my very petite sized wife having even a hail mary's shot at finishing.  She might've reached course 10 at best.  

No problem!  Let's just fill up on champagne and do four courses.

There are so many extremely detailed reviews for this restaurant.  Read all of them!  I'm only going to do notes and observations:

- Is it possible to be too fancy?  This comes close. I love fine dining as much as the next fat Asian with glasses but the word "stuffy" came to mind.  Maybe my suit was too tight.  

- The man, the myth, the legend was there.  Right before our appetizers (ah-hem! Une Entree) came out I heard a "Bon Soir!" from behind me and there he was in the flesh!  Joel Robuchon!!  He shook our hands.  Joel stops by the restaurant 4 times a year according to the staff and he said we were lucky to see him.  I should've asked Mr. Robuchon to sign one of the rolls from the ridiculously amazing bread cart.

- The lobster salad with fruit was orgasmic.  

- Whoever invented foie gras should go down in history as one of the greatest people ever.

- Veal cheek kind of tasted like if a chicken thigh had sex with filet mignon.  I savored every little bite.  I believe the neighboring table shot me a look after I said this out loud to my wife.  Whatever.  More champagne please!!

- They served us an extra dessert to celebrate the occasion.  It was the white and yellow meringue fruit pie cake I took a picture of.  I forgot what they said it was called. Blame it on the ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah-alcohol.  Tremendous stuff!  We ordered 2 more dessert dishes and THEN the dessert cart came out.  Wow!!

3 hours later we were stuffed and ready for the limo to take us back.  A fantastic gourmet experience I would recommend to anyone.

This review is for the deli.

I had been wanting to try this place and was surprised to find out they have a deli and restaurant! From the front of the building, the deli is on the right and the restaurant is on the left. 

I ordered a "Sicilian Sandwich" priced at $6.99 and a "Meatball Parmigiana Sandwich" also priced at $6.99 for hubby since he was lost looking at the bread loaves they had for sale. The girl behind the counter gave me a receipt and said I needed to pay the girl at the front. Heading towards the front I noticed some yummy looking desserts and decided to get a slice of "Pecan Cheesecake" priced at $4 per slice. Hubby picked out a focaccia loaf that cost $1.90 and we were set. 

The Sicilian sandwich was really good! It didn't look like there was much to it, but it packed a lot of flavor. Half way through our sandwiches, hubby and I decided to switch and the meatball sandwich was cheesy, delicious and something I would order again, but I liked mine better. I had the pecan cheesecake later for dessert and it was much better than other places around put out. The focaccia loaf however wasn't fresh. To be fair, we did come in just after 8 pm, so the bread was maybe baked earlier in the day, but they should mark the baked goods down after a certain point. I enjoyed the sandwiches and dessert enough to return! 

Inside was clean and the employees were very friendly and helpful.

If you have a choice DON'T DINE HERE. Toby Keith I HATE YOUR BAR & GRILL.

 I would rather stay home and get a third degree burn in my mouth from a Lean Pocket than ever dine at this type of place, but sometimes it's not about what I want. 

It was my sister's birthday and her and my mother love country music and Toby Keith in particular. My mom had mentioned she wanted to take my sister here so I took the bull by the horns and made it happen. Big mistake.

We all know there are outstanding restaurants on the strip that are worth every over priced dime that you spend. Not this one. This falls into the other category. The Over Priced Food That Just Sucks Themed Restaurants.

Still, I can get past the price just to make people I love happy, but not this time. In a nutshell.

The food wasn't terrible. My sister ordered meatloaf potato skins with gravy for our appetizer. This was creative, yet under seasoned, but still I was thinking this would be cool to recreate at home for one of my dinner parties. Maybe with sweet potatoes.

Next we each had a sandwich which does not include fries and my sister added fries. My sandwich was a grilled BBQ chicken sandwich which wasn't terrible at all. I could only eat half and brought the rest of the chicken home to my dog. One Coke, two well drinks and $95 LATER!!!!!!! Fuck me.

Like I said, I can get over the price, but the waitress broke my number one rule. IT WAS A BIRTHDAY AND SHE DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR MY SISTER. Not that we expected a lap dance or Toby Keith to serenade us in tight jeans, but something! I made it a point to tip the busser and have her tell the waitress about the birthday (let me say those girls are the ones hustling in this joint) . The waitresses merely take your order and then hand you your check at the end. Other than that they do shit. It's all about the bussers. Our busser  was on point and I know she told the waitress. Well Sue or Suzie our blonde waitress brought me the bill and I mentioned it to her and she just looked at my sister and said, "Happy Birthday". I wanted to rip her Lee Press-On nails right off. Well, I tipped her accordingly and then tipped the busser again.

If mediocre, overpriced, under seasoned bar food and country music is your thang than you will be in hog heaven with the trailer park beauties servin' it up. If you are looking to spoil someone you love on their birthday with a simple scoop of vanilla ice-cream and a feckin' candle than do not come here.

Any Asian owned business that has the word "Spa" in its name will raise suspicions of being a "rub and tug."  Being a member of law enforcement,  I have to be extra vigilant about the businesses I patronize.  Imperial Health Spa was recommended to me by several female friends and after some research on Yelp, I felt it was an legitimate spa and made an appointment.

The spa layout is pretty simple unless you're gender-confused.  It is located in a two story building and divided into three areas; the top floor is the co-ed area and the bottom is segregated by gender. 

Before I go any further, I must warn you...  DO NOT go if you are not comfortable with same-sex full frontal nudity.  There will be naked people there and they will walk as if they are strolling in the park.  If you have a hang up about being naked, don't go, because if I catch you checking out my junk, I'm gonna kick your butt--and two naked dudes fighting in a spa is the last thing ANYONE wants to see.

When you arrive, you will be checked in by the receptionist, it costs $15 for locals and $20 for non-locals to use the facilities (Mani, Pedi, Facial, Massages, Exfols services are also available at extra cost).  You will be given a set of shorts,  hospital scrubs, 2 towels and a key.  The key is for your locker, the rest, hopefully, are self explanatory.

When you walk into the changing area, there will be mini-lockers, those mini-lockers are for your shoes.  You are now faced with a couple of decisions, put your shoes in the mini shoe locker or your key locker; and use the slippers in the mini shoe locker or go bare foot.  You're an adult, figure it out.

There will be lockers and the number on your key will correspond to the locker.  Get out of your street clothes,  wrap a towel around yourself, hit the showers.  In the segregated area, there will be:

Stand-up Showers
Sit-down Asian Showers
Hot Tub
Cool Tub
Salt Steam Room
Herbal Steam Room
Dry Sauna
Salt Hot Sauna

PLEASE SHOWER AFTER YOU VISIT EACH AREA... shower/hot tub/shower/steam room/shower/cave/shower/sauna... and any combination thereof, just shower after each "area."

The upstairs is the co-ed area, it consists of a general lounge area with big comfy lazy-boy chairs where you can watch TV and a mini-restaurant that serves basic Korean/Asian food as well as some boba/smoothie drinks.  Upstairs specialty rooms are as follows:

Salt Brick Room - A hot room with salt bricks
Red Clay Ball Sauna - Think kitty litter, for humans, without the poo.
Jade Sauna - Not sure what this room was for and didn't bother to read the sign, just remember it being hot
Red Clay Room- It's a red clay igloo... also hot.
Cold Room - Basically a walk in freezer
Mini Gym - I don't exercise, so I avoided this room.  I think there were treadmills and stationary bikes.

I got the combo package of "Pure Heaven" which consisted of a Body Scrub, Swedish Massage and Fresh Grated Cucumber Mask (70 minutes, $130).  The scrub was great, left my skin baby soft.  The cucumber mask made me hungry.  The massage was okay.  

I took one star away for the fact that I didn't have a choice of getting a female therapist... becuase I got the body scrub, the entire package had to be done by a middle-age Korean man.  I was told that if I wanted a female therapist, I should have separated out the massage and body rub; wherein the exfoliation would be done by a man and the massage portion, a woman.  Fine, next time I know.

I did enjoy the Tofu soup at the restaurant ($9.00)... which was prepared by a woman.

All in all, it's a pretty good experience, relaxing after having to deal with my crazy mother.

Some of my friends laughed and others scoffed at the fact that I had booked accommodations at the Hooters Casino Hotel for my Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon weekend in Las Vegas.

It wasn't as bad as everybody told me it would be, and considering I booked many months in advance and found Expedia rates ranging from $45 to $55 a night for a room in the Tower building I wouldn't hesitate to go back.  For the race the "off the Strip" location was perfect as it was a comfortable fifteen minute walk to the start / finish area on race day.

My room was okay since I only spent time there to sleep and to yelp.  With the exception of parts of the carpet the room was fairly clean too.  I wore white socks in the room and each night my white socks turned either light gray or charcoal colored depending on how much walking I did in the room.

Here were some of the cool things about my room:

*The queen size bed was firm and comfortable (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=iHWbOO5Jzfh31dVthmiB6Q).
*Standard sized television (no flat screen) had crisp cable broadcasting.
*Comfortable desk had a brand new issue of the latest Hooters magazine (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=96qyqd-PoYisLKTjPUswuA).
*There is a digital room safe just in case you decide to go out for a 13 or 26 mile run (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=BZMBwl3J5Y6vylsT0c-hBA).
*Clean bathroom (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=dPRiakqkf2jm4_1Tyw-Iww).
*Basic amenities (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=yqsvK9WYxf_OtSIjZUBXIA).
*Free bottled water (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=S4pY5Ebf2pSWPyP59WTvmQ).  Runners love water!!
*Two fake palms in the room look great without the flying insects (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=YBp_3-oEiKi-ayVqcVDe_w).
*Amusing privacy door signs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=toTBsd8WeZhsSMAEALOiOQ).

Of course there's always bad things that makes it a 3 star review:

*The comforter was lumpy.
*No free internet.  No problem as I brought a wireless card this time.
*The deadbolt kept slamming into the door jamb.  I had to whip out my Leatherman and do a repair job for them.  The deadbolt works perfectly now.  You're welcome!!
*Noisy pipes and the water pressure in the water closet was horrible.
*Toilet tissue holder was too short and the spool would come loose and fall on the floor every time the tissue was in use.
*Thin walls.  I heard every foul-mouthed conversation my neighbors had, but I heard every intimate one too!
*Horrible, lazy housekeeping staff!  I did a better job cleaning up after myself!
*Incompetent and slow check-in process.  The lady kept mispronouncing my last name.  How do you fuck up my last name?  It's three letters and the second and third letters are the same vowel.  Dummy!

I didn't take advantage of the slot playing amenity that came with the room.  The casino downstairs is very small.  Like I said, if I could find these rates again I would return.  If not, don't bother!

Recently featured as a ROTD, my BF and I came by for dinner. Prices are all over the place, with a few good deals but a lot need to come down a buck or two to be reasonable. We were one of two tables, yet our order took 25 minutes to come out and the entre was unacceptable in quality. 

FRIED MUSHROOMS: $7 for 8 button mushrooms. Lovely crispy breading.
FRIED PICKLES: $5, overbattered and greasy but sweet-and-spicy dipping sauce was awesome.
FOOTLONG CHILI DOG: $8, shriveled hotdog looked like jerky it was so overcooked and the chili looked and tasted like it came from a can. One of the worst things I've ever been served in a restaurant. Intended to split it with my guy, but neither of us would eat anything beyond that first bite.

Our waitress noticed our uneaten meal and we expressed our dissatisfaction. They offered to box it up but not to remake it. She removed the hotdog from our table, showed it to the female manager, Kelly, (who left the scene and never returned), and brought us our check along with a comment card, stating that "the system" did not "allow" her to give any "discounts" but that we were welcome to leave feedback. The hotdog was still on the bill despite being sent back because it was inedible.

We asked to speak to management (who should have taken the initiative to come speak to us), and the male owner, Robert, came out and asked what the problem was.  We again reiterated that the hotdog was inedible, both looking and tasting like it was made yesterday. 

His response? A defensive, "Well that's just like, your opinion." Literally. His exact response, no irony whatsoever. He then went on to rant about how he's "not afraid of bad Yelps" and his food is made to order and if we're dissatisfied that's our prerogative and it must be our first visit because he "doesn't give discounts."
In the end, unable to reach a civil agreement, we were given the ultimatum to pay in full for a half-uneaten meal or he "could comp the whole thing, whatever."  I assume that was intended as a bluff but I simply left. 

I like their concept, but management is completely unprofessional and has no idea how to run a business or a restaurant- which was evident when they were featured on the show Hungry Investors.  Clearly they were unable to benefit from the publicity and learn from the experience- the same issues that held them back then are still here now.

EDIT: As of the time of this review, there are nearly 70 "filtered" reviews at the bottom of this page. If that's not a red flag, I don't know what is. Most of them are single-star experiences with terrible service and/or food as well.

Ashlee Simpson celebrated her birthday at Wet Republic last weekend: Hot.

I celebrated my birthday at Wet Republic this weekend: HOTTER!

You know you're having a truly fabulous time if you're taking shots with complete strangers and then find yourself having a chicken fight with random people in the pool. 

There's eye candy galore for all; everyone there is beautiful. We even spotted a Brad Pitt and Angelina look-a-like couple. They could have really been there, but we were so sloshed, who knows. 

We arrived early - at 11am to be exact. Doors opened five minutes later, and since we were pretty much the only people there, all of us girls got in free. Surprisingly, there was no line, since you typically have to get there at least half an hour before doors open to get in line. We were also lucky to get first pick of chairs (green lounge chairs inside the pool are the only free seats), so we got the best ones near the pool. We got the two $100 chairs (the drink/food minimum) on one end of the pool that were situated in their own little cove with two green chairs right next to them. 

The $100 minimum is easily met, especially if you get pitchers of their frozen drinks (the frozen watermelon mojitos are awesome), which start at $75. Plus the food is really yummy, and are huge portions meant for sharing. We got a bucket of tasty chicken tenders and waffle fries, and the Philly cheese steak quesadillas (only so-so). 

Although the pool was pretty dead to start, it got crazy later on. Now, if you can party all day here, in the sun, drinking non-stop, and still be able to go out clubbing until 4am, I take my hat off to you; you are a true rockstar.

Largest Night Race in the World.
Shooting for titles is fine, we are runners, it is what we (they) do.
But you have to do it right. This event was so poorly organized that it was borderline dangerous, and overall extremely stressful and frustrating. Looking back on it I don't even understand how they let that cluster-fuck happen (there is really no other word to describe the conditions we had to face pre-, during and post-race).

44,000 people is a lot. And that can be fine if the crowd is handled properly. But try to channel them PLUS their families through three doors at the back of a hotel and you'll see what happen: chaos. Of the most horrible kind. I shudder at what might have happened in the event of a fire alarm of any other kind of emergency.
I was lucky enough to not have to deal with gear check - that looked like apocalypse.

Even the running part of the race was a mess. Corrals were extremely difficult to get to, crowded with non-runners and poorly delimited. I crossed the starting line a good 35 minutes after the first participants, and I ran my first mile at a 15:45 pace. Needless to say - I usually WALK much faster. I was so frustrated that I wanted to punch someone but it got slightly better, and I just kept on running - trying to enjoy the lights and sounds of the Strip. I must have run a total of 15 miles slaloming between people, and I am perfectly aware that it is how it goes in larger races but this was just downright ridiculous.

There is more, though:
1. Water stations were located on both sides of the course. People were converging from every side, tripping over each other.

2. There was no Gatorade whatsoever, contrary to what was announced on the website.

3. I usually carry my water with me, but decided not to do it this time. Must have been my lucky day because I consumed the water provided by the organizers and didn't get sick despite the fact that it WAS PUMPED FROM HYDRANTS INTO GARBAGE CANS. A lot of people got violently ill during the race...

4. ...on the street because porter potties were so scarce. I remember seeing them at two different locations. That's it.

5. Marathoners started 90 minutes before half-marathoners, but there was really no point since the two races converged on the Strip at the busiest point. That slowed down everyone; forget about breaking personal records under such circumstances. Especially with parking cones scattered everywhere to try to separate the two different races.

6. Post-race snacks were out of reach. I was carried away by the flow, and miraculously stopped by the banana stand. All of them were unripe, and impossible to eat. What a waste.

7. Medical assistance was ineffective, and came late in several cases. The MC had to yell out repeatedly for someone to come over and help a man who was having a heart attack. I am not even joking.

8. The pictures  of runners taken along the course are worthless. I cannot even find myself on most of them. And the cheapest one goes for $29.95. Yeah right.

9. It took me exactly 3 hours between the time I crossed the finish line and the moment I was able to sit down for dinner. No offense to Mandalay Bay - but it became synonymous with hell on earth for many of us.

So please, please, please. Read, listen and think. Don't open the race to 60,000 people next year or it will get really ugly.
No need to say - I am done with the RNR series whose only concern is to make money out of runners ($135 registration fee, empty goodie bag and a $40 supplement to pick up your packet on race-day....really?!?) at all costs.

What a shame.

I was shopping at the nearby Centennial Center as I do pretty much every week and even though there are many food options within the shopping center, I was bored with those options at the moment. I decided to pull up places on the good ole yelp app and came across Above the Crust. It's on Ann Rd across from Painted Desert, so not too far behind Centennial Center. Deciding to give Above the Crust a try, I stopped in and placed a order. They have so many good deals going on each day! It being Tuesday meant that I could get a large pizza free with the purchase of a large pizza and toppings an additional $2 each. I went with a large cheese and a large pepperoni and added a couple "Garlic Rolls" priced at .95 cents each. I really liked the taste of the pizza and the sauce on it. The rolls had a nice garlic and butter flavor on the outside, the inside was a bit too much bread that was tough. I prefer a more traditional knot personally. When I walked in, I was greeted with a friendly hello from all the employees and I was given a menu and a flyer that shows the current daily specials offered. 

Sunday and Monday ($32.95) - Large pizza, bucket of wings, 4 garlic rolls and a 2 liter of soda.

Two for Tuesday - Buy one large pizza get one free.

Wing Wednesday (24.95) - Sampler bucket of wings, choose up to 4 flavors.

Friday Special ($29.95) - Large pizza and a bucket of fingers.

Stromboli Saturday ($17.95) - Large pizza and any stromboli. 

Daily special ($5.95) - 2 slices and a drink.

They offer delivery and also offer sandwiches, salads and calzones.

FINALLY!! I've been waiting for this location to open f-o-r-e-v-e-r! With the location on the Strip closing, it couldn't have come at a better time. Walking in I saw the usual lines for adobada, asada, etc. You have to pay attention to the signs so you know what line to get in. I only ever get adobada, so I usually go straight to that line and hubby usually goes straight to the asada line. Sometimes I do feel like an asada taco, so hubby just gets mine when he gets his and that saves time and my food from getting cold. This last visit the line wasn't bad at all and the place had a good amount of heads in it. I only waited maybe 5 minutes in the adobada line and hubby waited less than that in his line. The wait time will no doubt change depending on the day at time, but the wait is worth it. I had an "Adobada Taco" ($2) and an "Adobada Mulas" ($4, I requested mine to me made on flour tortillas) and they were both so good! I asked for them both with pineapple and the dude hooked me up with a fair amount. The adobada has such great flavor and is very addicting! The taste just keeps you wanting more. They do have seating inside, but I noticed they are working on the other part of the building, so maybe they will add more seating there?? That will be good for those who like to eat inside, but a lot of people, myself included, just eat at our cars. They offer a variety of meats including asada, adobada, lengua, sesos, buche, tripa, suadero and chorizo. You can get any of these meats in a taco, mulas, tostadas, vampiro, sopes and even over fries. This place is absolutely legit when it comes to tacos and I'll be a regular for sure!

I've been looking for a great Persian restaurant since my last dining experience at Doostan. It was quite a drive for me, but I enjoyed the food so much that I came for dinner twice within the same week. The vibe seemed subdued from the lack of patrons, but the quiet atmosphere made it a cozy place to bring dates and small gatherings. Along with the front patio, there was a full bar situated next to the entrance. Past the partition was the dining area with scores of smaller tables surrounding the long vertical one for large gatherings. The blue, purple, and beige dcor nicely complemented the warm lighting and a number of paintings on the walls.

Their complementary pita bread was thick, fluffy, and pillow-like with a hint of smoke. It was a great starter with Halim Bademjan ($7.50) assembled with fried eggplant, tomatoes, garlic, onions, and other seasoning. The consistency was not as thick or flavorful as the one at Flame International. However, the pronounced garlic flavor was a hit when added to the soft smoky pita. My only wish was for the eggplant flavor to stand out more. It was good, but not mind blowing.

The Lamb Shish-Kebab ($21) was put together with chunks of marinated lamb, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, and at my request, cherry rice ($4.50).  The lamb was tender and moist with full-on flavor. The cuts were chewy, but I could taste the saffron as the mix of cherry was delicious in the basmati. For the price, I wished there could be more cherries in the basmati, but the lamb made quite an impression. 

The Chicken Shish-Kebab ($17) arrived with charbroiled marinated chicken breast, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and choice of dill and lima beans rice ($4.5). The chicken came with tremendous wow factor: super moist, juicy, and flavorful. The dill and lima beans basmati was not overpowering, and instead the taste was complementary to the chicken.

The Cornish Hen Kebob ($17) was equally outstanding. This dish came with an entire Cornish Hen served bone-in, and each piece was evenly cooked to perfection to render a meaty juicy sensation. The cherry rice was again a hit. I will go the distance whenever I can find cherry rice. 

Lastly, the Salmon Kebob ($18.50) came with marinated salmon and basmati rice mixed with fresh garlic, dill weed, parsley & cilantro. The salmon was tender but slightly overdone. The rice had a smooth refined flaovr as a secondary to provide depth. I wasn't particularly blown away by this dish, especially since the previous dishes were really outstanding. Among them, I'm still partial to the Lamb and Chicken Kebob. 

Service was inconsistent, as my dining companion drank from a dirty glass without knowing it until the end of his meal. My second visit fared much better. The server was knowledgeable, friendly, highly attentive, and invited us to return. Here's one of the few legitimate places to grab Persian cuisine in this area. I'd be very interested in coming back to try the Persian Ice Cream, Baklava, and Zoombia & Bamieh.

Mon Ami Gabi is the kind of French Bistro friend we all wish we knew back in our own hometowns.

For me, the number one draw was the View ... not the view of the Paris Hotel & Casino, but the view from the outdoor patio of the Bellagio Fountains across the Las Vegas Strip. There are two dining options at Mon Ami Gabi: Indoor or Patio. Indoors is going to be a "finer dining experience" and much shorter wait. Even though we had reservations, it took about 20 minutes to get seated on the patio. The wait was worth it. We lucked into a table right in the middle directly across from the Bellagio. If you come after 6:00 p.m. the fountain show is every 15 minutes, so, plan accordingly.

Our meal was $195 for my wife and me. It was a bit over-priced, but still a rewarding couple steaks, drinks, and sides. And did I mention the view? Olivia had the 22 oz Bone-In Rib Eye Steak with Bearnaise Sauce ($40) while I got the Filet Mignon Merlot with Butter & Wine Reduction Sauce ($35). Both steaks were 4-star cuts of meat with the filet tender and the rib eye juicy. They came with the house Frites and we added sides of Asparagus (3-stars) and Mushrooms (3-stars).

I stuck with the house Pinot Noir (Mon Ami Gabi 09 $8 each) before/during dinner while she went with 3 rounds of the Le Fleur cocktail ($13)  which was super sweet thanks to St. Germain and Bacardi Limon. For dessert, we split a Creme Brulee ($8 - 4 stars) and had a Latte. We were in no rush to leave thanks to the Fountains of Bellagio view and relaxed pace of our meal.

Our server was especially bland. I'm sure his job must suck serving tourists all day, every day, but a little enthusiasm or acting like you cared about our experience would of been nice. Oh, who cares. Just bring us another round of drinks.

Anyhoo, come for the view. Enjoy some steaks. Dream of being in Paris. You're on vacation at Mon Ami Gabi.

We walked in here without a reservation on a Saturday night and ate at the bar.  I am super late on the Honey Salt bandwagon.  So much so that I might as well be writing a review on this cool new show called "Breaking Bad".  I mean, the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich has similar qualities to meth...so I've heard anyways.  

The creamless corn soup intrigued my wife the most and she loved it.  The charred kernels and arugula oil was kind of a shock at initial taste but it grew on her quickly and she already plans to order it the next time we're there.  

I got "My Wife's Favorite Salad" consisting of duck confit, arugula, frise, pine nuts, roasted bing cherries, and a farm fresh poached egg.  This was terrific and I only wished there was even more duck but I am sure everyone feels that way.  I thought the mix of flavors were really good.  

We split the Colorado Lamb porterhouse for the entree.  It came with bacon sofrito, pea tendrils, roasted fingerling potatoes, and balsamic reduction.  I'd never had lamb prepared this way and thought it was quite creative.  The lamb was a little more done than I wanted it to be but it was still juicy.  Like all good porterhouses, I found myself gnawing on the bone with my bare hands at the end.  

Our super friendly (and fellow Red Sox fan from Andover, MA) bartender lightly twisted our arm into getting "The Brookie" for dessert which the menu describes "chocolate chip cookie meets chocolate fudge brownie, with vanilla bean ice cream".  You should definitely try this if you like but are really tired of chocolate lava cake.  I feel so jaded typing that last sentence.  

Overall it was great.  What's not to like about this spot?

One often hears a rendition of the famous adage to enjoy the journey rather than to rush through it, and this is one prime example of such great advice.
We were intrigued by the 1000 plus reviews for Bouchon, so our aim was to dine at this establishment for brunch.  However, i couldn't muster any more energy to walk that extra 10 minutes through the windy Venetian Hotel, so we ended up at Postrio instead.  MUST.EAT. NOW.  lol.  this was an amazing gem with prime real estate seating.  

LUNCH FARE: 

RICOTTA GNOCCHI with Sweet Fennel Sausage Bolognese ($25)
a soft ballad of flavors dance together with each bite.  so soft with potatoes oozing out.  each bite was outstanding and just the perfect portion.

TRIO OF HOUSE MADE SAUSAGES ($16)
Housemade Mustard, Pickled Vegetables, Grilled Country Bread, Baby Mache.  
yes, appetizer portion, but i knew i had to save room for dessert.  my ideal type of meal is usually 60% protein, 30% veggies, and 10% carbs, and this dish delivers exactly that.  executed so well, each bite was heavenly.  the sausage on the far right had pistachios, so pistachio lovers -- make note.  the fuchsia looking vegetable adjacent to the pistachio sausage is actually pickled watermelon.   it's not the typical watermelon that one would purchase at the local market.  this type of melon had the tight texture & consistency of a daikon or a radish, yet it was a watermelon.  

CHOCOLATE MELTING BEIGNETS were fabulous! ($12)
the chocolate beignets were oozing with warm chocolate filling and dusted with powdered sugar.  one proper spoonful of ice cream  was the perfect complement to the warm beignet.  the vanilla dipping sauce was just an icing to the dish -- it was great, but not necessary, but definitely did not hurt it at all.  for a dessert, everything was "not too sweet" either, which is always perfect in my books. 

for Mimi L,  they carry Banoffee, which is a banana & toffee cream pie ($9).  Other delectable treats include chocolate cream pie ($9), warm apple pie ($9), lemon cheesecake ($10), chocolate souffle ($12), and housemade ice cream or sorbet ($8)

****

SERVICE was impeccable.  Our server, Luigi, was nothing short of accommodating and awesome.  the pseudo "outdoor" seating gave us a great glimpse of St Mark's Square, where performers entertain passerbys.  the festive atmosphere and costume of the performers really enhances the "Venetian" feel.

lastly, love how the manager emails me personally to welcome me back to the restaurant.  i had received a similar email from Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill at MGM Grand.  great personal touch.  definitely worthy of 5 stars =)  Mr. Puck, i'm starting to become a fan of yours.

Sometimes there's no substitute for the real thing. 

Lesters with its iconic bright yellow awning, has been a mainstay in the Outremont neighborhood for years now. My grandma lives just around the corner from this institution and though I often walked by during visits to Montreal, I never found the time to go in for a bite. Why?

Because my grandma and her clan are die-hard Schwartz's folks. 

Yes, the sole incarnation of smoked meat they've come to know has been from the famous deli downtown. Even my mother, who finds little to embrace in Western cuisine, has a hankering for the restaurant's famed brisket every now and then. 

Cut to a recent visit to Montreal with mum, when we were both hit with smoked meat cravings. My mother wanted Schwartz's of course but we were due back at Grandma's for lunch so we were playing hooky and couldn't ask the rest of the clan for directions. Furthermore, I was without my bearings (i.e. smart phone), so I proposed we hit up Lesters instead. "Okay," she muttered begrudgingly. 

There's sidewalk seating during the warm months so deli goers can enjoy the comings and goings of the neighborhood while they nosh. Very European. Inside, there's a different feel. Old-school diner. There's booths, rows of tables and a deli counter where the slicers stand hand-slicing the brisket. Tchotchkes from bygone decades in Quebec fill the walls. 

We're seated quickly inside and place our order with our server, a curt but sassy type with a thick Quebecois accent. Two smoked meat sammies, an order of fries and a ginger ale in a frosty mug to share. Mum does not want to share a sandwich despite the obvious fact that we'll be eating more at Grandma's later. 

Our meal arrives. The fries are not very crispy on the outside but feature very soft, fluffy and sweet innards. They are addictive but they lack crunch. I take a bite out of my sandwich and I already know what the verdict will be. But I wait for mum to deliver her pronouncement. She takes a bite, squirts a little more mustard onto her sandwich and begins pawing at the meat at bit with her fork. If there ever was a time to tell someone to stop playing with their food.....

But then the kvetching starts up. "NO! Not the same", she weighs in. Adding to that, "Soft meat, no flavor. Other place better." And of course, "How come other table get more pickles than us!"

Okay. 

This is her 'I told you so' moment in food form. It's true though. The meat, although velvety soft from the steaming, lacks the beautiful array of spices or much smoke. It may be hand sliced expertly into paper thin slices but it doesn't make up for the blandness or the slimy texture. A extra squirt or two of mustard fails to perk up the DOA meat. There's no oomph here, sad to say. The sandwich reminds me faintly of my experience at Ben's years ago, though even that version had more flavour. I suspect that they use industrial processed briskets which are jacked up with chemicals and preservatives. I don't have a problem with that so long as the flavour remains intact. The whole sandwich is rather underwhelming. We continue on with our fries, gobbling them up. 

So this is not the best smoked meat that Montreal has to offer. It may alright fine for diner fare or what not but skip the brisket. Next time, no shortcuts!

I have had Baguette Cafe bookmarked to try for a while and finally stopped by on my lunch break to try out a sandwich. Baguette Cafe is a bit hard to find the first time. I had trouble locating it since it is nestled with other office buildings, but had the address thanks to yelp and soon found my way. I was impressed with how many tables and chairs there is outside. It was a glorious day out too and many people were eating out there.

When it came time for my order, Olivier, one of the owners was glad to go over the different sandwiches with me. I ordered "The Prosciutto" priced at $6.95 and it came on a baguette. The sandwich had prosciutto, salami, mixed greens, tomato, walnuts, celery and blue cheese spread. The sandwich had a good taste, but the bread was tough to chew and rough on my gums. I have been told by other yelpers that getting the sandwich "panini" style isn't so rough on your jaw/mouth, but wanted to try it how it came on the baguette the first time. I also didn't taste any celery and only tasted one bite of blue cheese and felt the sandwich could have had more meat in it to match the rough texture of the bread, but did I did think what was in-between the bread tasted good.  I also kindly asked him if he would do the honor of choosing a dessert for me to have later. The reason I asked him to chose for me is because I would have went with the same ole thing and I'm sure that would have tasted great, but I wanted to try something different. Sure enough, what Olivier picked out was nothing I would have picked on my own and now after having it, I was left craving more.

Should you want to cater breakfast or lunch for your office, Baguette Cafe can handle that for you. With the right amount of notice they can deliver and set up the food so call and ask for details. 

If you are feeling like an omelet, sandwich, wrap, soup, salad, fresh juice or even a latte, they have that too.

(Impression mainly from soft opening)

Note: You should love the noble piglet! Pork and pork based items dominates ~96% of their non-beverage menu.

There has been a lot of buzz regarding the opening of Hiromaru Fusion Ramen since the Ramen Festival at the Rio last year. And finally they are opened for business! Excited!!!

What I love about this type of ramen restaurants is the fact that their menu is so simple and straightforward. Just four (4) ramen to select from, and whether to upgrade some add-ons to the ramen (extra Chashu, roasted seaweed and even cheese!), or side orders of Gyoza, Chashu Pork Bowl, Karaage, Curry and Hiromaru Buns. None of that 150 menu items from your typical Chinese American Take-Out restaurants, or the 10 page menus at older American diners. Essentially their laser focus attention to making what few items they have on their menu to the highest degree of expertise their kitchen crew can mustered on a daily basis is what I admire. 

So here is what you can order from their 1 page menu:

Carbonara Ramen ($10.95) - the chef's signature fusion ramen inspired by the Italian Carbonara pasta. The soup base consist of Tonkotsu pork broth and milk (expect watery broth and not thick traditional Carbonara pasta sauce). It is topped with still runny egg yolk, bacon, Shio and fresh scallions, resulting in a beautiful presentation of yummy ramenness.  Flat thick noodle is served with this bowl of ramen, I assume to better grip the creamy fusion ramen broth, but eating this without making any unintentional splashes is very difficult. If you can manage that difficult task, mad props to you Ninja!

Shiroi Tonkotsu ($7.95) - according to the Chef and the menu, "the best salted ramen is created with salted sauce and brown garlic oil."  I have not heard or read otherwise, so I shall defer to the ramen expert on this one. This most traditional of the 4 ramen options is served with Tonkotsu pork broth with salted sauce. Chashu pork, hard boiled egg, fresh scallions and Kikurage tops thin ramen noodles to complete this entree. The soup is delicious (at my limit for how salty I like my ramen broth), but I prefer slightly thicker and chewier ramen.

Kuroi Tonkotsu ($8.95) - this is a special salted ramen made with Chef Kawai's master's secret "Ma-Yu" (black garlic oil) recipe.  It is essentially the Shiroi Tonkotsu with the special ma-yu.

Tate-Yama Ramen ($9.95) - easily the tallest ramen you can order from the menu, which is inspired by the largest mountain in Chef Kawai's home prefecture. The double portion of thick ramen (aka Kaedama) and mounds of vegetables (bean sprouts & cabbage), is served with a soy sauce base + salted sauce and baby-backbone fat, Chasu, hard-boiled egg.

The typical ramen-ya side dishes are available for ordering and some. The Hiromaru Buns (steamed buns + Butabara pork belly in original Hiromaru sauce) sounds amazing and tasted as good as it looks! The Japanese mayo with the lettuce was an interesting creamy touch.  Chicken Karaage was fried nicely, but still moist inside and is perfect as is or with a light squeeze of lemon.

No alcohol is served, at least not now, but sodas and teas and bottled water are available to help lower the sodium concentration is your stomach.

The decor is simple and modern, they really did a great job renovating the space vacated by Cafe de Japon. Even the large "private" room off to the side looks nice and inviting, and ready to accommodate patrons.

Fast service, yummy food and attentive staff, so far so good! Ramen portion is average or slightly smaller, I can do 2 bowls for sure, maybe 3 bowls when I am in beast mode. So the 2x ramen noodle option at the time you place your order is recommended if you frequent food eating contests.

5 ramen spoons outta 5.

After living here 10 years I figure I have seen enough to have something to say.

What started as a rural community with a few subdisions and of course the toursist attraction of a street full of casinos & hotels. The Strip.

Then it was NightClubs,StripClubs,MegaRessorts, and World Class Dining & Entertainment.

This place has morphed into a Metropolis with freeways criss-crossing the city and MegaResorts, Supermalls, neighborhood strip malls and neighborhood casinos suburban communities like Summerlin, Del Webb, Lone Mountain, and all the subdiviisions.

Houses were built by the 1000's overnight with imported labor. Population went from 60K to over 300K in less than 5 years.

WHat happend?

Schools are 48th in the country which is BAD.Huge class sizes, very underqualified teachers and lots of non-english speaking.40% high school drop out rate!!

Healthcare is non-existant-UMC the county hospital receycled needles spreading Hepatitis last year.Plus nurse shortages.

Courts, County Commission, Mayor and other Governemnt Offcials are corrupt as they come.-The mayor is a former mob attorney. County officials have been indicted & convicted of many crimes, Judges & lawyers arrested regularly. Its madness

Parks & Recreation is where we actually exceed expectations. Theres lots of parks and stuff to do without having to gamble.Lots of sporting events for the kids.

Jobs-Well pay is relatively low unless you are in a high tip paying job or a stripper or something illegal.
Most jobs on the Strip require a Sherrifs Card which cost you $40-$50 and requires a background check and fingerprinting at the police station.
Some jobs also require a Health Card for food handling etc, this requires you to go to the hospital and get a TB shot and watch a video some people have to get other shots too.
Then there the TAM card-Tobacco & Alcohol Managemnt-waitresses,bartenders,clerks and lots more have to get this card which requires a class & test to complete. Plus it cost you $80-#$00.

Food & Entertainment.-Well everyone knows about the Fancy Chefs and all their Fancy restaurants on the Strip but Las VEgas is filled with culinary delights. Many people relocate here and bring their own cuisine and styles.

There's tons of community events for familys and Vegas knows how to throw a party. The big Holidays are always loaded with tourists  but you kind find many intimate events throughout the year.

Lots of quality librarys and other resources.


Casinos have been allowed to build in residential neighborhoods so now nearly every neighborhood has a casino of some kind which is nice if you like $2.99 breakfast & other thinngs casinos offer.

The bus system has added the Duece to its fleet making ir a little better but its still a little slow. The monorail has been erected but not completed. It seems it would be a better beenfit going to & from the airport to the strip.

Many of the traditional casinos had been imploded & new ones bigger & brighter and more expensive have been built in their place. Condos on the strip have become a reality and even Trump has come to town.

Our XFL Football team came & went. We have lots of sporting events and concerts to attend and at reasonable prices.No real chance of ever getting a PRO sports team..

Las Vegas is hot & sunny 300 days a year and for some a little too hot but we adapt and learn to beat the heat.

We have pools in our backyards all hotels and apartments have them too. Lake Mead & Hoover Dam is just a drive to the water even though its been less than impressive over the years.

It's pricy to live in the city but you have everything you need right in the neighborhood, lots of great finds & deals around, usually plenty of jobs to go around and there's always a little luck.

You can take a vacation just by going down the strip or downtown , theres always something new & exciting. Learning to use the comp system at the casinos makes living in Vegas so much funner.

Prostituion may not be legal but there's plenty of Escorts for you and Marijuana has been decriminalized so the cops don't fuck with you plus the quality has gotten alot better with all the legal supply in California nearby.I love this place all you can eat munchies for under $10 everyday!!

I have been wanting to try Due Forni for a while so I was glad to finally try it. Here they offer pizza, appetizers, salads, mozzarella bar and have a selection of wines.  They have 2 different ovens for 2 different types of pizza. The "Neapolitan" had a crust that is more soft and thick and the "Roman" had a crust that is thin and crispier. 

Since I was here having lunch with a fellow yelper who has been here several times, I asked her suggestions as far as portion size and what was good. She said the pizza was huge and filling so we decided to split a pizza and salad. I can't remember the name of the salad, but it was the special of the day and delicious. The figs were very tasty and I'm usually not a fan of arugula however everything paired well and tasted great. Then came time for the pizza. We ordered the "Quattro Formaggi" priced at $15.99 with the roman crust. This pizza had buffalo mozzarella, parmesan, fontina fontal and ricotta on it which made for one cheesy delight. All the cheeses were perfect together and tasted very good. This pizza usually comes white, but we requested red sauce made with san marzano tomatoes be added and the sauce is boss! The crust however I wasn't a fan of. I found the roman crust very chewy and tough to eat so I would try this pizza with the neapolitan crust next time. Another thing is I was still hungry when the bill came so I wouldn't share again since I could have easily eaten 3 pieces of the pizza and all of the salad *oink oink*. Service was great and I will definitely come back to Due Forni. 

**Happy Hour is from 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm 7 days a week**
 Current HH menu: $5
-Oven Baked Goat Cheese
-Dates Skewer

For our 350th review it is only fitting to write one on the Cirque du Soleil Show "O" at the Bellagio.

The "O" is simply "eau" in French meaning water :)

While I have seen a lot of Cirque shows and this was my second time seeing "O", this was Dave's FIRST EVER Cirque Du Soleil Experience! This was also a first viewing for his parents for "O".

In Vegas "Ka" and "O" are my two favourite shows. What I love about "O" is how unique it is and how artfully the show is choreographed with the use of water, music, story and amazing acrobatics.

The opening of the show always reminds me of something I would catch in a Tim Burton Movie.. the beheaded corpse hanging from the ceiling, the somewhat creepy deathly music and tones. That said the show like most Cirque shows has beautiful colorful costumes and an element of comedy. The two clowns that appear throughout the show are "corny" funny. I find the stage very distinctive in its ability to transform into a stage for them to walk on, swim in, dive into and sail on -the depth of water is amazing.

If you like acrobatics, water, music then "O" is a great show for you to go see. We had front row seats so we did get splashed a bit but that was all part of the experience.

Editors Note (Dave):  This was simply one of the best show experiences I've had in my life.  We were lucky enough to be in the front row but we were off to the side a bit.  The front edge of the stage is curved so when the curtain was down, we missed moments of the show while it was going on on the other side of the stage.

Watching the swimmers come out of the water slowly without even a sign of bubbles was a bit on the surreal side.  Their carefully decorated costumes and face painting definitely gave much to look at even at close detail when they were running in front of us just a couple feet away at times!

The whole show was pretty amazing, however, there was so much going on, I wish I had read the program we bought ($15, and worth it) to get a little bit more of the story since when I'm in such an amazement I tend to zone out focusing on something specific.  It will be moments later when I'll realize something else is happening on the other side of the stage that deserves my attention.  There was even a time where I was staring at something happening in the air and the person performing in the water right in front of us splashed us.  I guess they felt they deserved my attention more?!?

I would definitely go again.    I hope I do, at least.

TIPS:
1. Buy tickets ahead of time or online
2. If you want front row seats get them in the middle section
3. Go to the 7pm showing instead of the 10pm if you are not a night owl! 
4. The first few rows are definitely "wet" seats, so don't go in something that can't get chlorinated water on it, but don't freak out, its not a Sea World show.

Omakase!!
I'm a fan of Chef Nobu and I've been dreaming of dining at one of his restaurant some day. Well tonight was the night

I got a seat at the sushi bar. 
A great way to see the action up front and personal. 

I went with the Omakase (Chef's Choice)
13 cold dishes
3 hot dishes
Desserts

Here's the rundown:
Cold dishes:
Nobu Tako w/ Jalapeo Sauce - a great way to start things off. 

Toro Tartare - Wow, melts in your mouth goodness. 

Toro, Big Eye Tuna, Abalone, Tamago, Scallop w/ Fresh Pickled Ginger - this was the nigiri part of the meal. Every thing was great. Fresh, clean tasting sushi. Yum!!

Amaebi w/ Uni, Egg Custard & Snapper - the shrimp and Uni was ridiculously good. Egg custard was so creamy and tasty. The anapper had a yuzu sauce that was so good (and I don't usually like yuzu)

Xxx salad, Amberjack,  xxxxx - I didn't get the names on the last 3 cold dishes, but they were all good. 

Hot dishes. 
Grilled Diver Sea Scallop w/ Tomato Sauce & Chive Oil - Scallops were perfectly cooked, but that sauce was AMAZING!!

Wagyu Beef w/ Garlic Butter & Brussels Sprouts. OMG!  Melts in your mouth goodness. PERFECT!!

Ramen w/ Crab and Vinaigrette Broth. A nice dish to finish the meal. 

Dessert:
Sudachi Cream, Merengue, Hazelnut and Black Sesame Ice Cream - a Napoleon (sideways). That sudachi (Japanese Citrus) cream was delicious. Hazelnut provided the crunch. A thin chocolate sheet provided the sweetness. That black sesame ice cream is the BEST ice cream I've had in a long long time. It was creamy, not too sweet and the sesame flavor shines through. I highly recommend it. 

Service was SUPERB!
From start to finish, I was pampered. 

For me, one of my dining dreams come true and it lived up to everything I imagined it to be. 

My Rating:
5 Star Plus!! 
Try it for yourself and decide.

Wow. The sandwich game has been lifted. 

I came to Buddha Belly Deli after I saw a few Elites, one in particular (Shirley B.) frequented here about three times over the course of two weeks. That's some bodacious Buddha dedication. You know what though, her dedication was rightly placed. 

Not only is the food here amazing, but the staff is insanely helpful and friendly. With my hunger pains increasing I walked in and zero'd in on the "Schezwan Shrimp Po' Boy"... "yes please!" My lunchtime partner got the "Pho Dip", a very thinly sliced meaty sandwich, with pickled veggies piled high, and accompanied by a hot side of Pho broth. 

To kick-off this food frenzy, we also order smothered-fries. Now these aren't your drunken southern uncle's chili-fries, these are on another level. Crispy, thin french fries covered with a thai chili flavored pulled pork. They call this type of topping "Sloppy Joe", on the menu, but it's more than the all American slop you're most likely used to. It's a game changer in-deed. Simple, but amazing and once this hit the table it was game on! 

I'm pretty sure The Schezwen Shrimp Po' Boy had a dash of Viagra in it because I was getting more and more aroused with each flavor-filled bite. Loaded with fried shrimp, a spicy mayo, pickled jalapeos and a few other pepper options. This amazing concoction of sandwich fair was wedged between two very soft pieces of a french baguette. The shrimp was crispy on the outside, but still juicy and firm on the inside. Seriously I could have eaten two of these at one sitting.
 
Now, at this point my hunger monster was taking over and I noticed that my lunchtime partner still had half of her "Pho Dip" sammie on the plate. I asked her for a taste and before she could even answer I was already mid-bite. Soft bread, a big layer of thin sliced meat, and a perfect Pho broth to dip it in. This was pure magic. I ate almost the whole thing before coming out of my flavor induced black-out and seeing an angry glare staring back at me from across the table.

If you were to witness this gross display of gluttony, it would remind you of Shark Week's "best of" clips... you know where a shark's eyes roll into the back of their head before they viscously attack some poor unsuspecting tasty creature. I couldn't care less, no food shaming here. 

Honestly this isn't just a sandwich shop, but a place where the owners actually take pride in their food on many levels. There it is folks... The secret has been unlocked. Just take pride in your art and maybe something beautiful and tasty will come out of it. 

Whoa. That last line might be the Buddha talking.

What. The. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck?????!!

I was stone-cold sober last night, I SWEAR. I went to see George Wallace, expecting a middle-of-the-road Vegas standup show. Some laffs, some audience participation, whatever. What do you expect for free tickets, ya know?

What I got was about 60 minutes of a cherubic relic in a pimp suit mumbling, slurring and stumbling through a bunch of dusty one-liners 
(sometimes his delivery was so bad, I couldn't understand what he was saying). There were a few jokes in really bad taste, though, about which he was totally unapologetic...so I did laugh at those.

But then, the show got WEIRD AS FUCK!

As one of the other reviewers mentioned, the audience is mostly middle-aged black people. Now, I've seen Madea and Coming to America and all those movies that end with church scenes featuring gospel singers clapping and throwing up their hands and singing "O Happy Day" and shit like that -- I thought it was some bullshit racist Hollywood stereotype.

But I'm here to tell you: at end of his show, on a Wednesday night in Vegas, George Wallace asked all the ministers in the house to stand up -- astonishingly, there were 7 or 8 of them in there that night, so they all got up and passed the mic around, saying their names, where they were from, and what church they preached at:"The First African Episcopalian Tabernacle Church of God in Christ," stuff like that.  WTF!!! 

Now George Wallace cued some 80s gospel music, and handed the mic around again. This one guy down front started belting away in a majestic baritone, somehow knowing all the words without a problem. Was he a plant? Or do all ministers just know these songs, and happen to frequent the George Wallace show (other reviewers here describe this same thing going down)? 

Next, he invited another one of the ministers, this big spiky-haired woman, onstage. He told her if she could sing this next track, and really kill it, he would match all the money people in the audience threw at her. WTF?! He didn't say anything about it going to her church -- I guess she just got to keep the cash.
 
So he cued up another obscure gospel track, and she took the mic -- and started DOMINATING that song!! I thought for sure she must be a plant -- she'd been sitting in a booth with a bunch of much younger guys who had raised their hands earlier when Wallace asked if anyone was from Detroit, but she said she was from Henderson...plus, they didn't react like friends would when she was pulled up onstage. Definitely seemed plant-y.

But if that's the case, then what a scam!!! Because after she belted a verse or two, people in the audience started getting up and throwing cash at her!!! They came from all over the theater -- the back, sides, front -- and even my friend went up and gave her $5, so I know the money wasn't all fake. People were standing up in the aisles, waving their hands in the air like on those creepy megachurch broadcasts, singing along and praising Jesus. Did I mention this was a Wednesday night in Vegas, and most of them were drinking Mai Tais and shit!!!!! WTF!!!

If this lady was really a plant, she has a pretty sweet gig going there -- she probably made about $100 for her "impromptu" performance, which I assume she repeated the following night...and the following night. George Wallace said he would match the money after the show -- he said, "Come see me, and I'll give you $100." Hmmm. 

Now that I think about it...the theater was only about a third full, and as mentioned my friends and I had gotten free tickets, so who knows how many other comps were in there. He's probably not making much money, since he spent a good portion of the show hawking his merch -- he told people over and over to be sure and buy one of his signature "I Be Thinkin'" hats after the show, which were normally $30 but this night only, just for us, he was marking them down to $20. He also pimped his $100 package, which included 2 CDs, 2 DVDs, 2 t-shirts and 2 keychains. 

It came off as kinda swap-meetish, and pretty desperate...so that makes me wonder: is he splitting the take with this planted gospel singer???

Either way, even if she was for real -- that's pretty fucking weird, too! I mean, these people were throwing money at her like it was the Spearmint Rhino!! 

WEIRD show. I would recommend scoring free tix somewhere, then eating mushrooms 30min before it starts.

And if you do -- be sure to let me know if the same lady gets up and sings! She looked like a fat Fantasia Barrino, with short spiky hair and a toothy smile.

I had a slice of pizza from this place at a friends house shortly after they first opened. I couldn't remember if I liked it or not, so I suggested to hubby that we try this place for dinner. The employees inside were very courteous and friendly and the guy who gave me the pizza let me know they offer delivery, which is a plus if you like the pizza. 

Hungry Howie's claims to be "The Home of the Flavored Crust" and offers 8 different types to choose from. The concept here I do like. It sounds like a too good to be true pizza place. Well, it is in my opinion. The 8 types of flavors are butter, asiago cheese, cajun, butter cheese, ranch, sesame, garlic herb and onion. Sounds great right?

I ordered a large "Cheese Pizza" and a large "1/2 Pepperoni and 1/2 Sausage Pizza" as well "Asiago Howie Bread" to go along with the pizza. When I first opened the pizza it looked great. I asked for the cheese pizza to have butter cheese crust. I could see the ring of butter soaked into the pizza box around the crust and it didn't bother me because I did order a pizza with butter on it, but the crust as well the pizza in general had no real flavor. Maybe all the butter cheese flavor soaked into the pizza box instead? The pizza wasn't gross, it just wasn't great. Very average for all the flavor the menu claims to offer. Hubby had garlic herb on his crust and after I sampled a bite of his crust I tasted no garlic flavor. The howie bread I found to be dry and not the type of cheesy I was looking for. The total was $25.93 for the 2 pizzas and bread which I wouldn't have minded if the food tasted as good as it looked. I might be up for trying this place again in the future, but not anytime soon. 

Other things offered on the menu are salads, calzones and wings. You can also order online.

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

We came here on the Friday of Labor Day weekend. The food was just okay and not very memorable.  There really isn't a Happy Hour menu at Four Peaks.  As it was explained to us, "the drinks are $1.00 off and the food is just the regular prices."   

This is the sort of thing you run into at Craft Brewers that serves food.  A lot of times they confuse their beer sales, as proof of their food success.  It's too bad they don't eat here.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
Very, very noisy and somewhat overly attentive service, particularily from those busing tables.

MENU:
Everything under the sun, but nothing that stands out:
Chicken Rolls $7; Spinach Artichoke Dip $8; Garlic Cheese Beer Bread $6; Cheese Puffs $7; Spanekopita $7; Wings $7; Nachos $7; Quesadilla $7; Thai Hummus $6; Stuffed Poblano $8; Chicken Strips & Fries $8; Pub Fish and Chips $9; Chicken Enchiladas $9; Carne Adovada $10 and various pizzas starting at $13.50

SERVICE:
As noted above, they are overly attentive, including their over the top busers. They seem to excel at taking your plates before you have finished your food. LOL.  No, it's actually not funny.

FOOD:
Four Peaks is a Craft/ Micro brewer http://www.craftbeer.com/breweries/brewery-locator/find-a-us-brewery  who uses the restaurant to sell their beer.  Now, normally that isn't a bad thing. Except the food here is uninspiring at best.  RAM, Rock Bottom, Yard House, Gordon Biersch, BJs all do it quite well, but these are restaurants concepts trying to sell food and beer, in that order.

We tried their  Spanekopita, which they describe as a blend of cheeses, spinach, pine nuts, and dill rolled in phyllo dough and served with marinara sauce. We actually liked this very much and would recommend it.  

On the other hand, their Five Layer Nachos was a big miss. It came out cold and you could peal the cheese off the nacho chips. We added chicken ($2.50) which looked like it came out of a Sysco bag and dropped on top before serving. Ugh.

As you would expect, the beer at Four Peaks is very much Four Stars.  We enjoyed their Oatmeal Stout and their 8th Street Scottish Ale, both of which had low IBUs and 4.8-5.2% alcohol.  

PRICES:
Expect to pay around $40 including tax and tip, depending on how many pints you are going to enjoy.

Had an interesting breakfast today, since my Shanghai Boofay lunch was so early.  
MikeC, NormR, RandH, DarenC, and I met up at the place which has recently opened in the carcass of the former original location of China Star Boofay, in the carcass of a former Red Lobster, near 43rd Ave and Bell Rd in North Phoenix.
So since there will soon be several thorough reviews from notable Yelpilluminati, I will stick to those areas that are uniquely mine:

Greasy~Crispy Spectrum:
.-. 4 stars .-.  nothing was too soggy at all, and there was a crispy outside on very many dishes.  Bonus that the terryaki chicken appeared not to have been deep fried but perhaps baked.

Discard Pile:
.-. 4 stars .-.  i had very little to cut off or spit out (thinking even of the short ribs) and most dishes actually had absolutely zero Discard Pile.  Notable were both the honey and orange chicken, and a nice crisped-up outside on the wontons.

McKenna Novelty Factor:
.-. 5 stars .-. (here's another category, newly named, for how i judge a boofay, whether it's got the 'same old same old' or it has unique items that you can't get just anywhere)  Shanghai had several items that were pretty novel.  Scoop-it-yer-damn-self Thrifty ice cream in about 8 different flavors.  Sushi bar that included seaweed salad and other acoutrements.  Also of note was what Norm said was called a Dessert Soup, which had a yellowish syrupy looking liquid with a small amount of blanched peanuts and red grapes floating in it, along with what at first apeared to be bits of tripe, like in menudo! Norm later figured out that it was ceylon agar (just think of it as vegan gelatin - it's from seaweed!), and with the server's help, that the small round fruits that looked like small apricots or orange lychee, were in fact a chinese fruit called loquat, we supposed related to the cumquat, every gradeschool boy's favorite thing to call someone as a name, since it's a real fuit and how can you get in trouble for that?

RyanC-isms:
.-. 3 stars .-.  A few personal favorites were missing, such as bean sprouts and a General tsao-type chicken (the spicy chicken they had wasn't spicy at all, and was mostly jalapeno flavored).  I also wish I could have put some chocolate syrup on my ice cream.  The lone bowl of rainbow sprinkles made me wish for more of a sundae bar, although MikeC seemed to be doing very nicely with the cone(s)!
  $7-something for lunch is just allright since it doesn't include the drink.   The decor is comfortable and clean.  The service was excellent, with plates cleared quickly, and friendliness all around.   The nice ladies found answers to our questions and even took our picture, too!

The Cheesesteaks here are now the best I've had in town! There was a flyer put on my door earlier in the week from this place and it sounded good so hubby and I gave this place a try. Hubby actually ordered a "Original Cheesesteak" with cheese whiz, onions and peppers, but I ended up eating almost half of it. I just loved the flavor and enjoyed every bite! The sandwich was 10 inches long and stuffed with thinly shaved beef. We shared a order of "Mozzarella Sticks" priced at $7 and they were cheesy. Each one had their own unique shape as they are hand breaded to order. Be prepared for lots and lots of oozing cheese with these! I do wish the breading had more flavor, but they are totally worth ordering. I ordered a "Italian White Pie" priced at $16.50 and it was 14 inches. The pizza had mozzarella, ricotta, sausage, broccoli rabe, garlic and caramelized onions. I liked the pizza, but it actually tasted much better re-heated the next day for lunch. The guy who took our order and gave us our food was nice. I'd like to come back and try some of their other pizzas, sandwiches, salads and of course I will be back for more cheesesteak! 

Delivery is offered. Check the website to see if you are in the delivery area. They have different lunch specials daily.

(Review of buffet only)

Interesting choice of location to set up a new Indian buffet on the east side of town considering you have Mint, India Masala, Origin India, Gandhi, and Taste of India all within a 2 mile radius, although I think it's the others that should be intimidated, since the new kid in town has got some bhangra swagger.  Pretty much all of its rivals are in little strip malls of varying degrees of  decay, so this should not deter you in terms of its exterior.  Once you step inside, the modern decor with track lighting, single open room layout, and seemingly endless linear display of offerings along the buffet line should set your mind at ease.  

Upon being seated, you are immediately prompted if you would like naan bread with your buffet.  Not only should you say yes, but you should specifically request the garlic naan since the aroma alone with the freshly minced garlic and finishing brush of ghee emanating from the freshly cut bread removed from the tandoori oven is intoxicating enough to get your appetite revved up on the feast that lies ahead (refills are complimentary if you need more)

As one approaches the buffet line, the first wave of offerings include various meats including the standards such tandoori, tikki masala, and curry chicken along with some wild cards such as goat curry and reshmi kababs, which is a ground chicken meatball that seems a bit healthier than the sauced meats.   The latter half of the line offers a multitude of vegetarian offerings including saag paneer (spinach), chana masala (spicy stewed chickpeas), eggplant, mixed curry veggies, and lentils.  The third category of offerings is the carbs, which in this case included plain basmati, a spicy chicken biryani, mini-samosas (which gives you more of the flaky crust to enjoy, much like why mini-pecan pies are superior to regular pecan pie), idli (a steamed rice cake), and something I've never seen before, a spongy savory cake called dhokla, which I've read to be a beloved street snack in the southern part of India.  It has a cornbread-like consistency, a rich yellow hue from turmeric and mustard seeds, and is served with some chili peppers, cilantro, and toasted coriander seeds.  Add a dollop of tamarind, and it is a pretty addictive combo of flavors which I would have had more of had I not discovered it at the end of my meal.  

I almost never have room for desserts after an Indian buffet but it is a rotating mix of gulab jamun(sweet milk balls), rice pudding, gajar halwa (carrots+milk), and a few offerings of fruit which I am always a bit wary of when it comes to buffets in general.  

Service was very good in which plates were cleared and water was refilled efficiently, and the staff checked in a few times to see how I was enjoying the meal.  Compared to the local competition, price point is excellent (9.99 vs 10.99 at India Masala, and 12 and up at Mint and Gandhi), quality of food is definitely in my top 3 in Vegas (Mount Everest and Taj Palace), and highlights include the garlic naan, balance in offerings between vegetarian and meat dishes,  a few unique offerings (mini samosas and dhokla), and ambiance.  India Masala is still my go-to choice for take out buffet due to quantity (refer to my review for my patented packing technique) as well as complimentary Mango Lassi with yelp check-in, but if I'm dining in, Delhi Indian is my new go-to place for quality when I plan to go on an Indian carb feeding frenzy for lunch.

With the exception of a check-in snafu caused by the very "green" & inexperieced hostess, I'd have to say I had a pretty good experience at the tea lounge at the Mandarin Oriental.  I just have one point of advice, check your reservation with the hostess at least three times. By then, it may sink in for her.

Ok, let's carry on shall we?

Located adjacent to registration above the 23rd floor, you'd think the Tea Lounge was part of the lobby. But make no mistake, these premium seats come at a lofty price tag and a reservation to boot.  

Luckily, we were seated by the panoramic window as I requested and service, albeit a bit slow, was paced nicely and lent to the whole relaxing afternoon tea experience.  With that in mind, the tea selection was fairly limited but adequate for my needs. There were a host of green teas and herbal teas to accommodate most individual preferences and tastes IMO. Since I just arrived from a massage session, I went with the introspective herbal relaxation tea. The tea service runs from 2-5 pm daily and reservations are highly recommended as there are only a few tables in the lounge.  The views can be quite spectacular if you're seated by the window. We had a perfect view of the strip and City Center and the natural lighting was equally relaxing and calming.  

The food selections included a selection of finger sandwiches inspired by English afternoon "high tea" traditions, but where was the cucumber cream cheese?
In any case, the selections included a savory smoked salmon cucumber and watercress spread sandwich (my favorite of the bunch) egg salad & chives on brioche, curried chicken salad, and black forest ham. The tea service also included the best scones I've ever had in my life! These were buttery, light, flaky and irresistibly good. They came out nice and warm, served with some fresh berry jam, marmalade and an imported Devonshire clotted cream (extremely smooth and very addictive.) So addictive, in fact,  I found myself wanting to spread it on practically everything!  
Lastly, our afternoon tea service was completed with a selection of small bite sized desserts and pastries, which included macarons, tarts and chocolates.

By the end of the meal, I felt nicely sated and totally relaxed. I would definitely return on my next trip to Vegas but im going to have to put that hostess on check!

Happy Eats!

Received a killer deal for a 4 day/3 night stay at Encore. Turned out to be ~$116/night package that included a Wynn buffet for two for 3 days and two tickets to Le Rve.  Hey that's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick any day in my book!

Dang SWEET right?!
I'm saving a lot of money by coming here right?!
They don't call it Lost Wages for nothing right?!

Spent two days playing craps at the Encore Casino.  I wasn't even planning on playing there, but their Craps tables stuck with the $10 minimum all weekend long.  I thought for sure they would raise it to a $25 min, but no such luck.  So I couldn't resist and to my detriment, I lost big time.  I did have a 20+ roll streak and won some of it back.  Drank a lot of "free" Bloody Mary's and Dirty Martini's.  But no matter how you look at it, Encore/Wynn got their money's worth outta me.   Even though I didn't end up with a roll of 100's in my pocket, I did not leave this place disappointed.  (I did end up having enough to buy a Ho Dduk the next time I'm at Koo's ;P) 

The rooms were awesome; roomy suites (requested more shoe polish and they gave me 10 cans of it!), huge spa-like bathrooms accommodated with robes, slippers, and a flat-screen TV.  Also for your viewing pleasure, awesome views of the entire strip or downtown LV.  Part of the deal included free Wi-Fi, and use of the fitness club; a very sweet setup with a juice bar, cold and room-temp bottled water, headphones, and ample sweat towels.  When staying at the Encore/Wynn, you also have access to their "European" outdoor pool where Steve Wynn proudly states that you are free to go topless if desired.  So we went and indeed, there were many uninhibited women who were "propped up" and indeed topless.  More power to them.  Cabaas can be rented on a per/day basis.   

I wish we came to LV to experience more places to eat, but with my losing streak and money leaving my wallet left and right, we ended up eating at the "free" buffet for either lunch or dinner all three days... AND YES, I AM SO SICK OF THE WYNN BUFFET.  Even though we earned another free buffet for two the next time we go, I don't think I'll want to spend any more time there.  The one great thing was the wait service.  The waiters we had were all very nice, cordial, and attentative.  As far as the buffet was concerned nothing to write home about.  I think I did eat about 10 crme brulees as that was all that was memorable.

Le Rve was a watery enigma of a story about a lost lover who is shown a world of the underground, ravaged with temptation, and is always being pulled back and forth until the end.  At least that's my take on it.  But a great production none the less.

What to write for my 1600th review?

Sometimes, sage sayings can be contradictory. For example, the definition of intelligence is sometimes given as the ability to learn from one's past mistakes but it is also said that the definition of stupidity is repeating the same action again and again and expecting a different outcome!

With certain honourable exceptions such as Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley, I tend to be wary of restaurants in hotels, regarding them as traps for hotel guests too lazy to leave the hotel in search of a top notch meal

However, when I booked to watch Ka at the MGM Grand, I was intrigued by the omakase tasting menu at Shibuya, the Japanese restaurant located in their restaurant row. With a line-up of ingredients including toro, wagyu, foie gras and lobster, it looked very promising though I knew that it would take a first rate Japanese meal to satisfy me as I was also dining at another local Japanese legend in Vegas and favourite amongst Yelpers on the same trip - Raku (http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/raku-las-vegas#hrid:kQccGZ8GEw6cqZNBUqkwpQ)

I made my reservation via the hotel website and the only wrinkle in the evening was that my table wasn't ready at the time I booked

The restaurant is gargantuan, a definite contrast to the intimate Raku but I did appreciate the stylish surroundungs. There was a Vegas buzz of excitement to the place and despite the size of the operation, my food arrived quickly but the meal was well paced

1. Amuse of Kushi Oyster with Apple Momiji and Orange Ponzu
I usually like my oysters freshly shucked, briney and metallic from the sea but here, the citrus notes did enhance the meaty oyster

2. Trio of hamachi
This delicate fish was served in different preparations. Firstly as a sashimi with a hint of garlic, ginger and pepper. Then a tartar where the minced fish was mixed in with tobiko and garlic-infused ponzu. Lastly again as sashimi with wasabi, wasabi oil and Hawaiian red salt. A lovely contrast of 3 preparations

3. Sashimi duo
My first slice of sashimi was one of my favourite fish - chu toro (fatty part of the tuna belly), served with ginger soy sauce and spiced crunchy garlic. The other piece was kanpachi, yuzu juice and black truffle oil. Yummy sashimi

4. Tataki of Australian wagyu beef, lemon tamari soy, tarragon oil and garlic chips
The beef was almost sweet with freshness and the lemon lifted it with the nice contrast of crunchy garlic chips

5. Ezi Ebi
If I tell you that this dish was Australian lobster tail and day boat scallops in uni sake butter sauce and that it tasted every bit as magnificent as it sounds, I think I can rest my case

6. Niku
Braised Kobe-style short rib was served with sauted foie gras and rounded off with sweet and spicy soy. The meat was meltingly tender and the sauce wasn't over-sweet. The umami hit from the foie gras was heavenly as usual

7. Maine Lobster Miso Soup, Green Onions, Shitake Mushrooms
No ordinary soup as you can tell from the ingredients!

8. Nigiri with freshly grated wasabi root

9. Dessert Tasting
Raspberry-Yuzu calpico pannacotta, choco-lychee mousse cake, and mochi ice cream proved a tasty, sweet and surprisingly light end to a magnificent meal

As you can tell just from reading the review (until Yelp invents smell-o-vision or taste-o-vision, I'm afraid my photos will have to do with helping me enhance my words), this was a legendary meal. Top class ingredients were treated sympahetically and allowed to sing with complementary sidekicks that enhanced and not take over. Recognisably Japanese but with a nod to western ingredients

As for restaurants in hotels, I'm very happy to eat my words provided the words are as delicious as the food at Shibuya!

Defalco's rates five stars for me because every dish on the menu that I have tried tastes fabulous. I found Defalco's the first week during my initial scouting trip to Arizona a few years ago.

After my first taste of their Chicken Parmigiana sandwich I was hooked. I love the meatball sandwich as well. But my favorite is definitely the Italian Sausage served with roasted green peppers and onions with the marinara sauce on the roll of your choice. Talk about foodie nirvana; The Italian Sausage sandwich does it for me.

I keep coming here because the food is excellent and the pricing is reasonable. One time my family members ordered half sandwiches of the same item and they gave us the full sandwich pricing which was a discount from half sandwich pricing. They didn't have to do that. But that's just one of the ways that they look out for their customers. This place gets really busy and it can be a challenge to find seating during the busy lunch and dinner hours.  They also have a thriving deli.

One of these days I've got to try the pizza.

Well, I have to admit that I wasn't expecting to be blown away by the cuisine here, but goodness gracious was I. Stopped in promptly after 5pm to sample this new East Blvd restaurant installment and I'm thrilled that we did. It's in the old Sutton House building at the corner of East and Kenilworth. You can't miss it now. Upon the Yellow brick rests a glorious mural facing the Kenilworth side and it's gnarly. Really like the aesthetic. 

The interior has your typical kitschy bar decor, pop art on surfboards, and plenty of beer paraphernalia. Tables, booths along the east wall, ample bar seating, 25 draught beers with plenty being local(s), cocktails a gogo, and a moderately expansive menu. On to the meal.

Started with the chips and salsa -- Pineapple and tomatillo. The pineapple salsa was great, perky, laden with cilantro, and super sweet. It worked well with the lime salt on the chips. The tomatillo....lacking. It had a pretty viscous consistency and I didn't enjoy it very much at all. Topped with a bit of Cholula and it was passable. There are a few different salsas. I'm looking forward to trying them all. 

Tacos. Hmm where to start other th....AMAZING. Dude. Seriously. The tortillas are textbook. Flour tortillas were choice du jour and are lightly fried, puffy, housing a slight crunch and retains a light chew throughout. I'd like to lobby for a take-home pack of these tortillas, por favor. Went with the pablano shrimp tacos. Sign me up. Every time. Smoky pablanos, chipotle cream, slaw, spicy shrimp. I didn't want them to end. Your order can consist of two or three tacos. I went with two and it was plenty for an entree. 

Tempura avocado tacos. Umm...vegetarians should be lining the block for these. I was astonished at the flavor(s). I may order these again for myself. Great job, fellas. 

Sides. Mexican Street Corn. I repeat, MEXICAN STREET CORN. Just go look at the photo I posted. Stellar execution. Try it. Thank me later. Repeat. 

Black beans and rice. They were A-OK. Flavor was rather pungent but a nice rounded side for tacos. 

Price point is fair, staff was suuuuper friendly, and the location is great. Only real problem, which I'm sure all could commiserate on, is the parking issue. We walked since we live in the neighborhood, but the parking situation is abysmal. Garage parking, some street parking, or snag a space at an adjacent business and pray not to get towed. Maybe that vacant lot can turn into something in the future? Hmmm...

Synopsis: We'll be back. Very soon. (For more of those tacos, no doubt)

Cheers and welcome to the neighborhood, Longboards!

I used to go across the street to Grimaldi's, completely oblivious to Novecento's existence, but now that my eyes have been opened thanks to the check-in prowess of my Yelpers, this has become my top choice of pizza spots.
Let's begin with the easy, no-nonsense approach to ordering, much like you would a typical phone-in pizzeria you can select whatever toppings you desire on a base pizza you like...we like the Margherita Pizza...marinara, fresh mozarella, fresh basil, grated cheese, and EVO...AND we add fresh garlic and fresh ricotta cheese. Yes, everything is FRESH! The assembly line style ordering starts with hand stretched dough, then goes to toppings which are thoughtfully dotted on your pizza. Be sure to ask them to brush the fresh garlic oil on first, it makes it. Then the crust gets seasoned before it goes into the bright red HOT oven that bakes your pizza in 90 seconds!  At that speed why would anyone pay MORE and wait longer for average delivery pizza?
We also love getting either a burrata or caprese salad with our pizza. I can't seem to find burrata in most Italian restaurants, now I can get it at my local pizza joint! Oh happy day! 
The pizza has a nice chewy thin crust with bubbled charred areas, sauce is light and a little bit wet (but I don't mind) the cheese is perfectly melted and doesn't have that pool of grease from processed cheeses. We usually share a regular pizza between the 2 of us but you can eat an entire pizza and not feel that bad because it is so light. I wouldn't wait too long to eat your pizza because it does get soggy from the sauce.
The burrata is very creamy and rich, and it does fill you up a little. The other times, we opt for the caprese salad which is much lighter. 5 simple ingredients mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic and EVO...delicious.
Now I'm accustomed to paying a bit of a premium for a pizza and salad at Grimaldi's, but at Novecento's our bill for a salad and pizza is usually around $20...what a deal and we don't have to worry about taking home leftover pizza and the whole car reaking of garlic.

I dig Nosh & Swig. They had me from the second I walked through the door and they were playing Tupac. The vibe and the food are just too cool to pass up. Food porn that tastes as good as it looks.

NOSH- You all I know I can nosh. 
Beef Lumpia-Wonton thing. Delish. Served with a sweet and spicy chili sauce and garnished with green onions. Not on the menu, but if you are lucky it just might be a Chef Special that day. 

Pretzel Brat $8- You REALLY need to order these. Chicken sausage, sauerkraut, cheese gravy on pretzel roll. I cannot begin to tell you how much I enjoyed this and I don't usually get down on kraut. Everything works with this and it came on two separate rolls which was perfect for sharing.

Monte Cristo $7- ORDER THIS. My favorite dish here. The mellow melted goodness of the Gruyere complimented the smokiness of the Black Forest ham. But it doesn't end there. It's then topped with a perfectly fried egg and warm berry compote. Hot damn I loved this. 

Truffled Tots- ORDER THESE The best tater tots I have ever tasted. They were creamy, yet crisp on the outside and topped with shredded cheese. Every bite tasted of truffle and made me wish my friend I was dining with was allergic to potato so I could eat every single one of them. No such luck. We both battled it out for the last tater. You won't be disappointed with these and if you are well we probably wouldn't be friends anyways and your mutha's a whore.

Cock-A-Waffle-Doo $10- This was good, real good in fact. My only problem and it's a total personal one because I'm not perfect is it was dark meat. I don't enjoy dark meat chicken, yet it was crispy, flavorful and worked well with the sweet Belgium waffle and Berry Maple reduction. P.S. I could drink the reduction all by itself. 

Spicy Edamame $2- Small portion, but not short in flavor. GET THIS, TOO. We destroyed this and loved the sauce so much we were dipping the tots in it. 

SWIG- I slurped up the Chata-Effup which was a-okay. I am still excited for them to get their liquor license because I know they will have some crazy good cocktails.

Prices are cheap for the creative delicious dishes this place is bangin' out. Great place for sharing plates in a casual environment. The service was on point and friendly. These are good people executing great food and I can't wait to bring everyone I know back to grub and rap with me! IT WAS ALL A DREAM. I USE TO READ.....

How much would you pay for a popular & busy buffet with hundreds of quality choices?

   A: $54
   B: $74
   C: $94
   D: Anything ... just let me in the freakin' buffet already

Be prepared to pay any of those prices at Bacchanal Buffet cause this is the current "It" buffet in Vegas. Caesar's Palace can pretty much charge whatever they want. The line is KuRAAAYzeee. We tried to go for dinner Monday before Christmas and the line was 3 1/2 hours long. That's over 200 minutes. We read on Yelp about an "Express" option for $20 extra, but it wasn't available that night. We left.

So, we came back on Christmas Eve for a late lunch. The set-up was different and line much shorter ... because it was a 25-minute line to put your name in for a time slot 3 1/2 - 4 hours later. The registration part is cool if you can wait. I can't. Luckily, the "$20 Express" option was available at that time. Whew! Seriously, I would of paid anything to skip the wait. So, after paying $74 for lunch per person, we headed to ... the next line. It took another 25 minutes to get seated with express. 

      This better be one hell of a buffet!

            It was. 

Here's what I pigged out on for a couple hours ... 

Meats & Seafood
 - Chilled Shrimp
 - Chilled Crab Legs
 - Warm Crab Legs
 - Rack of Lamb
 - Oysters on the Half Shell
 - Prime Rib
 - Sausages
 - Chicken
 - Ribs
 - Mussels
 - Chinese-style Crab
 - Crawfish

Sides
 - Caprese Salad
 - Sliced Pineapple
 - Pho Noodle Soup
 - Turkey Pot Pie
 - Charcuterie Meats
 - Cheeses
 - Steamed Dumplings
 - Creamed Leeks & Lobster
 - Sushi Rolls
 - Cranberries
 - Sliders
 - Bread
 - Crab Benedict
 - Chinese Broccoli

Desserts
 - Fresh Crepes
 - Red Velvet Whoopie Pies
 - Gelato
 - Creme Puffs
 - Vanilla Creme Brulee
 - Chocolate Creme Brulee
 - Buttercream Pops
 - Cheesecake Pops
 - Berry Mousse Tarts
 - Fresh Cookies

Bacchanal Buffet really is a great buffet. It is, of course, overpriced and hardly worth the wait, but if you want quality and choices like this in Vegas you have to either pay for it or have the patience of a very bored saint to stand in line. When you do finally get into Bacchanal, go nuts on the seafood and meats so at least you feel like you're making it worth your money/time.

Out celebrating our friends 1 year wedding anniversary, I wanted a margarita. After checking out a few places we settled on this place. We stood forever at the hostess stand waiting to be seated. Finally a girl came over and took us to a table and gave us menus. Priced at $12.50 (regularly priced $17.50 when not on special) I ordered a strawberry "Margarita-by-the-Yard" and I couldn't taste any alcohol at all. Our friends couldn't taste any in theirs either, so we asked our server when she finally came back around if we could buy some shots to add to it. She said they are $1 per shot so I ordered 2 shots to add to mine. The margarita seemed like it was mostly ice and I just didn't care for it.

I figured with salsa being in the name of this place that we would get the standard complimentary chips and salsa, but nope! Chips and salsa cost here! I decided to just order a "Mexican Pizza" priced at $7.95 to munch on. It was a flour tortilla that had a crunch to it with pinto beans, cheese, salsa and sour cream. The beans weren't very warm and tasted bland. Honestly the fresh avocado was the only good part about it. Maybe if their margaritas actually gave people a buzz the food would taste better! 

Our server wasn't great about checking on us and slow with bringing out our drinks and food. She carded us when we ordered the drinks, but then carded our friend 2 more times and he didn't even order but one drink that he was already carded for. She seemed a bit spacey. I didn't mind the prices at all, but wasn't satisfied with my drink, food or the service we recieved. I can

**This place looses a star because I got hasseled for writing this review!!* 
The Heard is many things to many people. 

For Non-natives it is a place to learn about the various cultures of ancient, recent historical and modern Native Culture. 

For Natives of the southwest - it is a place where we are understood and celebrated.

There are so many things I love about this place and I am pleased to share with you my favorite spots in the museum.
- The Navajo Sand painting that is displayed the Navajo Hogan in the Homelands Exhibit. It depicts the Navajo Creation Story and is intricate and beautiful.

- The Hopi Wedding Dress inside the Homelands Exhibit

- The Photograph of the Grave yard outside the Indian School in the Boarding School Experience. 

- The Statue of Native women outside the museum. 

- The Yazzie Mural inside the We Are exhibit. It depicts the story of the Navajo and Yaqui Tribe's modern history. 

-The beaded chucks in the Shoes exhibit! I want a pair!!

When it comes to the Heard's Gift shop: now this place is amazing!! Many of their pieces are authentic and hand crafted. BUT THERE ARE FAKES AMONG THEM!!! Feel free to ask a lot of questions. Even try to negotiate prices. You never know, some of those pieces have been there for YEARS! Demand certificates of authenticity. Ask to know the meaning of symbols and designs. Know what materials they're made out of! 

There could be two bracelets that almost identical and one could be silver plated and one could be solid silver. And they could both be priced the same. ASK QUESTIONS!! Ask to try to stuff on. They are usually pretty nice about this, except when it comes to earrings. Many hard to find books can be found here. Whenever someone is doing a research project, the Heard is one of the first places I recommend. I recommend the photography books.

Their exhibits are always changing. So check the website and see what's new. Have fun, bring a friend, and open your mind and see the many wonderful facets of Native American Culture.

****UPDATE****
One of our fellow yelpers Deb K. http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sGzHUN7UpjXUGKckrv-bTw has sent me private messages asking me to edit my review and I am! She believes and knows that all the pieces are authentic at the Heard's Gift Shop. 

She has said and I quote: "Hi Cher, Deb K. here--actually, I do work at the Heard and I can tell you that everything that we sell is authentic."  and she even goes on to say, "Maybe you're thinking about those dreamcatchers and whatnots in the back? Even those have to come from a Native-owned and operated establishment. [although I do agree they're kind of tacky, but you know the bilagaanas (White People)...they do like their kitschy stuff]" And what really got me was: "I really feel you should go back and change the part about the shop offering 'fake' items". 

As a Native American, sometimes it's a love/hate relationship with the Heard. The Heard is the premier launching pad for non-natives in this city to experience Indian Country but sometimes it comes at a price. We are often objectified and practically forced to share that which is sacred to us. But it's allowed and it's a choice that each Native artist that has dealt with has the Heard made for themselves. 

There is an unequal representation of Tribes on display at the Heard, the Navajo exhibit is HUGE at the Heard and yet the O'odham exhibit is medium sized. Even though O'odhams have contributed over $1,000,000.00 to the museum. We don't complain, atleast our ways are being shared right? And it's nice to take children to the museum and see their little eyes light up when they see things that reminds them of home. And the Boarding School Exhibit opens MANY eyes to the history that existed just a few blocks north. This slices through me and I'm so grateful this piece of history is no longer being ignored.

Like I said - it's a love/hate relationship. I love the Heard because they give opportunities to Native Artists and share our culture as sensitively as possible. But it's an uphill battle to be deemed good enough to be one of those artists and people who shares our culture. I know of many great people who I personally feel should be "let in" be denied and my heart goes out to them. I love that Natives still get in for free but I hate that the Heard treats AZ tribes like we're obligated to help them to keep their lights on. I love that all the tribes in Arizona have been given the oppurtunity to share a piece of their culture yet I hate that the museum focuses on two tribes.

To my yelpers: Please realize that each tribe has it's own ways and unique culture. Open your heart and mind and take in the colorful culture I grew up in!

Pellini is a solid Four Stars.

After reading Ryan J's post on Yelp's "Near You" section online, I walked across the street to have a late lunch.  I arrived around 2:30 and there was less than a dozen or so diners, both inside and out. Apparently at lunch time, they had a line two deep outside. This was after being open to the public for three and half weeks.  A good gauge as any for a new restaurant.

Like Ryan, my first impressions are pretty positive.  The concept if you will, is an Italian version of Chipotle.  I'm not sure if the owners would agree, but here are your big three choices.

First, you could start with a Pellini.  What they say is a classic Italian Piadina.  A sort of Italian flat bread (think tortilla) that you can stuff with meat, veggies, cheese and dressing.

Or, you could have a Pasta Bowl with an angel hair base, then the grilled meats, veggies and cheese.

Lastly, you could have a Salad Bowl, again with all of the above added on.  Got it?

The meats range from two types of chicken (breaded chicken breast or grilled), steak florentine with olive oil and garlic, italian sausage, scrimp scampi, salmon with rosemary and lemon zest, or you could just go Vegan.  

The prices range from $6.55, up to $7.95 for the two fish entrees.  At this point, you can add from nearly two dozen ingredients, like artichoke hearts, pancetta, grilled eggplant, arugula, et cetera.

I had the Pellini with grilled chicken with spicy marinara (Arrabiata) and various veggies.  It was very good (photo) and filling.  

I had a chance to meet two of the managers and they were very excited on how they have been received with very little marketing.  I understand this is their first restaurant in the concept and are looking at other locations in the valley.

Pellini offers free WiFi and they have an Italian radio station playing music in the background for ambience. 

Enjoy!

Forte was mysteriously closed on a recent Saturday night, yet my wife was unable to shake her hunger for Eastern European cuisine.  Nothing else would do.  You know those Snickers commercials "you're not you when you're hungry"?  My wife turned into Dolph Lundgren aka Ivan Drago from Rocky 4.  For a brief moment, I feared for my life ;)  A Bulgarian friend recommended BG Bistro a while ago and it was the perfect time to give it a shot. 

I found it curious that outdoor seating was offered when all to see was a Smith's supermarket parking lot.  The cigarette smoke hit me as soon as I entered.  Was this their way of staying authentically Eastern Europe?  I kinda felt like a tourist.  With all the college football games going on that moment, they opted to show golf and soccer on their TV's to enhance the Europeanness.  I could see the smoke being a huge turnoff to prospective patrons, definitely wore it upon exit.   But on this evening, we would NOT be deterred.   DRAGO!!!

Our friendly waitress walked us through the menu and specials.  The priciest entres were the daily specials of lamb chops or grilled trout for only $13.  I was so close to getting one of them, but the kufteta was calling my name.  Grilled Bulgarian meatballish burger patties made with pork were juicy and accompanied by 3 small salads: potato, bean (blaaand), and cabbage.  The tomato sauce on the side went well with the kufteta, we asked for more.    

I should have traded out the bean salad for fries topped with Bulgarian feta.  Lots of tables ordered that as a stand-alone dish.   Bulgarian feta is good stuff.  It's quite different from the popular Greek version, creamy while still being firm.  That really shines when shredded like in the shopska salad at the start of our meal.  It also tasted great when baked in a clay pot with lukanka, egg and tomato sauce.  The lukanka had a nice, lean salami and bacon taste to it.  I'd love to try their other dried meats.  The Bulgarian red wine was served cold and went well with everything.  A bottle was only $18.  Nazdrave!  
   
Got talked into the biscuit cake for dessert after some arm-twisting.....light twistin..............OK....no freaking twist at all.  She simply suggested it and we said yes.   Glad we did!  It was like a sweeter tiramisu.  

So the food definitely made up for the smokiness, but BG Bistro would not be for everyone.   Pretty cool that it's in the same plaza as Villa Algarve though.  A burgeoning international plaza!!

There aren't many of us out there, but I'm Luxy enough for this to be my neighborhood coffee stop.

Now don't go telling people my dirty little secret; but truthfully, coffee isn't really my 'cup of tea'. You know what is my cup of tea? Tea! and Earl Grey takes top billing. Earl really knows his tea, and Lux has that too. With a few minute walk, bike, or scooter ride from my front door to Lux, the wife and I like making this a frequent stop for a hot beverage or cold, people watching, dessert, or snack outing. 

While here, I wouldn't be surprised to see one of the top billed Yelping regulars, out of town coffee pilgrims, or Juan Valdez himself. I'm told by my buddies and my girl the coffee here is just that good.

Lux has a menu of fresh baked pastries, goodies, and other breakfasty items, like eggs, veggies, and bacon. There's also a full bar back there for those of you who venture past the coffee and pastry line. Careful though, 'cause Lux can get packed during morning, lunch and evening hours with most of the prime spots filled up already by gaggles of laptopians doing a work from "home" type of thing.

Now I've not personally worked from a coffee shop before, but I sometimes wonder how much 'work' is actually getting done. Maybe people just claim to work and are really just hanging out for the uber cool ambiance or the free wifi. I think Mr. Valdez did have is iPhone out the other day trying to connect up to the Yelp app. 

The walls here are spotted with local artistry that is on a seemingly endless rotation. Come back in a week or so and you might find something new hanging up there. If your a light rail fan, pop off at Campbell and Central and stop on in!

Happy Yelping Phoenix! It's time for today's caffeine fix.

On a recent trip to Sin City, a visit to Serendipity was on the top of my list. I've been to the original NYC location several times, and looked forward to seeing how this west coast location compared to the east coast OG one. My partner in crime for the weekend, Li, had never been to either location, so was more than happy to accompany her. 

Slightly hungover, we needed sustenance before diving into the famous Frozen Hot Chocolate. I was shocked to find out that the wait was only 20 minutes. The interior doesn't quite have the charm and coziness of the NYC location, but is open and spacious. There is also outdoor seating available. The music was an eclectic mix of 80s, 90s, and current tunes, which I appreciate, but the volume was a bit loud for my liking. 

So, we ordered: 
- Cup of Tomato Soup: The flavor and texture were perfect, and one of my best I've ever had. I loved how it was accented with goldfish crackers. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=Hni3DAqO9NXPth8mNsK5eA 

- ABC Burger: Avocado, Brie Cheese burger. Li and I were intrigued with this unique combo, and decided to split this and it was wonderful. Juicy burger and toasty buns, and ginormous portions of avo and brie. This was accompanied by crisp, sweet potato fries. 

- Frozen Hot Chocolate: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=85Ev04Z-UaQksArEs2ZVNg The grand finale! It didn't disappoint and was super thick and chocolatey. It's better than a chocolate malt/milkshake, as the consistency is icy, yet creamy. This was topped with a huge dollop of whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Talk about choco heaven! Oh Mylanta! We sipped and slurped as much as our stomachs could handle, but failed to finish it. 

Overall, a decent Serendipity experience. Our server wasn't the friendliest nor super attentive. It took some time for my Diet Coke refills, food, and bill  to arrive at our table. Ambiance isn't as quaint and lovely as the NYC location, but it's still fun place to bring your friends and family. Be warned that the prices are a bit high, food portions are large, music is loud, and service can be spotty. There's a lil' retail area for the t-shirts, frozen hot choco packets, etc., Also, unlike the NYC location, there is a take-out window where you can order from a limited menu (some snacks like pretzels, donuts, etc.,as well as frozen hot chocolate) to enjoy in front of the patio tables in front of Caesar's Hotel or to take along while you walk the strip.

Middle Eastern food on the strip!  SLS players club offered $30 off of $60 during my birthday month so that made it a clear choice on a recent Monday night.  It was packed at 8:30pm with quite a few people waiting outside.  I'd suggest making a reservation.  Being the middle ground between casual eateries at the resort (Umami) and high end (Bazaar Meat) makes it easy to see why Cleo is so popular.

The menu offered a lot to ponder over, but my mind was already set on one thing....falafel!  It's not easy to find a good version of those deep fried balls of chickpea/fava bean heaven around these parts, but the ones they're serving up here are falawesome.  The light crunch of the exterior went into delicious, warm legume center that was well spiced.  My only regret was not ordering the side of hummus since the amount that arrived with the plate wasn't even enough for three balls let alone seven.  

A minor complaint was that while six of the balls were dark green on the inside, one was very pale green.  It didn't taste much different...still... can you imagine if Robert DeNiro's character from the film "Casino" saw this?  He would have ripped the chef a new one and then made sure he personally saw to every falafel that came out of the kitchen!  

"Kibbeh Nayyeh": chopped raw lamb accompanied with mint, bulgar and lebaneh, was my wife's favorite dish.  It was unlike any other tartare I'd ever had.  The creaminess of the lebaneh (Lebanese yogurt cheese) blended so well with the meat and the toasted parmesan crackers to spread it on.

I found the shawarma portion to be very small for $8 and would definitely pay more for a full lamb entre or just get kebabs instead.  The moussaka was below average and we didn't even bother finishing it before ordering the impressively rich and decadent sticky toffee dessert.  

There are plenty of other menu items worth checking out on a repeat visit like grilled octopus, flatbreads, and multiple mezzes.  I don't plan on being a stranger.

Where to even BEGIN my review of this DUMP and the MINDLESS, BRAINWASHED, FOOLS who wait in line to catch a glimpse of NOTHING inside is the question.  

Not since "Pink's Hot Dogs" in Los Angeles, have I seen such a ridiculously long line of mindless, brainwashed, DONKEYS waiting to be disappointed!  Fools from all over the world who actually BELIEVE what they see on TV and are easily manipulated into thinking they are in for a treat by standing in line with other MORONS just like them!  Well let me pull the curtain back for all who are planning on coming to Las Vegas and hoping to catch a glimpse of the Pawn Stars cast members and believe they will be walking into a nice clean business that is filled with unique treasures and valuable items they have seen on TV.  After waiting in line for hours, and the curtain is finally pulled back, one will see NOTHING they are expecting!  And are sure to be disappointed!  But one will of course piss their money away on cheap souvenirs before walking out.....IDIOTS!

No cast members work here anymore (Except for shoot days), the place is a DUMP with S#@T for sale just thrown into their dirty display cases with no effort for neatness (Just as any educated person would expect from a pawn shop) but perhaps the best gag of all is the fact that this rat hole makes more money off selling their merchandising items to mindless tourists then by buying and selling items shown on Pawn Stars.  Some of the WORST merchandising items ever created from a TV series (i.e. cast member bobble heads, lame coins w/cast members faces on the, cheap low quality T-Shirts, and various other garbage that sophisticated people would never even consider buying!) P.T. Barnum said it best....."There is a sucker born every minute, and two to take 'em".....in this case, four to take 'em!!!!

Good luck trying to call these clowns, they NEVER answer the phones....not even sure why they still have phone lines, a waste of money if you ask me.  I tried calling them several times due to a rare poster I saw on the show that I wanted to buy.  Guess they are no longer in business to sell items (Except for their TV branded merchandise)

The donkey selling hot dogs outside to the brainwashed crowd, while it is a genius idea to take even further advantage of the long line of fools, I believe the cart is owned by a relative of the pawn shop owner (Go figure)  They also claim to sell "Vienna" hot dogs, which anyone that has been to Chicago knows, are the BEST dogs in the world.  But I highly doubt they are Vienna, my guess is they are Ball Park dogs bought in bulk at Costco and are only being passed off as authentic Vienna dogs.  The Vienna brand umbrella that is displayed above the cart was most likely pawned for pennies on the dollar from a customer years ago.  

Most of you, if not all of you reading this will most likely NOT take my advice of saving you time, money, and your high expectations, and will venture into the long line of waiting SUCKERS anyway.  While it is not my goal to UNBRAINWASH you, it is my goal to pull back the curtain and let you know in advance what to expect when you arrive at this DUMP with the rest of the donkeys.  

While I can't fault the owners of Gold & Silver Pawn for profiting off the success of their hit television show, I can fault them for poor customer service.  Not only do they NOT answer the phones, they also do not list any items of interest that were bough on the show, on their website.  However one can CERTAINLY buy their merchandising GARBAGE online!  It is clear Gold & Silver Pawn is no longer in the pawn business, they are in the retail business of selling themselves.  The only question left is.....how long will it last? Enjoy!

Dang, Cantina Laredo - I wanted to like you so hard!  Like a hot date that ends in a restraining order, like an incredible hike that ends in poison oak or skunk spray - I've walked past this place for years, imagining a swanky, high-end Mexican food joint behind the dark windows and high prices; sadly, what I found was a very regular, uninspired restaurant serving up some rather meh Mexican food.  This was a 'man behind the curtain' Wizard of Oz moment for me.

Good things?  Mmmmmm - the warm spicy salsa which they serve along with another milder cold one (not so good) and chips is the reason this place gets 2 very enthusiastic stars from me - SO DELICIOUS!  It was hook-me-up-to-a-feed-bag delicious.  Service was quick and pleasant.

After that though, it all goes downhill.  Being vegetarian, I can 99% of the time find something meatless and tasty when I go out to eat but there were very few such options here.  I ended up selecting the Enchiladas de Espinaca and subbed in a Cheese & Onion one to shake things up a bit (I know, I'm very exciting).  When my meal came out, the waitress said she had the kitchen put zucchini alongside my Mexican rice instead of beans (wtf - who in their right mind opts out of beans for zucchini at a Mexican food restaurant?!); so began the first of my meal modifications - I might note here that while being veggie, I am a pretty low-maintenance diner.  So, just as the black beans are being brought out, I realize the sauce atop my cheese enchilada consists of red chili with beef chunks - again wtf - in my 31 years of life on this earth, no Mexican food joint I've ever visited has ever converted a cheese enchilada to a meat one via the sauce!  The waitress said they could make me a new cheese & onion with sour cream sauce atop (cringe).  The mushroom and spinach enchilada was kinda gross - something about the oil they used to saut the spinach in gave it a strange taste and the button mushrooms looked like they had been plunked into it straight out of a can.  The zucchini and cheese & onion enchilada were nothing I would ever want to order again.  Black beans were alright - hard to mess those up though.  

In defense of Cantina Laredo, if you're a big meat eater, perhaps you might have more luck here than I.  The place was clean, the workers were nice, the one aforementioned salsa is killer.  But this place is neither authentic nor new-agey Mexican, not worthy of the steeper price points, and certainly lacks any great ambience to carry the lackluster food.  Don't think I will be auditioning this place for a second date or hike - would strongly consider rolling around in poison oak or getting skunk sprayed over coming back - it was that bad.

I have been stopping by here for lunch and like the subs I have had. Inside is very clean and the employees are friendly and say hello when I walk in. They have plenty of tables if you want to eat inside, but I get my food to-go. The meat is sliced fresh and the sandwiches are made to order. Sometimes they can get busy around lunch time and since I'm on a time limit for lunch, I just call in my order for pick up so that it's ready when I arrive. 

Hook and Ladder - A medium costs $5.99 and includes a pickle. The sub has smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham and monterey jack cheese. I like it "fully involved" which means it comes with deli mustard, mayo, onion, lettuce and tomato. Per my request they leave the lettuce off. The subs are served hot and this sub is my favorite of them all. Usually I don't like deli mustard, but there is something about it on this particular sub that just makes it taste great. 

Firehouse Meatball - A large costs $8.49 and depending on your appetite could be shared between two people. This sub has Italian meatballs, provolone, marinara and Italian seasonings. I usually order this one "sweet and spicy" which means they add pepper sauce and red pepper flakes. I really like this meatball sub a lot. It's always hot, the bread good, meatballs good, melted cheese good, but..... there is a consistency issue with the taste of the sweet and spicy part. Sometimes it's just right and sometimes they put so much pepper sauce that it's too hot. When this sub is good it's very good, but when it's drenched in pepper sauce it's hard to taste anything else. 

The medium sub is just perfect for my appetite. If you are the type like my husband who eats 1 footers, you might want to order the large sandwich. They also offer catering.

I'm giving this place 5 stars. The Boyfriend & I decided to randomly try a new place (his idea) and I know he loves Brazilian steakhouses... So I steered us toward this place. At first we weren't sure what to think.. The place looks empty when you walk in, but actually almost every table had people. It took a little bit to get a table, but obviously they were busy. She sat us at a booth, which was perfect for us. The salad bar is significantly smaller than other Brazilian steakhouses but the Stroganoff is out of this world. Best I've ever had! The Boyfriend really liked the grape leaf wrapped something or other. I didn't try them so I have no idea. 
They started bringing out the meat & one of the guys really stood out.  So much personality. Later we realized he was the owner. 

The Boyfriend really liked one of the chicken skewers, but obviously the red meats were the standouts. No one gave us tongs, so it was a little weird getting the meat from the server, but they worked it out. 

The meat selection is similar to other Brazilian steakhouses, but I do think they could do with some sharper knives. Meat quality is good, not great but definitely good. 

This place is definitely a family owned restaurant with the good & bad qualities that go into that. For me personally, eating out is about the experience just as much as food quality and this place goes out of their way to give good experience. Towards the end of the night the owner was singing karaoke and encouraging everyone to get up and sing. Normally that's not really my thing, but something about all the positive energy really made it a lot of fun. When we left everyone was having fun drinking and dancing around. It was a lot of fun.

In a word, Twist.  

The mere idea of the word is enough to send your token foodie's stomach into a conniption fit of pure desire.  The mere whisper of the word is enough to trigger endless blogging and tweeting due to sheer sweaty-handed anticipation.  The mere realization of the word is enough a road trip all the way to Lost Wages to see what all the fuss is about.  

And so it was done.  Off to the south Las Vegas strip we would go in search of langostine (among other things), prepared in the manner of a man who pretty much put langostine on the map.  

Being the gastronomic simpleton that I am, I decided I couldn't pass up a grand opening invite to the first ever dinner service at Twist by Pierre Gagnaire (December 5, 2009).  But in lieu of a ginormous appetite, what I really should've packed was my brain.  Food this complex, this multi-layered, and this (pardon my crude undertone) "weird", simply can't just be engulfed.  It requires several hours of thinking, ruminating, pondering or whatever-the-hell-it-takes to justify paying $400 a head for arguably one of the fanciest and most thought-out meal you'd ever dream of having this west of the Mississippi.  It's been days since engulfing this meal and I STILL can't wrap my head around it (and my stomach definitely had its work cut out for it too).

Surprisingly, it took nearly 5 hours to complete this marathon of a 6-course tasting menu plus 6 courses of added appetizer supplements (note: every single thing I ate is pictorially posted here).  And don't you dare go on thinking that I'm slow and that 12 courses aren't all that much, because under Pierre Gagniere's roof, that really means like 36 presentations.  Do the math.  

Throughout this marathon dinner complete with cocktails and fine wine, Voss water and a few $8 diet cokes sprinkled in "here and there", I began to realize the perplexity as this:  Pierre Gagnaire is, quite truthfully, an enigma of a man.  Forget that he's Michelin starred-this, iconoclastic-that.  Forget that he practically invented all that we have come to realize is "fusion" cuisine.  And just forget that his so-called eponymous "other" location on Rue. St. Balzac near the Champps Elysees is thought of as being the "3rd best restaurant" in the world by Restaurant Magazine (El Bulli in Spain is the 1st).

Pierre Gagnaire creates an inspiring vision for this type of weird food, which is, not surprisingly, just weirdly delicious.  He's even a lovable weird guy himself, so appropriately charming and entertaining us like a "crazy uncle" might do during his brief cameo at our table.

And as we were appropriately informed by our server David, the whole idea is to "taste and experience" all the ingredients which God put on this earth, which might occasionally occur in 1 singular dish.  This is most evident in the first of 3 presentations of Gagnaire's "Shellfish Royale" - somewhat of an oyster extravaganza with a backdrop of toasted beef gele and shallots, as well as his last presentation of "King Sea Bream", a curiously concoction of a "bonito-shellfish gele" with mozzarella ice cream.  I loved the fact seared scallops aren't even safe from Gagnaire's innovative antics as "black olive gelee" provides a certain Mediterranean setting, but then squab breast and foie gras come in to steal the show.  The end result of these seemingly contradictory flavor combinations and layers is this:  each bite resembles something that you have never ever tasted, with few ways to describe them, save for these vague examples --  My first time eating Pierre Gagnaire cuisine allowed me to taste 5 different representations of the langostine, including the unmistakable "head", allowed me to taste (and like) seafood mixed with cheese mixed with meat, and allowed me to eat something that tasted like the splendor that exists in a tidepool.  

Overall, do I have any idea what this means?  Not on your life.  The only thing I can muster up is that a dinner under Pierre Gagnaire's roof is absolutely positively unlike any other eating experience you will ever have.  Ever.  Go there, and you will see.  The originality of it ensures that you cannot and will not be disappointed.

Located by registration and the neighboring crystals wing of the expansive Aria resort, this unassuming contemporary restaurant had me intrigued as soon as I stepped inside. 

As we traversed through the dimly lit bar flanked with purple hued impressionist walled paintings that soared up to the high ceilings and into the main dining area, I couldn't help but be impressed by the sleek modern club-like feel of the space. It was the perfect mix of contemporary cool with traditional elegance. With chilled house music pulsating in the background, I did get an ultra lounge vibe from the restaurant, which was actually refreshing and relaxing. We also didn't feel crammed next to our neighboring diners, which made things feel much more intimate and private.

Our server was full of friendly banter and made every effort to make us feel welcome.  

We all went with the Signature Tasting Menu.  The wait staff knew that we were heading out to a show afterwards so they made sure our dishes came out at a good pace. 

We were started with a tuna tartare amuse bouche that was just the right mouthful of tang & punch of flavor to whet our appetites.

The first courses were all very good. From the fresh oysters to the beautifully prepared wagyu beef tartare to the exceptionally inventive foie gras brle.

The second courses were inspiring and enjoyable, as well. The octopus was grilled to perfection and the dayboat scallops were easily the best I've ever had! These thick golden medallions were beautifully seared on the outside locking in a fluffy and buttery flesh that left me in complete awe bite after bite.

Our third courses were also winners in my book.  The wagyu sirloin was mouthwatering and each tender bite was blissful. The 48 hour braised beef was incredibly soft and you could tell it was cooked for awhile for all those rich, permeating flavors to develop.

Desserts were exquisite and what could be better than a surprise at the very end! A shot of cinnamon hot white chocolate. It was both warm comforting and festive. An excellent end to an amazing meal. 

I can't say enough about my wonderful experience here. It's definitely one I'd gladly experience again and again.

Happy Eats!

"I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know
I've got to know
What is this place that I have found? 
What's this?" - J. Skellington


The lunch bunch had wanted to enjoy Crepe Bar for many months, but had been previously scared away by reports of insane wait times and limited seating (sohwee Janee P).  Realizing that they took reservations, I set aside a table for 6 (really 8) about two weeks prior.  And boy, am I glad I did.

Walking in with Ann R, I didn't see an available table in the place... which is when I noticed J-WoW and Linh were occupying the table of highest honors... the reserved hi-top.

Realizing that our party of 4 was not getting any larger, we shifted to one side of the table to free up four contiguous chairs, because we're thoughtful and stuff.

Our Sep outing found us at Salut Kitchen Bar with the greatest waitress of all time: Keary.  I found her male counterpart: Cody.  This dude embodied the essence of Crepe Bar, fun, witty, timely, and able to turn down a bribe.  I'll be back with more cash...

Being our first time, the table took a while to lock in on palatable entrees, and Cody didn't rush, even though the place was packed.  Even better, since we were at a reserved table, we didn't have to order at the counter.

Dining in a group really is the only way to go.  I paid for one savory crepe, yet was a partaker in four amazing crepe combinations.  I couldn't pick a favorite, they were all so good!

And Cody had the sensibility to hold off on the sweet crepes until our party had completed round 1.  But what's this?  We were being treated to a sampling of paper thin cut radishes on cultured butter.  Hey, it could have been served with ignorant margarine, and I wouldn't have known the difference, but it was nice to feel so froufrou... because, you know.. I'm in the fast lane from LA to Tokyo.  Okay

Upon arrival, I knew J's dessert was going to take the cake.  That crepe was bananas, B.A.N.A.N.A.S.  That crepe was also nutella, N.U.T.E.L.L.A!

One more round of free resplendent Rollos and we were ready for our PhotoOp... which Cody and team made happen.  Overall, it was a FABULOUS lunch.  I'll award the Crepe Bar an: A + + + + + + + + + + !

And I didn't even have to use my AK, today was a good day

Skinnyfats is a terrific mix of healthy and semi-unhealthy (happy) and really caters to almost everyone.  There are a ton of healthy options and that showed with the majority of the fitness clientele who were there during my late 2:30pm lunch.  I thought it would be pretty slow around this time but it was packed.

I got the "Cranburkey" (special recipe turkey burger dressed with arugula, tomato, red onion and a cranberry basil yogurt spread on a 9 grain bun) which was very good.  The highlight was definitely the cranberry basil yogurt spread and this set it apart from the hundreds of turkey burgers I've eaten.  The patty had good flavor and I wouldn't hesitate to order this again.  

I had a choice of truffle fries, sweet potato fries (no more parsnip) or a salad.  To keep it healthy, I should have gone with the salad but I am glad I didn't because they have the GREATEST sweet potato fries I have ever had.  I am sure they were made in house.  The little crystals of sugar on them really took it to another level.  No condiments were necessary with those.  I can't believe I took that many sentences to talk about sweet potato fries but they were really awesome!

My skinny wife that never gains any weight ordered from the "happy side" of the menu.  She ordered the "Chix on Broadway".  Is it a wonder this tasted better than the Cranburkey????  Maybe because it was fried chicken with bacon, cheddar, lemon mayo on a brioche roll but that's just a hunch.  The batter and the fry of the chicken was atypical.  The breading itself was thin so it wasn't your traditional fry but it was still very good.   

I got a large "Mr Green" drink which was a mix of spinach, parsley, kale, romaine lettuce, celery, cucumber, cilantro, apple.  This was probably the first and last green drink I will have with cilantro.  I'll order this again without it as that was the most prevalent flavor next to apple juice.  I do love the majority of green drinks in the world though.  There were 2 options for complimentary water.  One was strawberry basil and the other was raspberry lemon and both were very refreshing.

The space is inviting and set up nicely.  The designer definitely maximized the area.  It just goes to show that if a business offers an excellent product, people will come from anywhere to have it even if they're located in an industrial park on Dean Martin next to a strip club.

Thanks to the awesome review from my yelp buddy Nelson Q, I decided to bookmark this place and make it a point to stop here the next time the boyfriend and I are in town.

After figuring out where it was from where we were staying we put it off until the next day we would be in the general area. This place is not close to the Strip its a little past DTLV, but in my opinion, it's totally worth the drive to get some cheap yummy Mexican treats. The place is located in a small kind of run down business/shopping center. Do not let it scare you, it is safe as for what you find inside will totally be worth it! 

Walking in the first thing, I see is a couple of bags left of my precious snack that I have been longing for, Duroa de Harina with lime and chili salt (or in English wheat pinwheels ).

They also have helado (Mexican ice cream) that is made fresh in house; some of the flavors that I saw there were:

Fresa-Strawberry
Guayaba-Guava
Mango
Pina-Pineapple
Lime
Bubble Gum

and a bunch more that I could not see because not only is this place super small, but after 5:00pm on a weekday, this is the place to be after a hard day at work or school!

If you do order ice cream they offer a free topping as well, which is great! 

They have a nice selection of agua frescas (Horchata, Tamarind and Melon). 

If you are not wanting desert right away then they also have tacos and burritos too, which the boyfriend and I decided that we will have to try the next time we are in town!

They also have Smoothies, Tostilocos (one of my favorites) an assortment of Mexican candy as well!

Prices are amazing for a single scoop of ice cream and my bag of Duroa de Harina it came to under $8.00. 

Note: If you are not certain on how a flavor will taste you can try a sample of it. Everyone working there was very nice and helpful. The parking lot can be a bit of a zoo; we parked toward the end where there were a couple of extra spaces.

Open letter to restaurant customers everywhere (especially Yelpers):

The inc.com article recently discussed in Yelp Talk makes good points about the serious impact that Yelp can have on a business, positive or negative.
http://www.yelp.com/topic/tempe-new-article-on-yelp
http://www.yelp.com/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.inc.com%2Fmagazine%2F20100201%2Fyouve-been-yelped.html

Despite any controversy the article also may have included, I realize the importance of being a responsible reviewer more after reading it, and hope I can share that feeling and understanding with you now.

Especially when it comes to independent, unique, one-of-a-kind places -- would you really want your favorite local flavor to disappear because a yelper or two didn't like a particular server's muffintop or tone of voice?

With that in mind, I must humbly take on a review Update that 's weighed heavily on my soul for some time.

Several months after my initial review of Steakenburger, I received a note from the owner, Tom.  He sent a personal message instead of a public comment, and did NOT at all make the mistake some proprietors do by responding in an angry or condescending tone to my critiques.  Instead I found the response to be brimming with *CLASS*.

I received a sincere and heartfelt letter apologizing for my experience and asking a chance for redemption.  If you read below, you can see that they took the review and steps to address its criticisms VERY SERIOUSLY.

I would like to invite all Yelpers to remember to give second chances and update their reviews often, even the bad ones, whenever appropriate to do so.  
Sometimes things go wrong that are outside of the biz's control.
Sometimes a rogue server is having a pissy day and takes it out on you.
Sometimes they just make a mistake.

We all do.  And we always want another chance, don't we?  Ask us and we'll tell you we DESERVE it, too.   

-----------------------------------------------------------------
"Ryan C-
My name is Tom Philp, owner of SteakenBurger.

First, I am bummed about your bad experience.  With that said, I truly appreciate your candid feedback.  I cringe every time I re-read your experience (which is often), but I believe your review has made us a better restaurant.

While we are still hiring from the human race, and will make mistakes, I'd like to believe that we listen to our critics and respond with systemic adjustments to prevent future similar occurrences.

I have waited some time to respond to insure that I felt comfortable that we had improved our processes and consistency.  

I'd like to invite you back for a do-over ....
I've read all of your reviews and know that I could get skewered again if we fail you, but also feel that we would get a favorable review IF (and only IF) it is warranted.  At the risk of your wrath, I invite you back. 

Thank you for your consideration of this invitation.

Tom & Judie Philp
SteakenBurger"
---------------------------------------------------

The folks at Steakenburger are a class act, and I wish them great luck in their tough business endeavors.

Steakenburger earned their redemption, and they highly DESERVE it! 

I went back for the food, becasue it is unique and fresh and tasty.  
The Steakenburger was a delicious meat-pile, cooked to ideal doneness, and yet still juicy without feeling greasy.  
The homecut fries seem to be double fried now, or something, becasue they had a crisp outside while retaining a potatoey mushiness inside -- perfectly cut thick with the skins on.  Homecut fries are hard to crisp up, and they've done a wonderful job with this recipe.  

There are ten different flavors of wings (let's see if I can remember them: mild, med, hot, suicide, zombie (?!?), bbq, honey bbq, honey hot, habanero, damn i fell short!) and there is even a neat challenge to eat a certain number of habanero wings within an hour and get your picture on the wall of fame.  
I'm sure Adam Richman has this one on his radar allready for a future MvF.  Steakenburger is way more deserving than some of the junk that's been on DDD, too (Chino Bandido, blech)

In summary: GO TO STEAKENBURGER !

I always make a point to inquire as to what people do for Christmas dinner. This is easily mistaken as an interest in learning and understanding other cultures, when in reality I'm just looking for a scapegoat. 

Just once, when someone screams "YOU EAT CHEF BOYARDEE FOR CHRISTMAS!?" at me, I'd like to be able to say "oh yeah...well [insert your name] eats [insert something like but not necessarily puppy tails and applesauce]!"

For like, a long time, my family have made hand-made ravioli for Christmas. It's a long and laborious process that takes up the better part of a Sunday afternoon. So naturally that's when I decided to pick up a gift certificate for someone from Tammie Coe.

We're almost knuckle deep in flour and grated cheese when I call to see when they close. 

The ravioli was going to take us 2-3 hours to finish. 

And guess how much longer Tammie Coe was open? That's right, 2-3 hours.

The smell of dough still fresh on my threads, Misty S and I jetted (or should I say "jetta'd"...fuck you) to central phoenix to pick up the gift certificate before the dogs realized they preferred raw dough to dog food. 

Now, I had been to Tammie Coe quite a few times,  usually in tow with Amanda B. Since layers of delicious frosting tend to clash with layers of expensive makeup, I usually opt out of eating any of their tasty treats. I simply sip on a peach tea and pretend I'm not starving for some fucking cake.

But there we were, on a Sunday morning, dressed in our pajamas, having missed breakfast and looking forward to three hours of pasta-making.

Misty S said looking at all the food made her hungry.

Well, yeah.

Saying that Tammie Coe doesn't make you hungry is like saying Bandaids doesn't bring you deep, deep shame.

So along with the gift certificate we got two chicken salad sliders, a peach tea, iced chai, and one of those giant chocolate chip cookies I like to call "diabetes frisbees".

The sliders were all kinds of delicious. Even my veg-leaning squeeze thought so. And considering the prices at other places in the area, you're not going to beat a $2 sandwich. Unless you rob the place.

Would a yelp review count as evidence in court? 

"Your honor, I present to you Exhibit Y, where the defendant  writes 'and as I walked out of the restaurant, money in hand, the cowering hostess muttered to me 'thank you for coming, have a nice day'. Three stars for outstanding hospitality." 

The peach tea was, as expected, great. I almost wish someone would find a way to fuck up peach tea so I could judge how good all this tea I've been drinking really is. The few sips I had of Misty's iced chai latte were above and beyond Starbucks quality. 

But then again, what isn't?

The last place we went to before leaving Vegas was First... and yes, we ended up saving the best for last! If you want to be a complete glutton, and get the most bang for your buck, you must put First on your list of restaurants to hit up in Vegas.

It's only been open for about two months, so we actually just stumbled upon it while we were on our way out of The Shoppes at Palazzo. We were drawn in by the really cool space, and their touch screen menu outside posted extremely appealing inexpensive gourmet comfort food options. Once inside, we got seated at one of the large booths looking out onto the Strip, so we had a perfect view of the pirate show across the street at TI. 

Instead of plain old bread, we were brought pretzels that came with three dipping sauces. If you want, they offer a $5 cheese fondue to go with it. Our server, Carolyn, was awesome, and gave us recommendations on the food and drinks. We decided to start off with the Mojito Lamb Chops which were topped with Mint glaze, 151 and lime and torched at the table. We were impressed with the three thick cuts, and they were perfectly medium-rare. For entrees, I had the wide papardelle pasta with a heaping portion of forest mushrooms in a delicious truffle butter sauce. My guy had the Sesame Miso Glazed Salmon topped with seaweed salad on a bed of sticky rice, which was fantastic. The presentation was beautiful and the salmon was nice and flaky. For dessert, we indulged in the chocolate bar (which tasted like a 100 Grand as an ice cream bar) and the donut sundae... mmm... donut. 

For cocktails, I highly recommend the Cotton Candy Kiss (Grey Goose, elderflower, vanilla, pineapple, cranberry), especially if you're a sweet tooth. It's such a pretty cocktail, and even the presentation is lovely! The martini glass is rimmed with crushed Life Savers and comes with a blue fluff of cotton candy. The liquor is poured over it when it's brought to the table. 

The awesome thing is that they are open late, and I mean really late. They have a special late night menu from 1am-4am Sun-Wed and 1am-6am Th-Sat.

This place would be amazing in the Mission in SF -- foodie hipsters would flock here... I hope they open one up there!!

So long Pink's, hello The Wiener's Circle! I was sad to see Pink's go, but the location was never going to work with the jacked up prices and confusion with the names they gave the hot dogs compared to what they are actually called at the original location in California. So, The Wiener's Circle enters in its spot. Will it last? Time will tell! I must admit, I did watch the TV show they had on a while back and found the games they played with the customers (at night they curse at the customers and play crazy ass games... It's intended, expected to all customers and hilarious) funny. I was surprised they opened up in Vegas, but hey it saved me the trip to Chicago for the moment! The original location in Chicago has been in business for over 30 years.

Looking over the menu board, I was surprised at how fair the prices were. The prices here range from about $2-$3 higher depending on the item compared to the Chicago menu. Being in a casino we can expect higher prices, but they weren't too outrageous. I ordered "Wieners in a Blanket" priced at $4.99 for 6. They are made fresh to order. I had my choice of sauce and chose honey mustard. That honey mustard had a real good flavor and paired nicely with the tasty blanketed wieners. They also come 12 to a order, but the 6 was good enough for me. Priced at $4.99 I also ordered "Cheddar Fries" and wow were they good! The fries are fresh cut and come 1 pound per order. The cheese they put on top was very good! Hubby and I split a "Char Polish" priced at $6.99 and came with mustard, relish, onions, pickle, tomato, celery salt and sport peppers. It was pretty good. Next time I would ask for a lighter char, but a decent hot dog with nice toppings. All the burgers and dogs come with those toppings unless you tell them to leave it off. They are happy to customize your order so just ask! If you are in a pinch for time you can phone your order ahead and just pick it up. Aside from lunch and dinner they also serve breakfast and offer Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

It's hard to look at life the same way after you've stayed at the Skylofts. We're talking about two story lofts, unbelievably luxurious amenities, just gorgeous designs at every corner, and being able to get anything you want or need with just one phone call.

Everyone here leaves a 5 star review because it's true, the Skylofts give you a true 5 star feeling. At $10,000 a night, it better! Now, keep in mind, I didn't pay that fee. I simply know somebody who gets sponsored by MGM Grand and he extended his generosity to me. Some reviewers claim the Skylofts are worth every penny. Well, even my friend would say that if he had to pay the full fee, it would NOT be worth every penny. If you could have an incredible double suite at Caesar's Palace for $800, who wouldn't do that instead of spending 10 grand?

Like most people who dine at The French Laundry, post the picture of their bill in a very braggadocious manner, and claim it's worth every penny, they usually don't genuinely mean it. Instead, what they're really saying is, "This was insanely expensive and very possibly overpriced. In an attempt to make myself feel better, I will act as if I paid for this comfortably and without a shred of regret, as if my experience was so moving that I would do this as often as financially possible. Here, please act as if you care about this picture of the tab any more than I would care if you posted one. Envy me. Please, envy me. It'll give me the validation I need." 

Now, before I sound too cynical, I should note that I don't mind people who live flashy lives, so long as they earned their possessions from their own work. Hey, if that's what makes you happy, I'm happy. Just try not to unnecessarily rub it in my face. Now, I'll reiterate that there's so much to love at the Skylofts. We're talking private elevators, pool tables, movie rooms, the best personal service, access to private restaurants, and anything you'd expect if you were part of the 1%. There's a reason I got disillusioned and materialistic from Vegas. And, quite surprisingly, the Skylofts was not a huge part of that. It was more from the food destinations, the overall treatment, and the carefree spending of money that left a real impression. In other words, it was the people I was with and their behaviors that impacted me the most, not a physical place. Would I pay $10,000 a night for a Skyloft? Hell no. But was it one of the best experiences of my life? Hell yes. 

To having great friends. And hopefully enjoying life's great experiences without getting too ripped off. After all, I still want to dine at The French Laundry. But I doubt I'll pay for the preposterous $150 corkage fee.

I am not a "pretty man"...no I'm really not...stop it...you're making me blush! :-)

Really, even though The Beautiful Carin tells me that I'm "adorable", I am really more of a "regular joe"...a (youngish) middle aged "everyman".

I am reminded of this fact each and every time I stroll in to AZ 88:)

There are, indeed, tons of pretty people at AZ 88...lounging, laughing, lingering, loitering, lolling, loving and probably even lusting:)

For 20 years (although I've only been here for about 5 of those years) AZ 88 has been one of the "see and be seen" places in Scottsdale.

And it shows in the clientele...but they let me in anyway:)

It's been a good spot for the Beautiful Carin and I to grab a pre-function cocktail, a relatively cheap burger or sandwich (and a giant martini) or a post-function nightcap.

Besides the fact the fact that it's right in my neighborhood, there are several reasons that Carin and I have become fond of this place over the years:)

* The food really is pretty good...the burgers, sandwiches, salads and appetizers are generously sized and the waffle fries hit the sweet spot in the crusty/greasy axis of arterial obstruction (I was going to attach the graph I created but Yelp doesn't play that way:)

* The food really is pretty inexpensive...I was going to say cheap, but really...it's not cheap, cheap...just inexpensive compared to some of the other places around the neighborhood :)

* The drinks are better than pretty good:) I was thinking that they are expensive, but then I looked at the size of these things and the price to buzz ratio becomes a terrific value (again, I was going to attach a very compelling chart that I've created, but no attachment feature for  spreadsheets and charts! :-)

* The atmosphere is relaxed and relaxing, but fun and upbeat...does that make sense? It does to me after a couple of AZ 88 Ketel One martini's:) Two of those big ass marti's are like a six pack of marti's from Dick's Hideaway...for a lot less dough:) I'm glad I can walk here and back home:)

* There is always something "happening" at AZ 88...at Christmas, the martini glass Christmas Tree...witticisms' painted on the walls, power couples attempting to couple in the unisex loo, music and laughter...what more could you want?:)

* Which brings me to the final bullet point of my AZ 88 presentation...the people watching...AZ 88 is like the headwaters of the mighty Columbia River...except that here we have Scottsdale's beautiful people and there we have Chinook salmon...but, respectively, these places are where they go to spawn:) AZ 88 might not be such a blatant meet up spot as someplace like Cream, Dirty Pretty or the W, but for easy conversation, strong drinks and reasonable food, AZ 88 still pretty much leads the pack (again, I put together a trending bar chart that clearly illustrates my point, but I couldn't attach it...oh well if you want the charts and spreadsheets, let me know and I can email them to you:)

Pick a nice evening, wander through the park and end up on the deck at AZ 88...that's what we do every couple of months.

Enjoy watching people strolling through the park, the cocktails, a chicken sandwich and waffle fries and watch all the mating rituals going on around you...some people might call this decadent and dissolute, but I call it "Thursday Evening":)

A very good friend told me about this Irish pub not too long ago, and since then this family-operated establishment has been one of my go-to destinations for live music and Irish cuisine. The atmosphere is dim lit, bustling, and equipped with several TVs for local sports fans here and there. The dcor starts with an open patio, and a horseshoe bar surrounded by a score of booths and tables. Last Friday the Sullivan's were on hand to provide the live music that rocked the house.

The Jinky's Famous Chicken Wings ($8.99) arrived with ten sizable drumettes and they were spicy delicious. The meat was a tad on the dry side, and I wished there were a number of actual wings that could appear on the plate. On the other hand, the explosive flavor was quite striking, addictive, and good to share. This is a good dish to order during game day.

Their Corned Beef and Cabbage ($11.99) came with prime pieces of corned beef, boiled cabbage, potatoes, carrots, horseradish sauce, and mustard. The thick cuts of corned beef was a tad chewy, but there was plenty of flavor to go with the creamy horseradish and pointed mustard seeds. The cabbage and potatoes were sensational. Portions were generous and good for two meals. This is one dish that I would recommend.

The Grilled Basa ($9.95) came with a strip of perfectly buttery blackened basa. The fish was tender, flavorful, and had great moisture so it was easy to fork into. This dish also came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes nicely whipped with a mix of potato skin here and there. Fia thought the fish was a tad too salty, but we both really liked the mashed potatoes. 

Service was friendly, efficient, and fast. My drink was not refilled the first time, but service was much improved during my latest visit. The atmosphere really picked up once the Sullivan's came on stage. Eventually it got a bit too loud and hard to chat across the table. A cool spot to catch a game and enjoy their live music. I would be interested in coming back to try their Fish 'n Chips and Irish Whiskey Bread Pudding.

The buffet at the Wynn didn't excite me as much as I wanted.  I went there for lunch after reading the list of food selections posted on a sign at the entrance.  Everything seemed to sound better than it tasted, and nothing really stood out as spectacular or memorable.

I started out pretty lightly taking just three items (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=5jI7M5Be86FJFVm9Aeis-g), and I only enjoyed one.  That's approximately what I experienced throughout the meal, for every one item I liked there were always two that I didn't like.  The Kobe beef slider looked great, but the patty was ice cold when I bit into it.  The potstickers had big chunks of inedible pork fat.  The roasted strip loin was very good.  The slice I had was slightly overcooked for my preference, but it was tender, juicy and had good beef flavor.

The beef flank steak was also good.  Sliced thick with a sweet marinade, most of the cuts were overcooked by sitting under the heat lamp, but it had good flavor.  I love fish, but the fish here was awful.  The sea bass was not fresh and crumbled instead of flaked.  The grilled salmon was only partially cooked as I could see and taste the frozen core within.  The red snapper tasted bland.

I did find a pasta dish to my liking.  The Pappadella had flat noodles in a creamy tomato sauce and was laden with big chunks of shrimp.  On the other hand the lump crab mac 'n' cheese was creamy and cheesy but what little crab meat was already picked off.  The pizza tasted like crap I can buy at Sbarro and the sushi simply isn't worth mentioning.  I tried more than half of what was offered, and when nothing really wowed me I moved along to the desserts.

The decadent Oreo Mousse Cake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=-fSEZvHdYCxfipPsAjtONg) was very chocolately, very rich and very sweet even for my chocoholic taste.  I love mint and I tried the Mint Chocolate Mousse (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=xtPuLkTf4GfltHy12Mpsow).  The mint mousse was thick and gummy, but the bottom layer of chocolate cake was very moist.  It was very much like eating toothpaste on top of chocolate cake!

The Blueberry Tart (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=9cExiCHnu3lfOCwVZwt7EQ) was good.  It was very light and not too sweet with a citrus mousse on top of thin shortbread and a light film of blueberry jam in between.  I liked the Tapioca Pearl Mousse with Mango and Lychee (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=9cnd5txt44wiE2US_S8oUw) also.  Soft mini tapioca balls are folded into a light mousse and layered over a mango flavored gelatin with a strip of lychee fruit inside.  I liked the Lime Mousse with Raspberry Gelle (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=wPy6KDF48APMGm3faAecJw) also, but more so because it was tart.  There is a small piece of sponge cake sandwiched in between the tart lime mousse and the sour raspberry gelatin.

If the only differences between lunch and dinner are the price and the frozen crab legs I think I'll pass on The Buffet at The Wynn.

After two visits in the last six months, I remain totally unaware of their a la carte offerings.  It's like a small bolt of electricity triggers my brain to point at the picture of the AYCE deal (now $25) and tell the server in what feels like slow motion to say "I'll......have......this.".  This incurable auto reaction would even prompt me to order AYCE KBBQ if I saw it on Denny's menu. 

With quite a few popular restaurants in this plaza now, Jin Mee feels like a forgotten place.  The space is big and looks like it could easily fit a crowd of 100+.  I wonder if those banquet tables to the rear of the restaurant ever get used anymore. 

It doesn't take a lot for me to enjoy spots like this.  As long as there's pork belly, bulgogi, the other usual offerings and they are of reasonable freshness, I am a happy man.  But there are a few things that make this place a standout.  My wife loooooves the spicy marinated raw crab.  I am not sure if anywhere else offers this but it's pretty awesome.  You gotta get all barbaric with it and just break the shells in your mouth to get those glorious slithers of spicy crab. 

Then they bring out a ton of other dishes before the meat comes out.  You get a large plate of salad, a bowl of steamed egg, a hearty tofu soup with beans and potato, and then 8 dishes of banchan.  A very impressive Korean feast indeed!!  I look at it all as a clever trap.  If customers stuff their faces with this, they'll eat less meat.  Everything I mentioned above probably costs them less than $4 in ingredients.  All tasty and worth sampling for sure, but keep your eyes on the prize!  Kind of like the salad bar at Texas de Brazil.  Trap!!!!

The owner, Chu, was there during my last visit.  He said he was a good golfer and gave me his card saying we should golf sometime.  I hit my friend with a golf ball in the leg after a ridiculous slice 30 feet away the last time I golfed and dutifully informed Chu of this.  He decided to quickly change the subject by offering some grilled shrimp on the house.  That's only on the more expensive AYCE package that includes choices of several kinds of seafood and ribeye.  The shrimp were delicious and unusually sweet.  Nice guy.

The table grills were decently ventilated meaning I wasn't wearing full on BBQ cologne afterwards.  I am a fan!

A new Ross yay! This makes me one happy girl :)

If you have been to Ross before then you wont find too much different about this one. They still claim to offer 20% - 60% off department store prices and and by what I saw they are doing just that. The fact that some find the brand name goods here "so last season" means nothing to me as long as the quality is good, I like it, the price is right and it's cute! I love that I can get such good quality items for less. 

The bedding area is a good friend of mine. If I want new sheets or pillows I always buy them at Ross. I picked up some sheets yesterday for $29.99 that retailed for over $100! I have bought this brand before in 2 others colors and love them so I was glad to come across them again. That is one thing about Ross, you might find something you love and go back and it's gone, or you go to another location and they have a completely different selection. 

The shoes are my favorite part about Ross! I can find shoes for every occasion at such great prices here! From flip-flops to high heels they have the cutest selection. It doesn't hurt that right now is "shoe week" so they were all marked down even more.

If you are looking for a new handbag or wallet then check here before heading anywhere else. I for years have bought my handbags and wallets from Ross and I feel much better about buying the same brand name handbag here over buying it at a major department store and paying more. They have a great selection at this location and even had the newer style of the one handbags I currently use so I snatched that baby up!

You will also find a good selection of women, men, kids and baby clothes. The one thing to keep an eye out for is clothes that might be ripped or stained. I find a lot of cute clothes I pick out might have a rip or odd color on it so I pay extra attention to make sure what I am buying looks new and good quality. 

You can also shop for stuff for the kitchen, jewelry, home decor etc. They have some really adorable kitchen decor. Gift cards are available in any amount between $10 - $250 and you can purchase them at the store or customize your own on their website. I will be here a lot!

I wish I could give this place 6-stars. I even changed my last meal on earth in my profile to Bacchanal Buffet- it was that good.

Weekends are WAY more expensive because of brunch. We had a little mishap when we called and asked for prices and were given the wrong information. When we told the cashier that- she said that we should have called the buffet and not the hotel. WTF- you work there, right?

Anyways- it was off-season in Vegas, so we only waited about 10-minutes before being seated. Because it was brunch, mimosas were complimentary and we were going to get our money's worth. We 

I seriously could list out all the food that I ate, but that would be a super, super long review. If you want to know- you can see the photos I posted while here. Everything was scrumptious!

A couple of standouts:
- Beef brisket: It was smokey, tender and came in a big slab on your plate. You could break apart the meat with your fork with little effort. This one of my favorite things.

- Eggs Benedict with skirt steak: A small individual portion served in a cast iron skillet. The egg yolk was calling my name from across the restaurant. I ate two without any effort, but had to contain myself before going back for a third. They also have this same dish with fried chicken instead. I wanted beef. The meat is tender and has that nice grilled flavor. Break the egg and it's like a slop of heaven soaking into your bottom piece of English muffin.

Quail egg flatbread: This came lathered with small little over-medium eggs and bacon. The outer crust was crispy and you heard that crunch when you broke it apart or took a bite. It definitely had that wood-brick oven taste, though, I'm not sure how it was cooked. 

I am just going to say that you HAVE to eat here at least once. Like a tourist destination, you should make it a PRIORITY. Screw the bodies exhibit, screw the Grand Canyon- you need to go to Caesar's Palace for their Bacchanal Buffet. It's seriously worth it.

Cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap. And no, I don't mean great value. I mean it's obvious how many corners they cut with this place. I love the sls in BH and this place feels like a budget motel in comparison. 

We paid an extra 70 bucks to upgrade to a "lux corner suite" what we got was a cheaply decorated room with a super hard mattress, thin sandpaper sheets, cheap thin sandpaper duvet. The ac is crazy loud. The view is of a back service area. Curtains don't keep light out. No bath tub. And this is not a suite.... It's just a regular king bed. Using French themed printed curtains as wallpaper and dividers does not make the room cool. It makes it look like they cut corners, which, oh yeah... It's obvious. This is probably by far the worst "luxury" hotel I've stayed in. Ever. 

Not to mention, right when we checked in the room was not even cleaned! It took over half an hour of trying to get a hold of someone via phone and then going down to the lobby before the housekeeper we were able to flag down just felt bad for us and cleaned up right away. No, we were never able to get a hold of anyone to make a complaint. 

The finish and quality of this hotel just isn't there and neither is the service. Take your business elsewhere. You will be disappointed. Our friends warned us already, but given that I love the sls BH, I wanted to try it out anyway. Boo. Guess they "already told me so."


Update: yea I wrote this prior to check out. But here comes the sweet cherry on top of an already crappy experience. So while we were waiting for the room we had nowhere to go... Decided to grab two beers at the bar downstairs. Total, $17. We charged it to the room. Upon check out we noticed that they charged us $19 on top of the $17 beer charge as "gratuity".. Really? For that crappy service? Get real. Then they tried to sneak on another room charge and double charge us for the one night. Wow. And no offer to waive any fees or anything for our entire crappy experience which I did finally unload onto the front desk agent. Just dropped another star. Definitely by far the worst Vegas experience ever. Zero customer service or appreciation. Won't even be patronizing the BH location anymore.

Even asked for late check out but decided I really couldn't blow the joint quick enough. It was just too unrelaxing and flustering.

I have had this place bookmarked for a while and am glad we finally tried it. I felt like deep dish pizza and heard that North End puts out a good one. Walking inside we were greeted and told to sit anywhere. Looking around there were many pictures on the wall of movie posters and different sporting events as well family history of the owner and her family. A lot of Boston decor! The owner, Claudia, was there at a table not only eating, but saying hello to each customer and making sure they were enjoying their food. Claudia has her dad make the pizza dough at his restaurant in Boston, and then ships it to Las Vegas for use here at North End Pizza. Her mom makes the pizza sauce locally from her secret recipe.  

We started out with an order of "Garlic Knots" priced at $6.50 for an order of 12 knots and sauce. These weren't traditional since they were *not* in a *knot*, but more a disc if flavorless dough. With all of the seasoning on them, I didn't get it and would not order them again, knowing where I can get authentic ones at other restaurants in town. 

For the main course I ordered a "1/2 Ricotta & Garlic 1/2 Sausage Pizza" priced at  $22.99 including toppings. I ordered the Sicilian, which requires an hour for prep/bake time. If you know you want this then you can just call ahead and have them start it for you. The Sicilian only comes in 16 inch size. I really enjoyed this pizza! I tasted nothing but garlic on my half so I don't know where the garlic flavor was on the knots? The pizza dough was nice and thick and cooked thoroughly. We had more then enough left to take home for another meal! I want to come back and try their thin crust pizza next.

You can come in and buy pizza by the slice or try out some of their calzones, pasta, salads, sandwiches or appetizers. North End offers delivery/dine-in/carryout.

And now ladies and gentlemen... the single worst establishment I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. Heart Attack Grill has ZERO redeeming qualities. There is not a single reason for me to even get close to giving this place anything more than one star. This is one place that makes me wish Yelp would allow a zero or negative star rating. 

Now, to preface this review... I'm not an idiot... I know that this place is "The Heart Attack Grill" so I went in prepared for greasy and unhealthy food but hoped it'd be fun and even though unhealthy, maybe taste alright. Whoa, was I ever wrong to hope for that. They group their burgers by how many patties there are... starting out with the Single Bypass burger (one pattie) and going up to the Quadruple Bypass burger (four patties). Being a little more on the conservative end, I went with the Single Bypass burger and a side order of fries. My Dad came along for the fun and he got the same... for the purposes of this review I should tell you that my Dad is a machine, he can eat... and he doesn't mind a little grease. 

Right as they bring our food out, I immediately get intimidated. The patty of the burger was dripping with fat and the meat used was such low quality (extremely high fat/meat ratio) that the patty didn't even appear to be beef... it had this whitish tint to it that you'd have to see to believe. I've never seen such an unhealthy piece of beef in my life... it doesn't help that they cook it in pure lard either. This was beyond unhealthy, it was disgusting. I feel like if you're making something blatantly unhealthy there should at least be a method to the madness; there should be some attempt at wanting to make it actually taste good (it is food by the way). It just seemed like they were pushing the grease and lard to the absolute maximum just to see how far they can take it. Well I'm not impressed... I took one bite and was instantly grossed out, I actually almost threw up it was so bad. My Dad who can hang with the best of 'em was able to stomach about three bites until he could no longer continue. The second we left the place I turned to my Dad and said "that's the worst single piece of food I've ever put in my mouth". I'm not exaggerating when I say that I'd rather eat a dried up piece of dog shit between two buns than a Heart Attack Grill burger. 

The only thing worse than the food is the tacky and over the top waitresses. They wander around in little nurses outfits often times with their underwear quite visible, and their whole bar area has a slanted mirror to actually encourage you to look up their skirts. That'd be fine and all, except I didn't want to look up these skirts. If you're going to have your wait staff dress sexy, you better make sure they're worth looking at in the first place. These girls were a little rough around the edges... most of them had that 'ex-stripper' look; and I could have sworn that one of them had bullet wounds on her stomach... that's not a joke.

P.S. I actually dry heaved while writing this review just thinking about my fat drenched burger. 

DO NOT GO HERE.

If their Shanghai Xiao Long Bao  is the only item on their menu, I would still be dropping by this latest Chinese restaurant to open up in Las Vegas's greater Chinatown area. Now before you all go crazy and question why it is only getting 4 and not 5 stars on Yelp, let me explain.

It is good, not the best I've ever had, but I enjoyed it. In fact, after my unplanned XLB crawl of the 2 newest restaurants that serve it to open up on the west side, I can say A & K Chinese Restaurant (aka Heng Long Chinese Restaurant, if going by their name on the credit card receipt) was the clear winner of the head-to-head XLB CHALLENGE over Edamame Restaurant on Wednesday, May 7th, 2014.  

You don't have to take my word for it though. What I think is "good" could be "that is the worst, flavorless blah blah I have ever had!"  (Funny random thought: what if water is being judged right now?)

Anyway, seems like we are blessed with more and more XLB options in Las Vegas, which means to make it, the chefs all have to up their games. Translation: consumers are the winner. Yay!

I also had their Three Treasures Dumpling  (12pcs) per order and it was pretty good too. The fact they hand make these is just wonderful.

On my first visit I also tried their Pan Fried Pork Bun  (8 pcs) $7.95. If you go by yourself, this item alone will be enough to send you home with a full belly. It was just okay, the doughy bun on the outside is thinker than what I have had in Taiwan (which was THE BEST  at that busy night market), so maybe not fair comparison.

Beef Pancake Roll  $7.95. Decent. There are better ones I have had within a 2 mile radius.

Hot Purple Sweet Potato Juice , small $2.25. It was an experience to try this. It is basically purple sweet potato drink, not really sweet, but a creamy dessert alternative beverage.

Service overall was good.  I happened to have been there when they were not busy, so that might have helped too. Plus I can speak enough Mandarin Chinese to get by in restaurants, so that certainly helped.

Decor/Ambiance was pleasant. Music playing in the background was not Chinese, but instrumentals of popular American songs, which you probably wouldn't even pay attention to unless you focus on it.

Price/Value: I think it was good overall. 

Note: this is NOT your typical Chinese takeout restaurants. I must admit I am not familiar with most of their menu offerings, because I am not at all an expert on Shanghainese cuisine. But they also described their cuisine as  (New style of Jiangsu and Zhejiang - per Google Translate, which is still like Hexcodes to me). But come for their XLB, and if you are adventurous enough, you can explore their other menu items.

Expect an UYE for Xiao Long Bao  crawl and another one to just explore this restaurant's menu (yeah, I am definitely gonna need backup).

Bonus: Love that American Express is accepted along with other forms of credit card payments.  :)

The beautiful Carin and I went to the Village this morning for our respective workouts...She hit the cardio machines hard and I played squash with my buddies.

As I finished my last game with one of my buddies, Jim (who happens to be a cardiologist), he mentioned that I looked a little emaciated...peaked even, and prescribed chicken and waffles, "stat" (stat is a medical term that means "with extra butter, syrup and a side of grits":)

Fortunately for me there is a new emergency location for Lolo's that has opened up altogether too close to my home:)

Serendipity started to smile on me when we pulled up just as someone was leaving and we scored the parking spot right in front...serendipity continued as we put our name in for the 30 minute wait, only to be called after 15 minutes...and continued to weave it's way through the entire meal, as we got our drinks right away (really, is there much of anything better than a 1/2 gallon of sweet tea with your Saturday afternoon brunch?:), and we were waited on promptly and served right away.

I was saved from wasting away:)

I was particularly delighted for 2 reasons:

     - This was only their second day open in Scottsdale and they were   absolutely slammed with both people eating at Lolo's and with take out orders, so it looked like the service was a little uneven...but the Lolo's staff were so darn nice to everyone, most of the customers seemed  to be pretty understanding:)

     - This was Carin's first experience with Lolo's, and like all of her other "first times" with me, I wanted it to be both "special" and "delightful"...I am a loving, thoughtful and caring husband:)

We couldn't have asked for it to go any better, especially for going by so soon after they opened:)

The chicken and waffles are every bit as good as the original location down on Yuma:)...Carin has fallen in love with Lolo's, too:)

The decor in the new place is pleasant...welcoming and comfortable...I love the wash tub lighting treatments:)

And the staff continues to be pleasant (trending toward sweet as pie) to everyone...they could have been pretty tight-faced today, because they really did have a ton of people (all looking to get their chicken and waffle on) come by Lolo's today.

I wasn't expecting to give these guys 5 stars right out of the gate, but doggone it, they earned it!

Great food, great atmosphere, nice people and now, right in the hood:)

I wonder if Jim is going to send me a bill for the medical advice? :-)

After finding out it would be a 2 hour wait at Gordon Ramday BurGR, we decided to hang out inside YOLOS (they had no wait) for drinks and appetizers. I was first impressed by the large, long booth we were sat at. That quickly changed when the people at our table kept kicking each other. There was no room under the table for us to sit comfortably. Our server was quick to take our drink order and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. 

We ordered a "Quesadilla" priced at $10 and "Empanadas" priced at $10 for our snackage. The quesadilla had jack cheese, onions and peppers inside. It also came with a side of salsa, sour cream and guacamole. The quesadilla was good, but average. If you want beef, chicken or shrimp in it then it will cost you $4-$5 more. The empanadas were well liked by hubby and I. They were stuffed with chorizo and had a green chile avocado salsa underneath them. The only complaint I have about that dish is the size of it. They put enough of the green chile avocado salsa on the plate so why not add just 1 more empanada to make it an even 4? If this were a cocktail party I could understand the small bites and portions, but this wasn't the case. With 4 people at our table it was awkward so hubby and I just ended up splitting one of them. The margarita did taste decent! 

They have lunch specials during the week that right now start at $9.95 and a Happy Hour at the bar as well. Also beware about the music inside this place. it's very loud and it's hard to have a conversation with the people sitting right at your table.

"Bonjour, mon ami.  Lardons, si vous plait"

Located conveniently by the hotel elevators at the Paris Las Vegas hotel, Le Cafe Ile St. Louis offers French American cuisine, specializing in breakfast/brunch.  A cute facade makes diners feel they are in city of lights, with dining inside or "al fresco", which in this case means overlooking the casino floor.  I chose to sit "al fresco" both times I dined here, as it gave ample opportunity to people watch, both those gambling & those walking by, and to enjoy the filtered casino air.  I assumed seating inside would be rather stuffy.

As previously mentioned, I dined at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis on two occasions, for dinner then for breakfast the next day.  Here's the 411-

Dinner - There was very little wait & was quickly led to a table.  While waiting for my order to arrive, crusty bread & butter were placed on our table-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ
By crusty, I mean crusty.  The outer layer of bread was as crusty as my tidy whities after my first wet dream.  Yes, that crusty!  Inside, though, was airy & soft.  The butter was crack to me.  I asked for another helping of it, as I was liberally dousing each piece of bread w/ butter.  I even helped myself to spoonfuls applied directly to mouth, w/o the interference of bread.

Calamari - Fried squid w/ crispy onions, fennel, lemon & a dijon mustard vinaigrette $12-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#kVwRy-qO3v8PJYyLn5u9aw
This was delicious.  Generous portions, fried crisp & light with a captivating vinaigrette.  I asked for more of said vinaigrette because I was bathing each piece of calamari and/or onion with it.  

Burger and foie gras - Angus beef, pate de foie gras, caramelized apples, balsamic gastrique on a brioche bun w/ pomme frites $18-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#MeXfEou-G1FANcmYRGUT5w
Tres bien!  What sold it for me was the foie gras, a food item that was recently banned for sale in California.  It's like meat butter.  I delighted in the medium-rare goodness-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#b40GDQLSlIUeiYa7GWeWQw
The pomme frites (french fries) were, sadly, soggy & limp.  I guess they spent too much time w/ the Paris go-go dancer the previous night ;p She sure knew how to twerk it, so I don't blame the fries for being limp LOL

Creme brulee $8 - 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#I2QqmkDyFQxm4iGwkx9Y_A
Ahhh, the crispy sugar shell forming a roof over the thick creme underneath.  This was magnifique!  I savored each & every bite, delighting in the burnt flavoring of the sugary shell.

Breakfast - There was about a 5 min wait, so it wasn't long before being seated "al fresco".  Complimentary toasted bread of choice was provided.  I chose sourdough & extra of that fantastic butter.  

Corned beef hash w/ two poached eggs $15 -
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#Lbn2VWRXcYHOWnJDlIpQ2A
Hearty, rich, stick to your ribs good!  I relished each & every bite, as the runny egg yolks slithered down the hash, making for a delectable meal.  Quality portions, worth the $15.

Cafe latte $5 - This could French kiss my derriere.  Weak coffee in a small cup.  I thought the Europeans were known for how strong they like their coffee.  This was more like Folgers.  The Gevalia I brew at home is leaps & bounds better than this drivel.

Service was good, as extra butter was brought out & drinks were refilled.  Seating is plentiful throughout, w/ my recommendation of dining "al fresco".

I enjoyed my 2 dining experiences here at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis.  It's Vegas, so the prices can be a little high for what you get, but I mostly enjoyed the food I had the pleasure of eating here.  Plus, the convenience of having the restaurant located right outside the hotel elevators make stopping here a breeze.

Recommend!

Au revoir!

Me:  "Fatburger?  Never heard of them!"
One of my friends suggested, "I hear they're pretty good."
We decided to try it.

Both my friends and I agreed.  This might be a good burger if you're drunk, but it was pretty bad while sober.  While my friends ordered their own combinations I went with the medium Fatburger deal omitting cheese and onions on my burger and choosing the fat fries over the skinny fries.

Although this place looks and operates very much like a fast food place it is not.  The burgers are cooked to order so definitely expect a wait for your food order to be called.  If you order a soft drink it's self serve.  That part I liked about Fatburger because I can control how little ice and how much soft drink actually goes into the cup.

However, back to the burger.  My number was called and a worker delivered the burger tray to me.  The first thing I noticed was how small the burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LtXy1VinKWfuLFslVarKRw?select=2v29rPxqQNAWVXQlLTyqPQ) was compared to how large the portion of steak fries were.  I love thick fries which is why I selected the Fat Fries over the skinny ones.  These were a huge disappointment even though they were nice and meaty and fried to a perfect golden yellow color.  The fault was in the oil which tasted old, and because of that the fries didn't taste fresh.  You'd be surprised how big a difference there is just by changing the oil in a fryer.

The burger was not good either.  The burger patty was so overcooked no moisture existed within the meat.  I might have been happy had there even been a glistening of grease within, but nope, chewing cardboard is probably the best comparison.  The shredded lettuce while crisp had the odd taste of being stored in a refrigeration unit badly in need of a box of baking soda.  I don't mind that they use pickle relish instead of pickle slices but even that tasted old.  It's kind of like when you go to Costco and stock up on too much of something and store it until the taste begins to waver.  The pickle relish did not have a fresh snappy taste to it.  The only ingredients which tasted fresh were the tomato slice, the bun and the mustard.

At the least the service was good and the workers are friendly.  I can honestly say I won't be back at a Fatburger restaurant anytime in the foreseeable future.

I had three thoughts running through my head as my wife and I were walking out.

1. Outfuckingstanding!!
2. I am having this, this and this next time.
3. We better come back soon because popularity is inevitable and I am going to dread when I'll have to wait 30+ minutes for a table.  I'll do it though.  

Eating at the bar was great since we were able to chat with Woosuk aka Ryan aka the owner throughout our meal.  He handles everything with Moko except for the cooking.  That's left to Chef Hong who is a goooooodddddaaaamn culinary wizard!!  That guy is a total one man show coming in at 10am daily to prep all their amazing stuff for dinner when doors open at 5pm.    

Just discussing the effort and detail Hong goes into preparing plates like the delectable beef short rib (butchering the beef himself, select bones to cook with to enhance the flavor, 3+ hours of cooking etc) was inspiring.  A well presented dish, the beefy fattiness of the short rib accompanied by crispy garlic, gratin and amazing sauce was heavenly.    Christina Perri's "A Thousand Years" was playing while I savored it all and it seemed very fitting.  

It's not often that an Asian restaurant includes a spoon for their table setting but Ryan is smart enough to know the sauce for not only the short rib but others like their "Black Bean Noodle" will/need/must be scooped up out of the bowl.  It sure looks a lot more elegant than sticking my face into it.  Genius!   

They offer Berkshire pork belly cooked for either 10 or 30(!!!) hours.  Even though the 10 hour belly is tenderer, how could I pass up 20 more hours of cooking for $1 more?  It was like nothing I'd ever had before.  The soybean paste marinade with the kimchi crepe and their homemade black raspberry marinated salt (who does that???) was exceptional. 

The grilled then chilled eggplant salad with micro greens and tomato was refreshing and flavorful.  We also got an order of the fried soy chicken wings which was like modern soul food with the unique breading and honey glaze.  There was absolutely nothing left but bones.  

I entered Moko expecting a decent meal and left having an excellent one.  There's nothing quite like this in Vegas at the moment.  Go go go!!

The Grand Lux Cafe is located in The Venetian Hotel & Casino, Las Vegas. The Venetian for those of you who may not know, is a very beautiful resort. There are beautiful interior features and rooms, a fabulous casino and a lot of places to dine at. There is something for everyone, from high end restaurants to snack bars. To each his own and I'm sure that even the most demanding diner will enjoy one of the restaurants. For me, I love coming to the Grand Lux Cafe because it has an upscale feel to it without the pricey menus. The fare is reasonable for resort dining and it's a very comfy atmosphere. 

I came here for dinner on this particular evening and we were seated promptly. Upon being seated, the waitress took our drink orders, customary green bottle and water with a lemon wedge. A basket with fresh baked bread was also served. Next we proceeded to decide on what appetizer to have. We agreed on this creation called a Double Stuffed Potato Spring Roll. Let me tell you, it's awesome! Imagine a lumpia wrapper with mashed potatoes in it, served halved, crispy with melted cheese and topped with green onions, applewood bacon and a sour cream dipping sauce... I was absolutely in appetizer heaven! Probably not something you can partake in everyday, but a must when you are on vacay and enjoying dining out!  For dinner, I settled on the Ribeye and my dining companion had the Shrimp Scampi served on a bed of Pasta... I ordered the Ribeye medium rare, and that's the way I got it! Now that made me a happy diner. Now, it's not easy to prepare a Ribeye because you can't see it cooking inside, but they do a great job here. I was impressed because it wasn't a thick piece and the thinner they are, the harder they are to prepare. I glanced over at my dining companion and saw that she was happily enjoying her Scampi. There were lot's of generous sized shrimp and the pasta looked delicious! We enjoyed our dinner here and as for dessert, well, there wasn't any room left! Definitely a favorite whenever in Vegas, I shall return next trip!

"Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights"

I know this song is a little old, but I hope you get the picture.  I heard good things from my Vegas promoter friends at Galavantier, but not so good things from a personal friend, so I said WTH!!!  I am always game to check out a new club in Vegas!!!

Light is located towards the rear of the Mandalay Bay Hotel.  I believe there used to be another club here, but I forget the name because I rarely venture away from the strip (Mandalay is pretty far south for me!).  We bypassed GP (general population) via Galavantier (please see my review).  It was well worth the extra $.  We heard peeps wait 3 hours to get in this club.  FTS!!! (F*ck That $hit!!!).

Krewella was playing the Fri night we went, and the standard Cirque du Soleil show was entertaining.  However, not as entertaining as the talent!!!  There were many fine looking ladies that my friend and I would have loved to meet given the opportunity.  We had nearly given up when we met a pair of Azn ladies at the bar.  I don't usually talk to Azn ladies much (primarily because they rarely talk to me, and I had a bad experience recently w/ two Azn ladies:  They were the wrong kinda F's:  Fliar [F*cking Liar] & a Flake [Fulla Lame A$$ Kine Excuses]).  But these Azn ladies were the right kinda F's:   Fwhiiiiine, Friendly & Fun!!!  The one I liked had a shoulder piece tattoo and I complimented her on her artwork.  She asked me if I had any work, so I showed her a pic of my shoulder piece, half sleeve and chest plate.  She liked my work so much that she asked me to open up my buttons to see.  I am not usually an exhibitionist, but we weren't getting any love so I threw caution to the wind and said OK!!!  At this point in time I was waiting for her to tell me she was a pro, and she cost $$$ much, but it never happened.  Turns out these women were the good kind of pros:  "Professionals" just like us, who love to party and to top it off they were from LA!!!

We spent the rest of the evening with these ladies because they were not ratchets (we bought each other drinks at their insistence), and they could carry on intelligent conversations.  Afterwards, we grabbed an early morning breakfast.  Lastly, we also agreed to meet up in LA soon.  I guess I should stop being so judgmental of Azn ladies.  These hawt Azn ladies helped me see the "Light"! - LMAO!!!

"That's all you need to know, right there, " she said, pointing up behind her head at a framed plackard from local news affiliate CBS 5 Dean's List.  
It was dated from like 1996, or 2003, or something like that, I can't remember, but it wasn't very recent.
"What's that got to do with Customer Service?" I asked, completely perplexed.  
I was just trying to tell her that I've had the same thing happen here twice now in two visits, where she is attending to personal business instead of her customer, ie me.  
"Go on. (waving towards the door)  We been here 17 years.  We don't need YOU."
"You haven't even listened to me.  I'm going to have to tell somebody about this."
"I don't care.  I dont need to listen.  I'M the owner. Go." (she starts pacing back and forth behind the counter, like a caged animal or a person about to get in a fight)
"You're the ONLY owner?  So you're saying your PARENTS work for YOU?  Here, and down the street at BurgerMania?"
"I'm the owner.   I don't care."

A customer standing next to me, who's already received her order but has been waiting the entire time, come to find out, for Mrs. Rude to scoop her an ice cream cone, chimes in with, "I don't think she WANTS to listen to you."

You think?!    


Moments earlier, I'd stood at the counter ready to order, while she was digging red plastic baskets out of one of the trash containers in the lobby.  She saw me, and proceeded to continue what she was doing without acknowledging me, for a few more moments.

Then she comes around the counter  -- no hand washing -- and proceeds to take my order.  
$7.03 ... hand her my card, she swipes it but doesn't press any buttons on the card machine or the cash register.  
~
On her phone laying on the counter, she continues the texting she originally started while taking my order.
~
It's taking forever, and she keeps going back and forth between the credit card reading machine and her phone laying on the counter.
     -a few buttons pressed over here, -a few buttons pressed over there
Finally, I say "Forget it, this is the second time you've done something like this to me recently, and it's not acceptable to me.  I'm taking my business elsewhere."  
"I WAS WAITING FOR THE MACHINE! "  she lamely attempts to defend.
"You were on the phone instead of doing what you should have been doing."
"Go ahead.  I don't care.  That's all you need to know right there."

.......and now you're up to date, back at the top of the review.

WAIT!  I forgot to tell you about what happened last time:

I go for a late lunch, and I'm after a Falafel sandwich, easy enough.
Into a near empty dining room walks your humble narrator, and there's no one waiting in line at all, since it's 1 ish already.  
A single patron is waiting at the counter for his food, engaged in personal conversation with our villain, Mrs Rude.

As I stand patiently behind Chatty Customer Man, Mrs Rude makes no effort to wrap it up or otherwise acknowledge me as a waiting customer, despite having already made indisputable eye contact.  

"Shit, Did they just change subjects?!?" I'm thinking to myself, as I make the Universal Signal for depicting the perfect combination of Hunger and Readiness at a food ordering counter -- I caused my keys to jingle in my hands.  

I literally stood at an empty counter while they chatted for a full minute and a half before I decided to turn and begin walking away.
I didn't rush, since there were a few Mother-May-I-Giant-Steps between me and the exit, and I would have gladly turned back if called upon.

But she let me go, and now I know why.

Mr Gyro doesn't need my business.
Mr Gyro doesn't need your business.

And if Mrs Rude does, in fact, speak on behalf of the entire ownership of Mr Gyro, well, then I guess 

Mr Gyro doesn't even WANT our business.   So be it.

When I saw this place show up as a Hot New Business on the Yelp frontpage, I thought it was a bit of a silly name.  But it tells you everything you need to know about the business.  Think Subway/Chipotle (Custom Built Sandwich/Burrito) assembly line style ordering, but for pizza.  $8.95 gets you a 12-inch pizza with all the toppings you want.  According to their website:

(4) kinds of sauces
(4) kinds of cheeses, which you can combine together
(7) kinds of meats
(7) kinds of veggies
(7) kinds of toppers, added after the pizza is cooked

Who else sells you a (potentially) 25-topping pizza for $8.95?!  I don't know if I would try it.  Except that I totally would if I could order it without feeling like a bit of a jerk.  Once you order your pie, you'll have it within minutes; these cook fast.  10 minutes after setting foot into the restaurant I had my food!

For my very first custom built pizza I had the spicy diavola sauce, fresh mozzarella, Italian sausage, mushroom, garlic and sun dried tomatoes (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CeqWpwHBoaxwRcv5btnv6g?select=zg2BAK39ZOP7M6bmZmAF7Q#tqe5lahN7SPZZw2mLVaFag).  I can still taste the spicy diavola and garlic in my breath, and I'm quite okay with that.  No gum for me, I'm still enjoying my pizza.  Tasty ingredients all around, and the crust keeps a chewy consistency with a slight crunch.  

You want to ask me out for dinner?  How the heck are you gonna do that?  You can build me a pizza or something.  I am a fan and I will most definitely be back.

Exhilarating pre fixe menu that showcases the chef's masterful culinary skills!

Located in the beautiful themed garden of the Bellagio, the restaurant's sleek blond wood interior was both intimate and inviting.  Set against soft lighting, the dining space was conducive to a festive and celebratory evening with good friends and at first glance of the tasting menu, i was looking forward to the exciting evening ahead. 

The Breads: Warm sourdough & honey wheat rolls came out nice & hot with a side of lightly salted soft butter. The sourdough was my personal favorite with its nice buttery crust and warm chewy center.

Our party of four didn't need much coaxing as we almost instantly decided on the all inclusive chef's tasting menu with wine pairings, which included the famous lobster pot pie!  

Tuna Tartare - Fresh plump ruby red tuna prepared table side with bright vibrant colors that was definitely a sight to see!  The ancho chili and fresh mint pumped up the volume by adding a tangy zing to this remarkable dish and the pine nuts added a pleasant rustic contrast of texture and rounded out the flavor profiles nicely!

Caviar Parfait - Magnificent! Served atop airy light creme fraiche and a crisp potato cake, each bite was magical! The bubbly paired perfectly with this exquisitely enjoyable dish!

Lobster Pot Pie - Outstanding! I was anxiously anticipating this dish and i am happy to admit that it did not disappoint! As soon as the server carved away the warm golden crust, the sweet smell of buttery lobster wafted into the air and i was mesmerized! As i glanced down into my ramekin, i could see chunks of juicy lobster bathed in brandied lobster cream and it made my mouth instantly water!  I simply love pot pie and lobster has always been on my guilty pleasure list, so the combination for me was a match made in foodie heaven! 

American Kobe Rib Eye - Perfection! The kobe beef was exceptionally moist, tender and buttery! Oh, and yes, it melted in my mouth! Hot dayam, what i'd give to sink my teeth into this luscious piece of premium meat again! Let's not forget about the sides! The butter poached porcini was rich and flavorful while the creamed corn was decadence in every bite!

The tasting menu ended with several small dessert items that showcased the chef's whimsical approach to sweets including a magnificent root beer float, a cookie served with hot mulled apple cider, chocolate bon bons, chocolate chip cookies and a glazed chocolate brownie with cocoa nib ice cream & spiced pecans. 

In a few words, it was literally death by chocolate!!!....and oh what a way to die!

The wine pairings were 100% spot on compliments to our meals. With that said, our server was nothing short of professional, helpful, and friendly.  It was great having friendly conversation with everyone but still enjoy the formalities of fine dining. 

What more could a birthday boy ask for?

I've had this Bosnian restaurant bookmarked for some time and finally my friend and I were able to stop by for dinner. Located in a tiny strip mall, the dcor was neatly arranged with cultural artifacts, white table clothes, and the atmosphere was spacious and cozy. 

The menu was smaller and more affordable than my visit to Saraj. We decided to start off with a Home Style Bean Soup ($5) filled with light tasting Bosnian beans and chunks of beef here and there. Very hearty as the bowl warmed the belly. The beans boast wonderful flavor with hints of beef to render depth. The owner was very generous to give us a second serving so there was plenty to share.  

Next, the Stuffed Cabbage ($5) arrived with boiled cabbage stuffed with ground beef that came with onions, peppers, and other seasonings with a dollop of sour cream on top. The cabbage was soft, naturally sweet, and easy to bite into. The ground beef had some pop due to the seasonings with a nicely broth to bring to a finer note. They were much bigger than the ones at Saraj as there were plenty of ground beef to fill the center. So delicious, it's something I'm eager to have again.

Their highly recommended item, the Bosnian Sausage Sandwich ($7), came with 10 pieces of small Bosnian sausages sandwiched held in-between two thick fluffy fried breads. The bread was slightly browned and crispy on the outside and spongy on the inside. The sausages were savory delicious and wonderfully seasoned. The sandwich also came with creamy red pepper sauce and raw onions to ignite sweet and sharp contrasts.

The extra fried bread for the bean soup was superfluous. Service-wise, the server was Bosnian but not particularly knowledgeable about the cuisine. The owner, however, was very warm, friendly, and managed to come out of the kitchen to greet us and address questions. Interested diners should know that they also have authentic Bosnian items that are not listed on the menu. 

4.5 stars. Cheaper, bigger, and better than Saraj. This is one of the most overlooked places in the Valley. I would love to come back to try their veal and assortment of desserts.

This place is like Burning Man...with foie gras!
First caveat: I was heavily medicated on the occasion of my visit to this far-out "social experiment". Maybe that's why I had such a great time...or maybe the place is just cool on its own. All I know for sure is that I was suspended in a wonderfully floaty state of confusion the entire evening, as I was led through a maze of sumptuously decorated rooms full of weird performers doing weird shit, plying me with fabulously sumptuous drinks and dishes. I felt like Alice in Tsarist-era Wonderland, as if at any moment Josephine Baker would pop out of a Victrola and offer me a magic banana with a tag reading "EAT ME." Magnifique!
Second caveat: I could never afford going here myself, but a visiting liberal-elitist New York journalist pal invited me to accompany him on a sort of VIP PR tour. We were heavily schmoozed by PR people...but PR snowjob or not, this place is super fucking cool! 
It's the same vibe as Absinthe - creepy vintage cabaret, with Hieronymous Bosch murals and old telephones and freaky performers being artsy in every corner as you sip craft cocktails and eat "updated" versions of classic, old-school Vegas fare like rack of lamb and beef Wellington. Three times a night, they put on an actual show with acrobats and shit, but you have to buy special tickets for that in addition to dinner and drinks. And then after the last show -- excuse me, "canto"-- the showroom turns into a nightclub...and you can par-taaaay late into the night, if that's your bag.
Since my friend was being schmoozed, it was seen to that our experience was exceptionally fabulous, and to that end we were hosted by a smart young hipster-type in a velveteen jacket and Morrissey glasses, with the most astonishingly earnest stream of P.R.B.S. flowing effortlessly from his mouth all night long. I don't mean to make him sound insincere -- he was amazing in that he was totally earnest about every adjective he used. Words like "mixologist," "craft bitters" and "ice chef" rolled effortlessly and completely irony-free off his gilded tongue, and with every word he spoke I found myself more and more spellbound by his surreal gravitas. Plus, he had the most amazing vocabulary of anyone I've ever met!
Now, it's true that Rose.Rabbit.Lie. is pretentious to a fault -- but somehow, that's part of its charm. As mentioned, it's not for the feint of wallet-- those fabulous craft cocktails will set you back $16 or more apiece...but astonishingly, it's worth it! They were some of the best drinks I've ever tasted -- and I've tasted 'em all! I supposed it helps that they're heavy into bitters, and use my all-time favorite spirit Campari liberally (I had a cocktail containing Campari jelly...!!!)...but drinks aside, the ambiance and atmosphere alone are totally worth ponying up the cash for (you're subsidizing a huge and very attentive staff). The experience really is that fabulous -- the aforementioned ice chef is responsible for carving giant chunks of ice into various shapes, like diamonds (!!!), that sparkle in your cocktail like a Liz Taylor-Richard Burton quaalude-fueled sex-a-thon.
After drinks in the fabulously-appointed "study," we went onto dinner in the dining room. Our gracious host ordered a huge feast of just about one of everything, and it was truly exceptional in the details --- the menus are sealed and stamped with wax, plus there are all manner of weird 1%er tableware accouterments like animal-shaped silverware-rests, filigreed forks and swan-shaped pewter sea-salt dishes with tiny spoons. 
After stuffing ourselves with foie gras, caviar, lobster and champagne, we retired to the showroom to watch the last of the three nightly "cantos" of Vegas Nocturne -- basically, an Absinthe-style sort of burlesque circus about an hour long, after which the showroom turned into a nightclub, and a Sexy Lady DJ came out and played club music while everyone danced. Maybe I'm just jaded, but I found the whole showroom component of the evening boring. The show itself was nothing you can't see elsewhere, and I just felt it wasn't cool/creative/freaky enough to live up to the rest of the place.
If/when I return to Rose.Rabbit.Lie., I plan to dress to the nines and spend the whole night boozing in the Study, with maybe a few small bites here and there to soak up all that Campari. Our host mentioned something about an old-fashioned record player in there, with free-for-all records, so I think it would be much more fun to just get genteelly sloshed while doing the Charleston to Al Jolson or some such, late into the wee hours. Pre-gaming with my medication was great, and psychedelics would also greatly enhance the experience...if one were so inclined. 
Overall, as pretentious and expensive as it is, I am compelled to wholeheartedly recommend Rose.Rabbit.Lie. as one of my favorite new places to party -- I've already made plans, in fact, to come back with some friends next month! See you there!!

Cafe Monarch is everything the five star reviews make it out to be and more. It's a must try for a unique brunch/lunch/dinner/whatever experience in the valley! I'm reluctant to review this place since I don't want to wade through patrons on my way to another lovely Sunday brunch, but my taste buds will not be deterred. (Plus I have until September before they re-open, so there's plenty of buffer room.)

It's an impromptu fly-by-the-seat-of-whatever-the-chef-feels-like-whipping-up type place. The kind of place where you show up to breakfast and are asked one question: Sweet or savory? 

So whatever you do, leave those picky eater at home! When it comes to dinner, you don't want a wonderbread palate ("Um, I don't eat anything green...") influencing the meal. Chef Christopher is a dynamo in the kitchen, and you need to leave that one man show plenty of room to create his masterpieces. No exaggeration, his dishes are crazy delicious masterpieces. It's like having your own personal top chef customizing something just for you.

The fact that this place is BYOB makes my heart smile. I love sharing a couple bottles of good wine or champagne among friends over dinner, and the fact that I don't have to pay a restaurant mark-up is ideal. He's also cool with you brining in some orange or cranberry juice for  DIY mimosas in the morning. There's a $10 corking fee, but considering the fact that a glass of wine is often more expensive than that, it's a screaming deal. 

Be forewarned that this is a dining experience rather than a quicky meal. A much more European approach to lingering and enjoying the food, drink and atmosphere. It will take you a couple hours to get through everything from initial seat and greet with the chef (who doubles as the waiter/busser/todos!) to your last scrumptious bite. Totally worth every minute of waiting. Also, you might not want to come here starvin marvin. And definitely don't invite anyone you can't stomach hanging out with for a couple hours. 

Let's wrap it up:
-Don't bring picky eaters.
-Don't come so hungry that you'd eat the ass end carpaccio out of fresh roadkill.
-Don't bring socially awkward schmoes that will suck all the fun out of the room because you've got to be around that for hours, man. Hours.
-Do BYOB, and don't be afraid to bring a mixer for mimosa fun.
-Do bring cash only, and tip very, very well. (He deserves it!)

I now set you forth upon the world with the knowledge necessary to enjoy all that Cafe Monarch has to offer. Use it wisely.

I've read that brevity is the soul of wit...

Brevity is also a wonderful thing when it comes to the waiting time for your dinner of Italian peasant food...pizza:)

Brevity is not Pizzeria Bianco's strong suit...(nor mine, in writing reviews, but we're not talking about me:)

After my second visit in 4 years (and 4th visit overall), I'm trying to figure out what PB's strong suit is:(...public relations and marketing, perhaps?

Creating the "Pizza Placebo Effect"?

I generally try not to knowingly go anyplace that aggravates me, whether it's for dining, for drinking, for entertainment, for using the restroom...really for pretty much anything:)

So why were we back at PB after a good solid 4 year run of avoiding this particular aggravation?   

Other people, that's why:)

Other people wanted to go to PB...other people wanted to try the Wiseguy and the Marghareta and see Chris's oven and have mozzarella cheese and what not... and so the Beautiful Carin (who has the patience of a saint) and I took them out to PB the other evening...well, it was evening when  we started:(

We went...we waited...we had some pizza...and it was pretty average artisan pizza...

Was it the worst pizza I've ever eaten?...oh no...'sup, Totino's?

Was it the best pizza that I can remember eating?...oh no...How you doin' Flying Pie in Portland and Di Fara in Brooklyn?

Is PB worth the aggravation?...Sadly, not for me:(

For me, it's hard to overlook the attitude at the door, and the "you're barely worthy of eating here" attitudes of the servers (both in Bar Bianco and Pizzeria Bianco), as I try to enjoy my evening.

I understand that all the kids "assisting Chris" at PB think they're pretty special to be working at PB and all...but...it's a pizza joint...would it hurt them to at least try to be personable and pleasant?

It's also hard for me to overlook the multi-hour wait to dine at PB (and, truth be told, we've been here before...we did come expecting a wait...we were prepared to have wine and relax...I even had my flask, so I had a scotch and tried to relax)...still 3  1/2 hours...for pizza?

I can fly  1/2 way to NYC in the time it takes to get a table (and the flight attendants on Continental are sweet and pleasant to me...feed me drinks in 1st class...you know...they make me feel appreciated:)

And speaking of "appreciated"...it's hard for me to overlook the lack of appreciation we've encountered at PB:(

The few times we've been to PB, the staff hasn't seemed to be in a pleasant mood...very quick to tell us "the rules of PB" and eager to let us know that if we weren't good little customers, there were 50 more people in line that would happy to take our places:(

You know what... they are right...there were 50 more people that would have loved to see us leave and they would have moved up in the queue.

But it's obnoxious of the folks at PB to make that the overriding theme of the evening and it belies any pretense that they might try to concoct about "customer service" and being the "the best possible pizza experience for each customer"...the attitude of "we're PB and you're not" is pervasive and unpleasant:(

And frankly, when I spend well over $200 for pizza, wine and cheese for 4 in the course of a 3+hour wait, get a rush job on the very late dinner and a lamentable lack of service from the waiter (who's busy chatting with friends or "regulars" at the counter)...well, it causes me aggravation.

But the good news is that I won't be back for another 4 years...less aggravation for me and more spaces in the line at the door:)

There have been some changes at the DMV and I'm impressed. No more waiting in a long line yay! This new "Dash Pass" system worked well. With the Dash Pass you can text, call or go online and put yourself in the line without having to even go down to the DMV until it's your turn. They will text you with how many people are ahead of you and your estimated wait time and then they send you a command list so you can text back whenever you want to find out things like how long your current wait time is or to let them know if you need more time or even if you want to be taken out of the line. They text you with fair enough warning about when your turn is so you know when to arrive at the DMV and they let you know around that time what window you will need to go to. This is seriously awesome! I never would have thought I'd give the DMV 5 stars, but this new system really worked great for me twice now and the employees were even really friendly. I needed to renew my license so I had to go inside. Usually I avoid going inside since they have the DMV kiosks around town at a variety of places and it's so convenient to stop and register your car at the kiosk and you can do it at any hour. Sometimes though you just can't avoid having to go inside and now it's not that bad having to do so. The snack bar seems to get bigger and bigger and the line of people at it cracks me up, but hey why not grab a hot dog, nachos or cotton candy while at the DMV? When it came time to pay for my license renewal and the lady told me it would cost $41.25 I was shocked. I asked why so much now and she said that I would be getting a license good for 8 years. Say what?!?! Apparently those born even numbered years get the 8 year license and those in odd numbered years that renew will continue to receive the 4 year license until 2017 and then get the 8 year license after that. I kind of like the idea of not having to go back for 8 years a lot. I'm kind of surprised though since people do age differently among other things. I didn't have an issue with finding a parking spot like I have many times before and that was nice. I'm guessing the parking lot wasn't so bad because people are maybe using Dash Pass. I am happy to say that I had a quick and painless experience at the DMV.

I had only one expectation coming here.  That it was going to blow my mind and...it sure did!

I am in no way a connoisseur of cured meats.  I actually wasn't fully aware of what the true meaning was.  As our server explained it to us, it's the process of using the entire animal for the meal and then curing it by adding spices, smoking it or preserving it for later in salt.  You could say I almost went into this blindly...but the other yelpers reviews don't lie!

We started off with two meat and cheese platters:
Salami -lardo, mortadella, pate campagola, ciccioli, chicken rillettes, cornichon, mustard, red onion, pickles and beets
PA Farmstead Cheeses - stone meadow, crottin de chevre, commonfolk, blue misty river, midnight dream and candied prunes

I was surprised to like the chicken rillettes the most (I'm not the biggest chicken fan).  It seemed to have the most flavor to me.  The mustard was AWESOME! I wanted to slather it on everything! I also enjoyed the homemade pickled pickles (heehee), beets and onions.  I really liked the crottin de chevre because I like hard and sharp cheeses more than the softer ones.  It was an awesome combo with the light honey drizzle and the candied prunes.  Can you believe I've never had a prune?  The thought of them scared me, but it was delicious!

Since I've never been to a place like this before I wasn't too sure what to order for dinner.  I just picked the meat I thought sounded best, which was the duck.  I'm not lying when I took my first bite and my first thought was "orgasmic!"  Seriously folks, the duck was so tender and succulent with a crisp and incredibly well seasoned outside.  I had devoured the first slice of duck before I realized I hadn't cut off the fat...oops.  First thought was I should cut the rest off....eh...whatever it's all incredible, I'm downing the whole package baby!  

I also loved the spaetzle, melted cabbage, mustard and apple combo it came with.  I'm a huge cabbage fan and the flavors were just incredible again.  I would have licked my plate if I could, next best thing was leaving not a morsel left.  

The finale of our meal was the chocolate souffle cake with pistachio butter.  I will say, I do not usually like chocolate cake but this was again orgasmic and a total party in my mouth.  Just so moist with a perfect balance of chocolate so that it wasn't too rich.  And the pistachio butter, incredible!  Can I get that in a jar to go please?

It gets better though!  It's BYOB, so bring your fave bottle!  Reservations are a must, as it's a tiny place.  I have to also add that service was incredible and my water glass never fell below the halfway point.  The servers also were super descriptive with the menu and helped make our decisions easier.  I so appreciate good service...you could just tell they enjoyed what they were doing and were totally into the food!  I mean, who wouldn't at this point!

New KoMex location. Same very delicious KoMex food. 

If you haven't tried KoMex yet get down to this location or the original location ASAP. I hated the long almost 1 hr waits at the other location on some days. Yes it's that good. So I'm very happy this one finally opened up. Korean Mexican fusion is an excellent combination. I ordered their Fusion Burrito, my usual order, and inhaled that sucker like I was in a pie eating contest. Why waste time eating 1 yummy thing when I could eat 2 yummy things, didn't do 2 but wanted to. The one thing that you must do is add lots and lots of their hot sauces on anything you get it's a big difference maker but in moderations. I almost ate all 4 of the containers of sauce on my own. It's very good. They should bottle them cause I might want to take some home.

Their fusion tacos, burritos, nachos, fries, etc are served with various meats like spicy pork, pork belly, chicken, and more all come with a Korean/Mexican twist. Even their cheese steak was different, using bulgogi. Check out the pictures and reviews at the original location it will pretty much tell you wassup.

I enjoyed the customer service friendly, complementary chips, salsa, guacamole, fortune cookies, and oranges to end the meal. They were still finishing up construction and decorating, fine tuning things like only cash at the time, 1 out of the 6 menu books at our table was without a menu inside, and temp banner outside but things are looking good. Seems like more space for more seats and even a bar area. I'll probably be back before the weeks over. No I will definitely be back before the weeks over.

Located in the same plaza as BabyStacks Cafe and Hikari SW Buffalo and Flamingo.

Did I mention that they're pretty cheap in price.

I've been anticipating SLS opening their doors and now I'm sadly disappointed. 

Staff: The dealers at the tables were very friendly and welcoming. I agree with other reviewers that there are way too many employees standing around doing nothing but chatting with one another. We walked around and saw groups of 3 or more employees just leaning against the wall talking. Other than the dealers no other staff member said hello or went out of their way to acknowledge guests and seemed engrossed in their own conversations. 

Cleanliness: The amount of trash and dirt was astounding. The carpets were covered with cigarette ash and bits of junk. Either they don't have enough people cleaning or they don't seem to care to clean up. Maybe the staff that just stand around talking could take pride in their own establishment and pitch in. There were half empty glasses left out in the bars from the night before. Walking around and seeing that the bars left dirty things overnight was such a turnoff. The bathrooms had toilet paper strewn about all over the floor and the trash was piled high in the baskets. Plus the janitorial staff left piles of plastic bags of trash outside the bathroom entrance. 

The Griddle: We went here for breakfast and had to wait over 15 minutes to be seated when 2/3 of tables were empty. The line of people outside couldn't stop complaining about how poorly the 4 (yes, 4) hostesses were handling the seating. When asked about the hold-up their response was that the staff was going through a shift change.    After being seated it took a few minutes before anyone came by with water. Then, it took a few more minutes before our server came by. Another server brought someone else's food to our table and then my boyfriend's meal was brought first and it took over 5 more minutes for my food to come out. When we finished our meal about an hour later and walked out of the restaurant at about 9am the line to get in went around the corner and the staff must still have been going through a shift change because there were loads of empty tables inside. 

Spa: We wanted to check out the spa but an unfriendly guard brusquely told us that only guests can go to the spa. I don't know how the spa will do if their only clientele comes from the hotel. You would think that they would want more business. All the other spas on the strip welcome outside guests. 

I noticed that a lot of people who left positive reviews had specifically attended the grand opening party. I would imagine that in the hype of the event everything seemed great but during the day and to an average visitor this place is just a huge flop. Disappointing.

I was debating a 3 or 4 star for this place on my drive home.  I decided this place is certainly over the 3.5 star mark, so 4 star it is.

First, you will find that the Cleaver Koi is on the west side of Central/Lite Rail in a small copper/bronze colored building that has a small breezeway down the middle.  The sign out front is small.  You should turn on/down (don't U turn) Glenrosa St or if you U-turn, be sure to turn into their parking lot at the FIRST left turn (just north of the building) you get to.  If you try that second turn, you will be turning into the wrong parking lot and you will have to circle around on Central and come back again.  Don't ask me how I know this.  But I will say it could be helpful information for those who are not familiar with the area.

Cleaver Koi is a very "neat/cute" space.  I LOVE the ambiance, the look and feel of the restaurant.  It has an atmosphere that is right on par with Central Phoenix, hipster, chic, cool.  I stopped in there today, a Saturday, for lunch. The cleaver Koi has been open about 2 months, so there wasn't a crowd, but the server mentioned that the day before on a Friday, they were completely packed pretty much the entire lunch and dinner service.  So as the masses are finding out about this place, it is filling up like good CenPho restaurants do.

My friend and I ordered a variety of things.  Here's my take on a few of memorable things.

My favorite item was the "Pig Face" dumplings!!!  Amazingly delicious and savory with an appropriate level of spice.  Tender dumplings that practically melt in your mouth. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#TwNmKVIhbSWHQgm22KMfQw

We also tried the following notable things:
Salt and Pepper Shrimp:  worth having again.  I was pleased with the size and amount of this dish.  I would have had that as an entre.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#QJLxMqO42DMuun5bZzDsoA

Peking Duck Steamed Bun:  Oh man, the duck is very good!  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#uy69wuSn45EnO-Z0sUj88Q

I will definitely come back here for HH when I get the opportunity.  I originally planned to have the roasted pork ramen, but I ended up ordering the Massaman Noodles.  I was satisfied with it, but I ordered it thinking that the noodles would be in a more brothy/soup-like base.  but this dish is certainly a curry (gravy) texture (as the menu stated) and the dish could be eaten with chopsticks.

Oh, they have the cutest crafted cocktail menu... there's one drink "Hey Bartender"... you tell them the spirit and the flavor choice you like... the bartender creates a drink just for you.  It worked twice for us!  Awesome, loved it.

We arrived at 5:00 pm to check-in and were told by the front desk agent that our room wasn't ready yet and that they couldn't give us an estimate of when it would be. The hotel's check-in time is 3:00 pm. In order to compensate us, they gave us a $150 discretionary account to use on whatever we wanted in the hotel as well as an upgrade from our terrace suite to a wraparound suite. We believed this was more than fair and were perfectly happy to wait until our upgraded room was ready. When we were notified that it was, we checked in and the agent confirmed with us the $150 account.

After a lovely Saturday night of enjoying the admittedly beautiful view provided by our upgraded room and the drinks from the bar paid for by the $150 discretionary account, we cleaned up and checked out at 12:00 noon. 

The front desk agent told us that we would be charged $94 for incidental expenses beyond what was provided by the hotel. We knew that it was highly unlikely for us to have spent that much money that night, and asked for a receipt accordingly. The agent pulled it up and told us that the hotel had originally given us $50, not the $150 figure which we had been told - twice! After I corrected her, she brought in the front desk manager, David Bayley, who told us that he couldn't do anything and that we'd have to wait until 5:00 pm for yesterday's front desk manager to arrive so that she could sort out the issue.

After coming back at 5:30, we asked a front desk agent, Kira, if we could speak to yesterday's front desk manager. She said that yesterday's manager wasn't there and that we should talk to her instead. What followed from Kira was an extremely condescending if superficially pleasant treatment of us, implying that we were lucky enough to have been upgraded to a different room and that we should have been happy with what we received. Eventually, she deigned to give us an additional $50 comp credit out of "good will", but refused to do anything else, telling us that she'd ask the original agent we received the $150 credit from later to verify our story and that she'd follow up with us via email.

We, of course, were profoundly skeptical that anything would be resolved over email and asked to speak again to the manager, David. After Kira briefed David about our complaint, he came out to tell us, essentially, to leave the hotel and be happy with what we already received. Only after requesting to speak to David's superior did he finally decide to call the original agent to confirm our story. He told us that the original agent couldn't remember the amount she had compensated us, and that they'd cancel out our balance of $94.

First of all, this incident shows a stunning lack of integrity by the front desk agents. They had first told us to wait until 5:00 pm for a manager that never showed up, then told us to leave Vegas while they investigated the incident and that they'd follow up via e-mail, and finally that they'd give us a $50 credit out of "good will" - admitting no wrongdoing - and that we should just leave. The entire time, we felt that they were trying to delay and make it as inconvenient for us as possible so that we'd leave without the issue being resolved. Only after threatening to escalate the issue to upper management did the David take any substantive steps to solve the problem.

Second was the painfully condescending attitude of the front desk. Kira and David seemed to believe that $94 was a great deal of money to us. It wasn't. They didn't understand that our complaint was about the principle that we shouldn't have to pay extra for administrative mistakes made by the staff. They told us that they'd give us a $50 credit to our account out of "good will" with all the smug superiority an aristocrat might throw a dime to a beggar, treating us as though we were simply haggling to get the best deal we could. 

Finally, the whole incident reflects the sheer incompetence of the front desk. Even if they believed that we were lying about the original $150 credit, which certainly was the impression we received, good business sense behooves them to simply cancel out our balance. $94 is nothing compared to the thousands of dollars they're going to forgo via our entire network of friends who will never again stay at the Cosmopolitan. 

At the very end, after they finally canceled out our balance, I asked for Kira and David's business cards so that I knew whose names to mention to the world. David, to his credit, wrote down his name and contact information on a slip of paper. Kira, however, wrote but one word on a slip she handed me - "Kira". No last name, no phone number, no email address. My friends and I couldn't help but laugh at the cowardice she displayed through that simple omission. Anyone decent person doing his or her job competently and with integrity has nothing to hide - unfortunately, Kira seemed to lack both.

Don't stay at the Cosmo. Your dignity is more important than having a nice view.

Our group got hungry so with the lack of planning, we decided to just go across the street to Johnny Rockets.

FOOD - 1 Star: I ordered:

- Chili Cheese Fries: These were ok. They were really heavy on the chili and the cheese was barely there. It would've been way better to actually have the cheese on the top instead of under the chili.

- Sweet Potato Bacon Cheese Fries: I enjoyed the sweet potato fries myself, but the cheese... if you can call it that... was pretty disgusting. I don't know why they couldn't use real cheese. Instead they used some liquid cheese that you'd find at the movie theater and so it had this weird taste to it. The only thing that kind of saved it was the bacon, but even that was overpowered by the liquid cheese. This ruined my appetite and I had to eat around the cheese, which was almost impossible since it was all over the place.

- Smoke House Single Burger: This was pretty good, but smaller than I thought it would be. Maybe I don't come here often enough, but the burger was small. The taste was spot on. You can't go wrong with a meat patty, cheese, onion rings, and bacon.

SERVICE - 2 Stars: The staff was friendly, but literally only approached us to drop off the menus and to deliver food. No one checked on us at all during the meal. I need an extra fork and literally had to flag someone down to get it.

ATMOSPHERE - 2 Stars: It's your typical Johnny Rocket's setup and my biggest issue with the place was the fact there was no soap in the restroom. I'm glad we had hand sanitizer with us, but that's just gross.

RECOMMENDATION: Overall, I'd say you can skip this place. Go to Capriotti's or Joe's Pizza in the same shopping center instead. You'll get way better food for the money you're paying.

Perched atop the 64th floor of the majestic Hotel at Mandalay, Mix boasts some of the best views of the south strip in Vegas. Once you set foot inside the lavish ivory themed dining room, you know you're in an Alain Ducasse restaurant. The space simply oozes the charm and elegance of his signature opulent style reminiscent of the dining room at the Hotel Plaza Athne in Paris.  The glitz and glamour of Vegas is also quite apparent and you can't help but be dazzled by the contemporary and elegant atmosphere that envelops you.

With the beautiful weather I had been  experiencing over the weekend, I opted for patio seating with a direct view of the Vegas strip below. 

After glancing through the menu, I decided  to try Chef Ducasse's signature Tasting Menu with wine pairings.

Breads came out soon after with a selection of focaccia, French baguette, dinner rolls and sourdough with unsalted and an interesting "peanut" butter. The breads were room temperature and butters were cold so spreading was not pleasant but the breads served their purpose of filling my gullet til the main courses arrived. 

Amuse

Foie gras royale with port reduction and mushroom foam 

- this enticing little number exhibited a pleasant airiness and irresistible aroma from the mushroom foam and the interesting mix of flavors and textures married well together lending a savory yet earthy element to this whimsically fascinating dish

Gnocci
With Parmigiano Reggiano, veal jus and sun chokes.

Not the best Gnocci I've ever had but satisfying nonetheless. This dish had an incredibly comforting feel to it. I especially enjoyed the contrasting textures from the light & crispy chips and tender enoki mushrooms served with the dish. Warm, rustic yet subtle and familiar flavors were easy on my palate. 

Main lobster curry with coconut basmati rice 

- it's hard to go wrong with lobster, especially when you infuse thai flavors into a dish. The perfectly cooked lobster was bathed in a pool of curry and served stop luscious coconut rice. A delectable marriage of flavors.

Filet mignon Rossini with foie gras and black truffle sauce 

- this was easily my favorite dish of the night. The combination of filet mignon, foie gras and black truffle is like the holy trinity of fine dining.  The result will almost always result in endless drooling and licking the porcelain off your plate. 

Predessert

Coconut foam and mango rum cocktail. An exhilarating drink with bright notes and a sweet finish. Excellent palate cleanser and a perfect way to prepare my taste buds for the sweet finale.

Baba a la marnagnac

Unfortunately I wasn't as impressed with my dessert.
The liqueur for the cake was too strong and pungent while the flavors were just were too heavy handed. I may have myself to blame for that, as I may have given the cakes too heavy of a pour of the accompanying liqueur.

Overall, food was good but I must admit that I expected more from a multi Michelin star chef like Alain Ducasse.  IMO, the dishes lacked that wow factor that I was eagerly anticipating.  Service was also on the clumsy and awkward side the night I dined, as well. For instance, my wine pairing for one of my dishes was completely forgotten until I reminded the sommelier. Additionally, the wait staff seemed a bit hurried and rushed.  The furniture itself, which has probably seen better days, was in desperate need of an update, too. During my dinner one of my guests had to change their seat out because the chair was collapsing. For a restaurant of this caliber, I expected a bit more, at least chairs that weren't falling apart at the seams. 
With that said, they changed the chair out without a hitch and there were some redeeming factors which included the stunning views, beautiful setting and expansive bar next door.  
3.5 stars for now and hoping the restaurant makes some improvements on the menu, furniture, and service in the future.

Until then...

Happy Eats!

We contacted Maleisa Hughes last year regarding watching our three dogs (golden retriever, afghan hound and a chihuahua.  The prices were reasonable considering what other sites cost, as they were only charging $20 per dog and they were willing to give a discount for the third dog, so the price was set at $50 per day.  We scheduled a visit to their home and brought our 2 big dogs to introduce them to the owners.  We saw that there was an acre which looked fun for the dogs. They invited us into their home and said the dogs would be treated like members of the family if boarded with them and that all play time outside would be supervised.  Maleisa said they had been boarding dogs for years and were experienced and advised we book early for any dates we wanted as they limited the number of dogs boarded to six dogs.  We felt that was reasonable on a property of that size.  Our dogs were all very well socialized with people and other dogs as we routinely went to dog parks so we felt this would be a great place to bring them. We booked a weekend last fall just to test the place out and see how it went.  We checked in often, via text and and we were told the dogs were doing great and having lots of fun.  The day we picked them up they were out in the yard with the owners running around with a few other dogs and seemed content.    My Afghan hound went to the corner of the yard when he saw me and hid behind some ducks in an open pen, I assumed he didn't want to go home as he had enjoyed his stay.   We went ahead and booked the Christmas week to bring the dogs again.

Christmas rolled around and one of my adult children announced she would be home and offered to watch the dogs for me.  As we had already booked with Green Acres, I didn't feel right about canceling at the last minute, as I had noticed that the owners had numerous young children and felt it would not be fair to deprive the family of the income we had promised.  I did opt to leave the chihuahua home, as I felt he might not be safe running around with bigger dogs.  We boarded the big dogs for about 9 days.  When I came to pick up the dogs that time, they were let out of a room in the back of the house and the afghan hound ran to me with his tail between his legs and couldn't wait to get out of there.  I noticed that both dogs were filthy and smelled HORRIBLE.  I can't even describe the stench, but it took several baths to finally get rid of the odor.  I found it odd because the acreage is all grass, so I couldn't figure out where that stench would have come from.  

Outside of the smell, the dogs seemed fine until a few weeks later we attempted to go back to the dog park where we had gone many times over the years, and when we entered the park the afghan hound FREAKED out and started aggressively barking at the other dogs that ran up to greet him as if to say, "stay away from me".  I had to grab him and remove him to avoid a dog fight.  We attempted to return to the park a few times thereafter and he behaved the same way each time.  He even freaked out on a walk when he saw another dog across the way.  We spoke to a trainer regarding the behavior and he told us once a dog is in that mind set it is VERY DIFFICULT to break it.  We were very sad and couldn't figure out what could have triggered such a wild swing in temperament.  We finally realized that his behavior HAD to have been impacted by the stay at the boarding facility.  Looking back now, if he was stuffed in a room with 30 other dogs, it would have driven any dog mad, or to fear aggression.

We couldn't prove that anything horrible had happened to our dog at that point, it was just a feeling that something bad had happened there and we decided we probably should not use them again.

We decided to hire my niece and nephew last week to watch our dogs while we were out of town, because of that gut feeling something was wrong over there and came back to the news that 17-21 dogs had died in the Hughes' care, or lack thereof.  All I can think about is, IF I had cancelled our plans during Christmas and left the dogs with my daughter, I WOULD HAVE BOOKED last week with the Green Acres and my dogs would have been among those poor souls who lost their lives.  We were the lucky ones...I may not be able to take my temperamental hound to a park anymore, but at least he is alive.  My heart is breaking for all the families who lost their sweet puppies.

If you are looking for a really good Italian beef sandwich, you will find it here. Hubby and I stopped here for dinner and left full and satisfied. The inside is clean and there are plenty of tables. The employees were friendly and went over some of the menu items with us. They have Italian sausage, wraps, char-grilled burgers, hot dogs, salads, chili, tamales and fries, but my first time I had to try what they are famous for.

So, I ordered an "Italian Beef Sandwich" (regular Al) priced at $6.35 and added provolone and hot peppers for 50 cents each topping as well asked for the sandwich to be dipped. The bread really held up everything in it very well. Napkins are required when eating this sandwich dipped! The beef was tender and had good flavor and the peppers added a nice flavor to the sandwich. I also ordered a small "Cheddar Cheese Fries" priced at $3.85 and just thought they were average. Next time I am going to try them with different toppings. I liked that my food was made fresh in front of me. There isn't a drive-thru here, but if you are on a time crunch you can phone in your order for pick-up.

I've been by several times and loved everything I had each time. The employees are very courteous and make you feel like family when you are there. I like how affordable the menu is for the quality of food that you get. For $7.99 I got a "Smoked Brisket Sandwich" and for a few bucks more I made it a combo which included a side and a drink. I also added an additional side of "Cheezy Mac & Cheese" to my order. The brisket is smoked for 18 hours and is the best brisket I have had in town. The meat has such great flavor! When it comes to flavor the beans have it and like the brisket, the beans here are the best I've had in town. The macaroni and cheese was very good too. I'm not the type to eat meat off of the bone, but I did try a rib and I enjoyed every bite! So tender and flavorful! For dessert I had "Banana Pudding" priced at $3.99 and it was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. 

Inside is clean and smells like heaven. So does the parking lot where you can on most days see the man himself outside smoking up some of the tasty meats they offer here. If you want to eat at home they offer a variety of party packs. They will even come to your home and bring their own grills and smokers to cater your event. Call them to find out about the packages they have and pricing. I am going to definitely keep the catering in mind for the future!

We arrived at Snooze for what would be our final meal here AZ before heading back home. My sister claims this is her favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix--which is a huge recommendation considering every breakfast here has been terrific. As I perused the menu I noticed they had a nice selection of fancy pancakes and they all sounded terrific. My Brother-in-law pointed out that they had a thing called the "Pancake Flight" where you can choose any three flavors you want.

Pancake Flight:

Pineapple Upside Down Pancake- I had to get this since it was one of the Yelp Review Highlights, and it was pretty good but didn't live up to the hype. I actually would've appreciated more Pineapple in it. While it was good, I doubt I'd order it again. 3*

Molten Chocolate Lava Pancake- This was a little slice of Heaven; it's a chocolate buttermilk pancake with a huge dollop of chocolate custard in the middle and topped with a Tangerine Glaze. Oh, yeah.. it's as good as it sounds. 4.5*

Pancake of the Day- Snooze features a different Pancake everyday, so be sure to ask your server before making any final decisions. On the day I was there it was some kind of Salted Caramel/Cinnamon concoction with a dollop of Ancho-Chocolate Custard in the middle. My jaw dropped as our waitress described it--much as yours did as you read my description. It was superb, and if you're lucky enough to be there when they feature it you *must* get it. 5*

Chocolate-Peanut Butter- My wife ordered this as a side to her eggs, and it was so massive I had to help her finish it--one of the perks when you're married to a light eater! It was pretty good, and tasted a lot like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. I'm not a huge Reese's fan, but if you are then this should be right up your alley! 3.5*

Coffee- Above-standard Diner Coffee, but nothing special. They have a whole placard on your table ballyhooing their coffee, but I just didn't get it. 3.5*

Service & Ambiance- Our server was excellent, and I wish I could remember her name and give her credit, but I misplaced the receipt as well. She was a tall, pretty brunette--you can't miss her. Snooze is a very clean and modern-looking, but I found some of their decorations to be a bit cloying--especially that huge asterisk logo thingy. The place also gets very loud, which I don't particularly want first thing in the morning. Time to invest in some sound dampeners, me thinks. 4.5*-service/2.5*-Ambiance

Value- Standard AZ value of less than $10 for breakfast, but still cheaper than Cali pricing. 4*

Everyone really enjoyed their breakfast here at Snooze; I was tempted to give it a 5th star, but the noise factor was a bit of a turn-off. I'd still probably say it's a solid 4.5-star breakfast joint, and I'd definitely go again and again if I lived in the area; I'll just try to remember to bring some earplugs next time.

Yes, I'm giving Hot Dog on A Stick 5 stars! I have nothing negative to say about my experience, it was actually above and beyond what I would ever expect from a Hot Dog on A Stick. I had only seen Hot Dog on A Stick in the food court at the mall before, so I was surprised to see a location in a small shopping center AND it has a drive-thru! Score! I was greeted by Casper, who went over the menu and specials. On Mondays & Wednesdays you can get double stamps on your rewards card. After you buy any 13 items you get 1 free! Don't forget to ask for a card! Casper also said that when it comes to drink sizes, the souvenir cup is $4 and some change, but you get $2 refills. This ends up a great deal if you plan on coming back. Casper also gave me a sample of their new orange lemonade flavor and it was refreshing.

I started out with a "Cheese on a Stick" priced at $2.85 and chose the American cheese (they also have pepper jack). Yum! This one isn't as big as the regular hot dog on a stick, but is very cheesy and was my favorite! Next I had the "Beef on a Stick" priced at $3.35 and again was pleased. The corn dog was made with an all-beef Nathan's hot dog. The corn dogs are battered and cooked fresh to order and both of mine were cooked perfect. 

Aside from corn dogs, on the menu you will find funnel cake sticks, french fries, hot dogs (in a bun!) and of course lemonade that is made fresh about every 2 hours in a variety of yummy flavors.

Step 5... Choose one or all:
Sour Cream
Cheese
Lettuce

Cabbage
Lime
Cilantro
Guacamole W/Hawaiian Pink Salt ($1.35 extra)

I purchased a $10 for $20 groupon so we could try this place out for dinner. Upon walking in we were greeted and right away offered a sample of their Huli Huli Chicken and Kalua Pig. Both of these were equally good, but I really loved the Huli Huli Chicken. After reading the menu board I decided to go with the "3 Tacos" with 2 on flour tortillas and 1 on crispy corn. I was torn on which meat to choose for my tacos, so the man behind the counter said I could mix and match them. Cool! I ended up going with chicken, pig and steak tacos and paying the extra $1.35 for guac on them. A lot of places would charge for the guacamole per taco, but I was just charged the 1 price and got a generous portion on all 3 tacos. The tacos were delicious! The charred pineapple verde adds a nice flavor addition, the meat is tender and has great flavor, the tortilla was soft and good and the price was right for what I got. The guacamole is worth buying just as a side to have with chips, but I have to admit that if there was some sort of Hawaiian pink salt in it, I didn't see it or taste anything except for fresh yummy guac. Hubby had a "Pulehu Steak Burrito" and loved it, but found the size to be too small for his hungry appetite. I still had half of a taco left so I was very fulfilled! So full that I didn't even taste a bite of the "Cheese Quesadilla" priced at $2.50 (meat extra) that we also ordered. 

I also had to make room for dessert later because I got a bag of "Coconut Bark" priced at $3.50 to try. Whoa!! This stuff is addicting! I have never had anything like it before and honestly don't even know for sure what all was in it. It seems like a saltine cracker with a layer of brown sugar or caramel and then a layer of chocolate and coconut. Whatever it is, I want more! 

You can eat inside, outside or even grab some grub from their drive-thru.

Thomas Keller is known for being a freakin' genius and since French Laundry is super expensive, Bouchon is a more cost-effective way to taste Chef Keller's masterpieces. 

So, I dragged 17 of my closest relatives here to experience one helluva breakfast! Many in my family, by the way, think IHOP is the best breakfast place on earth...*groan* *eyes roll* I hoped this place would give them an eye-opening, revelatory, perspective-altering dining experience!

FOOD (And yes, I sampled ALL these dishes):
Moules au Safran et a la Moutarde ($25.50) - WHOA. Mussels and fries for breakfast??? Oh hell yeah! I HAD to try it! Fries were cooked and salted perfectly. Tiny mussels steamed in white wine, mustard, and saffron...so tasty, so fresh! After the mussels were devoured, I wanted to grab the egg-shaped metal bowl and gulp down the remaining liquid. The white wine in that liquid was so distinct! Don't worry, I didn't lose my composure, I subtly used my spoon to enjoy the leftover yumminess.

Breakfast Americaine ($22) - This was served with two eggs any style, bacon, sausage, and toasted brioche. It also came with your choice of breakfast pastry, juice, and coffee. The most memorable thing about this dish was the surprisingly delicious strawberry croissant that didn't even look like a croissant. It was actually kind of ugly, but when I put a piece of it in my mouth...HOLY MOLY! I was surprised by how tasty it was! Warm, moist, sweet, with a hint of strawberry; soft and crunchy at the same time.

Bouchon French Toast ($12) - Brilliantly executed! A French toast cylinder with layers of bread pudding, brioche, custard, and apples. So light! so sweet! So moist! So nice to look at, I almost didn't want to eat it!

Gauffres ($12) - Waffles with fresh strawberries, sweetened with maple syrup and vanilla butter. Light, sweet, crunchy! Oh yesssss...

Les Oeufs ($13) - Nothing impressive. The scrambled eggs and country sausage were decent. The toasted brioche was good after I covered it with the made-in-house strawberry jam. I am not a fan of fruit preserves, actually I hate them but this strawberry jam was excellent. The potato croquettes were alright. Christopher C said they were good with ketchup.

Cinnamon Oatmeal w/Candied Orange Peel & Raspberry Puree ($7) - Bland but it was served in a cute little metal bowl. The raspberry puree was so subtle I could hardly tell it was there. And where was the candied orange peel? I couldn't see or taste it. The raspberries on top added a little flavor. It was a little better when we added the small cup of brown sugar that was included. We experimented and added some strawberry jam and oatmeal was way better!

Pecan Sticky Bun ($4.25) - Oh myyyyyy! Topped with crunchy pecans, this bun is very sticky, very sweet, and very good!

Hibiscus Champagne Cocktail ($12.50) - I ordered a mimosa but when they brought it, I saw this drink on the tray going to another table and I had to have one too! What a pretty cocktail! The hibiscus was fun to eat! When a person says no to this champagne, they say no to life!

SERVICE:
We had two waiters all to ourselves. We didn't wait too long for our drinks & food but they seemed to disappear after our food was served. It was hard to flag down our waitress when I wanted another champagne. Also, it took a while for my dad to get his coffee refilled.

I was proud of my family for being adventurous and trying something other than Ihop or McDonald's for breakfast. Even though we didn't get stellar service, they enjoyed their breakfast here. I sure LOVED it! After eating top quality food at this restaurant, I would love to eat at French Laundry. Hmmm...I might have to wait to win the lottery.

Oh no! I'm the worst kind of guest. I came, I ate, I drank and I failed to send a thank you card.  I joined a group of fellow Yelpers for a Wednesday Happy Hour. (Jeff E. is awesome at planning Yelp unofficial events.) We rolled our way out fatter and happier.

THE RUNDOWN
+ Has TV? Yes. That's a definite yes! You really can't find a bad seat facing the mega-televisions that border the top of the bar.
+ Huge front patio (perfect for people watching!)
+ The food is over the top generous in size, flavor and character. 
+ Build A Burger is bananas 
+ Wide selection of beers on draft
+ Great for groups

SPECIALS
+ Happy Hour (M-F, 3-7): $4 Local Pints $3 Domestics $4 Prem Wells $5 House Wine & some $5 appetizers
+ Mon: $10 Build Mac-n-Cheese (unlimited toppings!)
+ Tue: $20 House wine & hummus platter
+ Wed: $10 Build A Burger (unlimited toppings!)

THIS BURGER BUSINESS
I like a good challenge. When I heard I could pile on unlimited toppings the game was on. I triple confirmed the pricing on Wednesday is a flat $10 NO MATTER WHAT. Like a speed demon I selected a bun (pretzel!), a protein (angus beef) and a cheese (gruyere). My pencil hovered over veges. (Yes to jalapeos and caramelized onions. No one to kiss that night. Boo! Hiss!) 

I heard someone at my table order avocados on the side. "Ooo! Good idea. Check." While in that section I thought, "Hmmm...what about an egg? You've never had an egg on your burger. WHY NOT?" 

[Shrug]
People. I hadn't been to the gym in three months. What's little bit of caloric love?

At Step Six I tossed in lettuce, tomato and mayo. I circled back and opted for some regular onions. (Again, no prince that night. I like a bit of crunch to my burger.) I topped off my rare burger with a tangy chipotle sauce and a side of sweet potato tots. (Interestingly enough you can top your burger with Steakhouse Herb Butter. How curious!)

God bless our server that night. I have to poll my friends to see if anyone can remember who helped us. She was the Shizzle. Patient, on top of our beer orders like a ninja and sweet as pie. We must have asked one thousand questions.

FIRE FIRE FIRE
While eagerly awaiting my mountain of food Jeff ordered "The Hell Fire Chips". I scoffed when I heard they were hot. Potato chips, buffalo sauce and blue cheese.  

My tongue thanks beer for its many healing powers. Speaking of beer, Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers was serving a Black Butte Porter at the time. I really hope they still have it on tap!

Back to the flame. Ursula had ordered something called TOT CHOS. Think of nachos, layered with chili, sour cream, guac and roasted pepper cheese sauce. Got that? Except the base is on tater tots! Also FIRE. A half order can easily be shared.

When The Burger finally rolled out my eyes opened like saucers. Cutting it with a knife clearly wasn't going to help! It wasn't pretty eating, but, oh boy was it yummy!

There were left overs. Good place. Fun!

Oh! Oh! Oh!
I just heard. The restaurant is still offering the same Yelp check-in offer. $5 off your order! GET IT!

She sells seashells by the seashore
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#72KODOc9wIrLiJCmEbU6Ew

30% off via Tix4Tonight deal of $2/person

Living out our inner Katniss & going through our "Hunger Pains", we needed something yummy to fill our tummies.  Not being in the mood for a burger or whatever fried crap available, we thought Thai food sounded good.

SEA:The Thai Experience is located back in the boonies of Bally's Hotel & Casino.  The cuisines served are both Thai & Vietnamese.  The ambiance was rather nice, with the center of the restaurant having a fountain pool with a Buddha statue, surrounded by wood tables.  On the periphery, standard tables to dine at, with a private area for large parties.

Being Vegas, we knew we shouldn't expect prices similar to the local haunts back home.  I was almost taken aback as to how much things were, but with 30% off, it helped sweeten the sour taste of overpriced food.

Lightly breaded calamari, fried to a nice texture, accompanied with sweet chili sauce.  Nice & chewy, these were really good.  I'm a big squid fan, and I enjoyed each fried piece from the sea.  

Pad Thai, with beef ($18)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#yUTLbpFitScqvHh75IGvBQ
Sweet, sour & filling, the pad thai had fair portions & was as good as any that I've had dining at my favorites.  

Honey walnut shrimp fried rice ($18)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#dUTI_D4Rxdqi6-iHIxXNUA
Winna, winna!  The highlight of our meal, the honey walnut shrimp fried rice  made me want to pop a wheelie in a Tuk-Tuk down Las Vegas Blvd.  Crunchy walnuts & bell peppers, a pleasing amount of deveined shrimp with a medley of vegetables  wok-tossed with seasoned rice.  The portions were great, and I relished this dish, since we only had appetizers for dinner the night before.  

Service was on the slow side.  The place wasn't too busy when we arrived, so I didn't understand why our food took longer than necessary.  Our drinks were kept filled & we had a nice meal, enjoying Thai music & the sound of falling water from the Buddha fountain.  

In summation, we had a nice Thai lunch at SEA:The Thai Experience.  Would I dine here w/o the Tix4Tonight deal?  Heck no!  Way too expensive for stuff that's 3 times more costly than restaurants I usually go to.  However, the food was good & we were happy.  Furthermore, the ambiance was a nice respite from the frenzy of the Strip.

Recommend with the 30% off Tix4Tonight deal

***There are some great things about Guy Savoy like the lobster with beets in cold steam, the great service, and the nice dining room, but like other Las Vegas restaurants, it is very overpriced***

Guy Savoy definitely reminds me of Joel Robuchon.  They both feature formal fine dining French cuisine from esteemed chefs and very expensive tasting menus and a la carte items as well as lavish bread carts and dessert trolleys.  The restaurants are quite different though.  Savoy has a minimalist and modern decor.  It feels much more elegant, comfortable and less distracting than the over-the-top and all over the place elegant decor at Robuchon.  Savoy also features much more personable service that is still professional and polite.

In terms of the food, it is hard for me to compare Savoy to Robuchon because I had a few a la carte items at Savoy while I had a tasting menu with many, many courses at Robuchon.  In terms of bread, Robuchon is better.  Both feature a wide variety of bread, but I felt Robuchon's bread had better textures as well as much more distinct flavors (Robuchon's bread was warmer and felt fresher too).

Robuchon's dessert trolley is significantly better than the one at Savoy.  Robuchon's lavish dessert trolley is an extravagant and over-the-top movable feast of sweets while Savoy is more of a small selection sweets on a nice tableside cart.  Variety is not the only reason why Robuchon is better.  The sweet treats at Robuchon have much better (and more interesting) flavors.

In terms of the food, I had really good things at Robuchon and Savoy but nothing as good as what I have had at Bay Area fine dining spots like The French Laundry, Cyrus or Manresa.

There were bright spots.  I really liked the lobster and jumbo lump crab with beets and cold steam from seaweed water.  There were great beet cups filled with creamy beet mousse and soft, fresh and moist crab.  There was also lobster carpaccio that was topped with minced golden beets; the beets had a great sweet flavor that was reminiscent of fruit.  There was also warm and nicely cooked lobster meat--fresh, moist and soft.

There was even puff pastry topped with beet ribbons.  The finishing touch was great seaweed aroma from the cold steam that enveloped the food (cool effect and great fragrance).

I also liked the mushroom brioche topped with black truffle butter.  The brioche was warm, buttery, crispy, and flaky (and the black truffle flavor was very prominent).  The accompanying black truffle and artichoke soup was just okay.

The amuse of foie gras with brioche was good--rich, creamy and a great foie gras flavor.  The pumpkin soup amuse was good though surprisingly thin.

Other courses were not as good.  The crab tart was just soggy and boring and I probably should have ordered the veal three ways as my entree.  They present the veal chop before they slice it and it was very nicely cooked--a great golden brown sear.

My entree was a variety of game birds cooked in a pot.  The cooking in the pot yielded tender and moist meat, but there were no contrasts in textures so the meats were a little uninteresting.  I thought the pheasant was good.  I thought the squab was good too, but I prefer it when they achieve a crispy skin on squab.

I was not a fan of the Mallard duck.  Like the squab, there was no crispy skin.  The flavor of the duck was very strong--interesting but not my favorite flavor.  The texture was off-putting.  The texture of the duck meat was squishy and a tad rubbery; it ended up being similar to the unique texture of squab.

The garnishes were good though a tad rustic for such a fine dining spot.  There was some good sweet and sour cabbage and wild mushrooms.  There was also a nicely cooked, buttery and smooth foie gras.

While the savory courses were a mix of good and average, I was not a fan of Savoy's desserts.  I ordered the coconut six ways and while I really liked the light and crispy coconut flakes and tapioca, I did not like the rest of the dish.  It was like various bland ingredients in water.

The mignardises from the trolley were okay; the pate de fruit was kind of hard and overly sugared.  The dark chocolate ice cream was rich and good though and I liked the flavor of the earl grey sorbet with English cream and black pepper. 

As mentioned, service was good; prices were too high, but that is often the case with high-end Vegas restaurants.

I did not love Robuchon, but I preferred it to Savoy.  There were some nice things about Savoy, but the food is just too expensive for just so many okay dishes.  I think your money would be much better spent on a dinner at an upscale Bay Area spot like Manresa.  If you do want a nice dinner in Vegas, I recommend the much more price friendly Picasso or L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (seasonal tasting menu).

Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Caesars Palace offers both free valet and self parking.

As of today, I have dined here 7 times - 3x dinner, 4x lunch.. witnessing various changes to the selection.

::: [ FLAVOR ] ::: 

Standard buffets seem to focus heavily on selection/quantity. Better buffets seem to focus heavily on selection, quantity AND quality. Wicked Spoon might lose in the selection department over others, but focuses on quantity, quality, & one essential but oft overlooked criteria: FLAVOR. 

::: [ TECHNIQUE ] :::

Due to preparation of large batches, many buffets (including Wynn's, which I haven't been back to in 2+ yrs) tend to offer food with less desirable textures due to being left out for too long and/or imperfect cooking temperatures, Wicked Spoon rarely makes that mistake.

::: [ PRESENTATION ] ::: 

Perfectly portioned little bowls/plates. Reduces chance of cross-contamination by other guests and things being mixed around on your own plate. Maintains presentation - consistency in plating technique is a 3.5/5 - 4/5 depending on the station & dish.

::: [ SERVICE ] ::: 

Only experienced poor service 2 out of 7 times. Yesterday's visit was excellent - our server randomly checked up on us at least 4 times throughout our meal.

::: [ DRINKS ] ::: 

Wine & cocktails are available. They also have a selection of Coke products, juices, & ice tea. Don't forget to ask for coffee when you're ready to move on to dessert!

::: [ DIET-FRIENDLY FOOD ] ::: 

I've dieted while dining here twice and was able to get extremely full on less than 700 calories. Also, SUGAR-FREE DESSERTS! You can also request a cup of berries from the dessert station.

The ramen scene continues to grow. Yes Monta Chaya, Monta's sister restaurant is the latest joint to open up. I've never tried their restaurant in Chinatown but I know it's very popular with both locals and tourists. So I was excited that they opened here in Henderson.   From the parking lot you won't be able to spot it but It's located between Japan Creek and Golds Gym in the strip mall on the corner of Eastern/Serene.  The sign for their storefront will be up soon according to one of the servers I spoke to. 

As with the other noodle houses, this place has sit table service. Your hostess will seat you at a table or counter. I chose their counter on this visit. Their furnishings reminded me of West Elm type stuff. The dark woods used makes the place look more stylish and gives it a more upscale feel. The seating arrangement didn't feel too crowded.  My server said they were so busy right before I came and that the lunch crowd had just left.

Server gave me 2 menus one with noodle  dishes and entrees and another that Monta Chaya serves exclusively. So you know I just had to try something off the Chaya Dishes menu.  I chose Chashu Bans (bahns). This one was glazed pork belly slice in a steamed bun. They come as 2 appetizer sized portions.

The Tonkatsu Ramen I ordered is just broth and noodles. I chose to customize with add ons they had. So there is an additional charge for them.  So keep in mind your order can add up. 

There was little wait from the time my order was taken to when I was served. When my order for the Tonkotsu Ramen came up, oh boy, I wasn't expecting such a huge bowl packed with noodles. My extras that I added were soft boiled egg and corn so my bowl was pretty full. 

The noodle soup was really good. The pork had just enough fat, the broth was savory. I personally thought it was just a tad salty and not as rich in flavor as the Tonkotsu broth over at the noodle house on Tropicana.  Still I enjoyed my bowl of ramen.  I asked if there is a smaller portion since this was way too much noodles for me.  My server said I can just request 1/2 noodles more broth next time. They still charge you the same price.
 
Service here was spot on. Everyone was friendly and polite.  Unlike the other Asian restaurant that recently opened up at the casino, the employees here are prepared and ready for the rush hour crowd. I'm lovin the ramen craze and welcome another one here on this side of town!

This review is based on hotel service and MANAGEMENT only (Manager Roberto and Pool Manager Chris) 

My brother, fiance, a friend, and I decided to stay at PH because my brother had a few free comped nights. We were there for 5 days (wed-mon) and was charged roughly $650. Pretty good deal we thought.

The day that we checked out (Monday), the bill came to $1500. Um, what?

We knew we messed up by using the wifi (13.99 per DEVICE), but there was no way it was going to be an additional $700 for wifi. When we went through the bill, we saw that there was a "Pool Bar" charge. We had NO idea what that was or what that meant. We went back to the front desk where Cecile helped us out.

She said the charge was from getting drinks at their pool. UM, what x 2??
We asked her what day was this because we only went to their pool ONCE on Thursday for like 30 mins and we never EVER went to the bar, just went there to tan. My brother had to work on the weekdays so he never even been to the pool. He had to work from the room. She told us it was on Friday. UM WHAT x 3?!?!

Cecile then told us she was going to call the pool and will get back to us when she talks to them. We left to the Miracle mall and received a call from Cecile 30 mins later. Came back to the front desk and she tells us, "They said it was YOU, you were at the pool and they remember you." Excuse me? Who is THEY?? Then she goes and ask, well maybe it was one of your friends who went. WTF? Definitely frustrated, she told us to step to the side and that she will have the manager come talk to us.

20 minutes pass and ROBERTO comes out from the back. There was another upset guest in front of us so Roberto was "helping" him first. Observing from the side, it was obvious that Roberto was one of those type of managers that was not willing to help you or hear you out. He even called security on the other upset guest. Whatever.

When it came to our turn, we explained to him why we were there. He did not make eye contact, just kept looking around and just basically NOT listening to us. We told him that Friday, NONE of us ever stepped into the pool. My fiance, friend and I were at Drais from 11am-3pm (where my fiance actually got HURT and we had to go to the hospital for him to get stitches. So we have proof that we werent there). My brother who was working in the room, had problems with the wifi, so he called for guest services around 11:30am and tech support came to the room around 330. He then left to go gamble downstairs from 4-6pm. The "POOL BAR" bill said that my brother was drinking it up from 12:35pm-5:20pm. THERE was NO WAY we were there.

After pointing this out and asking them to check the security camera and ALSO my brothers player card (since he was gambling during the time), Roberto then says he will have to call the Pool Manager to come down to talk to us.

We stood at the front desk for literally 1 hour. Roberto would pop his head out from the back room from time to time and ask if the pool manager came yet. Uh, no. 

FINALLY, a guy wearing a blue polo shirt steps out. He looks at us and so we ask,  are YOU the pool manager? He says yes. So this is CHRIS, the "pool manager". Having to tell him AGAIN what our situation was, he seemed a little bit more sympathetic. He looks at the bill and tells us, "wow, the bill was $500 and there was already an automatic $80 gratuity, but then there was an addtional $120 tip, that does look very sketchy. It makes me question if my employees are checking ID." In our heads we're like THANK GOODNESS someone understands. 

COMPLETELY WRONG.

He then proceeds to say, "But these 2 servers are my best servers and they're good people so I can't see them doing that". WTF? He then tells us hold on and goes back to where Roberto is. We can see the back door from here and for some reason they decided to close it.

5 minutes later they both come out and tells us, "Sorry, there's nothing we can do about this now. You have to just dispute it with your credit card." My brother then asked if he can get a copy of the pool bar receipt to see who signed it and Chris said they can't do that. He then leaves and tells my fiance "hope you're doing better". WTF.

Roberto then tells us again, they can't do anything about this now and that we have to dispute the charges. He grabs our bill and then tells us, "oh but let me remove some of this wifi charges for you." Ok, thanks for removing the wifi charges, but you can't remove the POOL BAR charge?!? Complete BS.

I've never been so frustrated in my life. They have security cameras, they can call the players card to check the times my brother gambled, they can call guest service to verify my brother called for help with the wifi, etc, but NOPE. 

WORST service ever and we will NEVER EVER stay here again.

Generous portion, flavorful food, first rate ventilation equipment over the tabletop BBQ grill, newest addition to the Korean restaurant scene in Las Vegas. Owned by one of the nicest and very successful local business owner.

Anyway, after watching a great Saints vs. Lions game, I decided I was going to drop by for some pho (saw Lily's quick tip), but saw the grand opening banner for Woonam Jung. (Opened since Thursday, January 5, 2012)

Wow, what a pleasant surprise after some many years!  So I had to come check it out, even though I am not that hungry.

The hostess showed me to a table in the front of the restaurant.  And I was greeted by probably all of the wait staff, or at least three of them, a few minutes apart ready to take my order (in Korean).

I tried a Galbi stew the last time I ate at a Korean restaurant, so I picked something similar to try here.  The Ugeoji Galbitang (Beef Rib Stew w/ Dried Cabbage) was flavorful and not too spicy.  The portion is large, easily sharable with 2 or more friends.  And it was served with steam rice mixed with some purple rice.

While I was having my dinner, the owner spoke to my after he was done with a business meeting with a member of the local Chinese newspaper.  I learned that besides the newly opened Woonam Jung Korean Cuisine restaurant, he also owns the Koreantown Plaza, the food courts in Greenland Market, Lee's Travel Agency, as well as, (and you can probably guess if I ask you what other business) Lee's Discount Liquor.

Mr. Hae Un Lee, is a first class and all around nice and engaging man, who told me a brief history of how he came to Las Vegas 33 years ago; opened his first Lee's Discount Liquor store 30 years ago and grew it into the massive business empire it is today.  The conversation is like a big cherry to top dessert treat for me.

Anyway, I will be back to try the Korean BBQ part of the menu in the next few days.  

--Update--

Came back for the Korean BBQ. Our group went with the seafood combination, which consisted of lobster tails, giant shrimps, calamari, and scallops.  If it is indeed 1 portion worth, instead of the 2x portion that we suspected it to be, then it is well worth it.

The non-prime marinated Galbi was delicious.  The most tender piece of galbi I have ever had the pleasure of eating, and it is thicker than what is typically served at other restaurants or what you can buy from Korean markets.  

Service was not as great as my first visit, but they were not slammed by the crowd of CES attendees using up their per diem.  Plus they were just wrapping up their first week of grand opening.  But I will still be back for more of the Galbi and seafood combination.

Service:  4.5/5  Very attentive. If you are Asian, you will likely be mistaken for Korean.  But their English is fairly good, so if your Korean conversation skills is nil, you will still get great service.

Food:  4.5/5  Definitely going up against the other well-established local Korean restaurants.  The food was tasty and the default spiciness level is very mild, and can be dialed up as requested.

Decor/Ambiance:  4.5/5.  Well lit, tastefully decorated.

Parking:  5/5  There are a lot of spaces on the side of Koreatown Plaza where Woonam Jung is located (between Pho Saigon and Tiffany's Coffee).

I really like this place!

Lunch here was unexpectedly good!

I had never ate at a Bobby Flay establishment before and was not really in a hurry to try.  Truth be told I've never really been a fan of his but, after reading several reviews of some trusty yelp friends I decided to give this place a try.  The resto is located in Caesar's palace.  The decor is warm but clean and open.  We came here during lunch with no reservation.  Waited about 15min and was seated near the kitchen.  Im realizing more and more that there are tables for 2 which I get but seriously can the tables be a little bigger!!!  I'm just saying!!

So after looking over the menu I remembered that everyone was raving about the tamales so we ordered that, and another appetizer to share and our main.

Tiger shrimp roasted corn tamale ~ First let me say the masa was very light unlike other tamales I've had.  The shrimp was plump and cooked perfectly.  The cilantro sauce was creamy but also very light and really brought the entire dish together.

Blue corn pancake ~ Barbecued Duck with Habanero Chile and Star Anise Sauce.  Holy moly I would have to say this was the star of the dining experience.  I never would have thought to sauce up duck with BBQ.  This was a fantastic dish.  

Smoked Shrimp Tacos ~ Skewered shrimp with Cabbage Slaw and Grilled Tortillas.  It came with 3 salsas to use.  The shrimp had a decent smoke flavor to it.  There was not heat to it although it looked like there could be.  To me it was just your typical shrimp taco.  Nothing too exciting.  The mango salsa with a bit of kick was really tasty.

Grouper ~ I only had a bit of it.  The portion was really bit and had great flavor.  It didn't appear to be dry which I don't care for when eating fish.

We passed on dessert since lunch already started off late plus we had other plans.  All in all I would have to say it was a pleasant experience.  I would not mind coming back here to eat.  

Eyes ~ Warm and inviting decor.
Nose ~ Even though we say near the kitchen there was not a smell that was present!
Ear ~ Not very loud.  Just your usual!
Mouth ~ Duck in BBQ sauce!
Tummy ~ Very well satisfied!

You have got to be kidding me!!!

What narcissistic nincompoop came up with this idea?

This has just topped my list of "Most Asinine Restaurants in all of Las Vegas." and my list of "Stay the hell away - far away!" at the same time.

3 people, no drinks, one order of tacos each (4) and a very small Queso Fundito appetizer for $75 - THAT'S SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS FOR A DOZEN STREET TACOS AND BLAND CHEESE!

First off, the restaurant is so cold I was shivering - AND I'M FROM FARGO 'FRICKING' NORTH DAKOTA.

The the Queso Fundito came to the table luke warm, which meant the cheese was already almost solid. We got the one with mushrooms, and they didn't taste bad, but cold Queso Fundito just sucks, period. It came with a spoon, which is absolutely the worst utensil to use when trying to cut semi-hard cheese.

Question: does anyone besides me remember when you could order your entire meal at the beginning and the kitchen would have enough sense to send out the appetizer first and give you some time before sending out the rest? Boy I miss those days. 

We ordered our appetizer, but weren't ready to order the tacos. The waitress kept coming by (without our appetizer) to ask if we were ready, so we politely ordered, hoping enough time had passed that our appetizer could arrive and we could have a few minutes to enjoy it before our small table was overrun by plates.

Boy were we wrong. Not more than 1 minute after the Fundito arrived, I got my tacos - just mine, apparently no one thinks people like to eat together anymore. So now my tacos are getting cold while I try to finish the Fundito before it turns back into a hard brick of cheese. 

The other orders came 5 to 6 minutes apart. These people are completely incompetent.

I will not say the food was bad, but I will say that Pepe's Tacos offers MUCH better tacos at 1/3 the price. 

This place is PURE SHIT, an absolute waste of a great location and an awesome remodeling by Red Rock. I can already see by the other Yelp reviews that most people agree. 

Pay $75 to have some tourist on the Las Vegas Strip slap you three times in the face, it will be a much better use of your money.

I have reviewed other In-N-Out Burger locations, so it seemed strange I didn't have a review for this location since it is the one I most frequent (at least once a week). Seems more like "creeper fishy" to me, but anyways. This location is my favorite. I have been eating here since it opened and have never once had an issue. Consistency is clearly something In-N-Out Burger focuses on. The inside is always very clean as well the restrooms. The line inside as well the drive-thru can be crazy, but it's worth it. If eating inside it is best to go in with others so you have someone to order and get drinks so the other can scout out a spot to sit. The booths are hard to come by at peak times. The parking can fill up too, but recently they have added orange cones so there isn't as much congestion between the parking area and the drive-thru. 

Everybody pretty much knows the secret menu at In-N-Out Burger isn't so secret anymore. I love that the menu is so simple. When you know how to make something right, you don't need a large menu. Hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries, shakes and drinks are what you will find here! For me this last visit (and pretty much every visit) I had a "Grilled Cheese W/Grilled Onions" (no lettuce) and it was perfect. Sometimes I get extra tomato, extra grilled onions or even ask that they add mustard. I also ordered "Animal Style Fries" and was glad hubby helped me eat them because it was a decent size. The chilies here are good and you can get them chopped on your burger or just on the side to munch on.  If you like to spoil your pooch then order a "Flying Dutchman" for them and they will thank you :)

This is really a 4.5 star review. I love Jersey Mike's! When I walked in there were plenty of smiling faces and friendly employees. The taste of the food is important obviously, but customer service goes a long way and this location delivers when it comes to both of those things.

When looking at the menu board I was having the hardest time deciding what to order. So many of the subs were something that I would eat. The cool thing about that is, there will be something new I can try out when I go back, so I could end up with a few favorites to rotate between. They offer a "Sub in a Tub" for those of you who do not like your meat between bread. You can just pick any sandwich on the menu and they will make it the same way they would on a sandwich, but put it in a bowl minus bread for you. They have a variety of "Wraps" to choose from. The sandwich sizes are mini (4 1/2 inches), regular (7 1/2 inches), and giant (15 inches) and the bread options are wheat or white. The bread is baked fresh at each location. 

One of the workers suggested "The Original Italian" since it was their most popular sub. It sounded delicious so hubby and I decided to split one of those. The giant for this sandwich was priced at $11.95 and then it jumped to $13.95 before tax with the addition of extra cheese. It had provolone, ham, prosciuttini, cappacuolo, salami and pepperoni. Jersey Mike's uses quality meats and slices it fresh right in front of you. I ordered it "Mike's Way" which means they add onions, lettuce, tomatoes, vinegar, oil and spices. The sandwich was very good! I will order this one in the future for sure. The flavors all melded so well together.

I was very impressed with the knowledge of the employees. The sandwiches on the menu that are numbers 43 and 56 have meaning. The number 43 is the football jersey of the CEO. Apparently he started working for Jersey Mike's (the original on the jersey shore) when he was a teen and ended up buying it later on and shaping it into what it is today. The number 56 is a nod to the year the first Jersey Mike's opened up.

Darden Restaurants has recently made a renewed effort to improve the offerings of their Italian inspired Olive Garden. 

We were so impressed, we might be back soon. Really. 

Given the likes of Macaroni Grill, Johnny Carino, Carrabba, Buca di Beppo, Spaghetti Factory (to some extent Margiano's), they have all been stealing market share away from Olive Garden, the so called king of Americanized Italian food. 

Tired of being a late night comedy punching bag, Darden recently made a wholesale upgrades to their menu and I believe brought out their "A Game". http://investor.darden.com/m/#deepLink/%7B%22view%22%3A%22PressReleaseDetails%22%2C%22languageId%22%3A%221%22%2C%22itemId%22%3A%225f329c57-9e8f-469a-8482-758db3cc9d1f%22%2C%22year%22%3A%222014%22%7D. 

If you have somehow missed the differentiation for some of these Italian themed concepts, both Carrabba's and Macaroni Grill aim for a higher demo group. And not a lot has changed over the last ten years since the Times wrote: 

"Carrabba's Italian Grill and Romano's Macaroni Grill, are both far behind Olive Garden in the full-service Italian restaurants... Although both chains are significantly smaller and are outspent by Olive Garden, they aim at a somewhat different customer: one who is willing to spend a bit more on a meal. Reflecting that higher-end positioning, Carrabba's and Macaroni Grill both used chefs to promote their brand." http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/25/business/media-business-advertising-spots-for-carrabba-s-macaroni-grill-try-pull-away.html 

Clearly there's no shortage of opinions regarding which one of these concepts are your favorite. http://www.disboards.com/archive/index.php/t-2641561.html. 

So with all this in mind, we decided to give this former Pillsbury concept another try.  

We arrive on a Friday night around seven-fifteen. Most of the families with small kids were just finishing their entrees. This restaurant actually has a section in the back, cordoned off from the regular patrons for families. Nice. 

We were seated pretty quickly. Our waitress Rebbecca greeted us, asked us about drinks and if we wanted water with our meal. 

One of their menu items, is a choice of six or nine ounce carafes of their house wines.  Rebbecca offered us a tasting from the bottle of Riesling she brought to our table. Clever marketing, very clever. 

We decided to share a 9 oz carafe, skipping appetizers and starting with their famous never ending Salad Bowl (see photo). It's still including in the price of your dinner btw, or soup if you prefer.

My friend Marvin A wrote about Olive Garden as...  "Their Dreck will not make you ill. It'll simply remind you ...... what BLAH Drive-In Dreck taste like. SpaghettiOs would of been a welcomed sight, last night." 

Prior to this evening's experience, we would have tended to agree.  

But the Italian Trio (photo) and Grilled Chicken (photo) were tasty and just as good the next day when we reheated them. LOL

In many ways, Olive Garden is still just a safe, standby type of place. But as you might have noticed, this is a Four Star review. Clearly Darden wants to be taken seriously and this is their best effort to date. 

So is Olive Garden better than Romano's Macaroni Grill, or Carrabba's? True-fully, I don't know. But we had a nice time and the food was good. 

So Four Stars and expect to pay around $30.00 each

EAT your heart out downtown! 5 Stars on my first visit because they are doin it and doin it and doin it well here.

I went on a weekday at 12:30 for lunch. Place was packed and I'm thinking I will never get in. The hostess said the wait time was ten minutes and I still thought yeah right. She is just saying that so I don't leave. NOPE. I was seated in less than ten minutes. Awesome.

Instantly I am greeted with menus and our drink order was taken. As a foodie I had only been studying the menu online for weeks now so now I play the game pretending to read the menu and waiting for my friend to decide. It was hard to decide because truthfully I wanted to try like five things. I settled on the grilled cheese and chips. 

GRUB: Grilled Cheese. Cheesy, buttery, crunchy heaven. It's on thick sourdough bread and served with a delicious, intense tomato soup. Dip that shit and find an instant happy place. Suddenly the restaurant didn't seem so noisy. The food was THAT good. My friend also enjoyed her grilled cheese just as much. We also ordered a side of homemade chips which were perfectly seasoned and crisp. Good stuff. 

On top of the killer food they also played some of my favorite music: The Killers, Xx, Vampire Weekend and Morrissey. I loved everything about this experience.

The only negatives I could see people having would be that it is very busy and gets VERY loud. It would be the perfect spot to fire or breakup with someone. Parking sucks orangutan taint, too. Mostly metered parking around, but I did find a side street with no meters. I am not use to carrying change around. This isn't LA, fools.

Overall I am in love with EAT. I feel like it was made just for me. I hope it succeeds and attracts more businesses just like it. More reason for all of us to kick it downtown.

Wow, where do I begin? I think this was by far the worst service I have ever received in a restaurant. I came with a group of 8 for lunch at 11am on a Wednesday. We had stopped by earlier in the day and made a reservation and we were looking forward to trying a new spot.

Our waitress (Liz I believe) was the only redeeming part of the entire incident that followed. (If I was rating her I would give 5 stars). Our food orders took an eternity and we watched all the people who had came in after us getting their food. Our waitress stopped by to warn us about the wait on the food, so we ordered some chips to tide us over. 

I ordered the Veggie Rice bowl (which was described as mixed peppers, squash onions, ect and either rice or pasta) I asked for no rice add  the Vegan Carne Asada.

What was brought out came in a to-go container that was about 1/4 full (think typical Chinese food container). I thought perhaps it was the side of carne and inquired with the waitress to see where the rest of the bowl was. (Where was the pasta, grilled veggies ect?) Did someone get hungry and eat it on the way to my table?

She came back with some guy who looked in need of a shower. He asked me what the problem was, and when I explained there was nothing here but the carne asada
 he got defensive and argued with me. There was no offer to bring the pasta, or add veggies. He basically beat on his chest, pushed a menu in my face and told me he was the executive chef "Joey" and that he would never order a rice bowl without the rice. I was astounded at his aggression and rudeness. If I owned this joint he would be out of a job. This is no "House of Tricks" buddy, it's a bar that plays lunch spot by day and your pompous attitude earns no merit badge.

Some other highly medicated looking guy came by later and asked me what the problem was and basically chuckled when I told him and asked if he could do anything. I was afraid the "executive chef" Joey would spit in my food so I declined, I couldn't get out of that place fast enough. Liz apologized and you could tell she honestly felt bad about the exchange. 

I will never come back to this place and I'll  tell everyone I know to avoid it. I've worked on Mill 15 years and have seen hundreds of restaurants fail over the years, I know this one won't last. Not with the absolute insolence and discourtesy they assault their customers with. 

(And they charge $5 bucks for chips and salsa - GET REAL)!

WED, MARCH 27, 2013 // 12:00PM-2:00PM 
                 PRICE FOR 2: $63.98 (TR price) + $5.18 (tax) + $10.84 (tip) = $80.00

                 SERVER: DAWN - (4/5). She looked frazzled but always made time to check up on us. Asked me if I wanted more Peachy Tea when I finished, refilled our waters, & brought us 2 carafes when we asked for coffee.

                 SERVER: IRANDA - (1/5). We had to chase her down 3x, she ignored our table completely. When we asked for coffee, she brought us 1/2 empty cups (spilled coffee all over the saucers). VINCE (4/5), not our server, was friendly, paid closer attention & cleared our table multiple times.
_________________________

Bacchanal can be overwhelming since there are a LOT of dishes to choose from. Between Bacchanal & Wicked Spoon, if you only have time for one and care more about the selection - go to Bacchanal. (Save room for the CREPES!) 

THINGS I CRAVE: 1.) Lasagna, 2.) Prime Rib, 3.) Crepes, 4.) Machaca, 5.) Posole.

Personally, though, Wicked Spoon still wins in just a few minor areas: a few key dishes that are well executed, bone marrow at dinner, and smooth creamy gelato as opposed to the grainy ice cream at Bacchanal. It's also slightly less expensive, less crowded, and comes with much more consistently reliable service.

CONSENSUS: Would try to make time for both on my next trip to Vegas - Bacchanal for lunch, Wicked Spoon for dinner.

Tucked away in the strip mall, this small Cuban bakery has been overlooked and undervalued by many who don't frequent the area or knows very little about the cuisine. Once inside, there are only six small tables. The red tablecloths, glass dessert counter, tiled floors, and bright natural lighting coming through the doors nicely accentuated the dcor. Fellow Yelper Kurdy S and I were the only non-Spanish speaking customers during this afternoon. Like many of the nearby restaurants, the atmosphere was fitting as a casual lunch spot.

For appetizer, we shared the Tostones Rellenos de Roja Villeja ($4.49). The plate came with four fried green plantains holding a small scoop of tender shredded beef on top. The plantains had great texture on the outside to add to the soft green banana flavor on the inside. The beef was tender, flavorful, complex, and very nicely seasoned. I can eat these all day long.

We also had a side order of Plantanos Maduro Fritos ($2.49) that came with soft bananas served piping hot, perfectly fried, and sweet. It was nicely glazed, but also unexpectedly oily. 

Next, the Cuban Sandwich ($6.95) came with shredded beef, ham, and mustard. The bread had an awesome crunch with an excellent secondary chew. The sandwich was big enough to share and the dish also came with French fries. The way they kept it simple without all the fillers made this one of the best Cuban Sandwiches I've had so far.

Finally, the Filete a la Plancha ($9.99) came with a big serving of grilled sole, black bean rice, and salad. The sole was fresh, moist, tender, and had good flavor but slightly over salted. The black bean rice had great flavor and moisture--much better than the one at Victor's 1959 Caf. The lightly dressed salad provided a nice change of pace to the sole.

Antithetical to the cuisine's longstanding stereotype of being bland, this place simply rocks. Service however, was friendly but also inattentive, offbeat, and at times awkward. For instance, the food and bill took forever to come, and our water was never refilled even though the restaurant was not busy. Despite the shortcomings, interested diners should still come for the impressive lineup of dishes and great prices. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their other seafood and chicken items followed by their great looking desserts.

Jjanga is AYCE for $25.95
Jjanga is new and not busy
Jjanga has excellent service
Jjanga is a good pick if you're looking for some Yum Yum Rolls. 

I'm not a sushi snob, but I do prefer Sashimi's and Nigiri over rolls.  It's been forever since I've had a Yum Yum Roll.  For some reason, I was craving these California Rolls drenched in mayo. It's been awhile. It's been a very long time.  So, when the gf suggested sushi for our Valentine's Day dinner instead of our usual steak dinner, I couldn't help be get a little excited about it.  

From the time we walked in to the time we left, we had nothing but excellent service.  The team at Jjanga can sure teach a few other sushi restuarants out there about customer service.  They know what's up and they knew how to treat me and my special lady.  Good Job, Jjanga!

My Items:
Mells Roll:  This was my first roll of the evening. How could I not get this roll, right?  Inside was crab and shrimp.  This roll has a spectacular name, but was just okay when it came to taste.  
 
Jjanga Burrito:  This is a hand roll with shrimp, broccoli tempura, and crab wrapped in soy paper.  This was actually pretty good and great light option if you're looking for something that isn't going to weigh you down. 

Jackpot Special:  Jackpot!  I think I found the king of all Yum Yum Rolls.  This one had shrimp tempura on the inside with spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and of course a ton of mayo sauce on the outside.  If you're going to eat bad, might as well get this. I probably could have gotten two of these rolls. 

Freshman Roll:  This had everything...tuna, salmon, and crab.  Wrapped in rice paper, my taste buds were a little confused on what it was tasting because there was so much going on.  But I still thought that this was good.  

Teriyaki Chicken w/Brown Rice:  What was I thinking?  The brown rice wasn't the best and the chicken was a little bland even with Teriyaki sauce. My bad...I shouldn't be going to a sushi restuarant expecting great chicken. 

Regarding their food, I only had 4 full rolls, their Jjanga burrito, Teriyaki chicken, and Green Tea Mochi.  Needless to say, I was stuffed.  I thought that the sushi was fresh, the rolls were tight, and all were packed with taste.  Bottomline, the food is fresh.  On my next visit, I will probably go back to Sashimi's and Nigiri's because that's what I prefer.  But from someone that doesn't frequent a Yum Yum Roll, I recommend this place. I

PS:  They got the same rolls as Sumo. So if you're a fan of Sumo, then you'll be a fan of Jjanga.

Cue Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue", because the curtain just went up yesterday on a new Five Star food experience!

For most Chicago food lovers, Portillo's holds a special place.  Yes, there are several hundred Italian Beef and Char Dog places up there.  But it was Dick Portillo and his family who first capitalized on turning Chicago comfort food into a culinary science.  Then they made it into a destination stop with all of the visual entertainment of their theme restaurants.  Very simply, the food was very good and it was a fun place to go.

This Portillo's is no different.  Here they have a 50s/60s Retro Theme.  As I waited in line last night, it was more like a carnival atmosphere.  Of the nearly four hundred ahead of me, there was ne're a raised voice or a sad face. Everyone was laughing and telling stories.  

As you entered the restaurant after forty-five minutes to an hour outside, and then realizing you had another forty-five minute wait inside -- you looked around and saw nothing but a sea of happy, satisfied customers chowing down on their favorite food.

I was ordering for three, since I had two hungry somebodies waiting at home for my food delivery service.  For myself, I ordered the Big Italian Beef wet ($5.95) with sweet and hot peppers giardinera ($0.90) and Mozzarella ($0.50) and a Jumbo Hot dog ($2.99) with everything on it.  Boy, did if goof.  The prices for the food are outrageously fair and reasonable.  Heck, I left thinking they got my order wrong with all the food they gave me. 

Their beef sandwich was nearly a foot long and I needed to cut it in half.  There was no way any human being could finish something this big and I didn't.  The amount of beef on half, was more than double what I have had in the past at any other restaurant! They could have easily sold my half sandwich for the $5.95 that I paid.  My jumbo dog was also very good, but I should have ordered it charred instead.  It was worth the wait, everything was delicious.

The other items on my family's order, were two Beef 'n Cheddar croissants for $5.25 each, another Jumbo Dog with an order of large Fries ($2.19) and onion rings ($2.09), along with four hot giardiners ($0.45) and one pop.  Our total came to $35.95, including taxes and could have easily fed four.  As I said, I goofed and over ordered by a mile!

Other items on the menu that we didn't try are: the 1/3 of pound Char Burgers for $3.95, or the double for $6.19. They also have a Halibut  or Tuna sandwich $5.19, and a Veggie Sandwich for $5.35. Portillo's is famous for their Garbage Salad which is $7.69.  They also have a Chicken Caesar for $6.59.  Their Shakes are $2.69/ $3.39 and Malts $2.79/ $3.59. For something completely different, they also have Tamales $1.89 and a Tamale in a Box for $2.99.

In Yelp-ese, a Four Star experience is "Yay! I'm a fan."  A Five Star is "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"  Before tonight, I would have said Portillo's was a Four Stars. But NOT after this evening.  To even the toughest critic or curmudgeon, they would have to admiit that this is as good as it gets!  Five Stars.

Enjoy!

I had this place bookmarked after seeing several delicious looking pictures being posted on yelp. Hubby and I decided to come here for dinner and we left full and satisfied. The beer here is brewed on site and has won several awards at the Great American Beer Festival and The World Beer Cup. Did I try any beer? Nope! Another visit I will though ;)

We sat in a comfy booth in the dining area. Our server was very nice and checked on us often and went over any questions we had. The menu had so many good choices so hubby and I decided to pick out 2 different things to share. We ordered the "Buffalo Chicken Wrap" priced at $10 and the "South Side Cheese Steak" priced at $10 with a $3 up charge for the substitution of onion rings instead on fries.

Buffalo Chicken Wrap - The chicken tenders are handmade and tossed in hot sauce then put into a tortilla with lettuce, tomato and chipotle ranch. I asked them to leave the lettuce out. The chicken was all white and cooked perfectly. The whole wrap would have been good to me if the hot sauce wasn't on it. It wasn't hot at all and tasted like straight up vinegar. The portion was great and the fries that came with it were delicious. I asked for a side of ranch to dip my fries in and the ranch was cold, thick and delicious. Hubby thought the wrap was OK, but this isn't something I personally would order again unless is was minus the funky vinegar flavor. 

South Side Cheese Steak - This has beef with peppers, mushrooms, and onions, with their our own signature beer cheese sauce. This sandwich was just delicious! The steak was tender and flavorful, the peppers and onions cooked just right and the beer cheese sauce makes this sandwich a match made cheese steak heaven! The onion rings were beer battered and yummy! I could easily just eat a plate of the onion rings!

Happy Hour is daily from 4 - 7 pm. HH is only available in the beer garden, loft and lounge according to their menu.

While there we noticed a promotion for "Slot August Nights" where you can stop in and enter to win a 1966 Ford Mustang! You can enter at their other locations Magoos, Loose Caboose, Golden West and of course here at Chicago Brewing Company. Just ask your server for details.

After an evening of nonstop Vegas-style partying, the only words I managed to utter from my dry raspy voice the following morning was...water please!!!

In addition to replenishing my body with much needed liquids, I was feeling mighty peckish, as well!  After much deliberation, our group decided on a calm & relaxing sit down Saturday brunch at Thomas Keller's Bouchon. 

Located on the 10th floor inside the Venetian, the restaurant embodied what I've come to expect from a fine French bistro. The vibe was chic & refined yet relaxed and unfussy.  There were comfortable banquettes throughout the main dining area as well as outdoor seating in the patio area. We were subsequently seated inside. At 12:00pm, the sun was beaming from the patio, so our location filtered the intense light perfectly, which suited me and my solar sensitive eyes just fine. 

Complimentary house made jam was magnificent! The jam is freshly prepared each day and depending on the chef's mood, a different flavor variety is served. Today, he was feeling strawberry, which is my personal favorite! They served us an Epi baguette to share and it was fantastic, as well. Warm, buttery crust with perfectly chewy texture. Coupled with the soft butter and sweet pucker inducing jam, it was a match made in the stars.

The entrees were orchestrated perfectly as we didn't have to wait long at all.

Chicken n waffles - The waffles were made with bacon n chives and sourdough batter. It was airy and crisp with a lightly sweet flavor and a savory finish. It was so good i almost forgot to use the syrup!
The chicken was roasted perfectly and it was insanely moist & tender! The chasseur wine sauce was rich and flavorful with an alluring aroma. Some of my guests enjoyed the savory flavor so much they poured the irresistible sauce over their waffles, too!

Pork belly was fatty and incredibly flavorful and juicy.  Accompanied by the creamy hollandaise sauce, it was absolutely delicious!

Corned beef hash was phenomenal! Well seasoned pieces of corned beef mixed with all the traditional fixins that will impress any die hard corned beef hash purist!  Trust, this was far from canned! 

Short rib was tender, the fontina cheese was fragrant and the whimsically tiny jingle bell peppers added a pleasant little kick to this fantastic dish!

Beignets were served fresh out of the oven but they were quite dense and tasted more like doughnuts IMO Overall, they were very moist and with the added raspberry preserve filling, they added a sweet finish to our savory entrees.

Our service throughout the meal was very consistent with coffees, water, and juices always filled to the brim.

By the end of the meal we were absolutely stuffed!  But I didn't mind at all :D

My friends and I had a wonderful time and it was great feeling totally replenished and revived with good quality food that was masterfully prepared with fantastic service to boot. The strong coffee didn't hurt either!  I'm not quite sure if this particular location was ever awarded a Michelin star but IMO Thomas Keller deserves praise for a dining experience that was unpretentious, comforting and very enjoyable!

When we all left, I was sated, 100% refreshed and ready to take on the world, well at least another round of partying :) 

Hey, it's Vegas for crying out loud.

Happy Eats!

Had the most Mind blowing Experinece here!

This place rocks!  Seriously they have hundreds of gems, fossils, rocks etc etc. I wish they were closer to get to.

So my friend Dawn R. who flew in from Portland for the Yelp Spring Break had been looking for 6 gems for a Feng Shui thing in the living room.  Everything on the internet was just a online store and not a business that you could walk into.  When it comes to gems and minerals you want to hold and see.  Think about a diamond for example.  Wouldn't you rather see it and touch in person before buying!   Well the Yelp Ap came to the rescue again.  

This place is on the outskirts of downtown and easy to get to.  I wasn't sure want to expect since there was less than 10 reviews but WHOA when we walked in it was like DAYUM.  They have A LOT of stuff.  They have the place organized by the minerals, gems and fossils in the front.  When you go to the back you can find even more minerals, gems in all type of sizes and shapes and even a sections of beads.  Another smaller room where they have Buddhist statues.  I was totally impressed with the amount of items this place carries.

I personally was not looking for anything in particular.  I was looking at some pendulum and I tried out a few.  There was one answering me even when I was not holding it so I getting it.   I also purchased a Moldavite http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavite.  Something I had never heard of until that day.  I was curious to know more about it and Miguel was the one who took the time to explain what it was and how people use it.  Being that I had by Reiki 1 & 2 done and he was a Reiki Master and had also done theta healing I knew exactly what he was talking about in terms of energy work.  I could totally feel the warmth from this one gem from holding it in my hand.  I felt like what one may feel when having a hot flash.  It was pretty odd how this little gem was giving off that much energy.  There are only 3-4 mines and it is estimated that it will all be gone in the less than 10 years so I thought I should get one.   So I picked a pendant http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jMrpr92nMEhe4cC4FF00VQ?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#hddvoHue4g2iC-Tv6KuvRA and a chain I like and put it on.  The pendant sat right between my heart and throat chakra and I could immediately feel the warmth in my chest area.   

Now this is when things got interesting.  As we were checking out, Miguel had left to the back room to grab a bag for my pendulum.  When he returned he told me to put out both hand and close my eye.  Hmmm that is a strange request but I obliged.  He then put a good size spirit quartz in both hands and told me to hold on an feel.  I seriously never ever ever felt so much energy and vibration coming from gem before.  It was so intense my hands were shaking.  It shot up through my arms and straight to my chest and was pounding right were the Moldavite pendulum lay.  I was totally speechless and all that came out of my mouth was Oh Shit, Oh my goodness, Oh Damn Oh my god etc etc.   A minute or so into it Miguel proceeds to share with me a message from my spirit guide to not be so hard on myself and to take things slowly and to take my time.  With the massive energy and vibration going through me and what I was hearing I teared up big time.  This was so unexpected and a great surprise.  It was one of the most amazing experience I had in a store!!!  Now this is not to be expected with every person that comes in but I was totally opened to it and was ready for it and so I welcomed it.  Freaking amazing.   I was feeling that energy pretty much all day, it was freaking great!!!! 

Anywho, if your' looking to buy a few pieces for feng shuei or maybe even by a Moldavite and you happen to be visiting sin city you have got to stop by this place.  It's a gem of a place!

Locale ~ Downtown 
Offerings ~ Gems, Minerals, Jewelry, Statues
Extras ~ Ask for Miguel,  He is very knowledgeable and helpful!

After my outstanding experience here, it goes without saying that Wolfgang Puck's take on steaks is a "cut" above the rest!

Tucked inside the Palazzo resort, Cut exhibited a refined contemporary appeal and warmth that was both inviting and comforting.  I especially enjoyed the service by Tara who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. 

After allowing us to peruse the menu for awhile, she returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts and I must say, they all looked enticing! 

Shortly after, we were served our wine and breads, which included the usual steakhouse suspects of fragrant & savory onion focaccia, pretzel roll, one of my personal favorites, mainly because of the firm outside texture and soft and chewy inside... and it wasn't too salty like most other pretzel breads I've come across. 
Parmesan bread stick took a close second  place for its addictive light, crisp & crunchy texture with a generous coating of Parmesan breading on the outside.

Bone Marrow Appetizer - From the buttery soft marrow to the warm, flavorful mushroom sauce, it was a blissful combination of ingredients and love. Simply unbelievable. If there's one single dish from this entire trip, I will be craving for months afterwards, it will definitely be this!

Steak Tasting 
American Kobe Style from snake river - paired with a house steak sauce. The beef was perfectly tender and seared beautifully leaving my mouthwatering for another juicy bite. The tangy flavor of the steak sauce was a perfect addition to the meat as it brought on a bright acidity to the steak. Let it be known, I'm determined to get the recipe for that irresistible sauce!!!!
USDA prime dry aged - much softer and juicier than the New York, this cut of steak was praiseworthy in every way. Honestly, it was a cut of perfection on a plate and the accompanying chimichurri sauce added a brightness to my palate that made it all the more satisfying. 
Australian wagyu from Blackmore -
Worthy of it namesake, was truly the best of the best. It's like they took 50 steaks and concentrated all the beefiness into one bite. The best steak I've ever had. It came with a barnaise sauce but honestly this piece needed nothing to dress it. It was perfect all on its own.

White corn had a fresh & crunchy bite with a slightly sweet caremelized exterior that added a pleasant rustic flavor to the dish 

Dessert
Baked Alaska - Tasted like a giant strawberry mochi. Btw, that's a good thing!  It also came with a small lemon bar, which had a lip puckering natural citrusy flavor!

Banana Creme pie came with chocolate ice cream, sauce, and chocolate crunch pearls. Now that's what I call a triple chocolate threat! Having said that, It was surprisingly mild and less cloyingly sweet, which I really enjoyed.

Before we left, Tara gave us more sweets in the form of a chocalate truffle cookie bar and a chewy peanut brittle...both were absolutely delicious! 

Service was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. But i'd have to say Tara made all the difference! She transformed a pleasant meal to an unforgettable dining experience with her natural charm and warm tableside manner, which easily made the evening five stars in my book!

Bravo to CUT for an exquisite meal and extraordinary service! 

You bet ill be back for an encore! 

Until then...

Happy Eats!

Dona Maria Tamales Restaurant has been a local family owned business in Vegas for over 30 years. I ate here a few times growing up and didn't like it so when a friend suggested that hubby and I meet for dinner here I was hesitant, but figured why not give it another shot after so long. 

We were seated next to the bar (bar was dead) and service was very good. We were started off with the usual suspects... Chips & salsa. The chips were good however the salsa had no kick at all and was very sweet, almost like it was just a can of thinned tomato paste. Gross! 

All dinners are served with a soup or salad. I chose the "Tortilla Soup" and it actually didn't taste bad. I ordered the #29 "Taco and Enchilada" priced at $13.50 plus an additional $2.15 because I wanted carnitas in my taco. The beans and rice that accompanied my meal were either under a heat lamp for too long or reheated. The beans were crunchy and hard around the edges and the had no good flavor. The rice was pretty much the same. The green sauce on my enchilada had great flavor it was just that the enchilada itself wasn't that great. It was edible, but the tortilla was stiff. The carnitas had good flavor, but again I wasn't crazy about the tortilla. Our friend ordered the #14 "Chile Relleno and Enchilada" priced at $13.50 and they thought it was decent. Hubby ordered the #27 "Fajitas Dona Maria" (beef) priced at $14.75 and said that he's had better.

I wanted to try the "Churros" priced at $5.50 for dessert. It was presented well, but all of the cinnamon sugar was on the plate not on the churros. These churros were very dry and not worth a penny. 

Though I have no plans to purposely come back here, I did give it 2 stars because the service really was very good and I did enjoy my soup. I believe they try hard to do something good here at Dona Maria Tamales Restaurant, it just isn't good enough for me.

They claim to be knows for their "Tamales" and even though I haven't tried them here, I have heard from people that they are worth picking up. Prices are $3.95 each, $14.25 for a half dozen, and $19.25 for a dozen. They offer the following tamales:

Red - pulled pork in a mild sauce
Green - shredded chicken in hot sauce
Cheese - monterrey jack, green chilies and onions
Sweet - pineapple and raisins ($3.30 each)

My wife and I have been to Brio in Tivoli Village and Town Square for happy hour, lunch and dinner many times over the yrs, sometime with our friends, too, and always have good experiences. 

This evening my wife and I went for an early dinner. The pleasant hostess took us to a nice and quiet corner table. The dining room was not crowded, yet, so was pretty quiet, although the bar area was hopping, as the patio was a bit too cold, even for the tough young crowd. Our server, Kim, was very friendly and helpful, and got our beer orders (Blue Moon, $5.25) started immediately. Good thing she did that for us, too, because the barkeeps were kept super busy by those happy yuppies, who "never seem to have to work!"  Boy do I envy them!  ;-)  
The wait staff quickly brought us our favorite bread basket with warm and delicious rolls, which we enjoyed over our beers. And I started feeling great!

BTW: Brio's STILL  DON'T serve Blue Moon on DRAFT, yet, only in a bottle! SIGH! 

For dinner, my wife ordered the "Sliced steak salad" (15.95), and I had the "Mediteranian shrimps" (15.95). Both were delicious! The steak was tender and juicy and in good quanty; shrimps were cruchy fresh and very tasty! Their presentations were quite appetizing - I totally forgot to take any pics of our dishes, being distracted by our hunger and discusions on our travel plans for 2014! Trust me, our dinners looked good! 

Our sweet server Kim (no, she is NOT Korean) was attentive and pleasant; her crew was efficient, keeping our water glasses full, and putting our finished dishes discreetly away. Kim also did us a great favor, taking the time to straighten out the mistakes with my Brio's reward account and honored my $15 reward credits - very nice of her!

During our dinner, the hostess (perhaps also mgr) came by to say hello, and later helped the waitress out with our check. [i.e., taking it to/from the cashier, but NO, she did NOT really help out with the $Check, You Silly!]  ;-)   - A nice business practice! 

The Brio brand is characterized by its reliable, good italian style cuisine of VALUE; spaciousness, comfy ambience; vibrant bar scene; excellent service. Hmm...table cloths also add a touch of elegance. Of course there are other comparable restaurants, but I think Brio stands out in ITS CLASS. 
- My friends say, it's like dining in a "Mid-Upscale" restaurant at Olive Garden prices. 

For me, the Brio's in general and this locale in particular is one of the places I would go on a whim for happy hour (their $4 tasty small plates, Wed Martinis...are hard to resist at times) and/or for a tasty meal - NO SURPRISES!

A 5-star rated restaurant on Yelp is very hard to come by but leave it to the tourists, or wait, better yet, the locals, to lead you in the right direction when it comes to good food in Vegas. 

Owned by Chef John Lee with his wife who also runs the dining area of the restaurant, the place seems to have something note-worthy going on. The quality of the ingredients they use are phenomenal, not to mention the exceptional freshness and grade of their fish. Like many, I value service that's genuine and efficient as well as a price tag that doesn't hurt your wallet as much. This place has it all.

ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA ($9) started off our meal with 3 dipping sauces that accompanied it: wasabi aioli, sweet banana sesame, and garlic ponzu. If there was one dip we fought over who gets to lick the last bit of it, that'll be the sweet banana sesame. 

SNAPPER w/ UNI ($13) initiated our cold sashimi orders. The presentation was so beautiful that all we wanted to do was stare at it. The inevitable was bound to happen and gladly we savored each bite appreciating how the uni did not overpower the snapper. Delicious!

SALMON WASABI CREME ($11) was highly recommended by our server and we took heed since we are big salmon fans. Clean flavors with a climax on the wasabi creme that sang melodiously altogether, this was easily my favorite out of all the sashimi dishes.

YELLOWTAIL YUZU SOY ($12) was served with "compliments of the chef" says our dear server. It was after all one of his most popular dishes and I completely understand why. The tempura serrano, cilantro, garlic oil, ponzu, and garlic dust all worked harmoniously for the benefit of the fish. 

BIG EYE TUNA POKI ($15) which was a special of the evening had a lusciously melt-in-your-mouth texture that only proves how fresh the tuna is. A much bigger portion compared to the sashimi dishes was a plus.

MISO MARINATED BLACK COD ($18) was cooked to perfection and was probably the best thing I ate here. So much for sharing but I'm getting an entree all to myself next time. Buttery yet flaky, black cod to me is the version of a grade-A Wagyu steak in fish.

TUNA TADA ($2) would be poki tuna on a tostada shell topped with avocado and cilantro. The contrasting textures of the crunchy shell to the tenderness of the fish and creaminess of the avocado was superb. For $2 each, can I have one more please? 

SOFT SHELL CRAB ROLL ($9) seemed to be popular but this did not wow me in presentation, however, looks can be deceiving and I'll say it was very good. My daughter will vouch for it, too but I'm sure the spicy version of this is much better.

FIRE CRACKER ROLL ($9) was my least favorite as it had cream cheese in it. Not their fault, just my preference. This had spicy tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, sweet onion, then deep fried. Everyone else enjoyed it.   

TWIN DRAGON ROLL ($15) won me over despite how stuffed I already was at this point. All the dishes we shared between 4 people but we all can't deny this roll was truly something with Alaskan King crab, spicy tuna, avocado, and tempura shrimp. Without a doubt this was the best out of the three rolls we had.

MATCHA TIRAMISU ($7) ended our meal with a sweet note. Green tea soaked sponge cake and matcha sabayon topped with whipped cream were all there was to it but let your imagination run wild as to how heavenly scrumptious this really was. 

Leaving us with a lasting impression, this entire meal kicked-off our weekend in Vegas with a bang!

Five of us had dinner at The Carlton last night and it was a wonderful dining experience. 

For appetizers we had: 1 jumbo lump crab cake, 1 beet salad, 1 lobster and crab gnocchi, and 2 house salads. The Jumbo Lump Crab Cake which I ordered, was meaty with crab and was very rich sitting atop of Julianne vegetables. The Dijon Cream and fresh herb sauce it came with was just delicious. The gnocchi was tender and mild which allowed the lobster and crab to predominate the flavor profile. It was served in a Spinach, Caramelized Onions and Tomato-Ketel One Cream base. Very tasty indeed.
Salad eaters, house and beet, all said they were great as well. These were all very good size appetizers so you might save some for taking home if you plan on heavy entrees and tend to fill-up fast.

With the appetizers we also finished off two lemon cream martinis, one sour apple martini and one Grey Goose on the rocks with a twist, and one Arnold Palmer (AP refills aplenty). All drinks were made well. The had a nice martini list, a pretty good wine by the glass list and a full wine list which comes out on an iPad. Pretty cool approach. I am not counting but they say they have over 500 wines on the list. Enough to match any taste or meal. Later for dinner we wanted some rich, creamy full mouth Chardonnay so the proprietor suggested Sonoma-Cutrer for us. This was delicious and great match with our food.

Dinner entrees were hard to choose from the extensive menu which includes some great daily specials which they say usually change every day. Sticking with a theme, I went the seafood route all night and choose the Florida Grouper which was prepared oven roasted and was fresh Parmesan crusted and served with Lobster Pierogies, Spring Vegetables and Roast Garlic Butter. Oh my was this meal ever rich and tender. The Grouper was completely melt in your mouth fresh and tender, and I exaggerate not one bit. The Pierogies were moist, tender and full of lobster stuffing and it went so well with the Grouper. Boy this was a satisfying choice.
 
Three people, were enticed by the 14 oz. medium to medium rare Prime Rib. They all came out looking absolutely beautiful. Jody who is the real Prime Rib  connoisseur said that his ranked up with the best of them. Jody has traveled and lived or visited may cities for extended stays.  He has lived in Las Vegas so he had the opportunity to eat a Lawry's Prime Rib several times. To which I can say when I ate there with him a time or two, and I thought it was the best I ever had. So that puts The Carlton up with the best prime rib places in our judgment.
Linda went for the Ahi Tuna entre, which she said was extremely fresh and tender with the fabulous Tuna flavor one seeks in the best sushi. But it doesn't come naked. It's preparation is fresh Wasabi-Panko crusted with the Ahi Tuna seared rare and served with Curry-Coconut Orzo, Asian Greens, Hearts of Palm-Julienne Carrots and Yuzu Butter. This was a beautiful and tasteful preparation. Had enough to bring home and it served as a special breakfast this morning.

I have to say that everything was really outstanding at The Carlton. Topping it off with some personal service, Kevin Joyce, the owner stopped at our table to see if we were enjoying or meals.  Have to hand it to Kevin, his professional staff, and especially Executive Chef Mark Swomley who has been there for 16 years. The Carlton itself has been around for 27 years which I think is a real testament to its enduring quality and service. You can not go wrong here.

Normally during Thanksgiving my mom and I go over to my sister and Tom's place to have dinner.  This year my sister wanted to mix it up a bit.  They really wanted to go to Mexico, but it's peak season there so cost was an issue and the whole beheading tourist thing was not optimal.  Viva Las Vegas!!!

Service - 5 Stars
Cleanliness - Excellent
Price - $40.00/person for dinner.
Seafood - Yes, mussels, shrimp, crab, fish
Meats - Yes, chicken, pork, beef, turkey
Vegetables - Yes, salads.
Dessert - Pastries, gelato, cookies, etc.
Fruits - Yes
Other - (1) Located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel, (2) Cash and Credit Cards are accepted here.  (3)  Be prepared to wait so I recommend coming early.

Buffet Summary:

The Meats - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 stars) - I tried the lamb, prime rib, turkey, and bone marrow.  The lamb was excellent--very moist, tender, and flavorful.  The prime rib was really good too--perfectly cooked.  I really liked that they liberally let you have as much horseradish as you want since I love to slather my meat with the stuff.  The turkey is pretty standard and is good with cranberry sauce.  The unfortunate thing is that is cranberry sauce was extremely light and did not add much sweet & tangy to the white meat.  The bone marrow was the least to be desired--extremely oily and felt I was eating fat leftovers.

The Seafood - A-Okay (3 Stars) - I had cod, shrimp cocktails, Cajun shrimp, crab legs, mussels, and sushi.  My favorite is the shrimp cocktail and mussels.  The shrimp were all a nicely sized even though there was only 2 per cup.  Shrimp tasted perfectly with the cocktail sauce--perfect amount of sauce per shrimp as well.  It is the morning afterwards and I wish I had another plate of mussels.  What is great about this dish?  It's all about bacon bits.  I'm not talking about bacon bits from the bottle.  I'm talking about bits that you could fling and take out somebody's eye.  Every bit of the mussels were tender and the pairing with the fatty and moist bacon got me all shooked up.  FYI - the sushi section is quite embarrassing.

The Dessert - A-Okay (3 Stars) - My soon to be brother in law said "The dessert section looks dangerous."  If most of you know me, I do not have a sweet tooth--sweets ARE dangerous to me.  However, maybe it was the desert (or dessert) air that made me want some sweets.  Amongst the cheesecakes, cookies, chocolate covered strawberries, and pastries ... I chose the gelato.  I chose mango, biscotti, tiramisu gelato.  The server gave me three medium jawbreaker sized scoops per flavor.  The biscotti and tiramisu were good.  The mango had the taste and consistency of mango.  The sweet fix was over.

I'm a season veteran to the buffet league and after a while everything seems homogenous.  Wicked Spoon does have several appeals though--sexy ambiance, free flowing water, and tapa-style individual portions.  The un-appeal is the wait--it took us +1 hour to get in.  Whichevers, it was Thanksgiving Day so I guess that is expected.  Wicked Spoon is A-Okay.  Happy Thanksgiving Yelpers!!  I've finally made it to 100 reviews.

NIGHTMARE ON FREMONT ST

My driver dropped me off at the hotel in the back and when I say driver I received a ride alone in a short bus from the airport. I was staying in the Carson tower and when I walked in I was informed to go to the Carson tower registration. 

So I started walking through the craziness of a Vegas Casino. Maneuvering around tired people who are drinking a lot and losing too much money. They are like rats trapped in a box for 4 days and 3 nights and are in no hurry to go anywhere. But I pushed on and made my way past the mayhem while dragging my suitcase to get to the Carson tower for check in.

When I arrived at the Carson registration desk there was a sign that said Desk closed. Check in at the Rush Tower. What? So now I had to go back through the mayhem again. I pushed through and when I got to the Rush Tower there was a sign that informed me to check in at the Gold Tower registration because the desk was closed. What?

At this point I felt like there were hidden cameras laughing at my every move. I took a deep breath and decided to look for the Gold Tower registration. I asked the lady running the high roller Keno room and she pointed me to the VIP check in door. I knew this wasn't correct but I was frustrated and I was going to make it work. 

So I walked in with my frustrated face and informed the staff of my wild goose chase I had just been on. I also dropped the Keno ladies name because it's always good to drop a name. I believe they took a little pity on me but the staff was very unapologetic to my dilemma. They were also very unfriendly and it was probably because I wasn't a high roller VIP. I did ask them if it's normal to send guests on a scavenger hunt to check in and they looked at me like it wasn't a big deal. I then asked if they were going to fix the incorrect signs and they told me no. After 10 hours of no sleep and traveling I had no more fight in me but I do know this was wrong. 

Upon walking to my room I finally walked past the open registration desk for the Gold Tower. I will say this was a frustrating way to arrive at a hotel. 

So I get into my room and start unpacking my bag. I then go to the bathroom to wash my face and realized someone had used the bathroom. Yes someone sat on the toilet seat, used the toilet paper, unwrapped the soap and used a clean towel. I'm too exhausted for this. I called down and spoke with the front desk. I also asked if I could be moved to a new room. Of course my request was denied and a maid was sent up to clean my room. A housekeeping manager walked in and told the maid to clean my whole room including the sheets. She was actually nice and hard working. So I left my room for an hour to let the maid do her job. 

Day 2...I wake up early and leave to get my work day started. When I arrived back 4 hours later my room wasn't clean. I spoke with the maid in the hall and she said they would clean my room by 1pm. She even wrote me on her list. I came back to the room at 2pm and it wasn't clean. I called Housekeeping and they said they would send someone up. I got back to my room at 5pm and it was still dirty. I called and spoke with a manager who promised to take care of it and my room was finally cleaned at 6pm. Honestly is it that hard?

Day 3...It was my only day to sleep in and the maid bangs 5 times with the vacuum cleaner even though I had a "Do Not Disturb" sign on my door! Was it necessary to ram my door that many times? It was just rude. She knew what she was doing. 

Day 4...The room was prepaid by my client but for some reason the hotel decided to charge my credit card. I called down to the front desk and they were no help. The girl on the phone was rude and unhelpful. Then when I went downstairs that same girl was there. She was mean to me because of our phone call. I asked her to only see a copy of my bill. She printed me a bill with my credit card charged. She then slid open a drawer where she had her personal cell phone and started texting. This was incredibly rude & why would you do this in front of an upset customer. I did snap a photo of her displaying this unacceptable behavior. I really believe the staff needs to go through a hospitality travel course because they don't get it. 

The hotel staff doesn't have any good customer service. The employees seem unhappy and it translates into the bad customer service I received. In all of my travels, I've never seen a more incompetent  staff, then here. 

On another note: the room was nice. I was expecting dirty old gross Vegas but that is not what I received. The casino was very modern. The pool had a shark tank in the middle which was really cool. You could even water slide through the middle of the sharks. This place wasn't what I expected. It's just sad that the customer service isn't there. I score hard on being treated nice and the Golden Nugget failed on every level.

So I guess Imperial Palace is now QUAD RESORT & CASINO. But, it's the same place. Please read my review of IP before reading this review. You can find it right over here:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/imperial-palace-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas#hrid:PmcM2qPVlg96fjp2d6ut7g

And I just want to add, about 5 months ago I got into a fight with that bald headed boob(I think his name is Kevin or Carl), who is the manager of this place. He literally told me that "YELP SUCKS" and even taunted me to write a bad review. Let me explain to you why this fight occurred:

One of my friends came to town and decided to stay here because of the cheap room rates. She lived in West Hollywood most of her life, so she felt comfortable in this atmosphere. But, even West Hollywood can't compare to the f*cked up shit you find here at IP. Just to let you guys know, there was 2 assaults and what might have been a robbery or attempted robbery here on the same floor my friend was staying at. Like I mentioned in my previous review, for the last 2 years there has been a network of thieves who take advantage of the "door defect" that most of the doors here at IP have. The doors have a slight defect where they don't close 100%, and you actually have to slam the door twice to fully close it. The thieves know about this defect and due to the fact that IP has no security guards in front of the entrances to their towers, these thieves have been running this cycle for years. Read all the reviews on IPs page, many of the reviews are from yelpers who fell victim to this network of robbers. While visiting my friend, I actually saw the guys this time. They attempted to try to trick me and pretend they were just guests. They said "hello" to me while they suspiciously walked down the hallway. Both men had New Yorker accents. A few minutes later a lady runs down the hallway telling me that those guys entered her room and then ran out when they noticed she was still inside. The hotel manager is a total rat.  The guests who were almost robbed asked the guy to at least comp their stay and the manager literally tells them: "we don't comp for that. It wasn't our fault." He then tells the guests that the hotel management is aware of  the door malfunction defect and he even went out of his way to show her a small sign that read: "we are not responsible for the door not closing". What this means is that the hotel managers are all cheap motherf*ckers and won't put in the extra cash to fix the defect on the doors. When I was going back to my friends room, the moment we got out of the elevator there was a group of college kids getting the sh!t kicked out of them by more weirdos with New York accents. Now, my friend didn't want to stay here anymore. I asked that bald boob at the front desk for a room change and he practically tells me to f*ck off.  

I saw my 2nd assault of the trip at the Pet Stay area. A family was walking their dog to the pet area and some d-bag threw a glass bottle off their balcony at them. The security guard never showed up. 

Here is the most interesting part... The managers let me know that they think "Yelp is a joke". When I told them that I would write about this on Yelp, he started getting really sarcastic and said that Yelp has no effect on there business. He expressed that no matter how many 1-star ratings they get on Yelp, problem gamblers from out of state will always choose IP because they save money on lodging which means they get to have more money for gaming. 

There is probably like a 90% chance that something like this will happen to you. For example: You will go down to the poker room to play some cards. When you come back to your room, you notice your door is open. You find your daughter  tied up in the closet, badly beaten. Your wife's neck is snapped. Your oldest son has been thrown off the balcony onto Carnival Court, and no one noticed because of how loud it is. Your youngest son has been abducted and is already being sold to a Thai brothel who will force-inject him with female hormones in order to make him into a transgendered child prostitute. At that moment you will start to think to yourself: "Maybe I should have listened to that weird Tetsuro guy on Yelp, or at least listened to all the negative reviews instead of trying to save $10 a night!"  But, then you decide that you need to rescue your son and avenge your family, so you head off to Thailand and use your special forces training to fight the gangsters that took your son to find out that it was those Australian guys from "Human Nature" who were behind it all along. And all this happened cause you decided to stay at IP for the week.

Currently, I've actually decided to film a documentary style video about how dangerous, filthy, and disgusting IP is. In Feb I get 2 free nights through Total Rewards, and while I'm staying there I will document the door defects and hopefully capture one of the many assaults on video. I will upload it on my youtube channel.

A fellow yelper suggested this place for lunch and I had been wanting to try it so she made reservations for us. At first when I walked in I noticed they were packed so was glad a reservation was made. I was seated at a half booth half chair type of table. I never mind these but in this instance I felt cramped. It kinda seemed like a space that was left over and they decided to cram 2 more seats into a corner. If the table were larger it would have made a better difference. I just know next time to request a different table since this one seemed like the only one like it.

The lunch menu was short and simple but had something for everyone. I decided to order the "Grilled Barely Buzzed Cheddar Cheese" that was accompanied by a cup of "Crushed Pea Soup w/Bacon Lardons" priced at $13. I was so pleased with it! The sandwich had such great flavor and I kept wanting more. The pea soup was simply delicious. I can't say enough about how much I liked this and I will for sure be back to order it again! The server was nice and kept checking on our drinks and how we were doing.

They have daily specials and I noticed they offer a kids menu. Some places offer you a mint or root beer candy when leaving but Honey Salt had salt water taffy! There is a fun guestbook before the hostess stand you can sign. If you feel like eating at the bar you can sit there and order from the menu as well but if there are any happy hour specials I didn't see any posted but there is a TV.  There is tables and chairs outside if you are wanting to enjoy the day should the weather be pleasant.

When I saw their signature Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles platter on a Las Vegas television show one night I knew I had to try this.  As my buddies stopped into the Imperial Palace casino to throw away a little more cash I decided a mid day feast was in order.  I imagined this place would get pretty crowded, but at 4:30 in the afternoon on a weekend this restaurant was surprisingly empty.

My buddies later told me they were concerned that a huge meal a day before the marathon would hamper their performance.  I'm a slower runner than they are though so my only concern was to finish the race and have fun doing it.

Back to the restaurant I was greeted and offered a seat at the bar or a table.  I noticed an attractive vixen sitting alone at the bar so I decided I was going to go there and offer her a bit of companionship.  As I sat comfortably into my seat I couldn't help but notice this dainty young lady was eating from two giant platters of food.  She acknowledged my presence, turned to me, smiled, greeted me and told me she's a dancer and hadn't eaten all day.  Don't mind my stare, lady!  I'm not checking out your perfect physique, but I do have an eye on the humongous burger on your plate.  Wait!  Do all showgirls eat like this?

I finally picked up my menu.  They offer fresh squeezed fruit juices in 10 ounce and 20 ounce glasses so I went with a fresh tangerine juice, but I'm sitting at a bar, and how does one not have a beer when they're sitting at a bar?  I selected a Pyramid Apricot Wheat Ale (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=I1ZZCzT_lKHJ_YthVtc-Cw) and ice water knowing all to well I needed to stay hydrated for the run ahead.

I took a quick glance at the food menu although I knew exactly what I wanted to try the minute I walked into the restaurant.  I selected the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  The service here was outstanding.  Every time the bartender left his station he'd return and give me an update on my food.

I had a crappy camera with me at the time, but this is what I had (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=BagiL1VmvJTeDz_CIsty3w).  It's two huge chicken breasts partial bone attached battered and fried and sitting on an angle atop four squares of bacon-stuffed Belgian waffles drizzled in hot maple syrup.  That's right.  The waffles are stuffed with crispy bacon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=t2IoUrYE-c7cIHRBxkk6ow)!

The weight of the two chicken pieces quickly gave way to gravity as they fell onto the plate.  The chicken breast was amazingly juicy and the crispy batter was well seasoned.  The waffles were fluffy and chewy and I hadn't even gotten to the crispy bacon yet.  This signature dish definitely lived up to its hype.  This was outstanding.  I had to sit awhile after nearly finishing that entire platter.

The dancer did better than I did taking what little food she left in a to-go box.  As she turned, smiled and bid me farewell I couldn't help but notice how gracefully she walked out the door.  I was so stuffed you might have been able to tip me over on my side and rolled me out the door!

Las Vegas dancer or not, this time next year at 4:30 in the afternoon I will be back!

***Jose Andres' China Poblano in the Cosmopolitan Hotel scores a mediocre score of 3 stars on Yelp, but I found all of the food (I had two of their savory courses and 1 dessert) to be good to very good***

China Poblano features a mix of contemporary Mexican and Chinese dishes.  Some dishes are gussied up with contemporary cooking techniques or high end ingredients while other dishes veer more on the fusion side.  

I started with one of their tacos--a carnitas one topped with guacamole, fresh lime and chicarrones.  I thought the fillings were great.  The carnitas was moist and tender.  It was also nicely seasoned.  It had a good flavor and wasn't too salty (which happens a lot with carnitas).  The guacamole was cool and refreshing and it was a great contrast to the warm and savory carnitas.

The chicarrones were crispy and light.  The soft corn tortilla was fine, but it wasn't a good vessel for the meat juices.  The only problem with the taco was that it was too wet.

I also has the twenty vegetable fried rice and it was very good.  The rice had a nice soy flavor, but it was not too salty.  The vegetables provided great contrasts in textures, but with that many vegetables, which were cut up into small pieces as well as paired with a flavorful rice, the individual flavors of the vegetables were (as expected) kind of lost.

Still, there were a lot of vegetables including fresh greens, crispy sweet potato, haricot verts, squash, turnips, carrots, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, and watermelon radish.  There were also proteins like soft tofu and scambled egg.

For dessert, I opted for their flan and it was very good.  The flan was incredibly smooth, creamy and light like a panna cotta.  It was topped with a great cajeta gelee (rich caramel flavor).  There was also cajeta ice cream (incredibly dense and a great rich caramel flavor).  The plate was garnished with good pineapple, which was not too tart.

Service by the bartender Victor was excellent; he was incredibly personal and helpful with the menu.  You could tell he really wanted all of his customers to have the best experience possible.

Prices are not too bad considering that it was Vegas.  The fried rice dish was under $20 and it was a very generous portion.  Some portion sizes seem small in a few dishes when considering the prices (like the tacos), but it is still a better value than the many overpriced Vegas restaurants serving just so-so food.

In terms of the decor at China Poblano, the bar gives you a view of the chefs making the dim sum.  There is a main dining room, but I wasn't a fan of the tables (they kind of looked like what you would find at a gourmet order-at-the-counter spot).  Overall, the decor was forgettable and not that great.

I thought the food at China Poblano was good.  The food was pricey, but Vegas food tends to be pricey and there are places in Vegas serving much more expensive food that is not nearly as tasty or refined as what you can get at China Poblano.  I think China Poblano is a good spot for an upscale lunch.  And since the same menu (with the same prices) is featured at dinner, it is a good spot for a nice dinner with a more casual approach and more reasonable prices than the many overpriced high-end dinner places in Las Vegas.

I believe the Cosmopolitan offers both complimentary valet and self parking.

Tradition. 
Comfort.
Value.

These words best describe our dining experience at Lao Sze Chuan on opening night. The value here was surprising! Every dish we sampled was priced very reasonably, if not competitive. The dishes we tried were served in the perfect sized portions to share between 2-4. My boyfriend and I actually took home 2 bags of leftovers by the end of the evening. 

Right away, I immediately noted the modest presentation and culinary style of master chef Tony Hu. It's a breath of fresh air to not be confronted with nibbles of expensive, weak and flavorless rabbit food. It's also important for me to note that the chef is not reinventing the wheel, he's just putting his spin on classical Szechuan dishes - fine tuning it to his culinary expertise.

We received top-notch service from start to finish. Every member of their well trained staff made us feel extra cared for. We were curious about one of the dishes we tried and one server took his time to explain to us, in detail, about the Szechuan chili and how different chilies cause different effects to the palate. He was articulate and eager to share his knowledge of the cuisine. 

I'll also quickly note that the ambiance was classy and blanketed in a swanky, modern pan asian decor - but that's what we all come to expect from a Vegas casino restaurant. Let me just put this out there - dress code is not strictly enforced. 


Here's what we tried:

//Cold spicy cabbage// complimentary 
The cold, crisp cabbage had a medium spice that tickled our nostrils and tastebuds. We enjoyed the spicy, slightly sweet and addicting crunchy texture so much that we immediately ordered a second round. *pro tip: as addicting as they are, wait to eat them with your dinner! This paired very well with the rice and the rest of our dishes. 5/5

//Chongquin chili oil wontons// (6 wontons) $5.95
We savored the expert layering of sweet, spicy flavor and also admired the striking ginger flavor infused into the chili oil. The Szechuan chili peppers pleasantly tingled and numbed my entire mouth, making it such a unique dining sensation. I only had 2 minor annoyances: the wonton wrappers were not as luscious and soft as I would prefer; they were actually hard and a bit undercooked. The same could be said about the wonton filling; a little lackluster and dry. However, the winning aspect of the entire dish was the sensational and flavorful numbing chili oil sauce. *pro tip: make sure to save the remaining chili oil and pour it over your rice! 4/5

//Sliced tender cold pork marinated in garlic sauce and chili oil// $6.95
This dish was presented exactly how we expected - glistening ribbons of cold, thinly sliced pork. The pork ribbons were buttery soft and marinated in a mouthwatering garlicky chili oil flavor - but the dish is not at all oily. Keep in mind, this dish is not saucy and had mild spice. 5/5

//Lamb with pure cumin// $15.95
A dry (not saucy), stir-fried dish with a gorgeous deep brown color, red and green bell peppers, whole Szechuan chili peppers (not spicy in the slightest, but great smoky flavor), jalapeo slices (not spicy at all), garlic, and onion. Pure cumin is the precise way to describe the overall flavor of this dish. The lamb was generously coated in the warm cumin spice and was extremely bold and aromatic. However I can't emphasize it enough, this dish was lacking spiciness altogether. Also, I personally thought the lamb was a bit too chewy and tough, yet my boyfriend felt that the lamb was expertly prepared and was as tender as it will ever be - two different preferences and views on an arguably tasty dish. In the end, this fact remains - the lovely cumin spice complimented the gamey nature of the lamb very well. 4/5
*edit: just had the most divine (leftover) lunch! The lamb marinated even longer with the intense, flavorful cumin seasonings, making it 100% more tender and flavorful. These are a solid 5/5 now! 

//Eggplant in garlic sauce// $11.95 
A traditional dish with familiar flavors. However, it was a sultry celebration of a classic dish, namely because they selected the most perfectly ripe, plump eggplants and gently cooked them in effort to retain their lovely firm texture and to keep their beautiful shape. They were insanely juicy, sweet and buttery. Also, the sauce was super silky, swimming with an abundance of wood ear mushrooms and crisp pickled cucumber. I couldn't stop eating it, even well after I claimed I was full. 5/5

All minor issues aside, my boyfriend and I absolutely enjoyed our dining experience here; our dinner was satisfying and comforting. We are looking forward to returning soon, in hopes that the small setbacks we encountered were just a case of the opening day jitters. 

I applaud master chef Tony Hu and his World-class staff and wish them continued success.

Pro tip: Grand opening 25% off your entire bill with the discount card that can be obtained at the hostess desk. Expires 10/15.

We wanted to BBQ since it was such a gorgeous day outside, so I suggested we give The Butcher Block a try since I had seen such good reviews on yelp. 

I was not disappointed! The Butcher Block is family owned and operated and offeres a wide variety of meats from U.S.D.A. Prime Beef, U.S.D.A. Prime Dry-Aged Beef, Wagyu Kobe Style Beef , Homemade Sausages, just to name some! If you want something on the wild side they offer Gator, Quail, Venison, Elk, Rabbit and plenty of other woodland creatures. Seafood isn't my thing, but they had a good looking variety of stuff including live lobsters and blue crabs. I'm amazed that they had so much to offer for a tiny shop. One thing I noticed was "Jalapeno Bacon" priced at $8.99 each. Compared to what it costs at the grocery store that isn't bad for good quality bacon.

After looking over the selection and wanting pretty much everything, we decided on a few different things to try. I wish I could remember the name (I think porterhouse?!) of the 2 steaks we bought, but I can't. I do know both steaks together cost $35.81 and were worth every penny! I picked put a rub priced at $5.99 for the meat and the steaks just grilled up so nicely and the steak melted in my mouth. We also picked out a "Petite Bacon Wrapped Filet" priced at $5, "Mushroom Caps W/Homemade Sausage" priced at $1 each, "Mini Bell Peppers Stuffed W/Homemade Sausage" priced at $1 each, "Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Jalapenos" priced at $1.50 each and some "Hot Italian Sausages" priced at $4.99 per pound. 

The mushroom caps stuffed with sausage were decent as the peppers stuffed with sausage, but it was the bacon wrapped stuffed jalapenos that were an awesome flavor explosion in my mouth! I was bummed we didn't get more than 4 of them. The sausages were full of flavor, but not too spicy and grilled up perfectly. The petite bacon wrapped filet is the perfect size and price for the smaller appetite. Perfect for spoiled pooches too! I was very pleased with everything and will be stopping here at The Butcher Block more often.

You can also stop by to pick up a sandwich for lunch because they have Boar's Head meats and cheeses! What The Butcher Block is currently charging for the meats and cheeses per pound is too much compared to where I get it at a store near my house. I do think the prices for having them make you a sandwich with the Boar's Head meats and cheeses though is reasonable. The man who helped us behind the counter was very helpful and inside the shop was very clean.

Ok..... Unlike any other yelp reviews I've done I will keep this shorter than usual but as serious as possible......  hmmmm.......

Sterling Brunch is gotta be one of my favorite buffets in all North America.  (Taiwan has some awesome ones but Yelp is not there yet)

Sterling Brunch is located in Bally's Las Vegas and is only available on Sundays from 9:00am - 2:00pm (Typically by reservations only but you may get lucky)  

They got the typical buffet fare ranging from various seafood, poultry, steaks, desserts.  Here's the list:

Seafood:  clam, mussels, salmon (sashimi/cooked), oysters, lobsters, fatty tuna, Uni, king crabs, and  Cavier!  (So the sashimi is flown in from Japan weekly, Lobster are baked half of a 1-2 lbs lobsters, and Cavier is all you can indulge!!!  with those little blintz to go with it! YUM!)

Poultry and Steaks (meat):  rosemary roasted chicken, prime rib, rack of lamb, filet mignon, beef wellington, Beef Oscar (fancy!)

Dessert:  lots of melt in your mouth heavenly desserts that you simply cannot miss out on any of it...

Extras:  Lobster omelet, Gazpacho soup, fresh fruits, other seafood prepared cooked such as seafood Bouillabaisse, etc...

Had my favorite server "Eduardo"!  Awesome guy who worked at the Sterling Brunch for 30 years.... really nice guy who actually prepared us a seafood extravaganza on ice while we get our food!  Tipped Eduardo really good afterwards as he was like the best server we ever had!  (by the way you actually get 2 servers one helps you with everything else the other one make sure your drinks are always topped off perfectly!  Simply awesome!)

Of course.. with a meal like that.. it took us 3 hours to finish but of course that was enjoyed slowly....  Man.. lots of lost lobsters in my stomach and stuff.....Just way too much good stuff...........

Oh oh... get this.. while at Sterling I got this guy who was in front of me wanting Cavier... so when he got some from the nice little Japanese lady who was serving the fresh raw seafood he kept asking for more....The lady wasn't angry or anything but instead, took his plate, opened up a brand new like 120oz of cavier and literally slapped on top of the plate.... In a very nice way!!!  Everyone was floored when they saw that and the big man was a "VERY" happy customer....Seriously.. that Japanese lady was so nice she gave me a bunch of UNI after that as well!  LOL!  Shout out to Eduardo and Little Japanese lady...

Finally... forgot to mention... you want water... it's all Evian only.... FREE!  Then champagne is also complimentary.. which they served only Pierre Jouet!!!  WOW!!! I'm in heaven yelpers!!!  (That was also the reason why we were there for 3 hours.. had about 5 bottles of PJ for about $50 per bottle.....)

The cost is about $85 without Tax and tip.... but I'm telling you... BEST MEAL I'VE HAD EVER!!!!!!

Sterling Brunch.... I can't wait till the day we meet again..................

Jinya, whatever culinary wizardry you got going on in the kitchen, keep it up! My tastebuds thank you. 

Jinya reawoken my love for ramen in Las Vegas. Granted, I've only had the chance to try Monta so far, I can quickly say that I preferred the (less saltier) ramen at Jinya. The broth was wonderfully delicate - It's not a condense, salty, ghastly rich and difficult to digest broth like Monta's. (But hey, if that's your thing? Just not for me.) I'm typically an advocate of strong, punch-you-in-the-face flavor, but something about that broth at Jinya kept me sipping and savoring the quality ingredients of the comforting broth. 

I can understand that some may feel that the lighter at broth at Jinya is unfavorable. However, I have to argue that if you feel so inclined, you can always add dashes (or tablespoons) of the delicious bottled ramen seasoning and thick spicy sauce that is conveniently sitting on each table, in order to adjust the boldness of your ramen broth. You have control of customizing the flavor of your ramen? I'm down with that! Honestly, my boyfriend and I didn't go crazy with the table-side ramen seasoning - a few dashes will set it off just right. Enjoy savoring that broth, close your eyes if you need to. It's actually more wonderful than you can even imagine, when you take it all in with the perfect bite: some broth, a little bit of noodles, some seaweed, some corn (if you added it), some chashu, etc. and slurp away! It just hugs your tastebuds and your belly. 

Here's what I recommend: 
- Jinya Tonkotsu Black ($10.55) - 2 slices of pork chashu+ kickurage+ green onion+ nori dried seaweed+ soft boiled seasoned egg+ garlic chips+ garlic oil+ fried onion+ thin ramen noodles. Yeah. This is the broth I was talking about when I wrote my love story above. The thin ramen noodles were perfectly cooked, al dente. The soft boiled "seasoned egg" is ultra luscious, silky, and also cooked perfectly. All of the components in this ramen were meant to be eaten together. I truly enjoyed the delicate nuances of garlic in the broth, it was not at all pungent or artificial tasting. I also feel that the toppings I chose were perfect for this ramen- 

Toppings added: 
- Corn ($1) - I love corn and I love corn in ramen soups! It adds a lovely pop of texture and sweetness with each slurp of the broth. Highly recommend. 
- Fresh Garlic (FREE) - They bring out a small jar of raw garlic cloves that have been soaking in water and also provide you with a metal hand garlic press. You can freshly press the garlic yourself and adjust how much garlic you want in your soup. The garlic flavor is very smooth and not aggressive, because the soaking method removes a lot of the pungent, spicy, bitterness in the plain raw garlic. It really enhanced the garlic flavor in the Tonkotsu black broth and brought the ramen to a whole notha' level. If you're are a garlic lover, I highly recommend! 
- Extra Pork Chashu ($2 for 2 pieces) The chashu here is indeed buttery, but there is also a good amount of enjoyable, tender, meaty substance - unlike the flimsy fatty chashu that just disintegrates into the broth at Monta. 

We also tried:
- Jinya Bun ($3.80) - Daaaym! that pork belly is buu-tter-yyyy!!! That pork belly is what makes the bun unforgettable. The toppings and the sauce were on the simple/weak side, so I can't necessarily say I need to order this every time I come here. But I would definitely recommend this for first-timers to enjoy that expertly cooked, buttery pork belly.  

- Takoyaki ($4.80) - Philip T. didn't joke around when he said it was one of the better versions (if not the best) takoyaki in Vegas. It came out hot, plump, juicy, and it even had cooked egg white chunks (egg salad?) in the mayo! That was totally unexpected and added such an amazing texture and unique flair to the beloved classic. Take your takoyaki ball and just run it along the plate to pick up any (and all) of the takoyaki sauce and chunky mayo sauce - sounds weird, but that's how it was meant to be eaten! The octopus inside each ball was also cooked perfectly, moist and extra tender. 

Not only was all of the food we tried satisfying, I was also really diggin' the ultra sexy vibe and bossy decor here. Plus, right when we walked in, their amazing song playlist completely captured my attention. They played back-to-back-to-back jams that were right up my alley. I'll admit it - I used SoundHound the entire dinner to figure out what exactly was playing, since I needed to add it to my playlist. I can only recall 1-2 places in my entire life, where the music really set an amazing mood for dinner. I'm so happy to report that Jinya was certainly added to my list as one of those places. 

I am relieved they are open late until 3 am (!!!), in Vegas it's necessary and a step above all of their competitors. They also have a ramen/ Japanese tapas drive-thru coming soon! No way? That's crazy! I can't wait until next time!

We stayed at the Renaissance for a week, and couldn't have been happier with a hotel.  It starts off with the staff.  Everyone we encountered was very friendly and outgoing, and you knew they were willing to do anything you asked to make your stay happy.

The rooms were also very nice, being both spacious and including all of the amenities you would want.  A nice television, a big desk, refrigerator, an in-room safe, comfortable beds, and most importantly to me a shower with tons of water pressure.  And all of the rooms have wonderful views, depending on which way you're facing.  Our view was the US Airways Center, Chase Field, and the mountains in the background.  (Not sure if technically they were mountains. But they were beautiful anyway.). It was very cool to always know that when you looked out the window you were either going to see the hustle and bustle of downtown life, or the serenity of the landscape in the distance.

As far as food options, there is Marston's Cafe and the Icon Lounge.  We never had a chance to eat at Marston's, but we hit up the Icon a few times.  That will be covered in a separate review.  This will also cover Marston's, since all of the food is prepared in a central kitchen and the menus overlap somewhat.  There are also tons of local food options within a block or two of the hotel.

The fitness center is a bit on the small side, but there are a few ellipticals and treadmills, along with some free weights and Nautilus equipment.  It's enough to get the job done when you're on the road.  There's also a huge outdoor seating area with tables and chairs, along with couches, to relax and enjoy yourself in the fresh air.  This is also where the pool area is located.

So why only four stars?  For one, the prices.  You can get a good deal on a room, but the prices of everything else is where they will get you.  And definitely be wary if you have a rental car, because on-site parking is $27 per day.  And then there is the issue of the elevators.  If you had to be in the lobby at a certain time, you had to give yourself at least a 10-minute headstart, if not more.  And definitely pay attention when you hit the down button.  You'll notice that it will go out on you when you're not looking, and no elevator will be heading your way.  And it will happen again, and again.  After the first couple of days, we realized the easiest method of getting to the lobby was actually catching an up elevator, and then riding back down.  And everyone else figured this out as well, so when elevators did actually show up, sometimes you had to wait three or four cycles for one with room in it.

I know that's a minor gripe, but when you're taking the elevators multiple times per day over the course of a week, it does get frustrating.  If they ever get the elevator situation under control, I could easily see revisiting up to five stars.

I don't expect this to go anywhere, especially given the level of customer service (or lack thereof)  I received this past weekend at the SLS Las Vegas. Nevertheless, I feel the need to vent so here goes.

I booked a 4-day stay at the SLS in order to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday as well as to ask her to marry me. I had heard that the SLS was a small hotel, recently refurbished and that it provided a hip and trendy way yet friendly atmosphere. I was especially attracted to the fact that the SLS is somewhat removed from the strip and that afforded us some much needed quiet and privacy.

24-hours prior to my arrival I called the hotel to confirm my reservation (which I booked directly with the hotel on-line) as well as to advise reservations that I had a late flight in and therefore required late check-in. At first the agent couldn't locate my reservation and actually told me that I did not have one. After 20-minutes on the telephone he finally located my reservation under the confirmation number i had given him. He told me that he would notate the system about the late arrival and that I should have no problems from there.

I arrived at the SLS shortly before midnight on the 8th only to find out that my reserved room had been assigned to someone else. The agent at the counter seemed clueless about what to do next so I jokingly suggested that she upgrade me to a suite - which she said she would do. The problem? Well the "suite" was a room with two under-sized double beds. Given that this was supposed to have been a romantic getaway long weekend I did not consider the sleeping arrangements to be ideal. I then proceeded to call the front desk who told me they would call me at 10AM the next day when my original room became available. The call never came.

At 11:00 AM on the 9th I went to the front desk to inquire about the room and was told by the employee that no rooms were available, that I should consider myself lucky to have the room I had because it was better than my original room and that perhaps I should check out and try to check back in after 3PM if something became available. Really?!?!?! Not being able to tolerate any more stupidity my girlfriend and I decided to go to the SLS buffet for breakfast. While on the way I stopped to ask an employee if the buffet was open and where it was located. They told me that they didn't know where it was located and went on to tell me that they were likely no longer serving food at 11:30 AM so my girlfriend and I went to the MGM buffet instead. We subsequently found out that the SLS Buffet is indeed open for breakfast, lunch and dinner - but more to follow on that one. 

While all of this was going on my girlfriend was attempting to track down a package that she had delivered to the hotel. The person at the front desk told her to check with the FedEx Office. The FedEx Office told her to check with the mail room. Nobody knew anything about the package so I asked the concierge and explained the story to her. She was surprised to learn that the SLS had an actual mail room. She did locate it, however we were promptly informed that we could not go to the mail room because it was an employee only area. The concierge was helpful in that she offered to have a bell-hop deliver the package, the problem however is that the package wasn't delivered to us until 4-hours after the request.

Back to the room fiasco - we stayed in the room with the undersized beds. The lack of helpfulness of the staff wore us out.

Back to the buffet - we finally made it there Sunday. The food was great, it's a shame that there was nobody around to bring us drinks - the wait staff (in typical SLS fashion) was missing and less than helpful.

Oh and then there is the cab ride where the valet at the gate stopped our cab driver to yell at him (using profanities) and asking what country he thought he was driving in because he accidentally turned out in the wrong direction.

To top it all off everyone at the SLS kept addressing me as Mr. Fxxxxo when my name is Sxxxxxe. Fxxxxo is my girlfriends last name. Given that I made the reservations, that I paid for the trip and that everything was under Sxxxxxe I am unsure why the SLS couldn't get something as simple as my name right. 

SLS - Our experience was horrible. I ended up not proposing to my girlfriend because of the stress that you put on both of us. You ruined my girlfriend's long birthday weekend and we will never be back. It's really a shame because on the surface the SLS is a great hotel but when you put lipstick on a pig you still have a pig and that is exactly what the SLS is - a painted pig.

Again, I expect this will fall on deaf ears but I really needed to vent.

We were fortunate enough to have lunch here today - on their soft opening day.

This is a rare opportunity in Vegas to enjoy plates prepared by a Michelin starred chef himself, not just by a name on its signage.

Eventually this place will be a kaiseki restaurant - a traditional multi-course Japanese dinner - of only 12 seats, but due to limitated availability of uncommon ingredients required for kaiseki, liquor license, etc. they will only offer Japanese comfort food lunch in the coming months.

It was a three-course lunch for $20:

- First course: Triple layered vegetable soup served chilled - Seven vegetables in the first layer, soy sauce based brown gele in the second layer, avocado and egg white with Japanese sake in the third layer
- Second course: Petite Assorted Appetizer - Flavored edamame, marinated cucumber with sweetened miso, yuzu flavored shrimp, soy flavored Japanese taro potato, deep fried lotus roots
- Main course (choose one from three): a) Chicken Rice Omelette - egg omelette over white steamed rice sauted with ketchup, onion, green peppers, chicken, bacon and mushroom. b) Tonkotsu Ramen Noodle Soup Wok Charred - pork based ramen. c) Black Curry over Steamed Rice - traditional Japanese style curry over white steamed rice.

The first cource - the three layered soup was amazing. Very complex tastes mingled on my tongue, the potato-ish veggie flavor on the top followed by the sweet gele, deepened with the avocado. All completely grated, but I was still able to tell the texture, scoop and taste individually or all at once.

There came the second, more traditional kaiseki-like appetizer. This time, we could see the basic attributes of natural ingredients were preserved, yet amusing presentation of craftsmanship was well displayed. The finish of shrimp was like what we eat for Osechi that would bring back old timey memories. Satoimo (Japanese taro) came with tangy rock salt. Cucumber came hocho-crafted with mildly sweet moromi-miso. Deep fried lotus roots had perfect crunchiness that played nice in the mix. However, the edamame was lacking the finishing touch. Not only that the flavor was nothing special, it felt awkward to pull out beans from the pod by hand.

We chose Omurice (Rice Omelette) and Tonkotsu Ramen for the main.

As much as I would like to say the Omurice was perfect, it was also pretty basic to be honest. Considering that Omurice has been less accepted in the US market, I can understand that the straightforward path is a safe bet, but for matured taste buds like ours, some you-cannot-do-it-at-home factors seemed to be missing. My personal preference is rice less steamed and eggs more runny. Also I personally like demi-glace sauce better, or at least the ketchup could use some twist.

Now the best part- the tonkotsu ramen! I was blown away. I know it's like cheating to compare ramen elaborated by a kaiseki chef with shops serving bowls in every 60 seconds, it was the best ramen I've had in this competitive Las Vegas market. The broth had very intricate flavors, but was not too greasy or heavy. Quite contrary, the aftertaste was pleasantly light. Chashu was a little sweetened, which added a unique perspective. Typically noodles are straight and thin for tonkotsu, but wavy noodles used by Omae worked to fully enjoy this rich-yet-not-too-rich broth.

In the end, all those three (plus drink) for $20 was a well considered price point. It's on a high-end for lunch, particularly for local clientele, but is a steal for the quality of food and service.

Some obvious opening day flaws aside, this place is very promising. I spotted some misses in the food as described above, but I will hold off my full review until they start offering kaiseki, a big missing piece in the Las Vegas culinary scene.

4 stars + 1 for a forward looking factor.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 39/100

My boyfriend and I were on a mission to try all of the Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas this weekend! BurGR was our second stop of the trip!

BurGR is located literally right inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel. SUPER easy to get to from the lobby! They have this AWESOME glass window display with a metal structure emitting a bunch of flames all over it. It's really interesting and a great storefront display! They also have a bunch of Gordon Ramsay merchandise at the front such as t-shirts, cookbooks, glasses, etc.

We were able to walk right in and get seated immediately. However, a few minutes after we had been sitting at our table, I looked over to the front of the restaurant and there was a HUGE line! We got super lucky that there was nobody there when we entered at around 11:15am.

The decor of this place is super trendy, modern, and basically a sports bar with all of the large screen TVs on all of the walls displaying football and other popular sports. There are also lots of flames everywhere (I'm assuming are related to Hell's Kitchen) and a photo of Gordon Ramsay.

Waiter service was great, as usual. Our waiter immediately came to us and asked if we wanted to take a look at the drink menu, which is an iPad 2 that they give you to look at. It is an interactive menu that has all of the drinks sorted by category (beers, cocktails, red/white wine, etc.), descriptions of each drink, and even photographs. There's also a tab with Gordon Ramsay's biography and photograph, which I thought was pretty cool.

We ordered two waters, a cup of coffee, and then took a look at the menus. The menus were pretty amusing because they, too, had a giant photo of Gordon Ramsay that surprises you when you first order them :P

My bf and I ended up sharing the Shake #4 - creme brulee pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie. THIS WAS AMAZING! I had seen photos of the shakes on Yelp and was curious to try them because I've never had a shake infused with pudding before. Thanks to this shake, I am a HUGE fan of the pudding + shake combination from now on :) So yummy! The two flavors look separated (with creme brulee on top and oreo on the bottom), but surprisingly when you sipped on it, the flavors were combined and complimented each other very well. I would love to come back to try the other 4 combinations!

As for burgers, I ordered the Uber Cheese Burger (fontina cheese + raclette cheese + goat cheese), and my boyfriend got the American burger (american cheese + butter lettuce + tomato + pickle + onion). As a HUGE cheese lover, my burger was absolutely PERFECT for me! It was literally just the patty + 3 types of cheese, which was exactly what I wanted. My bf nearly inhaled his American burger and said it was super good. We unfortunately decided to skip out on getting fries because we didn't have the appetite to eat that much food! I would definitely like to come back to try the truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries.

When we received our bill, we were given an iPod that had a little survey/questionnaire for us to answer based on our dining experience at BurGR. The Yelp Elite in me naturally reached for this and began answering the questions like crazy :P I thought it was pretty cool how much they integrated the use of iPads and iPods at their restaurant!

Overall, 5 stars for a really trendy, hip atmosphere, great service, and delicious food! I would love to come back during my next visit to Vegas! :)

First and foremost this is my first review and I cant believe how absolutely appalled I am.  But, here it goes.....So my wife and I are in town for a family emergency and decided to have lunch because we had a lil time on our hands. We drove past HAG on LV blvd and it caught my eye because of the name and I love a great burger. Upon entering I was excited and looking forward to it the place seems almost like a Hooters but for Burgers. The smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicky for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear items that others have wore before but I figured hey WTH the waitress we had was very personable and  nice but was new. the prices were very high for such a simple menu. My wife ordered the smallest burger and fries and I was talked into the Quad bypass burger. with like 20 strips of bacon! I asked our waitress if the restaurant offered military discount as I often do when I am on a budget and travelling. She said "Let me ask" upon returning she said "No sorry" I was thanked her for asking. Either way I though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so I was looking forward to the food regardless. At this point I was very excited and amused on the place and was talking to my wife about how this place should/would be a goldmine. They offered malt liquor (Strange in a restaurant)in a can I ordered a Tecate she a sugar Coke.
Now for the twist of events..... Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes which is great but I was skeptical, The Burger was massive and looked so good but it was warm to the touch at best I had approx 3 bites and noticed the bacon looked as if had been microwaved from being cooked days ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistency-(Gross) The cheese was not melted, The fries looked like they were cooked in old oil due to the almost black color in nature. I tried my hardest to stomach this but I couldnt. I proceeded to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cooked to order at first she replied yes and then said something that made me raise an eyebrow, she began on informing me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old because of the way the owner is. I asked her to elaborate and she said he is so cheap that he makes his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut costs. She also informed me she almost walked out her second day on the job because of what he acts like in his day to day operations. She looked excited when I asked to speak to him about the quality and preparation of my food. When the Owner/manager Jon came to the table he sat down opposite from me and was very hostile. At this point I was pretty much amazed I would assume he would address my concerns in a professional and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimidation and apprehension. I said I would please like another burger due to the dissatisfaction of it not being fresh. He looks at myself and my wife and says' " In six years I have never comped a meal and it won't be today!!" I proceeded to inform him I simply wanted another burger and I am not looking for a comp. He then informed us that he would call the police if we didnt pay I said I would not pay for a burger like this especially one that i didnt touch. From his demeanor at this point I wanted to leave so i said look I will pay for my wifes and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this quality of food.
At this point I felt threatened and was basically being held against my own will. I said fine Please call the police. He proceeds to lean over and say, You know what " you started it when you asked for a discount" I was like "What"? He then says I cant stand the "F" ing military I was so appalled that he was addressing me like this in general and then he begins to say, I'm from Oxnard, Ca. and we used to beat the "S" out of filthy mexicans like you! At this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief He leaves and the table next to me were also expressing there disgust in the food and as he saw us speaking with them he said to leave right now we were trespassing! As I leave I attempt to tip my waitress and he rips the money from my hand! My wife and I wait outside for the police THE WHOLE TIME WE are waiting quietly the owner is harrassing us going on a tirade about my race and my occupation being totally distasteful in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up (LVPD) I provide them ID and they are in absolute disbelief they resolve the issue after questioning and bottom line it does not matter the police officer said I had to pay I totally understand and uphold the law but requested that I receive what I pay for (At least I gave it away to a homeless man.
BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: 1. DO NOT GO THERE FOR QUALITY OR FRESHNESS  IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS NOT 2. THE OWNER IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING. 3.YOU ARE WARNED. PLEASE DONT BE ROBBED OR DEGRADED LIKE ME  GO ANYWHERE ELSE.

I have recently discovered that very yummy things come from tiny little buildings. The menu here at Sammy's L.A. Pastrami & Burgers offers a variety of options for such a small place. The outside is nothing pretty to look at but sometimes it is those places that surprise you. There is a small seating area near a walk up window if you want to enjoy your food outside. There are easy to read menus along the building of the drive-thru it is just hard deciding what to try from it. 

My man had to try the "L.A Style Pastrami". It was a BIG hit! It has pastrami, mustard and pickles on a sub style roll. They have 3 different sizes with the extra large being $12.99! I wouldn't recommend the extra large unless you plan to share with somebody or plan to have more then 1 meal out of it because he got the large at $9.69 and it was almost too much pastrami. Not that he complained or didn't finish every bite because he did! The guy at the window said the bad for you fried foods were all hand breaded and that they use fresh ingredients and I was craving something I could dip in ranch so I chose the "Variety Platter" at $7.99. I picked battered zucchini slices, fried mushrooms and fried mozzarella sticks. The zucchini was the best part! It really wasn't greasy and had great flavor. The fried mushrooms were good but I can't say I would order them again. The mozzarella sticks were perfect. The batter tasted good and the cheese wasn't rubbery like most places it was really stringy and super good. The ranch was thick and creamy. I really like this place and will be back regularly. 

There is plenty of options for burgers or chicken sandwiches. They also have a philly cheese steak that looks like it would be good. The menu says their shakes are made with "thrifty" ice cream. The "Garlic Romano Fries" are on my radar for next time.

Plan to wait a while while your food is being made. It is being made fresh so it does take some time.

I noticed after this visit just how much the price has changed when it comes to a brunch buffet. Generally brunch costs more than breakfast, lunch or dinner, but not here at the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station. Brunch on Sunday runs around $9.99 (same price for dinner during the week) with a players card. After being seated I noticed how dirty the highchair was that my nephew was in. I'm talking all sorts of food on either side of it. I cleaned it up with some wipes his mom had with her, but this highchair looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. Our server was great and checked on us often. Even with the big group we had at our table she kept the dishes cleared and brought us refills without us ever having to ask. 

They brunch buffet has the usual stuff. Different breakfast and lunch option at the same time. I walked by the pizza as it was coming out so I figured that was a good time to get some of that. It tasted OK, but definitely tasted like a frozen pizza that was made. They do have a pizza oven right there and you can watch it cook, but it wasn't anything I'd ever go out of my way for. The bacon was hard and tasted microwaved. Scrambled eggs weren't bad or the mini waffle I had. The hash browns were a soggy mess with some burnt crispy parts. I did enjoy the mac & cheese even if it tasted like Kraft deluxe. The breakfast sausage looked good, but tasted nasty. I brought back an assortment of desserts for our table to try and they were terrible! All of the pastries were hard which was a disappointment. I will say that the salad bar had a lot of options including fresh fruit and it all looked good. I enjoyed what I had from the salad bar area much more than anywhere else at the buffet. This buffet could use many changes and isn't really worth it until then in my opinion. 

Kids 2 and under are free.

I am still alive. I am still grateful. I still remember. 

This week, I celebrate the outcome of a lifesaving surgery. This time each year, I take a road trip to remember how lucky I am to be alive and the life lessons that I learned from almost dying. 

El Cortez. A great find. A bargain-priced well-run, cleaner-than-most hotel in old-school downtown dirty Vegas. This location is perfect for a variety of traveler's wants, especially mine.

Steps from the double-decker 'Deuce' bus which runs the strip 24 hours a day starting here. If you have no means of transportation or just love saving lives by letting sober hands take the wheel, having the Deuce, ($7 per 24 hours) steps away is critical.

I didn't love Vegas my first visit. I flew in from LA, stayed at Cesar's Palace, took taxis to and from exclusive nightclubs and fancy steak houses with my former-frat-boy ex. 

Since, I've stayed at a gamut of convenient-to-the-strip hotels, found a nonexclusive place to dance and liked it. But I didn't love Vegas until I found the old-timey Vegas that resides at the Fremont street experience, steps from El Cortez. 

Why I prefer 'downtown' to 'uptown' in general represents one of the reasons my nickname at Yelp is "grassroots girl". The other, is that this account, like all my social networking, began to respond with an authentic voice to corporate injustice. My commitment to the ideology behind both is also what I celebrate this week, why I came & why I loved it here.

I lost my memory once years ago. Can you imagine waking up ten years from now with no memory of the time passing within those ten years? That was me, years ago. 

I was a broke teenager with lavender hair who carried picket signs and fronted a rock band, 13. When I woke up, I was VERY different, twenty something. It wasn't just the blond hair or the fancy car in my driveway that was different, I didn't know my mail carrier's name nor did I care. *The good news about finding out the bad news about yourself, is that you can change.

I'll be prone to falling in love with "uptown" things forever. I will fall off the course once set for myself, ideals included. Ridiculous insecurities will drive my wants to "fit in" and "be accepted". I'll have the opportunity to be both ashamed or proud of where I came from.

With any luck, I'll hang on to 'grassroots' ideals. Won't be easy. Once a year, I will take a road trip to remember how I'd once forgotten everything I stood for on the path to acceptance from everybody but me.

If you want access to the most exclusive nightclubs, if you like the limelight, if you steer from classic towards the newest, coolest, chicest, you might not like it here. If you send your food back because it never meets your standards, if you only frequent the "in" spots only when the "in" crowd is there, this might not be for you. 

If you have not yet deleted all memory of the years spent turning your once-idealistic values to shit, you might choose to stay elsewhere. There was a time in my life when this place wasn't up to my standards.

 I was an asshole. A bitch. A stuck up jerk who only cared about the label beneath her lapel and the logo on her car keys. I'm not saying that I'm not all of the aforementioned still. (I am) It will be a lifetime uphill battle to avoid becoming that way again completely. Loving my stay here is proof that I have not fallen all the way off the tracks.

We had two double beds on the 5th floor. Room 5509 had a GREAT view from the window. We used the coffee maker to make hot water for tea. (the coffee is meh) We watched the big flat-screen TV for the weather report. Over 100 degrees!

A fridge was given to us on request, on the house. We filled it with fruit, drinks and milk for cereal which we purchased from the bodega spotted from our beautiful window view. 

We took advantage of the Shea butter lotions, soaps and high-end toiletries provided. We used the lush bath towels and called down for more. We took some extra towels to the dingy pool 2 blocks away, but we had the pool all to ourselves so had a great time swimming anyway.

I drank espresso every morning from the coolest cafe/record store/art gallery in the world located just steps away. We watched the 'Tribute To Queen' show at the Fremont experience where water was 2 for $1. deep fried Oreo cookies, 99 cents each & green cans of cream ale, 2 bucks. 

We shared steak dinners ($6.99) in the middle of the night when the "gambler's specials" roll out. We treated ourselves to a  $6.25 breakfast buffet (coffee & OJ included) from Vegas Club down the block. We waited behind the wise elderly locals outfitted with walkers and wheel chairs who smiled at us. We smiled back. 

We slept all day in the cool comfort of personalized AC without hearing neighbors or slot machines. We felt safe leaving the casino late-night. Highly recommended. Will return. Hopefully, grassroots forever.;-)

This is my first visit to the new hotel and casino.  On my way from work to the hotel, I called up reservations to ask what my dining options were at this time of the night (arriving at 8:30p) and was told that I had Ditka's (steakhouse), the 24/7 Cafe, and the food court, where I could find Panda Express, Fat Burger, and Los Reyes de la Torta.  As soon as I heard "Los Reyes," I knew where I would go for dinner.  :)

After studying the three menu boards overhead (a shorter list of their regular selection of tortas, aka sandwiches, and tacos) and concentrating on the tortas board, I considered two options: Cubana and the Carne Asada.  I ordered the Cubana (ham, sliced roasted pork loin, melted cheese, jalapenos, onions, and minus the avocado, and served with refried beans) since that was what grabbed my attention the most.  I was told my wait would be around 10 minutes, so I went to the Players Club to get a reprint of my card, should I ever get the itch to gamble during my stay.  (I found out the unused free slot play I'd received when I first applied for my card years ago was only good for the first 24 hours, so I was not able to get a re-issue of that free play- darn!  However, if you play nice, you can always get something comped.  :)  Thank you, Patrick!)  After getting a new copy of my card, I made a quick stop at the Square Bar for a glass of wine, and then headed to LR to retrieve my to-go order**.

A styrofoam box with my name on it was waiting for me, and while I dropped off my claim ticket, I asked where I'd find the utensils and was told it was at the cubicle next to me (couldn't see it because I was approaching the pick-up section from the left and the divider kept me from seeing the utensils, condiments, wet naps, and napkins, which were to my right).  The tables are cafeteria-style, so just grab one that looks clean.  This sandwich, which came with ridged potato chips, was HUGE!  I expected refried beans goop, but these were actually whole beans scooped onto the bottom of the sandwich, upon which sliced ham, white cheese, sliced pork, tomatoes, sauteed seasoned onions, and jalapeos were added.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-reyes-de-la-torta-laveen?select=XmayEHOPKoQE1L20R-H1jQ#XmayEHOPKoQE1L20R-H1jQ  The telera roll was toasted and buttered- so delicious!  It was all I could do not to eat the whole thing, and I am accustomed to eating light at every meal.  I ate so much that I don't think I'll need to eat breakfast before heading for my morning swim... With Dunkin' Donuts coffee and Munchkins to tempt me, however, I may just have to force myself to have a few bites!  ;)

**  I should've just gone with "dining in" option, since I knew that I didn't have a refrigerator in my room.  However, I had planned to look for a bar to order a drink, since LR didn't serve alcoholic beverages, and I didn't want to leave my food open to the elements.  Thank goodness I went with the boxed option, since there are flies in the cafeteria-- disgusting!

The food is outstanding but you have to wait for it. Is it worth it?

The Oyster Bar is inside the Palace Station Casino. The bar only has 18 seats. 

We got here at 8:30 pm on a Monday thinking we could avoid the infamous wait. No such luck, eleven people ahead of us in line. The line did not move for 40 minutes. When it finally moved, it went quick. At the one hour mark, we got seated. Yay. 
Well not so fast. 

After you're seated, you're given a sourdough roll and butter. Thank you, thank you thank you. We were starving and that helped a lot. A few minutes go by and they take our order. We waited so long I memorized what we wanted a half an hour ago lol. 

40 minutes later our soup comes out. 
An hour & 15 minutes from being seated we got the oysters. 
At the two hour mark from being seated we got our entrees. 
3 hour 15 minutes from waiting in line to finishing our meal. 
Was it worth it?

Here's the rundown:
New England Clam Chowder - Delicious. The bowl was full of clams and the soup was just outstanding. 

Oyster (a dozen) - was so so good. Cocktail sauce, horseradish and lemon accompanied the oysters. One of the best oysters I've ever had. The chef was having problems with one of the oysters (didn't want to stay in the shell) we were playfully teasing him about it and he was such a sport about it. We all had a good laugh and he put an extra oyster in for us. A bakers dozen, all delicious. 

Plaza Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab, chicken and andouille sausage. It's my first pan roast and it was delicious. The brandy and cream was a good combination. All the proteins were cooked perfectly. I specially liked the andouille sausage, a little hint of spiciness worked well with the broth.  I got a number 7 on the heat scale. It was not spicy for me at all. I could not finish my bowl, it was so rich and I had a lot of oysters. Lol. I will have a good lunch tomorrow for sure. 

I was also able to taste the following dishes. 
Combo Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab and lobster. My Mom's choice. Zero on the heat scale. It was as good as mine. Tasted the lobster and that was very good. Good amount of it too. Lol. 

Bouillabaisse - was so good. My brother's dish. 7 on the heat scale. It was spicy. Ouch. But it was really good. The broth was clean and very flavorful. It had shrimp, crab, lobster, mussels & clams. Great broth. I would get this next time. 

Service was excellent. The chef was friendly and entertaining. 

The wait. It didn't bother me at all. It was more entertaining than anything else. I got to talk to other people waiting in line and making fun of the situation we were in. I even got to meet a couple of local Yelpers and she told us about a Korean/Mexican fusion restaurant (Komex). The 3 hours went by really fast. 

It's an experience I won't soon forget and isn't that why we go to these places and go through all the hoops. Lol
Was it worth it?
I say Yes!!

We had great service
We had great food. 
We had great conversations
We had a memorable night. 

I'll definitely be back

Ay Caramba!!!!

I Love This Place!!!!

On our last stop through SinCity before heading out to the airport, my friends and I decided to check out this off-strip Yelp favorite. With over 1,000 reviews, Firefly has scored an impressive 4.5 star average out of five, no easy feat I might add!

Well, it goes without saying that I came with high expectations. Luckily, I was not disappointed...whew!

Upon stepping into the bustling restaurant, i heard rhythmic salsa music being played in the background and it had a very familar Latin cantina vibe to it, which felt casual and fun. With lots of red and orange all around my hankering for tasty tapas became even more amplified!

We were seated conveniently by the large window, which let in a good amount of natural lighting (excellent for foodporn) and spacious enough for us to stow our luggage.

Our server was friendly and helpful with the menu and never pushy or rude.  Within moments of ordering, we got some sliced baguettes drizzled with butter and served with pickled olives and a house butter spread. The bread was warm & crisp and house butter was delicious! 

Then came our drinks and tapas!

I must insist that you try the blood orange mojito. You can taste that the blood orange was deeply infused in this amazing drink and the combination of the refreshing mint makes this exhilarating drink all the more enjoyable! Of course, the sangrias here are phenomenal and also a must if you're going to enjoy tapas here, as well.

Now onto the tapas...

Bacon Wrapped dates with smoked almonds red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles were remarkably good! Crisp bacon wrapped around sweet dates and tooped with fragrant blue cheese crumbles is always a winning combination in my book!

Tuna tartare - the marinated tuna had a tangy Asian flare that had hints of soy, lime & chili...enjoyed on crisp taro chips, it was a delicious contrast of textures and flavors that made this tartare a shining success!

Tierra Y Mar Skewers - Grilled Shrimp, Filet Mignon, Chorizo, Salsa Verde - from the plump shrimp to the juicy filet, each morsel on the skewer was cooked perfectly. Tack on the the tangy  kick of the salsa verde and it was a virtual fiesta in the mouth! 

Duck rolls - Crisp and delicious fried wonton wrapped around tender pieces of succulent braised duck and dressed in a very tangy sweet hoisin sauce, almost too cloyingly sweet but overall, very tasty.

Filet Mignon sliders - Served with a very rich Serrano ham, cabrales cheese sauce and caramelized onions this dish was probably the most disappointing as the burgers were cooked well done leaving them without the awesome pink center I love so much. Because they were well done, they were chewier and less tender juicy and flavorful 

Camarones la diabla - Now this dish was a winner! Bursting with bright flavor and beautifully presented in a fiery red sauce, the plump shrimp were generously dressed with a sauce that creeped up slowly but left a spicy kick at the end of each bite...yum!

Ceviche - Loaded with plump shrimp, this dish came with loads of crunchy tortilla chips and buttery avocado. My only gripe would be that it needed some some spice to kick it up a notch. Nothing a lil Tabasco couldn't fix which our lovely server remedied for us upon request.

For dessert - We enjoyed a caramel flan with a lady finger and it was the perfect end to a delightful meal!

Our server also arranged cab service for us which arrived in record time!

I highly recommend Firefly to anyone looking for a great lunch or evening out with friends. The restaurant is fun, the service is friendly and the food is fantastic!

Happy Eats!

***Joel Robuchon is considered by some as one of the best restaurants in the U.S.; I think the food here is good and the bread and mignardises trolleys provide a luxurious abundance you just cannot get elsewhere, but I actually prefer L'atelier de Joel Robuchon next door; that Robuchon restaurant serves much more contemporary, creative, vibrant, and lighter French cuisine***

Because of its three Michelin stars rating (back when Michelin used to rate Vegas restaurants), Joel Robuchon is a restaurant many seek out for a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience.  I dined at Joel Robuchon a few years ago and I thought it was good but not as good as other great high-end restaurants I have tried in San Francisco and Chicago (I would also put it below the two L'atelier de Joel Robuchon restaurants I have tried--one in Vegas and another in Tokyo).

As good as Michelin is at selecting truly special restaurants, it still gives a little too much praise to restaurants from legendary French chefs like Joel Robuchon, Guy Savoy and Jean-Georges Vongerichten.  For me, these acclaimed French restaurants feel like places where the celebrity chef is not really there that often.  In addition, the food at these French spots just feel outdated and heavy and nowhere near as exciting as the progressive cuisine that restaurants like Manresa, Saison, wd~50, and Graham Elliot serve.

I did think the bread trolley and mignardises trolleys at Joel Robuchon on my first visit were very exceptional--both of these trolleys did deliver the kind of great flavors and textures as well as luxurious presentation that you just cannot find elsewhere (even at great restaurants).  My first trip to Joel Robuchon was for their tasting menu and it was way too much food and it kind of dulled the experience.

My dinner the second time around was a smaller set menu and it actually resulted in a more enjoyable experience even if the food was nowhere near the quality and creativity of The French Laundry or Quince.

Dinner started with a refreshing gazpacho served with creamy burrata and really good extra virgin olive oil.  Next up was a good salad of leafy greens, artichokes, shaved foie gras torchon (creamy, savory and meaty), crostini, and shaved Parmesan.

A warm, sweet and velvety kabocha veolute was the next course.  It was garnished with really good roasted chestnuts, mushrooms and truffle.

The fish course was smoked and then roasted black cod.  The fish flaked very nicely and easily.  The fish was very soft and moist.  I enjoyed the light eggplant puree sauce that the fish sat in; the eggplant puree sauce was brightened up by good yuzu.  The fish was topped with good asparagus.

The meat course was a braised beef cheek wrapped in pasta; it was served with nicely braised winter vegetables, red miso and ginger.  The beef cheek was good; it was very savory, juicy, tender, and quite rich.  The beef cheek was finished off with Joel Robuchon's signature mashed potatoes, which were rich, buttery, thick, smooth, and creamy (the staff at all of Robuchon's restaurants tout this side and it is very memorable for such a simple starch).

Dessert was a fragrant green chartreuse sabayon with refreshing herb sherbet and a nice hazelnut praline at the bottom (mostly sweet but also a little bit salty and a great crispy, wafer-like consistency).

The dinner ended with some good mignardises of mini macarons, chocolates, truffles, pate de fruit, and canele.

Service was very good--professional and polite but also friendly (I felt the service was much more personable on this visit).

The dining room has kind of an over-the-top luxurious look with purple contrasting strongly with black as well as chandeliers.

Prices are very high (even for Vegas standards), but there are a few menu options including the ability to get just 3 or 4 courses; this might be more than enough food given the generous amount of complimentary breads and mignardises served here.

I enjoyed my experience at Joel Robuchon more this time because the food felt a lot lighter.  Still, the food at Joel Robuchon feels dated in parts and for a high-end French restaurant, I prefer the more modern but still classically French Melisse in LA or the French seafood restaurant Le Bernardin where the seafood and sauces both really stand out (even if the food feels slightly dated there too).  If Joel Robuchon is one you have been wanting to try for a long time, I would say that it is worth a try though I would opt for one of their less expensive menus.

If you are just looking for a really good French restaurant, I would suggest L'atelier de Joel Robuchon next door, which serves French cuisine very much inspired by classic French dishes but also with a lighter, more vibrant, more contemporary, and more creative style.

Joel Robuchon is located in the MGM Grand.  Like other major hotels and casinos on The Strip, the MGM Grand offers both complimentary valet and self parking.

I had it all planned out. Vegas Buffets 101, some tips from buddies (Thanks Leona for the last minute answers!)- the best time to go to a buffet is between shifts! 

That's when u get to sample both lunch and dinner at Lunch Price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I lost a battle and ended up going for dinner at around 4pm, not like j had planned, and after seeing gorgeous displays of desserts, tons of yummy looking stations, you forget about the 40 plus dollars you shelled out. But it all worked out in the end. Cuz you don't have to wait that extra time letting your stomach bloat up waiting for the seafood to come out. You hit that first to make sure you get your money's worth! 

No king crab, but snow crab was decent. Especially since they cut it for you already, so no crab juice in your neighbors eye. I ate plenty. 

Starting from the far end, there's the chinese section (WALNUT SHRIMP was my fave). They have chowmein, fried rice, eggrolls, stir fry, some dim sum dishes, spicy eggplant, yummy greenbeans.
They have Pho, Japo station sucked. Miso soup, sushi rolls. (what i would have loved to have seen for shelling out 50 bucks was some decent sashimi, and maybe some tempura!)
Taco station was pretty cool, although i didn't get eat much from this station. 
Cheese and cold cuts
Small build your own salad section and small plates of caprese salad
About 5 different pizzas
Meat section: prime rib, ribs, chops, brisket. damn it, i missed the rib eye lollies.
Little pasta, a good fried section: Calamari, sweet potato tater tots, fries, fish and chips
Crab, shrimp, oysters, mussels, fish dishes.  You can get either steamed crab legs or chilled ones. (steamed is in another section)
HUGE dessert section.

This was my favorite (obviously).
I got French Toast Gelato, Thai iced tea gelato (pretty cool selection),
macarons, cookies, cupcakes, tiramisu, chocolate cream brulee, cakes galore, cake pops. I saw a crepe station, bread pudding... lots o stuff i didn't have room for.

Although i loved gorging myself, there were only a few items that i totally loved. The rest was good, but i'm not sure it was 50 bucks worth good. I would come again for sure, but definitely sticking to my guns to come at the lunch price. 

* i went on a monday around 4pm and walked right in. But weekends, i hear can be hours of waiting! Be prepared!

Third times a charm? This makes three times I have seen a pizza spot in this location. I stopped in and ordered a "Monday's Special" which is a large cheese pizza for $9.99 and additional toppings are extra. Inside was very busy so I guess others are wanting to this place out too. While I was waiting for my pizza, I noticed they have pizza by the slice for sale. I asked if they could add a slice of Sicilian (cheese) to my order priced at $3.25 and make it to-go. My husband isn't a fan of a lot of sauce on a pizza, but I'm the opposite. I asked for a side of sauce (cost .85 cents) to go along with my pizza for dipping and it and I ended up really liking the flavor. The pizza had a thin crust and the right amount of cheese for it. The pizza wasn't very greasy at all and hubby and I both enjoyed it. The Sicilian slice tasted great and had the crisp crust it should, but I was a but disappointed when I got home and opened the paper bag it was in and it was just on a paper plate inside the bag. They did just open, so it's possible they ran out of to-go boxes, but I hope it's not this way all the time. The Sicilian slice was actually my favorite part. The employees were nice and with the different specials they have going on and the food being decent, I can see coming back.

Most pizza joints have a "slice special" and it has a certain time it runs and sometimes only on certain days. Well, here you can get 2 slices and a drink for $5.50 7 days a week anytime. I thought it was a plus that I could get a slice special for dinner instead of just a restricted lunch time special. Aside from pizza they also have wings, fingers, salads, strombolis, pasta, sandwiches and desserts. They also cater.

This is the BEST steakhouse off the strip.  And even with that, Echo & Rig has SO much more going for it!

I came here with a 8 adults and 4 kids for my wife's birthday dinner on a very busy Saturday night.  Even though they normally don't take reservations, the manager I spoke with on the phone the day before (Cheryl) was very helpful as I had my eye on the big long striped wooden table that was pictured on their site and they saved it for us.  We arrived a few minutes before and were treated to passed hors d'oeuvres of their homemade salami and smoked chicken.  Yum freakin yum.

With so many small plates offered, Echo & Rig is meant for groups so everything can be shared.  We split 3 salads and they all threw curveballs to the palate.  The kale salad with yellow beets, toasted hazelnuts and goat cheese was really nice.  Their "over the rainbow salad" was an explosion of flavor featuring farro, quinoa, red, yellow & orange bell peppers, corn, red onion, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, almonds, herbs & Champagne vinaigrette.  That's a vegetarian's dream right there.  And the fried spinach salad with red onion, cauliflower, broccoli was fantastic with the chile-lime vinaigrette was probably my favorite of them all.  The crispness of the spinach combined with the heat from the dressing was quite a combination.  

We ordered a bunch of small plates and the standouts for me were the cauliflower with chili de Arbol, crispy shallots and onions and the roasted garlic mashed potatoes with sharp white cheddar but the description didn't do that justice.  It was almost like a super hash brown with a really nice dijon sauce.  I was also able to sample the burnt peas, pumpkin squash, grilled thick cut bacon with bbq sauce (no sauce needed), butcher's sausage and mac and cheese.  All of them were solid options and everything was devoured by the group.  

I got the "Spencer Steak" which was one of the 3 ribeye cuts offered.  Each steak comes with a complimentary sauce and I went with charred onion but sauce just isn't necessary when the meat is awesome.  My medium rare cut was closer to rare but it was probably better that way.  It was everything you wanted in a steak...tender, juicy and flavorful.  My wife's rare filet mignon was cooked perfectly and just got better bite after bite.

Then there's the freakin value of it all!!  The priciest entree is only $35!  NO corkage fee (we brought 3 bottles), NO cake fee (got a cake from Patisserie Manon) and they lit the candles and brought it out.  The total bill for 8 adults and 4 kids came out to what 2 people would spend at Carnevino.  Total Wine and More is just across the way in Boca Park so pick something up there.  

I cannot wait to come back since there are so many other dishes I must try like bone marrow carne asada and Hawaiian cowboy.  I also can't wait for them to bust out their brunch and late night menus.  They also have tables set up on a balcony overlooking the Tivoli Village fountain which would make for a terrific date night.   

The staff was top notch from beginning to end and the experience here wouldn't have been as wonderful as it was without their great work.  They earned their tips and then some! I'm ready to go back for lunch.  

Say hi to the pig heads outside!!

Chinese food for the affluent located at none other than the world famous Bellagio Resort and Casino.  Normally I wouldn't give a place like this a second thought with its suggested dress code and prices five times the norm, but when Lady Luck intervened I suddenly felt an urge to splurge.

The place is downright formal in its mannerisms.  When I entered the restaurant and inquired about getting a table the hostess greeted me and asked for my last name.  I was asked to take a seat at a small reception area opposite the bar while my table was being prepared.  I found the experience quite interesting because from the moment the hostess wrote down my last name every staff person addressed me as Mr. Y.

The server, the waitress, a floor supervisor ... everybody addressed me as Mr. Y as if they had written my last name somewhere near my table for all to see.

Once inside the fancy dining room with its gigantic crystal chandeliers hanging down I was seated at a small table with a clear view looking out the huge glass windows where three times during my meal the fabulous fountains of the Bellagio performed their artistic magic.  There I was enjoying this amazing spectacle from a most unique vantage point behind the fountains.

At Jasmine they pull your chair out when you go to sit down, they help to push your chair in once you are seated, they unfold your thick fabric napkin for you and they gently place it on your lap.  I was often taught those steps to be used for a special lady, but I never imagined having a lady do those things for me.

Jasmine certainly has its service perfected, but how is their food?

I didn't select any extravagant selection here.  In fact, my selections were downright homey.  I'm pretty certain this type of restaurant can handle the fancy dishes well, but I was curious how well they could punctuate the more traditional dishes I might have at home.

Three Soup Tasting (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg?select=CZ10iE9MQfGLqpLkyda3LQ) is a sampler of three popular soups, braised shark fin, chicken corn chowder and won ton soup.  Since I had run a long race that morning I wanted something soothing, and for me that usually means hot soup.

The shark fin soup had lots of strands of crunchy, chewy shark fin in a slightly thickened soup.  The soup lacked meat though.  Most restaurants will serve this either with shards of chicken breast or pieces of Virginia ham.  Jasmine didn't.  Keeping in mind that this was only a sampler there was exactly one wonton in a perfectly seasoned broth.  The wonton was plump with lean pork and a large chunk of shrimp.  I would have liked more.  Egg whites, corn kernels, corn starch and chicken breast bits made up the very standard chicken corn chowder.

Pineapple Fried Rice was served in a boat-like glass dish lined with a single lotus leaf.  The first bowl was served to me (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg?select=D2-2SonYOPnRw0FUCJ32EA), and I must have refilled my bowl three times in finishing the dish which combined white rice, egg yolks, shrimp, scallops and fresh grilled pineapple.

Ma Po Tofu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg?select=ulN8otZyPI6LQQgH69REeQ) was made with the silky tofu instead of the medium firm tofu I'm used to with this dish.  I had no problem with that though as the dish was very good.  It was mildly spicy just like the waitress suggested.

You can choose from five or six different green leafy vegetables for your Daily Greens side dish.  You can even suggest how you would like it to be prepared.  I chose the Choy Sum (young tender greens) and asked that it be sauted.  The vegetables (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg?select=asVdBSNxFrPL8VSwyZ7j5g) were cooked perfectly with a nice shade of green.  I enjoyed this simple dish very much.

The food is a good 3.5 stars and the service is definitely a 5.  This meal left me nice and full, and the restaurant is a convenient two minute walk along the casino floor to the Cirque du Soleil's "O" Theatre.

My first visit being so-so, I decided to give Teriyaki Madness a second try to see if I liked it any better. For me it was still the same so-so experience and I don't get the hype over this place. Inside is very clean and they have plenty of tables to choose from and the booths are spacious which is nice. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu. Some of the food I ordered was really good and some of it was not so good. I do get coupons in the mail sometimes for BOGO offers, so I can see coming back with a coupon and probably will since the rice and chicken are pretty darn good and I work in the area, but I can't see making a point to come here often. 

Spicy Chicken Teriyaki Plate ($8.99) - I took the white rice that came with it and mixed it with the chicken. I liked the flavor of the chicken a lot. There was a good portion of both rice and chicken. I'd order this again for sure. 

Spicy Beef Teriyaki Plate ($9.49) - For an extra $1 this time I chose noodles instead of rice. The noodles were a bit dry and lacked flavor. The beef was tender and tasted good, but I tasted teriyaki flavor and no spice which was a bummer because I had enjoyed the spicy chicken and the chicken actually kick. The overpowering flavor of teriyaki on this one will most likely mean that I will stick to the spicy chicken instead.

Chicken Egg Roll ($1.99) - Inside I saw tons of what appeared to be black pepper yet the egg roll really had no flavor. It was filled with a generous amount of chicken, but it was greasy and flavorless. 

Chicken Pot Stickers ($3.29) - These were a greasy and overcooked mess. On the menu these are described as "crazy good" and I got 5 of them that were crazy greasy and hard. The inside tasted not so great. I will stick to the stickers elsewhere. 

Stir-Fry Veggies and a Green Salad are each options for sides. The salad came with a sweet dressing that tasted good. The veggies were basic yet tasty and fresh. 

Orders are made fresh so if you are on a lunch break or crunched for time then call your order in so it's ready or at least being made while you are on your way to pick it up.

This was supposed to be a very special dinner as it was my husband's birthday and we had plans to see the DVE comedy tour following dinner along with drinks after.  Unfortunately our dinner at Ten Penny made the rest of the evening very uncomfortable for my husband and very upsetting for me.  I will start with a positive.  We had reservations at 5:30 on a Friday, and for some reason hit like the worst traffic driving into town.  I was getting nervous about being late so I called to see if we could bump up our time 15 minutes.  The lady checked and said yes provided we left by 8:30 because that table was reserved by another party then.  That was no problem and she accommodated my request.

When we arrived we were seated at a semi-circle booth type table along the wall.  I liked the view and the openness of the restaurant.  I ordered a Sangria.  It was ok, sort of weak on the alcohol part.  For my next drink I ordered a Rapture Helltown IPA, which I was told 5 minutes later they just ran out, so I had to pick something else...   Since this was my husband's birthday I was encouraging him to eat whatever he wanted as I was treating and since neither of us had eaten that day I knew he was hungry.  He decided on a BBQ Chicken Flatbread for an appetizer were I had the mussels.  I enjoyed my mussels minus one thing.  They only came with one piece of bread.  I LOVE mussels, but the broth is right up there with what makes them awesome so one piece was inadequate.  I requested more bread, and the waitress asked if I wanted the "bread basket"?  Sure... Ok this part stinks.  The bread in this basket was not suitable what-so-ever for sopping up mussel broth.  There were two muffins, I believe blueberry and raspberry, a dinner roll, and some old twisty roll.  This bread clearly was not the like the crusty bread I had a mere piece of originally.  Ok that was disappointing as I left almost all the broth in the bowl.  I noticed my husband eating his flatbread fast at first and very slow at the end.  Really unusual.  

Onto the main course.  I ordered the seared duck breast, that came with Jasmine Rice, a ginger root puree, with baby bok choy, and a saba glaze prepared medium rare.  My husband ordered the traditional burger, just lettuce and tomato medium cooked.  My thoughts on the duck were mixed.  The duck, though cooked properly lacked seasoning and the worst part was they didn't render down the thick fat surrounding the meat which is unappealing and inedible.  This is cooking 101, render fat down.  The rice was overdone and gummy, but I did like the bok choy with the glaze.  I looked at my husband who was eating his burger slower than a vegetarian with a gun to their head.  "What's wrong?"  I ask. He starts to say he isn't feeling real good all of a sudden, stating he thinks he has heartburn... Not a good sign.

So we finished up and paid.  I spent well over 10,000 pennies on this Ten Penny meal...Pretty pricey meal.  We headed on down to catch the show.  Here is why I wouldn't give Ten Penny a second chance.  Only 15 minutes into the show, my husband is in visible pain.  Grasping his gut he bolts out of the theater and missed most of the second comedian's act leaving me sitting alone watching the event I also spent well over 10,000 Pennies on for his birthday present.  He returns 20 minutes later to tell me how he just tossed his entire dinner and felt awful.  He said it started at the flatbread, as he noticed it wasn't really cooked all the way (doughy) but ate it anyway.  He said as soon as he finished he started to begin to feel sick.  He felt really awful the rest of the night and just as a reminder this was HIS BIRTHDAY!!!  I am not a happy camper that I take him here for his birthday, spend a decent amount of dough, only for him to get sick maybe poisoned and miss some of the show we went to and feel awful the rest of the night.  I would like to go two stars since the service was adequate, accommodating, and friendly but I think most can understand why I just can't.

The Noob's guide to a $20 massage at Bali!

If you guys reading this are like me, you would consider yourself very INEXPERIENCED when it comes to massages in general.  And of course, you've heard plenty of stories about the shady Asian Massage parlors in Vegas LOL.  

Since I am now an expert (jk only been one time lol), I will HELP you out and let you know what to expect!



1)  I showed up with no appointment, but was promptly welcomed and walked to the back.  Maybe during prime time, you might have to wait, but I had NO WAIT on a Thursday around 630pm.  Maybe if you enjoy a particular masseuse, you could schedule an appointment with that person, but since it was my first visit, I only showed up with a dumb look on my face lol.

2)  There are no upsells or uncomfortable requests for additional money.  There were no options, no choices.  No drinks or products to buy.  You walk in for a massage, and you drop a $20 bill on the table on the way out.  Simple and CHEAP...I like that!

3)  I was walked into the back into a large community room with tall cubical-like partitions set up  (BTW, there were places for me to CHARGE my phone).  It is very dark in there, but because it is not a private area, you should probably leave your clothes on, which brings me to my next point :

4)  Wear COMFORTABLE clothing.  I came in with a T-shirt, Jeans and tied tennis shoes, but I should have came in a tank top, shorts, and sandals.  They rub this very low scented lotion pretty much everywhere, so you don't want that crap on your good clothes, as well as them getting rolled up and wrinkled.  Your hair gets all messed up too...don't plan on going out lookin your best when you're finished.

5)  Once you get your area, take off your socks/shoes etc, and relax....maybe put your phone on silent.  My masseuse was there after about 5min with a bucket of hot water for my feet. 

6)  The massage itself : Probably depends on your masseuse for the most part.  Mine was a middle aged lady with a bit of meat on her, and was the perfect "STRENGTH" I needed.  I am a wuss...I don't need anyone breaking my back or gettin super deep-tissue on me, but if you do, ask for it!  As well as once you are on your chair...TELL EM if they need to go easy or harder on ya.

7)  Mine started off with my forehead, hair and scalp, temples, behind the ears (OMG YES!) and then to the neck.  Shoulders, arms and hands were next, to the feet/calves/thighs and then to the back.  I would imagine I could have asked for more or less time in any of the areas, and it would have been acceptable.

8)  My massage lasted about an hour and fifteen from sit down to leaving.  I never noticed her checking her watch, but she kept me BUSY pretty much the entire session.  I felt great right after the massage, and felt a lil beat up the next day.  Nothing crazy, just like a good workout at the gym.

9)  On the way out, she offered water and sat at a bench by the front door to get her tip I presume.  Drop your $20 bill at the front, and then your tip to your masseuse. 

10)  As for the TIP, that obviously depends on your masseuse, your overall experience, and your personal pocketbook.  I won't tell you what to pay, but my experience was wonderful, and I would have personally felt cheap droppin a $5 bill for an hour of hands on work.  I spent $10 and she seemed happy...maybe if it was enlightening, I would have tipped more, but for a great massage, I think $10 was fair.  Still at $30 that's crazy cheap!  I might come here once every week or two!



I know most of this is common sense to the seasoned veteran, but I can't be the only one that has been living under a rock!!

Hope some of this helped the fellow noob!  I know it would have helped me if I would have read this before my first visit :P

Now go get your $20 massage!

I ate here for Restaurant Week Spring 2014 and again the following night from their regular menu. The portions here are nice and the different types of dishes on the menu make it hard to decide what to order. Our server, Perry is fantastic! He checked on us often and made sure everything was to our liking. Managers, Adam and Christopher also stopped by our table at different times to introduce themselves and make sure we were enjoying everything. I could tell that not just the managers care about the experience of every customer, but the servers and rest of the employees do too.

The cost for the RW week dinner was $30.14 per person which I found to be a very fair price considering what I got. I had the following:

Buddy's Caprese

Chicken Parm & Spaghetti

Zeppole

The next day I at the following:

The meal started out with warm bread and oil and balsamic. Nice start!

Buddy's Caprese ($16) - This salad is sooooo good! It had charred green beans, burrata, tomatoes and balsamic. The variety of tomatoes and different colors of them were nice. The tomatoes tasted so fresh. The burrata was fantastic! So soft and tasted great. 

Buddy's Salumi and Cheese Board ($21) - Prosciutto, spicy capicola, genoa salami, gorgonzola, pecorino, grana padano, pickled veggies, olives and grilled bread arranged beautifully on a cheese board. The meats had such great flavor and the olives (they contain pits) had a nice garlic flavor to them. All the cheeses were good, but the gorgonzola was my favorite. It was creamy and easy to spread on the garlic toast. Delish!

Chicken Parm & Spaghetti ($23) - This is oven baked with provolone and mozzarella. I thought mine from the night before was soggy, so I asked that it be cooked longer this time and it was just perfect. Nice and crispy were is should be and the cheeses tasted good. The spaghetti on the side had marinara on it and parmesan and even though I barely had room, I couldn't let it go to waste! I did take half of my chicken parm home and it reheated nicely. 

Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake ($9) - The cake was warm and baked perfectly. It also came with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream that was excellent. 

Zeppole ($9) - These are served hot and coated in a spiced sugar. 2 dipping sauces accompany them, lemon raspberry jam and chocolate. The raspberry jam I wasn't crazy about, but the chocolate dipping sauce tasted great. 

They also have a kid's menu as well a lunch menu that offers burgers and sandwiches. I am eager to come back and check some of the sandwiches out. I was very pleased with the service, food and atmosphere. The first night, we sat at a table near the bar area next to a large window that overlooks the strip. The next night we sat at a booth that was closer to the kitchen. Both are different experiences so try them both! They also can host events here.

This is my 700th review and I'm so glad I get to celebrate it with a five star review!

My fella and I planned a stay-cation at Encore this past Sunday and were very excited to try Botero while we were there. We arrived on Superbowl Sunday just around the end of the game so the place was still pretty empty. We were greeted warmly and shown to our seats. They gave us the option of sitting on the patio but we chose to sit inside instead.

Once seated, our waiter quickly took our water orders and let us peruse the menu for a little bit before returning for our drink and food order. I had been doing my homework so knew exactly what I wanted already. We started with the dungeness crab agnolotti and grilled octopus. The server mentioned that these were two of his favorite dishes, so I already knew we were on the right track. My fella went with the bone-in ribeye with rosemary prawns and I ordered the bone-in filet with foie gras. I just couldn't resist. To round our our order we decided on the brussel sprouts with pork belly and truffle mac n cheese for our sides. I was already worried we ordered too much, but we forged ahead. 

Our appetizers came out quickly and they smelled heavenly. My favorite was the dungeness crab, but the octopus was prepared well as well. I enjoyed the gnocchi, they were like heavenly little pillows. Just as we finished our appetizers our steaks and sides were delivered. They were enormous and smelled fantastic. I couldn't wait to take the first bite. Both steaks were perfectly cooked and we were so happy with our choices. The truffle mac n cheese and brussel sprouts were good. Not the best brussel sprouts I've ever had, but they were still delicious. I probably would have preferred them without the pork belly, crazy I know. 

We savored every bite but still couldn't finish everything, so we had quite a bit to take home for a midnight snack later. Despite not finishing all our food, we couldn't resist trying their famous smore beignets. I'll admit I wasn't blown away by these, but that's mostly because I'm not a huge fan of smores or any combination of these flavors. The dessert was amazing nevertheless, but I would be more interested in the key lime dessert next time around. 

This is a great location for large parties, they have quite a number of tables that can accommodate large groups before heading to the nearby clubs and they have an eclectic variety of music playing in the restaurant to get everyone pumped up. Overall, we had an amazing date night experience and I look forward to returning again!

Let me preface this by saying 5 stars do not give this foodie haven justice... this is probably the most delicious meal I've had... EVER!

It was a Wednesday night and we had 8:00 reservations.  We walked in right on time and were greeted immediately by none other than Eliot Wexler, himself. He couldn't have been friendlier, seating us immediately (just the way it should be when you have a reservation)! I noticed that the restaurant was packed and everyone around us seemed to be enjoying themselves - that was a good sign!  Plus the fact that I bumped into Jenn H, and I know she's got good taste, so when she recommended a few of her favorite menu items, I listened!

There were 3 of us dining, and I know we all enjoyed every moment, every sip, and every bite!  We each had a glass of wine to start - I went with the Kim Crawford Sauv Blanc.  Looking over the menu, it was difficult to decide on what to order - everything sounded unique and appealing.  After asking our waiter, Robert, for his opinion, I flagged Eliot down to ask what he thought between the Skate Wing and the Scallops.  He sold me on the Skate Wing... and I would order it again and again!  But before I get there, I have to mention that the table sampled the Gougere with mushroom duxelle and port wine syrup... (a special treat that was not on the menu).  We also tasted the Spinach Mezzaluna - a handmade ravioli stuffed with ricotta, mascarpone, and pecorino.  It was incredible!  I truly savored each bite! Oh, and how can I forget the fresh bread and olive oil brought to our table?  Truly, the freshest tasting olive oil... I'm not kidding!

On to the entrees... (pictured above).  My companions fancied their scallops and halibut immensely.  We traded a bite for a bite so we could each try all three entrees too, and they were all pretty amazing.  I will say, however, that Eliot (and Jenn H) steered me right in suggesting the Skate Wing.  I pretty much licked my plate clean!

We were all full after the entrees but decided that dessert would be a good ending to this phenomenal meal... so, what did we do?  On top of the cotton candy, we shared the donuts and the apple risotto.  We may as well do it right, right?  Wow!  We sure did do it right... the donut holes were served with 3 dipping sauces, and while I'm not a donut person, these were pretty amazing.  I hadn't treated myself to Cotton Candy since I was a little girl, so that was a fun addition of sugar shot right into my system... you have to have some, it's their signature dessert!  Finally, we went for one more indulgence... the apple risotto - oh, the apple risotto.  Fantastic!  Tiny pieces of apple sauteed with butter, sugar, honey, and more... topped with a salty butter flavored ice cream.  I know there were some additional ingredients that I'm missing here, but OMG... need I say more?

In some of the press I've read about this place, it's referred to as "fine dining in a casual atmosphere at an accessible price." I would agree with that - although I do think the 'accessible price' part is relative.  I would consider this more of a 'special occasion' type of place because of the $$ you'll spend here - $50 pp more or less.  It's worth dumping out your piggy bank if you have to though... it's a culinary experience you won't forget!

I'm already dreaming about my next visit!

***Like a lot of Vegas restaurants, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is expensive, but the food is very nicely plated and delicious (contemporary food but also tried and true flavor combinations)***

I went to the L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Tokyo two years ago and I had a very good experience so I decided to give the Vegas location a try.  The restaurants are fairly similar.  They both feature very similar decors (sharp reds against dark blacks to give the restaurant a very modern and trendy feel).  Both restaurants also feature bar seating around the open kitchen (a great view of the talented chefs at work).

There are other similarities.  Both locations feature a lot of modern dishes--whether available as small plates or in a seasonal tasting menu.

There are differences as well.  The Tokyo location is much bigger.  The Tokyo location also takes pastry very seriously.  The bread at the Vegas location is decent, but it does not compare that well to the Tokyo location.  The Tokyo location even has a high-end patisserie on site, which features upscale French pastries as well as individual cakes/desserts.

The food was very good at both locations though I probably liked the food at the Vegas location more.  The Tokyo location seemed more representative of the country's cuisine though.  The restaurant featured a lot of Japanese ingredients--whether Japanese fish, Japanese raised beef or mushrooms.  The menu at the Vegas location felt like a menu you might see anywhere.

I went with the tasting menu at the Vegas location and almost everything was very good.  I also added their crispy langoustine as an additional item.  Here is a rundown on their tasting menu.

(Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan) This was okay though I wish the foie gras taste was stronger.

(Confit of mediterranean vegetables with fresh mint in a radish cannelloni) The flavors were simple and light, but I liked the varying textures and flavors as well as the presentation.

(Poached oysters with chive migonenette) These were good.  The oysters were warm and soft while the dressing was flavorful.

(Langoustines with green curry and coconut milk) These were exceptional.  The langoustines were sweet and very moist (also very soft).  The garnishes were not that strong, which allowed the flavor of the langoustines to really shine.

(White onion tart topped with smoked applewood bacon, quail egg, parmesan, and asparagus) This was kind of a take on breakfast.  I really liked the crispy (hash brown-like) onion tart as well as the rich yolk of the quail egg.  I thought the bacon could have been crispier.

(Crispy langoustine fritter, basil pesto, salad) I ordered this as an additional course.  The crispy shell of the fritter was good--light, crispy and not greasy.  The basil leaf tucked inside the shell also gave the fritter a nice fragrance.  The langoustine was also good (moist), but it did not have the sweetness or softness of the other langoustine dish.

(John Dory, baby leeks, tomato, buttery shellfish sauce with lime and ginger, pomme puree) This was small but good.  The John Dory was moist and light (though the fish still had a good flavor).  I liked the mix of the butter sauce with the creamy, buttery pomme puree and the fresh tomato and leek salsa.

(Foie gras stuffed quail, pomme puree, herb salad with truffle vinaigrette) Though the foie gras stuffing was just okay, the quail was very good.  It was nicely caramelized and had a great sweet and crispy sear as well as juicy meat.  The sauce was rich and good.  I really liked the herb salad--great freshness and fragrant herbs, much better than micro greens (the also strong in flavor truffle vinaigrette was a great pairing).

(Caramel panna cotta, lemon cookie, vanilla ice cream, strawberries) I really liked the panna cotta--smooth and creamy with a very good caramel flavor.  The vanilla ice cream was great--smooth and dense with a great old-fashioned vanilla bean flavor.

(Berry mousse, tender chocolate cake, blackberries, banana tuile) This was a standard fruit with chocolate dessert.  The mousse was creamy and the chocolate cake (pieces) was not dry but just okay.  I really liked the light tuile, which had a noticeable banana flavor.

Prices were high though the tasting menu seemed to be a much better value than going a la carte.

Service was decent.  Not super attentive and plates lingered a little bit though the food came out relatively fast.  The staff was pleasant.

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon features very contemporary and artfully designed food, but there is no sacrifice in flavor.  The restaurant focuses on classical flavor combinations (whether from France or other countries/regions), which should please many.  There are a lot of overpriced fine dining spots in Vegas.  L'Atelier is expensive as well, but at least the food is delicious and very memorable.

MGM Grand offers free self-parking (via a structure).

I guess my expectations were a bit too high for such an expensive place.

We made reservations for our anniversary dinner. In general, my dining experiences surround casual dining establishments. Low key, relaxed atmosphere, friendly wait staff, the type of place that will stop for a minute or two to have a conversation instead of go through a check list. Serve bread, bring water, fork on the left, soup spoon above the plate, ask about appetizers, talk about specials, etc., etc. I got the feeling that this was a stuffed shirt type of place, and while I *was* wearing a tie that evening, I wasn't expecting a by the book, average service with our $50 meals.

Where to begin? I hate that this is basically going to be a check list of everything that went wrong, but here goes.

- requested olive oil for the table bread which took about 15 minutes to arrive. 
- the drinks we ordered took 20+ minutes to arrive.
- wifes steak wasn't cooked to order. The waiter asked if she wanted it butterflied to be sure it was cooked to order, she said yes. It was not butterflied and started bleeding when she cut into it.
- we ordered a side of brussel sprouts that didn't actually come out with the meal.
- I had to remind the waiter that we didn't get our brussel sprouts
- the sauted brussel sprouts and bacon tasted mediocre and came with crunchy bacon bits, not bacon - I've had way better and for a lot less $$.
- the steamed vegetables (a carrot and snow peas by the way) went through more of a blanching than a steaming and were basically raw veggies.
- option of baked potato, mashed potato, and potato au gratin as your included side, how much potato do you think I eat?
- run of the mill steak house music playing over the speaker system.

My expectations were that I would get an amazingly delicious meal, nice friendly evening, perhaps some live ambiance music, a waiter who remembered what we ordered without a reminder, and service that happened a bit faster. I understand that kitchen problems aren't the fault of the wait staff, but I assumed at the cost of these meals, the waiter staff would notice a missing side dish, and a steak that wasn't butterflied.

If you care to know, yes we did mention the foul ups with the food order, they did comp the brussel sprouts, they did cook the steak a bit longer, the manager came to the table to apologize, and we did receive complimentary desserts. Although the desserts were complimentary because of our anniversary and not the foul ups; not that I was fishing for free stuff. I certainly appreciate the apologies and effort put in to correcting what went wrong. I was generally expecting a *nice* place like this to be on their game the entire night and was soured by the overall experience.

Donovan's sure knows how to make a special evening, well, not so special.

I just literally got back from there and I have mixed emotions. I would say my experience was bittersweet. Let me explain.

What is it about bacon that makes everything good? The saltiness? The greasy goodness? Maybe its the fact that it is really not good for you that it makes it taste that much better. Well, the fact that this place has a bacon theme is what sold me.

With that said, I came with my wifey to check it out. I ordered The Cure and she ordered the Man Candy. We also got the Garlic Parmesan Fries because I love garlic. Then, we capped it off with dessert by getting the Panookie.

The Cure (13.95). Pork Belly with 2 Fried Eggs and Tomato Jam on a French Baguette. 
This entre was a bit overwhelming. First off, it is very messy, as soon as you pick it up, you have grease and/or egg yolk running down your arms. The pork belly itself was more belly than pork. A lot of fat with some slivers of actual pork. It tasted decent, but a lot of the fat turned me off.

Man Candy (6.95). Glazed Bacon with Cayenne accompanied by Maple Syrup to dip it in. 
Now this masterpiece is a magnificent piece of art that has been placed in a jar for your eyes to feast on. Dip it in the syrup and you will be in bacon heaven. Now this entre alone is worth the trip just to come here. I recommend getting this no matter what you or your party decides on getting. 

Garlic Parmesan Fries (4.95). French Fries sprinkled with grated Parmesan Cheese and Garlic Powder.
Now this I was a bit disappointed. To me, if you are going to serve the best Garlic Parmesan Fries, use real bits of garlic and sliced parmesan/romano cheese. The best I have had is at another restaurant that I will not mention out of respect for these guys. Message me if you are interested in that place.

Panookie (5.00). A niced sized Cookie baked in a aluminum dish topped off with Whipped Cream, Ice Cream and Chocolate Syrup.
It's exactly as described. Ours was a bit burnt on the bottom so it was a bit hard. I think it was a bit overcooked. It probably would of been great it it wasn't burnt.

Service was decent. Our server was on point with order taking, refills, etc. which it should of been because it was just us and another party of 2 she was serving.

Ambience: Since it's called "Bacon Bar", you have to picture a typical bar scene with people hanging out and of course, smoking. Even though we were seated in the "Dining Area", we weren't really sealed off from the smoke coming from the bar. So basically you will be inhaling second hand smoke guaranteed. At the bar you have to be 21. But you can bring your kids to the dining area. Now this to me is a big negative. You and your party will be exposed to secondhand smoke.

So my 3 star rating is a bit generous since my original thought were 2 stars. Like I mentioned earlier, the Man Candy alone warrants a visit here. For you not so bacon lovers, they have other things like Pizza, Wings, Pasta, etc. for your other dining options so bacon doesn't have to be your default choice.  Also, they are open 24 hours which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. Next time I will try the Bacon Burger and I will see if it can be bumped up to 4 stars.

I remember when a couple of other businesses occupied this location that Weiss Deli is at so I was skeptical about if Weiss was like them or not. The reviews and delicious pictures on yelp got my to finally try this Jewish deli. It is tucked in the corner of a shopping center. They have a decent amount of tables and chairs outside if eating outdoors is your thing. Inside is clean, but the decor is dated. The booth I sat at had gashes in the seat. The inside isn't very big so I imagine trying to eat here on the weekend is a zoo. When you walk inside towards the left they have bagels & pastries for sale. I took a look but the case was empty and I was told by our server that they sell out quick in the mornings. They have a board when you enter that tells you what specials are going on that day.

They have a section on the menu that says "not so hungry" for those feeling like they can't tackle a whole sandwich themselves. You get 1/2 of a sandwich (your choice from the sandwich station area on the menu) and your choice of either a cup of soup, fries, coleslaw,  potato salad or fresh fruit on the side. I decided to order this priced at $9.95 and I can assure you that you do need to be hungry unlike the menu claims because the portions are generous. I decided to try the "Chicken Noodle Soup" and it was the best I have e-v-e-r had in my life! It was hardly a cup like the menu suggests and was filling all by itself. I could just sip on the broth for days! The soup had a couple bagel chips on the side that had such a nice garlic flavor. For my sandwich I went with the "Roast Turkey" on challah bread. The 1/2 sandwich was so big that I had to cut it in half just to eat it. The bread was seriously delicious!  I could only eat a portion of my sandwich and took the rest home for later. My hubby ordered a "Pastrami Burger" priced at $9.95 that came with a side of fries. He said the pastrami had good flavor. 

I saw on the menu they offer catering. 

The next time I stop in I will be trying out something from their tasty looking breakfast menu. I would stop in when working on this side of town just to get some of the soup to-go!

After hearing so much about Taco Taco I suggested it for dinner this last weekend. We made the drive across town and arrived around 9 pm. I could see as I was opening up to the door that nobody else was in line so I was a little nervous but with all of the hoopla and the drive over we wanted to give Taco Taco a shot. 

The signs above easily direct you to the line you want to order from. I knew I had to try the "Al Pastor Tacos" so I ordered 2 of those. I asked for pineapple but the worker said they didn't have any. I have seen other pictures with pineapple so they must have just been out for the day. I then made my way over to where hubby was at and I ordered a "Cheese Quesadilla" and a "Asada Taco". Hubby had already ordered a "Asada Burrito". You can choose corn or flour tortillas and they do make them right in front of you. By the time we finished ordering the place had filled up so we beat the rush! We grabbed our food and headed towards the back and found a pretty nicely sized dining area. There was a salsa bar with a variety of stuff. I didn't get anything from the salsa bar so I can't comment on if it was good or not. I can however comment on the following:

Cheese Quesadilla - This was priced at $2.25 and very good! It was filled with the perfect amount of cheese and wasn't really greasy. I would order this again.

Al Pastor - Priced at $2.00 each these didn't blow my socks off. It was missing the pineapple I love so much and just lacked the flavor I have had at other places. This is usually my favorite thing to order but not so much here. I will probably give it another try on a different day to see if something is different but if not I wouldn't order it again.

Asada Tacos - These were amazing. Such good flavor! I wish I had gotten more of these than the al pastor but I will know for next time. 

Asada Burrito - I didn't like this. Hubby gave me some to try and it just didn't have the same flavor as the asada in the tacos. They did pull the asada meat for the burrito from a different place then the asada that was on the grill for the tacos so I don't know if they make them different but I will personally stick to the asada tacos instead of the burrito.

They offer rice bowls and have vegetarian options. I can't say I will make the effort to drive across town just to eat at Taco Taco but when I am in the area I will stop in for sure since it is a cheap and good.

Craving pizza, we stopped here for dinner. Inside they have a decent amount of seating, though some of the seating is a bit too close to the next table. We seated ourselves and our server came over a few minutes later to greet us. There were no other customers when we arrived (some came in later) and it seemed odd that no employees were noticeable until the server came from the back. I ordered the "Mozzarella Sticks" priced at $6 to start. About 15 minutes later our server came back to take our main order (no mozzarella sticks in sight) and hubby and I shared a medium "Chicago Style Pizza" with 1/2 pepperoni & sausage and 1/2 garlic & ricotta. The pizza was priced at $19.65 and even for a medium pizza, it was hearty. I asked the server about the mozzarella sticks and she said they should be right out. Another 10 minutes later they arrived! I don't know what went into preparing them, but they took damn long enough! I thought the sticks were very good. Not worth what we waited, but good. The server did warn us that the pizza would take about 30 minutes. Lie! An hour later the pizza came out. I felt like family at this point I mean we had been there so long! The crust on the pizza was perfect and the sauce tasted great, Unfortunately, the garlic and ricotta were visible yet the flavor of them barely stood out at all. I might give the deep dish another try with different toppings in the future since the crust and sauce were good, but with some of the toppings I chose this time lacking in flavor (you should be able to taste fresh garlic!) and how long it took for service, I can't see coming back anytime right away. 

They charge $3 for delivery according to their menu. Mon - Fri they have a pizza and salad buffet for $7.95 (dine-in only) from 10am - 2pm.

We dropped into this Las Vegas hot spot prior to going to a show to grab a quick bite and catch up on the sports news for the day.  For the latter you'll need to sit at the bar which is exactly what we did.  Their beer and wine list is extensive as are the number of tap options at the bar.  I went for a bottled brew instead selecting one of my favorite tangerine ales instead of trying something new.

Their menu features appetizers, tiny buns which come two per order, big buns and milkshakes galore including a long list of boozed-up ones.  I was feeling a bit shaky, but my short supply of lactose intolerance tablets on myself made me put aside that idea of having the shakes for the night.  I stuck with my Lost Coast ale.

Pork belly buns, mini lobster rolls and tiny Chicago dogs seemed like popular picks in the Tiny Buns section, but I wanted something more substantial so I picked out the Korean "Bull"Gogi burger from the Big Buns section.  This was a burger glazed in a sweet soy sauce, topped with kimchee slaw, slathered with chili mayo and topped off with a fried egg.  The burgers come with seasoned skinny fries or steak fries.

Their kitchen works fast here as a short wait later we were already chowing down.  My burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=fBXXyjMoAlX3NvotKQLd-A) sat in a pool of glaze and it appeared the yolk on my fried egg was runny.  For a split second I considered picking up the knife and fork, but who doesn't eat with their hands while sitting at the bar?  On my first bite the yolk burst out of its egg white home and coated my face and fingers in hot yolky heaven.  There was no turning back at that point; I was going to finish this burger using my hands even if the entire thing fell apart.  It didn't by the way as the soft bun was one of the sturdiest I've ever held in my hand even soaked in with burger juices, sweet glaze and egg yolk.

The burger itself I'm thinking maybe a half pound of quality beef was cooked to a perfect medium and bursting with juice.  Considering how many ingredients were added to this burger the beef really stood out as that was the main component I kept tasting.  The kimchee slaw was nice and crunchy, but the chili mayo really provided no kick to the overall flavor of the burger.

My seasoned steak fries while generous in portion size were a bit too salty for me.  I loved my burger though just as my friends loved their mini pork belly buns and mini hot dogs.

I never have been a huge fan of Johnny Rocket's, so when I found out The Wiener's Circle would be taking the spot JR was in, I was happy. A lot of the signs say it's near the bowling alley when it's actually closer to the doors near the buffet. I have enjoyed my experience at The Wiener's Circle inside Red Rock, but there is something about this location inside Santa Fe that was just better to me. If you are familiar with the original The Wiener's Circle in Chicago, then you know they have a different attitude when it gets dark. Here at this location they don't sling any insults (they play games with customers and sling expected insults at the original location after a certain hour even handing out free food and shirts sometimes) or play any games, but what I have experienced is great customer service. The guy who took my order was very nice and patient while I went over the menu. He also told me about different combo deals that include fried and a drink. I have to give them props as far as the menu prices go. Being in a casino usually means marked up prices and sometimes not the same product you'd expect, but I found the prices to be fair and the food tasted great. I've been back a few times now and will be back plenty more! 

Char Dog - I got the combo priced at $6.99 that came with fries and a drink. The dog had onions, relish, mustard, pickles, tomatoes, peppers and celery salt. I asked that the dog be lightly charred and that's exactly what I got. The cook even came over to our table to make sure I liked it. I had them add cheese to my fries and the cheese sauce is thick and delicious! I could eat a huge pile (they already give you 1/2 pound with your order) of just those fries covered in cheese and my taste buds would be happy. 

Chicken Fingers - As a combo it was $7.99 with fries and a drink. They also give you a choice of mustard, ranch and honey mustard to dip your fingers. I really like the honey mustard here it goes well with the fingers. The fingers didn't look to plump or appetizing when I first saw them, but they really had good flavor and the chicken tasted good enough with out any sauce to dip, but trust me and pair it with the honey mustard. 

Wieners in a Blanket  - These were $4.99 and tasty little bites! They come 6 to an order, but when I got my order I noticed I had 8 of them. Score! You can choose a dipping sauce for these so I obviously chose honey mustard. I don't think these would fill someone alone, but they make a great snack to share along with your meal or nice portion for a kids meal. 

They have booths and tables or you can get your food to-go.

Las Vegas can be on the extremes at times with all of its glamour and luxury along with the back alley dirt on your dinner table; however, I've never been offended by Vegas until now.

HAZE may be the newest nightclub in town, but it sure won't last very long when the mystery is revealed that there's absolutely nothing special about this club except for a bunch of bouncers in the front all of whom think they are just too good for you. HAZE is not owned by Aria but by the Light Group which runs all of MGM / Mirage property clubs including Jet and the club at Hard Rock. If you've ever been mistreated at those clubs, now you know why. 

First, it's competition like someone mentioned is XS, Tryst, TAO and many other clubs that have amazing features such as beaches and pools, lagoons and pillars towering high above with gorgeous views of the strip. They have elegant and impressive bars and table areas. They have huge dance floors in multiple places and interesting tidbits like the girls in the bathtubs at TAO or the dancers at the pole at Tryst. Unfortunately for HAZE, they don't seem to have any of these features except for a small stage which divides the already small dance floor that contains a pole. They boast about having special shows that no other clubs have, but it's nothing more than going to a strip club on a B-grade night where a bald, head shaven female will come out and perform for you while hundreds watch on and wonder why she has no hair and is made up to look so scary instead of sexy.

This club is SMALL. It cannot hold many people and of all the people it does hold, its about 90% girls. No they will not go home with you nor will they party with you because they also have the same attitude as the bouncers in the front. Too. Good. For. You.

If you are a guy and you are trying to get in to this club, please save yourself some time and heartache because you will not get in even if you grease the bouncer $100+. If you get a table, you will have to deal with the fact that there's literally no space for you to dance and the waitress seems to be always missing so you can't get any service after paying $300 for a bottle of alcohol you can get from Costco in a bigger size for $55+tax. Even if you have 10 girls and 1 guy, the guy will get redirected to another line that will not move, and will be dispersed by the bouncers saying they are at capacity for people so cannot let anymore people in (but then will usher in 10 girl groups).

Despite the poor layout, poor design, poor air quality and extremely expensive drinks (mixed drinks for $20? are you kidding me? not even the Wynn has these kinds of prices for a Vodka and Pineapple), HAZE tries to limit to zero the number of guys going into the club.

Lets step back for a second. If the girls get in free, and guys buy girls drinks, and guys are in the club to find girls and are willing to pay to find and buy these girls drinks ... aren't guys the STAPLE of the Las Vegas clubbing scene? So why is it that every other club has this figured out already except for the newest supposedly "hippest" club in town?

Regardless, being a hotel guest I expected to have no problems getting in with the bf. We waited in line, like normal people would. We had VIP passes from our stay at Aria. We did not bitch, moan, complain or make a scene. Somehow, we were still separated after 45 minutes of waiting in line only to say that I could get in free but he would have to stay behind and wait in a line that may or may not get in at all. 

And when I tried to find someone to explain the situation where we were guests of the hotel, had waited for a long time, had VIP passes and there's no reason for me to be in a club by myself while he's out there waiting ... the main floor manager Mike cussed at me, shoved me physically and told me I had to get in or get out while completely being RUDE and did not listen to ANYTHING I had said. 

I understand Vegas is different, I understand guys have to pay more than girls, I understand they are trying to keep the girl to guy ratio high. What I don't understand is why someone has to be RUDE and use INAPPROPRIATE language in front of me when I have not done anything except ask if he could give me a minute so I could explain how I was frustrated at the situation. There's NO reason for him to put his hands on me, there is NO reason for him to be rude. 

Please take your business elsewhere. HAZE is not worth your time, their attitude is not worth you having to put up with it, and you will have a far better time at XS or TAO once you find out that HAZE is nothing more than smoke and mirrors located in a dingy basement with some lighting, overpriced drinks, and no room at all to move.

It's places like Forequarter that make me wish "hipster chic" was a category on Yelp... really. It's so full of cool even the cuffed slim red pant and denim shirt unbuttoned like I just don't care I was wearing made me feel sort of lamesies in a sea of hip and happening. Seriously, everyone who eats there is hip. The bar is hip. The tables are hip. The plates are hip. It's hip that they have this fine-ish dining setup going but use paper napkins [1] and mismatched silverware [2]. It's hip that they make ice cream to order! [3] So hip I need to footnote this review, and that's hip. But don't fret if you don't sport swagger, the place is accessible for those that wear glasses because they have to and don flannel because it's practical. 

We arrived around 7 and were told it would be 30 minutes for a table. NBD, there are plenty of seats at the bar and a cocktail menu that'll take even the surest of imbibers time to get through. I landed on a delicious apple brandy cocktail that I snapped so you can see it and read all the deets. Just as soon as our drinks arrived, maybe 5 minutes after we arrived, a table opened up. And this folks is when ish gets real. 

Forequarter has a tidy menu of 12 or so items. They range in price from 4 to 17 bucks and all are meant to share. I think. I mean I get bored after two minutes of the same thing, so I think all dishes ought to be shared. We started with a charcuterie plate, a special that night which came with Genoa salami, two kinds of mustard, giardiniera, sliced bread and a fennel apple salad. It was amazing. I wish their was more bread to sandwich the plentiful amount of meat, but I knew we had more coming. Mushrooms were next, four kinds of wild fungus mixed with some greens and toasted bread... we'll call those croutons. ;) [4] Next up were the lamb meatballs served with perfectly cooked lima beans. What do I mean by perfectly cooked? I mean al dente; nice chew but not raw. From there we moved on to the squash cavatelli, the standout winner. Take a fun pasta, add some crispy pieces of squash, grated cheese and a fried egg and life is good. We rounded out our meal with a rich chocolate ice-cream that was pretty bomb for ice cream. It was served with a raspberry fruit leather and the best almond cookie I've ever eaten. Don't go there tomorrow for it. They rotate their desserts every night [3]. 

All in all it was an awesome trip and I'm excited to go back. I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant and liked reading every option on the menu, and I can only guess as the weather cools, some warm and cozy things will find their way to Forequarter post fall. 

[1] I used to gripe about paper napkins and now I sort of feel like a. I'm wiping my mouth on the thing, do I care if it's cloth and b. I have to think it's much more green to go paper than to go cloth and use harsh solvents and water to clean. So I say viva paper. 

[2] My dessert spoon was just like a set we had growing up. I wanted to steal it, but then I thought, "I'd only have one!" Not "It's wrong to steal" but "what would I do with one?"

[3] How do you make ice-cream to order? Nitrogen. The base is made that day and contains egg, so it's more of a custard when it starts. An order comes in, nitrogen cools the custard and makes for a thick and creamy texture, and tada... delivered to your table is a cool creamy treat make seconds earlier. They aren't stuck with a bunch in the freezer at the end of the night like oh I dunno everywhere else that serves ice cream and keeps it on hand. And they can get through a base in a night (because it rocks) and swap in a new sweet treat nightly.

[4] It's ripped, it's toasted, it's bread. And their tongue and cheek play on Corey's favorite carb was noted. Bravo 4qtr.

Javier's is hit or miss at this location so that's why I gave four stars instead of five. I've been to them all practically, from Cabo, Mexico to Irvine to the one in the airport at John Wayne. Only Javier's I haven't been to is the one at Crystal Cove. 

For whatever reason, sometimes the food at the Aria location tastes consistent with my five star reviews of all their other locations, and sometimes it just tastes off. 

My first experience with this restaurant pissed me off and I almost didn't go back again. I ordered "enchiladas de mariscos" which is my favorite dish and what I order at all the other Javier's. I didn't think I even needed to look at the menu because I assumed it was the same as all the other locations, so I never bothered and just ordered away. I guess, in retrospect, I should have double-checked because the waiter brought me out chicken enchiladas instead of what I wanted. The second I tasted it I noticed something was not quite right but it was dark in there and I just assumed since this was a different Javier's and my first time, that maybe their cooks weren't up to speed out here in Vegas yet. The place was still somewhat new at the time. It didn't taste amazing like I was used to so I ate about half of one enchilada and then finally gave up, thinking another one bites the dust! I called the waiter over and told them that I was very disappointed with my dish (which I never do, for the record). I told him he must have brought me the wrong thing or the chef had no clue what was up and then he said, "No, I brought you what you ordered, enchiladas suizas." and I said, "No, I had ordered enchiladas de mariscos!" So yeah, obvious miscommunication there! That explained the mystery of why it didn't taste right. However, the waiter didn't offer to fix the situation and instead told me not to tip him. No clue what that was all about. Maybe the management takes it out of the waiters' tips if they get the orders wrong. I dunno... I've never had that happen before. Just thought that was the most interesting customer service I had ever received to date, if you even want to call that customer service. So needless to say, I left there unhappy that night. Thank god I complained because had I not, I would have written this place off as a no go. And waiter guy still got a tip even though I shoulda stiffed him! I'm too nice...

Anyway... Note to everyone who is used to calling it Enchiladas de Mariscos: It's actually called "Seafood Enchiladas" here and only here. Why my waiter, who spoke Spanish mind you, didn't get this right is beyond me but whatever! Mariscos translates to "seafood". What's the problemo, seor? Since the staff doesn't get it, they should be told that at the other locations this particular dish is called something different so technically it has two names. And they should be told what that name is so as to avoid other Javier's professionals, like me, from getting chicken enchiladas when they want seafood. And one more thing, if the waiters get it wrong, they should credit you back the price of your dish or remake your food for you the right way, at least. None of that don't tip me BS because that still doesn't make up for your mistake!

Anywhoooo... hate to admit it but these aholes at Javier's sure make good food (sometimes at this location, not 100% consistent) so that's why I keep coming back and not boycotting, in spite of my bad first impression with this Aria location. And it's not like I'm about to take a four hour drive to Cali just to satisfy my Javier's craving elsewhere. So I guess they have me stuck eating here, from time to time, when my cravings hit.

I absolutely love their organic margaritas (cadillac style). I guess after a few of those I'm willing to accept any of the crap that jerk Javier wishes to dish at me. I'm such a sucker! Their chips and salsa are addictive so be careful. Mustn't be too full for when your entre arrives! Another thing, the atmosphere here is a 10! I love that dark, Guernica style carving along the back wall. This is a great place to take a date. *hint hint, nudge nudge* Hear that boys? Just pray that they don't get her order wrong or if they do, that your date is laid back.

Since we were in Phoenix for an entire week, we asked around for lots of restaurant recommendations.  Pizzeria Bianco was mentioned quite often.  Some said it was the best pizza in Phoenix, while others said they were known nationally for their pizza.  Since we were only a few blocks away, we headed over on a Saturday night to check it out. 

The first thing you notice when you get there is how small the location is.  It's an old house that's been converted into a restaurant.  There are approximately 12 tables, along with bar seating for an additional 10 people or so.  Since it was a Saturday night, the wait time was 30-45 minutes.  

You have the option of waiting outside at the picnic tables next to the restaurant, but seeing how Phoenix is in the middle of a desert that's not a great option during the summer.  What is a great option is walking next-door to Bar Bianco.  It's also an old house that's been converted, but this time into a bar and lounge area.  It makes for the perfect spot to have an adult beverage and relax while you wait for your table.  And the system they have in place is stress-free.  When your table is ready, the hostess calls over to the bartender to let them know.  Easy as can be.

We ended up sitting at the bar, which worked out great because the bartender shared lots of information about the restaurant with us.  Bianco is known for their artisanal pizza, in the certified Neapolitan style.  We ordered three pizzas as well as an appetizer, so we could try a little bit of everything.

First up was the appetizer of Spiedini, which consisted of Fontina cheese wrapped in prosciutto, served warm over a bed of greens (spinach, I believe).  Warmed Italian meat and cheese? Yes, please!  Next up were the pizzas; Margherita, Sonny Boy, and Wiseguy.  All of the pizzas are cooked in the wood-fired oven, giving the thin crust a delicious crispness.  The Margherita was delicious in its simplicity of tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil.  The Wiseguy had sausage and the most amazing caramelized onions I've ever tasted, thick sliced and full of seasoning.  These are the kind of onions you would expect to be served as a side dish at a high-end steakhouse.  But my favorite pizza of the night was the Sonny Boy.  I loved the sodium-laden combination of salami and kalamata olives.  It may be too salty for some, but I thought it was perfect.

Although the Sonny Boy was my favorite, the other two weren't far behind.  It's a very simplistic menu, with only a few preset options of pizza.  But everything we tried was awesome, and the reputation for being the best pizza in Phoenix appears to be well earned.

Wow!  Now that I've been to Rose.Rabbit.Lie, I understand how the whole thing fits together and works.  I had a free ticket for the show last night and I made a dinner reservation, too.  The website said they were fully booked, but when I called the Cosmopolitan, she made a reservation for me.

I got my ticket at the box office on the second floor and went to the Rose.Rabbit.Lie entrance at 6 PM for my reservation.  There was a couple in line ahead of me.  They weren't yet open.  There's a lot of security and ear pieces in this area across from the Wicked Spoon buffet.  When they opened, the woman asked me if I wanted a table or to sit at a bar.  Since I was alone, I told her the bar.  She asked which one I wanted to go to and I couldn't answer.  I let her choose and she took me to the Library Bar.

There are several rooms behind closed doors after you enter the main door.  On the left was the Library, a small room with about 8 tables and 8 or so seats at the bar.  I took the end seat and I was so glad this was where I was.  We could hear the music from next door--it turned out to be the Music Room--and the bartender who waited on me was Anthony!  He was perfect--knowledgable about the menu and he made some great recommendations to me.  

Most of the dishes are tapas style.  I ordered the Brussels sprouts with crispy chicken skin. Manchego cheese and Spanish paprika.  I also ordered Tte de Cochon--pig head with a slow cooked egg.  The pig head was cooked and the meat was seasoned and formed into a small rectangle.  It was lightly battered with panko breadcrumbs and lightly fried.  Served with a soft poached egg, it was delightful.  Breaking the egg and letting it run over the pork was so very good!  The Brussels sprouts were wonderful!  I could not have had two better recommendations!

I chose desert on my own.  I ordered the butterscotch pudding with a chocolate and hazelnut "stone".  The dessert was a perfect ending to the meal.  The butterscotch was salted and the "stone" was very tasty!

Service was excellent and sitting at the bar was a show in itself.  Anthony showed me and the gentleman seated next to me the 3 kinds of special ice cubes they make for Rose.Rabbit.Lie.  Quite interesting and creative.

From here, I was shown to the Music Room where I listened to a 5 piece combo play.  There was a singer who walked on the bar in the Music Room.  One of the entertainer/ushers--a friend of mine--came in to work.  I had no idea he had gotten a job here.  He told me that we'd be shown into the Ballroom (another place to eat and drink) and then we'd go to the showroom.  The combo and the singers went into the Ballroom and then the doors were opened to the Showroom.  

The show is called Vegas Nocturne and although the website lists it as 70 minutes, it's more like 95 minutes in length.  There are two types of chairs and I got seated in a row that had the hard folding chairs.

The show is a milder version of its cousin, Absinthe.  The acts are lower key in a way because of the low ceiling.  The acts are very good, the comedy is quite funny, and it was a perfect end for my evening.  Katy Perry was in the audience.

This was a wonderful evening and I'm so glad I went.  I'm not sure I'd pay the full price for the show.  It's a bit steep considering the other entertainment available on the Strip but as part of an entire evening at Rose.Rabbit.Lie, it was just perfect!

***Bouchon's brunch is a good and not-too-expensive alternative to Vegas' breakfast buffets and their chicken and waffles is a good place to start***

This Bouchon location at The Venetian is open for breakfast Monday thru Friday, dinner nightly and brunch on the weekends.  I believe the Beverly Hills location is just open for lunch and dinner so it made sense to give this Vegas spot a try for a nice brunch.

Bouchon is located on the tenth floor of the hotel.  They seem to have three dining areas--a classic indoor brasserie, outdoor dining and a private room for private parties and larger groups (which is where we dined on this visit).  I haven't been to their outdoor dining area, but the private room lacks the classic French brasserie feel of the main dining area.  The tables though are still nice (white table cloth) and the seating is comfortable.

For brunch, they started us off with a complimentary epi baguette that was served with butter and a smooth/thick cherry jam.  The epi baguette (a wheat stalk shaped bread where you rip off individual baguettes) was good.  The bread's crust was good and distinct while the center had a good chew to it.  The butter spread easily and the jam was flavorful.

I went with their signature roasted chicken and bacon and chive waffles.  The roasted chicken was very good.  It was a half chicken.  The breast was tender and moist.  The skin had a great flavor and was nicely crispy.  The thigh and leg had much more flavorful meat as well as crispy skin (not too greasy or fatty either).

They served the chicken with a Sauce Chasseur.  The chicken was very flavorful and did not need it, but the sauce was a great accompaniment.  The sauce was similar to a brown gravy and was very flavorful.  The sauce had a good white wine taste to it and there were chunks of good veggies in it including mushrooms, carrots and onions.

The bacon and chive waffle was fluffy.  It was an interesting flavor combination.  First, you taste the vanilla (they used a good amount of it in the waffle).  Then you get the crispy and savory bacon taste.  Then you get the onion-like chive taste.  The waffle was garnished with a creamy Tahitian vanilla butter and maple syrup.  I am not sure if the flavor combination would be for everyone, but I liked the waffle.

I also had some of the bacon a la carte and it was pretty good.  Flavorful and crisp though maybe not as good as some of the premium bacon out there (like the Niman Ranch bacon they serve at Huckleberry).

Service was good.  The waiter was friendly, polite and attentive.  The rest of the staff was attentive too.  Food came out an okay pace (maybe slightly slower than we would have liked).  Still, despite being a large party, all the food came out at about the same time.

For brunch, pricing was high here, but then pricing is high at a lot of Vegas restaurants.  Entrees run anywhere from about $15 to $25 here.  The good thing is that portions on most of the dishes are big enough that you do not have to supplement your order with any sides or pastries (they were providing a complimentary coffee cake-like dish in the waiting area and it was good).

This was my second visit to the Las Vegas Bouchon.  I've also been to the Beverly Hills one.  The roasted chicken and waffles was the best thing I've had here at either location and I would most likely come back here again for brunch if I was in Vegas for the weekend.  Service and food have been decent enough on both visits that I would also consider them for dinner.

There is a free parking structure at The Venetian.  The free parking structure has elevators that conveniently take you to the Bouchon restaurant without having to walk through the casino.

Let's get straight to the point, this little Thai restaurant is skyrocketing near the top of my list.  I was extremely impressed with this place.  While the atmosphere feels like a small hole in the wall, and the seating may be a little cramped, rest assured that this is some of the best authentic Bangkok style food in Vegas as of this review.  

On my first visit I tried the Pot Stickers ($5.95), Green Curry Fried Rice ($7.95), and Green Curry with Beef ($6.95).  The Pot Stickers were similar to the ones served at TSNH.  The fried shell had a light crispness to it, and it was topped with a creamy orange sauce (I think it's the same sauce you get on a lot of sushi rolls).  They were pretty good, although nothing to rave about.  At least, not compared to the next two dishes.

The Green Curry Fried Rice was absurdly good.  Spiced heavily with just enough heat (I ordered a 7/10), the balance in flavor was spot on while still having that strong herbal/spicy array of authentic flavor.  The vegetables, which included short slices of green beans, were firm and juicy (not as juicy as good ol' Pan Asian mind you).  The chunks of chicken breast were most impressively juicy and tender as well.  I highly recommend this dish to any Thai food lover.  They don't hold back on the flavor. All kinds of lemongrass, basal, and other delicious spicy flavors explode with this dish.

The Green Curry itself, ordered with beef, was one of the best I have had in a very long time.  It was a thin Bangkok style curry with lots of bamboo, green and red peppers, etc.  Any Thai food lover knows that it is hard to find an exceptional Bangkok style green curry.  I think this one has trumped Krung Thai for my favorite green curry in town.  The balance of flavor was again amazing.  Many Thai restaurants either hold back on the spicing ingredients or can't balance them properly.  This place does it right.  The only complaint that I could see maybe is that there wasn't a ton of beef, but to me the curry itself is so good that it doesn't even need it.  A+ green curry right here, folks.

On visit two we had the Roast Duck Curry ($8.95), Larb with Pork ($6.95), Pineapple Fried Rice ($7.95), and Drunken Noodles with chicken ($6.75).  Again, the food was stellar the second time around, and again the Roast Duck Curry stole the show.  It had a strong yet balanced and lightly sweet flavor, very savory while still a thin consistency.  The pineapple tasted fresh, and the duck was of the highest quality.  The only complaint I would have is that there could have been more duck meat, but I would rather have less of a higher quality meat.  The price is certainly right regardless.  The curries here are authentic and balanced at the same time, completely stellar.  

The Pineapple Fried Rice was excellent as well, with a light grilled flavor balanced with the sweetness of fresh pineapple.  The cashews tasted fresh and were absolutely delightful.  The Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mow at some other restaurants) was also great.  The Larb was slightly dry for my taste, but very flavorful. It wasn't too sour but definitely had some sourness to it, and had lots of other savory flavors to balance it out.  Most Larbs I have had lately are very one sided in the sour department, but not this one.  Multidimensional flavor seems to be the theme to this place!

I would probably give Thai Food To Go a 4/5 over all, but the curries here are so off the hook that I have to bump this one up to a 5.  I can't express my previous frustration with not being able to find really good, authentic tasting Bangkok style curry in this town.  Thai Food To Go has finally filled that gap for me, and I can't wait to go back. (Note: I was told the place has new owners as of about 6 months ago).

It was opening day so of course there were going to be issues. I knew that going in and it was pretty much what I expected -- wait times for slides ranged from 1-2 hours. But the park never felt that crowded, thanks to them closing the gates when they reached max capacity. 

It's a good thing I got there at 6:30 and another person in our party got there at 5:30. There was the expected rush to get in but most people in line were cool about it. We were some of the first hundred or so people in and had no problem snagging inner tubes (which you only need for the lazy river and maybe the wave pool) and lounge chairs.

Here's a quick rundown of positives and negatives from the first day:

Positives
+ Friendly staff. They didn't always know the answers to questions, but they always smiled and tried to be helpful. 
+ It was great that they had people manning the locker area and walking people how to rent a locker, find it and work it. Prices for lockers range from $8-12 and can be accessed throughout the day.
+ Slidin' Thru. The park food wasn't good, of course, so it was nice to see the Slidin' Thru Food truck set up in the back right corner of the park. Prices were higher than usual, but I can't fault them for making a good business decision. Let's hope we see more food trucks here in the future.
+ The main restrooms by the lockers have showers.

Negatives
- They ran out of food. By 1pm their cafe was out of almost everything. So I walked over to their buffet, purchased a wrist band for it and proceeded to wait almost 2.5 hours in line. That long wait was due to their buffet running out of food. They had to wait for a couple delivery trucks to drop off more food, then heat it/cook it. They only had hot dogs and pizza when I finally made it through. Typically I think they have salads and other options. But remember, this is a water park. Don't come here expecting Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon-quality food. Think high school cafeteria.
- Not enough rental tubes. This didn't effect me since we got the last of the rental ones. But there were lots of unhappy people left at the rental counter and at the lazy river. I guess they should have gotten there earlier.
- Poor signage at the cafe. There are separate lines to order food and pick up food. Make sure you're in the right ones.
- No outside food or drink is allowed. But you can bring in water bottles only if they're unopened (factory sealed)

Comments/Observations
- Buffet prices are $12.99 ($9.99 for kids and season ticket holders). They give you a wrist band and you can go through as often as you like throughout the day.
- Some families were only buying one buffet wristband and had that one family member go through and get food for everyone. One chick walked out with two plates of pizza, about 6 hot dogs and a few salads. haha
- There are only 30 or so cabanas for rent. You can rent them in advance for here on out. If you get a cabana you can also get food service. A great option if you want to avoid the long lines at the cafe.
- I didn't have problems with parking but if you can't get into the main lot there are plenty of dirt lots within walking distance to the park.
- For the majority of slides you have to wait in a line to get a tube/floaty, then head to a different line to wait for your turn on that slide. Some groups will split up -- one person will wait in the line to get a tube and another in the line for the slide. This will minimize their wait time because by the time the person gets the tube, the other person will be close to the front of the line for the slide. Some may think of this as cutting in line -- and as an old crabby dude, I would agree -- but congrats kids on thinking outside the box.
- There are plenty of grassy area to layout if you don't get a lounge chair, so feel free to bring blankets along with towels.
- I only went on 2 slides (the Rattler and Constrictor, both were fun) and the lazy river and wave pool. It's a good thing I prepped my kid ahead of time and told him he'd probably only go on a few slides, not all of them. It's important to set your kid's expectations to lessen the chance of a meltdown.

It wasn't a perfect opening day, but the most important thing is that my five year old walked away thinking it was loads of fun. Plus he was wiped out by 7pm. Despite some negatives  (mainly running out of food) it was a fun family day and Wet 'n' Wild is a long overdue addition to the community.

I had this place on my radar, so when fellow yelper, Loon E. and his girl were in town and suggested this place, I was all in! Walking inside it seemed dark, but I liked it. We chose a table and menus and waters were quickly brought to us. Loon had a beer I tasted that was supposed to be ginger flavored, but the ginger taste was very faint. After looking over the menu it was hard to decide what to order because it all looks so good. 

The menu consists of signature, premium and vegetarian pasties, soups, salads, desserts and an interesting variety of appetizers. To start I ordered "Oven Chips" priced at $3.50 plus an additional 50 cents for cheese I wanted on them. The chips are hand cut British style and baked in the oven with cracked pepper and sea salt. I thought the chips were a bit on the soggy side. I wondered if it was because of the addition of cheese that made them soggy, but after tasting the oven chips with jalapeno and no cheese that the others at my table were sharing, they too were mushy and soggy to me.

I ordered a "Carne Adovada" pasty priced at $9.50 and WOW! After the first bite, my taste buds were dancing with joy! This pasty has simmered pork in a New Mexican red chili stew, rice, chilies and cheddar. It also comes with a side of salsa and sour cream. There is so much great flavor going on in this pasty! I honestly never even tried the salsa that accompanied it because the pasty itself has such good flavor on it's own, but I did really enjoy it with the sour cream. I must come back and eat this again! I sampled some of the "Bangers and Mash" pasty and thought the first bite was okay, but the next was a bit blah. The red wine gravy that came with it was too salty. I have to say that it isn't something I have ever had before, so I truly can't compare it to another, but the flavor wasn't for me.

Our server was just great! I wish I could remember her name to give her a proper shout-out, but I can tell you aside from being an awesome waitress, she knows all about Emoji and how everybody needs a little in their life! ;)

If you wanted they have an option to take a part-baked pasty home to bake when you are ready to eat it. The part-baked pasties are sold at a reduced price, but they make a certain amount fresh throughout the day, so I would recommend calling your order in to make sure they can have the pasty you want ready to take home. I want to come back at some point to try out some of their other sides and try baking a pasty at home to see how it turns out. With the variety of pasties here, if a certain one doesn't work for you flavor-wise, give another one a try! Maybe you will find a favorite like I did!

I have been back several times before writing this review update just to make sure all the inconsistency that I have been experiencing is now the way of Bagel Cafe and not just an off day they were having. I'm prepared for the loyal fixtures to be upset, but if you really have been eating here since it opened then you know it's not the same. I first started eating here at Bagel Cafe (I was a teenager) after it opened. It was worth the long wait to get a table as the food was spot on excellent. Sure we all know the best breakfast in town is at the Omelet House on Charleston, but this place definitely came close behind at one point. In the last 6 months I have experienced meals here at Bagel Cafe that were just not worth the money or wait for what you got. They don't even use Boar's Head deli meats anymore! WTH?!?!?!? They use some brand I have never heard of. The taste and quality of the deli meat just isn't the same as it used to be. They claim the bagels are made fresh daily yet they are rock hard. I have never liked the bagels here, but if it's in your name.... live up to it!

As you can tell from my previous review and pictures, I really used to like this place. Consistency is a major issue. The sandwiches used to be made with Boar's Head deli meat and was piled high between the bread of your choice and a real winner. Now you get some other brand of meat just bunched up in a ball between 2 dry pieces of bread. I can do that at home! Then there is breakfast. I usually order breakfast here. The last 3 times the coffee has tasted bitter and nasty. Getting a refill was a major chore as well. I noticed the servers didn't have name tags on my last visit or I would give a proper shout-out to the waitress who has messed up my order lately and has terrible customer service. I ordered "One Egg any style W/Bacon" priced at $8.95 and asked for eggs to be scrambled with shredded cheddar cheese on top. Such a simple breakfast right? Apparently not For Bagel Cafe. The breakfast also came with a bagel of my choice and breakfast potatoes. When my food arrived I noticed there was a slice of cheddar cheese on my eggs. UGH! If you don't have shredded cheese just let the customer know so they can maybe make another choice. I would have had the egg over medium or easy to dunk my bacon in if I had known. The "Asiago" bagel I had was so tough and hard!  I was with another yelper one of my last visits and showed him how I was able to bang the bagel on the table and it just broke in pieces.  The bacon was terrible. From the picture it looks heavenly, but let me tell you it was rock hard and seemed like it was honestly pulled from the fridge or something. When my meal arrived the bacon was missing, so I informed our waitress and she replies to me "oh did you want bacon?" to which I'm like HELL YES why would I have ordered a breakfast that comes with it if I didn't want it? She then brings me the cold/hard bacon and when the receipt comes she charged me $3.50 for a side of bacon. Seriously? It was supposed to come with the breakfast I ordered. She made me feel like I had done something wrong when she actually is a very lousy waitress. The potatoes I had were the only thing edible on the plate and even those aren't the same potatoes as they have had in the past. With this place not being consistent and having waitresses who can't do their job right, I'm going to  BabyStacks Cafe and Omelet House from now on for breakfast and will make the drive to Henderson to eat at Weiss.

Sweets Raku is the brainchild of Mitsuo Endo of the Abriya Raku fame (a 3-time James Beard Award nominee). The concept of this restaurant is a dessert bar, where you come in, order off a prefix menu, or order the desserts  la carte. Being a dessert bar, you will be served desserts only (but I've heard that they also have a cheese plate). After hearing some interesting comments about this dessert bar, I went with a buddy after my SnowFlake Shavery fix to get some dessert.

SR is located in the Seoul Plaza on Spring Mountain Road and Jones. It actually sits across the same building complex as Raku. Walking inside, you'll notice an amazing display of bottles of water and other refreshments built into a see-through wall. The clean, modern, and white interior give you a sense that the people who created this restaurant really wanted to give you an unforgettable experience. There is an open kitchen, and around it sits a bar with around 15 seats where you can watch all the desserts being made right in front of your eyes! There are also tables, but if you have the opportunity, sit at the bar and enjoy the show.

The pastry chef is Mio who is in charge of the kitchen. She's been a pastry chef for over a decade in Japan, but you would never guess due to her youthful appearance. The server dropped off a menu that was rolled up in a sugar ribbon ring. After ordering our drinks and the prix fix menu, we waited for Mio to start. The menu is also edible, and I thought that was a real neat and fun idea to be able to eat a menu!  It didn't have a taste at all, which is good because I would have gagged if it tasted like paper. The server then brought us our drinks.

- Americano coffee: They use the Illy brand coffee, and it was bold and well made.

The Amuse/First course came up first:

- Strawberry and Mint: A strawberry sorbet with mint jelly, with a fresh sprig of micromint. The strawberry sorbet had a nice strawberry flavor. The texture was sort of weird for me, it wasn't icy... but I guess it wasn't as smooth as I would have liked.  It's hard to describe. On the other hand, the texture of the mint jelly was well done, but I couldn't really taste the mint flavor that much.

The main entrees then arrived:

- Mt. Fuji: This was a play on the classic French dessert, the Mont Blanc. This was my favorite dessert of the night. The chestnut cream was amazingly light and had a smooth chestnut flavor. The cake was moist, and the chestnut glace complimented the whole dish. The presentation was also pretty cool.

- Apollo: Chocolate and raspberry mousse on top of chocolate cake, Earl grey tea ice cream, raspberry meringue, chocolate bases, and raspberry sauce. I thought the mousse's were all well made and so was the chocolate cake. The chocolate squares around the plate and the Earl Grey Tea ice cream were my favorite part of the dish. The ice cream tasted exceptionally well with the pink peppercorns that were ground on top. I thought the meringue and raspberry sauce were O.K. This was my least favorite dessert, I thought, flavor wise... it was just too safe.

The petit fours/Last Courses arrived:

- Parmesan cheesecake with oranges: I loved the concept of this dish. It is like eating two different courses in one dish. By itself, the cheesecake is very savory, and I thought that this would make a nice appetizer on a restaurant menu. But then, after eating the cheesecake together with the oranges, it complimented the savoriness of the cheesecake perfectly, and it became a dessert again! I found this to be absolutely fascinating.

- Chocolate Fondant with marshmallows: The warm chocolate molten cake was well executed with a cakey outer shell, and a warm molten interior. It was a well balanced cake. My favorite accompaniment of the night had to go to the lemon marshmallows. They had a bright, strong,  lemon flavor, and they tasted just like a lemon curd! I thought the raspberry marshmallows were lacking in raspberry flavor, but the texture was good.

The service throughout the night was top notch. The server knew when we needed drinks refilled, and cleared our plates at the right time. She was super friendly and knowledgeable and engaged with us enough, but not overly smothering.

Dining at Sweets Raku brought an old smile to my face. It brought me back to those pre-"Great Recession" days. I remembered when the properties on the Strip were in competition with each other... not money-wise like they are now...but quality wise. Back then, F&B programs were trying to think of ways to create unforgettable experiences to their guests. Now, it's all about the bottom line, which is why we only see now burger joints, bars, and steak houses popping up, with inconsistent service everywhere. There are some flubs in this place, but you can find flaws at Raku, Joel Robuchon, The French Laundry, etc. But, this place deserves 5 stars, because.. it's the thought that counts. 

Kudos to Chef Endo and Chef Mio, true artisans of their profession!!!

I believe you need a lot of sophistication to enjoy Japanese Curry. It's just these small little differences with the spices that separates  a J-Curry place from being "good" and "great". And, I believe that JAPANESE CURRY ZENBAYASHI has achieved Greatness. 

This is a rare Japanese restaurant where they pay attention to the smallest details. For example, today the Rakkyo was perfectly cut in a distinct geometric style, which made every single piece look identical in size and shape. At first, I thought I was seeing things but eventually after watching Mr. Zenbayashi working so carefully in the kitchen, I came the conclusion that they spend hours before the store opens preparing everything to look beautiful and artistic.

Unlike similar restaurants, JCZ will refrigerate the condiments such as Tonkatsu Sauce, Rakkyo, and Fukujinzuke. They wait till a customer arrives and then they bring them out with new clean serving spoons. Other places around town will merely keep the condiments sitting out on the table all day long with the same serving spoons which had been touched by many dirty hands. But, you won't find that problem here. This is the most spotless and clean restaurant I have seen in Las Vegas.  Even the bathroom looked like no one had ever used it. 

Just like INABA, this place prides itself on having a dish that not only tastes great, but has tons of health benefits. They have a homemade Gram Masala which is a combination of about 15 spices such as Turmeric, Coriander, Black Pepper, Cumin, Cardamom, Fennel, Japanese Chili Pepper, Ginger, Garlic, Paprika, and many more. Unlike Indian Curry, J-Curry is lower in calories and fat content. It also has anti-oxidents, digestive benefits, blood cleansing, and even anti-aging benefits. 

I actually came here by accident today, I spent most of the day loitering at Jen G's place of work.  After about 3 hours of bugging her, she told me to "BUY SOMETHING OR GET OUT!", so I went straight to JCZ! ...Just kidding. Actually, the true story does involve me loitering at Jen G's place of employment, but we had a conversation about Kabuto, and both of us agreed we should go there and give it another try. I actually didn't like my last visit to Kabuto on account of being spoiled by Urusawa in LA. But, I ended up going over there anyway  to make a reservation. While I was in the parking lot, I noticed the JCZ sign.  David Y had recommended the place to me earlier, and he told me that it was exactly what he used to get in Japan, so I gave it a try. And Dave was right, it was the best. I don't know why people would rather eat at overrated Monta when JAPANESE CURRY ZEN is only a 15 second walk. And the best part of JCZ is that it doesn't have a 2 hour waiting list, uncomfortable seating, overflowing toilet, hipsters and emos reciting poetry, and non-japanese cooks who cook the eggs in the back alley(read my review on Monta to understand that better). And that's another thing that makes JCZ great, it's 100% Japanese staffed. Sure, I actually know Chinese and Filipino Sushi Chefs who make some Japanese ones look like amateurs, but the point is that it's always so unique to find a J-restaurant that is 100% Japanese staffed.

The best thing on the menu is the Pork Tenderloin Curry. Do not confuse this with the normal Pork Cutlet. The Pork Tenderloin Curry will not be on the main menu. You have to ask for it specifically. Today, the cook put so much attention into making sure the cutlet was fried perfectly. The color was beautifully golden brown, and the texture of the meat was so juicy and soft that I ended up eating it all in less than 5 minutes. 

This was the best service I have ever had as a 1st timer. Sure, there are some Japanese owned restaurants that treat me better, but that's because I've spent a lot of money there. For example, when I walk into "Sushi on Rainbow", it's like that scene in "Goodfellas" when Robert De Niro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they open the door for him, save him  his usual seat, and everyone gets whatever he wants before he even has to ask. That's how good some places treat me because I show up regularly, I treat older Japanese workers with a lot of respect,  and because I'm f*cking rich I tend to leave giant tips. But, even though this was my first time at JAPANESE CURRY ZEN, they already were treating me like I had spent over $1000 here. And of course, even though I only spent like $10.00 on curry I left a $20 tip. And the server earned every penny of that because it really was the best service I've had in years. 

JAPANESE ZEN CURRY is a small independent business, not a million dollar bankrolled J-restaurant. Even though there is a rumor that this place is owned by the Mon-group, the server told me that it's just not true. This is a small business that needs the support of the Japanese-American community here in Las Vegas. So, I encourage all LV Japanese residents to come try this place out and support them.

There seems to be a bit of hate for this restaurant based on previous reviews.  Luckily for me there weren't many negatives about my meal here.  So busy in my escapades around Las Vegas on my second day there I completely forgot about taking a break for lunch.  After perusing the menu the night before and observing dishes of what other patrons seemed to be enjoying I decided to drop in on the Dragon Noodle Co. inside the Monte Carlo Hotel & Casino for an early dinner.

I was seated quickly by the restaurant's hostess.  Because it seemed not too busy I was given the option of sitting at a table, at the bar, in the lounge, at the sushi bar or in the main dining room.  I chose the latter, and I was quite surprised as the main dining room was nearly full.  This is another pricey Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas; although, it is not nearly as pricey as Jasmine at the Bellagio.

The heavy fabric napkins are all sleeved in paper holders printed with the restaurant's graphics (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=TaA0bI9GiB-96VrSODPxEw).  The restaurant uses a baby boy's face (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=DY_GqwfhoJGhbAY1ghUYDg) similar to the little peach boys of Chinese folklore (supposedly brings good fortune) as its main logo, and that image is amusingly plastered throughout the dcor of the restaurant.  The wait staff will come around, unsleeve your napkin and place it on your lap for you.  I was quite new to this service so I stopped the young lady and gestured that I can do that myself.  Looking back it was pretty comical what I was actually thinking, but she took my beverage order and walked away.

Three menus are presented, a dinner menu, a sushi menu and a huge, thick binder listing wines and spirits served.  It's a bit too early for a drink, and I never eat sushi at Chinese restaurants so away went those two menus.  They give you time to order here.  My peripheral vision noticed the waiter glancing my way every now and then, but he did not approach my table until I put down the menu.  I ordered the Salt & Pepper Calamari and the Roast Duck half.  Steamed rice is included with most entrees.

My bowl of rice and the calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=-HfxZmaC7AGYoN11jcimug) were brought out rather quickly.  Understandable as roast duck usually warrants additional preparation time.  The calamari was very good.  The calamari filets were scored, battered and deep fried.  There was just a hint of greasiness.  Salt, pepper and chopped jalapenos are used to season the battered calamari which were served on a bed of shredded lettuce with minced onion and garlic and more jalapeno slices.  The calamari had a nice kick to it.

The roast duck (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ?select=trW1SO7_8uHDTfpnsdTGpQ) was brought out a short time later.  It was served with a sweet and sour plum sauce which I found to be a bit generic in taste.  Where do these places find these ducks that are thick in meat and flavor and can't be found in San Francisco?  I loved the duck which was traditionally roasted Hong Kong style with the thin crispy skin similar to Peking ducks.  The flavor of the marinade was very good and there was tons of duck meat to enjoy.  

It took me a bit of time, but I managed to polish off everything.   Even so the waiter came by twice to check if everything was okay and whether I wanted more rice.  At the end of my meal he brought me a hot disinfectant towlette sealed in plastic to clean my hands and face.  I passed on dessert although the thought of having some freshly fried sesame balls did enter my mind.

Now, I rarely ever write mediocre 3 Star reviews, but in my honest opinion, my tepid experience wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. With that said, here's the rundown of what transpired on the evening of July 4th... After reading rave reviews from friends and fellow Yelpers, i decided to choose Le Cirque to celebrate my best friend's birthday. The restaurant was bustling when we arrived. We were seated towards the back which was upsetting since I requested a window seat months in advance. A few tables were still vacant by the window, which I found puzzling. Moments later those same seats were filled with other patrons, same number of guests mind you, that came after us. Not a good start so far. 

Granted the place was busy, it's no excuse for the waiter to make us feel rushed. He seemed hurried and not warm yet he was quite efficient at taking our orders and whisking away in a flash.  He clumsily scattered our silverware on the table like we were dining at Denny's. Wait, even at Denny's our utensils are placed with more care than this jumbled mess.

We all went with the degustation menu at 135$ per person and the birthday boy went with the 88$ additional wine pairing, as well. With a bottle of French Pinot Gris on the table, we were good to go.

The breads weren't warm, but room temperature and very chewy. 
I went with the onion bacon and pretzel. The pretzel was salty and too tough to eat and the onion bacon was hard and practically indelible. 

Thankfully, our amuse bouche was a refreshing bite sized cucumber wrapped creme fraiche treat that awakened my palate perfectly. 

The first course was incredible.  It was a delicate langoustine osetra caviar carpaccio with crisp sliced green apples that simply made my taste buds pop at first bite. The contrasting textures and flavors went from tart to tangy to sweet and spectacular. A splendid first course.

Here's where it gets bad, again. The time period between the first and second course went from lengthy to uncomfortably long. Luckily I was in good company and we had pleasant conversation that helped pass the time but the extensive wait (30 minutes) was inexcusable.
We inquired with our server and he quickly rushed into the kitchen without responding to us. Moments later, our dishes came out from one of the support staff that appeared agitated and rushed, as well. What was going on here? There was plenty of staff standing around, yet the same few guys were running frantically around the small restaurant. Strange. 

The scallops were supple, buttery and exhibited an excellent mouthfeel.

The foie gras was magnificent. The combination with the sweet plump cherries was genius.

The fresh black truffle risotto was a huge disappointment, however. The risotto was undercooked and hard, which is not the consistency a good risotto should feel like. The only saving grace were the finely sliced black truffles sprinkled on top, that left a subtle yet heavenly aroma to this mediocre dish. At an additional 40$ supplement to the 135$ per person tasting menu, I expected better. I would have sent it back but refrained in fear of an even longer and more excruciating wait time.

The third courses were far more redeeming with the beautifully crusted cod that tasted like butter in my mouth and the sea bass that was simply heavenly
The John Dory was good but paled in comparison to the complex flavor profiles of the other two mind blowing dishes. 

The fourth dishes were fantastic, too. Namely the Kobe. It was literally melt in your mouth delicious. It came at an additional 65$ premium but it was well worth it. Divine in every way!

The duck was supple and the flesh was smooth and velvety soft. 

The rabbit was tasty but I couldn't help but feel it tasted like chicken.

The pre-dessert was bright and whimsical. A tequila lime sorbet with fresh grapefruit and poprocks was inventive, surprising, refreshing and a perfect palate cleanser

In regards to dessert, don't skip it. You would be making a huge mistake. With that said, you've gotta try the souffls here. They are perfect pillows of paradise in every bite. The chocolate was enticing but the vanilla grand marnier was irresistible! The ice sculpture berry sorbet dessert was inventive and incredibly refreshing, as well.

My friend received a birthday selection of mignardises and the ladies were presented with truffles neatly presented in Cartier inspired jewelry boxes. 

Thankfully the night ended on a positive note but in all honesty, for a restaurant of this caliber, I expected far more consistency in service than the inattentive and sloppy half-baked excuse for service we got last night. If it weren't for some of the incredibly amazing dishes, I would have given this place one star for the poor service alone.

If I were you, check out Picasso in the same hotel. They offer beautiful views, delicious five star quality dining coupled with exceptional service.

Happy Eats!

When you combine the quality of ingredients, service and tremendous value, Soho is a place worth coming back to again and again.  Dinner for 4 came out to around $60 before tip and we got to try a nice variety of dishes.

It was easy to see and taste the high grade fish they used right off the bat in the "Seared Tuna Special" which included crispy shallots, sweet onion, micro greens and chili oil combined with super fresh nigiri cuts of maguro.  This was a terrific mix of flavors.  $11!  That's about 50% off the strip price.  I almost wished I didn't have to share it.  

I couldn't turn my back on the $3 (!!) Soho Tostadas and went with the tuna with Hawaiian poke sauce.  The tostada itself was made of taro and there were some delicious chunks of tuna on top mixed with cilantro and avocado cream.  Another great starter for sure.  The rock shrimp done tempura style was also nice portion for $7 and came with 3 unique sauces that I fail to remember the details of since my wife was seriously sweating the end of the Seahawks/Rams Monday night game due to some sports bets she had.  It was nice they had one TV up.

Hydro Bibb Black Cod for $5 was a total freakin tease that ensured I'll get a full order of miso marinated black cod the next time.  Even the smaller portioned cod were cooked really well and the combo of cool lettuce, crispy wontons and fish was kind of like a deluxe protein taco.  

Those all were excellent opening acts for what I was personally here for which was the short rib dish.  Ever since I saw that one picture of all those short ribs being grilled, I knew it was destiny!  It totally delivered.  The one rib was like something out the The Flintstones and tasted as good as it looked.  It was juicy and so tender that you could've just picked at it with chopsticks sans fork and knife.  

The chef and owner of Soho, John Chien Lee, stopped by our table to ask how things were and gave us a breakdown on the business.  We were still open to one more dish so I asked him for a recommendation.  He asked what we liked and we said salmon.  He asked if we wanted something cooked or raw and we said raw.  He said he'd make something special for us off the menu (YES!) and 10 minutes later brought over this delectable dish with 8 pieces of scallop wrapped with salmon topped with a little green, lemon and some other stuff I can't remember.  John whipped up this dish thinking it would be a great finish to the meal after the heaviness of the short rib and MAN was he right.  Then he told us it was on the house!  Thanks, John!!  I suck for not taking photos of anything.  

Las Vegas strip quality for locals!  Check it out.

Without Godzilla's review, I would totally not even known about this new restaurant called Koraku Ramen.  As I am not Japanese, not a subscriber to their phone tree or otherwise connected to the local Japanese social network scene.  So Hoodie, aka Godzilla X, thanks for bringing this new Japanese eatery to the attention of Yelp users.

Koraku Ramen, is a small chain restaurant from California (Little Tokyo and Sherman Oaks) that finally relocated their other Nevada location to Las Vegas.  So for those of you who have visited their other locations, you guys will probably be very familiar with their menu.  As for me, this is most likely the very first time I have ever been to one of their restaurants.  The LV branch is located in the same plaza as Krung Siam, Pho Little Saigon, Quiznos and Starbucks Coffee, on the SE corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View.  Currently there is no signage indicating the name (or it was not put out on my first visit on Tuesday around 6pm) and unless you happened to read a little Japanese and can kinda sorta maybe translate the little "We're Open" sign near their front door, it will be hard to guess what kind of food they might serve.

The restaurant interior is pretty simply decorated, with a giant poster of an classic Japanese movie hanging above what looks like the exterior seating area of a ramen-ya in Japan.  There are additional smaller, classic Japanese movie posters on the wall, but you will have to tilt your head back to see them. Which is cool, because I enjoy watching old Japanese movies, and it kind of reminded me of the decor of the ramen museum (Yokohama, Japan) I visited with a a group of friends a few years back.  

Seats in the booth are surprisingly comfortable, thanks to the cushy cushions for our tushies.  It is the next best thing for our arse, than a pricier Derriere Facial.  Such thoughtfulness is very much appreciated.

The menu features entrees served with rice (such as various curries, katsu, sweet & sour pork meatballs), fried rice and noodles, and 1/3 of the menu dedicated to their diverse line up of ramen.  

Here are my impressions of the food I tried on my two visits (dinner and lunch):

Shoyu Ramen:  Broth was mild but flavorful, not overly salty compared to most local ramen restaurants.  Chasu is nice, but could be even more tender and flavorful. Suggested add-ons:  Wakame, 3 slices of Chasu, and Ajitsuke Tamago (Japanese flavored soft boiled egg).  (3.5/5)

Pork Fried Rice:  Simply prepared. Tasty.  (3.5/5)

Gyoza:  Nothing extraordinary, but prepared well.  Has nice crispy base, and is a good appetizer.  Server recommended that we eat it with the spicy oil (Ra-Yu). (3.5/5)

Beef Curry on Rice:  Decent.  (3/5)

Spicy House Special Ramen (mild):  Pretty good portion. A lot of ingredients, even without any add-ons.  Leosdianto L. commented that it kind of reminded him of ramen we make at home, and I agree.  (3.5/5)

Nikudango (Sweet & Sour Pork Meatballs):  The sauce seems to be on the salty side, but I didn't try this with rice.  Reminded me of meatballs on a skewer, without the pineapple and the stick.  (3/5)

Service (early dinner): We were the only there, so service was excellent.  The evening crew seems to be staff by mostly Japanese mothers.  They were very friendly, attentive, and food came out of the kitchen fairly quickly. (4.5/5)

Service during the lunch rush (customers were overwhelmingly Japanese ex-pats, including local business owners and social gathering of house wives. When I closed my eyesand listen to their conversation, which I can't understand at all, it almost felt like I am in Japan without the cost of flight and hours on the plane) was friendly and attentive, but took the kitchen noticeably longer to serve up two bowls of ramen. (2.5/5)

Obviously the restaurant is very new, so it is super clean, and I expect that it will be maintained that way.

Parking. Not all that much (maybe 85) parking spaces in this tiny strip mall when it gets really busy. And there are no street parking in the immediate surrounding, being on the corner of two high traffic streets.  Big city dwellers will be used to that, for the rest be patient or walk a block or two.  (3/5)

Final thoughts. Koraku, once it has been opened for awhile and worked out most of the new restaurant kinks, it will be a respectable competition to other local Japanese restaurants that primarily serve ramen and curry.  Ramen combo deals (ramen + 1/2 order of fried rice or curry rice) is a good value for the Hungry-Man (R) and Hungry-Woman (patent registration pending).

P.S. It was great running into Mike C. and James I on my first visit.  Thanks for inviting me to join your party.  You guys are cool!

P.P.S.  Now accepting cash, credit and debit, gold and silver coins, and I.O.U.s from your pals.

3.5 stars.

WING LOVERS, YOUR SEARCH FOR DELICIOUS WINGS ARE OVER!

Just like you I was reading the reviews, (mainly Tawni and Tien's), I was compelled to check this place out.

So as I park and get out of my car, I see a big sign that says this place is an internet cafe. Huh? Am I at the wrong place? Then I remembered from the reviews that the whole place is a food court. 

I walk up to the Wing King counter and Brian, the owner, was still getting ready. He sees me and politely asks if he can help me. I said excitedly "WINGS, IM HERE FOR THE WINGS!" So he takes my order and I sit down with my mouth watering to wait for my first bite. 

So while im waiting, I tell Brian Yelp is what brought me here. Never mind the fact that I dont mind going to new places to try out wings, if it wasnt for Yelp, you would not be reading this review.

Ok so for the wings. There are 40 flavors. Yes. 40. I had garlic parmesan and garlic hot. Ok, so I love garlic. Dont judge me! Especially if you are a vampire! The wings were a little bit bigger than your average size. Brian asked if I liked it extra crispy. Hell yes I do! So after I devoured my wings, things like hole in the wall and a 5 star review was already embedded in my head. From my last conversation with Brian, he is already coming up with even more sauces like mango slam and honey mustard slam. This guy works his butt off to keep you coming back and I for one am one of them!

I also ordered garlic parmesan fries and fried pickles. YES, I SAID FRIED PICKLES! Both were off the hook and Brian also let me sample some sweet chili glazed fries. OMG it was some of the best fries I have had in a long time. Please refer to the amazing pics on here and your mouth will be watering. I guarantee it!

As I was finishing up, Brian just happen to serve me a peach cobbler fresh out of the oven as a token of appreciation. DAMN! If I knew he was gonna do that, I wouldnt of ate so many wings! I could only finish half of it. 

Speaking of the peach cobbler, man this guy has some great desserts as well. I have tried the red velvet cake and the cookies. A special mention goes out to his rum cake as well. This is not a usual and its not on the menu but he made it for a customer one time so he decided to make two. One for the customer and one for whoever was lucky enough that day to be there when he put it out. Yes, I was there and boy oh boy it was awesome! If I ate any more I would need a cab to get home! Im sure he can specially make it for you if you let him know ahead of time so he can do his magic. That is the advantage of baking your own desserts! You can taste the freshness for sure! Oh, before I forget, Brian tells me he is in the process of bringing in Bluebelle Ice Cream. For those that dont know, that's only something that you only see on the east coast. So that alone should warrant a trip here.

If you are wondering, yes there is a really, really spicy hot wing challenge. The flavor is called Hell. No explanation necessary here. All I know is that I need to bring my friends that think they can pass this challenge here soon. Im also hoping we can make a Yelp event out of this. (Hi Misti! LOL)

So now after reading this you should be compelled to check this place out just like me. For complete info on their 40 flavors and other items, go to their website: www.wingkinglv.com

A few weeks ago I was watching an episode of Diners, Drive-ins & Dives and they're doing a feature on this restaurant.   Knowing I would be heading to Phoenix soon AND I don't have German food very often, I bookmarked it, then ask my friends if they want to have dinner here.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=xeRpdNyGlTwF4SNYZ3588A#XdSMeOjMFXkDYkLe9CmVSg

Fast forward to Friday afternoon.  I call and ask if they take reservations, they said yes, so I made one.   We arrived about 15 minutes early and the place is packed!   Come reservation time, they didn't have a table ready and asked us to wait in a "waiting area".   It's a small group of tables at the back of the bier garten.  I figured I might as well have a bier, right?  So I ordered a hefeweizen.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=fGrf2cHDXfDKshCS8vDofA#fGrf2cHDXfDKshCS8vDofA

After about 15 minutes they had a table ready in the "bier garten".   Yes it was cool outside but they had tons and I mean TONS of heaters!   There were three heaters around our table in very close proximity and another heater near the next table about 2 feet away.  We sat down and while my friends enjoyed the heat, I started baking immediately.

SERVICE: All of the staff were very nice!   Our server Jeremy seemed to have very little personality and only smiled once when I made a joke.    However he did do a very good job taking care of us.   I ended up speaking with Rose, the owner.    What a sweet and fun lady!   We chatted about the restaurant and her experience with Guy Fieri and the production staff for the show.   She said they filmed that segment about 6 years ago.

Rose also told me they've been in business for 18 years and at this location for the last eight years.  Her restaurant can seat 300, she has a staff of 22 working the front of house and 12 in the small kitchen.

As we were dining two gentleman came out and started serenading the bier garten with an accordion and a tuba!   Hmm, does two make an "Oom-pah-pah band"?   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#Xg7Kg3cwQvevC0BJMIuXbA
They starting with "roll out the barrel" of course, and continued with a number of other bier drinking songs and Christmas songs for a good 30 minutes.   For me anyway, it made the whole evening that much more fun!

FOOD:  We started with a giant pretzel!   It was warm, soft and very tasty!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#2s8FvkPpB0J_OGZSxDiYHA  (notice my phone for a size reference)   I really wanted to try 5 different entrees, but could only have one, so Paprika Schnitzel it is!    The entrees come with a cup of soup, which was a "lemon martini" on Friday.   It was quite tasty, but I didn't really get lemon or martini.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#lYe5isj_vkLSPwbdJHF8qQ  The schnitzel is pork loin pounded flat, breaded and pan fried golden brown and is topped with an onion and bacon infused paprika sauce.   it also comes with German fried potatoes (with garlic and caraway) and wirsing (shredded cooked cabbage and onion in a creamy cheese sauce) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#L0eXT4gWympRVAeAB-1_PA   The pork was very tender and tasty.  The paprika sauce was WONDERFUL but also very subtle and nearly "disappeared" on the schnitzel.   I LOVED the wirsing!   The potatoes were very good too!   One friend ordered the Hackbraten, which is a beef and pork meatloaf with roasted onion gravy, spatzle and red cabbage.   I was able to taste the meatloaf and it was fantastic!

DESSERT: We couldn't leave without dessert, so we ordered and shared the Apple Strudel (Very good), Cherry Strudel (to die for!) and the "sauerkraut cake" (A chocoholics dream!).

We've been eating at LOS for years and have been there so many times that luckily we've managed to order most of the menu. However we have 2 different ways we order when visiting LOS. The first way is just me and my hubs on a casual weeknight, we tend to order the few dishes that we haven't tried yet . The other is a weekend night with several guests along for a Thai feast. So this review will focus on the later, a sort of best of LOS if you will.

On a side note you do not come here to order Pad Thai and the other super popular Thai dishes. LOS is famous for Northern style and Chef Chutima specialties, stick to those and you will not be disappointed. Also, LOS has 4 condiments but be sure to ask for all 4.. chili paste, chili powder, pickled jalapeo will be brought out in a caddy but the 4th is separate.. its thai chili in fish sauce and lime juice, you'll have to ask for this one. When they bring it lift the lid of carefully and inhale the fragrance. This to me is the LOS perfume and let me tell you this condiment is scorchingly hot. Its burns both ways but it tastes truly amazing! 

Apps..

#12 Stuffed Chicken Wings.. while these can be found elsewhere, the preparation here is a deep fried crunchy version that's amazing with pickled jalapeo and sticky rice. 

#13 A. Nua Dad Deaw which is Issan style beef jerky. Seriously, it's jerky so think deeply flavored slices of chewy meat. Its fun to eat especially with sticky rice and some of the accompanied sauce. 

#14 Nam Kao Tod.. this is like the premier LOS appetizer, if you can order only one app, make it this one. We call this one simply crispy rice with sour sausage. However its the little pieces of sausage arent sour but have a porky lime flavor thats addictive paired with fresh ginger, green onions, chili, peanuts and of course this is all nestled into a pile of light crispy rice. Served with cucumber chips this tastes great using the chili fish sauce condiment. BTW, if you prefer the sausage whole order #66.

Salads..

#45 Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad.. little deep friend pieces of cat fish with slices of apple and peanuts then dressed with lime juice.. Its bright, crispy and one of my favorites here. 

#59 Koi Soy.. okay so technically this isn't a salad but the coolness of this dish sits perfectly in the salad space for me. So what is it you ask? It's Issan style beef tartare. Yep raw beef and its a gorgeous dish with minced beef dressed with chili, rice powder and lime. We've ordered this at a spice level 4 and let me say that our faces felt like they were going to burn off. Order at a 1 spice level and add your own heat via condiments. Trust me on this.

Entrees..

A. Khao Soi.. typical street food noodle dish but the version here is crazy good. We always order beef with this but if you're feeling like a high roller get the beef short rib version (you'll pay more but its marginally more tender). Its simple, toothsome egg noodles afloat in a curried coconut bream broth garnished with red onion, lime and pickled cabbage. Its rich, thick and a must order. 

K. Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry).. this is one of those dishes that has a far reaching flavor profile. To me this curry could easily be on a table in India.. its dark deep pork richness is fork tender and perfect over steamed rice. However many prefer to eat this one with sticky rice. 

Drunken Noodles.. we order this a couple of different ways depending on what the table wants.. most popular way is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Sea Bass with extra noodle. The sea bass is lightly dusted and deep fried until its light and crispy. Inside the meat is light, flakey and a great contrast to the rich smokey noodles. The other preparation for us is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Duck. Same as above but with slices of deep fried duck breast (no bones in either). The duck is rich, slightly fatty and bursting with flavor. For me the duck is my favorite preparation but I also like heavier meat flavors. 

Garlic Prawns.. so for the longest time we never ordered this dish as we thought it was just a Chinese style dish, boy were we wrong. This is where Chef Chutima works her Thai culinary magic. She takes large shell on shrimp and cooks them in such a way that the meat is tender and juicy while the shell is as light and crispy as a potato chip. Yes, you eat the shell, legs and all. This is truly a magical dish for us. 

Dessert.. 

We're usually so full right about now that desserts of sticky rice and mango seems just to heavy for us. Though look up my review for Luv-It Frozen Custard for a tongue cooling treat (its close to LOS).

At some point in the future I will write a companion review to this review for those who want to explore other dishes but have been overwhelmed with the scale of the menu. Oh and in case you're wondering the amount of dishes we ordered above are good for about 4-6 people. Though we're really big eaters so a party of 4 is more like it for us. 

Bon appetite!

I finally tried out JFF! The parking lot was packed when we arrived, so I worried we might have to wait long for a table. Nope! Just a couple minute wait and we were on our way. Soon chips, salsa and bean dip were at our table. They also brought a side of grilled veggies! The salsa was alright, but could have been thicker for my preference. The bean dip was very good as were the chips. Our server mentioned they have excellent guacamole made table-side. The guac sounded good and I would be the only one trying it so, I asked for the small side priced at $3.95 on the menu. The small side of guacamole was not made table-side so I didn't get to choose any of the ingredients that went into the guac. It was just brought to the table already prepared. I didn't like it at all. it was just bland mashed avocados with way to many tomatoes in it. I would have liked some onion, jalapeno, salt and maybe even some lime, but I wasn't offered any. The kicker for me was when my food arrived and there was about the same amount of the same exact bland guacamole on my plate that I paid extra for prior. Had I known, I wouldn't have ordered the other, but the server also said it would be made table-side and to my customization.

My friend and I ordered "Combo Fajitas For Two" priced at $25.95 with beef and pork. This comes with a cup of "Fideo Soup" that is out of this world yummy. The soup really packed some delicious flavor. One thing that impressed me here is that a lot of the time when you order fajitas somewhere it usually is just meat and tortillas, but they actually gave a small side of sour cream, bland guacamole, pico de gallo and you can choose flour or corn tortillas. The meal also came with rice and beans that were very good. The fajitas were so-so for me. The meat is thicker than I am used to and was a bit tough and the bell peppers were still to raw and not cooked enough. My hubby ordered his own combo plate that had Chile Relleno and a Cheese Enchilada and thought it was good, but nothing to write home about. There were major hits and misses with the whole meal. Our server was very friendly and checked on us often. It was worth at least giving it a try! Will I come back? Not anytime soon, but I can see giving JFF another shot at some point maybe with a coupon.

OFFENSIVE. Tonight I had the most offensive and unprofessional experience at Yasu; I will never ever go back and I would only recommend it to someone I hate.

A group of four of us arrived at Yasu for our 6:30PM reservation and were seated promptly. We chatted for a while as water and other beverages were brought out and we went ahead and ordered the chef's choice menu so we could see the best of the best that Yasu had to offer. I've had great experiences with chef's choice at Yen, Pure, and a number of places in Boston so I expected the same from Yasu.

We entertain ourselves for a while until the first course arrives. 8 kumamoto oysters with uni and roe. Great play of textures and flavors. Kudos. Plates are removed and now we are getting excited, sashimi must be coming next and we are ready for it! The special fish selections of the day looked fantastic.

About 20 minutes goes by and we get our second course, red snapper carpaccio. it is seared and served at room temperature. One of my pieces had i don't know, tendon or something that made it unyielding to my chopsticks, and frankly, the temp of this dish was iffy. Flavors decent, but this is not the mass quantity of sashimi or nigiri I was anticipating.

The restaurant starts filling up. I see a massive plate of rolls come out of the kitchen and I nearly squeal with glee...until I watch it come to rest at another table.  This starts happening at a regular pace, and then I realize it's been a full 30 minutes since we've had anything at our table. A server comes by so I ask when the next dish will arrive. She mumbles something about the chef's choice taking a little longer than other orders and walks away.

Another cooked plate. A gross mushroom custard, a single shrimp on a skewer, an 1/8th of a cup of japanese eggplant in red miso sauce, a shard of spanish mackerel with some sort of puree, and two bits of jumbo clam. Everything tastes fine, but we are OVER the cooked plate situation.

Yet ANOTHER 30 minutes goes by. No server, nor manager comes to apologize for the delay. We watch literally dozens of delicious looking rolls, nigiri and sashimi fly out of the kitchen to other tables. We also watch 4 other couples come in after us, eat loads of food, and leave before us. We are still hungry.

Next course...Clams in miso broth. We are not offered spoons for the broth. We look at each other, thinking, "we ARE at a sushi restaurant, are we not?" but go ahead and eat the clams.  When the server comes by and asks how it is we tell her that we hope the next course will begin the actual SUSHI part of this dinner. She says yes, we are having live scallops.

About 25 more minutes pass and I'm starting to vibrate with righteous indignation. We are clearly paying a fucking fortune for this meal and we are receiving terrible treatment. The "live scallops" are boiling in miso broth over a mini-charcoal grill. They are so over-cooked they are RUBBERY. We hurry to get them off the coals and into our mouths before they are completely ruined.

Finally we tell the server that we are going to have to INSIST on getting some raw fish on the table. She says that's what's coming next. "Next" meaning ANOTHER 30 minutes later. We wait so long that finally we tell the server we are NOT going to continue with this absurdity and that we want the check. "oh your next course is ready!" "we don't want it. We want to leave" These are the exact words out of our mouths. Instead of bringing the check she brings the plates, telling us that Chef Yasu "wants us to have them." We all resist and the plates are set down anyway and finally our hunger makes us cave and we eat. We have now been at Yasu for TWO AND A HALF HOURS. We've had five courses that were not enough for two people, much less four.

Another 15 minutes pass before the check arrives. In that time, the manager has come out, not to rectify the situation, or apologize, but to call us ignorant and classless. He literally looks at us and accuses, "Have you ever had omakase before? It is always slower." We look at him and tell him in all of our sushi eating years we have never had an experience akin to this. We also point out that we were expecting SUSHI, as in RAW FISH. He tells us we told the server we would eat 'anything'. I asked him if the name of his restaurant was Yen SUSHI Bistro and he looks at me, puzzled. Then I see that we have been charged $20 for the last course that we TWICE tried to send back. I speak to the manager who tells me "if Yasu wants to charge you for it, he will charge you for it." I kid you not. All in all each course was mercilessly over-worked, only average and Yasu is on a major ego trip. Don't waste your time and money here.

As i rubbed my overstuffed belly, dude said it's ok if i want to unbutton. I told him i unbuttoned already about 30 min ago!

Wowee, i think i consumed more food here that i did at the buffets. 
I brought my relatives here to treat them to a nice steak dinner, without breaking the bank. 
For restaurant week, they were doing a great deal (which is pretty much half of their power couple meal). For $50, you get a 3 course meal. Most of our table ordered that, while my dude and uncle just got their manly bone in Rib Eyes. The deal came with a Petit Filet and crabcake, along with salad and dessert. But ur allowed to tweak your meal and don't necessarily have to stick with the written options- a few items, u have to pay extra for. 
You start off with huge sesame seed bread served with butter. Not the best bread steak house bread i've had, but it was soft and yummy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=0BlIFseV-5Hd16I-PcRrXQ 

My Del's salad was awesome!. Mainly cuz it came with two huge pieces of delicious thick but crisp bacon on top!!! I got mine with an avocado dressing which was so good! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=Gl37AEprIq227kFoigLohw

The petit Filet was pretty filling and cooked nicely med rare.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=fNMin5UVASwyyFBm_eMUlg
The bone in Rib Eye was good as well, dude loved it as he's had it before. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=HyA9h7GFL35u0YrUgi3uvg  It was good, but i felt it lacked that buttery char that i love on my rib eye. Mastros i say still does a better Bone In Rib eye. 

For sides, the staff comes around and spoons out the sides you ordered, which come in large portions that u could share them. 
I tried the spinach (creamy with bacon!), and mushrooms were ok. 
The baked potato looked good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=_fxRw3wX86gejNGyy2rAWg

The crabcakes were pretty good. 
My uncle got the Salmon and said that the Tchoupitoulas sauce it came with was delicious and light. 
My aunt got the seared tuna steak- which was good but not great. She enjoyed the crab cake more. 

We all let out some gasps when we saw the humongous desserts!
We were too stuffed but couldn't resist the yummy looking desserts. 
The bread pudding was the best-  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=J4y4JWu2Kzjwv4Q_Ein0cQ
Strawberry cheesecake was huge and very cream cheesy than sweet 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=NiuW7t29bUx5BSZYH-8DKw
Chocolate mousse was delicious. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=PU3xnSpdx9YjuOQpNiNikQ
One dessert, i think is big enough to share between 3 people, esp after having a huge dinner already. 

Service was outstanding. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and took his time explaining everything and made us all feel very comfortable. We saw atleast 10 different wait staff come to our table, either refilling our drinks (even after one sip!) or bringing out our dishes. 

I signed up for their rewards card which racks you up points for dollars spent for gift cards. They charge u an initial fee of $25.00 which they reinburse you in the form of a giftcard for later. You can also sign up online before going there, so you can use it on your first visit. Be sure to let them know of any b-days, as u will get a comped dessert!

After how many failed attempts, I've finally crossed Bacchanal off my "to try" list in Vegas. This time around was sweeter. A self check-in kiosk met us as we tried getting in line which asked for a name and a cellphone number for them to reach us when it's time to pay and get seated. 30 minutes of trying our luck with the slot machines and my phone beeped saying it was time. 

Time to get our glutton on, that's what!

I always scope out the different stations categorized by cuisines before getting anything. I've finally learned to skip the bacon and other breakfast items I can eat at home so I started with some dim sum, roasted duck, and hot and sour soup. Can I say that was the best SIUMAI I've had just yet? It's remarkably tasty and perfect in texture from all aspects. Try it and thank me later! Meanwhile, the duck was great but the hot and sour soup could use less salt.

There's a long line for the seafood station so I went for the carving station for a nice slab of PRIME RIB (yuummmm!) and got me some of the best SCALLOPED POTATOES with MUSHROOMS from another part of the buffet. Wow! I got two pans of these buttery and flavorful carbs. Soooooo gooooood! I was told the LAMB CHOPS would be dished out around 3pm but by then I was already too full. Something to try next time, that's for sure. 

Offering a selection of soups, I had their tomato basil soup, very delish, and their mushroom with truffle soup, very salty! Next to it is their bread station and take heed when I say get their mini CORN BREAD muffins. Mmmhmmm!

I finally lined up for the seafood station to start burning what I ate. Mussels, clams, salmon, and seafood paella were the hot ones that I partook. I forgot to return for the shrimp and grits but those looked good. Cajun crawfish was also some of the offerings I decided to skip on due to the eating logistics of that crustacean. However, I certainly could not pass up on the oyster shooters, cocktail shrimps, KING CRAB LEGS, and their fresh succulent oysters. I recommend everything I tried in this station, however, I thought the paella was just alright and was on the salty side.

Ending this gluttonous meal on a sweet note, I will have to say that among all the beautiful looking pastries and sweets I've tried, what's really worth indulging in are their CREPES! They have a station where they make it fresh for you with your own choosing of toppings such as sugar, syrup, and fruits. The texture and flavor is spot on. It's so good I could easily eat it by itself! Or, you can pair with it any gelato of your liking with so many flavors to choose from, if it rocks your boat. 

If there's anything that didn't impress me other than a few over-seasoned items, it would sadly have to be the service rendered to us by our server. She was an older lady who was somehow kind and very accommodating to all the tables around us, but us. She seemed cold, always rushing without stopping to hear what we're requesting. When she was leaving, she said, "My shift is done, I want to go home now! You want anything else?" And it wasn't in a friendly way. She moved on to the next table and got all friendly to them endorsing the server who was to take care of them when she leaves. And this is why you should tip only after you've been served.   

Bottomline, we were all happy with what we consumed despite the price tag it came with ($50 for weekend champagne brunch). Because we got seated around 2pm, we were able to enjoy some dishes that were served only for dinner such as the fresh oysters. Either way, I guarantee you will leave this place satiated not just with the quantity of food you'll get but with a quality worth noting.

First of all, many thanks to the awesome Deb L. and her fun-loving hubby Michael, for hosting tonight's UYE at this elegant restaurant!  (It's definitely "date night" material-- and not only for romantic couples; I spotted a father and daughter, dressed to the nines, and they looked like they were having a great time!)  Nine of us were in attendance, and I'd say that the dinner was a huge success!  This was my first visit, and while I had to leave shortly after the food came out, I felt sad leaving this very lively group-- it was great to have caught up w/ Deb, Mike, and Heather C., and so nice to have made new acquaintances!  I hadn't even left the building yet, and I already knew I was coming back!  (Heather, we're definitely doing breakfast SOON!)

While waiting for other Yelpers to arrive, I'd inquired about whether HB only served wines, since that was the only drink menu that was presented to us, but no, our friendly and very helpful server Chelsea said that HB had a full bar, and that she would return to let us know what specialty cocktails they had to serve that evening.  Besides their house red sangria ($9?), HB was also offering a Blackberry mojito ($9) and a St. Germain elderflower margarita ($11).  While both sounded delicious, I decided to go w/ the mojito since I have a large bottle of the elderflower liquor ($32!) sitting in my fridge back home (I was inspired to buy after having some elderflower champagne flutes at Chandler's Cork!)  Oh. My. God!  If you like berries, you MUST try this mojito!  It was so full of muddled whole blackberries, you'd think it was puree, and it wasn't overly sweet-- I felt like I was having quite a nutritious beverage!  I hardly tasted the alcohol...  I very much wanted to order another one, but I knew I had to leave early.  I cannot wait to come back for happy hour!  :D

By the time everyone showed up and had a chance to make introductions and make really interesting chit-chat (again, Deb and Mike were great hosts!), we were ready to order and eat!  I kid you not, everyone's selections looked amazing!  I'm sure we'll be reading about their selections soon enough, so let me tell you about mine...

I was curious about the gouda mac 'n cheese from the very moment I read about it on Deb's prior review, so I knew to order these.  How fortunate to see that the Thai BBQ baby back ribs came w/ a side of it, as well as a green apple slaw.  I concede that the mac 'n cheese was good, but I think it would've been better w/ more cheese and slightly more crunchy breadcrumbs.  The sour apple slaw provided a nice crunch and just enough sweet-sour to counteract the spiciness of the baby back ribs.  Ohhh... those tender ribs!  The BBQ sauce was thick, sticky, sweet, yet had a great kick!  (I didn't find it too spicy, but others might... you've been warned!)  It was very fortunate for Mom that I had to leave the party so soon, or else she would not have had the chance to try the leftovers; there wouldn't have been any to take home!  (And yes, she's already eaten the rest of the meal!)

Afterwards, I stopped at the adjoining market to take home a slice of Chocolate-peanut butter banana bread cake ($5), a Strawberry-blackberry handpie ($5), and a goat cheese-chive potato cake ($3).  (So many of the others had a potato cake as a side to their entree, and I was so envious-- they looked great on the plates, and everyone said they were delicious, and I completely agree w/ them!)  Loved the potato cake's great textures- the caramelized outer crust had enough crunch, but quickly yielded to reveal the buttery potato delight, w/ goat cheese crumbles all-throughout inside-- not at all greasy, and I loved the rich and creamy consistency that the goat cheese gave to the potato cake!  I will have to buy some of these to take home on every visit from now on!  FYI, the desserts were perfect, as well!  The crust on the handpie tasted almost like shortbread, the sugared top of the crust was exquisitely crisped, and the fresh berry filling also incorporated a citrus-y element-- my guess is orange peel/bergarmot oil essence.  The banana bread cake was so moist, had beautiful texture (see pics),  not too sweet, and packed full of banana goodness... Loved the peanut butter layer under the chocolate ganache "icing" (no powdered sugar used in their icings here!).  The cake also had peanut butter drizzle all over the top.  It's a pretty cake, and I wouldn't hesitate to order a whole one to-go...  

Hey, Heather-- you free this weekend??

Let me first start this review by saying the following: Even though I'm a CenPho fan, I have spent many evenings in North Scottsdale establishments including Barcelona, Ocean Club, and Devil's Martini North with and without bottle service and reserved tables. So don't think this is a harsh review due to their location. 

I was at Narcisse last night with a group of 6 at a reserved booth. Things went smoothly enough in seating us. I was immediately impressed by the decor of the place and excited to try their menu. My friend and I pored over the extensive bubbly list and the food menu quickly. My friend suggested that we get the chef's choice meats, cheeses platter. After a few questions, we went ahead with the platter and a bottle of sparkling rose'. Everything was great! The platter was large enough for everyone at the table to try something. 

As the food part of the evening was wrapping up for our group, we decided to mix and mingle. The crowd made for some great people watching! I was enjoying the show! The music was good and upbeat and created a great vibe. My tootsies were hurting a bit so we decided to head back to the booth to chill for a bit. This is when it gets silly. 

I was sitting in the booth with 3 other people and we were watching a bouncer and I assume a manager trying to arrange and rearrange a table and chairs right in front of our booth. I sat back in amusement at first as the Benny Hill theme song played in my head. I was thinking to myself "This table is blocking booth traffic." Well, the two employees decided to move the table a little further away from the booths and into the traffic that walks into the establishment; a very high traffic area. I shook my head and thought the show was over. No. A hostess with a clipboard comes over and says "Hi guys. I have had these booths reserved for, like, two weeks in advance and need to move you to that table. I'll give you a bottle of champagne for your inconvenience." I didn't object. I didn't say anything. I just got up and moved. Well, our booth was a booth for 6, the table was a booth for 4. So as we were trying to arrange for more chairs, if possible, I watched a server run into our makeshift table setting, look annoyed, then climb OVER two of the empty chairs at our table. Then I see another patron walk into the establishment, and slam right into one of the other chairs on the other side of the table. A bouncer comes over to tell us that we can't move tables before being told by another bouncer that we were ok. This table IS NOT supposed to be here. I felt like we were in the way and we were. On top of that, I'm watching as another makeshift "reserved" table is being arranged in the already cramped area. I had enough. I told my friend that I wanted to leave and started saying my goodbyes. 

My friend had been a bar manager for a large establishment for many years, so he went to speak to the Manager to inform him of the tomfoolery with the tables. I walked up in the middle of the conversation and the Manager was asking us to stay and was apologizing profusely. I told him I respected the business and understood that things were crazy, but booting people out of a booth and putting them at a table that blocked the flow of traffic was hazardous and not professional at all. I also explained that we were paying customers that had bought approx 5 bottles of champagne and food, so we weren't schlumps. The Manager thanked me for my understanding and wanted to let me know that "after 10 or so, the place becomes more of a nightclub, so tables are tough and we're trying to accommodate everyone who wants a reserved table". Ok then they should pull all the tables then and not call themselves a Lounge. Or they should LIMIT the number of tables they reserve. He again asked us to stay and he'd get more chairs over and buy us a drink. I told him that the chairs weren't necessary (where the heck were they going to put them??) and that we would stay for the drink. He insisted on trying to move more chairs over, which caused more of a jam. We insisted that the chairs weren't needed and he took them away. Our drinks? Ordered but never delivered after 35 minutes. I just stood by observing and saw another server run into a chair at our table and pick it up and move it to another part of the place. I just laughed and told my friend we were outta there. 

At what point is it a good business decision to sacrifice quality for quantity? Do you try to accommodate everyone who wants a table or limit the number and keep the service integrity high? Do you accommodate paying customers who are willing to continue drinking and eating or bump them for a table who bought one bottle of alcohol? 

I think Narcisse has potential. It's not quite there yet. I guess I just expect more out of a bubble lounge. All the pieces are there! Maybe I will go back after they work out the kinks.

This is the second time a club in a Wynn property has embarrassed me in front of friends/colleagues. 

Let me preface this review by saying that I know Labor Day Weekend in Las Vegas is nuts. I've been partying in Vegas for the better part of five years now; it's the second most expensive/busy weekend of the year or something to that effect.

That said, I booked a cabana here fully prepared to spend a lot of money. And I am the EASIEST person to help. No wacky requests, nothing. Just take my money and give me what I'm told I'm getting. I showed up with a bunch of my friends and we had a minimum spend of $2k (which is realistically more like $3k), which I thought was totally reasonable for the cabana that particular night. It was no problem, but the holier than thou attitude that I got from some of the staff was extremely off-putting. Yes, I know you're busy. Yes, I know you're stressed. But if I'm buying bottles and bottles at a 1000% markup... be a little nicer. Smile. Take five minutes to make sure we're all set. Don't ignore me when I need help. You're supposed to be bending over backwards for me, you're a VIP host. Customer service goes a long way. I'm not going to name any names in my review, but I am going to be honest.

So we waited in line for about 10 minutes before getting in. Totally standard, no problem. But, when we got in, the cabana I was promised was mysteriously unavailable. Instead, I was offered a daybed. I politely refused and asked to speak with a manager. This was embarrassing, since I was entertaining friends from out of town, and had kind of been hyping up the night since Surrender is the hot spot.

The manager came by, and I ended up having to kick him $200 to "upgrade" me to what I was promised originally. This is after I had already tipped out over $400 to the hosts and door staff. It's not like I didn't take care of my people; this wasn't my first rodeo. Tangentially, I know I'm breaking all the rules by mentioning that I tipped out, but fuck it. I'm pissed. I had been pre-authed the night before for the cabana, I had confirmed it twice, and then I got bait-and-switched. Not happy, Surrender. If you wanted to sell the cabana for a higher price to someone else, fucking tell me before I show up with a group, and don't you dare try to pull a bait and switch.

Anyway, we finally get up to the cabana and got our drinks a full hour after we arrived at the door. The host I had booked the table through passed me off to someone else, and (thankfully) he was fantastic, friendly, thorough. Our waitress was sort of around, our bussers friendly, our security fine. No above and beyond; if anything, the service was worse than I expected. The club itself was gorgeous and the night was beautiful, which is the only reason that this place isn't getting one star. Seriously, it was ridiculous. I'd give the club and the ambiance 5 stars, but the staff was less than stellar that night. In a city of hospitality, I was not impressed.

MIdway through the night, I had two friends get in touch with me to join the party. No problem, right? Wrong. My hosts told them my party was full, they had to wait in line, pay a $75 cover. It's a little absurd, considering we were going to purchase two more bottles when they came in, and they were just given a flat out no when they asked to join our party. I stepped outside to speak with a host - I wasn't even drunk - and I was given the cold shoulder. I produced another $100, he palmed it,  still didn't help my friends. Laughing.

All I have to say is, if Surrender treats the people who spend a ton of money this way, I can't even imagine coming here without table reservations. I learned an expensive lesson at the Encore, and this isn't the first time the Wynn staff has treated me like a second class citizen (see my XS review). Is my money different or something?

Overall, less than pleased. I will say this, though; if I ever return, I'd be more apt to return during the day than the night, and it'll be on someone else's dime so I don't have to deal with anybody.

After doing some shopping, hubby and I decided on coming here to Jayde Fuzion for dinner. We didn't leave hungry! We were greeted with a warm welcome and our server was fast as we sat at the table to get our drink order. The service was excellent here. Our drinks never went empty and our server answered all of our questions.

The menu is very simple without having a ton of items on it, but it was still hard to decide was to order since it all looked so good. The prices are also very reasonable. We decided to get different items from the menu and just share it. 

Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($8) - These were pretty good. I personally prefer a crunchier lettuce, but it was good. The menu said this dish was spicy however there wasn't any kick to the dish all. The chicken still had good flavor and it is worth the price. It came with 3 lettuce cups and when I asked our server for more it was no problem.

Cashew Chicken ($15) - My favorite dish of them all! It was a great portion of chicken and put over white rice it was perfect. There were plenty of cashews and this is a dish I would probably order every time. 

Gochujang Pork ($15) - Apples are in this dish, but I didn't taste them. That's OK because whatever flavor it did give the pork, I loved! I will say that this was also supposed to be a spicy dish and there was again no kick at all. It's sort of frustrating when a dish says it will be spicy and it isn't, but it did have great flavor and I would eat it again. As with the other dishes it was a decent portion. 

Honey Walnut Shrimp ($18) - I don't eat seafood. I didn't try these! The menu says it was supposed to have a creamy mayo sauce, but hubby said the shrimp tasted more like a really sweet orange and wouldn't order them again. I thought they were presented well and nicely sized. 

Yuzu Doughnuts ($7) - These are yummy! The doughnuts are very light and not greasy at all. The doughnuts were filled with tasty yuzu glaze and more glaze with pistachios were on top. The refreshing citrus flavor and light texture of the doughnuts made for a nice dessert. 

They didn't open until 5 pm (when we happened to arrive) and people were already waiting to get in. You might want to call ahead and make a reservation. And come hungry! There is also a sushi bar.

**Disclaimer: This is probably going to be a 2 part review just like I did for my 400th with Ortolan... we need a higher character limit....**

FINALLY!!  Hubert Keller is one of my favorite chefs, so ever since I first heard about him a couple years ago, I told myself next time I was in either Las Vegas or San Francisco, I HAD to go to Fleur de Lys.

It happened to be restaurant week in Las Vegas so our group had come here getting that menu in mind.  However that didn't last very long.

Our reservation was for 8:30, but a table where they were planning on seating us was taking their sweet ol' time and we were forced to wait.  After about 10-15 minutes of waiting outside, the hostess finally came up to us and offered us to wait in their lounge and enjoy complimentary champagne in their LOWLY lit lounge to apologize for the longer wait.  Free champagne?  Yes please!  The hostess was also kind enough to keep us updated on the table, waiting maybe an additional 10 or so minutes.

The lighting in the dining room was a little better and was thinking I could get away taking pictures without using my external flash on my camera (I hate using flash in a fine dining restaurant as I feel its a little bit of a distraction and nuisance).  Our table was slightly tucked away off in the corner, making out meal semi private.  Within a New York minute, our server, Marcus, was at our side, giving us our menus.  So like I said, we had come having in mind that we were going to get the restaurant week menu for $50.  However, right when we opened the menu, right there staring us down was Chef Keller's "Elegance Menu", which was 4 courses (instead of 3 on the RW menu) for $89.  Yes, a little hard to justify an extra course for $39, but, while some were the same, had more and better choices.  Such "better" choices included veal and potato ravioli and filet mignon.  The RW menu did not have the ravioli or the filet.

I started with the ahi tuna tartare with shaved fennel salad, a ginger ponzu sauce, and fennel seed tuile.  The tuna was very fresh and the ponzu wasn't too overpowering or salty.

My next course I ordered the veal and Yukon gold potato ravioli with English peas, veal jus, pea shoots, and a sunchoke foam.  The ravioli were pretty good but I do have to say the veal jus was a little salty.  I still very much enjoyed this dish.

For my entree, I ordered the prime filet mignon, with a potato puree, baby spinach, wild mushrooms, salsify, and a red wine reduction.  Medium rare of course.  The meat was cooked perfectly, though slightly underseasoned. The vegetables were perfect and the potato puree was very buttery.  There was an option to add black truffles and foie gras to the filet for an additional $25, and while I didn't partake in that, 2 others did.  The size of the foie was as round as the filet and they put A LOT of truffles.  I'm not talking about like maybe 3 or maybe 5 slices of black truffles.  It was a PILE of truffles, I'm guessing at least a dozen slices.  That right there, at $75/oz, definitely worth the $25.  And while seeing that much foie and truffles made me sad I didn't get it, they both gave me some of theirs so it was like I had gotten it myself.  Oh man... the foie was just... I had to take a moment.  I also said I didn't want to eat or drink anything else after having the foie for fear of washing away the flavor.  It was ethereal.

As much as I wanted to savor the foie gras, our dessert courses came out.  With souffle on the menu, I knew at least 3 or 4 people in our party would order it, so instead of ordering one for myself, I decided I would just steal a couple of bites of theirs and order the other item: a banana chocolate lava cake, served with a shot of peanut butter milkshake and Baileys ice cream.  The lava cake was really good and had a pleasantly subtle banana flavor.  The peanut butter milkshake was good.  I honestly didn't really get the Baileys ice cream.  Personally to me it just seemed to be a little bit of a disconnect.  I mean, if the pastry chef would kindly explain why he chose Baileys ice cream, then I'd probably understand.  But until then, your guess is as good as mine.

I'll end here for now because of the 5000 character limit... remainder of review shall come tomorrow....

Wow. Just wow. I am amazed at how much Morton's has changed. I hadn't eaten at Morton's for years, so seeing it was apart of Restaurant Week 2013 it seemed like a good time to go back. Too bad we couldn't go back in time to when I remember Morton's being an excellent place to eat!. 

I made the reservation a few days before, but after arriving I don't think that reservation would have mattered because they were not busy at all and the bar was dead. They did have a menu board after you walk inside promoting Restaurant Week and the RW menu they were offering. After being seated in a comfy booth, a gentleman came over to take our drink order and inform us that he was glad we were seated away from the construction dust. Say what?!?! He said they were doing some remodeling and we got lucky seats. Gee thanks... Not! I wasn't prepared to start off the evening hearing about that and feel he should have kept it to himself. Some things you just don't relay back to the customers.

Our server, Jessie, was attentive checking on us often and never letting our drinks get half empty. Jessie went over the RW menu with us and answered any questions we had. A large "Onion Loaf" was brought to the table with some whipped butter. This is a big loaf! I thought it was good, but seriously it tasted like the onion bun on the beef n cheddar at Arby's. For the RW menu the price was $50.13 per person. For the first course I chose the "Chopped Salad" and I have to say this was the one thing I really enjoyed. The chunks of blue cheese were amazing! I loved having such good sized chunks of blue cheese throughout the salad. The extra fresh cracked pepper I requested was nice too. For the 2nd course, I chose the 8oz filet well-done. Yep, I ordered a steak well-done! Get over it, it's MY steak! The filet is a thicker cut of meat, so when cooked properly it can still melt in your mouth even well-done! This was the first time in my entire life that I have ordered a well-done filet that didn't need to be butterflied. The steak lacked flavor and certainly didn't melt in my mouth. Even the crispy parts lacked flavor! I don't know if Morton's is being cheap with the RW menu, or if they really have gone downhill, but this steak isn't anything close to what I have had here in the past. 

You can clearly see by the RW pictures posted and other pictures posted that Morton's slims down the portion size on some dishes when you order from RW menu. Tsk Tsk! The sides hubby and I chose (came with the 2nd course) were the "Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes" and "Lyonnaise Potatoes" since we weren't fond of the other options. The mashed potatoes were creamy yet had soft chunks of potato in it too. I thought the mashed potatoes were actually decent. The lyonnaise potatoes on the other hand were terrible. The pictures of previous yelpers lyonnaise potatoes looks different from what we got. First off the onions were chewy and nasty. Eating the onions was like chewing on grass. Gross! The potatoes were straight up french fries! This dish was a fail.

So it came time for dessert and I knew I wanted the "Key Lime Pie" I just didn't know it would also be a fail. Key lime pie is one of my favorites (had the worst before this occasion in Florida believe it or not!) and I didn't think Morton's would be the worst ever key lime pie I have eaten. As it was placed in front of me, I could smell some fresh lime and grew excited. Pffft the only thing "lime" about this pie was the few lime zests they scattered on top. That was the smell, just some lime zest. This pie had no tartness at all! It was just bland and like eating nothing. I did not finish it since it bored and disappointed me. 

I started eating at The Mint, or today known as top of Binions, Hugo's Cellar, etc. at a very young age. My parents taught us how to have manners and how privileged it was for someone of our age to be eating in a place like that. To this day we still eat at those places and have the same exact manners. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way rules changed because there were 2 others tables seated near us about half way through our meal. At one table there was a guy wearing light colored jeans and a baseball cap. At the other there was a boy, maybe 6 or 7, making loud sounds, running around the table in circles waving his arms in the air, and the father laughing and encouraging it. I remember when if your jeans weren't dark enough you weren't allowed to dine. A baseball cap is just disrespectful, and the kid running around with no control isn't just the parents fault, but Morton's too. Like I mentioned earlier, the place wasn't very busy and this kid and his noises were obvious enough that someone at Morton's should have said something. They would have when I was younger so what has changed now? I am not paying a good chunk of change to have that going on around me. Because of yelps character limit, Morton's should be glad I can't comment any further! :)

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 58/100

Dining at Gordon Ramsay Steak was what I was most looking forward to on my most recent trip to Las Vegas. Fortunately, Chef Ramsay did not disappoint! Post-vacation, I still believe that our date night at Gordon Ramsay Steak was my favorite part of our weekend getaway!

GR Steak is located inside the Paris Hotel, right in the middle of the casino at the front of the hotel. The seating hostesses/kiosk are actually right outside of the restaurant, and I don't think they let you in unless you have a reservation or they're ready to take you inside.

We had made a reservation several months in advance, although I don't think you need to wait THAT long to reserve ahead of time. When you first enter, you are in a cylindrical tunnel that serves as the restaurant bar. Apparently it is supposed to represent the London Tube, and represents you traveling from Paris (the hotel) into England, GR's homeland.

While waiting for our table to be setup, they had seated us at the bar. After about a 5-10 minute wait, we were finally seated at our table, kind of off to the side near the kitchen/bathrooms.

I was kind of surprised at how busy/noisy it was in the restaurant. I knew it would be popular with GR's name tacked onto it, but it was a lot bigger and noisier than I had expected. Not a super intimate, romantic date nice restaurant. More trendy and lively.

Service was EXCELLENT at GR Steak! Our waiter, Freddy, was awesome. He came out and introduced himself, and then provided us with an iPad 2 that had the entire drink menu on it. It was really awesome because it showed photos of each mixed drink, the list of ingredients, etc. Then it had the beer and wine list as well. The last tab consisted of a photo and biography of Gordon Ramsay.

They also had a tasting menu, complete with autographed keepsake photo of Gordon Ramsay, but it looked pretty heavy and was also very expensive so we opted out of it. Freddy wheeled around a cart to our table and explained all of the different cuts of meat. Very informative and I loved the visual display. Freddy's speech was a bit scripted, but he said it with a smile and was very polite and well-mannered, which I really enjoyed! The guy who brought out our food/bussed our table was also super friendly and very courteous! Excellent service as well.

What we ordered:

--BREAD--
Ok, I had to mention this because they give you four types of bread with this butter that supposedly has volcanic salt on it, and omg, this is probably some of the best bread and butter I've ever had at a restaurant. All 4 types were incredible and I felt like I almost got full just from the bread! AND when the guy packed our to-go boxes, he packed us a fresh batch of new bread and butter! SO AWESOME!

--DRINKS--
PIMMS CUP: 
Wasn't a huge fan. I was interested because it had Pimms lemonade but it didn't taste that great. Also I felt like it had too much stuff added into it, like different slices of fruit and mint leaves.

WYDERS PEAR CIDER:
The description literally said it would give a pleasant ticklish kick. Definitely did!

--STEAKS--
BEEF WELLINGTON:
So, I basically felt obligated to order this because I knew Beef Wellington is Chef Ramsay's signature dish. I've never had Beef Wellington before so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I really loved the flakiness of the crust, and it blew my mind how it wasn't soggy at all! The meat was soft and delicious. I could also taste the lining of foie gras and that was pretty interesting. I didn't LOVE the foie gras but I thought it was good.

KOBE FILET MIGNON:
My boyfriend decided to YOLO and go with the Kobe filet mignon. Pricey, but totally worth it! I had a piece and omg, that was some melt in your mouth steak! He could not get over how good it was and said it was the best steak he's ever had. Excellent!

--SIDE DISH--
TRUFFLE MAC N CHEESE:
I LOVE me some truffles AND mac n cheese, so this was a winner! Super ooey gooey and cheesy, just the way I like it!

--DESSERT--
STICKY TOFFEE BREAD PUDDING WITH BROWN BUTTER ICE CREAM: OMG, this was SO FREAKING GOOD! I was really sad that I didn't finish mine because I was already so full...but seriously, I was in love with this dessert. I would go back JUST for the dessert. Interestingly enough, I thought that the ice cream was much sweeter than the sticky toffee pudding. They complimented each other very well and it was great! Highly recommend!

Overall I think my boyfriend spent around $250. TOTALLY WORTH IT! I would come back again for sure! :) Great job, Chef Ramsay and staff!

I noticed ZiKiZ while in the area a couple months ago and decided to bookmark it based on the positive reviews and the food sounded good. I met yelper Tracy P here for lunch and walking in we were greeted right away. The 2 men behind the counter were very friendly and told us about their menu. They said they specialized in customizing any order with what's offered on the menu. You pick if you want a wrap, salad or bowl (prices vary) and then pick what you want inside. They have chicken, steak, crab and falafel and a variety of veggies. 

Priced at $7.99 I ordered a "Chicken Wrap" with salad mix, red onion, black olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, ZiKiZ sauce and feta cheese (.50 cents extra for feta) inside a sundried tomato tortilla. I said that I would be eating the wrap inside, but would like the chicken on the side to-go. The guy looked at me kind of funny and said I needed to pick a protein to go into my meal. I looked funny back at him because he just told me a minute prior that they specialized in customizing any order, so what was the big deal with just putting the chicken on the side? I like the Greek Salad Wrap over at The Great Greek on Warm Springs and was hoping to create a wrap somewhat like that. I just said the chicken inside the wrap would be fine. My friend, Tracy had a coupon for $5 off any order over $20 which was a nice bonus. The guy accepted the coupon with no problem, but he majorly messed up when it came to ringing up our order. We wanted to add 2 sides and 2 drinks for an additional $2.99 each. He never asked us what sides we wanted and when we were looking over the menu deciding which ones we wanted, he says "oh I thought you'd want fries" and I was wondering why he was picking for us. I said no, we never asked for fries and don't want those, but we'd like to try the ZiKiZ rice. He then brought only 1 side of rice over and not the 2nd. Then he starts to talk to the next customer and we haven't even received our drink cups. I ask for them and he only hands 1 cup over. What the heck? We mentioned that we needed the other drink (deciding to just give up on the 2nd side we never received) and he just smiles and hands a cup over. I wasn't given a receipt, so I don't know how he charged me. I am thinking he didn't ring up the 2nd drink and side or something, but with the coupon our total was only $15 and some change, so not a bad price to try a new place out.   He did give the coupon back and said to save it to use again.

The rice was very bland. I really tasted no flavor and decided since it was in a container already to just take it home and give it to my dog with her dinner. The wrap was just average. I did like the taste of the tortilla, but the chicken really had no flavor and the veggies stood out more as far as flavor goes. With them not customizing my order the way I wanted, the food only tasting average, the mix up with sides and drinks and the food not being that great, I can't see coming back.

*update* after posting this review I got word they were talking about it on FB. I posted a screen shot of their FB post and I think it sums up the exact issues we had with their service. Very rude* 

we had a nice server so he is mostly excluded from this review. the rest of the experience was really disappointing and our whole party wished we would have left and gone somewhere else all because of how things started off. 

let me just say this place was practically empty the whole time we were there. there were a few people but most tables were empty. it was a pretty early dinner reservation. 

we originally only had 6 people confirmed for dinner the night of my birthday celebration but we had 4 more people confirm last minute. we called as soon as The Breadfruit opened to see about extending our reservation. They told us they would only accommodate groups of 6. 

this was a huge pain bc it was an hour before our reservations and people were already on their way. we were able to convince them to reserve a 2nd table next to ours on the patio so we would all fit and be able to sit near each other. Only after they confirmed we'd be ordering alcohol in addition to our meals of course. 

upon arriving we realized we had the whole patio to ourselves and if we pushed the tables together we would all be able to fit comfortably together with room for another table on the patio should they have more diners. 

we asked if we could push our tables together and they were very snotty telling us we were basically lucky that they even agreed to accommodate us to begin with and the set up they created was our only option. we should bow down and kiss their feet for taking us at all. 

like seriously?! you can't make any exceptions?! it would be one thing for us to suck it up if it clearly wasn't possible but it was totally possible for us all to sit together without changing a dang thing to the outside set up. it doesn't change anything!!!  our group could have sat together for crying out loud. it was totally possible. so stubborn and rude. 

so that really set the mood for all of us. if we thought someplace nearby could accommodate a group of 10 last minute we would have pimp walked outta there. 

but we endured it, tried to get past it for the sake of the meal and enjoyed all of their tasty drinks and the food was good. i loved their pina colada redux. the spring rolls were super boring flavor wise and left me thinking "what the heck, yelpers?! why did so many people recommend this?". my jerk chicken was tasty. 

about 95% of our group smokes so after the meal they went to the back area to have a smoke(it sounded like they had a nice area just for this). the servers chased everyone down in the smoking area and tried handing them the bill while they were back there enjoying themselves making things really weird. 

while the majority of the group was in the back smoking area they served me a free birthday dessert which was awkward bc shouldn't you do that when the whole party is around? they knew most of my party was out back seeing as how they chased them down with the checks. i blew out the candle and the few of us sitting there tasted it. it was one of the grossest things ever so thankfully it was free. it was a really sweet gesture though (but just fyi...dont order the potato dessert pie or whatever its called. better known as barf pie. i totally understand why they give that one away for free. no one would pay for that. just saying). but still, really kind birthday gesture. *ok, after reading some other reviews you people are loving this sweet potato pie. i am officially convinced they served us a rotten piece on purpose*

they don't usually let people split the check (we noticed this printed at the bottom of the menu) but our nice server offered to let us... only he made us divide everything up for him. i mean, isn't that his job? i get that it isn't normally allowed but he offered and it would have been really nice for him to divide it up for us. plus the restaurant was not busy and we spent a lot of money on food and drinks. it's the least they could have done but they apparently hate accommodating customers or providing an enjoyable dining experience for larger groups. this behavior would be acceptable at applebees or something. ugh whatever we were just so ready to get the heck out of there bc we were so clearly not welcome.

i def won't be back and i know most of my party will not be back based on this experience. 

this place really is only good for super small, intimate settings. i wouldn't recommend going here with more than 4 people. they make it known that they don't really want you there if there are more than 4 of you anyway so be prepared to have a horrible time if you're with a group.

Also, you can't even order breadfruit at the breadfruit.

4.5 stars!

Today was my second visit, and I like this eatery!   The ambience is laid-back, despite the gorgeous marble bar counter, distinctive winery flourishes (I looked for beer taps,  but didn't see any), including cut-out kegs doubling as decorative shelves, and one flat-panel TV (this isn't a sports bar). Matt and Shawn (the latter had been the former manager of neighbor Four Peaks) are gracious as  always.  Chef Indy remembered me from my first visit, as the guest who ordered the spare ribs without the BBQ sauce and the chocolate bread pudding, which he made a chocolate ganache especially for me, because I couldn't have the regular chocolate sauce laced with corn syrup.

This afternoon's dishes all tasted terrific, and I enjoyed the textures:

Calamari app- Menu says $10, and 3.5 weeks ago was half-off during happy hour.  Menu still lists the price at $10, but my receipt said $9, with $2 off during HH.  Loved the crunch!  The calamari was prepared just the way I like calamari to be, and I know Mom would love it, as well.  The accompanying garlic aioli and marinara were great, as well, with the aioli being a little saltier than I'd prefer.  My only gripe is that for $9 original price, I didn't get a lot of calamari, so I'd only order it during HH...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=Tc4nAKLyAECUuNVzJH0o2w#Tc4nAKLyAECUuNVzJH0o2w

Twisted Burger- $14, and comes with house fries.  Matt had told me about TR's mac 'n cheese more than three weeks ago and said that he could sub it for the fries, if I wanted.  The burger came with brie, perfectly-crisped thick bacon (!), arugula, and tomato jam, which I'd asked for on the side.  It's made with sun-dried tomatoes in a white wine and sugar reduction.  It added a definite sweetness to the burger and complemented it well, but for someone with inflammation issues, I'd skip it next time.  (Tomatoes, part of the nightshade family, is one of many inflammatory foods.)  The mac 'n cheese was DELICIOUS!  Today's preparation consisted of cheddar, parmesan, and provolone, and a little bacon.  I had to stop myself from eating too much!  Again, this dish is a little pricey for me, especially since I can't have the tomato jam...  The great quality of the mac 'n cheese kind of makes up for the price, just a little.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=SAuXcPnQ-Quc8EI3W6e2uQ#SAuXcPnQ-Quc8EI3W6e2uQ and http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=AZl3l-786NTEWyX8ephxKg#AZl3l-786NTEWyX8ephxKg

Double Chocolate Lava Cake- $8, and usually comes with vanilla ice cream, which contained corn syrup that I can't have, so  Chef Indy (sp?) offered to whip up some fresh heavy cream and granulated sugar.  He also offered to make a caramel sauce when I asked if instead of whipped cream, I could have some creme anglaise.  He wasn't sure which of the two I wanted, so he decided to give me both!  After the first bite of one lava cake, though, I knew the whipped cream and the caramel sauce were not needed.  This dessert should be called Better Than Sex, and really, what better metaphors for sex are there but volcanoes and lava, eh?  And boy, was this dark chocolate lava hot, thick, and decadent!  I'm getting excited just thinking about it!  ;)  I'm sorry I didn't take a photo of the lava oozing out... I couldn't stop eating to take other photos...  If only there weren't other people present, I'd have licked that plate clean!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=fLYO4YN5-mYty5nbRGvlFw#fLYO4YN5-mYty5nbRGvlFw

Btw, Thursday night is Ladies' Night, which means happy hour* deals ALL DAY for women.  Also, live music entertainment is held from 6p to 9p.  I enjoyed it, and so did the other women who filled up the main dining room.

*Happy hour deals changed since my last visit three and a half weeks ago.  It used to feature half-off appetizers, but now it's just $2 off the apps.  There are wine specials, too, both by the glass and bottles.  If you feel like splurging, try the Sexual Chocolate by Slo Down Vines, $45.  Very good!

C'est magnifique! 

I was really blown away by the food at March Bacchus!  I'm mad at myself that it took me so long to go and try this place out.  So many missed meals are running through my head right now.  Here were the highlights:

1. The food was amazing and easily 5 stars!  We tried a lot of things and everything we ordered was super tasty and tummy pleasing!  

The meal started for both us us with French Onion Soup.  We each got our own because my hubby knows I don't share French Onion Soup with anyone!  The soup was fantastic! It is easily in my top 5 of all time.  This is saying a lot because I have been to France and ate a lot of French Onion soup while visiting.

My hubby had the wine braised beef and it was really very good.  A knife wasn't even needed to cut the meat because it would just fall apart on it's own.  It was packed with flavor and really was yum-tastic.  

I went with the classic Steak Frites, because it is really one of my go to entrees.  My steak was cooked perfectly and was served with a delicious herb butter that was melting all over it.  The frites or french fries were some of the best I have ever eaten in my life, and i know a thing or two about french fries! To top it off, it came with the most fabulous Barnaise I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.  If it wasn't such a nice spot, I might have licked the ramakin clean because it was that yummy! 

My hubby got Tiramisu for dessert.  I'm not a Tiramisu fan, so I can't say much about it, however the hubs said it was delightful!

2. The atmosphere is beautiful.  The restaurant is set right on one of the lakes in Desert Shores.  You can't beat waterfront dining, especially in the middle of the desert.  I almost forgot that we were in Las Vegas, which makes for a great evening out.  Great great great location!

3. The staff was all very friendly.  Everyone we encountered was smiling, happy, friendly, and helpful.  Yay for happy people!

So with all of this good stuff, why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5?  There were a couple of snafus that made them lose a star.  Here they are:

1. We made reservations ahead of time.  I had mentioned it was our anniversary and we would like nice table.  When we got there, the hostess made a big deal of only having one table left and having to squeeze us in.  The table we got was up against the wall.  The floor around us had some broken glass as well.  It seems to have been missed during a clean up effort, but we could easily see it.  There was also several tables wide open for the entire time we were there right next to the water.  I guess we weren't special enough for those seats.

2. The servers were all super nice, but stretched thin.  When we had our server, she was awesome.  The problem was we had to wait long periods in-between visits because she was so busy.  I don't mind a leisurely dinner, but this was a bit extreme.  Luckily we had made over night babysitting arrangements, otherwise we would have had to leave well before we were done with dinner.

So the food is awesome, the locale is beautiful, and it is a great place for a nice night out, just make sure you booked your babysitter for an extra hour or 2.

===================


I bought a yelp deal ($10 for $20) a few months back for this place not knowing they weren't open yet. Kind of frustrating that they would post the deal and not even be open, but it did say at the bottom of the yelp listing it was "coming soon" so I will take the blame. Their Facebook page said they would be opening the following month, but that never happened. I reached out to Caf Casera by e-mail to see if they had any updates on when they would be opening. The owner responded promptly and said they were working out some last minute things and should be open soon and they would let me know when they opened. The owners word was kept, I received a e-mail letting me know they were opening and ready for customers. It took me a couple weeks after receiving the e-mail to make my way over, but with as long as I waited already what was a couple more weeks? 

Walking in hubby and I were greeted and given menus right away. originally, we planned to eat inside the restaurant, but the fountain machine wasn't set up yet and they only had cans of soda ($1) and bottled water ($1.25) so we decided to order our food to-go and get drinks from a gas station. What a bummer because they had Cherry Coke! I spoke with one of the owners, Julie who said they were waiting for the "Coke man" to come hook it up. I had a wonderful conversation with Julie who also introduced me to her husband and mother-in-law. I could tell while talking to Julie, just how genuinely passionate her and her family are about the food they are serving. She told me how they are there at 5 am each morning making everything from scratch including the corn and flour tortillas that are all personally made by her mother-in-law. 

Some of the menu items here will be something you have seen before at other restaurants, but I promise you Caf Casera puts there own twist on each dish and I personally haven't ever tasted anything like it. I have never heard of "Sizzle" which is the specialty here, so I obviously had to try it! 

Sizzle Tacos ($7.95) - Seasoned ground pork and beef, onions, cabbage and cheese sauce inside 2 crunchy taco shells. The taco shells tasted amazing! They had such a fresh flavor and weren't greasy at all. The stuff inside the shell is an acquired taste for sure. I thought it was alright, but can't say I would order it again. Hubby took a bite and thought it was the best thing out of everything we ordered and he ended up switching me his Bean & Cheese Burrito for it. The burrito was so good! The flour tortillas here aren't your average flour tortilla, they are a bit thicker. The beans and rice were great. The beans are thick and the rice has a nice flavor, nothing dry or mushy about it.

Cheese Quesadilla ($2.25) - The menu says it is grilled with Colby cheese inside, but honestly it tasted more like Velveeta cheese. The cheese was very pasty. The tortilla was kind of burnt on the outside too. After two bites I was done, I just didn't like it. 

Sopaipilla ($2.75) - Yes! This was great. I have had different versions, but not one like this before. They put cinnamon and powdered sugar on it and it can easily be shared. It does have a sweet flavor, so if sweet things aren't your style you can try one plain. I enjoyed the sweet flavor and would order it again. 

As I sat there waiting for my food to be prepared, I noticed the menu boasted that the dishes were prepared with a "New Mexico Flair" so if you want green chile they can add it for 75 cents. It confused me because if the dish is prepared with New Mexico Flair, wouldn't it already have the green stuff in it? Julie was kind enough, because I forgot to order the chile on my tacos, to give me 2 free sides of it. This was awesome green stuff indeed! Hubby was just eating it with a fork, cold and all. I do wish the chile came warm and was already included with the food, since the food is prepared when you order it, a customer could just say they don't want it on there. Oh well they were gooooood!

The inside was very clean and the decor was nice. There are about 4 tables inside if you don't want to take your food to-go. Caf Casera also offers breakfast burritos on their menu. Purchase a yelp deal and give this family run business a try! 

Mon - Sat .... 7 am until 10 pm
Sunday - Closed

Let me apologize for not writing during these past few days...  sori!
Here is the reason...  I knew I was going to Vegas, I understand that my next one is my 100th review, therefore, I had to review one of the much better places to make my 100th review shine!  There's no other place better than City of Sin to scout out all the awesome eateries so that is why I've delayed my review for the entire weekend.. again, sori!  I do hope you all understand...

So... 100th one... what should I have...  Buffet of course!  Didn't get the chance to check out Wynn again (it's been a long time), but at least I end up at Rio's famous Carnival World Buffet...  So here it goes...

First of all, the name of the buffet has the word "World" in it... I bet you wouldn't expect it but literally, the selection is as big as this world!  Last time I've been there I remember the food lineup were as long as Walmart on Black Friday!!!  But now... it seems like the line is actually as long as Best Buy on Black Friday!!! (For those who has done the BF thing will understand my reference, good luck by the way if you are going this year!)

Focus Henry Focus!!!  Ok... so... damn!!!  The selection seem to be longer than before... so let me tell you how this great wall of buffet is set up!  

Starting from the left, you got like 8 different styles of pizzas, some condiments for burgers, bunch of seafood delicacies, crab legs & crab claws, deep fried seafood, mash potatoes along with the carving station, roast chicken, Mexican food sections such as taquitos, flautas, quesadilla, mole, carne asada, more mexican condiments, etc., The Bar (for some real fun drinks not ice tea or coke), Fresh Noodle station with pho, egg noodles, soups ranging from egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, etc. fish balls, pork balls, beef balls, more chinese condiments, chinese food such as chow mein, stir fried veggies, some meat dishes, dim sum, sweet bbq pork, roast duck, Italian/seafood, lasagna, meat balls, blackened catfish, broiled salmon, salisbury steak, country fried steak, , corn, pork chops,4 types of hot soups, salad station, fruits, cold salad related sides, wall........  Whew.... I'm terribly sorry for the EXTREMELY LONG RUN ON SENTENCE, but that is the best way to describe this unworldly buffet line!!! It is literally that long!!!  And let me tell you, despite all the descriptions, I probably missed like 30% of the food on that great wall of buffet!!!  It's absolutely ridiculous that they expect anyone to try all of their food here!!!

Ah ha!  That's when I come in!  Agent H on the job!

So I had to get very small portions and was actually able to get one of each samples from the plates on display... OMG was I full!!!  I swear I will never do that again!!!  Rio I hate you for doing this to me!!!  You leave all this deliciousness out there just so you can see me suffer!!! WHY???  (But I thank you for the yummy food!)

So enough with the descriptions.. I know if I continue on this post 5001 character is not enough!  So here's my assessment and evaluation of this monstrosity that they called a buffet line.  

Everything was actually decently made!!!  I pretty much enjoyed every single thing there with the exception to the following...  (you definitely should read this and skip them because I suffered to get you this piece of important info!)

Things to skip:
**Sushi -- hard cold rice, not fresh at all
**Veggies -- waste of stomach space
**Noodle soup -- This is an iffy... I loved the soup but was way too salty, maybe Mr. chef there can add some hot water or something? It's quite salty
**Salmon -- Not sure how but they overcooked it... pretty dry and hard
**Corn Chowder -- nothing special, again takes up space in tummy
**Dim sum -- maybe it wasn't fresh when we got there but looked stale and old... very uninteresting.......
**Fried fish filet -- Dude, these patties are from the supermarket!  (Van De Kamps)  Not tasty at all

Do try everything else!

Now... they still have dessert!!!  AHHHHH!! I can't take this anymore!  All this food and now a dessert island station right by the exit!!! 

Sure I'll take some yummy treats please!

Gelatos! Gelatos! Gelatos!  Tried all of them and here are my favorite and least liked choices...

Dislike:  Coconut---way too sweet
Right in the middle:  Vanilla Yogurt---pretty tasty without that much sugar
Favorite:  Sugarless Chocolate---WOWzers!  Taste like chocolate without the sugar!  Rich, Creamy, and absolutely amazing for being sugarless!  Where you've been all this time???

Other desserts were on my notable list too such as bread pudding (I heart bread puddings with Whiskey sauce), cheesecake cup, and the best dessert would have to be the super eggy flan!  Extremely enjoyable!

So now... can someone wheel me out of this place?  Get me out of here before I say... Yes... I would like to see what else they got... maybe another ice cream?  maybe another cake?  Maybe this is one of Sin City's absolute best?  Just maybe...

I was in my Hometown for the Christmas celebration with my family. My Dad wanted to treat us to an All-You-Can-Eat Friday Night Fish Fry and gave us a couple of places that serve one. It wasn't hard for me to choose. Prairie Lanes was a place that I spent many hours at as a kid. The Bar & Grill part is all new & refurbished, so I wanted to see the new changes. Plus, I remember there not being a menu because of the limited options they had "back in the day". Now, they have a full menu to offer. We made plans to all meet up at 5:30. 

Prairie Lanes has ample parking all around and we found plenty of spots available. They have entrances on the North, South, and smack dab in the middle of the place. The best entrance for the Bar & Grill is the middle. You will find the Bar area immediately. There is a host stand, and they will find you a table or booth. We needed a table for 7 and there was no issue with that. We got a big round one right away. Getting settled in, our server stopped by asking about drinks. I don't think anyone of us knew what we wanted. She offered waters to us all, which we accepted. When she returned with the waters, only two of us had figured out what we wanted to drink. I asked about tap beers and our server grabbed a table tent off a booth to show me. She said she would be back with the two sodas that were asked for. Most choices seemed domestic on the tap list. Our server brought the sodas and started taking our food order at this time. In all, 3 AYCE Fish Fry's, one senior Fish Fry, and two kids meals. I also ordered a High Life on tap. The Fish Fry comes standard with Beer Battered Cod, Salad Bar, Soup Bar, & choice of potato. The choice of potato is French Fries, Baby Reds, or Potato Pancakes. I went with the Pancakes. Alyssa did Baby Reds. 

I checked out this Soup Bar first which is right next to the Salad Bar. They offered up 3 kinds of Soup. Clam Chowder, Chicken Noodle, & Wisconsin Cheese. They also offer bowls & cups for dishing your Soup in. I grabbed a bowl of Clam Chowder and headed back to the table. Alyssa made her way up when I got back. I put a little pepper in my Chowder & dumped in the little packet of oyster crackers offered. Creamy, Hot & Fresh. But as Alyssa put it. It tastes like it came out a bag. It wasn't bad. Just....basic. I went up a second time to try the Chicken Noodle. I did a cup of it. The noodles are big and thick. The broth is flavorful. Hardly any chicken in it. Next up, Salad Bar. This is surprisingly solid. They have all the bases covered on this one. Everything was fresh & full. They had an attendant right there monitoring it. Coleslaw is available here, too.  It's something that I didn't try. 

I was a couple of bites into my salad when our dinners arrived. The Fish looked good. Two pieces of Golden Fried Beer Battered Cod. The Potato Pancakes not so much so. When I think of Potato Pancakes, these I didn't have in mind. They were little McDonald's like Hash Browns. Or Larger Burger King like Hash Rounds. Take your pick. Tasted like 'em, too. Straight out the freezer. Slid out the bag. Into the fryer. They tried to make them authentic by providing Applesauce & Syrup to dip them into. The Baby Reds Alyssa got were nice. They looked pan fried. The Cod Loins were cooked too much. Cutting in, they clumped instead of flaked away. Biting down, you knew it. Firm. Not tender. It's one of those thing where it's not bad, just not good. Seeming that they only offer one kind of Cod, Deep Fried. They should be able to handle cooking it the right time. Ah well. There's always the reorder, right? Those were overcooked as well. Not burned, just over done. By 2 or 3 minutes. When I mentioned this later, everyone who ordered Fish thought the same thing. I had to ask for lemon, as for that didn't come with the supper, but tartar sauce did. It tasted fine, just seemed like it came out the bottle.

Our server was so very patient with us. When we were indecisive of drinks, she didn't blink an eye. She was always checking up on us. Awesome job by her. The AYCE Friday Night Fish Fry costs $11.99 here. Could be worth it, if the Cod is cooked proper. For what we got, it's a little steep. The menu here is nice. They have a burger that me, living in the Twin Cities, was surprised to see. The Juicy Lucy. While it might not be the way I'd spell it (Jucy Lucy), it sure was a welcome to see. I tried to get someone at the table to order one, to no avail. Probably a good thing. I'll take 'em out for an authentic one when they come to visit us.

Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas, Carlo's Bakery! I ate at Buddy V's a couple weeks ago and one of the managers stopped at our table to check on us. After letting him know I was a "Cake Boss" fan, he let me know when the bakery would be opening and that contestants from "Next Great Baker" would be there. I obviously cleared my schedule for opening day! Carlo's Bakery (located inside The Venetian) is literally right across from Buddy V's and the pathway between them is a little more narrow than usual, so I wondered about how they were going to tame the long lines because there was no way there wouldn't be one.  

The grand opening was at 6 pm, so I wanted to get there early hoping to beat some of the crowd. I had my hubby and 2 nieces with me and we arrived to Carlo's Bakery around 5 pm to find a long line formed already. Venetian security had a field day with this one! We found our place at the end of the line and even though there were a lot of people in front of us, the line only grew l-o-n-g-e-r behind us. I was thankful for the spot we had after seeing just how long the line got! I appreciated that we were given samples from Carlo's employees while we waited. So let me talk about the wait. WOW! It was almost a 4 hour wait from the time we first got in line and actually got inside the bakery. I know that is a long time, but it wasn't so bad with all the activity going on around us. Between the free samples and seeing people from Next Great Baker and Cake Boss go by and stop to talk to us and take pictures, it didn't feel like 4 hours and honestly was a freaking blast! Hubby was a real trooper holding our spot in line while we would take off to get our picture with Buddy, Grace, Danny, Mary and people from NGB. 

Poor Buddy! He really didn't have the proper help keeping people back (like I said the pathway is a little more narrow than usual) and at one point they did have a line to meet him, but they had to stop it because so many people were crowding around and there wasn't a clear path for the people walking by who had no idea what Carlo's Bakery even was lol. At one point, Buddy came back for pictures and my nieces and I were able to get a picture. After the picture, Buddy gave one of my nieces a great big hug and a kiss on her forehead. She was SO excited smiling bright and cried a little saying "I'm never washing my face again" ...bless her precious young heart! They both had a blast and it's one experience they will never forget, myself included!

One inside the bakery, we were greeted and the girl who helped us was very friendly and helpful. it was kind of crazy inside the bake shop with people, so I just randomly picked out different things I could see. Ordering was quick, but getting what I ordered took a bit. While we waited (maybe 10 minutes) the sweet smell inside was heaven and I liked the open windows showing the bakers working. They have these windows not just inside the bakery, but outside too. When my name was called I went up to pay for my order and saw everything was packaged nicely. This was a great experience and I will most definitely be back!

Lobster Tails ($5.95) - Excellent! Try this! It's flaky with a cream inside and a little Bailey's Irish Cream. This was my favorite of what I tried. 

Eclair ($2.50) - This was cut if half and had a filling. It also had chocolate on top. This was pretty good. I thought at first site that it didn't have enough chocolate on it, but the chocolate was thick and the right amount.

Cream Puff ($2.50) - Custard filled with powdered sugar on top. I took a bite and thought it was good, so I told hubby to try it and he finished it. Glad I at least got a bite!

Chocolate Cannoli ($3/Mini) - This I figured I would like, but I ended up loving it! The amount of filling was decent. I'd order this one again.

Cannoli ($2.50/mini) - The filling has a ricotta cream with chocolate chips. I did like this one a lot and would eat it again, but I personally preferred the chocolate cannoli.

Strawberry Tart ($2.85) - This was my least favorite. If you do try this, I would recommend eating it soon. When I got home with my box, the strawberry tart looked like it melted a bit and the strawberry slid off. None of that really bothered me because I hadn't had it before and didn't know it wasn't something that didn't travel well. The way it tasted did bother me though, The bottom was rock hard and I had trouble even biting into it. I might try it again in the future, but am in no rush.

Chocolate Fudge Cupcake ($3.50) - I had the option between a vanilla or chocolate cupcake and chose the chocolate. It had a chocolate fudge frosting with sprinkles on top. This was just average. Not bad, but not great.

Carrot Cupcake ($3.50) - Of the 2 cupcakes I tried, this was the best. The cupcake was moist and the cream cheese frosting was very good. 

They also have merchandise for sale (mugs, cookbooks, etc.) and take special orders for cakes and other goodies.

Amlee Chinese Cuisine is a local family run business. They have been in business for over 30 years. I remember eating here when I was a teenager and really enjoying the food and lunch specials at Amlee Chinese Cuisine. After going to the movies at nearby Galaxy last week we passed by here so, I suggested to hubby that we come back and try this place and see if it was still as good as I remembered. With a fellow yelper in tow we headed for dinner here last night and wasn't disappointed. 4.5 stars!

Walking in we were greeted and taken to our seats. Water and menus were brought right to our table right away. We shared "family style" and picked out somethings we all like. Food is brought out on a cart and served to you. 

Fried Wontons ($5.95) - These came 12 per order and I liked them. Light, yet crunchy with a small bit of chicken in the center. It came with a sweet and sour and spicy mustard dipping sauces. 

Szechuan Chicken Salad ($10.95) - Yum! The salad was tossed in front of us. The portion was huge and there was plenty to go around. I really liked the flavor of the dressing best and the fresh carrots stood out.

Vegetable Fried Rice ($8.95) - I felt there could have been a little more flavor in this dish. The size was perfect especially if sharing, but the carrot and peas didn't really stand out flavor-wise. The rice was cooked just right though.

Szechuan Beef ($16.95) - So good! The beef was so tender and the whole dish together just tasted great. The huge fresh mushrooms were tasty.

Orange slices were brought to each of us at the end of the meal. I felt the charge of $3.95 for a soda was steep. Free refills, but almost the price of an appetizer. The service was great and we left full and pleased! The owner stopped to talk to us for a moment and she's genuinely passionate about the type of food they are putting out as well the type of service they provide.

They offer delivery so call to check the areas they cover. You can also place your order for pick-up if you don't want to dine inside. They have lunch specials that range in price from $7.95, $8.95, $9.95 and $10.95 depending on what you order and it includes soup, egg roll and choice of steamed or egg fried rice.

So I just got back from Vegas...... and you know that anytime anyone who goes to Vegas and back always have a new review posted shortly.  (You don't understand how excited I am to be back just so that  I can write this review for you...LOL!)  So without any further delays, let me share with you what I've discovered while I'm there for a very short, quick, and fun weekend!

COSMOPOLITAN.... A brand spanking new hotel sitting right next to Bellagio, has finally opened up it's doors to the glitzy lights of Vegas.  Even though this review is not about COSMO, let me tell you a little bit about it....  This is a Marriott created hotel (NOT part of the City Center / MGM Group), it's got the Planet Hollywood hip feel to it, but man... the design was just to...CRAMMED!  They try to squeeze so much decor into this place that they made it feel so small!  Anyway, there is your sneak peak into COSMO... please do read my future reviews on this place... (Or check it out yourself!)

So the highlight of this review of course is the Wicked Spoon Buffet.  Like what I would usually do now once I'm at a location I'll check in on yelp and try to read the reviews prior.  So before deciding to give this place a try I found out that it's a Tapas-Style buffet.  I was like "huh?" but let me tell you... what an awesome concept this place is!!!

So we went for lunch (The dinner the night before was insane with lines snaking throughout the buffet so decided to delay my experience)  No lines at 2:30pm, got in immediately, and off to the food we went...

Let's start with the drinks like how a normal meal would go... we asked for ice tea, coke, lemonade, and water... all were normal except for the water!  It was Aquahealth water (http://www.aquahealth.com/)...Never heard of it but it was some really delicious dispensed water!  (Very much like Voss Water for those of you have tried that before!)

The food was simply crazy!  Everything pretty much was served in small portions but all in miniature cookwares!  (small pots and pans, frying basket, etc.)  So the presentation was 5 stars right there!

Food was decent tasting.... (sweet potato fries in small basket, dungeonese crab claws on porcelain dishes, white truffle risotto in an All-Clad like sauce pan (mini-version!) and many many more!  Unfortunately I can tell you everything I've had simply because there were no names but a description in front of each of the servings (much like an high-end restaurant), but all the food tasted pretty good and you can definitely tell that they focused on the quality and not just quantity.  The only complaint that I would have with this place is properly the warmth of the food served... again, this place was opened 10 days ago so I'm gonna let that go...(thus the -1 star)  I'm sure that once they have everything in place things will be simply awesome!  (But they do have a pretty decent selection of food available all in Tapas-Style servings!)

The mini-dessert island is no joke!  Everything was all attention to detail oriented so it's awesome to see it being displayed!   But their highlights of the dessert island was the following in my personal opinion...

Madelines:  Mini madelines super buttery yet soft!  OMG.... it is one of the best I've had and it's super cute!  Tiny and delicious!!! (great poppers!)

Gelato Bar:  10 flavors to choose from!  Al delicious and not overly sweet!  (Like They Cup in City Center)  Great flavor and just right!  Served in mini cones!

Chocolate Dipped Strawberries:  THE BIGGEST AND SWEETEST Choco-dipped strawberries I've seen in my life!  And it was simply the best period...  Imagine... wait staff on their break getting some food to the back breakroom..... what's on their plate?  Only Choco-dipped Strawberries....  Gotta Get'em All!!!!!  You will not regret trying this for sure!

Finally, the service was awesome!  Our waitress was super nice, attentive, and very accommodating!  Again I can't imagine how they will be once they are finally all in sync with this place say a month from now...  It's gonna be awesome and I'm already looking forward to it!  So kudos to the awesome service training!

One ending high note.... we spoke with one of the managers Jackie (totally funny, awesome, and again, accommodating to the max!)  She mentioned that currently her head chef is driving her nuts!  He is literally creating new dishes on the fly on almost a daily basis (in 10 days of opening they had 7 menu change!)  She said that so many locals came here several days in a roll just to see what's new the next day!  That is simply crazy, I personally don't think they can keep that up, but if they do... I will almost have to rank them higher than my all time favorite Sterling Buffet...

So... let's get the food hot and tasty, and keep the inspirations flowing on a daily basis.... Wicked spoon....I'm hoping that you can be my new number one on my buffet favorites list!  Trust me... that will be some accomplishment!

Wickedly Awesome!

* Since there's no ONLINE MENU - I took pictures for ya'll! Look in the photo gallery. * 

The namesake carries some heavy expectations and also prejudices for a TV personality, but this place really has done justice even on just their 2nd day of being opened. I was excited for this as a few days prior I walked by and they were having a meeting. I stood there listening in and looking through the curtain like a total creeper.  I was worried there might be a wait, being a famous name, and brand new. I did try to call, but had a hard time getting to them and decided to come chance it anyways. It was busy, but there was no wait to be seated when we came at 5ish.

The menu is a cheeky paper menu that they encourage you to take as a souvenir, if you wish. With us being a bit of fans, yes, I took mine home. *blush*. Some people might be confused with the two different pricing but the orange is for Total Rewards members of PH Hotel&Casino so before dining, go get a card for a savings of $1 off per each item you order. 

The Farm Burger - this was a rather good burger if you like something to showcase natural flavors than big zesty spicy accompaniments. You can tell the meat quality is top notch and the flavor on it is fantastic. We did order a medium rare but it was more on the medium side, just a small oversight. The duck bacon was a curiousity, but basically just like bacon, just less fatty than pork. The brioche bun was so lovely soft and had a perfect flavor and toast to the inside. The egg is always a good flavor with beef. It needed a tad something to tie it all together so put some of the chipotle or curry ketchup on it! It isn't a huge burger, but trust we were full splitting all our items and I can tuck in and eat. 

Fresh roasted chili dawg - so the beef "devil dawgs" are cooked in a hellfire hot sauce and then grilled. I would rarely say a hot dog is gourmet or worth paying for, but this was seriously good. Fuck Pinks next door (its not like the one in LA anyways), and get this instead! I love the crispy texas toast like hot dog bun it was on and the dog was snappy, and super juicy and does taste of hotsauce it was cooked in! The toppings of the jalapeno, roasted fresno peppers, avocado, onion, cheddar and chipotle mayo were perfect with it. 

Just Fries - these were lovely skin on fries. I read in a press junket they use a specific more fluffy potato and do the 3 step fry method. These were crisp yet fluffy, not thick but not thin either and for me that's the ideal fry. The chipotle and curry ketchups were both very good, I didn't have a favorite. I just alternated every other fry.  

Shake # 5 - they split ours up for us which was a nice move on their service. This was rich and so good. I love the texture and flavor contrast between the shake and the swirl of pudding they put. This one was chocolate hazelnut pudding with coffee shake and a awesome praline cookie thin. It didn't taste too much like hazelnuts though, but more like chocolate caramel pudding but still good. It was good to split, it would have been too much for me to do one whole. 

Service was super friendly, personable and attentive. Much more cohesive than I would expect of a newbie restaurant. They asked how we heard of them, hows our day going, explained the menu, etc as we sat down and browsed. Our drinks were filled without ever asking and we were checked on a few times to see how we are doing. Their uniforms here are something else. Ladies are very form fitting and short so there's a eyecandy element to this place. After ordering our food did take a while to get to us so we sat around for a bit. Still, I would rather have it cooked right than rushed to where standards are lowered. 

Very satisfied with this meal and will be returning absolutely! Of course on principle I do reserve 5 stars for consistency upon return visits, but this is a highly recommended 4 stars. Definitely one of the better burgers I've had in this city and I don't trek onto the strip for bollocks either.

We have really enjoyed other Ramsay restaurants. The wait for BurGR is just ridiculous! We were told it would be a 2 hour wait and they would let us know by text (they text your phone) when the table was ready. I'm not much of a burger eater and rarely order them anywhere, but with Ramsay having his name on the restaurant must mean it's going to be worth the 2 hour wait right? Wong! When I first heard how long the wait would be, I wasn't even upset. I had been wanting to try BurGR and with a wait time like that I got more excited to try one of these well loved burgers. One thing is they have strict rules here at BurGR. When we got the text alert that our table was ready, some of us needed to use the restroom on our way back to the restaurant. Now we were on the property, never left. The hostess still refused to seat anybody until everybody was there and accounted for. Really? it seemed like we were on a field trip and the bus driver was counting heads to make sure everyone was on the bus.

Once we got seated it took 10 minutes for our server to acknowledge us and he took our appetizer order, but not our food order. He literally took off after we said what app we wanted. Around 15 minutes later our "Roasted Jalapeno Poppers" priced at $12 showed up at the table. They looked so good!!! Too bad they didn't live up to what I saw. The insides were still cold. It was only hot on the outside and the poppers were a real disappointment to our whole table. The cheddar ranch that comes with it just tasted like regular ranch. The poppers come in shot glasses with the ranch and we still had one left on the table that nobody really wanted. 20 minutes later our server came back to take our dinner order. Phew it was some wait time from beginning to finish at this place! Hubby and I decided to split a burger and a hot dog and the fries and rings are a generous portion so we just got 1 order of each for the table to share. 

"Just Fries" ($8) - They are hand-cut and come with a side each of curry ketchup and chipotle ketchup. I really feel for the price you get a lot of fries and even if sharing, you will still have plenty. The problem is the fries came out ice cold. I picked one up to taste and spit it back out. Nobody at our table wanted to eat the fries. 

"Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings" ($9) - Parmesan cheese on the rings with  chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip on the side. Again, the portion and price are very fair, but the rings were straight up ice cold and the ranch is ranch, nothing cheddar about it. 

"American Burger" ($13) - The burger had american cheese, onions, tomatoes, pickles and butter lettuce. When our food arrived to the table, 40 minutes after placing the order, I'm pretty sure my mouth started to drool as the burger was put down in front of me. It looked very good. I will say they after cutting the burger in half, I noticed that it was cooked just as I requested which is actually hard to come by here in Vegas. Too bad the actual burger had zero flavor. The burgers are grilled over apple and cider wood is what they brag about here yet the burger seriously had no flavor and like the other food it wasn't even warm. There was way too much bun going on with this burger and every time I took a bite the bread fell apart as the rest of the burger. It was just not good at all. There wasn't anything I ate during this experience that was enjoyable. 

"Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg" ($13) - Too much dog, not enough bun. Did taste decent, but they need a bigger bun for it. Better than the burger! Hmmm.

I let our server know that the food was cold and the fries and rings were so ice cold that  t hey must have been sitting for a while. Our server responded with "Sorry, I was busy doing stuff and then I had to go to the bathroom" to which I replied "did you at least wash your hands after touching your junk and brought our food" and he just said "I'll take the fries off" and then he was gone. The whole meal should have been free since it was mostly still on the table because we didn't want to eat it. I said very clearly and loudly that I had a total rewards card to get the discount on our bill and he just shrugged it off and charged the card with the regular prices anyway. If you have a total rewards card then you save so much off each menu item. So you can see where this can actually add up every time a menu item is added to the tab. I said something to him and he said that he would correct it, but it would take a long time and the card would have to be charged twice to fix it. We just said to forget it and I told him it would come from his tip. My friend ordered a burger and paid extra to have an egg added and was specific about it having a runny yolk. Our server said that wouldn't be a problem, but when our food came the egg on her burger was cooked way too long meaning no runny yolk. Such a major disappointment Gordon Ramsay BurGR turned out to be.

Oh, St. Francis, how can you get is so right, but so wrong all at the same time?!?!?

I particularly love their HH menu with delicious meal choices stolen right from their regular menu for under $10 and $5 cocktails before 6pm every day, even on weekends. To have a great HH in Cenpho, you've got to have good food options and good drink options, not just one or the other. 

I've ordered close to half of the items on their menu and hands down, my favorite is the chicken salad sandwich. I usually order it sans toast, and without the bread. The dressing on the chicken salad is delicious, but slightly over powering, so I also suggest asking for half of the dressing. I also enjoy the Meatball appetizer, but I would suggest sharing this one with a couple of people. It's basically two or three big meatballs, while delicious, I've usually had enough after one and am ready for my chicken salad.

I always enjoy their vegetables; they're oh so delicious, perhaps even up in the amazing category. This has been hit or miss for me, but I usually try to get them to serve whatever their vegetable is that day. I enjoy St Francis for their fresh and delicious flavors, they can do some great things with veggies here, the trouble is they don't ever seem to want me ordering them. I'm at about 50 / 50 when it comes to them subbing out veggies for the fries, so when they don't seem to want to accommodate, I generally get the side salad instead. They usually give me some response like, the kitchen can't make you a side of vegetables, that dish comes with either fries or a side salad, and I ultimately give in on the salad. 

Honestly, why do you need to be so b*tchy about subbing out fries for vegetables, as if there is no kitchen back there. I'm not asking for free food, charge me for the change and call it a day. Is it impossible for you to imagine someone might NOT want to eat fries!?!?! 

On one occasion, I was here with a large party of 15 or so for a birthday meal. We made reservations and requested that separate checks be accommodated; well, it appears there was a breakdown between the person who made the reservation and the wait staff who apparently don't like doing separate checks. They refused to accommodate this request, and it started to get awkward. I was not looking to make a big deal out of it, I took care of the bill myself, and went on about our evening without upsetting the nights festivities, but that could have been handled better, much, much better than me paying for everything myself.

A few notes to St. Francis operations.
Why is it so difficult for your staff to accommodate something other than fries with a chicken salad sandwich? You're a restaurant, you make food, I want food, please make me the food, so I can eat the food and leave happy.

Why take a reservation with the stipulation of accommodating separate checks and then have your wait staff groan about how they can't do separate checks?

Staff should be accommodating where they can, I don't feel I'm being unreasonable here to expect to be able to order what I want to order, and pay how I want to pay.

I guess the moral of this story is, if you want to come with a large group, they will probably make a big deal out of it, so be prepared. If you want to change up your meal with something as *crazy* as vegetables, good luck. With all that in mind, I still think St. Francis is one of my favorite spots. I'll be back by myself for sure, I might even bring my friends, but only if I'm planning on covering the check.


Happy Yelping Phoenix!

I came to Fogo during Restaurant Week 2013. After trying to make a reservation the first weekend of restaurant week, I was denied because they were already booked. Since this was going to be one of my birthday meals, hubby said to call back and ask for something towards the end of the week so he could take the day off for it. I called back asked about Friday, August 30th (last day of restaurant week) and the woman on the phone said 2 pm was available so I reserved the spot. When we arrived on the 30th the parking lot seemed dead. For a place that was booked the weekend before, why did it seem nobody was here? I soon got my answer on the front door. They stop serving lunch at 2 pm and pick dinner back up at 5 pm. Fogo called as well e-mailed me conforming the reservation, so I was baffled. 

Entering Fogo we were greeted and taken to our table. We sat for a few minutes and then our drink order was taken. I then headed to the salad bar where I was surprised at how some stuff looked very fresh and other stuff looked like it had been sitting there untouched for a while. There was food scattered about along the salad bar and the ranch dressing had a ladle from another dressing inside of it and the ranch ladle was just laying on the counter. I avoided having ranch (my fav) on my salad because there was just too much of a mixture of who knows what inside of it. I went with a few things that looked fresh like tomato, mozzarella, croutons, parmesan and the basil dressing I put on it was delicious. 

I wasn't able to have anymore salad, but will explain about that later. So, the meats started coming. The servers were nice, but I don't know if they understood us or what. I told them what type of meat I would like and they would bring something else. They asked how I liked my filet and I said closer to well-done and I get brought a piece of raw red meat. The meat was seriously hit or miss. Some pieces were either very flavorful and tender while others were too raw or nothing but grizzle. The best thing here isn't the beef, but the sausage and bacon wrapped chicken. They do cook those 2 things right and the bacon wrapped chicken might just be the best I have ever eaten. Included with the meal were sides. The 'Mashed Potatoes" were just average. The "Cheese Bread" was dry and disgusting. The cheese bread tasted like a old biscuit. The "Carmalized Bananas" were actually very good, but the "Crispy Polenta" wasn't for me. I don't know if this experience was due to the time of our reservation or not. I wouldn't have even picked the time if it weren't suggested to me by Fogo. 

Then dessert came. Fogo claims the "Papaya Cream" is their most requested dessert. Most requested by who?? Sure it looks pretty upon presentation, but this dessert had zero flavor. I could have opened a jar of baby food (the dessert was that consistency) and tasted more flavor. Everyone at my table left their dessert unfinished. 

Too bad I didn't try more from the salad bar before we got cut off. The server came to our table and said that the salad bar was going to be closing so the employees could eat. WTH?!?!?!?!?!?!? The RW menu price was $30.13 and included an all you can eat salad bar, endless meats and a dessert. By this time we had only been seated maybe 20 minutes and were the only customers. I felt like we were the ones intruding on the employees eating since it was several of them at the salad bar and sitting at the tables near us. I first must that I think it is a great perk that the employees get to eat a free meal. They work hard and if the food is going to waste anyway then why not let them enjoy it too. I just don't understand why paying customers get cut off so they can have that perk. Dinner didn't start until 5 pm and it wasn't even 2:30 so these employees could have let us enjoy our meal and then stuff their faces. I contacted Fogo about this and got a call back from Whitney, who said they do let the employees eat, but they should have waited until we were finished. Whitney never once said she was sorry on behalf of Fogo and never returned the promised phone call the following day. Just because the small salad I was allowed to eat tasted good and the bacon wrapped chicken was to die for, doesn't mean everything else was acceptable. I would much rather give my money to Texas de Brazil.

The place we originally met a friend at had too long of a wait to be seated, so I suggested we give Mark Rich's New York Pizza & Pasta a try since it was in the same shopping center and we hadn't been there before. Italian sounded good to us all so we headed over. Walking in we were greeted and told to sit anywhere. Our server, Ellen, introduced herself right away and took our drink orders. 

We started out with an order of "Garlic Knots" priced at $2.99 for 6. These aren't really garlic knots, but garlicky pull-apart dinner rolls. They were very good! I wouldn't recommend them though if you don't like a lot of garlic because there is not only garlic on the top, but covered on the bottom as well. Hubby and I enjoyed them a lot however our friend found it too overpowering. More for us! The side of sauce that accompanied the knots was decent, but bland. 

So they had a special going on where 2 can dine for $25 and my friend and I decided to go for that. The deal lets you pick 1 soup or salad, 1 pasta each and 1 dessert to share. I chose the "Italian Wedding Soup" to start and couldn't have been more pleased. The soup had plenty of flavor and even came with a side of garlic bread. For my main meal I had the "Baked Manicotti" and I have to be honest, I wasn't that pleased with this dish. The cheese on top seemed overcooked and when I went to cut into my manicotti, the cheese came all off. I just set it aside and didn't eat it. The dish was drowning in bland sauce. I ate half of it and it wasn't bad, it just didn't have much flavor. The manicotti also came with more garlic bread. I just feel it coming with the soup and the pasta was a bit much. For dessert it was "New York Cheese Cake" and that went home with my friend so I don't know how it tasted, but I heard back the next day from him that it was very good! Hubby had the "Italian Sub" priced at $6.99 and he loved it. I tried a bite and liked the flavor. This is a sandwich I would stop by and have for lunch some other time when I am shopping in Centennial Center. Our friend had the "Tomato Basil Soup" and the Spaghetti & Sausage" and he said the soup was very good. He found the sausage in the spaghetti to be good, but the sauce bland. Parmesan cheese was added and all was good. I would have given 5 stars, but with the main dish not having a *wow* factor this place is more of a 4.5 rating total for me. I enjoyed enough of my food and the service to definitely come back!

I can't speak highly enough about our server, Ellen. She was just fantastic! Ellen checked on us often and when I told her I wanted to try the pizza next time, she surprised me a few minutes later with a sample of hot fresh cheese pizza in a box! She knew I was full, but asked me to try a bite so I could tell her how I liked it. The pizza was hot and delicious. It was thin, crisp and had the right amount of cheese. They sell pizza by the slice so that is good to know for future visits. 

From 11:00 am - 4:00 pm they have a handful of lunch specials that are worth checking out. They also offer gluten free pizza and gluten free pasta. You can place your order online for pick up.
