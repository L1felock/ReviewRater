I think this place took notes of the complaint of the smoke smell here, cuz as soon as i walked in here, i felt like the place was doused in perfume. I had a headache, and this place made me super nauseous with their overpowering vanilla scent trying to hide the smoke. 
Other than that, the place is beautiful- and has one of my favorite stops in vegas- Jean Phillipe Patisserie. Dude stayed here before for a bachelor party and our friends stayed here also. Thumbs up on their stay. Very modern rooms. 
And more important note again, there is a Jean Phillipes.

This is probably the easiest trail that you're ever going to hike besides walking around your block. You only go up an additional 400 plus feet in elevation during the hike. I believe the total loop is a little over 4 miles. This is a great hike for beginners and hiking in groups where you can have casual conversations. There are some rocky parts but mostly this is a dirt trail. This hike at a slow walking pace is about a two hour hike. There are some nice vistas so bring your camera.

This Outlet is very similar to Tangers located near Arrowhead.

For the most part, they have all the same stores with a few exceptions.  Two that come to mind is Ralph Lauren Polo and Tommy Bahamas.  

RLP is massive in size and at least two to three times larger than any other of their outlets.  The selection is outstanding.  From what I can deduce, they are taking their department store inventory and just cutting them out entirely.  The merchandise is marked down across the board by 30%, see photos.

Tommy Bahamas Outelt is new to me, though I have shopped at their stores in Kierland and Scottsdale Fashion.  The quality of their merchandise is outstanding.  Another plus to this location is the Saks Fifth Avenue, Off 5th outlet store.

I was unimpressed today with this do it yourself (DIY) car wash. 

It was a nice touch having a credit card accepting swipper to go with that Quarter eating dial apparatus that starts at $1.75

However the water pressure is low and the "Spotless" setting is sadly all but ineffective.  In a hard water area like greater Phoenix, you would think they could get this right. 

Return factor, zero.  Sorry.

Best shop in town.
Every employee at Dyno-Comp is well-informed and treats the business like their own. This translates to quality work and attention to detail, as well as attention to the client.  Nobody is trying to screw you or upsell, and the work they do is bar none the best available.
I personally have dealt with Richard, Ken, and Ron, and could not be happier. 
If you want your car to go from just a car to something truly special, do yourself a favor and take it here.

Boy did I sure feel like heel when in an attempt to catch a football I clipped the front of my shoes on the curb and scraped the leather. I mean these are not just any shoes people. Let's just say if Carrie Bradshaw were a man, Carrie Bradshaw would have these puppies. I'm talking handcrafted Johnston & Murphy. Ok? I spent a week grieving unsure what to do. I ate a lot of ice cream. Watched Tori Spelling I'm a woman in peril movie marathon. And cleared several boxes of tissues.

Tony Orlando and Dawn

My three favorite Tony's! Six bucks and an hour later, they were in pristine condition. My feet and my soul, once again unified. Happy. Comfortable. And, most importantly, styling.

I just went into the MAC store today because I lost my favorite lip gloss (maybe it fell underneath my car seat?) anyway the gal who greeted me was very helpful.  Luckily there was a card on me so my last purchase was recorded.  She was able to find the color of my lost lip gloss.  She also told me that a percentage of the sale of this particular gloss goes to help Aids.  Interesting. I bought two lip glosses. I'm happy the store isn't far from where I work in case I lose another lip gloss.

VIP. Hmm. It must stand for Very Icky PooPoo. Yep. That's what it means. I mean really, how cliche, a stinky, stinky, cab. What is this? New York? Thank God all the windows were down, because this was some serious BO. All the Right Guard in the world would not have helped this man. I'm thinking, perhaps, a good ole Silkwood shower may do the trick. 

So. Stinky cab arrives driving like a bat out of hell. I thought we were going to be run down like those folks at the Farmer's Market in Santa Monica. But we jumped in, breathed through our mouths and prayed for a non fatal journey. 

So Stinky. That's my nickname for him, drove like a drunken Helen Keller on a mission to hit every possible pothole from Kobalt to The Clarendon.

I would say one star. But, hey, we did indeed arrive alive. And now I have this not so positive yet colorful review to enjoy. So. Two stars.

We are a family of six and moving from a 3200 sq. ft. home is no easy feat.. After interviewing several other moving companies, choosing Creative Moving and Packing was an easy decision. Conrad was professional, knowledgable, and flexible - our closing date changed 3 times and Conrad said, "no problem, we'll make it work".  The employees that packed us up and moved us were friendly and courteous; they helped make one of the most stressful events in life (moving) into a smooth transition for me and my family. I highly recommend this company for any type of move.

Neiman Marcus meet Salvation Army. Salvation Army meet Neiman Marcus. Nice. 

Wow. A vintage/thrift store that doesn't smell like my Aunt Helen's wig closet. No stench of mothballs, decaying bodies or stale smoke from an old pack of Capri Ultra Light Menthol 120s. 

Organized. Well staffed. Well, staffed by people who are actually engaging and interested in you. Unlike SO many other similar shops in this area where you get a little bit of "OH, you are so lucky to peruse my crap" attitude. 

Most importantly...great stuff. Vintage Italian dishware (think Fiesta with a Tuscan twist), Disney movie stills, framed, and selling for a mere Abraham and an entire case of well lit (much like myself at the time of shopping) Prada, Jimmy Choo and Minola Blanaks!! Just my luck! None in my size.

I would rather be a freegan and dumpster dive then ever swing into the Rainforest Cafe again. I would rather eat.....
....at the worst Applebee's in America
....vending machine food
....my own flesh

Now, Rainforest could be fun if you were 12 and drunk. Then the overly fried foods and canned sauces could cure your munchies. I would have rather had Totino's pizza rolls than the nasty appetizer combo we shared. The plant and animal filled space could really use the services of Merry Maids. Really. How do you clean all that crap? 

The rainforest "thunderstorm" is as exciting as the one in the produce section at Safeway. So if you have kids who like to drink, you might have a good time here. Otherwise I say stay home and check your trash like a good freegan.

Oh no!  I only just saw that they closed down when I decided to post long overdue pictures of one of my favorite treat spots on The Strip!

At least I still have a super cutesy apron from this place to remember them by.  My favorite cupcake of theirs was the Kir Royal.  It was described as a moist raspberry cake with bubble champagne buttercream.  Every cupcake I have ever gotten from them was moist and airy.  The buttercream can get a tad on the sweeter side but it's nothing you can't fix by removing some of it off.  This place loved using the edible glitter as well.  

Oh well.  I'll keep warm and fuzzy memories of The Cupcakery in my thoughts.  Farewell, old friend!

After a three night stay at the Cosmopolitan and three nights checking out Bond, this small bar near the LV Strip Entrance did not live up to hype. It's a-ok, but was dead all three nights except for some people gambling on machines at the bar. 

This Bond was nothing like the cool suave style of a sexy British spy. 

It was more like Double O Disappointment. Hey-yo!

We must of went during an off period because there were no DJs or dancers any of the nights. It was just a nice, clean bar. Again, it's fine, but nothing exciting or really special if there aren't dancers or DJs.

22" wiener, $27, meh. 
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=4ZfcCa4m5RWvO4EFzfYm1A

I know it's unfair but I have to compare all hot dogs to what you can get at Costco for $1.50. And in this case, I would have happily forwent the baguette, chili, bacon, cheese, kraut, etc. etc., for a dozen Costco dogs and Polish dogs. 

Here, the massively long and narrow wiener was overcooked to the point where the skin was starting to crinkle and pull away from the meat (that's what she said? Ew). Add too many par toppings and you have an overpriced novelty dog at an equally novel bar-type thing. 

Fun if you're an Alice Cooper fan or need a bar to get sloshed and watch games at. But this review is just for the dog.

I've broken up with frozen yogurt.  Boba? Boh-bye.  Haagen Dazs can go fahrvergngen themselves.  This is it!  This is my go to dessert destination in Las Vegas.

There have been so many glowing reviews by a lot of reputable Yelpers that it seems ridiculous that I could add anything else into the mix.  Even though my review of their business when they were known as "Frostybites" expresses my sentiments clearly, I love the Ex-Straw-Binary that much to say it again.

It's probably not the most popular flavor but for some reason, it's the perfect sweet spot for me.  When you combine their shaved strawberry ice with strawberries and then strawberry condensed milk on top of it all, it's like the strongest, sweetest musical note.  

If the Ex-Straw-Binary were a guitar solo, it would be Adrian Vandenberg's solo from the Whitesnake classic "Is This Love".  The tone, the sustain, the subtle power of it all.  I eat it up.  It IS love!!

I do feel a little looney sometimes getting the same thing over and over (I've gotten the pumpkin twice with graham crackers which is a solid 2nd place) but I get over it and get it again.

Prepare for a shift in perspective...

Too many times, Mexican food is rather typical.  In fact it's likely that, with few variances and exceptions, predictions prevail.  Not that Mexican food isn't super tasty, because it is.  It's just that it isn't usually served with much explosive flair or out-of-the-box creativity.  (I mean, we've all come to know what to expect.)  That is until you've visited the Barrio Caf.

When here, forget what you've known, what you've grown up with.

At the Barrio, Chef Silvana's sophistication and assertiveness with the culinary traditions of Mexican cuisine challenges any and all notions of south-of-the-border authenticity.  Imagine: apples, pears, dried apricots and pecans nesting harmoniously amidst savory chicken, enveloped in a roasted poblano pepper and finished with a light almond sauce, the colors of the Mexican flag (cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds) artfully decorating the myriad of flavors...

"Chiles en Nogada," as explored by Guy Fieri's "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives," is the signature dish that brought me to the artistry of the Barrio.  And it is also the "Chiles en Nogada" that has forever now changed what I thought Mexican cuisine could actually be.  Chef Silvana certainly has an eye for presentation.  To visit Barrio Caf is to appreciate that vision.

Granted CLT seems to have an Einstein Bagels everywhere, but this one offers a more interesting food option.  The sandwich was very good. But I felt for the folks behind the counter who were friendly, but because it was New Years Day, looked like they were pulling a double shift.

I ordered the Turkey bagel.  It was very good, had a fair amount of meat on it and the bagel stood up to the toasting. All pluses in my book.

I took my 2002 Saturn into this shop based on the good reviews on Yelp.  I was not disappointed.  Bogi is terrific!  I picked her shop because it isn't too far from where I work and they took me to work and picked me up when my car was done. I was tired of going into shops where they tell you need other work done. Bogi explained everything to me. What sold me was I met a man there taking his car in (told me he had a newer car under warranty) and he told me he felt better taking his car into Bogi's place rather than the dealer! She is terrific! Will definitely take my car back to her.

This is a great little spot in Old Town.

It's a small bar inside, but outside is where you want to be.  The atmosphere, people and cheap beers will make you think you're back in the Midwest or East Coast with your college friends having a great night!

Best buffet on The Strip! Not to mention it's also located inside the best hotel in Vegas. Prices vary on the day of week, but the brunch buffet on Tuesday was only $22, which included unlimited champagne. What a deal!

Their international selection is absolutely mouthwatering. Your eyes will definitely be bigger than your stomach, so make sure you pace yourself. Hightlights included pastas served in mini skillets, fried chicken wings in mini fry baskets, awesome carving station, giant made-to-order omelettes and a beautiful array of desserts.

Save the buffet for your last day. Perfect cure for those hangovers!

Ok, most people hate going to the laundromat to do their laundry.  I have no choice but actually like coming here.
This place is super-clean with a friendly staff (mostly Spanish-speaking but I'm fluent so THERE :P).  There are *no* pigeons running around this place.  Always a plus!
You use a card here, no quarters dug from under the couch cushions.  I like that.  
The place is spotless.  There's always someone cleaning up.  The machines are regularly cleaned out of forgotten socks and panties.
They even have a little store with a variety of different detergents!  
They are open late, which seems to be when I go there.  Many TVs throughout, tuned into different stations.  There's even a PacMan machine to play!

We dropped by here for an after dinner cafe.  I have been to Espressamente in Italy as well as here, and at the V.

I like the selection of cafes, sandwiches, crepes, macarons, desserts and gelato.  In addition, the Vegas locations are open until 1 am.  What I don't like are the prices.  A large cafe is $5, and it isn't that large.  Sandwiches are $10, crepes are $12, and the portions are not that large.

Nonetheless, you have to give Espressamente credit for its offerings which are quite extensive.  If there were one by my house, I would be a regular.  Plus, I love the color of the rainbow offerings w/ their gelato which I found to be very good on previous occasions.

I remember when I first bought my first MIcahel Kors bag and folks were like MK what's that? A couple months later. When I got my mom a Micahel Kors watch, it was the same. Nowadays, Michael Kors is the IT Brand.  Folks are posting about it on Facebook, Instagram etc. It's popularity was evident too when I stopped by this outlet on a busy Saturday,  There were lots of folks admiring the different bags, wallets, tech accessories and jewelry.

The deals at this outlet store were good! They had different special offers! It was nice to see some of the newest styles offered at a discounted price as well. They even were offering MK lipstick at a special price (I didn't know MK had makeup! So cool!)

I did not buy the lipstick, but I did end up with a nice watch in a style I've never seen before. I was happy with my purchase and happy with this store. It's nice to find good deals and different, unique styles that are not easily found elsewhere.

My wife had a grilled hot dog and sweet potato fries while I had a Chicago Hot Dog, waffle fries and a soda all for $21.91.

The food was good, but I was shocked by the cost of our lunch. I guess those prices might stick when the captive movie going crowd is looking for a quick bite before the movie but this local knows where there's a better bang for the buck at some other eateries in the area.

A
love
train

URRKN stands for Underground Railroad Rescue Kitty Network and was started by Tina LaBlanc in Oct of 2011.  It's a way of transporting kitties from shelters, foster homes and temporary homes to their "forever homes".

It's basically a series of wonderful volunteers that are willing to transport cats from one place to another.  One long trips each volunteer will drive whatever distance they feel comfortable and then meet another volunteer at a prearranged location.

On a long trip it might be many volunteers that selflessly give their time and transportation to help the kitty get to it's finally destination.  A person waiting for the kitty can actually keep track on the progress as the cat travels on it's "love train".

We recently adopted a kitty from Florida that had to be transported to Rhode Island.  We contacted URRKN and volunteers were quickly arranged so our kitty, Gersemi, arrived to us quickly and in great health and spirits.

There is no charge for this incredible service but of course donations are accepted.  It all depends on the kindness and generosity of strangers who anonymously do good without asking for anything but a simple thank you.

The volunteers of the URRKN along with Tina LaBlanc, are doing great deeds in a quiet way.  Such acts of kindness for no other reason but to be kind are wonderful and rare things that should never be taken for granted.

Even though this would pretty much be a one and done for anyone living in Las Vegas, I highly recommend checking out the Neon Museum.  Having the lights on definitely added awesome effect to the signs for the 7:30pm tour.  My wife and I both agreed this was much better to see at night.

Our tour guide, April, was chockful of great information.  She really enhanced what would have been a 10-15 minute walkthrough sans guide to an hour tour full of history and fun stories.  That alone made it well worth the locals admission of $22.  Some of my favorite signs included Sassy Sally's, the humungous Treasure Island skull, the H tile board of the Horseshoe and the creepy at night looking Jackpot Motel sign.

Dollar Blackjack...Wah?! I'm there
The dealers are ornery but I don't care.
Everyone says this place is run down but I don't think so.  It seems good to me, maybe a bit dated with their decor, but I'm here to gamble and get drunk.  Who cares what it looks like?
I always win so every time I'm in Vegas I come here for a bit to make me some money.
*rubs card on nipple*
I always end up paying for the gas because everyone else lost :(
*shakes fist at Vegas*

I got super drunk one time and peed in the corner...and then ran away.

This may be the first review that I've awoken from a deep dream of peace to write.  Ok, first I had to make a pit stop, but then it was time to pen my thoughts and aspir... ooooh hoooold on, brb...

Now, where was I.  Here's a fun fact... the human body can hold up to a quarter of its own weight in disposable fluids, whose liberation can be mobilized by Arriba's own spinach enchiladas.  Ole!

That's right, the green leafy vegetable made famous by a marble-mouthed sailor, now compels me to blow my own ballast tanks... again and again

But I have to say, this couldn't have come at a better time, with tomorrow being the inaugurate outing of my office's hiking group.  Magic 8 Ball says "Signs point to yes" that I'll collapse 27 minutes into the trek from dehydration, and possibly require professional extrication.

You know what doesn't require professional extrication?  The cauldron of dysentery brewing in my lower GI.  Spiiiicy!

But to be fair, its not all waterloo, Arriba's.  I really should thank you for lightening my load, even though I've really never felt more bloated and irritated.  *quizzical look*

And if I ever nurture the desire to tarry in your cantina, which is somewhat reminiscent of The Blue Oyster on tango night, I'll be sure not to waste the opportunity, and schedule that pesky colonoscopy for the following morning.  Osmoprep's got nutin on you, honey.

You would have no idea which show I was referring to if I said I saw it in Las Vegas and it starred a group of fairly attractive women doing dance routines to prerecorded music while topless.  That not only describes "Sydney After Dark", but also current strip shows like "Fantasy", "X Burlesque" and "Crazy Girls".  

Australian accents aside, there is nothing new being offered here.  As I watched the prerequisite cowgirl scene, I wondered how/why THIS had become the formula for Vegas topless shows?  Maybe having a girl that sings makes it classier than a strip club?  There has to be a more creative way to present half naked girls!  Oh!  They have a girl in a leotard doing an aerial scarves act!  That was so cool and original like 10 years ago but a snoozefest today.  A topless comedian would have been much better.    

Keeping with the Aussie theme, they dance to mostly native artists from the "lahnn daahn undah" like AC/DC, Tina Arena, Sia and INXS.  I can only guess their sultry version of "Locomotion" was inspired by Kylie Minogue.  They even did an aboriginal routine which left me feeling cultured and educated.  That's a lie. 

The few people in attendance (15% capacity at best) were all moved up to the best seats so buy the cheapest ones if you're going to pay.  I would recommend "Fantasy" at Luxor over this.  The girls are hotter!

I really hate to give out my annual award for "Best Response From a Business Owner" this early in the year, but I really do think I've found a winner. Here's most of the message I got in my Yelp inbox from Melody H. about my experience:

"Hi Catherine, I remember when you came in and your horrible attitude. I cannot believe you would be so stupid and make-up lies as you did here. I thought to myself when you came in and spoke with me that you were strange. I just had one thing to say after you left and I told the girls there is only so much lip stick you can put on a PIG!"

It's just pure awesomesauce covered with cherries on top! Congrats to Melody H.--you are truly one in a million (and I mean that in the worst way possible, heh).

Would I spend $300 per night on a room? Hell to the no. Will I sign up for their text message promo list and get a code to get a room at about $90 per night. Fuck yeah.

I got just such a deal for a 700 sq ft HRH suite with two queen beds over Christmas weekend. And I've gotta say these are pretty nice digs. Two big TV's a ginormous swanky bathroom (complete with kickass deep soaking tub), comfy beds, roomy couches, and a sweet bar area... this is how you do Vegas right, kids.

Sure, it's kind of a bitch to take a cab whenever you want to go to the strip, but with Hard Rock being directly across from Hofbrauhaus and Double Down... well, color me happy.

HEALTH IS HAPPINESS

  The Peccole Ranch Walking Trail (PRWT) is an unsigned Summerlin trail system in the neighborhood bounded by Hualapai Way to the west, Charleston Boulevard to the north, Fort Apache Avenue to the east, and Sahara Avenue to the south. After experiencing PRWT, I see it as three connected concrete trails winding through a continuous linear park. Trail 1 starts at Hualapai Way to the west which is 0.4 miles north of Sahara Avenue. A tunnel carries it under Grand Canyon Drive. After intersecting with a spur trail, it heads northeast. A second tunnel carries it under Red Hills Drive. Leaving the tunnel it parallels Apple Drive up to it concludes at Trail 2 near Charleston Boulevard. This is the physical fitness trail. Fitness stations with cooresponding descriptive signs adorn the parkscape. They include a vertical ladder, chinning bars, and squat-stretch bench. If health is happiness, this is the trail to happiness. Trail 2 runs south of the commercial and residential development along Charleston Boulevard from Hualapai Way to a couple hundred feet east of the Apple Drive tunnel. Trail 2 weaves through a linear disk golf course. Trail 3 is the spur trail off Trail 1, which continues the due-east direction of PRWT past a surface crossing with Preakness Pass to the easternmost point at Fort Apache Road.

  In late November, I spent a couple of hours enjoying an adventure on PRWT. It reminded me of its sister linear parks in Summerlin: The Pueblo Park and Cottonwood Canyon. However, there were a few characteristics that separated PRWT from its sister linear parks. In comparison, it is a more compressed space bordered by walls instead of larger homes up on hills; with the exception of the trail east of Preakness Pass,  the landscape is golf course green grass; and parking lots are nonexistent. 

  My adventures along PRWT color me impressed. Graffiti is nonexistent. Mature pine trees and colorful trees that left sprinklets of fallen leaves on golf course green grass attracted birds. Birds were everywhere. Many of the adjacent backyards have humingbird feeders. The white concrete trail is a work of art that gently weaved between the bordering walls of the linear park and under picturesque tunnels. Green streetlamps complimented the parkscape. The gentle inclines added texture to the trail. And the fitness stations are a celebration of good health.

  This is an unadvertised trail. Signing and parking lots are nonexistent. My advice is to park at either the Sahara West Library parking lot or Hualapai Commons Shopping Center anchored by Smith's at the southeast corner of Charleston and Hualapai. To reach PRWT from the Sahara West Library, you will walk north on Grand Canyon Drive for 0.4 miles until you reach the overpass. The Hualapai Commons is adjacent to PRWT. Both parking lots are a relatively short distance east of the 215.

  After spending a couple of hours exploring PRWT I felt uplifted and a few pounds lighter than when I came into the trail. I felt healthy! As the sign says on the fitness trail "health is happiness. " And because this is the season of giving, I want to give people happiness by recommending an adventure on the Peccole Ranch Walking Trail.

You don't know how much I love you,
You don't know how much I care.

This review is way old but since I'm sick and have nothing better to do than stare at my feet and feel like crap I thought I'd catch up on old reviews before they are erased from memory.

Happy Hour is where its at son!
1/2 off Steaks (and a gnocchi I just couldn't pass up)

The vibe is straight up sexy, (I never use that word because I feel awkward saying it out loud) but its just dark, sultry and sleek and straight out of an old-school movie.  

The specialty cocktails are divine, the bartenders take their time and they know wassup.  Quality drinks cost money, but oh what a way to burn.

Three Birds left and pounds of Steel makes for good target practice! 

The Pittsburgh Steelers have one of the best records in football history. They have won 5 out of 42 Super Bowls. Only 3 teams have won 5 and that is the Steelers, the Cowboys and the SF 49's. Seeing the Steelers are the only one of those three in the playoffs, they could break all records this year, by winning 6 Super Bowls. IF they go to the Super Bowl again this year, it will be their 7TH appearance.

IF, is the biggest word in the English language. If my grandmother had 4 wheels, she would be a box car. 

I was not thrilled when Bill Cowher left the Steelers, but I must say Mike Tomlin has done a fine job and we were blessed, to have had two great coaches. 

I have been an avid collector of autographed sports memorabilia for many, many years. I have quite a lot of autographed Steelers merchandise, including a football jersey signed by the Steel Curtain. 

I can't help but admire that more and more each week and think of how Mean Joe Green and LC Greenwood will be watching the games, with nerves of steel and how Ernie Holmes and Mad Dog Dwight White will be smiling down upon Big Ben, Willie Parker, Hines Ward, Troy Polamalu, Harrison, Holmes and the rest of the team. 

This week the Steelers have home field advantage of a ridiculous time of 6:30 against the Ravens. The Ravens play hard and rough and my fingers are crossed that we beat them for a third time this year. 

Everyone is thinking of how great it would be to have a PA. Super Bowl. I went to Heinz Field for the 2004 Eagles/Steelers game. I drove from Philadelphia along with Eagles Fans galore. We won and it was an awesome ride home. 

GO STEELERS!! You rock my world! Give me one for the other hand!

Seriously feel like I'm in Hawaii every time I come here. This has been one of my favorite bars in Vegas for years and I don't think that will ever change! With island inspired drinks filled with various rums and juices... bring your sweet tooth! They even sell collection glassware for $20 and it comes with one of their signature drinks. Ive bought all of them haha. Vegas's best Mai Tai by far and amazing decor what more could you ask for! Oh yea and on Fridays from 4-8 if your wearing a Hawaiian shirt your drinks are half priced! The only bad thing about Frankies is there aren't more locations in town.

Tickety Tacky in only the best way possible.  I actually really like this place.  The neon lights reminds me of my mothers make up in the 90's.

Nick the waiter was a sweetheart.  I am ridiculous in my requests sometimes, but he managed to cater to all of them.

The portions are huge!   My steak and spinach salad was delicious!  The steak was tender and medium rare just as I requested.  I asked for candied walnuts in it and Nick brought me a bowl of them!  That's what I call service.

Late night eats in Vegas!  I'll definitely be back!

OK so the bf is a few years younger than I. Just a tad. OK. So, he's 17 years younger. Oh my god! I'm like, a gay male cougar. I'm a manther! Anyway. I digress. A bunch of his same aged buddies wanted to meet at Kobalt. Rickie and I arrived first and discovered a bright, well kept, no dartboards kinda bar. No smell of stale beer. No problem finding a parking spot. It was actually. Civilized. And it's a gay bar in Phoenix? Wow! After having a few rounds of drinks and perhaps forgetting that I was the elder of the group, one of them exclaims...."Yea. This place is pretty cool. Too bad there's so many guys over 40 here." 
Wow. I was one of those guys. But, hey! What? just because some of the hair on my head has made its way into my ear canal and lower back. And just because I  know Harvey Milk was a slain gay rights activist and not a type of dairy beverage. I can't have a place with a piano, a granite bar and a barstaff that truly knows how to make a Gibson. Thanks Kobalt. I'm blue no longer.

What happened to you, Rain!? You're like a celebrity, once glamorous and incredibly popular, but that has fallen into obscurity. You used to be the posh spot, the happenin' talk of the town... but now you're overused, dirty, discarded. 

This review is long overdue and almost joined Rain by also falling into obscurity.

The layout is still cool, the music still poppin', but never in my life have I come across SO MANY ROAMING HANDS in one place. How shady can a place be such that at least 75% of the male population is trying to violate the females?!? I'd be dancing and suddenly a hand had appeared up my skirt and all the way up my thigh. I immediately moved away and noticed my lady friends were undergoing the same horror from other men. 

I was uncomfortable on the dance floor, and that NEVER happens. I love to dance and meet people and have a great time, but I'm not about to put myself out there for THAT. Gross!

Let's just say I won't be back. Ever. Unless they have a successful Perv Purge movement.

DATE TIP: Fellas, let me break it down for you. Women typically don't appreciate random hands up their skirts. At least buy them a drink first! Ha.

In December, I  went on a short tour of all the most popular California Ramen-Yas, and the weirdest thing was that I really could not find one that was better than FUKUMIMI. I believe that we Las Vegas folks should feel privileged that we have the very best Ramen-Ya in all of America. 

There are two owners here: former Osaka native: Katsu-San. And, Torrance native: Daisuke-San. Torrance is the Ramen Capital of America. I lived in Arcadia most of my life, and I always remember the Japanese residents driving all the way to Torrance whenever they wanted Ramen(and that's a pretty long drive). Believe me, there is not even one bad Ramen-Ya in Torrance. And, any Japanese chef from that town is going to be an expert at perfecting a bowl of ramen. 

The Japanese-American community here in LV believes that FUKUMIMI is a Hakata Ramen-Ya. But, Katsu-San informed me the other day that it is actually an Osaka variation. I have never in my life seen an Osaka Ramen-Ya. No wonder the broth is so unique with it's Tonkotsu fusion of Miso, Shio, or Shoyu. 

What makes FUKUMIMI the greatest Ramen-Ya in America is that it's Tan Tan Men is a Tokyo Chuka Ryori variation.  There are other Ramen-Yas in LA that serve Tan Tan Men but apparently it is a Yokohama variation(Yokohama having the giant China town). Chin-Ma-Ya is the only other Ramen-Ya in America that features a Tokyo variation, but on Jan 20th Chin-Ma-Ya closed it's doors, making FUKUMIMI the one and only place in America to get this variation of Tan Tan Men. I asked Daisuke-San why the Tan Tan Men at FUKUMIMI is almost identical to Chin-Ma-Ya, and he informed me of the close connections he has to the owner of that establishment. Apparently, it is a shared recipe.

I just want to point out that every Japanese Yelper but 2 have given this place 5-Stars. And the 2 J-yelpers who didn't give this place a 5, gave it a 4-Star rating. Isn't that proof enough that this is the best Ramen-Ya in America?

The lunch bunch convened on this vegan hotspot to see and be seen... and to try out the bowls.  Imagine my surprise when Linh bucked the system and ordered a vegan bbbq burger with mock bacon.

Had I known that seven minutes later, I would staring longingly at his entree, with his highfalutin thyme fries being the object of my desire, I would have surely placed my order for "ditto" instead of the "diablo red bowl".  Pretty sure J-WoW and her "coconut curry bowl" shared in that sentiment.

The fries are wonderful.  Very thin and crispy, they were reminiscent of succulent pomme frites one might find in a culinary school's student restaurant.  Les frites taient affirmation de la vie!  Oui oui, hon hon!

Knowing Linh won the entree lottery, I put a little more thought into the tSoynami frozen dessert, but that didnt keep Joycie's PB&J treat from walking away with the win, and Linh's Almond Joy non-dairy coming in a close second.  As she took her victory lap, I mused "sometimes you feel like a culinary looser, sometimes you dont".

I'm prepared to dominate on my next foray, because I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!

The Cycle Pub Crawl took us here as one of the stops but we wish they hadn't. For a chain restaurant, their prices are designed to gouge the nearby tourists. $16 for one Coke and one poorly crafted margarita. This is what you'd expect to pay at a nightclub, but not a crappy chain restaurant.
We all ordered drinks upon arriving and a couple of us had to flag down servers for a missing soda and margaritas. We watched the bartender keep dropping his drink recipe notes. The nachos were disgusting. It tasted like stale chips with what looked like dog food on top...I wouldn't feed this to my dog. The servers had no idea who ordered what and settling the bill was a monumental task for them. Make sure you count your change before you leave.
A very disappointing experience.  I wouldn't waste my time or money since there are plenty of other better places to go nearby.

Shhhhhh! can you keep a secret?  

We stumbled upon a secret pizzeria in the new Cosmopolitan hotel.

It was 3 in the morning and we roll in jonesin for some food.
Nico was such a sweetheart, he told us stories, listened to ours, and gave us advice on life, love, and all things worldly.  He was like an elder teaching us life lessons while he kneaded dough and turned it into pizza for us!

It literally turned from this.....

Great pizza, nice crust, and awesome company.  Nico hooked us up and managed to teach us about life all in 30 minutes.  He made me feel like I was in Italy and if this was his pizzeria he'd have given us the pizza for free!  Nico made our trip a memorable one.

Pancakes were not steaming hot. They give one small hard as a rock ball of butter that punctures the skin of the pancake. Hash browns were not served with the pancakes. The wife's French Toast was obviously frozen and not served hot.

A little advice for Ihop management. Have an Ihop management type that likes pancakes order pancakes with one hard minuscule piece of butter on barely lukewarm pancakes and see if he/she enjoys that meal. Then go  over to the Waffle House and learn how butter should be served. For those management people that need the cliff notes version, you serve the butter soft and the pancakes hot so that the butter melts on to the pancakes.

I've heard some scuttlebut over the years that there are health code regulations about serving butter soft. I find that hard to believe since every other restaurant I visit seems to have soft butter.

This will definitely be my last visit to Ihop.

The bf and I paid a visit to the Conservatory & Botanical Garden at Bellagio this past weekend :) It was all decked out for Chinese New Year, with festive decorations everywhere, incense burning, a tree made out of gold coins, and a giant mountain with practically full-sized horses in honor of the Year of the Horse. It was wonderful!

I hear they re-decorate it to match whatever season/holiday is going on at the moment. I would love to see each of the rotations in a calendar year!

The Conservatory is located just past the lobby in the Bellagio hotel - very easy and quick to get to. It has wonderful natural lighting coming in through glass panes in the ceiling, and has beautiful flowers and plants planted everywhere. Great photo op spot as well!

It actually wasn't as big as I remembered it to be when I came here as a child...but nonetheless, definitely something worth seeing during your visit to Bellagio!

There is a garden gift shop nearby where they sell nice souvenirs and trinkets :) There's also a store that sells the beautiful glass flowers hanging from the ceiling in the lobby of the hotel, but I'm sure they cost an arm and a leg just for one!

Forget about those other foot massage places that "waste" your 1 hour treatment time by soaking your feet for half an hour. This no frills, straight to business foot massage business is the real deal!  No "happy endings" here, unless it refers to satisfied customers with their full body therapeutic massages.

I actually dropped in on a whim, as I was feeling very uncomfortable with severe neck and shoulder cramps. I did the quick Yelp search to see which massage places are still opened and picked one of the closest ones.  I parked at the massage place next door by accident, but am very glad I walked the last few feet to Good Season's Foot Spa () for their "ancient professional reflexology".

My therapist was Tom, and I learned that he has been doing this in California for 12 years. He was definitely an old pro at helping customers feel better with his expert hands.  If all you are expecting is a good foot massage, Tom will probably be overkill. If you walked in with sore shoulders and back, Tom is the one you should seek out.

I am so satisfied with my first experience that I made an appointment to go back in 12 hours.  Now if that is not a ringing endorsement, I don't know what else would qualified.

Note: $15/hour grand opening special applies before midnight, after that it is $20/hour. Visa and MasterCard accepted, but American Express is not recognized ($1 per swipe surcharge).

Let me give you this little tip:

Do not attend a Vegas Strip Club with your brothers and/or male family members.  Under any circumstances.  No ifs, ands or butts.  Just don't.  Seriously.

It's awkward.  And upsetting.  And awkward.  

Little did I know that while my cousin Lauren and I watched our respective brothers get lapfucked by a pretty pair named Pilot and Perfect, that our benefactor had already paid for us to get our own laps snizzed on by Mercedes, a tight little tan blonde.

She sauntered over, asked the boys of the group that weren't busy getting jacked in a backroom somewhere to buy her a redbull (redbull is stripper cryptonite) and then sorta draped over us...

And that's when we both got felt up. 

Mercedes:  You guys both have really big boobs!

Rachel and Lauren: ...

*Stripper grabs our boobs*

Mercedes:  Are they real?

Rachel and Lauren:  *nod simultaneously* 

: |

Mercedes:  Mine are fake.

Rachel and Lauren:  *shock and awe* You don't say?

*Rachel and Lauren get the hell out of Spearmint Rhino*

Getting felt up without dinner or even a drink purchased for me beforehand felt wrong, but watching my brother enjoy a lap dance a little too much was enough to hurtle my nice seafood dinner out of the depths of innerspace onto the floor.

I'll give it up for the strippers super soft skin, though.  It's nice.  And they smell good too.  Lauren and I are thinking about creating a perfume called "Stripper".  It will be a blend of cucumber melon and coconut nectar with glitter.  Lots of glitter.

Oh, and they have pretty nice fake boobs. 

If you like that sort of thing.

We were in Vegas this past weekend and decided to check out Sushi Samba.  We did the tasting "omakase" menu and it was a hit with everyone on the table.  We got a nice sampling of everything there, it was all superb.  My favorite were the yellowtail tacos, yumm!  Most of all, we had a really great waitress, unfortunately i can't remember her name but she was very well informed and on top of it and she's the reason i'm giving this place 5 stars.

I like Duck, roasted and with some plum sauce on the side. I'm not so excited about Duck & Decanter. It's just okay for me, 2 1/2 stars if I had that option since I'm only interested in lunch and not their wine or any of the fancy foodstuffs that they carry. The best attribute about this place is the outdoor seating while being surrounded by some large trees.

For starters, there's a funky smell going on when you first walk into the place. I think the sandwiches are weak. You can look at a picture of my Reuben Sandwich with the toasted burnt bread and judge for yourself. To me, it looks like a number eight hitter's batting average, weak. I've had a decent salad in the past as well. 

This place has definitely not made the cut on to my regular lunch rotation.

Completely and utterly RIDICULOUS.

We came here for - surprise, surprise - a bachelorette party, but in stark contrast to the other partygoers, we were completely sober.  

Which ensured that I can reiterate with absolute confidence: completely and utterly RIDICULOUS.

The show started with a very loud montage of shows that these guys have been on - the View, Oprah, Jennifer Love Hewitt talking *about* them on Jay Leno.  It was essentially an extended commercial for something that we were already there for.  Then the guys came out and did a group dance that looked more like an aerobics routine than the HAWTEST ALL-MALE REVUE IN THE WORLD.  

This is how it went:

1.  Group dance: aerobics, aerobics, aerobics...FLASH CHEST! (crowd screams)...aerobics, aerobics, aerobics...FLASH ABS! (crowd screams)...aerobics, aerobics, aerobics...FLASH CHEST AGAIN! (crowd screams).  Guys go amongst the crowd (crowd screams).

2.  Individual dance: guy comes out, does aerobics, comes out into the crowd to find a cute veiled bachelorette to join him onstage.  Said bachelorette accepts lapdance, fondles chest and ass, gets a hug, and goes back to her seat.  Dancer does more aerobics then returns backstage.

Repeat steps 1 and 2 ad nauseum, then end show with step 1 again.

We were hoping for a lot of ass, maybe a glimpse of the package, but all we got was a lot of aerobics performed by men with too many clothes on.  Seriously, when they took off a pair of pants, (SURPRISE!) there was ANOTHER pair of pants on underneath.  When they took off the boxer briefs, (SURPRISE!) there was a g string on underneath.  They would have lasted freaking forever in a game of strip poker.  

I'm giving them an extra star for the sheer amusement they gave me (I laughed A LOT during this show), and because one of the guys shook my hand at the end.  Oh, and for all the Guns 'N Roses and Bon Jovi.  But really, why do women have to sit through all this crap when female strippers get right to the point and go straight for the pole?  

Hey Mick Dundee, dispose of the cheese and just show me your damn goods.

Just moved into the area and went to this location. It was so busy but staff was very helpful as I'm not used to this store and couldn't find the things I usually get. One time I went to another store and there was a demo of waffles with pomegranate seeds and yoghurt on it.  At this store there was a  sample with Belgian waffles, strawberries, and whipped cream...delicious!  So I bought the waffles and they were so cheap! I also love their Mediterranean feast meal. They have so many different items and prices are very reasonable. I find that I go to Trader Joe's a lot because of the variety of products and the atmosphere. I highly recommend Trader Joe's.

Its raining Sugar up in He A!

Seriously this place is a sugar addicts dream shop.  Everything here is sweet and sugary.  Came here to redeem one of the My Vegas coupons.  I felt high on sugar the whole time I was in there and I didn't even have any candy.  I picked up some chocolate rocks, malt balls, chocolate covered pretzel and green cotton candy! 

Since I don't have a sweet tooth these were all brought into the office to be shared. 

Eyes ~ So many candies and sweetst!
Nose ~ Smells sweet!.
Ear ~ Enjoying the music they have playing.
Mouth ~ Chocolate rocks taste yum!.
Tummy ~ Must not eat too much!

Just used them to move from Ahwatukee to Central Phoenix and these guys were outstanding! I've moved 5 times in the Phoenix area and each move has had problems. One time the movers didn't bring enough wardrobes. I didn't have any problems with Creative. Jesse and Eric were terrific! They were very fast and professional. I had to store my stuff for a week because my new place wasn't ready and Conrad (the owner) quoted me a fair price. They are the best and deserve all the great reviews. I have no complaints about this moving company and highly recommend them. One thing I appreciated was fact Conrad always answered my emails and was in constant contact with me about the move. It relieves a lot of stress when you have a professional mover. I called a lot of movers but based my decision on Yelp. I always use Yelp to find local businesses.

Remember the movie Brokedown Palace with Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale? And all of the Thai people were so mean to them. 

Oh. It has nothing to do with this review. I was just asking if you remembered that movie. Anyway, you won't find mean Thai people here. It's definitely a team  effort here and everyone was very helpful and most friendly. 

Seating is rather awkward as their isn't any signage indicating what to do, wait or sit. Or order inside. But I was quickly invited to sit wherever. Before I knew it a cold, crisp, simple salad and a menu was place in front of me. Yay! Free salad. The dressing was SO good. I bet Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes didn't get free salad. Course they were too busy being pistol whipped by the prison guards. 

Anyhoo...I ordered the pad thai and it was fantastic. Though I would have loved more tofu. It came with the cutest little spring and a wedge of cold watermelon. YUM! Love watermelon as it so refreshing. 

All this for around eight bucks. I bet you Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes...oh...never mind. Just get your butt to Thai Basil. Where you will be greeted warmly, served efficiently and probably, won't get pistol whipped by a lesbian Thai prison guard.

It's BRITNEY, B*TCH!!!!

Fabulous show!!!  Lights, theatrics, vivid sets, striking costumes, outrageous dance performances, smooth song transitions ... It was a very entertaining show!  Her songs alone will get you off your feet to dance, dance, dance ... So I didn't mind standing 95% of the 90-minute show.  You could sit but you wouldn't be able to see since everyone was standing and dancing, which makes for a high energy, fun show.

We all have heard it time and time again, she lip syncs her shows ... SO WHAT!!!  She's not Adele or any high caliber vocalist!!  I'm sure they're not jumping and flying all over the stage at their concerts, it's impossible to dance and sing perfectly!  So prerecorded?  I don't care!!  She's an awesome performer with beat-thrilling, ass-shaking songs!  

Btw: Sorry that douche cheated on you, Brit.  Good job dropping his @ss!!!  Demand to be cherished and nothing less!!!   You looked great, post popping out 2 kids!  Keep it up, girlie!!!

*This review is dedicated to Brandon C. for reviewing Brit's boutique http://www.yelp.com/biz/britney-spears-boutique-las-vegas?hrid=XPYdszVwVxkPiTZ2qqrLPA.  Now go watch the show!!!!  lol!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 40/100

Quite a pleasure to see while visiting Vegas! There is a huge lake in front of the Bellagio hotel, which is where the water fountain show takes place every 15-30 minutes. My boyfriend and I recently watched it this past weekend and it was wonderful! The particular show we watched was played along to the song, "All That Jazz." 

As much as I loved watching these fountains, I still think that I wasn't as impressed as I could have been. I've watched World Of Color at California Adventure in Anaheim, CA, and I think that World Of Color is MUCH more impressive than the Fountains of Bellagio. Don't get me wrong, the Bellagio fountains are great and definitely the landmark on the strip, BUT they aren't the best I've ever seen.

Psst...over here, pal. Youz like da slices do youz? Well, here's a little secret just between youz and me pal ... Down a non-descript hallway lined with album covers in the Cosmopolitan Hotel youz can find Secret Pizza. 

No matter how much you lose in Vegas, save $5 for some 5-star pizza. Shanon Y. was right about the White Sauce Cheese Pizza. It's a pizzagasm in your mouth of grease, cheese, and crust. 

There is only enough room for a few places to stand and eat at Secret Pizza ... Lots of families and groups were buying whole pies and chowing down in the hallways and lounge areas. It has no sign. It has no name, but the secret is out about Secret Pizza.

Great burgers. My friends and I love this place and it is a rule that every Vegas trip ends with a meal here before finally manage to drag ourselves back to the airport. Last time we went, when it was my buddies turn to order, we looked at him and he was passed out, his head resting on the table....so one of these stars is definitely for comfort.

Are you kidding me?  Seriously.

If you like less than mediocre food while porn is being thrown in your face, you'll find it here.  Seriously.

We never would have gone in here if we had any idea.  Seriously.

Corporate Suits in town wanted to take a few folks from my office to lunch and chose this place.  There's an hour of my life I'll never get back.  Seriously.

This place makes Hooters look very upscale and classy.  Seriously.  

And the food.  Huge burgers and fries are the only choices.  The burgers?  Think Encore Frozen Salisbury Steaks on a bun.  Seriously.

We left with the unanimous agreement that none of us would ever see the inside of this place again.  

Seriously.

I would give them negative stars if it was possible! One star is WAY TO GRACIOUS! HAD A HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE WITH TIVEGAS! 

Upon coming back to our room after a wedding last night we found a disturbing man leaving OUR ROOM with a bag full of all our valuables!!! After confronting him, the crazed man grabbed my husband by the throat and ran through the SERVICE ELEVATOR ROOM, using the SERVICE ELEVATOR to escape! Those elevators have to have keys and the hotel receptionist said she has worked there 9 years and doesn't know how to work those elevators!! SKETCHY!!! 

On top of the terror, security was sluggish and ON OUR FLOOR witnessing the attack and did NOT RUN, they walked, strolled even, over to us allowing the man to escape and offering only to write a report "IF WE WANTED TO". Security then proceeded to try to persuade us to NOT FILE A POLICE REPORT!!! SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS SECURITY SYSTEM?! Isn't safety supposed to be the most important??? I don't think TI Vegas has that priority AT ALL. 

And to ice this cake of a stay, TI VEGAS Risk Management NEVER filed a note or report to hotel staff/management to inform them of the breach of safety, as well as REFUSED to compensate for the room for our stay. UNREAL, never ever coming back and you are all warned!

I came here to celebrate my nephews 3rd birthday. The park is nestled in a neighborhood of houses. Since the park is dog friendly, I brought my dog, Brownie along for the party. I walked her on a trail that went around the park as well took her over to the large grassy area the park has to interact with the other dogs there. The grassy area isn't fenced in, so I was surprised at how many pet owners had their dogs off leashes, tsk tsk. The bathroom is large and has entry on either side of the building for males and females. They have an area where the kiddos can get wet, but unfortunately the day we were there the wind was blowing and it was cold, so most of the kids played at the playground. The playground is nice even though the swings were roped off for repair and I am a girl who loves to swing so that was a bummer! The park was clean and the area that was reserved for the party was spacious enough with a shade structure and the nearby bathrooms, BBQ grill and trash cans were convenient. They also have a small skate park too, but I didn't make it over to check it out fully. The water fountains were clean and lights came on in the park after a certain hour and lit everything up fine. All in all a decent neighborhood park.

I think my friends secretly hate me...I'll give the good, the drinks are pretty damn good. Some really nice eye candy.

The bad why is it so sticky??? I'm hoping spilled drinks and not body fluids......I understand college bar but ladies have some class as much as I love the hot outfits seriously pick a person not 8. I did actually buy 2 guys drinks for having the dirtiest pick up lines. I agree on other reviews if your're looking for a STD, maybe roofied this is the club for you.

Sorry to ruin the party concerning the high Yelp rating for this company, but this is my story. 

I called these guys and we agreed that they would come over to my house at 4pm for a regular service call. So I took off some time from the office to meet them at my house. I called them at 4:10pm and asked them what was going on, I had to leave a message. After a few minutes, they called me back and said they didn't have a technician near my house since they were in other parts of the valley so we would have to reschedule. WTF?

I rescheduled for the next week and while they called me about 15 minutes before the scheduled appointment, I told them that I was in another part of the valley and couldn't make the appointment. I then continued with my awesome lunch.

1300+ reviews don't lie. This place is quite delicious. 

Why the one star? Because I ate here on Tuesday 4/23 and started having food poisoning symptoms two days later. It's been five days and I'm still in pain and have lost 13 pounds due to so much water loss. I had to visit the ER yesterday for dehydration. After multiple complaints from other patrons, Firefly was shut down today for a health inspection. 

However, this is not the first time I became ill after eating here. A couple years ago, I had their fish sticks and started violently vomiting soon after. After some time, I decided to give this place another chance. Everything was good...until now. 

It's such a shame because Firefly has delicious tapas and drinks. This was my go-to place for a long time. But apparently staff members aren't keeping clean and washing their hands or they're not handling their food properly.

I've already given this place a second chance. A third chance? I highly doubt it. Eat here at your own risk.

"....and I think to myself, what a wonderful world." - "What a Wonderful World",- Louie Armstrong

Great show by a talented performer!

I watched the beginning of Terry Fator's meteoric rise to Las Vegas headliner on America's Got Talent several years ago.  To describe Terry - he is a singing impressionist ventriloquist comedian.  He does spot-on impersonations & sings better via ventriloquism than others do through their own accord.  It was w/ great anticipation that I finally caught his Vegas show in his very own theatre.

To be frank, this show may be not be everyone's cup of tea.  He is, after all, using puppets.  However, I'm a big fan!  His impressions of past & present performers, such as Cher, Dean Martin, Stevie Wonder & Adele are brilliant.  His comedy sketches are witty & current.  I thought it may have became a little edgy for some w/ one of his puppets "coming out the closet", but I thought it was hilarious.

Terry also sings a few original songs sans puppets during the show.  One entitled "Horses in Heaven" & the other a tribute to the troops.  "Horses in Heaven" is based on a true story of a child w/ cancer.  He mentioned to the audience that the Las Vegas powers that be thought  the song was too heavy & not appropriate for a Vegas show during it's development.  He defied the powers that be, and I enjoyed the song, which made me think of my own experience w/ cancer.  

Our show just happened to be the very one that surpassed 1 million guests to see Terry Fator's Vegas show.  Even better, everyone in attendance received a Terry Fator reusable bag w/ the following contents-

Terry Fator playing cards
2 for 1 at Mirage's Cravings buffet
$10 Free Slot Play w/ the Mirage Player's Card

I took that $10 Free Slot Play & magically turned it into $66 on a $1 slot machine!  Oh yeah, I'm good :)
It was my last night in Vegas, and capped an already great trip.

I highly recommend catching Terry Fator's show at the Mirage during your next trip to Vegas.  I laughed, I was moved & I had an absolute great time.

Excelsior!

Let me start this Yelp by saying I've never given the business to a stripper. Are we clear? Ok.

I'll tell you why this place gets five stars... Because not one but two of the dancers offered to go home with me. 

One for $250. She said "If you have $250, we can go somewhere together." And then she licked my ear and showed me her guns. Her shift was over and she was in street clothes, mind you.

So guess what happened next? 

Stripper two (who actually did leave with me - long story) said, "Gross, some skanky girl licked you and her breath was terrible." I was embarrassed, yet psychologically removed from that experience.

What happened with Stripper two is a great story but I don't know that I want to share it here. But if you go to this club, one piece of advice (Useful alert!): the less attractive dancers require money to leave with you. The self-possessed hotter ones do not. However, if you get her naked in your bed, do no verify pre-coitus that she is not, in fact, a prostitute, because she will leave and call you names as your front door slams behind her. Or so my buddy tells me. Such trifling arrows of human amusement are not found in this man's quiver of irresponsible behavior.

From Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich comes an authentic, contemporary Italian restaurant.  It's good! 

This is not your "we import everything from Italy so we are an Italian restaurant", nor is it "I use my mamma's recipes and she was Italian so this is authentic".  B&B creates classic Italian flavors using what is available seasonally, in the area.  From fresh herbs and produce to house cured salumi, it all goes into creating outstanding authentic food.

Antipasti features a simple but perfect braised tripe alla Romana.  Tender, with no off smell.  Vibrant acidity from the tomatoes add a nice foil to the mildly flavored tripe.  Perfect.  The grilled octopus, heaven.  Toothsome with a charred bitter edge that contrast well with the sweet, spicy, sour limoncello vinaigrette.  The lemony perfume is heady.  Sensory overload on a single plate.

Prima focuses around perfectly cooked, authentic pastas.  The bucatini all'Amatriciana is near Roman perfect.  Fatty, porky goodness of guanchale, bright acidity from pured tomatoes, a zing of acidity from some wine, lightly spiced and finished with pecorino cheese.  If that's too simple, the bone marrow ravioli is to die for.  Rich unctuous goodness surrounded by thin pasta bathed in a veal shank ragu that must have simmered all day.

Secondi proteins are different (lamb, rabbit, quail).  Experiment.  The deep fried sweetbreads, Win.   Crisp on the outside, pillowy on the inside; they pair perfectly with the sweet sour balsamic glazed cippolinis and the sweet bitterness of charred corn.  Don't think about what you're eating and you should be OK.

Massive Italian centric wine list representing DOC / DOCG throughout the country.  Good vintage depth for super Tuscans.  Vegas resort prices.

True Italian service, friendly with great pride taken in what they do.

OMG DD! OMG! I'm eating my roast beef sandwich now, typing this review and pounding my hands on the table like Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally...moaning, groaning and achieving culinary orgasms. 

Now that's a pretty picture for ya!

House roasted roast beef with a blue cheese horseradish spread, red onion, tomato and my favorite green next to Brian Austin Green...arugula! All served on a yummy artisan roll. 

Such a cute place with a case FULL of delicious looking temptations from crab cakes to mashed sweet potatoes to chocolates and cheeses and VINO!! Great staff...friendly and helpful. Why I'm even a proud card carrying member of their sandwich club. And I'm sure it won't take me long to earn that free heavenly sandwich!

The newest kid on the strip is still the sexiest!

Yup, as soon as you walk into the lobby, you are invited in with the allure of large glass columns with ever changing themes. Chic mirrors and chandeliers dripping with crystals from the ceiling and everything around you just seems to sparkle with a sleek, sexy flare that is all Vegas. 

I checked in for the July 4th weekend and got up sold by a very aggressive front desk clerk that insisted on getting me into the penthouse.  I settled for a 910sq. ft. angle suite on the 58th floor with additional Japanese soaking tub, terrace with a view of the Bellagio fountains, kitchenette with fridge & microwave and an additional full sized bath with shower. Not too shabby.   

The room I must say was very spacious, the view off the expansive terrace was breathtaking and i used the soaking tub practically every night after the clubs so it worked out great!

My only complaint was with housekeeping.  There's a circular red paper note you're supposed to leave on the bed to have your linens changed, which i did but every night i came back to the room, my sheets were done but not changed! It was ridonkulous! Even the dirty pillow that had some sketchy black skid mark smeared on it (that i never used from day one) remained in my room til the last day i was there....nuts!

Perhaps all the smoke and mirrors at the entrance lobby had me blinded by the hotel's sexy charm but with all due respect, my stay was very enjoyable and despite the minor flaws, I had a fantastic time... 

With that said, the hotel was conveniently located in the heart of the strip. It's steps away from the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood and Paris...and the Sahra Spa, brunch and pool were very enjoyable...and partying at the Marquee & Bond was priceless!


Happy Times!

There is a lot of hype about this place and although it is a good time, it is not very different than any of the other pool parties in Vegas, but with a lot more expense.

One piece of advice though, DO NOT OPEN A BAR TAB ESPECIALLY IN THE CABANA BOTTLE SERVICE AREA.  They will over charge you for drinks that you either did not order or that are different than the posted menu rates at the venue and shown on their website.  This is how the waitresses make their money.  Do not tip before you get the bill.  They will add it to your bill anyways and deny the cash you forked over earlier in the day. If you dispute the charges, they will threaten to arrest you with Vegas PD at the premises.  You do not need this kind of argument at the end of what you thought was an enjoyable day.  And the MGM will not get involved to help settle the dispute unless you charge your bill through your room.

Spread the word fellow Yelpers, its not worth the trouble or expense.

The Showroom is located at 951 Wigwam Pkwy Henderson, NV. That's just off of 215 and the Gibson exit. Its kinda hard to find if you're not paying attention.

The showroom is really well setup and they have rocks and more rocks. flagstone, stones, gravel, soils and just about any landscape design info you could need. Way better than big box stores as they're locally owned and know the desert landscape and the best options.

Plus you can go to their website and see lots of rock examples and measuring tech info. Also they have a sister company that is Nevada outdoor Living with BBQ island and equipment, higher end patio furniture, waterfalls, statues, fire pits and more.
 
Prices seem high on the patio items and BBQ options but they mostly high end quality stuff that costs a little more. We got a deal on a small set and were happy. The rock options for the yard are still in the making but the prices are right and they deliver.

Staff was friendly and very helpful.

You will get a bunch of good ideas for your landscape dreams. Go in and check it out.

Love the music.
Love the entertainer.
Didn't love the performance.

Michael Jackson One reminded me how much I love Michael Jackson music and also reminded me how much I miss the entertainer that he was.

This Cirque du Soleil show was still very good ... less because of the "story" or "acts" and more for the pure joy, inspiration, and energy hearing Michael Jackson songs brings. Actually the story of 4 misfits searching for the white glove, shoes, hat, and sunglasses of MJ was downright silly. I really didn't care for Shy or Clumsy (the other two are called Sneaky and Smarty Pants). Less of them and more of the music could of made Michael Jackson One a 5-star experience truly worthy of the $155/ticket (plus additional Ticketmaster fees).

A few highlights:

 * A hologram of Michael Jackson dancing to "Man in the Mirror" was like watching a cool movie of Michael up close. 

 * The "Bad" performance brings back memories of break dancing ...

 * "Billie Jean" features dancers in multicolored lit suits and acrobats around the theater.

 * "Thriller" filled with trampolines and zombies was ok.

 * More than once, the show shares messages of hope and equality ... especially during "They Don't Care About Us."

 * "Smooth Criminal" may of been my favorite ... because I love the song and the "lean"

Some of the songs were:

 - Beat It
 - Leave Me Alone
 - Bad
 - Smooth Criminal
 - I'll Be There
 - Human Nature
 - Jam
 - They Don't Care About Us
 - Earth Song
 - Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'
 - The Way You Make Me Feel
 - Dangerous
 - Dirty Diana
 - Workin' Day and Night
 - Billie Jean
 - Thriller
- I Just Can't Stop Loving You
 - Man in the Mirror
 - Can You Feel It
 - Black or White
 - Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough

Those are some memorable tunes ... Forget about all the distractions and story. 

      Go for your love of the music. 
      Go for your love of the entertainer. 
      Remember how much you miss Michael Jackson.

I've been to Erased three times now. Time for my review and I'll post some before and after pics. I echo previous reviews in the location being clean and nice. Erased uses the NaturaLase QS 2J laser which is state of the art. Contrary to popular belief, It doesn't hurt as bad as you would think. The technology has come a long way thankfully. I had a black tattoo removed many many years ago and that was full blown torture... and that was WITH numbing cream and I have a high pain tolerance. Couldn't imagine it without that cream... Geez! The doctor had to physically hold my foot down and it took everything within me to not kick that doctor in the face it hurt so bad! And you could smell your skin burning in the room. It was downright awful! I'm so appreciative of the fact that the tattoo removal experience is not like that anymore because to be honest, I don't know if I could do it again. Certain ink colors hurt worse than others and if the tattoo is near a bone or on a sensitive area, you might feel more pain but it's over so fast, it won't even phase you. If you could handle getting the tattoo in the first place, you can definitely handle the removal process so don't be a puss people! If you want to get it done, do it! And better yet, do it at Erased!

I'm saying goodbye to "the only tattoo that mom's like" (Tigger & Winnie the Pooh) along with a daisy with a peace sign in the middle on my butt and a daisy on my toe (the friendship tattoo curse). Sayonara to all these mistakes! I'm not regretting this decision one bit. I promise to post pics of my progress along the way for all to see.

We came here last evening to listen to that great voice which is Mandy Patinkin. Wow it was even better than we could have imagined.

His vocal range is incredible. He started with some old old Broadway tunes from the 40s and 50s. Then moves on and starts softly speaking these words without music:

Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see

So you say to yourself. No!  He's not going to sing it. And, he doesn't. He just leads into the middle of another old Broadway tune. So you think, what was that?  Well, it was a tease. 

He starts having a dialogue with the audience about his marriage and wife.  But then comes back to it. Now accompanied by Paul Ford on the piano. He sings the entire song. Bohemian Rhapsody. All the parts. Wow! Freddie Mercury would have been proud!

That's how the evening went. Interspacing old show tunes with some more recent melodies.  He sang a few from Steven Sondheim's "Sundays in the Park with George".  It was a show he was nominated for a Tony.  The best of the night, was his singing of Oh Shenandoah. What made it special was his stopping midway to recite the first part of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. He goes back to Oh Shenandoah, then finishes the second half of Gettysburg Address and the last verse of Oh Shenandoah. Absolutely beautiful.

Surprisingly no tunes from Evita. A show he won the Tony for his role of Che, and made famous with Patti Lepone.  He finished the evening with a tune from the movie Ragtime and the music of Randy Newman. 

There were two curtain calls. He and his pianist Paul Ford looked exhausted after a non-stop ninety minutes. We left feeling as if we had just enjoyed something special. This was our first time to the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts and we were very impressed.

Fat Heads makes some seriously fat/phat sandwiches.

I got a crazy good grease-wich when I came here in December. An artery clogger combination of egg, cheese, Linguia, thick bread, and other random elements of pure tastiness.

Each bite was worth the 10 dribbles of grease that would drip out onto my crumpled collection of napkins.

If you're in the area and looking for a fun rowdy place to watch a Steelers game with good food - def stop at Fat Heads. If you're looking for a "fill you up, can barely move once you're done" -  meal -  check out Fat Heads. If you're looking for a nice selection of unique beer brews - come to Fat Heads.  If you're looking for a casual place to catch up with friends - over a massive plate of nachos - go to Fat Heads  (though be prepared to wait awhile if it's game night.)

If you're looking for something light and some peace and quiet - - eh.....- you may want to head elsewhere.

Carrot Top elicits such a negative knee jerk reaction from so many.  It's like asking people at a pizza joint if they want anchovies.  When was the last time you actually had anchovies??  The guy has been a Vegas headliner since 2005.  There's got to be a reason why he's been able to stick it out on the strip and fill seats in that theater for the long haul while so many headline comedians have come and gone.  One year they're at the Excalibur, then The Plaza and then there's their one way ticket to Laughlin. 

I didn't think I would enjoy the show as much as I did.  He opened the show at a frenetic pace going from prop joke to prop joke.  Didn't think the joke was funny?  No problem!  There's another one in 5 seconds.  It was like watching the biggest 5 year old wise ass with A.D.D. show off his box of toys.  Freakin hilarious!!  The rest of the show was just as great.  You'll definitely laugh a lot and have a fun time unless you don't laugh at cock jokes.  So yeah....eunuchs may be sensitive to Carrot Top. 

We sat in the second to last row.  There's not a bad seat in the house.  You can purchase the cheapest seats without hesitation if you're still skeptical.

All I kept thinking about when I stepped into Zia Records was, like Wow... they've taken a 60's head shop and mixed it with a record store and POOF!  "Let's Do The Time Warp Again!"

The Zia chain is a used Record/ CD/ DVD/ Book/ Speaker shop that has incense burning to set the mood. I would imagine, though I didn't ask, that you could purchase rolling paper here too. So I began to wonder where are they hiding Bill and Ted as I walked around the store?  LOL

Don't get me wrong, I really like the concept and the prices seemed pretty good. If I was going off to college again, besides IKEA this would definitely make my list. This is a Geeks, Geek place. 

They have dorm posters and lots of cool toys from TV's past and present.  Everything from the robot from "Lost in Space"(photos), to a fairly large statues of Leonard Nimoy's Spock, both Matt Smith's and David Tennant's "Dr Who, as well as bendable toy figures from CBS's "Big Bang Theory". And yes, they have both Penny and Leonard. But let's not go there okay! LOL

So yes, I'm a Fan of Zia Records, and yes I'll be back. Now where did I leave my Tardis?  Beam me up Scott D!

I visited Al-Hana for the first time today for an Unofficial Yelp Event with Rand H., Robyn N., Mike C., Jackie C. and the other Jon H. I enjoyed some great Hummus and Pita Bread plus my main course of Lamb Kafta for $8.99 and a can of soda for $.099; this meal set me back $10.75 today.

Prior to arriving, I perused some reviews and the menu. Pro Tip - this place is not located in the ghetto as some reviewers have mentioned. I did not have to use any of my martial arts training to get into and out of the restaurant. There was decent parking at about 11:10 when I got there. 

As I'm writing this review 4 hours later, I can tell you that I'm still stuffed. I really enjoyed my food along with conversations with my awesome lunch companions. Thanks to Rand for "inviting" me. I probably would have not tried this place otherwise.

I'm a fan of Arby's because I enjoy their Reuben Sandwich and their Turkey Sandwich. It's a chill place with just the right A/C setting. I usually catch up on my reading during lunch so this place ticks all the right boxes in that regard.

My major gripe about this Arby's is in their haste to always upsell you they charge you more than what you order. I upgrade my drink size but it doesn't mean I want their gigantic curly fries. I finally had to read the riot act today and spell it out for them. Many years ago you would get a print out receipt of every item you ordered. These days you get the total you were charged on your credit card but you don't have any idea if you were charged correctly on each item.

So even though I still like you Arby's, I'm not ringing that bell.

Dare I say that I like Amore's deep dish pizza even better than the pizza I had in Chicago? No need to hop on a plane to go all the way to Gino's when we have Amore Taste of Chicago here in Vegas. My favorite thing about it... It's hard to narrow it down to only one so here's a few. Their sauce is so flavorful and made from real crushed tomatoes. The ingredients are extremely fresh. Their thick crunchy cornmeal crust is never oily. Every time I have ordered from here, my pizza has been perfectly cooked. 

I love this pizza! I'm just mad that I tried it because now I'm hooked and I'm going to get fat. When I become too out of shape and have to give up modeling because of this guys, I blame Amore! It's all their fault! Don't say I didn't warn you. ;)

It's what you'd expect in this corner of Charleston & Rampart. Homey atmosphere that gives you the feel of farm fresh to the table. Pretty decor that lets you know you are about to pay for it.
Ordered the much touted Biloxi buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. It was ok. Battered chicken breast with an overly generous slather of honey mustard atop cole slaw. Served alongside a small salad of edamame, kale, cheese, carrots, radishes, seeds with a light vinaigrette. A glamorized chicken sandwich that I don't think is worth $13.00.
The Tuna tartare was good, but as my daughter says, "it's pretty hard to mess up tuna tartare". A small portion and overpriced at $15.00.
Service was ok. This place seems to cater to a typical pretentious Summerlin crowd. Overall, nothing special and not worth the $40 lunch bill for 2 for an app and fried chicken sandwich with one soda.
Ho hum, tried it and won't be back.

HONEY TOAST!!!  Its plain and delish!  It had been 3 yrs since I last had one here and was eager to stuff my face with some yummy goodness.

But first we decided to get a little bit of good in the tummy.  It was 11pm when we got here so we tried to keep it light.

Wasabi Ika (squid) ~ it was fresh squid in a wasabi sauce garnished with pickled daikon.  It was very refreshing!

Agedashi tofu ~ I luv this dish and luv making it at home!

Ika butter ~ Sauteed squid in butter and onions.

Asparagus bacon and Gizzards (sunagimo) ~ Two yakitori that I often get when its available.

Okra Natto ~ 2 of my fave slimy food hell yeah!!!

Sake flight ~ From Ginjo, Junmai, Daiginjo all were pretty good tasting. 

Honey Toast ~ Hmm what can I say...... Its damn good so you have to try it.  Toast, Honey and Ice Cream!  Yum Yum!

This place is way off the strip but worth going to to.  Its open late so you can get some good grub here!  I still like the izakaya in my hood but this place is a good spot in sin city!

Eyes ~ My eyes are on the Honey toast!
Nose ~ I smell yummyness!
Ear ~ Its a late night but still pretty busy and lively!
Mouth ~ Everything is tasty but I want some honey!
Tummy ~ Ahhh finally some honey toast!

Ladiessssssss....hold tight to those purses!

If you're a woman standing on the dance floor with a purse, you're a target. There's some kind of crime ring happening that can ruin an entire Vegas trip if they get their hands on too many personal items. They appear to be pick pocketing cell phones and if they can wiggle a wallet out while they're at it, game on. A handful of girls in our group noticed their cell phones were missing about an hour into the night and once those of us that still had ours started flashing the ground to see if we could find them, ladies dancing around us jumped in announcing that their cell phones had been swiped, too.

Sadly Hakkasan's security guys couldn't do anything about it, because their job is to keep the fire lanes clear and keep bottle service VIPs away from the commoners. It's a shame because if they had just put a few more security guards on the dance floor after the many complaints we sent their way about the situation, some people could have been safe from the thievery.

Losing your phone or ID on a Vegas weekend is probably one of the worst scenarios you can think of because your whole life is put on hold and you have to jump through hoops (while on vacation) to get everything back in order.

Props to securing kick ass DJs and the unlimited confetti budget, but there's a serious issue taking place under Hakkasan's roof that needs to be addressed. And fast.

Man, oh man. You've got game if you shop here. If I were a guy, I would buy my entire wardrobe from Stitched. A combination of classic and contemporary, suiting and street - this is how a man with swag dresses!

The store itself is the ultimate man cave. There's a billiard table in the back, flat screen tvs on ESPN and even a whisky lounge with Macallan scotch lockers to rent. There are also several cool choppers worked into the decor. There's an on-site tailor stitching up sharp suits too, personalized with your name if you'd like. Probably the only thing missing is a cigar bar and hot female cocktail servers.

Price points are really reasonable. A lot of the coats and blazers that I liked were around $250. You'll find ready to wear brands like George Esquivel, Jacks & Jokers, Rag & Bone, Cr8tive Recreation, Louis Stewart and Psycho Bunny.

And girls, the sharp looking men that work here make the visit worthwhile too.

Move. the. hell. over, Earl of Sandwich. I found a new late-night lover and it's NY style pizza in Vegas. 

My girlfriend raved about this place, while I rolled my eyes and insisted we go to Earl instead. She convinced me and we walked on over after a long night at the Marquee (both conveniently located in the Cosmo) and we were all speechless after our first bite. 

We ordered a combo of white cheese, sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms. I've never been a HUGE fan of pizza, but this thin, wide slice was simple and flawless.

Do you remember when Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael (TMNT) ended their adventure by tearing down a slice of ooey gooey cheese pizza?

Caribbean, mon!
Some water in the desert.
Get the chili dog!

Dillon's is a chain down in Arizona.  BBQ is their specialty.  Kind of like the Famous Dave's of the Southwest.  Have been to the Glendale location in the past.  Solid.  This place brings it to another level.  Situated on Lake Pleasant, just outside of old timers land in NW Phoenix burbs. 

They have a vernicular to get you down to the Lake? How cool is that? I am sure that I will appreciate that in my later ages when I retire down there in my golden years.  Look at the old guy getting busy!:

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dillons-morristown?select=wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqA#wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqA

Anyways, their chili dog is out of this world.  See my picture.  Comes on a hamburger bun with two sliced dogs, topped with cheese and jalapenos and BBQ pulled pork.  Just died and went to heaven.  Gives the Gopher Bar a run for its money. 4.99999!

Is a trip to Vegas ever complete without a visit to a Cirque du Soleil show?  I think not.

Whats a trip to Vegas without seeing some naked girls swimming and writhing in a giant human-sized fish bowl filled with water?

                                '---------'

I saw the fishbowl and I knew right away I was in.  
They hypnotize you 
They seduce you, every act more titillating than the next
They make you sell your soul to the man next to you
You forget everything
You wake up and the next moment you're sitting in a vat of writhing bodies
Will you obey?

I'm sore.  I guess that means I did.

PS- If you're looking for a conservative show, this probably isn't for you and your family.  But the crude humor, the scantily clad muscled men (wrap him up i'll take him to go) and barely there women.  This was definitely my kinda show.  Crazy moves, random stunts, perverted jokes...This was definitely perfect for me.

Don't get seats in the front rows if you don't want to be called on.  :)

When you're far from home, the minute you see a familiar face out in that huge sea of people, you instantly smile. That's how I feel everytime I see the Hawaiian Air Las Vegas ohana... They have that island style spirit that our Hawaii is so famous for. You can tell that they miss home too, in the islands and for them, like us, it's nice to see familiar faces. Hawaiian Airlines has always been my go to carrier when traveling to the west coast and Vegas. They've since moved operations from the old International terminal and now operate out of the new Terminal 3, D concourse. Access by a high speed tram is so easy. The new digs also offer us travelers access to new shops, concessions and yes, slot machines! But getting back to our Hawaiian ohana, it helps to have friendly staff with the Aloha spirit since a lot of times we as travelers need assistance at the gates, etc. I have never felt guilty of like I was bothering any of them whenever I had a question or concern about something. Traveling can be intimidating for some, confusing to others and just downright unpleasant. It sure helps when you have a friendly face to talk to at the beginning of a long journey home and a smile. That alone will cure your anxieties! Keep up the good work Hawaiian!

Oh, and btw, be sure to download the Hawaiian Air app if you have a smartphone, it's so convenient and easy to use. Check in, change seats, upgrade, do it all from the app! You'll never be scrambling to find a computer anymore!

A great place for a great  happy hour!

I love how they start early, at 2PM goes to 6PM. They have beers for $5, wine and cocktails for $7. I'm not a fan of mojitos, but their Poolside Cruzan Mojito is really good! It's so much more refreshing than any mojitos I've ever had!

Their bar bites are $5-$9. They have a lot of interesting things like Po-Boy sliders, crawfish fritters, and ahi tuna tacos, but I didn't have any of that. I had their $1.50 oysters instead. It was so fresh like they just got their oysters from the ocean that day!

My husband was so in love with their oysters that we decided to come back before our flight back to San Jose. He said they were some of the best he ever had. With suitcases in hand, we practically ran here. We were 3 minutes late for happy hour and the hostesses insisted that happy hour was over. That was fair and that was fine, but I was a bit irritated when one of them said, "We already have a long happy hour." At least she forced a smile on her snobby face when she said that.

"Le Reve: A small collection of imperfect dreams" was a perfect dream for me, Jessica and Nicole during our first night in Vegas. It was a spectacular aquatic-acrobatic performance that took our breaths away. We had the pleasure of being treated to tickets to the show by Nicole's amazing cousin, who had seen Le Reve 7 times before. If he'd seen it 7 times, we were certain the show would be phenomenal. Indeed it was.

As we arrived at the theater inside Wynn, I was really surprised to see what an intimate venue it was, and with the round aqua stage set in the center, there was no bad seat in the house. The first row was incredibly close to the 1 million gallon pool, but although the guests sitting there had a fantastic view, they were at risk of being splashed throughout the performance. Those sitting in the VIP section had monitors screening backstage/underwater footage during the show, which is really cool.

I won't reveal too much about the show (you'll have to go see it for yourself!), only that the sets were really amazing, and it's easy to see how the show is one of the most expensive ever produced. I could also see how many would mistaken this as being a Cirque du Soleil show, because the creator was the former creative director at Cirque - as the creative dramatic & comedic storyline, haunting music score, intricate choreography, and incredibly talented performers with beautifully sculpted bodies are all indicative of Cirque shows. Unfortunately, I've never seen "O," but I hear that they are both wonderful in their own ways. 

I thought the length of the show was just right, and there was never a dull moment. I mean, how could there be? This is, after all, Vegas, baby!!

Located on Las Vegas Blvd near Charleston. In the grungy area so usually do it in the day and it's not good for big parties as the dining room is really small.

This is a follow up review and I Love this place. 

But I'm not over selling it and dont expect a fancy looking decor and designer napkins - it's not gonna happen. The waitress and t.v. are set for spanish...cuban style so be ready.

Lunch pollo criollo , black beans, avacado salad and iron beer.  All we're bangin my drums and made it a better day :)

Fast service  and like eating at a relatives and all really good.

I was scheduled to fly to Las Vegas on January 5, 2014, however, my Newark Delta flight via Detroit was cancelled due to the weather. The earliest flight I could get to Vegas was two days later from JFK on January 7. My original hotel stay was at the Planet Hollywood, but, because my arrival was delayed I had to find an alternative hotel.

I found the Quad, which was the former Imperial Palace on the strip. I never stayed here but, as a Total Rewards member their last minute room pricing was the most reasonable so I reserved a room. Big mistake.

When I arrived I found the taxi had to drop me off at the rear of the hotel due to the hotel construction still going on. I noticed a lot of young people checking into the Quad I guess due to the low room cost. My check-in was smooth. As you can see from my room pics, my room was ok, which was fine. 

My only complaint about this hotel is the construction going on in and around the hotel. Some areas of the hotel are still well worn. The hotel location is fine between Harrah's and across the street from Ceasar's Palace.

See the pics of my TR1724 room, which I paid $136 for the first night and $169 for the second night in early January 2014.

I would probably not return here. I much prefer Planet Hollywood or any of the other strip hotels, which do cost a little more.

This Swiss bakery has been my go-to spot for cakes and macarons. I first noticed this bakery on Yelp, and the owner makes everything from scratch with natural ingredients. Foot traffic is rare, and the interior encompasses large glass cases, tiled floor, and colorful chocolates and European pastries to fill out the dcor.

The quarter sheet Custard Cake ($29.98) came with soft spongy cake, custard, and airy textures with moderate sweetness. My friends raved about its light-tasting qualities and I really enjoyed it too. The website says the cake can feed 15-20 people, but I always have leftovers to share with others.

The quarter sheet Tiramisu ($29.98) came with good moisture and mascarpone flavor, but the consistency of the custard needed to be more refined. The overall flavor was borderline bland, and without rum this cake could use another anchor such as an aromatic coffee to render that special effect. It was a solid cake, but I have had better.

I absolutely loved their Macarons ($1.50). It all started with a crisp airy texture, followed by a soft chew and persistent flagrant ganache at the center. I have tried the Red Velvet, Pistachio, Chocolate Orange, Pumpkin Pie, Almond, Blueberry, and Coconut flavors. They were all striking, memorable, and the fruit flavors were particularly delectable. The textures and flavors on these Macarons were consistent on each of my previous visits. It never fails.

Each time the service was forward, efficient, and responsive. I find it helpful to communicate directly with the owner, as he is knowledgeable and always finds ways to meet my expectations. Eventually I'd like to order off the menu and try the Saint Honore Cake, Poppy Seed Bread, and other Macaron flavors.

SLS = STAY THE F*CK AWAY

What, the acronym doesn't match? Well, it doesn't f*cking matter, because you should avoid this place like the f*cking plague.

Here is a (too long) list of things that went wrong during our less-than-48-hours stay:

1. The elevator in the attached parking structure broke down TWICE for extended periods of time.

2. LiFE Nightclub didn't let anyone in until about 11:30 Friday night despite a HUGE line outside because of an isolated power outage.

3. THERE WAS NO HOT WATER FOR AT LEAST 6 HOURS ON ONE OF THE NIGHTS. THIS IS THE MIDDLE OF F*CKING VEGAS WINTER AND YOU HAVE NO HOT WATER?! SERIOUSLY?!

4. Despite all of the above, it still took me and my dad hours of bitch-mayhem at the front desk to get our ridiculous $28/night resort fee waived.

5. Housekeeping was EXTREMELY cheap. Used up toiletries were NOT replaced the second day.

I would give this place zero stars if Yelp allowed it. But since I'm forced to give it at least one star, I will say that the hotel rooms do have cool illuminated infinity mirrors. But that's it.

Where other companies implode old hotels and rebuild something new and magnificent, SBE only slightly remodeled the old Sahara.

NEVER AGAIN.

I vividly remember my first bite of their red velvet cupcake 8 years ago at their Beverly Hills location.  I'd never had cupcake like that before or since.  There have been copycats sneaking their way into Las Vegas over the years with mixed results and never living up to Sprinkles for me.  They finally made it and I am psyched!  

Yeah so 6 cupcakes costs $22.50.  I was surprised when the cashier asked me if those were for here or to go but then I saw a guy with 6 of them at a table by himself.  Damn, dude.

We ordered 3 red velvet, a peanut butter chip, lemon meringue and black & white.  Those other 3 were nice and all but it's all about the red velvet.  The cake was perfectly moist and the frosting is like no other.  Funny how they put the takeout box into a resealable plastic bag...like drugs.  I am sure Sprinkles is well aware of their addictive qualities.

Even the line on Sunday at 11pm was about 15 minutes.  Looking forward to giving the cupcake ATM a whirl when the line is an hour plus.

For my 800th review I chose my alma mater, UNLV.  It's been a while since I've graduated from this University.  However, I've had many interns from the school work for me and have hired many graduates over the years.  I also attend a lot of events at the school and remain very close with Alumni.  Here's my breakdown of the school:

PROS

- It's very cheap.  Even though tuition is going up, it's still less than many other State schools.

- Much of the campus has new buildings.  When I go on campus now, it feels like a strange place and I get lost all of the time because its 3x larger than it was when I attended.

- Great professors.  I can only speak about the College of Hotel Administration and the Business School.....the professors were awesome.  I learned so much from them.  Learning is a 2 way street, it's up to you to get as much out of it as you can.  It's not on the professors to make the class how you like it, you have to adjust to their teaching style and learn as much as possible.  To this day I remain in contact with many former professors.

- Nice campus.  By Vegas standards there's a lot of greenery around campus, which is a refreshing change of scenery.

- Library.  One of the best libraries in town is located on the UNLV campus.

- Basketball team.  The UNLV Runnin' Rebels have always been the favorite team in the city.  We've had some good years recently.  Hopefully we'll continue to build upon it and improve as time goes on.

CONS

- Minuscule Endowment Fund.  One of the main reasons UNLV is having a difficult time surviving in this economy is not only because of state cutbacks but also because the endowment is very tiny.  The school needs more support from the private sector.

- Visitor parking.  Student parking has improved dramatically since the time I was a student.....however, visitor parking is a nightmare.  I dread parking every time I go on campus.

Overall, I have fond memories of UNLV.  My experience here has helped me with my career and I've established many lifelong friendships over the years.  I would be proud to send my Son to this school.

Return Factor - 100%

"We don't fit in" says my poker bud.

"What are you talking about" I say.

"Look around, everyone in here is Asian" he whispers.

"And what are we?" I answer dumbfounded.

"No, I mean they are like Wong Fu Asian.  You know, guys in skinny jeans carrying around stuffed animals for girls who weigh 90 pounds or less and take pics with whisker fingers" he continues.

Laughing uncontrollably "Shut up and eat your menu".

Sweet Raku is about hand crafted, refined, JAPANESE desserts; delicate flavors and natural, subtle sweetness.  This is not the diabetic sugary desserts most Americans are familiar with.  A fresh fruit would have the same amount of sweetness as their offerings.

Tip: Opt for the three course tasting.  Widest selection and best value.

Standout examples:

Mt. Fuji - A neutral chestnut sponge cake topped with lightly candied chestnuts robbed in ribbons of airy chestnut cream.  An ode to the chestnut.

Ringo - Modern take on the apple pie.  Barely sweetened apples sandwiched between flaky, slightly salty crust atop white chocolate.  A blown sugar apple filled with cream and an aromatic, slightly bitter sweet honey ice cream, all dusted with powder sugar finish the plate.  

Good selection of coffee and tea drinks.  Well chosen wine list.  Great off Strip prices.

And yes, the menu was delicious.

My only complaint about Short Leash is that they don't follow me around town in the food cart, which means I cannot eat delicious hot dog concoctions all day! How unfair is that?!?

Well, Amber... we all know you are a VEGAN, so why do you want to be followed around by a hot dog cart? 

Well, Reader... Short Leash has VEGGIE DOGS! That is right... this delicious, convenient, amazing food cart has VEGGIE DOGS!

The bread, however, is not vegan. But that is fine, because they chop up your wiener into little bite sized pieces and load it up with one of the many (50+??) ingredients they have available. And when you don't get it with bread, you get two!

I top my double wiener with pinto beans, sauteed onions, green chilies, jalapenos, and tomatoes. I'm going to come up with a name and have them name one special after me.

Excellent customer service, positive vibe, delicious, high-quality ingredients, and I legally get to say wiener six times in 1 review!

Wiener wiener wiener!

Japanese restaurant, Chinese chef.  Vegas style.  

Imagine Nobu Matsuhisa in a food truck.  Less refined, pseudo Argentinean Japanese that taste great at a great price.

Small selection of relatively fresh, everyday seafood.  The sushi, AYCE quality (this is not an AYCE restaurant).  Average quality seasoned rice wrapped unevenly around massive amounts of filing or compacted to a brick in a mold and topped with this or that then heavily sauced.  Far from what a sushi master would make but the flavors are good.

Two standout "raw" fish dishes, the yellowtail and the white fish.  The first drowned in a yuzu soy, drizzled with garlic oil and topped with jalapeos and micro cilantro; the second drowned in a wasabi shiso vinaigrette and dusted with dry red miso powder.  Both rapidly cook in the acid and take on a ceviche texture but the flavors are solid.

Also noteworthy, the assortment of taro tostadas  Hamachi with salsa verde, salmon with pico de gallo, and Hawaiian style poke (no there are no pineapples in this) all crowned by an avocado cream and cilantro.  A great bite.

Nobuesque tempura (rock shrimp, king crab, assorted veg and shrimp), all not oily but over battered, masking the flavor what's inside but all work with the non traditional dipping sauces ie miso, yuzu aioli..

Finally the soy braised short rib with wasabi.  Well braised and glazed.  The wasabi cream compliments the earthy soy and cuts the richness of the dish.  Excellent.

Friendly, off Strip service.  Casual decor.  UNBELIEVABLE VALUE at around $20pp.

It's not authentic but it's all Vegas baby.

If I could give Green Acre Dog Boarding no stars...I would.  Stay away from this dog boarding facility.  It appears that Yelp has been removing ALL of the negative reviews that this place has had, and I this facility is STILL taking in animals despite what happened two weeks ago (and Yelp saying they are closed).  Four of my five dogs died while under the care of this boarding facility.  I was "promised" that no more than ten dogs would be cared for at a time.  When we dropped our dogs off, there was only two "larger" dogs and about four small dogs at their house.  My dogs ran around the yard, and seemed to be OK.  We were going out of town for two funerals, and our five dogs (English Bulldog puppy, Manchester Terrier, Pit Bull, Great Dane, and rescue dog) were to stay at their facility for about ten days.  I received a call very late at night that four of our dogs had ran away and died from heat exhaustion (one of which being a six month old puppy and one being a 12 year old blind/deaf dog).  I later found out that my four "furry children" were only four of the twenty-some dogs that died under their care, and i was lied to...they did not run away; they were neglected.  I had NO CLUE the owners were going to be out of town, or I would have had ANYONE I could think of go pick them up.  On top of this tragedy, not once have we received any type of apology for our loss from the owners.  They met my family upon drop off, and knew we had two small children we would have to explain this to...no remorse...no apology.  Please don't take any animal here.  They shouldn't be allowed to care for animals.

Before Bacchanal,  Before Wicked Spoon, Before the Buffet at the Bellagio, Before everyone else got on the bandwagon, This buffet started it all
Buffet Stations, each serving a different cuisine. What a great concept. 

I can remember when this was the "It" or should I say the "Must Eat" buffet in Las Vegas. But alas, It's old, the ambiance is not as vibrant, the food quality and presentation has been surpassed by the restaurant I mentioned above and more, but the Carnaval Buffet still has its mojo. 

I've always enjoyed the Chinese station here. Dim sum, BBQ pork, steam buns & pork and preserved egg congee. I always get the same things. Yum!

Pricing is in line with other buffer. 

Tip: look into the 24 hour pricing. The lady at the register told us it is good for all Caesars casino group for a 24 hour period. Buffet feast for 24 hours? my stomach might not be able to handle that.  Lol. 

Everything was good. The only thing is, Las Vegas is into Great things, newer and better buffets. It might not be as good as the glory days, but it holds its own as far as I'm concern.

I'd say the majority of Celine Dion music I've heard in life has been from dentist offices.  Needless to say, they aren't fond memories.  I clearly link "Because You Loved Me" to drilling sounds and a big light in my face.

But you have GOT to be dead inside if you don't feel something when she hits those big notes in tunes like "Power of Love" or "All By Myself" in a live setting. As a case in point, I heard a wife ask her husband what he thought of the show while exiting, and his answer was "eh".  He looked a shade under 139 years old!  Almost dead!

Not to say the show was all roses.  I found her version of "Live and Let Die" to be punchless and uninspiring.  Especially after seeing Axl's version multiple times a few weeks earlier.  

Glad I saw the show but no way in heck would I ever pay for this.  I sat stage left in the rear orchestra and a seat retailed for $175 before tax and service fees.  It's only worth it for big time fans.  Plenty of those were in attendance.  Watching people lose their minds to the "Titanic" song was very, very interesting.

I was about to start a new weight lost challenge, but knew before that was to start I wanted something sweet and good!  I was in the area for lunch and saw that there was this sweet looking bakery at the end of the shopping center, so I knew that's where I was headed to!

I ordered the Salted Carmel Mocha cupcake to go, just from looking at it I was already drooling! You could clearly see the salt crystals on the top of the drizzled caramel!  Its my new craving, salty/sweet! Can't get enough it!

Got back to work and got to try it out! Let me tell you! The cake part of the cupcake was amazing! It was a moist chocolate with chocolate chucks inside! Yes!! Chucks!!! Yummy!!! The frosting, omg, you get a nice blend of mocha, caramel and salt!! OMG HEAVEN!!!!  This was a perfect cupcake for me!

Also for you ice cream lovin fools (I'm more of cake brownie person) they serve thrifty ice cream, I remember back in the day, that was the bomb ice cream!!  And if you have a crazy sweet tooth, they also have for sale shoots of frosting!!! Forget the cake and go straight to the sweet stuff!!!

Wear a sweater that's more embarrassing than my dye-job and my behavior?  Okay, count me in!

It was another fun night with Yelp Phoenix!  We showed up later than anticipated but we still had two hours of mingling, sipping hot mulled wine, and nibbling on what looked like a delicious spread [no time to eat when there was people to jabber with!].  Entrance was pet food and/or a pet gift that was donated to the Arizona Animal Welfare League.  Yelp Phoenix knows how to keep it classy by giving from their hearts.  50+ people were in attendance and we were allowed to bring a +1 so we got to sneak in our non-Elite friends to show them how we party!  There was a cookie decorating station, an ornament deco station, the *real* Santa, a hot chocolate bar, a White Elephant gift exchange, and a chance to go ice skating outside.  The venue itself is urban chic and lovely.  The servers were generous and were a delight to strike a conversation with.  My voice is absolutely coarse from all the laughter and chatter and I'll drink my hot tea tomorrow while thinking back to this amazing night fondly.

I'm a bit confused though.  It says we were suppose to be at an Ugly Sweater party but I was clearly at a GORGEOUS sweater party!  Between Brett B.'s eye-gouging snowmen and Susan P.'s twinkly green light bulb earrings, Tom D.'s vomiting Rudolph with a Solo cup on the antler and Linh L.'s jingling Christmas poncho, Melodie C.'s starry vest and Meghan L.'s short-sleeved sweater, I thought I was at a fashion show in Milan!  Where did you all get such stylish sweaters?  Don't get me started on Cheryl B.'s adorable Grinchiness, Kurdy S.'s stripper Barbie sweater, and Kazi H's overflowing cuteness.  ;)  Although I'm not sure if I'd get my bum pinched by Melodie if I were in Milan --- that cheeky ginger!  Also, "I'm Anime Melodie."

Thanks a million to Yelp, Lindsey and her cute baby belly, Santa [I swear I'm on the Nice List... maybe], DJ Sterling for a night of festive tunes, the folks at The Corner for hosting us wackos, and CityScape for tickets to ice skate!  

Happy holidays, everyone!  I hope to see you all in 2015!

"What would you do if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key."-"With A Little Help From My Friends", Beatles

Beatles LOVE, with seating in the round, so not a bad seat in the house.  It's been showcased on the Strip for a long time now, and still draws the crowds nightly.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?select=z2BQr5kmAM5La12sRzvQSg#z2BQr5kmAM5La12sRzvQSg

We used Tix4Tonight to score some primo seats for cheap.  There's a part of the act where a surpise is brought out to the audience and we happened to be the very last row to participate.  I won't spoil it, but it was fun!

Pre-show, some clowns put on some comic relief by, literally, blowing smoke up people's arses.  Kinda creepy, kinda funny - it was great seeing people's reactions.

The highlights of Beatles LOVE, for me, were the aerialist during "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" & the act featuring "Strawberry Fields Forever".  Very touching.  I didn't care much for the halfpipes and rollerbladers.  Oh, and the music is on blast!  I'm talking loud!  So, just be mindful of that, if you have sensitive hearing.

Overall, a great show worth the money & time while in Vegas!  I highly recommend using Tix4Tonight for purchasing tickets the day before/day of.  Our seats were great & we saved a lot of money.  I'm generally not a Cirque du Soleil fan, but I highly enjoyed this eclectic & colorful show.

I read a Yelp talk thread that was singing the praises of Niccoli's Deli & Pizza a couple of months ago. So I decided to take the plunge after my office moved to CenPho.

This is a Mom & Pop place that's been around for over thirty years. I talked to the Mrs. for a couple of minutes explaining that I was the new kid in town. She explained the setup where you order and they call you if it's busy but will bring your meal to the table if they're not swamped with customers.

They don't have a soda machine. They sell individual cans. I ordered the meatball sub sandwich. The bread was really soft. They cut up the meat so you don't have your meatballs falling out of the bread like most meatball sandwiches. They have a lot of marinara sauce on the sandwich and it is piping hot. The ladies out there can probably only eat half of the sandwich, that's how big it is. I would say that it had to be one of the tastiest meatball sandwiches I have ever had.

I definitely will be a regular customer of Niccoli's.

A good British steak house in the Paris?  Why not.

Love him or hate him, Gordon Ramsay is a multi Michelin stared chef.  Trying his London restaurants dispelled the myth for me that British food is bland and flavorless.  That said, at Gordon Ramsay Steak, the British signature dishes are the standouts.  As a steakhouse, it falls in the middle of the pack in price and quality behind Cut, StripSteak, and CraftSteak.

Two types of beef, limited cuts (epically if you are not sharing your steak).  28 day dry aged, prime beef is excellent.  Well trimmed.  Good marbling.  Beefy with the waft of umame.  The American kobe is feminine; tender, mild, almost sweet.  They claim the beef rates a BMS 10+ (Japanese A5), could be but it's nowhere near as flavorful as Australian or Japanese wagyu.

The signature dishes are outstanding.  Flavors are bold.  The Beef Wellington with a syrupy, red wine demi packs a flavor punch.  A classic.  The "Fisherman's Grill" is also exceptional.  Perfectly cooked lobster, mussels, scallops served with a silky curry sauce.  Oh yeah!.  

Sides meant to be shared.  The mushroom tart, gratineed spinach and blue cheese mac and cheese are good eats and make the perfect match to the dry aged beef by heightening the umame aftertaste.  Unfortunately their flavors overpower the kobe cuts.

Service is friendly and very efficient.

Very good international wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.

Note:  Use your Total Rewards casino card to get a slight (5-10 percent) discount.  Tier does not matter.

Crab Corner brought me back to my childhood with their Maryland blue crabs. I cried tears of joy when I tasted them for the first time. I had searched high and low for crabs that were seasoned just like I remembered them from back in the day and I hadn't found exactly what I was looking for until I found Crab Corner. This is easily one of my favorite places in Vegas. I just wish it was closer to where I live! 

The guys that own the place are as awesome as their food is. They're very friendly and are helpful with whatever you need. Good service, good times. Bring a bunch of friends and have at it. Crab Corner has a casual atmosphere that is perfect to drink a few brewskies and get down and dirty with some crabs. Bibs and a hearty appetite recommended!

This review is dedicated to my late grandfather, whom I acquired some of my writing genes from. He passed away before the new year. I used to eat Maryland blue crabs by the swimming pool at his house in the summertime. I will miss him.

I've been a patient of Dr David Matter for over ten years, putting up with a twenty-plus minute drive since moving from Gilbert to Chandler.  I didn't enjoy the drive, but I really liked him, so my eye never wandered... until one day a fancy mailer caught my eye.  I recall seeing the phrase "paraffin wax", and baby, that's all she wrote.

After walking into the unassuming office, which faces Alma School (you'll park on the opposite side of the building), I excitedly anticipated which part of my anatomy would be waxed.  The office is adjacent to a colon hydro-therapy business, so I really didn't know what to expect.

Mesha greeted me, and suggested I take a seat.  After blurting out something about spa treatments, she summoned Dawnie, who I immediately took a shine to.  She was utterly charming, referring to moi as "sugar" and "honey".  Where's the tip jar, cuz daddy's ready to slap it down!

After being ushered to one of their "relaxation rooms", and seeing an ultra-modern massage chair, I shifted focus to Dawnie and let out an "Oh Mama!".  She coaxed my shoes off, and had me dip my paws into a crock pot of translucent wonder.  First the palms, then the backsides.  Each hand was bagged and summarily placed into a soft mitten.

I was led to the chair, which had foot massage apparatus, which I have never seen before.  Asking for a photo, I realized my camera was tucked into my front pocket.  Dawnie, realizing I was about to try and stuff my baker-sized oven mitt in my jeans, offered to take the photo and text it to me.  The massage chair was activated, and I spent the next 15 minutes in Pamper-ville.

Tessa, my hygienist, came to fetch me.  She even carried my clod hoppers to the cleaning room.  Total sweetheart.  After completing the cleaning, I had the pleasure of meeting Dr Caryn Lee.  The whole experience was one pretty woman after another.

I love ya Dr Madder, but these breezies got me on lock.

ps. They have the ability to mold your crown in-house, same day, so NO TEMPORARIES!!!  YAY!

Love the SLS.  Period.  Wonderful service, wonderful restaurants, and wonderful pool.  It's a boutique, not a monstrosity.  Just what I want from a Vegas hotel.  What doesn't it have?  A great casino, and a little far down the strip so you are forced to drive, taxi, or monorail out.

#1 - Get here while it's affordable.  Whether you use Travelocity.com (like I did), hotels.com, or book direct -- there is amazing deals to be had right now.  On average, $139/night.  Again, amazing.

#2 - Restaurants.  Whether you dine at Cleo, Bazaar Meat, Katsuya, or casual dining spots like the SLS Buffet, Griddle Caf, 800 Degrees, Umami -- all are beyond great experiences.  Less so: Perq the coffee spot (it's okay), and Ku Noodle (very casual, has shu mai but not potstickers).

#3 - Service.  Wonderful and friendly, it was warm and extra nice for the moment I arrived.  Kudos.

#4 - Pool.  Cabanas are pricey, so I was able to get a soft and cushiony bed just inside the pool.  Cool music with outstanding looking pool hostesses and bartenders created a relaxing vibe that was also titillating.

#5 - Rooms.  The hallways are definitely hip near gothic, and the rooms were elegant and modern.  Lots of mirrors.  Ooh la la.

Overall, I loved my 3 night stay.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 44/100

The boyfriend and I aren't big drinkers, so fraps at this Starbucks ended up being our first drinks when we first got to Vegas, LOL. This location is nice and big, well lit, and has TONS of seating. We went close to 10pm and they were still open pretty late (might be 24 hours, but I can't remember). 

I decided to try their new caramel flan frap, which was really good! Much better than the caramel frap or the creme brulee frap, IMO. The boyfriend got a peppermint mocha frap and his was great as well.

They only had two people working during the time we went, but they were very friendly asian women who worked with smiles on their faces :)

The only reason why I won't give this Starbucks 5 stars is because it is really expensive. However, all of the Starbucks in LV are much more expensive than normal Starbucks locations are. We got two tall sized fraps and it was over $11...kind of ridiculous.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 60/100

Pretty solid shopping mall in Vegas! One of the best ones I visited during my most recent trip. It's huge and actually feels like a real mall as opposed to some of the hotels who have a few shops (less than 20-30) and consist of stores that nobody would ever be interested in actually shopping at.

At the front of the mall, there's a smaller area that consists of several floors with an awesome winding escalator. On the second (or third? I can't remember), it leads further back into a whole other section of the mall...which goes on for forever! So many stores! They range from normal/average, to high end and luxury brands. There are also lots of restaurants and cafes located in the mall.

The one reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because I felt like I was getting kind of confused as to the layout of the mall. It's weird how there's the small-ish entryway area (reminds me of the big mall in San Francisco), and then on one floor it kinda just continues further and farther away from everything else. Also, the mall map directory was kind of confusing and I wasn't sure what direction to walk in.

I would say this mall is comparable to the Venetian's, except slightly different architecture! Both very European.

Rouge red hotness! Of all the luxurious Vegas resorts I've stayed at (Palazzo, Venetian, Bellagio), this one absolutely takes the cake. The people and the decor: trendy, chic and beautiful.

There was absolutely nothing negative about our stay here. All of the staff was super friendly, the rooms fabulous, the food fantastic... really, I could not step foot outside the resort and be completely happy. 

I haven't been to Rehab Sunday or Wet Republic yet, but the Euro pool was a blast... after all, if you're the ones bringing the party, what does it matter where you go? Sure, there were some ladies that should have kept their bikini tops on, but you can't knock anyone who's comfortable in their own skin even if it's fake. Get to the pool by 9am to reserve prime lounge chairs, otherwise make some friends and offer to buy drinks in exchange for them.

Encore = Ultimate Fabulosity.

Btw, they have an incredible summer special going for $169/night through the beginning of Sept!

Had it not been for the Illuminations Half Marathon http://www.yelp.com/biz/illuminations-half-arizona-phoenix, I would have never known...never known that set amidst the majestic Sonoran Desert and surrounded by the beautiful McDowell Mountains--rows upon prickly rows of saguaro cacti maintaining their century-old vigils--sits JW Marriott's spectacular Desert Ridge Resort.

People golf here, it seems.  I mean, the Marriott shoulders two championship golf courses, ones designed in part by Arnold Palmer, and they look seriously cool...if you're a golfer.  I'm not.  In fact, I hate golfing.  Rather, I came here to run.  And these courses, illuminated for the Half Marathon with hundreds and hundreds of glowsticks, were great fun nonetheless--beautiful, even after sundown.

The amenities at the Marriott--lazy river, heated pools, spa, fitness center, tennis courts (to name a few)--were impressive.  And although I hadn't the time to explore them--my stay was short--I took notice, traveling about the resort, snapping a few shots.  Next time--and I'm sure there'll be a next time--I'll give them a try.  What was nice, though, was simply waking early, grabbing a Peppermint Mocha from the in-house Starbucks, and sitting outside, fire pit cozy.  I love mornings!  And in Phoenix, it seems, some golfers enjoy mornings too.

This review is long overdue! A friend of mine gave me a gift certificate for a pedicure so I called for an appointment and got placed with Tami. 

My experience was relaxing from start to finish. Tami (the owner) is very friendly and good at what she does. She had recently opened after years of working in the hotels doing luxury pedicures. She has brought her experience in that arena to the strip mall. If you're looking to be pampered with a high end spa quality pedicure without breaking the bank, this is your place! 

The pedicure that I had was amazing! The products that they use are high quality along with the heavenly smells... Let's just say I could get used to treating myself to a pedicure at the Mirror Mirror Salon on a regular basis. I really loved the fact that this salon uses hygienic liners in the bowls where you soak your feet. It's so important, I can't stress this enough! I contracted flesh eating bacteria at a high end nail salon in NYC and I could have lost my toe or worse. After that, I refuse to go anywhere that doesn't use them and finding places that do can be difficult. If I were you, I'd consider going to Mirror Mirror for that fact alone... 

Now as for the high quality products I was mentioning, I'll give you a little play by play. They use a callus softener on your feet followed by a brown sugar souffl scrub. Then comes the glycolic acid mask and healing foot mousse. After that I received one of the best foot massages ever with a rich, moisturizing body butter followed by their yummylicious vanilla paraffin wax.

I made sure I thanked my friend profusely for the gift certificate. I'll definitely return and I recommend checking out this salon. If you do, make sure to say hello to Tami for me. She's great!

Low expectations. That's what I had when we stopped to have a bite before a movie. Not a big fan of deep dish, we were delighted to see "flat bread" pizzas offered. The sausage pizza, while could have been crunchier, was quite good. Service was great considering our friend was so dehydrated from being overserved the previous evening, he must have had a dozen ice tea refills. 

The ambience at these places kills me. It's like Oregano's married Cracker Barrel! There is crap all over the walls. Hey. Who's dusting this stuff anyway. I did notice quite a bit of dust and grease on the light fixture above our table. 

We attempted to try the pizza place a few doors away, but they were closed. I suggested Hooter's but before I finished saying it, we all squealed in all of our gayness...."Ewww...boobies!". So Uno it was. 

But I couldn't help think of that card game Uno. Damn that's a fun game. And I also couldn't get a guy from high school outta my head. His nickname was Uno. He got it one day in the locker room after gym class. You figure it out. 

I'll go again if I'm ever at the AZ Center. I just might bring my Windex and Endust however.

When I first started buying BB I thought it was the greatest thing EVER!! 
I got tons of beautiful produce and I loved going early to help distribute the Baskets. 

Little by little my basket became more and more unusable. The quality went down hill. 
I would be getting the same things week after week, things that were next to rotten upon receiving, everything was sooo dirty and some things that I would just never use, like 6 onions and 6 bell peppers. 

I recently switched to all organic and I thought I would order one of the organic baskets this week for a change. 

I've got to tell you I feel robbed. Honestly this basket sucks! Most of the items weren't even labeled as organic and I wasn't able to volunteer this morning so I don't know for sure if they even are. 

I don't know about you but I don't need 3 bundles of celery. Again the filth that these veggies are covered in is inexcusable. 

I spent $18 last week at the OTFM and got so much more CLEAN organic produce. BB charges $25 for their organic basket of junk. 

I will not be ordering these again. You really could do better at the grocery store or farmers market if you want produce and then you can choose to buy locally or U.S. grown veggies.

One of best hotels in the world. The Wynn hotel is located on the old Desert Inn hotel. It's the only hotel on the strip with a golf course. If you are a person who loves the European decor and beautiful artwork you are in for a treat. As we all know Las Vegas has a lot hotels from low end to high end. 

If you are a person who enjoys high end hotels you must give this hotel a try. The casino is done with outstanding artwork with great art finishing. If you are a high roller or a person plays the slot you will enjoy the great casino layout. The hotels is gorgeous from  A to Z. If you are a picky person when it comes to hotel beds you are going to love the beds here. 

If you are coming to Vegas you must give the spa a try. One of the best spas in the world. If you are buffet lover you will enjoy the outstanding food. I highly recommend  the Sinatra for high end dinning. If you are looking for something more low key check out the country club. You can have lunch over the patio that overlooks the golf course. 

Being a big fan of Caesars Palace for may years the Wynn is my new playground in Vegas. All the way around this is a 5 star resort.

Place is bomb dot com
Must visit when in Phoenix
In my top five joints 

Long before Yelp or the Travel Channel, my go to source for finding the best places to check out when travelling was a book called "Eat Your Way Across the USA."  I think this was only one of two places in Arizona that the book featured.  Went to Richardson's for the first time in probably the late 90's or early 2000's and have been hooked ever since.  It is among my absolute most favorite restaurants.

A couple years back, the original location was destroyed by fire.  This was my first time in the new location which is right around the corner from the original spot.  The interior looks almost exactly like the old location.  They now have mandatory valet, though, which I am not crazy about.

In the past, I have gotten the huevos rancheros and the enchiladas.  Best I have ever had for both.  Today, I got the Trio which was Swordfish, Salmon and Mahi Mahi.  Came on a tortilla with asparagus and carrots.  Outstanding!  They have five dollar mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys during brunch hours.  Had one mimosa and one bellini.

I wish I had just come to Richardson's straight from the airport when I arrived last Tuesday.  It is that freaking good!

A cool place to check out AT NIGHT for some cheesy fun! The light show is the main attraction : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=o6mHisZZA0tj7RjX7W1ccw.
Came here to check out the ZIPLINING (Freemont Flightlines) and the light show. Tons of people- GREAT people watching. Saw some familiar faces : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=baqnWN8WDv_vdGcYDljwNg. 
My favorite group was this one: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=cvn4V62FYXTCGj7WLVx4tg
I also saw a Justin Bieber look alike here, with his mom heading out near his bedtime. You can check out a live 80's cover band, street performers, cheap eats- my favorite thing here was the time when the neon light show overhead plays "We Will Rock You" from Queen. Forgot to get my deep fried twinkie to complete my experience...

They charge for parking (what?) in the structure, so park at the nearby hotels like the CAL instead.

If I lived here I would probably be dead in a year. LOL! Walk the strip and view the freak show that is AMURRICA!

Sure, when in Vegas it's almost mandatory to take a walk on The Strip to view the sights. To me it's always better at night when everything is lit up in all it's cheesy glory! Plus, if there during the summer season walking The Strip in the day is inviting heat stroke! Damn, it's hot over here. 

Don't get fooled by the optical illusion thinking that the casino you want to walk to is close as after shlepping a half hour you realize you should have taken a cab, the monorail, or the shuttle that runs along The Strip. Still, the views of the massive casinos all lit up and the free shows make it worth a trek up and down The Strip. The Pirate Show at Treasure Island, the Volcano at the Mirage, the Dancing Waters at the Bellagio to name a few.

Hey, at least you are allowed to drink in public here so load up a cold one and have at it as you walk by the hordes of tourists, Eurotrash, bachelor and bachelorette parties, and assorted middle America white trash WalMart crowd that seems to gather here. Don't forget to view the crazies, homeless, porn card slappers, bad street performers, drunk blotto people, and those annoying characters in knock off costumes posing for money. The craziness never ends! It's almost like being in Times Square NYC!

The Las Vegas Strip is an amusement park of kitschy weirdness in itself. I love cheesy and approve totally!

I've only been here for lunch but based on some reviews regarding breakfast I may be missing something.

The first time I went in here I was kind of overwhelmed by all the choices. It didn't make it any easier trying to decipher the menu plastered above the grill area, that was kind of awkward. I'm not certain if they have a paper menu.

I struck up a conversation with a regular and he pointed me to the Gyros special. I ordered that and didn't really dig it too much. The next trip I tried the pastrami and was not too impressed. Both meals BTW, were ginormous. Next, I said to myself if this was an IQ Test and you had to choose something from a place that was called the BURGER Factory what should you choose? Burger, dummy. Yes, I tried a burger the next time through and liked it. So I would rate the burgers a 4 and the rest of the stuff a 2 to average out to a 3 star rating for the total body of work.

Also, they take credit cards. So this is not a cash only place.

Admittedly, I like Popeyes! And yes, I am a Fan!

Whether its this one, or the one in Blythe coming back from California, it's a real treat to pick up some NOLA inspired food.  Their Cajun Gravy is to die for! Really.

Stopped in today to catch up with Scott D. We have been checking into businesses on Yelp together for over four years. Long time! It's been a fun four years and nice to kick back with a friend who also loves Popeyes!

I had a Po'Boy Chicken sandwich, which wasn't bad.  But I wouldn't insult any of my NOLA friends by calling it a true Po'Boy.  I also ordered three chicken strips and asked for a Cajun Gravy chaser.  LOL  It ran me just under $8.00, not a steal but a fair price. A better deal is what Scott ordered, their Tuesday Special of 2 pieces of chicken, biscuit and Pop for $2.99.  "Love that Chicken at Popeyes!"

Enjoy

JERK!  

Yes, the flavor of Jamaica. It's in 30 percent of the menu.  That said, what's a group of hungry, foodie poker grinders to do?  Order every "jerk" dish of course.

Side note:  this is not a Jamaican restaurant rather a contemporary neighborhood bistro.  Large portions, good prices, and friendly off Strip service.  Hits and misses on flavor and preparation but overall a great value.

The jerk seasoning, a good spice blend with pronounced allspice flavor that lacks the fiery scotch bonnet peppers heat and floral pepper taste.  Sadly it results in an earthy taste not often complimented by the other ingredients.

The run down:

Jerk oven roasted baby back ribs with grilled pineapple and a buttermilk ranch sauce - Tender but very earthy in flavor.  The pineapple provides much needed acidity.

Jerk fried calamari with a sweet chili glaze - Pass.  Oily, soggy, and a sticky mess.

Couscous salad with jerk seared ahi seasoned with a herbaceous pesto, heirloom tomatoes, goat cheese and a hint of truffle oil is refreshing but the fish is previously frozen.  All good, it's natural flavor is obliterated by the seasoning.

DW fried chicken with cornbread and a jerk cream gravy - Southern cooking taken a little too far south.  Jerk seasoning has a burnt, dirt taste once deep fried.  Flabby dish.

Jerk lamb chops - Excellent.  Cooked to temperature.  The jerk seasoning enhances the natural game and mineral flavor of the lamb.

Jerk filet - Very good.  Like the lamb, cooked to temperature while the seasoning enhances the mineral flavor of the beef.

Jerk chicken breast - Flavorful but slightly dry.  The orange glaze does not pair well.

Overall, a solid neighborhood bistro with a twist.

Try saying Bobby Q three times really fast in a southern accent. It sounds like you're saying Barbeque.

I can't believe that I've been living in this area for a few years and I just started patronizing Bobby Q's. There's definitely a happening vibe to this place after dark. The place is packed and the air is buzzing with conversations and laughter. They have ample seating inside and outside. We met some friends that have never been here a few weeks ago and they became instantly hooked.

We ordered steaks, pulled pork, ribs and brisket. Everything along with the sides were fabulous. My brisket was tender and the flavor instantly transported my taste buds to a happy place. The pulled pork was equally as good. I've had the ribs on other trips to Bobby Q and have always enjoyed them. I got a big thumbs up on the steak from my dining companion so I'm going to have to try that next time I'm in the house. The tab for four people without alcohol and before tip was $70. 

This is definitely my favorite BBQ place in the metro area.

I came here yesterday for the first time and thought, wow Culver's has merged with Portillo's. Then my food came and realized it was more like a takeoff of Steak 'n Shake.

The atmosphere at Freddy's is very much like a cross between Johnny Rockets (lots of shinny nickel) and Steak 'n Shake. Actually when I think of it, Steak 'n Shake is more like Johnny Rockets, LOL. 

I believe my friends Kay and Monica are both right; with reality for me somewhere between their two reviews.  Granted I only had a Chicago Dog ($3.39), a Chili Dog ($3.59), a medium drink ($1.79) but the tab was a bit pricey at $9.48. 

Because the tube steaks are Vienna Beef, their taste is very good. The Chili dog was tasty, but I'll skip their Chicago interpretation next time. It comes on a Nedick's (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nedick's) like toasted slice bread bun, where the dog is trying to escape the toppings (see photos) 

The hot dogs also appear to be only #10s (10 to the pound), so I'll go with the burgers next time. If Freddy's was only a hot dog place, I probably would skip it in the future. But I enjoyed myself and want to try those steakburgers. Again, think Steak 'n Shake but without the Five-Way Chili

So Three Stars "A-Okay and I'll give Freddy's another try in a few weeks.

A plate of fancy desserts, a plate of carved meats & BBQ, while slurping a bowl of beef pho and tonkotsu ramen. Don't. f*ck. up. this. rotation.

Excited to see that Ceasars Palace was finally opening the doors of its highly anticipated $7 million buffet, Vegas buffets are very similar to one another (all equipped with seafood, carving station, fancy dessert station, etc). Generally, new buffets start off very well, so we jumped to try this before it begins to spiral down in quality (all buffets eventually do this).

Bacchanal seems to have adapted a lot of Wicked Spoon ideas like the brilliantly idiotic concept of individually plating items in dishes/pots/pans/mini-deep fryers so that items do not fit on your existing buffet plate 
(Why does fancy plating mean that we have to further frequently pace back and forth for more food?)
But, all in all, the food at Bacchanal is a solid buffet competitor to Wynn, Cosmo, & Bellagio.

The perfect time to go to a Vegas buffet is right before lunch ends (2:30).  
(Props to Justin Y.)
That way:
1. You avoid peak rush hours and the death line wrapped around the corner. 
2. You pay for the lunch price, while dinner items are new and slowly filter in at stations. I.E Crab legs were were not offered for lunch, but appeared later during our meal
3. Going out at night? Luckily for you, you had a late lunch/early dinner so you will feel like less of a whale in that tight dress.


Bacchanal Back-anal jokes aside, this place is recommended

Taiwanese ice, Vegas style.

Am I in hell?  It's 110 degrees.  The Prius says 125 outside.  I'm seat belted in and  on the 15 when I realize I'm still wearing a hoody.  AC not cooling s#!%.  Finally, the trailer.  Frost Bites Shavery and relief.  Within minutes cup in hand.  Scoop one, light, fluffy, COLD, ahhhh.  Scoop two, body temperature falling, I'm forgetting I'm still wearing a hoody.  Scoop three; NOOOOO, it's melting!!!

This is good stuff.  Hawaii yeeps, think Frostcity on steroids.  Ribbons of fluffy goodness are shaved  from blocks of highly concentrated. naturally flavored ice.  Light, fluffy, delicious for the first two or three scoops then the texture changes it quickly becomes wet and "mushy", the sweetness becomes cloying.  Stick to the smallest size.  You can always get another.  (went back four times in one visit.  Scoop, scoop, toss, order, scoop, scoop, toss... Things we do for yelp)  

Flavors are strong and delish while the ice stays ice.  Vanilla (cloying sweetness), mango (floral, intense, cloying finish), green tea (bitter sweet tea flavor, best once melted), black sesame (nice sesame aroma, different, cloying finish).

Toppings are akin to a froyo bar, ie big chunks of fruits, nuts, crackers, candy, and cookies.  They detract and overpower the ice.  Too much crunch or texture and flavor.  

Inexpensive ranging from $2.25 to $6.25 for a family size cup.

Very good but more of a sweet treat than a chilling refresher (I guess that's why we have beer).

A 24 hour cheap hot sandwich place is a vegas jackpot!!!  I always find myself having sandwich cravings and i'd been spending weeks looking at the reviews. I had decided way before i stepped into the store at PH, that i would be ordering the Full Montagu- Roast beef and turkey!!! 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=pqiqUiWVESs9LubdKK2zcw
We were still full from breakfast, so i didn't get to try a second sandwich as i had hoped (i'm definitely getting the canonball meatball sammie next time). I'm sure after i try a few more different sammies here, i would upgrade to a 5, but based on just the one i had, i just needed a little something more. More mayonaisy sauce? Avocado? Not sure. But i am not craving it, as i do with Cooks, Mendo, Caps or Langers. But... I will be back for sure to get the cannonball and get ANOTHER brownie whoopie pie !! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=DbdvnjAtWRE2Hj0_MbX26Q

The Mecca.  The holiest of all things burger.  It's a west coast operation, so I only get the chance to In-N-Out once every few years (insert joke here).  But it never disappoints!

The menu is as simple as it gets - burger, cheeseburger, fries, drinks.  But don't let that fool you, there's nothing simple about it.  I'm guessing the most popular menu item is the Double-Double...two patties with two slices of cheese.  From there you can go off menu and order any kind of burger you want.  The first number is patties, the second is cheese slices.  Haven't had the chance to try a 4x4 yet, but that will be happening in the next few months.  Beyond that, you can also dabble in the secret menu and get your burger protein style (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun), or animal style (includes grilled onions and animal sauce).  It's impossible to go wrong.

French fries can also be ordered animal style, but the plain version is just as good.  One of each is even better.  And as far as milkshakes, you have to go with Neapolitan...a combo of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.

It's that simple, yet that perfect.

While I was in Vegas and bored outta my mind, I called my "friend" Chris who moved to Vegas a few years ago so we could "chat".

I was staying at the Cosmo so I told him to meet me at the Vesper Bar so we could have a drink and he could possibly slip me a quaalude *kidding*

People watching here is amazing.  The bar area is pretty much empty most of the time, but there are so many people moving past from the hotel.  All kinds of walks of life, from everywhere.  

The drinks all have interesting names and even more interesting ingredients.  Drinks are average prices, anywhere from 10-15 bucks, but they're worth it.  The bartenders are nice, and easy on the eyes.  

If you happened to see an Asian guy making out with a tall white guy...That was probably me...God I'm such a slut, at least Chris cured my case of boredom.

It truly pains me to have to write this review of what I would otherwise consider an excellent establishment, but recent events prevent me from recommending this restaurant to anyone.

Yes, this may be a bit of a rant, so in an attempt to be balanced, let me offer a little perspective.

Pizzeria Bianco was one of the first places that I ate at when I moved to Phoenix earlier this year. The food is very good. The service is good, but I was immediately aware that the business model is very flawed, in that I have never waited for less than 90 minutes for a table. It is true that you can pass the time quickly in the adjacent wine bar, and I have done so on many occasions. The wine selection is above average, and the environment is pleasant.

However, the business manager (owner Chris Bianco's ex-wife) is a truly miserable human being (ask any of her employees), and her imprint on the approach to customer service at the restaurant is unmistakable. The management believes that there is absolutely no incentive to provide anything resembling an enjoyable experience for their patrons because there are unlimited numbers of people who will wait upwards of 4 hours for their signature wood-fired pizzas.

As a fan of excellent food, I do appreciate their attention to detail and excellent craft. But the consistent manner in which I see loyal customers disrespected and outright abused is completely unacceptable.

While I do love their pizza and antipasto (which is not, irreplaceable I might add), after many months of consistent patronage, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Just got this message from one of the owners (their review is under Jestin M.) 

this is me one of the owner of Tina's cafe.  you are obviously a poor idiot who is miserable in life.  If you have a nerve, you should've tell your complaint to us instead of crying out on yelp.  We have so many flowers and will continue doing great. Tina will bit the fack out of you if you come and let her know who you are.  ASS HOLE. Go back to your Mexico and eat corn with your whore mother.  by the way, your picture looks like a a guy who is infected with some kinds of disease.   Your women is ugly as you btw (lol)

So after this I personally called and spoke with a manager, they confirmed Jestin works there. Even though I was being cordial with my tone and trying to be helpful in saying that this was my experience, maybe others are experiencing the same thing and that can help fix the problem, they proceeded to say a few things I wont retype here and hung up. 

I responded back and so did they. If you want to read that here is a screen shot of that: 
http://i.imgur.com/PvcBz.jpg

So it was not enough for them to say that message. They just texted me this right now (since I called with my cell). 

"You keep mentioning 5yrs old about your stupid compain, we will report your info to be investigated if you are a child melester. Tina has a right not serve you for the safty of our customer. Take your little 10 dollar to mcdonald's. Lol"

Here is a screen shot of the text I just got from the business phone number:

So if you feel like this is a place you would like to try out after reading this, by all means take your chances.

Guys, do you have a problem approaching beautiful women?  Afraid of rejection?  No idea how to start a conversation without cheezy pickup lines?  Maybe you need to feel like a man again after being beaten down at the office or just want to feel like a 10 when ladies at the club call you a six?  Two words gents, Caf Teaze.

For less than half of what it cost for a dance, you can have all that plus a great milk tea.

To be clear, this is NOT a strip club!  Just a bunch of Asian ladies prancing around in their underwear doing everyday things.  You know, like serving tea and making conversation. Normal stuff.

About the conversations, it's slightly deeper than what you expect at the Rhino or Sapphire ("Where you from?  Really?  Me too!") but not by much.  They are however, experts at stroking your ego.  (Stop it, it's not a euphemism).

Before you go all sexist on me, I respect the servers for doing what they need to, to make a living. Tips, from what I gave, must be good and if you got it, use it.

Am I a fan of the concept?  No.  It reminds me of the countless bars in Shibuya Japan staffed by beautiful women who, for a metered rate, talk men into feeling better about themselves.  I guess it's cheaper than a shrink.  To each his own.

Almost forgot, the teas are good.  Brews are strong, especially the flavored teas (the Passion fruit black tea borders on bitter).  Milk teas can be ordered hot or cold.  Good ratio of tea to "milk".  Boba is well cooked.  tender throughout.  The hot taro milk tea is excellent.

I take the fifth and refuse to say anymore after all, what happens in Vegas...

I don't really want to put art, and the experience of it into text. Because good art transcends it. 

It won't do you much good - for me to oooo and aaaah over the hours spent wandering through a large poignant building of installation art pieces. Describing in extreme detail all of the sounds, sensations, and lack of both which I experienced in each art piece. 

Nope - it won't do either you or me - any good.

Especially when I have a word limit here.

Cause you won't be able to picture what I type. No matter how hard I try. I'll ruin the surprise of certain exhibits. The mystery.  And it will only frustrate me - that I can't convey how intrinsically cool and alluring the Mattress Factory is.

I mean the name alone is cool. Sexy even.

But. I will tell you that you should go.

If you're in Pittsburgh for even a couple of hours. Don't waste time on things like food, sports, or anything else you may have planned on doing. Just go to the Mattress Factory. 

Go alone if you have to.

But even better.

Find someone that you enjoy spending time with. Someone who lets you say "that's so cool...." over and over again about every exhibit. Someone who may even see each piece the way you do. Or maybe not.

And then just pass away the day at the Mattress Factory. Wandering and experiencing. You won't have to worry about uptight museum people following you around. Or tired tourists. Or "is that it?" art. Or sterile marble floors - which echo with every step. You just don't need to worry about much when you go here. 

The Mattress Factory is the perfect place to let yourself slip. If even a little.

It's a special, one of a kind place, nestled in a random neighborhood, away from the hustle. Away from packed bars. 

Away from it all.

My new favorite lunch place in Vegas! I've visited Milos in Greece and New York and am so excited that there is now one in LV. 

They offer a set lunch for $22. You get the choice of several appetizers, a few different mains and dessert. 

We ended doing one set lunch and ordering the Milos special, a must when at any Milos! It's lightly fried zucchini and eggplant with tzatziki and fried Greek cheese. OMG, I could eat this all day long. Plus their tzatziki is like yogurt of the gods. It's super thick and filled with cucumbers. 

For the set lunch, we ended paying a lot of supplemental charges for the octopus and the lobster spaghetti but it was worth it. I think next time I'd do the dips to start instead of the octopus, but regardless everything was wonderful. 

The atmosphere is bright, with some seating outside, which is so lovely for lunch. I hate feeling like you are in the basement of a casino for lunch and that is not the case at Milos. 

Dessert was some of that thick Greek yogurt with strawberry puree. We licked the bowl. You get the picture. Have you booked a table yet?!

Booked the Penthouse and all i can say is....WOW!!!!

The panoramic view of the strip from the corner Penthouse was breathtaking and the spacious rooms were elegant, modern & clean.  The beds you ask? Nice and firm, just the way i like it! Flat screens in every room. What's next? the toilet? lol
Oh, and the fully automated shades and daily "turn down" service was pretty impressive, too!
  
Throughout my weekend stay, service was on point and the hotel staff didn't miss a beat.  Even on my last day, they provided complimentary limousine service to the airport!  Very swank.

My only complaint would be that my darn ears kept popping as I rapidly ascended the elevator to the 54th floor.  But hey the view from that soaring height was worth a few annoying pops in my ear and luckily after a couple of days, i adjusted ;)  

The spa at the hotel was also clean, contemporary and most importantly, relaxing. They had all the facilities i've come to expect from a fine resort hotel spa (i.e. TV lounge with refreshments, expansive fitness room, jacuzzi & whirlpool, steam room, and sauna.  

Located inside the newly built City Center, this smoke free & eco-friendly hotel is within walking distance to all the local hotspots, dining, and entertainment on the main strip.
If you're looking for a relaxing recovery after a night of complete decadence, this just might be your ticket to paradise.

Happy Times!

I was warned by my friends not to come here :( But I ignored their advice and I woefully regret it... Le Village Buffet is THEE spot that my cousins and I would bust a mission to go to when I was little. I have so many good memories of this place and I really wanted to come back here to revisit those pleasant memories... Well... those are nothing more than illusions of grandeur and definitely the failures of romanticizing about the past. 

I came here alone for breakfast when my friends were all sleeping and recovering from our nighttime adventures. I remember it was really cheap, about $20-something for the breakfast buffet. The people were very nice and accommodating... 

BUT THE FOOD!!!!! 

Bleh, the plate I grabbed was so horrible I had to cut up and re-arrange the food on my plate to make it look like I actually touched it so the lady would take it away. 

I liked their eggs florentine, the ham the grapefruit, the fruits and the orange juice... but quiche was too oily, the selection of scrambled eggs were disappointing and the steak and potatoes were overcooked. The crepe was "okay" but the bananas were too soggy, I just brushed it aside and ate the outside part with the nutella. I didn't even want to eat the breakfast pastries... it was just chocolate croissants, muffins, danish, cinnabuns, etc... nothing special or out of the ordinary... 

This experience does not even come close to how AMAZING I remember Le Village Buffet to be... Definitely not worth stuffing my face for :(

When it comes to parties, Steve Wynn's Encore Beach Club and XS Night Club are still the gold standard for the hottest spots in town.

I came to the Beach Club on Sunday at around 2:oopm to see Calvin Harris and surprisingly there was hardly no wait at all! I've heard horror stories where people were turned away even though they bought tickets for the show because the venue was beyond capacity. In any case, we got in, I was happy...

SCORE!!

As soon as we walked through security, I witnessed an ocean of skin filling the entire space! And this pool area was huge! 

Damn these people are beautiful! I suggest ordering drinks on the left side of the entrance cuz the drinks were bigger, stiffer and the same price!  

I tried the food as well and it was also very good! I recommend the grilled chicken sandwich and the steak sliders, both were mouthwatering good and excellent accompaniments to our drinks!

Calvin Harris came out about 3:00pm and the crowd was buzzing by now with anticipation! There was so much energy in the pit but it was all positive, no hating, no shoving or any nonsense like that...it was all love and good times and that's how it should be!

Bravo Encore Beach Club!

I had a slammin time and I look forward to coming back very soon!

Happy Times!

Many fine dining restaurants in Vegas resorts seem to be having recession specials right now, so we decided to take advantage of a $39 prix fixe menu L'Atelier is offering. We found out that they stop serving this particular pre-theater menu at 6:45pm. We were running late, and got in closer to 7pm, but the chef still accommodated us. 

The three course meal was served bento box style, with even the dessert on the plate. I can see how this is a convenient wham, bam, thank you ma'am option for people rushing to catch a Vegas show. 

I ordered the king crab and cous cous appetizer, osso buco entree and peach panna cotta dessert. While everything was tasty, portions were definitely on the small side, and nothing that blew me away. It wasn't the quality you'd expect from a Joel Robuchon restaurant. 

Service was pretty mediocre as well. Just because L'Atelier is the more affordable and trendy alternative to its sister restaurant, it doesn't mean it shouldn't put out excellent food and service too.

"'Doctors?' said Ron, looking startled. 'Those Muggle nutters that cut people up?'"  Ron Weasley, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

After a dramatic year of treatment at a different and shitacular place for my Grave's Disease, I ran across Meagan B.'s review and found the amazing Dr. Amiri Harari. I ran away from my old specialist and never looked back... not even to obtain my records [more like they're holding it ransom for some dumb reason and won't fax them over]! 

This guy is a peach. From Day 1, everything went amazing. Even without my medical records, we got my bloodwork done on-site and we did an ultrasound before I even left [something the old doc never even suggested that I do]. I feel completely at ease with him. I get anxiety whenever I go in for anything medical but Dr. Harari makes me feel relaxed. 

Since I was already feeling crappy and frustrated about a year of taking Methimazole and not being able to find the right dosage, Dr. Harari answered all my questions and concerns in regards to radio-iodine. I took a few weeks to think things through. I asked his assistant and even Dr. Harari himself a million questions by phone and never once did he make me feel like I was wasting his time. I felt confident in going through with the radio-iodine treatment under his care. While the desired results aren't kicking in yet, Dr. Harari and I decided that I'll get bloodwork done every month for a few months to see if the hormone count will go down so I can become hypothyroid. I appreciated how thorough we got in regards to my situation and his opinion was really appreciated. Fingers crossed that I don't need a second treatment because I don't think I'd go through it again!

Dr. Harari is a brilliant specialist, knowledgeable, and patient. Like Meagan B., I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes past my appointment time to see him. I have nothing but praises for the guy!

Bigger isn't always better, but sometimes it's exactly what you need. If so, the MGM Grand Hotel is especially good for a big group, conference, or event. It's the largest hotel resort in America (World #2) with rooms branded as MGM Grand, Signature, Skylofts, and The Mansion.

What you'll find at MGM Grand includes:
 * Largest hotel in Vegas with 6,582 rooms
 * Largest casino in Las Vegas
 * 380,000 sq ft convention center
 * 16,800 seat MGM Grand Garden Arena
 * 4 pools including ultra cool Wet Republic
 * A quarter-mile lazy river around the MGM Grand Pools
 * EDM playground Hakkasan Nightclub
 * KA by Cirque Du Soleil theatrical show
 * Brad Garrett's Comedy Club (Headliners vary)
 * Regular performers like David Copperfield
 * A dated activity called the CSI: Experience
 * Access to the Las Vegas Monorail ($5/ride; $12/day)
 * The Forever Grand Wedding Chapel
 * A Salon and a Spa
 * 11 Specialty Restaurants; 6 Casual Spots, a Buffet, and a Food Court
 * Popular: Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak, Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill, & Shibuya
 * Shopping options including Sugar Factory and small boutiques
 * A large (of course) Race and Sports Book
 * The largest bronze statue in the U.S. - Leo the Lion near the LV Strip Entrance

What you won't find includes:
 * The Lion Habitat that closed in 2012
 * The Wizard of Oz theme from the 1990s
 * Anything truly outstanding or unique, but plenty that's a-ok
 * An escape from long walks between areas of the hotel

The MGM Grand Hotel is big. In fact, it's the biggest and most spread-out hotel you'll find anywhere. Rooms range between 3-4 stars. The accommodations are better than they were 5 years ago, but still kind of average hotel rooms ... which is no surprise when you think of the volume of rooms and people they must accommodate.

Three stars means a-ok and the MGM is exactly that ... a boring, but very BIG A-OK.

Buh, whaddaya mean you don't have chocolate cactus? ;p

Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden is a free & worthwile distraction when you want to be away from the Strip for awhile, but still close enough to head back to continue availing yourself of sinful debauchery and/or losing your entire savings account.  

The Cactus Garden greets visitors as they arrive.  When I went, I admittedly wasn't a huge cactus fan.  I dunno - maybe it's the spines, maybe it's the phallic looking Saguaro cactus.  Cactus just wasn't my cup of tea.  Ethel M has an assortment of cacti on display, which I've read are adorned with lights during the Holiday season.  My horticultural buddy, who collects cacti, has given me various fruiting cacti like the Peruvian Apple cactus, which has made me appreciate the hardy & resourceful cactus.  If I were to go back, I would look at the garden with a more loving glance.

The Chocolate Factory is a self-guided tour.  Visitors read the various displays on the voyage of a caocao bean into fancy packaging.  The highlight of course, free samples!  Halfway through the tour, visitors get their choice of sample - milk, dark or white chocolate.  I may have obtained a couple samples via a few well-timed out walkthroughs ;p  The tour ends in the chocolate shop, with the chocolates fetching a pretty hefty price.  Looking for more familiar choices?Then, on the left is.............

M&M's World!  Purveyor of all things M&M.  Lots of cute lil knickknacks for the M&M lover.  I remember seeing a chess set, which is pretty dope.  It was interesting to see all the items available to buy, but nothing that I wanted to take home.  Now, if they had M&M colored nipple stickers, then M&M's World would be in business.  I'm Asian, so they'd be milk chocolate M&M's ;p
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Overall, a cool free place to check out while you're in Vegas.

Recommend!

The year: 2010.
  
The episode: "Phoenix."

The Man: Adam Richman, himself.

The Challenge: Chompie's "The Ultimate Slider Challenge."

...12 Original Jewish Sliders: each one brisket-filled and gravy-drizzled, stacked as well with mini potato pancakes, Jack cheese, and onion strings.  Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.  Instead, I ordered the Combo.  And after tearing through an incredibly tasty two, alongside a cup of Matzo Ball soup, I was full.  Adam, however, he Manned-up!  Sadly, though, after a hard-fought battle, he--as many have before him--ultimately threw in the towel. The Challenge, it seemed, proved too hefty.  Food had won.

...However, if one, brave soul decides to accept this heaping challenge ($39.95) and conquers this plattered beast, it's free.  But not only that: upon winning, you will be forever immortalized on Chompie's "Hall of Fame" website (http://chompies.com/wall-of-fame/) and an "Ultimate Slider Challenge" T-shirt awaits you and your bragging self!! You bad!!  (By the way, there's no California representation on that website, zero, none, not one, nada...  Who'll step up?

This having been my first time to Chompie's, I was truly impressed!  A Yelp check-in offer allowed for a free bagel from their awesome deli/bakery; our very cool server, Trudy, brought out a few, free cookie samples for this first-timer; and our just-as-cool host made lunch suggestions, which we ordered verbatim.  As promised, those Sliders were "deli-icious."  And the Matzo Ball and Chicken soup hit the spot.  But I couldn't leave...not yet.  As full as I was, I couldn't head back to CA without first trying the carrot cake, could I?  I mean, you don't blame me, right?

So, "Man vs Food"...  That takes care of Phoenix: Alice Cooper'stown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/alice-cooperstown-phoenix?hrid=esDZwjuGZQlkpKrZAC_guQ), Los Reyes de la Torta (http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-reyes-de-la-torta-phoenix-2?hrid=nJiqRCfTtxs2bIoFrPdmkA), and now Chompie's.  On deck, LA.

I was here shopping in Scottsdale's Old Town just around lunch time. I got hungry so I checked the best place for lunch in the area on Yelp and found The Mission, was highly rated. It was across the street from where I was standing so we headed that way.

When we arrived we were able to get a table in the outside courtyard in the front of the restaurant. We informed the waiter we had very little time for lunch. The three of us ordered margaritas with salt at $8 each. They charged an extra $2 for one with Cointreu. We ordered two Almejas Al Vapor stews for $14 each and one shaved Kale salad for only $10. The shaved kale salad consisted of aji amarillo vinaigrette, baby heirlooms, blood orange, goat cheese & marcona almonds. My friend loves kale. The Almejas Al Vapor is a peruvian clam stew, rock shrimp, chorizo, pan de yucca, aji amarillo & roasted corn. I especially enjoyed the unusual appearance and spice of the stew. See my pic. The stew made me want to go to Peru for some more. I have never been to Peru. 

The waiter was very expeditious in serving us.

My total bill for the three of us for lunch was a very reasonable $69 without gratuities and we were all happy with our meals, margaritas and service.

They INTERPRETATE the music so well!!! 
(Holla at ABDC season 1 fans!)

It was very difficult keeping the show tickets a secret from my dude- a huge Jabba fan. Bought them about a month in advance, we got 3rd row seats for about $70.00 each. Pricey indeed, but it was so worth it to see them live, so close and their 1.5 hour show was packed to the brim with Jabba-ness. When i could finally reveal the big surprise of the tickets, we were full of giddy smiles the entire time. From the very entertaining preshow until the end, we were fully ENTERTAINED!!!! 
Actually reading some of the things in the negative reviews made me sad and little butt-hurt that they were not ENTERTAINED! These are no skinny lizards- but some of the baddest mofos i've ever seen dance. I didn't give a f*ck if some of the story was a little odd or didn't really make sense to me the whole time. I was just happy to see them recreate some of their ABDC performances as well as a whole slew of new routines. ABDC fans will recognize special guest appearances by SuperCr3W members, which was awesome. I loved the playfulness of the glow in the dark sequence, the oldskool segment and the Single Ladies ofcourse. I especially liked the KB solos and it was fun spotting the individuals behind their masks, like Phil's booty shaking and Rynan's impressive headspins. 

A MUST SEE for TRUE Jabbawockeez fans!!!
Great show for hip hop music/dance fans.
Hit or miss for those unfamiliar.

Get seats in the front or center aisle and you may get picked for audience participation!

Chocolate is the Chuck Norris of sweets. It is possibly the tastiest substance ever created by mankind. Sure, chocolate can cure hunger, but it can also be paired with any food, stop wars, and, in many cultures, is part of mating rituals. Chocolate is like sweet edible sex.

If you're still reading, you can stop now cause ... ya, I know ... "I had you at chocolate."

No sane person could turn down chocolate if offered. When my wife proposed going to Max Brenner at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace for dessert, she knew from my drool that I was no fool.

We were greeted at our table by a hyper server. Dude was clearly choco-rushin' and bouncin' off the walls. I loved his energy, but never did quite figure out what he was recommending. Does it matter? Chocolate is a synonym for "yum."

The Chocolate Fondue and Choctails were tempting (of course); however, we opted for Max's Fried Dough ($14.25). This sweet icon is one huge thin crispy plate of Fried Dough drizzled with Chocolate Chunks, Toffee, Chocolate Ice Cream, and Milk Chocolate Ganache. The animated server said there was no way the two of us could finish it ... I laughed and dove in with both hands. He knows this is chocolate, right? It's a messy and filling dessert designed for a whole family to share...or not share. (4 stars)

We also split a Chocolate Hazelnut Milkshake ($7.95) with Vanilla Ice Cream, Milk Chocolate Ganache, Chocolate Hazelnut Spread, Milk, and Whipped Cream. The shake was smooth, sweet, & superior. If Vincent in Pulp Fiction was surprised by a $5 milkshake imagine how he'd react to an $8 shake. Who needs vodka? It's got CHOCOLATE. I don't know if it's worth $8, but it's pretty f-in good! (4 stars)

Max Brenner, I don't know who you are, but I do love chocolate. So, yep, I'm a sucker ... and a fan ... cause there are only two kinds of people in this world, those who love chocolate ... and those who love chocolate, but won't admit it.

After surviving my first tornado scare in Madison, Wisconsin, my partner in crime, Daniel L. and I ventured out to this well known local BBQ hangout for some good old smoky ribs and all the fixings.

With the Midwest reputation of having some of the finest meats, it was a no brainer to order the 1/3 slab BBQ smoked ribs and pork shoulder sandwich combination dinner ($14.75). The staff mentioned the pork shoulder and the beef brisket were the top sellers besides the ribs.

The pork shoulder was pigilicious! The shredded meat was perfectly seasoned with the rub and then hickory smoked which gave its own taste without the addition of the BBQ sauce. It also impressed me because there were was no sign of grease on the pork. The bun was a standard bread bun compared to the sweet roll which accompanied the dinner combination. We took the recommendation of the staff and ordered the extra meat (additional 5 ounces for $3) since were feeling extra carnivorous! The BBQ pork ribs came with five succulent ribs with the meat just waiting to fall off the bone. Each bite had a generous coating of their famous award winning BBQ sauce. 

Our dinner combination came with two choices of side orders which we picked the baked beans and cole slaw. Both were served in a small styrofoam cups along with the BBQ sauce. It's easy to see why the BBQ sauce won numerous award because of it's rich, sweet and peppery flavor. I'm not a fan of cole slaw but this one exceed my expectations with its creaminess and was extra cold. The baked beans maintained a firm texture and should be ordered with any meal because the sauce was so addictive.

The cabin style interior holds 11 tables and is very close to the Madison airport. The actual BBQ pit is located a few miles away from the restaurant. So grab your dental floss and wet naps and eat some authentic BBQ at Smoky Jon's!

I was reading in my IBD yesterday that Zoe's Kitchen was going public today. So why not write a review.

My first experience with Zoe's Kitchen was a couple of years ago at a CMYE at this location. I thought it was good but unfortunately too far from the house or work. Well, since the office moved nearby, I go here about once a week.

I order the 2 Chicken Kabobs which comes with a Greek Salad, rice and a few very small pitas. I really enjoy this meal even though I think it's a bit too pricey. I saw a couple of dudes enjoying the Steak Kabobs the last time I was in there, so I'll probably order that next time.

The Brits have an expression, "Smart by half.' 

I was driving up Scottsdale Road and noticed this new location. I have been on Which Wich's mailing list for a while and remember getting a "Reverse Happy Hour buy one, get one free offer through August 15th" email .

I ordered two medium turkey sandwiches, with extra meat ($3.00 up charge) and a soda.  My thinking was that one would be free and the bill would be around $10.00 or so.  Instead I was told it would be $19.16. Seems the offer reads "order any regular size Wich and get the second Wich free".  Silly me.

The two mediums weighted almost two pounds each.  They felt really, really heavy.  I was impressed. But without that credit, it would have been nearly $27 for those two subs and one drink. Wow

So yesterday I thought I would try the same exercise, but with two "Regular" sized sandwiches.  Without ordering a drink, my bill came to $6.41 and the two subs combined weight barely a pound.

At this point I'm giving up on comparison tests. I'll be sticking to Jimmy Johns or Jersey Mike's.  BTW, both places were empty and it took nearly ten minutes to get my order. So maybe, "Subs, So Slow You'll Freak?" LOL

Sorry, Two Stars and  "Meh. I've experienced better."

"You better cut the pizza in four pieces because I'm not hungry enough to eat six."   Yogi Berra

Nothing beats a cheesy deep-dish pizza with all your beloved toppings.  That original pan crust is crazy delicious.  It's always busy here for a reason.  I personally love the BBQ Chicken.  If you grab it to go, make sure you toss some fresh cilantro on top for even more flavor.  Their wings are also incredible and they even throw some Parmesan on top of the Garlic Parmesan Wings for more cheesy-goodness.  Nello's pies are flavorful and packed full of calories so if you're on a diet, leave it outside and indulge.  This 30+ year-old award-winning establishment is made of love.

I think of dieting for the new year and then I eat Nello's pizza.  No shame.  No regrets.

Your mileage at Cartel will vary, based totally on your expectations and what you want in a cup of coffee.  If you are concerned about where your coffee beans are grown, how they are roasted, fair trade practices, and the difference between a French press and an aeropress, then this is definitely your place.  If you are looking for a coffee drink that involves a blender, whipped cream, and caramel drizzle, then you'll be disappointed.  I'm not judging either group, because depending on the day of the week I've been in both.  

The day we hit Cartel was for a much-needed caffeine injection.  The coffee menu is very limited, but iced Americano was front and center.  The barista informed me that even though that was a menu option, I was better off ordering an iced coffee that was cold brewed specifically for that purpose.   She went on to give me all of the nuances in great detail.  And she was right, it was an excellent choice.

They also offered homemade pop tarts, which were a must try for me.  They ended up being more like a frozen Pillsbury toaster strudel, just a lot greasier.  

If you're a coffee snob, this is a place you will love.  And rightfully so.  If you just want a cup of coffee and Cartel is closer than Dunkin' Donuts or 7-Eleven, then you may feel overwhelmed or intimidated.  The employees at this location don't do it on purpose, they are just very passionate about their coffee.  And that's never a bad thing.  Now the employees at the Cartel at the airport?  That's a different story, for a different review.

Every now and then I iron my clothes, brush my hair, and rock the high heels. But even when I do that, it's highly unlikely that you'll find me at Pure or Tryst or LAX or any other of the one word clubs on the strip. 

Here's where The Cosmopolitan comes in: I didn't stay here, but I can still get dressed up and feel like I'm being one of those girls, but I don't have to go to a club. They have two (maybe more, but at least two) really cool bars. You don't need table service. You don't need to have 80% ladies to get in. You don't have to pay a cover. They are just awesome bar/lounges.

Vesper, near the entrance is cool, but The Chandelier Bar was the real stunner. It's all schmancy, but the cocktails are about $10-$12, which isn't absolutely horrible for a schmancy joint. The service could be better, but they've got some interesting cocktails and the decor is just - AMAZING.

I love this place!  I noticed a lot of people there and wondered if it was worth the trip.  I wasn't disappointed.  On the day I went, I had a vegieburger and it was really good, came with a salad and blue chips. I brought half of it home and had the other half for dinner.  I also ordered a drink that was cherry and chocolate (delicious).  I am a big fan and would go more but it is a little expensive.  Also took a slice of the chocolate pomegranate cake (their signature dish) and it was really outstanding.  I shall return!

miX Lounge on the 64th floor of Mandalay Bay offers the best open-air panoramic views of the Las Vegas Strip. It opens at 5:00 p.m. and the night views are stunning. The restaurant and bar offer an upscale casual way to impress your date or your own eyes with all the lights & sparkles of Vegas over 400 feet below.

Olivia Z. and me stopped in miX before hitting the Michael Jackson ONE show cause it is very convenient to the theater. We were lucky cause there was no cover charge on Christmas Eve. After a quick ride up an express elevator, we eagerly hit the balcony to take in the mesmerizing view. Bring a camera and smiles.

After snapping a few pics, we headed inside and grabbed a seat at one of the many tables facing out. A waitress popped over in just a few seconds and our first round of drinks was on their way. miX Lounge is dark, but the menu is backlit and kind of cool. The faux leather seats and aluminum tables actually seem cool, too. 

Olivia started with a miXOPOLITAN ($16) with Absolut Citron, Cointreau, White Cranberry, Candied Lemon, and a string of Fresh Cranberries. It was sweet and refreshing at the same time. For round two, she switched to a Pear Martini ($18) recommended by the waitress. It features Grey Goose La Poire, Champagne, St. Germain, and a Pear Slice. Much like Olivia, this was even sweeter than the first drink. She liked them both.

For me, I was recovering from the previous night's drinking binge and stuck with some beers. Both were fine and $9: Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale and Sierra Nevada Kellerweis.

This review is strictly for the miX Lounge (not miX Restaurant) and the beautiful views from the outdoor patio.
 - Service was stellar. 
 - Drinks were decent.
 - The vibe was cool.
 - The view was dazzling.

It's time to add miX Lounge to the mix of must see attractions in Las Vegas.

I used to think this venue was named for the dress size of girls in minidresses who lined up to get their butt cheeks stamped in exchange for free admission.  But, after making my way here last Monday, I'm guessing the name stands for Excess.

Because they spared no expense, friends.  This place is huge, the vibe is sexy, and the people are as beautiful as money can buy.  Especially on a Monday in Las Vegas.  It's industry night, so expect to shake it harder for free perks.  

We arrived shortly before Midnight and paid a cover charge ($20 for me; $30 for him).  Then, on a hunch, I dropped my name to a dude with a clipboard, he checked the guestlist (sign up free on the Wynn's website to be contacted soon by a promoter: http://www.encorelasvegas.com/#/nightlife/xs_reservations/) and then REIMBURSED us for the cover charges.  That's right, they said, "you shouldn't have to pay" and actually put $50 BACK on our card... which paid for a few vodka sodas for yours truly.

A cute gal wandered around with tequila and vodka-guava shooters.  Might want to ask how much they are in advance, since $12 a pop adds up when you offer to buy a round for your friends.

Fun Tip: Find the Las Vegas Weekly photographer on premises and get yourself featured in the online photo album here: http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/photos/2010/jan/26/128774/

We danced until 3am to hip hop mash-ups and had a blast.  Warm vibe from everyone on the indoor/outdoor dance floor - which helps when you fall on your face from 4.5" heels that weren't intended to be walked in and need strangers to pull a Humpty Dumpty and get you upright again.  Hypothetically.

Five divinely XSessive stars.

So as 4 of us were waiting in line to buy tickets at 9:15pm on a Sunday, a random, friendly girl gave us three tickets and in a flash she was gone.  We were in total disbelief.  I was still skeptical up to the part where they scanned the ticket.  Saved us $111!!  I owe her some Sprinkles at the very least if we ever cross paths again.  

Currently the largest observatory wheel in the world (wonder how much of a pain it will be when it becomes the 2nd), there's not much to say about the ride itself.  You go around for 30 minutes, see the strip, snap pics and it's over.  The waiting area before getting to the actual wheel is very Disney Worldesque.  

The "guide" is a guy on a video screen dishing out facts and bad jokes (420 ft! You're really high!!).   I wonder why they didn't have different performers from Caesars shows doing video segments instead?  Imagine what the Gazillionaire and Penny would say?!  They could do the "quiet tour" with Teller.

The biggest variable with how enjoyable your ride will be are the others in your pod.  Each pod is supposed to fit 40 people.  I saw a family with 5 small and loud kids on their rollerskate sneakers in front of us and I would have done almost anything to avoid being in the same pod including lighting myself on fire.  We rode with about 20 others that were fine and excited to be on the ride.  

Other things:

- Try to go for the seats on the immediate right upon getting into the pod.
- Nighttime has to be better than daytime.  
- Please go to the restroom before getting on.

At the very last minute before driving to Lost Wages, I booked a single room at the Microtel Inn & Suites ($70 on Orbitz).  Having never heard of the chain, I pretty much felt I was rolling the dice with this one.  But since no true tourist in Lost Wages ever spends more than a few hours in the room, I figured, what the hell?  It can't be any dingier than my last stay at Excaliber.

Well, this joint (obviously new or newly remodeled) is light years ahead of the MGM, Excaliber, and even the Mirage in cleanliness and the bed and pillows are waaaay more comfortable.  Rooms are modest, but decor and amenities are up-to-date and modern.  Amenities range from flat screen Vizios, microwaves and even a mini fridge to store your booze in to drink before hitting the casinos.  They even do free breakfast until 9:30am!

However, the BEST part about this hotel is that it's 100% NON SMOKING, so you don't get that nasty smoke stench that (despite Febreeze) seeps into the walls, carpet and draperies over time (*ahem MGM!).  It's also a few miles just south of the main strip off of Las Vegas Blvd with simple, no hassle parking right in front.  This makes it super mellow for getting in and out.

Overall, I highly recommend this place if you 1) want to save on cash, 2) don't mind staying outside the strip, and 3) want a non-smoking, super mellow place to get in and out of during your weekend of ephemeral debauchery.

Note:  No King beds.  They only do Queen Sized.  Check out is at 12pm (not 11am like most hotels on the strip)!

I hate writing a bad review for an Asian-American owned business, but I feel it is my obligation to advocate for future patients who may suffer from neglectful and unethical practices.

Everything went wrong from the very beginning. At Medical and mental health clinics, it's not common to find unempathetic and distant desk workers. They somewhat need to act like this as a risk management strategy due to the fact that we now live in the era of HIPPA thanks to Slick Willy. But, the attitude at PROCARE was excessively cold and they facilitate an atmosphere which may lead patients to believe that they are at a for-profit clinic that only cares about billing and not your recovery. Funny thing was that when they found out I was a yelper, they started kissing my ass. Suddenly, HIPPA no longer existed and I was a VIP. 

My main issue was due to some of the unethical practices. The Dr. did not see me for more than 2 minutes, and made a rushed assessment. I was prescribed a medication which my body had a severe reaction to. I called the next day, and the uninterested front desk worker told me to "take benadryll" and go on with my life. When I explained the severity of the symptoms, she invited me back for a follow up visit, "FREE OF CHARGE". When I arrived the next day, the front desk girl said that I could not see the Dr. unless I paid. Remember that this is a for-profit clinic, and billing and making money is their number one concern. I was in severe pain due to the adverse reaction from the medication, so I just paid the money and saw the same Dr. The Dr. informed me that I couldn't prove that the medication was causing these adverse symptoms and he claimed I had an unrelated virus that was causing my symptoms. He then prescribes me an "anti-viral" drug and sends me on my way. When I went to the Pharmacist, the Pharm.D(Doctor of Pharmacology) told me that the "anti-viral" medication that was prescribed to me was not in any way an anti-viral medication and that I was given false information. She explained to me that the so called anti-viral medication was a steroid used to treat inflammation from drug-induced side effects. The same drug induced side effects I was experiencing from the prescription medication that  PROCARE claimed was not causing the adverse reaction. I now wanted to get a second opinion so I went to my usual MD in Summerlin who told me that the drug originally prescribed to me has side effects which are absolutely relevant to the symptoms I was experiencing(blistering rash, troubles breathing, swelling eyes, flu-like symptoms, swollen lips and tongue). The MD also expressed that the misleading information that PROCARE gave me could possibly have been an unethical risk-managment strategy. 

I believe the dishonesty and unethical practices are a consequence of the Dr's educational background. I did some research after all of this happened to me. If you google PROCARE's Dr, you will see that he went to an unaccredited medical school which is headquartered oversees, and he got his undergrad in South America. Most states including California, Maine, Oregon, Texas, New York and Indiana declare this medical school an "Institution Whose Degrees are Illegal to Use" or "not recognized or disapproved medical school to practice in state." Nevada is one of the only states that allows graduates from this school to practice. Even the BBC states that the medical school is only operational due to a "loophole which allows them to operate unregulated". These foreign schools recruit many from the US, and present an unaccredited scam-degree. I know from experience, years ago I fell for a scam law program which was headquartered oversees. Every time you see a professional with one of these oversees degrees, just walk away.

I am sensitive to the fact that medical doctors do make mistakes and misdiagnose at times, and the Dr. and nurses are actually very nice... but I am more dissatisfied over the  unethical billing procedures where they led me on to believe the follow up appointment was free to trick me into making the 20 mile drive over there.

When somebody writes about a laundromat and says, "I love this place" and "This is the Cadillac of laundromats", then that is the kind of laundromat for me!  

My stupid washer decided to crap out on the Sunday between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, so by the time I bought a new washing machine I had to wait 10days to get my washer delivered!! Boo!  Of course I had been out of town three times in the last three weeks so I had a monstrous load of laundry and my dog was sick so I had some nasty smelling towels, so I decided I just needed to suck it up and venture to a laundromat.  After lots of Yelp searches, review reading and phone calls to laundromats I decided on Eco Laundry.  My research paid off!  

Eco Laundry has lots of washers with multiple capacities:  

1load washer- $1.25
2 load washer- $2.50
3 load washer- $3.75
5load washer- $4.50
6load washer- $6.00

They are all arranged in a very organized fashion with large signs to help you find what you are looking for.  

They also have two sizes of driers: 

Standard load dryer:  $0.25 for 8minutes I believe
50lb load commercial drier: $0.50 for initial 4minutes and I think $0.25 for every additional 4 after it starts.

Since I was making the trek to the laundromat, I decided to do my comforter and all my dog's blankets and stuff.  I had around 10-12 loads that I washed and dried for about $30 in 2hours!  Honestly the most pain in the butt part of it was unloading it and putting it all away when I made it home!

As far as the interior goes it was as pleasant as a laundromat could be.  Brightly lit room with Flat screen TVs throughout, clocks on the walls, stocked up vending machine, soap machine, and coin dispenser.  Oh and FREE wifi!  The cleanliness was far superior than any other laundromat I have been in.  The bathroom is kept locked, which I assume is for cleanliness and anti-loitering reasons, but you can easily ask the attendant for the key. Speaking of the attendants, they have great customer service!  When I called and while I was there, the attendants were very informative and pleasant.  The clientele was a combo of college students, a few couples and some randoms doing larger household items like comforters.  I ended up meeting a very pleasant couple from NYC and we chatted while we handled our laundry.  All around I have absolutely no complaints.  If I ever need a laundromat  in the valley of the sun, Eco Laundry will forever be my spot!   

Oh and make sure to bring cash!  All machines operate on quarters only.

EDIT 12/2/2014: Chef Hong no longer works there.  Booooooo

I will definitely be a regular now that Chef Hong (ex-Moko) is bringing out his inventive dishes at Kanji.  The former Geisha House location comes off like an Epcot Center restaurant for Japanese food.  The multiple teppanyaki stations, large sushi bar, block wood furniture, full bar, high ceilings and bright lights are very welcoming.  The complimentary sake bomb (one of the best Yelp check-in offers currently) only enhance that feeling.  

Like an amazing movie sequel (very rare), all of Hong's beloved edible characters are here: beef short ribs, 30 hour pork belly, shrimp risotto, in-house smoked fish etc.  They're now being presented with some new and interesting twists from his original, wizardly recipes.  What stay consistent are the flavors, quality and creativity.  There are also some new plates like the excellent miso glazed Chilean seabass and 7 hour pork shoulder.  Seriously.....find me a local sushi joint that's pushing out entrees like these and I will wear a Britney Spears shirt for a week.  

They don't offer AYCE sushi, but the nigiri I've tried has been of excellent quality.  We were informed that they receive fresh shipments every two days which is pretty remarkable.  Kanji also offers a killer late night happy hour from 10pm-2am Monday through Saturday that I plan on checking out pretty soon.

In an attempt to limit my time spent on slot machines and card tables, I yelped some alternate gaming fun and this place is at the top of the list for many good reasons. Thanks Tim S.

It sits in a pretty unassuming building  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RTv9HeRRtedgQ6xqjew82A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw  not far off the strip and you'd miss it if it weren't for this sign.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pinball-hall-of-fame-las-vegas?select=W7vtQ82-joiNSjazm8LrEA#W7vtQ82-joiNSjazm8LrEA  Walk inside and its like you've been transported into pinball heaven.

vintage games from the 70's (and earleir)  thru present. I was stoked to find a bunch of killer games from my youth. The only favorite I did not find was Evel Knievel, but it didn't matter 'cause I found all these gems, and many more. 

I've always been a fan of Rock & Roll and pinball games. Much love to PHOF!

Cap't Fantastic and The Brown Dirt Cowboy 1975 classic game!

But the coolest thing about this place is the owner Tim Arnold who has donated over $500,000.00 to the salvation Army and other local charities from the proceeds of the Pinball HOF. He is one righteous dude. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=fHHakES3UchMp8t11WI36Q&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw so bring your dollars and exchange them for quarters and tons of fun and help out those in need at the same time.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pinball-hall-of-fame-las-vegas?select=Joz7Y64GdxAcDL_tu59kWA#Joz7Y64GdxAcDL_tu59kWA

Another awesome Cirque du Soleil show.  This one features acrobatic performers and water.  I'm always amazed at how they can pull off all of these moves in such an elegant and choreographed way.  My hat's off to the performers!

I don't want to give away too much, but this show will simply amaze you.  It's worth seeing more than once.  There's no way I can keep my eye on everything going on.  Every time I see this show I see something different.

Definitely worth the time and money while you're in Vegas.  When out of town visitors ask me what show to see when they're in Vegas, I mention this one as one of the Top 5 in town.

Will I return?  Can't wait for the next time!

Recognize the chef?  Bravo's Top Chef contestant, consulted for XXX, worked at world class YYY, Michelin Chef ZZZ says he's "the greatest thing since boiled chicken".  Celebrity chef or otherwise, food must speak for itself.

Dishes are artfully presented.  Portions are very small for the price.  Flavors run from boring to interesting to "delicious but" to bizarre.  Examples:

Watermelon salad with goat cheese, a classic, is very refreshing but could benefit from a drizzle of aged balsamic to boost sweetness and complexity.  The hint of wasabi does nothing.  The watermelon lacked the "in season" fruity goodness.  Boring.

Quinoa fried rice with sun dried pineapple and tofu is intriguing.  Good first bite but unless you are a quinoa lover, the texture of the and nutty flavor of the grain quickly becomes one dimensional.  The pineapple lacks the acidic punch to brighten the dish.  Interesting.

The roasted duck breast is delicious.  Perfectly cooked, mid rare.  Mineral duck flavors enhanced by the honey.  A great side of grilled baby bok choy to add bitterness and crunch.  Just be sure to scrape off the ridiculous addition of children's breakfast cereal.   Blood soaked Kix.  Really?  Delicious but.

Miso toffee ice cream.  Wait for it.... Disgusting.  The first bite is good,  but with each successive bite, the miso flavor builds to the point your brain tells you not to swallow.  Fermented ice cream.  Bizarre.

Very small selection of micro brews.  Nice selection of sake.  High off Strip prices.

Bottom line, the food is not for everyone.  There are many better options for more globally accepted creativity.  You're better off looking to the Strip for excellence.

I've been here a few of times with friends, and like the food very, very much.

There is a reason, there are over 500 plus Chicago style (Italian Beef & or Hot Dog) places in Chicagoland and why no one can agree.  

You have Al's Beef, Super Dawg, Gold Coast, Luke's, Joey's, Portillo's, U Dawg U, Little Louie's, Michael's Red Hot, and so on, and so forth.  

Just for fun, type-in: "Italian Beef" into Yelp's Chicago search engine and see all the choices.  I was surprised that the computer didn't crash, and that was just for "Italian Beef", try "Hot Dog" afterwards, too.

So, is it truly a wonder why several Chicago-ites cannot agree on what a good Chicago place is here in the Valley of the Sun?  

What Chicago Hamburger does best, can be found in their name.  Hamburgers!  More specifically, Sliders!

If you have ever been to a White Castle, then you know what a Slider is.  Sorry for ending in a preposition. 

Imagine what a good All Beef Slider would taste like if you used quality meats and put more then 1 oz of meat on a bun.  Now you know all you need to know about Chicago Hamburger Company!   And, the price for this Windy City Slider?  $0.99!

Oh, one additional item -- you need to get here early or late, because the kids start arriving from school around 11:30, and CHC has a ridiculously tiny parking lot.  You've been warned!

So run, don't walk to Chicago Hamburger Company for their Windy City Slider, or to Al's Beef for a great Italian Beef or Luke's for a great Hot Dog.  I call that a division of labor.

Enjoy!

"My eyes adored you,
Though I never laid a hand on you,
My eyes adored you.
Like a million miles away from me,
you couldn't see,
How I adored you.
So close, so close and yet so far." - "My Eyes Adored You", Frankie Vallie & the 4 Seasons

I loved "Jersey Boys"!!  The musical retelling of how the group last known as "The 4 Seasons" came to be, starting at the humble beginnings of standing underneath a streetlamp in New Jersey.  I'm a big fan of Franki Valli's music & getting to see how he became the multimillion selling, international hit singer had me hooked from the moment the lights came on.

The actor who portrayed Frankie Valli was dynamite!!!.  He hit those high notes like a champ.  To me, he resembled the Brazilian race car driver, Helio Castroneves.  The supporting cast also did a magnificent job during the show.  We had primo seats, 5 rows from the stage, in Row D.  Looking around, all the seats seem to have a good view, but I must say I loved my vantage point.  

FYI, there is typical "Jersey talk" used during the show, aka profanity, & there is also some gun action/blood.  Therefore, I wouldn't recommend taking the little ones.  There is an 8 minute intermission with a handy countdown timer displayed on the stage, for those wanting to make sure they get back just in time.

I defy anyone not to sing along & have the catchy songs of Frankie Valli & the 4 Seasons in their head for the rest of the night & the day after, as well.  I immensely enjoyed "Jersey Boys" at Paris Las Vegas from beginning to end.

I highly recommend you come & catch a performance of one of the greatest shows on The Strip!

This is the busiest Walgreens I ever been to, there are good reason why.  First of is located in the Las Vegas Strip, it between Palazzo and Venetian.  Just next to the popular Tao Night Club.  This is the place to get you food, water and other important items restocked.  Eating and drinking is pricey in the Strip, you can save tons of money just shopped here, and just aware that most hotel in the strip does not had microwave or the fridge unless you got a suite type of room.

Price is slight higher than what you fight in most other Walgreen, but is understand since the high cost of the strip in general, even a foot long subway cost $10, but you still manage to find 99 cents Arizona Tea in here.   If you wanted to eat a nice buffet later of the day, this is good place to get you breakfast and late night snack fix without had to spend much.  Save those money can use more in party and gamble =)

Encore Beach Club is G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S. Kaskade Sundays is what's up. Like Wet Republic and Rehab, it's all about scene and be seen - you will be surrounded by beautiful bodies. Unlike Wet and Rehab, you will NOT be afraid to get into the pool! 

Mr. Wynn did an amazing job getting this luxurious beach club built in a matter of months. It's located at the front of Encore - I don't even recall them being under construction when I was there in April. The layout is beautiful with three pools and two levels of cabanas, and rainfall "cages" with a stripper pole in the center if you want to show off your skills. 

Kaskade definitely brings the party on Sundays, but the vibe is definitely more chill than Wet and Rehab (hence the cleaner pools). He's set up right in the middle in front of Surrender (the nightclub) and there's a small area for people to dance. 

We got in for free (doesn't hurt to know the promoters), however cover is $30 for women and $50 for men. You'll easily drop $100+ on drinks, so you might want to consider reserving a lounge chair ($150 drink minimum) or if you can splurge, reserved a day bed or cabana (some with your own personal see-through pool), which will run you thousands. Otherwise you can grab a towel and post up along the edge of the pool.

There are two bar areas, a few tables to gamble and "The Grill" to order food. Share a few salads, which are huge, and the turkey club wrap - the more healthy options on the menu. Food babies are not attractive here.

I stopped in for lunch to check out this new pizza place. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta used to be here. I recognized the girl at the register when I walked in, so I asked her if they just changed the name, but she said that Mark Rich's recipes transferred over when the new owners bought the business in this location. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta still currently operates another location, using the same recipes and ingredients, but has nothing at all to do with Giani's NY Pizza and Pasta.

I ordered the lunch special for $5.95 which was 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The pizza slices were a good size. I didn't care for the pizza though. They might be using the same recipe the previous owner used, but it doesn't mean it comes out the same and it just didn't for me. The pizza was somewhat burnt and had a stale taste to it like maybe it was from the day before. This is a real disappointment for me because I regularly shop in the shopping center Giani's is in and enjoyed stopping for pizza. Good thing "Above the Crust" is just around the corner though on Ann Rd so there still is a solid pizza joint in the neighborhood I can go to.

We were sooo happy when Sam Fox opened one of his Zinburgers here in Scottsdale Quarter.  Our taste buds leaped for joy.  

We've always enjoyed their Biltmore location. And even though the service here could be better and the location enlarged, the burgers were...  great. 

We returned last evening for our fourth visit. I would plan on a thirty minute wait, but that will allow you to hit some of the nearby stores. The time went by quickly, with a band playing in the promenade.  Nice!

We started off with their yummy fried zucchini sticks ($7.00), adding the Chipotle Mayo dip to the Ranch was a great idea. I decided to try their Kale Caesar ($4.50). It was good, but needed a little more dressing. 

As for our burgers, we ordered the Breakfast ($12.50) open face and their house Zin($10.50).  Mine had an fried egg on top, with applewood bacon,
avocado, cheese, lettuce and mayo; while the Zin had manchego cheese, yummy zinfandel Braised Onions with lettuce and mayo.  Both were delicious.

I believe the secret to Zinburger is how they make their burgers.  Rather compacting the chopped meat and squeezing out all the air pockets. They form them gently. That way the smoky taste permeates the meat.

Expect to pay $20 each plus taxes and gratuities, including soft drinks and one appetizer or small salad each.

Enjoy!

For brunch we decided to come to  Bouchon, and it didn't disappoint. From the get-go the service was top-notch. Our( forgot his name) waiter did an amazing job. He explaining the special they had that day and for his services. But I had to give it to the manager Jonathan. He was so professional,and friendly. He kept on coming by to our table and asking if the food  tasted to our likening. 
As for the food their pastries were fabulous. It was fresh and was  still nice and warm, and not to sweet. Highly recommend the pastrie platter.
The special omelette with skirt steak and potato was just ok. Nothing to fancy  about it.
Their chicken and waffle is a must try dish. The chicken was so moist and well season. The waffle with bacon bits and chives was awesome.
In the end it was a great brunch, and amazing service from start to finish.
Thank you again Jonathan for your hospitality, and your staff for an excellent service, and the wonderful food.

I like Firehouse Subs for their premium tasty sandwiches, they're absolutely outstanding!  

Recently I've found it somewhat harder to swallow their premium prices.

Years ago, the late Clara Peller became famous for her TV commercial "Where's the Beef?", while complaining at a burger place called, "Home of the Big Bun".

While Firehouse isn't that bad, they are close and Which Wich isn't too far behind either for the same reason.  I'm tired of trying to figure out who is giving out 3oz, or 4oz of deli meat on their subs.  

What I truly enjoy is a creative, well made sandwich, that has er, some beef on it, or in Firehouse's case, some meat.  

Quiznos went though bankruptcy, I believe because they forgot that consumers could see them weighing the meat on a scale, and then removing a slice or two when it was too much.

Okay, here's my beef (pun intended).  A group of us came here for lunch and universally found our checks in the $11.00 range.  So that's a sandwich 12" long, meat, chips and a drink.  How much does a 1/4 lb of the most expensive deli meat cost at Fry's or AJ's?

Sadly, we've found it easier just going to Jimmy Johns down on Chandler Boulevard, asking for double meat and paying $9.50 for the same setup.

I give the manager of this location high marks for draining the liquid from the heated pastrami/corn beef NY Steamer after it came out of the oven.  I was in a Firehouse in Florida recently where they forgot to do this and the sandwich just a mushy mess.

In summary, "Yes, I am a Fan" of Firehouse Subs, particularly for all the local Outreach they do for our Bravest. But I only hope they consider taking their thumb off the scale and put some real meat on those sandwiches. 

Enjoy!

Michelin Stars #20, 21, and 22

Let me start by answering your questions;

"No" and "No."

For my 30th birthday present, my wife treated me (us) to our first 3 star dining experience. My hopes were sky-high as we rode in our complimentary limo ride into the back of the MGM. We were escorted through the private baller area of the casino to the main entrance of the restaurant. Once inside, we were greeted with what might happen if you filled Barney the Dinosaur with gold and velvet and then blew him up, a purple pantheon of out-of-placeness. 

Of course, when having a once in a lifetime meal, you never order a la carte, you go all out with the 16 course degustation menu. Which leads me to some of my major gripes of the meal; the amuse was counted as a course, there were no intermezzos, apritifs and digestifs to break up the heavy French food, and the amazing cheese cart was not part of the tasting!

I lack the energy to describe each course in detail as I often do, but most of it was really really good. A couple were jaw droppingly good, yet others were only okay, and only okay for any place. For the price and the reputation, I expected so much more. I expected the foie gras to shed new light on the start of the universe and for the veloute to show me god, but no epiphanies were had that night. 

Service was spot on, never smothering or pretentious, and the wine guy guided us well. The pre-dinner bread and separate butter carts were equally amazing. 

For the money though, we both agreed that we would choose Urasawa, Spago, or Providence in a heartbeat for another meal. 

So now for your questions;
Was it worth it? NO
Would we go back? NO

PS - No good pictures because my old cybershot took a shit that day, so I bought a Sony Nex-3 and had no idea how to use it for dinner =[

I drank the punch, now after five visits, I'm either have an addiction or I'm a fan.

From the city that invented a Fre Kin Gud sushi roll and yum yum sauce springs Yonaka Modern.  The food is playful.  A fusion of Japanese / Peruvian / Argentinian cuisine popularized by Nobu Matsuhisa.  From the flavors to the presentation, this is the poor man's Matsuhisa (Beverly Hills, LA).  Oh yeah, it's good!

Dishes deliver a punch.  No monochromatic plates here.  Bold flavors that try to push the boundaries of sweet, sour, bitter in a single dish.  Excellent use of texture.  It is not uncommon to have a deep fried leaf sitting atop a piece of delicate fish.

Order an assortment of small plates and share.  

I won't ruin the "joy of discovery", besides the menu changes as specials come and go.  One day, teriyaki foie nigiri topped with candied quinoa, live uni another,   The menu staple, deep fried Brussels sprouts with lemon, chili, mint, and puffed rice is amazing.  It looks a mess but as a dish, it's comforting. Vegetal, sweet, sour, bitter; the perfect match to beer.  Ingredients are fresh and seasonal.

All nigiri sushi comes with a twist.  A sauce of this, an unusual garnish of that (hamachi with a spicy jalapeo miso and a cilantro leaf; unagi with togarashi and a leaf of Thai basil).  The rice is good and the fish fresh. Go crazy, order one of each.

Service is very good; friendly and attentive.  Prices are very reasonable.  Two happy hours (17:00-18:30 / 23:00-02:00) make it even more inviting.

One of the best in Vegas on or off the Strip.

I'm sure this place is a great hike. However, I've only been to this mountain for the Lori Piestewa Memorial Services. And that is what this review is about.

I remember what it was like when Lori Piestewa was declared a prisoner or war and how my family got calls from Hopi inlaws asking us to pray in our way for her safe return. There were many things online, in our newspapers and on tv - we were so afraid. And then the inevitable came, the news we didn't want to hear.

I don't know if any of ya'll know this, but Tuba City and the Hopi Nation are small places. Both are tight knit communities where everyone knows one another. And the devistation felt by her loss was incredible. I remember a cousin of mine recalled it as "you could hear the cries in the streets". Every Native in the country probably went to bed hungry that night in honor of her.

And as for the name Squaw. I always knew it was bad. It was something you never said,  you never needed to say it. It was always something terrible. Once when I asked my grandfather what it meant he said "a terrible, terrible woman who's unfit to get married." I later learned that it meant, to his tribe, a women who was raped as a child and was deemed no longer fit to bear children. That was the interrpretation I grew up with and that is how I equate it today. I know of the mainstream meaning of that word, as a derogitory term for a vagina. But know that different tribes view it differently. but all meanings are terrible.

I've only been called a squaw once. and unfortunatly, that person knew what it meant and used it in that context. And inspite of my education, eloquence and empathy - I was nothing but a mere squaw to this person and to this state and so was it's mountian. And I gotta admit, it stung a little to hear Squaw Peak Freeway or Squaw Peak used so... lightly. 

It was a wonderful day to hear Governor Napalitano decide to change the name to honor Lori Piestewa. I found it ironic and fitting. An elder once said, "Jessica may have gotten a movie, but Lori got a mountain!" And though she lost her life fighting for the freedoms of all Americans, she won a major battle in the war against using hurtful names from Indian Country's past to casually name things such as: mountains, sports teams, etc.

This little indian girl who cried when she heard that Woman Warrior died is now a young woman who does what she can to push for change in America - and a big part of what inspires me and other women of color (not just natives) was the renaming of this mountain. This Peak is more than just a place for a great hike, it's the beginning of a movement. I have never forgotten that everytime I've traveled to it's base to honor the woman who inspired the change. And I know this woman, where ever she is, smiles down knowing her daughter doesn't have to live in the same world where she once did - where Native women were constantly being cursed at when asked for directions. Where signs all over a city sliced through you like knives. Where you'd try not to whince whenever a non-native on TV spoke about the traffic. It's a wonderful world, I only wish Lori could see it.

What a spiritual, uplifting Catholic Community!

From the opening notes of the hymn, "All are welcome in this place", I knew how special Saint Patrick's was to me.

"Let us build a house
where love can dwell
And all can safely live,
A place where
saints and children tell
How hearts learn to forgive."

There are so many things I want to share about coming here for 5 pm Mass. First is coming into their sacred space and hearing a first class Choir and musicians practicing . Their group also includes a pianist, a person on Keyboard and a very young College age drummer.  They were great, and not just for the practice, but throughout the service. They all worked well together and didn't overwhelm the senses. The music of Paul Hillebrand and the heavenly voice of their Cantor Jill Bagshaw are incredible and needs to be experienced to be appreciated.  

"Let us build a house where prophets speak,
And words are strong and true,
Where all God's children dare to seek
To dream God's reign anew."

Second is the friendly parishioners who sat around me, including some long time friends. Even though Father Eric was away on vacation, the folk at Saint Patrick's didn't seem to miss a beat. Their ministry to the poor of spirit here in the valley is well known, particularly their efforts at Justa Center.  But it's also the nearly four dozen other ministries, where they offering themselves as the hands and body of Christ, which makes you realize how special this community is.

"Let us build a house where love is found
In water, wine and wheat:
A banquet hall on holy ground,
Where peace and justice meet."

I've come to Mass here many times and the Liturgy is wonderful. I have never felt this way in any other Catholic Church.  It is so moving, to stand up and have the entire church hold hands for The Lord's Prayer, and I do mean everyone. It's special and I only wish I could convey how moving it is to feel the spirit in this church when it happens. It's just amazing to have over five hundred members standing, holding hands and reciting not a prayer by rote, but with feeling and love that makes it so special. 

"Here the love of God, through Jesus,
Is revealed in time and space;
As we share in Christ the feast that frees us:

All are welcome, all are welcome,
All are welcome in this place."

Hated it.
Yes, it was cheap. Yes, it's centrally located. Yes, it's disgusting.

A couple of friends and I went for a turn around trip to Vegas for the night. We knew we weren't going to spend that much time in the room because we were there to eat and play some tables. Who knew that we weren't going to spend that much time in the room because we didn't want to be in it? Granted, yes- it was off season and we only spent $15 for the room- but I wish I would have spent $15 more to stay at one of the nicer hotels. We were being cheap, and we paid for it.

I knew it was an older hotel, but come on... a little updating (and cleaning) wouldn't hurt, would it? Being on the main strip next to all of these other nicer hotels, you would think they would try to up their amenities a little. At least run a steam cleaner over the effing carpets.

It took forever to find the check-in from the garage. There was a place that looked like a front desk, but wasn't really a front desk? A maintenance person had to tell us where to go. Check-in was fun, too. The lady pulled out a map that looked like something from an Indiana Jones adventure and proceeded to draw our route to the room. We were really confused when we had to exit the hotel to get to our room. WTF. There was a separate section that resembled a Motel 6 from the 70's. That's where our room was.

Upon opening the door, we were greeted by more dilapidated furniture, stale air and heavily stained carpet. Either someone had a crazy orgy in here before us- or there was a homicide. Needless to say- I waited until I got home to shower and I refused to take off my shoes.

Yes, it's cheap. But spring a little more for a nicer room regardless if you're just there to party. I'd hate to wake up face down on that carpet.

Friends ask: What's your favorite car?

I say: Hands down, super cars!  Who doesn't drool for the exotics?!

Friends go on to tell me that there's a track in which you can drive them as fast as you want, yadda yadda. 

Me: No Brainer! Of course I want in!!
 
If you can't be behind the wheel for whatever reason, hey, you can be a back-seat driver! As I was waiting for my turn I saw a few people riding as a passenger alongside a real race car driver.  I felt their excitement just by looking at their expressions as they got out of the car. They sure got the ride of a lifetime! 

Most of the employees here are a friendly bunch. They know what they are doing and seem to enjoy their jobs. The owner was on duty that day and noticed we were waiting for quite a while, so they offered my friend a free upgrade and tried to move things along as fast as possible. He paid for the regular Ferrari and got to drive the scuderia instead. I notice that they keep adding more and more cars to their garage! How I wished they had a McLaren when I was there!

Okay, okay. I'll leave you all with a cheesy picture. Here's a photo of me in a ridiculous helmet but in a white lambo:

I've had the chance to visit Hakkasan and XS this past weekend and let me tell you that XS completely blows it out of the water on almost every level.  Sure Hakkasan has exclusive contracts with deadmau5, tiesto, and calvin harris but XS' 2013 residency lineup is nothing to scoff at: Porter Robinson, Knife Party, Avicii, Steve Angello, Eric Prydz, Afrojack, etc.   But an amazing club experience from a consumer's standpoint is more than just who comes on the decks at 1:30AM.  

There are a plethora of factors, both tangible and intangible, that these new clubs neglect that ultimately leads me to the conclusion that XS remains the best club in Las Vegas over Hakkasan and Marquee.  Here are a few reasons:

1) Hakkasan should be renamed Hakkastairs due to the massive amount of stairs that you cannot avoid and you MUST take to even get into the main dance floor.  This is also a major problem with Marquee's presale line as you HAVE to walk up like 10 flights of stairs to get to the main dance floor.  Have fun with that in your 5 inch heels ladies.

2) No outdoor patio area?!?!  Is this real life?  No pool? What is this 2006?

3) No gambling section?!?  No water fountain??  No I don't want to pay 9 dollars for your bottle of water.  And give me the option to play blackjack and lose $1000 but at least I get a couple free drinks.

4) With XS and Marquee, when you have a presale ticket, you never have to wait more than 10-15 minutes.   Hakkasan's presale line took approximately 1 hour. 

5) No re-entry stamps at Hakkasan....seriously?  But what if its just me and a couple of my guy friends and we get there at 9:00PM just to get stamps with the intention of coming back at a more reasonable Vegas club time at 11:30ish?  

6) Hakkasan was such a letdown that my friends and I left before the headliner even came on.  Hakkasan is like a nicer marquee (inside only as there is no outside to hakkasan).  To Hakkasan's credit, they have a very spacious dance floor and their production value of their lights and lazers is unmatched but a club experience is more than that and XS beats Hakkasan down badly when it comes to every other relevant factor

7) I've heard that Hakkasan charges 43% on top of your table minimum... Now I see how they are paying abnormally above market prices for deadmau5, tiesto, and calvin harris.  This is absurd.

Unfortunately the hype for Hakkasan was too big since it was supposed to be the XS killer but just like Marquee, they both fall very short of the top tier in which XS stands alone.

Now we get to see Light take its shot on Memorial Weekend.

TLDR; Hakkasan was overhyped and I was very underwhelmed.  XS remains the best nightclub hands down for a variety of factors.

Review #300.  

Fishes welcome!  OOPS.  Freudian slip.

When you grind for a living, you can't let out your secrets; except on Yelp and a milestone review.  That said, this is a review for the recreational player.

The Venetian is the best managed, most comfortable, poker room in Vegas.  Friendly dealers, knowledgeable floors, comfortable seats, well spaced tables, huge number of monitors, food and beverage service, even massage service (not the happy ending variety).

Great game selection for low and mid stakes players (NLHE, LHE, O8B, PLO, Open face Chinese, and the occasional mixed game).  Word of caution, the low limit 2/5NLHE ($200-$1000 buyin) games are frequented by Vegas grinders.  Special note to LA players, the mid limit games like the 5/10NLHE ($400 - no max) and 10/20NLHE ($800 - no max) are tougher than those at Commerce.  They play deep stack with the typical buyin 1,000 BB.

Best attended daily tourneys for the casual player. Offered twice a day, they feature low buyin, decent prize pool, a good amount of play and a soft field.

Great tourney series (Deep Stack) that occur multiple times a year.  Mid range buyin's.  Good structure.  Good mix of players.  Great prize pools.

Single table turbo SNGs run throughout the year but pickup during the Deep Stack series.  Various buyins.  Always 10 players and two winners paid in casino checks (no lamers).

Great comp system ($2 per hour for cash games).  Comps can be accumulated and used for table side food service.  Seriously, there's nothing like handling checks and cards for hours then picking up that juicy burger right?  You only have Montezuma revenge once.

Final tip:  Try the espresso.  It comes with a crystallized sugar stick.  Double rush!

Pull up a chair and enjoy!

Well well well... I'm the first to review the new Dick's location. Of course I am. I can already hear this review screaming ROTD and I haven't even written it yet... 

1. I'm not gay. This is probably the fourth Yelp in which I've disclosed this. It's not important because you should care what my orientation is but so that you can get a sense of this place from the hetero-perspective.   

2. Many people think I'm in the closet. So if you're rolling your eyes at number one, you're not alone. 

3. Granted, my speech patterns and flamboyant style are confusing, especially if you're from the midwest.* 

4. People are gonna think what they want and life is just really, really good anyway. 

5. I was DD one night and we were driving from E. McDowell to Cenpho. Someone, who shall remain nameless, screams from the back seat, "DICKS!" 

6. We go.

7. The two ladies I "brought" loved it. 

8. One of the dancers is "huge." I want one of those. 

9. I can appreciate male beauty. There were maybe one or two pretty dudes but the rest were just ridiculously fit. Six packs and the like... 

10. Apparently, three more minutes of the grind and my lady friend was gonna not be not actively orgasming. She was with the "huge" dude. 

11. She went back the next night. 

12. My other friend's personal dancer said, "I think I'm enjoying this more than you are." I hang with some sexy ladies. I'm very lucky. 

13. It's fully nude if I haven't made that clear. 

14. There is a no cell phone use policy, which I had no idea they would enforce. 

15. Punishment for using cell phone: The most twinkish dancer among them came over and started grinding in my crotch with his ass. Like........ yeah. If that wasn't bad enough, he kept screaming "Pull my hair!" Dude. "Don't call me dude!" Sorry, Dude. "Don't call me dude!!!" "Smack my ass!" 

16. They make straight dudes pay to get in. Remedy that immediately, please. If I'm there with 2 or 7 women, and your gaydar doesn't go off, hook a brother up. 

*Just kidding middle America.

How can anyone complain about the ONLY service I'm aware of here in Vegas that will deliver food to you, while you dictate from your living room dressed in nothing but panties?

Really? I'm sorry y'all. I'm not following you here! You have a better solution, let me know. For now, all of my bets and money are with Road Runner Food on this one... For their excellent service and price for what they offer, I am truly a fan.

If it wasn't for them, I would have never gotten my ROTD on Yelp for reviewing Amore Taste of Chicago Pizza. Roadrunner was singlehandedly responsible for introducing me to this amazing restaurant. I always give credit where credit is due, and it is is definitely due here. All of this transpired from the comfort of my own home, while surfing the net in my panties. And yes, I'm gladly putting my own name and rep on the line by telling you that Roadrunner really rocks! I cannot stress this enough!

Sure, I have to put clothes on to answer the door but who cares? I still got to order in my panties and I relish in that fact! And to think that I just killed every guy's fantasy about delivering the "extra large sausage pizza" to my house in those last few sentences. Haha! I'm sorry.

Special thanks to Vicki for handling my order and making my day. This girl definitely deserves a raise! *a little hint hint nudge nudge for the higher ups that may be reading this*

Who would have thought I'd find myself downtown at a rundown casino like Palace Station, but there I was on a late Sunday night enjoying one of the most satisfying dishes sin city had to offer! 

Yup, I'm talkin about the Pan Roast at Oyster Bar! 

Do yourself a huge favor and order the palace version with shrimp chicken andouille sausage and crab. I added lobster too. But either way, It's the bomb, cuz its all about that crazy good sauce! Keep in mind however, to truly enjoy this dish, you've gotta love your spice! Trust, each bite will be a scorching spoonful of fiery goodness! Chunks of meaty sausage, chicken and seafood in every bite and I bet you won't be able to put your spoon down! Well, except to wipe your forehead from the sweat cuz this bad boy is hot hot hot! But oooh soooo hot diggity good! I ordered a level 7 (1-10 being spiciest) and it was just right!

We started with 1/2 a dozen oysters on the half shell, and that was an excellent intro to our fantastic meal! The oysters were fresh and went down the hatch nicely with a swig of cold frosty Kirin! 

We also ordered the shrimp scampi. It came served with loads of succulent tiger shrimp, a heaping serving of fresh chopped garlic and noodles swimming in a pool of buttery glory. Although it was tasty, it simply couldn't hold a candle to the signature pan roast IMO! 

I'm tellin ya, order the pan roast and enjoy! Your taste buds and tummy will thank you for it!

Happy Eats!

October 15, Florida stone crab season OPEN!  Crab lovers rejoice!

Why?  Simple; sweeter than an lobster, tender, juicy, never stringy meat.  Dip them in a tangy mustard concoction and it's fireworks in your mouth.

The facts:
- Available October 15 - May 15.
- Sold by size (medium, large, jumbo, colossal), price increases with size.
- Size matters for texture not sweetness.  Buy the largest you can afford.
- 2013 harvest starting at the lowest in history.  Astronomical prices ($12/claw large, $25/ claw jumbo).

For other menu items, stick to basics; KISS.  Great place for a casual, shared meal with friends.  Solid preparations for grilled lobster tails, steamed jumbo Alaskan king crab legs, classic oysters Rockefeller, and pan seared diver scallops.  The colossal lump crab cake excellent, moist, sweet.  Almost all crab with lumps sticking out in all directions.  Pick it up and eat it with your fingers.  

Good selection of steaks.  Two grades, USDA choice Angus and USDA prime.  All prime cuts are bone in.  Cuts are gently trimmed leaving some of the outer fat in tact.  Old school, fat is flavor style.   Even grilling and cooked to temperature.  It's beef, nothing fancy but it doesn't need to be.

Diverse side meant to be shared.  The grilled tomatoes are the perfect foil for the stone crabs.  Tart, acidic, blistered and  just warmed through.  

Save a little room for dessert.  Home made key lime pie.  They are known for it.  One of the best examples I've ever had.

Short but very well chosen wine list.  Whites perfectly target the clean seafood flavors from Spain, France, Italy and New Zealand.  Modest (2x-2.5x retail), Vegas resort pricing.

Casual, friendly, efficient service.

Seven sinful months in Sin City never tasted so good.

Fabulous find. 

We were leaving Macy's and I asked "where do you want to go for lunch?"  We remembered there was a Habit Burger across the street, so off we went.

So here we are walking past Garbanzo. It was very dark inside with their tinted windows and the signs on the window said "Space Available." So I thought "Wow" that was fast, didn't they just open?  Well, another Phoenix business has closed. 

We get to Habit and the line is out onto the sidewalk. D'oh!  But just then, someone leaves Garbanzo and the lights inside tell a different story. Yes, they're open.  It turns out the sign "Space Available", was for another store.  So the heck with burgers, let's eat Greek/Middle Eastern.  Sorry Habit!

Garbanzo Mediterranean Grill is like the Chipotle's for the Gryos and hummus crowd. It's actually more of a fast food version of Pita Jungle. The food is really good and fresh!  Lunch ran us under $20  and we left very impressed. 

Enjoy!

With suitcases in hand we checked this place out to satisfy my curiosity about Michael Mina. I've heard his name thrown around here and there when the conversation is about restaurants. Why is he famous? Why does have so many restaurants??

NEW ENGLAND CRAB & LOBSTER ROLLS ($17) - 3 pieces of warm bread with crab & lobster goodness on top. Scrumptious!

SEARED FOIE GRAS ($25) - It was perfectly seared and buttery. It also had an apple compote that made it super sweet, super yummy!

FRENCH FRIES ($7) - Perfectly salted and perfectly crunchy.

BEIGNETS ($9) - So warm, so soft, and so sugary! Then I dipped it in the chocolate caramel sauce....ohmanohmanohman, I was in pure ecstasy! The salty caramel ice cream was a delightful bonus to this dish!

CHRIS-TINI ($14) - There was something beyond sweetness, something odd and sour that made me a bit dizzy. I liked it!

SUMMER FLING ($14?) - So good yet so bad...The first sip wormed its way into my brain and made me giddy!

SERVICE - There was 1 to 2 people standing in each corner watching the dining room. At least they were on it when we needed something. But as the restaurant got busier, we saw less and less of our waiter. We had to flag him down when I wanted to order dessert, when we wanted more drinks, and when we were ready to pay. But my tummy was happy so I wasn't upset with the wait. And props to the manager for hiding our suitcases in his office.

After a few appetizers and drinks I kind of understood why Michael Mina is known by a lot of foodies. AHHHH...dining here was a great way to end this Vegas trip! Now I'm curious about the other Michael Mina restaurants!

So, all week before my Vegas trip I was super pumped about a schmancy $100 brunch reservation we had at some other restaurant. It turned out to be okay, but that night we went to Johnny Smalls for a $20 all-you-can-eat tapas dinner and it blew that fancy schmancy brunch out of the effin' water.

Seriously. This is approximately three billion times better than any buffet out there. I know some of ya'll are really into foie gras, caviar, and whatever other hoity-toitiness there is out there. You know what I'm into? Mac n' cheese, bacon, fritos, ranch dressing. What can I say? I'm a gal of highly refined taste, and Johnny Smalls has got my number

There was a 20 minute wait for a table, so we sidled on up to the bar and had dinner and drinks there all served by Anthony, the most kickass flair bartender/server EVER. And you know how I mentioned that $20 AYCE earlier? It really is AYCE. Anything on the menu. From frito pie (with kobe beef chili, of course) to pork belly to tuna sashimi to mac n cheese to grilled pb&j. TWENTY DOLLARS. Period. No extra. 

...word on the street is that they are upping the price to $30 for AYCE after the new year, but even if that's true this is still one of the best values for endless deliciousness around.

Vegas requires a surprisingly large amount of thinking. Does the club pay for the cab? Sometimes. One-guy-one-girl rule? Usually. Be sure to tip... or not. Buy her a drink... or not.  $30 cover?? 

Did I just go to a strip club or do my taxes?

I'm at a point in my life where i'm trying to find meaning and depth in the world... and this is the last place in the last city I should be in. It just doesn't do it for me. But it's always good to try new things, and thus lovable Yelper, AJ, made sure I didn't leave without getting my first lap dance.

Keane: So.. uh... what are you into?
Girl: *surprised look*
Keane: Uh.. I meant... things to do.
Girl: I've been going to a lot of late night clubs... Oh! You have really soft hair. What do you use?
Keane: ... shampoo.

*examines my shirt*

Girl: What is "Yelp"?

Aw, shit. Now it's on...

I had this crazy fantasy that Mario Batali himself was in the back grinding up Carnevino's riserva, ribeye and porterhouse cuts to be made into patties.  Not exactly the case but the guys behind one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas definitely know beef.  So a visit here was inevitable despite the mixed reviews.

Before B&B burger opened, Batali himself said "The food will be easier to accept if you've never heard of me."  Everyone comes to expect so much with his name on the front.  

My verdict: a damn good burger!  We ordered what most reviewers got and also what the servers recommended.  The "Morning After" was everything I want in a good burger.  The patty was a very juicy medium rare.  The egg on top looked and tasted so perfect upon my first bite which then turned into a beautiful mess of yolk everywhere.  The bun itself was excellent with a kind of croissant quality to it.  I was only able to notice it after eating part of the bun separately though.  The royale with cheese was also very good and my wife preferred this more with all its caramelized onion glory.

I still would have paid more for a riserva patty though :)

I've always had mixed feelings about the Cheesecake Factory.

I am not much of a cheesecake aficionado, and they have always struck me as an icon of american food excess.  The few times we've eaten in one, we have always left with a bagful of leftovers capable of feeding a third world family for a week.  A slight exaggeration, but not by much I believe.

On the positive side, Cheesecake Factory makes some really interesting and tasty dishes.  I have also found that I have become susceptible to subliminal messages while watching Sheldon and Leonard discuss their BBQ Burger on Big Bang Theory. LOL

So here I was shopping at the Mall and wondering about lunch, when I walked passed Cheesecake Factory and thought of Sheldon and Leonard's discourse.  See link: http://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/series-1-episode-5-the-hamburger-postulate/

So instead of their preferred BBQ Burger, I went with the Classic Burger for $10.50 (see photos). Wow it was huge (maybe a 1/2 lb.) and very, very good. 

A couple months back we were in LVS and had an enjoyable dinner at Gordon Ramsey's "BurGR". This burger is a close second to that carnivorous experience. I'll say it again, wow. 

Cheesecake's Classic Burger is grilled on an open flame and it picks up all that smokey taste from the grill. A nice touch was the sliced grilled red onion which is served on top. 

In summary, an absolutely Four Star Plus experience; and yes I am a Fan. Maybe next time I'll try Sheldon's BBQ Burger. Hmm, I just realized my review feels more like a Chuck Lorre vanity card. LOL

Enjoy!

For my 125th, 5 Star Review I wanted to share a gastropub located in the V.  I had heard a lot about this place, and I like gastropubs so I said I gotta check this place out.  We ordered a light meal consisting of: 

Bone marrow ($15) w/ bacon & onion marmalade; Grilled octopus ($16) w/ fried chickpeas, chorizo, saffron-romanesco sauce & arugula; and Duck confit poutine ($11) w/ cheese curds, gravy & egg ($2.50 extra).

The marrow was excellent.  It was completely edible vs some places where all the marrow does not come off the bone.  It was nicely seasoned and the marmalade and bread were also excellent too:  5 Stars.  The octopus was outstanding.  It was way better than recently reviewed Black Hogg in Silverlake (LA).  The octopus was super tender, and the fried chickpeas and chorizo added texture and contrast to the octopus:  5 Stars.  Lastly, the poutine was the star of the evening and the perfectly cooked egg put this dish over the top!  The dish was nice sized, the fries were still crispy, and there wasn't too much gravy (poured on at the table).  This version was way better compared to Animal in LA:  5+++ Stars.

To drink, we had the Joseph James lager ($8) and a Speakeasy ($10).  The former is like a Stella (my go to beer), but w/ more malt.  The latter is a Belgian style beer, but not as sweet as some:  5 Stars for both.

Nicholas was an awesome bartender!  Not only did he introduce us to some new beers, he was also very knowledgable about the menu.  Lastly, he poured a tequila shot down the finished bone marrow for one patron.  The patron said he really liked it!  - 5 Stars.

The ambiance was very nice.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed the view.  The clientele were chill, and there was a whimsical sign by the bathroom:  5 Stars.

I will definitely be back the next time I am in Vegas to try more dishes, or have the dishes we enjoyed on this trip.  I would prefer to come here vs the overrated Delmonicos.

I went here to see the Coyotes play my home town Chicago Blackhawks. The place was sold out and consisted mostly of Chicagoans. I had no problem high fiving fellow fans after each of the 5 goals that the hawks scored. And of course they won going away that night. I guess it's a sad commentary on society in general when you have to go through a metal detector to go into the stadium. 

I had excellent seats since they were about 10 rows from the glass at the faceoff circle. I was positioned near the Coyotes net to see most of the Hawk's goals. The lines at the concession places weren't too bad but I'm pretty ticked that the dude as we entered our section wanted to see my tickets. I guess he wanted me to juggle my food and drinks in the air while I fished out my tickets from my pocket. He saw my "Are you kidding me look" and explained that they were sold out. I explained to him that I've gone to plenty of sold out games in Chicago without the attitude from the Stadium staff. How can the management expect fans wanting to pay $10 bucks for parking plus $80 plus dollars per ticket and still wanting to endure the hassle of their staff inside? Management might want to think about that for awhile.

Pro tip about going to the game. Don't expect to get any free pizza from their cheerleaders when you're wearing the away team's colors. Getting out of the parking lot was fairly easy as well. Also, thank goodness that cell phone reception is a little inconsistent near the ice so you don't have to listen to people on their phones.

A late night dessert restaurant is something every area of town needs, and the southwest area is no exception.  So Serenade is definitely a welcome addition to this part of town! 

We arrive after 8 pm and most of the tables are occupied by those enjoying hot drinks, on their laptops, or enjoying a sweet treat.  We grab the one large table by the counter and it takes awhile for us to decide.  Ultimately, we get the Honey Bread ($8.50) (aka Honey Toast) with extra honey and two drinks - the Pistachio Latte ($4.50) and the Peppermint Latte ($4.50).  The flavor is quite subtle for the Pistachio Latte and the Husband enjoyed it.  The Little Guy preferred my Peppermint Latte more though.  The honey bread is lovely as usual, but they do offer a Garlic version for 50 cents more.  Apparently it's garlic butter instead of plain butter used on it. 

The menu has your standard cafe drinks, hot and cold.  Waffles, cakes, pizzas, and pastries are among the items to munch on.

They offer outside seating and blankets too!

Stamp cards are available via the Epoxy app, so download for your Buy 9 Get 1 Free cards.  

Since they are located in the Smiths's Shopping Center, and the same corner as Rice N Noodle and Patty's Closet, there is plenty of parking available.  Free WiFi - look for the pass code on the board behind the register.

Overall, a nice alternative to meet up with friends at for coffee and cake.

Upscale gourmet burger places are popping up all over the Valley.  Except this one is different!

I could write about how they are better than Coal Burger(?), Five Guys or ZinBurgers, but why do that -- since they did a much better job:

"While most people are eating breakfast, we''re already doing lunch -- shaping fresh 100% Certified Angus Beef into plump meatballs.  (When was our beef frozen, by the way?  Try never.)

"Why meatballs, not patties?  Because unlike the other burger places, we don''t squish.  We smash.  Place your order and we spring into action, painting the grill with real butter, adding a dash of our secret spice blend, and smashing the meatball with a tool we invented ourselves (it''s so new, it doesn''t even have a name -- let''s just call it the smashing tool).

Okay, their corporate marketing aside, we had a very nice time here yesterday.  One of us ordered the large Smashburger Arizona, with Habanero cheese, quacamole, jalapeos on their spicy chipotle bun for $6.99(photo), along with the French Fries for $2.29(photo).  Ohh, was that good!

We also ordered the large Mushroom Swiss Smashburger for $6.99, and the Haystack Onions for $2.29.  Everything was outstanding and yummy.  

Yummy? Yes, yummy!  Like, why waste your time going somewhere else yummy!  Oh, yeah the bill for two came to $22.  Did I mention that Smashburger was an upscale gourmet burger place?  But that did include drinks and some sides.

I know that might be too Richie Rich$$ for some, so you can drive down FLW to In 'n Out and order it Animal Style.  But if you do, you will be missing an outstanding and delicious burger!  LOL

Enjoy!

This is another long overdue review that I've been needing to write in a bad way. I actually feel guilty keeping this information all to myself for so long! This place couldn't be more deserving of a fantastic review from yours truly.

I come to Spa Mio mostly for blowouts but I've had massages and facials done here as well. I like that I don't even need to request a specific person as I know when I'm coming to Spa Mio, everyone that works here does a great job! It's a rare thing for me to be able to say that about a salon/spa. The fact that all of their hairdressers/therapists are talented saves me time and headaches because then I don't have to work around a specific person's schedule and can just book in right away. Whomever does their hiring is on it! In addition to being great at what they do, all of the people that work here are nice and friendly and always a pleasure to deal with. I've never had a bad experience and I've been coming here a lot and for a long time, as you can see from my number of checkins listed above.

They offer discounts for locals which is awesome! They also have a shop in the front where you can buy hair and skincare products, flat irons & other styling tools, bath bombs, even cute jewelry. Come a little early so that you can have a look.

Without hesitation, I can recommend Spa Mio to all of my fellow Yelpers. They also offer many other services here including nails (which I have not tried yet) but I can assume their employees are on par with the rest since they're always busy. For more information on all they have to offer visit:

Five stars!

Taquitos Jalisco serves up Mexican street food common to the state of Jalisco.  You might be more familiar with the state capital city, Guadalajara.  This particular restaurant has a "sister" property on Gilbert Road that I've heard has better tasting food than this location.  Hmmm... I may have to find out!  as this was very good Mexican street food!  There's a bandwagon forming for Taquitos Jalisco and it's making stops in Mesa!

Let me jump on the bandwagon for a ride too!  I missed the Yelper Lunch UYE here in April, but I scheduled my lunch group to go here this month.  I'd heard from Robyn N and Rand H that the place was small, but had no idea that by small they meant TINY!  The international lunch group that I organize was about 14 deep for lunch!  We were smart enough to arrive early.  Every table was taken once we got in the door.  Thankfully, it was not terribly hot outside and the tables outside were still open.  We gladly occupied those tables under the shade with the roar of the traffic on Broadway whizzing by.

I sat next to my buddy Dawn K and we split our food!  I ordered 3 carne asada Tacos and 2 Tamales.  I will say that I was disappointed with the Tacos.  The carne asada was a little dry for me.  But still tasty enough to enjoy.  The tamales were fantastic!  I split one of my tamales with the entire group so that everyone could get a taste.  But I saved the other for myself for lunch the next day!  Dawn K ordered a platter with 3 things on it.  Enchilada, Taco and a Chile Relleno.  I tried some of her Chile Relleno!  The chile relleno was extremely good.  It was my favorite thing that I tasted.  

I did not try it, but one lunch'er raved about the fish tacos and Robyn N also said their fish tacos were very good.  A slip of the brain as I would have ordered that instead of the carne asada taco.

Everyone in the group was happy, even the vegetarian lunch'er was happy with his veggie burrito!  Score!  This place is worth stopping in and trying.   

Remember, this is definitely a DIVE!  The parking lot is also very small.  It is on the north side of the street.  Pay attention.  The building is so small, you will likely drive past it and miss the turn.

My family and friends have been getting together for a few years here to grub. That will be happening no longer. The last 3 visits were terrible and the last visit specifically was not good. I'm sad about this because I really loved the food before, but now it's just not consistent. On this last visit we were the only customers in the restaurant yet it still took over an hour to receive our food and the food came out staggered. My niece only wanted Egg Drop Soup and they totally forgot to bring it to her and only did so after asking a 3rd time about it. When she finally got her soup it was like a bowl of gloppy gel. I loved the soup here before, so I have no idea what has happened, but it wasn't even edible. What I loved ordering here most, Strawberry Chicken, tasted awful. One thing that wasn't easy to ignore was the nasty smell inside. It smelled so badly of like sewage or something. Then at the end of the meal we noticed roaches on the floor! OMG I was so ready to leave. Drinks come in cans and refills aren't free. After loving this place for so long it's a major disappointment to see New China Cuisine go so downhill.

Hands down, my favorite burger in Vegas! I don't even go for the fusion burgers (which are incredible) but rather a purists' version. Wagyu beef with cheddar, lettuce, onion, tomato, and ketchup. Simple but sweet and a classic all the way! Why mess with perfection?

The burgers are always cooked on point here. I fluctuate between med rare and rare, and the fact that each time I switch it up and can tell the difference is a testament to the deft hands working the grill back there. The beef itself is pure, juicy, fatty indulgence. Add quality cheddar? A masterpiece. The buns here really set it over the top- a Taiwanese style sweetbread that's crunchy against the patty and veggies but supple on top, so that it melds itself around the rest of the burger.

If that's not enough to bring you in, the Bachi pickles should be. With a great variety of about 6, each made in house, it's such a great way to start- and end!- the meal, especially with its digestive properties. Crunchy sweet garlic, bracing daikon, vibrant radishes.. The rotation changes on any given day.

Out of all the fries, the salt and pepper are my favorite garnished with fresh leaves of cilantro, thinly sliced jalapeos and fried ginger. I love it with the Yuzu aioli.

Endless matcha iced green teas, a great beer selection, creative desserts- there isn't a reason for you not to drop by.

Disinterested servers with their noses held high.
The Sommelier had a stick shoved so high up his butt he could barely make sense. Insisting we could not bring in a bottle of wine if it was on the wine list. We told him that we had already checked and it was not on their wine list.  He checked (more than once) and couldn't find it on the list. He finally gave in.  The bottle of Lodi Gluttony 2006 Old Vine Zinfandel was the bottle we brought for this occasion. We had every intention of ordering a second bottle from their list. But as it turns out we didn't want to spend any more time at Bouchon than we needed to. It was NOT the way to start a Birthday dinner.... Or any dinner for that matter.     
The Food   
The scallops were amazing according to my Grandson 
The sausage (Boudin Blac) ordered by my Grandaughter, didn't seem to impress her
Son-In-laws salad nicoise was not what he expected. Seems it was more of a tuna salad on lettuce. But he said it tasted good 
The Roasted Leg of Lamb was not memorable -literally 
The beautifully presented Pork chop Delmonico was tasty, but way to tough to chew.
The best thing was Son-in-laws first course of a micro greens that seem to have a light sprinkling of a Nutty Gremolata and topped with deep fried calamari rings. I'm having a hard time getting that salad out of my mind. I'll have to try my hand at making it, because I won't be back to Bouchon.
Snobbery makes good food taste bad. 

Sheesh, I can't believe I put on high heels for this.

I wanna eat right now
I'm Greg N, and I came to chow down
This place is not internationally known
But on the Yelp App on your new iPhone
It's near the top and so highly rated
In Las Vegas: and that's going to be debated
After you order, they give you fresh cooked chips
With pico de gallo and guacamole dips
Some of the best chips that I've ever had
This free offering made me feel real glad
Order three tacos with beef bulgogi
Right on par with that truck called Kogi
Keep the flo' cuz

I can't believe that here in Nevada
I ate the most amazing fusion tostada
Thick "nurungji" shell at its base
The fried tortilla with rice replace
With spicy pork bulgogi on top
With shredded cabbage here they don't stop
Pico de gallo they placed on too
And gochujang hot sauce was the flavor glue
One of the best dishes I've had all year
It made me happy, it made me there cheer
It's like PSY and Carlos Santana collaborating
On a megahit song. I'm celebrating
If you go here, order this dish
You will also say this is delish'

It takes two to make a food so right

Now the bulgogi fries are just OK
Not amazing as other Yelpers may say
And the kimchi fried rice was so-so
Many other places for kimchi fried rice would go
Just skip these two and just get
The tostadas and the tacos and you'll be set
Once you get a-hold of these two plates
And you chomp into the food so great
You'll be throwing your hands in the air
And waving them like you just don't care
KoMex is a foodie find
Get off of the buffet grind!

It takes two to make a food so right

Sedona way 
For three hot nights
And four days stayed

On our way home
Stopped in Phoenix

Gladly he picks

Walked through the doors
Nice ambience
The air was cool
Booth seats ensconced

Caught up with life
Ate a nice lunch

We ordered the Chopped Salad
Also the Pigstrami
We shared a cup of squash soup
At the end we were happy

You know

Nicely plated
Light dressing poured

Shared cup squash soup
Seeds, raisins topped
Gulped spoonsful few
Yet hard to stop

Pigstrami good
Yet bit salty
Langer's sandwich
Is best to me.

The Gladly servers are trained well
Helpful, thoughtful, polite
In terms of the "lunch experience"
The Gladly was out of sight!

I'm not a gambler a drinker, so LV is not really my kind of town, unless I'm off the strip. The Rio is just that, a little of the strip and closer to where the locals go. 

Upon arrival, I was upgraded to a larger suite, SWEET!!!. The room was very nice, looked clean, didn't smell of yesterdays smoke, alcohol, or any flow play. The bed was a nice comfy size, king. Not sure why the t.v. is placed on the side wall, kind of difficult to watch in bed even have to do the head crank when seated on the couch, opposite the bed. 

The bathroom was fairly clean. I don't understand why hotels especially of such caliber don't wash their shower curtains. Upon inspection, I opened the curtain an almost hurled because of the sour smell the curtain spewed. It was nice to see that they automatically provided those little things you tend to forget, such as toothbrush, toothpaste and shower stuff. The vanity area is a bit odd, nice that there is a single cup coffee maker, but why put it on a shelf and one has to pull out and place on the vanity counter. Couldn't they just raise the shelf above to give the coffee maker enough room to open for water and the coffee packs? I was tempted. 

The casino itself is like any other, noisy and people everywhere. The downside is the HVAC. It must be the original unit since every time I walked out of the casino, I smelled of stale cigarettes. Yeah, I didn't spend much time there. I did, however, spend enough time to try their Pho restaurant. I will be writing a review for this place, so I won't say much here except, that was Pho? Blah. 

The room was nice and the price was good, should I go back to LV, I may consider staying here again.

OM Heavenly G!!!  Who knew fried chicken and waffles went so well together!!!  My daughter was in heaven!!  She loved her chicken and she doesn't eat much meat at all but the crispy fried chicken had her knawing on the bone.  I ate my entire plate and so did my daughter.  And she has been asking to go back ever since.  And the sweet tea....YUM!!  It was just right, not overly sweet.  I don't know that a place like this exists anywhere in the Northern CA/Bay Area but someone should open one!  For now this is one reason I'm glad I live in Phoenix.....I will be a frequent customer.  

The inside feels like you walked into someone's house and I never would have known it was there since it's in a non descript part of town...kind of industrial.  We got there pretty early and by the time we left, the place was packed!  

I have been craving this chicken since we went there...I know we will be back!!!  And often!

I appreciate French food and like it more than I should. 

I also love NOLA and their Laissez les bons temps roulern!

But, the French Grocery is really not a grocery store at all. You cannot buy any grocery items, like you might find in a typical Champion or Carrefour. No Carte Noire coffee, no Maille moutardes, et cetera

They also do not cook, nor serve food here.  Everything is pre-made, wrapped for sale and kept in a refrigeration case. The only exception is the bakery items and a small chilled salad deli case. 

When we arrived on Friday just before five, there were also very few items left in the refrigerator. There was no croissants, no french bread or much of anything in the bakery case except for some small $1.75 cookies.

There were a couple of small individual Quiche Lorraines (which didn't contain any bacon or ham) and a few small baguette sandwiches, like you would find in Gare du Nord. 

The French Bakery also has a wine section, along with a few French press coffee pots. As others have noted, the lighting is poor and makes the store feel dreary. There are a few tables scattered in this cavernous store. But I am unsure what they are used for since you cannot sit and eat any of the chilled items. 

I believe the French Grocery is set up to appeal to working couples on the go --who want something more interesting than the Take Out selection of Fresh & Easy.  Of the six items we ordered, the best was the chocolate Pot de Creme for $3.50. Our total including tax came to $32.11

But if you come to the French Grocery thinking of Le Pain Quotidien, Le Madeleine, or even local Amuse Bouche (Surprise), you might leave disappointed.   Sorry!

Vegas, day 50.  Final day of a successful WSOP.  Celebratory / farewell dinner for my poker buds.  Only one place fitting enough for this meal; Gourmet Magazines number one Thai restaurant in North America. 

It's unpretentious in an unassuming neighborhood. Looks can be deceiving, be prepared for a true culinary adventure.  This isn't your average neighborhood Thai restaurant.  Tamarind paste, not ketchup in the pad Thai.

Tip:  The menu is huge.  Expert on Thai food, study it in advance else let the servers guide you.  Allow the servers to suggest spice levels as well so dishes compliment not over power each other.

The meal usually consist of numerous dishes served at once.  It create a play of complimenting and contrasting flavors that collectively make the experience. If forced to find standout dishes:

Issan Sausage (a grilled sour pork sausage.  The natural sweetness of the pork shines through in this simple yet perfectly balanced sausage).

Sua Rong Hai (broiled beef tenderloin in a spicy, sweet sauce.  Tender with the spices bringing out the sweetness of the beef).

Plar Dook Kar-Prow Krob (Deep fried whole catfish topped with sauted fresh chili, garlic, and basil.  Earthy, fiery, absolutely delicious against the crisp, slightly overcooked catfish).

Charbroiled prawns (Extra large prawns grilled and served with a spicy, tangy tamarind sauce.  Beautiful balance again with the spices heightening the natural sweetness of the prawn.  The charbroiling adds a good bitterness).

Garlic prawns (lightly battered, deep fried with shells on in a fresh, peppery garlic sauce.  Just good eats).

Massive wine list (Wine Spectator Best Award of Excellence) with over 600 selections.  Heavy emphasis on Germany and France (Rieslings).  Very inexpensive.

And to the annoying ladies dining next to us commenting on our unrefined choice of utensils and wasteful over ordering:  (1) Thai etiquette dictates you use your fork to put food on your spoon and only put your spoon in your mouth,  (2) you don't ask for chopsticks, and (3) it is rude not to leave some food on the serving dishes and your plate.

Always a great culinary adventure.

A good Pho restaurant in Vegas?! Can it be??

Yess!! 

It's about time that I write a review about this place. I live right down the street so you'll find me here for dinner if I'm too lazy to drive out or cook for myself. Their location is great for me, but for the masses they are at a huge disadvantage. They are located on the south side of town, 20 minutes or so away from Chinatown, which is where most people who seek out Vietnamese or any type of Asian food will go. They are also hidden in a complex where there storefront cannot be seen from the street.

When it comes to Vietnamese food, I am quite spoiled. I grew up on my grandma's homemade Pho, so most Pho restaurants in Vegas don't even compare. Pho Annie though...hits the spot! Satiates that craving. 

When I order a bowl of Pho, I like it to be perfect without me having to add any of the condiments available. Hoisin and sriracha should be a dipping sauce for the meat not to flavor the diluted bowl of broth that some places try to serve. Of course everyone has their preferences but regardless the foundation of the dish has to have substance to begin with. 

Their broth is perfectly balanced...very hearty and full of flavor (but not salty) unlike many other restaurants that will serve diluted broth or broth that tastes like MSG. The noodles aren't soggy or undercooked and the vegetables are fresh. Everything just comes together. 

Service could be better, but Vietnamese restaurants are notorious for awkward service. The servers do not look you in the eye when they are talking to you or taking your order. They most likely won't be checking up on you. HOWEVER...you will get your food within 5-10 minutes...which is nice. 

If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food, seek Pho Annie!!

This was my first time in Terminal 3 since I was flying Virgin America to LA and I do have to say that it's pretty awesome because it's new, modern, open, and spacious. Checking in is a breeze if you must do so. All the airlines are all lined up with awesome LED screens indicating each airline's specific counter. 

The security now has two separate lines - one for regular screens and individuals who have TSA Pre-Check. The TSA Pre-Check line moved pretty quickly even if it looks pretty long. Just remember folks, put all your stuff in your bag and don't have any metal like belts, coin change, etc. on your or in your pockets. It'll make the line move much more quickly!

After getting through security, there are plenty of screen to inform you of you arriving and departing flights. The terminal is pretty big with huge windows that let in plenty of light. In true Vegas style, there are slot machines around every corner in case you have extra time before your flight.

There are plenty of food options such as Pei Wei, Burger King, Carl's Jr., and Coffee Bean. I think there are a couple more options, but I noticed these just from looking for food. They also had your basic stores in case you wanted some snacks, reading material, Las Vegas memorabilia, etc. The bathrooms are also modern and clean, which is always a plus.

The terminal is very accommodating to tech savvy folks. There is free wi-fi for your use and there's also a dedicated charging station. It would've been better if there were chargers are each seat, but that's just me being picky.

If I have to fly to Las Vegas again, going through Terminal 3 would be awesome. It has everything I need to literally make the time fly! You will not be disappointed!

The food here is a solid 3 stars, but the consistently amazing service is enough to bump it up to 4.

This is NOT an authentic Mexican restaurant, it caters to the middle aged American palate. That being said, they do a great job with that. All of the usual suspects like combo plates with burritos, tacos, tostadas, tamales etc.. But also some dishes with nopales (cactus) and calabaza (pumpkin) to make some feel like maybe they're eating adventurously.

What stands out the most here is that they are all about the freebies, and I think that's really what draws the crowd here. Heaping baskets of chips with endless bean dip and salsa. Fideo soup to start every meal (they even asked me if I wanted more) and they gave me a side of vegetables with my dinner for free. They also have free grilled onions and jalapeos. They ALSO honored some happy hour prices for some patrons at the table next to me even though happy hour was over to which those people exclaimed "now that's service!" No.. It's not.. You're just jerks, and they're just really nice. A server who couldn't honor happy hour prices when it's been over for an hour isn't a bad server.

The fajitas are their claim to fame here, and while they are impressive upon delivery, I found them to be quite bland. The tall flame is a gimmick, but I think it's fun anyway. All of the food is solid.. But the check backs, friendly chatter, anticipation of your needs and presence of the servers without being overbearing is really impressive. Just don't come expecting something that your abuela used to make for you.

I'm going to have to side with the vinyl on the window.  NLS does open at 10am M-F, and thankfully for me, my second excursion to this unexpectedly spacious scuba store was fortuitous.

Walking in, I executed the traditional panoramic overview, sweeping my head from left to right, at which point I noticed Sheldon.  Throwing him a head-nod, I offered up a "What's up?" that probably sounded more like "S'up".  That is the bane of being raised on the streets of suburban Massachusetts, where the kids who weren't allergic to bee stings called the shots, and would gut you as soon as look at ya.

I mean, I wasn't actually raised ON the streets, but I did spend a fair share of my time playing near them.

I've been to a handful of dive shops here in the valley, and NLS has one of the larger showrooms.  Their assortment of gear isn't as vast as say, Sports Chalet, but its not a corporate conglomerate... and although I'm pretty sure I used that word incorrectly, as an adjective, it provided the appropriate amount of disparagement.

Interesting note... purchases over $700, if made through an approved GE Capital line of credit, will enjoy a full Gregorian calendar year of deferred interest.  Combine that with the 10% discount extended for being a club member, and that, my friend, spells savings.

For example, the regulator, oct (the yellow line and breather), wireless tank transmitter, and gigantic wrist computer I'm looking at run about $1900 combined.  Subtract the 10%, and divide principal-only payments over 12 months, factor in sales tax... minus the amortization, carry the two...

OK, I think we can all agree, I'm no math whiz.  But, if you purchase a regulator, you'll get the Equipment Specialist course for free.  That's a total prize package worth over $160 US... and I'm gonna do it... and not just because I said I was going to do it in this review... although that is mostly the reason.

And if lake diving aint yo thang, then stop by the trip and travel kiosk, located conveniently in the west wing.  NLS hosts monthly trips to San Carlos MX for only $599 pp based on double occupancy.  Here's the kicker.  You ain't staying in some musty hotel.  No my friend, your accommodations are located in an oceanfront luxury home.  That's how Antonio Banderas would roll, and gosh darn it, why should your roll have any less butter than his?  Two days of 3 tank dives are included, with an available third day of room and diving for a modest up-charge.

Have a little more chang-chang in your pocket, then consider Honduras.  Not only are they know for cigars and the flesh trade, but their diving is unparalleled.  Two words: shark diving.  Get up close and personal with the spiney blast-bots of the sea.  Only $1650 pp based on double occupancy.

All trip deposits are $500 min.  All gear can be rented at NLS.  I'm happy to have a shop, close enough to my house, to call my own.

P.S. That same GE credit card can be used at Global Bikes too.

I HAVE URGES... 

"There is a human urge to clarify, rationalize, justify", said Leonard Bernstein. 

That sounds like a good description of Yelp, doesn't it, but that's not the urge I have. 

This definition is a better fit: 

a. An impulse that prompts action or effort. 
b. An involuntary tendency to perform a given activity. 

I have an urge to go to Las Vegas pronto. 

Do I like to gamble? Yes, sometimes. 

Do I like seeing some great shows? Definitely. 

Do I like going to the International CES, the world's largest consumer technology trade show? Oh, yeah, so much fun. 

Do I like staying in some great sexy hotel room on the Strip? You better believe it. 

But none of these are the reason for my urge. My urge is to go to a little nondescript shack located in a questionable, seedy area away from the Strip. The only strip this place is close to is the Olympic Gardens Strip Club that offers male and female strippers, and where lap dances go for 20 bucks. 

I need to go to Vegas because I want me some ice cream from Luv-It Frozen Custard NOW! 

Frozen custard is French style ice cream. It's lower in butterfat and calories than ice cream, and is made with eggs, which gives this indulgent concoction a creamier texture. It also has much less air whipped into it, and there are two types of air I don't like: people full of hot air (no, I'm not telling now) and ice cream full of air. 

I don't even like Sundaes, but at Luv-It Frozen Custard I am simply hypnotized by everything they have. Western Sundae, their most popular - vanilla custard, caramel, salty pecans and hot fudge? Give it to me now, before I get arrested for yanking it from the hands of some unsuspecting Japanese tourist! Bumble Berry Sundae? What's in it? Wait, I don't care, just pile it on! 

Everything is homemade, frozen custard flavors change every few days, so check their website, if you want to know what specific olfactory and oral pleasures to look forward to. Even their website looks hokily homemade, which in this case is just charming and consistent. 

So, if you want some frozen nirvana, if you're tired of seeing same old, same old corporate clones that look identical in LA, Johannesburg, Vegas and Moscow - this is the place for some instant bliss. 

What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas...   I wish Luv-It frozen Custard didn't.

Who you callin a Byatch! Bow down for your master! 

I read my first reviews of Bachi a while back and bookmarked it away for a Vegas trip.

Thanks Dave G. and Craig R for enlightening me to the way of the Bachi Burger. My journey is now only 1/2 complete as this young grasshopper is ready to fly, again the voices of Dave & Craig come creeping into my mind. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=TECziqmB2XZ4E5psSvvKJw#TECziqmB2XZ4E5psSvvKJw

You must first journey to the East. Search for the Windmill and the Bermuda, the masters told me and you will find the truth.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=qU4VbIgVxtgDi-E6M_KF-w#qU4VbIgVxtgDi-E6M_KF-w 

So grasshopper must learn new technique, to follow big nose. http://www.yelp.com/biz_user_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA/upload?upload_finished=1&successful%5B%5D=ArW1gUzvm7zPvs1ZuYsf9g

As I drove up with my top down I could smell good things going on inside. 
The masters again spoke to me. " Put up the ragtop or your rent a car will get stolen dummy"  https://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/photo/1PZEIhmTjSzNrMhMfWU6IQ/l.jpg

Finally this journey must come to an end or is it a new beginning?

FOOD:
Kiki's Burger ... Angus Beef, Sauted Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngii Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese and Garlic Chili Aioli
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cPIFhziwSrVw3V_b4mTs-Q&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

Oxtail Chili Fries ... Oxtail chili with Garlic Aioli and a Fried Egg
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-nVIFwtfBMzOLjjubXv4MA&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

TASTE:  HELL YEA!
Kiki's Burger ... one hell of a bad boy, a large burger sportin an eartty mushroom taste like an ugly redheaded stepchild at an Irish fair. This was one great burger! A true 5*****Star 

Oxtail Chili Fries ... I've had oxtail spaghetti ragu, soup, pho and even a Jamacian oxtail jerk, but never had it as a chili base before. Its marrow/ gelatin rich flavor is an awesome boot in the pants to an otherwise plain beef chile. I reccomend this for anyone going to Vegas.. It kicks tail!

My masters are calling me back to Anaheim. http://www.yelp.com/biz_user_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA/upload?upload_finished=1&successful%5B%5D=JqImqMytH8fVTrxRkv14mg

SERVICE:   here is off the hook, you know they got a good thing going and make sure you do too. Clean, polite and willing to help you find the right food for your taste.

I'll be back to try so many things that my stomach would not let me this time.

I over heard that one is opening in LA sometime soon, Bachi Burgers, On Sawtelle in W. LA., Sign me up masters!

Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat

Marquee Nightclub was packed. The music was thumpin' and the drinks were flowin'. Who cares if there were more dudes on the crowded dance floor than ladies? We were there to jump and dance ... and after quickly staking out a spot in the middle near the front, that is exactly what we and a few hundred of our new best friends did.

Tip #1: Stay at the Cosmopolitan. Go online and book a room because it includes free admission to Marquee through a much shorter line. It'll also give you a place to freshen up before hitting the club and crash/party afterwards. Ask for a room in the East Tower for convenience to Marquee.

Marquee Mondays makes Marquee a reason to stay in Sin City an extra day. The EC Twins and Nadia Ali performed on the Monday before Christmas and this was like an early gift from Santa.

Tip #2: Get on the main dance floor early cause by midnight it was wall-to-wall people with almost no one getting in or out. Many "couples" were frustrated with the tight quarters, so, come prepared for bumpin' and jumpin' with people from all around the globe.

DJ Lisa Pittman worked it at the pool while Eddie Makabi and another DJ pumped up the beats inside before the headliners came out around 12:30. Nadia did a 30-minute live set which had the crowd frothing and then the energy reached a peak with the frenetic twins.

Tip #3: Get a table if you aren't planning to stake out a spot on the crowded dance floor. If you are just wanting to chill at a club, the outdoor pool vibe and tables may be best or get one of the prime spots inside so you and your crew can dance in your own area.

Drinks are expensive ... of course, and table service is crazy expensive. Plan accordingly.

Marquee was a blast. We loved the vibe, the confetti, foam light sticks, blasts of cold air, and non-stop beats. If you get free admission to Marquee while staying at The Cosmopolitan then it is easily a 5-star night for any EDM fan.

Asian fusion tapas is how I would best describe Jayde Fuzion and Seonkyoung, the new Food Network star surely delivered with her culinary vision and concepts!

My advice is to go in a group of 4 and order a bunch of dishes and share.   We loved the Crab Salad - I believe this was one of the dishes featured in the early episode of Restaurant Express.  The salad was so fresh, light and refreshing.  The crab salad is paired with these lettuce endives and sesame wonton chips to scoop the crab goodness up.  This was one of our favorites.

You can't go wrong with the lettuce wraps stuffed with pork belly....YES....pork belly.  Next time I will get the Duck sliders and Korean street tacos as we saw many tables having these dishes.  

There are many traditional Korean dishes such as Japchae and Kalbi and for less adventurous eaters you can order a cashew chicken.  There's an even a full blown sushi bar.  

There's definitely something for everyone.   The best part is most entrees are in the $8 to $15 range so you can order several and share.  Be sure to save room for desserts.  We really enjoyed the Yuzu Donuts - I could eat a dozen of those.  Hopefully chef will bring her famous sticky Asian bbq Ribs.  If you're in the area, be sure to check out this new Asian gem at the M Resort.

Potbelly's makes a tasty little sandwich for $4.80, and an even better one for $5.00.

I was here today with some friends for their Pre- Grand Opening slated for tomorrow. A suggested donation of $5.00 went to Scottsdale Christian Academy Baseball Team (see photo). After giving my donation, I won a free shake on their spinning wheel.  All the places were food items.

Potbelly is a yummy Midwest sandwich place that has live music in all of their shops.  The older locations have tall ceiling where a banjo, or guitar player sits on the top of the booth area while playing away.  This location has a guitar playing in the corner on the right as you come in. Very cool.

As for the food, Potbelly is known primarily for their their Wreck sub which is $5.00.  It's made with salami, roast beef, turkey and ham along with swiss cheese. They also have two similar subs called:  "Italian" with capicola, mortadella, pepperoni, salami with provolone cheese, also $5.00; and a "Pizza Sandwich" which has many of the above cold cuts but with marinara sauce.  I've had both before and they are good too.

Those are their three upscale sandwiches for $5.00, but their regular ones for $4.80 are equally good.  I particularly like the Roast Beef (which I had today, see photo), but the Turkey Breast, Smoked Ham, Meatball are all delicious.  
  
I've been told by Jim their JV Manager, that their 30% larger sandwiches, called "Bigs", will be rolled out later in the year.  Nice. You also need to try their hand-dipped shakes and smoothies. Delicious!

Enjoy!

Over the last few days, I've eaten here four times.

First, I took my daughter for a late dinner on Tuesday night; then I sprung a friend over at Westminster Retirement for his first Chicago Italian Beef yesterday; then my son on his last night in Scottsdale wanted some comfort food before journeying to California for his new job; and lastly, today we had a UYE with Phoenix Buffet King Rand H, Robyn N, Mike C and his fiancee Jackie R.

Over the last few days I've gotten to know Mike Portillo pretty well.  He's a great guy who is in charge of Training at his family's restaurants and is here working the kitchen with the rest of his employees. Given the crazy opening three months ago, he's done an incredible job! A textbook management case study if you ask me!

The food is still great!  And now, that some our out of town guests have returned to points north, it's easier to get in and out of here. The place today was packed, but with three/four cashiers working, the wait-time was less than ten minutes to get your food. Nice!

Sooooo, if you feel like an Italian Beef, Combo with sausage, or a Chicago "Red Hot" stop on by.

Now a shout-out to Nancy P, who is next door at Scottsdale Health waiting to deliver her son and tells me: "Think my hubby will be spending a lot of time in line here while I'm recovering after our son is born!"  You hear that Mike!

***The rotating and constantly moving stage of Ka is very impressive; also impressive are the many cinematic elements that Ka employs, making the show feel dramatic, exciting and unique***

Ka was my first Cirque show and I enjoyed it.  The production values were great and the stage and theater were both very impressive.  The show feels like a real spectacle and with the amazing stage, Ka feels like a show that you could only see in Vegas.

There are other good things about Ka.  I really liked how they made the show cinematic.  With the music and the great lighting, there are moments in the show that feel like you are watching a movie on the big screen (the best example is when they make the stage look like its underwater and with the curtain and lighting, it appears that one of the performers is saving someone from drowning and rising to the surface--very well done).

They try to tell a story with Ka too.  It is not a great story, but the story elements kept my interest in Ka more than Mystere (which was more like a series of disjointed vignettes).  Still, after a while, I felt like I had seen enough and I got a little bored.

There are definitely some strong acrobatics, but you might not see the big and more traditional acrobatics like you would see in Mystere.  Still, there is a piece with huge moving spheres that is very exciting, suspenseful and fun.

Ticket prices for Ka are not too bad.  You can typically find tickets for a lower price than O.

The theater is nice (with a good temperature) and they had some decent concessions.  The theater is also roomy enough and does not feel as packed or hot as Mystere's theater.

I enjoyed Ka.  I am not sure if I am ever going to be a huge fan of Cirque shows, but I thought there were mainly elements of Ka that will stick with me (much more than Mystere).  With the very nice venue, the amazing stage and the great cinematic elements, Ka feels like a special and worthwhile show (definitely worth considering if you are in Vegas and looking for a good show).

Ka is in the MGM Grand, which features free parking (both valet and a parking structure--very easy to find a spot in this parking structure).

Here's the deal on the new stadium. The parking situation has improved dramatically from their former location. There are people directing traffic and parking is $7 bucks. There are a lot of great food and beverage options at this park. I had the beef & sausage combo with giardineria without the bread falling apart. Definitely a five star meal. They have food trucks located within the park grounds which you have access to during the game. The Dos Gringos watering hole is in the shade and is awesome when the Cubs are getting spanked 11-0. Drown those sorrows, there's always next year.

Seating in the stands is like sitting in the middle seat on an airplane. These seats seem to be smaller than Wrigley Field and not as much leg room. The guy next to me was wondering where he could pay the extra $10 bucks to get more headroom. There was a spinner in front of me that didn't seem to have a problem fitting in her seat, but she was obviously in the minority. I could only take about 3 innings before I had to get out and walk around. The next time I go to this stadium I'll sit on the lawn.

Also, the sound system is poor when you are in the stands. You can't hear anything. It's okay when you are in the outfield. I guess the funniest thing I saw was this guy using his binoculars to read the menu when he was 5 feet away from the counter. Yes - the menu writing is really small. I have better than 20-20 vision and I can't read it until I get to the counter.

This is a nice new watering hole for the area, which serves some Mexican inspired pub grub. 

We came for Happy Hour around 5 on a Saturday afternoon. Granted, it was probably unfair of us to come here after last week's foodie extravagance at Gallo Bianco in Phoenix.  But we found the food good and the drinks cold, always a plus. 

The atmosphere is a cross between a sports bar and a Mexican beach cantina. They have a large bar area which extends out onto the sidewalk. You can sit on bar stools outside, on a ceramic window area and still see the game on their two HDTVs inside. 

Salt and Lime is a bar where Dos Equis Lager, Corona Light or Modelo Dark are on tap for $4.00 and come in a pint glass, while their small wine list was $7 a glass. Salt & Lime doesn't carry or serve Sangria. They also had several margaritas on the menu starting at $6 and going up from there. 

The food was good and what you would expect. We started with Guacamole for $5.50 (photo) and shared an order of Nachos ($8.50).  The guacamole had some mango through it, which made it interesting; while the nachos were drizzled with several different types of cheeses. Not bad for bar food. 

Since these appetizers were filling, we ordered some Empanadas ($5.25) and a couple of Tacos for $3.25 each. The empanadas came with shredded chicken(photo) but were overly doughy and had a flour after-taste. The Carne Asada tacos were good, but admittedly we were spoiled from last week's adventure at Gallo. 

The bill came to $42.75 plus taxes and gratuities, so expect to pay $27 each unless you're very thirsty. LOL. 

We found Salt & Lime Three Stars, A-Okay

Excalibur Hotel is child's play compared to the elite hotel resorts of Las Vegas ... at 1/2 the price tag ... making it a deal for you bargain hunters or families on vacation. If you have children or need a "beginner" hotel for the whole Vegas experience, choose Excalibur.

Welcome to the future site of a cool five-star Vegas Mecca. Once they tear this down and build a new mega-resort, you can tell your grandkids that you stayed here back when it was Excalibur. 

Until then, here's what you'll find ...

 * Hotel Rooms ... nothing fancy, but you've slept in worse (probably)
 * A Casino with lower table limits and more frowns
 * A small Sports Book for Dad to prove he was right about the home team
 * Food is like choosing a restaurant at your local mall
  ... Excalibur Buffet ($23 for dinner and less for breakfast or lunch)
  ... Buca di Beppo - American chain of Italian-style re-heated food
  ... Dick's Last Resort - The Applebee's of Vegas
  ... A Steakhouse with $41 Rib Eye Steak or a 3-course Sirloin meal for $37
  ... Baja Fresh - Mexican Fast Food
  ... Food Court with Krispy Kreme, McDonalds, Pizza Hut, Cinnabon, & more
  ... Octane Lounge (Fri/Sat) & the "Lounge" are bars for adults to reminisce
 * Entertainment is great if you're letting mom plan your trip
  ... Tournament of Kings: Jousting banquet ($66) using your hands to eat
  ... Thunder From Down Under: Mom's/Girl's Night Out ($57 - $67) - chiseled abs
  ... Australian Bee Gees - Tribute show ($45-$60) not as fun as Fallon & Timberlake on SNL
  ... Fun Dungeon is a huge arcade full of games (10am-10pm)
  ... Pool with bar & food service full of kids taking a Dungeon break
  ... Shopping is limited to mall-style boutiques for kids and mom's
  ... A Wedding Chapel - Good luck.
 * That funky aroma you smell is annoyed disappointment ... or weed

For now, Excalibur survives as a low-end property in the MGM Resorts brand (with the MGM, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay, Aria, Vdara, Mirage, and Bellagio). Its prime location on the South end of the Vegas Strip at the corner of Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd is the future site of something much, much better. Til then, Excalibur has accepted it's cheap existence and you should, too.

Woof woof, *pant*, *pant*, *pant*, woof woof  (I'll get back to this).

Keeping it real, this is an eatery created by a marketing group for a TV personality rather than a chef driven restaurant.  Words like fresh, farm raised, organic are replaced by outta bounds, awesome, righteous,  slam dunk, mack daddy.  The flavors are very bold, bordering on over the top.  Most components of a dish compete rather than compliment.    Not a big deal if you spent the evening smoking a couple of cigars or killed your pallet on a packs of cigs.

For "shareable",  respectable "sashimi won-taco" (fried won ton skin shaped like a taco shell filled with ahi mixed with a mango jicama salsa and topped with an odd sweetened soy and a wasabi aioli).  Passable but the aioli adds a flabbiness to the dish and obscures the flavor of the fish.  The "fondue dippers" are bizarre.  Breadsticks are wrapped in pepperoni then self dipped into a fondue of  oil stabilized provolone, sausage, and tomato.  Fans of a greasy pizza will be right at home.

On to the sandwiches and burgers:

"Come Rod.  Come here boy.  Sit.  Awww that's a good boy.  Now shake hands.  Awww Rod's a good doggie".

Contrary to what my ex might say, I'm not a dog.  I don't expect my meal to be tossed on a plank, burger falling over, only half on the bun, toppings and sauce spilling everywhere and fries thrown on for good measure.

A "big dipper" features tender slices of prime rib, smothered by melting pepper jack cheese, topped by over seasoned deep fried onions in a garlic spread with excessive, bitter horseradish.  Impossible to pick up, grease and oil mask the flavor of the beef.  The "off-da-hook smash burger" sports a decent mix of beef but obliterated by the cloyingly sweet, excessive bourbon bbq sauce.  They claim the bun is brioche, honestly the sauce kills the taste buds.  Finally the "mac-n-cheese bacon burger"  Cloying, greasy, way over the top.  The overstuffed burger is impossible to pickup and messy to eat.  A side of flavorful but soggy fries accompanies all selections.

Props for service.  Fast and attentive.  

Great for the Vegas tourist looking for the show.  Locals and regulars look elsewhere.

So you are lost in Sin City and you want some sinning and debauchery... what will you do? Go down to the pool and hit on every member of the opposite sex till someone goes yeah lets hook it up? Or is that too blunt in yo face and chit? If it's the latter, perhaps a trip to Sapphire may be in order since it is a "klassy" establishment... 

Well at least they want you to think that they are klassy... marble columns, a portico faade, travertine floors/wall panels, sculptures and large vases, and a podium with security flanking that want to cop a feel before you can move further into the establishment.

Pro Tip: Free ride over for larger parties in a limo or limo bus...

So once you get inside, then you run into problems. If your group goes in without having purchased "bottle service" well you are screwed. There is literally no where you can sit except for a few seats surrounding the stages which were mostly empty or filled with ugly girls when I was there. So lets think this through... you want to go see some dancers and there is nowhere to sit down unless you spend ridiculous amounts of cash on a bottle of liquor. Like 5-10 times the normal value for said bottle at an average liquor store. Talk about a racquet, you know I don't think they would make as much running prostitutes hahaha well unless you want to get a "private room" and I have no clue what those things would cost...

So once you realize you are screwed without bottle service and finally purchase it, the "damsels in distress" errr girls on who knows what come over and beg for drinks and to give you a "private" dance better known as a lap dance.  Well most of the girls that I saw here were just not my type. Some were downright scary... was it ugly girls night at the Sapphire? I have no clue but it was not the typical exotic dancer experience that I have had in the past. 

The best looking women there seemed to be the waitresses and they wouldn't talk to you hardly at all unless you were buying a bottle or three at the ridiculously inflated prices that they were demanding. Overall, my friend who was a bachelor had a blast while we were there, but when we were brought in and expected one thing and pulled the bait and credit card charge swap for an extra $800 really sucked for the rest of us. Ohhh and that was for 3 bottles and mixers haha *SMH*

Consequently I am not a fan of this joint and do not plan on returning here... So yeah don't say I didn't warn ya... bait and switched...

Lord knows how many businesses have come and gone at this address over the years like Underworld, Black Label, and Emergency Room etc.  Its transformation into Gyu-Kaku has been nothing short of amazing.  The ultra cool lit entrance begged the question...does Tron eat here?  Being seated while a female sung cover of Savage Garden's "Truly, Madly, Deeply" at 300 BPM's blared through the stereo made me think it possible if he were drunk.  

We considered the course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 for a moment but saw a lot of filler that would have ended up untouched like cheese wontons, chicken cheese fondue, house salad, fried chicken (ok,ok, maybe one piece), calamari and S'mores.  Our initial server, Keiko, recommended we start with the spicy cabbage salad over the kim-chee.  Thankfully, we listened.  Crispy, spicy and dare I say refreshing?  It was a fine way to whet our appetite.        
 
Standing out among with meats was the beef tongue and harami skirt steak.  Quality matched the price and both delivered on what decent yakiniku should be.  We also enjoyed the kalbi short rib and although the Angus beef ribs were a little too fatty for the wife, I happily devoured it.  The mushroom medley cooked in an unbeatable combination of soy sauce and butter was a nice side dish.  

The only letdown was the "Spicy Kalbi Bibimbap".  They got the stone pot right but the rest of it?  It was as if it were made by a northern Swedish resident with no knowledge of Korean cuisine attempting to replicate it through hearsay.  I would have rather ordered the sliced duck breast, an atypical yakiniku offering, or dessert over this pointless filler.  

Despite that, I know I'll be back and stick to grilling.  It's yet another welcome dining choice around Spring Mountain.  3.46729311238987 stars.

Living up to the hype.  A warm and contemporary Italian American eatery that delivers great tastes with the energy that is Vegas.  

This is not an authentic taste of Italian regional specialties rather refined and prettied up versions of Italian American favorites.  All good, it works.

The majority of the menu centers around small plates of antipasti shared family style.  Flavors are very complimentary so ordering a wide variety of dishes works.  An incredible simple grilled broccoli rabe natural bitterness is enhanced by hints of char and smoke but brought to life by a spicy, chili vinaigrette.  Sweet peppers stuffed with a tangy goat cheese and peppery olive oil create a very well balanced dish exploding with freshness.

For seafood antipasti, do not pass on the lobster arancini.  Dressed with a spicy pomodoro of Calabria chili and a touch of a herbaceous basil aioli that elevates the sweetness of the lobster.  Slightly cloying mouth feel but great flavors.  

Great selection of well made salumi.  Try a variety.  The Bresaola and finocchiona as good as any in Tuscany.  Add a selection of cheeses with perfectly paired condiments (Mozzarella with a citrus chili pesto,  Parmigiano with honey).  

Small selection of pastas.  The lobster ravioli excellent.  Perfectly cooked sheets of pasta surrounding chunks of barely cooked through lobster perfumed by tarragon.  Richness on richness but it works.

The only weakness of the restaurant are the mains.  A mustard, walnut, and raisin crusted rack of lamb, while perfectly cooked was one dimensional, needing more herbaceous, lemony gremolata.  A bone in "Tuscan" rib-eye topped with a sunny side up egg did not make sense.   The yolk did nothing to elevate the flavor of the beef rather giving it an unpleasant yolky aftertaste as it cooled.

Service is a work in progress.  Slow and lacking confidence.  This will definitely improve with time.

Decent wine list at Vegas resort prices.

Guys, admit it, Giada turned you on to cooking shows.  Now the chance is here to try the food you know you never cooked.  Worthy.

As I walked up to will call about thirty minutes to showtime, I was astounded at the line of people to the right of the Crown Theater entrance.  "Damn! Is it like this every night?" I asked the box office person.  "Every Saturday night." he said.  You'd think that the actual "King of Pop" himself was about to hit the stage.  Fortunately, I had golden circle seats and avoided all of that.  Maybe tip the guys working the front to get in early and dodge that whole debacle or fake an injury, start limping and tell them you need to be seated immediately.  It was 90 percent full.    
    
MJ's Live?  Four different cast members play him throughout the week.  We were fortunate to see Justin Dean.  The moves and mannerisms were as believable as they could possibly be.  To his credit, I had a hard time telling when he was actually singing or lip-synching.  He would switch from singing into his headset mic and then to a regular handheld throughout while still wearing the headset which was kind of weird but whatever.

The audience took everything over the top.  One guy at the table up front was sporting a full on MJ Jheri curl hairstyle with sunglasses that he wore the entire time.  At another table was an adorable 3 year old with his own plastic mic that danced his face off, and even did some pop star poses with the guitar player.  Then there were the folks looking for a complete suspension of disbelief and going batshit crazy the whole hour.  "OMG! We luuuuvvv you Michaaaaaaaaal!"  Someone needed a Pepsi.

I can't find the exact word for all of it, but there was a fun, schlocky, "am I really being entertained by this right now?" vibe to the whole deal.  Kids would love it.  3.5 stars.

What a great place for breakfast! BBD has a very warm, friendly, family feel to it. Cindi was our server and she is fantastic! She took the time to answer all our questions and never let my coffee cup go empty. The coffee by the way was delicious! The menu was on newspaper and there are stories also on it telling the (you are allowed to keep it) story of BBD and other stuff. Most of the food on the menu is made from scratch and it says you can customize your order any way that you like and if they can do it, they will.

I ordered from their "little less" menu which has smaller portions. It was still enough to fill me! For $6.99 I had 1 egg, 2 pieces of bacon, hash browns and sourdough toast. The egg was cooked just the way I ordered it, the bacon had great flavor, the hash browns were too tasty and the sourdough toast was great! Something simple as breakfast is easy to mess up, but they do it right here. I also ordered a "Bear Claw" priced at $4.49 however I was too stuffed from breakfast to tackle that big boy! Cindi packed it to-go for me and said to just pop it in the microwave for 25-30 seconds before I'm ready to eat it. She also said the bear claws are made at each location daily! That bear claw made for one mighty fine dessert :)

Lunch and dinner is also served here at BBD. I have no doubt it is probably tasty, but I'm sure this will me more of a breakfast spot for me since I enjoyed that so much.

Don't get fooled by the Trio of fries!!!

If i see a fries sampler, i always want to get all of them. It said on the menu- waffle fries, steak fries and petit fries. You would think petit fries would be shoestrings (a neighbor made the same mistake), but they were just mini waffle fries. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=F4NLspbB1o4xetDmIEKmXQ. You're better off just ordering two different kinds. We ended up too full and not even finishing half of the trio order. Good to share though between 4 people or more. 

I got the signature burger Le Paris. Comes with brie, caramelized onions and bacon. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=5ZAFIRT5zqm6FeTlTH-9zg Tony got the Le Blue http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=t3WtvkSrPOn7tGN-TZwrLw with blue cheese, avo and bacon. 
The burgers were decent, but at 12 bucks each, i wanted Uhmaaazzing and they were not. The hefty burger patty was perfectly round and flattened, but i like my hamburger kind of mishapen so you get those nice charred marks around the edges. 

Service was friendly, everything tasted ok, but i wasn't wowed enough to add to my vegas favorites. 
Inside the Paris Hotel. 
Buddies: please chime in on your best burger in vegas!

At last, Mr. Lee's Woonam Jung adds AYCE Korean BBQ to their menu. Ordering their tender, delicious Kalbi a la carte certainly put a hole in my pocket. As tasty as it was, I had a difficult time paying $30 for a plate of it on top of whatever entree I ate. Sura has some serious competition now that Mr. Lee threw his hat into the AYCE KBBQ ring. 

For a measly $26 at dinner, you can fill your three stomachs with all the Kalbi you want and your other three with bulgogi, chadolbaegi (thinly sliced beef brisket), samgyupsal (pork belly), dak (chicken) bulgogi , deh ji (pork) bulgogi plus the steamed egg and doenjang jjigae (soybean soup) traditionally served with a Korean BBQ meal. Given you have six full stomachs and still have room to spare, all of this and more is 'bottomless' and you still get a 5-star worthy selection of fresh banchan. 

Think of those pricey front-loading washer/dryers. Yeah, those shiny, fancy ones that are so quiet you can take a nap in the laundry room. They're considerably less annoying than their top-loading ancestors. Where am I going with this? Woonam Jung uses the fancy front-loaders of BBQ hoods--nearly silent and 1,000x more efficient. You won't have to project your voice over a noisy fan and you'll go home smelling like your perfume of the night instead of grilled meat. 

While Woonam Jung doesn't look like much from the outside, the inside is nicely decorated and has this Asian tranquility thing going for it. In short, it's a more luxurious establishment to stuff your face. If you want to up your dining experience or fancy up the act of over-eating, Woonam Jung's food presentation, modern plates, and cute server uniforms will not disappoint.

AYCE BBQ is available at lunch-time. But I hope you like bulgogi because kalbi isn't served until dinner. And if for whatever reason you're not into the AYCE BBQ thing or great deals make you feel cheap, BBQ is still available to purchase a la carte and their other entrees are flat out delicious! The yukgaejang and dolsot bibimbap are two of my favorites.

I love art in all forms--paintings, sculpture, poetry, song, and dance.  I am a "FIRM" believer in supporting artists because they try to tell us a story--through their eyes.  On Saturday, my friend and I stuffed our faces with bacon wrapped hot dogs at Echo Park for Javier's Bacon Wrapped Goodness UYE.  Afterwards, we had nothing to do and thought why not go out and support our starving artists--it's all about giving back.  Lets go to Vegas!!

Service - Woohoo! As good as it gets! + soft and silky skin
Cleanliness - Ambiguous
Price - Enough!
Seafood - Yes, some people refer it to that.
Meats - Yes, yes, yes!!
Vegetables - I think this costs extra.
Dessert - Yes it is.
Fruits - Forbidden fruit?

What was ordered:

"Stoner" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - This Anglo artist told me that she works better inebriated.  I was interested enough to purchase her body of work for my friend--who was also inebriated.  As Stoner revealed her art, she yelled out "And they are all natural!!"  I am "technically" a doctor since I was a Biological Science major as an undergrad and I have some expertise in human anatomy.  The mammary were indeed natural and quite a stunning pair.
 
"Ms. Foodie" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - This Asian artist hails from Arizona and is a recent transplant to Las Vegas.  Her and I had a thorough conversation regarding food.  She loves food trucks because the food is so tasty, cheap, and is convenient in her line of work.  "The Foodie" also loves breakfast and a big fan of dumplings.  She loves to dance to Trance music.  Her body of art is all natural and very inspiring--Frida Kahlo would love her work.

"Frisco" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - "Frisco" is from the Norcal region--San Jose to be exact.  I told her I went to school in Sacramento.  "Frisco" found it amusing that Sacramento rhymed with Frisco.  She chose the name Frisco because it sounded sexier than San Jose.  She loves to dance to Trance music.  Her body of work is all natural--and all so buttery smooth.  "Frisco" told me she is selective with her clients--must be my innocent eyes.  She gave me a kiss on the cheek and told me to go find her later.

"Brazil" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - "Brazil" comes from the lovely country of Brazil.  She loves soccer.  I told her "Soccer?!  You must mean "futbol."  She was very impressed that I knew that--Brazil told me that my name is spelled Joan in Brazilian--accent on the "a."  I asked her what is her favorite food in Brazil and she told me bbq meat--she goes back once a year.  I am a giver so I purchased one of her bodies of art for my friend.  She loves to dance to all kinds of music.  I was too busy perusing Frisco's catalog to notice whether Brazil's art was natural or not.

"Mexican Fusion" ($20.00) - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 stars) - The young and innocent Mexican Fusion is from Anaheim as well--lucky me.  Her friend was putting on a show and invited her to come along this one night--she didn't have to drive so tagged along.  This artist is a fusion of Mexican and Spanish--her father is from Spain so she gets her light complexion and dark hair from him.  My guess is that she got her body from her mother--lucky me.  She also likes to dance to Trance music.  Mexican Fusion's body of art is all natural--lucky me.

I can already imagine the responses to this review--"Where are the pictures, John?!"  It is true that a picture is worth a thousand words, however, I believe art needs to be experience face-to-face--in the moment.  I strongly urge for all of you to go support your local artists!  FYI - Art ain't cheap!

Another fun staycation. I'm just glad it was free! The room was clean and spacious enough for us. We let them know ahead of time that we would need to use the sofa bed and they assured us that it would have a blanket, sheets and pillows, but it didn't. The sofa bed was not comfortable and flimsy. The following morning were able to get room service to set the bed up right. It still wasn't comfy, but at least had sheets and such. The regular bed was comfy and roomy. Room service spoiled me with a bag of yummy caramel popcorn that I couldn't put down. The kitchen area is nice if you bring your own pots, pans, utensils and food! The kitchen was bare. I didn't plan on cooking a meal anyway so found it useless. There is a small stove-top yet no coffee maker? I didn't get that. At least at a "motel" I would have had a coffee maker and coffee/tea packets complimentary. The fridge was stocked, but I didn't get anything from it since it is overpriced. Be careful when opening these fridges because if you even pick something up to look at, the sensor will know and charge your room for it. 

There is a cafe, bar, starbucks and of course room service for food options, but nothing else as far as I could see for dining. At least there are other hotels within City Center to check out dining options at and of course shopping. I can't say I would recommend this place to anyone but if you get the chance to stay here for free, do it!

A smooth club promoter named Emmanuel approached us in the mall and dangled free champagne before us.

Now...

I am a champagne lush. I don't like much else... unless it involves fruit, ice, and well...a sophisticated combination of Baileys, Guinness, and Jamison - but I am all over...yes all over - anything having to do with champagne.

So after watching the incredible Le Reve - we made our way over to Blush, with our VIP bands, to get our bubbly on.

I have to admit that I didn't have high expectations for the space, so Blush exceeded any and all pre-conceived notions I had. There was plenty of room to move, good music, the bartenders and cocktail waitresses were friendly (and hot...), the space itself was glamorous and sophisticated, and as soon as we found ourselves in the picturesque and daintily lit outside patio area, some nice folks smiled at us and quickly made room on their table.

It was our first night in Las Vegas, and with our fake eyelashes batting, our brown skin hues pressed up the white chairs, and our bubbling champagne in hand - we couldn't help but bask in the sexy outdoor glow of the night. 

For any girls looking for a low-key way to start the night, I couldn't recommend Blush more. Unfortunately for guys, they do charge a 30 dollar cover, which Blush, though chic and beautiful - is not worth.

Also, while you won't have to fight your way through a glazed eyed crowd, one could even remark and find fault with how mellow the crowd is/was. 

When we were there, people were evidently interested in conversing and mingling. Very few people, in fact no people were dancing, despite the quality music flowing through the lovely space. 

I personally loved the low-key vibe of Blush, but if you're looking for your destination Vegas night spot  full of of table top-dance moves - Blush may be too timid for your liking.

I have been to Marquee a few times already, but this time is THE WORST experience ever. Yeah, the lines are extremely long, the wait is probably 1-2 hours, and it was crowded in the venue...but all this still won't make me as mad and as disappointed...

Basically,  two of my friends and I had a couple drinks at the bar, then we went to the dance floor and started dancing. My friend and I decided to take another shot at the bar...While we were walking to the bar, we got stopped by the security and asked us to follow them. At this point, I thought that, "I guess I am really fucked up and I'm going to get kicked out!"

So we continue to follow the security, which leaded us into a room. Next thing the security in the room yelled at us and said, "Where is the E? Why are you guys selling E?"  The fact that we did not have any E or drugs, my friend and I were really confused. We told them we didn't have any drugs, but the security kept yelling and questioning us and even said that they got us on tape for evidence.

At this point, I was EXTREMELY frustrated and felt very disrespected, so I took all my belongs out from my pocket and told them," Find the fucking E if you can!!!"  Since they couldn't find E or drugs, you would think that they would apologize for the mistake and let us go... HELL to the Fucking No... They said, "Here's the deal: you guys are banned from Marquee, Tao and the Cosmopolitan property forever." Then, they took a picture of us, and released us from the back door... is this a fucking joke?

First of all, your asses did not find any drugs from my friend and I. Second, you guys were even trying to threaten us with all kind of tricks: "We have everything on the tape!" "We will call the police!" and other bullshits as well, to forces us to admit something we did not do! Where is the fucking justice?!

It had been over a decade since I last stayed at the MGM.  Came here during Yelps Spring break and was hoping to get into one of the newly renovated rooms but I ended up in the regular ones.  It was the same weekend as the Billboard Music award.  Too bad I didn't see any celebs.

We got the first room right off the elevator.  I was thinking it was going to be noisy with all the peeps coming and going and the up and down of the elevator but it was actually pretty quite.  The 2 queens size beds were comfortable and the room spacious enough for 2 people.  Big bathroom with plenty of counter space for all the hair and makeup stuff.  

On the evening of the 2nd day we were surprised with a special delivery of champagne and sweets.  We almost made the guy leave stating to him that we didn't order anything LOL.  Well he got our names right and it was a little something from the hotel to welcome us.  

Im not very picky when it comes to hotel accommodations.  As I don't tend to spend much time in the hotel room.  As long as it had a comfortable bed, a TV, nice size shower with good water pressure Im happy.  That said the one thing I was disappointed about was the WiFi.  It was struggling a bit.

Local ~ On the Strip
Room ~ 2 Queen beds and on the 18th floor.
Stay ~ Clean and comfortable.
Extras ~ WiFi struggled a bit.

**Sleek, upscale and reminiscent of the flashy places on Sunset Blvd in West Hollywood, The Cosmopolitan attracts a young crowd and feels much more distinct than the other nearby and new casino/hotel Aria***

I did not stay at The Cosmopolitan hotel, but I did spend a little time in the hotel (including the rooms).  The Cosmopolitan is the new hotel that is adjacent to the CityCenter but not part of it (one of the towers, from the outside, looks similar to the Ritz Carlton at LA Live).

Like Aria (located in the CityCenter), The Cosmopolitan is less themed than other Vegas hotels (like Bellagio, Venetian, Mirage, Paris, and so on).  So if you are not a fan of those themed places, you may like The Cosmopolitan.

I can see how some people would find The Cosmopolitan a little boring when compared to some of the other Vegas casinos.  Luckily, The Cosmopolitan does have a few noticeable advantages over Aria and provides a much more unique experience.

First, the decor is nicer.  Very upscale, sleek and contemporary.  The atmosphere throughout the hotel and the casino floor reminded me of some of the nice and trendy places you may find on Sunset Blvd in West Hollywood.  I felt there was a sense of style and point-of-view with The Cosmopolitan while Aria felt much more sterile.

The Cosmopolitan (which was designed to bring in some residential business) also features bigger rooms with more apartment-like features such as kitchenettes.  All the rooms I went to had balconies, which were nice (haven't seen that on The Strip).  The balconies were also thoughtfully designed to prevent accidents.  Depending on which side of the building your room is located, you may get treated to a great view of Paris, Bellagio and the Bellagio Fountains.

Finally, The Cosmopolitan was bringing in a lot of young people (at least right now).  That might be a plus or negative depending on your life stage.  Place was definitely crowded and hopping.

Several of the restaurants at The Cosmopolitan have locations in L.A. (Scarpetta, Comme Ca and STK).  I think they also have some upscale shopping boutiques, but I did not check them out.

The Cosmopolitan is a nice hotel and it is one I would consider staying at if the price was right.  The balcony is a nice touch and the rooms were also nice.  It also has a great location by being near other big casinos like Bellagio, Caesars Palace and MGM Grand.  And unlike Aria, it is much closer to The Strip.  If I wanted to try one of the newer hotels out (in the CityCenter or near it), I think The Cosmopolitan would be my first choice.

I saw valet parking here.  I am not sure if they also have a parking structure for self-parking.

Like ancient Rome, Caesars Palace is old, but still impressive.

Caesars has done a decent job of upgrading rooms, restaurants, and entertainment in an effort to keep up with best of Vegas. Sure, for similar prices you can usually find a 5-star Las Vegas room, but staying at Caesars in the middle of the strip does have benefits.

The hotel has a wide range of rooms to fit just about any budget including classic rooms, tower rooms, fancy "Nobu" rooms, multi-room suites, spa suites, exclusive "Laurel" rooms, and, of course, Forum Tower Emperors Suites for bachelor parties made famous in Hangover. In room amenities vary depending on the class of the accommodations. Don't forget about the mandatory $28 Resort Fee per day when booking your stay, too.

Headliner acts often do short stints at Caesars so if you are a fan of Celine Dion, Jerry Seinfeld, Elton John, Shania Twain, Jeff Dunham, Rod Stewart, or one of the other star acts then purchase tickets online early. Absinthe is an adults-only show five nights a week that blends a cabaret vibe and raunchy humor with acrobatic skills.

Even if you don't stay at Caesars Palace, the dining and shopping options are worth a visit. The Forum Shops is a huge indoor mall of stores and restaurants under a blue sky. It's an experience to see at least once and take in the architecture, statues, and animatronic performance at the large fountain. 

For eating at Caesars, Bacchanal is the current "it" buffet with lines and prices that will make you wonder if "it" is really worth it. There are dozens of other options including chains like The Palm, Spago, Joe's Seafood, Cheesecake Factory, and such. Other name restaurants to consider are Guy Savoy, Nobu, Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, and Gordon Ramsey's Pub.

Obviously, Caesars Palace is much more than a casino. The gaming areas are relatively clean and smoke-free. Slot machines seem everywhere or sit down to play poker or blackjack for awhile.

Self-parking is free in the structure behind Caesars while valet is convenient (except when they are busy). Because Caesars Palace is in the heart of the Las Vegas strip, it is convenient to the Bellagio, Paris, Cosmopolitan, Mirage, Treasure Island, and the Venetian.

Caesars Palace has remained remarkably relevant for over 50 years. Even though it isn't among the elite hotel resorts in Vegas, the "Spartacus meets Rodeo Drive" vibe is well maintained with plenty of attractions, restaurants, and shops to attract visitors and guests.

Finally!! 

I've had the Charcoal Room on my list of eats since I moved out here a few years ago.  My neighbor, some co-workers, and even friends/family from California even recommended the Charcoal Room to me. But when it came to other Yelpers, most haven't been here or reviewed them.  The Charcoal Room has a lot of pros and very little cons.  You don't get what you pay for here, you get more.  And if you're having steak, you get a lot more.  I got their petite filet and it was delicious.  Their petite is about 6 oz, juicy, and most importantly, very tasty. Don't let the price fool you.  For less than $30, I had a steak that rivals some of the 5 star steak houses out here.  My filet was so tender that I think I used a butter knife to cut through it.  I had my steak with a side of their Caesar salad, lobster corn chowder, sauted mushrooms, and asparagus.  All portions were huge and I ended up with leftovers. My GF opted for their roasted chicken and baked sweet potato.  Her meal was hooked up too.  I swear she was served half a chicken and a football sized sweet potato.  She said her meal was good as well.  

I have no complaints about the service.  We were seated right away, our orders were taken, and our food was served in a timely manner.  I left the Charcoal Room very satisfied and my only regret is not coming here sooner.  We got a lot of food and paid less than $100 for it.  Yes...I'm sure I will be back.


PS: No pictures of their steak and no pictures of their fabulous forks.  I was focused the night I ate here....focused on my beautiful date.  1OAK!

My son in law & daughter treated myself and his mom to a Mom's night out down at the Celebrity Theater.  Now this review isn't about the show we saw, but more on the venue. 

I have lived in the valley for 13 years and never knew this place existed, crazy right?

We arrived an hour early so we went down into the club area and son in law & I had some drinks, this is a cool little waiting spot, it did fill up quickly, but didn't feel over crowded. 

Then the doors opened, and I have to say, I enjoyed the set up, we were only 6 rows back from the stage, but after looking around I can't honestly say there isn't a bad seat in the house, and this is a smaller more intimate venue where the stage turns, so everyone can get a great view.  

The seats were comfortable, the show was great. I truly enjoyed my night out with them! Definitely will be checking the event calendar to see what acts/shows will be coming because I don't mind going back!

So I tried going to Drais MDW. That was a fail. I shall literally break it down.

It was after midnight Saturday night when I text the promoter Kim Paul, asking him the price for entry that night. $30 for men, $20 for women is what he said. So awesome. We were set to go. Everything else that night was over $100 for men.

We reach the cashier. Chelse, blonde, thin, early 20s. My girlfriend pays $20 cash for herself. Left is me, 1 other girlfriend and her boyfriend. I was going to pay with my card and they were going to give me the cash. So she rings me up for a total of $70. Sounds right: 20 + 20 + 30.

No. She says "now what about her?" (Referring to my friend right beside me). I said "yeah, $20, $20, $30." N she looks at me like I'm stupid. "No it was never $30 for men. It was actually $40 and that was before guestlist which closed at midnight so it's $50." I tell her "the promoter Kim Paul just told me it was $30. So I want my money back." She says "sorry, there are no refunds" all super bitchy like she owns the place. Lol. So I said "ok well bring me a manager on duty." She says "sure."

Comes back with another doofus and after I explained the situation, he said nothing. Just went to tapping on the screen. After 10 minutes, I get a "void check testing admission" receipt but total said $0.00. I ignored it and left assuming he should've known what he was doing. I'll check my account tomorrow. Silly me.

So here I am back in California calling everyday asking for a manager. On Monday I was able to reach Victor Drai's assistant. Woman. Don't recall her name. She took my name and phone number and also check number from my receipt. Of course they aren't going to call me back, so I call once a day asking for Victor Drai not knowing he was the owner. Just hoping it was the person who would post void the transaction already.

Well he was not happy to hear from me. He answers with his strong Moroccan egotistical accent "how the fuck did you get my number" and "what the fuck do you want" and "give me your fucking number my assistant will help you, not me." So I say "well she's the reason why I call asking for you because she was not able to help me." He says "you're making that up" and again "I'm not going to help you. Give me your number. Do you want to be fucking helped or not!?" I respond with a "Wow you are ridiculous" and he clicks.

I call back and finally a normal person answers and asks how did I get Victor's number. I simply said I didn't. They transfer me when I ask for him. So he new guy gives me the general manager's email so they can help me. I pray to God this is the end of it.

By far the worst customer service experience ever.

I was initially looking forward to visiting this Vietnamese restaurant because of the high ratings on Yelp. The interior gave a modern feel as the red, black, and light wood dcor was spaciously arranged with slow natural lighting coming through the windows.

The Com Ga Nuong ($7.50) came with pieces of chicken grilled to perfection. It was marinated with ginger, lemongrass, shallot, garlic, and served with pickled veggies and steamed rice. The chicken was moist and juicy, but the flavors on the marinade and pickled veggies were faint. The dish had promise, but the flavors were kept too safe and failed to stand out. The dish also came with a bowl of over-salted soup which I could not finish. 

The server kept asking me if I wanted to order something else. Feeling pressured, I ordered the Taro Boba ($3.99) since he said it would be made with real taro. The quality of the boba was decent at best, but the drink was made with powder instead of fresh taro.

I then turned to the female server to inquire about the drink. She said they don't have fresh taro in the restaurant and that the drink was made with powder. Moments later, the sever came back to reassure the drink was made with real ingredient. I was visibly upset by then, so the server went outside for a few minutes before returning to my table to say, "We grind up real taro into powder so it can be mixed into the drink." Since I make boba drinks at home, I can guarantee you that such practice is not only unusual, but this guy must be delusional or in the midst of a cover up.

The owner of the restaurant noticed that I was extremely dissatisfied about being lied to, but did not address the issue to intervene. The second server was at fault too since she did not comp the drink or bring it to the ownership's attention. I told her, "I wouldn't have ordered this drink if I know it's not made with real taro."

I have been eating taro since childhood so I can distinguish those that are artificially made. To insist that they were telling the truth, after the second server had already admitted to the error, earned them a zero star for 1) up selling their customers, 2) dishonesty, 3) lack of intervention and apology to fraud, 4) indifferent ownership.

I would never come back to support this business and encourage the public to do the same.

Finally... a buffet where Quantity = Quality. Of course, it is still a buffet, so, don't come expecting this to be a 5-star dining experience or some romantic dinner for two. The Buffet at Wynn Las Vegas is a 5-star buffet experience ... with buffet being the key word.

We came for dinner and left about 2 1/2 hours later. I'm sure our waitress thought we were pigs. I know we felt like pigs ... and didn't really care because we loved the food so much.

 - Fresh-prepared food like a Pasta counter, Salad station, and custom Crepes 
 - Mounds of Crab Legs and Shrimp
 - Lamb, Prime Rib, & Game Hen
 - Try to get a table in the well-lit courtyard. It's a nicer atmosphere.
 - Gelato, Candied Apples, Profiteroles, and Chocolate-covered Marshmallows
 - Cheeses and Charcuterie
 - Dim Sum dumplings (so-so) and other Asian dishes
 - More, more, and more.

It may sound like every other buffet and while it is, it also isn't. The little things are nicer. The food is better. The buffet is better.

Rosati's Pizza is my go to pizza joint. They are basically a carry out place. I live too far away for delivery. So that tells you how far I'll travel for an excellent tasting pizza.

They currently have this special where you buy a large and get the medium (excludes the toppings) 1/2 off. I hope I haven't let the secret out on that special. It's been going on for well over a year. I always bump into a lot of Chicago people when in here. I always get a bigger pizza than I can eat since it's the perfect breakfast food. After all, who can resist some reheated pizza the next morning for breakfast!

I really like the thin crust but my family prefers the deep dish. So I'm stuck eating deep dish all the time, lol. This is the best tasting pizza I have had in Arizona. The Cenpho folks might want to venture out of their box and try this pie. This is something even the east coasters would enjoy. 

Once in awhile they'll even mess up your order but they are quick to rectify it if you give them a chance. And once in awhile they'll even burn your pizza a little. Even with these rare annoyances I keep coming back to this Rosati's location every time.

El Dorado Cantina is one of my favorite new restaurants in town.  This definitely rivals Javier's at Aria for the "high end" Vegas Mexican cuisine market, but the prices are way more reasonable.  Chef Paco and his staff are churning out some really good stuff.  

Want a great way to spice up a weekday dinner?  How about doing as the Aztecs did back in the day (century) and start off with some grasshoppers?  Yes, sir!  EDC's "chapulines" can be prepared sauted either in garlic lime or habanero.  For the uninitiated, the closest thing to compare them to would be crispy shrimp tails but juicier.  The habanero order offered terrific heat and not in a painful, shoot me in the face kind of way.  At $7.50, it was a large portion that could have easily satisfied a party of six.  Not for everyone by any means, my wife was literally one and done, but I enjoyed it and had plenty to take home (fried rice, anyone?).

"Imperial Shrimp" was everything I look for in an appetizer: seafood stuffed Pacific wild shrimp wrapped in bacon and then lightly fried. The creamy heat (sounds gross, right?) from the chipotle ranch dressing that accompanied the dish was awesome.  More things in life should be wrapped in bacon!  I should start a national campaign.

We chose to split the humungous carne asada entre.  The citrus marinated steak was medium rare perfection.  I loved the big slabs of grilled cactus that it came with.  We probably boxed up 70 percent of the plate.  Goddamn nachos and salsa....

You'd think that would prevent us from ordering dessert, but the flan and tres leches cake somehow made it to the table.  The latter was plated nicely and the rum flavor made me feel like I was on vacation.  It was a great end to the meal and I can't wait to try more.

The Trump Hotel is a great crash pad when you're in Vegas. It being a holiday weekend, most resort/casinos on the strip were priced pretty high. However, I was able to find a great deal at Trump on Expedia for $109/night. 

We got a great room on the 57th floor facing the strip. The rooms are nicely appointed. All rooms have two doors to get through so you are away from the hallway and it's extremely quiet. There is a kitchenette that is fully stocked with a stove, microwave, fridge, toaster, blender, utensils, pots, pans, plates, pasta strainer, martini shaker and more. You can cook all your meals right inside your room, but there really isn't a grocery store nearby, so it's pretty unlikely that you will. Each room has a comfy king bed and a sofa bed so you can sleep up to 4. The bathroom has a huge jacuzzi tub and separate shower, and a tv right in the mirror. There is plenty of closet space. And there's also free wi-fi.

The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and you'll receive top notch service as you would expect from a luxury hotel. And that's all it really is. It is NOT a resort/casino. There are only two restaurants, one bar, a pool, spa and gift shop. Which means you'll be spending most of your time being entertained at other places. While it's located across the street from Encore/Wynn and next to the mall, it is set back from the strip, and you will end up taking taxis everywhere you go. So, on one hand, it's nice that you don't have to walk 20 minutes through a casino to get to your room, but if you're there to gamble, this is not the hotel for you.

4 stars for the value and the great customer service. Plus, they allowed early check-in and late check-out. But if you want to go all out, I'd suggest Palazzo or Encore.

"Eat rice, drink tea, slurp noodles, stay healthy".  Maybe.

Accept this about all Asian restaurants on the Strip:
1)  Prices are 2x-3x higher than your local joint.
2)  Portions are smaller but prettier.
3)  Flavors are not authentic.
4)  Specialty drinks are delicious.
5)  Service is excellent.

Straight to it, the food.  It's properly cooked by Western standards.  Veg in stir fries are still crisp and vibrant, deep fried chicken still moist, and scallops tender not rubber balls.  Seasonings and flavors are loosely Asian but are subdued and for the uninitiated.  Don't expect undertones of sweet, fermented fish sauce or umame charged fermented black beans.  The subdued flavors do work better with their creative mixed drinks.

Skip the everyday items or risk leaving upset at the price (miso soup at $9, beef broccoli at $25).  Opt for the extravagant.  The lobster tail in ginger onion soy glaze is good.  Correctly cooked.  The simple earthy soy does enhance the sweetness of the lobster and the ginger adds zest.  The togarashi rubbed seared ahi with a miso lime sauce is very good.

The only serious fault remains the sushi.  Questionable freshness.  The Uni, off color and fishy.  The sweet shrimp, slightly ammoniated and tacky mouth feel.  Creative rolls still miss the mark.  Over sauced, unbalanced flavors, bizarre cooking techniques.  Is the chef so vain he can't try one of the many AYCE joints and see how Vegas style sushi is done?  Face it, asking a Chinese chef to prepare Japanese sushi is the same as asking a Italian pizza cook to make dim sum.

To the credit of management, service problems have been correct.  Everyone is familiar with the menu and can describe dishes.  Bar staff who float ask regular staff before making recommendations.

Standard Asian beers.  Fairly priced introductory sakes.  

Want authentic national and regional Asian cuisines, look off the Strip.  Looking for some great cocktails and correctly cooked "Asian" inspired food Rice and Company modestly delivers.

If you want a legit donut then come here to Friendly Donut House! Even if you don't live in the Henderson area, this local run mom & pop business is worth the drive. After hearing so much about it from yelpers and co-workers, I met hubby here for a quick breakfast before work and wasn't disappointed! When I walked in there were several old timers hanging out talking, playing cards and reading the paper. There was this instant family feel that was comforting and inviting. The woman behind the counter greeted us and was patient with us while we made the hard decision of which donut to try. We picked out our few donuts and when I asked if they had any milk, the woman behind the counter said they had regular and chocolate. I was so stoked to see it was "Anderson Dairy" milk! I grew up on that stuff and am addicted to the chocolate milk. Score! The smaller milks were a $1 each. 

So we ended up with a "Bear Claw", "Apple Fritter" and "Cinnamon Roll" that were $1.75 each. The bear claw was filled with apples and it was SO good! I never thought that I could find a place that comes close to my favorite donut shop in Placentia, Ca, but this place does! I split the donut in half with hubby and was pleasantly stuffed. Even though I was stuffed, I managed to take 2 bites of the apple fritter and couldn't believe the apple explosion in my mouth! This was a fritter that had tons of apples in it and all the textures a fritter should have. The cinnamon roll ended up going to one of my co-workers because we just had no room left and wanted someone to enjoy it fresh. How does anybody ever decide on one donut at this place? I will have to go full on and get a dozen to take home next time!

Friendly Donut House accepts CA$H ONLY!

On a recent trip to Las Vegas we stayed at The Cosmo for two nights. I had stayed there once before and wasn't a fan but had a much better experience this time around. Our room was beautiful. It had a balcony and a huge tub over looking a great view of Vegas. The room was very nicely decorated with a Jonathan Adler feel. 

The gym had great equipment and a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. But they did not offer bottled water, only a water machine with cups, which is not easy to drink while working out. 

There aren't that many breakfast options, which I found frustrating. The main breakfast restaurant had a long wait each morning and the grab and go food only consisted of pastries and coffees. Nothing healthy or fresh. 

The restaurant options in the hotel are quite vast for lunch and dinner. Milos is by far my favorite for lunch and dinner. We also had a nice lunch at China Poblano. 

*Tip: Milos offers food to go, so if you want to eat dinner in your car on your way back to LA get Milos to go rather than having to stop for fast food!

Alot of things go into a fabulous experience at a club.

You need a fabulous space.

Fabulous people.

Fabulous prices.

And lots of fabulous space to bust out your fabulous moves.

Tao - was an impressive fabulous space, but the people and number of them crammed into one dance space (the downstairs area was much less crowded, but not much was happening) were short of fabulous, we couldn't score a seat unless we had ordered bottle service, and the price of entry for the guys in our group as well as the drinks once inside were far from fabulous.

So overall Tao was not the fabulous experience we had hoped over.

There were two creepy baths, boasting two naked women sitting in rose-petal water as we entered. Both women looked bored and unimpressed, and at the moment I knew our night at Tao was not looking up. The music was erratic Top 40 stuff, like most of the clubs in Las Vegas, and once we made our way to the second floor dance area, we were bombarded with throes of pushy girls. 

With no room to dance or move, we managed to squeeze our way into the VIP section and ended up partying the night away with some friendly Welsh guys, which helped the night pass a little smoother, but after about an hour and half we couldn't get out of Tao soon enough.

If you're OK not being able to bust out your fabulous booty shake move, cause you'll probably boot out five girls from the dance floor in one shake - you have so little room to move - then come here - you'll probably have a good time. 

But if crowds aren't your thing - ask the locals for a good club recommendation that night - and go there instead.

Trust..

Lo-Lo's is a nice experience in southern cooking without leaving Phoenix. You can see why everyone raves about the place.

Three of us came here for breakfast last week and really enjoyed ourselves.  The only drawback was that we arrived at 8:15am. Yelp had the opening listed incorrectly as 7 am.  Lo-Lo's  OPENS AT 9 AM! I have posted a updated photo, with the correct times from the front door.

We ordered two coffees and a iced "fruit punch" Kool-Aid for $3.00 each to start. I had the #8 Betty Boop for $8.00. It comes with one piece of southern fried chicken breast, along with a plate covering waffle. It wasn't bad, but mine was a little mushy and didn't stand up well to the syrup. 

As for the chicken, I regret that it was somewhat dry and not juicy. The smashed sides of two sausage paddies for $2.00 was great and it had a nice flavor.  I would come back just for the smashed sausages and Kool-Aid anytime!

My two friends ordered the #14 CJ's, which is one waffle, one egg, and a small bowl of grits for only $6.00 (a steal); and the #11 Kimbo for $7.00, which is two giant waffles. My friend reported that his waffles were cooked longer and they looked golden brown. 

Spending some time in the south, I really miss having Grits. Oatmeal is not the same thing. The Grits at Lo-Lo's are very good. If you have never tried them before, Lo-Lo's would be a good introduction. But skip the cheese on top. The best I've ever enjoyed came with small pieces of bacon in it. Yum! Now, which way is the Mayo Clinic? LOL

Our bill for three including taxes, but before gratuities ran us $34.86. Overall the food and service was very good. I would say Three and Half Stars good, rounding up to Four.

Recommendation:  Take it all off!  Get in the bed nude!  (Stop it.  I'll get back to this).

Note:  This review is for Aria Sky Suites, the hotel within the hotel.

One of only 83 Forbes Five Star and a AAA Five Diamond award winner, Aria Sky Suites is the pinnacle of "rentable"  Vegas experience (once again, stop it).  This is the home of the much talked about Sky Villas.

The experience begins with complimentary airport limo service.  Arrival through a gated, private entrance.  Extends to a private checkin where your daily news paper choices are noted, your personal itinerary discussed (if you used the concierge book shows and make dining reservations - best seats and impossible to get tables included) then  you are swept to your suite.

Suites and villas are contemporary with excellent finishes.   Yes, you will probably play with the kitchen faucet for five minutes before finally figuring out how to turn it on, another five staring at a 5'x5'x2' "cube" and wondering who would want to sit on that until you try it and yet another thirty trying to program your room kicking yourself for telling the bell man you could figure it out on your own.  In the end, high tech and comfortable.

Master bathrooms are massive.  Each bedroom has its own.  Marble and glass throughout, his and her vanities, separate area for the ladies to pretty themselves up, separate tub, steam shower, separate water closet with heated seat and washlet, and full walk in closet with a safe large enough for most full size notebooks..  That little zip-lock bag slowing you down at TSA?  Forget it.  All toiletries are provided.  Teeth too good for Colgate?  Contact the concierge and have whatever you want ordered to your suite.

No worrying about throwing used towels on the floor to be replaced.  If it's used it's changed (including your sheets), not once but twice daily with turndown service.   The bedtime chocolates are wonderful.

Friendly and professional service throughout with no air of snootiness. 

Suites start around $600 per night for high level mLife members.  Book through the mlife.com for the best rates.  You do need to pay the dreaded "resort fee" but for the budget conscious, there is a 24/7 private lounge that provide all the bottled water, juices, soda, coffee, tea, and fruits you want.

Oh yeah, the sleeping naked tip.  Just do it.  Sheets are softer and more inviting than any clothes you probably own.  Turn down the AC and enjoy the cocoon of comfort.

***Aria is very generic, but the rooms (especially the bigger ones) are comfortable and very nice; it also has a good location, but you really have to walk to get to The Strip***

Aria is one of the new very tall hotels at City Center in Las Vegas.  Here is a rundown on the pros and cons (a pleasant experience overall).

Pros:

--Nice rooms.  Contemporary, clean and comfortable.

--Location.  City Center is near a lot of the action (with casinos like Caesars and Bellagio closeby).

--Lots of places to eat in the hotel.

--Because of its newness, the smoke smell is less strong.  Still, I feel Bellagio and Wynn are better at clearing out the smoke.

--A different option.  Not as "theme-like" as other casinos.  This could be a pro or con depending on how you feel about those "theme-like" casinos, but at least it provides an option for those who are looking for something else.

--The interior/decor of the hotel/casino (like the rooms) are modern and sleek.

--The exterior is pleasant to look at and all glass (very similar to the Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott at LA Live).

Cons:

--While Aria is located on the Strip, it is a little bit of a walk to get down to the sidewalk to visit other casinos.  I like walking in Vegas, but this may be a con if you are not wearing comfortable shoes (or need to get somewhere quick by foot).

--The rooms are small.

--I think their rates are a little higher than other serviceable hotels nearby.

--I only tried one food place (Cafe Vettro) and it was not good.

--While this place is a different option, the lack of a theme or style gives the hotel kind of a too simple feel.  Once again, good or bad depending on your perspective.

I haven't stayed at many hotels in Vegas so it is hard for me to rank Aria, but my experience at Aria was pleasant overall.  Since Aria is near a lot of casinos I like, I would come back, but I would do so only if I got a good deal.

Note: They have little packaged accessories (such as an iPod auxiliary cable and charger) next to nuts and candies on the counter.  These are obviously things (expensive things) you can buy (like the minibar).  The items are weight sensored so if you pick one of them up, the hotel automatically charges your room.  So you lift it, you bought it.

They will take it off your credit card if you picked it up to just get a better look.

Trivia: Aria was featured on a recent episode of ABC's The Bachelorette.

Friday night and it's 4am.  You've been drinking with your friends since at least 9pm.  It's Scottsdale, so nothing is open and you've exhausted all the fun you can possibly have laughing at drunk idiots gobble down subs at The Philadelphia Sandwich Company (one of my favorite pastimes).  As you drive down Scottsdale Road you see Zorba's and flash back to your senior year of high school, when you and your friends would go into these places and giggle like the innocent little girls you used to be.  I decided it was high time I revisited this Old Town institution. 

Maybe it was the vodka, but I have never felt more comfortable and welcome in a sex shop before.  Usually I get that paranoid feeling that everyone is watching me and keeping tabs on the things that peek my interest.  

I asked the nice young gentleman behind the counter to give my friends and me a tour.  He let me ask stupid questions like:
-"What's your best seller?"  While holding the largest double dildo I have ever seen in my life.  Apparently Zorba's sells a lot of those, just is case you wanted to know.
-"How often do you clean these things and are you the one who has to do it?" In reference to the obvious jack-off rooms.  He kept saying something about no touching being allowed.  He showed me how the little window separating two private rooms will unfog when both rooms are occupied.  So, let that be a warning to you... unless you're into voyeurism I guess.  

He continued to indulge my inane questions so that I could get a good laugh.  Maybe he was bored and got some entertainment out of it too.  Thanks Zorba's for being such a good sport.  I hope you will be entertaining Scottsdale's youth for generations to come.

In the ever evolving world of sandwiches, many claim to produce the best sandwich in the world.  Among the contenders are the likes of Capriotti's, Mendocino Farms, Which Wich? and many more. Among this iconic list of sandwich makers, there are droves of fans and haters alike.
But make no mistake, The Earl of Sandwich makes some of the most addictively good sandwiches i've enjoyed in a very long time! Tack on the competitive prices and it makes it even better! So it's safe to say i'm a fan when it comes to the Earl's cheap & tasty eats!


The Original with Roast Beef - 
The bread was excellent! As soon as I grabbed the warm bag in my hand, I knew I was in for a toasty treat!
The bread was perfectly crisp on the outside yet warm and fluffy on the inside. Not thick, bread-y, dry & spongy like most other places. The roast beef was piled high and it was juicy and full of mouthwatering flavor!

Jerk Chicken Sandwich
Filled with generous portions of chunk grilled chicken breast (not sandwich meat), red peppers and of course a good helping of zippy banana peppers, this zesty lil number was quite flavorful and surprisingly juicy (considering it was chicken breast!) but my favorite has to be the original for overall mmmmmm mmmm mm factor!

Dessert
Brownie Cream Sandwich
Imagine two chocalatey rich brownies sandwiching a decadent layer of sweet vanilla frosting...yup it's insanely rich and sweet! I advise you to purchase a glass of milk with this decadent number cuz you'll definitely need it!

Service was nifty & quick and they got us in and out in no time flat! Don't forget that all toppings are free with the exclusion of avocado, so pile it high if you so desire! And did I mention the prices? Only 6$ for a delicious hot sammie! That's a steal for a great sandwich on the strip I might add!

With that said, it's a no brainer...if you're out after the club looking for some awesome late nite eats or just strolling the strip, give EoS a try, you won't be disappointed!

Happy Eats!

This place seems somewhat hidden behind McChevron. Walking in we were greeted and given a chance to glance over the menu. The food is made fresh to order and they have a free salsa and veggie bar. Priced just under $3, I ordered a "Cheese Quesdalilla" and a "Fried Beef Taco" for around $2. Can't say I was a fan of the quesadilla. The tortilla tasted store bought and the cheese was lacking and had a somewhat pasty texture. The fried beef taco wasn't bad actually, but the chicken taco at Roberto's, grease and all, is by far better and larger in size. They have plenty of tables inside and you can call your order ahead of time too. The employees were very nice and inside was clean, but with other nearby options for lunch that I have enjoyed more and this place tasting average or just under, I can't see coming back.

I love Mom and Pop run businesses. 

I was driving along Chandler Boulevard, saw the sign "Family Run Business" and decided to stop.  

There is so much homogeneity in our dinning experience today. Everything is so cookie cutter. 

Yet with that uniformity comes time tested (and test lab) food tastes, that makes us come back for more -- no matter which city or town we find ourselves in. 

But if you are tired of the "same old, same old" as I am, you keep your eye open for these places. Don't get me wrong Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ isn't perfect, but it's a nice change. 

Last night I ordered their Combo Dinner.  That's two specialty smoked meats, two sides, a soft drink and your choice of breads. I went with the Brisket, smoke polish sausage, garlic mash, apple cobbler and jalapeo corn bread for $10.99. They do the same thing for lunch at $7.99. 

I found Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ "A-Okay" and Three Stars good. The meat had a nice smokey taste that lasted after my meal, while the sides were little bland and the corn bread had no kick. BTW, what's with all this 4 Sq signage? I didn't even know they were still in business. LOL

5 STARS because I was really impressed with with the manager.. I guess an employee failed to come in during the busy "Grand Opening". She came to every single table to notify them and also checked up on how everyone and their meals were doing, without being overly bothersome, lol.
Of course our server was attentive and friendly as well!

5 STARS to the food! 
Items ordered :
- White Sangria : if you like strong sangria this is the drink for you. They got me at "papaya" but wasn't a fan, imagined it to be more on the sweet side.
- Mandarin Orange Tangerine Mimosa : Absolute FAVE! Glad my friend got it! Sounded too orangey but it's the perfect blend! High class orange juice, with alcohol, with a little bit of pulp! 
- Almond Brioche French Toast with Almond Butter & Coconut Syrup (made in house) : DELICIOUS! Three thick pieces, moist and very flavorful! Dusted with powdered sugar, topped with coconut almond custard, and comes with raspberry & mixed tropical fruits.. The Almond Butter and Coconut Syrup were just extra icing on the French toast! 
- Belgian Waffles : nothing to special with these waffles, topped with fruit and chose almond butter with maple syrup with it, nonetheless still a good waffle!
- 36hr Braised Short Rib Loco Moco topped with Lentil Gravy, comes with Eggs to your liking, Fried Rice, & Crispy Onion Rings : NO KNIFE NEEDED! Extremely tender, seasoned well, great textures with the crispy fried onion, fried egg and fried rice (I think I said "fried" too much lol), and overall a great loco moco! 

4 STARS to the long drive out there and the water cup with no ice \_()_/..

Still a great experience! Must try other great menu items!

I hate buffets, but I had heard so many good things about Bacchanal I said I'll give it a whirl for breakfast ($28/each).  We had:

Freshly squeezed juices like carrot and cucumber
Smoked salmon & cold shrimp
Steak & egg
Biscuits and gravy, sausage and cheesy tots
Fried chicken and waffles
Sorbets:  Thai tea; fig & balsamic; mango chile lime; and blood orange

There were also your basic fare of eggs, bacon, hash browns, waffles, and an extensive array of desserts.

The juices were excellent and full of flavor.  I had four:  5 Stars.  In addition, the salmon and shrimp were fresher compared most buffets:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the hot dishes disappointed.  They were not warm.  In addition, the biscuits were not that moist, the sausage in the gravy was not crumbled well, and there wasn't enough pepper:  2 Stars.

On the other hand, the sorbets were really good and flavorful, with the mango chile lime being my favorite.  You could really taste the chile:  5+++'Stars for the latter flavor.  The woman who served me was from Puerto Rico, and we struck up a conversation in Spanish which was cool.

The remainder of the service was spotty.  Although there were many open tables, it took a while to be seated.  The group in front of me thought the same.  Additionally, we had to ask for water, and our glasses were not refilled.  Lastly, we told one server that we were going to the restroom.  However, when we returned, someone had cleared our table:  2 Stars.

I would come back here for breakfast.  However, I would not come back for dinner ($55), and wait an hour or more.  There are far better things to do in Vegas, than wait in a buffet line.

I usually only eat Papa Murphy's once or twice a year, but when I do, I enjoy it. I already knew what I wanted when I walked in. In the past, when they have a special promotion going on they have some already made in their cooler to keep the long lines down. This time though my pizza was made fresh right in front of me. I asked for a "Heart Shaped Pizza" priced at $7 and included 1 topping (additional toppings extra). For an additional $6, I added "Cheesy Bread" and "Cookie Dough" to complete the meal. 

Different types of pizza here take different times to cook. I had the original crust so it needed to be baked at 425 for about 12 minutes. The pizza came out nice and tasted good. I baked the cheesy bread at 400 for about 10 minutes and it was pretty good for what it was. If you are going to buy frozen pizza at the store, you might as well come here and get something you can customize for about the same price and it tastes better. The pizza and cheesy bread are baked on the trays they come on, but they do offer instructions if you would prefer the pizza to be baked on your pizza stone or grill. The cookie dough comes in a tub and you bake in on your own sheet. I baked the cookies at 375 for about 10 minutes.

They also offer stuffed pizzas and at home pizza kits for kids.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 42/100

I am HUGE lover of the city of Paris and anything related to it. My apartment is Paris-themed with Eiffel Towers, macarons, bonjour signs, etc. everywhere. I was disappointed that my boyfriend couldn't get us hotel reservations at the Paris Hotel, but after visiting it this past weekend, I was actually kinda glad that we didn't end up staying there.

This hotel looks beautiful on the outside. The huge Eiffel Tower, of course, is a smaller, fit-to-scale version of the real thing in Paris. The building with all of the rooms in it actually looks like many of the buildings in Paris. They also have the Arc de Triomphe which is quite a spectacle as well.

My bf and I came here to dine at Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant. Because of where we parked in the garage, we had to walk through a bit of the shops and restaurants to get to where Steak was located on the main casino floor. It feels as if you are roaming the streets of Europe, but nothing inside the whole shopping/restaurant area really screamed PARIS to me. It was just like European-esque, but not really Paris. Also, I felt kind of claustrophobic in there because although the Venetian and Caesars Palace have the same thing where you feel like you're walking in Europe and there's a fake sky ceiling above, I feel like the ones in Paris are much lower and it just felt...busy and stuffy. 

The smell from the restaurants was slightly nauseating. It gave me gross flashbacks of bad quality, overpriced Italian from Disneyland near Pirates of the Caribbean. That is super specific but it was not bringing back good memories for me. Kinda like the smell when you first start riding on Pirates and you pass by the Blue Bayou restaurant...hahaha.

Overall, this hotel just seems dated to me...and not really that big to accommodate large amounts of people. There was some sort of marketing convention going on while we were there, which made it even more busy and claustrophobic than usual. 

3 stars for a nice outer appearance, Gordon Ramsay's Steak restaurant, and having a good location on the strip!

I know, I know, this is a brand new steakhouse in Vegas and I probably committed every faux pas in the book by ordering the fish. But I did it. And I don't regret it for a minute.

FOOD:
---------
As our group asked for my opinion on appetizers, I knew I had to select the **Smoked Pork Terrine** because it offered the sublime foie gras, of which I have been deprived for ages, being a Californian and all. Combined with delicious pickled figs and pepper jelly atop a piece of bread, this appetizer was everything I wanted and more.

I was a little worried that choosing the **Roasted Market Fish** would be a total mistake, but it was delicious! It turned out to be Sea Bass with a tomato paste and zucchini relish. The bass was prepared perfectly, being sufficiently firm while also smoothly melting in the mouth. This would rival any bass from an acclaimed seafood restaurant. I sampled a piece of Anna's **Porterhouse** and it was divine. I would definitely order it on my next visit.

For side dishes we got the roasted mushrooms, asparagus, creamless sweet creamed corn. We all thought the asparagus could have used some more flavoring or some sort of creative twist, but the corn was a huge hit with its buttery smoothness.

SERVICE / AMBIANCE:
-------------------------------
Absolutely outstanding. Every member of the staff we encountered was on point, very warm and helpful, and extremely professional. Our server had an entertaining sense of humor. Even the busser impressed us with his refined gestures.

The decor is mod and clean with beautiful wood accents everywhere. The open kitchen in the back is a nice touch.

Of course you get what you pay for, so be ready to lay down some cash. For four people (3 steaks, 1 fish, 3 sides, 4 drinks), we each fronted about $100.

DATE TIP: With swankified dining at its best,
How could your date not be impressed?

Where to begin?

I came here yesterday to purchase a cup of tea, but what I encountered was a high pressured sales experience!

Recently I noticed that Starbucks bought Teavana and I decide to give it a try.  Teavana is located across the street from my office in Kierland. I went inside and asked about their Rooibos or other white teas.  It was too late in the day for a Oolong and I wanted something light.  

When we lived in Seattle, I use to enjoy stopping at Peet's Coffee & Teas in Fremont. http://www.yelp.com/biz/peets-coffee-and-tea-seattle-2 Their selection was outstanding and I had high hopes for Teavana.

I vaguely remember hearing stories of the hard sell employed here.  Sadly, they were all true.

I came in and asked if they sold hot tea, or were they strictly a bulk outlet. No, I was told they did both.  Great!  I asked if they carried any Rooibos, or other white teas and I was shown some strong black teas and Oolongs.  "Danger Will Robinson", I thought.  I corrected the salesperson and said I wanted something lighter, that didn't have as much caffeine. 

Well, this went on for a while, but I finally purchased a Grande size cup of one of their teas for $5.45. It took ten minutes, after several false started.  As I was leaving, I tasted a samplers outside and decided to get some tea for home.  The tea I like, Samurai Chai Mat wasn't sold in a bag and  I was informed that I needed to purchase one of their tins for $7.00!  Hmm, okay I thought.

I asked for a small amount to take home.  They filled the tin and I was told that would be $56.00. I said empty half the can and then it was $34.00. So I asked how much was it an ounce and was told $6.30.  In the end, I paid $19.53 for 3.1 oz and along with my $7.00 tin including taxes it came to $27.57.

I've skipped the blow by blow dialogue. In sales, these tactics are called the "Assumptive Close". It's where the salesperson, assumes you want the largest amount, or a fully loaded car, er tea -- until they are corrected. It can be exasperating and somewhat annoying.

In the future, I'll pass and stick to Starbucks. I never thought I would ever say that!

Better than a food court but not by much.

Part of a growing chain (18 restaurants in 11 states).  It's not fancy.  No build your own anything.  Make a "concept" selection, choose either burger, chicken, or turkey.  For beef burgers, choose a doneness level.  Opt for plain or "crunchified" (silly addition of chips in the sandwich).  Done.

The dcor looks like a burger exploded.  Ketchup red, mustard yellow, golden bun, grilled beef brown.

Burgers are cooked to order, relatively juicy, decent beef flavor but grossly under seasoned.  Not good for mild burgers but welcome for spicy creations which are SPICY.  Toppings are fresh.  The Philadelphia Burger (provolone, griddled onions and hot peppers) packs a spicy punch but is good eats.  The LA burger (avocado, watercress, tomato and cheddar cheese) is so mild the burger is lost.

Definitely NOT a fan of the "crunchified" burgers.  The addition of chips adds a distracting textural contrast and nothing to the taste.  

Simple sides.  The beer battered onion rings best of the bunch.  Fries just OK.  Soggy at times.  The mayo, roasted red pepper, chipotle sauce it's served with is spicy and flavorful.  The sweet potato fries with honey mustard horseradish sauce is a better choice.

Very good, rich milk shake with pronounced flavors (the pistachio is worthy!)

Excellent service.

Overall, inexpensive for the Strip but not worth the pilgrimage or the wait.  This is Vegas.  X times the money does equal X times the pleasure.

It has been a really LONG time since i've been really wowed by sushi. I came to a point in my life where I really questioned whether or not sushi, in general, has become perpetually trite. After visiting Daisho, my opinion of sushi has changed. This is now my favorite AYCE sushi spot in Vegas, and what they are doing here is surprisingly wonderful. Here's why:

First, after walking in the door and being seated by the server at the bar, we were given our menu's. They had the expected items you would see on any sushi menu, but after looking at the appetizer menu, you can tell that these guys are trying to do things distinctive. We had the AYCE menu for 25 bucks, and Tony T. and I started our voyage through this unique menu.

Note: We tried a great volume of items, so I would probably max out the 5000 character limit on Yelp reviews by describing only 1/4 of what we had. There was zilch that I didn't like on menu, but there some dishes that are especially noteworthy.

: Salmon Collar/Yellowtail Collar - This was unbelievable. I was totally blown away, especially by the salmon. The first time I had collar of a fish was at Yonaka, and it was wonderful. On the other hand, the collar at Daisho completely blows Yonaka's out of the water!!! Wonderfully tender, with the natural fat sustaining the moistness of the fish, personally (especially with the salmon), I thought I was eating foie gras. It was prepared with an expert hand, and cooked with precision.  It absolutely melted in the mouth. I'm still thinking about it.

: Uni and Ikura (salmon roe) nigiri - Freshest and highest quality uni and salmon roe i've ever had, EVER. The uni had a delicate, but firm texture, and had a clean taste. The same goes for Ikura as well. 

I FINALLY found a place that makes sushi rice correctly!!!! A great deal of people think that it's effortless to create great sushi rice. What folks don't realize is, that in world-class sushi restaurants, sushi apprentices and beginner trainees spend 3-4  (or more) YEARS learning just how to make rice, before they are given the permission to touch a piece of fish. Making sushi rice in itself, is an art form. And these guys nailed it.

A small footnote: This locale is great for low-carbers. There are more than 5 rice less rolls and plenty of apps that do not contain starch or rice, including collar, poke, oysters, yaki-tori and more!!

Vegas local, here. I live at MGM/Signature.

SLS is at the very last Monorail stop at the far north end of the strip where the old Sahara hotel used to be. SLS definitely isn't 'ghetto'. I try to reserve that word for hotels like The Stratosphere and Circus Circus that truly are low-class, both inside and out. But let's just say the SLS is underwhelming. You can probably skip this place on your next Vegas trip.

The whole establishment gave me a really negative feeling inside. I'm not a New Ager so I don't really buy into the idea of positive and negative "vibes" or "energies"... but I've gotta say, something felt off about the place. Other things just left me scratching my head.

One of the head scratchers is the hotel's theme. What's their target demographic? Who are they trying to appeal to? They had a Pancake Griddle in there with a line of senior citizens out the door. The wait time must've been two hours or more. But then adjacent to that, they're trying to promote a nightclub. I can easily envision a late evening scenario where the long lines of seniors (some with walkers, wheelchairs, etc.) who are waiting to eat at one of the restaurants gradually gets intertwined with the twenty-somethings waiting for the nightclub. Seems like that could be awkward.

The floor in one area of the hotel was covered with what appeared to be fur or hair. I suspect there were farm animals in the hotel at one point. But why?

The part that bothered me the most though was the massive, rather intimidating security presence on the casino floor. Felt like I was in Ferguson, MO. or something. I took out my iPhone to video one of the restaurants that I thought had a really interesting decor, thinking I'd post it on my Facebook -- but within seconds, one of the guards approached me and said that no photographs or videos were permitted in the hotel. The dude wasn't messing around and I'm not exactly an alpha male who's prone to challenging people, so I quietly complied and then subsequently deleted the video.

He was professional and respectful to me and went out of his way to let me know why no photos are allowed: "because of 9/11". Really? Because of 9/11? I was tempted to give him a "What'choo' talking' 'bout, Willis?" because every other strip location I've visited seems to have no prohibitions on videos/photos (unless you're trying to video a card game, etc.) -- but whatever.

Anyway, I kind of feel like the SLS views all of their patrons as suspects or potential threats. I hightailed it out of there and likely won't return. The whole thing makes me realize how important it is for me to stay in my "safe zone": Caesars, Mirage, Aria, Cosmo, Mandalay, Fashion Show Mall, and of course my home base at MGM. People seem to like me at those places and value my business (or at least they do a good job of faking it) but man, if I stray a bit too far north, it's downright hostile! 

My recommendation is to skip SLS. So many great hotels in this town. No need to waste your time here.

"GO WEST, YOUNG MAN" 

That was one of the first things to pop into my mind when I first heard about our much loved Frost Bites Shavery opening a possible new second location somewhere near Chinatown.  Now that FBS has opened at Seoul Plaza (where you can find: Raku, Monta Ramen, Big Wong, Japanese Curry Zen, Trattoria Nakamura-Ya, Kabuto and that awkward "massage" place where tourists leaves via taxi with a big grin on them faces) rebranded itself as SnowFlake Shavery, the famous partial quote by the American author Horace Greeley  about westward expansion and Manifest Destiny could be applied to our favorite shaved snow biz from Hendertucky.  +2 for just being soooo mucho more closer to the Westsiders. 

For those that have not tried shaved snow from SFS before, it is not the shaved ice you might have tried before with colorful syrups poured over the coarse shaved ice.  It is a more refined icy treat with powder snow or frozen cotton candy-like melt-in-your-mouth experience.  Think shaved ice version 2.3, so to speak.  All made with 100% NATURAL INGREDIENTS, no artificial flavorings or syrups used (which is the reason why taro is not one of the available flavors - sadly artificial taro flavorings trumps all natural taro shaved ice made from real taro only).

Ordering 101:

Step 1:  Choose a size: Small, Large, Monster
Step 2:  Choose a flavor:  From Vanilla, Cantaloupe to Green Tea and Black Sesame.
Step 3:  Add a topping ($0.50 per selection):  Fresh fruits to candy and cereal.
Step 4:  Top it off with a sauce (first one free, +$0.25 after that one):  Condensed Milk, Strawberry Condensed Milk, Chocolate and Caramel.

If you are not sure, they also have helpful combos for you to pick from or help jump start your shaved snow creativity.  Although I have had Green Tea and Black Sesame Shaved Snow all by itself, and didn't think it needed any toppings or sauce. It is that good!

Come and try it now that it is closer for everyone that does not live in Henderson.

I think it is better than the ones I tried in SoCal and Taiwan (except the fresh mango from Taiwan is way better).

Here are just a sampling of other real customer testimonials:

Cathy C loves this place, because it is dessert sans guilt.
Sandy K said it is so good it is like [frozen] crack.
Norm K said Mango with coconut sounds good to me!
Philip T thinks he like this more than frozen yogurt now.
Roger T thinks Green Tea + Mochi + just a drizzle of Condensed Milk is dessert heaven.

So what you be waitin' for? Come get some SnowFlake!

Are you a wanna be competitive eater?  Member of a Greek fraternal organization looking for out of the box activities?  Do the Shaved Block Ice challenge!  Successful competitors earn the coolest bragging rights in town + extra(?)


DISCLAIMER:  To harry I:  I am not a shill (I am deeply offended by being called that even if I had to first look it up in a dictionary).  And I am not a professional reviewer, but I will take that as a compliment.  And I believe in paying for the products and services from businesses (I want to review the customer service and experience that everyone gets), and writing a honest review of my personal experience.  If I happened to be passionate about it and write the review with flair, all the better.  Being new to Yelp you should read Yelp's Terms of Service, plus the site's Content Guidelines and Review Guidelines.  You can go back to tell your celebrity chef friend that if he is really passionate about the food he serves, he will not be using artificial powders. Is his product bad? NO.  But it is like comparing real orange juice (SnowFlake Shavery) to SunnyD (KSC).

Wynn wins in my book, as far as buffets go.

I am not much of a gambler or a buffet person, but I come here to increase my odds of being a winner.

Since buffets are almost always a quantity over quality compromise, this place is not for everyone.  I'd rather dine at Michael Mina's, where I can get a lobster pot pie and their Kobe beef with seared foie gras.

My attitude is that I am not going to eat like a pig so that I can get my money's worth.  I simply enjoy their wide selection of food presented in a classy way and savor the beautiful experience.

Certainly, you will see some diners, like Yelpers Cat C, Janice C, Flora C and Angelique Q, pigging out on the crab legs and prime ribs for a few hours.  

I, on the other hand, love to sample a little of everything.  Think of the buffet as one HUGE INTERNATIONAL SAMPLER PLATTER, which includes salad, fried rice, shrimp cocktails, bacon, soup, Mexican food, crme brulee, crepe, fruits, dim sum, sushi, prime rib, king crab legs, fish, grilled meat, and gelato/ice cream.  Plus bottomless champagne!

The fiddy-dollar meal is not going to break anyone's piggy bank, so don't overstuff yourself.  Save $12 for their brunch.

If you are a buffet fanatic, this is your first choice destination.  Bellagio takes second place.  Third comes Rio.  

The staff is very attentive and friendly.  Seating is comfortable, but there is a long line to get in during peak hours.

Most importantly, the bathroom is close by.
It is true that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.
So did my #2.  Wooooosssshhhh!

I dedicate this review to Janice C.  She's half-Chinese.

After reading MaryLou D's review on Yelp, a group of us from my office decided to come here for a late afternoon lunch.

We were blown away by this Mom (sorry, no Pop) place. Nana is cooking up some really tasty food. I had the Carne Asada burrito, which was huge.  Take a look at my knife and fork (photo) next to this bad boy. 

Second, the flavors were outstanding and we couldn't get over the amount of meat that she gave us.  Even at $6.50, there must have been well over a cup and a half of diced Carne Asada. Wow. 

While she was making our food, we got a chance to catch up on our favorite Mexican Soaps on the flat screen TV, munching on some chips with some really good and flavorful homemade salsa (with four alarm heat), and all the while enjoying a 16 oz bottled long neck Coke. Atmosphere. Atmosphere. Atmosphere! We didn't want to go back to work. Time moves slowly here, but not Nana. She's always hustling!

Expect to pay around $11, including a very generous Tip to Nana for this incredible meal. Four Stars and yes, we are Fans. Thank you MaryLou!

The Cosmopolitan's  "grand social experiment".  It delivers!

Walk in to be greeted by five doors.  Some leading into turn of the century meets Star Trek rooms, others, well...  Spaces morph, the experience evolves, life happens all around you.  Live bands, eclectic music, spontaneous vaudeville acts and a stage production, good food, great craft cocktails.  You need to experience it to understand.

Essentially it's a craft cocktail ultra lounge, stage production, and mega club and restaurant all in one.

Breaking it down:

Craft Cocktails - Excellent, many reinvented, from classics.  Very consistent (a rarity when some cocktails contain 10+ ingredients).

Stage Production (Vegas Nocturne) -  Similar to Absinthe.  Acrobatics, comedy, tap dancing, strip teases. No more details as you are sworn to secrecy.  

Club - Still need to experience this.

Restaurant - Inventive and indulgent.  Many items to be shared like the outstanding caviar mini tacos (Yukon gold shells filled with hamachi and drowned in caviar), deconstructed oysters Rockefeller (fried oysters on a bacon butter sauted spinach and bacon dust in an oyster shell) or the tete de cochon (deep fried panko crusted head cheese topped with a poached egg).

For larger dishes, the reinvented beef Wellington (beef tenderloin with a generous portion of seared foie, trumpet mushrooms, studded with cream spinach, topped with shaved black truffle and crowned by a flaky, latticed puff pastry is very good albeit rich.

Incredible caviar service (five types sold by the ounce, half kilo, kilo).

Outstanding wine and champagne list.  Ultra lounge prices.

Tip;  To make the most of your experience:
1.  Make a night of it.  Drinks, dinner, and the show.
2.  Move through the rooms.  There is something different in each.
3.  Make reservations if you want to eat a full meal.
4.  Purchase your tickets in advance for the show.  Don't skimp.  Pay the $135 for the best seats.
5.  Shows are not the same.  The later you go, the edgier.
6.  Be prepared to spend $$$$.  The show, dinner, and some cocktails averages $300 per person.  Add some caviar and bottles of wine and it's easy to drop several dimes.

Now if only I can remember how Alice got home after falling down the rabbit hole.

I came here because a group of us were downtown.  When I entered I thought that it was a stupid gimik but I went a long with it because I was hungry and in a hurry. 

We ordered our food and when it arrived it wasn't the greatest.  It didn't taste that great and the atmosphere was cheesy.  

While we were eating we heard a couple come in and ask to be seated.  The nurse at the front told them that they would have to put on a hospital gown.  The girl in the couple looked at the gowns and noticed that they weren't clean.  Thats when I looked mine over and noticed that she was right.  She immediately said that because she has been diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; she shouldn't be forced to wear that.  I know someone who lives with that disorder so I know that they have high anxiety when it comes to cleanliness.  The nurse argued with her until the girl asked to talk to a manager.  The nurse yelled across the restaurant to an old guy in a Dr outfit who claimed he owned the place.  

He arrogantly asked "what's the problem," in the same tone the nurse was having with the two patrons.  The girl stated that she didn't want to wear the medical gown because she didn't trust how clean it was and the manager said, "leave then!"  

The girl responded, "you would rather us eat somewhere else instead of voting with our dollars here?"

The so called manager started to get in both of the couples faces in an aggressive manner.  The male part of the couple was just standing there and didn't say a word until the manager started to make the couple feel apprehensive. The old manager then threatened the guy after the couple had exited the front door.  Thats when the guy started to stand his ground and call the manager out as a coward.  The guy told the manager to come at him if he wanted to threaten him otherwise he should go back inside and eat a %@)#.  "You obviously like a lot of meat in your mouth."  I started rolling after that and expected the manager to do something.  

I thought the situation absurd because the so called 'owner' threatened a couple who wanted to pay to eat at his horrible restaurant.  Then when the manager was bowed up to, he had to cowar back and close the door.  

I wont be coming back to this place after the way I saw patrons were treated and after I saw that the restaurant won't make exceptions for someone who has been diagnosed with a disability.   The "owner" made the situation worse and made himself look like a coward.

"That smoothie was so good I almost stole it from Cathy" - a very daring statement from my sister. Take my money, take my boyfriend...I'll get over it. Take my food? You want war!

After a nice morning at the gym, my sister and I finally went here after months of talking about it. I keep hearing positive comments about this place. They have vegan, gluten-free and regular options. But fear not, they have bacon if that's your thing.

Coconut Almond Blended:
I absolutely have a strong dislike of anything coconut. But with my lucky experiences of getting something I hate and ending up liking it (for the past few months) inspired me to get this. Well, I can add this to the list. It tasted like a very mild horchata. Pleasantly and surprisingly delicious! 5/5

Kale Apple Banana Smoothie:
The taste of kale reminds me of a fruit I ate when I was little, Spanish plum. So drinking kale + other fruits isn't foreign to me. This was a little sweetness to it and a nice tart flavor. 5/5

Iced Coffee:
I'm not a big coffee drinker but THIS was good. It takes them 8 hours to make. It wasn't bitter and I didn't feel the need to add anything to it. 5/5

The Hummus:
Comes with warm pita and olives on top. I ate around the olives since I'm allergic to them. Freshly made and delightful. 4/5

The Agrodolce Brussels Sprouts:
Roasted Brussels sprouts with Italian sweet and sour vinaigrette. The sprouts looked a bit overcooked but when you eat them, they still have that crunch. The vinaigrette was a bit tangy and refreshing. 5/5

The Curried Quinoa:
Quinoa, dried cranberries, almonds, parsley with sweet curry. Lots of textures and flavors. Quinoa and almonds are good non-meat protein sources minus LDL's. Cranberries are good for the ladies. 5/5

The Bizness:
Chopped kale with lemon vinaigrette. You can pick and choose 3 side items or roasted chicken / bacon / avocado to put in this salad. So, if you get a combo that sucks then, it's your fault! Accountability 101. But no worries, all the sides they have are good. 5/5

The Banana Boy Bait:
This got me singing "hey you're such a pretty boy. Hey you're such a pretty boy. You're so pretty". Banana bread with natural sweeteners. The top has a little crunch to it. They bring it to you hot. Yuuuuuummm!!! I was supposed to split this 50/50 with my sister but quickly ended up at  60/40 - she caught me before it went to 80/20. "I'm saving you from calories." 5/5

This is located inside The Center which is a LGBTQ facility. They have books and computers with internet. They have their own parking lot which is a big deal because I'm not a fan of paying for parking! I love this place!!!

Me: Is that half a dead rat sewn to half a dead pigeon?
Mr Arm: Yes.

Me: Oh. Then what's in the jar next to rat-bird?
Mr Arm: That's 3/4 of a dead dove sewn to 1/4 of a deceased shark and that over there is a German Shepard penis.
Me: Neat-O. 

Mr Arm: Can you guess what's in that jar?
Me: A cat sewn to a bat? 
Mr Arm: You're half right.
Me: A bat-bird? 
Mr Arm: Getting colder...
Me: bat-bunny?
Mr Arm: Colder
Me: **squinting eyes to decipher the remains floating in the jar of embalming booze**
Mr Arm: It's a cat. Just a cat. No hybrid here, the hair's just gone.
Me: I see.  

**These are actual conversations from my tour of Trundle last Saturday, and one of the best tourist destinations I've ever had the good fortune to see**

First off, I can't believe I get to be the first to review the infamous Trundle Manor. What.An.Honor. But I do have one question: How the hell has Trundle flown under the Yelp radar for so damn long? Step up your game, Pittsburgh! Don't let these gems pass you by. 

All my life I've been told that I'm strange, and in that life I've been to a lot of strange places, but this one is up there--even for me. Defo top 5, maybe even top 2 and absolutely a place a you should put on your bucket list, no matter who you are. Sure, dead sh*t in jars, hobo treasures and the singing steam-punk stomach tumor of a beloved belly dancer might not sound like everyone's idea of a good time, but try to keep an open mind and know that one trip to Trundle Manor will not only act as the centerpiece of your Pittsburgh memories, but as a major talking piece for the rest of your life. Promise. The only issue will be trying to find any place that can live up to the wonderment and awe of Pittsburgh's TM. 

The Curators of Trundle Manor's curiosities are the aforementioned Mr Arm and his lovely lady-friend/fiancee, Velda Von Minx. There's also a live cat amongst all the collected, stuffed and jarred felines named Little Devil who's just the biggest sweetheart. Their story is pretty cute and while I don't want to ruin it for you, it involves two taxidermied married squirrels that are on display in the den. Touring the manor is by appointment only, but there are times of the year where they don't do tours at all because the demand is just too high, namely in October when Halloween requests run rampant. If you're lucky enough to get an appointment to tour the manor, you should note that there is no official cost, though donations are accepted (and encouraged... by me). Keep Trundle truckin'! They'll accept cash in the donation box in the foyer or donation of dead animals, medical devices, cleavers, alcohol (no beer) or anything creepy, just don't be cheap--There's lots of eyes watching you at the manor. 

Among the many oddities already mentioned, you can also spy a number of the items below and then some. 
- Papa, Momma and Baby Bear + GoldiFox
- An old-timey medical syringe that's large enough to act as a cattle prod
- A cat on a hat
- Legos
- Colon photos
- 100+ year old stuffed fox
- Old electro-shock machine
- Jar of human teeth
- Jar of human skin flakes
- Jar of human finger and toe nails
- Tentacles
- A family of amphibians
- A happy turtle/chick hybrid family of five
- Steampunk bears
- Bindle stick bundles
- A gerbil named 'poop'
- Ray guns
- Gimp-type masks
- Original Addams family goodies
- Carnival treasures
- Classically un-classic built-up cars, fit for the zombie apocalypse
- I got lucky and found a rogue bird foot on the floor during my tour, so keep your eyes peeled for hidden treats
- And soooo much more...

When you go (and you NEED to go) be sure to take pics, bring a decent donation and do ask as many questions as can. Half the fun is getting to hear the story behind each of the items from Velda and Mr Arm. If curious, peculiar, macabre are your thing, or even if you were ever a fan of the hit Nickelodeon show Cat-Dog, this is THE place to hit up if you're interesting in seeing a collection of quirk that you won't see anywhere else in the entire world.

This Auntie Anne's is located inside the food court at Red Rock Station. It opened a few months back and received some good reviews so hubby and I stopped by to try for ourselves. For a tiny pretzel shop they had a a nice variety of things on the menu, including vegan-friendly options. 

When it comes to pretzels they offer the following:
Plain
Garlic
Jalapeno
Cinnamon Sugar
Pepperoni
Raisin
Sesame
Sweet Almond
Honey Whole Grain
Sour Cream and Onion

Pretzel Stix and Pretzel Nuggets come either salted or in cinnamon sugar. They also have Pretzel Dogs that come in sizes mini, regular and jumbo.

Dipping Sauces:
Cheese 
Melted Cheese 
Hot Salsa Cheese
Marinara
Caramel 
Sweet Mustard
Light Cream Cheese
Sweet Glaze

I ordered a "Sour Cream and Onion" and "Jalapeno" pretzel. They were priced at $3.49 each. I also ordered 2 melted cheese dips priced at 75 cents each. The cashier was very friendly and they had samples out on the counter. One thing I did like is the cashier asked if I wanted my pretzels salted or unsalted. I don't like salt on my pretzel and some places have it already on the pretzel and I get stuck picking it off, at least here I had the option to have it with or without. The sour cream and onion pretzel was just ok. It wasn't as soft and warm like I'm used to and it could have used more of the sour cream and onion on it. The jalapeno pretzel was pretty good, but again on the dry side. They weren't stingy with the jalapenos which was nice, but it seemed like the pretzel wasn't as fresh as it could have been. The melted cheese dip wasn't melted at all. I think she gave me the regular cheese dips instead. I didn't mind the regular cheese dip however the cheese being warm would have been more to my liking. Since I get coupons for Auntie Anne's I will be back, but I can't see paying full price again if it isn't going to be hot and fresher.

Right now they are open Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays from 7 am - 12 pm. Admission is free if you are walking in, but $3 to drive in with your vehicle. There is parking right across from the entrance if you decide not to drive in. I grew up coming to this orchard for school field trips as well with family and friends. I love that this place is still here! The area is rich in history, which could take a whole review alone so, I recommend reading up on it sometime and maybe you will appreciate the area even more. They have such a huge orchard that depending on the time of season you come, you really need to dress accordingly especially if you plan on walking through. There is about 60 acres to explore. They have a stand at the entrance if you just want to grab some stuff already picked, or you can take your time exploring the orchard and pick what you like. They provide wagons for you to use.

When I visited yesterday they were offering the following:
Carrots - $1 per pound
Beets - $1 per pound
Cucumbers - $1 per pound
Green Tomatoes - $1 per pound
Apricots - $1 per pound
Squash - $1 per pound
Zucchini - $1 per pound
Peaches - $1 per pound
Honey - $7 for the honey bear and $20 for a quart
Garlic - $2 for 3 bulbs or $10 for 3 pounds
New Potatoes - $2 per bag
Onions - $1 each
Peanut Butter - $6 each
Almond Butter - $8 each 

I came specifically for a honey bear and some peanut butter. Both sell out fast and aren't always available. If you can get your hands on some, I recommend it! The honey is fresh and comes right from the orchard. The peanut butter us a huge hit in our house and doesn't last long. If you ever at the orchard when they are making fresh apple cider donuts you must try some! They are usually only a couple bucks and SO worth it! Sign up for their weekly newsletter and find out when they have available for harvest and what types of food items they might be cooking up.

It was a little quiet at work so I decided it was a good day to have an offsite lunch. I yelped new spots in Chinatown.

Yes, this is the old Anime place, and the maid place which I did not get to try. It is next door to Kaya Sushi. 

We ordered the Roti to start and it was one of the best in Las Vegas, next to Island Malaysian and Veggie House. It was freshly sauteed and fluffy. The sauce was slightly spicy but nothing too fancy (because the Roti was the star). 

I read the restaurant was opened by Thai people so I was hesitant about ordering anything not Thai or Southeast Asian, but my Ramen craving was still going strong, so I had to try their Tonkatsu Ramen. The ramen was the thin noodle kind, with a really tasty, savory and sticky broth. The pork was tender, sliced really thin, and was surprisingly good. The major difference was that there were fried shallots added, and that totally changed the flavor profile, in a good way.   

I was also able to try a slice of the roasted pork from another noodle soup dish, and again, it was surprisingly good, sliced thin and flavorful. 

Side note, their entire menu is pictorial, so that made it really easy to pick what to order! 

I would absolutely come back... to try the other menu items, as well as the Roti again!

I always reward myself after a long run so after a short rest in my hotel room following the half marathon this was the first place I headed to.  

Located on the main level of the Bellagio Resort & Casino the little bakery is difficult to miss with scores of interested passers-by stopped in front admiring the World's Largest Chocolate Fountain (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=Fwze61auOtWIO7qqZftfoA and http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=NNY_w4GCH3S7XDDwwT6EMw) as confirmed by the Guinness people.  Many people seemed to focus in on the delicious Santa (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=vrgekS99XPXpSALLiAv8hA) too as the bakery is all decked out for the holidays.

Decorations are nice, but my focus of attention went straight to the bakery case because all of the little desserts (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=cUvmX9TR0T-SsadcR6CXCw and http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=xd8x-dTVzmXltk3mMp2Bow) on display looked fabulous.  They even had sugar-free selections (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=OliyqIlWdwkr3ssI_z--Vw)!  Everything looked great, but something else I had glanced at earlier caught my attention first.

At the very front of the bakery behind a sheet of curved plexiglass is a crepe station where you can watch as freshly made crepes are prepared on a hot griddle.  They had two crepes on display, a mixed berries crepe (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=Y23VBoGim8Vl8JSUTUQM5w) and a chocolate decadence crepe (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=NHqifygfOqSomQpVOprLyQ).  I ordered one of the chocolate ones.  It took a bit of time to be prepared, but the overall product was worth the wait.  The display crepe actually looked better and had a bit more chocolate and a lot more powdered chocolate, but I'm thankful because the crepe I was served was sweet enough.  The chocolate pieces, shavings and glazes were decadent alright and the crepe was nice and chewy.  I didn't eat all the cream as I felt pretty bloated after this dessert.

I didn't stop with the crepe either.  I returned to the counter and ordered a single chocolate-covered strawberry (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=S4rtxwJXeLP4BGi5lakoYA) to take with me to eat at a later time.  My strawberry was a bit squished by the time I returned to the hotel, but it was still delicious nonetheless.  I had fun licking the chocolate off the side of the bag.

The bakery serves gelato also and has a nice assortment of boxed confections on display.  There are other crepe selections also other than the two that were on display.  Jean Philippe Patisserie was the perfect reward to an excellent race.

FABU-nothing-LOUS-than-five-stars!!

Palazzo, you were so good to us during our Vegas trip! Let me count the ways...

1. The large suite was SAH-WEET!! 3 LCD TVs in the room (including the bathroom), one for each one of the Three Miss Yelps. Swank and modern decor. Velvet chaise lounges and sofas in our sunken living room for us to chill and use as fun props in our impromptu photo shoots. The beds were so comfortable, and the blackout curtains could have made us sleep until 3pm if some of us didn't have such precise internal clocks.

2. The service was top notch! Our request for extra goodies for our room were accommodated quickly, and a follow up phone call from the concierge was made to make sure we received everything we needed. One of the concierge, Angie, was so sweet and helpful. If it hadn't been for her recommendations, we would have missed out on dining at Okada in Wynn and Koi in Planet Hollywood. The doormen were also all super friendly!

3. The hotel is gorgeous! The newest resort/casino on The Strip, it offers the finest amenities, shopping and dining. Nestled between the fabulous Wynn and Venetian resorts, we were able to walk to each one easily (cabbed it to all other casinos, which is usually $10/way). The pool area is beautiful, and if you rent a cabana, it comes complete with a flat screen TV.

4. The room rates were a steal! Our 2 queen beds suite was a mere $209/night. Although wi-fi was not free, it was only $10/day. 

5. On our final day in Vegas, we decided that I would try my luck at the tables. We scoped out the blackjack tables, and as we were walking by, one of the dealers, Damion, asked us how we were doing. I got a good vibe from him and the rest of the players so I joined in. $15 minimum to play, I dropped down $40. Damion and the other guys at the table were super friendly and fun to play with. They even let me stay in the game when I only had $10 left. The player to my right gave me $15 of his chips to keep me alive when I lost my last chips. I walked away from the table 15 minutes later with $90!! You can call me Lady Luck. ;)

I went here with a group of six and everyone was pretty bombed after a fun afternoon on the strip.  Dinner suggestions popped up, but options got slimmer when a companion meeting us was sporting a Randy "Macho Man" Savage t-shirt.  Giada was undoubtedly out of the question.  Carmine's welcomed us with open arms.  

My jaw dropped as the hostess walked us to our table.  I gawked and commented out loud to no one in particular on the enormous portions at other tables.  Yeah, it's family style, but who's family??  The Brady Brunch with Alice?  Joey Chestnut's family???  The Klumps????  Monstrous plates of pasta were everywhere!!

The spicy wings were a fantastic appetizer.  $32 got us 24 wings, sliced fennel as opposed to celery, and their homemade bleu cheese dip.  Carmine's isn't a typical place to order wings, but these were some of the best I've had in recent memory.  The tomato based sauce had nice spicy kick and went so well with the thick dip.  The fennel grew on me bite after bite as it kind of worked as a palette cleanser.     

Then all the main entrees came out.  Good god!!  The chicken parmigiana had ton of cheese on top and managed not to be dry despite being hammered super thin.  Ragu with meatballs was suggested by our server and he didn't steer us wrong.  I overheard someone else say the meatballs were "tender as fuck".  I agreed.  

The main event was the "Four Pasta Special" which is only available Sundays.  If you have a chance to check out my picture, just look at how small the server's hand/wrist looks compared to the dish.  It looks like a child brought this dish over!  We barely made a dent in it.  I enjoyed lasagna and gnocchi the most.

My wife and I could never eat here by ourselves unless I cleared my car trunk out to make room for the leftovers.  The ones I did have on this particular evening came in a large aluminum buffet pan (no joke) and weighed at least 5 pounds.  If a full on Italian pig out is what you're looking for, look no further.

We are usually big fans of the foodie flavors that come out of Fox Concepts, but felt this one fell a little short for us.

True Food Kitchen is the brain-child of Dr. Andrew Weil and Sam Fox. Their two-fold mission is that every dish served must not only be delicious but must also promote the diner's well-being. Our palates were somewhat uninspired by the offerings

True Foods is also showcasing proper proportions and the benefits of an anti-inflammatory food pyramid diet of Dr Weil. The only problem is the menu prices need to go on a diet too.  Everything is tasty, but a tad pricey

Our introduction might have also been tempered by the amateurish hostess station, which seemed more interested in having a conversation with a girlfriend friend who stopped by, rather then sitting the customers.  We watched in amusement until our turn came. LOL  

Our server was a bit spacey too.  She was MIA for long stretches of time during our meal and was only bailed out by the other servers.

We tried the Spaghetti Squash (photo) with a "protein" of Chicken Sausage and the Teriyaki (photo) with a "protein" of chicken with brown rice. BTW, "protein" is True Kitchen's favorite add on noun.  

As for our meal, we found the squash was overwhelmed by it's spaghetti sauce, which was mildly spicy which we liked.  Though we really enjoyed the chicken sausage "protein".  As for the the Teriyaki it was somewhat bland and overwhelmed by the brown rice.  Hard to believe.  We did enjoy the Pomegranate Limeaide (photo) and the Honey Ice Teas.

Expect to pay around $30 per person, including one non alcoholic drink.  Our return factor is less than twenty percent.  Sorry.

SITEREP:
If you've been following along in the newspapers, Fox Restaurant Concepts made national headlines in February 2012, when PF Chang's acquired a 51 percent stake in True Foods after providing a initial $10 million in start up costs back in 2009.  http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2009/08/10/daily51.html
http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/morning_call/2012/02/pf-changs-buying-majority-stake-in.html

They are showcasing a cookbook from Dr. Weil and chef Michael Stebner which includes more than 125 original recipes.  On the menu you will find Spring Salad with Aged Provolone, Curried Cauliflower Soup, Corn-Ricotta Ravioli, Spicy Shrimp and Asian Noodles, Bison Umami Burgers, Chocolate Icebox Tart, and Pomegranate Martini and much more. 

They are hoping for a 50-restaurant rollout of the concept, over the next several years. The average 5,000 square feet True Foods space highlights the use of reclaimed wood and environmentally friendly materials, costing about $2.5 million and $3 million in each location.

I gave away our card with 4 stamps at the end of the meal.  THAT'S how sure our group was that none of us would ever return.  

This isn't sushi in the Japanese sense.  These are crazy freakin rolls/inventions that contain some raw fish in, on or around them.  Calling this Japanese is very misleading.  The typical roll on the menu sounds like this:

"Tastes and smells like your bitchy ex-mother in law's 1st semester college sophomore roommate who did the whole lacrosse team on a dare and got Hepatitis C roll:  Baked inside out roll stuffed with eel, cream cheese, bbq sauce, avocado, super super super white tuna, chopped yellowtail and spicy tuna, shishito peppers, scallop, garlic and salmon on top with orgasm, yum yum, and fuck me in the ass sauce on the side."

As you can see, they used the whole "I Love Sushi" concept and took it way over the top.  This could be a potentially fun dinner (as many Yelp reviews can attest) trying all the insanity but there were enough misses to warrant my negativity.  It wasn't fun, but it sure was funny.  

- Sushi rice was off.  Slimy?  Low quality?  I don't know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.  I see a lot of reviews raving about sashimi though.
  
-Speaking of sauce...what's up with drenching sauce all over nigiri?  Several pieces of nigiri came with sauce on top as a default.  We actually had to request it without.  Freshness of the fish was ok.  None of us died afterwards.  

-Pretty sure that was shrimp cocktail drenched in a soy sauce base and topped with scallion advertised as amaebi. 

-1 order of green tea was not green but it might have been due to the lipstick contamination on the side of the cup.  The liquid was a very, very light brown.  The server claimed it was green tea despite my protest.  Magically, the next cup of tea was suddenly very green.  So that's where Dirk Arthur has been performing all this time!!

- I didn't know uni came in so many colors.  The most suspect pieces were left on the plate.  The server didn't even question it.  She just took them away like she knew.

- My native Japanese dinnermates found the tamago presentation to be hilarious.  A tamago house!

At least the unagi was good.  Congratulations on well cooked eel!  Have a good life.

My wife and I celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary here.  What a dining experience it was!  

The complimentary gold MGM limo picking us up right in front of our place was sweet.  You must do this!  We were met by a beautiful hostess straight out of a James Bond film as we rolled up to the Mansion.  An amazing place to check out.  I guess this is what playing $25k a hand in blackjack gets you.  

We had all intentions of getting the 16 course dinner but realized there was no chance whatsoever of my very petite sized wife having even a hail mary's shot at finishing.  She might've reached course 10 at best.  

No problem!  Let's just fill up on champagne and do four courses.

There are so many extremely detailed reviews for this restaurant.  Read all of them!  I'm only going to do notes and observations:

- Is it possible to be too fancy?  This comes close. I love fine dining as much as the next fat Asian with glasses but the word "stuffy" came to mind.  Maybe my suit was too tight.  

- The man, the myth, the legend was there.  Right before our appetizers (ah-hem! Une Entree) came out I heard a "Bon Soir!" from behind me and there he was in the flesh!  Joel Robuchon!!  He shook our hands.  Joel stops by the restaurant 4 times a year according to the staff and he said we were lucky to see him.  I should've asked Mr. Robuchon to sign one of the rolls from the ridiculously amazing bread cart.

- The lobster salad with fruit was orgasmic.  

- Whoever invented foie gras should go down in history as one of the greatest people ever.

- Veal cheek kind of tasted like if a chicken thigh had sex with filet mignon.  I savored every little bite.  I believe the neighboring table shot me a look after I said this out loud to my wife.  Whatever.  More champagne please!!

- They served us an extra dessert to celebrate the occasion.  It was the white and yellow meringue fruit pie cake I took a picture of.  I forgot what they said it was called. Blame it on the ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah-alcohol.  Tremendous stuff!  We ordered 2 more dessert dishes and THEN the dessert cart came out.  Wow!!

3 hours later we were stuffed and ready for the limo to take us back.  A fantastic gourmet experience I would recommend to anyone.

Omakase!!
I'm a fan of Chef Nobu and I've been dreaming of dining at one of his restaurant some day. Well tonight was the night

I got a seat at the sushi bar. 
A great way to see the action up front and personal. 

I went with the Omakase (Chef's Choice)
13 cold dishes
3 hot dishes
Desserts

Here's the rundown:
Cold dishes:
Nobu Tako w/ Jalapeo Sauce - a great way to start things off. 

Toro Tartare - Wow, melts in your mouth goodness. 

Toro, Big Eye Tuna, Abalone, Tamago, Scallop w/ Fresh Pickled Ginger - this was the nigiri part of the meal. Every thing was great. Fresh, clean tasting sushi. Yum!!

Amaebi w/ Uni, Egg Custard & Snapper - the shrimp and Uni was ridiculously good. Egg custard was so creamy and tasty. The anapper had a yuzu sauce that was so good (and I don't usually like yuzu)

Xxx salad, Amberjack,  xxxxx - I didn't get the names on the last 3 cold dishes, but they were all good. 

Hot dishes. 
Grilled Diver Sea Scallop w/ Tomato Sauce & Chive Oil - Scallops were perfectly cooked, but that sauce was AMAZING!!

Wagyu Beef w/ Garlic Butter & Brussels Sprouts. OMG!  Melts in your mouth goodness. PERFECT!!

Ramen w/ Crab and Vinaigrette Broth. A nice dish to finish the meal. 

Dessert:
Sudachi Cream, Merengue, Hazelnut and Black Sesame Ice Cream - a Napoleon (sideways). That sudachi (Japanese Citrus) cream was delicious. Hazelnut provided the crunch. A thin chocolate sheet provided the sweetness. That black sesame ice cream is the BEST ice cream I've had in a long long time. It was creamy, not too sweet and the sesame flavor shines through. I highly recommend it. 

Service was SUPERB!
From start to finish, I was pampered. 

For me, one of my dining dreams come true and it lived up to everything I imagined it to be. 

My Rating:
5 Star Plus!! 
Try it for yourself and decide.

Dr. Susan Boyd almost cost me my life... 

She performed, well attempted to perform a normally simple laproscopy procedure going through my belly button to remove a cyst from my left ovary. 

This procedure she performed in a surgical clinic by her office near UMC. 

I was sent home about one hour after the procedure once my anesthesia wore off. 

I was home for two hours resting and I started feeling faint and my lips and face were turning blue. I felt like death, I knew something was wrong because my body was shutting down and I was slowly losing consciousness. 

My husband at the time called an ambulance and they rushed me to Spring Valley hospital where I passed out upon arrival. 

I don't remember anything other than waking up connected to lots of tubes, IV, and various life support machines. 

Come to find out I was bleeding internally and my organs shut down. 

Emergency surgery was done, following two blood transfusions. 

Rather than her performing the simple laporoscopy going in through my belly button and lasering away the cyst, she missed that completely and punctured my small intestines causing me to bleed internally. 

She did not remove the cyst, that I still have on my left ovary, in which she even goofed on the paperwork stating she removed a cyst from my right ovary which there is none. 

That is the irony of this, I went through hell in vain as the cyst is still there and was never removed. 

I ended up in surgical ICU for three weeks at Spring Valley hospital where I underwent a bowel resection to remove six inches of my small intestines she punctured through and damaged. 

I went through hell to say the least. I am LUCKY to be alive. This woman almost took my life. 

Thank you Spring Valley hospital and the two Doctor's called in as an emergency from other hospital's to save me. I was in such grave condition they did not have a Doctor on staff who knew what to do, or who could handle my emergency situation, so they called out for help from two hospitals in the east side of vegas. 

Her office placed a follow up call to my hubby and was aware I had been admitted to the hospital two hours after my procedure, not once did her staff nor her contact me or the hospital to inquire about my condition. 

They were rather nasty when my hubby went to pick up all of my medical records. They made him come back so that they could review them and make changes to them. That is not what they said but what they did. Dr. Susan Boyd attempted to cover up her mistake and by doing so she screwed up the documents all together. I was treated for a cyst on my left ovary, all of a sudden she states removed from right ovary which there was none? 

Yes Malpractice you say? It was however I signed my life away to allow a "simple" laproscopy procedure to be performed not knowing I was going to have my vital organs butchered. 

It took two years to recover from this ordeal. I have a real doozy of a scar from my breast bone clear down to my private area where I was split open for correction surgery, not once but twice. Basically ALL of my plumbing was redone. 

I was so close to having to use a colostomy bag the rest of my life. Luckily I had two great Doctor's perform my bowel resection as a team together side by side. 

It is a tragedy that Dr. Susan Boyd got away with this...she knew when she left me at the clinic that she had really botched this procedure. 

I wonder if she knew she perforated my intestines or as the result of it that I was bleeding internally? This I will never know... 

If I could rewind time I would, I can live with a cyst in which I am since she did not remove it. 

Karma is a you know what! 

She will get what is coming to her I am sure. 

She basically almost got away with murder and skipped out on a two hundred thousand dollar hospital bill. Three weeks in surgical ICU to keep me alive was not cheap! 

I am alive, physically and mentally scarred for life... I made it :) 

I am still here to share with the world, my love, laughter and smiles... 

This is just another example and reminder of some of the hell and life threatening close calls I have been through with "Doctor's" based in las vegas. I have only lived in Las Vegas 6 years and have had the worst outcome in dealing with Doctor's here. Yes a bad Doctor can be anywhere, yet I lived in San Diego and Los Angeles for years and had nothing but the best outcome and care from Doctor's and providers. Take warning if you have to have any medical procedure's done in Las Vegas.

I was 32 when this happened a few years back, I am alive because I was a fighter and was not ready to call it quits on life at such a young age. Especially not for the incompetence or at the hands of a Doctor who we are to trust with our lives!

As far as I know, I'm the only person in this town that has a dish named after them. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I'm right. I mean, I'm always right.

By now, if you read my reviews, you know that I am vegan and I don't eat gluten. This makes dining out quite an issue at times, especially for breakfast/brunch. 

I really wanted to hit up The Vig Uptown for brunch because I like it as a Happy Hour spot, the space is incredible, it is within a bike ride from my house, and I love the Original Vig, but alas, there was nothing on the menu to accommodate me. I gently mentioned in person and a few times on FaceBook that having some sort of tofu scrambler would really improve their menu.

They listened.
They created.
They named. (after me!!!)

We stopped by for brunch this past Sunday for the dishes debut, and got a personal hello from Tucker. He was excited because they had already sold TEN AMber Scramblers that morning and it isn't even officially on the menu yet! I'm already a star!

So, whats the verdict on the AMber Scrambler? Amazing. Seriously. The thing that really sets this apart from other scrambler dishes is sun dried tomatoes. They bring such a delicious flavor! It certainly doesn't hurt that it comes with their signature guac and a side of pico.

I'll be here every weekend for the delicious dish and the $5 fresh squeezed mimosas! If you know whats good for you, you will too.

Firehouse Subs is a relatively new place here in the Valley and they offer up a tasty, toasted version of a tired old lunch staple.  

I was driving aimlessly south into Phoenix with a vague recollection that there was a Firehouse Subs nearby. I almost gave up when I saw the Chicago Hamburger sign, but it was only a little further along Indian School. I actually nearly drove past it, before turning into the strip mall at the last second.  I found a parking space in front, and the place wasn't too crowded for one o'clock. 

As I said in my Tip, these folks are over the top friendly, but in good way. They greeted me warmly as I came in, asked if I had ever been here before and offered up that their #1, #4 and #5 Subs were their most popular sandwiches.  Nice!

I took a few moments to study the board before ordering the New York Steamer. It's a nice combination of Corned Beef, Pastrami and melted Provolone. They then asked if I wanted the usual of mustard, mayo and Italian Dressing on it? Say what? 

Mayo I thought?  I haven't heard of mayo on a pastrami & corned beef sandwich since Woody Allen accused Diane Keaton of doing that in "Annie Hall" LOL

You should know, that almost all of Firehouse's medium subs are $5.89. They advertise that for $2.00 more, you can get the large. So, a large it was and I asked them to hold the mayo & dressing. 

I've taken a few pictures of the inside of the restaurant and of my sandwich. It was very large, probably a foot or so long. It was also very good, but too much to finish. I wrapped the other half for home and was told later by one of my homebodies, that it was really very good. LOL. Clearly, I'll need to start marking my food in the frig. 

Besides what I ordered, Firehouse also has something called the "Hook & Ladder" it's a sub of Smoked Turkey & Virginia Ham with Provolone; a Firehouse Meatball; an Italian with salami, pepperoni, ham with melted provolone; a Club; a Turkey Bacon Ranch; and a Firehouse Steak & Cheese. They also have two Premium Subs on the menu: the Firehouse "Hero", with roast beef, smoked turkey breast Virginia ham and provolone; or, the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket for $6.19 each. 

My large #3 NY Steamer, with mustard only, came to $7.89, plus $0.66 in taxes for Gov Brewer. BTW, I cannot wait for the State to rollback those temporary sales tax increases can you?  LOL

Enjoy!

I had an appearance at the Chandler Performing Arts Center across the street on Saturday, January 25th.  My wife and I decided to make a road trip out of it and had intended on arriving a couple of days early to visit with family and do some sightseeing. Since I used to live in Arizona, I wanted to show her around a bit.  Our reservation was for the two bedroom Presidential Suite.  We arrived in Chandler at 7:10 pm, after driving for nearly eight hours.  We pull up to the valet station, but there is no valet in sight.  We leave our car in front and go up to the check-in desk and ask about the valet/bell hop.  The gentleman behind the counter (I didn't get his name) informs us that the valet/bell hop service ends at 7pm and that we had "just missed it"  We then proceed to at least check in to our room. The gentleman tells us that the Presidential Suite is occupied. My wife and I were both in disbelief.  He said that the current occupant is there for two nights and we were scheduled to stay four nights, so we could move rooms once it's available.  To make up for the inconvenience, we were promised all sorts of comps including "free breakfast" coupons.  My wife and I were so livid and tired we just wanted to lay down.  All we requested is for our rooms to be adjoined.  While the hotel clerk was scrambling to find us rooms, another gentleman named Brandon recognized me and offered to take our bags to our room.  Once we arrived in our rooms, we discovered that our rooms were NOT adjoining.  The next morning, we were contacted by the front desk to alert us that the Presidential Suite was available, but it only had one bedroom.  The other room would be "close by"  We decided to just stay put in our original rooms.  At least they were next to each other and fortunately, the rooms are very nice.  Leading up to the night of my performance, I wanted to get my pants pressed. I called the front desk and I was told that there is no laundry service on the weekends. So, no valet or bell service after 7 and no laundry service on the weekends.  I have never heard of this!  I thought these were just standard hotel services.  I later get a knock on my door by a hotel employee delivering our "free breakfast" coupons.  I mention the "no laundry on weekends" policy and she confirmed it, but offered to press my pants for me.  Unfortunately, I didn't get her name  but I'm certain I got this service because she also recognized me.   Regardless of that, I did appreciate that.  

My wife and I decided to check out a day early, since we'd prefer to be home together instead of in separate rooms.  When we checked out we were given our room charges bill and there were no comps or free breakfasts.  Needless to say, if we ever return to Chandler, we will not be staying at the Crowne Plaza.

My Friday night plans fell through and wound up with my son and his boyfriend and we were starving I asked them if they were up to trying out a new Thai place that we haven't been to yet and they answered back quickly with a yes, let's go!

We got their around 8:45pm and the place was sort of emptied out, but it was perfect for us. I also noticed that I got a free Thai Tea for checking in on Yelp! How sweet is that!  

For starters we ordered the chicken satay, the chicken was delish and full of flavors, the peanut sauce was amazing! My son and I at the same time said we could bath in the peanut sauce it was that good! Apple doesn't fall far from the tree I guess. But that sauce is amazing! Love it! 

One ordered the Massaman Curry, mild and that dish looked so very yummy! He said it was delish too! The other one ordered the Chicken Pad Thai mild without bean sprouts and he loved it too!

I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai as well, but had my Thai hot baby, bring on the heat I say! I enjoyed the Pad Thai, the noodles where perfectly cooked, the chicken was very tender and so tasty! The pad Thai did come with tofu, which next time I know to have it without tofu but since it was already on my plate I went ahead and tried it out, and well it was flavorless and blubbery, like you would imagine a whale to be. It's not my thing, but I tried :) .

My son and I have a favorite little Thai place on the other end of Mesa that we love, but I think Thai Spices just might have knocked them out, can't wait to come back and try the pineapple fried rice of course with chicken!

My sister and I were debating between restaurants and finally settled on Tonkatsu Kiyoshi. We took a little long in deciding and ended up arriving at 9:55- they close at 10. I really didn't want to be THAT jerk, but I was so set on katsu at this point that I poked my head in and asked if they were still open and they graciously gave us a table. The owners here are from Hawaii and the service definitely reflects that- genuine, helpful, and you can tell they take pride in what they're putting out.

The potato salad we started with was more vinegary than I'm used to for Japanese style, but delicious nonetheless. It was smooth with cubes of crisp apple and cucumber throughout, and distinctly eggy from the shredded egg lacing through it.

The katsu was a work of art, truly. Perfectly cooked cal rose rice with crispy golden sliced katsu over the top. My sister had the chicken and ebi combo while I opted for the katsu curry. Miso soup comes with all meals here, and it was definitely a robust version. 
The chicken and shrimp came with cabbage salad with Yuzu to dress it on the side, as well as some pickled shallots. The cabbage salad was a perfect fresh compliment to the crunchy fried katsu goodness. Everything was cooked perfectly and the shrimp were gigantic and absolutely incredible! The menu stated that they use black tiger prawns and they weren't kidding.
The katsu curry was very flavorful and the curry itself was thick and could stand up on its own. This dish came simply with pickled ginger and was enormous! All portions here are enough to make two meals out of, unless the katsu is so overwhemingly addicting that you just eat until you pseudo-hate yourself.

Being that it was my first time here, I was a noob to the whole sauce bit. I've never ground my own sesame for katsu sauce, it's just always arrived with my meal! The waitress saw me and came over to explain how it worked and got it started for me. She also had to open my bottle of Ramune for me =( A+ for service, but next time I come in I'll be pro!

What can I say that hasn't been said. Outstanding burgers, should be enough to say.

Went for lunch Saturday of memorial day weekend. Got there at 2 and the place was pretty full with at 15 minute wait for a party of three. But actually got seated in a booth in 10 minutes.
Service was pretty quick, I'd say within 3 minutes or less after seating. Got the drink orders in right away while we looked over the menu and the build your own configuration sheets.
I ordered the standard deluxe with white American, and their own house burger sauce, done pink. I also ordered the fries instead of the chips which come with.
Jody ordered the bison burger and Linda the Crab Shack.
Jody, who has been around and is hard to please gave his an 8 or 9 out of ten. That's a real complement. Linda said she loved the crab shack. Also we had two shakes, one just plain chocolate shake and Linda had the Espresso Love which sounded great and was except it was just kind of too sweet.

Funny thing happened while we were here when the power went out for a few minutes. Just a little added excitement.

Well we will all be coming back here again to try and work our way through the menu and all the options. This place is highly recommended by usens.

A lifesaver during my last Vegas trip. My first mistake: assuming everything there would be fattening and unhealthy like every other crepe place. But wait! They have fresh cleansing juices. Oh my! I've never been into juicing but this place changed my mind for sure. 

Have you ever become FITTER during a Vegas trip?!? Well, it happened to me. I was very pleased with the surprising results. How did it happen?

All hail the **Detoxifyer**! Densely packed with kale, celery, apple, beet, ginger, and lemon, the juice is delicious compared to many of the healthy concoctions out there. Of course it can't compare to a sugary juice, but it does soooo much more.

I had arrived in Vegas knowing I would be attending a pool party at Wet Republic after 4 days of eating terribly. There were no vegetables or good salad options anywhere around. So I had a feeling I'd gain weight by the time I had to don a bikini. But hey! Detoxifyer to the rescue! One juice once a day for 3 days was enough to do the trick. On the 4th day I put on my swimsuit and was actually impressed. I couldn't believe it.

If you need something more substantial to eat (I did), try **The Fitness** crepe and add Alfredo chicken to the mushroom spinachy mozzarella goodness. I split one of these with with my friend and also had the Detoxifyer.

The only thing I'd change about this place is the system to indicate when orders are ready. They have to shout the order number out and then people come up and take items without having to show a receipt. Maybe a more automated system that shows a number and patrons have to show proof of purchase. My order was stolen twice! Granted the MGM Grand was overrun by about 15,000 people from my company's convention. But still, such a system would help even on a daily basis.

Overall I love Blizz for introducing healthy juice options to me. Thank you to the clerks for the recommendation! And special thanks to the Detoxifyer! You've really opened my eyes.

DATE TIP: The Detoxifyer will definitely get you ready for your next hot Vegas date. 

TIP: [[[ T.M.I. Alert ]]] Remember that what you put in must also come out. You may have to use the restroom slightly more often than before, and things may look the same color as when you consumed them. The Detoxifyer is a vivid pomegranate color. Haha, I told you it was TMI. You've been warned!

BurGR is definitely a fun place.

I'm not a big fan of GR's TV persona or schtick.  Though there is something positive to be said about his mercurial nature and focus on detail.  So, given our short eleven hours in Vegas, we decided to come here.

At the heart of BurGR, you'll find some good food and I believe GR poking fun at himself.  The restaurant has several photos, as does the menu, of him hands up in a fit of mock anger.  I believe, there's a wee sparkle and impishness in those eyes.

So, what about the food you say?

It's good!  Very good in fact.  And, those BurGRs are worth every penny of the $14.00 to $17.00 you'll pay to enjoy them.

The reason isn't too hard to understand.  Given that mercurial nature, GR chose to cook the food: "Paying special attention to not only the ingredients but the method, beef patties will be cooked over an open flame fueled by hard woods."  

So it isn't too difficult to see why they have a complex smokey taste, that layers nicely with the various toppings and ingredients. 

We had the American and Euro BurGRs.  The Euro (photo) came with truffle aioli, goat cheese and arugula, while the American came with american cheese, butter lettuce, tomato, pickles and red onion.  Both were delicious, though the Euro was more interesting on the palate.  GR's focus to detail even shows up on the selection of the bun. Nice!

Another WOW if you will, were the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Seems the BurGR fries are "hand-cut and thrice cooking will ensure extra crispness" and they use Kennebec instead of Russet potatoes  which "offering a lighter, less starchy and crisper fry"  

Okay, we agree.  But what makes them special, is the hair like shavings of parmesan cheese (photo) with a special aioli oil sauce for dipping. Ohh, are they good.

So, with a glass of wine, a nice pint of Leinenkugel on tap, a couple of BurGRs and some of those wonderful Truffle Fries, expect to pay around $27.50 each, not including gratuities or taxes.

Enjoy!

Spoon is easily one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. For fine dining, I put them in the top five.
Been here four or five times now just to make sure I was not dreaming. But for sure this is a solid four stars and edging on five. A few subtle enhancements could tip the scale to 5.
Dcor is nice and trendy with several seating areas including a great bar.  Service includes John the top sommelier in the area, usually two hostesses, well-mannered servers and great bartenders. Service is prompt and a drink order results in libations within 5 minutes along with a choice of waters. There is a very ample selection of cocktails and wines by the bottle or glass.
I should mention there is a prompt and courteous valet service as another notch up the service pyramid.
Next the wonderful bread basket with warm selections of biscuits, awesome cornbread and ciabatta or some other artesian bread with sugar or honey butter to complement. We usually need a second basket as a testament.
The short menu is a design to keep choices interesting but not drone on, the ingredients fresh, the food delicious and it changes often enough to keep regulars coming back.
Seafood is my favorite here in appetizer and entre, but the soups and salads are fresh and outstanding as well. A very well enjoyed appetizer choice from the other night we had the 'bacon and eggs' appetizer which was seared pork belly, 5 minute egg (just right) sauted spinach, and hollandaise. Also we had the crispy duck confit which was a fabulous set of ingredients of crispy duck, 3 grain salad, Indian spices, goat cheese, cucumber yogurt, and toasted almonds. Almost sounds like decadence and just about was.
Around the tale we had the shellfish pappardelle; Alaskan black cod; cassoulet which interestingly was comprised of roasted pork, chicken sausage, duck confit, braised cannellini + cranberry beans, herbed bread crumbs, and farm egg. This was 'dryer' version of cassoulet a French peasants, style stew.
We have tried many other appetizers and entrees on our other visits and they all were as wonderful as these I mention here. All had the same complexity of ingredients, preparations, with flavors all overwhelmingly pleasing to the senses.

Straight out of Cali and family owned. This location was originally built to be a Dunkin' Donuts, but DD never opened. I'm glad Tom's swooped in! You will find a variety of options on the menu here from burgers, tacos, burritos, sandwiches, bacon & eggs, pancakes, steak, pork chops,  fish & chips, salads, smoothies, and Mediterranean & Greek options, and believe it or not much more! They have some pretty good all day specials if you like breakfast.  Seniors 55+ get a free cup of coffee with any breakfast or lunch purchase.

Hubby and I decided to split the "Pastrami Sandwich Combo" priced at $9.59 plus 40 cents for cheese. The combo came with fries and a drink. I also wanted to try the "Zucchini" priced at $3.99 and it came with a side of ranch. The pastrami sandwich was SO good. The bread held up the sandwich well and the mustard and pickles were just right. I know this is something that I will for sure be back for. Good pastrami in Vegas is hard to come by. The fries were excellent. I wasn't actually crazy about the zucchini. The ranch that it came with was a decent size though. They make the onion rings and zucchini from scratch. I want to try the onion rings next time, but will pass on the zucchini again. 

They have a drive-thru if you don't want to eat inside. The burgers are made fresh to order and the steak and chicken is hand trimmed on site. There are a lot of things I want to try here at Tom's so I will be back!

Another 4 star Ramen spot in Vegas.  I'm really enjoying hitting up the various one's on every trip out to sin city.  This time it was meeting up with great friends from high school in Japan for a much needed girls weekend.  Being that we grew up eating ramen picking it for lunch was a easy choice.

Ramen Sora serves up all broth type ramen froms shio, shoyu, tonkotsu and miso.  They state they serve Sapporo Ramen which is miso based.  It is def one of my fave broth flavor that I grew up eating in Japan including the instant kind by sapporo ichiban!  Obviously the toppings at each ramen house varies but typically a bowl of miso ramen is served with chashu, bean sprouts and corn.  

Deluxe Sora Ramen ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#hCJU9RRGp3DKxDTlDB3YSA  You get to pick the broth choice and I decided to go with miso.  The bowl came out nice and hot.  Broth had a great flavor not salty as some can be.  Good ajitama. The chashu was nice and fatty and soft.  It was sliced on the thinner side but it was very good http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#D-VllyZqgYKzpRSSEh7PBw The noodles were the yellow curly chijiri type.  It was cooked perfectly and not mushy.  They offer 2 bowl sizes (regular and large) and additional toppings are offered for a reasonable price.  

Gyoza ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#eaaQo6H7y5Ob4t3j7ydoeg Fried up with a decent char.  The filling had a good flavor.  They have a premixed sauce so no guessing on the soy sauce to vinegar ratio. 

Ramen Sora is located a few blocks away from Monta.  Driving by this place in the evening you might think they are closed due to the tinting they have on the window but rest assured they are open.  The single building is of decent size and a good number of tables however I felt they could have used the somewhat open space with another communal table.  Depending on the time you get there you will def have a wait as we did albeit a short one.  

Eyes ~ Nice bowl of noodle goodness!
Nose ~ Smells so good!.
Ear ~ Happy chatting and eating.
Mouth ~ So very very good!.
Tummy ~ Satisfied!

Seven adult Yelpers and two young ones got together yesterday to give the new restaurant a go.  Opened just a week, the place has a winning combination of choices and flavors.

The Radar O'Reilly of our group (that's meant in the kindest way) had emailed the restaurant and arranged our tasting session picking from the most common dishes selected by the group.  It was a great idea in theory and execution.  Just as Radar procured things the 4077th needed, our Radar arranged our brunch perfectly.

We ordered:  bacon cheddar biscuits with honey salt butter; country house pt with pickles, fruit mostarda, and grilled bread; Cheesy garlic toast made with four cheeses; pimento cheese with Saltines, pretzel chips,and  breakfast radishes; smokey bleu cheese fondue with salt and pepper chips; black mission figs with goat cheese, pistachios, pomegranate seeds, and arugula; baked artichoke with Freekeh stuffing; dirty mac and cheese with burnt pork ends, four cheeses and Ritz cracker crust; butcher style chicken wings the menu describes as hot smoked, flash fried, salt & vinegar, sriracha. Buffalo or BBQ; bacon and eggs with thick bacon, deviled eggs, red onion jam and multi grain toast; breakfast poutine with two poached eggs on top of fries with turkey gravy and cheese curds; doughnut holes with dusted with cinnamon and served with a berry dip; load S'mores nachos made with graham crackers, torched marshmallows, toasted walnuts, Oreo cookie crumbs, chocolate sauce, and fluff cream; and last, banana pudding with Nilla wafers, salted caramel, and whipped cream.

The foods were all good.  My favorites would be the bleu cheese fondue, the pt, the bacon and eggs, breakfast poutine, and the cheddar bacon biscuits.  I'd go back alone and have just the bleu cheese fondue and the poutine.  If the skillet with the leftover bleu cheese had fit in my pocket without spilling, it would be sitting in my kitchen, empty and clean.  I thought if I walked through Tivoli Village just holding it upright, people might think I was panhandling--literally and figuratively.  The poutine was excellent and now I know why might Canadian friends rave!  The desserts were excellent, too, but of the three, get the S'mores nachos.

Service was superb throughout!  Chef Canteenwalla came to our table and spent a good amount of time with us explaining the restaurant and the concepts behind it.  We had a group photo taken with him and he was very outgoing!

This is a wonderful new restaurant on the West side and they have their good game on even though they've been open for just a week.  I can't wait to go back.  Fondue, you're mine!

Located way off the strip in an unassuming shopping center, you'd probably miss this restaurant if you blinked. Luckily, the stellar reviews made in part by my fellow Yelpers piqued my interest in finding this elusive favorite. Now locating the place is a challenge in itself but landing a reservation is equally exhausting!
As fate would have it, I landed a 9pm dining reservation. Woot! Little did I know, however, that a reservation merely meant when you arrived, you'd be relegated to waiting an additional 10-15minutes for your seat. 
That being said, I took the opportunity to park it at the sidebar to glance over the extensive menu while guzzling down a bottle of Asahi with shots of chilled nigori. 
Honestly, by the time I was seated, I was about three sheets to the wind! I know, I'm a cheap date.

Now onto the food shall we?

I went with the server's recommendations as well as my seasoned Yelp buddies' choices who've had successful dining experiences here previously...

Negitoro Blue Fin 35$ fresh and buttery slices of blue fin tuna with a cast of delectable condiments that left my taste buds doing a happy dance! Trust me, the experience is virtually umami x 10! 

Wagyu Sashimi 20$ - thinly sliced filets of premium rare wagyu beef with a hint of wasabi on top and accompanied with a special savory soy dipping sauce. The first bite was like velvet on my tongue and the mouthfeel was literally like butter melting in my mouth. Superb!

Agedashi tofu 7.50$ 1/2 order -a delightful dish with compelling flavors and an irresistibly soft texture that had me pining for more 

Butter sauted scallop 7$ x2 - my favorite dish of the evening. The butter poached scallops were soft and supple with an incredibly mouthwatering garlicky flavor and fluffy texture. Absolutely amazing!

Enoki Mushroom & Bacon 3$ x2 come on now, we know everything tastes better with bacon and this was no exception. Just order it and thank me later.

Chicken wrapped chicken skin 3x2 -tender chunks of chicken breast wrapped in succulent chicken skin. An indulgent  experience that is second to none 

Poached Egg with Sea Urchin & Salmon Roe full cast of delectable ingredients that left my taste buds in a tailspin of delight. Intriguing enjoyable and texturally fascinating! 

Other notable dishes included:
Kobe Garlic Skirt 7.50 x2
Kurobuta Pork Cheek 4.25$ x2
Foie gras egg custard 10
Duck in balsamic 4.50$ x2
Iberico Pork 10 x2
Nigori 40$ well worth it! IMO I bought 2 bottles :)

All in all, I had a great dining experience at Raku and it's safe to say I'd gladly return to enjoy their enticing small plates again and, of course, to imbibe in their spirits!

Happy Eats!

A new Ross yay! This makes me one happy girl :)

If you have been to Ross before then you wont find too much different about this one. They still claim to offer 20% - 60% off department store prices and and by what I saw they are doing just that. The fact that some find the brand name goods here "so last season" means nothing to me as long as the quality is good, I like it, the price is right and it's cute! I love that I can get such good quality items for less. 

The bedding area is a good friend of mine. If I want new sheets or pillows I always buy them at Ross. I picked up some sheets yesterday for $29.99 that retailed for over $100! I have bought this brand before in 2 others colors and love them so I was glad to come across them again. That is one thing about Ross, you might find something you love and go back and it's gone, or you go to another location and they have a completely different selection. 

The shoes are my favorite part about Ross! I can find shoes for every occasion at such great prices here! From flip-flops to high heels they have the cutest selection. It doesn't hurt that right now is "shoe week" so they were all marked down even more.

If you are looking for a new handbag or wallet then check here before heading anywhere else. I for years have bought my handbags and wallets from Ross and I feel much better about buying the same brand name handbag here over buying it at a major department store and paying more. They have a great selection at this location and even had the newer style of the one handbags I currently use so I snatched that baby up!

You will also find a good selection of women, men, kids and baby clothes. The one thing to keep an eye out for is clothes that might be ripped or stained. I find a lot of cute clothes I pick out might have a rip or odd color on it so I pay extra attention to make sure what I am buying looks new and good quality. 

You can also shop for stuff for the kitchen, jewelry, home decor etc. They have some really adorable kitchen decor. Gift cards are available in any amount between $10 - $250 and you can purchase them at the store or customize your own on their website. I will be here a lot!

When Denny's at 1am is the best meal you have had all day, you know something went horribly awry. 

Really I have nothing good to say about PastaBar other than I'm glad we didn't have a wait at 8pm on Friday night, but that is not saying much. 

The bread sticks they serve in the beginning? Dook 
Wine and beer selection? Also Dook. 

All three dishes we ordered came out lukewarm and the portions are really unimpressive, especially for the prices. I was not wowed one bit by anything, including the fried mozzarella. (which, btw, came AFTER our meal despite the fact that we ordered it first, as an appetizer....) 

Our server was a nice lady, but the service just wasn't good. The food wasn't good. I don't like the decor. I think its overpriced. 

I would really rather have gone to Olive Garden and paid $8.95 for the all you can eat pasta, salad and bread sticks. At least I would have been full when I left.

Thanks Denny's for saving my night.

What a let down this place was.

Everything is pretty small and served like tapas, but somehow its surprisingly filling.  There were definite highs and lows to this meal, but I think there were a few dishes that excelled while only a few weren't quite what we had hoped for.

There was a big group of us so I managed to sample quite a big portion of the menu.

Highlights:

Carnitas tacos-served with guac, pork rinds, and a verde sauce!

Like water for Chocolate- fried quail served with dragonfruit and edible flowers.  

Chilaquilles- tortilla chips cooked in a pan with a salsa verde and cheese.  Kinda like nachos.

Mango "sticky rice"- this is something quite interesting.  The sticky rice part was made into a mousse and ripe mangoes.  I've never seen this before and it was really cool.  The "rice" element were like rice crispies on top.  

Chocolate "terrain"- Awesome chocolate mold of a Chinese soldier with a spicy chocolate mousse inside.  It was served with cookie crumbs to look like sand, and a ginger ice cream that was spicy and sweet all at the same time.

Things to skip:

Oceans Nest- fried noodles served with stirfried saucy seafood and veggies.  We ate all the lobster out of it and then left it there.  It was super bland.

Lamb potstickers- pretty presentation with the little edible flowers and everything but it was bland and looked more exciting than it tasted.

Overall, I thought the place had a whimsy to it that I thought was fun.  The ambiance was interesting and diverting, the waitress and wait staff were helpful and went out of their way to see to our requests.  While some of the food is a bit overpriced and small, I really enjoyed their desserts, there is something light hearted and comical about them.  They were the highlight of the meal.  If nothing else, come and have dessert and a laugh all at the same time.

Some might call me a super-fan, but when Upward Projects does something, you can't help but love it. In the game of artisan pizza, Federal kneads out the competition. 

Having tried most pizzas from their menu, I've landed on the Manifesto as my normal order. I love the Manifesto, with exception of the mushrooms, so when I order it, I always sub for brussels sprouts instead, sometimes I'm feeling a little frisky and have them throw sweet potato on there too. Not only are they happy to make these changes for me, but the server usually says something like "That sounds delicious, I need to try it!"

The manifesto, with goat cheese, red sauce, fennel, schriener's sausage, and brussels sprouts is delish. The toppings are always super fresh, the crust is a bit crispier than most other artisan pizza's from around town and the service is always excellent.

$12 - $15 will buy you a pizza sized well enough for one hungry dude or in my case, large enough for two to share. Joining their email posse will usually score you a free pizza once or twice a year for things like your birthday or promotions they feel like running.

Their vegetable side is neither here nor there in my opinion, likely because I don't love carrots, but the broccolini were delish. 

If you're a dessert fan (remember two deSSerts and one deSert, in case you can never remember how to spell dessert or desert for that matter) they generally always have a fruit cobbler of some sort. If it's mixed berry, you must order it, dessert fans everywhere insist. Oddly enough, I don't order dessert at many places, mostly because I'm generally looking out for my figure, but in this case, I wouldn't be eating pizza either, but when I am, I sometimes order dessert. Go all out right? ;-)

Enough rambling and back to the part we're all waiting for... the end of this review.

Always delish, always fresh, and no one has ever actually gotten fresh with me while dining here, not yet at least. 

Happy Yelping Phoenix!

Gluttony at it's best!!

This is an AMAZING deal!! On a weekday, it's $50 (with total rewards card; $55 without the card) for 24 hours of food!! if you have rewards credits from gambling, you can use it to pay for your buffet! I used mine and got my gluttony pass for FREE!! On the weekend, the rate goes up... $75. the timer starts the very minute you buy it. I suggest starting at dinner like I did to get the most for your money. I probably wouldn't also do this deal on a weekend as the main thing I notice about the weekend is champagne with your meal and since I don't drink that, I do not want to pay extra for it. 

Anyways, the buffets included are (1) Spice Market @ Planet Hollywood, (2) Le Village buffet @ Paris, (3) Flavors @ Harrahs, (4) World Carnival @ Rio, and (5) Paradise Garden @ Flamingo. For a SURCHARGE of $10 you can eat at Village Seafood Buffet - TOTALLY worth it!!! For a SURCHARGE of $15, you can eat BREAKFAST at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers; for a SURCHARGE of $20, you can eat LUNCH at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers; for a SURCHARGE of $25, you can eat DINNER at Bacchanal buffet @ Caesers. 

If you want to eat at Caeser's, which is a VERY good buffet by the way, I suggest just eating there WITHOUT the buffet of buffets pass. I think the surcharges for Caeser's is too high, and that's probably due to how popular it is at the moment. Lunch there is $30 on a weekday and $50 for dinner... go during lunch and time it for dinner. The only difference I noticed with cold crab legs...

Anyways. it IS worth it to add the Village Seafood buffet. For my 24 hours of gluttony, I ate dinner at Spice Market ($30), breakfast at Le Village ($20), and dinner again at Village Seafood Buffet ($40). I wanted to really fit in a lunch, but woke up late and ended up having a late breakfast that didn't end will about noon already... otherwise I would had gotten more for my money's worth. In the end, I spent $60 for $90 worth of buffet... and if I had woke up in time and timed my meals better, I would had even gotten more of my money's worth!

I think this is a great deal for food!! Since you have the pass, go during off times to avoid lines and not waste time waiting... Next time I do this, I'm going to get in 4 meals!!! It's also nice because if you are craving a snack, you can also just stop into a buffet, grab some drinks and dessert just because!

If you eat like a bird however, then this is not the deal for you!

I was shopping at the nearby Centennial Center as I do pretty much every week and even though there are many food options within the shopping center, I was bored with those options at the moment. I decided to pull up places on the good ole yelp app and came across Above the Crust. It's on Ann Rd across from Painted Desert, so not too far behind Centennial Center. Deciding to give Above the Crust a try, I stopped in and placed a order. They have so many good deals going on each day! It being Tuesday meant that I could get a large pizza free with the purchase of a large pizza and toppings an additional $2 each. I went with a large cheese and a large pepperoni and added a couple "Garlic Rolls" priced at .95 cents each. I really liked the taste of the pizza and the sauce on it. The rolls had a nice garlic and butter flavor on the outside, the inside was a bit too much bread that was tough. I prefer a more traditional knot personally. When I walked in, I was greeted with a friendly hello from all the employees and I was given a menu and a flyer that shows the current daily specials offered. 

Sunday and Monday ($32.95) - Large pizza, bucket of wings, 4 garlic rolls and a 2 liter of soda.

Two for Tuesday - Buy one large pizza get one free.

Wing Wednesday (24.95) - Sampler bucket of wings, choose up to 4 flavors.

Friday Special ($29.95) - Large pizza and a bucket of fingers.

Stromboli Saturday ($17.95) - Large pizza and any stromboli. 

Daily special ($5.95) - 2 slices and a drink.

They offer delivery and also offer sandwiches, salads and calzones.

Fuck this place.

Yes, I said it and even after 6 years, I will still say it.

So the girls and I are on a tear it up Vegas weekend. All very cute and sessy gals for the record and all gals who appreciate the less than finer things in life like fake boobied strippers, over-priced drinks and titty bars. 

So we cab it over to the Crazy Horse Too after hearing that THIS was THE place to go. We roll up and instantly get static at the door. You can't come in without a date. Um, okay, well we are a bunch of girls with lots of money to spend? NO! But...? NO!

So we walk a few feet away and regroup while trying to keep the temper of one Drunky MaGoo down to a manageable level since the a-hole of a door guy was especially rude to this one girl in our group. I suggest grabbing a few guys and rollin in with them. I mean who cares, we can ditch them at the door but at least it gets us in. So we latch onto said guys and walk up.

Door guy says, NO!

I say, "You said dates, these are our dates. We are in love, let us in." (Mind you I'm drunk and his anger is amusing me at this point)

Door guy says, "fine you can come in, but that one stays out!" (pointing to my friend)

I say, "Come on, don't be THAT guy, did mama raise you to be THAT guy? She just really wants to see some boobs, surely you can relate."

Apparently he couldn't, but I also think he was suffering from mama abandonment issues and clearly wasn't loved enough as a child, but I digress...

He then decides that none of us should be allowed to come in. Fine, I'd rather not go if my friend is going to not be let in, so just give us our money back and we will go spend it elsewhere, right?

Apparently this is when the poor chap lost all sense of hearing as i became invisible and mute in his eyes.

"Excuse me, I said we'll go. Can you please just give us our money back?"

"Hello?"

"Umm"

"Yo!"

Retard Roy then starts smirking and it is quite clear that the four of us who "got in" will not be getting our money back, even though we technically never even entered the club. 

I then followed up with calls to the establishment the next day that were (to no surprise) never returned. Maybe they are in cahoots with Prime Time Shuttle as their customer service seems to be pretty dead on.

So if you are a girl don't go here. If you are a guy, have at it, but why waste your money on a place that won't let cute girls in who might actually go home with you for free. Just sayin.

Any Asian owned business that has the word "Spa" in its name will raise suspicions of being a "rub and tug."  Being a member of law enforcement,  I have to be extra vigilant about the businesses I patronize.  Imperial Health Spa was recommended to me by several female friends and after some research on Yelp, I felt it was an legitimate spa and made an appointment.

The spa layout is pretty simple unless you're gender-confused.  It is located in a two story building and divided into three areas; the top floor is the co-ed area and the bottom is segregated by gender. 

Before I go any further, I must warn you...  DO NOT go if you are not comfortable with same-sex full frontal nudity.  There will be naked people there and they will walk as if they are strolling in the park.  If you have a hang up about being naked, don't go, because if I catch you checking out my junk, I'm gonna kick your butt--and two naked dudes fighting in a spa is the last thing ANYONE wants to see.

When you arrive, you will be checked in by the receptionist, it costs $15 for locals and $20 for non-locals to use the facilities (Mani, Pedi, Facial, Massages, Exfols services are also available at extra cost).  You will be given a set of shorts,  hospital scrubs, 2 towels and a key.  The key is for your locker, the rest, hopefully, are self explanatory.

When you walk into the changing area, there will be mini-lockers, those mini-lockers are for your shoes.  You are now faced with a couple of decisions, put your shoes in the mini shoe locker or your key locker; and use the slippers in the mini shoe locker or go bare foot.  You're an adult, figure it out.

There will be lockers and the number on your key will correspond to the locker.  Get out of your street clothes,  wrap a towel around yourself, hit the showers.  In the segregated area, there will be:

Stand-up Showers
Sit-down Asian Showers
Hot Tub
Cool Tub
Salt Steam Room
Herbal Steam Room
Dry Sauna
Salt Hot Sauna

PLEASE SHOWER AFTER YOU VISIT EACH AREA... shower/hot tub/shower/steam room/shower/cave/shower/sauna... and any combination thereof, just shower after each "area."

The upstairs is the co-ed area, it consists of a general lounge area with big comfy lazy-boy chairs where you can watch TV and a mini-restaurant that serves basic Korean/Asian food as well as some boba/smoothie drinks.  Upstairs specialty rooms are as follows:

Salt Brick Room - A hot room with salt bricks
Red Clay Ball Sauna - Think kitty litter, for humans, without the poo.
Jade Sauna - Not sure what this room was for and didn't bother to read the sign, just remember it being hot
Red Clay Room- It's a red clay igloo... also hot.
Cold Room - Basically a walk in freezer
Mini Gym - I don't exercise, so I avoided this room.  I think there were treadmills and stationary bikes.

I got the combo package of "Pure Heaven" which consisted of a Body Scrub, Swedish Massage and Fresh Grated Cucumber Mask (70 minutes, $130).  The scrub was great, left my skin baby soft.  The cucumber mask made me hungry.  The massage was okay.  

I took one star away for the fact that I didn't have a choice of getting a female therapist... becuase I got the body scrub, the entire package had to be done by a middle-age Korean man.  I was told that if I wanted a female therapist, I should have separated out the massage and body rub; wherein the exfoliation would be done by a man and the massage portion, a woman.  Fine, next time I know.

I did enjoy the Tofu soup at the restaurant ($9.00)... which was prepared by a woman.

All in all, it's a pretty good experience, relaxing after having to deal with my crazy mother.

I had been wanting to give this place a try for sometime now. The location on Eastern is 5 star all the way, but the same vibe isn't felt at this location for me. The menu board above the register is painful to look at because it's awkwardly hanging. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu and checking on us while eating. I ordered a "Pizza Puff" combo priced at $4.50 plus 50 cents each for the addition of chili and cheese to the fries, onions were free. The pizza puff had cheese, sausage and sauce inside. It did taste ok. It reminded me of something you got for school lunch when you were younger, but in a very slightly better way. The basket of chili cheese fries is over $4 alone, so upgrading your combo with the addition of chili and cheese for just a buck makes it cheaper for the same size. The fries were good and the onions very fresh. The chili was not god though. I have had canned chili that tasted better. The basket of fries was a huge amount, but I really didn't eat but a few bites and then just couldn't eat anymore so a lot was wasted. I'd give the food here a 2 star rating alone, but I'm factoring service and cleanliness inside, so 3 stars seems fair. They do have some seating outside with umbrellas on the tables for shade. There is a bar with maybe 6-ish stools to sit at or you can sit at a table, but the tables are small (most seat 2 people) and if you get stuck sitting along the back hall area it can feel cramped. Currently on Tuesdays they offer wings for 50 cents each.

During a 2+ hour layover in PHX, we were headed to La Madeleine to get soup for the wife when we saw the French Onion Soup on the menu here.  Since we can do "La Mad" back home, we said what the heck and stopped in to Zinc.

Now, as everyone knows, French Onion Soup is general served with a "crouton" on top, on which the cheese melts.  But if you're gluten free like the wife, they'll just melt the Gruyre cheese right on the top of the soup-filled crock.  Even though it would probably have been more fun to be able to have the cheese on toasted bread on top (poor wife), she was pleased with the soup.

And speaking of Gruyre...  The truffled Gruyre Zinc Burger was as amazing as it looked.  Five stars right there.

The dessert we chose was some sort of chocolate bread pudding/cake situation, with a side of ice cream with "house made caramel sauce on top".  Eh.... Fairly forgettable (we didn't finish it, even splitting it between the two of us... well, wife could only have the ice cream).  Maybe pastry isn't their strong suit.  

Overall, it's pricy because of the airport premium, and it's trying a bit too hard to be a "bistro" (which for some reason, makes people think they should charge 10% more).  And we didn't have to wait very long for our food, which is necessary in an airport.  I was pretty happy with my burger, "frites", and beer, and there were plugs available between the tables to top off the devices. 

3.86 stars.  Which for an airport dining stop, is pretty darn good.

I had a slice of pizza from this place at a friends house shortly after they first opened. I couldn't remember if I liked it or not, so I suggested to hubby that we try this place for dinner. The employees inside were very courteous and friendly and the guy who gave me the pizza let me know they offer delivery, which is a plus if you like the pizza. 

Hungry Howie's claims to be "The Home of the Flavored Crust" and offers 8 different types to choose from. The concept here I do like. It sounds like a too good to be true pizza place. Well, it is in my opinion. The 8 types of flavors are butter, asiago cheese, cajun, butter cheese, ranch, sesame, garlic herb and onion. Sounds great right?

I ordered a large "Cheese Pizza" and a large "1/2 Pepperoni and 1/2 Sausage Pizza" as well "Asiago Howie Bread" to go along with the pizza. When I first opened the pizza it looked great. I asked for the cheese pizza to have butter cheese crust. I could see the ring of butter soaked into the pizza box around the crust and it didn't bother me because I did order a pizza with butter on it, but the crust as well the pizza in general had no real flavor. Maybe all the butter cheese flavor soaked into the pizza box instead? The pizza wasn't gross, it just wasn't great. Very average for all the flavor the menu claims to offer. Hubby had garlic herb on his crust and after I sampled a bite of his crust I tasted no garlic flavor. The howie bread I found to be dry and not the type of cheesy I was looking for. The total was $25.93 for the 2 pizzas and bread which I wouldn't have minded if the food tasted as good as it looked. I might be up for trying this place again in the future, but not anytime soon. 

Other things offered on the menu are salads, calzones and wings. You can also order online.

FOIE GRAS...F-orget O-ther I-nsignificant E-xperiences G-et R-eady (for an) A-mazing S-andwich at Goodwich.
That is what possessed me to drive from Henderson to Downtown with a growling stomach looking for a unique lunch and not settle for everyday boring because my usual lunch date has stomach issues.
I get to this little shack around 12pm with normal looking people standing in line...not a weird downtown crowd at all. I didn't know what everyone meant by "OG"...until I looked across the street and saw OG Topless Bar (good landmark)...maybe where the bad witch lives lol.
I walked up to order looking at the simple menu (with descriptions of ingredients, yay) knowing I was going to try the much talked about "Foie" even though I had a lot of apprehension from never having eaten foie gras in my life. I was bewitched by all the positive descriptions everyone posted about this sandwich that I had to have it...good, bad or otherwise I was going to try foie gras today. The gentleman who took my order was very reassuring that it would be a treat for me and that at $9, it was a great way for me to try it and not break the bank. I found an empty chair to eat that made me feel like I was a young student at school having my favorite sandwich at lunch.
As you can already tell, I LOVED it! Such a strange combination to put together but it all works. Foie gras mousse/terrine that had a creamy texture with light earthy, almost truffle-like hints (not at all gamey), this very crispy thick chicken skin (like when you hit the crispy skin jackpot on a perfectly roasted chicken), chopped almonds, and pickled purple cabbage that made sense as a necessity to cut the richness of the foie gras, all inside a grilled crunchy white bread that scrapes the inside of your mouth a little. Creamy, crunchy, savory...I couldn't believe this taste explosion that I enjoyed with each bite to the last. Oh yes. I finished the whole thing! I was really blown away how
 much I enjoyed this sandwich. It was life changing lol. It would be wonderful to see Goodwich occupy a space in the upcoming Galaxy Market in the Arts District...a space for artisanal foods, craft brews and aspiring restauranteurs.

I have been to this restaurant on several occasions, including my most recent experiences with their brunch menu. The atmosphere was much more upbeat in the morning than their dinner hours. Facing the street was the open bar accompanied by the sunny patio. On this Sunday, the lazy sunshine was slowly triggering through its rustic interior. 

I highly recommend their Eggs Benedict ($13). My dish came with perfectly poached eggs, English muffin, hollandaise sauce, crispy potatoes, and smoked salmon. The thick cut smoked salmon was delicious and not too salty. The thick gooey hollandaise sauce added refinement to the fantastic doughy texture of the English muffin. There was great purpose, balance and distribution of flavors. The potatoes were lightly salted and quite addictive. It had all the elements I was looking for in a benedict. 

I also enjoyed the Fall Squash Risotto ($13) served with crispy pork belly, squash, parmesan, rosemary honey, and risotto. The pork belly was nicely marbled to provide a nice contrast to the perfectly executed risotto. I wished this dish could come with more squash to accompany the risotto, but otherwise it's a dish I'd order again.

The Farmer's Market Frittata ($10) was really fantastic too. It came with oyster mushrooms, asparagus, cheddar, arugula, tomato, and other seasonal vegetables layered on top of the omelet. The combination of veggies was fresh and the range of diverse flavors further complicated the omelet at the bottom. It's a lighter alternative than the benedict, but we still had plenty of leftover to take home.

The dishes that did not live up to my expectations were the Cinnamon Roll ($5) and the Iron Skillet Pancake ($8). The Cinnamon Roll was expensive but also humongous and good to share. It tasted dry, bread-like, and lacked the full on moisture that I prefer in a cinnamon roll. It's a novelty and highly visible at every table, but unfortunately not something I'll be ordering again. 

The Iron Skillet Pancake came with olive oil, dark chocolate, berry compote, whipped cream, and maple syrup. The price was too steep for a single pancake. The pancake was easy to cut into until the sticky crispy outer ring. The berry compote was overwhelming the dark chocolate, but it was still a decent pancake without the expected wow factor.

My dining companion did not enjoy the coffee, so it's not something I would recommend. Service can be inconsistent, but friendly and responsive when you have their attention. There's not a lot of innovative breakfast and brunch restaurants in the Phoenix area, so St. Francis is a solid option for those looking for conventional wisdom with a twist of refinement. The other downside to the experience was parking. They have a small lot, and the required valet can be frustrating as you wait for your car when it is parked right in front of you. 

With all considered, 3.5 stars for the overall experience. I'd be interested in coming back for dinner.

I've been looking for a great Persian restaurant since my last dining experience at Doostan. It was quite a drive for me, but I enjoyed the food so much that I came for dinner twice within the same week. The vibe seemed subdued from the lack of patrons, but the quiet atmosphere made it a cozy place to bring dates and small gatherings. Along with the front patio, there was a full bar situated next to the entrance. Past the partition was the dining area with scores of smaller tables surrounding the long vertical one for large gatherings. The blue, purple, and beige dcor nicely complemented the warm lighting and a number of paintings on the walls.

Their complementary pita bread was thick, fluffy, and pillow-like with a hint of smoke. It was a great starter with Halim Bademjan ($7.50) assembled with fried eggplant, tomatoes, garlic, onions, and other seasoning. The consistency was not as thick or flavorful as the one at Flame International. However, the pronounced garlic flavor was a hit when added to the soft smoky pita. My only wish was for the eggplant flavor to stand out more. It was good, but not mind blowing.

The Lamb Shish-Kebab ($21) was put together with chunks of marinated lamb, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, and at my request, cherry rice ($4.50).  The lamb was tender and moist with full-on flavor. The cuts were chewy, but I could taste the saffron as the mix of cherry was delicious in the basmati. For the price, I wished there could be more cherries in the basmati, but the lamb made quite an impression. 

The Chicken Shish-Kebab ($17) arrived with charbroiled marinated chicken breast, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and choice of dill and lima beans rice ($4.5). The chicken came with tremendous wow factor: super moist, juicy, and flavorful. The dill and lima beans basmati was not overpowering, and instead the taste was complementary to the chicken.

The Cornish Hen Kebob ($17) was equally outstanding. This dish came with an entire Cornish Hen served bone-in, and each piece was evenly cooked to perfection to render a meaty juicy sensation. The cherry rice was again a hit. I will go the distance whenever I can find cherry rice. 

Lastly, the Salmon Kebob ($18.50) came with marinated salmon and basmati rice mixed with fresh garlic, dill weed, parsley & cilantro. The salmon was tender but slightly overdone. The rice had a smooth refined flaovr as a secondary to provide depth. I wasn't particularly blown away by this dish, especially since the previous dishes were really outstanding. Among them, I'm still partial to the Lamb and Chicken Kebob. 

Service was inconsistent, as my dining companion drank from a dirty glass without knowing it until the end of his meal. My second visit fared much better. The server was knowledgeable, friendly, highly attentive, and invited us to return. Here's one of the few legitimate places to grab Persian cuisine in this area. I'd be very interested in coming back to try the Persian Ice Cream, Baklava, and Zoombia & Bamieh.

I always get flyers in the mail for BJ's, but for whatever reason hadn't ever tried it until now. The inside appeared clean and I was greeted and helped right away. The menu had a good variety of options. I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered a "Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad" priced at $3.50 thinking it would be small for the price, but I was wrong! There was a fair mix of red onion, tomato, mozzarella, basil and it was topped with a balsamic dressing. I was impressed with the amount of mozzarella in it and it tasted fresh and good. My niece was with me and she chose priced at $4.95 a "Kids Pizza" from the kids menu. It was a 6 in deep dish cheese pizza topped with tomatoes. I scored a piece and it was good! I liked the thickness and flavor. The kids pizza also included a drink so it was a good deal and she was happy! 

They offer online ordering and you can go inside to pick it up or call the number on the sign in the designated parking when you arrive and they will bring it out to you. If you eat here often you might want to consider signing up for their rewards program.

Where to even BEGIN my review of this DUMP and the MINDLESS, BRAINWASHED, FOOLS who wait in line to catch a glimpse of NOTHING inside is the question.  

Not since "Pink's Hot Dogs" in Los Angeles, have I seen such a ridiculously long line of mindless, brainwashed, DONKEYS waiting to be disappointed!  Fools from all over the world who actually BELIEVE what they see on TV and are easily manipulated into thinking they are in for a treat by standing in line with other MORONS just like them!  Well let me pull the curtain back for all who are planning on coming to Las Vegas and hoping to catch a glimpse of the Pawn Stars cast members and believe they will be walking into a nice clean business that is filled with unique treasures and valuable items they have seen on TV.  After waiting in line for hours, and the curtain is finally pulled back, one will see NOTHING they are expecting!  And are sure to be disappointed!  But one will of course piss their money away on cheap souvenirs before walking out.....IDIOTS!

No cast members work here anymore (Except for shoot days), the place is a DUMP with S#@T for sale just thrown into their dirty display cases with no effort for neatness (Just as any educated person would expect from a pawn shop) but perhaps the best gag of all is the fact that this rat hole makes more money off selling their merchandising items to mindless tourists then by buying and selling items shown on Pawn Stars.  Some of the WORST merchandising items ever created from a TV series (i.e. cast member bobble heads, lame coins w/cast members faces on the, cheap low quality T-Shirts, and various other garbage that sophisticated people would never even consider buying!) P.T. Barnum said it best....."There is a sucker born every minute, and two to take 'em".....in this case, four to take 'em!!!!

Good luck trying to call these clowns, they NEVER answer the phones....not even sure why they still have phone lines, a waste of money if you ask me.  I tried calling them several times due to a rare poster I saw on the show that I wanted to buy.  Guess they are no longer in business to sell items (Except for their TV branded merchandise)

The donkey selling hot dogs outside to the brainwashed crowd, while it is a genius idea to take even further advantage of the long line of fools, I believe the cart is owned by a relative of the pawn shop owner (Go figure)  They also claim to sell "Vienna" hot dogs, which anyone that has been to Chicago knows, are the BEST dogs in the world.  But I highly doubt they are Vienna, my guess is they are Ball Park dogs bought in bulk at Costco and are only being passed off as authentic Vienna dogs.  The Vienna brand umbrella that is displayed above the cart was most likely pawned for pennies on the dollar from a customer years ago.  

Most of you, if not all of you reading this will most likely NOT take my advice of saving you time, money, and your high expectations, and will venture into the long line of waiting SUCKERS anyway.  While it is not my goal to UNBRAINWASH you, it is my goal to pull back the curtain and let you know in advance what to expect when you arrive at this DUMP with the rest of the donkeys.  

While I can't fault the owners of Gold & Silver Pawn for profiting off the success of their hit television show, I can fault them for poor customer service.  Not only do they NOT answer the phones, they also do not list any items of interest that were bough on the show, on their website.  However one can CERTAINLY buy their merchandising GARBAGE online!  It is clear Gold & Silver Pawn is no longer in the pawn business, they are in the retail business of selling themselves.  The only question left is.....how long will it last? Enjoy!

Out celebrating our friends 1 year wedding anniversary, I wanted a margarita. After checking out a few places we settled on this place. We stood forever at the hostess stand waiting to be seated. Finally a girl came over and took us to a table and gave us menus. Priced at $12.50 (regularly priced $17.50 when not on special) I ordered a strawberry "Margarita-by-the-Yard" and I couldn't taste any alcohol at all. Our friends couldn't taste any in theirs either, so we asked our server when she finally came back around if we could buy some shots to add to it. She said they are $1 per shot so I ordered 2 shots to add to mine. The margarita seemed like it was mostly ice and I just didn't care for it.

I figured with salsa being in the name of this place that we would get the standard complimentary chips and salsa, but nope! Chips and salsa cost here! I decided to just order a "Mexican Pizza" priced at $7.95 to munch on. It was a flour tortilla that had a crunch to it with pinto beans, cheese, salsa and sour cream. The beans weren't very warm and tasted bland. Honestly the fresh avocado was the only good part about it. Maybe if their margaritas actually gave people a buzz the food would taste better! 

Our server wasn't great about checking on us and slow with bringing out our drinks and food. She carded us when we ordered the drinks, but then carded our friend 2 more times and he didn't even order but one drink that he was already carded for. She seemed a bit spacey. I didn't mind the prices at all, but wasn't satisfied with my drink, food or the service we recieved. I can

Defalco's rates five stars for me because every dish on the menu that I have tried tastes fabulous. I found Defalco's the first week during my initial scouting trip to Arizona a few years ago.

After my first taste of their Chicken Parmigiana sandwich I was hooked. I love the meatball sandwich as well. But my favorite is definitely the Italian Sausage served with roasted green peppers and onions with the marinara sauce on the roll of your choice. Talk about foodie nirvana; The Italian Sausage sandwich does it for me.

I keep coming here because the food is excellent and the pricing is reasonable. One time my family members ordered half sandwiches of the same item and they gave us the full sandwich pricing which was a discount from half sandwich pricing. They didn't have to do that. But that's just one of the ways that they look out for their customers. This place gets really busy and it can be a challenge to find seating during the busy lunch and dinner hours.  They also have a thriving deli.

One of these days I've got to try the pizza.

The decor for this place was definitely the best part. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f1eeViD_rhRG4-MIFgZsEA

It was a nice day so we got seated on the terrace overlooking the Vegas strip.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=FR6MuipnPqtxwIo9BUVZHA

There are some hotties working up in here.  I kept drooling over one of the waiters.  He was Asian, built, slight scruff, and had tattoos on his right arm.  I wanted to order him and take him to go but he wasn't on the menu :(

Order:  Crab cake, mac and cheese, pomme frites, Croque madame, and shrimp cocktail.  For dessert we ordered the caramel tart and the chocolate terrine.  

Crab cake came served with a remoulade and topped with a frisee salad.  It was actually pretty good, nice and meaty with large chunks of crab, yet it was still crispy and held up.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=p_zZ9eP10crf4OoTMMPw-w

Shrimp Cocktail came with huge jumbo shrimp.  I'm not a big cold shrimp fan so it was just okay for me.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f0eXikNX8SVFSiTNYpvs2Q

Croque Madame is basically a ham and cheese sandwich topped with an egg.  I wouldn't order it.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=hz67b-rY5NF_D8MfoFhpyw

Mac and Cheese came out awesome looking, but upon further tasting it fell pretty flat.  It needed something to lighten it up and give it some flavor.  My friend squeezed some lemon on it and she said it made it a lot better.  They need to work out that recipe and give it some ooomph!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=xWVNfswLh_diFTC__WeVMg

The chocolate terrine was too dark for me.  I normally enjoy dark chocolate but this was a tad too bitter for me.  It just tasted like straight up cocoa powder.  I wouldn't order it again.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=LeYT8q4sUDeDQrM6-jxIeA

The caramel tart was really good, but the crust was super stiff and thick which normally I like :)  but not in a dessert.  Flavor-wise though, it was the better of the two.  It came with caramel ice cream and candied macadamian nuts and wafers.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=Uv9LtnwzyrTIZFS6DEGv3w

The waiter was cordial and accommodating.  He was telling us about life in Vegas because I was thinking about applying to schools there.  Overall, it was a nice relaxing meal.  There were highs and lows but pretty solid still.

In a word, Twist.  

The mere idea of the word is enough to send your token foodie's stomach into a conniption fit of pure desire.  The mere whisper of the word is enough to trigger endless blogging and tweeting due to sheer sweaty-handed anticipation.  The mere realization of the word is enough a road trip all the way to Lost Wages to see what all the fuss is about.  

And so it was done.  Off to the south Las Vegas strip we would go in search of langostine (among other things), prepared in the manner of a man who pretty much put langostine on the map.  

Being the gastronomic simpleton that I am, I decided I couldn't pass up a grand opening invite to the first ever dinner service at Twist by Pierre Gagnaire (December 5, 2009).  But in lieu of a ginormous appetite, what I really should've packed was my brain.  Food this complex, this multi-layered, and this (pardon my crude undertone) "weird", simply can't just be engulfed.  It requires several hours of thinking, ruminating, pondering or whatever-the-hell-it-takes to justify paying $400 a head for arguably one of the fanciest and most thought-out meal you'd ever dream of having this west of the Mississippi.  It's been days since engulfing this meal and I STILL can't wrap my head around it (and my stomach definitely had its work cut out for it too).

Surprisingly, it took nearly 5 hours to complete this marathon of a 6-course tasting menu plus 6 courses of added appetizer supplements (note: every single thing I ate is pictorially posted here).  And don't you dare go on thinking that I'm slow and that 12 courses aren't all that much, because under Pierre Gagniere's roof, that really means like 36 presentations.  Do the math.  

Throughout this marathon dinner complete with cocktails and fine wine, Voss water and a few $8 diet cokes sprinkled in "here and there", I began to realize the perplexity as this:  Pierre Gagnaire is, quite truthfully, an enigma of a man.  Forget that he's Michelin starred-this, iconoclastic-that.  Forget that he practically invented all that we have come to realize is "fusion" cuisine.  And just forget that his so-called eponymous "other" location on Rue. St. Balzac near the Champps Elysees is thought of as being the "3rd best restaurant" in the world by Restaurant Magazine (El Bulli in Spain is the 1st).

Pierre Gagnaire creates an inspiring vision for this type of weird food, which is, not surprisingly, just weirdly delicious.  He's even a lovable weird guy himself, so appropriately charming and entertaining us like a "crazy uncle" might do during his brief cameo at our table.

And as we were appropriately informed by our server David, the whole idea is to "taste and experience" all the ingredients which God put on this earth, which might occasionally occur in 1 singular dish.  This is most evident in the first of 3 presentations of Gagnaire's "Shellfish Royale" - somewhat of an oyster extravaganza with a backdrop of toasted beef gele and shallots, as well as his last presentation of "King Sea Bream", a curiously concoction of a "bonito-shellfish gele" with mozzarella ice cream.  I loved the fact seared scallops aren't even safe from Gagnaire's innovative antics as "black olive gelee" provides a certain Mediterranean setting, but then squab breast and foie gras come in to steal the show.  The end result of these seemingly contradictory flavor combinations and layers is this:  each bite resembles something that you have never ever tasted, with few ways to describe them, save for these vague examples --  My first time eating Pierre Gagnaire cuisine allowed me to taste 5 different representations of the langostine, including the unmistakable "head", allowed me to taste (and like) seafood mixed with cheese mixed with meat, and allowed me to eat something that tasted like the splendor that exists in a tidepool.  

Overall, do I have any idea what this means?  Not on your life.  The only thing I can muster up is that a dinner under Pierre Gagnaire's roof is absolutely positively unlike any other eating experience you will ever have.  Ever.  Go there, and you will see.  The originality of it ensures that you cannot and will not be disappointed.

This past January marked a year my wife stopped smoking cigarettes.  So imagine my surprise when the one thing she wanted to do to mark the occasion was to...smoke hookah??  I personally hadn't done that in well over 6+ years.  28 reviews and counting with consistent 5 star reviews lead us to Layla.

Although it's a small place that can cater to maybe 6 groups total, it's like a really cool guy's basement.  That really cool guy happens to also be named Guy.  He recognized my wife and I instantly since we lived in the same apartment complex a couple of years ago and had neighboring parking spots.  Throughout our visit, Guy was super friendly, attentive and made us feel very welcome.  The big leather couches you sit on INSIST that you stay a while.       

We were informed that all their food was homemade so trying the falafel and hummus appetizer was an absolute must for me.  Their falafel rivals any other joint as the best in LV, crunchy outside and flavorful green inside.  I could tell right away that the hummus was homemade.  It tasted more like a super thick tahini sauce than your average hummus but I thought it accompanied the falafel really well.  I'll be sure to get it again.  We also got an order of stuffed grape leaves and a nice basket of freshly toasted pita.  Guy also hooked us up with a couple of pieces of baklava which made for a nice ending to the meal.

Hookah time.  Lots of choices and my wife chose their "pina colada" which was fine and tasted as advertised.  3 bricks would have been enough for 4-6 people to smoke let alone two.

Count on me as a repeat customer!  At the very least I'll order their great Middle Eastern food to go since they're open so late or we'll lounge out the next time my wife has "the itch".

There are few places that I make a decision to NEVER step foot into again. Yasu has earned this dubious distinction from me. 

First, let me give you my background with sushi since this came into question from the manager himself. I have been eating sushi for about 11 years. Some really bad sushi, some amazing sushi. I have mentioned in previous reviews that I have had sushi fresh off a boat in Hawaii. While I don't claim to have had ALL the sushi in the world, I know what good sushi and what good sushi service is. 

Second, let me tell you that I have had omakase (chef's menu) in several locales, so I know what it entails. 

I was with a group of friends on my highly anticipated visit to Yasu Sushi Bistro. We had made a reservation and were seated immediately. We quickly decided to indulge in the omakase menu. We wanted the best that Yasu Sushi Bistro had to offer! I always say "Hit me with your best shot!" 

Well... if you have nothing to do, and aren't hungry...you should do the omakase menu. It took Thirty Minutes between courses. And please don't think we were given platters full of food. This is more like 2 small oysters per person, A plate of 1 shrimp, a couple slices of King Claim, a dollop of Spanish mackerel tartar on a bone chip.... So think tiny gourmet food. So think how hungry and irritated I was Two HOURS later. In a 3.5 hour visit, we had consumed Four tiny dishes. I really tried to be patient, but this is absurd and unacceptable! I finally asked for the check as we wanted to leave and go eat elsewhere. I expressed my displeasure at the slowness of the meal. 

Now before you Yasu lovers roll your eyes and shake your fingers at me. Let me put it in perspective. At ANY restaurant, it is unacceptable to be the first table to arrive, watch subsequent tables seated, and fed, and watch them leave and you're still waiting to be fed... you would be ticked off too. Now add to that a condescending manager who comes over to talk to you and asks if you have ever had an omakase experience before and tries to piss in your pocket and tell you that it's raining. Unacceptable. Now, add to that the restaurant sending out another dish after you had already asked for the check and then CHARGING you for that dish even though you said you didn't want the dish. 

I have nothing against the food, though it wasn't very imaginative on the SUSHI level. What killed the entire visit was the slowness of the courses, the response of the management, and the lack of ethical treatment in regards to the check. 

I will never visit Yasu Sushi again and I bet my stress level will be all the better for it.

I have never fully appreciated nouveau cuisine. It has always left me a little hungry and a few Benjamins short. LOL 

Our introduction to Cantina Laredo was somewhat inauspicious, since they misplaced our reservations on a busy Friday night.  

We also had the same experience with the hostesses that fellow Yelp'er Teehee wrote about.  But in end, we had a nice evening, with our bill coming in at the low end.  

After the confusion and a five minute wait, we were seated near the patio. It was a nice location and we had the added bonus of observing a pre-wedding family dinner of eighteen. 

Cantina Laredo likes to market itself as serving "modern Mexican food in a sophisticated, vibrant atmosphere. ... with a Mexico City style menu."  I believe it's more Mexican petite nouveau cuisine. 

We started off with a delivery of chips and two types of salsa. The milder version had a nice tomato base. But it was the spicier one, with fire roasted peppers that was the standout. It was complex and so delicious, that you could have eaten it with a spoon. 

Next was their table-side guacamole making called Top Shelf for $9.99. It was an exquisite. Now I make this all the time at home, yet it always seems tastier when someone else is doing it. LOL

Somewhere along the way our white honey sangria was dropped off. It was very good and fairly priced served in large 12 oz flute glass. Nice!

For dinner we decided to share two entrees. One was their Vera Cruz Enchiladas (photo), which was a nice mixture of spinach and chicken for $13.99; and the other was the Carnitas Tacos for $13.79.  The enchiladas had a nice flavor and kick. Both were very good, with the street tacos seeming deceptively small. 

The bill came to about $30 a person including drinks, but before taxes and gratuities. 

So Four Stars, and yes we are Fans of Cantina Laredo. While eating here might not get you a doggie bag for later, you will go home feeling as though you've enjoyed something special.  Remember to make reservations like we did! LOL

Imagine two college roommates, one an all-american kid raised on classic fast food fare, the other a Korean foreign exchange student with an overprotective mom preparing meals weekly from home, and then picture some pothead next door raiding their refrigerator one night and throwing their leftovers together in one massive pile for a meal of his own.  That may have been my first impression upon glancing at the menu, but after finishing my first meal here I am convinced this is the work of some evil mad culinary genius.       

Went and checked out this place over lunch with a friend and decided to sample their two most popular items: the #1 (Beef Buldogi hotdog)  and the Angry Kimchi Fries

The beef bulgogi dog is a 100% premium beef dog covered with an avalanche of Asian cole slaw, grilled onions, generous strips of beef bulgogi (marinated beef with Korean seasonings, finished off with a dusting of sesame seeds and a light drizzle of house mayo.   The first bite of any hot dog usually begins with a naked end devoid of bread or toppings, and one can tell that the Buldogi dog has been grilled to that perfect smokey char with a nice firm "snap" of the casing that explodes with mouthwatering flavor.  The contrast in textures and flavors from the tender bulgogi, crispy slaw, smokey onions, creamy mayo, and toasted sesame seeds surprisingly round out one another in harmonious balance.

The angry kimchi fries was a whole other beast.  Wheras the oxtail chili cheese fries at Bachi Burger look better than they taste, the Angry fries here taste better than they look.  Start with a bed of sweet potato fries, add a layer of pork bulgogi, throw in some cooked kimchi and melted cheese with diced green onion and jalapeno, and then finishing the whole concoction with a sunny side egg, I found myself unable to stop with each progressive bite since something so wrong apparently seemed so right!  There's a stroke of brilliance with the choice of sweet potato for the starch since the natural sugar cuts through all the spicy and savory components and the richness from the cheese and runny egg yolk cleverly binds all the distinct bold flavors together  (pro-tip: break the yolk immediately upon being served otherwise the heat from the other ingredients will continue to cook the egg)

If I had one minor critique, it would be the lack of beer and the ambience inside is a bit drab since I think the food has heavy flavors that go well with beer in the company of friends with a sporting event in the background since I would totally attend any stadium or ballpark which served these items.    It looks like they may have attempted to expand previously but the other location appears closed on yelp, but hopefully their following will grow to be successful on a repeat attempt in the future.

"Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights"

I know this song is a little old, but I hope you get the picture.  I heard good things from my Vegas promoter friends at Galavantier, but not so good things from a personal friend, so I said WTH!!!  I am always game to check out a new club in Vegas!!!

Light is located towards the rear of the Mandalay Bay Hotel.  I believe there used to be another club here, but I forget the name because I rarely venture away from the strip (Mandalay is pretty far south for me!).  We bypassed GP (general population) via Galavantier (please see my review).  It was well worth the extra $.  We heard peeps wait 3 hours to get in this club.  FTS!!! (F*ck That $hit!!!).

Krewella was playing the Fri night we went, and the standard Cirque du Soleil show was entertaining.  However, not as entertaining as the talent!!!  There were many fine looking ladies that my friend and I would have loved to meet given the opportunity.  We had nearly given up when we met a pair of Azn ladies at the bar.  I don't usually talk to Azn ladies much (primarily because they rarely talk to me, and I had a bad experience recently w/ two Azn ladies:  They were the wrong kinda F's:  Fliar [F*cking Liar] & a Flake [Fulla Lame A$$ Kine Excuses]).  But these Azn ladies were the right kinda F's:   Fwhiiiiine, Friendly & Fun!!!  The one I liked had a shoulder piece tattoo and I complimented her on her artwork.  She asked me if I had any work, so I showed her a pic of my shoulder piece, half sleeve and chest plate.  She liked my work so much that she asked me to open up my buttons to see.  I am not usually an exhibitionist, but we weren't getting any love so I threw caution to the wind and said OK!!!  At this point in time I was waiting for her to tell me she was a pro, and she cost $$$ much, but it never happened.  Turns out these women were the good kind of pros:  "Professionals" just like us, who love to party and to top it off they were from LA!!!

We spent the rest of the evening with these ladies because they were not ratchets (we bought each other drinks at their insistence), and they could carry on intelligent conversations.  Afterwards, we grabbed an early morning breakfast.  Lastly, we also agreed to meet up in LA soon.  I guess I should stop being so judgmental of Azn ladies.  These hawt Azn ladies helped me see the "Light"! - LMAO!!!

Pizzeria Bianco isn't just a restaurant, it's an institution.  Ever since I moved to the Valley of the Sun five years ago, I've watched peoples' eyes glaze over as they ramble on and on about how amazing the food is there; many argue that it serves up the best pizza in Phoenix (if not the country).  Why it took me so long to get there is a mystery but after going today, I can unequivocally say that the rumors are all true - it is fabulous!

LOGISTICS: Nestled in the Southeast corner of Heritage Square near the Arizona Science Center, Pizzeria Bianco sits in a rather small brick building with an outdoor patio and charming little bar.  While the space restriction makes for a more intimate dining experience, I could easily see this place becoming swarmed with diners during peak hours; so perhaps coming before or after the main lunch/dinner rush would be a good idea for those who are patience-challenged or in a time crunch.  Park in the structure off of 5th and Monroe - the restaurant validates your ticket (I ended up paying $0 instead of the usual $12).  

FOOD: Wow!  Just wow!  I ordered the Market Salad, which consisted of fresh local cantaloupe and honeydew melon, cucumbers, mint, red onions, and peppers served in a yogurt dressing; it was hands-down one of the most creative and refreshing salads I've ever had!  They serve their sodas in old fashioned glass bottles and bring freshly-baked bread with olive oil to your table - haven't had olive oil that good in ages!  If you can't decide on one pizza combo, they're great about doing halfsies.  I ordered a half Margherita, half Rosa (red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, and Arizona pistachios) pizza - both were sheer perfection!  Crust is heavenly, ingredients are beyond fresh, innovative toppings - who'dve thunk pistachios would taste so good on a pizza?!      

SERVICE: Pizzeria Bianco runs like a well-oiled machine.  The service staff is amazing - both friendly and fast.  They greet every single guest who comes and goes - pretty impressive! 

I don't really think you can go wrong here.  I came in skeptical but left a believer; somehow they worked their magic over on me - another happy Pizzeria Bianco customer.  A thousand flies can't be wrong!  ;)

So long Pink's, hello The Wiener's Circle! I was sad to see Pink's go, but the location was never going to work with the jacked up prices and confusion with the names they gave the hot dogs compared to what they are actually called at the original location in California. So, The Wiener's Circle enters in its spot. Will it last? Time will tell! I must admit, I did watch the TV show they had on a while back and found the games they played with the customers (at night they curse at the customers and play crazy ass games... It's intended, expected to all customers and hilarious) funny. I was surprised they opened up in Vegas, but hey it saved me the trip to Chicago for the moment! The original location in Chicago has been in business for over 30 years.

Looking over the menu board, I was surprised at how fair the prices were. The prices here range from about $2-$3 higher depending on the item compared to the Chicago menu. Being in a casino we can expect higher prices, but they weren't too outrageous. I ordered "Wieners in a Blanket" priced at $4.99 for 6. They are made fresh to order. I had my choice of sauce and chose honey mustard. That honey mustard had a real good flavor and paired nicely with the tasty blanketed wieners. They also come 12 to a order, but the 6 was good enough for me. Priced at $4.99 I also ordered "Cheddar Fries" and wow were they good! The fries are fresh cut and come 1 pound per order. The cheese they put on top was very good! Hubby and I split a "Char Polish" priced at $6.99 and came with mustard, relish, onions, pickle, tomato, celery salt and sport peppers. It was pretty good. Next time I would ask for a lighter char, but a decent hot dog with nice toppings. All the burgers and dogs come with those toppings unless you tell them to leave it off. They are happy to customize your order so just ask! If you are in a pinch for time you can phone your order ahead and just pick it up. Aside from lunch and dinner they also serve breakfast and offer Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

Pellini is a solid Four Stars.

After reading Ryan J's post on Yelp's "Near You" section online, I walked across the street to have a late lunch.  I arrived around 2:30 and there was less than a dozen or so diners, both inside and out. Apparently at lunch time, they had a line two deep outside. This was after being open to the public for three and half weeks.  A good gauge as any for a new restaurant.

Like Ryan, my first impressions are pretty positive.  The concept if you will, is an Italian version of Chipotle.  I'm not sure if the owners would agree, but here are your big three choices.

First, you could start with a Pellini.  What they say is a classic Italian Piadina.  A sort of Italian flat bread (think tortilla) that you can stuff with meat, veggies, cheese and dressing.

Or, you could have a Pasta Bowl with an angel hair base, then the grilled meats, veggies and cheese.

Lastly, you could have a Salad Bowl, again with all of the above added on.  Got it?

The meats range from two types of chicken (breaded chicken breast or grilled), steak florentine with olive oil and garlic, italian sausage, scrimp scampi, salmon with rosemary and lemon zest, or you could just go Vegan.  

The prices range from $6.55, up to $7.95 for the two fish entrees.  At this point, you can add from nearly two dozen ingredients, like artichoke hearts, pancetta, grilled eggplant, arugula, et cetera.

I had the Pellini with grilled chicken with spicy marinara (Arrabiata) and various veggies.  It was very good (photo) and filling.  

I had a chance to meet two of the managers and they were very excited on how they have been received with very little marketing.  I understand this is their first restaurant in the concept and are looking at other locations in the valley.

Pellini offers free WiFi and they have an Italian radio station playing music in the background for ambience. 

Enjoy!

Many Las Vegans have declared that pursuing authentic Taiwanese food in this town is like finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. My ever-growing curiosity in this uniquely ethnic cuisine, as well as guidance from people who are knowledgeable about this food has led me to Noodle Pot. I can say, without a shadow of doubt, that this establishment has superseded  my expectations!

Following a brief stop at the Shavery, I ran into Will (a.k.a. the artist formerly known as SnowFlake), along with a couple of Yelper's, and we decided to go to Noodle Pot. I have driven past this joint many times without thinking twice to stop in. It was a startling revelation to learn that, according to Will, Noodle Pot has some truly legitimate  Taiwanese grub in Vegas. Most notably, I wanted to try the national dish of Taiwan, spicy beef noodle soup.

I admire extraordinary mom-and-pop, hole-in-the-wall resto's, and Noodle Pot fits the bill to a tee. The comfortable yet lively vibe keeps the interaction going. After the server sat us down, we ordered some appetizers along with the spicy beef noodle soup.

Cold Vegetable Appetizer Plate - The first time I ordered this it came with pickled cucumbers and other vegetables, and wheat gluten. The cucumbers were marvelous, with the correct amount of saltiness to harmonize with the sweetness used in the sauce. The wheat gluten was another smash hit. It tasted incredibly akin to a concoction of beef and chicken. 

(Note: Coming here on a separate visit, and ordering this dish again, they had replaced the wheat gluten with soy sauce hard-boiled eggs. I notably did not enjoy them, and I was not too confident to which tree the egg grows on, but that's just me ((hehe)).

Pork and Chive Dumplings - Another sublime feature! The dumpling wrappers tasted hand made, and the filling inside was outstanding with perfectly tender pork matching the bright flavor of the chives. The vinegary soy sauce dip was the icing on the cake.

Beef Roll - My least favorite item, but pretty splendid nonetheless. Slices of beef and cilantro wrapped around a thin crepe. I actually prefer other Chinese versions that use a thicker, flakier scallion pancake in which the inside is coated with hoisin sauce. But, it was delish.

Spicy Beef Noodle Soup - the "Pice de rsistance" to our meal. We opted for the wide noodles instead of the regular noodles (think of it as thicker version of pappardelle). The noodles were perceived as if they were hand made and hand pulled, even though they probably came from a special noodle factory. The broth was nuts! It was packed with beef flavor, but exceptionally delicate. Hints of tomato added depth. Large portions of tender beef dotted the soup. Also, if the server has not brought out the chopped pickled cilantro, ask for it. That combined with the baby bok choy in the soup will give the dish a marvelous variation!

Many have mentioned this before, but I will proclaim it again. CASH ONLY!!! Save the plastic for the surgeon's table! :D

(Another side note: I took my brother here when he visited and at the time they had run out of beef so we opted for the Spicy Beef Tendon Soup. Even though I was fine, my brother returned home and had the hershey squirts for the next few days. The soup comes with a tremendous amount of tendons, so if you are not used to eating lots of offal or weird animal bits, I would be cautious when ordering this version).

Located by registration and the neighboring crystals wing of the expansive Aria resort, this unassuming contemporary restaurant had me intrigued as soon as I stepped inside. 

As we traversed through the dimly lit bar flanked with purple hued impressionist walled paintings that soared up to the high ceilings and into the main dining area, I couldn't help but be impressed by the sleek modern club-like feel of the space. It was the perfect mix of contemporary cool with traditional elegance. With chilled house music pulsating in the background, I did get an ultra lounge vibe from the restaurant, which was actually refreshing and relaxing. We also didn't feel crammed next to our neighboring diners, which made things feel much more intimate and private.

Our server was full of friendly banter and made every effort to make us feel welcome.  

We all went with the Signature Tasting Menu.  The wait staff knew that we were heading out to a show afterwards so they made sure our dishes came out at a good pace. 

We were started with a tuna tartare amuse bouche that was just the right mouthful of tang & punch of flavor to whet our appetites.

The first courses were all very good. From the fresh oysters to the beautifully prepared wagyu beef tartare to the exceptionally inventive foie gras brle.

The second courses were inspiring and enjoyable, as well. The octopus was grilled to perfection and the dayboat scallops were easily the best I've ever had! These thick golden medallions were beautifully seared on the outside locking in a fluffy and buttery flesh that left me in complete awe bite after bite.

Our third courses were also winners in my book.  The wagyu sirloin was mouthwatering and each tender bite was blissful. The 48 hour braised beef was incredibly soft and you could tell it was cooked for awhile for all those rich, permeating flavors to develop.

Desserts were exquisite and what could be better than a surprise at the very end! A shot of cinnamon hot white chocolate. It was both warm comforting and festive. An excellent end to an amazing meal. 

I can't say enough about my wonderful experience here. It's definitely one I'd gladly experience again and again.

Happy Eats!

I decided to check out Commonwealth for its opening weekend and I'm glad I did- this place is amazing!  Located in Fremont East right next to Le Thai, locals have another bar they can hop to during the course of the evening.

Get your ass inside and find a beautiful, expansive space with plenty of seating.  Admire the art and lighting while enjoying a craft beer or fancy cocktail.  Or, better yet, admire the beautiful bartenders pouring your drinks.  I was thoroughly digging on the boys in suspenders.

There is also an outdoor patio area upstairs if you want to smoke or enjoy the view of Downtown.  I believe there is another bar up there as well.

To get an idea for drink prices, my husband ordered a draft beer (Alley Cat Amber, which was really good) and I had a well drink.  They came out to be about $7 a piece.  Someone next to us ordered a sidecar (that looked yummy) and theirs was $9.

The crowd was diverse and included hipsters, cool kids, and quite a few guys dressed in suits.  Everyone was friendly and enjoying their time at Commonwealth.  Someone even bought the bar a round of shots (before it got too crowded, of course).  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the crowd stays the way it is and doesn't get overrun with bros.

We got in around 9:00 or 9:30 (on a Saturday) and it wasn't too busy and we were able to find a seat at the bar.  An hour later, however, was a completely different story.  There were wall-to-wall people and standing room only.  Depending on if you want to just chill or you're out to mingle, you should keep this in mind.

What made me fall in love with this place so much?  Was it the gorgeous atmosphere?  Was it the friendly crowd and staff?  Was it because they stole my iPod to create their music playlist?  Maybe it was just the cute boys in suspenders?  Well, whatever it was made me fall pretty hard for Commonwealth and I'm anxiously awaiting our next date.

***I was disappointed with O; it could just be that I am not a big fan of Cirque du Soleil shows, but I felt this one had quite a few boring parts and it was expensive (but understandable considering its popularity); there were definitely some great spectacle moments, but not enough for me to truly enjoy this one***

The first Cirque du Soleil show I saw was Ka and after having seen Mystere and O since then, I think Cirque du Soleil is not for me.  I liked Ka though I thought it was a little slow in parts and did not have much in terms of high flying acrobatics.  Mystere had more acrobatics, but it had no story (only a series of vignettes) and it just kind of meandered and did not have the spectacle of Ka.  O is kind of like a cross between Ka and Mystere.  It has the spectacle of Ka and the disjointed series of vignettes with no story of Mystere.

The signature element of O is the water, of course.  It is nicely done, but it does get repetitive with all of the synchornized swimming.  They do a lot of nice diving elements including some very high dives that is impressive.

Despite the uniqueness of using water (which definitely goes well with Bellagio given their fountain show), I actually preferred the stage at Ka more.  I found that much more interesting and that along with some stylized touches and uses of curtains and lights made Ka feel much more cinematic.

Ka also had a storyline.  While it was not a great story, it did connect the scenes fairly well.  With O, there is no story.  It is much more like Mystere where there are just a series of acrobatic vignettes including mini-sections with clowns (while I did not love the lightly comedic clown elements of Mystere, I thought they were better than the clowns at O--the scenes were slow, uninteresting and not funny).

While there was no storyline, I think they could have done a better job of tying the vignettes together given the underlying connection of water.  There was not really an embracing of the water.  There were horses, a safari landscape and men dressed in long red coats and white wigs (they seemed to come from a different show all together).  There was even a maid, who pushed a laundry cart, and picked up the clothes (left thrown on the floor after a performer clothing change on-stage); pushing the cart was kind of all she did (I did not get that one; for all I know, Bellagio housekeeping could have just accidentally wandered onto the set).

I think more ocean-themed vignettes would have tied everything together though it could have potentially resulted in cheesiness if not done right.

Still, there were bright spots.  The first trapeze vignette, high above the water, was really interesting and I have not seen a trapeze act quite like the one at O.  It created kind of a nervous and exciting anticipation that was truly special.  The diving was good.  It did get a little repetitive, but there were some great dives--both from high up as well as exciting moments where divers were launched across the stage like rockets).

The arena was beautiful.  There was a greatly lit blue dome above seating and the opening and closing of the red curtain was nicely and very interestingly done.  Seating was comfortable too.

Ticket prices are expensive.  Because of O's popularity, it is hard to find discounted prices for O.  You could probably find similar tickets for Ka at maybe half the price and even less for Mystere.

O might be the most iconic show on The Strip so it is definitely one to consider if you are traveling to Las Vegas for the first time or are a big Cirque du Soleil fan.  If you are not a big Cirque fan or have never been to one of their shows, I would suggest seeing one of their more price friendly shows like Ka or Mystere first to see if this is the type of entertainment you really enjoy before paying the high prices for O.

Like other Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free and self parking.

Protip: BUY the groupon!! 1 admission for $12; 2-people admission for $21; and 4-people admission for $42 as of 2/24/2014. Yes, it gets cheaper if you buy more. There is almost always a groupon going on for this place! Always check!! Beats paying $20 per person there. 

*ALSO* if you buy a groupon for 4 people, but you just want to go by yourself/just with one other person, they will write a coupon card with the remainder! This way you can use your remaining groupon visits each time you come in with the card! So go with a friend or by yourself, they're accommodating for whichever groupon you purchase!

This is a korean spa tucked away on Sahara and Maryland. Not visible from the major streets. Ample parking.

I absolutely adore this place! You walk in, pay, and you're free to enjoy the saunas or pay extra for their facials/other spa services they offer. If you've never been to an asian sauna, (I know I was confused) here's some helpful step-by-step tips:

FIRST: After paying, they hand you a waterproof wristlet key for your locker; towels; baggy T-shirt + pants to change into for sauna. There's also disposable razor blades. Feel free to ask for extra towels and slippers! Some of the room floors are HOT. Trust. 
Go to your gender segregated room; take off your street shoes please!! Look for your real locker after the tiny shoe lockers. Deposit your stuff and bring any bath stuffs. Undress completely. Yes, it's one of those spas. You're nude. Get used to seeing other nude people as well. Haha.

If you're body-shy, wrap yourself with your itty-bitty towel. Head to the shower place room past the lounge area with the sinks/mirrors. There's rows of showerheads/mirrors along with generic shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispenser in case you didn't bring your own tote. Pull up a stool and have fun manipulating the temperature. To get a hotter water temperature, just know there is a red button to push in as you slide it toward you. It's a safety measure. Can you say unlimited hot shower?!

After, you can enjoy their 2 hot bath pools or their cool temp pool. Please don't go in without scrubbing/washing yourself proper! You're meant to go in nude for sanitation purposes. There's a dry sauna in this room as well.

Head back to your locker and change to your baggy T-shirt and pants. As you're barefoot, marvel at how clean everything is or just wear the slippers you asked for at the front desk. Head upstairs for the co-ed saunas now! 

There's a caf, lounge area with korean TV playing, and the sauna rooms. 

ROOMS: The clay ball room has giant tubs filled with tiny clay balls that are HOT as you get in. It is a bit noisy as you get in and out. Careful not to slip when you get out! 

The jade room is a room with large mats. Lie down with a friend, plug in your headphones, relax to the herbal-infused air here.

There's a water dispenser where the food bar is. Be sure to drink plenty of cold water!! Plenty of fluids are lost when you're sweating this much.

The red clay room is one of faves as well. Be warned, the floors are searingly hot as you step in. Clean house sandals/flip-flops are the way to go! The red domes each have a mat and a light control switch in there. It doesn't get too bright though. My friends and I play card games crammed in one dome haha. Easily the hottest room, sure to sweat your heart out. 

*Look for the wi-fi password listed outside this room!*

FOOD: The caf does have pricey food. I believe it comes with banchan (multiple korean side dishes like kimchi) with whatever meal you order. We normally get the hard-boiled eggs ($1 each) and the delicious sweet rice drink. Super refreshing. Hand them your key # and you pay when you return your key at the front desk.

One of my favorite rooms is the frozen room. Small. Feels like sitting in a mcdonald's freezer, only without the gross frozen McRibs and the self-loathing. Very nice change of pace from sweating.

After all that sweat, it's a good idea to head back downstairs, strip again (throw your sauna clothes in one of the large chutes), and take another shower. They also have standing showers at one end if you want a lighter shower. 

AMBIANCE: it's never super crowded whenever I go, especially during the weekdays. Very soothing. Quiet normally. 

Have a hangover? Stressed out? Come here. It's fun to go with friends. It's slightly awkward being naked around each other at first, but it's also a great place to bond, hang out, and have a girls' day. You know it's love when a friend scrubs your back! Also a fun date idea. My skin always feels amazing when I leave. Super affordable, fun, and a great experience! Absolutely my favorite place to detox and relax.

(Impression mainly from soft opening)

Note: You should love the noble piglet! Pork and pork based items dominates ~96% of their non-beverage menu.

There has been a lot of buzz regarding the opening of Hiromaru Fusion Ramen since the Ramen Festival at the Rio last year. And finally they are opened for business! Excited!!!

What I love about this type of ramen restaurants is the fact that their menu is so simple and straightforward. Just four (4) ramen to select from, and whether to upgrade some add-ons to the ramen (extra Chashu, roasted seaweed and even cheese!), or side orders of Gyoza, Chashu Pork Bowl, Karaage, Curry and Hiromaru Buns. None of that 150 menu items from your typical Chinese American Take-Out restaurants, or the 10 page menus at older American diners. Essentially their laser focus attention to making what few items they have on their menu to the highest degree of expertise their kitchen crew can mustered on a daily basis is what I admire. 

So here is what you can order from their 1 page menu:

Carbonara Ramen ($10.95) - the chef's signature fusion ramen inspired by the Italian Carbonara pasta. The soup base consist of Tonkotsu pork broth and milk (expect watery broth and not thick traditional Carbonara pasta sauce). It is topped with still runny egg yolk, bacon, Shio and fresh scallions, resulting in a beautiful presentation of yummy ramenness.  Flat thick noodle is served with this bowl of ramen, I assume to better grip the creamy fusion ramen broth, but eating this without making any unintentional splashes is very difficult. If you can manage that difficult task, mad props to you Ninja!

Shiroi Tonkotsu ($7.95) - according to the Chef and the menu, "the best salted ramen is created with salted sauce and brown garlic oil."  I have not heard or read otherwise, so I shall defer to the ramen expert on this one. This most traditional of the 4 ramen options is served with Tonkotsu pork broth with salted sauce. Chashu pork, hard boiled egg, fresh scallions and Kikurage tops thin ramen noodles to complete this entree. The soup is delicious (at my limit for how salty I like my ramen broth), but I prefer slightly thicker and chewier ramen.

Kuroi Tonkotsu ($8.95) - this is a special salted ramen made with Chef Kawai's master's secret "Ma-Yu" (black garlic oil) recipe.  It is essentially the Shiroi Tonkotsu with the special ma-yu.

Tate-Yama Ramen ($9.95) - easily the tallest ramen you can order from the menu, which is inspired by the largest mountain in Chef Kawai's home prefecture. The double portion of thick ramen (aka Kaedama) and mounds of vegetables (bean sprouts & cabbage), is served with a soy sauce base + salted sauce and baby-backbone fat, Chasu, hard-boiled egg.

The typical ramen-ya side dishes are available for ordering and some. The Hiromaru Buns (steamed buns + Butabara pork belly in original Hiromaru sauce) sounds amazing and tasted as good as it looks! The Japanese mayo with the lettuce was an interesting creamy touch.  Chicken Karaage was fried nicely, but still moist inside and is perfect as is or with a light squeeze of lemon.

No alcohol is served, at least not now, but sodas and teas and bottled water are available to help lower the sodium concentration is your stomach.

The decor is simple and modern, they really did a great job renovating the space vacated by Cafe de Japon. Even the large "private" room off to the side looks nice and inviting, and ready to accommodate patrons.

Fast service, yummy food and attentive staff, so far so good! Ramen portion is average or slightly smaller, I can do 2 bowls for sure, maybe 3 bowls when I am in beast mode. So the 2x ramen noodle option at the time you place your order is recommended if you frequent food eating contests.

5 ramen spoons outta 5.

What to write for my 1600th review?

Sometimes, sage sayings can be contradictory. For example, the definition of intelligence is sometimes given as the ability to learn from one's past mistakes but it is also said that the definition of stupidity is repeating the same action again and again and expecting a different outcome!

With certain honourable exceptions such as Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley, I tend to be wary of restaurants in hotels, regarding them as traps for hotel guests too lazy to leave the hotel in search of a top notch meal

However, when I booked to watch Ka at the MGM Grand, I was intrigued by the omakase tasting menu at Shibuya, the Japanese restaurant located in their restaurant row. With a line-up of ingredients including toro, wagyu, foie gras and lobster, it looked very promising though I knew that it would take a first rate Japanese meal to satisfy me as I was also dining at another local Japanese legend in Vegas and favourite amongst Yelpers on the same trip - Raku (http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/raku-las-vegas#hrid:kQccGZ8GEw6cqZNBUqkwpQ)

I made my reservation via the hotel website and the only wrinkle in the evening was that my table wasn't ready at the time I booked

The restaurant is gargantuan, a definite contrast to the intimate Raku but I did appreciate the stylish surroundungs. There was a Vegas buzz of excitement to the place and despite the size of the operation, my food arrived quickly but the meal was well paced

1. Amuse of Kushi Oyster with Apple Momiji and Orange Ponzu
I usually like my oysters freshly shucked, briney and metallic from the sea but here, the citrus notes did enhance the meaty oyster

2. Trio of hamachi
This delicate fish was served in different preparations. Firstly as a sashimi with a hint of garlic, ginger and pepper. Then a tartar where the minced fish was mixed in with tobiko and garlic-infused ponzu. Lastly again as sashimi with wasabi, wasabi oil and Hawaiian red salt. A lovely contrast of 3 preparations

3. Sashimi duo
My first slice of sashimi was one of my favourite fish - chu toro (fatty part of the tuna belly), served with ginger soy sauce and spiced crunchy garlic. The other piece was kanpachi, yuzu juice and black truffle oil. Yummy sashimi

4. Tataki of Australian wagyu beef, lemon tamari soy, tarragon oil and garlic chips
The beef was almost sweet with freshness and the lemon lifted it with the nice contrast of crunchy garlic chips

5. Ezi Ebi
If I tell you that this dish was Australian lobster tail and day boat scallops in uni sake butter sauce and that it tasted every bit as magnificent as it sounds, I think I can rest my case

6. Niku
Braised Kobe-style short rib was served with sauted foie gras and rounded off with sweet and spicy soy. The meat was meltingly tender and the sauce wasn't over-sweet. The umami hit from the foie gras was heavenly as usual

7. Maine Lobster Miso Soup, Green Onions, Shitake Mushrooms
No ordinary soup as you can tell from the ingredients!

8. Nigiri with freshly grated wasabi root

9. Dessert Tasting
Raspberry-Yuzu calpico pannacotta, choco-lychee mousse cake, and mochi ice cream proved a tasty, sweet and surprisingly light end to a magnificent meal

As you can tell just from reading the review (until Yelp invents smell-o-vision or taste-o-vision, I'm afraid my photos will have to do with helping me enhance my words), this was a legendary meal. Top class ingredients were treated sympahetically and allowed to sing with complementary sidekicks that enhanced and not take over. Recognisably Japanese but with a nod to western ingredients

As for restaurants in hotels, I'm very happy to eat my words provided the words are as delicious as the food at Shibuya!

The Cheesesteaks here are now the best I've had in town! There was a flyer put on my door earlier in the week from this place and it sounded good so hubby and I gave this place a try. Hubby actually ordered a "Original Cheesesteak" with cheese whiz, onions and peppers, but I ended up eating almost half of it. I just loved the flavor and enjoyed every bite! The sandwich was 10 inches long and stuffed with thinly shaved beef. We shared a order of "Mozzarella Sticks" priced at $7 and they were cheesy. Each one had their own unique shape as they are hand breaded to order. Be prepared for lots and lots of oozing cheese with these! I do wish the breading had more flavor, but they are totally worth ordering. I ordered a "Italian White Pie" priced at $16.50 and it was 14 inches. The pizza had mozzarella, ricotta, sausage, broccoli rabe, garlic and caramelized onions. I liked the pizza, but it actually tasted much better re-heated the next day for lunch. The guy who took our order and gave us our food was nice. I'd like to come back and try some of their other pizzas, sandwiches, salads and of course I will be back for more cheesesteak! 

Delivery is offered. Check the website to see if you are in the delivery area. They have different lunch specials daily.

After living here 10 years I figure I have seen enough to have something to say.

What started as a rural community with a few subdisions and of course the toursist attraction of a street full of casinos & hotels. The Strip.

Then it was NightClubs,StripClubs,MegaRessorts, and World Class Dining & Entertainment.

This place has morphed into a Metropolis with freeways criss-crossing the city and MegaResorts, Supermalls, neighborhood strip malls and neighborhood casinos suburban communities like Summerlin, Del Webb, Lone Mountain, and all the subdiviisions.

Houses were built by the 1000's overnight with imported labor. Population went from 60K to over 300K in less than 5 years.

WHat happend?

Schools are 48th in the country which is BAD.Huge class sizes, very underqualified teachers and lots of non-english speaking.40% high school drop out rate!!

Healthcare is non-existant-UMC the county hospital receycled needles spreading Hepatitis last year.Plus nurse shortages.

Courts, County Commission, Mayor and other Governemnt Offcials are corrupt as they come.-The mayor is a former mob attorney. County officials have been indicted & convicted of many crimes, Judges & lawyers arrested regularly. Its madness

Parks & Recreation is where we actually exceed expectations. Theres lots of parks and stuff to do without having to gamble.Lots of sporting events for the kids.

Jobs-Well pay is relatively low unless you are in a high tip paying job or a stripper or something illegal.
Most jobs on the Strip require a Sherrifs Card which cost you $40-$50 and requires a background check and fingerprinting at the police station.
Some jobs also require a Health Card for food handling etc, this requires you to go to the hospital and get a TB shot and watch a video some people have to get other shots too.
Then there the TAM card-Tobacco & Alcohol Managemnt-waitresses,bartenders,clerks and lots more have to get this card which requires a class & test to complete. Plus it cost you $80-#$00.

Food & Entertainment.-Well everyone knows about the Fancy Chefs and all their Fancy restaurants on the Strip but Las VEgas is filled with culinary delights. Many people relocate here and bring their own cuisine and styles.

There's tons of community events for familys and Vegas knows how to throw a party. The big Holidays are always loaded with tourists  but you kind find many intimate events throughout the year.

Lots of quality librarys and other resources.


Casinos have been allowed to build in residential neighborhoods so now nearly every neighborhood has a casino of some kind which is nice if you like $2.99 breakfast & other thinngs casinos offer.

The bus system has added the Duece to its fleet making ir a little better but its still a little slow. The monorail has been erected but not completed. It seems it would be a better beenfit going to & from the airport to the strip.

Many of the traditional casinos had been imploded & new ones bigger & brighter and more expensive have been built in their place. Condos on the strip have become a reality and even Trump has come to town.

Our XFL Football team came & went. We have lots of sporting events and concerts to attend and at reasonable prices.No real chance of ever getting a PRO sports team..

Las Vegas is hot & sunny 300 days a year and for some a little too hot but we adapt and learn to beat the heat.

We have pools in our backyards all hotels and apartments have them too. Lake Mead & Hoover Dam is just a drive to the water even though its been less than impressive over the years.

It's pricy to live in the city but you have everything you need right in the neighborhood, lots of great finds & deals around, usually plenty of jobs to go around and there's always a little luck.

You can take a vacation just by going down the strip or downtown , theres always something new & exciting. Learning to use the comp system at the casinos makes living in Vegas so much funner.

Prostituion may not be legal but there's plenty of Escorts for you and Marijuana has been decriminalized so the cops don't fuck with you plus the quality has gotten alot better with all the legal supply in California nearby.I love this place all you can eat munchies for under $10 everyday!!

"That's all you need to know, right there, " she said, pointing up behind her head at a framed plackard from local news affiliate CBS 5 Dean's List.  
It was dated from like 1996, or 2003, or something like that, I can't remember, but it wasn't very recent.
"What's that got to do with Customer Service?" I asked, completely perplexed.  
I was just trying to tell her that I've had the same thing happen here twice now in two visits, where she is attending to personal business instead of her customer, ie me.  
"Go on. (waving towards the door)  We been here 17 years.  We don't need YOU."
"You haven't even listened to me.  I'm going to have to tell somebody about this."
"I don't care.  I dont need to listen.  I'M the owner. Go." (she starts pacing back and forth behind the counter, like a caged animal or a person about to get in a fight)
"You're the ONLY owner?  So you're saying your PARENTS work for YOU?  Here, and down the street at BurgerMania?"
"I'm the owner.   I don't care."

A customer standing next to me, who's already received her order but has been waiting the entire time, come to find out, for Mrs. Rude to scoop her an ice cream cone, chimes in with, "I don't think she WANTS to listen to you."

You think?!    


Moments earlier, I'd stood at the counter ready to order, while she was digging red plastic baskets out of one of the trash containers in the lobby.  She saw me, and proceeded to continue what she was doing without acknowledging me, for a few more moments.

Then she comes around the counter  -- no hand washing -- and proceeds to take my order.  
$7.03 ... hand her my card, she swipes it but doesn't press any buttons on the card machine or the cash register.  
~
On her phone laying on the counter, she continues the texting she originally started while taking my order.
~
It's taking forever, and she keeps going back and forth between the credit card reading machine and her phone laying on the counter.
     -a few buttons pressed over here, -a few buttons pressed over there
Finally, I say "Forget it, this is the second time you've done something like this to me recently, and it's not acceptable to me.  I'm taking my business elsewhere."  
"I WAS WAITING FOR THE MACHINE! "  she lamely attempts to defend.
"You were on the phone instead of doing what you should have been doing."
"Go ahead.  I don't care.  That's all you need to know right there."

.......and now you're up to date, back at the top of the review.

WAIT!  I forgot to tell you about what happened last time:

I go for a late lunch, and I'm after a Falafel sandwich, easy enough.
Into a near empty dining room walks your humble narrator, and there's no one waiting in line at all, since it's 1 ish already.  
A single patron is waiting at the counter for his food, engaged in personal conversation with our villain, Mrs Rude.

As I stand patiently behind Chatty Customer Man, Mrs Rude makes no effort to wrap it up or otherwise acknowledge me as a waiting customer, despite having already made indisputable eye contact.  

"Shit, Did they just change subjects?!?" I'm thinking to myself, as I make the Universal Signal for depicting the perfect combination of Hunger and Readiness at a food ordering counter -- I caused my keys to jingle in my hands.  

I literally stood at an empty counter while they chatted for a full minute and a half before I decided to turn and begin walking away.
I didn't rush, since there were a few Mother-May-I-Giant-Steps between me and the exit, and I would have gladly turned back if called upon.

But she let me go, and now I know why.

Mr Gyro doesn't need my business.
Mr Gyro doesn't need your business.

And if Mrs Rude does, in fact, speak on behalf of the entire ownership of Mr Gyro, well, then I guess 

Mr Gyro doesn't even WANT our business.   So be it.

With the exception of a check-in snafu caused by the very "green" & inexperieced hostess, I'd have to say I had a pretty good experience at the tea lounge at the Mandarin Oriental.  I just have one point of advice, check your reservation with the hostess at least three times. By then, it may sink in for her.

Ok, let's carry on shall we?

Located adjacent to registration above the 23rd floor, you'd think the Tea Lounge was part of the lobby. But make no mistake, these premium seats come at a lofty price tag and a reservation to boot.  

Luckily, we were seated by the panoramic window as I requested and service, albeit a bit slow, was paced nicely and lent to the whole relaxing afternoon tea experience.  With that in mind, the tea selection was fairly limited but adequate for my needs. There were a host of green teas and herbal teas to accommodate most individual preferences and tastes IMO. Since I just arrived from a massage session, I went with the introspective herbal relaxation tea. The tea service runs from 2-5 pm daily and reservations are highly recommended as there are only a few tables in the lounge.  The views can be quite spectacular if you're seated by the window. We had a perfect view of the strip and City Center and the natural lighting was equally relaxing and calming.  

The food selections included a selection of finger sandwiches inspired by English afternoon "high tea" traditions, but where was the cucumber cream cheese?
In any case, the selections included a savory smoked salmon cucumber and watercress spread sandwich (my favorite of the bunch) egg salad & chives on brioche, curried chicken salad, and black forest ham. The tea service also included the best scones I've ever had in my life! These were buttery, light, flaky and irresistibly good. They came out nice and warm, served with some fresh berry jam, marmalade and an imported Devonshire clotted cream (extremely smooth and very addictive.) So addictive, in fact,  I found myself wanting to spread it on practically everything!  
Lastly, our afternoon tea service was completed with a selection of small bite sized desserts and pastries, which included macarons, tarts and chocolates.

By the end of the meal, I felt nicely sated and totally relaxed. I would definitely return on my next trip to Vegas but im going to have to put that hostess on check!

Happy Eats!

So, my only question for La Grande Orange Pizzeria is...can I please live here?  Seriously, this place is GREAT!  There really is no formal division between the pizzeria and grocery parts of the store, so I'm going to talk about both.  Grocery-wise, the place carries a broad mix of classic candies, wines, cookbooks, tchotchkes that rotate seasonally (I've picked up some great holiday items here in years past), and grocery staples; they also have a cafe that serves up oatmeal, eggs (friends rave about the Commuter Sandwich), salads, sandwiches, and sushi rolls.  Word to the wise - bring some extra napkins because their bakery will make you drool!  Order up front at the counter, pick a seat, and then keep your ears perked for when they call your name.  Friendly staff, cool ambience - I always find myself Shazam-ing the music here!  ;)         

As far as the pizza is concerned, the crust is insane!  It almost reminds me of really good sourdough bread, toasted and crispy, not too thin and not too thick.  All the ingredients are fresh and the pizza permutations creative.  They serve up your pie on a slab of wood - nice presentation!  Sadly, I am a creature of habit - once I find something that's to my liking, I latch on and order it every time I return for the rest of my life :/ At this particular establishment, these personal faves would be the Rocket Man Pizza (spicy red fresno chilies, broccolini, roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes) and the Classic Chocolate Pudding - wow, just wow!  I make my poor husband drive all the way across town to come here - he always grumbles but in the end, admits that the place IS pretty delicious.  

The only negative - and it definitely a BIG negative - is the parking situation.  La Grande Orange has the tinsiest micro parking lot known to man.  On a good day if the parking lot gods are smiling down on you, you just might find an open 20 minute parking spot (I haven't been impressed that they actually enforce the time restrictions).  But, if you go on their website under the 'Secret Parking' link (shhhh!), you will find a diagram depicting other parking options that are slightly farther away.

So yeah, come check out La Grande Orange for some great pizza, brunch, baked goods, groceries...the list goes on.  One of my favorite places in Phoenix!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 45/100

I had read some amazing reviews about Jean Philippe Patisserie, so I HAD to come here on my recent visit to Vegas this past weekend.

It is located in the Bellagio hotel, just a little bit past the Conservatory & Botanical Gardens. There are signs pointing towards which direction it is located in!

I was actually pretty surprised at how small this place was. I had envisioned to be a full bakery/patisserie with tons of cute little cafe tables/chairs and whatnot, but that wasn't the case. It's like a circular area with the employees/staff all in the middle, and you kinda just walk around the counter to look at all of the pastries, gelato, sandwiches, etc.

One wall has the famous chocolate fountain, which honestly...was not as big as I had pictured. When people said it's the "biggest chocolate fountain in the world" I was thinking like straight up Willy Wonka status. This was totally not the case! Granted, it was a really nice glass display and I really liked that they had dark, milk, and white chocolate pouring in it, but I didn't think it was as mindblowing as I had expected it to be.

Along the circular walls they have a bunch of packaged goodies like chocolates, candies, hot chocolate mix, etc. They also have some fake cakes on display. I'm not sure if they actually bake fancy cakes here, but the displays were nice!

Unfortunately I had just eaten lunch and wasn't hungry at all, so I didn't any of the pastries although I had REALLY wanted to try some of them out! They didn't have a HUGE selection but some of them looked very tasty! I ended up getting a scoop of the dulce de leche gelato ($3+), and the Jean Philippe vanilla hot chocolate mix ($18).

The gelato was ok to me. Presentation wasn't the nicest, and also it was really soft...like to the point where it was basically melting! Gross. I wasn't impressed.

I made the hot chocolate mix when I came home, and I must say, this stuff is INCREDIBLE. It reminds me of the hot chocolate at Churros Calientes in Los Angeles. Super thick, rich, and decadent. omg, it is incredible. I'm glad it turned out well because $18 for only a few cups of hot chocolate was pretty pricey! Even more than Godiva and some other high end chocolate brands.

Overall, I liked Jean Philippe but I wasn't as blown away as I thought I was going to be. I definitely would return to actually try some of their pastries and maybe even their crepes (which are supposed to be amazing). 3 stars!

If their Shanghai Xiao Long Bao  is the only item on their menu, I would still be dropping by this latest Chinese restaurant to open up in Las Vegas's greater Chinatown area. Now before you all go crazy and question why it is only getting 4 and not 5 stars on Yelp, let me explain.

It is good, not the best I've ever had, but I enjoyed it. In fact, after my unplanned XLB crawl of the 2 newest restaurants that serve it to open up on the west side, I can say A & K Chinese Restaurant (aka Heng Long Chinese Restaurant, if going by their name on the credit card receipt) was the clear winner of the head-to-head XLB CHALLENGE over Edamame Restaurant on Wednesday, May 7th, 2014.  

You don't have to take my word for it though. What I think is "good" could be "that is the worst, flavorless blah blah I have ever had!"  (Funny random thought: what if water is being judged right now?)

Anyway, seems like we are blessed with more and more XLB options in Las Vegas, which means to make it, the chefs all have to up their games. Translation: consumers are the winner. Yay!

I also had their Three Treasures Dumpling  (12pcs) per order and it was pretty good too. The fact they hand make these is just wonderful.

On my first visit I also tried their Pan Fried Pork Bun  (8 pcs) $7.95. If you go by yourself, this item alone will be enough to send you home with a full belly. It was just okay, the doughy bun on the outside is thinker than what I have had in Taiwan (which was THE BEST  at that busy night market), so maybe not fair comparison.

Beef Pancake Roll  $7.95. Decent. There are better ones I have had within a 2 mile radius.

Hot Purple Sweet Potato Juice , small $2.25. It was an experience to try this. It is basically purple sweet potato drink, not really sweet, but a creamy dessert alternative beverage.

Service overall was good.  I happened to have been there when they were not busy, so that might have helped too. Plus I can speak enough Mandarin Chinese to get by in restaurants, so that certainly helped.

Decor/Ambiance was pleasant. Music playing in the background was not Chinese, but instrumentals of popular American songs, which you probably wouldn't even pay attention to unless you focus on it.

Price/Value: I think it was good overall. 

Note: this is NOT your typical Chinese takeout restaurants. I must admit I am not familiar with most of their menu offerings, because I am not at all an expert on Shanghainese cuisine. But they also described their cuisine as  (New style of Jiangsu and Zhejiang - per Google Translate, which is still like Hexcodes to me). But come for their XLB, and if you are adventurous enough, you can explore their other menu items.

Expect an UYE for Xiao Long Bao  crawl and another one to just explore this restaurant's menu (yeah, I am definitely gonna need backup).

Bonus: Love that American Express is accepted along with other forms of credit card payments.  :)

I could tell you all the reasons why you shouldn't go here. But what good of a reviewer would I be if I told the Yelp community to stay away because this place is far too amazing and you're not good enough to take part in it. Every food lover who can appreciate the beauty in a piece of raw fish should have the chance to experience what Kabuto has brought to Las Vegas. But good luck trying, there are only 18 seats in the entire restaurant and once word gets out, it ain't gonna be easy to get in.

Kabuto is part of the Mon Restaurant Family (Monta, Goyemon, Sushi Mon) and another development from restaurant stylist Martin Koleff. Martin is a pioneer for authentic Japanese eateries in Las Vegas. And at the sushi bar, I was rubbing elbows with those who were more than familiar with Martin's talents. He even popped in for a brief hello during my meal. 

I was told the Omakase Course ($80) will not be available until after the grand opening. I went with the Nigiri Course ($48) but you can order a la carte if you wish. I was served a pineapple appertif sake, a small cucumber salad with sea snail, and 10 pieces of the best fish I've ever had. You can state your preferences, but I had the chef choose for me. He was actually quite vocal and very friendly! He was conversational and took the time to explain the origin of each fish. The giant clam and bull eye were a couple of my favorites. And the uni with ikura were to die for. After your 10 pieces are served, you have the option of ordering more nigiri or moving on to your handroll. I ordered an additional saba then finished my meal. If you love mackerel. Order it here. I've now found the best saba in Las Vegas.

Dessert is not taken lightly here either.  In a couple of months, a Japanese pastry shop is to join this family of restaurants right next door. You have a few dessert options with the nigiri course--mochi, ice cream, or the strawberry layered crepe I ordered. Before I started eating, the chef busted out his iPhone and showed me a picture of a bunch of rocks. Confused, he explained to me the pastry chef's vision. She created the pink and white layers to resemble the layers of rock and sandstone at Red Rock. It was touching, and very delicious.

To be quite honest, I've never been to Japan. My understanding of Japanese tradition is a smattering of information from the internet and my Japanese-immigrant friends. But even I can tell that authenticity and quality are of the utmost importance here. From the food to the decor, Kabuto lives and breathes culture. Its unlike any sushi "joint" you've ever visited in town. I won't discourage you from visiting this magnificent addition to the Las Vegas community. But if you walk in expecting a baked roll with cream cheese, please, turn around and leave those 18 seats for the rest of us.

Whoahhhh!!! Now this is what i call a throw down!

Of course, i'm referencing Bobby Flay's inventive cuisine at his southwestern themed restaurant in Caesar's palace, Las Vegas.   

It was our first night and after winning a grip of change form the slots at Caesar's, my friend suggested eating at Mesa Grill for din din.  I wasn't too familiar with the restaurant but when I realized it was Bobby Flay's joint, my interest was certainly piqued.  

Truth be told, i'm not a Flay fanatic by an stretch, but a little star power never hurt anyone IMO.  With that said, there's always the pressing issue of hype over substance which in turn had me proceeding with cautious optimism.  

As we made our way across the bustling casino and stepped into the restaurant, I definitely felt the warmth of the contemporary Latin theme throughout the communal dining space, which was flanked with rich reds and soft golden hues. 

Within moments, the hostess greeted us and proceeded to lead us to our seats.  Our server wasted no time in taking our orders, as well.

In record time, we got our beautifully plated appetizers and entrees. 
Let's just say my doubts melted away with my very first bite! Wow, this food had big, bold flavor and the quality was incredible! 

Here's a rundown of what we had:

Shrimp tamale - Plump, juicy and mouthwatering gulf shrimp in a fresh corn meal that was both rich & flavorful. Outstanding! 

Tuna nachos - Fresh chunks of seasoned ruby red tuna in a sweet & tangy sauce that had a pleasant citrusy finish. The crisp corn tortilla added a nice contrast in texture to this refreshingly vibrant dish! Lip smacking goodness in every bite!

Pork tenderloin - This dish was absolutely phenomenal!!! The meat was like a perfectly cooked filet! It was soft, buttery and rich. Perfectly decadent and oh so flavorful! Honestly, the meat was so tender, i kept asking my friends "Are you sure this is pork?" 

Spice Filet - Buttery, tender and succulent beef filet with a pleasant kick from the house spices! Scrumptious!

Lamb chops - Beautiful crust and perfectly pink inside. Boasting a magnificent charbroiled flavor that was absolutely addicting! Seconds please!

Corn - Fresh cuts of corm kernels with explosive flavor and fantastic texture. This is a side you don't wanna miss!

After consuming all that delicious food, we simply had no additional room for dessert. Besides, wehad our minds set on some chocolate decadence at Max Brenner's afterwards (review forthcoming)

Overall, service was attentive, friendly and fast. The food, of course, was incredible and most importantly, it didn't break the bank either!

Why? Because this birthday boy didn't have to pay...lol

Happy Eats!

If I were on my deathbed, I would request to be wheeled over to eat at Bacio because it would feel like a LIFETIME!!!

I dined here because of a $150 food credit.  With so many quality restaurants in Las Vegas, the ones at The Tropicana aren't on the top of my list.  They're not even on the list.

But color me surprised when I saw their 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings for only $39.  Hey!  That made "restaurant week" look expensive.  It's a shame we didn't even get to the third course after 2+ hours.  I felt even worse for the couple from Italy at the next table playing the same waiting game.  Why in God's name would actual Italians eat here?!?!  

Their saving grace was that the food I did try was actually decent.  The "Risotto Capesante" with scallops, asparagus and prosciutto paired with a crispy white wine was surprisingly good.  I would've been happy with this dish as all four courses.  The "White Peach" salad I received over an hour later was also good but the wait made it taste a little less good.  My dinner companions ordered a la carte and got the veal parmigiana (huge and juicy) and shrimp risotto 90 minutes after ordering.  If they actually got this whole "serving food in a timely manner" down, Bacio wouldn't be a half bad place.  

What the heck was going on in the kitchen??  My guess was the chef suffered from narcolepsy.  We had less than 35 minutes to make a 10pm show at Caesars Palace.  I spoke with the manager to express my displeasure and he took the 2 course dinners off the bill.  The server was super nice, apologetic and took care of a round of drinks too.  At least they made an effort to make it right.  They then boxed up our last two courses of lobster gnocchi (rubbery) and apple granola cheesecake.  The dessert then melted in my car and went straight into the garbage.

With so many notable spots for fusion cuisine having popped up in the middle of the desert over the past few years, Japaneiro kicks the door down and slam dunks their excellent menu into the Asian fusion ring with authority. 

Like a lot of the gushing reviews already mention, the chalkboard specials by the entrance is where the gold is.  My advice would be to take a picture of it to look over with your tablemates so you're not like me and getting up to look over the board again and again as if it were on display at a museum.  

I can never say no to foie gras.  If foie gras told me to jump off a bridge, buy it diamond earrings or crash my car through a convenience store, I'd do it.  It was well cooked and those tasty notes of fatty tenderness in a savory sauce were music to my mouth.  I even showed some restraint by offering the last bite to my wife. :P

The Nigerian prawns tasted as impressive as they appeared.  Large and succulent, the truffle butter sauce that it was accompanied by took it to another level.  The green salad offered a nice balance to the whole dish.  I admit I sucked on the shrimp shells to savor the flavor and only felt 3.1% ashamed/embarrassed about it afterwards.  

Our meal luckily managed to carry over to the late happy hour that occurs M-F 10pm-midnight.  Ending the meal with some great small bites like the salmon/tuna/beef tacos and miso black cod lettuce wraps.  The standout was the rock shrimp with its terrifically crispy fry, micro wasabi kick and cream sauce made it an absolute steal for $5.50.  I guess that shows how good these chefs are; they even managed to make rock shrimp interesting!

The lack of description for many of the items caused me to underestimate things like the "European Sea Bass" until I saw it brought to another table near the end of our meal.  The fish looked marvelous with the meat being filleted post-grill and the rest of the carcass twisted up for an interesting look.  I was practically seething with jealousy!  

Lesson learned: everything is awesome and get that the next time.

I ate here during "Restaurant Week" and am so glad I did! I enjoyed every bite of my meal and the service was fantastic. Hubby and I were seated at a roomy booth and our drinks were never empty. A basket of warm bread with butter came out quick and tasted great. The price for the RW menu was $50.14 per person and I enjoyed the following for that price before tax:

The Famous Original Spinning Bowl Salad - This is made right at your table. Our server, Ms. Huang had 2 metal bowls that spun as she added the dressing. The salad had lettuce, beets, hard boiled eggs, croutons and their signature vintage dressing. I haven't ever tasted a salad like this before. It was suggested that I add some of the Lawry's seasoning that was on the table, so I did. The salad tasted so fresh and delicious. Very good.

Mashed Potatoes - This was a nice addition to my plate. The mashed potatoes are whipped with butter and milk and tasted perfect. The brown gravy that came on it was good. 

Buttered Peas - Yum! Being on the same plate, the peas ended up with brown gravy and au jus on them which I like. Plus, I just like peas!

Yorkshire Pudding - This comes in a skillet by itself. It tasted great and was perfect for soaking up the last bits of gravy on my plate. it was soft and really good. 

Prime Rib - 8 ounces of pure heaven! A carver came to the table with a cart of prime rib and let me pick how I wanted it and then carved it right in front of me. I like mine a little more done and that's just what I got. The prime rib was so tender and literally fell apart. It had such great flavor. To say I didn't leave here stuffed would be absolutely wrong! Everything tasted good, but the prime rib was the true star.

Creme Brulee - This had fresh berries on top and It tasted so good, but I could only eat half because I was so full. 

Coffee - Tasted great and was a perfect way to end the meal. At this point I just needed a pillow for a nap!

I can't say enough about our server. She was fantastic and took great care of us. The manager on duty, Wendy came over and chit chatted with us for maybe 10 minutes and she was warm and friendly. She let us know a little about the lunch menu which sounds like a winner. This was a great RW experience and I will be back!

Of all the Roberto's locations around Vegas this 'berto's location is one of the more consistent. It's located between Home Depot and Capriotti's. I have been coming here on my lunch break and more recently yesterday after a trip to Home Depot. The inside is clean and the guy at the register who has taken my order each time is friendly and actually goes over your order with you to make sure it's right if you customized anything. Like the other locations in town, you can get your chicken taco fix for only 99 cents on Wednesdays with a limit of 12 per person at that price.

The "Adobada Taco" at a cost of $2.75 each was good. It had marinated pork, guacamole and fresh salsa on it. There was meat falling out of the taco because they weren't stingy with the fillings. One thing I love here is the "Rolled Tacos" that come in different options. You can choose chicken, beef, sour ream, guacamole or just cheese. I don't like their guacamole that much, so I just got the rolled tacos (beef) with cheese. The rolled tacos with cheese cost $2.35 and are easily a meal by itself for me! So darn cheap and it tastes good. I love the "Carne Asada Fries" here, but only get them when I have someone to share with because it's such a huge portion. The asada fries cost $8.10 which is a great price for the size of it. We are talking fries, beans, sour cream, salsa, cheese and a pile of carne asada. It does come with guacamole, but I asked that it be left off. The menu here has many options for everyone. 

Inside there are plenty of tables and a small salsa and veggie bar. It has been filled with customers when I have been here, so I am going to start calling my lunch order in to avoid the wait time. If you are on a time crunch and it's Wednesday, calling in your order is smart as well because more people are there that day loading up on the 99 cent chicken tacos.

Wow. The sandwich game has been lifted. 

I came to Buddha Belly Deli after I saw a few Elites, one in particular (Shirley B.) frequented here about three times over the course of two weeks. That's some bodacious Buddha dedication. You know what though, her dedication was rightly placed. 

Not only is the food here amazing, but the staff is insanely helpful and friendly. With my hunger pains increasing I walked in and zero'd in on the "Schezwan Shrimp Po' Boy"... "yes please!" My lunchtime partner got the "Pho Dip", a very thinly sliced meaty sandwich, with pickled veggies piled high, and accompanied by a hot side of Pho broth. 

To kick-off this food frenzy, we also order smothered-fries. Now these aren't your drunken southern uncle's chili-fries, these are on another level. Crispy, thin french fries covered with a thai chili flavored pulled pork. They call this type of topping "Sloppy Joe", on the menu, but it's more than the all American slop you're most likely used to. It's a game changer in-deed. Simple, but amazing and once this hit the table it was game on! 

I'm pretty sure The Schezwen Shrimp Po' Boy had a dash of Viagra in it because I was getting more and more aroused with each flavor-filled bite. Loaded with fried shrimp, a spicy mayo, pickled jalapeos and a few other pepper options. This amazing concoction of sandwich fair was wedged between two very soft pieces of a french baguette. The shrimp was crispy on the outside, but still juicy and firm on the inside. Seriously I could have eaten two of these at one sitting.
 
Now, at this point my hunger monster was taking over and I noticed that my lunchtime partner still had half of her "Pho Dip" sammie on the plate. I asked her for a taste and before she could even answer I was already mid-bite. Soft bread, a big layer of thin sliced meat, and a perfect Pho broth to dip it in. This was pure magic. I ate almost the whole thing before coming out of my flavor induced black-out and seeing an angry glare staring back at me from across the table.

If you were to witness this gross display of gluttony, it would remind you of Shark Week's "best of" clips... you know where a shark's eyes roll into the back of their head before they viscously attack some poor unsuspecting tasty creature. I couldn't care less, no food shaming here. 

Honestly this isn't just a sandwich shop, but a place where the owners actually take pride in their food on many levels. There it is folks... The secret has been unlocked. Just take pride in your art and maybe something beautiful and tasty will come out of it. 

Whoa. That last line might be the Buddha talking.

Open letter to restaurant customers everywhere (especially Yelpers):

The inc.com article recently discussed in Yelp Talk makes good points about the serious impact that Yelp can have on a business, positive or negative.
http://www.yelp.com/topic/tempe-new-article-on-yelp
http://www.yelp.com/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.inc.com%2Fmagazine%2F20100201%2Fyouve-been-yelped.html

Despite any controversy the article also may have included, I realize the importance of being a responsible reviewer more after reading it, and hope I can share that feeling and understanding with you now.

Especially when it comes to independent, unique, one-of-a-kind places -- would you really want your favorite local flavor to disappear because a yelper or two didn't like a particular server's muffintop or tone of voice?

With that in mind, I must humbly take on a review Update that 's weighed heavily on my soul for some time.

Several months after my initial review of Steakenburger, I received a note from the owner, Tom.  He sent a personal message instead of a public comment, and did NOT at all make the mistake some proprietors do by responding in an angry or condescending tone to my critiques.  Instead I found the response to be brimming with *CLASS*.

I received a sincere and heartfelt letter apologizing for my experience and asking a chance for redemption.  If you read below, you can see that they took the review and steps to address its criticisms VERY SERIOUSLY.

I would like to invite all Yelpers to remember to give second chances and update their reviews often, even the bad ones, whenever appropriate to do so.  
Sometimes things go wrong that are outside of the biz's control.
Sometimes a rogue server is having a pissy day and takes it out on you.
Sometimes they just make a mistake.

We all do.  And we always want another chance, don't we?  Ask us and we'll tell you we DESERVE it, too.   

-----------------------------------------------------------------
"Ryan C-
My name is Tom Philp, owner of SteakenBurger.

First, I am bummed about your bad experience.  With that said, I truly appreciate your candid feedback.  I cringe every time I re-read your experience (which is often), but I believe your review has made us a better restaurant.

While we are still hiring from the human race, and will make mistakes, I'd like to believe that we listen to our critics and respond with systemic adjustments to prevent future similar occurrences.

I have waited some time to respond to insure that I felt comfortable that we had improved our processes and consistency.  

I'd like to invite you back for a do-over ....
I've read all of your reviews and know that I could get skewered again if we fail you, but also feel that we would get a favorable review IF (and only IF) it is warranted.  At the risk of your wrath, I invite you back. 

Thank you for your consideration of this invitation.

Tom & Judie Philp
SteakenBurger"

The folks at Steakenburger are a class act, and I wish them great luck in their tough business endeavors.

Steakenburger earned their redemption, and they highly DESERVE it! 

I went back for the food, becasue it is unique and fresh and tasty.  
The Steakenburger was a delicious meat-pile, cooked to ideal doneness, and yet still juicy without feeling greasy.  
The homecut fries seem to be double fried now, or something, becasue they had a crisp outside while retaining a potatoey mushiness inside -- perfectly cut thick with the skins on.  Homecut fries are hard to crisp up, and they've done a wonderful job with this recipe.  

There are ten different flavors of wings (let's see if I can remember them: mild, med, hot, suicide, zombie (?!?), bbq, honey bbq, honey hot, habanero, damn i fell short!) and there is even a neat challenge to eat a certain number of habanero wings within an hour and get your picture on the wall of fame.  
I'm sure Adam Richman has this one on his radar allready for a future MvF.  Steakenburger is way more deserving than some of the junk that's been on DDD, too (Chino Bandido, blech)

In summary: GO TO STEAKENBURGER !

I had read some great Yelp reviews about this place and anything Keller has got to be good. So I figured when in Rome....

Or is it when at the Venetian do as the French do?  Very confusing. So as I swaggered out of the hotel in the morning to my trade show at the convention center I made a 6:30 dinner reservation for later that night. Oh man it smelled good, I almost stayed for breakfast.

After a long day at the convention center, it came time for dinner and man I couldn't wait to dive into Bouchon and do a French belly flop!  

I was immediately seated and my first (of many) waiters came to get me started off. I'm not much of a wino so I asked about the beer selection they had to offer and settled on a dark pumpkin spice number.

The 2nd was  bringing some bread shells and pistachio's  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouchon-las-vegas?select=w-8xsdNVt1DXAJhXaGNLsw#gQ8-2YOTknwRmAxwp1fVEw   as the 3rd waiter was showing me the menu. A newsprint deal that wrapped around the cutlery and napkin.  Crap! I told the waiter I don't have my glasses and can hardly see. The restaurant was dim and oozed romance too bad I was alone and blind. But waiter #3 to the rescue! He had a mini LED flashlight and I was able to read the menu and find some choices for my dinner!

STARTERS: 
French onion soup ... What else? I love FR Onion soup and Bouchon's soup is no slouch. It kicked ass! One of the best I've ever eaten. 4.5*****Stars http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=yXvxjUxdZxTXkv4b1pp6HA&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw
I finished every drop!
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_ncmx4f7Cpjk-12I0buXgQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

SALAD: ... Salade Marachre au Chvre Chaud
I can't even pronounce half of that, but it was a great fru fru salad with a tasty hunk of goat cheese and a delish red wine dressing, I ate every leaf of that bad boy. 4.****Stars
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=iK0praadEO0s1HXWN_P5iA&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

ENTREE: ... I ordered the Steak Frites. OMG that steak was heavenly! Melt in my mouth tender, juicy and  topped with caramelized shallots & matre d'htel butter (light garlic butter and caramelized onion medley). One of the best steaks I've ever eaten. The mountain of shoe string fries never got limp or soggy and were a perfect match for my steak. 5****Stars
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lilGGLerloMXwscZ4D2TCg&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

DESERT: ... I managed to strike up a conversation with the guy to my left, who it turns out was the Keller resturants IT guy who was visiting for work, he suggested the Poire Belle Hlne for my dessert. OK I'm game I said. The poached pear and hazelnut ice cream with a chocolate sauce was spot on. Too bad my camera died, but my tongue was working overtime on this insider tip. 5*****Stars

The restaurant is impeccable and the service here is top notch!  I had a great experience here and can't wait to come back again.

If you are looking for a really good Italian beef sandwich, you will find it here. Hubby and I stopped here for dinner and left full and satisfied. The inside is clean and there are plenty of tables. The employees were friendly and went over some of the menu items with us. They have Italian sausage, wraps, char-grilled burgers, hot dogs, salads, chili, tamales and fries, but my first time I had to try what they are famous for.

So, I ordered an "Italian Beef Sandwich" (regular Al) priced at $6.35 and added provolone and hot peppers for 50 cents each topping as well asked for the sandwich to be dipped. The bread really held up everything in it very well. Napkins are required when eating this sandwich dipped! The beef was tender and had good flavor and the peppers added a nice flavor to the sandwich. I also ordered a small "Cheddar Cheese Fries" priced at $3.85 and just thought they were average. Next time I am going to try them with different toppings. I liked that my food was made fresh in front of me. There isn't a drive-thru here, but if you are on a time crunch you can phone in your order for pick-up.

Holy Customer Service NIGHTMARE.

WOW. The lack of professionalism the entire staff showed leading up to our reservation followed through to 3 months later when our issue from NYE was not resolved... One word... NIGHTMARE. An all around headache that I would not care to every partake in ever again. 

Please note the actual club itself is gorgeous. However, that doesn't give anyone the right to completely forget any form of customer service. 

LONG story short:
Had a reserved table for NYE.
Arrived at 10:30pm and were given the reserved table for a party of 12 on stage.
11:30pm - removed from the table with no explanation, sent around trying to talk to the managers to figure out what was happening. Did I mention this was NYE and all happening right before the ball drop?
11:50 - told the team of 3 that had handled our reservation was not working the night of. WHO CARES! We had emails and confirmations of the reservation. 
11:55 - the option to get a table that fits 4 behind the stage next to the pool when we had a party of 12. So yes, a table that did not fit our group nor was it anywhere near the DJ booth or dance floor.
Basically learned that someone else offered more money for our table so we were booted. We were told we would receive a refund. It is now 3 months after and we are still waiting on the refund. Atrocious. 

In the last of the 23 emails returned back and forth, this was the closing: "Please let me know if you decide to visit again and I will personally make sure your experience is flawless." BAHAHAHA! Right... because that is what we were told when we made our original reservation for NYE. Did I mention we planned this in September? Yes, 3 months of planning down the drain thanks to greedy club managers and owners. 

Big name DJs? Yes
Bottle Service & VIP? Yes
Huge areas to move around? Yes... however, during the high tourist months, they pack them in. Also, if you are in one spot of the club and have to get to the other side and there are crowds... give yourself 20 minutes. Not even joking. 
Great sound system? Yes
Fun lights and confetti? Yes
**Absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with in any club around the world. TRIPLE YES.**

I have had this place bookmarked for a while and am glad we finally tried it. I felt like deep dish pizza and heard that North End puts out a good one. Walking inside we were greeted and told to sit anywhere. Looking around there were many pictures on the wall of movie posters and different sporting events as well family history of the owner and her family. A lot of Boston decor! The owner, Claudia, was there at a table not only eating, but saying hello to each customer and making sure they were enjoying their food. Claudia has her dad make the pizza dough at his restaurant in Boston, and then ships it to Las Vegas for use here at North End Pizza. Her mom makes the pizza sauce locally from her secret recipe.  

We started out with an order of "Garlic Knots" priced at $6.50 for an order of 12 knots and sauce. These weren't traditional since they were *not* in a *knot*, but more a disc if flavorless dough. With all of the seasoning on them, I didn't get it and would not order them again, knowing where I can get authentic ones at other restaurants in town. 

For the main course I ordered a "1/2 Ricotta & Garlic 1/2 Sausage Pizza" priced at  $22.99 including toppings. I ordered the Sicilian, which requires an hour for prep/bake time. If you know you want this then you can just call ahead and have them start it for you. The Sicilian only comes in 16 inch size. I really enjoyed this pizza! I tasted nothing but garlic on my half so I don't know where the garlic flavor was on the knots? The pizza dough was nice and thick and cooked thoroughly. We had more then enough left to take home for another meal! I want to come back and try their thin crust pizza next.

You can come in and buy pizza by the slice or try out some of their calzones, pasta, salads, sandwiches or appetizers. North End offers delivery/dine-in/carryout. 

Mon thru Sat: 11 am - 9 pm
Sun: 12 pm - 9 pm

"I rather eat like no one's watching than dance like no one's watching."  - Cristela Alonzo

I'm no cheese steak expert nor have I had an actual philly cheese steak from Philadelphia but I will say that this is a damn good sandwich.  It has everything I was looking for:  lots of meat, lots of cheese, and lots of flavor!  Great Friday night meal!

The beef is juicy, tender, and plentiful and the cheese helped glue everything together. I got the red sauce on the side since I wasn't sure what to expect but after trying it out, I will say that I'm definitely getting it on it next time.  One tiny cup just isn't enough!  That tomato sauce with oregano and other spices... Yum!  Mr. W. ran out of red sauce fast for his 12in. sandwich.  I had mine with no vegetables because I usually never finish my meal in one sitting and end up taking it home.  I figured the vegetables will fill me up too fast and I wanted to try to finish majority of it while it was still piping hot.  I will shamefully admit that I took down all 8-inches like a champ [that's what she said].  It was a feat that both impressed and scared Mr. W.  We also got our combos with the seasoned fries which were actually potato wedges.  Not bad or extraordinary but the star is definitely the sandwich with the red sauce.

This is a family-owned establishment and this is seriously the sweetest family ever.  I had a chance to talk with the boss-lady/mother and she was a delight!  The ambiance of the joint is super casual and the sound of metal cooking utensils banging on the flat-top stove only adds to the charm.  Ah, a place where I can eat like a pig and no one would judge me.  Also to note, they have this crazy drink called Barq's red creme soda.  I've never heard of it or had it before tonight and I can never go back to such ignorance!  And since it is a small family-owned place, the wait time can be pretty long since it's made to order but the wait is worth it.  EAT HERE, PEOPLE!

I read about this new attraction in the Las Vegas Sun and decided to make a trip down to Fremont Street to give it a try.  Since my Son was off of school today, I brought him along.  The attraction is located on the far East side of Fremont Street, which is closest to Las Vegas Blvd.  The best place to park is the parking garage on the corner of Fremont Street & Las Vegas Blvd.  It's pretty cheap for parking....we were there for 2 hours and paid $3.

I posted a video on YouTube if you want to see the experience:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxzOl3TXeJs

The ticket office for this attraction is on the Fremont Street level next to the Walgreens.  Tickets are $15 each for 1 ride, $25 for 2 rides, $30 for 3 rides....that's per person.  In other words, 3 people riding once will pay $45 total.....capiche?  Cool....

Since we didn't know if we'd enjoy it, we paid $15 each for the single ride.  We should have paid $30 each for the 3 pack.....because we ended up riding a 2nd time.  The girl was cool and only charged us $10 each for the 2nd ride as if we paid for the 2 pack....not sure she'll hook you up like that though, so don't expect that.  (see pics for full price list and all day discount pricing)

The launch pad is I think 60 ft in the air and you access it by going to the 5th floor (roof) of the parking garage, which is the same building the ticket office is located.  We made our way up there and waited in line.  Everyone in line was pretty nervous, including myself.  I'm not a fan of heights, but wanted to give this a try.  My Son was pretty brave....he wasn't nervous at all....until we got up to the edge of the platform.

You get strapped into a harness and get some instruction.  Here are some tips:

- Don't wear flip flops or sandals with no ankle straps....if you do, they'll make you take them off and put them in a netted bag.

- Purses or bags without secure straps will not be allowed on the ride.

- Don't wear anything with loose pockets or if you do, don't put anything in them because it could fly out easily.

- Don't wear loose sunglasses.  They could fly of easily with the airflow generated during the ride.

- They don't allow pictures to be taken during the ride, for obvious reasons...ie your camera could slip out of your hands and seriously injure someone on the ground.

It sounds like a lot of rules, but it's common sense.  Knowing this in advance will save you a trip back to your car or hotel room.

The zipline can handle groups up to 4 people at one time.  A quick hint if you want to get on/off the ride fast.....ride as a single.  They're always looking for a single to fill up a group of three, which happened often while we were there.

We were nervous on the final walk up the stairs to the launch pad....when you get up there the instructor will attach you to a cable until you're secured on the zipline.  Each person will be hooked up to the zipline and given instructions on what to do.  I admit, I was nervous all the way up until the launch of our 1st ride.  It looks much higher from the launch pad than from the ground.

After everyone is given instructions, he releases the safety clip and you lift up your legs and your body weight launches you down the zipline.  If you want to go really fast, tuck your knees up to your chest like a cannon ball dive in a pool.....you'll pick up speed right away.  If you stay in this position, you'll maximize your speed all the way through the ride.....this was a tip given to us by the instructor.

The ride itself is very fun.....you feel like you're flying above everyone, because you are.  It was very exhilarating and I felt free.  The landing is the roughest part.....you slam into a padded stopping mechanism and your momentum swings you up quickly while an employee secures your line with a rope.  I was amazed at how fast we came in on the landing.....the 2nd time around I nailed the employee in the shoulder with my knee....I'm surprised he didn't go down.  He said it happens all day long.....I wouldn't want his job.

After your ride, you get your picture taken and you have the option to purchase pictures of your ride.....prices are $10 each for the 1st 2 pics, then $5 a pic after that.  I paid for 4 pics since we couldn't take any on the ride itself.....nice to have as a souvenir for the 1st time, won't pay for it again though.  I didn't post those pics because I don't have a scanner.  The pics I posted of people on the zipline were other riders.  The pics from the launch pad was from my perspective....I put the camera away just before launch.

Overall, it was an exhilarating ride and we had a blast.

Will we return?  There's no doubt about it.....I'm taking all of my friends who visit from out of town to ride.

They say, you can never go home, or go back. Well, I've never bought into that. 

Over the years, we've been in almost a dozen or so Chart Houses. Sadly, many have closed due to whatever corporate reorg was going on at the time. I miss the ones in Steamboat and Newport, RI the most. Great locations and views. 

So it was with some excitement that we made reservations here for Easter Sunday dinner. Surprisingly, we have never been to this location.

We arrived a few minutes before six and found our hostess in a middle of a hiccups fit. I offered to frighten her but she decline. I guess I was scary enough. LOL

There was also some confusion over our reservations, but it didn't last long. We were escorted to our table, over by the window with a magnificent view of the lake. You got to give Chart House credit for choosing some great locations!

We started with a glass of Merlot and Pinot each. Both were very good for house wines. We also opted for the salads, the warm bacon dressing was delicious, as was the Caesar.

Things started slowly declining from here. I asked about getting their Callahan Prime Rib End Cut ($33.99). Seems the kitchen couldn't make up their minds if they had one. 

First it was no, then yes and finally surprise, they delivered a regular cut. It was tasteless with no flavor at all. When we were paying I mentioned it to our server, all they could say was, "oh yeah."  Grrr. LOL. The other entree was their Beef Tenderloin Medallions ($31.99) which was very good. 


For dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake to share with some coffee. It came damaged and somewhat of a mess. LOL. See our photo, versus the Chart House one. Our waiter apologized saying they should have been picked it up sooner. (Okay, why didn't you bring us another one?). 

The current owners of Chart House is Landry, a very classy and sharp organization.  I would suggest they work on this location before they need to close this one too. 

Our bill, including two glasses of wine ran us $80.00 a person, including taxes and gratuities. 

Now why didn't we go to Capital Grill I wonder?  Well, maybe next time.

For a positive review of a Chart House, I call your attention to my friend Norm's recent experience in Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz/forte-european-tapas-bar-and-bistro-las-vegas?hrid=Gpo-2lh59Bru8sKqgRm5Hw

I'm the first real person to review this place, let all other fake spammers be gone!  Yelp should really work that shizzle out.  Zack S...um this place closes at 11 so you couldn't have possibly hit the bar...so yeah if your gonna post fake reviews at least check your facts..

This place has so much potential, yet the ridiculously bad service just overshadowed everything good they did.

This is probably the worst service I have ever received in my life.  

Do you guys remember in Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts goes into the first store on Rodeo and the snooty lady acts like she's too good for this place?  Well that's what they did to us.

Where's the hostess?  Oh she's chatting with her friend...*ignoring me*

We finally get seated and then we sit and wait...

and wait...

and wait...

finally I get up and ask one of the waiters at the cash register to send over someone...

She treats us like we're a nuisance to her, she's singing along to the song that's playing...(WTF?)  I think they turned up the music louder as more people left because by the time it was near closing time it was blaring hip hop music...really weird considering it was a nice casual Italian restaurant.

We order almost 200 bucks worth of food, and then she's like "is that it?"

excuse me bitch...watch the attitude...

Wait, wait, watch as all the waiters get together to talk about us...seriously I can see you whispering about us....this is so unprofessional right now....

We seriously waited for like an hour and a half, it was ridiculous!  The place was practically empty!  The waiters were standing around and chatting with each other.  I took pictures as evidence!

This place is supposed to be a nice place, for the prices they charge they should have a whole restaurant re-staffed because it was ridiculous!  I have never felt more uncomfortable and treated so rudely in my life!

I also wanted to order take out for later and apparently they don't have take out boxes?  You're a restaurant?  You don't have boxes?  Seriously?

This is the worst experience in a restaurant I have ever had.  I've gotten better service at Carls Jr in a shady neighborhood than this.  

I won't hesitate to tell everyone to avoid this restaurant when you're in Vegas because this was outrageous!  No one treats me like that and gets away with it!  I wish I had a You've been yelped card so I could give them a piece of my mind.

I'm like those crazy housewives who have nothing better to do...I won't stop calling to speak to management until someone is fired.  I'm serious, no one gets away with treating me like that without suffering repercussions.  We don't play that, I'm sorry I'm not one of those quiet asian people who take your shit...I will not be silenced... You best believe.  You're done..The end.


*note I left for the manager*

"This is probably the most unprofessional and ridiculous restaurant I have ever had the misfortune to experience, not just from the our waitress, but the waitstaff and blatant ignorance from most of the employees I had to encounter."
                                                                   Anthony Nguyen

"Bonjour, mon ami.  Lardons, si vous plait"

Located conveniently by the hotel elevators at the Paris Las Vegas hotel, Le Cafe Ile St. Louis offers French American cuisine, specializing in breakfast/brunch.  A cute facade makes diners feel they are in city of lights, with dining inside or "al fresco", which in this case means overlooking the casino floor.  I chose to sit "al fresco" both times I dined here, as it gave ample opportunity to people watch, both those gambling & those walking by, and to enjoy the filtered casino air.  I assumed seating inside would be rather stuffy.

As previously mentioned, I dined at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis on two occasions, for dinner then for breakfast the next day.  Here's the 411-

Dinner - There was very little wait & was quickly led to a table.  While waiting for my order to arrive, crusty bread & butter were placed on our table-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ
By crusty, I mean crusty.  The outer layer of bread was as crusty as my tidy whities after my first wet dream.  Yes, that crusty!  Inside, though, was airy & soft.  The butter was crack to me.  I asked for another helping of it, as I was liberally dousing each piece of bread w/ butter.  I even helped myself to spoonfuls applied directly to mouth, w/o the interference of bread.

Calamari - Fried squid w/ crispy onions, fennel, lemon & a dijon mustard vinaigrette $12-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#kVwRy-qO3v8PJYyLn5u9aw
This was delicious.  Generous portions, fried crisp & light with a captivating vinaigrette.  I asked for more of said vinaigrette because I was bathing each piece of calamari and/or onion with it.  

Burger and foie gras - Angus beef, pate de foie gras, caramelized apples, balsamic gastrique on a brioche bun w/ pomme frites $18-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#MeXfEou-G1FANcmYRGUT5w
Tres bien!  What sold it for me was the foie gras, a food item that was recently banned for sale in California.  It's like meat butter.  I delighted in the medium-rare goodness-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#b40GDQLSlIUeiYa7GWeWQw
The pomme frites (french fries) were, sadly, soggy & limp.  I guess they spent too much time w/ the Paris go-go dancer the previous night ;p She sure knew how to twerk it, so I don't blame the fries for being limp LOL

Creme brulee $8 - 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#I2QqmkDyFQxm4iGwkx9Y_A
Ahhh, the crispy sugar shell forming a roof over the thick creme underneath.  This was magnifique!  I savored each & every bite, delighting in the burnt flavoring of the sugary shell.

Breakfast - There was about a 5 min wait, so it wasn't long before being seated "al fresco".  Complimentary toasted bread of choice was provided.  I chose sourdough & extra of that fantastic butter.  

Corned beef hash w/ two poached eggs $15 -
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#Lbn2VWRXcYHOWnJDlIpQ2A
Hearty, rich, stick to your ribs good!  I relished each & every bite, as the runny egg yolks slithered down the hash, making for a delectable meal.  Quality portions, worth the $15.

Cafe latte $5 - This could French kiss my derriere.  Weak coffee in a small cup.  I thought the Europeans were known for how strong they like their coffee.  This was more like Folgers.  The Gevalia I brew at home is leaps & bounds better than this drivel.

Service was good, as extra butter was brought out & drinks were refilled.  Seating is plentiful throughout, w/ my recommendation of dining "al fresco".

I enjoyed my 2 dining experiences here at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis.  It's Vegas, so the prices can be a little high for what you get, but I mostly enjoyed the food I had the pleasure of eating here.  Plus, the convenience of having the restaurant located right outside the hotel elevators make stopping here a breeze.

Recommend!

Au revoir!

My Favorite Vegas Sweet Stop! I got chocolate wasted and wouldn't have minded spending a whole day in this chocolate dream. 

Their chocolate drinks are heavenly. Friend had an italian in a cute hug mug http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=efFt78-ToFIXyJm5ZIjr4g
Dude had an 80s milkshake which was soooo delicious! Love the alice in wonderland "Drink Me" cup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=WslMBkiMScJAM6fOITjHQg

I ADDED BACON to my Guilt Free Omelette (CG style) and this was one of my favorite breakfast dishes i've had in a long time (thanks Janice C!). The omelette had some veggies and cheese, came with a side of potatoes. It came with an awesome sweet biscuit served with a side of butter and a side of milk chocolate!!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=WjX7TqdKnJfQ8_rL21lnNw. The potatoes dipped in the chocolate worked delicious as well. 
Friend had the Brenner Kobe Burger- but didn't swoon over it. But the fries were good. Dipped them in chocolate- even better! 
Shared a apple cinnamon waffle and it came out soo pretty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=ZM1r3Jgh1rIOAd8CLg_w8g
Loved loved the tiny vial of chocolate sauce and the tiny chocolate pearls to dress up our waffles. The Vanilla icecream made it all perfect. 
While waiting for your food, u can check out the boutique inside filled with chocolate galore. The bill even came in the cutest chocolate bar like tin. 
I couldn't leave without getting me the chocolate walnut cookie that Dru C wrote about, at the stand where they also display the chocolate pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=4XrN-0eKjrZ_O1MZPwUwDA, cupcakes and chocolate syringes! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=Y_OtGVh8HWQQzXQcHFcZRg
If u like the texture of Mrs Fields cookies, you will love this one which is 10 times better.I can say this is the best cookie i've ever had! It's $5.00, but it's big and super packed with chocolate and every bite is buttery bliss. Just make sure to eat it right away or if you're gonna savor it bite by bite like me and keep putting it away only to open the bag again to take another bite- get an extra bag cuz the grease will seep through- in the good way of course. 

I cannot wait to go back to get myself a couple more cookies and stay for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

*at the Forum Shoppes at Caesar across from the huge ass H and M store. Mens while ur waiting for your girl at the 3 floor H and M, you can get yourself a chocolate syringe and die happy.

Exhilarating pre fixe menu that showcases the chef's masterful culinary skills!

Located in the beautiful themed garden of the Bellagio, the restaurant's sleek blond wood interior was both intimate and inviting.  Set against soft lighting, the dining space was conducive to a festive and celebratory evening with good friends and at first glance of the tasting menu, i was looking forward to the exciting evening ahead. 

The Breads: Warm sourdough & honey wheat rolls came out nice & hot with a side of lightly salted soft butter. The sourdough was my personal favorite with its nice buttery crust and warm chewy center.

Our party of four didn't need much coaxing as we almost instantly decided on the all inclusive chef's tasting menu with wine pairings, which included the famous lobster pot pie!  

Tuna Tartare - Fresh plump ruby red tuna prepared table side with bright vibrant colors that was definitely a sight to see!  The ancho chili and fresh mint pumped up the volume by adding a tangy zing to this remarkable dish and the pine nuts added a pleasant rustic contrast of texture and rounded out the flavor profiles nicely!

Caviar Parfait - Magnificent! Served atop airy light creme fraiche and a crisp potato cake, each bite was magical! The bubbly paired perfectly with this exquisitely enjoyable dish!

Lobster Pot Pie - Outstanding! I was anxiously anticipating this dish and i am happy to admit that it did not disappoint! As soon as the server carved away the warm golden crust, the sweet smell of buttery lobster wafted into the air and i was mesmerized! As i glanced down into my ramekin, i could see chunks of juicy lobster bathed in brandied lobster cream and it made my mouth instantly water!  I simply love pot pie and lobster has always been on my guilty pleasure list, so the combination for me was a match made in foodie heaven! 

American Kobe Rib Eye - Perfection! The kobe beef was exceptionally moist, tender and buttery! Oh, and yes, it melted in my mouth! Hot dayam, what i'd give to sink my teeth into this luscious piece of premium meat again! Let's not forget about the sides! The butter poached porcini was rich and flavorful while the creamed corn was decadence in every bite!

The tasting menu ended with several small dessert items that showcased the chef's whimsical approach to sweets including a magnificent root beer float, a cookie served with hot mulled apple cider, chocolate bon bons, chocolate chip cookies and a glazed chocolate brownie with cocoa nib ice cream & spiced pecans. 

In a few words, it was literally death by chocolate!!!....and oh what a way to die!

The wine pairings were 100% spot on compliments to our meals. With that said, our server was nothing short of professional, helpful, and friendly.  It was great having friendly conversation with everyone but still enjoy the formalities of fine dining.

Prior to dining, my only familiarity with the Katsuya name was from TMZ.  If I were making half a milly per TV episode, this would be in my regular dining rotation too!  The menu's prices are on par with Nobu, Sushi Roku or Blue Ribbon.  

At least those restaurants offer some kind of a chic atmosphere.  Katsuya felt like an upscale diner with a sushi bar plunked in the middle.  The bright lighting, noise from the casino and the constant yelling of "Irashaimase!" over and over and over by employees made this a decisively unsexy spot.  I can't imagine tourists would want this kind of setting for a pricey sushi meal on the strip.  If a booth at Nobu's outpost at Caesars Palace is Kate Upton, it's kind of Rosie O'Donnell here.  Power lunches or corporate dinners? Yes.  Anniversary dinners or bachelorette parties? No!  

For those reasons, my wife and I chose to sit at the bar since the people working there looked like they were having a good time.  All them were super nice and knowledgeable of all things Katsuya. They also made some awesome cocktails to boot.  I loved the "Sahara Cooler" which consisted of Ketel One Oranje vodka, Aperol, passion-fruit pure, fresh lime juice, and Stiegl Radler Grapefruit beer.  That was instant refreshment.  One of the bartenders, whose name escapes me but I remember being a Chargers/Eagles fan, created a wonderful version of a prickly pear cocktail for my wife. 

The plan was to not order items we could get at local, off the strip Japanese spots like Kyara or Raku.  So $8 edamame (shockingly saw lots of people order this), anything from the robata grill ($12 for asparagus with no bacon) and $11 karaage were out of the question.  

Want to know what was?  Rare Wagyu filet with foie gras on top!  So tender and soooo decadent, it was like a story I never wanted to end.  The plum wine sauce reduction really added a nice balance.  Lobster and truffle chawanmushi was another dish I don't see everyday.  Despite the small portion being steamed in a Japanese tea cup, I thought it tasted great and would probably order it again.  Dig in from the bottom for maximum truffle taste.

I thought the Wagyu sashimi seared with hot oil and topped with chives and ginger was very good too.  The oil they used made it taste more like a Chinese dish which was a nice little changeup from the other beef dish.  Seared tuna with Japanese salsa was equally as good.  The high quality of the fish was easy to see as well as taste.

My wife was still hungry and had her eye on the "Wafu Carbonara" which was simply described as "slow-cooked bacon, soy reduction, and soft poached egg".  I tried to talk her out of it since she makes a great version of this dish at home.  Unsurprisingly, I lost that battle.  One of the bartenders assured us this was something worth having and she was right.  The huge chunks of pork belly with bonito flakes and sauce/egg mix just oozing over the ramen noodles was a hearty dish and a nice ending to the meal.

I stopped in to pick up some dinner to-go. After walking in, hubby and I were very confused since they have no signs saying to seat yourself or anything pointing you to a place for to-go orders. The most confusing part was no employees in sight and no menu board?!?! There wasn't anybody else eating inside either, so I had to wonder if this place was really open for business or not. After a couple minutes a woman came out and asked asked if were were eating in or taking out, so I told her we wanted to place a order to-go. She handed us menus and we sat and looked it over. After only a minute she came back to take our order, but I told her we we hadn't been here before and needed a little extra time to look over the menu. She then comes back I swear less than a minute later and asked if we were ready. Ugh. I felt rushed which made no sense since there were no other customers. I just went ahead and ordered some things that caught my eye.

Bean and Cheese Pupusas ($1.95) - The price was great, but not the taste. I wish I tasted more beans and cheese inside instead of the pasty corn flavor this one had. 

Al Pastor Taco ($1.95) - I enjoyed the taco and they were generous with the fillings, but it tasted more like chicken and certainly doesn't stand up against some of the other al pastor around town. 

Fried Plantains ($2.50) - Yum! This was the best part! I really enjoyed the nice sweet flavor.

The lady who helped us was friendly, but pushy about getting our order taken. I really feel they need to put a menu board up and some signage showing customers if they should seat themselves etc. Price was on point and the plantains were good, but everything else was a miss for me.

Homigosh, The Buffet at the Wynn only has 950 yelp reviews? That must be some sort of Yelp record, no?

My friends and I decided to buffet dine at the Wynn since it was our last day in LV together. While all of us were sleep deprived, some were slightly hungover or depressed about not winning big! It didn't matter as we were so excited to eat at this famous buffet.

All I have to say is that this buffet is one of THE best ever. It's worth the wait (as I waited about an hour) and price ($40+) Lunch. Oh, and did I mention bottomless mimosas too for just a few extra bucks?

Look at what the main dining area looks like. Isn't it just simply gorgeous? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=A9lwzLYMlhlQkXyHs611DA

The food is absolutely amazing, as there are sections for breakfast, seafood, and other ethnic foods like Italian, Japanese, Chinese, etc.,
The presentation of the food was absolutely wonderful, and the chefs were hard at work always putting fresh and hot new trays of the highest quality dishes.

Everything I put on my multiple plates (from the eggs benedict, bacon, pasta, grilled fish, mashed potatoes, etc.,) was absolutely outstanding and delish. There wasn't one thing that I didn't enjoy eating. I died and went to heaven when I saw the dessert area. I couldn't stop saying "OH MYLANTA" with all of the cookies, pastries, cakes, and gelato galore. My fav was the pecan pie with a thin layer of chocolate inside the crust and the gelato. Num!
Here are a couple of pics - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=phkc9wlQM4f2D2__GDS87A
Beautiful Gelato and toppings
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=ikMzLsgFM-ipeCq1rsVY0A

The Buffet at the Wynn is definitely a Wynner! Special thanks to Janice C for this awesome suggestion (and even Plan A, which I'll go to another time). This was a memorable lunch buffet with my pals, and cannot wait to go back!

I've been by several times and loved everything I had each time. The employees are very courteous and make you feel like family when you are there. I like how affordable the menu is for the quality of food that you get. For $7.99 I got a "Smoked Brisket Sandwich" and for a few bucks more I made it a combo which included a side and a drink. I also added an additional side of "Cheezy Mac & Cheese" to my order. The brisket is smoked for 18 hours and is the best brisket I have had in town. The meat has such great flavor! When it comes to flavor the beans have it and like the brisket, the beans here are the best I've had in town. The macaroni and cheese was very good too. I'm not the type to eat meat off of the bone, but I did try a rib and I enjoyed every bite! So tender and flavorful! For dessert I had "Banana Pudding" priced at $3.99 and it was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. 

Inside is clean and smells like heaven. So does the parking lot where you can on most days see the man himself outside smoking up some of the tasty meats they offer here. If you want to eat at home they offer a variety of party packs. They will even come to your home and bring their own grills and smokers to cater your event. Call them to find out about the packages they have and pricing. I am going to definitely keep the catering in mind for the future!

Honey Salt is the newest restaurant to open in Summerlin, tucked away in the corner suite that was once occupied by Nora's Wine Bar at the NW corner of Rampart and Charleston.  Offering a menu inspired by comfort food with farm to table ingredients, as well as a seasonal cocktail menu, I can easily see this restaurant becoming a locals favorite.

There are three menus that are available depending on the time of day you dine in.  Lunch is served from 11:30am - 3:00pm (http://honeysalt.com/menus/lunch-menu/), dinner is served from 5:00pm till closing (http://honeysalt.com/menus/dinner-menu/), and there is an "in-between" menu served between lunch and dinner that seems to be a scaled back offering of the lunch options.  I stopped in during lunch and dined at the bar, where I started with a Midnight Rambler: a specialty cocktail made with bourbon, bitters, honey and orange peel.  The honey added just the right amount of sweetness to balance out the drink without overpowering the bourbon; my kind of drink!

For lunch I had their Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich: creamy slaw, durkees dressing, brioche roll, served with a chopped salad (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/honey-salt-las-vegas?select=lQ4mQi9Nm-ycsd6-r2kDIQ#lQ4mQi9Nm-ycsd6-r2kDIQ).  This is a very, very good chicken sandwich.  There are two pieces of chicken that are lightly breaded and very juicy, which gets complimented by pickled and mustard flavors from the other ingredients.  It's one of those dishes that is so good that I'll have to convince myself to order something else the next time I visit...

A big surprise was the salad that is served with this sandwich.  Don't let the "chopped salad" description fool you, it's a salad served with cubed cheddar, edamame, carrots, radishes, avocado and I think kale.  Very good salad that came together well texturally; I would order this on its own if I wanted a lighter meal.

Overall Honey Salt screams quality.  I'm pretty darn sure this review will get bumped to 5-stars after I try some more things on the menu.  Will they be successful?  Time will tell.  Or you could listen to me and eat there now, before word spreads and you're no longer able to walk in without having to wait for a table.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 52/100

Stayed in this hotel with my bf for the first time a few weeks ago and absolutely LOVED IT!

I had never heard of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay before. Apparently it's the nicer of the two towers at Mandalay Bay, and consists entirely of suite-style hotel rooms. 

My bf had booked our stay about four months in advance through Expedia, and he only paid around $110 per night for a HUGE suite for the two of us! It was amazing and you definitely get a bang for your buck!

Parking is free, as with most if not all of the hotels in Vegas. The parking garage is HUGE and has stairs, escalators, and elevators. There's also valet parking and a taxi drop off/pick up area.

Check-in was quick and easy. Lines weren't long and it took us around 5 minutes.

Decor/ambience is really great in this hotel. It doesn't really have a theme like a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's just modern, classy, and trendy. I really liked it!

Elevators were kinda confusing since depending on what floor you're on, you have a certain set of elevators you have to take. However, the elevators are AWESOME and INCREDIBLY fast! We stayed on the 20th floor and it only took a few seconds to get from our room down to the lobby and back!

Our suite was AMAZING. There was a living room area that had a couch, desk, chairs, coffee table, and a huge television! There was also a guest bathroom located right by the door if you have people over. It's a 1/2 bath so just a sink and toilet, but still really awesome! There's also a mini-bar area, but make sure you don't touch any of the items there because they are monitored with a weight system, and you are automatically charged for anything you pick up. 

The bedroom area of our room was really nice. We had an incredible king sized bed with a HUGE wall unit that had a TV in the middle, and his and hers closets on either side of it. The closets even had lights inside to see your clothes, and robes, slippers, hangers, etc.!

Our main bathroom was HUGE! It came with two sinks, toilet, a big shower, and a ginormous bathtub that could fit like 3 people in it. My college dorm room was honestly smaller than this bathroom...it was crazy!

The Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson show plays at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. We didn't watch it, but we plan on watching it during one of our future visits! 

The MIX Lounge at the top of the hotel is supposed to be da bomb. We didn't end up going up there but we saw a ton of people waiting in line to go up.

The ONLY things I didn't love about THEhotel were:

1) LACK OF WIFI IN ROOMS. I think they only had ethernet but that is useless when you only have your smart phone and iPad with you.

2) NO REFRIGERATOR IN SUITE. The bf tried to create a makeshift refrigerator with our ice bucket. Didn't really work...

3) LOCATION. That it's on the far south end of the strip. Like literally the last hotel. Fortunately we drove to Vegas so we used our car to drive further up the strip, but if you don't have a car I can imagine it being a huge issue. It's quite a long walk from THEhotel towards the middle/north end of the strip.

I would definitely stay at THEhotel again and highly recommend it! 5 stars!

As of today, I have dined here 7 times - 3x dinner, 4x lunch.. witnessing various changes to the selection.

::: [ FLAVOR ] ::: 

Standard buffets seem to focus heavily on selection/quantity. Better buffets seem to focus heavily on selection, quantity AND quality. Wicked Spoon might lose in the selection department over others, but focuses on quantity, quality, & one essential but oft overlooked criteria: FLAVOR. 

::: [ TECHNIQUE ] :::

Due to preparation of large batches, many buffets (including Wynn's, which I haven't been back to in 2+ yrs) tend to offer food with less desirable textures due to being left out for too long and/or imperfect cooking temperatures, Wicked Spoon rarely makes that mistake.

::: [ PRESENTATION ] ::: 

Perfectly portioned little bowls/plates. Reduces chance of cross-contamination by other guests and things being mixed around on your own plate. Maintains presentation - consistency in plating technique is a 3.5/5 - 4/5 depending on the station & dish.

::: [ SERVICE ] ::: 

Only experienced poor service 2 out of 7 times. Yesterday's visit was excellent - our server randomly checked up on us at least 4 times throughout our meal.

::: [ DRINKS ] ::: 

Wine & cocktails are available. They also have a selection of Coke products, juices, & ice tea. Don't forget to ask for coffee when you're ready to move on to dessert!

::: [ DIET-FRIENDLY FOOD ] ::: 

I've dieted while dining here twice and was able to get extremely full on less than 700 calories. Also, SUGAR-FREE DESSERTS! You can also request a cup of berries from the dessert station.

I've never written about him before, I have a gay father. Well, technically he's not my real father but a man who I met some years ago. Coming out for me was pretty tough, married, house in the suburbs and a wife who I loved deeply. After coming out to her, my family and friends, my therapist suggested I quickly join an online support group for married gay men, and that's where I met Larry Johnson. A kind older man, Larry immediately took me under his wing; living in San Francisco it was easy for him to show me more about our mutual passion, food.  

Over the years we've exchanged thousands of emails and I've visited him in SF as often as I could, Larry taught me a great deal about fine dining. Including how to have food adventures and about getting the most out of life's pleasures. While my mom will always be my first food hero, Larry will always be my gay dad and has helped to make me who I am today. 

So when he comes into town for a visit I'm always a little stressed out about where to take him for dinner. This visit was easy, I decided to choose something basic and straight forward like steak. Opened 60 years ago, Durant's is not only a Phoenix institution but is also a great steakhouse. While the trend of new steakhouses in the Valley has finally started to taper off, Durant's classic approach is commendable and endearing. I'm talking about fantastically tender steak, understandable sides and professional service. 

Steakhouses in general are probably some of the most expensive restaurants in town. So I was ready to spend a mint on dinner but did notice one thing at Durant's, the steaks aren't ala carte. This means when you order a steak you're not only getting soup or salad but you're also getting your choice of accompaniment, what a value.

Entering Durant's from the rear will take you right through the kitchen, dont worry about this, its all part of the charm. You'll see that the kitchen is spotless and most of the cooks turn around and give you a warm smile and a happy hello. Once you get into the dining room its all old school. Black leather booths, crushed red velour wallpaper and dim lighting all set the mood for a relaxed and subdued dinner experience. 

Ordering the 16 oz Ribeye Steak ($39.50) was an easy choice for most steak lovers. The ribeye for has the perfect amount of marbling to meat ratio, this means that the meat will be really flavorful without being too fatty. I have to tell you, the ribeye at Durant's was one of the best steaks I've had in years. This thick juicy steak was everything that a steak should be, slightly salty with a distinct smoky char and perfectly tender. I also upgraded my side to the Stuffed Baked Potato ($4.95), think twice baked potato. 

Larry's 8oz New York Strip ($29.50) and loaded baked potato were delivered. Not only was the steak perfectly seasoned, it was expertly cooked at medium-rare as requested. 

A silence fell over the table as we enjoyed our meals together. Durant's not only impressed me and me made look good, but they made me proud of our restaurant heritage here in Phoenix. Durant's, thank you.

Oh no! I'm the worst kind of guest. I came, I ate, I drank and I failed to send a thank you card.  I joined a group of fellow Yelpers for a Wednesday Happy Hour. (Jeff E. is awesome at planning Yelp unofficial events.) We rolled our way out fatter and happier.

THE RUNDOWN
+ Has TV? Yes. That's a definite yes! You really can't find a bad seat facing the mega-televisions that border the top of the bar.
+ Huge front patio (perfect for people watching!)
+ The food is over the top generous in size, flavor and character. 
+ Build A Burger is bananas 
+ Wide selection of beers on draft
+ Great for groups

SPECIALS
+ Happy Hour (M-F, 3-7): $4 Local Pints $3 Domestics $4 Prem Wells $5 House Wine & some $5 appetizers
+ Mon: $10 Build Mac-n-Cheese (unlimited toppings!)
+ Tue: $20 House wine & hummus platter
+ Wed: $10 Build A Burger (unlimited toppings!)

THIS BURGER BUSINESS
I like a good challenge. When I heard I could pile on unlimited toppings the game was on. I triple confirmed the pricing on Wednesday is a flat $10 NO MATTER WHAT. Like a speed demon I selected a bun (pretzel!), a protein (angus beef) and a cheese (gruyere). My pencil hovered over veges. (Yes to jalapeos and caramelized onions. No one to kiss that night. Boo! Hiss!) 

I heard someone at my table order avocados on the side. "Ooo! Good idea. Check." While in that section I thought, "Hmmm...what about an egg? You've never had an egg on your burger. WHY NOT?" 

[Shrug]
People. I hadn't been to the gym in three months. What's little bit of caloric love?

At Step Six I tossed in lettuce, tomato and mayo. I circled back and opted for some regular onions. (Again, no prince that night. I like a bit of crunch to my burger.) I topped off my rare burger with a tangy chipotle sauce and a side of sweet potato tots. (Interestingly enough you can top your burger with Steakhouse Herb Butter. How curious!)

God bless our server that night. I have to poll my friends to see if anyone can remember who helped us. She was the Shizzle. Patient, on top of our beer orders like a ninja and sweet as pie. We must have asked one thousand questions.

FIRE FIRE FIRE
While eagerly awaiting my mountain of food Jeff ordered "The Hell Fire Chips". I scoffed when I heard they were hot. Potato chips, buffalo sauce and blue cheese.  

My tongue thanks beer for its many healing powers. Speaking of beer, Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers was serving a Black Butte Porter at the time. I really hope they still have it on tap!

Back to the flame. Ursula had ordered something called TOT CHOS. Think of nachos, layered with chili, sour cream, guac and roasted pepper cheese sauce. Got that? Except the base is on tater tots! Also FIRE. A half order can easily be shared.

When The Burger finally rolled out my eyes opened like saucers. Cutting it with a knife clearly wasn't going to help! It wasn't pretty eating, but, oh boy was it yummy!

There were left overs. Good place. Fun!

Oh! Oh! Oh!
I just heard. The restaurant is still offering the same Yelp check-in offer. $5 off your order! GET IT!

New KoMex location. Same very delicious KoMex food. 

If you haven't tried KoMex yet get down to this location or the original location ASAP. I hated the long almost 1 hr waits at the other location on some days. Yes it's that good. So I'm very happy this one finally opened up. Korean Mexican fusion is an excellent combination. I ordered their Fusion Burrito, my usual order, and inhaled that sucker like I was in a pie eating contest. Why waste time eating 1 yummy thing when I could eat 2 yummy things, didn't do 2 but wanted to. The one thing that you must do is add lots and lots of their hot sauces on anything you get it's a big difference maker but in moderations. I almost ate all 4 of the containers of sauce on my own. It's very good. They should bottle them cause I might want to take some home.

Their fusion tacos, burritos, nachos, fries, etc are served with various meats like spicy pork, pork belly, chicken, and more all come with a Korean/Mexican twist. Even their cheese steak was different, using bulgogi. Check out the pictures and reviews at the original location it will pretty much tell you wassup.

I enjoyed the customer service friendly, complementary chips, salsa, guacamole, fortune cookies, and oranges to end the meal. They were still finishing up construction and decorating, fine tuning things like only cash at the time, 1 out of the 6 menu books at our table was without a menu inside, and temp banner outside but things are looking good. Seems like more space for more seats and even a bar area. I'll probably be back before the weeks over. No I will definitely be back before the weeks over.

Located in the same plaza as BabyStacks Cafe and Hikari SW Buffalo and Flamingo.

Did I mention that they're pretty cheap in price.

Bacchanal Buffet, the highly touted buffet in Las Vegas I coveted. Family and friends have indulged. It was my turn =)

No wait time! Wednesday at 6pm. YES!!

I was seated immediately and my drink order placed. It was time to indulge. 

I scoped out each station, taking mental notes of what looked good. 
I decided on the seafood station for my first plate. 
My second plate was from the carving station (BBQ & Prime Rib this evening)
My third plate was from the cheese & cured meat station. 
Last but not the least, Dessert. 

My food rating of each dish:
GREAT DISHES
*Lamb Chops - tender, perfectly cooked medium rare, yum!! Get the mint jelly too. 
*Shrimp Cocktail - Big pieces of shrimp. Not over cooked like most shrimp cocktails, perfect. 
*Goat cheese with fig - wow, wow, WOW!
*Mushroom & Truffle Soup - this was decadent, creamy with that earthy richness, Yum!!

GOOD DISHES
*Oyster Shooter - the oyster was just okay, but the liquid it came in was delicious. Cucumber juice?
*Brisket - I asked for the fatty part, yum!  Melds in you mouth goodness. I didn't see any BBQ sauce though. 
*Polenta - the only thing I got from the Italian station. 
*Wagyu Slider - delicious. It would have been better with mayo. (Which I found after I ate it)
*Mango Pudding - the coconut jelly made this dish good!!
*Coconut Calamansi Dacqoise - I don't know what a "Dacqoise" is, but it was like a macaron to me. Lol. 
*Beignet - great with coffee, just too sweet. 

OKAY DISHES
*Raw Oyster - it would have been better if it was sucked better. The oyster was still attached to the shell and a lot of shell bits in the oyster itself. 
*Prime Rib - the medium rare parts were good, other parts were very chewy. 
*Creme Brle - not too sweet, yum. 
*Goat cheese with basil - good flavor!!

BAD DISHES
*BBQ Pork Spare Ribs - too salty & not tender. 
*Jonah Crab Claws - even though they were pre cracked, it was still hard to eat. The crab meat was stuck to the shell. Over cooked. 
*Mint Gelato - first gelato I asked for was pistachio, I got "Mint" instead. Since I ask for 3 other flavors, by the time I got to my table, the mint had started to melt and ruined the other 3. Oh, I don't like mint ice cream / gelato. 

Info: The plates are HOT. Super hot. Be careful. If you want cold plates, get them from the salad station. 

Service was good. 

Suggestions: it was hard to get some of the dishes. For example the soups. The clearance between the pot and the shelves on top of it was too low. It was hard not to spill the soup because the ladle was hitting the shelving. 

The flow of some of the food station was also a bit off for me.

I didn't get anything from the Chinese & Mexican stations, I was too full. Lol. 

The food here was good, I definitely indulged, okay, over indulged. Lol. 

Solid 4 Stars. 
Try it for yourself and decide.

I have reviewed other In-N-Out Burger locations, so it seemed strange I didn't have a review for this location since it is the one I most frequent (at least once a week). Seems more like "creeper fishy" to me, but anyways. This location is my favorite. I have been eating here since it opened and have never once had an issue. Consistency is clearly something In-N-Out Burger focuses on. The inside is always very clean as well the restrooms. The line inside as well the drive-thru can be crazy, but it's worth it. If eating inside it is best to go in with others so you have someone to order and get drinks so the other can scout out a spot to sit. The booths are hard to come by at peak times. The parking can fill up too, but recently they have added orange cones so there isn't as much congestion between the parking area and the drive-thru. 

Everybody pretty much knows the secret menu at In-N-Out Burger isn't so secret anymore. I love that the menu is so simple. When you know how to make something right, you don't need a large menu. Hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries, shakes and drinks are what you will find here! For me this last visit (and pretty much every visit) I had a "Grilled Cheese W/Grilled Onions" (no lettuce) and it was perfect. Sometimes I get extra tomato, extra grilled onions or even ask that they add mustard. I also ordered "Animal Style Fries" and was glad hubby helped me eat them because it was a decent size. The chilies here are good and you can get them chopped on your burger or just on the side to munch on.  If you like to spoil your pooch then order a "Flying Dutchman" for them and they will thank you :)

FINALLY!! I've been waiting for this location to open f-o-r-e-v-e-r! With the location on the Strip closing, it couldn't have come at a better time. Walking in I saw the usual lines for adobada, asada, etc. You have to pay attention to the signs so you know what line to get in. I only ever get adobada, so I usually go straight to that line and hubby usually goes straight to the asada line. Sometimes I do feel like an asada taco, so hubby just gets mine when he gets his and that saves time and my food from getting cold. This last visit the line wasn't bad at all and the place had a good amount of heads in it. I only waited maybe 5 minutes in the adobada line and hubby waited less than that in his line. The wait time will no doubt change depending on the day at time, but the wait is worth it. I had an "Adobada Taco" ($2) and an "Adobada Mulas" ($4, I requested mine to me made on flour tortillas) and they were both so good! I asked for them both with pineapple and the dude hooked me up with a fair amount. The adobada has such great flavor and is very addicting! The taste just keeps you wanting more. They do have seating inside, but I noticed they are working on the other part of the building, so maybe they will add more seating there?? That will be good for those who like to eat inside, but a lot of people, myself included, just eat at our cars. They offer a variety of meats including asada, adobada, lengua, sesos, buche, tripa, suadero and chorizo. You can get any of these meats in a taco, mulas, tostadas, vampiro, sopes and even over fries. This place is absolutely legit when it comes to tacos and I'll be a regular for sure!

When I saw their signature Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles platter on a Las Vegas television show one night I knew I had to try this.  As my buddies stopped into the Imperial Palace casino to throw away a little more cash I decided a mid day feast was in order.  I imagined this place would get pretty crowded, but at 4:30 in the afternoon on a weekend this restaurant was surprisingly empty.

My buddies later told me they were concerned that a huge meal a day before the marathon would hamper their performance.  I'm a slower runner than they are though so my only concern was to finish the race and have fun doing it.

Back to the restaurant I was greeted and offered a seat at the bar or a table.  I noticed an attractive vixen sitting alone at the bar so I decided I was going to go there and offer her a bit of companionship.  As I sat comfortably into my seat I couldn't help but notice this dainty young lady was eating from two giant platters of food.  She acknowledged my presence, turned to me, smiled, greeted me and told me she's a dancer and hadn't eaten all day.  Don't mind my stare, lady!  I'm not checking out your perfect physique, but I do have an eye on the humongous burger on your plate.  Wait!  Do all showgirls eat like this?

I finally picked up my menu.  They offer fresh squeezed fruit juices in 10 ounce and 20 ounce glasses so I went with a fresh tangerine juice, but I'm sitting at a bar, and how does one not have a beer when they're sitting at a bar?  I selected a Pyramid Apricot Wheat Ale (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=I1ZZCzT_lKHJ_YthVtc-Cw) and ice water knowing all to well I needed to stay hydrated for the run ahead.

I took a quick glance at the food menu although I knew exactly what I wanted to try the minute I walked into the restaurant.  I selected the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  The service here was outstanding.  Every time the bartender left his station he'd return and give me an update on my food.

I had a crappy camera with me at the time, but this is what I had (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=BagiL1VmvJTeDz_CIsty3w).  It's two huge chicken breasts partial bone attached battered and fried and sitting on an angle atop four squares of bacon-stuffed Belgian waffles drizzled in hot maple syrup.  That's right.  The waffles are stuffed with crispy bacon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=t2IoUrYE-c7cIHRBxkk6ow)!

The weight of the two chicken pieces quickly gave way to gravity as they fell onto the plate.  The chicken breast was amazingly juicy and the crispy batter was well seasoned.  The waffles were fluffy and chewy and I hadn't even gotten to the crispy bacon yet.  This signature dish definitely lived up to its hype.  This was outstanding.  I had to sit awhile after nearly finishing that entire platter.

The dancer did better than I did taking what little food she left in a to-go box.  As she turned, smiled and bid me farewell I couldn't help but notice how gracefully she walked out the door.  I was so stuffed you might have been able to tip me over on my side and rolled me out the door!

Las Vegas dancer or not, this time next year at 4:30 in the afternoon I will be back!

Have you often wondered why so many middle-aged  Japanese people here in Las Vegas always tell you that they go to SUSHI ON RAINBOW for sushi instead of the multi-million dollar bankrolled sushi restaurants like Kabuto or Goyemon? Why do these former or current Japanese nationals prefer to eat at an older sushi bar that doesn't have fancy or exciting dcor? The answer is that SUSHI ON RAINBOW to MANY of us people of Japanese descent is actually a symbol of pride for our community. And, the owner is a very respected man to us Japanese-Americans.

When I was a little kid in Southern California, I first heard about Shogo-san and the famous sushi restaurant in Newport Beach. Sushi just did not exist in the area. Everytime a sushi restaurant poped up, it would quickly go out of business. Remember that sushi, and the idea of eating raw fish was not accepted by the American mainstream back then. The sushi bar that Shogo worked at was the only sushi bar in the area that had made it. Japanese people would drive 50+ miles just to eat there. Shogo-San was one of the 1st generation sushi chefs, along with the famous Ichiro Mashita who came to America from Japan with a dream to one day popularize sushi in America. They had to endure so much hardships during those days, but like most Japanese and Asian-Americans during that era, they fought hard to find success in the land of opportunity. Today, there is a Sushi bar on every street due to their labor. So, when I found out that Shogo had purchased SUSHI ON RAINBOW from the original owner, I was ecstatic! A great legend of California Sushi was now here in Las Vegas! This was a dream come true. 

Shogo-san has over 40 years of Sushi experience. During his youth in Kyushu, he was a very respected edo style sushi chef. Went through years of apprenticeship before he even get the opportunity to the touch the actual fish. Today, his years of experience really shows. Though the majority of his day revolves around making California Rolls for westerners, there is also a "secret menu" for those who appreciate real sushi. What I love is how every week they got something different. I've had an Edo Chirashizushi, Shinko, Engawa, a Uni-Ika mix, Maguro no Zuke, Yamaimo, and many other traditional Japanese dishes that aren't in any other J-restaurant in town. Every time I eat here I feel even more proud to have Japanese blood in my veins. 

Unlike most sushi bars in LV, SUSHI ON RAINBOW get's all it's items from true Japanese and Japanese-American distributors. The fish is from a real Japanese seafood distributor(not a Korean distributor), that get's their fish from cold waters such as Canada, and Alaska. Fish from colder waters will have meat that has more of that fatty marbling that we enjoy so much. Even the Japanese ice creams(plum wine, green tea) come from a famous Japanese ice cream company in Torrance.  

If you are a true sushi lover, the 1st thing you will notice is how Shogo's nigiri technique is unrealistically perfect compared to the other Sushi joints in town. Remember that he has had over 40 years experience. You will see immediately that even the chefs at Kabuto don't have his precision. And the funniest thing is that Shogo is very humble + modest and doesn't even brag about how great he is.

There used to be a guy named Hiro-san who worked here who was also a former edomaezushi chef from Japan.  Holy crap, that guy was like the best chef I had ever seen. But, he retired a few months ago. That totally depressed the hell out of me. 

Kyuu-chan is their new apprentice sushi chef. He is of Chinese descent but he makes a lot of Japanese chefs look like amateurs due to his amazing talent. Shogo is such a a hardcore Japanese man, that he made Kyuu learn how to speak Japanese to be a chef here. He also made the Latino cooks in the back learn Japanese, or they couldn't work. It's the coolest thing ever! There is so much old school Japanese discipline in this kitchen. But, Shogo himself is such a friendly and positive guy. You can talk to him for hours. And the coolest thing about him is that he knows everything about Japanese history and pop culture! I've had the most fascinating conversations with him.

I love coming to SUSHI ON RAINBOW and showing my respect to these great Japanese heroes. Also, every time I come here it's like that scene in "Goodfellas" when Robert DeNiro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they get him whatever he wants, and they even got a spot saved for him. I NEVER order here, all I say is "Omakase" and they take care of everything for me. 

I've written 100s of Yelp reviews, but SUSHI ON RAINBOW is my absolute favorite restaurant in not just Las Vegas, but the whole world.

YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!! FINALLY! This location has been set to be a Tommy's for a longggggg time, but I guess there was an issue with the billboard being too close to the building or something. Who cares why it is open now!!!!!

There isn't much parking directly out front of this Tommy's (there is handicapped parking) however this Tommy's shares the whole parking lot with the rest of the shopping center and it isn't a far walk at all. If you are a true Tommy's fan the few extra steps wont kill you and since you are likely to be eating chili here you can use those few extra steps! There is also a drive-thru. It appears that because the drive-thru has little space that they only put in the few spots up front to detour accidents and want customers to park in the shared shopping center spaces.

It didn't surprise me to see this place packed when I walked in. There was a long line of hungry customers. I got in line while hubby kept an eye out to snag a table. The girl who took my order was very friendly and repeated my order to make sure it was right. I then made my way to fill up our drinks while the order was being made and grab some good ole Tommy's napkins. The napkins here are more like paper towels and necessary when eating here! 

The food was ready and I was ready to dig in! I ordered a #4 "Chili Cheese Dog, Fries and drink" priced at $8.55 after requesting my drink be a large and adding chili, cheese, mustard and onion to the fries. Yum! I had to cut the chili dog in half and share it because it was hearty. The fries were delicious and held up the chili and other toppings perfectly. Hubby ordered the "Caliente Burger Combo" and gobbled it up. Our friend ordered a "Chili Tamale" priced at $3.25 and he really enjoyed it. We left very full and satisfied! 

Anybody who has been to the original location at Beverly and Rampart knows the nostalgia that goes with that location. There will never be another like it, but we can certainly be thankful to have a location right here in Las Vegas to go to and make memories. Thank You Tommy's for branching out of California and making your presence in Nevada!

Heard about the 16 oz Ribeye for 12.99 here so of course I had to investigate. It's a tough job but hay, somebody has to do it!

As you come in, the bar is the first thing you run into. That's great if you want to eat and drink while inhaling second hand smoke. Just go around to your left and into the actual dining room where there is about 6 booths and 3 tables.

If you are lucky, you just might get Holly as your server. She is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and she provides great service. The vibe I got from her was all positive. It seemed to me like she actually enjoyed her job. Needless to say, I knew I was going to give her a generous tip when it was all said and done.

As promised, I ordered the 12.99 1 pound Ribeye which comes with your choice of Fries or Onion Rings (I got the Onion Rings and man, they were so good!). I also added a side salad which is only a dollar more with any meal. I ordered the Ribeye medium rare topped off with my request of sauted onions and mushrooms. I assume they have been offering this Ribeye deal for a while now because my steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it. It was so juicy and  tender that my wife was kicking herself for not ordering it. Refer to my pic of the inner portion of my exquisite piece of meat. To me, that's how all steak should be cooked and look like when its cut apart.

My wifey ordered the Pretzel appetizer (which is funny because it could be a meal in itself cuz its so huge!) Comes with 3 sauces. Hot mustard, Jalapeno Cream Cheese, and Nacho Cheese infused with Beer! Now that last sauce was kind of weird but definitely a change of pace if you have never had it.

Now probably the only obvious thing that stood out as a negative for me was that even though we were in the supposed "Non Smoking" dining section, you can still smell the smoke coming in from the bar. At the time of our dining experience, I smelled only a little bit of smoke and when we got home, some of the smell was on our clothing. I can only imagine that on really busy nights, the smoke factor would be even worse and that your clothes will smell like an ashtray full of cigarette butts later on.

So if you are ever craving steak, especially Ribeye, then Jacksons Bar and Grill is the place for you! Doesn't matter if it's 11 pm at night or 9 am breakfast time, you can get it at any time because these guys are 24/7!

Tucked away in the strip mall, this small Cuban bakery has been overlooked and undervalued by many who don't frequent the area or knows very little about the cuisine. Once inside, there are only six small tables. The red tablecloths, glass dessert counter, tiled floors, and bright natural lighting coming through the doors nicely accentuated the dcor. Fellow Yelper Kurdy S and I were the only non-Spanish speaking customers during this afternoon. Like many of the nearby restaurants, the atmosphere was fitting as a casual lunch spot.

For appetizer, we shared the Tostones Rellenos de Roja Villeja ($4.49). The plate came with four fried green plantains holding a small scoop of tender shredded beef on top. The plantains had great texture on the outside to add to the soft green banana flavor on the inside. The beef was tender, flavorful, complex, and very nicely seasoned. I can eat these all day long.

We also had a side order of Plantanos Maduro Fritos ($2.49) that came with soft bananas served piping hot, perfectly fried, and sweet. It was nicely glazed, but also unexpectedly oily. 

Next, the Cuban Sandwich ($6.95) came with shredded beef, ham, and mustard. The bread had an awesome crunch with an excellent secondary chew. The sandwich was big enough to share and the dish also came with French fries. The way they kept it simple without all the fillers made this one of the best Cuban Sandwiches I've had so far.

Finally, the Filete a la Plancha ($9.99) came with a big serving of grilled sole, black bean rice, and salad. The sole was fresh, moist, tender, and had good flavor but slightly over salted. The black bean rice had great flavor and moisture--much better than the one at Victor's 1959 Caf. The lightly dressed salad provided a nice change of pace to the sole.

Antithetical to the cuisine's longstanding stereotype of being bland, this place simply rocks. Service however, was friendly but also inattentive, offbeat, and at times awkward. For instance, the food and bill took forever to come, and our water was never refilled even though the restaurant was not busy. Despite the shortcomings, interested diners should still come for the impressive lineup of dishes and great prices. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their other seafood and chicken items followed by their great looking desserts.

I'm a fan of Papa Murphy's. Some people are weird about buying pizza and sides that they have to bake at home, but that's just some people being weird. There is usually some type of deal going on and they send coupons in the mail, so with any type of deal it is really worth it considering what a frozen pizza costs and tastes like. You can call your order ahead or stop in and watch them make it fresh. You can choose lighter or extra sauce, cheese and toppings to customize the pizza to your liking. The employees inside this Papa Murphy's are friendly and helpful with going over specials, but when I went on grand opening day, the people there from Sunny 106.5 were very rude and didn't help represent Papa Murphy's well. I was actually relieved to find out it was the radio station being so rude and not the actual Papa Murphy's employees because it would have detoured me from going back. I did score a free pizza (the very last one, nice!) because they were giving out 100 free pizzas to customers that day. 

They have pizzas of all shapes and sizes. They have the mini-murph pizza kit to take home so your kids can put together a pizza for themselves and then see their creation after it bakes. The pizzas also come in signature, pan, delite and stuffed crusts. Most of the pizzas bake at 425 and only take around 10 minutes aside from the stuffed pizza which takes around 25 minutes. The pan pizza is definitely good, but beware when cooking the pan pizza and keep your eye on it because there is butter or something at the bottom of that one and it can burn easy if you let it go too long and when you take the pan pizza out of the oven it's really hot, so let it stand for 5 minutes before slicing. The cheesy bread comes in regular and thicker sizes, both being equally delicious. With a coupon I usually pay about $6 or $7 for a pizza and adding 2 sides it's $6, not including the thicker cheesy bread. One thing I tried on my last visit that I hadn't before is the s'mores dessert pizza. Wow that thing was good! I preferred the s'mores pizza much more than the chocolate chip cookie dough they offer and it is a great price as one of the 2 sides you can pick. My hubby likes the cookie dough here, but I personally do not. If you are signed up for the e-club they usually send you a coupon for free cookie dough on your birthday. They also have pumpkin shaped pizzas at Halloween time and heart shaped pizzas for Valentine's Day, usually at a special price that I like to pick up. All in all this is a decent take-n-bake pizza spot.

You have got to be kidding me!!!

What narcissistic nincompoop came up with this idea?

This has just topped my list of "Most Asinine Restaurants in all of Las Vegas." and my list of "Stay the hell away - far away!" at the same time.

3 people, no drinks, one order of tacos each (4) and a very small Queso Fundito appetizer for $75 - THAT'S SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS FOR A DOZEN STREET TACOS AND BLAND CHEESE!

First off, the restaurant is so cold I was shivering - AND I'M FROM FARGO 'FRICKING' NORTH DAKOTA.

The the Queso Fundito came to the table luke warm, which meant the cheese was already almost solid. We got the one with mushrooms, and they didn't taste bad, but cold Queso Fundito just sucks, period. It came with a spoon, which is absolutely the worst utensil to use when trying to cut semi-hard cheese.

Question: does anyone besides me remember when you could order your entire meal at the beginning and the kitchen would have enough sense to send out the appetizer first and give you some time before sending out the rest? Boy I miss those days. 

We ordered our appetizer, but weren't ready to order the tacos. The waitress kept coming by (without our appetizer) to ask if we were ready, so we politely ordered, hoping enough time had passed that our appetizer could arrive and we could have a few minutes to enjoy it before our small table was overrun by plates.

Boy were we wrong. Not more than 1 minute after the Fundito arrived, I got my tacos - just mine, apparently no one thinks people like to eat together anymore. So now my tacos are getting cold while I try to finish the Fundito before it turns back into a hard brick of cheese. 

The other orders came 5 to 6 minutes apart. These people are completely incompetent.

I will not say the food was bad, but I will say that Pepe's Tacos offers MUCH better tacos at 1/3 the price. 

This place is PURE SHIT, an absolute waste of a great location and an awesome remodeling by Red Rock. I can already see by the other Yelp reviews that most people agree. 

Pay $75 to have some tourist on the Las Vegas Strip slap you three times in the face, it will be a much better use of your money.

**Review #600: The single best meal I've ever experienced**

To celebrate our one year wedding anniversary, my wife and I ate a feast fit for  royalty at Chef Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak. 

Located inside the MGM Grand, Craftsteak is a dimly lit, elegantly decorated high end steak house. 

The menu at CS is littered with amazing sounding salads, sides, steaks, seafood, desserts and more. Instead of trying one or two things, my wife and I decided to make this meal a memorable one and partake in their Domestic Wagyu tasting, which included a grand total of FOURTEEN dishes in three courses.  Ready?? Here we go;

Course 1- The Warm UP:
Warm Bread Topped W/ Sea Salt http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=znEnAclXg1MNjKCJeOx-pQ

Farmers Market Fruit Plate  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=iPcZn31A-sZQZdAPIT5Yzw

Everything and I mean EVERYTHING we ate was phenomenal. Not one dish disappointed me. I've had many meals in my life and this one now ranks as the biggest and best yet. The salads were great. The meat was juicy and melted in my mouth. The sides were fantastic and the desserts were mind blowing. I did have some favorites, which I'll list below. 
My favorite dishes in the first course were the tartare and the warm Frise salad.
My favorite dishes in the second course were the Wagyu ribeye and the Yukon Gold Puree (best mashed potatoes EVER). 
My favorite dessert was the cinnamon monkey bread.

The service here was top notch. We had two separate servers, both of whom were friendly and attentive. Both answered any questions we asked and trust me, we had a few.  

The price for the Wagyu tasting menu was $140 a person, which was not bad considering the massive amount of incredible food we received. In all honesty, I could not afford to do this on a weekly (or even monthly) basis but since I got lucky the night before at the Roulette tables, this meal only set me back about thirty dollars of my own money. Thanks, Vegas. 

If you ever have the opportunity to dine at Craftsteak, even if you can't afford a steak tasting (tastings start at $100 a person), then just order off their regular menu. I can't highly recommend Craftsteak enough. This truly was THE BEST meal I've ever had in my entire life.

Darden Restaurants has recently made a renewed effort to improve the offerings of their Italian inspired Olive Garden. 

We were so impressed, we might be back soon. Really. 

Given the likes of Macaroni Grill, Johnny Carino, Carrabba, Buca di Beppo, Spaghetti Factory (to some extent Margiano's), they have all been stealing market share away from Olive Garden, the so called king of Americanized Italian food. 

Tired of being a late night comedy punching bag, Darden recently made a wholesale upgrades to their menu and I believe brought out their "A Game". http://investor.darden.com/m/#deepLink/%7B%22view%22%3A%22PressReleaseDetails%22%2C%22languageId%22%3A%221%22%2C%22itemId%22%3A%225f329c57-9e8f-469a-8482-758db3cc9d1f%22%2C%22year%22%3A%222014%22%7D. 

If you have somehow missed the differentiation for some of these Italian themed concepts, both Carrabba's and Macaroni Grill aim for a higher demo group. And not a lot has changed over the last ten years since the Times wrote: 

"Carrabba's Italian Grill and Romano's Macaroni Grill, are both far behind Olive Garden in the full-service Italian restaurants... Although both chains are significantly smaller and are outspent by Olive Garden, they aim at a somewhat different customer: one who is willing to spend a bit more on a meal. Reflecting that higher-end positioning, Carrabba's and Macaroni Grill both used chefs to promote their brand." http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/25/business/media-business-advertising-spots-for-carrabba-s-macaroni-grill-try-pull-away.html 

Clearly there's no shortage of opinions regarding which one of these concepts are your favorite. http://www.disboards.com/archive/index.php/t-2641561.html. 

So with all this in mind, we decided to give this former Pillsbury concept another try.  

We arrive on a Friday night around seven-fifteen. Most of the families with small kids were just finishing their entrees. This restaurant actually has a section in the back, cordoned off from the regular patrons for families. Nice. 

We were seated pretty quickly. Our waitress Rebbecca greeted us, asked us about drinks and if we wanted water with our meal. 

One of their menu items, is a choice of six or nine ounce carafes of their house wines.  Rebbecca offered us a tasting from the bottle of Riesling she brought to our table. Clever marketing, very clever. 

We decided to share a 9 oz carafe, skipping appetizers and starting with their famous never ending Salad Bowl (see photo). It's still including in the price of your dinner btw, or soup if you prefer.

My friend Marvin A wrote about Olive Garden as...  "Their Dreck will not make you ill. It'll simply remind you ...... what BLAH Drive-In Dreck taste like. SpaghettiOs would of been a welcomed sight, last night." 

Prior to this evening's experience, we would have tended to agree.  

But the Italian Trio (photo) and Grilled Chicken (photo) were tasty and just as good the next day when we reheated them. LOL

In many ways, Olive Garden is still just a safe, standby type of place. But as you might have noticed, this is a Four Star review. Clearly Darden wants to be taken seriously and this is their best effort to date. 

So is Olive Garden better than Romano's Macaroni Grill, or Carrabba's? True-fully, I don't know. But we had a nice time and the food was good. 

So Four Stars and expect to pay around $30.00 each

Dona Maria Tamales Restaurant has been a local family owned business in Vegas for over 30 years. I ate here a few times growing up and didn't like it so when a friend suggested that hubby and I meet for dinner here I was hesitant, but figured why not give it another shot after so long. 

We were seated next to the bar (bar was dead) and service was very good. We were started off with the usual suspects... Chips & salsa. The chips were good however the salsa had no kick at all and was very sweet, almost like it was just a can of thinned tomato paste. Gross! 

All dinners are served with a soup or salad. I chose the "Tortilla Soup" and it actually didn't taste bad. I ordered the #29 "Taco and Enchilada" priced at $13.50 plus an additional $2.15 because I wanted carnitas in my taco. The beans and rice that accompanied my meal were either under a heat lamp for too long or reheated. The beans were crunchy and hard around the edges and the had no good flavor. The rice was pretty much the same. The green sauce on my enchilada had great flavor it was just that the enchilada itself wasn't that great. It was edible, but the tortilla was stiff. The carnitas had good flavor, but again I wasn't crazy about the tortilla. Our friend ordered the #14 "Chile Relleno and Enchilada" priced at $13.50 and they thought it was decent. Hubby ordered the #27 "Fajitas Dona Maria" (beef) priced at $14.75 and said that he's had better.

I wanted to try the "Churros" priced at $5.50 for dessert. It was presented well, but all of the cinnamon sugar was on the plate not on the churros. These churros were very dry and not worth a penny. 

Though I have no plans to purposely come back here, I did give it 2 stars because the service really was very good and I did enjoy my soup. I believe they try hard to do something good here at Dona Maria Tamales Restaurant, it just isn't good enough for me.

They claim to be knows for their "Tamales" and even though I haven't tried them here, I have heard from people that they are worth picking up. Prices are $3.95 each, $14.25 for a half dozen, and $19.25 for a dozen. They offer the following tamales:

Red - pulled pork in a mild sauce
Green - shredded chicken in hot sauce
Cheese - monterrey jack, green chilies and onions
Sweet - pineapple and raisins ($3.30 each)

After my outstanding experience here, it goes without saying that Wolfgang Puck's take on steaks is a "cut" above the rest!

Tucked inside the Palazzo resort, Cut exhibited a refined contemporary appeal and warmth that was both inviting and comforting.  I especially enjoyed the service by Tara who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. 

After allowing us to peruse the menu for awhile, she returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts and I must say, they all looked enticing! 

Shortly after, we were served our wine and breads, which included the usual steakhouse suspects of fragrant & savory onion focaccia, pretzel roll, one of my personal favorites, mainly because of the firm outside texture and soft and chewy inside... and it wasn't too salty like most other pretzel breads I've come across. 
Parmesan bread stick took a close second  place for its addictive light, crisp & crunchy texture with a generous coating of Parmesan breading on the outside.

Bone Marrow Appetizer - From the buttery soft marrow to the warm, flavorful mushroom sauce, it was a blissful combination of ingredients and love. Simply unbelievable. If there's one single dish from this entire trip, I will be craving for months afterwards, it will definitely be this!

Steak Tasting 
American Kobe Style from snake river - paired with a house steak sauce. The beef was perfectly tender and seared beautifully leaving my mouthwatering for another juicy bite. The tangy flavor of the steak sauce was a perfect addition to the meat as it brought on a bright acidity to the steak. Let it be known, I'm determined to get the recipe for that irresistible sauce!!!!
USDA prime dry aged - much softer and juicier than the New York, this cut of steak was praiseworthy in every way. Honestly, it was a cut of perfection on a plate and the accompanying chimichurri sauce added a brightness to my palate that made it all the more satisfying. 
Australian wagyu from Blackmore -
Worthy of it namesake, was truly the best of the best. It's like they took 50 steaks and concentrated all the beefiness into one bite. The best steak I've ever had. It came with a barnaise sauce but honestly this piece needed nothing to dress it. It was perfect all on its own.

White corn had a fresh & crunchy bite with a slightly sweet caremelized exterior that added a pleasant rustic flavor to the dish 

Dessert
Baked Alaska - Tasted like a giant strawberry mochi. Btw, that's a good thing!  It also came with a small lemon bar, which had a lip puckering natural citrusy flavor!

Banana Creme pie came with chocolate ice cream, sauce, and chocolate crunch pearls. Now that's what I call a triple chocolate threat! Having said that, It was surprisingly mild and less cloyingly sweet, which I really enjoyed.

Before we left, Tara gave us more sweets in the form of a chocalate truffle cookie bar and a chewy peanut brittle...both were absolutely delicious! 

Service was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. But i'd have to say Tara made all the difference! She transformed a pleasant meal to an unforgettable dining experience with her natural charm and warm tableside manner, which easily made the evening five stars in my book!

Bravo to CUT for an exquisite meal and extraordinary service! 

You bet ill be back for an encore! 

Until then...

Happy Eats!

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Warning! Going to Sam Fox Restaurants for Happy Hour after a movie can be habit forming. 

We have heard many good things about this Italian farmhouse concept, but we were little hesitant given that we found the lunch at North in Kierland just okay.  Our caution however, was unwarranted.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
We arrived around four-thirty and the parking lot was mostly empty. Were they open we thought? But as we approached the front door, it was opened by a hostess and we were invited in. Nice.  

We said we had come for the Happy Hour and were escorted not to the bar, but to some tables along the back wall. We were given menus, both Dinner and HH and heard a brief explanation of the fish special. Very cozy and very nice. I have taken a few photos of the inside of the restaurant.  The mood is upscale and dare I say 'hip".

MENU:
Like other Fox places, the HH menu is more of a starting point of samplers. For instances, if you like HH serving of freshly made meatballs and spaghetti, then maybe you'll like the lager dinner serving.

The HH menu has about a dozen items, mostly in the $5.00 - $8.00 range.  They have Caesar Salad, Arancini, Pizza of the Day $8, Chef's Board of meats and cheese $10, Zucca chips $3.  Two holdovers from other restaurants are the Castelvetrano Olives $3 and Spiced Nuts $2. These two look similar to the Olive & Ivy's offering. http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-and-ivy-scottsdale#hrid:XB-E39WNviGs1MkkQ4XIxw

As you would expect, they also have all beers and well drinks priced at $4.00 to $5.00.  But what we found special, are all their wines marked at 50% off.  They will also re-cork it for you to go.

Here are links to the menus:

http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/North_40th_Dinner_Menu2.pdf

SERVICE:
We found the service to be very professional.  Yes, the water glasses were refilled on a timely basis, but also the wait staff comes by and chats with you about your food and answers any questions you have very knowledgeably.  We actually got into a very detailed discussion on Washington State wines and Oregon Pinots with our server Vail.

FOOD:
We started off by ordering a Washington State Chardonnay, but found they didn't have any chilled.  We then opted instead for the Snoqualmie Riesling, which was somewhat sweet, with a hint of cherries.

We tried the HH Caesar Salad for $5.00 and the HH Spaghetti, also for $5.00. The salad came with some of the most delicious croutons that had a smokey taste we have ever had.  A definite must.  The spaghetti was equally interesting and flavorful.  The meatballs must be cooked in a marinara, and has a complexed layering taste which was different than the pasta sauce, which has a hint of fennel. Wow.

Next we ordered the Margherita Pizza ($11.00) off the Dinner menu, see photos. It was very good but we found the cheese slipped off when you bit into a wedge. 

For dessert, we each ordered the Gelato scoop for $3.00 and the Tiramisu for $6.00, both off the dinner menu.  I've taken pictures of the Titamisu.  It came in a glass ramekin with an amazing amount of delicious mascarpone cheese and flavorful Kahlua.

PRICES:
Our petite Happy Hour dinner of six items, ran us $41.50 before taxes and gratuities.  It also included the bottle ($23.00, 50% off) of Riesling, which our wonderful server Vail re-corked for us. As we left, the parking lot was full with a dozen cars waiting to be parked.

Enjoy!

I noticed after this visit just how much the price has changed when it comes to a brunch buffet. Generally brunch costs more than breakfast, lunch or dinner, but not here at the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station. Brunch on Sunday runs around $9.99 (same price for dinner during the week) with a players card. After being seated I noticed how dirty the highchair was that my nephew was in. I'm talking all sorts of food on either side of it. I cleaned it up with some wipes his mom had with her, but this highchair looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. Our server was great and checked on us often. Even with the big group we had at our table she kept the dishes cleared and brought us refills without us ever having to ask. 

They brunch buffet has the usual stuff. Different breakfast and lunch option at the same time. I walked by the pizza as it was coming out so I figured that was a good time to get some of that. It tasted OK, but definitely tasted like a frozen pizza that was made. They do have a pizza oven right there and you can watch it cook, but it wasn't anything I'd ever go out of my way for. The bacon was hard and tasted microwaved. Scrambled eggs weren't bad or the mini waffle I had. The hash browns were a soggy mess with some burnt crispy parts. I did enjoy the mac & cheese even if it tasted like Kraft deluxe. The breakfast sausage looked good, but tasted nasty. I brought back an assortment of desserts for our table to try and they were terrible! All of the pastries were hard which was a disappointment. I will say that the salad bar had a lot of options including fresh fruit and it all looked good. I enjoyed what I had from the salad bar area much more than anywhere else at the buffet. This buffet could use many changes and isn't really worth it until then in my opinion. 

Kids 2 and under are free.

Izakaya Cocokala's menu reflects a lot of what would be found at a typical street corner izakaya in Japan with a couple of wrinkles from the norm.  I was excited to check it out.  Things were looking even better when I was the only non-Japanese patron in a restaurant 75% full on a Sunday night.  That's always a good sign!  

Shocking me right off the bat was being served cold edamame.  Although typical in other places (like umm..Japan?), I've actually met people who grew up in Vegas thinking edamame was always served hot.  Even I expect it to be hot everytime in LV now for chrissakes.  I could tell this place gave a damn about "keeping it real" just from these itty bitty green things.

My wife was ready to order "bakudan" as soon as we sat down.  She thinks natto (fermented soybeans that smell like the foot of a corpse and taste even worse) is the single greatest culinary contribution from Japan to the world.  Cocokala's version included said item, tuna, okra, yamaimo (mountain potato) and spicy mustard.  Mix everything up and go to town because you're a braver person than I.  She thought this was awesome.  

I didn't expect the grilled saba (mackerel) to be my favorite dish but it totally was.  Nice portioned filet with a terrific char, tender meat and the oil from the fish had me considering another order as soon as I finished.  This went very well with their samurai barley beer which was their strongest brew at 10% alcohol.  

I also had a bottle of their stout brewed with oysters which tasted like you'd expect.....super funky Guinness.  My wife loved their Echigo red ale.  All the premium brews are $9-$10 for a 12 oz bottle.  They also have a nice selection of sake and shochu.      

Their chawanmushi (egg custard) was chockful of seafood deliciousness that rivaled Kyara's version.  I also thought highly of their take on black cod miso.  It's everything you'd expect at a very reasonable price.  

Chicken cartilage skewers were something I missed dearly from my days in Japan.  Usually the cartilage is stripped naked of any meat before it's grilled but I kind of liked it better their way with chicken meat still on it.  Cocokala would become my new best friend if they started serving fried chicken cartilage :)

Some stuff didn't make this visit five stars but they're all things that are correctable and are probably due to being so new.  I thought the white meat yakitori were very dry.  The ume jiso (sour plum sauce) kind of masked the dryness a little but the wasabi yakitori wasn't good.  They mistakenly added a grilled hamachi to our receipt.  And instead of being offered a refill of water, the glasses were simply taken away.  

None of these are very big issues.  I am just happy there's another quality izakaya in town!!

This review is based on hotel service and MANAGEMENT only (Manager Roberto and Pool Manager Chris) 

My brother, fiance, a friend, and I decided to stay at PH because my brother had a few free comped nights. We were there for 5 days (wed-mon) and was charged roughly $650. Pretty good deal we thought.

The day that we checked out (Monday), the bill came to $1500. Um, what?

We knew we messed up by using the wifi (13.99 per DEVICE), but there was no way it was going to be an additional $700 for wifi. When we went through the bill, we saw that there was a "Pool Bar" charge. We had NO idea what that was or what that meant. We went back to the front desk where Cecile helped us out.

She said the charge was from getting drinks at their pool. UM, what x 2??
We asked her what day was this because we only went to their pool ONCE on Thursday for like 30 mins and we never EVER went to the bar, just went there to tan. My brother had to work on the weekdays so he never even been to the pool. He had to work from the room. She told us it was on Friday. UM WHAT x 3?!?!

Cecile then told us she was going to call the pool and will get back to us when she talks to them. We left to the Miracle mall and received a call from Cecile 30 mins later. Came back to the front desk and she tells us, "They said it was YOU, you were at the pool and they remember you." Excuse me? Who is THEY?? Then she goes and ask, well maybe it was one of your friends who went. WTF? Definitely frustrated, she told us to step to the side and that she will have the manager come talk to us.

20 minutes pass and ROBERTO comes out from the back. There was another upset guest in front of us so Roberto was "helping" him first. Observing from the side, it was obvious that Roberto was one of those type of managers that was not willing to help you or hear you out. He even called security on the other upset guest. Whatever.

When it came to our turn, we explained to him why we were there. He did not make eye contact, just kept looking around and just basically NOT listening to us. We told him that Friday, NONE of us ever stepped into the pool. My fiance, friend and I were at Drais from 11am-3pm (where my fiance actually got HURT and we had to go to the hospital for him to get stitches. So we have proof that we werent there). My brother who was working in the room, had problems with the wifi, so he called for guest services around 11:30am and tech support came to the room around 330. He then left to go gamble downstairs from 4-6pm. The "POOL BAR" bill said that my brother was drinking it up from 12:35pm-5:20pm. THERE was NO WAY we were there.

After pointing this out and asking them to check the security camera and ALSO my brothers player card (since he was gambling during the time), Roberto then says he will have to call the Pool Manager to come down to talk to us.

We stood at the front desk for literally 1 hour. Roberto would pop his head out from the back room from time to time and ask if the pool manager came yet. Uh, no. 

FINALLY, a guy wearing a blue polo shirt steps out. He looks at us and so we ask,  are YOU the pool manager? He says yes. So this is CHRIS, the "pool manager". Having to tell him AGAIN what our situation was, he seemed a little bit more sympathetic. He looks at the bill and tells us, "wow, the bill was $500 and there was already an automatic $80 gratuity, but then there was an addtional $120 tip, that does look very sketchy. It makes me question if my employees are checking ID." In our heads we're like THANK GOODNESS someone understands. 

COMPLETELY WRONG.

He then proceeds to say, "But these 2 servers are my best servers and they're good people so I can't see them doing that". WTF? He then tells us hold on and goes back to where Roberto is. We can see the back door from here and for some reason they decided to close it.

5 minutes later they both come out and tells us, "Sorry, there's nothing we can do about this now. You have to just dispute it with your credit card." My brother then asked if he can get a copy of the pool bar receipt to see who signed it and Chris said they can't do that. He then leaves and tells my fiance "hope you're doing better". WTF.

Roberto then tells us again, they can't do anything about this now and that we have to dispute the charges. He grabs our bill and then tells us, "oh but let me remove some of this wifi charges for you." Ok, thanks for removing the wifi charges, but you can't remove the POOL BAR charge?!? Complete BS.

I've never been so frustrated in my life. They have security cameras, they can call the players card to check the times my brother gambled, they can call guest service to verify my brother called for help with the wifi, etc, but NOPE. 

WORST service ever and we will NEVER EVER stay here again.

After an evening of nonstop Vegas-style partying, the only words I managed to utter from my dry raspy voice the following morning was...water please!!!

In addition to replenishing my body with much needed liquids, I was feeling mighty peckish, as well!  After much deliberation, our group decided on a calm & relaxing sit down Saturday brunch at Thomas Keller's Bouchon. 

Located on the 10th floor inside the Venetian, the restaurant embodied what I've come to expect from a fine French bistro. The vibe was chic & refined yet relaxed and unfussy.  There were comfortable banquettes throughout the main dining area as well as outdoor seating in the patio area. We were subsequently seated inside. At 12:00pm, the sun was beaming from the patio, so our location filtered the intense light perfectly, which suited me and my solar sensitive eyes just fine. 

Complimentary house made jam was magnificent! The jam is freshly prepared each day and depending on the chef's mood, a different flavor variety is served. Today, he was feeling strawberry, which is my personal favorite! They served us an Epi baguette to share and it was fantastic, as well. Warm, buttery crust with perfectly chewy texture. Coupled with the soft butter and sweet pucker inducing jam, it was a match made in the stars.

The entrees were orchestrated perfectly as we didn't have to wait long at all.

Chicken n waffles - The waffles were made with bacon n chives and sourdough batter. It was airy and crisp with a lightly sweet flavor and a savory finish. It was so good i almost forgot to use the syrup!
The chicken was roasted perfectly and it was insanely moist & tender! The chasseur wine sauce was rich and flavorful with an alluring aroma. Some of my guests enjoyed the savory flavor so much they poured the irresistible sauce over their waffles, too!

Pork belly was fatty and incredibly flavorful and juicy.  Accompanied by the creamy hollandaise sauce, it was absolutely delicious!

Corned beef hash was phenomenal! Well seasoned pieces of corned beef mixed with all the traditional fixins that will impress any die hard corned beef hash purist!  Trust, this was far from canned! 

Short rib was tender, the fontina cheese was fragrant and the whimsically tiny jingle bell peppers added a pleasant little kick to this fantastic dish!

Beignets were served fresh out of the oven but they were quite dense and tasted more like doughnuts IMO Overall, they were very moist and with the added raspberry preserve filling, they added a sweet finish to our savory entrees.

Our service throughout the meal was very consistent with coffees, water, and juices always filled to the brim.

By the end of the meal we were absolutely stuffed!  But I didn't mind at all :D

My friends and I had a wonderful time and it was great feeling totally replenished and revived with good quality food that was masterfully prepared with fantastic service to boot. The strong coffee didn't hurt either!  I'm not quite sure if this particular location was ever awarded a Michelin star but IMO Thomas Keller deserves praise for a dining experience that was unpretentious, comforting and very enjoyable!

When we all left, I was sated, 100% refreshed and ready to take on the world, well at least another round of partying :) 

Hey, it's Vegas for crying out loud.

Happy Eats!

My second favorite buffet is vegas!!! (#1 is Studio B)

I took Kimberly K's awesome advice to take advantage of lunch prices for dinner.  So basically this was my first stop driving into vegas on a Tuesday and we arrived about 30 minutes before lunch was about to end.
Got in for lunch price at $20 and got to eat dinner as well, which is normally $30.  Paying for 5 people, it was a $50 savings!

PRICES: as of 9/6/11  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw?select=O5p34DZJZrd9YRIoHpREMQ

Breakfast : M-F 6am to 11am = $16
Lunch: M-F  11am-4pm = $20
Dinner Sun-Th  4pm-10pm = $30
Gourmet Dinner Fri/Sat  4pm-10pm $37
Weekend Brunch 7am-4pm  $25    (with champagne = $30)

The most important part for me is that they have a pretty good dessert selection : These were my pickings :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw?select=aBragtXmC5EWj12o632S-A

They had: CREME BRULEE, soft serve, banana foster, bread pudding, cute little cone things, carrot cake, tiramisu, cheesecake, chocolate cake, tarts, flan. Ofcourse these were not superb desserts like u would find at jean philippes. But for buffet desserts, i think this is way better than most. Way better than Wynn buffet, which i thought was bad overall. Didn't see any chocolate covered strawberries tho. :( 

Meats and Seafood:
Kobe Top Round, Prime Rib, Ham, Roast Chicken, Turkey. 
(my fave was the top round)
Snow Crab Legs, King Crab Legs, Shrimp Cocktail. 
*crab was a bit salty and not super fresh. but it really didnt' stop anyone for getting heaping piles of it. 

Other stuff they had was Salmon Teriyaki, Miso Chilean Seabass, 3 kinds of mashpotatoes including sweet potato- my fave was the pesto mash potatoes. A few different salads, which werent' that great. pasta salads, soups, chashu bao, salmon and tuna sushi and poke, CA rolls, sliders (meh), pizza, mac and cheese, sausage

I've been to this buffet probably about 5 times over the years, and it's been pretty consistently good IMO. Unfortunately prices keep going up and lines can get ridiculously long. If it were the weekend, i would prefer going to SB, but if i'm here during the weekday, i would definitely recommend coming here for a late lunch/early dinner!!!

Step 2... Choose one:

Grilled Fish $7.50
Grilled Veggie $6.25

Step 3... Choose one or all:
Seaweed Rice
Black  Beans

Tomato W/Grilled Maui Onion (spicy)

Step 5... Choose one or all:
Sour Cream
Cheese
Lettuce
Jalapenos
Cabbage
Lime
Cilantro
Guacamole W/Hawaiian Pink Salt ($1.35 extra)

I purchased a $10 for $20 groupon so we could try this place out for dinner. Upon walking in we were greeted and right away offered a sample of their Huli Huli Chicken and Kalua Pig. Both of these were equally good, but I really loved the Huli Huli Chicken. After reading the menu board I decided to go with the "3 Tacos" with 2 on flour tortillas and 1 on crispy corn. I was torn on which meat to choose for my tacos, so the man behind the counter said I could mix and match them. Cool! I ended up going with chicken, pig and steak tacos and paying the extra $1.35 for guac on them. A lot of places would charge for the guacamole per taco, but I was just charged the 1 price and got a generous portion on all 3 tacos. The tacos were delicious! The charred pineapple verde adds a nice flavor addition, the meat is tender and has great flavor, the tortilla was soft and good and the price was right for what I got. The guacamole is worth buying just as a side to have with chips, but I have to admit that if there was some sort of Hawaiian pink salt in it, I didn't see it or taste anything except for fresh yummy guac. Hubby had a "Pulehu Steak Burrito" and loved it, but found the size to be too small for his hungry appetite. I still had half of a taco left so I was very fulfilled! So full that I didn't even taste a bite of the "Cheese Quesadilla" priced at $2.50 (meat extra) that we also ordered. 

I also had to make room for dessert later because I got a bag of "Coconut Bark" priced at $3.50 to try. Whoa!! This stuff is addicting! I have never had anything like it before and honestly don't even know for sure what all was in it. It seems like a saltine cracker with a layer of brown sugar or caramel and then a layer of chocolate and coconut. Whatever it is, I want more! 

You can eat inside, outside or even grab some grub from their drive-thru.

1900 Asian Cuisine is the newest Chinese restaurant to open up at the former Kung Fu Chef site, offering traditional Chinese breakfast, "dim sum" and Szechuan, Shanghainese, and Taiwanese cuisine.  It is in the same plaza as Bazic, Old SF Market, and Shuseki.  They have only been opened since Tuesday (June 4, 2013), so spanking new they still don't have traditional menus printed up yet (currently utilizing single sided print outs stapled together).  But the staff all sport matching black or white shirts with the restaurant name printed on it.

At the time I dropped by at around 8:30pm on a Sunday, the restaurant was still not too busy.  After reviewing the menu, asked for recommendations and finally decided on Cumin Lamb, I kept myself busy with a game on my phone, while doing some eavesdropping.  Plus the insightful observation (duplicate check printout) that I made and verbal confirmation from the waitress, I learned that this new business is actually another restaurant venture by the owner of Three Village Restaurant, which has their original location just one floor up.  They also hired a chef direct from China, so they could offer up quality authentic Chinese food.

The food came out fairly quickly and it looked good.  Tasted great too. The only less than position impression was the haphazard way the steamed rice was served in a small bowl with rice all over the upper edges of the small bowl (they charge $0.50 for each bowl of rice).  I guess they just don't want to potentially waste rice on someone that only ordered one entree.

Of course one entree was not enough, and I ended up getting their Walnut Shrimp.  The portions is good, the shrimp was deep fried in a not too thick batter, just long enough that it was cooked without turning the crustacean into a rubbery exercise equipment for your jaw.

Overall the dinner menu is decent, but compared to what they offered during lunch (up to 5pm) it looks plain.  The patrons at nearby tables that arrived after me all asked about dim sum items, but all were told it was not available during dinner.  That's too bad, I would have ordered way more items if the kitchen could accommodate such request.  I hope they will take a cue from customers and at least offer some of dim sum items during dinner.

For breakfast (7-11am) they offer a small selection of traditional Chinese breakfast items (porridge, soy milk, etc.).  If I stay out really late or feeling extra motivated in the morning, I might check that out.

During their grand opening phase, they offer 15% discount to customers with local ID (or if you just look loco).  So if you are unsure, check them out with this little monetary carrot stick.

If you are not sure of what to get, then order their Cumin Lamb!

Taste:  3.5/5  Only tried a few dinner items thus far, some are really good some just OK.  I think the gems will be from the lunch menu.

Price/Value: 3.5/5  Not going to find cheap food at low low prices here. You pay for quality here.

Service:  3.5/5  Needs improvement in some areas, but they were nice and professional.

They are open late!!!  Mon-Thurs 2:30am  and Fri-Sat 3:30am 

3.5 stars

* Men's room could be cleaned up better, the trash was on the floor.

** This will be a good site for UYEs, so we can have a larger group to try out more of their menu in one go.

*** Does not accept American Express, Iraqi Dinars, but may consider renminbi (RMB).

This is my favorite place to stay in Vegas, apart from the lake front "1500" suite at The Bellagio or Villa #1 at The Mirage.  I have stayed at least 5 times at this point.  The service is impeccable, the styling by Tony Chi will inspire you, and the rooms are flat out amazing!  The good news is that the price isn't that outrageous for Las Vegas.  You could certainly spend a lot more for less at other properties.  I know I have.

To start, the hotel will pick you up and drop you off at the airport as a complimentary service.  They use a fleet of Maybachs, so if you have never been in one, here is your chance.  It is very luxurious, but the ride will be short since the Skylofts are on the top floor of the MGM Grand, which is right next door to the airport.  If a Maybach isn't available, they send a limo, but I have never had that happen.

Once you arrive at the hotel, an agent will meet you at the car to escort you directly to your room for check-in.  This is a nice touch as I loathe waiting in a hotel lobby for check-in with a ton of people.  They walk you through the MGM Grand lobby into the VIP, where there is a private hidden bank of elevators that go directly to the top floor of the hotel without stopping.  This is nice because the MGM Grand elevators (there are 6 in each bank) are always FILLED with people and stop at nearly every floor.  When you need the elevator, you just walk past the crowds, through a set of double doors, and into a private elevator to the top.  Stay at the MGM Grand one time and you will understand why this is so valuable for a pleasant overall experience.

When you get the the Skyloft lobby on the top floor, the design will immediately embrace you.  This hotel looks NOTHING like the MGM Grand below.  It is an entirely different property, and it shows.  There isn't a theme so much as a lot of natural elements like earth, fire, water, etc.  You feel different once you enter, and it holds throughout the entire experience.  The designer created everything down to the uniforms worn by the staff.  As you walk by staff members, they stop what they are doing, stand up, and greet you.

When you get to your room, a butler is waiting, complete with white gloves, a tray, and a complimentary cocktail or freshly squeezed glass of juice.  The check-in is quick and requires a few signatures.  Then, the butler will show you around your apt. and the amenities (if you are there for the first time).  It takes a minute to figure everything out because there is a lot of stuff.  I have always stayed in a 2-bedroom unit, but they also have 3-bedroom and 1-bedroom spaces.  The butler will offer to press your clothes or provide any other services you may need.

The 2-bedroom is approximately 3,000 sqare feet on two levels.  Downstairs, you have a dining area for 8, a living room next to the dining room, a pool table room (sometimes a foos ball table), a movie theater with surround sound and a powder bath, a second living room, a breakfast nook with coffee machine (the kind that makes an assortment of drinks using packets) and a sexy entry foyer with a stairway to the upstairs.  The entire place is luxury and you will feel special just being there.

The upstairs has large art installation common space between the two bedrooms.  One room has two queen beds and a huge, spa-style bathroom, and the master has one king bed with the even better spa-style bathroom.

The entire place is completely teched out.  There are Lutron lighting controlers with buttons in the entry that say "day, night, mood, etc".  One click and the entire apartment is set.  There are also Crestron controllers in every room and Bang and Olufsen butterfly stereos in the bedrooms and movie theater.  There are iPod docks in nearly every room as well, and the shades are motorized.  The list goes on and on...

The master bathroom has a huge steam shower with about 9 heads including a rain shower head, a negative-edge soaking tub with led lights and jacuzzi jets, a powder room with bidet, televisions inside of the bathroom mirrors, a dressing area with full length mirrors and lovely storage cabinetry, a scale, a separate bathroom music controller, a large flat screen over the tub, and fantastic robes, towels, and spa products.  The guest bathroom has everything I just listed minus the steam shower feature.  It also has a table with 4 chairs in the dressing area.

The entire place is setup to party.  The best part, you can go crazy in here with the music on full blast and nobody can hear you.  Likewise, you can't hear anybody else.  It is like a Vegas dream come true if you hate hearing the doors of your neighbors open and close during your entire stay.

I am running out of space, but there is a lot more to share.  There is a service entrance to the apt. where the staff can enter your unit and deliver things like the best room service EVER without bothering you.  I could write for an hour about the food options.  5 stars!!!!!

Third times a charm? This makes three times I have seen a pizza spot in this location. I stopped in and ordered a "Monday's Special" which is a large cheese pizza for $9.99 and additional toppings are extra. Inside was very busy so I guess others are wanting to this place out too. While I was waiting for my pizza, I noticed they have pizza by the slice for sale. I asked if they could add a slice of Sicilian (cheese) to my order priced at $3.25 and make it to-go. My husband isn't a fan of a lot of sauce on a pizza, but I'm the opposite. I asked for a side of sauce (cost .85 cents) to go along with my pizza for dipping and it and I ended up really liking the flavor. The pizza had a thin crust and the right amount of cheese for it. The pizza wasn't very greasy at all and hubby and I both enjoyed it. The Sicilian slice tasted great and had the crisp crust it should, but I was a but disappointed when I got home and opened the paper bag it was in and it was just on a paper plate inside the bag. They did just open, so it's possible they ran out of to-go boxes, but I hope it's not this way all the time. The Sicilian slice was actually my favorite part. The employees were nice and with the different specials they have going on and the food being decent, I can see coming back.

Most pizza joints have a "slice special" and it has a certain time it runs and sometimes only on certain days. Well, here you can get 2 slices and a drink for $5.50 7 days a week anytime. I thought it was a plus that I could get a slice special for dinner instead of just a restricted lunch time special. Aside from pizza they also have wings, fingers, salads, strombolis, pasta, sandwiches and desserts. They also cater.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 39/100

My boyfriend and I were on a mission to try all of the Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas this weekend! BurGR was our second stop of the trip!

BurGR is located literally right inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel. SUPER easy to get to from the lobby! They have this AWESOME glass window display with a metal structure emitting a bunch of flames all over it. It's really interesting and a great storefront display! They also have a bunch of Gordon Ramsay merchandise at the front such as t-shirts, cookbooks, glasses, etc.

We were able to walk right in and get seated immediately. However, a few minutes after we had been sitting at our table, I looked over to the front of the restaurant and there was a HUGE line! We got super lucky that there was nobody there when we entered at around 11:15am.

The decor of this place is super trendy, modern, and basically a sports bar with all of the large screen TVs on all of the walls displaying football and other popular sports. There are also lots of flames everywhere (I'm assuming are related to Hell's Kitchen) and a photo of Gordon Ramsay.

Waiter service was great, as usual. Our waiter immediately came to us and asked if we wanted to take a look at the drink menu, which is an iPad 2 that they give you to look at. It is an interactive menu that has all of the drinks sorted by category (beers, cocktails, red/white wine, etc.), descriptions of each drink, and even photographs. There's also a tab with Gordon Ramsay's biography and photograph, which I thought was pretty cool.

We ordered two waters, a cup of coffee, and then took a look at the menus. The menus were pretty amusing because they, too, had a giant photo of Gordon Ramsay that surprises you when you first order them :P

My bf and I ended up sharing the Shake #4 - creme brulee pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie. THIS WAS AMAZING! I had seen photos of the shakes on Yelp and was curious to try them because I've never had a shake infused with pudding before. Thanks to this shake, I am a HUGE fan of the pudding + shake combination from now on :) So yummy! The two flavors look separated (with creme brulee on top and oreo on the bottom), but surprisingly when you sipped on it, the flavors were combined and complimented each other very well. I would love to come back to try the other 4 combinations!

As for burgers, I ordered the Uber Cheese Burger (fontina cheese + raclette cheese + goat cheese), and my boyfriend got the American burger (american cheese + butter lettuce + tomato + pickle + onion). As a HUGE cheese lover, my burger was absolutely PERFECT for me! It was literally just the patty + 3 types of cheese, which was exactly what I wanted. My bf nearly inhaled his American burger and said it was super good. We unfortunately decided to skip out on getting fries because we didn't have the appetite to eat that much food! I would definitely like to come back to try the truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries.

When we received our bill, we were given an iPod that had a little survey/questionnaire for us to answer based on our dining experience at BurGR. The Yelp Elite in me naturally reached for this and began answering the questions like crazy :P I thought it was pretty cool how much they integrated the use of iPads and iPods at their restaurant!

Overall, 5 stars for a really trendy, hip atmosphere, great service, and delicious food! I would love to come back during my next visit to Vegas! :)

Make sure you come prepared to stand in line here at the Bachannal Buffet. Being one of the more popular buffet's on The Strip, this line can get outright outrageous I heard.  We were lucky this time,  waiting less than 45 minutes, after hearing stories of people waiting 1-2 hours. BTW, you can opt to pay an extra fifteen bucks to enter via the "Preferred" line. Nope, I'll wait. After paying for two, which by-the-way set me back a cool $102 bucks, we were escorted to our seats and invited to start anytime we wished. Ah, my dining companion and I decided we would make a "dry run" through the entire buffet to prepare ourselves for the journey ahead of us. After familiarizing ourselves with the setup, we proceeded to get our food. For me, the first stop was the Asian section. Being savvy enough to discipline oneself to realize that there is one big huge buffet ahead and not to fill up on starch here can be difficult here.  There was a nice layout of sushi and other Oriental delicacies. As I made my way around the buffet, I couldn't help but notice the standard items found in most buffets. People were piling their plates with crab legs, which btw were probably snow crab, really skinny. I think I took maybe two small legs. I made my way to the prime rib, which is kinda how I judge a good buffet. I asked for a medium rare piece, but was a little disappointed in it's being dry. There were other meats, but they looked equally dry also. The oysters are good, though, very fresh. They have a nice display of fish in the display case which made for a great photo op!  The Mexican section was pretty good, but I think the star of this buffet had to be the dessert section. Macarons, cakes, pies, cake pops, even mochi ice cream! A dessert lover's paradise! All in all, I have to give this buffet a three star rating because I felt it was a bit overrated and because the meat section wasn't what I expected. The service was fair, although I noticed towards the end of our meal it got slow and our drinks went un-refilled... Would I go back? Probably not, I did want to try the brunch one day though. I think for the money, there are other better choices in Vegas.

An award winning dining experience that will leave you sated and infinitely satisfied!

As soon as we stepped inside the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the restaurant manager who proceeded to lead us to our seats by the window. 
Located inside the newly erected Augustus tower of Caesar's Palace, the restaurant embraced a contemporary elegance that was refined yet simple and unfussy.  With warm tones from the rich wood panels, ceilings that soared high up, and large glass paneled windows with a peek a boo view of the Bellagio fountains, the ambiance was nothing less than magnificent!
  
The sommelier was helpful and knowledgeable as he started us with some bubbly and as soon as I saw a bottle of vintage Krug, I knew I was in for a treat!

The server was equally friendly and suggested The Chef's Signature Tasting Menu, which showcased the restaurant's acclaimed dishes.  Frankly, It goes without saying I went with the chef's signature tasting menu.  When in Rome, right folks?

Amuse Bouches

Foie gras with black truffle
Crisp toastettes pierced together with creamy smooth foie gras and irresistible black truffle was a decadent play of flavors and textures in the mouth. 

Parmesan waffle
Light fragrant and perfectly crisp and a delightful start to a sumptuous meal.

Cold zuchini soup with diced Radish & celery seed powder - very refreshing with a pleasant bite from the diced radishes

Fingerling potatoes with cream cheese and ham and topped with watercress. A charming little surprise that came with the cold zucchini soup.  This accompaniment rounded out our amuse plates wonderfully but something was telling me it probably wasn't the last surprise of the evening!

First Course

Heirloom tomatoes wedges with watermelon and tomato gelee - refreshing and vibrant! the addition of the frozen tomato added just enough saltiness to the sweet heirloom tomatoes and the addition of the crisp basil was surprisingly delightful!

Surprise #2 A tomato tartar topped with a pomegranate gelee and  basil drops was lightly flavorful and beautifully plated.

2nd dish

Colors of caviar - elegant and perfectly composed with layers of complex flavors and rich textures that paired beautifully with the champagne and meant to be savored slowly

3rd dish

Fish with ratatouille - Perfectly cooked, and the fish was imported from the southeast of France...Si Bon! Presented with its natural jus foam, the flesh was supple and soft to the touch with my fork. The ratatouille added the perfect amount of rustic flavor to this light yet incredibly flavorful fish

4th dish
Foie Gras - Considering its recent ban in California, I have found my new mecca for foie gras...Vegas baby! Served with a side of duck jus in a shot glass steeped in chopped fresh beets, green tea with crispy rice, the foie gras was absolute perfection. It was decadently rich and the orange zest cleansed the palate perfectly! Without a doubt, one of my favorite dishes of the evening!

5th
Black Truffle Soup - served with a warm buttery brioche that tasted like a flaky pastry. We were encouraged to dip the brioche into the velvety smooth soup. Infused with an incredibly rich depth of flavor imparted from the black truffle shavings and Parmesan flakes, this well composed soup was absolutely sublime and left my taste buds dancing long after i finished it!

6th dish
Filet mignon tenderloin with bone marrow was simply exquisite. The filet was insanely tender and very flavorful. The bone marrow that topped the filet was buttery soft and paired nicely with the filet. The shoulder cut of beef wrapped in delicate ribbons of carrot exhibited a briny flavor that added an earthy element to the dish, as well.

Desserts

Dessert Amuse Bouche - Apricot sorbet and with diced apricot. Tart, refreshing, and an excellent palate cleanser

Coconut 6 ways - An splendid little dessert with an interesting mix of textures that made it a sheer joy to eat!

Chocolate ganache with praline cream. Divine & a chocolate lover's dream come true!

Everything ended with a citrusy sorbet with creme fraiche as a final palate cleanser...

But our sweet journey didn't end there!  A large dessert cart was then rolled out for us to choose to our heart's content. We went with a variety of the server's tempting suggestions and then came the cheese cart! Seriously, the dinner lasted over 3 hours, but i hardly felt the time pass because i was enjoying myself so much!

At the end of the meal, we were greeted by the chef and left with complementary muffins to enjoy the following morning.

In short, the wait staff was kind courteous and very informative. Food was brought out at a very good pace and we never felt rushed or felt like we waited forever between dishes.

I would highly recommend Guy Savoy for any special occasion. It will leave you with an unforgettable experience that you will cherish for years to come.

Happy Eats!

We were fortunate enough to have lunch here today - on their soft opening day.

This is a rare opportunity in Vegas to enjoy plates prepared by a Michelin starred chef himself, not just by a name on its signage.

Eventually this place will be a kaiseki restaurant - a traditional multi-course Japanese dinner - of only 12 seats, but due to limitated availability of uncommon ingredients required for kaiseki, liquor license, etc. they will only offer Japanese comfort food lunch in the coming months.

It was a three-course lunch for $20:

- First course: Triple layered vegetable soup served chilled - Seven vegetables in the first layer, soy sauce based brown gele in the second layer, avocado and egg white with Japanese sake in the third layer
- Second course: Petite Assorted Appetizer - Flavored edamame, marinated cucumber with sweetened miso, yuzu flavored shrimp, soy flavored Japanese taro potato, deep fried lotus roots
- Main course (choose one from three): a) Chicken Rice Omelette - egg omelette over white steamed rice sauted with ketchup, onion, green peppers, chicken, bacon and mushroom. b) Tonkotsu Ramen Noodle Soup Wok Charred - pork based ramen. c) Black Curry over Steamed Rice - traditional Japanese style curry over white steamed rice.

The first cource - the three layered soup was amazing. Very complex tastes mingled on my tongue, the potato-ish veggie flavor on the top followed by the sweet gele, deepened with the avocado. All completely grated, but I was still able to tell the texture, scoop and taste individually or all at once.

There came the second, more traditional kaiseki-like appetizer. This time, we could see the basic attributes of natural ingredients were preserved, yet amusing presentation of craftsmanship was well displayed. The finish of shrimp was like what we eat for Osechi that would bring back old timey memories. Satoimo (Japanese taro) came with tangy rock salt. Cucumber came hocho-crafted with mildly sweet moromi-miso. Deep fried lotus roots had perfect crunchiness that played nice in the mix. However, the edamame was lacking the finishing touch. Not only that the flavor was nothing special, it felt awkward to pull out beans from the pod by hand.

We chose Omurice (Rice Omelette) and Tonkotsu Ramen for the main.

As much as I would like to say the Omurice was perfect, it was also pretty basic to be honest. Considering that Omurice has been less accepted in the US market, I can understand that the straightforward path is a safe bet, but for matured taste buds like ours, some you-cannot-do-it-at-home factors seemed to be missing. My personal preference is rice less steamed and eggs more runny. Also I personally like demi-glace sauce better, or at least the ketchup could use some twist.

Now the best part- the tonkotsu ramen! I was blown away. I know it's like cheating to compare ramen elaborated by a kaiseki chef with shops serving bowls in every 60 seconds, it was the best ramen I've had in this competitive Las Vegas market. The broth had very intricate flavors, but was not too greasy or heavy. Quite contrary, the aftertaste was pleasantly light. Chashu was a little sweetened, which added a unique perspective. Typically noodles are straight and thin for tonkotsu, but wavy noodles used by Omae worked to fully enjoy this rich-yet-not-too-rich broth.

In the end, all those three (plus drink) for $20 was a well considered price point. It's on a high-end for lunch, particularly for local clientele, but is a steal for the quality of food and service.

Some obvious opening day flaws aside, this place is very promising. I spotted some misses in the food as described above, but I will hold off my full review until they start offering kaiseki, a big missing piece in the Las Vegas culinary scene.

4 stars + 1 for a forward looking factor.

We have dined here many times and brought a guest this time. The atmosphere in the main dining room is very nice as in a warm gentleman's clubby room kind of way. There are great paintings on all the walls including a great one of Mr. Rogers and there are several mounted animal heads high-up on some walls.
  
Their bread and the selection is very good including the pumpernickel and lavash. They serve butter that is some the best you can get. "European-style" Cultured Butter I would say.

From the Bar we ordered a Grey Goose martini with blue cheese stuffed olives perfectly made and the olives were some of the best I have had. The apple martini was weak for some reason but had good taste. With dinner a bottle of Concha y Toro, Marques Casa de Concha 2010 Carmenere went so well with our steaks.

To start I had the Wedge salad that was pretty good for sure right up there with some of the best. The lettuce was appropriately extremely cold and crisp. While the blue cheese dressing was good indeed, it could have been a little stronger of the blue for my own taste, but the tomato wedges and the bacon were outstanding. The Onion soup was tasty with a great topping of oozy melted crusty cheese.  We also had Wagyu Beef Carpaccio that I would grade outstanding.

Specials of the night are always worth a review and discussion with your server. Tonight, one that sounded great was a preparation of wild pacific salmon, but we were here for the steaks tonight.

My dry age strip steak was a very flavorful piece of meat and the tenderloin with porcini sauce and the poached lobster was a super combination, tender and flavorful, decadent perhaps; just great . The filet that we asked to be treated with the Kona was very good. Also at our table we had he porterhouse which was a good size, nicely done and very tasty. To reiterate a bit, we enjoyed good flavor with all the steaks and all were prepared as ordered.

Service, first and last was outstanding. Our server's knowledge was just short of encyclopedic. Everything about everything on their menu and anything about all the food and perpetrations she was able to recite.  She was very professional, fast and prompt in an apparent effortless and smooth manner. Wine she knew all about, yes she did. "Oh I think you would want that wine filtered", so she decanted our wine as her own recommendation for what we had. "Not going to finish the wine; want it back in the bottle", not a problem and immediately it was done. 
They are very busy on the weekends and when we arrived for our 8PM reservation the dining rooms were at 95 percent full. If you arrive without a reservation you might have a chance to eat in the lounge area high tops, bar, or the few tables in the area. 

If you like great dining and great steak and can afford an upscale price; Capital Grill is worth the occasional experience.

As they say, "time marches on".

The original POMO was a very special pizzeria, that transported it's diners back to Italy. It was located further south along Scottsdale Road in the Borgata Shopping Center, next to Blanco's. Though small, it had an intimate feel where you could have an easy conversation with you server. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz/pomo-pizzeria-napoletana-scottsdale-2#hrid:DP4ygw0P_5831sjXGX5ecA

The "new" Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria feels like a concept restaurant, sort of like Fox's Olive & Ivy or North, which is not a bad thing. But gone is that old world Italian Grotto elegance and feel. I guess it's only fitting that it's in the former Blooms space. 

Also gone is any mention of POMO's being a certified Napoletana pizzeria, from either APN (Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani) or VPN (Verace Pizza Napoletana). But in truth, the pizzas are still very good and they now have a new, much larger wood fired brick oven. 

The square footage feels three times larger. At times it seems like a dozen or so wait staff are rushing around, delivering pizzas to almost forty tables and that is just inside the restaurant. The outside space is equally large, with a heavy duty tarp covering the diners. I eyed at least two Culinary Managers on the floor keeping track of the staff and food. Nice!
 
The three of us arrived around two o'clock on Black Friday. We were seated pretty quickly, with a good view of the pizza oven. I would highly recommend the location and view. The menu has been updated. And yes it may seem more expensive, given the pricier location near Gainey Ranch and the Hyatt Regency, but it's not. 
http://www.pomopizzeria.com/pomo-scottsdale-menu.pdf. 

I started out by ordering a Cappuccino ($4.00) which was as good as anything I've had at the green mermaid. It had a nice taste but lacked foam. My friends ordered a diet soft drink and a black ice tea, both $2.50. 

Since we remembered how tasty the bruschetta was at the old POMO's we decided to start there. We had the Sorrentina for $7.95 (see photo), which was very good with a hint of garlic. 

Next we decided to share two pizzas. One was their famous Regina Margherita.  It was as tasty and good (though somewhat smaller) as it's predecessor.  I've posted two pictures, a before and after if you will. It was priced at $12.95, same as before.  

The other pizza was their Amatriciana, which comes with saut onions and tiny amount of diced panchetta. It too was very good and priced at $14.95. I believe the key to their delicious tasting pizzas, is the constant and watchful eye as they cook in an over 850 F oven. 

A new addition not found in the old Restaurante, is a grab and go sandwich annex, called "Forno Fabbri, an Italian Market & Mozzarella Bar".  It's to the left as you come into Pomo Cucina and very similar in size and setup to the ones found in Olive and Ivy or the Herb Box. It's a major plus for a quick weekday lunch, one which I will try in the near future. 

Our total for three came to $48.42, including taxes but before gratuities. It seemed fair and the food as I've mention is very good. So Four Stars and yes, we are a Fan of the new Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria. 

Enjoy!

Dating Guide for Dummies, Vol. 4: How to properly club & hit on a group of bodacious bimbos at an A-list Vegas night club.

In this edition of DG for D's, I'm going to cover a premiere Vegas night club and extract it's venue perks towards your benefit.  This is also one of the few clubs where every girl will still look amazing after the lights turn on, so there's no need to rush out.

When you go to a night club, you need to be fresh, look fresh, and feel fresh.  The girls don't get Barbie'd up for nothing in this town so you need to do your part too, but do it with a cool sense of casual-class and finesse.  Down-dress with a nice untucked dress shirt with your sleeves rolled, slim designer jeans, dress shoes other than black, and a loose, solid tie (optional, but highly recommended). 

Now on to the venue, XS is a club where the guys "can" get some loving, but how, you ask?  I feel your pain brother, that's why I wrote this installment.  Main rule of thumb, don't wait in the 2 hour line and don't go in broke.  Even if you manage to walk in with a group of lovely girls, you will need to order drinks.  Your best bet is to cut the line by booking a VIP table and/or cabana with your boys and splitting the costs.  Girls love VIP and they love free bottle service so you're sure to attract a herd of them.  With that said, if you're not hitting it off, limit those skanks to 1 drink or risk getting played.

Did I mention the girls are easy?  For the most part they are.  Trust me, 85% are there to get some sort of action: simple flirting, subtle make out sessions, someone to dance with, or straight answer how they like their eggs in the morning question.  Over easy please.  Stay away from the other 15%, you'll immediately know who they are and don't question the validity of these statistics, it's certified as I've scientifically proven them during my last visit.

Make sure to stay away from any pair of girls since they usually want to dance with themselves, unless they approach you or emit an inviting aura a la cutesy wandering eyes.  Also, steer clear of groups larger than 4 unless you have backup.  There's too much criticism amongst these felines and you'll be heavily scrutinized.  Even if the entire group digs you, it takes one crazy bitch to say stop-no-and-don't to ruin your game.  3 is the magic number fellas, there are less girls to impress and you'll get a chance to charm them up on a more intimate level.  If you happen to cusp one away from her pack, the other two girls will still have each other so she's really not leaving her girls hanging.  Once you do, take her outside to cool off and dance at the shallow end of the pool.  Trust me and get your feet wet, this will show her your fun, adventurous side.

If you arrive a little late, well that's perfect!  The girls are already liquored up from the many guys offering them free drinks.  This is a good thing as these guys haven't read my guide so they're making our jobs easier and cheaper.  They don't call me Dr. Date, aka Mr. Steal-Your-Girl for nothing.  Have no shame, just roll on in and commit a robbery.  Also remember, these girls are already wet from how magnificent the venue is: the euro style dcor and endless stripper poles, flashing lights and fancy limelights, gorgeously-lit pool area and spacious outdoor dance floor, loungy plush-white day beds, and party-rocking-world-class dj's.  XS is really doing us a favor.  You paid for it so use it towards your advantage.

Now go, young padawan, for you have the tools necessary to roam the short skirts of XS.  May good luck and fortune bestow upon you.  And remember kids, what happens in Vegas, stays...except for herpes.  That shit will come home with you.

Five of us had dinner at The Carlton last night and it was a wonderful dining experience. 

For appetizers we had: 1 jumbo lump crab cake, 1 beet salad, 1 lobster and crab gnocchi, and 2 house salads. The Jumbo Lump Crab Cake which I ordered, was meaty with crab and was very rich sitting atop of Julianne vegetables. The Dijon Cream and fresh herb sauce it came with was just delicious. The gnocchi was tender and mild which allowed the lobster and crab to predominate the flavor profile. It was served in a Spinach, Caramelized Onions and Tomato-Ketel One Cream base. Very tasty indeed.
Salad eaters, house and beet, all said they were great as well. These were all very good size appetizers so you might save some for taking home if you plan on heavy entrees and tend to fill-up fast.

With the appetizers we also finished off two lemon cream martinis, one sour apple martini and one Grey Goose on the rocks with a twist, and one Arnold Palmer (AP refills aplenty). All drinks were made well. The had a nice martini list, a pretty good wine by the glass list and a full wine list which comes out on an iPad. Pretty cool approach. I am not counting but they say they have over 500 wines on the list. Enough to match any taste or meal. Later for dinner we wanted some rich, creamy full mouth Chardonnay so the proprietor suggested Sonoma-Cutrer for us. This was delicious and great match with our food.

Dinner entrees were hard to choose from the extensive menu which includes some great daily specials which they say usually change every day. Sticking with a theme, I went the seafood route all night and choose the Florida Grouper which was prepared oven roasted and was fresh Parmesan crusted and served with Lobster Pierogies, Spring Vegetables and Roast Garlic Butter. Oh my was this meal ever rich and tender. The Grouper was completely melt in your mouth fresh and tender, and I exaggerate not one bit. The Pierogies were moist, tender and full of lobster stuffing and it went so well with the Grouper. Boy this was a satisfying choice.
 
Three people, were enticed by the 14 oz. medium to medium rare Prime Rib. They all came out looking absolutely beautiful. Jody who is the real Prime Rib  connoisseur said that his ranked up with the best of them. Jody has traveled and lived or visited may cities for extended stays.  He has lived in Las Vegas so he had the opportunity to eat a Lawry's Prime Rib several times. To which I can say when I ate there with him a time or two, and I thought it was the best I ever had. So that puts The Carlton up with the best prime rib places in our judgment.
Linda went for the Ahi Tuna entre, which she said was extremely fresh and tender with the fabulous Tuna flavor one seeks in the best sushi. But it doesn't come naked. It's preparation is fresh Wasabi-Panko crusted with the Ahi Tuna seared rare and served with Curry-Coconut Orzo, Asian Greens, Hearts of Palm-Julienne Carrots and Yuzu Butter. This was a beautiful and tasteful preparation. Had enough to bring home and it served as a special breakfast this morning.

I have to say that everything was really outstanding at The Carlton. Topping it off with some personal service, Kevin Joyce, the owner stopped at our table to see if we were enjoying or meals.  Have to hand it to Kevin, his professional staff, and especially Executive Chef Mark Swomley who has been there for 16 years. The Carlton itself has been around for 27 years which I think is a real testament to its enduring quality and service. You can not go wrong here.

My first Arepas and is was Viva Las Vegas good!

I had to try this place after reading Craig R's review.  I've never had an Arepas before so I was looking forward to trying it.  This place is a stand alone shack on the corner at the end of the north side of the strip.  Seriously its a shack, you cant miss it cuz it sticks out!!!  They have some tables set outside so there are places to for you to eat there.  Saw a few that just swung by and got it to go.   

An Arepa is a flat, round and soft patty made out of cornmeal, which is grilled, making it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and then it can be stuffed with beef, chicken, ham, cheese, beans, shrimp, and many more. These delights are gluten-free, and wheat-free.  Aside from arepas (hot/cold) they also serve empanadas and hallacas which are like tamales.

SInce I was having a really late dinner I decided to try 2 and got a #5 and #7 with a mango drink to wash is down.  I sat down and waited about 10 min and the guy brought it out. 

#5 Roasted Pork Butt  (Pernil) which is Slow Cooked Marinated Pork, Fresh Tomato Slices and cheese.  Damn this was tasty good.  Great flavored pork, tender and juicy.  The cornmeal was grilled perfectly with a crisp!

#7 Reina Pepiada which is Shredded Chicken Breast, Avocado,  Mayonnaise, Cilantro, Green Peas.  Was like a chicken salad as this was a cold version.  They look small but they are actually pretty big and was only able to eat half of this one as I was totally full. 

The guy told me about the 2 homemade sauces they have on the table.  One is green and a milder version but with a really good flavor.  I would buy some of this good stuff.  The red was obviously spicy and so I didn't really use it but it was good.  

This place may look questionable but let me tell you this is a great hole in the wall place to hit up when your in LV.  It's way off the strip so you wont have to deal with lines and strip prices.  They have great tasty food 

Eyes ~ Ok its on the corner and the seats are pretty much on the sidewalk.
Nose ~ Not much to smell when your outside and the wind whipping!
Ear ~ Cars cars cars!
Mouth ~ Damn tasty arepas!
Tummy ~ Stop stuffing more food mouth, I'm freaking full yo!

I am still alive. I am still grateful. I still remember. 

This week, I celebrate the outcome of a lifesaving surgery. This time each year, I take a road trip to remember how lucky I am to be alive and the life lessons that I learned from almost dying. 

El Cortez. A great find. A bargain-priced well-run, cleaner-than-most hotel in old-school downtown dirty Vegas. This location is perfect for a variety of traveler's wants, especially mine.

Steps from the double-decker 'Deuce' bus which runs the strip 24 hours a day starting here. If you have no means of transportation or just love saving lives by letting sober hands take the wheel, having the Deuce, ($7 per 24 hours) steps away is critical.

I didn't love Vegas my first visit. I flew in from LA, stayed at Cesar's Palace, took taxis to and from exclusive nightclubs and fancy steak houses with my former-frat-boy ex. 

Since, I've stayed at a gamut of convenient-to-the-strip hotels, found a nonexclusive place to dance and liked it. But I didn't love Vegas until I found the old-timey Vegas that resides at the Fremont street experience, steps from El Cortez. 

Why I prefer 'downtown' to 'uptown' in general represents one of the reasons my nickname at Yelp is "grassroots girl". The other, is that this account, like all my social networking, began to respond with an authentic voice to corporate injustice. My commitment to the ideology behind both is also what I celebrate this week, why I came & why I loved it here.

I lost my memory once years ago. Can you imagine waking up ten years from now with no memory of the time passing within those ten years? That was me, years ago. 

I was a broke teenager with lavender hair who carried picket signs and fronted a rock band, 13. When I woke up, I was VERY different, twenty something. It wasn't just the blond hair or the fancy car in my driveway that was different, I didn't know my mail carrier's name nor did I care. *The good news about finding out the bad news about yourself, is that you can change.

I'll be prone to falling in love with "uptown" things forever. I will fall off the course once set for myself, ideals included. Ridiculous insecurities will drive my wants to "fit in" and "be accepted". I'll have the opportunity to be both ashamed or proud of where I came from.

With any luck, I'll hang on to 'grassroots' ideals. Won't be easy. Once a year, I will take a road trip to remember how I'd once forgotten everything I stood for on the path to acceptance from everybody but me.

If you want access to the most exclusive nightclubs, if you like the limelight, if you steer from classic towards the newest, coolest, chicest, you might not like it here. If you send your food back because it never meets your standards, if you only frequent the "in" spots only when the "in" crowd is there, this might not be for you. 

If you have not yet deleted all memory of the years spent turning your once-idealistic values to shit, you might choose to stay elsewhere. There was a time in my life when this place wasn't up to my standards.

 I was an asshole. A bitch. A stuck up jerk who only cared about the label beneath her lapel and the logo on her car keys. I'm not saying that I'm not all of the aforementioned still. (I am) It will be a lifetime uphill battle to avoid becoming that way again completely. Loving my stay here is proof that I have not fallen all the way off the tracks.

We had two double beds on the 5th floor. Room 5509 had a GREAT view from the window. We used the coffee maker to make hot water for tea. (the coffee is meh) We watched the big flat-screen TV for the weather report. Over 100 degrees!

A fridge was given to us on request, on the house. We filled it with fruit, drinks and milk for cereal which we purchased from the bodega spotted from our beautiful window view. 

We took advantage of the Shea butter lotions, soaps and high-end toiletries provided. We used the lush bath towels and called down for more. We took some extra towels to the dingy pool 2 blocks away, but we had the pool all to ourselves so had a great time swimming anyway.

I drank espresso every morning from the coolest cafe/record store/art gallery in the world located just steps away. We watched the 'Tribute To Queen' show at the Fremont experience where water was 2 for $1. deep fried Oreo cookies, 99 cents each & green cans of cream ale, 2 bucks. 

We shared steak dinners ($6.99) in the middle of the night when the "gambler's specials" roll out. We treated ourselves to a  $6.25 breakfast buffet (coffee & OJ included) from Vegas Club down the block. We waited behind the wise elderly locals outfitted with walkers and wheel chairs who smiled at us. We smiled back. 

We slept all day in the cool comfort of personalized AC without hearing neighbors or slot machines. We felt safe leaving the casino late-night. Highly recommended. Will return. Hopefully, grassroots forever.;-)

Wow!  Now that I've been to Rose.Rabbit.Lie, I understand how the whole thing fits together and works.  I had a free ticket for the show last night and I made a dinner reservation, too.  The website said they were fully booked, but when I called the Cosmopolitan, she made a reservation for me.

I got my ticket at the box office on the second floor and went to the Rose.Rabbit.Lie entrance at 6 PM for my reservation.  There was a couple in line ahead of me.  They weren't yet open.  There's a lot of security and ear pieces in this area across from the Wicked Spoon buffet.  When they opened, the woman asked me if I wanted a table or to sit at a bar.  Since I was alone, I told her the bar.  She asked which one I wanted to go to and I couldn't answer.  I let her choose and she took me to the Library Bar.

There are several rooms behind closed doors after you enter the main door.  On the left was the Library, a small room with about 8 tables and 8 or so seats at the bar.  I took the end seat and I was so glad this was where I was.  We could hear the music from next door--it turned out to be the Music Room--and the bartender who waited on me was Anthony!  He was perfect--knowledgable about the menu and he made some great recommendations to me.  

Most of the dishes are tapas style.  I ordered the Brussels sprouts with crispy chicken skin. Manchego cheese and Spanish paprika.  I also ordered Tte de Cochon--pig head with a slow cooked egg.  The pig head was cooked and the meat was seasoned and formed into a small rectangle.  It was lightly battered with panko breadcrumbs and lightly fried.  Served with a soft poached egg, it was delightful.  Breaking the egg and letting it run over the pork was so very good!  The Brussels sprouts were wonderful!  I could not have had two better recommendations!

I chose desert on my own.  I ordered the butterscotch pudding with a chocolate and hazelnut "stone".  The dessert was a perfect ending to the meal.  The butterscotch was salted and the "stone" was very tasty!

Service was excellent and sitting at the bar was a show in itself.  Anthony showed me and the gentleman seated next to me the 3 kinds of special ice cubes they make for Rose.Rabbit.Lie.  Quite interesting and creative.

From here, I was shown to the Music Room where I listened to a 5 piece combo play.  There was a singer who walked on the bar in the Music Room.  One of the entertainer/ushers--a friend of mine--came in to work.  I had no idea he had gotten a job here.  He told me that we'd be shown into the Ballroom (another place to eat and drink) and then we'd go to the showroom.  The combo and the singers went into the Ballroom and then the doors were opened to the Showroom.  

The show is called Vegas Nocturne and although the website lists it as 70 minutes, it's more like 95 minutes in length.  There are two types of chairs and I got seated in a row that had the hard folding chairs.

The show is a milder version of its cousin, Absinthe.  The acts are lower key in a way because of the low ceiling.  The acts are very good, the comedy is quite funny, and it was a perfect end for my evening.  Katy Perry was in the audience.

This was a wonderful evening and I'm so glad I went.  I'm not sure I'd pay the full price for the show.  It's a bit steep considering the other entertainment available on the Strip but as part of an entire evening at Rose.Rabbit.Lie, it was just perfect!

I stopped in here for dinner and wasn't disappointed. It's inside Doc Holliday's if you can really say that since it seems more of a next door neighbor to the bar. I figured I would be walking through the bar to get to Maribel's and you can, but the door I went into led me straight inside Maribel's. Hubby and I were greeted right away and told to sit wherever we wanted. Our server was excellent! She got our drink order and brought us some chips and salsa right away. I usually like chunky salsa and this salsa was thin, but it had a lot of good, fresh flavor and the chips were tasty. For $3.99 I ordered a side of Chips and Guacamole and my oh my was it so good! It was made fresh to order and had such great flavor. I'm very impressed at the price of the chips and guac considering it was fresh and the portion was good. If you are a fan of guacamole you must try it here at Maribel's! They have daily specials for just $5 that includes a drink. 

Monday - Chicken Enchiladas 
Tuesday - Carne Asada Tacos
Wednesday - Fish Tacos
Thursday - Carne Asada Burrito
Friday - Chicken Sub
Saturday - Shredded Beef Burrito
Sunday - Hamburger or Cheeseburger

I was there on a Tuesday, so I decided to go with the Carne Asada Tacos. You get 3 tacos, rice, beans and a drink. If you want flour tortillas you can also get that for no additional charge, but you get 2 tacos instead of 3 and our sever said they are bigger than the regular ones. Options are nice! The asada had good flavor and the tacos were filled nicely, especially for the price. The beans were good and the rice was even better. It's awesome that you can get quality food that tastes so good for $5 plus tax and leave stuffed. Inside was clean and they have TV's. I can't say enough about our server. She checked on us often and took the time to chit chat with us for a bit letting us know about other specials and I could tell she was genuinely passionate about the food being served here. They even take phone orders if you don't have time or want to eat inside. I saw several people picking up to-go orders. I don't live in the neighborhood that Maribel's is in, but when I am on this side of town, I will definitely be stopping by for some good grub!

***Like a lot of Vegas restaurants, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is expensive, but the food is very nicely plated and delicious (contemporary food but also tried and true flavor combinations)***

I went to the L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Tokyo two years ago and I had a very good experience so I decided to give the Vegas location a try.  The restaurants are fairly similar.  They both feature very similar decors (sharp reds against dark blacks to give the restaurant a very modern and trendy feel).  Both restaurants also feature bar seating around the open kitchen (a great view of the talented chefs at work).

There are other similarities.  Both locations feature a lot of modern dishes--whether available as small plates or in a seasonal tasting menu.

There are differences as well.  The Tokyo location is much bigger.  The Tokyo location also takes pastry very seriously.  The bread at the Vegas location is decent, but it does not compare that well to the Tokyo location.  The Tokyo location even has a high-end patisserie on site, which features upscale French pastries as well as individual cakes/desserts.

The food was very good at both locations though I probably liked the food at the Vegas location more.  The Tokyo location seemed more representative of the country's cuisine though.  The restaurant featured a lot of Japanese ingredients--whether Japanese fish, Japanese raised beef or mushrooms.  The menu at the Vegas location felt like a menu you might see anywhere.

I went with the tasting menu at the Vegas location and almost everything was very good.  I also added their crispy langoustine as an additional item.  Here is a rundown on their tasting menu.

(Foie gras parfait with port wine and parmesan) This was okay though I wish the foie gras taste was stronger.

(Confit of mediterranean vegetables with fresh mint in a radish cannelloni) The flavors were simple and light, but I liked the varying textures and flavors as well as the presentation.

(Poached oysters with chive migonenette) These were good.  The oysters were warm and soft while the dressing was flavorful.

(Langoustines with green curry and coconut milk) These were exceptional.  The langoustines were sweet and very moist (also very soft).  The garnishes were not that strong, which allowed the flavor of the langoustines to really shine.

(White onion tart topped with smoked applewood bacon, quail egg, parmesan, and asparagus) This was kind of a take on breakfast.  I really liked the crispy (hash brown-like) onion tart as well as the rich yolk of the quail egg.  I thought the bacon could have been crispier.

(Crispy langoustine fritter, basil pesto, salad) I ordered this as an additional course.  The crispy shell of the fritter was good--light, crispy and not greasy.  The basil leaf tucked inside the shell also gave the fritter a nice fragrance.  The langoustine was also good (moist), but it did not have the sweetness or softness of the other langoustine dish.

(John Dory, baby leeks, tomato, buttery shellfish sauce with lime and ginger, pomme puree) This was small but good.  The John Dory was moist and light (though the fish still had a good flavor).  I liked the mix of the butter sauce with the creamy, buttery pomme puree and the fresh tomato and leek salsa.

(Foie gras stuffed quail, pomme puree, herb salad with truffle vinaigrette) Though the foie gras stuffing was just okay, the quail was very good.  It was nicely caramelized and had a great sweet and crispy sear as well as juicy meat.  The sauce was rich and good.  I really liked the herb salad--great freshness and fragrant herbs, much better than micro greens (the also strong in flavor truffle vinaigrette was a great pairing).

(Caramel panna cotta, lemon cookie, vanilla ice cream, strawberries) I really liked the panna cotta--smooth and creamy with a very good caramel flavor.  The vanilla ice cream was great--smooth and dense with a great old-fashioned vanilla bean flavor.

(Berry mousse, tender chocolate cake, blackberries, banana tuile) This was a standard fruit with chocolate dessert.  The mousse was creamy and the chocolate cake (pieces) was not dry but just okay.  I really liked the light tuile, which had a noticeable banana flavor.

Prices were high though the tasting menu seemed to be a much better value than going a la carte.

Service was decent.  Not super attentive and plates lingered a little bit though the food came out relatively fast.  The staff was pleasant.

L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon features very contemporary and artfully designed food, but there is no sacrifice in flavor.  The restaurant focuses on classical flavor combinations (whether from France or other countries/regions), which should please many.  There are a lot of overpriced fine dining spots in Vegas.  L'Atelier is expensive as well, but at least the food is delicious and very memorable.

MGM Grand offers free self-parking (via a structure).

***Bellagio has many iconic Las Vegas elements like the fountains, their seasonal gardens, the popular Cirque du Soleil show O, and high-end cuisine; these features make Bellagio a must visit to at least just take a look; however (on my visit), my room was not as nice as other upscale hotels I have stayed at on The Strip***

When I first visited Las Vegas a long time ago, Bellagio was the most talked about hotel and the most upscale hotel (or at least near the top) on The Strip.  Since then, there have been many new hotels that have joined The Strip and some as elegant or even more elegant than Bellagio.

Bellagio definitely has a beautiful exterior with the impressive and vast lake as well as the signature fountains.  Inside, you will find the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens--a constantly changing (with the seasons) exhibit that makes for a good photo opportunity.  Bellagio also features quite a few notable fine dining spots including Picasso, Le Cirque and Michael Mina.  There is also a gourmet French patisserie (Jean Philippe) though all of these great things are open to the public and do not require a room stay, which is expensive though often less expensive than The Cosmopolitan, Wynn or Encore.

My room was nice.  It was fairly contemporary though there were a lot of traditional touches with the bedding and furniture.  The room did lack the sleek and modern look of the rooms at Aria.

The bathroom was nice--very spacious with standalone showers and bath tubs.  There were a few areas where the room could have been better.  The TV was an old fashioned deep TV and not a flat screen.  I often never turn on a hotel room TV though I imagine some would be disappointed to find such an outdated TV in an upscale hotel like Bellagio.

The other negative, which was a big one, was the room temperature.  The A/C unit was not that good and even after having maintenance look at it, the room just never got cool enough, which can be a concern here due to the very hot summers.  It seems other Yelp reviews indicate the same issue regarding poor A/C units.  However, I believe Bellagio has been refreshing the decor in their rooms so maybe these outdated elements and poor A/C units have been (or will be) improved (I think they have moved onto flat screen TVs).

Also included in the stay was access to the fitness center, which was nice.  The pool area was also nice--many different pools and lots of greens, fountains and other scenery if you are just looking to lounge around.

Service was friendly and prompt.

Room rates are high at Bellagio, but there are times of the year where you can find reasonable room rates.  Bellagio has a room rate calendar on their website, which makes for a useful tool to help you pick a time to stay at Bellagio (best room rates are often during the week though and several top Vegas shows are dark and high end restaurants are closed in the early part of the week).

I wished I liked my room more at Bellagio.  I actually liked Caesars Palace more.  I have heard the quality of the room really varies at which tower you stay at Caesars Palace, but the room I had there felt nicer, more elegant and more comfortable than Bellagio.  And even though my first stay at Aria was at a very small room, my second stay there was at a much bigger room and its modern and sleek look felt more upscale than Bellagio.

If you can get a good room rate at Bellagio though, it can be a good hotel choice on The Strip.  It is still a nice hotel and it has a great location--right next to Caesars Palace and The Cosmopolitan, which is a real hot spot right now.  Even if you do not stay at Bellagio, it is a must visit for first time Las Vegas travelers to check out the Fountains of Bellagio, the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens and some of their food (either a more cost friendly option like Jean Philippe or one of their upscale restaurants like the good-for-Vegas Picasso).

Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free valet and self parking.

My first visit being so-so, I decided to give Teriyaki Madness a second try to see if I liked it any better. For me it was still the same so-so experience and I don't get the hype over this place. Inside is very clean and they have plenty of tables to choose from and the booths are spacious which is nice. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu. Some of the food I ordered was really good and some of it was not so good. I do get coupons in the mail sometimes for BOGO offers, so I can see coming back with a coupon and probably will since the rice and chicken are pretty darn good and I work in the area, but I can't see making a point to come here often. 

Spicy Chicken Teriyaki Plate ($8.99) - I took the white rice that came with it and mixed it with the chicken. I liked the flavor of the chicken a lot. There was a good portion of both rice and chicken. I'd order this again for sure. 

Spicy Beef Teriyaki Plate ($9.49) - For an extra $1 this time I chose noodles instead of rice. The noodles were a bit dry and lacked flavor. The beef was tender and tasted good, but I tasted teriyaki flavor and no spice which was a bummer because I had enjoyed the spicy chicken and the chicken actually kick. The overpowering flavor of teriyaki on this one will most likely mean that I will stick to the spicy chicken instead.

Chicken Egg Roll ($1.99) - Inside I saw tons of what appeared to be black pepper yet the egg roll really had no flavor. It was filled with a generous amount of chicken, but it was greasy and flavorless. 

Chicken Pot Stickers ($3.29) - These were a greasy and overcooked mess. On the menu these are described as "crazy good" and I got 5 of them that were crazy greasy and hard. The inside tasted not so great. I will stick to the stickers elsewhere. 

Stir-Fry Veggies and a Green Salad are each options for sides. The salad came with a sweet dressing that tasted good. The veggies were basic yet tasty and fresh. 

Orders are made fresh so if you are on a lunch break or crunched for time then call your order in so it's ready or at least being made while you are on your way to pick it up.

Las Vegas can be on the extremes at times with all of its glamour and luxury along with the back alley dirt on your dinner table; however, I've never been offended by Vegas until now.

HAZE may be the newest nightclub in town, but it sure won't last very long when the mystery is revealed that there's absolutely nothing special about this club except for a bunch of bouncers in the front all of whom think they are just too good for you. HAZE is not owned by Aria but by the Light Group which runs all of MGM / Mirage property clubs including Jet and the club at Hard Rock. If you've ever been mistreated at those clubs, now you know why. 

First, it's competition like someone mentioned is XS, Tryst, TAO and many other clubs that have amazing features such as beaches and pools, lagoons and pillars towering high above with gorgeous views of the strip. They have elegant and impressive bars and table areas. They have huge dance floors in multiple places and interesting tidbits like the girls in the bathtubs at TAO or the dancers at the pole at Tryst. Unfortunately for HAZE, they don't seem to have any of these features except for a small stage which divides the already small dance floor that contains a pole. They boast about having special shows that no other clubs have, but it's nothing more than going to a strip club on a B-grade night where a bald, head shaven female will come out and perform for you while hundreds watch on and wonder why she has no hair and is made up to look so scary instead of sexy.

This club is SMALL. It cannot hold many people and of all the people it does hold, its about 90% girls. No they will not go home with you nor will they party with you because they also have the same attitude as the bouncers in the front. Too. Good. For. You.

If you are a guy and you are trying to get in to this club, please save yourself some time and heartache because you will not get in even if you grease the bouncer $100+. If you get a table, you will have to deal with the fact that there's literally no space for you to dance and the waitress seems to be always missing so you can't get any service after paying $300 for a bottle of alcohol you can get from Costco in a bigger size for $55+tax. Even if you have 10 girls and 1 guy, the guy will get redirected to another line that will not move, and will be dispersed by the bouncers saying they are at capacity for people so cannot let anymore people in (but then will usher in 10 girl groups).

Despite the poor layout, poor design, poor air quality and extremely expensive drinks (mixed drinks for $20? are you kidding me? not even the Wynn has these kinds of prices for a Vodka and Pineapple), HAZE tries to limit to zero the number of guys going into the club.

Lets step back for a second. If the girls get in free, and guys buy girls drinks, and guys are in the club to find girls and are willing to pay to find and buy these girls drinks ... aren't guys the STAPLE of the Las Vegas clubbing scene? So why is it that every other club has this figured out already except for the newest supposedly "hippest" club in town?

Regardless, being a hotel guest I expected to have no problems getting in with the bf. We waited in line, like normal people would. We had VIP passes from our stay at Aria. We did not bitch, moan, complain or make a scene. Somehow, we were still separated after 45 minutes of waiting in line only to say that I could get in free but he would have to stay behind and wait in a line that may or may not get in at all. 

And when I tried to find someone to explain the situation where we were guests of the hotel, had waited for a long time, had VIP passes and there's no reason for me to be in a club by myself while he's out there waiting ... the main floor manager Mike cussed at me, shoved me physically and told me I had to get in or get out while completely being RUDE and did not listen to ANYTHING I had said. 

I understand Vegas is different, I understand guys have to pay more than girls, I understand they are trying to keep the girl to guy ratio high. What I don't understand is why someone has to be RUDE and use INAPPROPRIATE language in front of me when I have not done anything except ask if he could give me a minute so I could explain how I was frustrated at the situation. There's NO reason for him to put his hands on me, there is NO reason for him to be rude. 

Please take your business elsewhere. HAZE is not worth your time, their attitude is not worth you having to put up with it, and you will have a far better time at XS or TAO once you find out that HAZE is nothing more than smoke and mirrors located in a dingy basement with some lighting, overpriced drinks, and no room at all to move.

First and foremost this is my first review and I cant believe how absolutely appalled I am.  But, here it goes.....So my wife and I are in town for a family emergency and decided to have lunch because we had a lil time on our hands. We drove past HAG on LV blvd and it caught my eye because of the name and I love a great burger. Upon entering I was excited and looking forward to it the place seems almost like a Hooters but for Burgers. The smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicky for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear items that others have wore before but I figured hey WTH the waitress we had was very personable and  nice but was new. the prices were very high for such a simple menu. My wife ordered the smallest burger and fries and I was talked into the Quad bypass burger. with like 20 strips of bacon! I asked our waitress if the restaurant offered military discount as I often do when I am on a budget and travelling. She said "Let me ask" upon returning she said "No sorry" I was thanked her for asking. Either way I though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so I was looking forward to the food regardless. At this point I was very excited and amused on the place and was talking to my wife about how this place should/would be a goldmine. They offered malt liquor (Strange in a restaurant)in a can I ordered a Tecate she a sugar Coke.
Now for the twist of events..... Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes which is great but I was skeptical, The Burger was massive and looked so good but it was warm to the touch at best I had approx 3 bites and noticed the bacon looked as if had been microwaved from being cooked days ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistency-(Gross) The cheese was not melted, The fries looked like they were cooked in old oil due to the almost black color in nature. I tried my hardest to stomach this but I couldnt. I proceeded to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cooked to order at first she replied yes and then said something that made me raise an eyebrow, she began on informing me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old because of the way the owner is. I asked her to elaborate and she said he is so cheap that he makes his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut costs. She also informed me she almost walked out her second day on the job because of what he acts like in his day to day operations. She looked excited when I asked to speak to him about the quality and preparation of my food. When the Owner/manager Jon came to the table he sat down opposite from me and was very hostile. At this point I was pretty much amazed I would assume he would address my concerns in a professional and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimidation and apprehension. I said I would please like another burger due to the dissatisfaction of it not being fresh. He looks at myself and my wife and says' " In six years I have never comped a meal and it won't be today!!" I proceeded to inform him I simply wanted another burger and I am not looking for a comp. He then informed us that he would call the police if we didnt pay I said I would not pay for a burger like this especially one that i didnt touch. From his demeanor at this point I wanted to leave so i said look I will pay for my wifes and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this quality of food.
At this point I felt threatened and was basically being held against my own will. I said fine Please call the police. He proceeds to lean over and say, You know what " you started it when you asked for a discount" I was like "What"? He then says I cant stand the "F" ing military I was so appalled that he was addressing me like this in general and then he begins to say, I'm from Oxnard, Ca. and we used to beat the "S" out of filthy mexicans like you! At this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief He leaves and the table next to me were also expressing there disgust in the food and as he saw us speaking with them he said to leave right now we were trespassing! As I leave I attempt to tip my waitress and he rips the money from my hand! My wife and I wait outside for the police THE WHOLE TIME WE are waiting quietly the owner is harrassing us going on a tirade about my race and my occupation being totally distasteful in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up (LVPD) I provide them ID and they are in absolute disbelief they resolve the issue after questioning and bottom line it does not matter the police officer said I had to pay I totally understand and uphold the law but requested that I receive what I pay for (At least I gave it away to a homeless man.
BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: 1. DO NOT GO THERE FOR QUALITY OR FRESHNESS  IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS NOT 2. THE OWNER IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING. 3.YOU ARE WARNED. PLEASE DONT BE ROBBED OR DEGRADED LIKE ME  GO ANYWHERE ELSE.

I remember when a couple of other businesses occupied this location that Weiss Deli is at so I was skeptical about if Weiss was like them or not. The reviews and delicious pictures on yelp got my to finally try this Jewish deli. It is tucked in the corner of a shopping center. They have a decent amount of tables and chairs outside if eating outdoors is your thing. Inside is clean, but the decor is dated. The booth I sat at had gashes in the seat. The inside isn't very big so I imagine trying to eat here on the weekend is a zoo. When you walk inside towards the left they have bagels & pastries for sale. I took a look but the case was empty and I was told by our server that they sell out quick in the mornings. They have a board when you enter that tells you what specials are going on that day.

They have a section on the menu that says "not so hungry" for those feeling like they can't tackle a whole sandwich themselves. You get 1/2 of a sandwich (your choice from the sandwich station area on the menu) and your choice of either a cup of soup, fries, coleslaw,  potato salad or fresh fruit on the side. I decided to order this priced at $9.95 and I can assure you that you do need to be hungry unlike the menu claims because the portions are generous. I decided to try the "Chicken Noodle Soup" and it was the best I have e-v-e-r had in my life! It was hardly a cup like the menu suggests and was filling all by itself. I could just sip on the broth for days! The soup had a couple bagel chips on the side that had such a nice garlic flavor. For my sandwich I went with the "Roast Turkey" on challah bread. The 1/2 sandwich was so big that I had to cut it in half just to eat it. The bread was seriously delicious!  I could only eat a portion of my sandwich and took the rest home for later. My hubby ordered a "Pastrami Burger" priced at $9.95 that came with a side of fries. He said the pastrami had good flavor. 

I saw on the menu they offer catering. 

The next time I stop in I will be trying out something from their tasty looking breakfast menu. I would stop in when working on this side of town just to get some of the soup to-go!

My favorite buffet in VEGAS!!! 

I came here close to when it opened years ago and remembered loving it and finally got a chance to return and i was happy it was still as good as i remember. 

Off the strip, i came here with my family after outlet shopping on a wednesday lunch. We heard about a senior deal for people over 50, but unfortunately THEY ENDED THE SENIOR DEAL. Still, it's a great deal as we only paid $16.00 per person and they have one of the biggest selections and also UNLIMITED WINE AND BEER AND GELATO!!!

PRICES: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=aVc7XXpYbfEx0zQX1169bA

Breakfast M-F 7am-10:30 $11
Lunch M-F 10:30-2:30 $16
Dinner M-Th 4pm-9pm $24
Seafood Brunch Sat/Sun 9am-2:30pm  $34
Seafood Dinner  Fri: 4pm-10pm $34
                               Sat/Sun 2:30-10pm $34

Recommendation: Go for a late breakfast and stay for lunch items, which is plenty of food!

If u want crab legs, don't bother going during the weekday lunches (not sure if they have it during weekday dinners) cuz they dont' have any.

BUT, there's so much stuff! Everything was pretty good except for the sushi, which was terrible that day. Really hard rice! :(
However, i enjoyed DESSERT the best as you can see from my pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=-2R7iQN7p-BTqDGQACzHXA
Creme Brulee, meringue cookies, carrot cake, RV cupcakes, panna cotta, tiramisu, mousse cake, chocolate cake. GELATO of many kinds, tarts, 

MEATS: Brisket, ribs, tri tip, pork loin,ham

Others: small selection of chinese food/mediterranean/mexican /indian.mussels, seafood ciopinno, shrimp scampi, baked ziti, BACON, fried shrimp, fried mushrooms, fried chicken, mash, asparagus, sweet potatoes with marshmallows, cream corn and spinach 

Sad to see some of the prices have hiked up since i originally went, but i would definitely recommend this place if ur tired of waiting in huge long lines and paying the same price or more and getting charged extra for drinks. 

Located in the M Resort- that blue building u see off to the right before you get to the strip. A great place to stop on the way home!

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Imagine you had a long day. And you wanted to relax and indulge in something incredibly scrumptious, delectable, and sinfully good.  Well... Think Sow.  Salty Sow.

We were over near the PV Mall and we decided, spur of the moment, to get something nearby. We thought of sushi and a few other places. But then we saw the three golden neon arrows pointing to the front door of the Salty Sow. 

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
The Salty Sow has that nouveau feel to it. The bar is off to the left as you enter, with a large kitchen straight in front of you. You see a lot of wood and interesting lighting (photos). But the feeling is very intimate. Even with other diners nearby, you cannot hear their conversations. The clientele is mixture of millennials and older, with a dozen or so sitting at both the bar and the dinning area. 

MENU:
Like most places in the Valley, the Happy Hour menu is a jumping off point for the  Dinner menu. When you are seated you are given both menus. There seems to be no pressure to order off of one or the other. The focus of the food is all things pork. So if you love bacon, then you have found your Nirvana in this life. LOL

Almost all the items on the Happy Hour menu are $5,00 and you find things like: Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries, Truffled Deviled Eggs, Pork Belly Tacos and Braised Beef Tacos and much, much more

SERVICE:
Everything is relaxed and our server Holly was excellent.  Folks stop by and ask about your meal and dishes are bused quickly

FOOD:
Okay, the best thing we tried was the HH Fried Chicken that came with a honey glaze and a large sweet potato biscuit (photo).  Even here there was bacon on the underside of the chicken.  It was moist, flavorful and delicious!

We also order two tacos which were equally good that came with a fried egg on top (photo).  But you must try the Duck Fat Fries, which were seasoned with herbs and salt.  It also comes with a poached egg yoke on top (photo).  Great stuff.

PRICES:
Everything at Happy Hour is $5.00 and it ends at 6:30 with the ringing of a cow bell.  Ahh, "we need more cow bells!"  LOL  Our bill came to $37.50 before taxes and gratuities, including two items to go and a soft drink ($2.50).

Debbie Downer:
Just before the check, we asked our server if we could order two items to go.  We also asked what the up-charge would be.  To our surprise, she said it would be the same price.

As we were leaving, the Culinary Manager approached us and said: 
"We normally don't allow people to order off the Happy Hour menu to go."  As I stamered to say we had checked first with our server, she said: "I'm going to let it go this time, but don't do it again."

The food is outstanding but you have to wait for it. Is it worth it?

The Oyster Bar is inside the Palace Station Casino. The bar only has 18 seats. 

We got here at 8:30 pm on a Monday thinking we could avoid the infamous wait. No such luck, eleven people ahead of us in line. The line did not move for 40 minutes. When it finally moved, it went quick. At the one hour mark, we got seated. Yay. 
Well not so fast. 

After you're seated, you're given a sourdough roll and butter. Thank you, thank you thank you. We were starving and that helped a lot. A few minutes go by and they take our order. We waited so long I memorized what we wanted a half an hour ago lol. 

40 minutes later our soup comes out. 
An hour & 15 minutes from being seated we got the oysters. 
At the two hour mark from being seated we got our entrees. 
3 hour 15 minutes from waiting in line to finishing our meal. 
Was it worth it?

Here's the rundown:
New England Clam Chowder - Delicious. The bowl was full of clams and the soup was just outstanding. 

Oyster (a dozen) - was so so good. Cocktail sauce, horseradish and lemon accompanied the oysters. One of the best oysters I've ever had. The chef was having problems with one of the oysters (didn't want to stay in the shell) we were playfully teasing him about it and he was such a sport about it. We all had a good laugh and he put an extra oyster in for us. A bakers dozen, all delicious. 

Plaza Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab, chicken and andouille sausage. It's my first pan roast and it was delicious. The brandy and cream was a good combination. All the proteins were cooked perfectly. I specially liked the andouille sausage, a little hint of spiciness worked well with the broth.  I got a number 7 on the heat scale. It was not spicy for me at all. I could not finish my bowl, it was so rich and I had a lot of oysters. Lol. I will have a good lunch tomorrow for sure. 

I was also able to taste the following dishes. 
Combo Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab and lobster. My Mom's choice. Zero on the heat scale. It was as good as mine. Tasted the lobster and that was very good. Good amount of it too. Lol. 

Bouillabaisse - was so good. My brother's dish. 7 on the heat scale. It was spicy. Ouch. But it was really good. The broth was clean and very flavorful. It had shrimp, crab, lobster, mussels & clams. Great broth. I would get this next time. 

Service was excellent. The chef was friendly and entertaining. 

The wait. It didn't bother me at all. It was more entertaining than anything else. I got to talk to other people waiting in line and making fun of the situation we were in. I even got to meet a couple of local Yelpers and she told us about a Korean/Mexican fusion restaurant (Komex). The 3 hours went by really fast. 

It's an experience I won't soon forget and isn't that why we go to these places and go through all the hoops. Lol
Was it worth it?
I say Yes!!

We had great service
We had great food. 
We had great conversations
We had a memorable night. 

I'll definitely be back

The Noob's guide to a $20 massage at Bali!

If you guys reading this are like me, you would consider yourself very INEXPERIENCED when it comes to massages in general.  And of course, you've heard plenty of stories about the shady Asian Massage parlors in Vegas LOL.  

Since I am now an expert (jk only been one time lol), I will HELP you out and let you know what to expect!



1)  I showed up with no appointment, but was promptly welcomed and walked to the back.  Maybe during prime time, you might have to wait, but I had NO WAIT on a Thursday around 630pm.  Maybe if you enjoy a particular masseuse, you could schedule an appointment with that person, but since it was my first visit, I only showed up with a dumb look on my face lol.

2)  There are no upsells or uncomfortable requests for additional money.  There were no options, no choices.  No drinks or products to buy.  You walk in for a massage, and you drop a $20 bill on the table on the way out.  Simple and CHEAP...I like that!

3)  I was walked into the back into a large community room with tall cubical-like partitions set up  (BTW, there were places for me to CHARGE my phone).  It is very dark in there, but because it is not a private area, you should probably leave your clothes on, which brings me to my next point :

4)  Wear COMFORTABLE clothing.  I came in with a T-shirt, Jeans and tied tennis shoes, but I should have came in a tank top, shorts, and sandals.  They rub this very low scented lotion pretty much everywhere, so you don't want that crap on your good clothes, as well as them getting rolled up and wrinkled.  Your hair gets all messed up too...don't plan on going out lookin your best when you're finished.

5)  Once you get your area, take off your socks/shoes etc, and relax....maybe put your phone on silent.  My masseuse was there after about 5min with a bucket of hot water for my feet. 

6)  The massage itself : Probably depends on your masseuse for the most part.  Mine was a middle aged lady with a bit of meat on her, and was the perfect "STRENGTH" I needed.  I am a wuss...I don't need anyone breaking my back or gettin super deep-tissue on me, but if you do, ask for it!  As well as once you are on your chair...TELL EM if they need to go easy or harder on ya.

7)  Mine started off with my forehead, hair and scalp, temples, behind the ears (OMG YES!) and then to the neck.  Shoulders, arms and hands were next, to the feet/calves/thighs and then to the back.  I would imagine I could have asked for more or less time in any of the areas, and it would have been acceptable.

8)  My massage lasted about an hour and fifteen from sit down to leaving.  I never noticed her checking her watch, but she kept me BUSY pretty much the entire session.  I felt great right after the massage, and felt a lil beat up the next day.  Nothing crazy, just like a good workout at the gym.

9)  On the way out, she offered water and sat at a bench by the front door to get her tip I presume.  Drop your $20 bill at the front, and then your tip to your masseuse. 

10)  As for the TIP, that obviously depends on your masseuse, your overall experience, and your personal pocketbook.  I won't tell you what to pay, but my experience was wonderful, and I would have personally felt cheap droppin a $5 bill for an hour of hands on work.  I spent $10 and she seemed happy...maybe if it was enlightening, I would have tipped more, but for a great massage, I think $10 was fair.  Still at $30 that's crazy cheap!  I might come here once every week or two!



I know most of this is common sense to the seasoned veteran, but I can't be the only one that has been living under a rock!!

Hope some of this helped the fellow noob!  I know it would have helped me if I would have read this before my first visit :P

Now go get your $20 massage!

Originally hubby and I were going to try a different place, but it was too packed so I decided to look up what was nearby on the yelp app. I had Fat Boy bookmarked and it was only a couple of blocks from where we tried to eat first, so we headed to Fat Boy.

Walking inside there wasn't much space and there were plenty of customers. There are maybe 4 or 5 tables and we were lucky enough after ordering to snatch one up. The food is made to order and since it was busy we had to wait our turn for our food to come out, but I was patient since it smelled of yummy pizza throughout the place and the vibe inside was awesome.

I asked the man who took our order if the bacon was made fresh since this would alter if I would order it or not. He said that indeed was! I ordered a "BLT Sandwich" priced at just $3.24 for the sandwich by itself, or $6.23 to make it a combo with fries and a drink. I made mine a combo and substituted regular fries for "Chencho Fries" which was a very smart decision. The BLT came out on a burger bun with fresh shredded lettuce, tomato and mayo. I was surprised at the amount of bacon on the sandwich for the price. I was pleased with the flavor of the BLT and would happily order it again with a little extra mayo. You can order the Chencho Fries with skinny or fat fries. The cashier suggested the skinny fries so I went with that and hubby had the fat fries with his. The Chencho Fries have a little bit of chicken with green sauce and cheese. Yum! I loved these fries! Get over here and try these fries! Hubby had a "Pastrami Boyger" and couldn't stop talking about how good the pastrami was so we came back a couple days later for dinner again!

This time hubby went with a full on "Pastrami Sandwich" and loved it. I knew after smelling the pizza a couple days before that I had to give it a try. They have a pick-up only special where you can get a 14" one topping pizza for $5.49 so I was all over that! I ordered a cheese pizza and a side of ranch to dip it in. The owner (turns out this was who took our order the first time) came over to our table and talked to me about the pizza and how he makes the dough from scratch everyday. The pizza was cheesy and the sauce and crust tasted great. I just can't believe how good it tastes for such a great price. I don't live near Fat Boy, but it's worth the drive and I will absolutely be back! 

They offer a good variety of menu options from pizza, boygers, wings, fingers, salads, sandwiches, milkshakes, bottled drinks and fountain drinks. They also offer boyrritos, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas and even serve breakfast! They have different specials and family deals too.

I ate here for Restaurant Week Spring 2014 and again the following night from their regular menu. The portions here are nice and the different types of dishes on the menu make it hard to decide what to order. Our server, Perry is fantastic! He checked on us often and made sure everything was to our liking. Managers, Adam and Christopher also stopped by our table at different times to introduce themselves and make sure we were enjoying everything. I could tell that not just the managers care about the experience of every customer, but the servers and rest of the employees do too.

The cost for the RW week dinner was $30.14 per person which I found to be a very fair price considering what I got. I had the following:

Buddy's Caprese

Chicken Parm & Spaghetti

Zeppole

The next day I at the following:

The meal started out with warm bread and oil and balsamic. Nice start!

Buddy's Caprese ($16) - This salad is sooooo good! It had charred green beans, burrata, tomatoes and balsamic. The variety of tomatoes and different colors of them were nice. The tomatoes tasted so fresh. The burrata was fantastic! So soft and tasted great. 

Buddy's Salumi and Cheese Board ($21) - Prosciutto, spicy capicola, genoa salami, gorgonzola, pecorino, grana padano, pickled veggies, olives and grilled bread arranged beautifully on a cheese board. The meats had such great flavor and the olives (they contain pits) had a nice garlic flavor to them. All the cheeses were good, but the gorgonzola was my favorite. It was creamy and easy to spread on the garlic toast. Delish!

Chicken Parm & Spaghetti ($23) - This is oven baked with provolone and mozzarella. I thought mine from the night before was soggy, so I asked that it be cooked longer this time and it was just perfect. Nice and crispy were is should be and the cheeses tasted good. The spaghetti on the side had marinara on it and parmesan and even though I barely had room, I couldn't let it go to waste! I did take half of my chicken parm home and it reheated nicely. 

Lisa's Warm Nutella Cake ($9) - The cake was warm and baked perfectly. It also came with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream that was excellent. 

Zeppole ($9) - These are served hot and coated in a spiced sugar. 2 dipping sauces accompany them, lemon raspberry jam and chocolate. The raspberry jam I wasn't crazy about, but the chocolate dipping sauce tasted great. 

They also have a kid's menu as well a lunch menu that offers burgers and sandwiches. I am eager to come back and check some of the sandwiches out. I was very pleased with the service, food and atmosphere. The first night, we sat at a table near the bar area next to a large window that overlooks the strip. The next night we sat at a booth that was closer to the kitchen. Both are different experiences so try them both! They also can host events here.

When you combine the quality of ingredients, service and tremendous value, Soho is a place worth coming back to again and again.  Dinner for 4 came out to around $60 before tip and we got to try a nice variety of dishes.

It was easy to see and taste the high grade fish they used right off the bat in the "Seared Tuna Special" which included crispy shallots, sweet onion, micro greens and chili oil combined with super fresh nigiri cuts of maguro.  This was a terrific mix of flavors.  $11!  That's about 50% off the strip price.  I almost wished I didn't have to share it.  

I couldn't turn my back on the $3 (!!) Soho Tostadas and went with the tuna with Hawaiian poke sauce.  The tostada itself was made of taro and there were some delicious chunks of tuna on top mixed with cilantro and avocado cream.  Another great starter for sure.  The rock shrimp done tempura style was also nice portion for $7 and came with 3 unique sauces that I fail to remember the details of since my wife was seriously sweating the end of the Seahawks/Rams Monday night game due to some sports bets she had.  It was nice they had one TV up.

Hydro Bibb Black Cod for $5 was a total freakin tease that ensured I'll get a full order of miso marinated black cod the next time.  Even the smaller portioned cod were cooked really well and the combo of cool lettuce, crispy wontons and fish was kind of like a deluxe protein taco.  

Those all were excellent opening acts for what I was personally here for which was the short rib dish.  Ever since I saw that one picture of all those short ribs being grilled, I knew it was destiny!  It totally delivered.  The one rib was like something out the The Flintstones and tasted as good as it looked.  It was juicy and so tender that you could've just picked at it with chopsticks sans fork and knife.  

The chef and owner of Soho, John Chien Lee, stopped by our table to ask how things were and gave us a breakdown on the business.  We were still open to one more dish so I asked him for a recommendation.  He asked what we liked and we said salmon.  He asked if we wanted something cooked or raw and we said raw.  He said he'd make something special for us off the menu (YES!) and 10 minutes later brought over this delectable dish with 8 pieces of scallop wrapped with salmon topped with a little green, lemon and some other stuff I can't remember.  John whipped up this dish thinking it would be a great finish to the meal after the heaviness of the short rib and MAN was he right.  Then he told us it was on the house!  Thanks, John!!  I suck for not taking photos of anything.  

Las Vegas strip quality for locals!  Check it out.

They sell pizza by the slice, so originally that was the plan. On the way in though I noticed a pizza special on the window for a $9.99 large (pick-up/carryout). I thought that was a great price to try out their pizza and this way it would be a freshly made pizza. Walking in it looked like a typical deli. There were tables inside and the usual pasta, tomato sauce, etc. for sale. The olives, meats and sweets they offer look very good, but they have no prices on anything. There are plenty of signs along the glass case promoting catering and their win on "Sandwich Wars" yet nothing saying how much per pound or per slice anything was. Maybe they were changing out prices and I came at an off time, but if I have to ask how much something is... I'm more than likely to just pass all together. 

The guy who took the order was nice and when I showed him my yelp check-in deal for a free "Mini Cannoli" he made sure I marked it *used* and said it would be with my order. He also said it would be about 10-ish minutes for the pizza to be made and that was cool by me. When the food was ready I checked my bag and there was no Cannoli. I had to ask for it and the girl who handed me the food acted like she had no idea about it and had to ask around. Finally, the guy who took the order came out and said "yeah yeah they get a free mini" so she went and packaged one up for me. 

The pizza deal wont be going on forever. The guy told me that they would be stopping it soon. Don't fret! If you get down here before it ends you will get a card that gets you the large cheese pizza for $9.99 every time. Score! 

Wow! The pizza was pretty darn good! I love when something as simple as a cheese pizza tastes so good. It seems lately I have been experiencing bland pizza, but not here. The sauce has a good flavor and I like the crust. I had some left over for lunch the next day and it was just as good cold! The Cannoli made for a nice dessert. I enjoyed it. 

They deliver!

This ranks high on one of the most amazing and unusual culinary adventures that I've ever had.

A friend tipped me off that this chicken place was opening this week.  I so wanted to go, but I had another gig, and figured that I'd miss out.  As it so happened, said gig ended just early enough for me to go right before closing, so the missus and I hightailed it to ensure that we got there before closing.

Oh yes, there was a line.

And so we waited.  And waited.  However, the staff came out and started giving away free cornbread.  I'm... just not a big cornbread fan, but I figured "Why not", and bit into it.

o_O

It was amazing.  Super sweet, like cake.  I ate two pieces while the line trudged on.

As we got closer to the door, another staff member came out and started handing out copies of Flav's autobiography.  And now I had something to read while waiting.  People said that Flavor Flav himself was in the kitchen cooking, and sure enough, he was.  No clock because of health reasons, but he was hands deep in prepping chicken.  The place is small, and not flashy.  Public Enemy was playing over the speakers, and a few pictures of Flav hanging with other famous folk, but the size and decor were subdued.

In between food prep breaks, he came out and talked to people, posing for photos, and signing autographs before rushing back to the food.

I placed my order, and waited.  And waited. 

And waited.

Turns out, they simply weren't prepared for the mass onslaught of people at the end, and had to rush like crazy to get everyone's order covered.  The staff looked exhausted having been there all day, but they were nothing but friendly, even tempered, and soldiered on, saying that they are here to be the best.  Flav even came out in between food prep breaks to let people know how genuinely appreciative he was that so many people came out to support him, and just bless everyone.  He's going to make this right.  And that included getting down to the last order perfect.  "If anyone were to get a raw piece of chicken", he said, "you can come up and punch me in the face."

It was nearing midnight by the time the final 10 orders were being serviced.  He was dead set on making everything perfect, and thanked us over and over for our patience.  I have never seen someone work so hard in my life.  Forgot the rapping and reality show work.  The man is a juggernaut in the kitchen.  His staff are class and all were working like crazy to get food done, and keep people happy.

When I finally got my order, it was past midnight, so I wished him happy birthday.  As I got handed my bag, I called out to him to say thank you for working so hard for us.  I felt it was the least I could do.

With that, he stopped, came over to me, and shook my hand profusely, thanking me for coming out, being patient, and bless me for being so supportive.  I've come across of a lot of celebrities, famous people, and well knowns in my time.  Flavor Flav is honestly one of the nicest, most genuine people I've ever met.

Past midnight, I finally dragged home, more excited than tired by the wackiness of the adventure, and how fun the whole experience was.  And then I sunk my teeth into the first bite of the chicken.

....

o_O

My God.... 

It is, hands down, the best fried chicken that I've had in Las Vegas, if not possibly ever.  It is absolutely, utterly remarkable.  I don't know what Flav puts in that fried chicken skin, but Colonel Sanders deserves a demotion in rank and can kiss Flav's backside, for Sanders or Popeye are no longer the masters.  I devoured chicken like a Mogwai from Gremlins, and even cold the next day, I gnawed on the remaining pieces with glee.  The mac and cheese is excellent.  I even liked the french fries quite a bit.

So if there was ever a "bucket list" item that you never knew you had or even wanted, I can now cross off that Flavor Flav personally hand prepped and cooked me one of the best fried chicken meals that I have ever had in my life.

You'll need this experience on your bucket list.  You don't know how much you really do.

I will heartily go back to this diamond of a chicken place in a microsecond.  I am stunned.

Looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant in downtown Las Vegas? Look no further.  La Comida has arrived.  

New restaurants are opening left and right in Las Vegas, especially in the downtown area.  One things for sure, La Comida is a refreshing change from your usual bar food, appetizers, and fried food.  Here at La Comida, you get authentic tasting Mexican dishes.  When you think of Morton's, their steakhouse, N9NE, Ghostbar, and Rain comes to mind.  And because this is a Morton's establishment, expect no less than quality, upscale, and great service. 

My first thought upon arriving here was "Wow".  Although this place was packed on their very first night, we were greeted by almost every staff member.  Smiles are free and we got them.  My second thought, another "Wow".  Las Vegas' who's who was here tonight.  I'm not going to mention names, but the energy was surely in the air tonight.  

There's seating indoors, at the bar, and at the patio outside.  The ambiance includes an attentive staff, wide open restaurant, and a ton of people watching.  Can you imagine this place on the weekend? This restaurant was extremely busy, but there's no rush once you're in and no one seems to be rushing you out.  In other words, this restaurant has a chill feel to it.

As for the food, you really can't go wrong.  Everything made here is authentic. The food was so authentic that I even had a tough time reading the menu.  But our lovely server, Camila, took the time to give us her recommendations and even gave me a short Spanish lesson. My main dish was their Carne de res a la Parrilla (beef skirt steak).  The steak is prepared to your liking on top of a bed of mushrooms and peppers.  The wild mushrooms were so good that I could eat a bowl of this stuff ala carte.  As for the steak itself, I wish I had seconds it was that juicy. Terri R had their Camaron de Golfo (buttered shrimp dish) and for dessert their Platanos Fritos (banana w/ice cream).  It's obvious that Terri loved her dish since she finished the whole thing.  Plus, she told me numerous times "I love my food".  

It's awesome when new restaurants open in Las Vegas, specifically Downtown Las Vegas. Owners Jenna and Michael Morton open it's doors today on an invite only with an expectation to open officially mid-week.  Jenna and Michael didn't miss a beat with their soft opening.  The restaurant was fully staffed, the talent at the bar kept patrons drinks full, and the ambiance matches what us locals expect at DTLV.  Even better, they took the time to meet, greet, and take photos with everyone.  My suggestion...visit or bookmark this place for a fun and happening dining experience.

I attempted Cafe Zupas on opening day and the line was so long out the door that I decided to wait. It was worth it! Cafe Zupas is kind of like Panera Bread, serving sandwiches, soups, salads and bakery stuff. The only thing different is Cafe Zupas is much fresher and tastier! 

When you first walk in they have large easy to read menu boards. You place your order telling them what you want on what, pay for your food and find a table where your food is brought out to you. They have a pretty good amount of seating offering tables as well booths. 

Sandwiches by themselves are $4.99 each, salads by themselves are $4.99 for the half size and $6.99 for the large size, soups are $3.99 for the half size and $5.99 for the large size.

There is a  "Try 2 Combo" priced at $7.99 where you can pick from two of the following:
- Whole Sandwich
- Half Soup
- Half Salad 

I ordered the "Honey Bacon Club" and "Summer Chicken Salad" from the try 2 combo. The portion size was great. The honey bacon club is a grilled panini with turkey, ham, bacon, tomatoes, muenster cheese and honey mustard. So good! I will order this one again for sure. The summer chicken salad has chicken, fresh strawberries, cashews, dried cranberries, grapes, mixed greens and strawberry vinaigrette dressing. The salad tasted to fresh and yummy! They have over a dozen salads to choose from so there is a nice variety to choose from each time. A really nice touch was the chocolate covered strawberry that came complimentary with my meal! Hubby got one with his too! Hubby ordered a "Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup" that was put of this world delicious! I ended up getting a spoon and sharing it with him it was just so good. The soup is whole heads of cauliflower blended together with cheddar and pepper jack cheese. Bacon was added for an additional 59 cents. Fresh bread also comes with the meal so it was nice to dip in the soup!

So I saw a dessert in the case that called my name. It was the "Sinful 7 Chocolate Cake" priced at $4.49 and I got it to-go. This cake is any true chocolate lovers dream come true! It lives up to it's name and is sinfully good.

The drink bar offers 16 different fountain drinks with free Italian Soda flavorings. If you have a device that needs some juice then you can take advantage if the recharge bar. They do offer catering, but if they offer online ordering I didn't see anything about it. There is a sign that says they do not take tips, but will gladly clean up your dishes (yep they use real dishes) and table when you are finished. The customer service was fantastic and the inside was very clean. I will be back!

I believe you need a lot of sophistication to enjoy Japanese Curry. It's just these small little differences with the spices that separates  a J-Curry place from being "good" and "great". And, I believe that JAPANESE CURRY ZENBAYASHI has achieved Greatness. 

This is a rare Japanese restaurant where they pay attention to the smallest details. For example, today the Rakkyo was perfectly cut in a distinct geometric style, which made every single piece look identical in size and shape. At first, I thought I was seeing things but eventually after watching Mr. Zenbayashi working so carefully in the kitchen, I came the conclusion that they spend hours before the store opens preparing everything to look beautiful and artistic.

Unlike similar restaurants, JCZ will refrigerate the condiments such as Tonkatsu Sauce, Rakkyo, and Fukujinzuke. They wait till a customer arrives and then they bring them out with new clean serving spoons. Other places around town will merely keep the condiments sitting out on the table all day long with the same serving spoons which had been touched by many dirty hands. But, you won't find that problem here. This is the most spotless and clean restaurant I have seen in Las Vegas.  Even the bathroom looked like no one had ever used it. 

Just like INABA, this place prides itself on having a dish that not only tastes great, but has tons of health benefits. They have a homemade Gram Masala which is a combination of about 15 spices such as Turmeric, Coriander, Black Pepper, Cumin, Cardamom, Fennel, Japanese Chili Pepper, Ginger, Garlic, Paprika, and many more. Unlike Indian Curry, J-Curry is lower in calories and fat content. It also has anti-oxidents, digestive benefits, blood cleansing, and even anti-aging benefits. 

I actually came here by accident today, I spent most of the day loitering at Jen G's place of work.  After about 3 hours of bugging her, she told me to "BUY SOMETHING OR GET OUT!", so I went straight to JCZ! ...Just kidding. Actually, the true story does involve me loitering at Jen G's place of employment, but we had a conversation about Kabuto, and both of us agreed we should go there and give it another try. I actually didn't like my last visit to Kabuto on account of being spoiled by Urusawa in LA. But, I ended up going over there anyway  to make a reservation. While I was in the parking lot, I noticed the JCZ sign.  David Y had recommended the place to me earlier, and he told me that it was exactly what he used to get in Japan, so I gave it a try. And Dave was right, it was the best. I don't know why people would rather eat at overrated Monta when JAPANESE CURRY ZEN is only a 15 second walk. And the best part of JCZ is that it doesn't have a 2 hour waiting list, uncomfortable seating, overflowing toilet, hipsters and emos reciting poetry, and non-japanese cooks who cook the eggs in the back alley(read my review on Monta to understand that better). And that's another thing that makes JCZ great, it's 100% Japanese staffed. Sure, I actually know Chinese and Filipino Sushi Chefs who make some Japanese ones look like amateurs, but the point is that it's always so unique to find a J-restaurant that is 100% Japanese staffed.

The best thing on the menu is the Pork Tenderloin Curry. Do not confuse this with the normal Pork Cutlet. The Pork Tenderloin Curry will not be on the main menu. You have to ask for it specifically. Today, the cook put so much attention into making sure the cutlet was fried perfectly. The color was beautifully golden brown, and the texture of the meat was so juicy and soft that I ended up eating it all in less than 5 minutes. 

This was the best service I have ever had as a 1st timer. Sure, there are some Japanese owned restaurants that treat me better, but that's because I've spent a lot of money there. For example, when I walk into "Sushi on Rainbow", it's like that scene in "Goodfellas" when Robert De Niro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they open the door for him, save him  his usual seat, and everyone gets whatever he wants before he even has to ask. That's how good some places treat me because I show up regularly, I treat older Japanese workers with a lot of respect,  and because I'm f*cking rich I tend to leave giant tips. But, even though this was my first time at JAPANESE CURRY ZEN, they already were treating me like I had spent over $1000 here. And of course, even though I only spent like $10.00 on curry I left a $20 tip. And the server earned every penny of that because it really was the best service I've had in years. 

JAPANESE ZEN CURRY is a small independent business, not a million dollar bankrolled J-restaurant. Even though there is a rumor that this place is owned by the Mon-group, the server told me that it's just not true. This is a small business that needs the support of the Japanese-American community here in Las Vegas. So, I encourage all LV Japanese residents to come try this place out and support them.

I'm in Las Vegas with my father for one night (don't ask, we're not getting married or any sick Red state shit like that) and I refuse to eat where we are staying because as much as I love me some free room service, I cannot handle when my only choice on the menu is a STEAMED VEGETABLE PLATTER.  that is right.  it is a platter of steamed vegetables and a scoop of white rice.  just typing that sentence makes me want to get sick all over this computer.  now, you might be thinking, "Laura, aren't you on Weight Watchers?" and to that I say, "Fuck you."  

So anyway, I decide we're going to be adventurous and take a trip off the strip to a mostly vegetarian restaurant that I've been to before called Long Life Vege.  It's about a ten minute cab ride away, it's cheap and they have delicious fake meat.  Delicious.  While my dad may hate fake meat product, there is nothing the man loves more than cheap (the dude likes to be told how much you spent on his birthday present and if it's under $10 he will be all, "HIGH FIVE!" Once, my sister got him a pair of toe nail clippers from Mac Frugal's (RIP) for 99 cents and the man shed a tear.  HE CRIED, HE WAS SO PROUD) so we were in a cab faster than you can say, "faux chicken chow mein."  Well, our cabbie was a delightful chap from Somalia who was very affable and talkative and when he asked why we were going to a vegetarian restaurant, my dad said, "Because this one's a VEGAN!  Hahaha!' and they laughed and laughed.  Good one, you guys!  It IS hilarious when someone is vegan!  HAR DEE FUCKING HAR HAR.

we pull up to Long Life Vege and the motherfucker is closed.  GODDAMMIT.  we ask our cabbie for restaurant recommendations and he suggests Merkato since it is nearby and he is a regular.  We get to Merkato and as we are getting out of the cab, both my dad and I realize that we forgot our wallets.  Well, actually, my dad forgot his wallet and I "forgot" mine, you dig?  I ain't paying when money bags is around!  I wrangle dogs for a living and my father gets hundred dollar bills poured on his head just for waking up.  Plus, there will be no social security left for me when i'm old and I gotta save NOW!  and by save NOW!, i mean buy that new ipod phone because it's SWEET!  do you think it comes in pink??

We take a cab back to the hotel, my dad get his wallet, takes out another $100 from the ATM and we drive back to Merkato.  The cab is $45 at this point so my dad gives the guy what he thinks is $70 because he has put up with our insanity for the evening.  You're saying to yourself, "Who gives a fuck, Laura?" And to that I say, "Wait for it. You will get a mild satisfaction at the end but it's probably still not worth reading the whole long ass review."

We walk into Merkato and are the only non-Ethiopian people in the place and it's crazy crowded.  Both VERY good signs for potential deliciousness.  I order the veggie combo (which was a very typical veggie combo: yellow lentils, red lentils, mustard greens, enjera salad, etc) and it was MAGNIFICENT.  One of the best i've had and I've had A LOT.  my dad got the dead lambert and said the flavor was fantastic but there was too much fat and gristle.  now, contrary to popular belief, i haven't always been vegan.  i used to eat meat and let me tell you, i liked the grossest meat.  tendons and gristle and marrow...i mean, i would CLEAN a chicken bone and then use a splinter to pick my teef.  i was a hardcore red neck of an obese 9 year-old until i figured out i was eating bambi.  ANYWAY, if you are currently like i was when i was 9 years-old, then get the lamb and when you're done, have your cholesterol checked because i'm pretty sure you're gonna drop dead at any moment.  

So, we finish our fantastic meal about 15 hours after we first walked in (that's how they roll in Ethiopia.  Slowly.  But friendly.  Like this review.) and as he's paying, my dad realizes that instead of the $30 tip he thought he left our lovable cabbie, he gave him $115 tip.  MY DAD'S BAD!  we also realized that we had no way back to the hotel. luckily when i asked our waitress to call us a cab, she was all, "hold on" and disappears.  two minutes later, a guy who was eating a few tables over has us in his cab, headed back to the hotel.  Major bonus.

In the end, we're dealing with:

Cab rides: $135.  
Dinner: $25 (for two HUGE plates plus two beers and tea)
Average Cost of Dinner for Two People in Las Vegas in Some Cheesy Rip Off Restaurant On The Strip: $200.  

So anyway, I think we still did good.  And there's a cab driver (Yasin!  Holla!) who is high rolling tonight.  Or, you know, sending money back to his family in his war torn country.  As my dad put it, his company is paying and screw those jerkwads, the better man (Yasin! Holla!) wins tonight!  I love my dad.  

I am finally done, you can rest your eyes.  Get up, stretch, do some squats, get the blood flowing...you've been here awhile.

I have been back several times before writing this review update just to make sure all the inconsistency that I have been experiencing is now the way of Bagel Cafe and not just an off day they were having. I'm prepared for the loyal fixtures to be upset, but if you really have been eating here since it opened then you know it's not the same. I first started eating here at Bagel Cafe (I was a teenager) after it opened. It was worth the long wait to get a table as the food was spot on excellent. Sure we all know the best breakfast in town is at the Omelet House on Charleston, but this place definitely came close behind at one point. In the last 6 months I have experienced meals here at Bagel Cafe that were just not worth the money or wait for what you got. They don't even use Boar's Head deli meats anymore! WTH?!?!?!? They use some brand I have never heard of. The taste and quality of the deli meat just isn't the same as it used to be. They claim the bagels are made fresh daily yet they are rock hard. I have never liked the bagels here, but if it's in your name.... live up to it!

As you can tell from my previous review and pictures, I really used to like this place. Consistency is a major issue. The sandwiches used to be made with Boar's Head deli meat and was piled high between the bread of your choice and a real winner. Now you get some other brand of meat just bunched up in a ball between 2 dry pieces of bread. I can do that at home! Then there is breakfast. I usually order breakfast here. The last 3 times the coffee has tasted bitter and nasty. Getting a refill was a major chore as well. I noticed the servers didn't have name tags on my last visit or I would give a proper shout-out to the waitress who has messed up my order lately and has terrible customer service. I ordered "One Egg any style W/Bacon" priced at $8.95 and asked for eggs to be scrambled with shredded cheddar cheese on top. Such a simple breakfast right? Apparently not For Bagel Cafe. The breakfast also came with a bagel of my choice and breakfast potatoes. When my food arrived I noticed there was a slice of cheddar cheese on my eggs. UGH! If you don't have shredded cheese just let the customer know so they can maybe make another choice. I would have had the egg over medium or easy to dunk my bacon in if I had known. The "Asiago" bagel I had was so tough and hard!  I was with another yelper one of my last visits and showed him how I was able to bang the bagel on the table and it just broke in pieces.  The bacon was terrible. From the picture it looks heavenly, but let me tell you it was rock hard and seemed like it was honestly pulled from the fridge or something. When my meal arrived the bacon was missing, so I informed our waitress and she replies to me "oh did you want bacon?" to which I'm like HELL YES why would I have ordered a breakfast that comes with it if I didn't want it? She then brings me the cold/hard bacon and when the receipt comes she charged me $3.50 for a side of bacon. Seriously? It was supposed to come with the breakfast I ordered. She made me feel like I had done something wrong when she actually is a very lousy waitress. The potatoes I had were the only thing edible on the plate and even those aren't the same potatoes as they have had in the past. With this place not being consistent and having waitresses who can't do their job right, I'm going to  BabyStacks Cafe and Omelet House from now on for breakfast and will make the drive to Henderson to eat at Weiss.

I had my hopes up for this place. Walking in it seemed like a fun atmosphere, but quickly it felt like more of a tourist attraction. From the start our server was trying to get us to buy raffle tickets. It didn't stop there. When she would check on us, she was saying things like "if you like the taste of that, we sell it in our gift shop" and at the end of the meal even asked if she could walk with us to the gift shop (we told her that we didn't want to go earlier and thanked her for the info) to pick somethings out so she could meet her goal since she was in the lead for some sort of competition with the other employees for work. To put people on the spot so many times is rude. Ask once and if the customer is interested they will tell you! 

What encouraged us to come here was because I have family here in town that is hosting an exchange student from Germany and I thought she would not only like this place, but maybe feel a bit of home. We sat at nice long table that is shared with the other customers. I don't personally like that, but that's the theme here so it was fine. There was live music being played which was cool. 

Priced at $19.99 we started out with the "Sausage Tower" at the suggestion of our server. She said it was a "hidden" menu item since it isn't on the menu and it would give us a good taste of the different sausages they have. Sounded good to me! When it arrived, it looked like a tower of heaven. There were 3 dishes. 1 dish had chicken bratwurst, pork sausage and veal bratwurst on a bed of sauerkraut. The 2nd dish had krainer, grilled weisswurst and a frankfurter with potato salad. The 3rd dish had 2 fresh baked pretzels with 2 types of dipping sauces. Of all the sausages I only really liked the taste of a couple of them, so it was nice to be able to sample it all instead of just ordering a certain sausage dish that I might have had a type of sausage in it that I wasn't to find of. The pretzels were pretty good and the mustard sauces had good flavor. For my meal I had priced at $4.95 a "House Salad" and priced at $14.95 the "Grillhendl" which is a chicken dish. The salad was average, but the chicken dish was above average. The chicken was roasted and stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions. The chicken was crispy and had a good flavor. It also came with a side of potato salad that was decent. 

I certainly didn't leave hungry! I didn't leave feeling like I would come back though either. The vibe inside just screamed "gimmick" and "tourist attraction here" which our guest from Germany agreed. The server was just too pushy about trying to get us to buy different things. My husbands meal was a joke especially for the price, so I lucked out with the chicken dish I ordered. I'm glad I experienced Hofbruhaus at least once.

As i rubbed my overstuffed belly, dude said it's ok if i want to unbutton. I told him i unbuttoned already about 30 min ago!

Wowee, i think i consumed more food here that i did at the buffets. 
I brought my relatives here to treat them to a nice steak dinner, without breaking the bank. 
For restaurant week, they were doing a great deal (which is pretty much half of their power couple meal). For $50, you get a 3 course meal. Most of our table ordered that, while my dude and uncle just got their manly bone in Rib Eyes. The deal came with a Petit Filet and crabcake, along with salad and dessert. But ur allowed to tweak your meal and don't necessarily have to stick with the written options- a few items, u have to pay extra for. 
You start off with huge sesame seed bread served with butter. Not the best bread steak house bread i've had, but it was soft and yummy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=0BlIFseV-5Hd16I-PcRrXQ 

My Del's salad was awesome!. Mainly cuz it came with two huge pieces of delicious thick but crisp bacon on top!!! I got mine with an avocado dressing which was so good! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=Gl37AEprIq227kFoigLohw

The petit Filet was pretty filling and cooked nicely med rare.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=fNMin5UVASwyyFBm_eMUlg
The bone in Rib Eye was good as well, dude loved it as he's had it before. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=HyA9h7GFL35u0YrUgi3uvg  It was good, but i felt it lacked that buttery char that i love on my rib eye. Mastros i say still does a better Bone In Rib eye. 

For sides, the staff comes around and spoons out the sides you ordered, which come in large portions that u could share them. 
I tried the spinach (creamy with bacon!), and mushrooms were ok. 
The baked potato looked good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=_fxRw3wX86gejNGyy2rAWg

The crabcakes were pretty good. 
My uncle got the Salmon and said that the Tchoupitoulas sauce it came with was delicious and light. 
My aunt got the seared tuna steak- which was good but not great. She enjoyed the crab cake more. 

We all let out some gasps when we saw the humongous desserts!
We were too stuffed but couldn't resist the yummy looking desserts. 
The bread pudding was the best-  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=J4y4JWu2Kzjwv4Q_Ein0cQ
Strawberry cheesecake was huge and very cream cheesy than sweet 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=NiuW7t29bUx5BSZYH-8DKw
Chocolate mousse was delicious. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=PU3xnSpdx9YjuOQpNiNikQ
One dessert, i think is big enough to share between 3 people, esp after having a huge dinner already. 

Service was outstanding. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and took his time explaining everything and made us all feel very comfortable. We saw atleast 10 different wait staff come to our table, either refilling our drinks (even after one sip!) or bringing out our dishes. 

I signed up for their rewards card which racks you up points for dollars spent for gift cards. They charge u an initial fee of $25.00 which they reinburse you in the form of a giftcard for later. You can also sign up online before going there, so you can use it on your first visit. Be sure to let them know of any b-days, as u will get a comped dessert!

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Boy do we love our HHs down here in the SW!  Gone are the images of older septuagenerian and octogenarian hovering over a buffet line. In fact most HHs seem to have nice mixture of all ages, including those just getting off from work, unwinding before the start of the weekend. For us, it was just hitting the Yard House before the start of a movie at nearby Camelview Five. 

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
Yard House is sort of a hip sports bar, with some really good food and lots of HDTVs. Don't be put off that the corporate parent is Darden, the same folk who own Olive Garden and Red Lobster. You'll need to remember, they also own The Capital Grille, Longhorn, Eddie V's, so they know how to make a fun and tasty experience. 

The restaurant is located in the breeze way, near the two entrances of the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall and the valet parking area.  We sat outside in the patio area on this visit, even though it was in the low 80s. No one was rushing to get inside.  Did I mention we were sitting in the breezeway? LOL

MENU:
Unlike some, there are no special HH menu items offered by Yard House. Their HH prices are 50% off all appetizers and pizzas. These are actually the same size appetizers you would normally receive after 6 pm, so we were impressed. If you look at the photos, you'll see some really nice, mouth watering dishes. 

When you are seated, you are given a huge menu that includes also everything you ever could imagine.  The steaks and burgers are really good and everything is reasonably priced. http://www.yardhouse.com/files/food_menu_20.pdf 

The star at Yard House though is their nearly one hundred beers on tap. There are Heffes, Lagers, Pale Ales, Wheats, dark beers and so much more. If you like beer, this is your place. Nice!

SERVICE:
Our server Jon was excellent. He was also teamed with an equally good supporting cast that all worked well together. Granted Yard House was half full, but everyone was on top of their game.  It was something we appreciated as we looked at our watch, thinking about the movie next door. 

FOOD:
On this visit we ordered the Chicken Nachos (photo) that normally goes for $11.45 and their yummy Margherita Pizza, which comes with roasted garlic on it for $11.65. Both were outstanding and made us wish we could come back later for some more. 

On that topic, Yard House has what I call reverse HH with a special menu from 10 pm to close. On it you'll find such nom nom items as Black Truffle Cheeseburgers, Chilaquiles, Pastrami Dogs and something they call Monte Cristo Pops. Gosh do I enjoy truffle oil on things!  LOL

Yard House's food selection is almost as large as their beer selection.  I would guess you would need at least a dozen or so visits to try everything and I haven't even gotten to their Snacks menu. 

PRICES:
As noted, Happy Hour is 50% off all appetizers and pizza. Our bill came in around $23 including taxes but before gratuities. Jon was great, so we were very generous. 

So Four Stars and "yes, we're a Fan." 

Enjoy!

===================


Let me first start this review by saying the following: Even though I'm a CenPho fan, I have spent many evenings in North Scottsdale establishments including Barcelona, Ocean Club, and Devil's Martini North with and without bottle service and reserved tables. So don't think this is a harsh review due to their location. 

I was at Narcisse last night with a group of 6 at a reserved booth. Things went smoothly enough in seating us. I was immediately impressed by the decor of the place and excited to try their menu. My friend and I pored over the extensive bubbly list and the food menu quickly. My friend suggested that we get the chef's choice meats, cheeses platter. After a few questions, we went ahead with the platter and a bottle of sparkling rose'. Everything was great! The platter was large enough for everyone at the table to try something. 

As the food part of the evening was wrapping up for our group, we decided to mix and mingle. The crowd made for some great people watching! I was enjoying the show! The music was good and upbeat and created a great vibe. My tootsies were hurting a bit so we decided to head back to the booth to chill for a bit. This is when it gets silly. 

I was sitting in the booth with 3 other people and we were watching a bouncer and I assume a manager trying to arrange and rearrange a table and chairs right in front of our booth. I sat back in amusement at first as the Benny Hill theme song played in my head. I was thinking to myself "This table is blocking booth traffic." Well, the two employees decided to move the table a little further away from the booths and into the traffic that walks into the establishment; a very high traffic area. I shook my head and thought the show was over. No. A hostess with a clipboard comes over and says "Hi guys. I have had these booths reserved for, like, two weeks in advance and need to move you to that table. I'll give you a bottle of champagne for your inconvenience." I didn't object. I didn't say anything. I just got up and moved. Well, our booth was a booth for 6, the table was a booth for 4. So as we were trying to arrange for more chairs, if possible, I watched a server run into our makeshift table setting, look annoyed, then climb OVER two of the empty chairs at our table. Then I see another patron walk into the establishment, and slam right into one of the other chairs on the other side of the table. A bouncer comes over to tell us that we can't move tables before being told by another bouncer that we were ok. This table IS NOT supposed to be here. I felt like we were in the way and we were. On top of that, I'm watching as another makeshift "reserved" table is being arranged in the already cramped area. I had enough. I told my friend that I wanted to leave and started saying my goodbyes. 

My friend had been a bar manager for a large establishment for many years, so he went to speak to the Manager to inform him of the tomfoolery with the tables. I walked up in the middle of the conversation and the Manager was asking us to stay and was apologizing profusely. I told him I respected the business and understood that things were crazy, but booting people out of a booth and putting them at a table that blocked the flow of traffic was hazardous and not professional at all. I also explained that we were paying customers that had bought approx 5 bottles of champagne and food, so we weren't schlumps. The Manager thanked me for my understanding and wanted to let me know that "after 10 or so, the place becomes more of a nightclub, so tables are tough and we're trying to accommodate everyone who wants a reserved table". Ok then they should pull all the tables then and not call themselves a Lounge. Or they should LIMIT the number of tables they reserve. He again asked us to stay and he'd get more chairs over and buy us a drink. I told him that the chairs weren't necessary (where the heck were they going to put them??) and that we would stay for the drink. He insisted on trying to move more chairs over, which caused more of a jam. We insisted that the chairs weren't needed and he took them away. Our drinks? Ordered but never delivered after 35 minutes. I just stood by observing and saw another server run into a chair at our table and pick it up and move it to another part of the place. I just laughed and told my friend we were outta there. 

At what point is it a good business decision to sacrifice quality for quantity? Do you try to accommodate everyone who wants a table or limit the number and keep the service integrity high? Do you accommodate paying customers who are willing to continue drinking and eating or bump them for a table who bought one bottle of alcohol? 

I think Narcisse has potential. It's not quite there yet. I guess I just expect more out of a bubble lounge. All the pieces are there! Maybe I will go back after they work out the kinks.

Wow. Just wow. I am amazed at how much Morton's has changed. I hadn't eaten at Morton's for years, so seeing it was apart of Restaurant Week 2013 it seemed like a good time to go back. Too bad we couldn't go back in time to when I remember Morton's being an excellent place to eat!. 

I made the reservation a few days before, but after arriving I don't think that reservation would have mattered because they were not busy at all and the bar was dead. They did have a menu board after you walk inside promoting Restaurant Week and the RW menu they were offering. After being seated in a comfy booth, a gentleman came over to take our drink order and inform us that he was glad we were seated away from the construction dust. Say what?!?! He said they were doing some remodeling and we got lucky seats. Gee thanks... Not! I wasn't prepared to start off the evening hearing about that and feel he should have kept it to himself. Some things you just don't relay back to the customers.

Our server, Jessie, was attentive checking on us often and never letting our drinks get half empty. Jessie went over the RW menu with us and answered any questions we had. A large "Onion Loaf" was brought to the table with some whipped butter. This is a big loaf! I thought it was good, but seriously it tasted like the onion bun on the beef n cheddar at Arby's. For the RW menu the price was $50.13 per person. For the first course I chose the "Chopped Salad" and I have to say this was the one thing I really enjoyed. The chunks of blue cheese were amazing! I loved having such good sized chunks of blue cheese throughout the salad. The extra fresh cracked pepper I requested was nice too. For the 2nd course, I chose the 8oz filet well-done. Yep, I ordered a steak well-done! Get over it, it's MY steak! The filet is a thicker cut of meat, so when cooked properly it can still melt in your mouth even well-done! This was the first time in my entire life that I have ordered a well-done filet that didn't need to be butterflied. The steak lacked flavor and certainly didn't melt in my mouth. Even the crispy parts lacked flavor! I don't know if Morton's is being cheap with the RW menu, or if they really have gone downhill, but this steak isn't anything close to what I have had here in the past. 

You can clearly see by the RW pictures posted and other pictures posted that Morton's slims down the portion size on some dishes when you order from RW menu. Tsk Tsk! The sides hubby and I chose (came with the 2nd course) were the "Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes" and "Lyonnaise Potatoes" since we weren't fond of the other options. The mashed potatoes were creamy yet had soft chunks of potato in it too. I thought the mashed potatoes were actually decent. The lyonnaise potatoes on the other hand were terrible. The pictures of previous yelpers lyonnaise potatoes looks different from what we got. First off the onions were chewy and nasty. Eating the onions was like chewing on grass. Gross! The potatoes were straight up french fries! This dish was a fail.

So it came time for dessert and I knew I wanted the "Key Lime Pie" I just didn't know it would also be a fail. Key lime pie is one of my favorites (had the worst before this occasion in Florida believe it or not!) and I didn't think Morton's would be the worst ever key lime pie I have eaten. As it was placed in front of me, I could smell some fresh lime and grew excited. Pffft the only thing "lime" about this pie was the few lime zests they scattered on top. That was the smell, just some lime zest. This pie had no tartness at all! It was just bland and like eating nothing. I did not finish it since it bored and disappointed me. 

I started eating at The Mint, or today known as top of Binions, Hugo's Cellar, etc. at a very young age. My parents taught us how to have manners and how privileged it was for someone of our age to be eating in a place like that. To this day we still eat at those places and have the same exact manners. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way rules changed because there were 2 others tables seated near us about half way through our meal. At one table there was a guy wearing light colored jeans and a baseball cap. At the other there was a boy, maybe 6 or 7, making loud sounds, running around the table in circles waving his arms in the air, and the father laughing and encouraging it. I remember when if your jeans weren't dark enough you weren't allowed to dine. A baseball cap is just disrespectful, and the kid running around with no control isn't just the parents fault, but Morton's too. Like I mentioned earlier, the place wasn't very busy and this kid and his noises were obvious enough that someone at Morton's should have said something. They would have when I was younger so what has changed now? I am not paying a good chunk of change to have that going on around me. Because of yelps character limit, Morton's should be glad I can't comment any further! :)

LOSING!!!

This is not my favorite hotel on the strip. Is it full of history with old rooms that smell? Yes that is the smell of History. Come on Sinatra has a suite here. I am sure there are things in this hotel we do not want to know anything about, so sometimes it is better to just hold your nose & deal with it.

I have only stayed at this hotel because of work. I would never personally pick this place ever.

When I check-in, I asked for a Humidifier and I was promptly told, "the Riv does not have any". I informed the check-in agent that I stay in Vegas 3 times a year & every hotel has humidifiers. She promptly told me I was wrong & she questioned what hotels I stayed at last. I informed her and she said, "That is hard to believe because one of the hotels I mentioned was a sister property and they do not have humidifiers!" I looked at her and said, "I am sorry because they gave me one for a week!"  So frustrating! Why are you arguing with me?

Two days went by and I was about to go to Walgreens to purchase a Humidifier. I decided to call Housekeeping and just ask. The Manager in Housekeeping said, "I wish you would have called two days ago because I think I am out of them!" I was so mad that I actually listened to the front desk. I should have just called two days ago. The Manager was so sweet because I asked her to call me back within the hour because if I did not hear from her I would go and buy one. Five minutes later there was a knock at my door and I was handed a humidifier.  That was 5 star service but the front desk not knowing or even making an attempt to get me a humidifier was 0 stars.

My dry cleaning was suppose to be in my room by 7pm the night before. As I was getting ready in the morning I noticed my dry cleaning was not there. I tried several times to call the Bell Hop, to inquiry about my dress shirt but no one ever picked up the phone. So I decided to pick up my shirt myself & went down on my way to work. I informed the Bell Hop my shirt was never delivered. He then looked at me and said, "Did you look in the closet?" I honestly wanted to biff myself in the head and say, "I wish I had a V8!" I looked at him and said, "Really?" He then went to look for my shirt but made sure to tell me that he probably did not have it. Guess what? He had my shirt. Then he had the rudeness to say, "I am going to need to see your ID!" I looked at him and said, "What are the chances that I gave you my last name, my room number, color of shirt and that it wasn't delivered to my room and it isn't my dress shirt???" He said, "Well I have to be sure!" I said, "Just be sure you are making me late for work and I now have to get dressed in the Lobby bathroom now!" Honestly what is the deal with these guys! Are people stealing dry cleaning in hotels?

I also had to leave notes around my room to inform the maid not to touch my stuff. Please do not move my toothbrush and various bathroom stuff. Is it really necessary?  The kicker was the day I walked in and my room was not made and it was 7pm at night. I called the manager and he said, "I see your room has been marked off as cleaned!" I told him to come on up or I could email him photos. He asked if he could send up the maid now and I said, "No! I am in my room & I am good!" Five minutes later there was a knock on my door from the maid who insisted to come in and clean my room. I had to tell her that I was good & did not want my room cleaned. It was more principal. Don't check my room off as clean and then not clean it.

The kicker is this. I decided to go green & check-out from my television. It then asked me to find the keyboard in the room to type in my email to send me out a final bill. I then opened every drawer in my room to find the keyboard. I then called down to the front desk and was informed that none of the rooms have keyboards. Really? Why tell me to check out from the room & I can not get a bill emailed to me. The front desk manger promised me to email me my final bill. It has been 7 days since I have checked out I have not gotten my final bill. I called after 24 hours and had them email me again. No email. I have in fact called 5 times & I have them send out emails to two different email addresses. Guess what? No email. 

I also had food here once too. I had one of the pre-packed salads from the coffee shop. I opened my salad only to find wilting lettuce in the container. So gross! That was the first & last time that I ate at the hotel. If you stay here you are going to be taking cabs down the street or walking to get to any decent restaurants. There is nothing to do at this end of the strip!

I am hating this review right now because I am taking a big deep breath & reliving this lack of customer service at the Riv! This hotel is not a Five Star Hotel. My room was suppose to be non-smoking but it still smelled like smoke. I guess after 58 years you will never be able to get the smoke of the walls!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 58/100

Dining at Gordon Ramsay Steak was what I was most looking forward to on my most recent trip to Las Vegas. Fortunately, Chef Ramsay did not disappoint! Post-vacation, I still believe that our date night at Gordon Ramsay Steak was my favorite part of our weekend getaway!

GR Steak is located inside the Paris Hotel, right in the middle of the casino at the front of the hotel. The seating hostesses/kiosk are actually right outside of the restaurant, and I don't think they let you in unless you have a reservation or they're ready to take you inside.

We had made a reservation several months in advance, although I don't think you need to wait THAT long to reserve ahead of time. When you first enter, you are in a cylindrical tunnel that serves as the restaurant bar. Apparently it is supposed to represent the London Tube, and represents you traveling from Paris (the hotel) into England, GR's homeland.

While waiting for our table to be setup, they had seated us at the bar. After about a 5-10 minute wait, we were finally seated at our table, kind of off to the side near the kitchen/bathrooms.

I was kind of surprised at how busy/noisy it was in the restaurant. I knew it would be popular with GR's name tacked onto it, but it was a lot bigger and noisier than I had expected. Not a super intimate, romantic date nice restaurant. More trendy and lively.

Service was EXCELLENT at GR Steak! Our waiter, Freddy, was awesome. He came out and introduced himself, and then provided us with an iPad 2 that had the entire drink menu on it. It was really awesome because it showed photos of each mixed drink, the list of ingredients, etc. Then it had the beer and wine list as well. The last tab consisted of a photo and biography of Gordon Ramsay.

They also had a tasting menu, complete with autographed keepsake photo of Gordon Ramsay, but it looked pretty heavy and was also very expensive so we opted out of it. Freddy wheeled around a cart to our table and explained all of the different cuts of meat. Very informative and I loved the visual display. Freddy's speech was a bit scripted, but he said it with a smile and was very polite and well-mannered, which I really enjoyed! The guy who brought out our food/bussed our table was also super friendly and very courteous! Excellent service as well.

What we ordered:

--BREAD--
Ok, I had to mention this because they give you four types of bread with this butter that supposedly has volcanic salt on it, and omg, this is probably some of the best bread and butter I've ever had at a restaurant. All 4 types were incredible and I felt like I almost got full just from the bread! AND when the guy packed our to-go boxes, he packed us a fresh batch of new bread and butter! SO AWESOME!

--DRINKS--
PIMMS CUP: 
Wasn't a huge fan. I was interested because it had Pimms lemonade but it didn't taste that great. Also I felt like it had too much stuff added into it, like different slices of fruit and mint leaves.

WYDERS PEAR CIDER:
The description literally said it would give a pleasant ticklish kick. Definitely did!

--STEAKS--
BEEF WELLINGTON:
So, I basically felt obligated to order this because I knew Beef Wellington is Chef Ramsay's signature dish. I've never had Beef Wellington before so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I really loved the flakiness of the crust, and it blew my mind how it wasn't soggy at all! The meat was soft and delicious. I could also taste the lining of foie gras and that was pretty interesting. I didn't LOVE the foie gras but I thought it was good.

KOBE FILET MIGNON:
My boyfriend decided to YOLO and go with the Kobe filet mignon. Pricey, but totally worth it! I had a piece and omg, that was some melt in your mouth steak! He could not get over how good it was and said it was the best steak he's ever had. Excellent!

--SIDE DISH--
TRUFFLE MAC N CHEESE:
I LOVE me some truffles AND mac n cheese, so this was a winner! Super ooey gooey and cheesy, just the way I like it!

--DESSERT--
STICKY TOFFEE BREAD PUDDING WITH BROWN BUTTER ICE CREAM: OMG, this was SO FREAKING GOOD! I was really sad that I didn't finish mine because I was already so full...but seriously, I was in love with this dessert. I would go back JUST for the dessert. Interestingly enough, I thought that the ice cream was much sweeter than the sticky toffee pudding. They complimented each other very well and it was great! Highly recommend!

Overall I think my boyfriend spent around $250. TOTALLY WORTH IT! I would come back again for sure! :) Great job, Chef Ramsay and staff!

I noticed ZiKiZ while in the area a couple months ago and decided to bookmark it based on the positive reviews and the food sounded good. I met yelper Tracy P here for lunch and walking in we were greeted right away. The 2 men behind the counter were very friendly and told us about their menu. They said they specialized in customizing any order with what's offered on the menu. You pick if you want a wrap, salad or bowl (prices vary) and then pick what you want inside. They have chicken, steak, crab and falafel and a variety of veggies. 

Priced at $7.99 I ordered a "Chicken Wrap" with salad mix, red onion, black olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, ZiKiZ sauce and feta cheese (.50 cents extra for feta) inside a sundried tomato tortilla. I said that I would be eating the wrap inside, but would like the chicken on the side to-go. The guy looked at me kind of funny and said I needed to pick a protein to go into my meal. I looked funny back at him because he just told me a minute prior that they specialized in customizing any order, so what was the big deal with just putting the chicken on the side? I like the Greek Salad Wrap over at The Great Greek on Warm Springs and was hoping to create a wrap somewhat like that. I just said the chicken inside the wrap would be fine. My friend, Tracy had a coupon for $5 off any order over $20 which was a nice bonus. The guy accepted the coupon with no problem, but he majorly messed up when it came to ringing up our order. We wanted to add 2 sides and 2 drinks for an additional $2.99 each. He never asked us what sides we wanted and when we were looking over the menu deciding which ones we wanted, he says "oh I thought you'd want fries" and I was wondering why he was picking for us. I said no, we never asked for fries and don't want those, but we'd like to try the ZiKiZ rice. He then brought only 1 side of rice over and not the 2nd. Then he starts to talk to the next customer and we haven't even received our drink cups. I ask for them and he only hands 1 cup over. What the heck? We mentioned that we needed the other drink (deciding to just give up on the 2nd side we never received) and he just smiles and hands a cup over. I wasn't given a receipt, so I don't know how he charged me. I am thinking he didn't ring up the 2nd drink and side or something, but with the coupon our total was only $15 and some change, so not a bad price to try a new place out.   He did give the coupon back and said to save it to use again.

The rice was very bland. I really tasted no flavor and decided since it was in a container already to just take it home and give it to my dog with her dinner. The wrap was just average. I did like the taste of the tortilla, but the chicken really had no flavor and the veggies stood out more as far as flavor goes. With them not customizing my order the way I wanted, the food only tasting average, the mix up with sides and drinks and the food not being that great, I can't see coming back.

I bought a yelp deal ($10 for $20) a few months back for this place not knowing they weren't open yet. Kind of frustrating that they would post the deal and not even be open, but it did say at the bottom of the yelp listing it was "coming soon" so I will take the blame. Their Facebook page said they would be opening the following month, but that never happened. I reached out to Caf Casera by e-mail to see if they had any updates on when they would be opening. The owner responded promptly and said they were working out some last minute things and should be open soon and they would let me know when they opened. The owners word was kept, I received a e-mail letting me know they were opening and ready for customers. It took me a couple weeks after receiving the e-mail to make my way over, but with as long as I waited already what was a couple more weeks? 

Walking in hubby and I were greeted and given menus right away. originally, we planned to eat inside the restaurant, but the fountain machine wasn't set up yet and they only had cans of soda ($1) and bottled water ($1.25) so we decided to order our food to-go and get drinks from a gas station. What a bummer because they had Cherry Coke! I spoke with one of the owners, Julie who said they were waiting for the "Coke man" to come hook it up. I had a wonderful conversation with Julie who also introduced me to her husband and mother-in-law. I could tell while talking to Julie, just how genuinely passionate her and her family are about the food they are serving. She told me how they are there at 5 am each morning making everything from scratch including the corn and flour tortillas that are all personally made by her mother-in-law. 

Some of the menu items here will be something you have seen before at other restaurants, but I promise you Caf Casera puts there own twist on each dish and I personally haven't ever tasted anything like it. I have never heard of "Sizzle" which is the specialty here, so I obviously had to try it! 

Sizzle Tacos ($7.95) - Seasoned ground pork and beef, onions, cabbage and cheese sauce inside 2 crunchy taco shells. The taco shells tasted amazing! They had such a fresh flavor and weren't greasy at all. The stuff inside the shell is an acquired taste for sure. I thought it was alright, but can't say I would order it again. Hubby took a bite and thought it was the best thing out of everything we ordered and he ended up switching me his Bean & Cheese Burrito for it. The burrito was so good! The flour tortillas here aren't your average flour tortilla, they are a bit thicker. The beans and rice were great. The beans are thick and the rice has a nice flavor, nothing dry or mushy about it.

Cheese Quesadilla ($2.25) - The menu says it is grilled with Colby cheese inside, but honestly it tasted more like Velveeta cheese. The cheese was very pasty. The tortilla was kind of burnt on the outside too. After two bites I was done, I just didn't like it. 

Sopaipilla ($2.75) - Yes! This was great. I have had different versions, but not one like this before. They put cinnamon and powdered sugar on it and it can easily be shared. It does have a sweet flavor, so if sweet things aren't your style you can try one plain. I enjoyed the sweet flavor and would order it again. 

As I sat there waiting for my food to be prepared, I noticed the menu boasted that the dishes were prepared with a "New Mexico Flair" so if you want green chile they can add it for 75 cents. It confused me because if the dish is prepared with New Mexico Flair, wouldn't it already have the green stuff in it? Julie was kind enough, because I forgot to order the chile on my tacos, to give me 2 free sides of it. This was awesome green stuff indeed! Hubby was just eating it with a fork, cold and all. I do wish the chile came warm and was already included with the food, since the food is prepared when you order it, a customer could just say they don't want it on there. Oh well they were gooooood!

The inside was very clean and the decor was nice. There are about 4 tables inside if you don't want to take your food to-go. Caf Casera also offers breakfast burritos on their menu. Purchase a yelp deal and give this family run business a try! 

Mon - Sat .... 7 am until 10 pm

Michelin Stars #38-39

Oh Vegas, such a perfect town for indulgence and gluttony. Guy Savoy (not pronounced how you'd think) was chosen as a nice special dinner for my wife and myself, for no reason other than to live it up. 

Being an old married couple and knowing dinner could be 3+ hours, we took the earliest reservation at 6pm. The space was grand and empty upon arrival and we were seated with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains to the south. The mostly white decor was only interrupted but the occasional ultra-bright piece of "art," all of which I loved. After a quick glance at the menu, the only option worth considering was the full Innovation menu with a shared wine pairing. And now on to the show!

1. Foie and Toast Amuse: 
What's not to love about foie anything, truffles, and some crisp bread to add some texture. A perfect way to say hello while having your ear licked with taste.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#q-5nZctMRztBoHuzI-9IiA

2. Waffle and Parmesan Amuse: 
Kind of a weird one but god damn if that wasn't one of the best bites of waffle I've ever had. Another wow bite. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#k-HfOiDwUHjQDk2yS_A-Ug

3. The Bread Cart: 
Dude, they make this every single morning. I guess it's less impressive when you consider the small army of people in the bowels of these hotels that are there 24/7 doing everything. But somewhere down there is someone making over a dozen different types of artisanal bread just for Guy Savoy. We tried over half the selection over the course of dinner and they were all amazing and better.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#CeIpoN0mqYabwMCCuRhM2A

4. Tomato Amuse:
And the "ooos" and "aaahhs" just kept coming from us with this one. They must have made five or six different types of intricate tomato preparations just to combine into something that took two bites. Every area of tomato flavor was highlighted, from the sweet to the vinegar, and it was masterfully finished with a nibble of a tomato chip.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#kgqj-Czz4DtXuRe4HMI7wg

5. "Concass" of Oysters:
Concasse is the French culinary word for crushed or ground up. Here it was a dish of oyster pieces topped with seaweed and an amazing lemon granite. Bite after bite was amazing, we couldn't get over how perfectly well the chopped oysters worked with the crunchy lemon ice. It was everything you could ever want from an oyster dish. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#gVFhIUDM1qU2dkxH3XxtsA

6. Langoustine in Cold Steam:
At this point we were sure they couldn't keep up with this level of amazing food, but they did and did so with one of the more over the top presentations I've seen;

Click play - http://instagram.com/p/dsw_tpTRCa/

Basically what you have here are two preparations of langoustine on a perforated plate, over a bowl of dry ice, that then has a nori broth poured into it creating the "steam" effect. What it really did do was to add a lovely and visible aroma to the place of amazingly delicate langoustine sashimi. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#HVKWHN7wRaciqzmZzUiHFw

7.  Asparagus, Caviar and "Fresh" Cheese:
The title of the dish pretty much gives it away. Though again, the presentation was beautiful, the flavors all wowed, and the cheese foam was closer to a meringue in texture. But hot damn, that was some damn fine caviar. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#5ubR8rXxh6w0WRwNHKzo2Q

8. Salmon Iceberg:
This is the first time I've ever had a chef "cook" something tableside on a block of dry ice;

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#71j9M9W4E8w5KRyMX73O9w

Served by head chef Mathieu Chartron, he graciously rattled off the thinking behind this unique preparation as he plated our ice cold salmon and proceeded to top it off with a very hot broth. The resulting hot/cold mixture was divine. Hard to say for certain if the dry ice treatment really did much, but it was very fun and ended in more oooos and aaahhs from us. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/guy-savoy-las-vegas-2#wGN_mNDWyRB53ISlRUzaqg

9. Lobster:
I really need the before pic to show how this one played out. Basically a nice piece of lobster was presented with a few cylinder shaped veggies on the parameter. Then the servers went on to unwarp each of the veggie rolls and layer them atop the lobster, then topped it all with a wonderful smoked butter sabayon sauce. The result wasn't as pretty as the start, but the flavor combination worked its magic once again on us.

* Since there's no ONLINE MENU - I took pictures for ya'll! Look in the photo gallery. * 

The namesake carries some heavy expectations and also prejudices for a TV personality, but this place really has done justice even on just their 2nd day of being opened. I was excited for this as a few days prior I walked by and they were having a meeting. I stood there listening in and looking through the curtain like a total creeper.  I was worried there might be a wait, being a famous name, and brand new. I did try to call, but had a hard time getting to them and decided to come chance it anyways. It was busy, but there was no wait to be seated when we came at 5ish.

The menu is a cheeky paper menu that they encourage you to take as a souvenir, if you wish. With us being a bit of fans, yes, I took mine home. *blush*. Some people might be confused with the two different pricing but the orange is for Total Rewards members of PH Hotel&Casino so before dining, go get a card for a savings of $1 off per each item you order. 

The Farm Burger - this was a rather good burger if you like something to showcase natural flavors than big zesty spicy accompaniments. You can tell the meat quality is top notch and the flavor on it is fantastic. We did order a medium rare but it was more on the medium side, just a small oversight. The duck bacon was a curiousity, but basically just like bacon, just less fatty than pork. The brioche bun was so lovely soft and had a perfect flavor and toast to the inside. The egg is always a good flavor with beef. It needed a tad something to tie it all together so put some of the chipotle or curry ketchup on it! It isn't a huge burger, but trust we were full splitting all our items and I can tuck in and eat. 

Fresh roasted chili dawg - so the beef "devil dawgs" are cooked in a hellfire hot sauce and then grilled. I would rarely say a hot dog is gourmet or worth paying for, but this was seriously good. Fuck Pinks next door (its not like the one in LA anyways), and get this instead! I love the crispy texas toast like hot dog bun it was on and the dog was snappy, and super juicy and does taste of hotsauce it was cooked in! The toppings of the jalapeno, roasted fresno peppers, avocado, onion, cheddar and chipotle mayo were perfect with it. 

Just Fries - these were lovely skin on fries. I read in a press junket they use a specific more fluffy potato and do the 3 step fry method. These were crisp yet fluffy, not thick but not thin either and for me that's the ideal fry. The chipotle and curry ketchups were both very good, I didn't have a favorite. I just alternated every other fry.  

Shake # 5 - they split ours up for us which was a nice move on their service. This was rich and so good. I love the texture and flavor contrast between the shake and the swirl of pudding they put. This one was chocolate hazelnut pudding with coffee shake and a awesome praline cookie thin. It didn't taste too much like hazelnuts though, but more like chocolate caramel pudding but still good. It was good to split, it would have been too much for me to do one whole. 

Service was super friendly, personable and attentive. Much more cohesive than I would expect of a newbie restaurant. They asked how we heard of them, hows our day going, explained the menu, etc as we sat down and browsed. Our drinks were filled without ever asking and we were checked on a few times to see how we are doing. Their uniforms here are something else. Ladies are very form fitting and short so there's a eyecandy element to this place. After ordering our food did take a while to get to us so we sat around for a bit. Still, I would rather have it cooked right than rushed to where standards are lowered. 

Very satisfied with this meal and will be returning absolutely! Of course on principle I do reserve 5 stars for consistency upon return visits, but this is a highly recommended 4 stars. Definitely one of the better burgers I've had in this city and I don't trek onto the strip for bollocks either.

Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas, Carlo's Bakery! I ate at Buddy V's a couple weeks ago and one of the managers stopped at our table to check on us. After letting him know I was a "Cake Boss" fan, he let me know when the bakery would be opening and that contestants from "Next Great Baker" would be there. I obviously cleared my schedule for opening day! Carlo's Bakery (located inside The Venetian) is literally right across from Buddy V's and the pathway between them is a little more narrow than usual, so I wondered about how they were going to tame the long lines because there was no way there wouldn't be one.  

The grand opening was at 6 pm, so I wanted to get there early hoping to beat some of the crowd. I had my hubby and 2 nieces with me and we arrived to Carlo's Bakery around 5 pm to find a long line formed already. Venetian security had a field day with this one! We found our place at the end of the line and even though there were a lot of people in front of us, the line only grew l-o-n-g-e-r behind us. I was thankful for the spot we had after seeing just how long the line got! I appreciated that we were given samples from Carlo's employees while we waited. So let me talk about the wait. WOW! It was almost a 4 hour wait from the time we first got in line and actually got inside the bakery. I know that is a long time, but it wasn't so bad with all the activity going on around us. Between the free samples and seeing people from Next Great Baker and Cake Boss go by and stop to talk to us and take pictures, it didn't feel like 4 hours and honestly was a freaking blast! Hubby was a real trooper holding our spot in line while we would take off to get our picture with Buddy, Grace, Danny, Mary and people from NGB. 

Poor Buddy! He really didn't have the proper help keeping people back (like I said the pathway is a little more narrow than usual) and at one point they did have a line to meet him, but they had to stop it because so many people were crowding around and there wasn't a clear path for the people walking by who had no idea what Carlo's Bakery even was lol. At one point, Buddy came back for pictures and my nieces and I were able to get a picture. After the picture, Buddy gave one of my nieces a great big hug and a kiss on her forehead. She was SO excited smiling bright and cried a little saying "I'm never washing my face again" ...bless her precious young heart! They both had a blast and it's one experience they will never forget, myself included!

One inside the bakery, we were greeted and the girl who helped us was very friendly and helpful. it was kind of crazy inside the bake shop with people, so I just randomly picked out different things I could see. Ordering was quick, but getting what I ordered took a bit. While we waited (maybe 10 minutes) the sweet smell inside was heaven and I liked the open windows showing the bakers working. They have these windows not just inside the bakery, but outside too. When my name was called I went up to pay for my order and saw everything was packaged nicely. This was a great experience and I will most definitely be back!

Lobster Tails ($5.95) - Excellent! Try this! It's flaky with a cream inside and a little Bailey's Irish Cream. This was my favorite of what I tried. 

Eclair ($2.50) - This was cut if half and had a filling. It also had chocolate on top. This was pretty good. I thought at first site that it didn't have enough chocolate on it, but the chocolate was thick and the right amount.

Cream Puff ($2.50) - Custard filled with powdered sugar on top. I took a bite and thought it was good, so I told hubby to try it and he finished it. Glad I at least got a bite!

Chocolate Cannoli ($3/Mini) - This I figured I would like, but I ended up loving it! The amount of filling was decent. I'd order this one again.

Cannoli ($2.50/mini) - The filling has a ricotta cream with chocolate chips. I did like this one a lot and would eat it again, but I personally preferred the chocolate cannoli.

Strawberry Tart ($2.85) - This was my least favorite. If you do try this, I would recommend eating it soon. When I got home with my box, the strawberry tart looked like it melted a bit and the strawberry slid off. None of that really bothered me because I hadn't had it before and didn't know it wasn't something that didn't travel well. The way it tasted did bother me though, The bottom was rock hard and I had trouble even biting into it. I might try it again in the future, but am in no rush.

Chocolate Fudge Cupcake ($3.50) - I had the option between a vanilla or chocolate cupcake and chose the chocolate. It had a chocolate fudge frosting with sprinkles on top. This was just average. Not bad, but not great.

Carrot Cupcake ($3.50) - Of the 2 cupcakes I tried, this was the best. The cupcake was moist and the cream cheese frosting was very good. 

They also have merchandise for sale (mugs, cookbooks, etc.) and take special orders for cakes and other goodies.

Amlee Chinese Cuisine is a local family run business. They have been in business for over 30 years. I remember eating here when I was a teenager and really enjoying the food and lunch specials at Amlee Chinese Cuisine. After going to the movies at nearby Galaxy last week we passed by here so, I suggested to hubby that we come back and try this place and see if it was still as good as I remembered. With a fellow yelper in tow we headed for dinner here last night and wasn't disappointed. 4.5 stars!

Walking in we were greeted and taken to our seats. Water and menus were brought right to our table right away. We shared "family style" and picked out somethings we all like. Food is brought out on a cart and served to you. 

Fried Wontons ($5.95) - These came 12 per order and I liked them. Light, yet crunchy with a small bit of chicken in the center. It came with a sweet and sour and spicy mustard dipping sauces. 

Szechuan Chicken Salad ($10.95) - Yum! The salad was tossed in front of us. The portion was huge and there was plenty to go around. I really liked the flavor of the dressing best and the fresh carrots stood out.

Vegetable Fried Rice ($8.95) - I felt there could have been a little more flavor in this dish. The size was perfect especially if sharing, but the carrot and peas didn't really stand out flavor-wise. The rice was cooked just right though.

Szechuan Beef ($16.95) - So good! The beef was so tender and the whole dish together just tasted great. The huge fresh mushrooms were tasty.

Orange slices were brought to each of us at the end of the meal. I felt the charge of $3.95 for a soda was steep. Free refills, but almost the price of an appetizer. The service was great and we left full and pleased! The owner stopped to talk to us for a moment and she's genuinely passionate about the type of food they are putting out as well the type of service they provide.

They offer delivery so call to check the areas they cover. You can also place your order for pick-up if you don't want to dine inside. They have lunch specials that range in price from $7.95, $8.95, $9.95 and $10.95 depending on what you order and it includes soup, egg roll and choice of steamed or egg fried rice.

We have really enjoyed other Ramsay restaurants. The wait for BurGR is just ridiculous! We were told it would be a 2 hour wait and they would let us know by text (they text your phone) when the table was ready. I'm not much of a burger eater and rarely order them anywhere, but with Ramsay having his name on the restaurant must mean it's going to be worth the 2 hour wait right? Wong! When I first heard how long the wait would be, I wasn't even upset. I had been wanting to try BurGR and with a wait time like that I got more excited to try one of these well loved burgers. One thing is they have strict rules here at BurGR. When we got the text alert that our table was ready, some of us needed to use the restroom on our way back to the restaurant. Now we were on the property, never left. The hostess still refused to seat anybody until everybody was there and accounted for. Really? it seemed like we were on a field trip and the bus driver was counting heads to make sure everyone was on the bus.

Once we got seated it took 10 minutes for our server to acknowledge us and he took our appetizer order, but not our food order. He literally took off after we said what app we wanted. Around 15 minutes later our "Roasted Jalapeno Poppers" priced at $12 showed up at the table. They looked so good!!! Too bad they didn't live up to what I saw. The insides were still cold. It was only hot on the outside and the poppers were a real disappointment to our whole table. The cheddar ranch that comes with it just tasted like regular ranch. The poppers come in shot glasses with the ranch and we still had one left on the table that nobody really wanted. 20 minutes later our server came back to take our dinner order. Phew it was some wait time from beginning to finish at this place! Hubby and I decided to split a burger and a hot dog and the fries and rings are a generous portion so we just got 1 order of each for the table to share. 

"Just Fries" ($8) - They are hand-cut and come with a side each of curry ketchup and chipotle ketchup. I really feel for the price you get a lot of fries and even if sharing, you will still have plenty. The problem is the fries came out ice cold. I picked one up to taste and spit it back out. Nobody at our table wanted to eat the fries. 

"Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings" ($9) - Parmesan cheese on the rings with  chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip on the side. Again, the portion and price are very fair, but the rings were straight up ice cold and the ranch is ranch, nothing cheddar about it. 

"American Burger" ($13) - The burger had american cheese, onions, tomatoes, pickles and butter lettuce. When our food arrived to the table, 40 minutes after placing the order, I'm pretty sure my mouth started to drool as the burger was put down in front of me. It looked very good. I will say they after cutting the burger in half, I noticed that it was cooked just as I requested which is actually hard to come by here in Vegas. Too bad the actual burger had zero flavor. The burgers are grilled over apple and cider wood is what they brag about here yet the burger seriously had no flavor and like the other food it wasn't even warm. There was way too much bun going on with this burger and every time I took a bite the bread fell apart as the rest of the burger. It was just not good at all. There wasn't anything I ate during this experience that was enjoyable. 

"Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg" ($13) - Too much dog, not enough bun. Did taste decent, but they need a bigger bun for it. Better than the burger! Hmmm.

I let our server know that the food was cold and the fries and rings were so ice cold that  t hey must have been sitting for a while. Our server responded with "Sorry, I was busy doing stuff and then I had to go to the bathroom" to which I replied "did you at least wash your hands after touching your junk and brought our food" and he just said "I'll take the fries off" and then he was gone. The whole meal should have been free since it was mostly still on the table because we didn't want to eat it. I said very clearly and loudly that I had a total rewards card to get the discount on our bill and he just shrugged it off and charged the card with the regular prices anyway. If you have a total rewards card then you save so much off each menu item. So you can see where this can actually add up every time a menu item is added to the tab. I said something to him and he said that he would correct it, but it would take a long time and the card would have to be charged twice to fix it. We just said to forget it and I told him it would come from his tip. My friend ordered a burger and paid extra to have an egg added and was specific about it having a runny yolk. Our server said that wouldn't be a problem, but when our food came the egg on her burger was cooked way too long meaning no runny yolk. Such a major disappointment Gordon Ramsay BurGR turned out to be.

"A feast worthy of Gods"

Baccarnal Buffet in Caesar Palace is consider the best buffet in the Las Vegas by most food critics   It rated highest in trip advisor and yelp for a buffet restaurant in Vegas.  I was only going to eat Buffet once in this trip, so I decided must try the best there is available.  My review is based on late breakfast and lunch during a non-holiday weekday.  Finding this place is confusing and take more than five minutes from the main entrance to get here, this is common in most buffet in the strip.  

Admission Price
*Breakfast (Monday - Friday, 7 a.m. - 11 a.m.): $25.99
*Brunch (Saturday - Sunday, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $40.99
* Lunch (Monday - Friday, 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $32.99
* Dinner (Daily, 3 p.m. - 10 p.m.): $45.99 on weekdays, $50.99 on weekends 
* Holiday expect to paid $10 more.
* Total Reward Card Holder gets $1 off.
* Price not included the 8.1% sales tax.

Atmosphere
The interior is similar to those of mid-level restaurant, they claim it cost 17 million that might not felt like it perhaps they included all the equipment and kitchen tools in to the cost.  There is a lot of seating, but do not count it those do not mean anything during dinner and weekend which can get full very quick.  The dessert section is separate counter from the rest of the food.

Customer Service
We got assign an individual server, at first she was helpful but quickly kind of forgot our table.  This was not during a weekday lunch so is not busy; there is was still several table empty.  Imagine in dinner or weekend, the service might be worst. The nicest thing is that they did not enforce the 2 hours eating time limit as they normally do in a busy time.   During peak hours, you would need to get an estimated waiting time in a kiosk machine, 

Beverage
You can to choose variety of juice and coffee.  Some yelper was right that the juice they serving were no longer freshly squeezed, but instead are concentrate and probably are pre-made package.  At this price tag, they should had keep the fresh juice instead of during the cheap way.  I was told that the Mexico Section would had fresh juice and Hocharta but never came out.

Breakfast
The item in the breakfast was the best part of the hot food section I think.  The typical American favorite food like Scramble Egg and Fried Chicken are just perfect in term of texture and flavor.  The dim sum was disappoint, it tasted like those cheap takeout place. 

Seafood
At this price they don't had crab leg for lunch, I heard Aria is the only in the strip serve cheaper.  I can settle with no crab leg as long the other item in the seafood make up for it.  However, it failed to impress me at all.  The got the jumbo shrimp cocktail, looks good but tasted plain.  Probably the worst jumbo shrimp I've tasted.  The oyster was small and wasn't much flavor either, lack freshness.  The smock salmon was not that great either, they got three version and all were no good.  Sushi was ok, I like the sushi rice it was authentic one, however the tuna wasn't good.  But salmon was alright.  There was no specialty or hand roll here.

Noodle Section
Skip this one, it was the worst section in the buffet I think.  They use pre-packed noodle, not even the good kind.  I try their Ramen, they use nissin kinds of noodle.  The broth was supposed to be Tonkotsu it tasted more like Shoyu.  There was tiny slice of chashu.  If they wanted to had this type of item, better get it right.  The pho was slight better but still no even close to the real Pho you can from any shop in L.A.

Meat Section
I tried their sausage and beef ribs, it was mediocre at best.  The person that cutting the meat is cool with smile.  There was no lamb chop for lunch, but they do serve prime ribs. The best food in the hot section were the sliders, those were mouthwatering.   I should had get more of those.  I think the burger were prime meat it was extreme flavorful.  Actually, it tasted better than the Gordon Ramsey Hell Burger, which later I eat that night.  The made to order taco wasn't good.  It tasted like king taco and other cheap taco place.

Dessert Section
They dessert has variety of food but nothing really won me over except one item.  Their made to order crepes were the best dessert easily. Fresh and with the right texture, I added the ice cream which was heavenly match.  Their Crme brle was too watery.

Fruit and Salad
They were pretty good in general, Large selection of salads.  You won't get disappoint here.  Just wish they were more fruits.

My 2 Cents
To be honest I am debating giving this 4 or 3 stars, I ended gave a four since there few dish were excellent and the best I had (Sliders, Crepes, Fried Chicken) .  But many other dish were average and even bad..  The price is the problem, they need to better quality and included more crab leg or lamb chop to worth the price.  I didn't get any food sickness after eating here over 2 hours which is a good sigh that the food is prepare it right.

I purchased a yelp deal ($12 for $20) a while ago and attempted to eat here close to a month ago, but the power was out so the girl who was inside said she wouldn't be able to serve us since they had no power to cook with. Bummed since I had this place on my radar due to all of the positive yelp reviews and the the food sounded good, I understood and figured we'd just come back another time. Fast forward to a few days ago when hubby and I decided to give this place a try again. This time the power was on yay! Walking in it is confusing because there is no sign saying to seat your self or to wait to be seated. After standing there for a few minutes and seeing no employees I decided we would just seat ourselves. There were already a couple other filled tables, so I figured the employees might have been taking care of their orders in the back and it turns out there was just one girl working the whole floor and one cook in the back. Once she noticed we were there she did check on us often and was very friendly. Inside has mostly purple walls and bright red booths. It's obvious they are going for a Mardi Gras theme, but it could have been done better. Most of the decor has signs on it that say "for sale" since they are closing at this location.

I ordered what was probably the most simple thing on the menu, but it was what sounded good. Priced at $6.95 (regular size) I ordered the "Royal Street" and priced at $2.95 the "Bananas Fosters Rue Royal" for dessert. 

My sandwich came with a side of Cajun Fries and Coleslaw. The coleslaw was crunchy and had just the right amount of dressing tossed in it so it wasn't dry or soggy. The problem with the coleslaw though was it had absolutely no flavor at all and after three bites I put it aside. I was surprised at the side of fries since the menu said it came with a side of "Cajun Chips" and after seeing the pictures on yelp, I was really looking forward to trying them. Now let me get to the fries. The fries were absolutely perfect! The fries were cooked just right and whatever seasoning they put on them tasted really great. I wished I had no coleslaw and all fries. I don't know what the Cajun Chips tasted like, but i'm sure the Cajun Fries I had made up for it. 

The sandwiches come in regular and large sizes. The Royal Street is a grilled cheese with tomato sandwich. If you want your sandwich "dressed" you will get the addition of lettuce, tomatoes, mayo and pickles. Since I ordered a grilled cheese I wondered how that would turn out, but our server said it was one of her favorite sandwiches on the menu and it is really good with the additions, so I went for it. I have to first say that I really did enjoy my sandwich and would totally eat it again. Now let me say that the sandwich just wasn't what the menu described. There was nothing grilled about it. The bread was extremely good. I mean the bread was so soft and tasty and still held the fillings in nicely. I did order a grilled cheese though and the bread had no grill marks and there was nothing crunchy about the bread. The kids menu even mentions that if your kids have a hard time eating crunchy bread to let them know, but a kid would have no problem eating the bread on the sandwich I had. I also kept hearing the microwave going off and the door opening and closing and when hubby asked me how they got the cheese on both pieces of bread melted if they didn't grill it, the whole noise of the microwave came to my mind. I don't know that's what they did, but the sandwich wasn't at all a grilled cheese. 

When I ordered the Bananas Fosters Rue Royal for dessert and I heard our server tell the cook the order, I heard the microwave start up again. I think they were heating up the bananas maybe. This was a decent dessert. I wish there was more bananas it it, but hubby and I both enjoyed sharing it and there was a nice big scoop of ice cream in it that was perfect for sharing. 

I asked our server about the chips/fries switch up and she said that they signed a 6 year lease, but wont be able to stay at the location they are in because the whole building will be coming down with the expansion of the freeway. She said that the owner is unfortunately going through some health problems right now and between that and moving locations (if they can find one she says) some of the menu isn't available right now. If you are craving alligator or Cajun chips you are out of luck. They wont be serving them and some other items until they figure out where and if they are moving. The girl was very nice and like I said I did like my food aside from the coleslaw, but it would have been better for the server to let us and every customer know what is and isn't available on the menu so they aren't disappointed when they get something else on their plate or have to pick something else to eat and look over the menu again. I hope they do find another location and work out the kinks because I'd try them again in the future.
