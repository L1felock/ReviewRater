I really like the pedicure at Furama, and they're the only salon I let put glitter polish on my piggies.

Sometimes their state of the art massage chairs alternate between goosing and squeezing my bum.

Sometimes, when you order the callous removal, they grate a hole in your foot with that cheese grating tool, and sometimes they don't... but the pedicure is so good you'll be back.

Their tagline should be: Furama Nails - So good, you wont care when we cheese-grate a hole into your foot.

Words of Advice:
Don't bond with a stripper right before you are going to get a lap dance.  Knowing about her kids, drug habits, preference of deoderent and relationship with her father does not make the dance more erotic.  I felt like I was getting grinded on by my slutty younger cousin. And that's weird.

The strippers are very nice here and there is a nice mix of real boobies and fake boobies if you like variety.  And if you are a girl you might or might not leave with a hickey for free.  Bonus!

The ultimate luxurious lingerie! The fit is perfect, the lacy fabric is soft, the look is hot, the feeling a little naughty paired with my sexy Loubatins!

Coach has separate distribution channels for Outlets, which is not the same as you find in their store. These are cheaper, less expensive bags.  So when see the "Now $169, originally $298", keep in mind they were never sold someplace else for $298.00.

Simply put, you can buy it cheaper at Macy's during a sale!  Ugh.

Regrettably, I have to admit I've been here more then a few times over the years -- as well as their facilities on Shea Boulevard and Thunderbird.

All the Departments are excellent, as are the surgeons.  You may not be in Rochester, MN but these folks are the best!

My best advice is to stay healthy!  

But, if you must be sick, find yourself in need of an operation, wake up one morning with the knowledge that you have Radiation treatment in your future, or Chemo; then there is no better place to seek help!

BTW, Patrick in Spiritual Care is very good and, life doesn't suck!

This is probably the easiest trail that you're ever going to hike besides walking around your block. You only go up an additional 400 plus feet in elevation during the hike. I believe the total loop is a little over 4 miles. This is a great hike for beginners and hiking in groups where you can have casual conversations. There are some rocky parts but mostly this is a dirt trail. This hike at a slow walking pace is about a two hour hike. There are some nice vistas so bring your camera.

I was unimpressed today with this do it yourself (DIY) car wash. 

It was a nice touch having a credit card accepting swipper to go with that Quarter eating dial apparatus that starts at $1.75

However the water pressure is low and the "Spotless" setting is sadly all but ineffective.  In a hard water area like greater Phoenix, you would think they could get this right. 

Return factor, zero.  Sorry.

Visitors who don't hike a lot and who are just looking for a casual and a good workout hike, read this. I repeat, read this. This part of Camelback Mountain is for you. Only do Echo Canyon if you are up for hoisting yourself up with your hands and climbing boulders. This hike doesn't have that. This hike is simple hiking up a mountain. It's best to wear hiking shoes to help with traction, but the most strenuous part of the hike is getting a stair master workout with climbing up over small rocks. Parking can be tough so it's best to go during off hours or park further away and walk. Dogs are welcome and on a clear day, the views are nice!

I think this place took notes of the complaint of the smoke smell here, cuz as soon as i walked in here, i felt like the place was doused in perfume. I had a headache, and this place made me super nauseous with their overpowering vanilla scent trying to hide the smoke. 
Other than that, the place is beautiful- and has one of my favorite stops in vegas- Jean Phillipe Patisserie. Dude stayed here before for a bachelor party and our friends stayed here also. Thumbs up on their stay. Very modern rooms. 
And more important note again, there is a Jean Phillipes.

I joined Massage Envy during my second pregnancy because I experienced severe pain in my lower back and hips (sometimes I couldn't walk). After trying a few different therapists, I got Tim. He is awesome! He gives the best massages, and has been the only therapist to alleviate the pain in my lower back and hips. If you want a massage, go to Tim!
The front desk staff is always friendly and polite, and the rooms are always clean and relaxing. If you have chronic problems with muscle tension, Massage Envy is well worth the commitment.

Well. At least until we come out with the VMarie Poochie line. You won't find mainstream dog food here, so don't expect Alpo or Purina.

By far my favorite place in Vegas to see a concert. With the "beach like" lighting and palm trees, mixed with the surroundings of city center this venue is truly the best of both worlds. Ive seen numerous shows here such as Death Cab For Cutie, Foster The People, and Ben Iver. And those I can honestly say were 3 of my favorite concerts ever. How do they have a concert in the pool you ask? they drain it of course :) Also with amazing backdrops for photo opps, you cant go wrong with this place.

This is what a manicure should be! They give you a polish with your manicure and the tools they use to clean your nails - you get to take these home, like a party favor. Granted, prices are a bit steeper at about $50 for a mani. A hot tea was lovely. And my manicurist took her time and it was really relaxing. They use the highest quality products and the spa is lovely. You can use any of the showers/baths anytime during the day of your service.

Mama Mia! Fast food Italian. Who woulda thunk it? Well. Somebody incompetent and passionless. I would rename this place Yuckoli's. Fits better. 

I knew I was treading on dicey turf going to this joint. But it was in Rickie's old hood and the culinary establishments were limited to fast food and chain restaurants. So I went basic with spaghetti and meatballs (oh God, really, for the love of balls, these circular beef objects were filled with some sawdust like material and blander than Jennifer Aniston's movie career). Not good. We also tried a chicken Alfredo like dish that apparently was made with Elmer's glue. 

Pasty. Bland. And, yes, it does stick to construction paper. 

I wasn't expecting much. But I wasn't expecting to be grossed out. All I can say is "Mama Mia, papsa a pee'ah, daddy's got the diarrhea". 

There. 

That's classy. And Elite of me. Don't ya think?

The food was dry and pointless. The atmosphere was useless. I could see the people at all the tables making that face of disgust. Each plaint appeared on the table as though it was just thrown together but a terrible team of kitchen workers. 

If there was one chef in the kitchen then things probably would have been better.

As a Minnesota native I've had the pleasure of seeing my Vikings reach four Super Bowls. Well, I didn't see them in the first one, cuz I was barely an embryo at the time. But I was glued to the screen for three of those championship games. 
We lost the first one. 
And the second.
No shit. We lost the third.
Fourth times a charm though, right? In my best Whitney, "Oh hell to the NO!"
Zero for four. Just like Mclean Stevenson sitcom career. 

So Cardinals. YEA! Kickass and Woo Freakin' Hoo Baby! I'm stoked for the big game. How ironic it could be that the 2nd most losingest franchise in all of sports history (second only to the Cubs) may give me the joy of my first Super Bowl win. 

Now. Time to make the chili and chill the beer.

I did score a coffee bean grinder for twelve bucks. But I was covered in cardboard box grime. It's cluttered and hard to navigate the filthy aisles. 

Really? Is sweeping too much to ask? Listen, if I ever stop by again, I'll bring my Swiffer.

Need an Alvin and the Chipmunk get up? Easleys.
Need masks for a glamorous "Eyes Wide Shut" kinda party. Easley's.
Need a tail to complete a grown man dressed up as a kitty. Easley's.
Need a pink cowboy hat bedazzled with silver rhinestones. Easley's. 

Need a vintage Hello Kitty brouche (spell check not working!) to attach to pink cowboy hat bedazzled with silver rhinestones so it can be worn to an upcoming yelp Elite Event at Rustler's Rooste. Not Easley's. 

Thankfully I have a designer boyfriend with lots of goodies in his studio. So that was an easy fix. 

What a fun place this would be to work. And it must be. Staff is always friendly and helpful. Easley's is a Phoenix institution. 

Like Jan Brewer's speech coach. 
Like Dan Harkins parking spot.
Like, well, like an early fall kick in the nuts heat wave from Mother Nature.

If I could give this place a negative stars, I would. I witnessed blatant prejudice, discrimination and slight racism. I never got any eye contact from "Brian" and was treated with disregard for an entire 30 minutes. During this time of disgrace, I personally witnessed the bouncers tell ppl they had to get bottle service to get in (aren't attractive enough)  and the best? Informing an inter racial couple (female) she can't get in because she was with a guy who had cornrows. Oh interesting. I might not be a super model, high class escort or name drop out here but I wish I could drop "Brian " and his bouncers with their prejudicial ways off a cliff, discriminating, demeaning, insensitive nobodies!

I was really impressed by this bagel option at CLT.  

Granted CLT seems to have an Einstein Bagels everywhere, but this one offers a more interesting food option.  The sandwich was very good. But I felt for the folks behind the counter who were friendly, but because it was New Years Day, looked like they were pulling a double shift.

I ordered the Turkey bagel.  It was very good, had a fair amount of meat on it and the bagel stood up to the toasting. All pluses in my book.

Wow. A vintage/thrift store that doesn't smell like my Aunt Helen's wig closet. No stench of mothballs, decaying bodies or stale smoke from an old pack of Capri Ultra Light Menthol 120s. 

Organized. Well staffed. Well, staffed by people who are actually engaging and interested in you. Unlike SO many other similar shops in this area where you get a little bit of "OH, you are so lucky to peruse my crap" attitude. 

Most importantly...great stuff. Vintage Italian dishware (think Fiesta with a Tuscan twist), Disney movie stills, framed, and selling for a mere Abraham and an entire case of well lit (much like myself at the time of shopping) Prada, Jimmy Choo and Minola Blanaks!! Just my luck! None in my size.

We hired this company recently to unload a Broadway Express trailer on a very hot Sunday afternoon in July.  Thankfully, Conrad was happy to provide a crew for our move despite it being on a Sunday and despite us not knowing an exact start time.  Both Conrad and Jessie were great on the phone and were so kind and flexible with our situation.  When our crew arrived, we were thankful for their hard work and their desire to make sure we were satisfied.  Rene did a wonderful job and we really appreciated the hard work of the crew.  If you are looking for a reliable moving crew in the Phoenix area, you really can't go wrong with Creative Moving and Packing!

The people who patronize this establishment are the kind of people that bring their babies and/or children to the bar on Friday night. 

Just stop and think about that for a moment.

You have a baby.................. in a bar???

To add insult to injury, the Chupacabra margarita tastes like dirty, soapy ass. How dare they insult my precious X Files by naming this horrific drink after the mystical character that Fox and Dana chased after in one of my favorite episodes ever? Blasphemy. 

Finally, I will close this review with the tweet I sent whilst using the ladies restroom (yes, I tweet and pee at the same time):

"If you are ever looking for a dirty, sloppy, drunken lay then head to the womens restroom at salty senorita peoria"


Oh, PS... Thanks to Andrew K I just realized I missed the most important text of the night:

"I'm too drunk to be alive. Sincerely, in hell in Peoria"

Amazing!  From the first call to the time the installer left these people were great!   

They installed a dog door through my block wall.  Not even a scratch on the paint or a bit of dust left behind.  (They ever bring their own vacuum cleaner!)

Now my lazy ass doesn't have to get off the couch to let the dog out anymore.   It took my puppy about 2 hours before he figured it out and now he loves freedom.

I had a very immediate need to print something that someone had emailed to me and I was too far away from home to go back there. Here's FedEx/Kinko's to the rescue!

Sign in to their workstation with a credit card swipe, bring up the email, print the email, sign out. $1.32 and done. I didn't have to wait in line and I didn't even have to deal with a clerk.

Note: I do not suggest that anyone ever use one of these public "kiosk" machines to access your email account. Instead, create a "throwaway" mailbox and forward and sign in to that one. This is how hackers get access to your mailbox - by capturing the letters you type on a public keyboard! With doodads like this: http://www.amazon.com/Keyllama-4MB-USB-Value-Keylogger/dp/B004ZGXU48

This is our sixth, or seventh IKEA and they are universally good.

I agree with Laura L's observation... on there stuff being mostly particle board.  But I'm sitting in my Cherry wood office at work and sadly, it's particle board too.  It looks great, but it's particle board. LOL  

It is a sad statement on furniture in general.  But, we still have our Bully book shelves from three moves ago and one of our kids is always needing something for their college apartment, or whatever.  Mirrors, picture frames, plants, bedsheets for college and LAMPS...

My addiction is their lighting and candles.  Their florescence bulbs are less expensive than any other retailer and they never burnout.  Some people stock 50lbs bags of rice in their basements, I stock florescence bulbs.  LOL Sorry, family joke.  

The Tempe store is nicely laid out and they still carry those Swedish meatballs downstairs.  

Enjoy!

A friend of mine likes to point out that Savers, as opposed to Goodwill, is a "for profit" business. No matter, I love them both. 

Like Goodwill, I come here most for the books. The knick-knacks, and all of the other "stuff" is fun to go through and seems to be of very high quality. When the Ulitmate Electronics closed a few years ago, I was surprised that Savers wanted the space. But in the end, I guess it was a matter of location, location, location as they say.

Savers also has a frequent buyer's card and discounts for seniors on Wednesdays. If you sign up, they will email you when they are having sales. Nice!

Full Disclosure: I've thrown 2 events here

Fuller Disclosure: I'm now a member and will review from that vantage point

Fullest Disclosure: I didn't shower yesterday

Any who, I joined this studio for a reason... It's the most spacious yoga studio I've been in and it offers hot boot camp. I have no patience for yoga (ironic), so the fact that I can get a workout and sweat out all the shame from nights prior is very appealing to me. These classes are GRUELING, but you feel amazing afterward. The instructors are animals, but don't mind if you need a break or have to grab some air. They get it. It's f'n hot. There are 2 boot camps a day , so it works with most schedules. After your class you can hit the locker room for a shower and not feel cramped in the least. They provide towels, shampoo, soap, etc. so no need to bring any extras. 

Into hot yoga? Bored of the gym? Hit up 103. Not sure if it's for you? Sign up for the 30 days for $30 special.

Just living is not enough... one must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower.
Hans Christian Andersen

I was going stir-crazy after living four years amidst the sand, heat, concrete and LED lights that compromises most of what I know as Las Vegas. I love Las Vegas, it is home, but one thing I miss, living in this great city of ours, is nature. Sure, we have the breathtaking desert, but I need trees! I need water. Birds that go quack. Little slippery things that swim and taste good. I need Sunset Park. 

This little square mile or so of paradise has been my haven. It has everything I need, a manmade lake, hiking trails, frisbee golf, and GRASS. LOTS OF GRASS. Hello allergies, how I missed thee (in a weird way). On mornings when my insomnia is raging, I try to walk the mile-long obstacle course, as it clears my head and soothes the mind. The place is a soul saver.

Vanguard has been at the forefront of the low cost/ low management fee mutual fund movement started by John Bogle some forty plus years ago. 

Bogle's philosophy was based in part on the concepts put forth by the University of Chicago Nobel economist Harry Markowitz. It stated that the stock market was truly efficient, and therefore impossible to outperform through stock selection.  Instead, Vanguard offers an Index approach to overcome this conundrum.

Today, the equity markets have embraced the Index fund movement.  No longer is Vanguard just Index'er, but have grown to include ETFs and annuities as well.  Though headquartered back east in Pennsylvania, their Scottsdale complex is huge.  I've found it equally impressive driving past there at 6 am and seeing the entire parking lot full.

As Harry Markowitz proved, it is was impossible to outperform the market by timing your purchases of stocks, so consider an index instead. Yes, I am a fan.

Sprouts is like a Trader Joe's on steroids. Same quality organic items, but wayyy more selection. Unfortunately, the prices are a bit jacked as well. Sure, it's still cheaper than Whole Paycheck, but it'll still cost you a pretty penny . Aisles are clean, staff is friendly and there are some good cuts of meat in the cuts of meat aisle :) If you're sick of the tight quarters in TJ's, this is your new home. 

Pro tip: there is a section with dozens of items dipped in dark chocolate. Do not miss this.

After dining at the restaurant we rolled back into the club (which weirdly you have to leave, re-pay, and come back in). The place was packed beyond the point of sensibility. A crowded club can be fun, but they stuff people in here like sardines. As a result there was really no place to dance comfortably, meeting people is near impossible, and the highlight was leaving. XS and Tryst in Encore and the Wynn are both prettier clubs and easier to navigate, I'd skip this one.

Occasionally you can score some hottie 2xist undies. But the real gospel. Is found in housewares. TONS of great stuff from vases, sculptures, wine glasses, Calphalon, little boxes you have no use for but they're so darn cute you just have to buy them and find space on some random shelf or dresser at home....TJ...Thanks Jesus.

The f****ing worst. Called them at 8am to schedule a pickup. They were nice on the phone and told me to call back in 10 min when I was ready to roll bc a driver might be there in 10 min, 30min the latest. I called back 10 min later (8:10) and ordered the cab. Sounded easy peasy. Was told to wait in the lobby and to wait for a call from the driver... as you can imagine, both the call and the cab NEVER CAME. So, I was forced to roam the streets looking for a cab at 9:10, an hour after booking a cab through this shite company. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT CALL lvcabs.com to book a cab, unless you really, really enjoy aimlessly hanging out in your lobby.

It's definitely not the Encore or Wynn. The spa is lovely. The gym has great equipment but no bottled water. The rooms were okay but seemed dated. The whole sunken living room idea seems very 1970. Getting help from the concierge was a bit frustrating as they were at capacity. They were able to accommodate a late checkout, which was appreciated but I would not choose to stay here again as I think there are several Vegas properties that are much nicer.

"Lord help me," is what was going through my head the moment I approached this 'beach club.' It is not really a beach club as there is in fact no beach. There is a pool... And there are some places to sit down, but only if you are willing to fork over several THOUSAND dollars for those precious seats. Otherwise you are forced to lay your towel practically in the planter and jam into the pool where there isn't an ounce of swimming, only people rubbing up against one another attempting to dance? I think? I hope?

Anyway, if you are looking for a relaxing pool environment than avoid this spot at all costs! If you are looking for a nightclub during the day with people practically naked, then you have found your haven.

Be careful at this place.  You have been warned.  They are thieves who have no shame in cheating, stealing and manipulating their patrons.

I was drunk and collapsed in the mens bathroom.  Security saw me in my state, instead of helping me out of the complex, they took me to a VIP booth, ordered me 2 coffees and 2 waters ($40 charge + tip).  Next thing I know, I have 3 strippers all over me... massaging my back trying to help me.... so I thought.  They stole my cash (thankfully they left $3 in there for a cab) and on 3 separate occasions tried to use my credit cards.  Unfortunately, 1 of the transactions was processed - thankfully the bank did NOT honor the payment after I complained.

So I ordered a chicken burrito with fries. The burrito was flavorless and the fries were decent. I guess I should have ordered something else but "if you don't eat you meat you can't have any pudding. How can you have any pudding, if you don't eat your meat?"

Sometimes you sit around and hate on hipsters because they drink 'silly, overpriced cocktails'. Well, sometimes hipsters drink those 'silly, overpriced cocktails' and are happy that you stayed at home. Such is the case at Velveteen Rabbit. If this 'hipster haven' keeps serving up well-crafted cocktails (at a decent $8 price), interesting craft brews and rockin' good tunes, consider me a hipster, because I'm going to be a regular here. The furniture, exposed brick and Edison bulbs add a nice vibe to the place and the crowd (even on a Friday at 1am) isn't overbearing. Sick of a rum and coke?

I'm a beach babe at heart and this is the closest I can get in Arizona without planning a longer journey. The lake is very calm. I like to hang out at Butcher Jones Recreation Area because it has a large beach and the water is shallow, good for hanging out with friends or family. We brought our dog last time, which I guess you're not supposed to do, but I kept him on the leash and there were no problems. 

FYI- No campfires in the summertime! Bring a grill or sandwiches. :0) Also if you plan on drinking, make sure one person stays sober. There will be cops looking for you on the way out. Going to the lake and getting a DUI would definitely ruin a day at the lake.

Once upon a time, in a city far, far from Cranberry Twp, two special little elfs stirred up flour and sugar and tons of chocolate together, (actually it was childhood friends Eileen Spitalny & David Karvetz) and founded Fairytale Brownies way back in 1992.  Since that day, many diet rules have been broken and many pounds have been gained.  The pecan brownies and pecan blondie's are to die for.  And the best (or is it the worst?) part is, you can order these things on-line!  Isn't that great??? I will never have to bake, again!!

In the age old debate of length v. girth, Sky Harbor is clearly a proponent of length. I swear this airport is three miles long. And if you have a connection... well, good luck running across the entire airport from people mover to people mover. It's one long, long, long, long, line of hallways and people movers. 

Over and over and over and over again. But... they've got free wifi! ...oh, that only works about 60% of the time. Well, it'll do. They do have clean-ish bathrooms and loads of options as far as airport eateries go. 

But if you take one thing away from this review, let it be this: Length isn't always the answer.

Here's a list of things I could hypothetically do in the amount of time it takes Pura Vida to make lunch:

- Read a few books on the subject of restaurant ownership
- Build an organic  farm in my backyard
- Grow an entire crop of fruits and vegetables
- Learn to cook an entire menu's worth of vegetarian recipes
- Get a restaurant business license
- Get a small business loan and lease a suitable property
- Grow a full, luxurious beard

I had a lunch reservation at 1:45. At 2:30 they called me up to tell me that they could not have my food ready until 3:15. I ordered a quesadilla and some soup, not The Great Pyramids of Egypt. 

Instead of apologizing for wasting my time, the chef immediately got defensive and indignant with me. The whole restaurant got to watch a soap opera moment unfold as she blamed her employee for poor time management, then she blamed me for not being flexible. Dinner and a show! 

I do not recommend you to go to Pura Vida Bakery & Bystro.

What an amazing convention center!!!!

PERKS
+ Ample parking
+ Bus routes available for those attending the convention center
+ Taxis and limos available outside as well
+ Friendly employees to assist you to the right direction
+ Bathrooms are kept clean!

DIRTS
- Overpriced food at the food-court
- Need more seating area for those hanging around the convention center
- Be prepared for lots of walking! (Bring comfy shoes!)
- Taxi and limo drivers can be kinda reckless!

FYI =
* Nearby hotels: You can stay either at Excalibur, Luxor or Mandalay Bay
* Tram from Excalibur & Luxor connects to Mandalay Bay so you can just walk towards the convention center (~10-15 minutes travel time)
* Wedding chapel and Shark reef attraction is in the same area as the convention center
* Border Grill is walking distance towards the casino if you're looking for a better bite to eat than at the food court!

McCarran International is OK with me.

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=WsuJ5IHUm04S80QaDtxgUg&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

But it has its pros and cons.

Pros:
Very helpful friendly staff. 
Not overly busy (like LAX)
Slot Machines (see cons)
Free Wi Fi
Plenty of food options
Very Clean!
Verizon recharge place to plug in electronics
Happy gamblers who won!

Cons:
Expensive Shops (had to buy 3 make up gifts I left on car rental transit)
Rent a car is miles away from airport (15-20min shuttle)
Slot machines (see pros)
TSA was not very efficient
Planes taxi on runway for ever! 
Crabby gamblers who lost!
Huge airport! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mccarran-international-airport-las-vegas?select=ty-612sK0khE6Ypq5W0kuw#YWur8tXdIaEDWDVKhVM_7A

Still beats the hell out of driving 4.5 hours each way!

I'll be back!

Of the thousands of yellow cabs hailed in NYC and other locations, this was the single most offensive cab ride I've ever had. There was a line-up at McCarren after I landed and I was directed towards a cab. The man took my bag and I hopped inside. Told him I was going to the HRH. His reaction... "F U! I waited for 20 min and you go the the f'n HARD ROCK. THE HARD ROCK. Why do you go there? This is bullsh*t."
Me: Are you talking to me?
Driver: **huge belch** f*ck you...

He dropped me off and was shocked I didn't tip him. 

Me: You should be nicer to people when they come into town.
Driver: F*ck you

I took the $5 tip I was going to give to him and immediately threw it into a video blackjack machine. It turned into $20 after two hands. #Win 

Skip this company if you can. The other reviews don't lie.

I almost feel bad giving a mediocre review to a park. Yea, you know a place with trees, grass, picnickers and such. Like how can it defend its poor dried up self. It's like picking on Phyllis Diller. But seriously, Phoenix, this is our big main park? This is our Central Park? Ugh! Well, let's just say SISP needs a makeover more than Ty Pennington needs to put down that damn megaphone. Yea. More than that. I've been here for many events. Most recently to walk our beloved Emilie. Oh. She's a dog by the way. This massive inner city urban park was completely empty on a Sunday afternoon. Mind you it was 158 degrees out. So how about making some water-type activities available. And I don't mean the sludgy pond with the homeless man peeing in it. Dare I say, a water slide. Or putt putt golf where it mists on you all the time. Or the world's largest slip n slide. Let's be creative here. The grass was crunchier than a Berkley lesbian. The landscape was as desolate as Jessica Simpson's mind. Just sad. I want a park. I want a landmark park. Any ideas yelpers???

It's okay. I wasn't really blown away. The pizza comes out of the oven freaky fast but I've had better pizzas at Peter Piper. I get that you can pick out your ingredients "Chipotle Style". But realistically, isn't that the standard feature for every other pizza joint? They also serve salads. So I would sum this place up as a poor man's "Sauce".

After a three night stay at the Cosmopolitan and three nights checking out Bond, this small bar near the LV Strip Entrance did not live up to hype. It's a-ok, but was dead all three nights except for some people gambling on machines at the bar. 

This Bond was nothing like the cool suave style of a sexy British spy. 

It was more like Double O Disappointment. Hey-yo!

We must of went during an off period because there were no DJs or dancers any of the nights. It was just a nice, clean bar. Again, it's fine, but nothing exciting or really special if there aren't dancers or DJs.

I can only offer praises... yes, it can get busy, but it's worth the wait.  The spa pedicure has everything I could want... callous, sugar scrub, hot towel, and my personal fave... paraffin.

It's like that line from Karate Kid, "Get him a body bag!"... yes, I would love to fully immerse myself in that toasty elixir of softness... even m'lady parts.  It's like Snuggle for your epidermis... but alas, they'll only agree to wax your feet... which is good enough for now.

They accept AMEX, Visa & MC, but appreciate cash for gratuity.  I think they'd prefer cash for the whole shebang... I know I would.

They also have no qualms with putting a bright coat of hi-gloss on your little piggies... they will call your bluff... so know this before wandering down a bad path.

And when your done, strut those newly pedicured feet down the asphalt runway to Inta'Juice for a little wheatgrass action.  No one's gonna spoil your party, not today!

"Just Say No!" has been around for years to protect our children from drugs.  Well, if you are over 18 there is one drug you must try...Absinthe, the best show at Caesars Palace.  If you want to hear Celine...watch Titanic.  The best entertainment at Caesars is this "trip" of a lifetime, without a drug test. The venue is a 1800's wooden/stain glass tent from Belgium, set outside at Caesars Palace.  The interior is dark and mysterious with wooden chairs around a small stage and a bar.  The air is that of a freak show and you are waiting for the Elephant Man to come out. Go early and enjoy the whole venue, which includes a very eclectic outdoor lounge filled with artwork and sculptures that are a cross between a haunted house and Alice in Wonderland. The New York Times has called this show Cirque du Soleil meets Rocky Horror.  The acts are so intensely entertaining that you are either crying from laughing or praying on your knees that nobody gets hurt from their amazing feats of acrobatics and stunts.  This show is by no means for the timid.  The performers are so talented and death defying, you experience that sensation of driving by a car accident where you don't want to look but you just HAVE to.  Just say YES to Absinthe!

Amex's Centurion lounge gets 5 stars not only for being very accommodating during my  6 hour delay, but for being one of the finest domestic airport lounges I've had the pleasure to enjoy in awhile. 

From a computer fax station, full bar with premium beer, spirits and wine,  gourmet buffet including Scott Conant of Scarpetta fame's fine cuisine, coffee and refreshments,  to multiple spacious lounge areas with cushy loveseats, private lounge pods with charging stations, kids play zone, chaise lounges looking out into the Tarmac and more, this lounge is pretty much has it all. I know ill most likely be frequenting this one as opposed to the smaller Club VIP Lounge located in the same terminal. Additionally, I'm allowed up to two guests as opposed to a 25$ charge for additional guests at the other lounges. 

It's one of the great perks you get being a valued Amex card member. 

Thanks guys!

H&M. Must stand for Happy and Man. Cuz that's what I was after my shopping spree here recently. We scored three pairs of pants and three or four shirts for $150. And I'm talking styling threads dudes! Not some Buffalo Exchange leftovers. Loved that the men's section is on the entire first floor, right when you walk in. It's kind of divided up into three sections, with plenty of merchandise but not so cluttered you accidentally brush up against a strangers boobies while navigating the aisles. Would have liked a better selection of sunglasses (HELLO THIS IS ARIZONA) and belts (HELLO...Oh, I don't really have an end to this one...). 

H & M. Hot Merchandise. Holy Moses. Happy Man! Yep! Can't wait to return.

Jabbawockeez joins forces with Super Crew (who were throwin' up that tell-tale 'S' with their hands) in an explosive, high energy show. 

I wasn't an avid watcher of ABDC (unlike the screaming fans behind us) but I'd seen it enough times to know I was in for an evening of breaking, poppin' & lockin.' The show turned out to be so much more; audience participation that was really funny (& sometimes quite sexy), a storyline about what a janitor dreams is possible & a diverse soundtrack for the masked dancers to showcase their talent to. 

There is a glow-in-the-dark sequence that is especially memorable; a skit that pays homage to ninjas & martial artists from another era. The dancers put their spin on everyone from NKOTB to queen to beyonce (hilarious!)

The show actually starts when you are in line to enter the Monte Carlo theater, so get there a little early. We got tickets at the tix4tonight booth--about $49 a person, 3rd row. If you are tired of paying Cirque prices & want to see a show that's more upbeat, Mus.i.c is a fantastic alternative. Hell yea, five stars for an entertaining evening! Show is about 2 hours without intermission.

More vinyl than Dita von Teese's closet. If you can imagine. Man, they really cram the LP's into every nook and cranny. I took my friends' here as they are huge music buffs, especially alternative stuff. Me? Pretty mainstream and very 80s...think Cyndi Lauper, Talking Heads and Madonna. But they found some They Must Be Giants and other obscure bands mama never heard of. Two things struck me as interesting here:

1) When Rickie asked the clerk if she could suggest any music they may have he could use for a runway show, she quickly and without thought, said, "I have NO idea." Alrighty then slacker! 

2) I saw two packages of pencils, for sale, hanging on the wall. When I asked her why they sold pencils she quickly and without thought, said, "Well, cuz we're an art supply store you know?" Nope. Didn't know that slacker. Sorry to disturb your vertical nap.

But for all you music lovers, looking for some oldies but goodies, I would imagine this is a very cool place to get your vinyl swag. 

And if you do go, give lil Miss Sunshine a hug for me.

Lions and cougars and manthers! Oh my! Yep. I might as well have been on a safari....the cougars we're thick as thieves. We were here for an event and this joint was jumpin'! Thankfully, it must hold 10,000 people...it is enormous. Lots of different rooms, patios and lounges for the cougars to make their attack. I had VIP service so I can't complain about that. The food was a buffet and was actually quite good. Of course I could have eaten a dish rag and been happy as I needed something to soak up the free Patron. Yep. Free Patron. The crowd was typical for this neck of Scottsdale. Hello stereotype! Could you be any more accurate. I had fun mingling, people watching and leaving. Yep. Leaving. We made a quick escape after I was called a fag in the bathroom by some gelled up, steroided out cardboard head dude. Sorry, just cuz I tried to share a urinal with him. Jeez! What's up with that. Some people are so territorial! I'd go here again, for an event, but never, never for a night out. Adios Barcelona!

Five bucks.  A burger, fries and can of pop.  How can you go wrong?
I had the Guac burger.  It's the reason I took a star away.  The burger itself was great, but the guac?  Notsomuch.  They do have a good array of different toppings to choose from.  
The fries were shoestring-cut and had a spiced salt sprinkled on them.  It was a good-sized serving.  
I love a can of pop!  They have Shasta, which is two thumbs up for me.  It doesn't have NutraSweet in the diet, but Splenda.  Hooray!
Getting out of this place is a bitch so here's my secret: Go out the back way, through the car wash to get to 7th Street.  Traffic on Indian School, right at the 7th Street light, sucks moose balls.

My ode to Estelle Getty:
Picture this. Scottsdale. Hotel Indigo pool. 
A middle aged gay man holding a glass of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc runs to make a photo opp at Rickie's fashion show.
He didn't realize the three svelt female models with air bags for breasts were nude. Naked. Sin ropa! Nada lotta!
Except for their bikini-painted bodies. Yes. Body paint. 
By the pool. Me. Them. Slippery floor. Slippery glass of wine. 
As the photo is being snapped, I find myself losing my balance and I think, as I was going down with the wine, I should grab on to someone's clothing. To brace my fall. In front of hundreds. 
Well. They're nude. There is nothing to grab onto. Me and the wine go down spilling wine on all three of the models.
Causing their body paint to start streaking! SNAP goes the photo. 
Oh. Hotel Indigo? The services? Valet guy parked my car. Hostess greeted me. Bartender overserved me. The models hated me. 
Good times...

Encore performances often are just quick hits to pacify the fans with one last song before calling it a night, but the Encore Hotel is a 2nd verse as good as the first. It matches its sister the Wynn with class, fun, and style.

My Oceans 11 experience.

I did not just finish robbing a casino of millions of dollars but I stood in front of the fountain wishing I had millions.  I was then slowly awakened to reality from the mist from the fountains.  

You cant pass this place up when your visiting Vegas.  Whether its your first time or not.  The Fountains of Bellagio puts on a spectacular water show.  They are synchronized to music from classical, country and pop.  

Show times vary but once it starts there is a show that happens every 15 minute till it ends at midnight.

Locale ~ On the Strip baby!
Extras ~ Great show, Nice to be outside it!

I honestly don't know which I enjoyed more...the beer or the popcorn!  I was skeptical to try a new brewery on Fremont Street, but glad I did.  The beer was very good and what a broad and interesting selection of beers as well.  The sampler had a good range of beers, but I had to try and wasn't disappointed in the Dry Country Belgium Quad!  It was full bodied and the 11% snuck up on me nicely!

Now the popcorn...not sure where they got it, who made it or what they sprinkle on it...but I'm pretty sure it's pure awesome!  I enjoyed the 4 which came with the sampler, but a few others in the group ordered additional flavors and all of them left me wanting more.

I will now make Banger Brewing on of my typical stops on my frequent Fremont Street outings!

Wow. What a trip. The quintessential ladies who lunch spot. I thought for sure I'd see June Cleaver here. These women shop and lunch for sport. I'm sure they lettered it in back in the day. A lovely shaded and flowered patio full of wine swilling dames, swapping stories of infedility, recipes gone bad and where to go for botox. These are things I actually eavesdropped, er, um overheard. I had some delicous rolls before the famous strawberry salad. Salad? Hmmm. Pretty damn good. And in the if you can't beat 'em join 'em category. I had a split of Pop. A French champagne served with a straw. Yes people. A straw. Makes the bubbles fizzier and the buzz quicker. Highly recommended. A great place to take mom, granny or your favorite tranny.

Loved this! How many offices would you actually take a tour of?

Say what you want about the Downtown Project, Zappos itself is a company I would love to work for. If you have ever (or are currently) working in a shite office for a company that makes you feel like you're just a statistic, than you should check out the culture here at Zappos. From the tour alone, I learned about the transparent corporate ladder, saw open workstations, casual dress, Batista's, free food, supplemented food, 'quiet floors', outdoor areas and a life coach. A LIFE COACH. If that's not caring, I'm not sure what is. 

Seriously, check this place out. It's really great to see a company investing in its own employees once in a while.

My favorite signs at TOPH:
*Please turn cell phones off while dining at TOPH! (annoyed by and enjoyed by this sign)
* No oatmeal during summer! (WTF! LOL!)
* This room dedicated to my friend Stanley (the back room had a plaque...Stanley who? Kubrik? Roper? Steemer?...the mystery remains...)
Retro diner meets whimsical, artsy cafe. The front room has a counter complete with beehived, geriatric waitresses. Back room, a little more modern with trippy artwork (floating pancakes on a checkered sidewalk...kinda Willie Wonka meets flour...glad I wasn't in my mushroom phase)
We had the most delightful server, very accommodating, friendly and yes...beehived and geriatric. We ordered typical fare like eggs, bacon and such and yes, PANCAKES. The buttermilk pancakes did not disappoint though I do enjoy a slightly crispy edge on my flapjacks. Banana cakes were just sweet enough. Yummy! Prices, however, not so retro but not over the top.
Loved our staycation, loved my cakes, loved the architecture but not loving the $2.50 ATM charge because they don't accept credit or debit cards. Sneaky pancake people!

And if you could slow down when slapping my toppings on those de lish sizzling patties...messy is good, but I eventually just made a salad out of that last burger. Chopped it all up and ate it with a fork. And eventually, my fingers. So Lenny. I think Squiqqy is distracting you. I know you're the Lone Wolf and all, but focus, focus focus.

So I went to this Harkins for the first time recently. I was sure to park illegally in a handicapped spot and to leave my dog in the car. It's not like it's hot out and really how many people in wheelchairs go to the movies...

OK. Sarcasm and current events aside I had big hopes as we strolled into the theatre lobby. Big. Grandiose. Clean. Helpful staff. Then....

I. Entered. The. Theatre.

Gulp. Um. What the heck? Why are there at least a dozen random seats covered with big black garbage bags? I sat on the edge of my seat the entire movie. And not because it was a cliffhanger. I just felt dirty. Not soft porn dirty. Silkwood dirty. 

Just seemed ghetto and reminded me of the skankhole Harkins on Thomas and 36th Street. 

I may stick to red box and my clean sofa at home!

Beautiful show; loved the intimate settling.

Reminds me of O show but the stage is a round circular shape; lot smaller & more intimate feeling making you feel like you're closer to the stage. 

Vivid & passionate colors used throughout this show.

Loved the beautiful flowers that bloom at the end of the show.

Highly recommend this show; this is one of the better Cirque Soleil shows in Vegas. =)

FYI, you can buy discounted tickets on day of the show at Tix4Tonight but you have to go in person to buy them; they have plenty of booths & locations within casinos so don't worry.

I used to live on Long Island, so I know a little bit about bagels. This was good, but it wasn't a classic Brooklyn bagel. Maybe it's the water here in the Charlotte area? It was still a good bagel, toasted with some scallion cream cheese.

The coffee was good too.

Nice that they have a free wifi. Comfortable seating area, maybe a nice place to chill with a laptop for a bit.

My only complaint is that when the gal asked me for the combo, it looked like it's supposed to come with a couple of mini-muffins. No biggie - I don't need that many more carbs!

2012 CES - Consumer Electronics Show
Flew here and experienced the exhibit on the company dime, woohoo!

Pros
- Large exhibits from the large electronic companies that showcase their new and upcoming gadgets that numerous tech news publishers stalk/cover endlessly.
- Most of the electronics reps will thoroughly explain the specs, although your geek questions may oust some of their knowledge, they still try their absolute best w/out sounding sales pitchy
- Free sh-wag
- Some exhibits even go out and display their own hot models, live spinning DJs, and/or open bar
- Some celebrity sightings from time to time to endorse a product or company: (Example: Snooki and Dennis Rodman)

Cons
- Expect to stand around the Convention Center after the exhibit for a while, traffic + a huge rush to get home with buses and taxis
- Less swag than last year (so I hear)

Tip: It doesn't matter if you're going for a business meeting, wear comfortable shoes or you will die.. yes, DIE.

It's definitely an expo you need to experience if you are into tech gadgets!
Also, if you now perceive me as a nerd, I am not.

They had a BABY JESUS pencil topper set!!! OMG, I think I died and went to heaven. 

Plus they had a photo booth and pirate cupcake wrappers, and oh yeah, they had candy. I found it to be a novelty store that happened to sell candy and other eccentric knick knacks. But whoa, what a bunch of poor reviews I see here. I found Smeeks to be a delight. The scene on a Saturday afternoon was kind of a mob scene -- about a dozen or so people kind of crowded the place.

I spent $5 on my Baby Jesus pencil toppers and found prices on other things to be just right -- it's an independent local business selling specialty goods, people.

So go ahead -- spend your money at another chain to save a buck, kwitcherbitchin and move to Buckeye. Thank you. The End.

Awesome hotel if you're here for the convention center; not-so-awesome if you're here for everything else! With that being said, it's off-strip and by the north end of the strip. The plus to this location is that it's a pretty short cab ride to the Wynn/Encore.

Most of the time, you can get a room here dirt-cheap through one of those last-minute booking apps/sites unless there's a convention going on. I've gotten a room for $31/nt. Dude, that's cheaper than a janky motel to handle yo business!

The rooms are decent if you're just looking for a place to crash out and shower. It can get pretty lonely here.

The highlight of my weekend in Vegas was GBDC. 

Confetti blasting, smoke, crazy dance music, costumes,  funky sunglasses, beer bongs, drinks overflowing in cups, pinatas,whistles blowing, dancing on tables, and tons of beautiful people of course. 

It started off pretty slow but once alcohol was set in motion the place went cray cray!! I was on a guest list and girls received free two free drink tickets which was NICE. I spent the entire afternoon on the dance floor getting day drunk and enjoying the view of Vegas from the 55th floor. The view was even better with my beer goggles on! :)

Again, upon Adam Richman's heels...  

As a continued fan of "Man vs Food" and after having bookmarked a few of Adam's noted, Phoenician eateries--Chompie's, Alice Cooper'stown, and Los Reyes de la Torta--I saddled up, traversed over 350 sun-scorched miles, and with extreme prejudice negotiated terms of surrender with a literal powerhouse of a Mexican sandwich--one piled high, layered thick, and respectfully ordained "Del Rey."

Muy delicioso!  Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, hot dogs, omelet, chorizo, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce: all hail the King!  Ok, it's true, I may be a bit biased--after all, who am I to contradict Adam?--but unwavering confidence and grandeur shoulder this reigning torta.  My job, put simply: tossing confetti.  How am I doing?  =]

The rundown:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KjOMCauQYI.  (By the way, I visited the West Indian School Rd. location, while Adam opted northward to Sunnyslope's haunt on North 7th St.)

What was even better was being treated like kings, ourselves, while we were there.  We really were.  The service was supreme!  My only regret was not taking a picture of the Elvis statue in the window!  Yes, the King himself.  But I'll get it next time.  Trust me.

Adam...lead on!

Never Again!

This was a place that we made a point of going to every time we were in Vegas, as we've always enjoyed their tapas and blood orange mojitos.  Then we ate there on 4/23/12 and were among the 200+ people impacted by salmonella poisoning due to the fact that these morons don't know how to store food, prep food and wash their hands (see the 5 page, 44 point violation report filed by the Southern Nevada Health District).

As to the other reviewers saying that it is closed for renovations, they are misinformed.  This place was not closed for "renovations".  It was closed for making over 200 people violently ill.  If they do reopen (and I seriously hope they don't), avoid this place at all costs.  The violations show a complete lack of control from management and this place does not deserve your business.  There are way too many great places to eat in Vegas that actually know how to properly store meat.

Thanks for the week of vomiting, dehydration and pissing out of my a** Firefly!

Raw Fitness is not the cheapest place around by any means.  If however, you're looking for intense Cross-Fit / TRX / Boot-Camp kick your ass into shape and then quite a bit beyond just for good measure, then stop by and see what RF has to offer.

The spacious facility is one of the larger and cleaner facilities I have come across in Vegas.  The staff is incredibly friendly and motivating.  A whole-self approach is taken at RF that is more about lifestyle living than it is about an exercise program.  RF is a serious place for dedicated individuals (or those desiring to be dedicated to something) to work hard and push themselves.  The facility is about the training and void of a studio feel with pleasant showers and amenities...this is where you come to train, period!  

Additionally, some cool incentives are offered to individuals that reach their goals!  Goals are tough, but rewards are high.  Finally, they have a great heart for the community.  I first came into contact with RF by way of a yoga benefit that they were hosting, and applaud them for their genuineness and desire to help those in those around them.

Let it be known... flash mobs are not allowed at Scottsdale Fashion Square.  I learned this the hard way and I am no longer allowed to set foot in my go-to shopping mall for the next year.

Despite the "no flash mob" rule, I've been a loyal customer for years.  SFS is a shopper's paradise.  It has pretty much everything you might be looking for from Nordstrom, Neiman's and Macy's to Crate and Barrel, Banana Republic, Anthropology, Hugo Boss, Tiffany, etc... They also have a movie theater and food court and lots of other restaurants to choose from including Z' Tejas, Fred's at Barney's, Modern Steak / Modern Burger, Grand Luxe, and more.

356 days left until I can set foot in Scottsdale Fashion Square again... until then, I'll be spending my $$ at local boutiques, the Biltmore Fashion Park, Scottsdale Quarter, and Kierland Commons.

Feel free to PM me for a link to the aforementioned flash mob if you haven't seen it yet... and happy shopping!

Next month, I'll be crossing off the 49th state to enter the Union. Alaska, doncha know? And because my friends are planning on taking me to see the Northern Lights, it's gonna be seriously cold. Like 20 below if I'm lucky. So I need gear. Where else to go but Bass Pro for their huge selection and reasonable prices?

I managed to find some inexpensive boots and socks that will keep my feet warm, a good hat to keep my head and face toasty, and a few other odds and ends that should be good for the Arctic weather I am expecting.

Bass Pro also has tons of other goodies, like hunting and fishing equipment, camping gear, exercise wear and of course, everyone's looking for their Duck Dynasty goodies. Here's the place for all of it and more. Need an ATV or an outboard motor? How's about a kayak or a tent? Yep, Bass Pro has it.

A hands down must see attraction. The first time I saw it in 2006 they played My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion. It was so beautiful I almost cried! The strip side offers the best views in my opinion. 

The fountains are set in a 9 acre manmade lake.  They incorporate a network of pipes with more than 1,200 nozzles that make it possible to stage fountain displays coordinated with more than 4,500 lights. It is estimated that the fountains cost $75 million to build. The fountains were created by WET, a design firm specializing in inventive fountains and architectural water features.

Here are the fountain show times: 

Monday - Friday 
3:00 PM. - 8:00 PM. 
show every 1/2 hour 
8:00 PM. - 12:00 AM. 
show every 15 minutes 

Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays 
12:00 PM. - 8:00 PM.

So they are not the sexiest macarons but what they lack in beauty they make up for in sheer macaron goodness!  The "cookies" exude freshness with their thin, crisp shell surrounding a just moist center.  The gentle caress of almond accentuates every flavor of not too sweet filling.  The nut flavors are outstanding but for $1 each, indulge in them all!

True Parisian style breads (great crust, great chew).  Tearing lustfully into a baguette with your bare hands, smelling it then enjoying its flavor with a glass of wine is hard to beat.

Outstanding croissants.  Flaky, not to buttery, with the perfect kiss of sweetness and saltiness.  Eating them naked is the only way to go. (You guys know what I mean - plain croissants).

Great looking shop.  Friendly and passionate service.  

If this small sampling is any indication, tout est bon!

Even though this would pretty much be a one and done for anyone living in Las Vegas, I highly recommend checking out the Neon Museum.  Having the lights on definitely added awesome effect to the signs for the 7:30pm tour.  My wife and I both agreed this was much better to see at night.

Our tour guide, April, was chockful of great information.  She really enhanced what would have been a 10-15 minute walkthrough sans guide to an hour tour full of history and fun stories.  That alone made it well worth the locals admission of $22.  Some of my favorite signs included Sassy Sally's, the humungous Treasure Island skull, the H tile board of the Horseshoe and the creepy at night looking Jackpot Motel sign.

I can just imagine all the hardships that those fabled explorers Lewis & Clark had to endure as they explored the unchartered West of the USA from 1804 to 1806. Harsh weather conditions and long hunting expeditions in search of food.

In my quest for sustenance today I ventured out to the local KFC to bag some chicken. It was like watching a movie scene in slow motion as it took probably close to 10 minutes before I received my food. Yeah, we've come a long way since 1806 where they could only wish to even capture any food within 10 minutes. In addition, I guess since the outdoor air temperature is only 89 they didn't feel like it was worthy to turn on the air conditioning. There was no air flow with fans, it was stifling in the restaurant.

Now the food did taste great but there is plenty of room left to improve the customer service and ambience of this place.

WAY WAY WAY too crowded, lame layout, a hassle getting in, employees with attitude on power trips, expensive drinks even for Vegas, plus a TON of people got their phones and wallets stolen out of their purses (while they were holding them on the dance floor!) the night I was there and I see from other reviews that it wasn't an isolated incident! Too bad because I'm a fan of several of the DJs that are currently residents there. 

I won't be going back and I suggest you stay away as well.

Arrogant Butcher. Arrogant Bastard. Arrogant Butthole. I don't care what the name is, I had a really great time here. Finding it, however, was laughable. This whole Cityscape thing is a big FAIL to me so far. Why they didn't choose to build an open aired mall like Kierland Commons is so Bed Bath and Beyond me. The signage is horrible. The curb appeal is non existent. 

But when we finally turned the corner and saw the big A, the sidewalk was bustling with guests and the inside was energetic, fun and most appealing. 

I had great service. Thank you Winston! The pretzel fondue was fabulous! The scallops with bacon and beans was okay. Not exactly executed as I would have liked. And the crab stuffed chicken was actually quite bland. 

But I washed it all down with a beautiful, buttery bottle of Carneros Chardonnay and all in all a good time was had. 

Arrogant? Perhaps. But certainly Insecure Butcher wouldn't work. So it's a winner so far to me and I will most definitely return.

I really hate to give out my annual award for "Best Response From a Business Owner" this early in the year, but I really do think I've found a winner. Here's most of the message I got in my Yelp inbox from Melody H. about my experience:

"Hi Catherine, I remember when you came in and your horrible attitude. I cannot believe you would be so stupid and make-up lies as you did here. I thought to myself when you came in and spoke with me that you were strange. I just had one thing to say after you left and I told the girls there is only so much lip stick you can put on a PIG!"

It's just pure awesomesauce covered with cherries on top! Congrats to Melody H.--you are truly one in a million (and I mean that in the worst way possible, heh).

My fave club to go 2 in Vegas =)

Beautiful people, beautiful club & great DJs =)

Big dance floor which opens up to the outside pool area so it's not stuffy/ stinky of cigarette smells. =)

There are guest lists, you just need to know a promoter & you'll get in free =)

Delicious burgers, great service, what else can you ask for??? Prices are fair, it's located on the corner of broadway and Lindsay tucked away in between a subway and a massage parlor. 

Thought I already reviewed this place before but here it goes...

I ordered a double cheeseburger w/ onions, jalapeos and bacon. Delish! Everything worked together in a symphony of flavor. The meat to bun ratio was perfect, and the fries were crisp and fresh. My daughters got a hotdog each and both finished theirs in record time! Hubby got a plain double cheeseburger and he loves the charbroiled flavor. We called in our order and it was ready in 10 mins and no mistakes on our order. Thumbs up!!

Prepare for a shift in perspective...

Too many times, Mexican food is rather typical.  In fact it's likely that, with few variances and exceptions, predictions prevail.  Not that Mexican food isn't super tasty, because it is.  It's just that it isn't usually served with much explosive flair or out-of-the-box creativity.  (I mean, we've all come to know what to expect.)  That is until you've visited the Barrio Caf.

When here, forget what you've known, what you've grown up with.

At the Barrio, Chef Silvana's sophistication and assertiveness with the culinary traditions of Mexican cuisine challenges any and all notions of south-of-the-border authenticity.  Imagine: apples, pears, dried apricots and pecans nesting harmoniously amidst savory chicken, enveloped in a roasted poblano pepper and finished with a light almond sauce, the colors of the Mexican flag (cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds) artfully decorating the myriad of flavors...

"Chiles en Nogada," as explored by Guy Fieri's "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives," is the signature dish that brought me to the artistry of the Barrio.  And it is also the "Chiles en Nogada" that has forever now changed what I thought Mexican cuisine could actually be.  Chef Silvana certainly has an eye for presentation.  To visit Barrio Caf is to appreciate that vision.

At 10:30pm i was craving this : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=t-ZAZpB7Uu2tdh_Wl2VRuA
Creme Brulee Gelato. They close at 11pm, so from Paris hotel, we hauled ass to Bellagio to get my fix. The alluring sight of the chocolate fountain art was still accompanied by a line of people ordering last minute crepes and cakes. Ordered my gelato in a waffle cone, and about 8 bucks later, i was a happy MT.  If i stayed at the Bellagio or Aria, i know i would have a dozen check ins stocking up on breakfast pastries, chocolate snacks and late night desserts! Danger!

Used Creative moving about a month ago. What a great, family-run business. The guys were on time, courteous, and professional. They don't drag their feet - their goal is to get the job done right and as efficiently as possible. As a matter of fact, they came in UNDER the estimate! Not one broken item in the whole move. They carefully wrapped and padded our furniture, and took great care to avoid dinging walls, etc.
Would use Creative again in a heartbeat, and will be recommending them to everyone we know. Could not be more pleased after you hear so many negative things about other movers.

Oh no!  I only just saw that they closed down when I decided to post long overdue pictures of one of my favorite treat spots on The Strip!

At least I still have a super cutesy apron from this place to remember them by.  My favorite cupcake of theirs was the Kir Royal.  It was described as a moist raspberry cake with bubble champagne buttercream.  Every cupcake I have ever gotten from them was moist and airy.  The buttercream can get a tad on the sweeter side but it's nothing you can't fix by removing some of it off.  This place loved using the edible glitter as well.  

Oh well.  I'll keep warm and fuzzy memories of The Cupcakery in my thoughts.  Farewell, old friend!

Whenever I'm craving that bean water when I'm visiting my parents, It's A Grind is the place to go --- mainly because it's the closest coffee shop by their house!

I've only had their Nutty Cow with soy, the Caramel Macchiato with soy, and this hot spiced cider drink they serve around the holidays.  It's A Grind always brings warm fuzzy memories of grabbing cider with my older brothers on Christmas morning.  I feel for the baristas who work on Christmas, seriously.

The atmosphere at this coffee shop is casual and low-key.  Think Starbucks but with less wannabe hipsters and more zombie-like adults trying to get through the day.  They have stacks of newspaper for you to borrow to read, plenty of outlets for your electronics, and a wide selection of biscottis for purchase to dunk into your drinks.  They're not stingy with the A/C, they don't mind if you sit around for a couple of hours, and the music ain't bad.  Two thumbs up for It's A Grind!

Four stars with a caveat, DO NOT ACTUALLY GO TO THE RESTURAUNT,---ONLY ORDER BY PHONE!  

Inside is way nasty, it's old, kinda dirty, with an old man sleeping in a chair in the next room, etc. etc.

Food was very fresh, full of vegetables and the chicken and shrimp were both better than PF Changs, IMHO.  I'll order by phone next time and forget that I ever went inside that place.

Quality ramen with a twist.  A newcomer to the ramen scene.  This time on the East side.  Ain't nothing wrong with that.

Noodles - hardly seasoned but chewy.  Check.
Chashu - tender porky goodness.  Check.
Salt, soy, miso, spicy broths.  Check, check, check, check.
Ramen that showcases it all - very flavorful "Fukumimi" (tonkotsu topped with everything).  Check.

So what sets it apart from the big boys, Sora and Monta?  Tantan Men; a simple, almost naked bowl of noodles swimming in an exceptional spicy sesame broth.   The broth is so intense, you can't see the noodles through its mustard yellow liquid.  Tender baby bok choi breaks the one dimensional texture.  Thanks you Godzilla X for bringing this elixir to my attention. 

PC Tip:  While manners dictate you should drink all the ramen broth,  those with a weak constitution or first time connoisseurs should make an exception for very rich and spicy tantan men.   Just sayin.

Excellent chicken karaage (crisp with the hint of ginger flavor).  Good curry rice (strong with bits of tender pork).  NO GYOZA.  NO TONKATSU.

A very worthy addition to Vegas' ramen scene.

This review based on my experience in their gas station, this one only got like four or five gas dispenser.  That is like half compare what I used to in other location.  This reason is probably why there is very long line when we came here. The other problem, there were only one gas dispenser in the line.  Seriously, they need to add more dispenser.  This is one of the cheapest gas station near the strip is probably another factor why is so crowded, having less dispenser is not helping at all.

Late November...
The desert air, crisp and clean on a Sunday morning,
And I'm surrounded.
Surrounded by multiple games upon multiple screens,
Lions and Pats, Cards and Hawks.
Friends of old sitting across from one another, stories--once told,
Now again and again--flung casually about, bouncing
Here and there and here and there...
The fireplace aglow, and another on-tap round,
Orange-slice garnishings.
Cheers were in order, and the Verrado Grille,
Also relaxing in the mid-morning sun and welcoming any and all
Who have the luxury of lazy, weekend afternoons,
Hosted.

Here, you recline.

And at noontime sharp,
Our Happy Hour,
Suggestions, recommendations, libations...
Fives and sixes, listed mixes,
And fondues and sliders
And caesars and ritas.
Truffles and pretzels, wings, quesadillas...
Verrado Grille makes your stay easy.
The game's not over, however.
So stay awhile.
Enjoy
The moment and the
Smiles
Surrounding
You.

Hands down best dim sum in the Valley. I've taken different groups of friends here on EVERY Sunday in the past two months, skipping only Easter, and have eaten like it's my last meal on Earth every time. All of my friends including Alex loved it and agree that it's the best dim sum in town right now. It's totally worth it even with the long drive from North Scottsdale and ridiculous weekend highway closures. Looks like I might be there again next Sunday...

Chandler Fashion is a nice upscale Mall and one of the best in the greater Phoenix area,

We've been coming here for over five years, longer if you count before we moved to the Valley. It's your typical double decker setup, with the usual anchors like Macy's, Sears, Dillard's, Nordstrom and Barnes & Nobles built in a semicircle.

In many ways, we like Chandler Fashion over the one in Scottsdale with the same name. Scottsdale Fashion has been built-out, piece meal and can be crazy busy at times.  The developer of both is Westcor, a sub of giant real estate holding company Macerich. 
 
Here the movie theater setup makes more sense. It's outside and has a group of restaurants attached to it. So you can stop and eat, before or after your movie. Also, because it's located it's easier getting in and out without the necessity of walking through the Mall.  Nice!

Enjoy the shopping.

OK. Just so you know. When they arrive at your door with your ice, they've already heard "OH!. THE ICEMAN COMETH"! Or "OH, IT'S SO nICEEEEE TO SEE YOU"! Or "ICE ICE BABY ICE ICE BABY"! Hey, I'm just looking out for ya. I have to say, AZ Iceman has saved my icey ass on more than one occassion. Usually the ice machine next to my office is so loud producing cubes I fear a major hail storm has moved in and nobody has alerted me. Lately. Not so much. She's a tempermental one, that ice machine. So a call to AZ Iceman yields an always polite employee who quickly dispatches the Iceman. Soon my cocktails, teas and sodas are fizzy, happy and cold once again. Like Liza Minelli on her wedding night. I don't know what kinda deal you would get, but I shelled out around $70 for 400 pounds of ice. Yes. You heard me. Four hundred pounds. It's like having Carney Wilson delivered, only in the form of ice cubes. I c u soon.

This Las Vegas buffet is permeated with familiar comfort foods prepared in the freshest manner exploiting the finest ingredients. With more than 500+ dishes to choose from daily, every guest is sure to satiate their immense craving at Bacchanal, whether it's one for prime rib, chilled king crab legs that are already cut for you, grilled lamb chop, made to order tacos, and baked-to-order pastries. 

It represented the decadence of a Roman feast set within a fine dining atmosphere. Super chic environment with Sparta theme surrounded by the Greek goddesses or Roman emperors for a huge feast. I've been to Wicked Spoon, The Carnival Buffet, Wynn Buffet, and many others in Las Vegas. This one didn't impress me to an extend. I had super high expectation but it didn't exceed it. I guess all the hype isn't just a bluff. I will have to pass on this one but this deserves 4 stars.

Ok. So they're not organic. Not green. They don't take competitors coupons. And, OMG, yes, they are located in a strip mall. Thankfully it's right right down from my beloved A.J.'s. This is a dry cleaner that does it right. My previous dry cleaner ruined two shirts and did nothing to correct the errors. So High Society Cleaners, er, um, wait, I guess it's just Society Cleaners, but whatever, is the real deal. Prices are right. Oh. Oh. I forgot the most important part. The lovely young lady who's always helped me actually has a smile and a warm greeting. Yea. She must be new as the chemicals have yet to permeate her skull and make her rude, scowly and unattractive. Sorry. Just a dig at the last cleaners. Those bitches. RIP my two fave Michael Kors blouses! OMG I said blouses. I promise not to say moist or slacks. UGH! HA!

Ahhhh....Jenny's. Good ole Jenny's. Gay as gay can be. Depending on when you are there of course. I've found myself at Jenny's post bar rush stuffing my pie hole with a club sandwich, fries and many glasses of Coca Cola. 

Then there's the late morning, early afternoon call from friends who want to gather at Jenny's, eat greasy food to soak up the previous evening's booze and dish about who fell down, who got arrested and who will end up on dirty.com! Of course, we all secretly hope it is us!

I love diner waitresses. They get it. They have the patience of a saint and the sass and swagger of a sailor. All the while delivering my hot plate of eggs, shredded hash browns (can you say Ore Ida!?), various meats and extra butter on the toast please. God bless 'em. God bless them all! 

So Jenny's has a place in our hearts. Not on Valentine's Day. Not on the books for New Year's Eve. But, dayum, if I'm not grateful to have you Jenny on that famous CenPho corner, we call 7th Street and Camelback.

My wife had a grilled hot dog and sweet potato fries while I had a Chicago Hot Dog, waffle fries and a soda all for $21.91.

The food was good, but I was shocked by the cost of our lunch. I guess those prices might stick when the captive movie going crowd is looking for a quick bite before the movie but this local knows where there's a better bang for the buck at some other eateries in the area.

Sometimes we forget that our reviews directly effect those businesses.

I'm not suggesting that we should go soft, but in coming here I found a small Mom & Pop setup that is still trying to find their way.  This Food Court is new, and there are only three options as of this writting.  To say that Villa Italian Kitchen is not as good as Sbarro is an understatement. I'm not a big fan of watching employees microwave food to be served.

But in watching them closely, you could see they were on a steep learning curve and should be cut some slack.  Well, at least I have for now.  Until next time then.

Last night's Carrot Top show had to be the most hilarious comedy performance I've attended in many years.  I never thought I was a fan of his until last night.  Some of his stage props are goofy and some just left me puzzled, but most of them were just downright funny.  He made good use of the video board behind him to accentuate a number of his jokes and the sound props were all right on.

As expected there were jokes and props about sleeping pilots, Tiger Woods and the big rodeo happening right now in Vegas.  Whenever a string of jokes failed Carrot Top went right back to the cock ring jokes to reel the crowd back in.  If you have two hours to spare check out Carrot Top's show at the Luxor.  The show is dark on Tuesdays so if that's the case stand in front of a mirror and make fun of yourself.  It seems like that approach has worked for Carrot Top.

I'd like to personally shake Mr Tofu's hand.  While I cannot medically prove it, I am 100% certain that their soondubu contains undefined healing properties.  Some how some way, I always feel better after a meal here.  

Got a cold?  Screw the Nyquil and get the spicy kimchi soondubu.

Bad day at work?  Beef soondubu=good f'n day

Broken leg?  Just splash a little pork soondubu broth on your leg and it'll probably heal instantly.  

Venereal disease?  Wait a couple of minutes before pouring it all over your crotch since it comes out piping hot.  Don't want to scare the other customers with your screaming.  Perhaps the seafood soondubu would be best for this.    

At $8 a bowl, even my wallet feels better!

Really amazing fish entrees, and the fish tour was a nice touch (ask for it!). I also thought the lamb chops and grilled octopus were delicious too. Our group was on a bit of a tight schedule and the staff was in tune with that (though due to timing of our entrees we were eating right down to the wire). Only complaint was the restaurant was filled with light smoke by the end of our dinner, not sure the root cause but hopefully that's not a regular occurrence.

I'm a fan of Arby's because I enjoy their Reuben Sandwich and their Turkey Sandwich. It's a chill place with just the right A/C setting. I usually catch up on my reading during lunch so this place ticks all the right boxes in that regard.

My major gripe about this Arby's is in their haste to always upsell you they charge you more than what you order. I upgrade my drink size but it doesn't mean I want their gigantic curly fries. I finally had to read the riot act today and spell it out for them. Many years ago you would get a print out receipt of every item you ordered. These days you get the total you were charged on your credit card but you don't have any idea if you were charged correctly on each item.

So even though I still like you Arby's, I'm not ringing that bell.

Okay, so I'm realllyyyyy freaking picky when it comes to my wings. I don't do Hooters wings. I don't do Buffalo Wild Wings. I don't do Pizza Hut wings. I think I've only had one dozen wings that I went kind of nuts over... and that was yesterday at Long Wong's.

Luckily, one of my girlfriends knew how ridiculous I am when it comes to wings but insisted we check this place out. Ghetto area. The girl at the counter wore black lipliner. The customers looked like they just got out of prison...

HOWEVER! The wings were out of this world. Saucy, full of flavor, and cheap. Extra veggies, extra ranch... no charge. We ate so many wings + chili cheese fries, and I felt like a heffer when we were done. SUCCESS!

This is a nice Three Star, Mexican themed watering hole. 

Many of my SoCal/LA friends might know Antonio's on Melrose. It's the only other Mexican restaurant I know that has a tee shirt concession stand inside the restaurant. LOL. 

But the similarities end there, since Antonio's is an LA institution, long before being featured on Entourage btw. 

Here it's just simple Americanized Mexican food, with large goblets of Margaritas, much along the lines of a ChiChi's or El Torito's. We came in after passing it many times and enjoyed ourselves. 

Expect to pay around $25 each, including drinks, taxes and gratuities. It may not be a gourmet place, but this gourmand enjoyed it.  

So Three Stars, "A-Okay".

I stayed here with my friend while we were attending a convention down at the Phoenix Convention Center.  Staying on the 16th floor with a downtown view after a long day at the convention was Heaven.  The beds are soft, the rooms are quiet and spacious, and the wifi is free.  Although we had to pay for parking, it's no different than paying to park by the convention center.  It pretty much evens out.  

The scenic elevator was that of Los Angeles' The Westin Bonaventure.  You get a view of the hotel lobby and atrium before it shoots through the roof and you get a view of the great outdoors.  The lobby is decorated nicely and check-in/check-out is speedy and friendly.  There are a lot of eateries at the hotel and nearby so options are plenty.  

Most importantly:  There's a Starbucks nearby.  Huzzah!  It makes convention time go by more smoothly and makes me a happy camper.

I always try to keep my fitness in gear when traveling on biz.

Vegas with all it's sinful temptations of food and drink can ruin it for me so I always try and hit up a casino gym while staying there. The Grand Spa at MGM was a decent little gym with some nice equipment. Very well kept, plenty of cardio, and a good line of machines, dumbells, and some cable equipment. Also on hand are complimentary bottles of water, fruit, and assorted Nature Valley granola bars. 

Hours: 6:00am - 7:00pm Monday - Thursday, 6:00am - 8:00pm Friday - Sunday

Overall, nice gym for a casino with plenty of equipment. $10 a day gym only fee is a deal.

Tix 4 Tonight is a must for those wanting to catch impressive discounts on shows, attractions & meals.  Customers can save up to 50% off the premium pricing that Las Vegas attractions demand.  I utilized Tix 4 Tonight to purchase vouchers to Beatles Love, Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, Donny & Marie and Flavors buffet at Harrah's.  Once I acquired said vouchers, I just had to go to the box office of the particular show to secure my tickets.  Let me tell you, I scored primo seats for Beatles Love and Donny & Marie.  For Beatles Love, the show is in the round, so good seating is available throughout.  The only catch with Tix 4 Tonight is vouchers can only be obtained either the day of or the day before, since it's a discounter that's attempting to sell unsold tickets.  If you want to make sure you secure tix to a show or you want the very best seats, then I suggest buying them ahead of time through the box office or vegas.com.  However, if you're looking for something to do in Vegas, then I highly recommend visiting one of the many Tix 4 Tonight locations located on the Strip.

After seeing the touring production of Jersey Boys once or twice (or a lot of times), it was a must-do on a recent trip to Vegas.  

Of course the show revolves around the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.  You get the full biography of how the band came together, and the ups and downs that went along with the group through the years.  The story is told both through narrative and song, making for an entertaining and interactive experience.

Although Frankie is the star, the real driver of the story is Tommy DeVito, played brilliantly by Deven May.  You'll have to see the show for yourself to see why he's truly the lead character.  No spoilers here.

The show is currently being held at Paris, and the theater and lobby area are both spacious and comfortable.  So even if you don't think you're a Frankie Valli fan (didn't think I was the first time I went), it's definitely worth seeing.

Located footsteps from the strip, this hotel is the perfect location for anyone looking to be in the center of everything you would want to see and do in Vegas. 

Luckily my friend was offered an upgrade to the Presidential Suite. With a grand seating area, formal dining room, luxurious bedroom with remote controlled hideaway TV, bath with jacuzzi tub, the suite offered all the amenities to ensure a pleasant and relaxing experience during our three night stay in Sin City.

Rooms were spacious and linens were changed out regularly without a hitch.

I've heard the standard rooms were a bit dated with tube TVs and in dire need of a renovation, but if you can land a suite or higher, I think the stay here is well worth it.

Good lunch option for Vegas! 

We started with the Japanese Wagyu Gyoza and all I can say is, wow! This little pockets pack a ton of flavor. I kind of wanted to order another round but I refrained. 

The yellowtail sashimi tiradito was also wonderful. Thick slices of fish came in a bed of lemongrass and jalapeno sauce. 

The let down were the rolls. We ordered the green envy and the lima and both were a little weird. I'd say avoid the rolls. The flavors were just off and coming from LA where you can find fantastic rolls at many places, I wouldn't order rolls at Sushi Samba again. 

The place was packed so service was a bit spotty, but I'd come back again and stick to the tiraditos and gyoza.

Useless, overpriced GARBAGE!  

 I came in really wanting to buy something, but as I looked around the store and picked up the items, they looked very cheesy and poorly made for the amount of money they were charging.  Novelty items and ugly cheaply made clothing alike.  $100 for a clutch, and when I opened it, the magnetic clasp seemed flimsy and ready to fall off.  It was hilarious.   

But what can I expect,   trash in exchange for money -- that's who the Kardahsian's are anyway, right?? Lol. 

Another thing that I will have to concur with another reviewer.  I did notice that they were selective about who they gave their Kardashian shopping bags to.  If they don't like how you look or don't think you fit into who they're trying to market their store to by carrying their bags, then no Kardashian shopping bag for you, you get a Mirage bag.  They'll gladly take your money, but they don't want you associated with shopping at their store.

I say pass this store.  You'd find cuter, better quality items at the flea market.  And you won't be discriminated against and denied a shopping bag.

You would think the highlight of my recent Arizona vacation would be spending hours by the fabulous Clarendon Hotel & Spa pool. Or the complimentary foot massage. Or even taking my traveling mates to their first drag show.

Nope.
 
Pinots Palette stole that thunder! What a FUN evening...We brought wine, chocolate and our smiling Minnesota faces and couldn't have had a better time.

The staff is Bed, Bath & Beyond friendly, outgoing and really good dancers. Yep. Drinking wine and painting does lead to dancing!  

They supply you with everything you could possibly need from art supplies to wine glasses to music! And dancing. Did I mention the dancing?!

So brush up on your artistic talents, call your buddies and head to Pinots Palette and paint the town red!

Shhh! Don't let on to the locals here that you're from outta town. Oh, and definitely don't mention you're from SoCal. Oh...and especially don't burst their bubble by letting it slip that there's a Griffin in LA too. 

Now that you've been warned - have yourself a fabulous, hipstery time with some local Vegas folks. And talk about stiff drinks! Holy moly. I got a vodka and soda...that thing had so little carbonation I could count the bubbles from the teensy splash of soda poured into my glass of vodka. Oh, good times indeed.

Now, I'm not too sure what the gay bar scene is like in Vegas, but if you're in the market for a hipster, 21-30 gay guy or gal, most-likely wearing some ridiculous eyewear...well, you're likely to find your soulmate at The Griffin. Plus, a kickass jukebox and a lounge in the back for even more dancing. 

Oh wait! One more warning for outta-towners...you know that I love me some dive bars, but I totally forgot that a dive in Vegas would be filled with smokey smoke smoke. So grab that gasmask and hide your California license and prepare to have one helluva night.

So what if this place is closed... I do miss it. I always enjoy being up close and next to dangerous beasts... I mean look at my friends and enemies... Hell perhaps they are frenemies...  but yeah back to the subject at hand...

I have never seen these lions ever move from a sleeping position out of having seen them like 15+ times. I think the exhibit was closed years before but no one told anyone anything and the lions were mummified by the dry desert air... purportedly they did move now and then at feeding time... or were there strings attached... did anyone see if someone was working a marionette inside the cage?

None the less I do miss gazing upon these magnificent beasts. I do love big cats quite a bit so I am sad that they removed them. However I am happy to be out of the danger zone at the same time... perhaps someday they will return to the Metro Goldwyn Meyer casino...

I got waxed!

And it was fantastic!

I've been having an inclination to head out to LA to visit Grauman's Chinese Theater & Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum for awhile now.  While in Vegas, we had time to kill so we decided to check out Madame Tussaud's Las Vegas.  I used Tix4Tonight to purchase ticket vouchers for $18/piece, saving myself cash money, which is hard to do when you're in Vegas.  Here's the lowdown-

I had such a good time!  The resemblance of the wax figures to their real-life counterparts vary from spot-on to roughly vague.  Here, posing & touching are encouraged.  Check out my Yelp page for some of the pics I took.  Some I didn't post were a bit on the raunchy side (Fergie & Jenna Jameson, I apologize for my actions that day).  I'm not interested in Nascar/Indy Car racing, so that wing didn't appeal to me & I didn't check out the Scream Haunted House wing.  There was a plethora of wax figures, some w/ props that patrons can use when posing for the camera.  Celebs vary from Tony Bennett & Dean Martin to Katy Perry & 2pac.  Everyone of all ages should get a kick out of the celebs featured here.  There weren't too many people when I was there, so it felt like I had free run of the place, which I gleefully took advantage of.  

To reiterate, I had a blast visiting Madame Tussaud's Las Vegas.  I look forward to visiting the LA location to see whom they have exhibited there.  I remember the old Hollywood Wax Museum that used to be open in Buena Park, and MT blows that out of the water.  I recommend everyone come by and check out Madame Tussaud's for themselves.  You won't regret it!

Good times!

My favorite chocolate bar from Vosges now comes in dark chocolate!! Yes, you can now get Mo's Bacon Bar in dark chocolate... Applewood smoked bacon + Alder wood smoked salt + 62% dark chocolate. It's scrumptious! 

Vosges is for the adventurous chocolate lover, and definitely for the chocolate lover who isn't afraid to splurge on decadence. The chocolate bars are $7.50-$8.50, and individual truffles are $2.50. 

The staff was rather generous with giving us samples. I practically had a taste of every flavor. I think pretty much all of the exotic ones EXCEPT for the dark chocolate + mushrooms one. That one sounded like something you'd eat before seeing a Cirque show.

YES! I finally got to experience this fabulous show. Being as the Beatles remain my all time favorite band I have been wanting to see this show forever. And i was not disappointed. We had seats in the front row but up on a ledge. I personally think this could have been the best seats in the house. The portray  of the Beatles era was spot on. The dancers were very talented. My favorite set had to be to the song Strawberry Fields Forever. The entire room went red and they had an array of various performers blowing all different types of bubbles. it was visually arousing. There was also an awesome guest interaction they put a huge white sheet over the crowd and pastel colors shown through. I highly recommend seeing this show. Especially if your a Beatles fan.

Man, oh man. You've got game if you shop here. If I were a guy, I would buy my entire wardrobe from Stitched. A combination of classic and contemporary, suiting and street - this is how a man with swag dresses!

The store itself is the ultimate man cave. There's a billiard table in the back, flat screen tvs on ESPN and even a whisky lounge with Macallan scotch lockers to rent. There are also several cool choppers worked into the decor. There's an on-site tailor stitching up sharp suits too, personalized with your name if you'd like. Probably the only thing missing is a cigar bar and hot female cocktail servers.

Price points are really reasonable. A lot of the coats and blazers that I liked were around $250. You'll find ready to wear brands like George Esquivel, Jacks & Jokers, Rag & Bone, Cr8tive Recreation, Louis Stewart and Psycho Bunny.

And girls, the sharp looking men that work here make the visit worthwhile too.

This is the perfect place to wander into after a long night, and all you want is a greasy pizza with the 1 dollar bills you have left in your pocket you purposely created from your $5.00 so you can play more penny slots. Instead of being left with those .16 cents ticket redemption stubs you can't even play, save those dollars to be spent in the rabbit hole- with no directory name or signs, the fun part is trying to find this place!
But i'm not going to spoil your fun by telling you where this place is- but will give u one clue. If u see a pool table, you're warm. So warm, you will be burning the roof of your mouth in 5 minutes biting into that hot cheese. You've been warned.

I've broken up with frozen yogurt.  Boba? Boh-bye.  Haagen Dazs can go fahrvergngen themselves.  This is it!  This is my go to dessert destination in Las Vegas.

There have been so many glowing reviews by a lot of reputable Yelpers that it seems ridiculous that I could add anything else into the mix.  Even though my review of their business when they were known as "Frostybites" expresses my sentiments clearly, I love the Ex-Straw-Binary that much to say it again.

It's probably not the most popular flavor but for some reason, it's the perfect sweet spot for me.  When you combine their shaved strawberry ice with strawberries and then strawberry condensed milk on top of it all, it's like the strongest, sweetest musical note.  

If the Ex-Straw-Binary were a guitar solo, it would be Adrian Vandenberg's solo from the Whitesnake classic "Is This Love".  The tone, the sustain, the subtle power of it all.  I eat it up.  It IS love!!

I do feel a little looney sometimes getting the same thing over and over (I've gotten the pumpkin twice with graham crackers which is a solid 2nd place) but I get over it and get it again.

"Get fcuked up, and eat pizza" - Old Eugine Proverb

Some old Chinese fool tried to jack that shit from me and use it as his own.

I'm going to lay it down on how to get to this place.   Do not deviate from these directions.

-Walk by all the squealing Asian girls coming out of the club that think they're cuter than they actually are.  Actually...thinking they're cute at all is wrong.
-Five steps past the white girls riding the escalator barefoot.  
-Make a right when you see the Latinas showing off their newly acquired neck art ... hickies.
-And when you see an angry black chick....run the other way.  Fcuk the pizza.

Was the pizza really that good?  I don't remember.  My buddy liked it. I guess I did too.  Not as much as the Reyka tonics I was guzzling down at a frantic pace earlier. Evidently I waxed two slices, made it back to the room, and gracefully blacked out.   I woke up in the middle of the night with a shivering case of mud butt.  That means two things:  

1. It was greasy
2. It was good

I do faintly recall burping up pepperoncinis while on the throne.  I love those things.  Both the pepperoncinis and the porcelain La-Z-Boy.

4 gleaming stars might be a bit too generous, but hell, aren't you all generous and shit when you get shitfaced?  

Yeah...thought so.

Good times at the Goodwich! Simple concept here. Just three dudes making 'wiches out of a shack. 'Nuff said. 

My order:
Reuben... Well done! The perfect amount of all ingredients and a crunchy marble rye is always appreciated. Only problems being the meat was a bit fatty and the bread is just soaaaked with butter/grease. Wipe your hands after every bite type grease. No bueno. 

Falafel.... another good, not great 'wich. I liked the patty style delivery of the falafel and the light cucumber and kale slaw were excellent accompaniments.  Again, this was extremely greasy. 

The grease paired with a 17min wait for a pair of sammies drops the ol' 'wich to 4-stars in my book. Still delicious and still worth a visit though. Prob one of the top 5 sandwich joints in vegas, though def not coming close to any of the top 5 from NY, SF or Philly (especially Philly).

Sure, you kids have got your Rain and your Pure and your Snoopy Dog parties, but in keeping with my old lady name, I prefer some of the simple elderly pleasures in life...like bingo. Okay, so maybe I went to keep my mom entertained for a couple of hours...and maybe I've accompanied my mom on many a bingo excursion before, but this was the first to Gold Coast's bingo hall...and I'm more than a fan. 

Picture this hypothetical scenario: you've already withdrawn your $300 for the day, the blackjack tables haven't treated you so well, and you're in dire need of a drink. Hypothetically, of course. Well, for a mere $10 you get unlimited booze (you don't even have to wait for the cocktail gal, you can get your free booze directly from the bar) and the chance to annoy old folks and win a few hundred bucks. 

Sadly, the bad luck wasn't shaken by an afternoon bingo session, but five vodka tonics later...I left there one happy bingo-er.

Last Saturday, I went to Char's Bar
Because it wasn't very far
Riding bitch on a scooter
In a mini skirt barely covering my cooter

This was my first time
Which should've been a crime
Cuz' this place was poppin'
My booty was droppin'
My head be boppin'
Where all the ez katz are flockin'
Drop, pop the collar lockin'
All shades of colors hoppin'
To the beats that be rockin'

$6.00 was the door fee
Stiff drinks? Yes please!
Shots of Patron I was takin'
In hopes of later dirty baby makin'
And even morning breakfast serving bacon?

Only complaint is the restroom
Very slimy, tiny, and grimy

She sang with soul and funk
Nothing dull or bunk
Damn, I'm gettin' drunk!
Singing some James Brown
The crowd was gettin' doowwwnnn
No one with a frown
Up in this Blue's town

I danced and got jiggy
Flirted like Miss Piggy
With all this fun
Under the sun
I was done

But I'll definitely be back
Ready to attack
This place was so cool
Not at all whack

Eyes were closing shut
Baby making, what? What?
Not tonight, don't wanna to fight
Can barely stand with all my might
Losing sight
Gooooooood night!

I am spoiled now and will probably only view future movies at a Galaxy Theater. I don't live close to either one however I find the trek is worth it. The standard ticket cost $11 which is about the same as anywhere else. I usually go to see movies at The Palms which is $10.50 so no big deal. Unless you go to The Palms on a Monday when it is $5, anyhow lol. 

I love the assigned seating, I love the big spacious comfy lazyboy like reclining seats. I mean I was literally like laying down watching the movie! They have big trays where you can put your stuff as well.

The staff is cool, the Theatre is very clean and the sound is Amazing as well.

It was a fun experience and I will be back for sure!

We like Basha's, but only wish we lived closer.

When I worked up at Pinnacle Peak, I was in here at least once a week.  Basha's always seems to have sales on things before the big boys, such as Fry's, Safeway, or Albertson's do.  

I was reminded of this recently, when they were running a Memorial Weekend sale on energy and sports drinks. These were all marked down at least 50% and were exceptional deals.  They even had the Starbucks' DoubleShot drinks marked as 2 for $4.00.  Funny, Safeway had the same deal the following week. But Basha's it should be noted had it first.

The other appeal of Basha's is that they also own upscale grocer AJs.  So when you shop here, you will find that they have many of their in-store brands for a lot less then they are selling at AJs.  

Basha's might not have all the bells and whistles of some of the retailers here in the Valley, but they try hard and do a nice job. I know Basha's may not always be convenient, but their sales make the trip worthwhile.  They are also locally owned, at least for now. So one hundred percent of your shopping dollars stay in Arizona.

The lunch bunch convened on this vegan hotspot to see and be seen... and to try out the bowls.  Imagine my surprise when Linh bucked the system and ordered a vegan bbbq burger with mock bacon.

Had I known that seven minutes later, I would staring longingly at his entree, with his highfalutin thyme fries being the object of my desire, I would have surely placed my order for "ditto" instead of the "diablo red bowl".  Pretty sure J-WoW and her "coconut curry bowl" shared in that sentiment.

The fries are wonderful.  Very thin and crispy, they were reminiscent of succulent pomme frites one might find in a culinary school's student restaurant.  Les frites taient affirmation de la vie!  Oui oui, hon hon!

Knowing Linh won the entree lottery, I put a little more thought into the tSoynami frozen dessert, but that didnt keep Joycie's PB&J treat from walking away with the win, and Linh's Almond Joy non-dairy coming in a close second.  As she took her victory lap, I mused "sometimes you feel like a culinary looser, sometimes you dont".

I'm prepared to dominate on my next foray, because I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!

Tube steaks.  Yes, tube steaks!

Here are some fun facts, or maybe urban legend.  Babe Ruth was reported to have once ate 12 hot dogs & 8 bottles of soda between games of a double header. He was rushed to the hospital after the game.  What a surprise, right?  

Al Capone's favorite food was???  Anyone?  Bueller?   Nathan's Coney Island!  What no Vienna Beef?  Today, Chicago's O'Hare sells more than 2 million hot dogs a year.  Now I am sure these dogs are Vienna Beef!

I bring this up, because about a year ago SONIC decided to broaden their hot dog menu, with four new dogs: All American, Coney Island, Chicago and New York.  This year they've added a 1/4 pound Footlong to their lineup of Tube Steaks.  http://www.sonicdrivein.com/MenuSection/coneys-hot-dogs

Admitted, I haven't been an SONIC aficionado up until now.  But, a "shout out" to my friend Jennifer W and her family, who must be considered the unofficial Queen of SONIC!  How do you stay so thin?

I was willing to give their new menu items a try.  First the bad news, these aren't Nathan's Famous, Hebrew National, or Vienna Beef.  They aren't even Oscar Mayer!  But, for $3.99 for a 1/4 pound footlong hot dog and Tater Tots, they're not bad.  And, a lot better than Der Wienerschnitzel!

BTW, the  World Record for hot dog eating is 68 set by Joey Chestnut at Nathan's Famous in Coney Island.  It was reputed that former Champ, Takeru Kobayashi ate 69 at a nearby location.  Ugh!~

The head  baker here is a bad  mutha--shut yo mouth!!! 
I was referred here by an unnamed source who decided they'd had enough of me and my so called diet and boy was this a diet buster
First off, the thing that impressed me out of nowhere was the tres leches. Usually buying tres leches from somewhere other than a Mexican bakery usually ends in a sugary wet disaster, but when they pulled it off, I knew we could be in business

The cream of the crop, at least to me were the mini pies. I always love eating pies by myself so making one smaller was only the next logical step, and I must say it almost brought a tear to my eye. Me and my food brother took bites out our pies and then gave each other that look that only a fellow secret food beast will understand. Needless to say those pies went off to the great bakery in the sky
Long story short, get here, eat some pastries then walk out like a boss

As my first venture out after being diagnosed celiac I was not disappointed with their gluten free items! Walking into Greens & Protiens has a very homelike clean feel. It almost seems like it should be in Southern California. They have a large assortment of healthy items on their menu such as shakes, salads, pizzas and sandwiches. I decided to try the green leaf berry blast shake (carrots, kale, berries, spinach, soy milk, agave nectar, and vanilla extract) I've been every day for the past 5 days since for this shake its so delicious! I also tried the Greek pizza on gluten free crust.. YUM! Hummus, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta and kalamata olives. The crust is actually amazing too it's almost like a flatbread. I will be suggesting this place to everyone and I can't wait for their 2nd location on Flamingo and the 215 to open! See you all there :)

Perfect diner for a late night snack. Great huge portions right on the Strip. Saw one guy eat a chicken fried mozzarella steak hero sandwich with onion rings tooth picked into the top. Five minutes into it, his eyeballs turned white with 3 sevens across them. He fell out of the booth and yelled, "I just paid off!" That's a late night Vegas diner, baby.

Tickety Tacky in only the best way possible.  I actually really like this place.  The neon lights reminds me of my mothers make up in the 90's.

Nick the waiter was a sweetheart.  I am ridiculous in my requests sometimes, but he managed to cater to all of them.

The portions are huge!   My steak and spinach salad was delicious!  The steak was tender and medium rare just as I requested.  I asked for candied walnuts in it and Nick brought me a bowl of them!  That's what I call service.

Late night eats in Vegas!  I'll definitely be back!

Pancakes were not steaming hot. They give one small hard as a rock ball of butter that punctures the skin of the pancake. Hash browns were not served with the pancakes. The wife's French Toast was obviously frozen and not served hot.

A little advice for Ihop management. Have an Ihop management type that likes pancakes order pancakes with one hard minuscule piece of butter on barely lukewarm pancakes and see if he/she enjoys that meal. Then go  over to the Waffle House and learn how butter should be served. For those management people that need the cliff notes version, you serve the butter soft and the pancakes hot so that the butter melts on to the pancakes.

I've heard some scuttlebut over the years that there are health code regulations about serving butter soft. I find that hard to believe since every other restaurant I visit seems to have soft butter.

This will definitely be my last visit to Ihop.

We had dinner here last night with some friends and I'm raising my rating by one star to three. 

Everything I wrote about in my original review is still present and I agree with the Yelp'er who thought Nick's as over rated at best. 

The wine list is sad, with only three choices of Italian reds, all Chanti. No Barolo's, Valpolicella, Sangiovese's, or any super Tuscans. I do realize that chantii is made mostly from the sangiovese varietal, but a simple sangiovese would have been nice. 

Where Nick's has improved in is their fish offerings and the baked Lasagna. Both were very good. But their meat Lasagna, which is made with a flavorful Bolognese sauce, was delicious and worth a trip.

***Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Gardens is a great spot for a photo (though there are a lot of people doing the same thing or walking by so it can be difficult); it is still a nice spot to take a look and it is free (it also changes with the season, which makes it worth repeat visits); the current theme is winter and Christmas with trains, many colors of poinsettias, a Christmas tree, and a polar bear made up of many white flowers***

Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Bellagio offers both free valet and self parking.

Let me give you this little tip:

Do not attend a Vegas Strip Club with your brothers and/or male family members.  Under any circumstances.  No ifs, ands or butts.  Just don't.  Seriously.

It's awkward.  And upsetting.  And awkward.  

Little did I know that while my cousin Lauren and I watched our respective brothers get lapfucked by a pretty pair named Pilot and Perfect, that our benefactor had already paid for us to get our own laps snizzed on by Mercedes, a tight little tan blonde.

She sauntered over, asked the boys of the group that weren't busy getting jacked in a backroom somewhere to buy her a redbull (redbull is stripper cryptonite) and then sorta draped over us...

And that's when we both got felt up. 

Mercedes:  You guys both have really big boobs!

Rachel and Lauren: ...

*Stripper grabs our boobs*

Mercedes:  Are they real?

Rachel and Lauren:  *nod simultaneously* 

: |

Mercedes:  Mine are fake.

Rachel and Lauren:  *shock and awe* You don't say?

*Rachel and Lauren get the hell out of Spearmint Rhino*

Getting felt up without dinner or even a drink purchased for me beforehand felt wrong, but watching my brother enjoy a lap dance a little too much was enough to hurtle my nice seafood dinner out of the depths of innerspace onto the floor.

I'll give it up for the strippers super soft skin, though.  It's nice.  And they smell good too.  Lauren and I are thinking about creating a perfume called "Stripper".  It will be a blend of cucumber melon and coconut nectar with glitter.  Lots of glitter.

Oh, and they have pretty nice fake boobs. 

If you like that sort of thing.

I guess I should've looked at Brian S's review before I dropped off my clothing at Prestige.  Or, maybe I should've listened to my boyfriend when he told me to ask at Prestige how much each item would be for dry cleaning.  Of course, I didn't... and for that I was punished when I received the bill.

$16 to dry clean a Banana Republic dress that probably cost me $50 to purchase.  That's ridiculous!

Ready for more insanity?
1 shirt/blouse - $14.10 (it had beads on it but still!)
1 dress (another sundress) - $18.40
1 pair of capri pants - $9.10
1cotton blouse - $8.10

Total damage - $65.70

Yes, I am extremely embarrassed that I wasted so much $$ on dry cleaning that I could've had done at the $1.99 cleaners instead!  I would have saved $55.70!  That is a lot of money!

Needless to say, I will not be back to Prestige unless I go to pick up Jared's shirts there.  I guess that's the only decently priced item.  He gets them laundered for $2.25 a pop.

Good luck to you and your high prices, Prestige Cleaners!

Definitely not your "typical" Vegas hotel... More like the grand vacation clubs I'd say, if I had to make a comparison.

Large rooms fit for a King (or queen), suites concept with a full furnished little kitchen.
Gorgeous bathroom, great view, free valet park, close to the monorail, and let's see the list goes on. 

Oh, there is no casino on the property. This place is similar to the Hilton grand Vacations complex with the difference that Signature is more central to the happenings of Las Vegas.

If you're going to watch one Cirque show in Vegas, make it this one!

Trust, it's one of the best Cirque shows i've ever seen on the strip!

From the breathtaking panoramic scenes, amazing set changes, and jaw dropping acrobatic performances, this show is a MUST for any Vegas goer.

The water element was what took this show over the top for me.  Much like Le Reve (not a Cirque Du Soleil affiliated show) it was incredible seeing how the set dynamically changed from dry to wet and even wetter!

Just do yourself a favor and do not, i repeat Do NOT purchase tickets for the front rows. You'll eventually end up breaking your neck trying to see all the aerial performances! For me, the sweet spot for any Cirque Du Soleil show is middle and center. You're able to see everything comfortably from this vantage point and that IMO is priceless!

With the combination of the inspiring live soundtrack, exotic sets and spectacular performances, i can guarantee you will have an unforgettable experience that you will treasure for years to come!

Happy Times!

Ichiza was shut down by the SNHD on June 30. 
http://vegas.eater.com/archives/2014/07/03/japanese-favorite-ichiza-shut-down-by-snhd.php

Ugh. If you like to play Russian Roulette with your health, keep reading. But personally, I'd never come here again, because they don't practice basic hygiene yet they serve raw fish and raw beef. Yuck. 

The food was decent, 4 stars. It reminds me of a smaller, dirtier Honda-ya in Tustin.  They've got typical Izakaya-style items on their menu, such as sashimi, yakitori and ramen. I really enjoyed the kimchi buta and the famous honey toast. I also got the beef tataki, which was decent, but now I feel queasy that I ate it. . 

The decor isn't much. It feels like an authentic Japanese Izakaya; small, cramped, with a decent sake list and faded pieces of paper taped to the wall. 

Service was ok, it wasn't packed on a Thurs. night when we went. 

Decent place, but with the health concerns and so many other good places to eat nearby, I doubt I'll ever go back here again.

day 15  of my nation wide tour

its probably the most famous and best jiu jitsu academy in vegas as far as a lot of insiders are concerned. you got so many good guys on the mat all the time. and you got laimon there running a lot of the classes.

it has a family vibe there. laimon's got a little army. they teach mma, boxing, muay thai, fitness, and of course my favorite, bjj.

laimon is like a scientist and i got a chance to take simpson's class too. he is super technical as hell and all his guys are tough. i'm getting used to this, getting my ass beat up at every academy thing. i am worn out from hours of driving, eating crap, no sleep, and training all day.

but wish i could do this for the rest of my life. seriously. in to the wild i go!

Unfortunately, after living near the canal for 5 years, I haven't seen a dead body.  Seriously, it's my dream to find one.  I can see the TV crews and cameras now...
The Grand Canal is now paved from 7th Avenue East.  I rode it with Robert M and Bacon all the way down to McDowell, and the paving continued.  No traffic to deal with, except for when crossing streets.  
We saw some cool pottery, super-sized, as decor.  There are also several little parks in CenPho along the canal.
I've read/heard that the city is actually going to start utilizing the canal as more of a park.  They'll be putting up more lighting and trees and little shops along the way.  I can't wait for that part!  
I still need to see a floater, though.

A bare bones campground in a bare bones environment.  You're in the desert, people, and despite what the business men of Las Vegas or Palm Springs would have you believe, humans aren't exactly adapted to live out here.  So, for $10 a car per night, you get the basics, and that's all.

- Drive in or walk in sites
- Vault toilets
- Potable water

Since it's the open desert, you're not exactly tucked in away from the neighbors, but rather clustered together, sorta like a very miniature and far less creative burning man camp.  Be prepared for some chilly nights if it's not summertime, exacerbated by 50-60 mile an hour night-time winds.

This is a popular camping spot for people visiting Red Rock Canyon - especially among the climbing and hiking sets.  Pretty friendly and mellow lot when I was there.  Those in desperate need of a shower must drive down Charleston a ways to pay for showers at the climbing gym.

So, as long as you're not expecting rolling soft grass, steamy showers, and a martini shack, this place will do just fine.  Afterall, you are supposed to be roughing it, right?

Girls and guys gone wild! TAO Beach is crammed with gorgeous people... but it's way too close for comfort - for me at least. The pool is tiny, and by the end of the day, half the water has been splashed out of the pool and is completely murky. 

We didn't have to wait in line or pay a cover to get in on a Saturday afternoon, which was a plus, but the place was a madhouse. On the upside, because the place is so small, it's much easier to make friends with complete strangers who will let you hang out in their lounge area.

For the ultimate Vegas pool party experience, my vote is definitely for Wet Republic or Encore Beach Club.

This is a very impressive worship space, one which I was fortunate enough to visit just before it's consecration a few months ago. 

An LDS friend gave me a private grand tour and I came away very much amazed with all the work and effort put into this Temple. The only down side was my inability to take any pictures inside. 

For those who know me, I would have normally have taken a couple of dozen pictures. So I was somewhat disappointed that it wasn't allowed, per Mormon custom.  But it was something which I respected on my visit.

This is also one of the largest temples I've ever seen and the grounds are massive. Probably on a par with the one in Las Vegas. The only other LDS Temple I've been inside, is one back in Glenview, Illinois, which is tiny by comparisons. 

I left amazed and very impressed.

Really gays? What has happened to us? We've become so serious. So mainstream. So. Oh dear. How do I say this...so, so heterosexual! GASP! 

Strollers. Parents. Pets. Lacoste shirts. Topsiders. Soccer moms. Soccer dads. And in my best Sarah Palin voice, "Joe 6 packs". Just normal folks don't ya know. You betcha. 

Where are the inappropriately dressed men in Speedos, glitter and nipple tassels? Dykes on bikes? Minors tripping on E? What has happened to our luster people? Have we become....um, boring? 

Well, I"m not sure. But the Rainbows Festival is darn fun. A small town feel, in a lovely urban setting, filled with the usual food vendors, t-shirts booths and local organizations hawking their wares and services. But overall, the genuine feeling of fun, love and celebration permeated this event. 

Lots of smiles, hugs and waves. And yes, lots of families of all types. And, really, that is what it's all about right. We noshed on turkey legs, tacos and swilled Bud and fruity vodka drinks. Ten bucks to park, but free to get in. How cute and small town is that? Well, not the parking maybe. But who doesn't love a free party? 

Rickie and I had a blast and at the end of our Rainbow, we found a bag full of condoms, lube and free minutes for a gay sex site. Ahhh, my people! Girls and gays just wanna have fun! See ya next year. And don't forget the nipple clamps!

Lost in translation?

What it should be:  A working businessman's meal.  100g-150g of high quality, heritage pork, coated in fresh bread crumbs and fried golden brown.  The small portion is accompanied by AYCE rice and cabbage.  Do it yourself sesame based sauces for the tonkatsu and to dress the cabbage.

What they offer:  A simple menu.  Choice of either the softer, less fatty tenderloin of the slightly more firm loin from an everyday pig.  Served traditionally or as a donburi or with curry.  Rice, miso soup, and cabbage completes the meal (not AYCE).  Make your own sauce, grinding your sesame seeds and mixing in the house sauce which has a good dark soy background and hints of plum perfume.  

What I got:  Tried both the tenderloin and loin.  An oily, excessively thick eggy crust of not freshly made breadcrumbs (taste like store bought panko) surrounding an over cooked piece of pork.  Hawaii yeeps, think L&L quality.

Ultimately it's better than your average plate lunch place and not a bad deal for the novelty and price.  Tonkatsu snobs, look elsewhere.

Since I'm in a Eugene O'Neill frame of mind, I'm going to title this review as "A Moon for the Misbegotten."

In my review of our return flight from BOS, initially on American and ultimately US Air to PHX, I called it: "A Long  Days Journey into Night."  That was due to the scheduling mishap and "equipment issues" experienced on that trip. We were moved from a connecting flight on American, to a non-stop on US Air

After arriving in PHX, our bags were somehow where misplaced.  The AA folks in BOS promised they would get word down stairs to the baggage handlers to move it over to US Air.  Well, we arrived on time, but with no bag in the carousel as you would say.

The nice thing about traveling today, as opposed to twenty years ago is all the technology the airlines use.  They were able to locate our bag, since it was scanned in our original connecting airport of DFW. Wow. But, they weren't sure where it was just now. Ugh.

They took all our information and promised they would find it and deliver it to our front door. Hmmm I thought, but they were very reassuring and sincere about it.  So yesterday around four o'clock our doorbell rang and yes, there was our bag.  Looking no worse for it's side trip to DFW.  

But now we have a mystery.  Why did our bag have a United Airlines tag, over the original American Airlines one?  Sometimes, life is about not asking too many questions! LOL

YAY!  The menu and prices remain the same as before and the only thing missing is Big Dan.  New management (Chef Pablo and his wife) have already gotten the heating and cooling of the place under control by adding a new mini-split heat pump so it won't be freezing inside in winter and roasting in summer!     :-))

Today I went with an Asada (Grilled Beef) Taco ($1.25), a Pescado (Fish) Taco ($2.00) and a Tamale de Rez (Beef) ($2.00). Sides of grilled onion, a grilled Jalapeo, half a Key Lime, plus cups of Salsa Verde and Guacamole Sauce were included, gratis...  just as before.

This was delicious and inexpensive meal, so long live Restaurant Atoyac Estilo Oaxaca!     :-))

My family has a motto: "Pot just makes me tired and hungry; and I'm already tired and hungry." For some of the family this means "Say no to drugs"; for others it means harder stuff is where it's at; for me it means "I need a burger and a nap."

Cue the hippies. 

Two Hippies served me up a real burger. Like a REAL one! you know curvy like I like em; not flat. 

The fries came in a paper bag so that no one can claim they had no idea it was bad for them and sue. The bad is clear by the time you take a seat...grease may be my favourite food

I am not going to be the only one not to mention that you get a burger, fries and can of soda (pop for Thomas S and the people of his homeland and surrounding areas--ps they say pop because they would just say soda funny.) for $5!! Way better than fast food for cheaper.

Absinthe comes highly recommended! Quite possibly one of the best (and most affordable) shows on the strip.

This cabaret style show is the perfect balance of cirque (and by cirque I mean circus), comedy and variety show. The Gazillionaire is your Master of Ceremonies / ringleader for the evening. You'll come to love the grease and slime of his swagger. And his sidekick Penny Pibbets is so cute and adorable the sexual outbursts won't bother you a bit. The execution of all the curse words, sexual innuendos, racist jokes and back flips is so entertaining you won't find it the least bit offensive. And if you do--too bad. Your not getting your money back so you should probably mope back to your hotel room and grow a sense of humor.

On top of the laughs, the flippy bits and various circus acts are thoroughly entertaining. However, there was a strange one involving Angel Porrino and a bubble that I couldn't quite wrap my head around. I've seen the show thrice and I look forward to all the outlandish wackiness every time I go. (Thanks to my friends for hooking it up with tickets) but I would pay actual dinero to see this show myself. Its under $100 and probably the best bang for your buck show on the strip. Suitable for both men and women. Maybe not mom & dad--unless you just hang with your parents like that.

This is entertainment gold my friends. If you can only see one show in Vegas, see Absinthe. As long as you're not wicked conservative or shudder at the slightest bit of obscenity, i.e. a total prude, you will thoroughly enjoy yourself and laugh for so long  you'll waltz out of here with aching abs and lifted spirits.

Its raining Sugar up in He A!

Seriously this place is a sugar addicts dream shop.  Everything here is sweet and sugary.  Came here to redeem one of the My Vegas coupons.  I felt high on sugar the whole time I was in there and I didn't even have any candy.  I picked up some chocolate rocks, malt balls, chocolate covered pretzel and green cotton candy! 

Since I don't have a sweet tooth these were all brought into the office to be shared. 

Eyes ~ So many candies and sweetst!
Nose ~ Smells sweet!.
Ear ~ Enjoying the music they have playing.
Mouth ~ Chocolate rocks taste yum!.
Tummy ~ Must not eat too much!

Beautiful & Hella Crowded!  But Wait!  Now With FREE WiFi!

SITREP

I did NOT want to be here.  I kept wondering, "Where is Mr. Rogers?  This is NOT my neighborhood!!!"

THE SETUP

I was on a Spokane to Sacramento trip...BY WAY OF FUC'n PHOENIX!  "Way to add 5 hours to a 2 hour flight, SouthWest!"  But it's kinda hard to blame the lovely Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport that turn of events.

[And in the end, it was even hard to get angry at SouthWest since they DID have the courtesy to take us right smack over the top of the Grand Canyon - a sight I'd never seen before - so THAT in itself was an ironic treat.  "Hey Mom!  Yeah, I know I was going to Sacramento, BUT guess what?  I saw the Grand Canyon too!"  Now THAT doesn't happen every day.]

AIRPORT METRICS

Sky Harbor is such a beautiful, large airport, with lots of different terminals, lots of different automatic walkways, and - get this - LOTS of Laptop Bar & Stool set-ups.  During my 2 1/2 hour layover, where I also switched planes, I got to charge my laptop, my camera, my iPhone, and my external battery charger:  I was set!

WIFI

Free!  That's all I need to say!  I was able to connect quickly and upload all of those pictures I had just taken of the grand canyon to Flickr, Yelp and Facebook.  I also did some blogging to boot.

IN SUM

I have no idea what the traffic was like to get to the airport... since I landed there.

I have no idea what the parking situation was like at the airport... since I landed there.

I have no idea what the TSA Checkpoint situation is like at this airport since....yeah, you guessed it, I LANDED there.

But you know what?  As a guest of the airport who galavorted from one terminal to another terminal as a transfer to catch my next flight, it was not a bad deal.

THE LOWDOWN

The Sky Harbor Airport makes for a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

Let me join the Marisa S. and Joe S. bandwagon and say this place is fantastice and yhanks yo Joe and Marisa, I now know about it!  I/we went here on a Wednesday night after the ISC UYE with a few yelpers for their wine tasting quiz.  For $10, you get a blind 4 wine tasting in which you compare your tasting notes to the list  the Wine Warehouse provides and then you make an "educated" guess for each of the wines you are tasting.  I loved it.  What a great idea.  And the best part, if you get all 4 correct, your flight is free.  Ahhhhh, bliss.  I got none correct.  Zero.  Bummer, but I drank wine! 

This is a very cute and well stocked wine store and from what I can tell, the staff is very knowledgeable and well trained.  From the serious jazz tunes playing to the short sale wall to the wonderful assortment of tapas and cheese plates, this wine store has all the makings of a fun evening out!  Can you imagine telling your date or friends, lets go to a wine store tonight.  They would be surprised!

My return factor is 100%

Guy-ism: We'd be hitting up the Linq like some Kulinary Gangstas and we had to stop in to try my brah Fieri's new place. 

English Translation: The Linq was flooded, half the stores shut down, so under coercion of my non-foodie bf, who for some reason has a man-crush on Guy, we tried Fieri's new place. 

Guy-ism: Yo brah, I love yo' show and that, but it's some seriously messed up grub you servin' up there. 

Translation: The food stinks, waaaay overpriced, filled with tourists and every cheesy wannabe-cool, wannabe-foodie, marketing slogan is used here. 

Guy-ism: Yo, I've never been more excited about Drunken Fish Tacos since my frat days, but man, these blow. Damn, talk about a buzz kill, it's like finding out Amanda, the hot, redhead chick has the clap or somethin'. It may be slam-drunk, but damn if I'm doing any slamming. 

Translation: For $18 you get ammonium-smelling TILAPIA. Yeah, ok Guy... for $18, at least serve some seared ahi. The radish or ginger on top is gross. The tacos tastes plain, maybe they forgot the mojo de ajo??? 

Guy-ism: This place is money. Yeah, like it's going to cost you a lot of money! Dude, I know we be all gangster and thug and sh*t but 70 dead presidents for lunch is not cool. 

Translation: Fish Tacos, overly greasy Philly Dip Sandwich, one cocktail is the same price as a NY Steak dinner off-Strip. Yeah... screw you Guy and your man-crushes.

Although we didn't stay in one of the rooms at Wynn, we spent a lot of time there. Le Reve was spectacular, Okada was amazing, Blush was swanky, The Buffet was decadent. All the staff we encountered was wonderful and friendly. Whether it was waiting in the buffet line, or sitting out by the valet while waiting for a friend to pick us up, we were brought water while we waited. If only they offered us cocktails as well, I would give them a 6th star. 

Wynn glows like gold in the sunlight and makes a bold statement at night. It's amazing that Steve Wynn was able to design it, being nearly blind. Yeah, maybe some of the decor is flashy and colors clash, but it must be hard to dictate colors and patterns to him.

Luxurious and glamorous, you wouldn't expect anything less from the man who transformed The Strip.

It's BRITNEY, B*TCH!!!!

Fabulous show!!!  Lights, theatrics, vivid sets, striking costumes, outrageous dance performances, smooth song transitions ... It was a very entertaining show!  Her songs alone will get you off your feet to dance, dance, dance ... So I didn't mind standing 95% of the 90-minute show.  You could sit but you wouldn't be able to see since everyone was standing and dancing, which makes for a high energy, fun show.

We all have heard it time and time again, she lip syncs her shows ... SO WHAT!!!  She's not Adele or any high caliber vocalist!!  I'm sure they're not jumping and flying all over the stage at their concerts, it's impossible to dance and sing perfectly!  So prerecorded?  I don't care!!  She's an awesome performer with beat-thrilling, ass-shaking songs!  

Btw: Sorry that douche cheated on you, Brit.  Good job dropping his @ss!!!  Demand to be cherished and nothing less!!!   You looked great, post popping out 2 kids!  Keep it up, girlie!!!

*This review is dedicated to Brandon C. for reviewing Brit's boutique http://www.yelp.com/biz/britney-spears-boutique-las-vegas?hrid=XPYdszVwVxkPiTZ2qqrLPA.  Now go watch the show!!!!  lol!

My whole family comes to Dr. Tran and I recently had the pleasure of seeing her myself. The location is perfectly convenient and seeing all the 5 star reviews from reputable Yelpers is a plus!
Dr. Tran's office certainly earns a 5 star review. They are open late until 7pm some nights which is great for people with regular work schedules. They have a large selection of frames and their contact lense pricing is better than Costco. The staff is friendly and very accomodating. I had the pleasure of chatting with Tom, who was a delight and offered me the best deal on my contacts.
Dr. Tran is very knowledgeable and thorough in her exam. She was helpful in answering my questions and concerns;  she even gave me good info on a future laser correction procedure that I'm still getting up the nerve to do (being awake and coherent while looking into a laser beam is not the easiest concept for me to embrace yet). What's great about Dr. Tran is that she also looks ahead to offer you the best solution that takes into consideration factors like your age, your habits and lifestyle. For example, she recommended I under correct one eye so that it doesn't impede on my close up vision possibly reducing future dependancy on reading glasses. I will continue to see Dr. Tran and entrust her to be my co-doctor once I'm ready for Lasik.

Just moved into the area and went to this location. It was so busy but staff was very helpful as I'm not used to this store and couldn't find the things I usually get. One time I went to another store and there was a demo of waffles with pomegranate seeds and yoghurt on it.  At this store there was a  sample with Belgian waffles, strawberries, and whipped cream...delicious!  So I bought the waffles and they were so cheap! I also love their Mediterranean feast meal. They have so many different items and prices are very reasonable. I find that I go to Trader Joe's a lot because of the variety of products and the atmosphere. I highly recommend Trader Joe's.

Great service. No, scratch that. Amazing service. And their bikes aren't bad, either!

My last bike was probably in grade school. You know, I had the ones where you pedal backwards to brake. I have begun to learned the modern world of cycling this year and signed up for my first sprint triathlon. JT's gave me an amazing deal on an entry level road bike.  Each new bike purchase comes with two maintenance checks you use later on and 10% off all accessories for the first month.

With each visit, I am very thankful for this locally owned bike shop and its amazing staff, JT, Jay, Eric, and Neil, for all the knowledge and help they've given. From servicing my bike to installing my new bike pedals, they have always been professional, fast, and efficient. Their prices are great, they have a great selection, well stocked with bike accessories, and store is well-kept.

Anytime you need a reliable bike shop near Henderson, I highly recommend JT's. They definitely know what they're doing!

I would give them negative stars if it was possible! One star is WAY TO GRACIOUS! HAD A HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE WITH TIVEGAS! 

Upon coming back to our room after a wedding last night we found a disturbing man leaving OUR ROOM with a bag full of all our valuables!!! After confronting him, the crazed man grabbed my husband by the throat and ran through the SERVICE ELEVATOR ROOM, using the SERVICE ELEVATOR to escape! Those elevators have to have keys and the hotel receptionist said she has worked there 9 years and doesn't know how to work those elevators!! SKETCHY!!! 

On top of the terror, security was sluggish and ON OUR FLOOR witnessing the attack and did NOT RUN, they walked, strolled even, over to us allowing the man to escape and offering only to write a report "IF WE WANTED TO". Security then proceeded to try to persuade us to NOT FILE A POLICE REPORT!!! SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS SECURITY SYSTEM?! Isn't safety supposed to be the most important??? I don't think TI Vegas has that priority AT ALL. 

And to ice this cake of a stay, TI VEGAS Risk Management NEVER filed a note or report to hotel staff/management to inform them of the breach of safety, as well as REFUSED to compensate for the room for our stay. UNREAL, never ever coming back and you are all warned!

Long over due review.

I don't dance 
I don't care for Country music 
I don't like hardcore Hip Hop
I don't like long lines for the bar 
I don't like small drink cups
I don't like bad karaoke
I don't like MILFS dancing to old 80's tunes (actually this can be ok)

BUT for some damn reason every time I come here I get drunk, damn drunk, on those cheap ass, small cups of rum and cokes that are gone by the time you get to the font of the line. At least you can sing like the other retards, or dance a 2 step,while you wait. On the other side you can lean like a Chollo, Just watch out for his Ho. They don't like drunk white boys, we belong with the milfs dancing to ABBA in the 80's room. 

This place is crazy and is is what you make it. If you had a bad time go to another room and try something new.

Remember the movie Brokedown Palace with Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale? And all of the Thai people were so mean to them. 

Oh. It has nothing to do with this review. I was just asking if you remembered that movie. Anyway, you won't find mean Thai people here. It's definitely a team  effort here and everyone was very helpful and most friendly. 

Seating is rather awkward as their isn't any signage indicating what to do, wait or sit. Or order inside. But I was quickly invited to sit wherever. Before I knew it a cold, crisp, simple salad and a menu was place in front of me. Yay! Free salad. The dressing was SO good. I bet Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes didn't get free salad. Course they were too busy being pistol whipped by the prison guards. 

Anyhoo...I ordered the pad thai and it was fantastic. Though I would have loved more tofu. It came with the cutest little spring and a wedge of cold watermelon. YUM! Love watermelon as it so refreshing. 

All this for around eight bucks. I bet you Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes...oh...never mind. Just get your butt to Thai Basil. Where you will be greeted warmly, served efficiently and probably, won't get pistol whipped by a lesbian Thai prison guard.

Apparently, I'm BANNED from this Buffalo Exchange. 

How does one get banned from a Buffalo Exchange?

Did I punch one of the snotty hipsters for not thinking my $200 article of clothing is worth $6? Did I toss over a rack of musty knock off handbags in a fit of rage? Did I curse out a bored looking guy with flippy hair and an ironic mustache?

Nope, I wasn't even in the store.

I accidentally sold a pair of pants that my boyfriend didn't want sold. He called immediately (within 20 minutes of me leaving the store) and said that he'd be in the next day to pick them up. He had the receipt, and the assistant manager said that would be okay. Well, upon him arriving at the store to complete this previously agreed upon transaction, the same manager decided this wasn't okay and said that he had to buy the pants at retail price. While I'm leaving out some of the mind boggling back and forth that went on, I'll sum it up as the level of poor customer service and rude behavior displayed by the "management" of the store was shocking. 

While my boyfriend never raised his voice, lost his cool or got flustered, the manager decided because he made her stand by what she had originally agreed on, he was "NEVER ALLOWED BACK IN THIS STORE AGAIN" 

"OR YOUR GIRLFRIEND EITHER!!!!"

So there you have it. Banned from Buffalo Exchange. Funny, I haven't lost any sleep over it.

Best buffet on The Strip! Not to mention it's also located inside the best hotel in Vegas. Prices vary on the day of week, but the brunch buffet on Tuesday was only $22, which included unlimited champagne. What a deal!

Their international selection is absolutely mouthwatering. Your eyes will definitely be bigger than your stomach, so make sure you pace yourself. Hightlights included pastas served in mini skillets, fried chicken wings in mini fry baskets, awesome carving station, giant made-to-order omelettes and a beautiful array of desserts.

Save the buffet for your last day. Perfect cure for those hangovers!

If I could give a zero star I would.

I have NEVER been so discriminated in my life at any business until I went here. I went with a group of friends to check out their nightclub and upon entrance the bouncer pulled me aside asked me my name where I lived then ACCUSED me of being on drugs cause my eyes were big. I have natural big eyes. Next he ACCUSED me of being too fucked up and I can never enter the club again. I was sober and told him to breathalyze me or do a drug test and I'll test negative. He refused and just kicked me out. He said I was walking weird, I'm pidgeon toed! He was then mocking me with my big eyes by opening his eyes wide and talking really slowly like as if I'm stupid. 

I have never ever felt so discriminated. Hakkasan ruined my experience and I am NEVER coming back here. If you're in vegas looking for a club to enter please go to Marquee or XS. This club needs to enforce better bouncers.

Can't wait to come back to Vintage 95 for a date night!

Very romantic atmosphere, lots of comfy furniture, and live music on weekends.

Sarah R. and I tried a glass of the Coto de Hayas from Spain. Believe it was the Tempranillo Cabernet? Memory a little hazy, this was our last stop after a night of drinks. 

Would totally order the bottle, though. 

Their wine selection is pretty extensive, lots of $5/glass options, and I know within a certain timeframe, you get a charcuterie board if you purchase a bottle. 

Full bar for all those that aren't wine lovers. 

Throw this one in your back pocket for date night, guys!

Nothing wurst than a bad weenie. No bun intendend. But every so often I get a hankering for a hot dog. A Chicago hot dog at that. In the windy city at Milwaukee and Devon sits SuperDawg and it is a site to behold. But I ain't in the Windy City. I'm in the Hot Blistering Sweltering City. And I didn't know where to go. And then I drove down Thomas and saw the Vienna Beef sign! That was it. That's what I needed. The universe had answered my calling. You ever enter a restaurant and immediately have the instinct that you should turn your ass around and leave quickly. Yea. Well I didn't listent to my gut. Cuz it was rumbling with hunger and I could smell the hot dogs steaming. The place wasn't clean. Ok, it was dirty. Stained floors, rec room style paneling with splintering chunks of wood and vinyl chairs with duct tape. Hmmm...still not enough for me. So I get home with my Chicago style dog, with pepperoncini, neon relish, celery salt, tomatoes in a soft poppy seed bun with krinkle fries. Ate it in 90 seconds. Spent the next 40 minutes in my bathroom. You get the picture. Thank God for that Reader's Digest I found under the sink cuz I would have been real bored.

Morton's, was without a doubt one of the original esteemed statehouse restaurants in America, often emulated by others.  Great they were, with superb steaks, outstanding service and old club style ambiance. This was always a top place for business and special occasion dining. Now it is not as much as it was for my money and taste based on a recent visit.
They are taken over by a very large mega restaurant chain corporation. Landry's, who are owners of over 35 restaurants and chains many you would be familiar with now own Morton's too. Morton's no longer has a focus on their original identity, meaning and purpose but are being changed in a modernized way. On my last visit changes were visible. Some changes and cost cutting and commercializing has begun. The menu is changed to include items which will appeal to a broader clientele. Now profits and growth are a bigger part of the strategy. 
Gone is the famous GM Bill. Bill was as much an institution as the restaurant he ran. Changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks. Our ribeyes were not a recognizable ribeye cut and the taste was not there as we remembered. One of three steaks came out drastically overcooked although the error was quickly remedied with a properly cooked replacement.
I just hate to see the continuing commercialization of our esteemed restaurants in America.

Besides the Book Bin, Bookmans, and Savers, this is one of my favorite places to go and find used paperbacks.

I stopped here during lunch today and picked up a LeCarre novel I have been looking to read.  They also had several recent Lee Child "Reacher" novels as well.  The store is well laid out and the employees are super helpful in finding something for you.

This Goodwill has a lot of furniture, along with a good assortment of kitchen appliances, such as coffee makers and toasters.

A great thing about their book section, is that most titles are in the $0.99 to $1.99 range. Used book stores will usually pay you $1.50 to buy them back.  So, it's sort of my own lending library. 

BTW, I put back the 2007 edition of Phoenix area restaurant reviews, since Yelp does it so much better!  LOL

Hanny's ... you have quite the tasty Riesling. 

But...your service leaves a tad bit to be desired.

On the flip side, you have hot hot hot bartenders, so I really don't mind the wait (sorry DG).

My favorite thing about you is your bathrooms. I mean, I really really love the bathrooms. 

Actually, I love the entire place. If I were going to open a bar, I would want it to look exactly like Hanny's. Well, except the meat cutter at the bar, because I am vegetarian. Perhaps I would get an industrial strength cheese cutter. (ha ha ... cheese cutter!)

Ooooo another bonus... you are right off of the light rail and you normally have parking available right outside... therefore I consider you to be in a good location.

Yeah, Hanny's ... I love you. Quite a bit. Let's go steady.

Dollar Blackjack...Wah?! I'm there
The dealers are ornery but I don't care.
Everyone says this place is run down but I don't think so.  It seems good to me, maybe a bit dated with their decor, but I'm here to gamble and get drunk.  Who cares what it looks like?
I always win so every time I'm in Vegas I come here for a bit to make me some money.

Is this the trail to Payard's Place, was all I said
This concierge has heard that question lots before
We strolled through Caesar's Casino and marched straight ahead
It was on a corner curve
From an inside counter serve
It was there where we saw the macarons.

The waitress poured our water into tiny cups
She got the caprese sandwich from the fridge
She took crepe batter from a tin and whipped it up
Added mushrooms, chicken, cream
It was a Paris cafe dream
Expensive, but ended too soon

Those summer nights, when we were free
Four-day vacation for wifey and me
Travel eaters, travel eaters
And in our quest for macarons
We stumbled on these DESERT MOONs
Vegas dreamers, Vegas dreamers
Of DESERT MOONs
Of macarons
Of DESERT MOONs
Of macarons

Caprese sandwich mozzarella fresh and light
Basil and tomato so mixed well
The chicken crepe needed something to make it right
We got mojito mint cheesecake
Too rich for me to take
And then we got to our macarons

I've never had a macaron I've liked before
Europane has the closest to me heart
But when I tried this Payard disk, I wanted more
The fillings not too sweet
A flaky cookie treat
These desserts made my tongue and heart swoon

Those summer nights, when we were free
Four-day vacation for wifey and me
Travel eaters, travel eaters
And in our quest for macarons
We stumbled on these DESERT MOONs

All of these reviews are going to get me fired as my trainer is going to assume that I've been up to no good lately. However, Nielsen's Frozen Custard is heavenly and I felt compelled to write them a nice review even though I don't really partake often (don't tell my trainer I've actually been here) as I'm not allowed! I dream of ordering lots of fattening stuff here though. I got hooked taking a few bites of the Concrete that had an entire piece of cherry pie mixed in. Oh man that was good! My mouth salivates just remembering that experience. I need to go work my butt off with my trainer so that I can earn a cheat day soon. 

#FunFact Nielsen's Frozen Custard appeared on the tv show American Restoration. The owner restored an old stove which is on display at the store. I'm surprised there aren't more photographs of it on Yelp. I'm thinking I will need to come back to Nielsen's... Strictly to take a photograph of the stove for documentary purposes, of course! ;)

Crowded, long lines, fast food quality items at inflated prices. But wanted to experience it. Will definitely not be back.
White Castle line was a 4 hour wait.
Didn't have patience to wait and just got Jazz fries & Togarashi garlic fries from Fukuburger truck which were ok. Always on the lookout for gravy fries on west coast. Tried Coast 2 Coast waffle fries with brown gravy & carmelized onions with blue cheese and was pretty good.
For admission for 5 plus french fries and cans of soda...$80...I'm a sucker!
Should've taken others advice and just gone to a nice sit down dinner anywhere else. No more food fests for me.

i wont go here ever again even if I'm dying. 

Long story short I came here last Saturday night because my leg had gotten run over by a car and I was in sever pain. I knew nothing was broken but I was worried about blood clots or tissue/muscle damage so to be on the safe side I wanted to be checked out. The ER was completely empty which was nice but now i know why. Once in a ER room I was seen by about 6 different people and every time I told them the situation how my leg was run over they each started laughing and the doctor even had the audacity to comment on my hair color (it being blonde) I have never felt so disrespected in my life and he wouldn't even show me my test results from my cat scan and xrays. So now I'm stuck with a $3,000 bill and I have nothing to show for it. He wouldn't even prescribe me ibuprofen for the pain. I will never return

Miss Sixty offers up unique takes on denim and other casual ware - with their sassy cuts.

Though their stuff is pricey, and you may have to endure trying on a good number of different sizes, since many of their jeans have strange cuts and are made from varied material - you can get a personal guarantee that once you find the right Miss Sixty piece - you will want sixty more of them.

Perhaps my favorite thing about the current Miss Sixty collection is that they're fashion forward and are bringing back overalls. They've added stretch to them, made them short and bootylicious, and injected some 'tude into them. Mark, the guy helping us at this specific Miss Sixty was extremely personable, helpful, and outgoing. He went out of his way to check in with each of us to see if we were interested in trying stuff on, and recommended that we check out the Miss Sixty outlet nearby, and extended his family and friends discount to us.

Unfortunately the cute pair of booty-alls that I tried on, were far too expensive for me and due to length, I could probably only wear them in Vegas, but it's reassuring to know, as an overalls collector - that there's a fashion line just as excited about straps attached to pants as I am.

What happened to you, Rain!? You're like a celebrity, once glamorous and incredibly popular, but that has fallen into obscurity. You used to be the posh spot, the happenin' talk of the town... but now you're overused, dirty, discarded. 

This review is long overdue and almost joined Rain by also falling into obscurity.

The layout is still cool, the music still poppin', but never in my life have I come across SO MANY ROAMING HANDS in one place. How shady can a place be such that at least 75% of the male population is trying to violate the females?!? I'd be dancing and suddenly a hand had appeared up my skirt and all the way up my thigh. I immediately moved away and noticed my lady friends were undergoing the same horror from other men. 

I was uncomfortable on the dance floor, and that NEVER happens. I love to dance and meet people and have a great time, but I'm not about to put myself out there for THAT. Gross!

Let's just say I won't be back. Ever. Unless they have a successful Perv Purge movement.

DATE TIP: Fellas, let me break it down for you. Women typically don't appreciate random hands up their skirts. At least buy them a drink first! Ha.

Ever had a piece of Broccoli that made you re-evaluate the vegetable entirely? Well I did, and I bought it from Phx Pub Mrkt. Beautiful verdant luscious dark green colour, crunchy savory and earthy, it even kept in my fridge far longer than I'd have figured an organic piece of Broccoli bought in an open air market should've kept. This broccoli made me a believer in this place. Nowadays I only shop for my seasonal fruits and veggies here, and the fact it's within walking distance from my shack only gives me further incentive. The market itself is not too big, they offer some hippie entrees at a lunch counter made by kids with tattoos and piercings and humble courteous faces. The veggies, fruits, and most of the merchanise is eihter a.)local b.)organic c.) expensive or d.)all of the above. However I love everything this market stands for and is trying to accomplish, I can only sing it's praises and shell money at it, hoping it grows into the little shop of horrors it was meant to be- with giant 7 foot anthropomorphized campy Little Richard like broccoli heads with a taste for blood and musicals.

Completely and utterly RIDICULOUS.

We came here for - surprise, surprise - a bachelorette party, but in stark contrast to the other partygoers, we were completely sober.  

Which ensured that I can reiterate with absolute confidence: completely and utterly RIDICULOUS.

The show started with a very loud montage of shows that these guys have been on - the View, Oprah, Jennifer Love Hewitt talking *about* them on Jay Leno.  It was essentially an extended commercial for something that we were already there for.  Then the guys came out and did a group dance that looked more like an aerobics routine than the HAWTEST ALL-MALE REVUE IN THE WORLD.  

This is how it went:

1.  Group dance: aerobics, aerobics, aerobics...FLASH CHEST! (crowd screams)...aerobics, aerobics, aerobics...FLASH ABS! (crowd screams)...aerobics, aerobics, aerobics...FLASH CHEST AGAIN! (crowd screams).  Guys go amongst the crowd (crowd screams).

2.  Individual dance: guy comes out, does aerobics, comes out into the crowd to find a cute veiled bachelorette to join him onstage.  Said bachelorette accepts lapdance, fondles chest and ass, gets a hug, and goes back to her seat.  Dancer does more aerobics then returns backstage.

Repeat steps 1 and 2 ad nauseum, then end show with step 1 again.

We were hoping for a lot of ass, maybe a glimpse of the package, but all we got was a lot of aerobics performed by men with too many clothes on.  Seriously, when they took off a pair of pants, (SURPRISE!) there was ANOTHER pair of pants on underneath.  When they took off the boxer briefs, (SURPRISE!) there was a g string on underneath.  They would have lasted freaking forever in a game of strip poker.  

I'm giving them an extra star for the sheer amusement they gave me (I laughed A LOT during this show), and because one of the guys shook my hand at the end.  Oh, and for all the Guns 'N Roses and Bon Jovi.  But really, why do women have to sit through all this crap when female strippers get right to the point and go straight for the pole?  

Hey Mick Dundee, dispose of the cheese and just show me your damn goods.

What can I say about Surrender. One of the worst club I have been to. The setting of the club sucks. Small dance floor I mean small. One bar in the back of the club. That has only 3 or 4 bartender try to make drinks for hundreds of people. Imagine the wait. The other bar was in the front near the Dj where it was blocked off for I don't know what. The service was horrible.
On the other hand I would like thank Dilpo you killed it!!! Great set!
Sorry Surrender never again!

Is a trip to Vegas ever complete without a visit to a Cirque du Soleil show?  I think not.

Whats a trip to Vegas without seeing some naked girls swimming and writhing in a giant human-sized fish bowl filled with water?

                          .'                     '.
                         /~~~^~~~^~^~~~\   
                        |           .-"" L_    o |      Fishies!

                                '---------'

I saw the fishbowl and I knew right away I was in.  
They hypnotize you 
They seduce you, every act more titillating than the next
They make you sell your soul to the man next to you
You forget everything
You wake up and the next moment you're sitting in a vat of writhing bodies
Will you obey?

I'm sore.  I guess that means I did.

PS- If you're looking for a conservative show, this probably isn't for you and your family.  But the crude humor, the scantily clad muscled men (wrap him up i'll take him to go) and barely there women.  This was definitely my kinda show.  Crazy moves, random stunts, perverted jokes...This was definitely perfect for me.

Don't get seats in the front rows if you don't want to be called on.  :)

Make whatever jokes you want about the name as if you're a homophobic 7th grade boy, but Dick's Hideaway has really got a great menu of American food.  
Might not be a burger, fry, and shake diner, but New Mexican cuisine is American all the way, and as a matter of fact, among their many southwestern tinged dishes, they've got a superb thick, juicy burger, grilled up on an open flame right in front of you as you sit at the bar, with some great fries AND a nice full plate of dark green salad for somewhere around 11 bucks-ish (last I was aware).

Welcome to the latest video game to hit the Vegas Strip: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Douche! 

The object of the game is to pound the precise amount of liquor needed to create a vomit-stream powerful enough to coat the plastic tits of a demented party whore in a pucker-butt monokini from 50 yards, without pissing on yourself or otherwise soiling your Hurley boardshorts. Are YOU up to the challenge?!

Level I: Gain access to the inner sanctum by withstanding the searing desert sun for upwards of an hour, while standing shoulder to shoulder with idiots and assholes in a toxic cloud of self-tanner fumes and vodka breath, waiting in the endless line to get in. Survive the stench and the swamp-ass without passing out, and you've made it! 

Level II:
Run a gauntlet of insufferably dickish door staff. Figure out which ass to kiss/dick to suck/palm to grease. Pick the wrong one, and you'll end up being trampled by a herd of sunburned Ivy League frat boys being ushered in by the REAL door boss. Beware!

Level III:
Surrender your booty to the most invasive security checkpoint this side of Gaza. These guards check every cargo pants pocket, every mint-tin, every crevice on your nervously sweating body. If you're trying to bring drugs, ChapStick or excess I.Q. points in here, better stash 'em waaaaaaay up your ass...otherwise they WILL find them!

If you've made it this far, congrats! You're almost in; there's only one last boss to defeat: the cashier.

Hopefully you've been collecting coins throughout the game, cuz you're gonna need them. $50 gets you thru the turnstile, and then it's $20 per drink thereafter. Don't believe what you read or what they tell you on the phone -- the price at the door is GUARANTEED to be higher than what you were quoted. You can argue with the cashier, like the poor sap in front of me did...but you'll just end up looking like a sad, angry chump, and you'll end up caving and forking over more cash anyway so as not to embarrass your girlfriend. Vegas nightlife/daylife lesson: YOU CAN'T WIN. The club staff is always right, no matter what kind of bullshit bait & switch tactics they use.

The final challenges are elbowing your way through a pit of TapOut-wearing, tribal-tatted 'roid-ragers at the bar, then finding an inch of tepid piss-water to wallow in somewhere amidst the 5,000 fist-pumping guidos and drunkenly braying tramp-stamped college hags who pack the pool like beer-and-bronzer-coated sardines. 

Well, now you're in -- congratulations!! Better enjoy it while it lasts...because in a year or two, this game will end up in the 99cent clearance section at GameStop...right beside "ReHab: Kingdom of Fools" and "PURE: Megatwat's Folly."  

GAME OVER

Via  Brazil was a 3 star restaurant in my previous review 3 days ago.  That's nothing to be ashamed about.... it just means the restaurant was nothing great, but not terrible TO ME.  Yelp is a site for posting your opinions.  But some guy named Dustin J. had to send me a private message saying:

"We are very sorry that Our Happy Hour is too expensive for you. 
Please visit McDonalds, Taco Bell and other fast foods if this is too expensive for you"

It took me a minute to figure out what restaurant he was referring to, but when I found 20 photos for Via Brasil, I figured it out  Congratulations, guys, I will never return to your restaurant and will make sure nobody I ever talk to does either.  Worst marketing ever.

Had the worst customer service experience ever at Polished. Polished sent out a groupon type coupon (spend $X, get $X worth of service), I called and made an appointment. When I arrived for my appointment, the tech I requested was running behind. Instead of going to a different tech, I rescheduled, since I had already waited 20 minutes and was on a tight schedule myself. When I came on that day Wes, the owner, would not honor my coupon! I was very upset as this was their mistake! When I told Wes I was going to leave a Yelp review, he said "Go ahead! Obliviously our business isn't hurting!" 

Well, Wes, judging by the constant coupons you are now sending out - your business is hurting. Maybe the way you treat your customers, and the way you mistreat and yell at nail techs in front of customers, is coming back to haunt you. 

I HIGHLY suggest Diamond Nails just a block down on Rainbow. Same side of the street. AMAZING services all around.

All I kept thinking about when I stepped into Zia Records was, like Wow... they've taken a 60's head shop and mixed it with a record store and POOF!  "Let's Do The Time Warp Again!"

The Zia chain is a used Record/ CD/ DVD/ Book/ Speaker shop that has incense burning to set the mood. I would imagine, though I didn't ask, that you could purchase rolling paper here too. So I began to wonder where are they hiding Bill and Ted as I walked around the store?  LOL

Don't get me wrong, I really like the concept and the prices seemed pretty good. If I was going off to college again, besides IKEA this would definitely make my list. This is a Geeks, Geek place. 

They have dorm posters and lots of cool toys from TV's past and present.  Everything from the robot from "Lost in Space"(photos), to a fairly large statues of Leonard Nimoy's Spock, both Matt Smith's and David Tennant's "Dr Who, as well as bendable toy figures from CBS's "Big Bang Theory". And yes, they have both Penny and Leonard. But let's not go there okay! LOL

So yes, I'm a Fan of Zia Records, and yes I'll be back. Now where did I leave my Tardis?  Beam me up Scott D!

I've been hearing about Tee Pee for years; it's considered a Phoenix landmark, I think!  George W Bush has been there afterall!  But it wasn't until my husband purchased a groupon for this place, that I was forced to go check it out.  

My quick summary:
*chips and salsa - meh, nothing special, kind of stale tasting to be honest
*guacamole - nasty
*Bud Light - A-OK
*Chicken Tostada - decent
*House Salad - decent but simple (it's just lettuce and tomato)
*Service - friendly and attentive although it did take awhile to get ice water, and when we finally did, we were handed a pitcher and 3 glasses.  I realized it was 3 glasses for the 2 of us because 2 of them were stuck together - classic!

Bottom line: I don't eat Mexican very often, but when I do, I'll likely go elsewhere.

"The Only Las Vegas Ultra-Dive Bar" might make you dive out the window into the Venetian lagoon below. First of all, f* you for calling anything an 'Ultra-dive' bar. You contain none of the features found in a good dive bar or an ultra lounge. You are a sports bar, Rockhouse. Own it (or take down your 80+ tv's playing sports). 

Unfortunately, they fail at the sports bar elements too. Drink prices at $8/shot and $12/cocktail? Huh. Why are you here? I can get a (better) $12 cocktail at a reputable joint somewhere else in the Venetian. Isn't this a $5 pint of Jack 'n coke type of place? WTF? The food was a fail for me as well. The grilled chicken and avocado sliders should be renamed "wood chip served between a sawdust bun" as they were dry, tiny and tasteless. Sure, you can come here with good company (as I did) and have fun, but that can be done anywhere in the area. 

Oh yea, they have a mechanical bull. Ride it. NEXT!

From Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich comes an authentic, contemporary Italian restaurant.  It's good! 

This is not your "we import everything from Italy so we are an Italian restaurant", nor is it "I use my mamma's recipes and she was Italian so this is authentic".  B&B creates classic Italian flavors using what is available seasonally, in the area.  From fresh herbs and produce to house cured salumi, it all goes into creating outstanding authentic food.

Antipasti features a simple but perfect braised tripe alla Romana.  Tender, with no off smell.  Vibrant acidity from the tomatoes add a nice foil to the mildly flavored tripe.  Perfect.  The grilled octopus, heaven.  Toothsome with a charred bitter edge that contrast well with the sweet, spicy, sour limoncello vinaigrette.  The lemony perfume is heady.  Sensory overload on a single plate.

Prima focuses around perfectly cooked, authentic pastas.  The bucatini all'Amatriciana is near Roman perfect.  Fatty, porky goodness of guanchale, bright acidity from pured tomatoes, a zing of acidity from some wine, lightly spiced and finished with pecorino cheese.  If that's too simple, the bone marrow ravioli is to die for.  Rich unctuous goodness surrounded by thin pasta bathed in a veal shank ragu that must have simmered all day.

Secondi proteins are different (lamb, rabbit, quail).  Experiment.  The deep fried sweetbreads, Win.   Crisp on the outside, pillowy on the inside; they pair perfectly with the sweet sour balsamic glazed cippolinis and the sweet bitterness of charred corn.  Don't think about what you're eating and you should be OK.

Massive Italian centric wine list representing DOC / DOCG throughout the country.  Good vintage depth for super Tuscans.  Vegas resort prices.

True Italian service, friendly with great pride taken in what they do.

Located on Las Vegas Blvd near Charleston. In the grungy area so usually do it in the day and it's not good for big parties as the dining room is really small.

This is a follow up review and I Love this place. 

But I'm not over selling it and dont expect a fancy looking decor and designer napkins - it's not gonna happen. The waitress and t.v. are set for spanish...cuban style so be ready.

Lunch pollo criollo , black beans, avacado salad and iron beer.  All we're bangin my drums and made it a better day :)

Fast service  and like eating at a relatives and all really good.

Been eating here for along time.

"....and I think to myself, what a wonderful world." - "What a Wonderful World",- Louie Armstrong

Great show by a talented performer!

I watched the beginning of Terry Fator's meteoric rise to Las Vegas headliner on America's Got Talent several years ago.  To describe Terry - he is a singing impressionist ventriloquist comedian.  He does spot-on impersonations & sings better via ventriloquism than others do through their own accord.  It was w/ great anticipation that I finally caught his Vegas show in his very own theatre.

To be frank, this show may be not be everyone's cup of tea.  He is, after all, using puppets.  However, I'm a big fan!  His impressions of past & present performers, such as Cher, Dean Martin, Stevie Wonder & Adele are brilliant.  His comedy sketches are witty & current.  I thought it may have became a little edgy for some w/ one of his puppets "coming out the closet", but I thought it was hilarious.

Terry also sings a few original songs sans puppets during the show.  One entitled "Horses in Heaven" & the other a tribute to the troops.  "Horses in Heaven" is based on a true story of a child w/ cancer.  He mentioned to the audience that the Las Vegas powers that be thought  the song was too heavy & not appropriate for a Vegas show during it's development.  He defied the powers that be, and I enjoyed the song, which made me think of my own experience w/ cancer.  

Our show just happened to be the very one that surpassed 1 million guests to see Terry Fator's Vegas show.  Even better, everyone in attendance received a Terry Fator reusable bag w/ the following contents-

Terry Fator playing cards
2 for 1 at Mirage's Cravings buffet
$10 Free Slot Play w/ the Mirage Player's Card

I took that $10 Free Slot Play & magically turned it into $66 on a $1 slot machine!  Oh yeah, I'm good :)
It was my last night in Vegas, and capped an already great trip.

I highly recommend catching Terry Fator's show at the Mirage during your next trip to Vegas.  I laughed, I was moved & I had an absolute great time.

Excelsior!

Good grubbing of the island kine.

We had a quick breakfast pick up here during a recent visit in Vegas with friends and ordered up a lot of food.

Breakfast spread http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-kitchen-and-bar-las-vegas?select=_A6eqibhsvixKCuL55KR6g#zJ1UnVQ_qWLwg_wxRC-UXA  We got the basics Portugese sausage and eggs, lots of Spam musubi!  You cant go to a place called aloha kitchen and not get musubi's!  These were of good size and a nice thick cut of spam unlike same places there the ratio is more rice than spam.

Adobo fried rice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aloha-kitchen-and-bar-las-vegas?select=_A6eqibhsvixKCuL55KR6g#7HB73c6cPjKml2mVyEt2kw  This was a pretty tasty omelette with lots of adobo inside.  Def a must get!

I didn't actually go to pick up the order so I cant speak to how the place is.

Eyes ~ Wow that is a spread!
Nose ~ Smells Yum!.
Ear ~ Everyone happy with the food.
Mouth ~ These are all pretty ono!.
Tummy ~ Full and ready for the day!

The last time I was here was before The Doors cover band Strange Days show. I had a Rueben sandwich with fries. The service was great and the Rueben was excellent as well. I'll need to try different items the next time around based on some other Yelper reviews.

The one thing I love about coming to Crate & Barrel, is to watch them wrap things!

Someone told me that there's an old Jimmy Fallon skit, called Crate in a Barrel.  It purports to show the OCD lengths employees go to wrap something, so it will not break on your way home.  I love the concept.  I only wish we've had movers over the years who showed the same skill set.

This store is one of their modern two story varieties, with bedding and furniture downstairs,  Upstairs, they have a wedding planners dream.  Or, is it a Bride's dream list.  No matter, they have an electronic wedding registry here.  All very cool if you are planning your big day, or if you want to restock the kitchen or house after the kids moved out.  LOL

They have glassware, stemware, plates, dishes, knives, runners for the table and just about every kitchen gadget known.  I love their soups in a box, sauces and the mojito starter kit.  Just add crushed mint leaves.  Last week we purchased some closeouts. The pickup door is located conveniently outside near the Starbucks.

It was a spur of the moment thing and happy that it happened! I met up with Rand H, Norm R & Scott W to try the Reign of Thai buffet on a Sunday afternoon.

Every item in the buffet looked delish and fresh,  I tried a variety of things and enjoyed them all, egg rolls, chicken won tons, pad thai, beef massaman curry, chicken pangang curry just to name a few.   Massaman curry is my favorite curry, and normally I chose chicken but the beef was good too!

Service was friendly and learned from the server that it was her aunt and uncle who cooked all the dishes.

Sundays buffet was 10.99 and it is very much worth the price! If I am ever in the area again you bet I will be back!

A weekly gathering of Charlotte's finest food on wheels in Historic South End? Hell yes. Every Friday, at the corner of Camden and Park Ave, you'll find 10, or so, of Crown Town's local food trucks doling out the best street food our fair city has to offer. 

You're most likely to find the likes of:

Turkey And...
Papi Queso
Tin Kitchen
Cupcake Delirium
Southern Cake Queen
Herban Legend
Auto Burger
Sticks and Cones

and plenty others join the ranks on the regular. 

Parking is a disaster. Plain and simple. You're better off finding a parking space somewhere off of South, a nearby garage, or even going further down Camden or finding a space at Atherton. If the weather's nice, make a nice of walk of it. 

I'd recommend bringing some easy-to-carry chairs, a blanket, and a cooler of beers/water. Some of the trucks sell drinks (Papi Queso usually has a nice assortment) but some tend to not carry any. Common Market is an easy choice for a beverage, but get ready to stand in a long line if it's a busy FFF. 

I agree with Jeff S -- Check it out sometime!

I volunteered with a group from yelp to help with the "backpack for kids" program. Bins were organized along 2 sides and ready for us to gladly tackle it! We put on our handy dandy yelp finger-less gloves (thanks Drew!), grabbed a plastic bag, went down the line putting the amount posted on each food/drink bin in the bag and repeated the process until we were finished. It only took a couple of hours and together we packed over 3,200 bags! It's such a shame any child is hungry, but thank heavens for this program! These will go to children who might have nothing to eat over the weekend or when they are not at school. I had obviously heard of Three Square before, but I had no idea about this program as well the other volunteer opportunities available. I'm happy to have helped knowing how many kids were given meals and plan on volunteering here again! You should too! 

Check the calender on their website or call for upcoming opportunities that you can get involved in!

Considering the location of Bally's on the strip, it's pretty decent for the price you pay. This hotel is located right in the smack middle of the strip and is a short walking distance to most hotels. Back during the partying-on-a-budget days, my girlfriends and I would walk from Bally's all the way to Wynn/Encore in our FM heels with our classy red solo cups in hand no problem .

This hotel needs a renovation though! Some of the rooms still haven't even been upgraded to a flat-screen TV and the furniture is outdated.

The casino floor is chill and I love playing Wheel of Fortune in the "high limit slots" section. Let the dyke security guard strike up a conversation with you and she'll give you drink tickets for the bar :)

Popped in to give this place a try as I've heard nothing but good things about their chicken. And the raves are correct. This is really good chicken. A meaty chicken breast that was moist with a very crispy batter that wasn't so thick that it overwhelmed the chicken.

I got a two piece dinner, which came with a dinner roll, a small tub of cole slaw, some tater tots, some hushpuppies and the previously mentioned chicken - one wing and one breast. The tots were excellent. Not too greasy at all, but I was glad to have the one packet of ketchup for dipping.

This was a serious "fried" plate. If they could fry the cold slaw and the dinner roll, I'll bet they would have done so.

Note: This place is TAKE OUT ONLY. There is no dining area that I could see.

BESTEST CREPES. ME LIKEY.

I've experienced quite a few...multiple times...
These guys have mastered the Art of Crepe. Yes. It's a thing. 
Spot-on thickness. Splendid texture, akin to the dense-quality of a good pancake, yet not so doughy. Plus they've got an oh-so-delicate sweetness that allows for versatility as far as making these beauties sweet or savory.  



*Dark chocolate, caramel, sea salt crepe - FAN-frickin-TASTIC. My most-ordered crepe from here. The one that I dream about at night. I no lie. 

*Pumpkin mascarpone pecan crepe - SEASONAL, sigh. 

*Lemon curd and whipped cream crepe - in the words of my dear, econ-majoring friend: "THE TANGENCY!" (for the mathaphobes out there - this is code for: she loved it)

*Apples and caramel and pecan crepe - one of their greatest. (certainly on par with the dark chocolate one I crave every waking moment of my life) the sugary deliciousness of the caramel...with the sweet crunch from the apples and the indulgent flavor of the pecans - love.

*Smoked prosciutto spinach parmesan scrambled - this is the one savory crepe I've dabbled into, though this was my friend's order so I only took a few bites. Tasty nonetheless. 



As far as beverages: I've had their peppermint tea. Check mate. And their chai latte can't be beat. The Art of Crepe carries over to the Art of Latte/latte art - they've got this down man. Delicious AND beautiful bevvies. 

Basically, I love you Bradbury. One of my favorite spots - to study/chill/gastronomically indulge - in Madison.

Psst...over here, pal. Youz like da slices do youz? Well, here's a little secret just between youz and me pal ... Down a non-descript hallway lined with album covers in the Cosmopolitan Hotel youz can find Secret Pizza. 

No matter how much you lose in Vegas, save $5 for some 5-star pizza. Shanon Y. was right about the White Sauce Cheese Pizza. It's a pizzagasm in your mouth of grease, cheese, and crust. 

There is only enough room for a few places to stand and eat at Secret Pizza ... Lots of families and groups were buying whole pies and chowing down in the hallways and lounge areas. It has no sign. It has no name, but the secret is out about Secret Pizza.

If you haven't figured it out by now, what makes this pool memorable is the Lazy River section.

If floating around and mingling with others is not your kinda thing or if you have the family with you, MGM definitely has many other pools to relax in.  

During my last visit here, there were kids in our group. Most people would tell you to leave the kids by the other pool, but they weren't my kids so it went kinda like this ...


Water Gun + Adorable 6 year old + Lazy River + "Shoot Her" = Ultimate Wingman


Get there early, snag a spot in the shade or somewhere near Wet Republic, hop in the lazy river then drink and mingle the day away.  


I can't think of a better way to spend a hot day in Vegas.  

I'm lying. I can but this is definitely top 10.


PS - don't be lazy. They have a ton of restrooms

Swirly Q!!! A cute name and a great location make this yogurt spot fantastic!  My supervisor found a flyer with a coupon that benefited a student organization and advertised the grand opening of Swirly Q across the street from UNLV in the same center as Cafe Rio and the Post Office.  I have longed for a frozen yogurt place nearby for quite some time, hoping it would happen in the Student Union.  When we found out Swirly Q was opening, it became something to look forward to at the end of this excruciatingly long week for our office.

We just got back and all I can say is HAPPINESS!!!  There are quite a few flavor choices, tons of toppings, friendly service, and the place is sparkling clean!  I think we will be making this a Friday tradition.

Also, we were chanting "Swirly Q" on the way through the parking lot, and one of their crew handed us 3 $1 off coupons to use for next time, seemingly amused by our excitement.  It is just such a good name, as my supervisor has one of those old fashioned names like "Mary Ann" or "Tina Marie."

Well of course you're named after a Saint. After all, you are simply heavenly! I LOVED my visit to St. Francis. Just like I loved the first year of Charlie's Angels when Farrah was on. Just like I loved Chachi and not Joanie. Just like I love smooth and not chunky. I was honored to have a tour of St. Francis by Mr. Aaron Chamberlain himself. He pointed out the architectural details and history of his career. Right down to family serving spoons used in his grandparents restaurant embedded in to the brick near the front door. The sleek, glass garage door which opens up to Camelback. If you're sitting outside you have a panoramic view of the interior and if you're inside you get a bird's eye view of the street scape. 

The second story (which is in limbo and awaiting a mural and a more defined purpose) is structurally held in place by a "V" shaped collection of steel rods...unfreakinreal! The birch floors on the stairs, the gravel on the patio, the maple beams, the seemless glass front table...I'm having an interior design orgasm! 

Oh. The food? Yep! Yummers! Thin crust pizzas with a airy, pillow crust...tried an arrugula za and had one with figs! The signature salad with a homemade buttermilk dressing (DON'T THINK RANCH!)...it's so much more and the goat cheese brulee made my mouth, my tummy and my soul very happy! You can feel the love from the kitchen as well as an attentive, enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff.

You're like my foodie angel, arriving in CenPho to save fme rom Applebee's and Sweet Tomatoes! I say Halo St. Francis. Halo and welcome to the hood!

As one of my fave English bands, ABC says, "It's so hip, so hip it hurts"...hurts...but in a good way. Like a naughty spanking. Not a big toe contusion hurt. First off, this place smelled delightful, like vanilla and lavender with a little Nag Champa thrown in...no weird old Auntie's closet smell here! We were greeted by a young Carol Burnett look alike which is awesome! Especially since Carol Burnett grew up in Hollywood and went to Hollywood High School.  But the flow of the store and the quality of their wares is top drawer! 

Overall, very well organized. Good flow. Did I mention it smells good? Amazing selection of purses. No, I'm not looking to buy a purse. I'm a he man after all. I just thought some were so cute I wanted to squeeze them. Um. Anyway. The mens section is not bad, lots of XL and not so much small  though...wondering who sold them these clothes? Big, brawny bowlers? Not sure.

And for you nun collectors, you can't miss out on an entire area of nun bric a brac! Very fun! Like book stores, card shops and Hello Kitty Conventions, I could spend hours in here! 

Hollywood was my home for many years. Great to have some of the glam and glitz here in Phoenix!

Another swingers club. Oy vey! After escaping the skanky and famous Green Door, I did NOT want to go next door to this place next to the gay bar, it looked like another weird unsanitary adult entertainment place, but my adventurous friend was like, oh come on, let's look!

The owner personally gave us a tour. Skanky exterior, gorgeous interior. I don't know how the hell they hose that baby down after a night of orgylicious whatnot, but it's all here, flat screen TVs, handcarved wood furniture, rugs, curtains, nice!

The spa is super clean and contemporary furnishings with pleeeenty of space for voyeurs to sit around their super clean looking jacuzzi. The bathrooms and lockers appeared clean too.

It was pretty dead the night we went, but it was before their soft opening, very very new club, can't wait until it becomes a scene. I was informed that this is a very safe club, no one can touch you or they get booted, no booze allowed, but they sell soft drinks and coffee. I still wouldn't make out at a swingers club, not my style, but I wish them luck and I'll be back to visit and gawk like the nerd I am.

OMG DD! OMG! I'm eating my roast beef sandwich now, typing this review and pounding my hands on the table like Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally...moaning, groaning and achieving culinary orgasms. 

Now that's a pretty picture for ya!

House roasted roast beef with a blue cheese horseradish spread, red onion, tomato and my favorite green next to Brian Austin Green...arugula! All served on a yummy artisan roll. 

Such a cute place with a case FULL of delicious looking temptations from crab cakes to mashed sweet potatoes to chocolates and cheeses and VINO!! Great staff...friendly and helpful. Why I'm even a proud card carrying member of their sandwich club. And I'm sure it won't take me long to earn that free heavenly sandwich!

I was first introduced to Tomos in celebration of my brother and my girlfriend's birthday.  Since then, it's become my favorite sushi joint in the west valley!

Tomos keeps their restaurant dimly lit and there's plenty of bar space [sushi and alcohol] available.  I've only been here for dinner so I have yet experienced their lunch or Happy Hour special but I can't imagine those being anything less than delicious.  

For appetizers, their monkey balls, soft shell crab, the ninja jalapenos, and oyster shooters are delicious [warning:  raw quail egg].  Some of my favorite rolls are the Passion of Fire [pity they don't bring this lit on fire anymore], the Dysart Roll, Crunch Roll, Cowboy Roll, Dragon Roll, Spider Roll, and Popcorn Lobster.  The sashimi is always thickly cut and Ocean Salad is great too.

While Tomos isn't the absolute best place for sushi, if you're in the west valley, it's probably your safest bet for fresh sushi.

Outstanding cuts from a true artisan butcher shop.  

The high fell below 95, it's time to grill.  Yelp ROTD to the rescue.  The Butcher Block.  USDA prime, wet aged selections including a great boneless NY strip, and filet, and outstanding porterhouse.  All are very well trimmed and tender.  They also offer butcher cuts (sirloin and flat iron steaks).  Good beefy flavor.

Dry aged selections are OK but lacking the deep flavor expected of a craft aging room  Mild umame and nutty flavor.  Not too pronounced.   Good fat and marbling.  UDSA prime rib eye aging so subtle the flavor is robbed by the charcoal grill

Pass on the American Kobe style wagyu.  All cut totally miss the mark in fat content, marbling, looks and most importantly, flavor.

Lamb; great selection of chops, tenderloins, legs, shanks, Frenched racks, and ground lamb.  Good strong lamb flavor throughout.   

They do offer frozen, the game meats: antelope, buffalo rib eyes, chuck roast, burgers, rack of elk, elk tenderloins,  quail, wild duck, rabbit, venison, gator, wild boar.  Beyond the scope of this grilling session.  Will update after trying a few.

Finally their home made sausage.  Just get them and try them.  Flavorful, well seasoned.  Excellent.

Fair prices (better than Whole Foods).  Call ahead to avoid disappointment

A foodie and griller's heaven.

Got tickets from Tix4tonight for tickets on the same day of the show... they seat you based on 1st come 1st served unless you upgraded & paid more $$ to be in the VIP sections.

Had so much fun here, the show is kinda cheesy but it's all clean fun with HOT HOT guys! =)

The guys here are HOT HOT HOT!! =) +1

I like the way the stage is setup here..not only is it the front stage but there's a part of the stage where they can walk out into the audience more. +1

The guys interacted with the audience a LOT LOT more than at Chippendale. +1

If you want to sit closer to the stage or in the middle of the seating area, you have to pay more for those seats. =(

The main guys knew how to dance but the ones at the end of the line were just there for eye candy; that's just fine with me.. =) +1

Great for bachelorette parties/ just girlie get togethers =)

FYI: check in on Yelp App for some kool freebies ;)

Not worth it at all!

Unless you have a half-off coupon, Wicked Spoon was barely par with the $20 buffets at the cheap hotels. Sure they have some fancy "looking" items, but they all fell flat. And at the premium price point, you'd expect some crab legs or a big seafood station but not here nor there was it found. 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=gSJmRozD1spFYGe8yhzPQA#gSJmRozD1spFYGe8yhzPQA

It was definitely the worst "fancy" buffet in Vegas I've been to.

We like AJs, and generally enjoy shopping in them. 

We were over this way and decided to stop in for a couple of items. As the three of us wandered the aisles, we were more than taken aback by some of the prices. They seemed even higher than our local AJs. It  never occurred to me that different stores, had different prices.

Well this led to an interesting discussion on how to rate this AJs? In terms of hard to find upscale products, or for variety, hands down all AJs are Four Stars. Particularly, if price is no object. 

But in the real world, where price and value do matter; they're the Needless-Markup (Neimann Marcus) of food retailers. For instance, a bottle of wine which I normally pay $18.99, was going for $24.99 here.

So, Two Stars for price and value, and yes, we've experienced better. I wonder if Oakville will ever considering coming back?

Vegas marches on and in a few months, Osteria del Circo is closing.

Part of famed restaurateur Sirio Maccioni's empire.  Circo offers Italian inspired food with a few hidden gems of true authenticity.  But first:

RANT:  In whose mind is this an "osteria"?  An osteria, the simplest, most austere type of Italian eatery.  Pastas, grilled or roasted meats, endless glasses of house wine. Good, simple living.  With it's beautifully crafted dishes, whimsical, lake side dining room, 900 selection wine cellar, this is not an osteria.

Searching for the authentic, an excellent fritto misto.  Lightly coated, perfectly cooked, crisp fried calamari zucchini flowers with a vibrant cherry tomato sauce.   The Antipasto del Circo per La Tavola is equally simple and delicious.  A good selection of Italian cheese, cured salumi and fruits.  

For secondi, the most classic of pastas shine.  The Buccatini al Amatriciana near Roman perfect.  Toothsome, fresh pasta enveloped with an acidic sauce of pancetta, tomato, wine and pecorino romano.  Not to be outdone, the Gnocchi al Pesto Gratinati.  Perfect pillows in a warm, herbaceous pesto tossed with Parmigianino.  A velvety rich bite accented by toasted pine nuts for texture.

Finally the Bistecca alla Fiorentina.  Although not from the famed Chianina cow of Tuscany, the 40 day aged porterhouse for two, cooked very rare and dressed simply with olive oil is excellent.  Festive, fun to eat.  Nuff said.  The rack of lamb with a pecorino and thyme crust is equally good.  Very meaty, well trimmed, tender and perfectly cooked throughout.  

Good plate of flavorful biscotti and some vin santo make for a classic dessert.

Very good, friendly and efficient service.  Excellent Italian centric wine list with many reasonably priced bottle from a wide variety of DOCGs.

As we sip our amaro, the words of Anthony Bourdain ring true:  "Into each life a little bitterness".

Farewell Circo.  Ciao grazie.

Coca~Cola... Iconic. Powerful. Unique.  Why did you have to make this place? In Lost Wages of all places, you may know it as Sin City, or a debaucherous den of sex drugs gambling and prostitution... ohhhh wait, what a PERFECT place to put a family destination =D

Pro Tip: Free Samples... great if you drink the fizzy stuff... and some are floats!!!

Why didn't I think of that? I guess that is why I don't get paid the big bucks... regardless this place is the ultimate homage to the power of swag and branding... I do not know of a single other item that is universally known in every corner of the globe nearly half as well as coke... It's everywhere. The only thing crazier is the weirdo's who want all of the coke swag...

Pro Tip #2: Leave your tooth in coke overnight and it will dissolve =X

So if when I still drank soda, I would have been here, I would have enjoyed it much more than as I got older and realized how evil and bad for you coke really is. At this point, I use it more as a solvent than anything else...

Pro Tip #3: Clean grease off your garage floor, car engine parts, or battery terminals by soaking it in coke or another type of soda, preferably flat...

None the less for all of my tongue in cheek stuff about coke, it is an awesome story and they have a lot of accomplishments for a company... I just think this is a poor choice for a Coke themed facility as I would have thought it was more child oriented. 

Overall this is an interesting place to visit and not half as cheesy as the M&M joint nearby. None the less... it is what it is...

Saw this place on Bar Rescue and happened to be going to Vegas the following weekend. We wanted a change-up from the touristy scene so we came to Bar 702. Lisa the manager was very friendly and working her butt off!
I sat down and played video poker for about 20 min, doubled my money, then got some drinks and listened to the band. My friend enjoyed her cocktail; I cant' remember the name of it but it was tasty.
The band was ok...I thought they could have played a few more hits as opposed to Allman Brothers deeper tracks but they weren't terrible.

The place was tough to find in the strip mall that it was located in, and we didn't order any food either but if you want a place off the beaten touristy areas and you are a fan of dive bars and live music you will enjoy it here...

So kids, if you've been following along at home, you know Uncle Georgie thinks most fast food places can only strive for a 3 Star rating or worst. 

Uniformity at fast good places in my opinion make it impossible to offer a Four Star, or Eccck... a Five Star rating. Sorry, Yum Brands!  

But this isn't a ghetto location and the employees aren't brain dead. On the contrary, they're all very nice and friendly. Especially Mallory up front and Becky the Manager who went out of their way. Nice!

As for the food, it's okay. The Tacos were good, as for the cheese Pizza Hut pizza, while being slightly undercooked it was also A-Okay. 

BTW, I had no problems getting a cup for water. So that must have been an isolated incident the other reviewers had on their visit. 

So Three Stars, A-Okay

I came here to celebrate my nephews 3rd birthday. The park is nestled in a neighborhood of houses. Since the park is dog friendly, I brought my dog, Brownie along for the party. I walked her on a trail that went around the park as well took her over to the large grassy area the park has to interact with the other dogs there. The grassy area isn't fenced in, so I was surprised at how many pet owners had their dogs off leashes, tsk tsk. The bathroom is large and has entry on either side of the building for males and females. They have an area where the kiddos can get wet, but unfortunately the day we were there the wind was blowing and it was cold, so most of the kids played at the playground. The playground is nice even though the swings were roped off for repair and I am a girl who loves to swing so that was a bummer! The park was clean and the area that was reserved for the party was spacious enough with a shade structure and the nearby bathrooms, BBQ grill and trash cans were convenient. They also have a small skate park too, but I didn't make it over to check it out fully. The water fountains were clean and lights came on in the park after a certain hour and lit everything up fine. All in all a decent neighborhood park.

Everything about this place is out of the norm in a very good and inviting way. Major points on the curb appeal from rock wall to innovative use of nostalgic wooden letter blocks as signage. The attention to detail is refreshing and appreciated.  The interior is welcoming and the creative use of space is impressive. How does one fit a lounge, bar and dinning area in such a tight space and mitigate claustrophobia? This is worthy of an HGTV episode.  Tuck has done it & done it well!
 
The menu is just as creative and unique in its own right. I've enjoyed the roasted grape crostini, chorizo stiffed dates, mac & cheese w/lobstah, special meatloaf with potatoes & chorizo and the chocolate cheese cake. All hit high marks for flavor, portion and presentation. The service is consistently impeccable from courteous host to attentive but non-intrusive servers. I always feel welcomed and appreciated!  

Tuck Shop is in my top five places I love and enjoy introducing to friends, co-workers, and out of town guests. It holds a very warm place in my heart with many fun and special memories.

Fat Heads makes some seriously fat/phat sandwiches.

I got a crazy good grease-wich when I came here in December. An artery clogger combination of egg, cheese, Linguia, thick bread, and other random elements of pure tastiness.

Each bite was worth the 10 dribbles of grease that would drip out onto my crumpled collection of napkins.

If you're in the area and looking for a fun rowdy place to watch a Steelers game with good food - def stop at Fat Heads. If you're looking for a "fill you up, can barely move once you're done" -  meal -  check out Fat Heads. If you're looking for a nice selection of unique beer brews - come to Fat Heads.  If you're looking for a casual place to catch up with friends - over a massive plate of nachos - go to Fat Heads  (though be prepared to wait awhile if it's game night.)

If you're looking for something light and some peace and quiet - - eh.....- you may want to head elsewhere.

This is my favorite store in the entire valley. So many new things to look at everytime you enter the store, the staff is so friendly, trade in prices are fair and I love their cafe. Grab a book and a coffee or a sandwich and relax on a couch. I go there for my expanding video game collection as well and every time I go in there is so much new inventory I feel like its a whole new store to dig through. Check this place out. The classic nick nacks alone is enough reason to pop in and look around. There is absolutely something for everyone.

Hi. My name is Drew and I have lactose intolerance. Why should you care? Bc I NEVER eat ice cream or gelato... besides AOF. Given, the above statement means I don't have much experience judging gelato, I still think it means a lot that I roll the dice to eat the lovely creamy goodness from AOF. 

From my first time here, a blind tasting, to subsequent visits ordering specialties like cinnamon toast crunch and blueberry pancake, I always leave wanting more. The price is right. The owners are on hand and friendly. What else can you ask for? Then again, I can see how it can be hit or miss, bc your fave flavor from last time might not be there on your next visit, but I've always found a nice substitute. Do it.

About twelve of us came here for an iced tea business lunch. You know what I'm talking about. We also enjoyed a lively discussion about all things, including the food which we enjoyed. 

We had several appetizers, including the Chicken Satay, Calamari, Pot Stickers and Edamami and pitcher after pitcher of their delicious iced tea. LOL. 

All of us thought they did a nice job. The only question mark was with their Meat Loaf, or was it pot roast. But the Steaks, Filet Mignon, Fish, and Burgers were all very tasty and cooked to order. 

Expect to pay $35 each and thank you to that corporate card. LOL. We will be back.

"If you need me I'll be watching CSI from the bathtub." 

And that's exactly what I did thanks to the nice little TV on the wall in the bathroom. 

With this all suites hotel connected to Mandalay Bay I was quite pleased when we rolled in. After watching 'The Hangover' 50 times I've had an urge to step up the Vegas game and while we didn't wake up with a tiger in the bathroom I can say this was one of the nicest rooms I've had in my 20+ trips to Vegas. 

Two sinks in the main bathroom. Very nice shower and the deepest of bathtubs. Two big ass flat screen TVs in the bedroom and living room. Extra bathroom off the living room in case you have a friend who is ready to blow chunks from too much partying. 

Our view from the 24th floor had me drunkenly staring from the Mandalay pools to the neighboring hotels and off into the hills. Gorgeous. 

What an amazing stay, I could have slept the rest of my life away in that bed. So comfortable. 

People say Mandalay Bay is a nice hotel... Next time you hear that just say "Pshhhh, I'll be in THEhotel. Mandalay Bay standard is for chumps." Pretty good episode of CSI too.

Hell to the yes for the excellent bottle service received at Tao!  Chris and Paige straight hooked it up for us.  Caught a deal: buy 2 bottles and get comp'd one free.  We settle for a bottle of henny, ketel, and our comp'd bottle was no Popov.  Belvadere! Whoohoo!

The entire night liquor pours, we're feelin the beats, security at our side, and all the while never having our mixers less than halfway full.  They were on top of it.  Everytime our group left to explore, our bottles were immediately placed in the back, and brought back out to us when we returned.  

And after the club, the courtesy does not end.  A text message to me hoping our time at Tao was to our expectations! The next day an email to my husband thanking us for partying with Tao.  

A heads-up to those considering bottle service here: the minimum quoted to you does not include tax and tip.  Gratuity is at 20% so keep that in mind.  Loved my experience here, and will definitely be back.

I wished Bellagio had an electroshock therapy vendor to administer temporary memory loss.  That way I could forget about every other Cirque show I've seen and "O" would blow my mind like it did the first time I saw it in 2002.  Sign me up and please hand me that rubber thing that stops me from biting my tongue.

The writer and director of the show, Franco Dragone, is freakin brilliant!  How in the world does one conceptualize a show like this and then explain to others how it's all supposed to work without being shoved into a windowless van with a one way trip to the funny farm?  I can only imagine the conversations he had before it got the green light:


Dragone: "So honey, it'll be a stage that will change from a big assed pool with 1.5 million gallons of water and back into a dry stage that can be walked on  throughout the show.  And then there will be a ton of synchronized swimmers and the theatre is going to look like a 14th century opera house.  I was thinking during dinner last night that there should be a guy in the show that will set himself on fire."

Mrs. Dragone: "Yes, dear. (rolls eyes)  Don't forget to mow the lawn tomorrow.  We have company this weekend."    


Later in the day....


Dragone: "Aerialists! Clowns! Contortionists! Trapeze! People on a Russian swing and swimmers everywhere!  Sometimes it will all happen at the same time!  Lots of leotards too!"

Dragone's ex-college roommate: "Yeah, yeah.  Sounds sweet.  Pass the bong already."


Sure, there are detractors that say it's too pretentious and artsy fartsy.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  After all these years, "O" is still inspiring, a welcome escape from reality, and a "can't miss" show in town.

I've been here a couple of times. It's decent cheap food. The owner's like to call it the Italian Chipotle. 

Basically you go thru the line like an assembly line and order your pasta and then the toppings and then pay. I think the angel hair pasta works perfectly for this type of eatery. First timers usually get crazy and load up on the toppings. I just get a meat item and some marinara sauce. They give you a bunch of pasta in your bowl so you won't leave that place hungry.

There is a lot of hype about this place and although it is a good time, it is not very different than any of the other pool parties in Vegas, but with a lot more expense.

One piece of advice though, DO NOT OPEN A BAR TAB ESPECIALLY IN THE CABANA BOTTLE SERVICE AREA.  They will over charge you for drinks that you either did not order or that are different than the posted menu rates at the venue and shown on their website.  This is how the waitresses make their money.  Do not tip before you get the bill.  They will add it to your bill anyways and deny the cash you forked over earlier in the day. If you dispute the charges, they will threaten to arrest you with Vegas PD at the premises.  You do not need this kind of argument at the end of what you thought was an enjoyable day.  And the MGM will not get involved to help settle the dispute unless you charge your bill through your room.

Spread the word fellow Yelpers, its not worth the trouble or expense.

I'm giving the Bobcats 3 stars because I don't love them, but yet I don't hate them.  Unless they are playing the Magic or the Heat...  I still don't hate them then...  I just don't want them to win.

I was able to see the Bobcats play the Magic in the playoffs back in 2010 in Orlando and it was such a fun and wonderful experience.  Luckily, my team (the Magic) won and we beat them by a pretty decent margin.  The final score that night was 92 - 77.

I did enjoy seeing the Bobcats play.  I love the NBA and I'm on a mission to be able to see every team play in person.  Hopefully I'll be able to accomplish that in my lifetime.  What was really super cool about this game is that Michael Jordan himself was there!  I was SO stoked about that!  I kept pointing and telling my husband throughout the entire game, "There's Michael Jordan!  There's Michael Jordan!"  I mean, I didn't get to meet him or anything as awesome as that, but we had great seats and I was able to see him the entire time.  I'm not sure if I did more basketball watching or Michael Jordan watching.  LOL

Even though I'm not a fan, the Bobcats are a good team and I'm still very happy I was able to see them play in person!   =)

Never, ever, ever again. Ever. 

Because even if I think your coffee blows, and even if I only gave you three stars (*gasp*), there's no excuse for talking shit about me -- loudly -- while I am forking over $10 for a sandwich. That's just a poor customer service decision, folks. As business owners, you should know that. 

And just for clarification, I never wrote that your coffee tastes like shit. But I will now: Your coffee tastes like shit. 

So, no more $12 chef salads. No more $3 croissants. And definitely no more of your fake-nice bitchiness or dirty looks when I walk by in the morning with my Cartel coffee. I will save my money for an establishment that treats me like a person.

PS -- look forward to a severe business decline as soon as the place across the way opens. I'll make sure to smile and wave as I walk by.

Comme Ca translates as not poorly or not bad ... and that's exactly what Comme Ca restaurant at The Cosmopolitan is ... not too bad.

The restaurant was empty and bar quiet when we popped in for some Happy Hour drinks and appetizers. Service was quick cause, seriously, there wasn't many other patrons.

Select cocktails are $7.50 during Happy Hour. I tried two. The Penicillin Cocktail with Scotch, Ginger, Lemon Juice, Honey, and an Islet Float was sweet and smooth. It could of used another 1/2 ounce of whiskey, but was fine. The lone vodka HH option is a cocktail called Fair Trade with Lemon and Simple Syrup. It was fair.

For nibbles, Olivia Z. and me split an order of the Grilled Beef Tongue ($6). The side of Lemon Aioli and sprinkles of Sea Salt really meshed well with the tender slices of tongue. We both liked it a lot even though the slices were a tad too thick. Oysters on the Half Shell are $2 each during Happy Hour. We got six with two different kinds. I forget the names, but one Pacific Ocean and the other was Atlantic. The Pacific were smaller, but better.

When it comes to Comme Ca for Happy Hour, it is kind of comme si comme ca.

I've been to Erased three times now. Time for my review and I'll post some before and after pics. I echo previous reviews in the location being clean and nice. Erased uses the NaturaLase QS 2J laser which is state of the art. Contrary to popular belief, It doesn't hurt as bad as you would think. The technology has come a long way thankfully. I had a black tattoo removed many many years ago and that was full blown torture... and that was WITH numbing cream and I have a high pain tolerance. Couldn't imagine it without that cream... Geez! The doctor had to physically hold my foot down and it took everything within me to not kick that doctor in the face it hurt so bad! And you could smell your skin burning in the room. It was downright awful! I'm so appreciative of the fact that the tattoo removal experience is not like that anymore because to be honest, I don't know if I could do it again. Certain ink colors hurt worse than others and if the tattoo is near a bone or on a sensitive area, you might feel more pain but it's over so fast, it won't even phase you. If you could handle getting the tattoo in the first place, you can definitely handle the removal process so don't be a puss people! If you want to get it done, do it! And better yet, do it at Erased!

I'm saying goodbye to "the only tattoo that mom's like" (Tigger & Winnie the Pooh) along with a daisy with a peace sign in the middle on my butt and a daisy on my toe (the friendship tattoo curse). Sayonara to all these mistakes! I'm not regretting this decision one bit. I promise to post pics of my progress along the way for all to see.

Whoever invented this Monorail System is a GENIUS!!!!!!! :D

My friend and I paid for a 24 hour pass and it was only $12 each!!!!! What a deal!! This is way cheaper than a cab, and you don't have to worry about driving around in the horrible Vegas traffic or getting DUIs. 

The Monorail system is very quick and efficient. It is computer operated so it is available even during late/early hours of the night. On Saturday I remember they said it would be available every 5 minutes... but on Sunday it was available once every 7 minutes. I was there during Memorial's Day Weekend so the timing probably varies depending on how busy it is... but the wait definitely isn't too bad at all. 

They have 7 stops: MGM Grand, Bally's/Paris, Flamingo/Caesar's Palace, Harrah's/The Quad, LV Convention Center, Las Vegas Hotel and Sahara. From these stops, you can basically walk to any of the other hotel, casino and attractions on the Strip!!! 

I wish we had something like this back in college!!!

Triple D Stamped. 

Fried Oysters reeled me in. My aunt suggested this place and a fried oyster po'boy sounded good to me! Bun- super soft, lots of fried yumminess. I split a sandwich with my mom so i could have room for their famous bananas' fosters bread pudding. 

as i write this review, i just fcking realized that i didn't get their famous banana fosters BREAD PUDDING, but their plain banana's fosters. I guess i was still suffering from the 8 hour traffic jam we were stuck in earlier and maybe a bit hypnotized by the cutie server we had, but yeah, i ended up with a dessert i didn't order. I didn't love it either, but i'm sure i would have loved their bread pudding version Damn it!!! 
I guess i'll have to make my way back to get that dessert one day!

Green has the best vegan food in Phoenix. Weather or not if you are vegan, there is something there for you. Very artsy inside, fantastic staff, amazing "soynamis" AKA a vegan DQ Blizzard. They have a small grocery area in the front as well, all vegan but all amazing. I always get their special without even looking and have never been let down. The spicy Po Boy, and the Mexicali Burger are my fav off the menu, you also get a side and I never stray from the delicious curry pasta salad. On top of it all, they are very fair priced, 2 meals, 2 drinks, and 2 deserts, usually runs about $20. That's great for in house made healthy food.

This Crate & Barrel is one of their two level versions, with a large display of furniture upstairs. It also is a nice compliment to the Pottery Barn across in Scottsdale Quarter. 

Since I work nearby, we're always stopping here to browse after a Starbucks run. The staff is incredibly nice and very helpful. They will go out of their way to order, or call another store to find any out of stock item for you.

Then of course is their world class wrapping.  I know this might seem trivial compared with the high end retailers found in Kierland, but it is especially true for Crate & Barrel. Nothing has ever broken in a bag they pack, no matter how fragile.  

A very nice shopping experience. Enjoy!

I had a gift card and decided to place an order for pick-up. This CPK is located in Town Square. There is a pick-up door, but if there is parking near it I couldn't find it. Crowded is the proper word for Town Square! With no parking spot in sight and tons of people wandering around, hubby dropped me off out front. I was greeted when I walked in and the food was ready. The pizza came in a to-go carrier with handles that was very convenient. I ordered the "Untraditional Cheese Pizza" priced at $9.75 that was cheesy and good. Most pizzas with more than one cheese have a smokey type of cheese on it and this one didn't, which I loved. Simple and good! 

You can place your pick-up order over the phone or online. The online ordering is very user friendly.

I'm ashamed to share that my 10-year old bike still has the hair on the tires, AND the tires were flat from having been in my storage shed for 6 years. Figured it was a good idea to get a tune up (and a helmet) before trying to ride again! 

The shop owner was so nice! $40 for the tune up and even though it was going to be ready later that day, he advised I leave it a bit to make sure the tires didn't need a new tube (they didn't). 

He patiently showed me how to put the bike rack on my car - even though I didn't buy it from him, I just brought it from home. 

He didn't try to sell me the most expensive option of the accessories and in the end, I got a tune up, a helmet, a bike lock and a headlight for $128 (including tax). 

He taught me about the gears on my bike and gave me a map of all the bike paths in Phoenix! All the while, charming banter. I feel like I've made a new friend! 

Not only can you buy bicycles and any accessory you may need for your bike at this little shop on Hatcher Road, I understand you can rent bikes here too; and, the shop is right by the canal so if you don't already own a bike but feel like riding, this would be a great launching point. 

Of course, I SAY that... let's see if I actually get on mine now...

I've been going to Casa Filipina for about four years and have always been pleased with the food. I've tried a variety of dishes like the Crispy Pata, Adobo, Caldereta, Menudo, Pancit, Chicken Inasal, etc.  They have Karaoke on Friday nights and a small three piece band plays on the weekend. They tried to get me to sing Karaoke but it takes more than a couple of bottles of liquid courage to get me singing.

My favorite dish is the Menudo. This is made with pork, carrots and potatoes served in a sauce. This dish has a similar look to the American Beef Stew dish. In addition, they serve this meal with rice and Pancit Bihon. The best way to eat this dish is to dump the menudo on top of the rice. I always say "Masarap, Busog na ako" after eating this meal. Did I mentioned that they give you plenty of food? They give you more rice if you run out of it, but I have never had that problem.

They also run a bakeshop that has all of the traditional Filipino sweets. My asawa especially enjoys the Halo Halo. And she always loads up on the sweets to take home for future consumption.

The Husband and wife team that own Casa Filipina do a great job and keep the prices fair. So check out Casa Filipina, you're taste buds will thank you.

Yanni's Gyros impressed me. I ordered a Lamb Gyro and let me just say, holy sh!t that thing was f'ing huge! It was packin! I have a BIG mouth and still I was struggling. I felt like I needed to summon my inner garter snake and dislocate my jaw to eat the damn thing. It was gigantic! And YEP... That's what she said! *snicker*

So... absolutely NO ordering the gyros if you are on a first date here ladies! On second thought, that includes you men too! That is, unless you want to show off your skillz getting down and dirty with your big mouth. Small mouths need not apply! Unless, of course, you want to get all dainty and show off your badass table manners with your plastic knife and fork cuz that would be equally impressive. Haww!

Summary: Big portion size? Check. Good food? Check. Cash register lady nice? Check.

Scoreboard:  BB 1 - Gyro 0
It sure put up a good struggle but I let that thing have it!!! That thing didn't stand a chance!

My Advice: Bring your big ol' mouth and appetite over to Yanni's Gyros and they will not disappoint. Be prepared to get nickel and dimed over their yummylicious tzatziki sauce though. It's 50 cents a pop for a small plastic container of it. It is good though, like people say, and I guess they know it. 

Hold tight, Yanni. It was good for me too! I'll be back for more real soon next time I am feelin the need for all that tasty Greek meat. ;)

Charlie's has 4 to 5 star potential... Neither my complaints nor my compliments seem to be new to anything anyone else has said but I am egomaniacal so I will go ahead and write them again.

They are hip and fun. Dancing for the cowboys and everyone else...as long as you can two step. I was scolded for dancing in a manner that was not the two step...when my dance partners and I cleared it left no one on the dance floor. Yup we were the only ones out there. An empty Dance floor is better than one with non two steppers it turns out.

The crowd is good though and you don't have to be intimidated if you are not a cowboy (so long as you are a non-cowboy who can two-step). The drinks are strong and cheap. I went on Friday and they were 75 cents! Mmm cheap booze.

The patio is amazing and tent like and temperature controlled. A smoker's paradise.

The women folk were asked to take their purses and leave them in the car...you know cuz cowboys don't carry purses. 

I have been more than once, would easily return again but I can think of more laid back places and laid back is more conducive to fun. Oh on the weekends they do have awesome carne asada outside. I am headed there right now.

No! 

Listen, Vegas..I love you, I live in you, you are  my soulmate, you make me great food, you're cheap, you're hot, and you're pretty.....That being said, STOP trying to change into something you're not!!

I get it.. Downtown is cleaning up, getting trendy..I am all on board with it.. I am even embracing the hipsters , or are they still the regular DT homeless?  I can't tell, they both dress in ripped clothing and don't shower.. 

I have even grown to love Commonwealth and their over priced drinks made by *cringe* mixologists.. I'm trying, but I usually just hangout at The Griffin or Insert Coins until the terrible DJs show up. 

but La Comida, has no excuse to be pretentious and grossly over priced. It is a Mexican Restaurant off Fremont.   It's great to makeover downtown to a cool artsy, hip town..but does that mean I have to pay $10 for a beer and a million dollars for tasteless ceviche?  My friends and I went here for the restaurants first brunch,  they ordered what was a sad attempt at a breakfast burrito, which looked suspiciously like the ones from McDonalds, and I had some dry tasteless French Toast that cost me $15..  Sighhh..  

I will stick to one of the other dozen AUTHENTIC Downtown Mexican restaurants.. I will gladly substitute the trendy atmosphere and crappy over priced food for a hole in the wall, cheap delicious experience.    

My darling Vegas, being trendy doesn't mean you have to be lazy,expensive, and pretentious. If I wanted that,  I wouldn't have left that bitch L.A. to be with you.

Over the last decade, we've had a few problems with our Lexus cars.  And, now for the rest of the story...

About eight years ago I was driving our five year old RX-300 from Seattle to Chicago, so one of our kids could use it at college.  We were outside of Bismarck, ND when all the lights on the dash lit up warning us that the car was about to fail.  The nearest dealership at that time was in St Paul, MN.  Yeah, I know LOL.

So after calling Lexus for advice, off we drove very nervously to MN.  We arrived safely around 5pm and waited nearly three hours for them to look at the car.  It was confirmed that the RX had some sort of unknown oil sludge build-up in the engine and that the engined needed to be replaced!  Replaced? Eesch!

We were asked various questions on where we had our service work done.  After verifing that we had all of our work done at the dealership in WA state, they offered us a Loaner.  Ummm I said, we're driving on to Chicago.  Not to worry, they would flatbed the car to us when it was repaired and to keep the Loaner.  Out of pocket costs?  Nothing!

Now, that story is eight years old and it reminds me of our current experience with our ES.  Seems the NAV & bluetooth link doesn't want to accept the new iPhone.  Yeah, I know, Apple right? LOL. After several attempts by us and the dealer, they are now replacing the entire system. Out of pocket costs?  Nothing!

We have owned other cars and have spent lots of $$$ with replair work, but no one backs up their cars like Lexus.  No one. Peace of mind? Priceless!

You know those success stories that start with, " I didn't even finish high school?" They are few and far between, but sometimes the education system just holds you down, man. Such is the case with Culinary Dropout. I think the chefs behind this rebellious culinary institution felt their creativity stifle in the classroom.

The dishes were kind of experimental but not too far out there to be considered wackadoodledoo-ish. Soft pretzel nuggets accompanied by a provolone fondue. Homemade chips served with a whipped onion dip concoction. Charcuterie and fromage plates. Artichoke salad. Short rib orchiette pasta. Apple cinnamon monkey bread. It was a simple selection, yet executed with passion so every bite resulted in an "ooh ahh" moment. And to top it all off, the cocktails (particularly the Clown Punch topped with a pomegranate froth) were fun and designed to flirt with taste buds.

The dcor is a confused mix of brick, chandeliers, mood lighting, loungey booths, communal wood tables, an inside and outside bar, open kitchen area, etc. But none of it clashed or begged for attention, it blended nicely together.

The live music on Saturday night had everyone at the table clapping, singing, and nodding in agreement. The band really made the experience complete.

Certificate or not, Culinary Dropout makes the grade for me.

"You cannot invade the mainland United States. There would be a rifle behind every blade of grass." - Isoroku Yamamoto

All the men that work here have served their country. Tip them well! 

70 years after D-Day I came here to celebrate my daughter's high school graduation. I opted for the D-day package while my daughter had the G.I. Jane. 

We were picked up by an authentic military humvee. No A/C but I was told by the mid of June all the humvees will have doors, a roof, and A/C. The driver and my trainer were beyond courteous and very welcoming. The training is thorough and you are given the opportunity to load and cock your own weapon. In addition, the trainer makes sure there are plenty of photo ops. You can also take pics with the helicopter and vehicles outside. 

When I think of World War 2, "Saving Private Ryan" and "Pearl Harbor" come to mind. So many have made the ultimate sacrifice. Their weapons have always fascinated me and in this moment I was able to shoot the same weapons our American soldiers used to fight the Germans and Japanese. The M1 Garand is an amazing rifle. Plenty of power and by far my favorite weapon because of it's historic value and accuracy. I got all head shots! The Thompson looks so easy in the movies. But once you pull that trigger and let the auto loose you are spraying the target. Oh what a blast that was! 

My daughter did well. Head shots and red targets. Her favorite was the Colt M4 because of the scope and it reminded her of playing call of duty. 

The weapon selection is extensive. P90, MP5, ACR, Scar, MG, and so on and so on. There's so many to choose from! There are about a dozen packages available. Even one for the kids with weapons using .22. I can't wait to come back and try a .50 sniper rifle. This is a definite adrenaline rush and an experience you can't miss! Boom!

One of a kind filipino restaurant. I love that they focus on barbecue food and not like other normal filipino restaurants that offer everything and you get confused what to order. Also refreshing to see that they don't just show TFC. 

We had fish balls for appetizer, chicken, pork, beef barbecue, pork belly, pansit palabok and bangus. Everything was really tasty! 

Unlimited sago gulaman definitely a plus!

Our server Kyn was super adorable and helpful. Loved how jolly he was and passionate at what he does. The owner and staff were all genuinely nice, friendly, and everyone had great customer service. 

Will be coming back to try the others on the menu specially the beef mami and boodle boat. Can't wait!

REVIEW # 100 !!! 
Blue Man Group, at the Venetian Hotel in Vegas, was entertaining, educational and musical all the same time. I had the pleasure of attending Blue Man with my entire extended family and I have to say- I think this was the best situation to see the show.  

The show was interactive and even slightly captivating at times. Audience members are escorted to the stage to participate and the members of the show walk through the aisles, and sometimes even climb over the seats.  You can't get much more interactive than that.  

There are two shows, one at 7 pm and one immediately after it at 9pm.  I dont know how those guys do it, they have to clean the entire theatre after having just trashed it.  

I have to say- I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more paint involved.  It seemed more of a comedy/music show that I thought.  So much emphasis had been put on the pipes and paint, but very little time was actually dedicated to them.

Would I see it again?  You know, I think Blue Man Group is a treat to see once but seeing as the show hasn't changed at all since it opened, it will almost positively be the same if you went back again.

4pm check out time, at no additional cost. In Vegas? Yes, it does exist, and it exists at Trump. It's an excellent buffer after going all night long, because the thought of getting up at 10 or 11 is just plain awful. 

The bathroom is huge and includes a shower large enough to fit a party of four people (if that's your kind of thing) and a bathtub deep enough to store all your winnings. And there's a TV in the mirror in the event you want to bathe in your money and catch some prime time.

The rooms are spacious and though there's no casino to amuse you, it's walking distance from some of the more desirable entertainment locations of the strip.

Your nose will also appreciate the distinct (and pleasant) smells in the lobby and elevator.

Seriously though, wtf is a container park? I get the concept, but was unsure of the execution. Could a pile of containers really be cool? Would it be a tourist gimmick? A place that you see once, never to return? Well, it turns out it is cool, and I will return many times. 

There are several places to dine, imbibe and shop for quirky items. Mexican, BBQ, jerky, cupcakes, ice pops, cocktails... it's all there with plenty of outdoor seating to combat the small interior dining space. Bolt Barbers are there (in a caboose) to give you a cut 'n shave, there's a play area for the kids, a gigantic slide for drunk adults, live tunes and a massive grasshopper with flames shooting out of its antennas.... what's not to enjoy? There is something for everyone. I think it's definitely a must-see if you're downtown. (note: there might also be some sort of party dome here) 

I've never been to another container park, so there's really no comparison. For now, and possibly forever, it will be the best and worst container park I've even been to.

Ok, sorry...it took me several days to collect myself. 

1. Best service I've ever received in a hotel. EVER. 

2. A fish named "Tierra" was in our room. Cool. They said I requested her...but I know for a fact I did not, as I did not realize that fish requests were accepted. Now I know. 

3. Arizona has an unfair advantage. The weather is stellar. 

4. Two pools, a hot tub and a lagoon. A sand beach pool. Comfy couches, chairs, chaise lounges, tables, etc. None of this cheap plastic stuff up in here. Pure relax mode. 

5. Patio room. Free Wifi. Great restaurant. Beautiful.

Can I please go back now? Tierra needs me.

Electric Daisy Carnival is not just a destination, a place, a celebration, a setting, or a music festival. It's a life changing experience, an adventure... a magical wonderland! It was an ethereal, surreal journey. 

This year EDC is my first and I would not change it in any other way because of the memories we created together with friends and the new. So much fun/cool experience! 

There is no way I can describe EDC because you have to be there in order to feel the experience with other 350,000+ people. 

The goods: 
-The largest rave in America stretched out approx. 1.5-2 miles apart with over 350,000+ attendees. Holy. 
-Spectacular decors and stage set ups. I loved the Kinetic Field set up the most! That celestial castle mimicked Little Mermaid's castle of gold or Disney's Sleeping Beauty castle or some form of cathedral structure! Very remarkable and incredible. THE LIGHT INSTALLATIONS ARE PHENOMENAL! Now I can understand why Insomniac spent over $35 million dollars+ toward the productions. 
-It goes from dusk to sunrise. 
-Free water, but the line can be cruel-some. Stay hydrated please!
-65+ carnival rides are fun to ride with your friends and make good memories. 
-The artists! Hardwell, Tiesto, Calvin Harris, Dash, Avicii, Kaskade, Carnage, Alesso, and all of the biggest EDM DJs you know. 
-You'll meet some of the friendliest people on the planet. I got to PLUR with some of amazing new friends! 
-THE FIREWORKS. 

-The bads: 
-Beer is overpriced.. $8 for a can of Budlight? 
-No cell signal, so don't rely on catching receptions. Bring some walkie talkies.
-Parking. It's the worst when trying to get out of Speedway. 
-Traffic. It takes minimum of 45 minutes to 4 hours to get to the carnival from the Strip. 
-Running out of toilet papers in the rest rooms, so bring some for yourself. 

All in all, I had the best experience with friends I will forever cherish! This is something everyone in their 20s should experience once in their lifetime.

Thank you Pasquale Rotella, CEO and Founder of Insomniac Productions, for making this happen every year. It was literally the BEST WEEKEND OF MY LIFE surrounded with good and positive vibes. Rolling bowling balls. Awesome kandis. Oh my gawd, awesome DJs. PLUR. Sleep is for the weak. #insomiac. EAT SLEEP RAVE REPEAT!

See you next year under the electric sky!

I had my first taste of Firehouse Subs today and decided to go with the Beef & Cheddar eight inch sandwich with a large Diet Dr. Pepper from their fabulous soda machine. That machine kind of reminds me of Rodney Dangerfield's character in the Caddyshack where he had that golf bag that played music, so versatile just like the soda machine delivering many different types of sodas. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3A9rLoz_0o

The Beef and Cheddar sandwich comes with bbq sauce and mayo. I got it without the mayo and it tasted fabulous. The only problem was that I felt a little hungry after eating it. So there's the rub, an excellent tasting meal with just a little bit of meat. Five stars for taste but one star for not putting out my 5 alarm hunger pangs.

This is the gym I've been looking for!

I recently moved back to Vegas and needed a gym. I was kind of over the LVAC hustle. Sign a contract, blah blah blah...become a member of an overcrowded gym, blah blah blah.

I hopped on Yelp, searched for Gyms and BAM! City Athletic Club popped up.

When I got to the club, I was greeted by Club Director, Elvis. He gave me a tour of the facility, and gave me a couple days to try out the club. No pitch or sales pressure (even though I know how to handle it). 

By the next day, I was ready to sign up. Memberships are affordable, and they have different levels. I LOVE the towel service. Also love that I don't need to carry a membership card on my keys.

The gym is brand new. Clearly it was a 24 Hour before, but it has MAJOR upgrades. The equipment is new, the club is clean and sanitized hourly, and almost every piece of cardio has it's on TV (in HD of course with basic cable). 

My favorite parts of the gym:

--No contract. Month-to-Month.
--Full Basketball Court with extensions to 6 hoops.
--Olympic Size Swimming Pool (even though I dont know how to swim)
--A Yoga/dance studio for the ladies
--Spin classes in their own room
--Fantastic selection of weights (bars, dumbbells, machines, etc)
--Separate stretching areas
--Cardio (stairs, treadmills, etc) with their own HDTVs
--CLEAN showers and bathrooms
--Toiletries provided
--Membership is capped, so once they reach a certain number, you don't have to worry about pretentious psycho people ruining YOUR gym.

The gym is not full of meatheads, or grenades. All normal people. 

If you are looking for a gym, this is the spot. Everyone is nice here.

Eh cuz, we go grind!

Food from the 808.  Well kinda.  More like Korean take out and a spam musubi on the side for good measure.  

Rant:
1.  Hawaiian food and the iconic plate lunch is NOT Korean take out with four choices of vegetables.
2.  Stop throwing pineapples on everything and calling it "Hawaiian".
3.  Just because they say it on Hawaii Five-0, calling me "brah" or asking if I "hang ten" does not make you cool, it just makes you sound stupid.

How does it stack up?

Excluding the more traditional Korean items, these are island flavors.  Heavy handed on the salt and MSG, lots of sweetened shoyu (soy sauce) infused with ginger and garlic marinades.  Portions are West coast sensible, no two pound plate lunch.

Kalbi, meat jun, BBQ beef, BBQ chicken all greasy, oily, and deeply flavored.  Two scoops rice, macaroni salad, some Korean style veg.  Done.  Hawaii Yeeps, think Yummys.
 
A bowl of saimin (not ramen) with slices of spam, egg, kamaboko maybe some won ton and green onion in a supercharged MSG based bonito broth taste like Shiro's.  Exactly as it should.  The fried version, oily, salty and plain.  Hawaii hotel banquet quality.

A-OK.  Kanak attack.  Out.

When I first started buying BB I thought it was the greatest thing EVER!! 
I got tons of beautiful produce and I loved going early to help distribute the Baskets. 

Little by little my basket became more and more unusable. The quality went down hill. 
I would be getting the same things week after week, things that were next to rotten upon receiving, everything was sooo dirty and some things that I would just never use, like 6 onions and 6 bell peppers. 

I recently switched to all organic and I thought I would order one of the organic baskets this week for a change. 

I've got to tell you I feel robbed. Honestly this basket sucks! Most of the items weren't even labeled as organic and I wasn't able to volunteer this morning so I don't know for sure if they even are. 

I don't know about you but I don't need 3 bundles of celery. Again the filth that these veggies are covered in is inexcusable. 

I spent $18 last week at the OTFM and got so much more CLEAN organic produce. BB charges $25 for their organic basket of junk. 

I will not be ordering these again. You really could do better at the grocery store or farmers market if you want produce and then you can choose to buy locally or U.S. grown veggies.

It seems as if I'm here once a week. 

When we moved to the Valley, our new house came with a pool. In other parts of the country this has always been a negative, but not here for obvious reasons. 

Mike, and everyone at Leslie have been sooo helpful in our transition of learning how to take care of our pool.  We did have some local pool services. But they only lasted 6-8 months before they sold the business to someone else.  That said, Leslie has always been here for us.  

The killer for me are the O-rings.  They're everywhere in your pool.  From the pop-up water blowers on the bottom, to the electric pump and filters. But here is where a dedicate pool guy like Mike is invaluable.  He takes what you bring him. Asks where it came from and then he goes over to his book -- BAM!  He gets you the part and tells you how to install it.  There is also an option of Leslie coming to you house to do the work for you.  Very nice!

I would also recommend that you sign-up for their email blasts and catalog delivery. It's a good idea because they will send you 10%, 15% and 20% off coupons once a week.  Delivery is usually free, but I like going to Mike who also accepts them.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 34/100

Nice Tory location! Supposedly they're moving it to a different space at the Caesar Forum shops later on this year, but for now it's by Henri Bendel and the MAC Cosmetics store.

Came in here the other day just to browse. I wasn't planning on buying anything, but I always like to pop into any Tory Burch store I run into because she's my favorite designer :)

This location is kinda small. I've never seen a layout quite like this one, but there's very little room. Perhaps they're moving to take over a large space? I'm not sure.

The sales associates were very friendly and greeted me upon entry. I overheard another woman who had come in right after me. She had come from the Palazzo Tory Burch location and put a purse on hold at this location. The sales associates helped her quickly and efficiently and it seemed to be an easy transaction!

They had a great selection of Tory's shoes at this location. Unfortunately, you can't see them all laid out together because they have these weird column-like shelves where they store the shoes.

Other than that, everything at this location was great! Nothing bad about it :)

These ladies are pressing up the most delectable dietary delights in Las Vegas! It's a five star experience all the way to organic nirvana.

HPP means high pressure pressing. All USDA organic, non GMO. A lot of their produce is sourced from California, which means a smaller carbon footprint. Their bottling is either glass (all class) or plastic, and the plastic bottles are, of course, BPA free. What's not to love?

If that's not enough to entice you, the radiant ladies they have behind the counter (or the adorable Queen Bees that are wandering the floor this afternoon) are incredibly friendly AND knowledgable. Their concept goes beyond trendy. When they began to tell me about how certain vitamins will be absorbed 100% because of the pairings with other vegetables, and a mention of trace minerals (87 in BeWhealthy, if you're counting), I knew I had come to the right place! It's a breath of fresh air having nutrition that makes sense and does work for you, instead of just adding chia seed to everything and calling it healthy.

Their selection of smoothies are limited to a mere four, but they run the gamut of every avenue of nutrition you need. Fruit based, protein based, veggie based, and fat based (think coconut, avocado). They have superfood add-ons as well such as chia, hemp, flax, coconut meat, bee pollen, spirulina, nutritional yeast.. The list goes on. I've tried all but the protein smoothie and can confidently say they are delicious and filling! I love my liquid lunches on the go.

The space itself is gorgeous and inspiring, the branding and bottling is sexy, the juices are not only good for you, but specifically crafted to be delicious while beneficial to your health. Bee well!

This chocolate heaven at the Aria hotel just makes me so happy. As soon as i saw those chocolate flowers on the wall http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=zqVvDm_-ikgvhPMZrUK3Lg, i was giddy!
There was the gelato bar with a great variety of flavors: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=7K-QKzgV0XdrlZOX9aMRng, a crepe station, sandwiches, cakes galore, pastries, chocolates and lots of fun and cute stuff - from wedding cake favors http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=wzlynGBt9AZbLQevhF8jjg to Thrilla
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=ZRq2lJn-JoOHLqUOZNYQVg
It was almost impossible to pick which cake i wanted. We settled on triple chocolate cake (so decadent!) topped with a fab macaron. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=HfgazxGFRJ6nZO2MXGcNsQ
We also shared a tasty crepe: rich and very indulgent. Loved it! 

One thing i didn't love was when I asked a worker if they sold individual macarons and the guy said yes and pointed me to the coconut macaroons. I was even more annoyed when I saw labels for the rose macaron cake say macaroon. However the prepacked macarons were labeled "French macarons".  Anthony N pointed it out to me that macaroon is the English translation for macaron; but seriously at Jean Philippe I would like to see it labeled Macaron, especially when they ALSO sell macarooooons. It's like a prestigious french restaurant having "fat liver" on their menu instead of foie gras. Luckily my annoyance quickly dissipated when i took a bite of that triple chocolate cake!!!

I thought my 300th review should go to a special place.
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=P8mhHhcXHYDgJZDBsFPy7A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

This is one eye opening museum. One that will radioactively enlighten your day.

This is a branch of the Smithsonian Institution and like all the others this place is very thorough in letting you know the facts from multiple  perspectives. I did the self tour so I could take my time and soak in as much on this place as I could. I even met a Yelp friend Atom.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-atomic-testing-museum-las-vegas?select=sJt8qJbkCXpeFB_9vFhdHg#sJt8qJbkCXpeFB_9vFhdHg

The Museum kind of starts in reverse as the first display is one that shows the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan with a short premier of the A-bombs birth. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=DxttT6mA5FbF1agv35diAQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

You quickly move about the various displays that include to a milti-timeline table of the nuclear era that includes popular things like what the best TV show was, what was happening in Russia  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-atomic-testing-museum-las-vegas?select=oVbywp4289aavJ4pThd8Hg#FhcKP7e0Ueul1pLzHKiLGA  and what kind of nuclear testing was being done at that moment in time. A very interesting history lesson.  

There is a letter penned to the US government from Albert Einstein from 1939 (well before WWII) that discussed the future of nuclear science, power, medicine and weapons and the need for the government to secure however possible the raw materials (uranium) from places both local and abroad.

There are many cool displays from a working Geiger counter that you can use to sample display radioactive things that you'd never imagine are radioactive. I stuck my cell phone and guess what? Light radiation is emitted from a dumb phone. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-atomic-testing-museum-las-vegas?select=oVbywp4289aavJ4pThd8Hg#p23oO9CppodE_yTr8KQdzw

There are interactive displays and one of my favorites was the first theater where you got to feel a blast as if you were there.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=whzFsAV7dW1-ivMEOzJovQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw  This museum is rich with displays and physical / video / audio accounts of what it's like to be on the foreground of this nuclear testing facility  just outside of Las Vegas.

This is a really a historical tour of our nations past that you must have once. 5***** Stars
Additionally there is a display that I did not go to that details area 51 and all the mystery that surrounds it, heard it sucked so I didn't bother.

If you're a history buff and are a quasi-nerd like me you might just dig this place.

"Oh come on.  When I said I wanted soup, I thought you'd pick ramen.  Tripe, tendons, beef knee bone, tongue, oxtail.  Seriously?" whines my Midwest poker bud.

"Be adventurous"  I say, choking back giggles.

"Adventurous?  It's not fair.  The worst my people got is Rocky Mountain Oysters, and you like those."

E-Jo is all about authentic Korean beef bone soup.  Heavily extracted, boiled for hours until gelatinous and milky.  Incredible beef flavor with garlicky undertones.

Simply select from a flavorful list of brisket (well braised, stringy), tongue (braised and tender), knee (clean, gelatinous tendons), oxtail (fall off the bone with melting cartilage), tripe (well cleaned, no off smell, tender), or all of the above then adjust the seasoning with the provided salt, fermented chili paste, chili powder and scallions.  Done.

Only three banchan.  In-house made, incredible Napa cabbage and radish kim chee.  Deep flavor, good heat and just the right tingle of fermentation on the tongue.  A plate of fresh shishito peppers adds a vibrant, mild spice, green pepper foil made even better when dipped in a light but flavor enhancing soy garlic sauce.

There are a few other non soup items (spicy pork, chicken, etc).  Have not tried them.  

Prices for the soups are very reasonable ranging between $10 - $15.

A short list of shoju and Korean beer rounds out the meal.

Mom and pop Asian service.

An incredible bowl of deliciousness.  Oh yeah, "Mikey liked it".

"To me, life without veal stock, pork fat, sausage, organ meat, demi-glace, or even stinky cheese is a life not worth living."   Anthony Bourdain

This little shop has it all:  wood chips, charcoal, wine, beer, spices, BBQ sauce, all-natural dog treats, and many cuts of meats from all sorts of animals.  Truly living up to their shop name, it is meat and spirits galore [mainly meat though].  So on our recent excursion, I bought some andouille brats and jalapeo & cheese brats to grill up.  I wanted to grab a jar of sauerkraut but Mr. W. voted against it.  What a stick-in-the-mud! Anyways, after boiling the brats and tossing it on the grill, we feasted, and it was delicious --- especially the jalapeo one. This place is a bit pricier than your average vanilla supermarkets but that's the price you pay for freshness and quality. Next time, I'm getting me some steaks.

Walking into this shop makes me feel like a caveman.  All that meat and beer!  But then I realize I'm wearing heeled booties with jeggings and it stops me from chestbumping every guy I come across. Just kidding... I chestbump the ladies. *sassy hair flip*

Not absolutely sure if this is the first business of this business model to open in the 702, but I am absolutely sure that it is the newest and only business of this kind currently in operation.

Cafe Teaze is what I would considered a hybrid business model combining a boba tea shop and a Vietnamese coffee shop (just Google or Bing it if you want to know more).  Specifically, the menu is what you would normally find at a boba tea house in California and the waitstaff are all bikini or lingerie clad women. The best part for me and I am sure for the target market is that these waitstaff are friendly and beautiful, and could easily transition from serving you boba milk tea to fitting right in at import model photo shoots.

What can you order here?  11 types of milk teas (from the simple milk tea to Ma-Cha Ice Cream Milk Green Tea with or without boba), 5 different iced flavor teas (Lychee Green Tea and Passion Fruit Black Tea are what look the most appealing to me right off the bat), 6 varieties of Flavored Snow Ice, 5 hot milk tea options and 9 snacks (popcorn chicken, fried wontons, and spiral potato just to rattle off a few).

Let's be frank here, even if your name is not Frank or Francis Underwood, I am here first and foremost for the eye candy, without getting hassle for doing the looking. That reality is what the proprietor is relying on in attracting new customers. However, the beverage and food are what the owners are banking on for lots and lots of repeat business after the novelty wears off a bit.

For me hopefully the novelty will never wear off :)

Love the music.
Love the entertainer.
Didn't love the performance.

Michael Jackson One reminded me how much I love Michael Jackson music and also reminded me how much I miss the entertainer that he was.

This Cirque du Soleil show was still very good ... less because of the "story" or "acts" and more for the pure joy, inspiration, and energy hearing Michael Jackson songs brings. Actually the story of 4 misfits searching for the white glove, shoes, hat, and sunglasses of MJ was downright silly. I really didn't care for Shy or Clumsy (the other two are called Sneaky and Smarty Pants). Less of them and more of the music could of made Michael Jackson One a 5-star experience truly worthy of the $155/ticket (plus additional Ticketmaster fees).

A few highlights:

 * A hologram of Michael Jackson dancing to "Man in the Mirror" was like watching a cool movie of Michael up close. 

 * The "Bad" performance brings back memories of break dancing ...

 * "Billie Jean" features dancers in multicolored lit suits and acrobats around the theater.

 * "Thriller" filled with trampolines and zombies was ok.

 * More than once, the show shares messages of hope and equality ... especially during "They Don't Care About Us."

 * "Smooth Criminal" may of been my favorite ... because I love the song and the "lean"

Some of the songs were:

 - Beat It
 - Leave Me Alone
 - Bad
 - Smooth Criminal
 - I'll Be There
 - Human Nature
 - Jam
 - They Don't Care About Us
 - Earth Song
 - Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'
 - The Way You Make Me Feel
 - Dangerous
 - Dirty Diana
 - Workin' Day and Night
 - Billie Jean
 - Thriller
- I Just Can't Stop Loving You
 - Man in the Mirror
 - Can You Feel It
 - Black or White
 - Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough

Those are some memorable tunes ... Forget about all the distractions and story. 

      Go for your love of the music. 
      Go for your love of the entertainer. 
      Remember how much you miss Michael Jackson.

Pizza A Metro in CenPho is branching out! For those of you on the East side, you will pleased to know that they are ramping up their new location in the next few weeks with some invite only soft-launches. If you want to be included, stop by the Thomas location and give them your contact info...  The hard launch is scheduled for October 1, 2008.

I sat down with Maurizio today during lunch and got some of the particulars to whet your appetites -- 

The new location is larger, much larger. They will have a wine room, a bar that will seat approximately 25, and the dining room with seating for 80+.

Some of your favorites will appear on their menu, but Amarone will include a lot of new items which are more in line with the larger kitchen and the more upscale flavor of the new site.

Amarone will be open from 11:00 to Midnight.

For anyone that hasn't had the pleasure of meeting or dining with Maurizio, you are in for a treat. This man LOVES food and experiences obvious pleasure from sharing it with others!

East-siders, mark your calenders and get ready for Amarone!

This is my "Go To" spot for exchanging foreign currency.  Whenever I travel abroad I do some research on exchange rates in the country I'm visiting vs this joint.  9 times out of 10 they are very competitive with their rates and I'd rather exchange large sums of currency in Vegas than in a foreign country.

I was here the other day to convert some US Dollars to Chinese RMB in preparation for an upcoming trip to China.  I called prior to driving down here and asked what the exchange rate was.  They were offering 6.53 RMB to 1 USD.  Luckily, I had a classmate in Beijing that just exchanged some currency the day before and she said the exchange rate at banks in Beijing was 6.45-6.75 RMB to 1 USD.  Not a bad deal!  I'll pay the small vig for the convenience of dealing with someone in my home country where communication is easy.

One of the bad things about this place is the parking.  If you're a visitor, you have to park in the underground parking garage.  That's the last place you want to walk to after converting a lot of currency.  

Which leads me to my second complaint about this place.....there's no privacy.  There is a large counter in the office where you conduct your transactions and a large window facing the street where people can look inside and see what you're doing. (see pics)  Not a cool situation if you're counting a lot of money on the counter.  I've always felt uncomfortable in that sense.

Overall Value - they offer great exchange rates, I'm always satisfied with the value they offer.

Will I return?  Unless a better option presents itself, there's no doubt I'll be back!

At the risk of sounding like an ad for an Adam Sandler movie where they interview audiences outside of the theater, I have to say that my face hurt from laughing so much after this show. I'm not what you'd call "easily offended." I'm a pretty thick-skinned gal and I'm not averse to foul language or nudity, but wow, I was even surprised by the amazingly offensive hilarity at this show. 

You know how most cirque-type shows have the acrobat act followed by the clown act. And the clown act is some foofy French shit that is mildly humorous at best, and mostly evokes an, "Aww, that's cute." Well, the "clown" act in Absinthe is totally different. The hosts are absolutely hilarious, and while I know a lot of it is scripted, they are on point with their improv too. 

The acrobat acts were 80% fantastic too, there was one that was whatevs, but just wait for the tightrope walkers. Thanks to the super intimate venue, you get to see tightrope walkers closer than you ever have before. It's pretty spectacular. 

Absinthe is my number one recommendation for Vegas these days. I'm not much into clubs, and I'd be more into shows if they didn't all run more per ticket than my car payment. But Absinthe, oh Absinthe. It's a must-see. And for the price (especially with the plentiful discounts around town), it can't be beat.

PS It's true. Be careful about sitting in the front row, you will more than definitely get teased. It's pretty hilarious, but if you're still recovering from Little Tommy teasing you in 4th grade for having hairy legs, well, maybe sit a few rows back.

Another Scottsdale shrine to douchebaggary. 

I really hoped this would be a fun club with electronic music the Phoenix club scene is missing. Kind of like European summer clubs or Vegas pool clubs but as it turns out they are not about that. It is just another place to show off.

I find it difficult to believe that any respectable DJ would even want to play in this place.

They have 3 lines. One for VIP, one for regular admission, and another for what seemed to be to admit ugly burned out Scottscale cougars and their trouts.

The lines are unmarked so I ended up in the wrong line and was asked to go back in the regular line, which turns out is another hour of wait longer after they accept people in the "VIP" line, despite the place being empty at 10:30.

Seriously? Why would anyone want to go to a place where they just keep a line to seem busy?

The music inside was sub-par. Kind of commercial bullshit. Reminds me more of Jersey shore clubs than anything worth-while.

Medicore for breakfast. The buffet was pretty pathetic looking, especially considering this is Vegas, land of the endless buffets with all you can eat lobster and pancakes (yes together and yes it's weird). I've seen better breakfast buffets in LA. 

We decided to just order. My fiance ordered an omelette and I ordered cereal. It took forever to get our food and when it arrived it wasn't anything special. Almost everything on the breakfast menu seemed heavy. The only reason we ate here was because we had the breakfast credit from American Express, but honestly, next time I'd rather pay for breakfast and go somewhere decent.

Grab your fork and knife.  No slices here.  True Napolitano pizza in Vegas (or as close as you're gonna get without a trip to Italy).

So it's a small chain of restaurants, all good.  Quality ingredients atop a perfectly blistered, chewy, well seasoned crust served by a proud and friendly staff.  Win!  

This is the real deal.  They even follow the the standards laid down by the Italian government that define such trivial things as the basic ingredients of the crust, its thickness, and the cooking temperature.

The Margherita DOC is excellent.  The standard to judge all Napolitano pizza by, a simple base of crushed, ripe, acidic tomatoes, fresh milky Mozzarella, fresh basil, and a splash of EVOO.  Near perfect.  The diavola with its fennel flavored, gently aged finnochiona, sweet roasted peppers, garlic and mozzarella equally good.  Too simple?  The pizza Capricciosa with its aged, porky porsciutto, oil poached artichoke hearts mushrooms olives basil all atop the same sweet, acidic tomato pure topped with fresh mozzarella, outstanding without being overloaded with toppings.

The only weakness, the namesake Settebello.  The sausage lacked the aged, umame flavor so characteristic in Italian cured meats.  A minor point considering.

Very inexpensive for the quality.

Now if they would just move the tables much closer, encourage chatting it up with your neighbors, get some disposable paper table coverings and serve an abundance of wine....

I have eaten here a few times now and am surprised at how much I like it. I'm not a burger person, so I can't comment on that. The last two times I have ordered the "BLT" priced at $1.49 and can't believe how good it is for a fast food place. They aren't shy on the bacon and it tastes good. I also had a small order of their "Famous Seasoned Fries" priced at $1.69 and found them to be a bit crunchy and overcooked. Priced at 2 for a $1 the "Cinnamon Apple Pie" I had for dessert was a nice finishing touch. The employees here are friendly and they have a dual drive-thru. Even though the fries could use some work, fans of Checkers and Rally's shouldn't be disappointed with the cheap prices and food put out here.

Some of my favorite yelpers have been displeased with the antics of one Miss Lisa G. So needless to say I was a bit nervous when meeting Kristin S for lunch recently. Will one of their famous "balls" be hurled at my head if I use the wrong fork? If I take too long to dine will I be ejected by a rogue mob of hospitality lesbians? Upon entering the tiny, sparse yet comfortable space I was immediately greeted and seated. My beverage order was taken quickly and delivered promptly with a smile. Hmmm...now. I'm waiting for Kristin S. Is this where I will be sneered and jeered at by anxious table turning servers? Nope. The menu is limited to sandwiches and salads. Not even a soup. I chose the tuna salad with a Dijon caper dressing...fantastic. Kristin S had the veggie sandwich and said it was good as well. The decor is clean, warm and modern. I could do without the pictures of children on the wall. Really. Was this a day care before? The balls? I guess I'll have to try them next time. Though eating balls made by a lesbian does make me a tad nervous. Lisa G? Gee I think I'll be back.

Sorry to ruin the party concerning the high Yelp rating for this company, but this is my story. 

I called these guys and we agreed that they would come over to my house at 4pm for a regular service call. So I took off some time from the office to meet them at my house. I called them at 4:10pm and asked them what was going on, I had to leave a message. After a few minutes, they called me back and said they didn't have a technician near my house since they were in other parts of the valley so we would have to reschedule. WTF?

I rescheduled for the next week and while they called me about 15 minutes before the scheduled appointment, I told them that I was in another part of the valley and couldn't make the appointment. I then continued with my awesome lunch.

I went through several casinos during my recent visit to Lost Wages, and NYNY stands out as the most . . . um . . . different.

When I saw pictures of the exterior, I always thought "cheesy".  Wnen I saw it in person, I thought "cheesier".  If I would have booked a room, I might have thought "cheesiest", but I'll leave that to people who did sleep here.

I love roller coasters, so I planned to go on this one.  Then I got to the entrance, and found that it's $14/ride.  That is beyond steep.  I didn't ride.  My coworker, who was also in Vegas at the time, told me that she did ride it a while back, and it's so rough and throws you back and forth so much that it hurts.  At my advanced age (I've been 29 for many years now), I don't feel like booking a chiropractor after riding a roller coaster.

Now for the good:  The Hersheys store.  Like World Of Coca-Cola and the M&Ms store, this one is overpriced.  But you can get a Hershey bar customized with your name on it.  And it has a chocolate Statue of Liberty at the inside entrance;  cool.

New York New York:  a good resort hotel to walk through if you want an "only in Las Vegas" experience, and if you want to hope that what's built in Vegas stays in Vegas.

If I ever got the urge to become a stripper, I would get a job at Bandaids. As Dottsy so eloquently explained, these are your average, run-of-the-mill girls you would find working in your neighborhood. I can't compete with the likes of Candy and Barbie at the Scottsdale clubs, but I may be able to hold a candle to girls of Bandaids.

While I must admit I have less of an imagination than Dottsy (I don't find myself wondering what people would look like if they stripped. Often.) I recognize and appreciate this establishment for what it is. 

I had my power hour here back in the day when the hooch stopped pouring at 1am. This is really very irrelevant to my review, but at the same time, seems wrong to omit. 

I kind of feel like they used the remnants of someones drink for my vodka tonic this past Saturday, which is unfortunate because I paid $8, but the $6 Corona served me well and I was not horribly chapped by the high cost considering this is a strip club.

As a woman, I don't have to pay a cover charge. That means that I can walk in and look at boobies for free. Wait, why am I not giving this place 5 stars???  

Really what more do I need to say?

I'm glad we have a nice big Korean spa here in Las Vegas like the ones they have in LA.. 

Here is a quick run down of how things go down at Imperial: 

-Check-in with the front desk.. She will give you your key, towels (3) and co-ed area clothes (shorts + shirt).. If you want slippers, you will need to leave your ID or keys up front with them. 
-Enter the locker room and put your shoes in the shoe locker with your number (you don't need your key for these). Go around the corner and find your locker with the same number and get naked! 
-Bring 1 towel with you and go into the spa area and start with a shower (always shower before you use any of the facilities).
-After your shower, feel free to use the hot tub, cold tub, dry sauna, herbal steam room, salt steam room..
-When you are ready to go upstairs, dry up and put on your co-ed clothes..
-Feel free to explore the different rooms and if you get hungry, order from the kitchen (everything gets charged to your locker number). 
-When you are done you will check out with the front desk. 

HOT TIP: The kitchen opens at 10AM. Imperial provides shampoo, conditioner, body wash, razors, tooth brushes, lotion, hair spray and more...

I came here with my girlfriends and had the best ever bachelorette party one could ask for! 

The suite was elegantly decorated and spacious, with a separate living room area.  I especially loved the roomy bathroom with plenty of space and mirror for all of us girls to get pretty for the night out. 

The Tao nightclub is not bad either, they hooked us up with complimentary passes since we were guests here.  Loved the music, drinks, see-through toilets, and friendly/good-looking company! 

I'll definitely be back here for a special occasion. 

Thanks for making it happen Donna Y....dedicating my 100th to my BFF!

Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

Don't tell anyone about this place!  It is quite the little jewel.  It's hidden inside of Commonwealth, but SHHHHHHH don't tell anyone!

You have to text a number to get a reservation and then when you get to Commonwealth, you look around like you're lost and then someone says, "Excuse me, do you have a reservation at Laundry Room?"  Why, yes we do, how do we get in?  "Follow me...." through a door hidden in the wallpaper, and then another door, and then.....boom!!! You're in the 1920s.  I mean as soon as you walk in there is some prohibition clinkity piano music going on, some filligree on the wallpaper, some tufted couches, and a glorious bar with very comfortable backless stools (usually not a fan of backless stools, but these were nice).

Drinks are labor intensive, delicious, rightfully expensive (so don't complain, you've been warned!), and full of a bunch of ingredients that I've never heard of, but damn are they amazing.  There is also popcorn in little vintage bowls strewn with crystals.  Now listen....I don't like popcorn.  I don't like how it gets stuck in your teeth and tastes stale no matter what.  But this popcorn was HATCH CHILE popcorn and it was spicy, a little smoky, and I pretty much became obsessed with it considering the bartender filled the bowl up twice for me.

This is what a speakeasy should be.  Classy, sexy, chic, and mysterious.  SHHH, DON'T TELL ANYONE!

PS, I would have taken some pictures, but pictures are not allowed!!  There is a whole list of rules in the back of the menu, which I wholeheartedly agree with every single one.  I need this place in my life more.

Twist continues to impress.  

Contemporary dining space with illuminated glass globes suspended throughout, outstanding view of the Strip, warm and efficient service, and incredible food.  What more can you ask for?

Straight to the food.  The Hudson Valley foie. Presented two ways.  Poached (sous-vide) served with a horseradish emulsion, tart sauerkraut and smoky Morteau sausage.  A great savory balance between earthy, tart, smoky flavors all cutting the richness of the foie.  Second, "nuggets" of a foie terrine "glazed" with Glenmorangie dusted with sweet and spicy gingerbread power and hazelnuts.  The smoky undertones of the single malt accentuates the mineral, livery taste of the foie.  Delish.  Apple ice cream on the side; perfect.

The Dover sole & prawns is hard to top.  The orange scented fish ("glazed" with orange cider) is brought to life by an earthy morel cream and vegetal flavors of turnips, coriander, and spinach.  The addition of prawns adds sweetness and a nice oceanic flavor.  Complex yet refreshing dish.

The list of great dishes goes on and on.  

The degustation menus are the best way to sample Twist.  Portions are scaled down so no risk of over eating (unless you have the six course grand desert).  Beautiful and delicious; just remember, you've been warned.  

Note for beef lovers:  Twist offers the best priced Japanese A5 Wagyu steak in Vegas.  Offered as a New York steak;  10 ounces, $198.   Of course, eating this would be BORING.

Multiple revisits, always a twist!

Last night, I had the realization that I am a true Scottsdale girl and I'm quite alright living in my Scottsdale nightlife bubble. 

Here are some differences I noted: 

Scottsdale: If you look good and are female, you get in for free and probably drink for free. 

Hurricane Bay: If you look good and are female, thug looking dudes will stand outside of your car making sex faces, causing you to make your male friend come and get you for fear of what happens if you open that door and walk out there alone. Then you pay $10 to get into a not so hoppin Halloween party. Guys hump your ass without asking and without buying you a drink first. 

Dress code for males in Scottsdale: Nice jeans, button down shirt, shaved or carefully groomed, and they usually smell like nice cologne. 

Hurricane Bay: wife beater and jeans that haven't been washed in weeks. Hair that says I just got out of jail and tats to match. Standard cologne called BO. 

Drinks are strong but their well vodka has to be a step above Gordon's. 

Also, I think there may be dealers right outside selling rohypnol. Needless to say it is a creeper's paradise. 

I'll stick with Blue, thank you!

"Oi, this pint is cold!"  I call to the barkeep.

"Bloody well right.  We're not in London mate.  This is America" and a laugh.   

America, the land of "Hot Pockets".  Hot Pockets, pasties; toe-may-toe, toe-mah-toe.  Only difference, these are bloody good.

For the traditionalist, the Oggie; traditional Cornish pasty is hearty and comforting.  A "stew" of  beef, potatoes, onion, and rutabaga stuffed in a well seasoned, perfectly cooked through, semi rich pastry shell.  Despite the filling being moist, and the bottom being thin, it is still firm enough to pickup.  Impressive.  A side of mushy peas with it's baby food consistency and vegetal flavor provides the perfect accompaniment.

The crust lends itself well to non traditional pasties.  The chicken tikka masala hearty with a pronounced Indian curry taste, mild heat but somewhat dry chicken breast.  The Shepherd's pie with its flavorful, juicy, gamy lamb, creamy potatoes and root veg also good except for the odd addition of cheddar cheese,  Finally bangers and mash (sausage with onions and potatoes in a red wine gravy) good eats.  The slight acidity in the red wine gravy brings out the sage flavor of the British banger. 

Beer works best with the pasties.  Very good selection including many British offerings.  Reasonable, off Strip pricing.

Great, off Strip service.

A single pasty is a meal and at less than $10 each, good value.  It's not perfect but at this price, who's complaining.

Do not order large drinks here. 

They use the same amount of coffee in all sizes. Coffee is the most expensive part of an espresso drink, selling larger drinks with the same amount of coffee at premium prices is dishonest. 

I know of NO other shop that sells coffee in this manner, a large drink always means more coffee.

One star until this policy changes.

EDIT: 

Just physically removed from Roosevelt Tavern by the owner Matt Poole (same owner of Giant) because: 

"You are an asshole. You proved it by not fixing your Yelp! review for over two weeks. You are not welcome in any of my places ever again." 

I responded that this was actually the first time I'd ever spoken directly with him, he said I owed him a phone call and that I didn't know how social media worked. By leaving a bad review I was stealing food from his children's mouth. ?? 

Also the owner of Matt's Big Breakfast, keep this in mind when you're deciding where to spend your hard earned money.

Well in the end not all Filiberto's are alike. 

I came here for a late lunch, around two-thirty. The outside had a modern look, similar to the one on Indian Bend, near the 101 Loop. 

Once inside, I noticed the walls were bright and freshly painted (photo).  The seats however were dilapidated. Almost every single one was ripped, with exposed cushions and springs. One had a jagged piece of metal sticking in the air.

The food on the other hand was good standard Mexican fair. I had two huge bean burritos, which were filling and made on a flaky grilled tortilla.  They were only $5.28 before tax. 

There is nothing wrong with the food, or the employees. They were all very nice and friendly!  Too bad they have to work in such a dump. 

The owner needs to blowout the seating and take a little more interest in the store!  

I might be back, but only at the drive-thru window.  I should have gone to Los Betos across the street. Ugh!

Cut remains one of the top steakhouses in Vegas.  Why the update?  The return of real Japanese beef to the menu.

Excess Foodie Trivia:  Japanese Wagyu beef varies in quality and flavor depending on sub species, rearing, and environment.  There are dozens of Wagyu "brands", the top being Matsusaka Ushi (virgin females fed rice and beer, massaged daily producing extremely deep even marbling, whose fat is the only one that melts at human body temperature).  Kobe with its rice like aroma and Omi with its viscous fat round out the top three.  Regardless of brand and ranking in Japan, all are far beyond the quality of the best USDA Prime.

Back to Cut. Outstanding starters are modified seasonally.  I'm longing for Autumns return and the incredible carpaccio with celery hearts, truffle hollandaise and shaved white Alba truffles.  Perhaps the perfect version of a carpaccio, white truffles enhance the sweet, mineral beef flavor and the otherworldly white truffle hollandaise it's richness all surrounded by an umame fog of aromas.  The bone marrow flan is extremely rich, it's flavor sweetened by an earthy mushroom marmalade and brightened by an herbaceous, green parsley salad.   Excellent.

To the beef.  All grilled over hardwood for a gentle smoked flavor and finished under a broiler.  Well seared, very evenly cooked, always to temperature.

In general, bone in USDA prime cuts are gently aged deriving their beefy flavor from the bone.  Hearty beefy texture and deep beef flavor.  The boneless cuts have more aging and a nuttier, more pronounced umame goodness.  Slightly greasy, mouth feel and lingering flavor.  Very high quality AMERICAN steaks.  

The American wagyu, very tender, sweet, mild beef flavor.  Extremely rich whose fat leaves a slight cloying mouth feel..

Finally,  Japanese wagyu from Saga prefecture.  A4 quality.  Deep, even marbling.  Very sweet with a good beef flavor.  Extremely rich.  Very smooth mouth feel, the fat is not cloying having the viscosity of wine, not olive oil. Excellent.

Many return visits, still no desert.

Service remains Steakhouse refined and efficient.  

The wine list remains excellent.

Prices match the quality but hey, it's Vegas, all it takes is one spin.

I mean.. whats there to say that hasnt been said already... This review is based solely on the SLS casino, not the restaurants or shops. 

We pulled up to Valet and we were told it was for hotel guests only. but they let us valet anyways. which was nice. As soon as you walk in you are hit with the dingiest smells of all smells. stale smoke. I am not a fan of the cigarette but it is what it is. We were completely underwhelmed by it all. The "cool factor" felt forced. Almost like a 50 year old woman wearing purple eye shadow and dressed head to toe in some gaudy animal print. Bad vibes all around. I seriously couldn't leave my boyfriend for 5 minutes to use the restroom without 3 hookers approaching him. I mean seriously, the infestation of hookers alone will keep us away from this place.

We were insanely underwhelmed. And its really too bad with places like Bazzar Meats, Fred Seigle, and Life nightclub, I wish they would have gone to different venues. We will be back for those places alone. But as for the SLS... good luck on not going bankrupt your first year.

This place is so cool. There is just really no other way to describe it. I love coming here. I love eating here. I love the people who work here. I love their burgers and I really love their sweet potato fries. They taste like dessert. I love their martinis, I've tried a few, and if you ask the bartender for a "surprise martini" like I did, he will bounce back with a cherrylimeaide thing.. delish! I love the sinks in the bathroom and I loved my egg white omelet I ate this morning along with the muddled grape fruit drink on the brunch menu, I forget the name of it but its yummy.. I also love this place because I won a gift card for them at the OYE last week, and I never win anything. ever. I now associate winning with FEZ and that is just awesome.

SLS = STAY THE F*CK AWAY

What, the acronym doesn't match? Well, it doesn't f*cking matter, because you should avoid this place like the f*cking plague.

Here is a (too long) list of things that went wrong during our less-than-48-hours stay:

1. The elevator in the attached parking structure broke down TWICE for extended periods of time.

2. LiFE Nightclub didn't let anyone in until about 11:30 Friday night despite a HUGE line outside because of an isolated power outage.

3. THERE WAS NO HOT WATER FOR AT LEAST 6 HOURS ON ONE OF THE NIGHTS. THIS IS THE MIDDLE OF F*CKING VEGAS WINTER AND YOU HAVE NO HOT WATER?! SERIOUSLY?!

4. Despite all of the above, it still took me and my dad hours of bitch-mayhem at the front desk to get our ridiculous $28/night resort fee waived.

5. Housekeeping was EXTREMELY cheap. Used up toiletries were NOT replaced the second day.

I would give this place zero stars if Yelp allowed it. But since I'm forced to give it at least one star, I will say that the hotel rooms do have cool illuminated infinity mirrors. But that's it.

Where other companies implode old hotels and rebuild something new and magnificent, SBE only slightly remodeled the old Sahara.

NEVER AGAIN.

Before you read my review, read David B's. It's much better and more informative. After you finish his, then read mine. Ok? It's because I'm going by memory from 4 years ago and David B. lives in Phoenix and has just been there.

I was born in Scottsdale, went to school in Phoenix and go to Giant's/A's/Angel's/Padre's/Brewer's/Mariner's and now the Dodger's for Spring Training. The desert is in my blood with all of the red sandstone rocks, cactus, roadrunners, and bluebelly lizards. As a child, I would go out and collect boys things... like snakes, crawdads, eggs, aquamarines, agates, spiders, then bring them home to an unhappy Mother. But I also went to school with actual Native-American kids who would wear their cool native clothes and so I got hooked on everything-Indian. Plus, we would go on amazing school field-trips to the local museums. Yea, for getting out of school...

The Heard is known as the other major Phoenix destination besides the Phoenix Arts Museum but I personally feel it is much better. It is world-class in its exhibits of Native American artifacts, such as pottery, katsina dolls, sand paintings, rugs, baskets, textiles, jewelry, blankets, it's all here. If you love American history, especially Indian, you have to come here and soak it all in. 

The founders, Dwight and Maie Bartlett, loved their Southwest and therefore collected as much as they could afford, then fulfilled their ultimate dream to share it all with the public in 1929.

Most people don't realize it because not much is taught about them, but our native Indians were so creative and amazing people who had such an artist's heart and desire to express themselves and the Heard really shows their work off to the highest degree. There are 39,000 items of cultural and fine art, including drawings, painting and sculpture. Of all of the possibilities to see when you visit, the core of the collection includes 500 simply incredible Hopi katsini dolls that were on loan from the exclusive Goldwater and Harvey Companies. Ritualistic, religious, complex and often hidden meanings are withheld in each individual katsini and I love them for their mystery. Another exhibit that I love because I am just a big kid is the full-sized Navajo Hogan, the Hopi piki room, the Yaqui ramada and the Pueblo oven. Maybe someday I can sneak in and stay over night.

So, in summary, if you ever visit Phoenix, you have to go to both the Heard and the PAM plus the Taliesin West (I always spell that wrong) building by Frank Lloyd Wright. It isn't all pools, spas, baseball and golf after all.

Pork Belly. Smoked Salmon and Creme Fraiche. It's like Paula Deen and Wolfgang Puck got together, downed a bottle of Pinot, made culinary love and "wa la"..this is their baby. A thin crust with the freshest ingredients. I must say y'all...(for the Paula) fans...it was fabulous. And "BAM" for the Wolfie fans as I am craving this as I review. 

We walked into Brick on a slow Sunday evening. Didn't expect a big crowd as it was the holiday weekend. We bucked up to the bar (that's how I roll) and had immediate and friendly service from Santos.

My friend Kirk raved about the tuna tartare and he was spot on Mary. Served in a chilled martini glass with lightly cinnamon dusted fried won tons. This was a crunchy, fresh, delicious culinary experience. I even added it to my Oprah grateful journal. The "corn cakes" (more like pancakes) with more silky smoked salmon were good. Hard to follow heaven in a glass. I cannot for the life of me remember the third appetizer. Hmm...is that not a good sign?

I know I sipped a bit of Kirk's Spritzer. Yep. Spritzer my gays and friend of gays. But this wasn't your mama's spritzer. This had Hendrick's Gin and it was fabulous! 

Undeniably named after all the brick walls, Brick also had a modern, fresh feel. When I think of Brick I think of lick. As in finger lickin' good. Can't wait to return!

Slice window review!

Skip! ... end of review. The only time you should be here is if you're in too much of a rush to eat anywhere else. Due to the chewy dough, unremarkable sauce and the fact that they might have been sitting there all day, all of the slices are mediocre at best. Everything seems pretty low quality, maybe a slight step up from Domino's or Papa Johns. It seems like you can get some higher quality items inside, so maybe do yourself a favor and eat in there, but from what I've seen from the 3 slices I've rocked here, that might not be much better. 

Prices: $4 plain slice, $5 one topping, $5.75 specialty slices...bleh
Compare that to Pop Up Pizza who is serving 2 specialty slices and a soda for $7 and some change :/

UPDATE 9/8/14 - Just reading through recent comments that clearly mirror my experience. Then I saw the review by "John C" on 5/23/14 on here stating that they "stayed there on bank holiday" and would "stay there again". Therein lies one of the ongoing problems that sadly hasn't changed since we moved out. It is NOT a hotel and should not have transient people staying there on holiday. Sad, yet not surprised to see the state of affairs at Ogden seems to be getting worse, not better.

While I appreciate everything that Tony Hsieh and Zappos are doing for downtown, I do not enjoy sharing this building with them! Tony lives in the building and another 50 or so Zappos employees live here as well. In addition, Zappos uses a lot of the units for offices and "crash pads", where visitors to Zappos and the Downtown Project spend a couple of nights then move on. On my floor alone, there are about 8 residents, the rest of the units are rented out by Zappos. Parking is a joke as there is only 1 space per unit, even for a 2 bedroom unit (where does the other occupant park, you might ask? Wherever you can find an open space downtown). The guest spaces in the garage are taken by tourists and people going out downtown looking for free parking and the many daily Zappos visitors. The music is unbearably loud, even at 4:00am and often rattles the windows. Homeless people use the dog run area as their personal outhouse (gross). If you enjoy living with rude, high 20 year-olds whose rent is being paid by their boss and therefore have no consideration or appreciation for where they live or those around them, then this is the place for you. If you prefer some sense of decency, organization and civility, look elsewhere!

This is a nice casual place to get some fish. They cook it up anyway you want it (cue Journey), whether it be fried, grilled, blackened, etc.

I have ordered the Taco Mountain every time I've been there. You have a choice of other types of meat besides fish. I always go for the fish. I find that the fish is always fresh and cooked just right. The next time I go in there I'll have to order something different. Pro Tip - This place is a zoo during Fridays when Lent is in season. When you can't find a parking spot, you might as well go with Plan B.

Yodel -Le - He-Ho!!!   Been dying for some food to remind you of the French Alps? Yes? Well I have got a beautiful place for you to try ... a bit of  yumminess right here on Bell rd... Crepes, Tartines and Fondue ..what more could you ask for ? How about an ice cave ? Yes just when you thought that you'd never see an ice cave for comedians and what not ..there it is...  Seriously... right on the Bar side of the restaurant... Okay new place to try kids and it is really tasty. Husband and  I had the Scallop/Mediterre  Savory Crepe which was lovely  and the Jamon Frankekuchen --which translates loosely   "tasty ham / pear pizza with crescent roll crust  " super delicious ... now the shocker was the over hazelnutation of the  sweet  crepe...   wholly  nutella folks  ...too much ... but yet we ate it all. 
The interior begs for you to take this place seriously as a french
 /swiss alps restaurant  and to be honest it does remind me of a bistro we ate in Lucerne, Switzerland... , there  really is a fake ice cave ala the matterhorn area of Disneyland ,which the owner plans on using as a stage for comedians ..I am laughing already. 
There also is a crepe cam  which shows the making of the crepes in the kitchen  and is televised to the bar  area..ah.. neat.   

Call me and lets go get a crepe together!!

I only come here to see one technician and that's Jannette.  I've actually been seeing Jannette for years.  She use to work at a shop by my work place but has since moved on to Blooming Nails & Spa.  She's thorough, patient, and is really easy to talk to.  She's really popular among other clients so sometimes the person in charge of booking can overlap appointments but she never lets that influence her work.  She gets the job done right no matter what.  Did I say how detailed her designs are?  They're on-point and she can do ANYTHING.  She has like 15 years of experience doing nails.

Anyways, I've never had a bad experience here.  They have a good selection of services, a wide array of color choices for gels and lacquers, prices are reasonable, and their pedicure chairs are comfy.  Plus everything is nice and clean so my fear of germs is non-existent here.  It's a long drive from Chandler but it's worth it as long as Jannette is working!

Life's too short for boring nails --- That's why I go to Blooming Nails & Spa!

The Chandelier is a multi-story love bar in the middle of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. It's a memorable setting with memorable drinks and plenty of unique couches, seats, and tables. It's easy to find a spot just right for you and your friends.

Plus one star for having several flavors of Hangar One Vodka available!

Another bonus star for super friendly, but efficient servers. No complaints at all.

My wife rated the Cosmopolitan hotel's house Cosmopolitan ($15) her favorite drink in Vegas. If she's happy, then I'm happy. 

I was looking for something different and tried a cocktail called Bruce Tea ($14) with Kai Coconut Pandanus Vodka, St. George Thai Basil Eau de Vie, Lemongrass-infused Coconut Cream, Birdseye Chili, Ginger Puree, Kaffir Lime Leaves, and sprinkled with Matcha Tea Powder. It was too different. I switched to Hangar One Mandarin and Tonic ($14) for the rest of the evening.

If you are staying or visiting the Cosmopolitan Hotel, it will be hard to miss the giant crystal strands of the Chandelier. It may not be a destination bar, but it is the best bar at the Cosmopolitan. Don't miss the opportunity to relax for a few rounds of drinks.

A cool place to check out AT NIGHT for some cheesy fun! The light show is the main attraction : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=o6mHisZZA0tj7RjX7W1ccw.
Came here to check out the ZIPLINING (Freemont Flightlines) and the light show. Tons of people- GREAT people watching. Saw some familiar faces : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=baqnWN8WDv_vdGcYDljwNg. 
My favorite group was this one: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=cvn4V62FYXTCGj7WLVx4tg
I also saw a Justin Bieber look alike here, with his mom heading out near his bedtime. You can check out a live 80's cover band, street performers, cheap eats- my favorite thing here was the time when the neon light show overhead plays "We Will Rock You" from Queen. Forgot to get my deep fried twinkie to complete my experience...

They charge for parking (what?) in the structure, so park at the nearby hotels like the CAL instead.

I came here yesterday for the first time and thought, wow Culver's has merged with Portillo's. Then my food came and realized it was more like a takeoff of Steak 'n Shake.

The atmosphere at Freddy's is very much like a cross between Johnny Rockets (lots of shinny nickel) and Steak 'n Shake. Actually when I think of it, Steak 'n Shake is more like Johnny Rockets, LOL. 

I believe my friends Kay and Monica are both right; with reality for me somewhere between their two reviews.  Granted I only had a Chicago Dog ($3.39), a Chili Dog ($3.59), a medium drink ($1.79) but the tab was a bit pricey at $9.48. 

Because the tube steaks are Vienna Beef, their taste is very good. The Chili dog was tasty, but I'll skip their Chicago interpretation next time. It comes on a Nedick's (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nedick's) like toasted slice bread bun, where the dog is trying to escape the toppings (see photos) 

The hot dogs also appear to be only #10s (10 to the pound), so I'll go with the burgers next time. If Freddy's was only a hot dog place, I probably would skip it in the future. But I enjoyed myself and want to try those steakburgers. Again, think Steak 'n Shake but without the Five-Way Chili

So Three Stars "A-Okay and I'll give Freddy's another try in a few weeks.

After a week of attending this yoga studio, I was no longer able to ignore my loudly-clanging bullshit detector, and had to quit. Nothing personal against this particular franchise...my beef is with Bikram yoga in general. Doing a Bikram class feels like working out at the Jonestown Athletic Club!

Bikram devotees strike me as slightly brainwashed in their adherence to the cult of Bikram. This is reinforced at the end of every class, when everyone utters a monotone "Namaste" in unison, while laying flat on the floor with heels touching and palms out. Heaven's Gate, anyone? 
 
Another thing I found creepy is that the instructors are required to recite pretty much word-for-word from a script. Funny quips and jokes are more robotic, less funny when you've heard them over and over ("Japanese ham sandwich"). They also have to repeat Bikram's mangled English ("Put your exactly forehead to your knee"). Exactly forehead? WTF is that?
 
I'm not blaming the instructors -- it's Bikram himself (Bikram Choudhury, who devised this regimen in the early '70s) who insists that all his franchisees follow his shtick TO THE LETTER if they want to keep teaching. Yes that's right -- FRANCHISEES; it's a freakin' FRANCHISE that will set you back $10,000 and then $1,000 a month. That's in addition to the $10,500 fee for taking the required instructors' course. Think of all the Bikram studios across the U.S. The humble yogi is raking it in!
 
Well, at least he's honest about it. Direct quote from Bikram: "Bikram yoga is so big. This is a bathroom slipper you buy (for) $2 in Kmart. But you put Bikram on it, it'll sell for $35 in a second." I'll give him props for his balls. Oh, speaking of his balls, here's another direct quote: "I'm beyond Superman. I have balls like atom bombs, two of them, 100 megatons each. Nobody fucks with me."
 
Indeed, back in 2000 he sued a couple of yoga techers in CA for teaching a modified version of Bikram (they had the audacity to add music and lower the thermostat in the room from the sacrosanct 105 degrees, 40% humidity). The case was settled out of court.
 
In addition to these ethical quibbles, I'm not so sure about the health benefits of doing a strenuous workout in a 105-degree room. They say I will sweat out all the "toxins" in my system. As far as I know, sweat is just salt and water. I didn't see any booze, shrooms or trans fats rolling down my face.
 
I was going to finish my 30-day trial membership at Bikram Yoga Summerlin, just to give it a fair shake. Maybe I'd end up getting over my reservations, lose 10 pounds, become more grounded, and be able to sleep well again....??? 
 
Then I came to my senses and went back to Las Vegas Athletic Club... which costs me $9/month and offers a variety of un-copyrighted, unpretentious yoga classes. Holla!

You gotta feel it, It's electric!

I hope you're prepared to boogie woogie for almost an entire year, cause that's about how long you'll be waiting for a chance to slide into your own all electric Tesla. 

You gotta know it, it's electric. With up to a 300 mile all electric battery range, the Model S (and all Tesla's) are custom built to customer specifications; they begin delivering this years models in fall of 2012, but you've got to already be on the list to get yours. These baby's start at $57,000 (for model S) with a 160 mile range and can sport up to a 300 miles with an upgrade to the batteries ($77,000). You're in luck though, cause right now you can get a sleek $7,500 tax credit from the US Federal Government for buying electric!

But you know it's there, plug in everywhere. Model S comes standard with everything needed to plug in to any 240 or 120 volt outlet or public charging station. Charge yourself about 100 miles worth in 3 hours in a standard 110, or 100 miles in 1.5 hours from a 240 volt charging station. If you're worried about un-necessary charging and wasted electricity, the charge shuts off after the battery has reached capacity; I asked the Tesla rep!

I've got to move, come let me take you on a party ride. Racing from 0 to 60 in 5.6 seconds with 0 emissions, Al Gore might just throw you a party for helping to save the planet. This beauty is sleekly styled with aerodynamic feel, and toutes a low center of gravity with their innovative floor mounted battery design achieving optimal weight distribution. Be the envy of all your friends (eventually) with a 17'' driver control touch screen, and connect up all your Bluetooth or USB devices.

Some say it's mystic, it's electric. Nothing mystic about it, this is American engineering and ingenuity at its finest! Man I wish I had one. Although, I'd have a tough time re-charging without an outlet nearby my parking spot. Maybe I could talk to the neighborhood HOA about that one.

Stop in to their storefront located inside Scottsdale Fashion Square on the second floor. Yelpers, it's time you learned the electric slide, but in Tesla style!

A great place for a great  happy hour!

I love how they start early, at 2PM goes to 6PM. They have beers for $5, wine and cocktails for $7. I'm not a fan of mojitos, but their Poolside Cruzan Mojito is really good! It's so much more refreshing than any mojitos I've ever had!

Their bar bites are $5-$9. They have a lot of interesting things like Po-Boy sliders, crawfish fritters, and ahi tuna tacos, but I didn't have any of that. I had their $1.50 oysters instead. It was so fresh like they just got their oysters from the ocean that day!

My husband was so in love with their oysters that we decided to come back before our flight back to San Jose. He said they were some of the best he ever had. With suitcases in hand, we practically ran here. We were 3 minutes late for happy hour and the hostesses insisted that happy hour was over. That was fair and that was fine, but I was a bit irritated when one of them said, "We already have a long happy hour." At least she forced a smile on her snobby face when she said that.

So, I've been on a bit of a hiatus from yelping for the last two weeks or so, but with good reason... I delivered my incredible baby boy at this hospital and I've since been getting into the routine of being a mommy.

My experience with labor and delivery at Scottsdale Healthcare Shea was top notch.  Everyone from the administrative people who I checked in with, to all of the doctors and nurses were amazing.  I went through 3 shifts of nurses during my labor/delivery, and they were fabulous!  My anesthesiologist was incredible too - thank goodness for that epidural!  And best of all, my OB/GYN was there for my actual delivery.  

Once Mav made his appearance, we stayed at the hospital another 48 hours or so, and all of the hospital staff we dealt with there were wonderful as well.  

One thing to note is that this hospital does not have a nursery.  Once your baby arrives, you are in the same room as the baby... nurses are there to help, but you can't just "send the baby to the nursery," as I hear you can do at other hospitals.  I was sleep deprived, but I didn't mind this as I was able to bond with Maverick right away.

Other perks that I was impressed with were the size of the rooms, the fact that everything appeared clean and sanitized, the "room service" from the hospital cafeteria, the snacks available to patients, the videos available to help prepare you for being a parent, etc... but again, I cannot stress enough how impressed I was with the nurses.  Special kudos to Pam for getting me started and visiting after the baby came, Maggie for coaching me through the pushing, Cassie for her integral help post delivery, and all of the rest of the staff who I can't mention by name because I was in a drugged / hormonal state during my stay at this hospital.

I'm not a huge fan of hospitals in general, but again, I had a fabulous experience here and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hospital to anyone.

Located on the 2nd floor of the California Hotel. If it weren't for the long wait times to get your food and CASH ONLY, this place would be 5 stars in my book. The food portions are huge and decently priced. You know this place is authentic when you see an abundance of Hawaiian customers. 

I love the food here, but I still haven't forgiven them for making me miss my flight. The day after some qt and barhopping with the bff, he was craving Hawaiian and thought we had time to grab some lunch here before taking me to McCarran. It would've been true if we went somewhere else!!

We ordered our food to-go and waited about 50 mins until we got it. The wait is ridiculous! Of course I missed my opportunity to check in on time and I had to scramble to find another flight. I had the most expensive spam musubis ever that day hahah ($180 for last minute flight to LAX).

The newest kid on the strip is still the sexiest!

Yup, as soon as you walk into the lobby, you are invited in with the allure of large glass columns with ever changing themes. Chic mirrors and chandeliers dripping with crystals from the ceiling and everything around you just seems to sparkle with a sleek, sexy flare that is all Vegas. 

I checked in for the July 4th weekend and got up sold by a very aggressive front desk clerk that insisted on getting me into the penthouse.  I settled for a 910sq. ft. angle suite on the 58th floor with additional Japanese soaking tub, terrace with a view of the Bellagio fountains, kitchenette with fridge & microwave and an additional full sized bath with shower. Not too shabby.   

The room I must say was very spacious, the view off the expansive terrace was breathtaking and i used the soaking tub practically every night after the clubs so it worked out great!

My only complaint was with housekeeping.  There's a circular red paper note you're supposed to leave on the bed to have your linens changed, which i did but every night i came back to the room, my sheets were done but not changed! It was ridonkulous! Even the dirty pillow that had some sketchy black skid mark smeared on it (that i never used from day one) remained in my room til the last day i was there....nuts!

Perhaps all the smoke and mirrors at the entrance lobby had me blinded by the hotel's sexy charm but with all due respect, my stay was very enjoyable and despite the minor flaws, I had a fantastic time... 

With that said, the hotel was conveniently located in the heart of the strip. It's steps away from the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood and Paris...and the Sahra Spa, brunch and pool were very enjoyable...and partying at the Marquee & Bond was priceless!


Happy Times!

Let me start this Yelp by saying I've never given the business to a stripper. Are we clear? Ok.

I'll tell you why this place gets five stars... Because not one but two of the dancers offered to go home with me. 

One for $250. She said "If you have $250, we can go somewhere together." And then she licked my ear and showed me her guns. Her shift was over and she was in street clothes, mind you.

So guess what happened next? 

Stripper two (who actually did leave with me - long story) said, "Gross, some skanky girl licked you and her breath was terrible." I was embarrassed, yet psychologically removed from that experience.

What happened with Stripper two is a great story but I don't know that I want to share it here. But if you go to this club, one piece of advice (Useful alert!): the less attractive dancers require money to leave with you. The self-possessed hotter ones do not. However, if you get her naked in your bed, do no verify pre-coitus that she is not, in fact, a prostitute, because she will leave and call you names as your front door slams behind her. Or so my buddy tells me. Such trifling arrows of human amusement are not found in this man's quiver of irresponsible behavior.

SCUM BAGS! I wish i could give negative stars. came in here for them to fix my AC in my Mercedes since it all of a sudden just stopped working. The guy behind the counter told me he had put a ultra violet wash through my AC to see where it was leaking. That was 82$ My AC worked for about 4 days and once again went out. So i brought it back and the guy (at the same location) told me they couldn't see where it was leaking from. He started using his "mechanic talk" and told me he could fix it. 162$ later i paid in cash and it just so happened their printer wasn't working so i couldn't get a receipt. Then as i was leaving the other guy behind the counter (skinny, shorter) asked me if i had weed in my car. I said No and he said "Damn i was going to ask if i could buy some from you" uhhh WTF! 
And once again, my AC went out 3 days later. I ended up going to a different mechanic and told them about the UV flush. This mechanic took me into the shop and put up a black light and no trace of UV was seen. He ended up putting the flush through my car and 2 weeks later i took it back and he put the black light up again, you could clearly see the neon residue everywhere and where it was leaking.
I called the Big O Tires and spoke to a manager. I told him about what happened & he said there was nothing in the computer about me coming in the 2nd time, or paying any money. He also said their wasn't anything in my file about a UV flush. I felt so cheated and deceived. I really hope this review gets out there and lets everyone know to STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.

Oh, not right now? Well, if you had a fun group like we did and everyone was doing sake bombs then that is what you would be chanting before you take your group shot. Remember to out-do any groups surrounding you.. That's what we tried to do. Tip: Try their pomegranate one ;)

I have been here before when it was Geisha House and it did NOT impress me so I am glad that it is now Kanji. If you have never tried teppanyaki before then I suggest trying it here so you can see it done right.

The staff is attentive, hilarious, and will drink with you. 
Pro Tip: Do the Ji Shot (thank me later).

My favorite starter was the Beef Tataki, great presentation and tasted amazing. The egg rolls and shrimp tempura were also ordered and shared amongst all of us. 

Our teppan chef was Joshua, who was very skilled and entertaining. He kept our group cracking up the whole time he was cooking our food on the iron griddle. Thanks for giving us food shaped as a big heart, Spongebob, flowers, and all the other things you came up with during the cooking process! It was all so delicious, especially the steak.

I will be back for more and to try out the Green Tea Cheesecake that I was too full to order!

In my best Charlie Sheen, "Windsor. Winner. Windsor. Winner!"

I had the MOST attentive service from our greeting at the door, to our seating in back, to our beverage service...ooops, then a small lapse in service...no biggie I was enjoying the vibe and the ambience.

Ordered the Double Dip...sadly the name reminded me of my buddies in college when they would chew tobacco, sometimes they would "double dip"....gross I know. The concept of this dip is a cobb salad made into a dip served with a chipotle salsa (didn't get much smoky chipotle flavor however...which is fine since my little petite self is sensitive to spicy food...I mean my mom would serve potato chips and ketchup and called it chips and salsa...but I digress). I would order the dip again, but I have to say it really tasted just like egg salad. And fortunately I loves me some egg salad!

My rueben sandwich was OUTSTANDING and I chose a side of mac n cheese which was total bliss (NOT plugging a restaurant downtown btw)....that was the word I said as cheese and a chunk of elbow macaroni slid down my chin. Pleasant, I know. My friend was doing the Meg Ryan orgasm scene as he enjoyed his bbq pulled chicken sandwich. 

I'm sure we looked ridiculous. But we were ridiculously happy. 

Welcome to the neighborhood Windsor. Let's totally hang out more often!

I had no idea WTF paddle boarding was, but my boyfriend invited me... and my life philosophy is to say "yes" to everything. 

I was kinda hesitant because I am EXTREMELY uncoordinated and un-athletic. I was always the last picked for volleyball and all that in school, so I was kind of afraid to make an ass of myself in front of my jock b.f. But I sacked up and tried it anyway....and surprise!! It's super easy!!

Basically, it's a giant surfboard you stand on, and paddle around with a long oar, like a canoe. It's shockingly easy to keep your balance, and not too hardcore a workout. I paddled pretty much around the entire lake, and wasn't even sore the next day.

The Lake itself is just the right size to paddle around...about a mile and half long from end to end. You can paddle right up to the docks of the pretentious asses who live out there (bonjour, Celine), or cruise past golf courses and a fake Italian village. At the other end, the landscape is pretty much just barren desert...which is much cooler, in its way.

As far as the actual paddleboarding business, the staff was super cool and gave me a quick beginner lesson before sending me on my way. It's something like $30 for an hour, but you also get access to the Westin pool (super nice) and 20% off your food and bev purchases there. So not a bad deal!

On a final note, I was especially careful not to fall overboard while paddling, since the water in fake-ass Lake Las Vegas is treated wastewater from Vegas. YUCK! The last thing I want to do is flounder around in Vegas's leftover piss and amniotic fluid...no matter HOW much they claim to treat it!!

My only complaint about Short Leash is that they don't follow me around town in the food cart, which means I cannot eat delicious hot dog concoctions all day! How unfair is that?!?

Well, Amber... we all know you are a VEGAN, so why do you want to be followed around by a hot dog cart? 

Well, Reader... Short Leash has VEGGIE DOGS! That is right... this delicious, convenient, amazing food cart has VEGGIE DOGS!

The bread, however, is not vegan. But that is fine, because they chop up your wiener into little bite sized pieces and load it up with one of the many (50+??) ingredients they have available. And when you don't get it with bread, you get two!

I top my double wiener with pinto beans, sauteed onions, green chilies, jalapenos, and tomatoes. I'm going to come up with a name and have them name one special after me.

Excellent customer service, positive vibe, delicious, high-quality ingredients, and I legally get to say wiener six times in 1 review!

One sentence... IT'S WORTH THE MONEY. Lifetime fitness is truly a way of life, not just a gym. With three stories of endless equipment, classes, and a rock climbing wall you will find everything you need here. 

My boyfriend and I recently joined and have spent a vast majority of our free time using all lifetime has to offer. With two pools (one inside and one outside) a health cafe, various fitness classes (i live to practice yoga) and numerous machines it's very easy to spend the day here. 

I recently have been using the steam room as well. It's infused with eucalyptus... Need I say more?

My personal trainer Emily has been amazing as well. I'm really enjoying our sessions and the results.

I highly recommend this place to anyone. The price of $144 a month is a little steep for some but making that commitment make me want to work out even harder. 

If you're looking for a gym in the summerlin area this place is worth a trial.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 40/100

Quite a pleasure to see while visiting Vegas! There is a huge lake in front of the Bellagio hotel, which is where the water fountain show takes place every 15-30 minutes. My boyfriend and I recently watched it this past weekend and it was wonderful! The particular show we watched was played along to the song, "All That Jazz." 

As much as I loved watching these fountains, I still think that I wasn't as impressed as I could have been. I've watched World Of Color at California Adventure in Anaheim, CA, and I think that World Of Color is MUCH more impressive than the Fountains of Bellagio. Don't get me wrong, the Bellagio fountains are great and definitely the landmark on the strip, BUT they aren't the best I've ever seen.

Chino Bandido is my guilty pleasure. It is utterly unhealthy food served in an aluminum foil bowl, delivered by a casually dressed employee who shouts your name until you claim it. And, you get a soft snickerdoodle cookie, as if there were not enough calories and carbs in the meal itself.

It's a dive. Black and white checkered floors. Murals and polaroids of customers mounted on the walls behind plastic.

Ayesha is right. It's a love/hate kind of place; and, those who love it will blurt out what they order at the mere mention - it's practically involuntary. 

Me? I'm "jerk chicken add black beans." I have the number programmed into my phone so I can call in my order.

It's also addictive for those who like it. I am generally compelled to visit Chino within 72 hours of hearing someone mention it.

Here's the thing about Chino Bandido: it is NOT Chinese and it is NOT Mexican. It is Chino Bandido. It's its own animal. 

To try to label it can only lead to disappointment. So, I suggest: 
~ Know that we are not talking fast food prices -- a one item bowl with a soft drink is $9.15.
~ Enter with an open mind. 
~ Proceed immediately to the counter under the menu with all the pictures on it and tell the employee it's your first time. The employee will slip you a bunch of samples so you can taste what you're in for. 
~ Figure out what you like and accept help from the employee while you complete the unique order form (which is also demonstrated on the website: http://www.chinobandido.com/order.html).
~ Enjoy!

Have you ever watched those dumb/boring/nerdy space documentaries that tell you lies regarding the impossibility of time travel? Some dude with a talking computer tells you "...currently, there is no way to deviate from the space-time continuum"... Lies! I'll tell you how to do it.  You don't even need to buy a time machine on eBay like Kip Dynamite. Just get into your car (no, it doesn't have to be a Delorian) and drive to 7th Ave and Thomas Rd (just south of Thomas on the E side), and BAM! You, my friend have entered another dimension.

You walk into this place and you expect to see Cowboy Biff sitting at the bar. Unfortunately, all you see is elderlies shuffling about. Well, they must know something that we all don't. Like an old man/woman secret that they only tell their peers. You, my friend, have just learned their secret! Sit down and order yourself a Black Bean Burger. What? You say you don't like vegetarian food? Well, neither do I! Trust me. Do it!

While you wait, you can imagine you are your grandpa at 12 years old. Just stopping into the local soda fountain shop to get a smooth refreshing malt. Being a 12 year old in the 1930s, you notice how modern and sleek the decor is in here. Ice cream adverts everywhere... Makes you want to stay 12 forever.

"Mom, can I have some ice cream?" Oh, I mean "Sorry, can I get a strawberry malt with that Black Bean Burger? Ahem, thanks..."

Massive potential to become one of the top destinations for Japanese haute cuisine in Vegas.

Understand, if your idea of Japanese is Raku, Yonaka Modern, or heaven forbid, Goyemon, this is not your place.  Think barMASA minus several hundred bucks.

The components are there, from the authentic dishes showcasing Japanese aesthetics, and suability to the very intimate dining space and 2014 trendy, sketchy strip mall location.  That said, don't go expecting a Michelin dining experience straight from Tokyo rather honest, Japanese food in an environment to match.

Yes, the chef comes from Michelin pedigree.  Yes, he has worked with Morimoto at XEX.  But in true Japanese style, Omae himself is the chef and personally prepares the dishes served.

Selections form the three course lunch menu showcase the chefs talent.  An incredible multi layer vegetable soup with a base of sweet edamame and mixed green veg puree with shitake, above a sweetened earthy soy gelee and to top it off, an airy puree of avocado and sake.  The unevenness of each spoonful elevates the enjoyment.  Sometimes more earthy and salty, other times sweet vegetal flavors with the aroma of the sake.

The chicken based ramen, atypical of any single Japanese regional specialty, showcases an intense chicken broth thickened with its own collagen, hints of sake, soy, and sesame that envelopes perfectly cooked, toothsome wide ramen noodles.  Tender pieces of mirin marinated then just grilled through chicken atop with a soft poached egg.  Very well balanced dish.

If these dishes are any indication of what we can expect from the chef as he expands to dinner service, this could be a real winner.

Note:  $20 three course lunch only until 08.31.14.  $100 multi course dinner 09.03.14 until the end of the month,  $150 thereafter.  Reservations for dinner service required.

I stop at Chloe's Corner about once a week for a quick bite.  They do a nice business because they're the only sandwich place in Kierland Commons, for those of us who work nearby.

Like Sarah Y, I love their Egg Salad sandwiches.  It's creamy without being slopping with a hint of Coleman's mustard.  Another joy is just sitting at the counter and having a fountain drink (see photo).  Besides the Egg Salad, another one of my favorites is their rare Roast Beef sandwich (photo).  Both are delicious.

Chloe's is very reminiscent of the old days, when you could buy a sandwich at Walgreen's.  That how they started off, as a small drugstore serving sandwiches and fountain drinks back in Chicago.  Clearly they grew well beyond that concept.  For those from the east coast, it's like the old Chock-full-of-nuts coffee shops.  By the way, the soups at Chloe's are amazing.

Most of Chloe's sandwiches are in the $6.50 to $7.50 range and are delicious.  Don't forget that they also offer a freshly brewed cup of their signature coffee for only 50 cents!  A bottomless cup as they say.

Enjoy!

That was too easy! I've only lived in Vegas for about a day now but I feel like I've already found the best grooming place in town thanks to Yelp. Not to mention, the best groomer I've had in any of the amazing cities I've lived in. I'm so impressed with how clean and fluffy they got my beloved Blondie. I'm not gonna lie... she was looking a bit rough around the edges. We both were actually. None of us had the time for our usual girlie maintenance like we normally do because we were both smack dab in the middle of moving. I'm sure you know how that goes. However, there are neighbors to meet, places to go, things to do. We needed to get it together. So I looked on Yelp to find a good place and I made an appointment for both of us to go get beautified. Myself at Spa Mio, Blondie at Yuppie Puppies.

I'm pleased to say that Yuppie Puppies transformed my disheveled Maltese into straight "Show Dog" status. Blondie has horrible tear stains and I was having trouble finding groomers in NYC locally that were able to clean that area up and do a really good job consistently. I'm thrilled that Yuppie Puppies was able to get Blondie cleaner than I've seen her in a long time. I was blown away! As you can see from all of the photos I've uploaded, her tear stains have improved under Brooke's grooming. I'm very appreciative of the quality of service I received there and they have more than earned my regular business. Their 5 star reviews are indeed reflective of the excellent job that they do. I shall return.

There are a few things that I aspire to complete before I die. 

1. Visit the Pyramids of Egypt.
2. Get a graduate degree.
3. Use the word "merkin" in a Yelp review.

Looks like I can cross #3 off my list thanks to last night's viewing of Zumanity. Not too many merkins here, but the ones that they did use did prevent any full frontal. 

This is a show best enjoyed by understanding and appreciating the human form and what those human bodies can do (and what humans do with certain human body parts). If you don't want to look at naked women, hear sex sounds, or be embarrassed by potentially going onstage for audience participation (more on that later), I don't recommend this show.

I can personally speak to the fact that they do not have plants in the audience for their audience participation. Yes, yours truly was selected to go onstage and perform with a man from Houston. The adrenaline rush was such that I barely remember it, but my friend and guest to the show Vanessa N. said that I didn't seem nervous at all. 

The show definitely pushes the envelope to "transgressive" but I wouldn't call it groundbreaking. Well maybe I would, considering it has a pretty wide market, potentially opening minds that wouldn't otherwise respect or appreciate outside-the-norm sexuality. 

To recap: don't go with your parents, on a first date, or expecting to see a nice little show about people falling in love. This show is about the thing that got us all here, s-e-x, and does a good job of translating it to the Cirque du Soleil stage.

Japanese restaurant, Chinese chef.  Vegas style.  

Imagine Nobu Matsuhisa in a food truck.  Less refined, pseudo Argentinean Japanese that taste great at a great price.

Small selection of relatively fresh, everyday seafood.  The sushi, AYCE quality (this is not an AYCE restaurant).  Average quality seasoned rice wrapped unevenly around massive amounts of filing or compacted to a brick in a mold and topped with this or that then heavily sauced.  Far from what a sushi master would make but the flavors are good.

Two standout "raw" fish dishes, the yellowtail and the white fish.  The first drowned in a yuzu soy, drizzled with garlic oil and topped with jalapeos and micro cilantro; the second drowned in a wasabi shiso vinaigrette and dusted with dry red miso powder.  Both rapidly cook in the acid and take on a ceviche texture but the flavors are solid.

Also noteworthy, the assortment of taro tostadas  Hamachi with salsa verde, salmon with pico de gallo, and Hawaiian style poke (no there are no pineapples in this) all crowned by an avocado cream and cilantro.  A great bite.

Nobuesque tempura (rock shrimp, king crab, assorted veg and shrimp), all not oily but over battered, masking the flavor what's inside but all work with the non traditional dipping sauces ie miso, yuzu aioli..

Finally the soy braised short rib with wasabi.  Well braised and glazed.  The wasabi cream compliments the earthy soy and cuts the richness of the dish.  Excellent.

Friendly, off Strip service.  Casual decor.  UNBELIEVABLE VALUE at around $20pp.

It's not authentic but it's all Vegas baby.

When I was a little kid my dad would take me to Cowboy Mel's on Main and 2nd Street in downtown Anoka, MN (population 15,000). Me and Dad bonded. Mel smoked a cigar. I learned of Guns and Ammo magazine. Soon a swanky salon, called Barbie Baker Design opened on Main Street and my mom started going there. Well, I was a young, fresh, bursting at the seams, pre puberty, pre knowing I was a homo young man. One day mom asked if I wanted to get a "style cut" (WHAT IS THAT?) at Barbie Baker? I said yes. Mel was stinky and the magazine selection sucked ass. 

When we walked through the doors of Barbie Baker Design (not Salon, not Shop, but Design), the heavens opened up and the choir sang. I was in my element. Cool straight chicks and a gay receptionist named Bruce. Well. I bonded with the salon community. And ever since then enjoyed the salon experience. From Beverly Hills to Manhattan, I've had some fabulous follicle indulgences. 

Here, in Phoenix, I'm lucky enough to receive the BEST cuts from Amina at Ide Mania. Well. Today. I.Snapped. I just need a quick cut. It's July in AZ. It's like a freakin' sauna. Anything to make things cooler. 

Cut to Great Clips in a glamorous strip mall on 7th Ave and Osborn. Me entering. Nervous. Sweating. Embarrassed perhaps. 

Less than 30 minutes I left with a PERFECT summer cut. An enjoyable time with my "stylist"...I mean really there was no shampooing and she never used a scissor. But. I looked good. I mean hot even. I blew kisses at the mirror. Paid my $13 tab and threw a Lincoln her way. Yea. That's how I roll.

I love the salon experience. But I have to holla at Great Clips and the staff. Clean space. Friendly and efficient staff. And Rickie can't stop complimenting me. That is worth $13 times a hundred!

Sorry Korina.

Consistently outstanding Sapporo ramen 5200 miles from the source! (If it doesn't sound far think of it as a minimum of two layovers and 16 hours flying.  Bam!)

Sora is simplicity at its best:

- One bowl of perfectly cooked, slightly chewy ramen.

- Two choices of  flavorful broth (salt or miso).

- Three topping combinations:  basic (excellent chashu, soft boiled egg, and veg), Sapporo  (basic plus butter and corn),  or "American"  (basic with three times more chashu and/or nori).  

- Like it spicy?  Add a Thai garlic chili paste.

- Sides?  OK fried rice, OK chashu bits on rice, OK curry on rice, Good but oily gyoza. (NO TONKATSU)

Efficient service.  It's Japanese fast food after all.

Pushing the limit for Vegas cheap eats at around $9.00 a bowl but well worth it for the quality and uniqueness.  Try it soon.  It might not be so great when its 110 outside.

Butter. Sugar. Eggs. Flour. (BSEF) That's all you need to bake your basic cupcake.

But what if you're flying from SFO to LAS to visit your peeps, and you not only don't have any B,S,E or F, you have no time? You call The Cupcakery for a quickie delivery of some of the finest cupcakes east of the Cali border!

While cupcake delivery is a big, pricey splurge (almost $70 for a dozen... half of which is delivery charge), it' well-worth seeing the look of "Ohhh, man that's one good yummy piece of cake" on everyones face as they take a bite of these moist-caked & creamy-topped gems. I was impressed!

Plus, cupcakes are a delightful alternative to flowers, don't you think?

For the record, the Red Velvet was really good, and while it's usually my favorite, I really loved the Vanilla, too!  

It's nice to know the greater Vegas area has a place like the Cupcakery handy... especially since it's so close to my peeps!

I'd say the majority of Celine Dion music I've heard in life has been from dentist offices.  Needless to say, they aren't fond memories.  I clearly link "Because You Loved Me" to drilling sounds and a big light in my face.

But you have GOT to be dead inside if you don't feel something when she hits those big notes in tunes like "Power of Love" or "All By Myself" in a live setting. As a case in point, I heard a wife ask her husband what he thought of the show while exiting, and his answer was "eh".  He looked a shade under 139 years old!  Almost dead!

Not to say the show was all roses.  I found her version of "Live and Let Die" to be punchless and uninspiring.  Especially after seeing Axl's version multiple times a few weeks earlier.  

Glad I saw the show but no way in heck would I ever pay for this.  I sat stage left in the rear orchestra and a seat retailed for $175 before tax and service fees.  It's only worth it for big time fans.  Plenty of those were in attendance.  Watching people lose their minds to the "Titanic" song was very, very interesting.

"It's like a jungle sometimes, 
It makes me wonder, 
How I keep from going under..."

hopefully Gallo Blanco doesn't go under anytime soon..this spot has been the home of many failstraunts, you know..the places that just can't hang. i really hope more for wee lil' Gallo Blanco.

the menu is straight forward, not overly complicated with too many items to choose from. really easy to fall in love with the simplicity. the 2.00 tacos are really good. and if i ate fish, i could try to settle the long lasting debate on if PHX really has Culture or not...fated by Fish Tacos

but alas, that question still lingers. i can say tho..that if culture was fated on Pork or Beef tacos then i could confidently say that PHX has mad culture. cause the tacos here are awesome. 2 bucks for 3 bites of a fully loaded soft corn tortilla. totally money well spent.

the corn on the cob is freaking amazing. i don't typically order corn on the cob in restaurants because i don't want to be picking corn out of my teeth while having dinner conversation...but these...these right here..these right here are totally worth it. get all that corn up in your chompers and enjoy.

4 stars for great food, comfortable atmosphere.

i took a star from the bland horchata and semi remote location.

I vividly remember my first bite of their red velvet cupcake 8 years ago at their Beverly Hills location.  I'd never had cupcake like that before or since.  There have been copycats sneaking their way into Las Vegas over the years with mixed results and never living up to Sprinkles for me.  They finally made it and I am psyched!  

Yeah so 6 cupcakes costs $22.50.  I was surprised when the cashier asked me if those were for here or to go but then I saw a guy with 6 of them at a table by himself.  Damn, dude.

We ordered 3 red velvet, a peanut butter chip, lemon meringue and black & white.  Those other 3 were nice and all but it's all about the red velvet.  The cake was perfectly moist and the frosting is like no other.  Funny how they put the takeout box into a resealable plastic bag...like drugs.  I am sure Sprinkles is well aware of their addictive qualities.

Even the line on Sunday at 11pm was about 15 minutes.  Looking forward to giving the cupcake ATM a whirl when the line is an hour plus.

PSYCHO

We were walking through casino from Paris to Bally's when we saw a giant bronze bear that was almost 7 feet tall. We decided to go in and check it out. An older gentleman approached us with a really cool mustache. I inquired how much is the bear. 

He looked at me and said, "4250!" 

I then said to my buddy, "He said 4250!" 

My buddy, Tony M said, "$42.50!" 

The guy then went ballistic!!! He looks at us and says, "I'm raising the price for you to $43,000!" We laughed thinking the guy was being funny with us. 

He then said, "If you don't have $43,000 in your wallet then get out of the store!" He then took his hand and slapped himself as hard as he could into his bald forehead. I realized that this guy must be crazy!

A second salesman came up to us to smooth things over but we were done. We weren't spending our hard earned money on a giant bronze bear. A couple of other customers walked out with us. We all talked about how crazy the sales guy was and wondered does anyone ever buy anything there?

We never made it past the giant bronze bear but I'm sure everything in here is overpriced for the high rollers or recent casino winners. We won't be coming back but we will always remember the day we survived the psycho bronze bear salesman. Welcome to Vegas!

Wear a sweater that's more embarrassing than my dye-job and my behavior?  Okay, count me in!

It was another fun night with Yelp Phoenix!  We showed up later than anticipated but we still had two hours of mingling, sipping hot mulled wine, and nibbling on what looked like a delicious spread [no time to eat when there was people to jabber with!].  Entrance was pet food and/or a pet gift that was donated to the Arizona Animal Welfare League.  Yelp Phoenix knows how to keep it classy by giving from their hearts.  50+ people were in attendance and we were allowed to bring a +1 so we got to sneak in our non-Elite friends to show them how we party!  There was a cookie decorating station, an ornament deco station, the *real* Santa, a hot chocolate bar, a White Elephant gift exchange, and a chance to go ice skating outside.  The venue itself is urban chic and lovely.  The servers were generous and were a delight to strike a conversation with.  My voice is absolutely coarse from all the laughter and chatter and I'll drink my hot tea tomorrow while thinking back to this amazing night fondly.

I'm a bit confused though.  It says we were suppose to be at an Ugly Sweater party but I was clearly at a GORGEOUS sweater party!  Between Brett B.'s eye-gouging snowmen and Susan P.'s twinkly green light bulb earrings, Tom D.'s vomiting Rudolph with a Solo cup on the antler and Linh L.'s jingling Christmas poncho, Melodie C.'s starry vest and Meghan L.'s short-sleeved sweater, I thought I was at a fashion show in Milan!  Where did you all get such stylish sweaters?  Don't get me started on Cheryl B.'s adorable Grinchiness, Kurdy S.'s stripper Barbie sweater, and Kazi H's overflowing cuteness.  ;)  Although I'm not sure if I'd get my bum pinched by Melodie if I were in Milan --- that cheeky ginger!  Also, "I'm Anime Melodie."

Thanks a million to Yelp, Lindsey and her cute baby belly, Santa [I swear I'm on the Nice List... maybe], DJ Sterling for a night of festive tunes, the folks at The Corner for hosting us wackos, and CityScape for tickets to ice skate!  

Happy holidays, everyone!  I hope to see you all in 2015!

[DISCLAIMER: the rating of five stars for Bandaids does not directly correlate with the intentions of the establishment, instead, the volumes of unintentional comedy and unsolicited astonishment that may be had at this specific joint]

Walking into Bandaids was like witnessing the sneak premier of the cinematic masterpiece 'Showgirls' -- and what I mean is, one is piqued with curiosity, wonderment, the promise of mindblowing mockery, and the anticipation of an inevitable Spidey exit.  This is where the comparison to showgirls ends.  Actually, I don't rememer.  Did showgirls feature a stripper in her 3rd trimester?

Whereas the tagline for Showgirls was "Leave your inhibitions at the door", Bandaids follows up with "... and your guns, knives, nerve gases, babies, peg legs, raptor jesuses, gold crown deodorizers, and herpes."  Although I think most in there ignored that last one.

So, upon entrance, you are greeted with a very Judge Dredd-like chain-link protected cashier who takes your Abe Lincoln and motions you over to the bar.  One thing about strip clubs in general, is, you don't really wanna schooch by anyone ... but at Bandaids, they make this awkward dream a reality for everyone!  The walk up to the bar is like cutting to seats 34 and 35 at Giants Stadium.  I felt like Tyler Durden contemplating whether to give the vatos the butt or the crotch as they stare blankly at "the talent".

Whoa boy.  This place has talent like the old Washington Bullets ... but shorter, fatter, and more pregnant.

I gave one of my buddies a dollar to snap into one of the monster's string and she gave him a "whusssuuup" that featured her sweet gold grill.  To appreciate this, you must know that my friend is quite possibly the sweetest guy on the planet, and gave a friendly "Hi!" to her in return before about-facing to our bistro style table where 8 Coors Lights were posting up our jaws.

This was a nice, natural cue for a quick exit, rattled our half-drained beers into the bins and shot out.  We couldn't stomach anymore of anything.

But wait.

On this page you will notice Jason C., and along with the others in our laughter-induced group, came his big mouth.  This was his opportunity to mock the sawed-off, convertible, primer-gray Chevy Blazer parked mere feet from the entrance/exit to Bandaids, and although the details are lost as to the specifics, mentioned something about "check out THIS fucking thing!", which was the perfect timing for one of the busted, ghetto-flab strippers to walk out and proceed to angrily say something like "Fuck you.  That's mine.  What of it?"  In response, and generally because he's a giant puss with scary strippers, said something like, "Oh.  Its nice.  I like it." before shitting himself.

I'm sure the rest of the group howling with laughter really set her mind at peace.  

Anyway.  That's the Bandaids story, and you can have one just like it if you give it a chance.

The Tempe Art Festival is a blast!

We love coming down for the Festival at least once a year.  Usually we hit the Fall event, but this year we came for the Spring one for the first time. We also try to come either very early as it opens, or toward the close around 4:30 pm.  That way we avoid the heat of the day and the crowds.

Mill Avenue is totally blocked off and there is a carnival like atmosphere here. Well, at least more so than usual. LOL They have jugglers and street performers.  Folks drawing pictures and caricature alone the sidewalk and much more as they say.

There are also Arts Festivals in Care Free, Scottsdale and Fountain Hills as well. They're scheduled either before or after this one. But we like this one the most, because it tends to be lager then the others (well maybe not FHs) and it has the added benefits of all the restaurants in and around Mill Avenue. Nice!  

This year we tried the HH at La Bocca Urban Pizzeria. http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-bocca-urban-pizzeria-wine-bar-tempe#hrid:O3ctYrNgJDYoj_k-erYzDQ

Located next to Heart Attack Grill and in front of Toy Shack - a bar in front of a toy store? Why not?

My friend and I came here on a week night so the place was quiet. We were greeted by a sweet gentleman at the door who told us how this place works. You go to the bar and order what you want then, you can sit at the bar or get a table. Our bartender/server was Alexis and she told us about our drink options. You can get beer by the pint, do a flight of 5 beers and popcorn for $10 or the tasting tray with all of their 8 beers for $12. The tasting tray made the most sense to me so my friend and I got 2 trays. Instead of rating each one, I've ranked them 1 being my favorite and 8 as my least favorite.

Sandia:
Watermelon wit. Pilsner, wheat malt and white malt. This was fruity and I would get a pint of this next time. Rank: 1

Session:
Blonde. Pilsner, caramel. This was the tamest out of the group. This blonde did not have the most fun. Rank: 8

El Heffe:
Jalapeno hefeweizen. Pilsner, white wheat, pale malt, cara pils. This was awesome. I love hefeweizen and the kick from jalapeno is ridiculously good. Something you must savor. Rank: 2

Perfect Ten:
American pale ale. 2-row victory honey malt, C60, rye cara pils. Rank: 5

Hoppy Ending:
IPA. Rank 6

Hops Anonymous:
IPA. 2-row cara pils honey malt, caramel malt. Rank: 7

Downtown Brown (DTB):
Brown ale. Chocolate pale 2-row, C60, C120. I normally wouldn't finish chocolate stout/ pale but after this tasting, I have a better appreciation of delicious chocolate beer. Rank: 3

Simply Stout:
Stout. Black barley, caramel malt, honey, pale. Tastes like coffee. Rank: 4

They have 2 flatscreen TV's that are both on ESPN, yay! I'm not a hug beer drinker but I love this place even if they don't serve food. They only have Popped popcorn in cheddar, dill pickle, chocolate and buffalo ranch.

I don't always fancy a beer but when I do, I end up having a conversation about the gym, March Madness, chicken fingers and monster nipples. Which means we stayed there 'til closing.

Cute! 

If you love funky, exotic, expensive chocolate, this place is a good place to check out. They have these fun, funky chocolate bars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LpJvitnw7vU5UW-3KE9kjA?select=AgIkITFbopwNhh8aTyzBVQ you can find also at Whole Foods and some candy shops: Bacon Chocolate being their most famous i think. I've had it before and it's pretty good salty sweet. 
If i didn't have so many sweet places to hit, i would have liked to have had more time (and MONEY) to try their different truffles. A cool stop at the Forum Shops for a unique chocolate fix.

Get the chili dog!

Dillon's is a chain down in Arizona.  BBQ is their specialty.  Kind of like the Famous Dave's of the Southwest.  Have been to the Glendale location in the past.  Solid.  This place brings it to another level.  Situated on Lake Pleasant, just outside of old timers land in NW Phoenix burbs. 

They have a vernicular to get you down to the Lake? How cool is that? I am sure that I will appreciate that in my later ages when I retire down there in my golden years.  Look at the old guy getting busy!:

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dillons-morristown?select=wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqA#wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqA

Anyways, their chili dog is out of this world.  See my picture.  Comes on a hamburger bun with two sliced dogs, topped with cheese and jalapenos and BBQ pulled pork.  Just died and went to heaven.  Gives the Gopher Bar a run for its money. 4.99999!

"'Doctors?' said Ron, looking startled. 'Those Muggle nutters that cut people up?'"  Ron Weasley, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

After a dramatic year of treatment at a different and shitacular place for my Grave's Disease, I ran across Meagan B.'s review and found the amazing Dr. Amiri Harari. I ran away from my old specialist and never looked back... not even to obtain my records [more like they're holding it ransom for some dumb reason and won't fax them over]! 

This guy is a peach. From Day 1, everything went amazing. Even without my medical records, we got my bloodwork done on-site and we did an ultrasound before I even left [something the old doc never even suggested that I do]. I feel completely at ease with him. I get anxiety whenever I go in for anything medical but Dr. Harari makes me feel relaxed. 

Since I was already feeling crappy and frustrated about a year of taking Methimazole and not being able to find the right dosage, Dr. Harari answered all my questions and concerns in regards to radio-iodine. I took a few weeks to think things through. I asked his assistant and even Dr. Harari himself a million questions by phone and never once did he make me feel like I was wasting his time. I felt confident in going through with the radio-iodine treatment under his care. While the desired results aren't kicking in yet, Dr. Harari and I decided that I'll get bloodwork done every month for a few months to see if the hormone count will go down so I can become hypothyroid. I appreciated how thorough we got in regards to my situation and his opinion was really appreciated. Fingers crossed that I don't need a second treatment because I don't think I'd go through it again!

Dr. Harari is a brilliant specialist, knowledgeable, and patient. Like Meagan B., I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes past my appointment time to see him. I have nothing but praises for the guy!

I'm told that E. Carson St. in the South Side of Pittsburgh has one of the highest concentrations of bars per block in the country, and I can definitely believe it.  But while E. Carson St. itself is home to a plethora of sports-, beer-, and dive-bars as well as any combination thereof, which attract locals and tourist alike, the South Side side streets (try saying that 5 times fast...especially if you have the slightest of lisps - like me :) ) contain more than their share of hidden gems.

One such bar is Jekyl & Hyde.  From the decor to the beer selection, this establishment could not be more faithful to its terrifically terrifying theme.

The exterior is that of a haunted castle, complete with a [presumably] empty suit of armor guarding the front gate/door.  Once inside, you're assaulted by skeletal remains, ghoulish rubber heads, and spiderwebs on all sides.  But in a good way (especially if you're an avid Horror movie fan).

A chalkboard lists upcoming events such as karaoke nights, live music (some of which I was fortunate enough to witness and was extremely impressed by), and free pool night.  The bar and tables are lined with flyers listing appropriately named specialty mixed drinks.  They also have an excellent beer selection, due largely to microbrewers' penchants for scary names for beers and J&H's proclivity to stock such beers.

The night that I came (largely due to my Welsh bladder and the need to use their restroom) their bartender was attentive, fun, and easygoing. The music, both live and from the jukebox, was entertaining, but what really set this bar apart from any bar I've been to -  was its faithful following of its frightful theme. 

Staring around me at the assortment of people around me, my lungs slightly sore from belting out to Rock Band, my eyes itching from my brother's cigarette smoke, and my hands cold from my bottomless mug of water (which the bartender was on point at continuing to refill) - I couldn't help but sigh in perfect contentment.

A nice 
place 
to go 
somewhere 
else 

Charlotte- Douglas is one of my very favorite airports and a very pleasant place to stop over for a while between flights on the way to somewhere else. 

It's not only clean but sparkling and squeaky clean. Things actually shine and it looks like you could literally eat off the floor. Pretty amazing with all those people thumping, thomping and thudging though it. 

The inside of the the airport is actually fun to explore and walk around, with line of trees, some very cool rocking chairs and little airplanes hanging overhead. Lots of corners to hang out in and plenty of little restaurants and shops scattered about. Even a people mover and escalators to play on although the things move too slowly to really have fun on. 

Sure it's an airport and everyone is in a hurry, some people are grumpy and the typical airport chaos does happen, but overall the folks I have meet here were are friendly and very hospitable. A nice contrast to the abrupt hostility sometimes found in employees of other airports. I'm always happy to see that my flight has a stop over in Charlotte- Douglas because I know I can have fun and will have no trouble killing a few hours here while waiting for another flight. Maybe someday I'll actually get out of the airport and see the city.

This is the kind of place where you wait 2 hours to get in and then enter to an empty dance floor where a 40 year-old Guido is grinding on his 17 year-old daughter/girlfriend to R. Kelly's "Feeling on yo' Booty".  They were lost in the magic of R. Kelly's sweet, sexy sounds and I was lost in the magic of their bizarre, anti-rhythmic grinds.  Oh also, the dude was sporting an obvious boner.  That was his song, for real, no doubt.

What I'm really trying to say here is, it's totally worth the wait.

You can get free passes most nights by either being a non-repulsive girl or hanging out at the exit to "Le Reve".  At the end of the show, tramped out "reps" from the club hand them out to people as they leave.  Table service is pretty much mandatory but you can just sit down at the end of an empty booth and easily freeload.  What else?  Oh. TERRIBLE djs.  I'm talking I heard a dance mix of the Beach Boys, "Kokomo".  You know the one Uncle Jesse played the drums on?  I know you know what I'm talking about.  Don't front.  There is only one thing worse than the original Kokomo and that is Star Jones' naked.  The dance mix is a close second worst.

Come on, it's chocolate. Everybody loves chocolate. Errrrrrbody. 

So, why no love for Ethel M Chocolate Factory? On the drive there, you're excited like a little Violet Beauregarde and the suspense is terrible... you hope it'll last. It doesn't ... cause this chocolate factory is hardly worth the drive nor the most wonderful place in the whole world! 

It's a short self-paced walk through a hallway with a view of a factory without any oompa loompas or rivers of chocolate. It's some people running machines. We went in the afternoon and there was one person cleaning a machine. The "tour" is guiding you to a gift store with overpriced yet average chocolates. 

If my local supermarket or Costco sells Hersheys, Ghiradelli, Lindt, Cadbury, Ferrero Rocher, Guylian, Godiva, or even generic chocolate then do I really need to go here?

The small Cactus Garden is cool for a couple minutes. Of course, you just drove past a lot of cacti to see it. Of all the sites and attractions in and around Las Vegas, is this really how you want to spend your time? If so, pack up the Wagon Queen Family Truckster and head over.

The most impressive thing about the Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden are the tour buses and cars in the parking lot. They prove that everybody loves chocolate. Ethel doesn't need to be like Willy Wonka and promise a free lifetime supply ... because a small free sample seems to be doing a sweet job.

ALERT!  ALERT!  5 STAR BURGER JOINT! GREAT PRICES! FRIENDLY SERVICE!

AM I SHOUTING?!  

Oh, sorry. I tend to hit "caps lock" when I have headphones on.

I had lunch here with my wonderful wife, my youngest daughter and my friend Donald S (not to be confused with Don S...it has happened).

Let me just say I was impressed with my burger and fries.  Cheesy fries.  With bacon. Tender and juicy burger.  Done just right.

Donald's Italian beef sandwich looked so good I'll be having that the next time I go to Lobby's, which will be soon.  Maybe dinner today.

We did chat with the owner, Lobby.  Nice guy, great local business.  Go here.

Yet another really good burger option for the Chandler/101 area!

Over the last few months we've gotten a Smash Burger and now a Burger21 last week. If UR into red meat, how can you go wrong?

I came here to grab something for a late night at the office and Burger21 hit the roof of my flavortown mouth. Sorry Fieri!  LOL

I kept it simple. The cardiac arrest Blue Cheese and Bacon burger for only $7.95 and a Chocolate Malt ($4.95) to wash it down. Both were good. 

Expect to pay $12 or so, if you order a soft drink. Don't  those iced cold beers looked good? There's a real high probably I'll be back with some co-workers real soon.

Place is bomb dot com
Must visit when in Phoenix
In my top five joints 

Long before Yelp or the Travel Channel, my go to source for finding the best places to check out when travelling was a book called "Eat Your Way Across the USA."  I think this was only one of two places in Arizona that the book featured.  Went to Richardson's for the first time in probably the late 90's or early 2000's and have been hooked ever since.  It is among my absolute most favorite restaurants.

A couple years back, the original location was destroyed by fire.  This was my first time in the new location which is right around the corner from the original spot.  The interior looks almost exactly like the old location.  They now have mandatory valet, though, which I am not crazy about.

In the past, I have gotten the huevos rancheros and the enchiladas.  Best I have ever had for both.  Today, I got the Trio which was Swordfish, Salmon and Mahi Mahi.  Came on a tortilla with asparagus and carrots.  Outstanding!  They have five dollar mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys during brunch hours.  Had one mimosa and one bellini.

I wish I had just come to Richardson's straight from the airport when I arrived last Tuesday.  It is that freaking good!

Fukuburger, Fuku so good!

Located inside FAME at the LINQ, Fukuburger offers innovative Asian-inspired burgers, fries and loco moco for those looking to tantalize the palate.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#k0iG_a95OyoEJpJz9Fumsg

When I saw the Tamago burger ($7.99), I knew I had to have it.  I'm an egg slut from way back.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#gr4jTA0IVQkD2Pw7J-Qd9w
Fuku-patty with furikake & teriyaki, finished with crispy onion rings & fried egg.  The first bite was like a rainbow shining down on me. Like Willy Wonka farted candy into the air.  Runny egg oozing over the delicious patty, the sweetness of the teriyaki married together with the crunch of the onion rings.  A fairly sized burger, I felt the pricepoint was a decent value, considering it is Vegas.  I relished each delicious bite.

Service was okay.  It took a while for my burger to be cooked, but I know it's made fresh to order so I can't complain.  There is bar seating directly in front, with tables insided & outside FAME.

Free jelly candy!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fukuburger-las-vegas?select=Ecg4xdQxfeIFIsxmF6GQTA#DNzhAcLMgJFh-kOR8wLL_w

Fukuburger, I'm a big fan!  The Tamago burger was the real deal & one of the highlights, of many, from my trip to Vegas.  I hope you come back to SoCal so I can satisfy my cravings for your Asian-inspired delectables again!

Highly recommend!

When you're far from home, the minute you see a familiar face out in that huge sea of people, you instantly smile. That's how I feel everytime I see the Hawaiian Air Las Vegas ohana... They have that island style spirit that our Hawaii is so famous for. You can tell that they miss home too, in the islands and for them, like us, it's nice to see familiar faces. Hawaiian Airlines has always been my go to carrier when traveling to the west coast and Vegas. They've since moved operations from the old International terminal and now operate out of the new Terminal 3, D concourse. Access by a high speed tram is so easy. The new digs also offer us travelers access to new shops, concessions and yes, slot machines! But getting back to our Hawaiian ohana, it helps to have friendly staff with the Aloha spirit since a lot of times we as travelers need assistance at the gates, etc. I have never felt guilty of like I was bothering any of them whenever I had a question or concern about something. Traveling can be intimidating for some, confusing to others and just downright unpleasant. It sure helps when you have a friendly face to talk to at the beginning of a long journey home and a smile. That alone will cure your anxieties! Keep up the good work Hawaiian!

Oh, and btw, be sure to download the Hawaiian Air app if you have a smartphone, it's so convenient and easy to use. Check in, change seats, upgrade, do it all from the app! You'll never be scrambling to find a computer anymore!

THE BEST CIRQUE SHOW YET! 

I have seen Mystere, O, Ka, and Zumanity. This, my friends, outshines them all! 
From the moment you enter the beautiful theater, you can tell a lot of thought and detail went into the design of it.

If I were any of MJ's family and saw this show, I would literally be crying from beginning to end! I know somewhere, Michael himself is applauding this show for it has been done in great fashion. Doesnt matter if you are an MJ fan or not, one thing is for sure, after this show, you will have a whole new respect for the legendary entertainer.

As much as I dont wanna give away the whole show, let me give you some tidbits for describing it just doesnt do it justice! From the beginning of the show, every song they performed reflected the style and grace of MJ himself. One example was when "Smoothe Criminal" was performed, just like in the video, they did "The Lean". These guys did not try to change anything different related to the song or music video which is how it should be done. 

Mixed in between you have Cirque's signature acrobatics on trampolines and dance moves. The costumes they wear are all very intricate and detail oriented. Bravo to those costume designers and make up artists that bust their butt to make these guys look good. 

As for the lighting and sound, let me tell you, im sure they took great lengths to make sure the lighting is synchronized with the sounds. As for the sound and music, here's a little secret, they have installed 2 speakers custom built into your seats! As you are watching the show, while songs are being performed, it seems like the back up singers are literally right behind you singing! With this speaker set up, the sound is truly surround sound.

The other thing that I will reveal to you is towards the end of the show, they have a holographic image of MJ performing "Man in the Mirror" along with the Cirque performers. That portion of the show gave me the chills for it seemed like MJ himself was actually there.

So in closing, this is a show I will definitely see again! Forget any other MJ tribute show you have ever seen, this is the ultimate homage to the King of Pop.

If I could give Green Acre Dog Boarding no stars...I would.  Stay away from this dog boarding facility.  It appears that Yelp has been removing ALL of the negative reviews that this place has had, and I this facility is STILL taking in animals despite what happened two weeks ago (and Yelp saying they are closed).  Four of my five dogs died while under the care of this boarding facility.  I was "promised" that no more than ten dogs would be cared for at a time.  When we dropped our dogs off, there was only two "larger" dogs and about four small dogs at their house.  My dogs ran around the yard, and seemed to be OK.  We were going out of town for two funerals, and our five dogs (English Bulldog puppy, Manchester Terrier, Pit Bull, Great Dane, and rescue dog) were to stay at their facility for about ten days.  I received a call very late at night that four of our dogs had ran away and died from heat exhaustion (one of which being a six month old puppy and one being a 12 year old blind/deaf dog).  I later found out that my four "furry children" were only four of the twenty-some dogs that died under their care, and i was lied to...they did not run away; they were neglected.  I had NO CLUE the owners were going to be out of town, or I would have had ANYONE I could think of go pick them up.  On top of this tragedy, not once have we received any type of apology for our loss from the owners.  They met my family upon drop off, and knew we had two small children we would have to explain this to...no remorse...no apology.  Please don't take any animal here.  They shouldn't be allowed to care for animals.

I love the juxtaposition of Modern Steak. A straight forward, steak house type menu in an Elton John over the top decorated space. My goal, one day, is to swing from chandelier to chandelier while chowing on my Kobe burger. 

Our service was swift, friendly and well...practically perfect. The soft sour cream and chive butter with the foccaccia style bread is a total knockout. I was smearing it on my lips like Carmex. We started with the lobster chowder which was served in these hot metal bowls. Chowder was ok. Not amazing and definitely could have used some seasoning (nutmeg, allspice!?)...lobster was adequate, if not a little chewy. Mac n cheese was also good, but nothing to make me do my Meg Ryan from When Harry Meets Sally impersonation. 

The Kobe Burger? Total home run! Outstanding. Perfectly cooked. Love the homemade 1,000 island, the applewood bacon...all yummy yummy. As were the fries which were served with a side of ketchup. Missing was the trendy aioli that so many other restaurants seems to offer now. 

Modern Steak gets a solid 3.5 stars Love the textures and colors and am looking forward to swinging by again soon.

Well for me I think ima pass ... ohhh chit everyone is going in... I guess I will go inside and try and find entertainment through people watching... It definitely wasn't by choice that I came here... *SMH*

Alrighty then... just as I was afraid of... its M&M swag central... can I have some free samples at least? Ughhh... PLEASE MAKE IT STOP? Do I really need to find colors of M&Ms that do not exist outside of Willy Wonkas factory for sale to the public? 

PRO TIP: AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! 

Wait a minute... maybe im on an acid flashback trip... those colors are grooooooooovieeeeeeeeyyyy... wait a minute how can I be on a flash back when I haven't taken acid ever... ohhh man... what was in that sample...  holy chit giant M&Ms are coming to eat me!!!  Run hurry move it ... ohhhhhhh noooooooo!!! 

PSA: So yeah if you feel compelled to buy things you don't need and won't wear ever again... don't come here!

Well I finally made it out of that pysho room and back to normal swag rooms... t shirts, hats, plush toys... OHHH look rednekz it's a NASCAR reproduction of the M&Ms sponsored ride... go take a picture or see if you can put it in your suitcase... wouldn't it look good up on blocks in front of the trailer with all the dogs shading underneath it?

On that note... yeah this was obviously not my type of fun. Granted its nice looking out the 4th story windows at the ants errrr M&Ms errrr people down below...

If you LOVE TO SHOP, this is pretty much a MUST STOP for you. But if you're like me who would rather gamble and eat in vegas than spend hours in a mall, this place is pretty intimidating. If it wasn't for the goal of finding Vosges chocolates at the most furthest point possible from where we were, i would rather be taking a nap with those men waiting for their women on the benches. The bad thing about this place, is if ur not interested in most of the stores, to get to one end to the other, you pretty much have to go through all the same stores you just passed, to get back if you want to stay out of the sun. I was looking for a secret passageway that would just transport me back to the casino (cuz i can walk miles through a casino if i wanted) but i couldn't find one. And that "show" is a bit creepy- u know what im talking about!

I give 4 stars though for housing Max Brenner Chocolate Heaven. 
Next time, i have to walk through this place, My first stop will be to get my Chocolate cookie from Max Brenner to make the backtracking more bearable and find Payard Patisserie.

The Julian Serrano Tapas Restaurant carries the name of its executive chef, Julian Serrano, who has made a name for himself in Las Vegas as the celebrated chef at Picasso's at the Bellaggio for the past decade. Prior to that, he was the head chef at the world famous Masa's, in San Francisco.

Here in the Aria at City Center, the grandiose, massive and latest project of MGM Hotel Group, it adds a nice modern Euro feel to the ultra modern and art infused City Center complex, and adds a splash of mediterranean hot colors to the understated Japanese-like hotel color motif of the Aria hotel. It's like a saucy Flamenco dance hall in the middle of the hi-rise offices of corporate giants in the Shinegawa section of Tokyo. Or like the Guggenheim's museum in Bilbao, Spain amidst the rustbelt of the surrounding aging industrial factories that once were the heart of that city. 

It was later on a Thursday when we came, and it was fairly unoccupied. Sat at the bar and was professionally waited on with a lot of attention, owing to the sparse crowd. The room is large and very open; there are dozens upon dozens of bar seats, the ideal tapas location, strung along one side of the restaurant. The ambiance is a classy-festive feel and decor, but very pro in service. 

The specials were told, but they were all fairly heavy and hearty, and we were in a lighter mood, it being about 9:00pm. So we opted for 4 light dishes:

-Marinated Olive Medley ($3) about 5 different offerings including pearl onion
-White Ceviche ($10) This was light, with just a touch of onions and tomatoes, served with a wafer and garnished with cilantro and radicchio
- Escalivada ($8) - were roasted bell peppers and mushrooms in olive oil with a baguette toast slice
- Avocado Cannelloni ($10) this was a light cannelloni wrapped not in noodle, but thin avocado slices topped with chopped nuts, and sided with a dollop of guacamole topped with watercress and a side splash of aioli

With a Gin and Tonic, the bill was $43.24 before tip, and satisfaction came with the refreshing flavors with the creative and traditional dishes from Julian Serrano at Aria.

I'm going to say that these sandwiches were the best in Las Vegas for two reasons:

1) It's one of the only sandwich places among the string of high end buffets and sit-down restaurants

2) My veins were coursing with tons of alcohol courtesy of Fat Tuesday/PURE the night before and eating meaty, carb-filled sandwiches just always tastes better under the influence. 

There was a lot to be happy about at this place, drunken bias aside:
+ Large variety of sandwiches and salads
+ Only 6 bucks, which is dirt cheap for Vegas!
+ I had the Cannonballs and it tasted really good
+ Plenty of seating with clean tables
+ They're open for most of the day and night

This place will fuel you with enough carby-goodness to get you through another day of experiencing Sin City. You should definitely consider making a pit stop here if you're around!

If you're visiting you should know the inmates booking number and the only things you can bring with you are a key and an ID.  Also, visiting is over a black and white monitor and phone, no more in person visits.

The ideal candidate for a job with the jail is highly insecure.  The MSCO remedies this insecurity by giving them a badge on their uniform and control over a small population of people who have already been stripped of any rights or privileges- basically powerless.  When you give sad people like that any kind of power, they automatically abuse it because they don't get any respect in their pathetic real lives.

Unfortunately, when you visit someone in jail, you have to interact with these mental midgets.  I've been here to visit someone and they didn't know if they could accept a passport as acceptable identification.  A group of them had to huddle together and weigh in on it before they decided a government issued identification was acceptable.  Another time I came, they said they couldn't let me in because they couldn't find me in their "system" which I thought was a good thing.

Most recently though, the Chaplin made a special arrangement for me to see my brother in person when our father passed away.  I didn't ask, he offered.  On my way to the jail I prepared myself for some type of hullabaloo with the dum dums running the visitors station.  Sure enough, as soon as I told them the Chaplin sent me they informed me that the Chaplin doesn't run the Maricopa county sheriffs office.  I reminded him that I never suggested anything as ridiculous as the Chaplin running the sheriffs office but merely that he called me and told me to come see my brother.  After about 20 minutes of talking as slow as possible to 5 different detention officers, I gave up and walked out. It's like they all share one brain and the brain calls in sick all the time.

Es schmeckt sehr lecker!

That's German!

I have been to Haus Murphy's to drink a few times in the past and was quite pleased by the beer selection as well as the size. I can get beer in a stein the size of my head? Surely you jest. I have a rather large melon. It is true though. The effer is huge and tasty.

I finally got to eat here with my favorite collection of Brite girls. The whole place feels rather authentic though I have never been to  Germany so what do I know? Everything I know about Germany I learned from Polka and online pornography (I think they love the Hoff).

 Community tables were not uncomfortable as they can be other places. They were quite cozy and enjoyable in fact.

The food while unpronounceable was very delicious. In fact I have been told that my opening line means "It's delicious" however as previously stated I know nothing of German so it could very well mean *insert funnt profane thing here*

Sauerkraut has become one of my favorite things in the world  and It does not disappoint here. The sausages were delicious and the beer made it all just a happy dining sort of day.

Also how can you go wrong with two old men in lederhosen playing the oompah oompah on a tuba and an accordion. These guys are rock stars. You learn to play these instruments solely to get chicks.

Srsly...I know you uppity east sider kids like to stear clear of the avenues except to take in some hipster-slumming it culture, but downtown Glendale has so much to offer. Haus Murphy's is amazing and it is nestled amongst little antique shops and whatnot with brick and lace and charm. Give it a shot.

A good British steak house in the Paris?  Why not.

Love him or hate him, Gordon Ramsay is a multi Michelin stared chef.  Trying his London restaurants dispelled the myth for me that British food is bland and flavorless.  That said, at Gordon Ramsay Steak, the British signature dishes are the standouts.  As a steakhouse, it falls in the middle of the pack in price and quality behind Cut, StripSteak, and CraftSteak.

Two types of beef, limited cuts (epically if you are not sharing your steak).  28 day dry aged, prime beef is excellent.  Well trimmed.  Good marbling.  Beefy with the waft of umame.  The American kobe is feminine; tender, mild, almost sweet.  They claim the beef rates a BMS 10+ (Japanese A5), could be but it's nowhere near as flavorful as Australian or Japanese wagyu.

The signature dishes are outstanding.  Flavors are bold.  The Beef Wellington with a syrupy, red wine demi packs a flavor punch.  A classic.  The "Fisherman's Grill" is also exceptional.  Perfectly cooked lobster, mussels, scallops served with a silky curry sauce.  Oh yeah!.  

Sides meant to be shared.  The mushroom tart, gratineed spinach and blue cheese mac and cheese are good eats and make the perfect match to the dry aged beef by heightening the umame aftertaste.  Unfortunately their flavors overpower the kobe cuts.

Service is friendly and very efficient.

Very good international wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.

This is the most welcoming and diverse religious group I've found in Las Vegas.  I use the term "religious" loosely because many, including myself would argue that Buddhism is more of a philosophy for life and well being.  Much of Buddhism does not fall under the general "religion" rules.  No prosthelytizing, no supernatural beliefs or dogma and no belief in a "heaven and hell" or all-knowing higher power.

The SGI-USA Buddhist Center focuses on a particular brand of Buddhism known as Soka-Gakkai, which is the most established and followed form of Buddhism in the United States.  I was told that the President of the global organization donated some of his personal money to cover much of the costs of construction because he felt the Las Vegas area was a crucial place to have a presence.

I went to the community center a few months back to check it all out.  Luckily I got to see one of the monthly valley-wide meetings that everyone attends.  You're likely to hear a lot of chanting, perhaps a video from an SGI presidential address in Japan, and lots of people talking about how Buddhism has improved their lives.  What struck me most is the diversity.  You'll find people from all ages, races, and walks of life.  No formal dress code.  Just come as you are.

There are plenty of volunteers who are there to explain SGI Buddhism  to newcomers.  Much of the day-to-day and weekly experiences involve attending smaller meetings with people in your neighborhood, often hosted at a member's home.  I haven't been back much since I'm still exploring other forms of Buddhism.  But those who are interested will find this as an excellent starting point.

An exclusive restaurant in a restaurant serving outstanding teppanyaki.

No knife juggling.  No onion volcano spewing fire.  No shrimp tails flying through the air.  This is about modern Japanese teppanyaki made with the freshest, highest quality, visually stunning ingredients.  No "ugly" produce; a perfectly formed, evenly colored eggplant, baby bok choy with no holes in the leaves, you get the idea.

To start, the spicy octopus is incredible.  Lightly grilled with slivered jalapeno peppers, sweet, spicy, tender.  Borrowing from the menu of barMasa, the otoro with osetra caviar, absolutely phenomenal, the salty, brininess of the caviar enhancing the fatty fish.

Australian wagyu for mains.  Two cuts (fillet or rib eye), both approaching A4 quality.  The fillet is well trimmed, the rib eye, less so,  If you like to savor the fat around the edge of your steak, this cut is for you.  Tender, juicy, cooked to temperature, served with a spicy cilantro verde that brightens and intensifies the sweetness of the beef and a spicy red chili and soy that brings out the savory, beefy flavor.

For sides, it's hard to pass the maitake with truffle butter.  An umame explosion that works well with the beef.

Finally, the wagyu fried rice (a filler) is different and over the top.  Black and red rice are combined to create a nuttier flavor.  Fat from the wagyu adds richness, onions sweetness. 

Service is excellent with two servers assisting a single table.  

The restaurant shares the same outstanding sake list as barMasa.  Vegas resort pricing.

While not up to the standards of Michelin rated teppanyaki restaurants of Tokyo, Tetsu delivers a solid, authentic experience at a far more reasonable price.

Let me tell you...I'm very (VERY!) picky about my car, who works on it, and how it looks at all times. I was raised to believe that your vehicle (and it's cleanliness) is a sign of your personality and outward expression of your life in general.  Mine, it must be perfect, end of story.

I had my Audi in the shop to repair my front bumper, fender, headlight and foglight after an accident.  I just got my car back and it is perfect; that's the only way to describe it.  The paint matches perfectly.  The parts fit back perfectly.  The factory tolerances in the seams are perfect; yes I checked.  The car was returned clean inside and out.  The job was completed exactly when they said it would be; no BS excuses or monkeying around.  Car. Fixed. Perfect. On. Time.

These guys are pros, plain and simple.  One thing I require, and they deliver, is frequent updates on the status of my vehicle...I won't sleep well otherwise.  Every other day I received an email from Don giving me the scoop and where they were at in the process.  Love it!

I don't know how these guys compare on price to other shops in town and I really don't care.  This place provides high quality labor and it's worth the cost.  Check out the back of the shop...I challenge you to find a cleaner environment.  This is my, and should be your, go-to body shop.

REVIEW #400.

Vegas' penultimate restaurant.  

Hailing from Michelin three star pedigree, Restaurant Guy Savoy Paris, earning two on it's own before the Guide abandoned the city, is an experience to savor.  Dishes are innovative but prepared in a classic style (no molecular gastronomy or modernist cuisine) showing classic French refinement and restraint.  The progression of courses near perfect with the memory of a flavor from the previous dish enhancing or contrasting playfully with the next.  Beautiful plating with every ingredient contributing to the dish.  The ambiance, contemporary elegant.  The service, flawless but not stuffy.  A true Michelin star experience.

Tip:  Opt for a multi course menu. 

The Innovation - Inspiration Menu ($348) is incredible.  Multiple amuses, ten innovative courses, and multiple desserts in a near perfect progression.  It features many of the signature dishes of the Paris restaurant including the incredible artichoke and black truffle soup.  Velvety smooth, rich from a touch of cream, brooding sweet vegetal flavor of artichokes perfumed by the unmistakable scent of shaved black truffle accented by shaved, aged parmesan.  A mushroom brioche spread with black truffle butter accompanies the soup.  Sensory overload.  Something more innovative?  Caviar with frozen celery root mousse.   A bite, the caviar flavor shines then a bite of the mousse, a hint of vegetal flavor then as the mousse thaws, an explosion of celery flavor that cleans the palette for the next bite.  Think drinking a frozen vodka shot.

Dishes and menus are seasonal.  Be on the lookout for the "prestige" menus.  The current black truffle prestige ($420), outstanding.  A truffle prepared in many variations that it never gets boring.  From being the featured ingredient of an acidic winter marche salad to a background note in a duck consomm, sublime.

Massive wine list with emphasis on France.  Very good vintage depth.  Very high Vegas resort pricing.  A cognac lounge features some of the rarest pours to be found including the 140 year aged Hardy Perfection and the ultra limited edition, Hennessy Ellipse.

Only pet peeve, the restaurant should prohibit the use of mobiles and the taking of photos.  There is nothing more irritating than flashes going off in the dining room as guest take photos of their plate.

A true foodie or balling out of control?  This place is for you.  Then again, if you consider a multi course menu in the Paris restaurant cost between 360 - 490 and the airfare another $6,500 ($1,000 supplement for Hawaii yeeps), you're getting 95 percent off.  What a bargain!!!

"Do you know on this one block you can buy croissants in five different places? There's one store called Bonjour Croissant. It makes me want to go to Paris and open up a store called Hello Toast."    Fran Lebowitz

Woke up this morning to find some delicious croissants on the table and a mug of french-pressed Kona coffee all thanks to Mr. W.  This is how every morning should start off.  Being that it was a gorgeous Sunday morning, I sat down on the couch, dragged a throw blanket over my shoulders, ripped a croissant in half, and chewed on the most flaky and buttery croissant ever.  It was light, airy, and delicious.  I was lucky enough to grab a peanut butter filled one and had ended up splitting it with Mr. W.  Also to be tasted was a Bavarian cream filled croissant.

P.croissants has been Mr. W.'s favorite place for croissants growing up, seeing that his childhood home is down the street.  I'm glad he's decided to share this treat spot with me.  I would love to come back and try some of their sandwiches!

Crab Corner brought me back to my childhood with their Maryland blue crabs. I cried tears of joy when I tasted them for the first time. I had searched high and low for crabs that were seasoned just like I remembered them from back in the day and I hadn't found exactly what I was looking for until I found Crab Corner. This is easily one of my favorite places in Vegas. I just wish it was closer to where I live! 

The guys that own the place are as awesome as their food is. They're very friendly and are helpful with whatever you need. Good service, good times. Bring a bunch of friends and have at it. Crab Corner has a casual atmosphere that is perfect to drink a few brewskies and get down and dirty with some crabs. Bibs and a hearty appetite recommended!

This review is dedicated to my late grandfather, whom I acquired some of my writing genes from. He passed away before the new year. I used to eat Maryland blue crabs by the swimming pool at his house in the summertime. I will miss him.

Posting so other yelpers know how this place works and have a good time.

1. Come by car.  Fees are added for the taxi and/or limo drivers who bring guest to the Rhino.

2.  Come with locals.  Nevada residents are free.  No local ID, you pay what they want to charge you. Locals might be able to get you in.

3.  Don't flash a roll.  You will get picked up right away by a hostess.  Better to look first and make your choice.

4.   You don't get to see unless you pay.  $20 is the rate for the dance.  Don't get fooled.  

5.  If you reject a hostess, she gets annoyed quick.  IRRITATING.

6.  VIP back room fee is a minimum of $100.  That's all you should expect to pay.  The girls can charge you whatever they like so keep that in mind.  Negotiate first.  You don't want to get in it with a bouncer.

REMEMBER, THE GIRLS DO NOT DO ANYTHING THAT YOU COULDN'T ALREADY DO TO YOURSELF.

Follow these tips and you will have a good time.  Oh yeah, the girls are HOT!

Lone Mountain looks small but it's bizarrely difficult to reach the top and get down without falling. Congratulations to DANIEL S. for being the 1st man on Yelp to conquer this mountain.

Every night, a rescue helicopter circles the top of the mountain with a light to see if there are any hikers who have become stranded.  This is a dangerous hike and many people get injured. When I reached the summit, I could not believe there were actually memorials  set up for people who didn't make it to the top. I had an interesting conversation with a lady I met on the summit, she told me a story about how a lot of people had fallen off the steep ledges because of the loose rocks that slide the moment  you step on them. She also told me that people have attempted to drive their dirt bikes up the trail and have fallen to their deaths. To make things worse, when you get to the last 500 feet, the rocks are razor sharp. I am not even exaggerating, my shoes were completely shredded after the hike. I can't imagine tripping and falling onto these razor blade rocks. 

There is an "easy" trail they set up to get to the summit, but it's not technically easy. On the other side of the mountain, they have a much more difficult route that requires you to actually use your hands to climb. 

About 30% up the mountain you will find a park bench. I'm not sure who put this here. The bench is badly vandalized by pot heads and there are usually tons of empty beer cans, bottles, and smoked blunts surrounding the area. 

Once you get to the very top of the mountain, you won't have much space to stand so you gotta be careful. It's a great view, to the right you can see the Red Rock and Summerlin areas. Directly below you, you can see Majestic Park and the North West territory. To the left, you can see Providence, Centennial, and Aliante. You can even see all the way to Sunrise Mountain. And on a really nice day you can see to that area where Railroad Pass is.

During my hike, I witnessed countless grown men give up at the half way point. But oddly, a group of 9 year old girls easily  made it to the top and they weren't even breathing hard.

Compendium is a new show at Planet Hollywood in which musicians pay tribute to legendary bands featuring live music, multimedia and acting during breaks in sets/costume changes. 

The first band they're paying tribute to is none other than KISS so when I heard that I was all about it. One of my friends who came to town is a huge KISS fan. I arranged to take him along with some other friends to see the show. My entire party had a rockin' good time!

The Sin City Theater at Planet Hollywood is on the smaller side but it makes for a more intimate show. Seating was comfortable and waitresses bring drinks directly to your table. As far as I could tell, there wasn't a bad seat in the house.

Some of the classics played were "Calling Dr. Love", "I Was Made for Lovin' You", "New York Groove", "Lick It Up", "Shout It Out Loud" and "Rock and Roll All Nite".

Luis Reyes does an amazing job as Gene Simmons! That tongue... geez! I was the lucky recipient of a guitar pick from him when he threw it to me. Thanks Luis!

At the end of the show, the band stayed out on the red carpet to take photos with fans which I thought was a really nice touch. The entire band was very personable and friendly.

You can see the Sin City KISS show now through June 30th. Tickets are available on Ticketmaster here:

http://www.ticketmaster.com/Compendium-tickets/artist/1996989

The next band featured will be U2 starting July 3rd.

The Taliesin West is Frank Lloyd Wright's "Winter Camping Home" 

A MUST DO if you're visiting Arizona! A great way to admire and pay homage to one of America's Famous Architects - Frank Lloyd Wright (FLW)

[history]
Frank Lloyd Wright's original Taliesin home is in Wisconsin. After one of his major projects, he had money to purchase land in Scottsdale, Arizona for only $12.50/acre back in the 1930's. Frank wanted to pass on his legacy on and so he had apprentices and mentored them in Arizona and Wisconsin. Frank had drafted the architecture for his new home, but the apprentices had built/constructed the home itself. Frank named this place Taliesin West since it was located West of his Taliesin home in Wisconsin.

[tours]
INSIGHTS TOUR - 90 minutes; $32 adults (student and senior citizen discounts apply)
The insights tour is one of the signature tours at Taliesin West, which gives you a glimpse of the rooms that were built. Your fees go straight to the FLW Foundation - a non-profit organization dedicated to "conserve the priceless tangible and intangible assets that are the legacy of FLW. 

NOTE - there are several other tours available (i.e. night tours, group tours, etc) so you may want to check their website for the other packages that they offer. You can also rent out the area if you want to book weddings, host parties, conduct seminars, etc. (requires rezzies).

[limitations]
FYI - all models, drawings, designs and works by FLW and the Taliesin Architects are exclusive property of the FLW Foundation and so therefore CANNOT be photographed, reproduced, copied, duplicated without written consent. 

You may take photos throughout the tour, but your tour guide will instruct you to when that time is allowed. They are just preserving and protecting the legacy of FLW and I totally understand!  Our tour guide was very knowledgable and was able to answer questions throughout the tour. He had been a tour guide for the last 13 years! Many of the employees here know their stuff about FLW! Each tour would be different as you would get a different spin from each tour guide, but nonetheless, you'd have a wonderful experience. 

FYI -
*No smoking on tour
*Bathrooms located in the gift shop
*Parking is free
*Located minutes away from Downtown Scottsdale
*Beautiful view of the city and sky
*75th Anniversary of Taliesin West (2012)
*Correct address: 12345 N Taliesin Drive, Scottsdale, AZ 85258

If you love architecture or would like to admire one of FLW's pieces, definitely stop by Taliesin West! Highly recommended whether if you are a tourist or not!

Okay, I might have been a tad harsh after several bad experiences two years ago!  

One of their waitresses moved back to Europe, and things kind of went down hill for a while. We have been back to this location several times and the service has been improving.  Today is a good example.  I came by for a Baker's Dozen around noon time. It was a madhouse! Folks standing everywhere waiting to be seated. 

But, I was in and out within ten minutes or so.  David was directing traffic from behind the counter and doing a very good job.  BTW, it was only $9.42 for those thirteen bagels/ bialys!  So, so much better than the ones at Fry's and almost as good as New York Bagels 'N Bialys.

The major drawback continues to be their slower period around dinner time.  Like I said it's getting better. I guess if you've been on your feet for 5/6 hours and things slow down; you look for an opportunity to catch your breath.  

The food is very good, lets say Four Stars.  Service is Three Stars-ish.  And that New York kvetching?  Priceless!

Enjoy!

Ladiessssssss....hold tight to those purses!

If you're a woman standing on the dance floor with a purse, you're a target. There's some kind of crime ring happening that can ruin an entire Vegas trip if they get their hands on too many personal items. They appear to be pick pocketing cell phones and if they can wiggle a wallet out while they're at it, game on. A handful of girls in our group noticed their cell phones were missing about an hour into the night and once those of us that still had ours started flashing the ground to see if we could find them, ladies dancing around us jumped in announcing that their cell phones had been swiped, too.

Sadly Hakkasan's security guys couldn't do anything about it, because their job is to keep the fire lanes clear and keep bottle service VIPs away from the commoners. It's a shame because if they had just put a few more security guards on the dance floor after the many complaints we sent their way about the situation, some people could have been safe from the thievery.

Losing your phone or ID on a Vegas weekend is probably one of the worst scenarios you can think of because your whole life is put on hold and you have to jump through hoops (while on vacation) to get everything back in order.

Props to securing kick ass DJs and the unlimited confetti budget, but there's a serious issue taking place under Hakkasan's roof that needs to be addressed. And fast.

Welcome to Disney Land!  A beautiful faade of a Parisian cafe worthy of a single visit.  After that, the spell breaks.  

Quick and dirty:

- Three dining spaces (outdoor overlooking LV Blvd facing the Fountains of Bellagio, indoor sun room, indoor steak house). 

- Three check-in lines (outdoor wait list, indoor wait list, confirmed reservation).

- Franco / American caf menu at reasonable prices.  

- Great selection of French wines by the glass or bottle.  Glass prices are VERY high.

- Friendly, bordering on unprofessional service (faked French accents for some tables, Parisian style silence for others).


The food is below average.  High point;  the baked brie starter.  Served in a hot baking dish, accented with hazel nut oil and honey that perfumes the air.  Unctuous.  Rich.  Just good eats.  Unfortunately, the escargot is the opposite.  Tender morsels of snail dressed with hard parsley stems.  Ack.

Mains fail to deliver. A paltry two ounce, steak sandwich served with an overly reduced, sweet onion au jus.  A croque monsieur made with pressed deli ham.  Very low quality (sub USDA choice), albeit inexpensive steaks.  Frites that accompany almost every dish are terrible.  Some crisp, most soggy, rubbery, and oily.

Worth a single visit to enjoy a bottle of wine and see the fountain show.  After all, the Parisian authenticity is enhanced by the confetti of playboyesque images on cards that litter the sidewalk below and well lit mobile billboards of  scantily clad "Hot Hot Hot Ladies" crossing your view.

Picture it, three Asian dudes and one Midwest white dude who never acquired a taste for "Asian" food.

"I'll order for everyone OK?" says my bud, fluent in Cantonese.  Mutterings of indifference. A few minutes later steaming bowls filled with chewy, thin egg noodles and flavorful broth arrive, a generous portion of well braised beef brisket, soft gelatinous tendons, earth tripe, chewy pig ears, airy fish balls, shrimp filled won tons and flavorful mushrooms weighing everything down.

Chopsticks in hand we all dig in.  My Midwest bud, holding his fork, looking like someone stole Christmas exclaims "why couldn't we eat that", pointing at the table with a plate of roast pork.

The waitress answers for us "You eat first.  Good for you.  I bring after you finish".  

To his credit he made it through the noodles and devoured the Chinese BBQ that followed.  Were talking a succulent roast duck with very little subcutaneous fat, the juicy meat permeated by star anise and bathed in its own juices and pured innards; moist, salty roast pork with a golden, blistered crisp crackling skin, and a deeply flavored char siu, moist, some burnt bits for bitterness, sweet with a delicate fermented aftertaste.

Sure, the roast pork and char siu was a little lean but  this is health conscious 2013.

Very inexpensive noodles and rice plates (roasted meats, duck, chicken over rice with choy sum).  BBQ items sold by the pound, roast duck by the whole or half.

Good eats for sure.

$80 Yoroi Menu:

Grape Sake Cocktail
Jack Mackerel in Sweet Vinegar
Sashimi Course:  Bluefin Tuna (Spain,) Ocean Trout (Scotland,) Jack Mackerel, Young Yellowtail (Japan), 3-year aged Soy
Grilled Course:  Spanish Mackerel with Miso, Kobe Beef with Kumquat, Flying Fish with Salt
Sushi:  Deep Sea Porgy, Yellow Grouper, Cornet, King Yellowtail, Triangle, Sea Urchin over Salmon Roe, Sea Eel, Sweet Omelet
Toro Handroll
Fish Miso Soup
Matcha
Green Tea Cocoa Cake
Strawberry Layer Cake

The main event of the evening, a seat at Gen-san's easily missed Kabuto, finally arrived and true to the rumors the $80 Yoroi Menu would not disappoint; easily the best deal on fresh sushi in the Vegas area and, with a focus on edomae-sushi plus fish arriving 4-7x per week from Japan (depending on demand,) a truly authentic experience in a city where 'authenticity' is generally questionable at best.

All clean lines and zen, blonde woods and flowers, a small slit window at the entrance and a couple of tables the action here is clearly a seat at the sushi bar and placing oneself in the hands of the itamae in order to bear witness to the incredible knife skills as piece after piece of fish arrives perfect and smooth, the rice fragrant and warm, with ample description of province and the occasional anecdote.  Featuring fresh wasabi, house-made aged soy and creamy miso, plus an extensive sake list and dessert program responsible for the best mille crepe I've had to date my only regret in visiting Kabuto is that I did not book an earlier reservation and order the longer menu; a mistake I'll not make in the future.

Dropping my rating from a two star to a one star DISASTER!

I just wrote a review for the Citizens Kitchen & Bar last week.  I mentioned that the waiter George was "AMAZING!"   I retract my statement.  He is unethical and unprofessional.  He automatically included an 18% tip in our bill (see my original review) and not tell us about it (he got a 40% or an $80 tip on a $210 total bill).   We would have been OK with the 18% tip for a party of 8, but just tell us about it so we wouldn't double tip you!

We just checked our credit card statements, and George DOUBLE CHARGED us when we asked him to split our bills.  This means that he charged us 150% for our food and drink bill!  UNETHICAL!  Here's a summary of this horrible restaurant:

1)  We weren't told that Waiter George included an 18% tip on our bill.
2)  We added an additional 20% tip, raising his tip to $85+ on a $210 bill.
3)  We were charged an additional 50% for our food, bringing our total charge to $300+ on a food tab of $168.
4)  To top it off, the food is HORRIBLE here!

AVOID!  Shame on the owners and wait staff of Citizens Kitchen & Bar!  We're working with the credit card companies to resolve this mess!

Before Bacchanal,  Before Wicked Spoon, Before the Buffet at the Bellagio, Before everyone else got on the bandwagon, This buffet started it all
Buffet Stations, each serving a different cuisine. What a great concept. 

I can remember when this was the "It" or should I say the "Must Eat" buffet in Las Vegas. But alas, It's old, the ambiance is not as vibrant, the food quality and presentation has been surpassed by the restaurant I mentioned above and more, but the Carnaval Buffet still has its mojo. 

I've always enjoyed the Chinese station here. Dim sum, BBQ pork, steam buns & pork and preserved egg congee. I always get the same things. Yum!

Pricing is in line with other buffer. 

Tip: look into the 24 hour pricing. The lady at the register told us it is good for all Caesars casino group for a 24 hour period. Buffet feast for 24 hours? my stomach might not be able to handle that.  Lol. 

Everything was good. The only thing is, Las Vegas is into Great things, newer and better buffets. It might not be as good as the glory days, but it holds its own as far as I'm concern.

One of my favorite bars in Vegas. Such an awesome concept with the old school classic board games such as rockem sockem robots, and jenga! Oh yea and the Wii upstairs, so fun!. Love the black and white decor and the upstairs overlooks the bar. Very cool. The prices aren't bad and they serve Illy coffee, my favorite!
Its usually pretty busy on weekends so i would suggest showing up early to grab a table or the upstairs part for the fun games.
Def a fun bar to check out when your in the Green Valley area. Ive never tried the food but it always looks delish.

I love going here for lunch!  I have been there several times because it is close to work and I have to get out of the office!  I love the soups here. Just had the vegetable and the ingredients were so fresh.  The salads are also very good.  I have tried the blueberry wrap and that is one of my favorites.  I have heard from the owner that she will even be delivering to office buildings in the area.  This is the best place to go if you like everything fresh.  Perfect vegetarian spot!

Well it's another weekend and another Sam Fox Concept restaurant to try.  Life is so boring here in the Valley.  LOL

There have been quite a few "premium priced" burger places popping up lately.  So, in many ways Zinburger's only competition in this category has been Hopdoddy. Both are upscale $10 plus burger places, that have interesting choices of tastes, add-ons, buns, etcetera. 

The food at Zinburger is very good. It's served fast and you won't feel like your wallet took a major hit. Our bill came to $33.00 before taxes and gratuities, which is expensive when only compared to the "In 'n Out" and "Habit Burger" of the world. But for us, it's the Zinburger's taste which we feel is unique and worthy of their premium price that makes us want to come back and we will. 

We tried their Kobe Burger ($15.00), Sam Burger ($11.00) and Zucchini fries ($7.00) and blown away the experience. The Sam had applewood smoked bacon, cheese and 1000 island dressing, which all worked well together. But the star was the Kobe, which is served simply with cheddar cheese, mushrooms and mayonnaise.  You have to try it, it's delicious. Really!

Enjoy!

I can't help it that I'm addicted to sweet potatoes. So that's why I have been gravitating toward Boston Market lately. My two sides are always sweet potatoes, or should I say my main course is the sweet potatoes and the chicken is my side. The food is excellent, although sometimes the chicken can get a little scrawny looking.

My only complaint about this place is that I'm constantly approached by employees to either sign up with my email address or being asked how's my meal. Last time I was in there I was asked how's my meal twice by the same guy and then a manager came by and asked the same thing. I get the touchy feely customer service thing. But PLEASE, dial it down a bit.

Venturing out and trying new AYCE spots in town! 

I am really anxious when trying new places, because very rarely does it surprise...in a good way at least.  But Naka does well!

Some highlights :

Great quality nigiri here!  They had very fresh Ahi, Sake, Fresh Sea Scallops and Hamachi.  I was surprised they had Anago on the AYCE menu, and it was pretty fresh.  The Uni was a bit watery in consistency but it still had a smooth flavor/finish.

Fresh Oysters....these were great! Love the ponzu like sauce and hot sauce combination!

Soft Shell Crab appetizer. This was a large crab, cooked well, and surprisingly meaty! Yum :)

Sashimi Salad. Lots of great tasting ahi with a tasty dressing and greens. 

Fried Jalapeno Popper...surprisingly spicy! Loved the spicy mayo concoction on top.

Service was fast and friendly.  I say if you are on this side of town, you should give it a go!

Low expectations. That's what I had when we stopped to have a bite before a movie. Not a big fan of deep dish, we were delighted to see "flat bread" pizzas offered. The sausage pizza, while could have been crunchier, was quite good. Service was great considering our friend was so dehydrated from being overserved the previous evening, he must have had a dozen ice tea refills. 

The ambience at these places kills me. It's like Oregano's married Cracker Barrel! There is crap all over the walls. Hey. Who's dusting this stuff anyway. I did notice quite a bit of dust and grease on the light fixture above our table. 

We attempted to try the pizza place a few doors away, but they were closed. I suggested Hooter's but before I finished saying it, we all squealed in all of our gayness...."Ewww...boobies!". So Uno it was. 

But I couldn't help think of that card game Uno. Damn that's a fun game. And I also couldn't get a guy from high school outta my head. His nickname was Uno. He got it one day in the locker room after gym class. You figure it out. 

I'll go again if I'm ever at the AZ Center. I just might bring my Windex and Endust however.

A plate of fancy desserts, a plate of carved meats & BBQ, while slurping a bowl of beef pho and tonkotsu ramen. Don't. f*ck. up. this. rotation.

Excited to see that Ceasars Palace was finally opening the doors of its highly anticipated $7 million buffet, Vegas buffets are very similar to one another (all equipped with seafood, carving station, fancy dessert station, etc). Generally, new buffets start off very well, so we jumped to try this before it begins to spiral down in quality (all buffets eventually do this).

Bacchanal seems to have adapted a lot of Wicked Spoon ideas like the brilliantly idiotic concept of individually plating items in dishes/pots/pans/mini-deep fryers so that items do not fit on your existing buffet plate 
(Why does fancy plating mean that we have to further frequently pace back and forth for more food?)
But, all in all, the food at Bacchanal is a solid buffet competitor to Wynn, Cosmo, & Bellagio.

The perfect time to go to a Vegas buffet is right before lunch ends (2:30).  
(Props to Justin Y.)
That way:
1. You avoid peak rush hours and the death line wrapped around the corner. 
2. You pay for the lunch price, while dinner items are new and slowly filter in at stations. I.E Crab legs were were not offered for lunch, but appeared later during our meal
3. Going out at night? Luckily for you, you had a late lunch/early dinner so you will feel like less of a whale in that tight dress.


Bacchanal Back-anal jokes aside, this place is recommended

This place saved my booty, I'm not even kidding! My iPhone went for a nice leisurely swim in my pool and I thought it was going to be forever down for the count as a result. I did the "quickly shut it off trick" followed by "placing it in a bag of rice overnight" thingamajig and the next day I turned it on.... and low and behold, hallelujah! It was working but it was a little on the fritz, going haywire and not responding when I'd push keys repeatedly, then it would go into cycles where it was phantomly pushing buttons on its own. Typical stuff that makes you think your phone is dunzo and want to throw the thing away and chalk it up to a very expensive mistake, acting klutzy with electronics in your pool. But thankfully I didn't give up and I found these reviews here on Yelp. I was a little hesitant as someone else who mentioned water damage in their review had mixed results but I figured it was worth a shot. Better than nothing right? 

Well... these people fixed my problem and I'm quite happy because my phone works good as new now. I was hoping to at least be able to get my data off there as a bare minimum and they exceeded my expectations. And as long as I don't find out down the line that this place leaked my nude selfies all over the internet (lol), I'd say I'm stoked with my experience here. Seriously though... Y'all didn't do that to me, did you? LOL!

I like this chain, and this location.  The food options are good, and of course you have those Harkins plastic re-fill cups.  

What I am going to attempt on Yelp, is less a review of the theatre and more of a review of the movie(ies) we just saw. Because in the end, they're interchangeable right?  It's all part of the experience. 

Decent seats, good selection of what is out there currently, an easy line and a good price.  That's what we look for in a movie theatre.  Since we go to movies two or three times a month, why not share our thoughts of the movie we just saw as well?

BTW, stop in at CafePino's afterwards.  You'll be happy you did!
*********************************************************************************
Denzel Washington is incredible in the movie "Flight", which is a slow motion descend into darkness, which is hard to watch or for us to turn away.  His performance is as good as "He Got Game" or "Training Day!"

This is a slow burn, five Yelp thumbs up!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 36/100

Beautiful hotel! Probably the nicest one I had visited this weekend, other than THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. It was a vintage, regal and expensive look to it. I have not stayed here, but I was really impressed by my visit this past weekend and would love to return.

LOCATION:
Excellent. Right in the middle of the strip for easy access all over

EXTERIOR:
Beautiful. Especially the beautiful lake in the front which gives it a little bit of distance from the actual street

INTERIOR:
Like I said earlier - regal, fancy, stunning
Entryway has beautiful glass flowers all over the ceiling

SHOPS:
Not too many. Most were very high end stores such as Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Louis Vuitton, etc. More eye candy, but they definitely match the expensiveness of this hotel!

WHAT TO SEE:
Flowers in the entryway
Window shop in the expensive designer stores
Conservatory & botanical gardens (decorated every season!)
Jean Philippe patisserie - home to the "world's largest chocolate fountain"
The famous water fountains out front! Shows either every 15 or 30 min. depending on day/time

I would love to stay at the Bellagio if I could afford it. I think I was expecting the Paris hotel to look more along the lines of Bellagio. Kinda disappointed over there...BUT Bellagio was simply beautiful!

For being a literal "hole in the wall," they serve up some solid Korean food here. They have all the classics like Yuk Gae Jjang, Sundubu, Mandu Gook, Dolsut Bibimbap Don't forget the BBQ (not table-top) Kalbi, Bulgogi, Doeji Bulgogi. And they even serve boba drinks + Spam Musubis. Who doesn't love Musubis with their kimchi? And don't worry, you'll still get all the side dishes here. It's like any other Korean service; they just have a walk-up window. :)

The owners are so nice! The wife is back in the kitchen and the husband services the guests. They're very friendly and actually used to have a restaurant in the original Koreatown i.e. The Commercial Center. 

By the time Man Na opened at the "Internet Cafe" space, my time at CSN Charleston was up and I'm rarely ever in this area. But Man Na is definitely worth a trip. If you're a CSN student or work around here, this makes an excellent lunch stop. They know you may be short on time, so call ahead and they'll make sure your food is ready for you when you get there.

"Thank you for calling Cox Communications. My name is Melika. How may I assist you today?"
"Hello Melika. I'd like pay the minimum on our cable bill please."
"OK sir. I would be happy to assist you with this today. May I please have your PIN."
"I have no idea what our PIN is. I"m sorry. What other information may I give you."
"The social security number for the primary customer."
"Oh, well that's my partner and I'm not sure what it is. I have our address, phone number, our account number..."
"Yes sir, well I do understand that you have that information, I will not be able to assist you."
"OK Melika. Look honey. I'm trying to GIVE you money. I'm not changing my plan or even making fun of your dumb ass company yet. Just wanna GIVE you money."
"Without your PIN or social security number I cannot tell you the minimum due but I can take a payment."
"Oh. Well now we're getting somewhere. Melika. By the way, we're you named after a coffee maker? Great let's pay $165 like I did last month and see where that gets us."
"Thank you sir for you payment. And, yes, I was named after a coffee maker. Thank you for choosing Cox Communications for all your media and digital needs. Have a nice day."
Two days later. Our cable and internet is turned off. Because she could not tell me my minimum amount and I was short by $4.83. Our services were turned off. And I didn't "choose" Cox. It was forced on me like Catholicism and puberty. Cox? You suck!

So I got asked if I wanted to see the O show or the Fantasy Show. I could tell from their faces that they wanted to see topless girls so I agreed to go to the Fantasy Show because I'm not a prude. 

You know what? I really did enjoy this show. It was tastefully done and not trashy as I thought it would be. These girls were so beautiful and so mesmerizing throughout their performance. I'm not a lesbian but this show has made me become bi-curious? Okay, not really but I have to admit they were sweet eye candy.

The host/singer has an amazing voice and she kept everyone entertained. She had some of the audience participate in singing, which was awesome because some of them sounded like a dying cow. Lol.

I didn't get to see Sean E. Cooper but they had Lisa Sundstedt (from Chelsea Lately and appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno) take his place. She was so friggin' hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing at her jokes. :)

Some of the guys in the audience act like they've never seen naked chicks in their lives. When they see topless girls...they start going crazy by hooting, hollering, and making disgusting comments. Seriously, those perverts need to go to a strip club instead of coming to this show because they're ruining it for the people who sit next/close to them.

Anyways, you guys should definitely go to this show if you're not embarrassed or ashamed of seeing half naked girls. Ladies, you should be a good sport and bring your guys here for some entertainment. ;)

Did you know the north central Phoenix community of Sunnyslope includes the first subdivision built in the Phoenix area and has existed since before Arizona was a state?

Originally settled by poor tuberculants who spent their last dime traveling to a drier climate, Sunnyslope was filled with tents and cottages with porches. In 1911, retired architect W.R. Norton (who had already been living in the area for four years) planned a subdivision and named it "Sunnyslope" inspired by his daughter's remark, "What a pretty sunny slope!" after seeing the morning sun on North Mountain.  

By the 1920s, Sunnyslope had grown into a small yet diverse community of prospectors, homesteaders, writers and musicians, among others. Today, the population tops 51,000 and is still very diverse, representing various gifts, ethnicities and socio-economic groups.

Perhaps the most notable quality about Sunnyslope is the community's strong sense of independence, characteristic of its unique sense of place. Residents tried several times to incorporate, finally relenting in 1959 and allowing the community to be annexed by the City of Phoenix. Still, despite being located in the middle of a large metropolitan area, Sunnyslope maintains a unique, small town atmosphere with an active and engaged resident base.

Besides its cool history, other unique elements of Sunnyslope include:
* One of the few places in Phoenix where in-fill development opportunities exist.
* Diverse housing stock and elevation - from living room windows you can see downtown.
* Lots of outdoor amenities: Murphy's Bridle Path, the canal, North Mountain preserve and more than five city parks.
* 9 public art installations.
* Easy access to downtown Phoenix.
* John C. Lincoln Hospital, the community's largest employer, acts as convener for community meetings and events such as a community policing meeting, the Sunnyslope Fall Festival and the Sunnyslope Art Walk.
* Sunnyslope Village Alliance hosts regular meetings with elected officials representing the community. All are open to the public and there is no cost to attend.
* Sunnyslope Historical Society is housed in what was once the People's Pharmacy building. This building's claim to fame is that is was the first drive-thru window west of the Mississippi.
* Authentic Mexican food representing regions including: Oaxaca, Mexico City and Sonora.
* The best patio in Phoenix (Bomberos Caf & Wine Bar). 
* A free neighborhood circulator where you just wave down a shuttle and it will stop (plus there's a transit station for the city bus). Light rail plans to stretch to 19th Ave. & Dunlap which will be a bonus!

While Sunnyslope did experience a period of decline, a result of older housing stock and poorly maintained rental properties, people who have called this place home have remained vigilant in advocating for their neighborhood and care about their neighbors.  Sunnyslope is experiencing a renaissance and is getting more attention for its best qualities; but, truly, if you ask anyone who lives here they'll probably tell you the very best thing about Sunnyslope is the people!

In the inception of my Yelping I was giving away five star reviews like U of A was giving away TD's to ASU!  I am now learning that four stars is now my high score unless I am totally blown away and is why I am updating my review.  Yin's Chinese Restaurant is a throw back.  Their interior decor is a bit dated but adds to the ambience of the experience.  This little gem is family owned and always prefer it to a corporate spot at all costs.  The most important this about Yin's is the customer service followed but the delicious menu and topped off by the cost!  Big Bang for the buck here.  The valley has changed throughout the times but when I lived in this area in the early 90's it was really nice.  Do not let the area scare you off by giving them a chance.  Support this Mom and Pop's establishment to ensure we don't lose another.

Stayed at the Venetian over the weekend, fell in love with Bouchon bakery (HELLO, carrot cake cookie) next to our rooms, and then continued to hop on over to the 10th floor to taste regular Bouchon's Chicken & Waffles everyone raved about for brunch.

The chicken itself was roasted, not fried, and one of the softest chicken I've had the pleasure to sink my teeth into. The waffles had chopped chives in the waffle batter, with chopped up bacon sprinkled on the top. The waffles were tangier than usual, and it was a pretty decent pairing with the chicken. 
Will I ever fully absorb the concept of how these two things pair? Doubt it. -_- 

The dish comes with sauce chasseur (kind of like a brown gravy/glaze), the waitress suggested that we dip our frites in there. You have to and it's a must, there are bacon bits with that salty braised chicken grease roux. Awesome.

Also took bites of what I wanted more of:
Croque Madam - good but very very heavy
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=Ipb7CRbmMzLwTvoOu9ut9g#XeGUX8Tv7xWupvrcndfDXg
Open-faced Tuna Sandwich - loved that they used capers 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A?select=Ipb7CRbmMzLwTvoOu9ut9g#Lt7QBEre9QHNxsV9t7Gxew

Definitely not a bad place for brunch, I will probably be back to explore other options.

BTW, their macarons are subpar (hitting 2 reviews in 1, hiy-ah!)

3.5 STARS

What makes MGM Grand so GRAND?!?!
Is it because the building and all it's splendor is emerald green?
Is it because the gold gigantic lion out front can be spotted a mile away?
Is it because there is some connection to the Wizard of Oz?
Is it because they hold boxing matches here? 
Is it because they are the head company that pretty much owns a couple other casinos down the Las Vegas Strip?!

I remember staying at the MGM when I was younger and had some fam bam trips to Vegas. The rooms were decent and filled with your typical amenities of a hotel room. I think the rooms are much better in quality compared to Luxor & Excalibur. When I stayed at the MGM, the Skylofts & The Signature (luxury boutique hotel rooms) were not built yet. But nonetheless, a decent stay at the regular rooms. 

RESTAURANTS
[SUPER SWANKY]
* Joel Robuchon (French - 3 Michelin Stars)
* L' atelier de Joel Robuchon (4 Michelin Stars)
* Tom Colicchio's craft steak (For all you carniwhores & Top Chef fans!)  

[SWANKY]
* Diego Mexican Cuisine
* Emeril's New Orleans Fish House
* Fiamma Trattoria & Bar
* Nob Hill Tavern (Michael Mina)
* Pearl (Chinese)
* Sea Blue (Michael Mina; currently renovating and will open 2013)
* Shibuya (Japanese)
* Wolfgang Puck
* MGM Grand Buffet
* 'Wichcraft (Tom Colicchio's Sammie shop; not as swanky as the others)

PARTY ROCKERS & PRE-PARTY HOT SPOTS
* Hakkasan Nightclub(debut 2013)
* Tabu Nightclub
* Wet Republic Ultra Pool
* Centrifuge (crafty cocktails)
* Rouge Bar
* Zuri Bar
* West Wing Bar

ENTERTAINMENT
* Brad Garrett's Comedy Club
* Hollywood Theater
* David Copperfield
* Ka Cirque Du Soleil
* Boxing matches at MGM Grand
* Concerts at MGM Grand Garden Arena
* Conference Center and Ballrooms (on the other side of the casino)

Given this laundry list of items, you can imagine how large this casino would be! It took me a good 30 minutes to get to the conference center as it is located on the opposite side of the casino! The food catered at the conference center was quite upscale and top notch! Consider it 100x better than what the Holiday Inn would serve you in a banquet! I wouldn't mind coming back to the MGM for a conference nor staying at the hotel. It's pretty decent if you're looking for something in the middle of the strip.

Taiwanese ice, Vegas style.

Am I in hell?  It's 110 degrees.  The Prius says 125 outside.  I'm seat belted in and  on the 15 when I realize I'm still wearing a hoody.  AC not cooling s#!%.  Finally, the trailer.  Frost Bites Shavery and relief.  Within minutes cup in hand.  Scoop one, light, fluffy, COLD, ahhhh.  Scoop two, body temperature falling, I'm forgetting I'm still wearing a hoody.  Scoop three; NOOOOO, it's melting!!!

This is good stuff.  Hawaii yeeps, think Frostcity on steroids.  Ribbons of fluffy goodness are shaved  from blocks of highly concentrated. naturally flavored ice.  Light, fluffy, delicious for the first two or three scoops then the texture changes it quickly becomes wet and "mushy", the sweetness becomes cloying.  Stick to the smallest size.  You can always get another.  (went back four times in one visit.  Scoop, scoop, toss, order, scoop, scoop, toss... Things we do for yelp)  

Flavors are strong and delish while the ice stays ice.  Vanilla (cloying sweetness), mango (floral, intense, cloying finish), green tea (bitter sweet tea flavor, best once melted), black sesame (nice sesame aroma, different, cloying finish).

Toppings are akin to a froyo bar, ie big chunks of fruits, nuts, crackers, candy, and cookies.  They detract and overpower the ice.  Too much crunch or texture and flavor.  

Inexpensive ranging from $2.25 to $6.25 for a family size cup.

Very good but more of a sweet treat than a chilling refresher (I guess that's why we have beer).

Probably the best deal you can get in Vegas.  For the price of one hand of blackjack you can get a nice hot sandwich and a full belly.  

I came back twice just because I liked it so much.

I dug the Veggie (lent) and it was pretty awesome!  I also had the full Montague and it was delish as well.  The meat is perfection, nice and rare and juicy, I just wish I could have a huge pile of the meat!

The Caprese was okay, I kinda felt like it was an afterthought.  And their was only one piece of basil for the entire sandwich....I'd skip that one next time.

Someone should open up a franchise in LA because it would make a killing.

Being an Arizona native, walking into Black Bear Diner the first time was a surprise.  Whoa.  Did I get transported to Redding, California or something?  It was like we stepped out of the concrete jungle of Goodyear and into a log cabin in the woods.  Hansel, get Gretel out of the oven!

I've visited this location for the past five or six years and the food is always great whether you come for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  The portions are generous and the food is always brought to you hot.  The chicken fried steak is one of my favorites and the chicken pot pie is pretty solid too.  I haven't tried their tempting desserts since I'm always beyond-stuffed by the time I'm finished with my meal but they got a delicious maltshake.  Malts... so much better than regular milkshakes!

Black Bear Diner is a cute rustic-looking eatery with friendly service and good food.  Come and give them a try!  I'd take BBD over Denny's and IHOP any day.

So, yeah... I finally made it to Comedy Spot the Saturday night of my bachelorette weekend.  I thought this would be the perfect activity post-dinner for our group... you would think, right?  

Wrong!  Going to the Comedy Spot after our dinner was actually quite the buzz kill... the drinks were horrible and the majority of the comedians were not funny at all.  It was absolutely freezing in the place too.  On top of all of that, our group got yelled at for being too loud not once, but twice.  Sorry to the other patrons but we were only talking because the comedians were not funny at all!  Well, except for two acts - one where they called me and another bachelorette on-stage and another that was two chicas from LA that sang songs about bikini waxing and cameltoe (yes, you read that right).  They were hilarious!  I actually just looked them up and found their MySpace Link: http://www.myspace.com/willsingforyourmom - Carlie and Doni - they were fab!

The headliner was not funny at all... we actually ended up leaving before the show was over.  Maybe we were there on an off night?  I'd maybe give them another shot if I knew the comedian performing... (or especially if Carlie and Doni ever headline) but I'm not rushing back anytime soon.

Quite the menu for such a tiny venue. OMG. I love a good rhyme! Maizie's made me a bit, um, crazy. Oh. Again. With the rhyming. I'm channeling Nipsy Russell. Impressive, cozy, urban space. And when I left. A smile on my face. Sadly my lunch choice, much like Elaine Joyce (this pop culture reference will really separate the young from the old), I say with a sigh, was dry, dry dry. I ordered a Milano sandwich with Italian meats and cheeses. Seriously. No. Really. Seriously. Quizno's or Subway would have been better. The fries were great, served with a "southwest" dipping sauce, i.e., mayo with chipotle sauce. The creamy artichoke dip with assorted, hot and fresh chips was yummy in my tummy. God. That was lame. Overall, my co-diners were "satisfied" with their lunches, not, however, going crazy for Maizie's. 

That said. I have high hopes, even when not high, for this Central Phoenix newbie! And the service was spot on I might add. Great vibe. Don't hide. Don't be lazies. Find Maizie's. 

Ok. I'm going to go back to playing with dolls and blocks now.

This is the exact place I love to hate. But I can't. I cannot hate you, Lodge. I just can't!

In fact, if this place didn't have taxidermied animals (yes, I just made a word up) and antler headpiece things as chandeliers, I would probably be giving this place 5 stars....... I KNOW! I can't believe it either!!

My first experience with The Lodge was as Yelp Bachelorette. I was hammered (give me a break; it was the most important day of my life so far) so I didn't think it was fair to review after not really "being there," if you know what I mean.

My second experience was last night with THE Bachelor himself, Dallas G. Yet again, the staff was incredibly friendly, quick with the service, and willing to accommodate my vegan, gluten free existence without fault. They have an amazing black bean veggie burger and orgasm inducing sweet potato fries.  DG could learn a thing or two from those fries.

Just Kidding. 

Now, here is the BEST part of all: THREE DOLLAR SKY VODKA DRINKS FOR THE LADIES.

You don't need to know the rest.

I have a dark and shameful past...Yelp is probably that best place for me to let it all out and begin the healing:)

Before I became the humble software marketing genius that I am today, I was a suit...a corporate stooge...I wasn't workin' for the man...in most cases, I was the man:)

During that time of my life, I picked up some very unsavory habits...including one of the most unsavory habits ever visited on self-important executives...fountain pens:)

God help, me...I still love them so:)

I still have every one of them and I still use them with regularity (I know, I make my living with the keyboard...more or less...but when I write for pleasure, it's usually on a fine Rhodia #19 graph pad, with one of my 73 lovely "writing instruments":)

There is something both soothing and exciting about the flow of ink on fine paper...sometimes, it's the only way to get a really coherent sentence together:)

Some of my pens, I can refill from my inkwell, but many require cartridges...cartridges that they don't always sell at Staples or Office Depot...

That's when I set off for the far reaches of Old Town Scottsdale and swing by Scottsdale Pen Company...home of all things pen:)

It's like a head shop, but for a different kind of addiction:)

What a gorgeous and glorious selection of truly marvelous writing instruments, writing instrument related paraphernalia and objet d'art:-)

They have the cousins to my Mont Blanc's, the younger brothers and sisters of my beautiful Parkers and Waterman's and Sheaffer's...they even have the utilitarian antecedents of my everyday Lamy's and Rotring's:)

They have beautiful new Acme's, Pelikan's and Pilot's and mechanical pencils, like my Faber-Castell Fat Boy:)

Oh, and the paper...lovely leather bound journals and tablets, beautiful Rhodia tablets from France...I get goosebumps! :-)

Finally, they have ink...lots and lots of ink...in cartridges, in bottles...and I need ink!

They had cartridges for my Cross and my Rotring, when I thought I was going to have to go to Colorado Pen or something...so glad I didn't have to go that route:)

It was definite "win" for me...I get to support a wonderful local business...I got to "use" a bunch of new pens (try that at Pink's)... and I got a whole new place to hang out and indulge my pen fantasies...at least until they get the restraining order:-)

Snobbish foodies who contemplate with furrowed brow, the intricate flavors brought forth by the deft hand of the chef, EAT ELSEWHERE!!!  Jaleo is about great traditional and modernist tapas, and a fun experience.

The long menu of unfamiliar sounding dishes can be intimidating.  Just remember, more = better.  

The menu is cohesive.  Each dish compliments or contrasts with others building layers of flavors or creating flavor explosions.  You can throw darts blindly at it and every selection would work together.  Don't get caught up in the details.  Dining on tapas should be social and fun!

After multiple visits, and tasting almost the entire menu, lets just say, my taste may not be the same as yours so rather than making specific dish recommendations, here are some general guidelines:

- Follow Andre Zimmern's maxim:  if it sounds good, eat it.  Try, try, try.  

- Do not pass on the jamones produced by Fermin (Spanish hams).  This is one of the few places that you can eat the real deal in the States.  The acorn fed, black footed pig has a very unfamiliar taste and might not be for everyone but try, try, try.

- Spanish wines and sherries pair perfectly with the tapas (mixed drinks, beer, and new world wines don't).  Unfamiliar with wines Spanish wines?  Ask for a recommendation.  The restaurant has a great selection by the glass.  Try, try, try.

- Keep it social.  Eat, drink (pass around a poron - just stick to the cava if you never tried it before so you don't stain your clothes), and enjoy!

Note:  Jaleo houses the incredible E, restaurant in a restaurant.  It's Jaleo on steroids.  See the reviews

Dining is an experience.  At Jaleo, your experience depends on you.  Live, love and enjoy!

Jimmy's is a long way from home for me. Even my GPS refused to find this place for me. But a quick phone call helped straighten out the directions. This place is owned by a nice couple that used to live in Chicagoland. There was about a 20 minute wait on a busy Saturday night; not a big deal for me.

Thanks to Robyn N. for telling me about this place. I was jonesing for some Chicken Vesusvio. I guess Chicken Vesusvio is a Chicago creation dating back to the Depression. So I was excited to actually have one of my favorites since I haven't been to Chicago in a few months.

I thought the pricing was fair and the dish itself was good (3 1/2 stars) but not the greatest. I would  probably try some other dishes before I ordered it again. For example, their Pizza looked awfully good as all the families seemed to have ordered pizza. I thought the service was excellent as well.

I've been awaiting a great eatery to replace the now defunct Chandler BBQ Company, and the wait was worth it.

I've had both the meat tortellini with bolognese and the marscapone with butternut squash ravioli, both made from scratch, both delightful.  I have huge expectations for their artichoke parmesan.  The restaurant does have a Facebook page when you can come and get a little extra info.  It's quaint and cute on the inside (seats 16) and they have a nice sized outdoor patio with ample seating, for al fresco dining.

The chef, Carlo, is friendly and excited for you to try his creations.  They have a chalkboard menu behind the counter, where you'll place your order, and a deli case with meats, cheeses and olives... soon to include desserts.

They offer hot and cold sandwiches, salads, pasta (with your choice of six sauces), and a few side dishes.  The beverage options include a fountain station.

Stop by for lunch or dinner.  Stay for the ambiance or get it to-go!

My friend had been talking about this place for a while, so we finally got the chance to meet up for a snow cone. They are located in the back corner of a parking lot, just behind the Shell gas station on Eastern and Sunridge Heights. 

Service was friendly and they offered us up as many samples as we wanted to try before committing to a flavor. I was initially interested in trying the caramel corn flavor but it was a little too sweet for me, so I opted for a fruitier option with grapefruit and added sour spray to make it a little tangier. My friend Sam opted for pear and we were both incredibly pleased with our snowcones. They were a little on the sweet side, but I think that was mostly due to them having used a little too much flavoring on the kid's size. I'll have to try a larger size next time and I'm really interested in trying their freckled frog next time for a zero calorie option that is lemon juice, salt and chile limon. 

According to their web site none of their flavors are made with high fructose corn syrup. Also, make sure to check out their Facebook page for specials and double punch stamp days.

One of the most unique steakhouses in Vegas offering a rare culinary delight:  MONTHS aged dry aged beef.

Read on, I promise not to talk about what the process really is.

Called "Riserva", the once USDA prime beef is aged six to 11 months before being trimmed and served.  The result is unlike "younger", 30-75 day dry aged beef.  The shorter aged steaks retain a beefy texture, very tender with a pronounced nutty, bleu cheese aroma and flavor with a massive umame finish.  The months aged beef, think prosciutto.  Broiled rare to mid rare at a low temperature.  There is no thick outer crust.  The flavor is mild and nutty with only the hint of bleu cheese aroma.  The beef is dense and oily.  It has a very different mouth feel.  It is extremely sweet.  Amazing but not for everyone.

Tip:  Request the "Riserva" steaks when making reservation.  The amount of aging doesn't matter.  The piece is selected when it has reached the correct characteristics.

Traditional dry aged steaks are excellent.  The rib eye and porterhouse both possess the classic umame packed dry aged goodness.  Excellent sear, tender and juicy.  Both steaks are meant to be shared.  If dining alone, both the bone in New York strip and Bone in filet mignon offer the same experience as the porterhouse in a more manageable 16oz portion.

All steaks are rubbed with rosemary before cooking.  It imparts a strong, woodsy flavor that enhances the sweetness of the beef.

Not into aged beef?  The 20oz bone in veal chop is excellent.  Natural, pasture raised veal, it has a light beef flavor with a soft texture.  It's dry rubbed with thyme and porcini powder that imparts a very flavorful earthy goodness.  A drizzle of fresh olive oil adds the perfect richness.

For starters, the fried calamari, "Shrimp alla Diavola", and Bucatini Amatriciana are excellent but why fill up.  You can get these at Batali's Italian eatery, B&B Ristorante.

The restaurant captures the spirit of Italy, an enjoyable, casual, jovial evening.  Don't go with an elegant stick up your, you know.  The bread will make your hands oily and gnawing the bone is encouraged.

Bravo!

Vegas' top sushi restaurant.

NOT an AYCE joint.  ZERO Americanized rolls.  PURE Edo style sushi.  

Before all my sushi loving yeeps book the trip; meaning no disrespect to the Vegas food scene, Kabuto is the best in Vegas, but does not come close to touching the perfection that is the two Michelin star Urasawa in LA.  Granted, it does not come close to the $500 per person price tag of Urasawa either.

Rambling food history lesson:  This is classic  Edo style sushi born from necessity (no refrigeration in the early 19th century).  Large fillets of fish (toro) wont spoil as fast at room temperature like small fish (saba) with their bacteria filled intestines or turn rancid from their oxidizing fat (ie anago).  Yummy thoughts.  So, big fish = raw, small fish = marinated, oily fish = cooked.  Most are brushed in shoyu  and include wasabi, to inhibit spoilage.

Culinary artistry / craziness has taken over and the humble street food is now served in minimalist zen surroundings,  beautifully sauced and presented the way the chef feels it should be.  Its considered disrespectful for the diner to alter the sushi.

Although you can order individual sushi, the omakase ($80) or nigiri sampler ($48) is the best way to experience the ideal progression of flavors.

Selections change daily depending on availability.  The seafood is sourced globally.  All extremely fresh.  The chu-toro and o-toro correctly graded and a fatty delight.  The giant clam and ama ebi cloyingly sweet with the perfect oceanic finish.  Firm texture.  The list goes on and on.

Very good quality, delicately seasoned, short grain rice.  Nice compaction, holding its form but not breaking the individual grains.  

For all its refinement, this is one bite finger food (don't expect pieces of fish so large it slides down your throat and sticks out of your mouth at the same time). Toss the chopsticks aside and dive right in!

Highly recommended.

1990's this place was the best club around.  Now it's the worst. I mean sure there are a few boobies to look at but that's about it.  

The girls don't talk to anyone and ask if you want a table dance.  I checked around the room a few times and other than the three dancers on the three stages THERE WERE NO OTHER GIRLS TO BE SEEN IN THE PLACE, (well other than the ones in our party, but they weren't dancing).

We tried asking the servers to bring us some dancers, and nothing.  We tried to make it rain money on the dancers and told them to come back and nothing!  This was a "busy" Saturday night so you would think the dancers would on their A game, but nothing. 

If I'm gonna go to a titty bar I at least want that stripper perfume sent on me next time!  I going to check out Band-Aids next time

I am obsessed with this place.  I am so glad they are about 25 miles away from my home, otherwise I would be there every weekend.  The wait is a little long once you hit 8 am., however I am "lucky" the twins wake up at 5:30am everyday.  After getting ready and gathering everything we needed we headed out.  We made it just after 7:30 am.  The only sad thing I realized this time is that the balloon twister person does not arrive until 9:00am.  Oh, well.  I am here for the food really.  I almost had a repeat of the first visit, but I decided to try a different pancake this time.  You can make any kind of combos.  So I decided for the Chilaquiles benny and the sweet potato pancakes.  I am torn, I think I almost liked the sweet potato pancake better that the pineapple upside down cake one.  I guess I have to go again to make sure.  The chilaquiles benny were so perfect.  Instead of an english muffin is a tortilla base round, so yummy, with a layer of pulled beef barbacoa, topped with a perfectly poached egg then draped with this creamy spicy sauce.  Sooooo good.  The kids had pancakes and my hubby had a breakfast taco plus the chilaquiles benny.  This time I also enjoyed the blackberry mimosa and the hubby had the am margarita, which was so strong he couldn't finish it.

Let me start off with this: I wouldn't eat here again if you paid me. 

We had seven in a party and made reservations.... even with the reservations we had to wait. I told the hostess that it was ridiculous to take reservations and then make people wait. After rolling her eyes she found three tables shoved them together and walked away. 

You want to talk about a real Yelp review? 

My party ordered one of each pizza on the menu. I am not joking. If this pizza is so good then we will try each one and take the left overs home! Right? 

WRONG! 

Everything was burnt and just plain blah. Not one person in my party liked the pizza and promised never to come back here again. 

The prices are preposterous, the people are pretentious and the pizza is pitiful.

Who you callin a Byatch! Bow down for your master! 

I read my first reviews of Bachi a while back and bookmarked it away for a Vegas trip.

Thanks Dave G. and Craig R for enlightening me to the way of the Bachi Burger. My journey is now only 1/2 complete as this young grasshopper is ready to fly, again the voices of Dave & Craig come creeping into my mind. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPNbCx7vGAaH7SbNPZ6oA?select=TECziqmB2XZ4E5psSvvKJw#TECziqmB2XZ4E5psSvvKJw

Review Noir

It was one of those nights when every drinking party ends in a fight.  A desert wind was blowing through the streets that night.  It was a hot wind that pulled insistently at your clothes and made the hair on the back of your neck stand up.  The streets were quieter than a dead cat under the guardrail aside a moonlit mountain road.

I was wearing my olive drab shorts and a black "Kill Your Television" t-shirt, I was sober and I didn't care who knew it.  I was everything an after-work regional manager ought to be and I was calling on Best of Italy.  She was exacting, charming and ruthless in the size of her slices.  I was feeling like a kid that likes to pull the legs off of spiders.  No more sense of morals than a downtrodden puppy.

She's a grifter, a voice barked from the back of my mind.  Maybe she is, I thought, but what does this five-dollar special want?  Behind the flash, behind the smile, was there nothing but poison under that sauce?  I had to know, even if it meant the big sleep by morning.

I tried her slices and they were good.  No, they were more than good and held that inner truth.  You know the truth I'm talkin' about.  The truth that makes you aware of just how aware you are. You know the world belongs to men like you, men who act as if it's a right to great pizza.  Pizza like this.  The truth that tells you the world would be a better place and not too dull to live in if there were more pizza like this around.  Because you're a part of it now, see?  The crust and the sauce and the cheese and the toppings...they're in you now and you can't go back.

Sadly, my knowledge of Greek food comes from My Big Fat Greek Wedding and a killer hangover from a few too many shots of cheap ouzo and pine sap Retsina to wash down "Greek" takeout in Hawaii. 

With those credentials to back me, here goes.  The Great Greek makes very good, tasty Greek food.  Simply put, proteins are juicy and properly cooked, breads are fresh, everything is flavored with fresh herbs and well seasoned.  

Dolmades (grape leaves stuffed with rice dill and other herbs) a real surprise.  Dense, moist and herbaceous, the leaves so tender you can eat them.

Lamb and beef gyro and grilled chicken gyro are real standout.  Juicy, well seasoned, sliced beef and lamb or chunks of chicken , atop simple veg, bathed in a zesty tzaziki, piled with a tart goat milk ricotta all enveloped by a fresh, warm, fluffy pita.

Grilled steak souvlaki, no complaints.  Deeply flavored, juicy tenderloin on skewers over a fluffy rice pilaf.  A squeeze of fresh lemon to brighten up the dish.   Done.  

Finally, desert; baklava.  What's not to love, flaky filo, butter, sugar, walnuts, cinnamon all bathed in honey.

Friendly counter service.  Clean dining area.  Reasonable prices.

Poker Pro Tip:  Give a bud who lives in the area a ride to the WSOP. On the way stop for lunch.  For days after "hey, you want me to stop at that Greek place and get you something?"  Heck yeah!

Ponder if you must, is the food so good because it's different from our norm or is it the difference from its norm that makes it delicious?  It's all Greek to me.

Overpriced, mediocre food. Bland atmosphere. Completely out of place and awkward feeling. Peculiar Rabbit is what happens when you have no vision of what you want to do, but decide to try and capitalize on the success of other businesses in an area. None-the-less, considering who owns it, I'm sure they will spend all the money they can to try and turn it into the go to spot... Even if people only begrudgingly go there.

Case in point: After a dismal turnout for their first 2 months, they decided to start paying $2500 a month to buy up 210 parking spots (far more than necessary for a business of this size) that were previously used for free community parking for all businesses in the area. Now, these spots have been turned into $5 premium parking spots. As a reward to anyone who pays $5, you get a $5 credit at Peculiar Rabbit! Nice, right? No, because you can't just swing by for a drink and get back your money... They expect you to build up a $50 tab at their overpriced restaurant first, before getting that $5 credit. Needless to say, the $50 catch isn't posted on the signs when you pull into the paid parking area. This is the bait and switch mentality of a failed business idea being forced upon a thriving neighborhood.

None-the-less, find some free parking and check out some of the great bars and restaurants in the area who don't need to turn their customers upside down and shake them to get a couple bucks. For breakfast / brunch, I suggest checking out Zada Janes, Bistro La Bon, or Soul. For lunch / dinner, I suggest Midwood Smokehouse, Soul, Dish, Diamond, Fuel Pizza. For drinks, check out Elizabeth Billiards, Twenty Two, Common Market, Thirsty Beaver, Snug Harbor.

Don't waste your time here.

I hate writing a bad review for an Asian-American owned business, but I feel it is my obligation to advocate for future patients who may suffer from neglectful and unethical practices.

Everything went wrong from the very beginning. At Medical and mental health clinics, it's not common to find unempathetic and distant desk workers. They somewhat need to act like this as a risk management strategy due to the fact that we now live in the era of HIPPA thanks to Slick Willy. But, the attitude at PROCARE was excessively cold and they facilitate an atmosphere which may lead patients to believe that they are at a for-profit clinic that only cares about billing and not your recovery. Funny thing was that when they found out I was a yelper, they started kissing my ass. Suddenly, HIPPA no longer existed and I was a VIP. 

My main issue was due to some of the unethical practices. The Dr. did not see me for more than 2 minutes, and made a rushed assessment. I was prescribed a medication which my body had a severe reaction to. I called the next day, and the uninterested front desk worker told me to "take benadryll" and go on with my life. When I explained the severity of the symptoms, she invited me back for a follow up visit, "FREE OF CHARGE". When I arrived the next day, the front desk girl said that I could not see the Dr. unless I paid. Remember that this is a for-profit clinic, and billing and making money is their number one concern. I was in severe pain due to the adverse reaction from the medication, so I just paid the money and saw the same Dr. The Dr. informed me that I couldn't prove that the medication was causing these adverse symptoms and he claimed I had an unrelated virus that was causing my symptoms. He then prescribes me an "anti-viral" drug and sends me on my way. When I went to the Pharmacist, the Pharm.D(Doctor of Pharmacology) told me that the "anti-viral" medication that was prescribed to me was not in any way an anti-viral medication and that I was given false information. She explained to me that the so called anti-viral medication was a steroid used to treat inflammation from drug-induced side effects. The same drug induced side effects I was experiencing from the prescription medication that  PROCARE claimed was not causing the adverse reaction. I now wanted to get a second opinion so I went to my usual MD in Summerlin who told me that the drug originally prescribed to me has side effects which are absolutely relevant to the symptoms I was experiencing(blistering rash, troubles breathing, swelling eyes, flu-like symptoms, swollen lips and tongue). The MD also expressed that the misleading information that PROCARE gave me could possibly have been an unethical risk-managment strategy. 

I believe the dishonesty and unethical practices are a consequence of the Dr's educational background. I did some research after all of this happened to me. If you google PROCARE's Dr, you will see that he went to an unaccredited medical school which is headquartered oversees, and he got his undergrad in South America. Most states including California, Maine, Oregon, Texas, New York and Indiana declare this medical school an "Institution Whose Degrees are Illegal to Use" or "not recognized or disapproved medical school to practice in state." Nevada is one of the only states that allows graduates from this school to practice. Even the BBC states that the medical school is only operational due to a "loophole which allows them to operate unregulated". These foreign schools recruit many from the US, and present an unaccredited scam-degree. I know from experience, years ago I fell for a scam law program which was headquartered oversees. Every time you see a professional with one of these oversees degrees, just walk away.

I am sensitive to the fact that medical doctors do make mistakes and misdiagnose at times, and the Dr. and nurses are actually very nice... but I am more dissatisfied over the  unethical billing procedures where they led me on to believe the follow up appointment was free to trick me into making the 20 mile drive over there.

I'm listening to Wendy Rene's "After Laughter Comes Tears," as I type this.

Which means that Mix is worthy of greatness.

It's a ballad in of itself

Largely the reason for the delay of this review.

I was...

Afraid I wouldn't do our dinner right, and would smear the experience with buzzy cliches and "OMGS."

Afraid that it wouldn't come out right. It wouldn't sound as fabulous. As bold. And as perfect as it truly was.

But with Wendy Rene and Rihanna's Take A Bow as the sound rack of this review - I just have to go for it.....

..........

With cascading class bubbles, smooth buttery leathery booths, and a view along the way to the bathroom that will make your knees weak, Mix is a breathtaking splurge. 

Service is impeccable. Our waiter's descriptions of the menu was  spoken word. You could feel his passion for the food, burning him, as his dazzling analogies sprung from him. 

We felt like tanned queens, as we shared stories about the Bay area with the staff, while we sampled a menu that sang of a kitchen that you just knew was impeccable, where art happened every day, and in which chefs breathed life into meat, vegetables, and sponge cake with a deep belly love that managed to capture their "natural" essence.

Their rich flavors. Their vibrant colors. Their smooth textures.

Part of me longs to recommend dishes, but Mix is too exciting. You need to explore the menu on your own.  Listen to the waiters' share their own personal favorites. 

After  - head on over to Mix Lounge.

And on the way back.

Pose for pictures on Mix's stairwell, as you tug down your Pretty Woman polyster pre-makeover bright green dress (for men: a beige linen slightly wrinkled suit), lips rolling up to expose a big Vegas smile, still sticky with the fresh fruity taste of a passion fruit foam cocktail that touched your soul enough to put on Wendy Rene.

The Wife and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner in a relaxed environment and she suggested we dine at Verandah.  Located in the Four Seasons @ Mandalay Bay, this restaurant is a great getaway where you don't feel like you're on the Las Vegas Strip.

After browsing the menu, we decided to order:

Salad
Caprese - Beefsteak Tomato, Campania Buffalo Mozzarella, Pesto
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=KdUUseaYZ5I3jPuDCwhiWA

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/duw-3Aj7gAKbQG-isS5UtQ?select=3OCmQkKjb43sK0JY_bC66w

For Dessert
Warm Italian Donuts, Lemon Curd, Chocolate Ganache

I had the Caprese Salad and the Penne Alla Arrabiata.  Both were amazing!  The Penne Alla Arrabiata was made al dente, which is how I love my Pasta and the Arrabiata Sauce had a nice kick to it....just right.  The Caprese Salad was not overdone with Oil, unlike some restaurants.

The Wife enjoyed her Lobster Salad and Striped Bass.  She passed on Dessert, but I couldn't resist the Warm Italian Doughnuts, so I went for it.....they were so good, I forgot to take a picture of them and they were gone by the time I remembered....:)

The service was impeccable.  The servers were friendly and attentive.  They were also very knowledgable about the menu and had great ideas for dinner.

Overall, it was an another awesome experience here.

Chiploplo, Chipoodle, Chipotopolay

Looking for a pre-show meal, we saw the nearby choices of A)McDonald's, B)Panda Express or C)Chipotle.  Considering I don't like McDonald's, Panda Express is on my usual restaurant rotation & I haven't had Chipotle in a few years, the time was ripe to give Chipotle another go.

My choice - the barbacoa bowl.  

My 2 cents - It was..........how do I put this?  Boring.  Boring like the scene in "Ferris Beuller's Day Off" where Ben Stein is going "Anyone..........?  Anyone.........? Beuller........?Beuller.........?"  Boring like having a CSPAN viewing party on Valentine's Day.  Nothing says "sexytime" than Senate hearings in HD;p

Now, it wasn't bad, per se.  It's just, as I get older, I want my tastebuds to be titillated!  (I just said "titillated" *giggle*)  The portions were good.  The price was reasonable.  Also, kudos to the staff for efficiently moving the big Las Vegas line along.  Wait was minimal.  To me, I'd rather go to a local taqueria for some authentic and cheap fare, w/o the line of hipsters, Beliebers and Twi-hards.  

Chipotle is situated in a primo location to lure in the tourists.  The restaurant was clean and the staff knows how to handle the crowds coming in for sustenance, like me.  

Chipotle has it's fans, and more power to them for liking what they like.  I may return if I'm walking by, the next time I'm in Vegas.  It's convenient and the prices are reasonable, considering the dining options in the casinos.

"What would you do if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key."-"With A Little Help From My Friends", Beatles

Beatles LOVE, with seating in the round, so not a bad seat in the house.  It's been showcased on the Strip for a long time now, and still draws the crowds nightly.

We used Tix4Tonight to score some primo seats for cheap.  There's a part of the act where a surpise is brought out to the audience and we happened to be the very last row to participate.  I won't spoil it, but it was fun!

Pre-show, some clowns put on some comic relief by, literally, blowing smoke up people's arses.  Kinda creepy, kinda funny - it was great seeing people's reactions.

The highlights of Beatles LOVE, for me, were the aerialist during "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" & the act featuring "Strawberry Fields Forever".  Very touching.  I didn't care much for the halfpipes and rollerbladers.  Oh, and the music is on blast!  I'm talking loud!  So, just be mindful of that, if you have sensitive hearing.

Overall, a great show worth the money & time while in Vegas!  I highly recommend using Tix4Tonight for purchasing tickets the day before/day of.  Our seats were great & we saved a lot of money.  I'm generally not a Cirque du Soleil fan, but I highly enjoyed this eclectic & colorful show.

Food (from HH menu):

Albacore Nigiri: 3.5 stars
Smooth, good sized piece & tasty. 

Tuna Nirgiri: 3 stars
Fresh, no fishy smell / taste & good portion size.

Salmon Skin Roll: 2.5 stars
There wasn't much salmon skin inside of the rolls but more rice surrounding all of the rolls than anything. 

Squid Salad: 3 stars
The squid in this salad tasted exactly like the squid salad mixture that Costco has, except this had extra greens on the bottom of the mixture.

Dynamite Roll (Cali roll w/ baked crab on top): 3 stars
This had way too much rice & sauce on top which overwhelmed the whole roll. 

Overall: clean place with good atmosphere & good sized portioned food here. 

If you like rolls more than sashimi then you'll like this place. =)  

Service: Very slow, they forgot to check on us during the meal & we had to wave them down several times for water. -1

My quest for the ultimate donut in Vegas continues. This time I visited the Donut Hut, another highly regarded establishment in the Yelp community. Will this take the throne of Ronald's? We shall see.

A small shop located on the east side of Vegas, it's on Desert Inn and Mojave, between Pecos-Mcleod and the 515. I've never actually driven on this road before. It's so old school, it's like driving through a time warp! The hours are great, Tues-Sun 7:30 pm to 1 pm; it's great for late night snacks, and morning breakfast (I think the guy changes the hours regularly, so, don't hold me to those hours)

The donuts here are more of your traditional variety. I decided to pick up three to go.

- Apple Fritter : It was crisp, and soft in the middle. It doesn't have as much apple flavor as the one at Ronald's. Plus, the one at Donut Hut is smaller than the one at Ronald's. But otherwise, it was very tasty.

Glazed donut - well made glazed donut. Soft, but not doughy. Not too sweet, which is good. 

Cruller - first time trying a cruller. Choux dough shaped in a fluted ring, then fried. Light and airy, not too sweet. It was solid.

I paid 3.85 for all three, and I got a really good value for what I paid. Does this beat out Ronald's? No. It is a great option for those living out east, or those who want a late night donut.

BTW, when you enter the store, you will see pictures of policemen all over the wall. The owner told me why.. policemen are the best judges of a good donut. LMAO

The idea of paying for a self-wash seemed a little silly, but after trying it at home and making a big mess -- only to end up with the dog outside in the mud within minutes after the bathing, and leaving them so moist that a funky smell develops as they dry -- it became an obvious and worthwhile choice.

My first experience with self-wash, at a nearby competitor, was horrible, but my time at Wag&Wash was so much better.

The facility here is clean and fairly spacious.  The stainless steel tubs are sturdy, and the spray equipment and drains all worked well.  They had a rubber brush to use on the dog's fur while sudsing and washcloths available for cleaning ears, etc.

I did have a little trouble with the suction-cup-leash that was supposed to hold my 70 lb dog secured to the front side of the tub.  
It didn't.  
A wet dog jumping over the edge of a slippery wet stainless steel tub that's elevated several feet over a slippery wet tile floor is not a healthy combination for the poor dog, who pulled a "Bambi on ice" and comically (but i'm sure painfully) spread all four limbs out in all directions and landed face first on the floor.  I asked for a non-suction-cup leash and secured him to a bar at front of the tub afterwards, but damage done.

Just go with the basic wash; the pricing options for various extras aren't worth it.  Why pay an extra several dollars for a specific scent of shampoo, when there isn't a conditioner with the same scent, since the conditioner is what the dog ends up smelling like afterwards, not the shampoo?

The blow dryers were powerful enough to blow out not only the water, but lots of leftover hair.  Sometimes the nozzle end blew off the hose, but i'd rather have the blowers be too hard than too soft.

I feed rawmeatybones, so i didn't shop the food selection much, but the premium brands offered are expectedly pricey.  I did pick up a rubber brush for cheap de-furring.

I will be back to use my frequent washer card.

Yo Imma let you finish but Fat Choy has one of the best burgers in all of Vegas!!!!
Have you ever had a meal so surprisingly good that you had to go full kanye? Well Fat Choy did that to me. Now I'll be honest, fat Choy isn't a place I would've found normally because it's inside the eureka casino, which is one of those off strip casinos that seem to be filled with the same group of anonymous gamblers. 
The decor is interesting. It's diner style, lots of interesting pictures and a chalkboard with the daily special
Now about that food. There's the pork belly BLT, it's exactly what it sounds like, a BLT with pork belly that's so soft and tender that it's  slap yo mama good. The duck bao was money. I found out after that they started off as a food truck selling that, which makes sense. The piece de resistance is the eponymous fat Choy burger. Im gonna just roll call the ingredients, please try to not drool on the screen: half pound patty, short ribs, bacon, egg, onion jam, plus all the regular burger fixings on a soft bun. I demolished that burger quicker than usain bolt does the 100m. 
Long story short, this place is filthy good. I love this place, everyone I brought here loves it. Odds are if you read this far you'll love it too

A new American diner serving up end comfort foods.

We're talking salads with heirloom this, organic that, quality sandwiches with aioli, pesto.  No fries or steamed veggies.  Instead fried Portobellos, and roasted cauliflower.  Fried fish?  No. Wood roasted salmon, sea bass, cod, halibut.   Oh yeah, BUTCHER'S CUTS.

Straight to it, Butcher's cuts are some of the most flavorful cuts of beef.  Tougher, less even marbling, strong mineral and beef flavor, uneven thickness, Never cooked above medium rare to the disdain of the have it your way folks.  

Good offerings.  All fire grilled with a good sear and smoky bitterness that enhances its natural flavor.  They have been seasoned, rubbed, or marinated to mask some of the characteristics some find off-putting.  Request all cuts seasoned with simple salt if you want to do a natural tasting.

The cuts from highest to lowest fat content and lowest to highest beefy flavor:  rib cap, skirt, tri tip, flat iron, and hanger.

Traditional steak cuts of grass feed beer are also offered.  Well trimmed, grass fed flavor, decently tender but BORING compared to the butcher's cuts.

Other mains just OK.  Fish is cooked at too high a temperature resulting in visible albumin and tougher flesh. 

"Small plates" (can be used as starters or sides) include a great dish of roasted heirloom carrots, seasoned roasted cauliflower with chili de Arbol, shallots and onions, and portabello fries with their meaty, mushroomy goodness in a crispy coating.  All perfect foils to any steak.  

Short but very well chosen wine list.  Service befitting a diner; friendly with some lapses.  Great prices with mains priced less than $18 and Butcher's cuts less than $23.  Bottom line; all good!

Stone Crabs ... We came to Joe's for the famous Stone Crabs ..., but they didn't have any. Why? Only Joe's knows. We should of left.

Unfortunately, Joe's was already our second choice of the night (after seeing the long line at Bacchanal) and we weren't going in search of a 3rd restaurant. We were hungry, so, let's eat at Joe's.

Luckily, the other food was pretty tasty. We started with some glasses of inexpensive Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon and a Colossal Lump Crab Cake ($17). I liked the big bits of crab that didn't require (or have) much other seasoning (4 stars). 

Equally, the Chilean Sea Bass with Miso Glaze & Bok Choy ($37) and 20 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye Steak ($53) were 4-star entrees. The sea bass was flaky and the miso subtle. Meanwhile, the juicy and tender rib eye was meaty despite not being an elite steak. As a side, we split a creamy Wild Mushroom Mac and Cheese ($11) that excited thanks to the mushrooms and disappointed with lame cheese (3 stars).

Sadly, the service was weak. We suffered long gaps between being seated, ordering, getting food, or service. We wanted to try the acclaimed Key Lime Pie, but chose to try a different place at the Forum Shops at Caesars rather than put up with the poor service.

Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab is famous in Miami for fantastic Stone Crabs and Key Lime Pie. We didn't get to try either. Instead, Joe's became a basic Joe Schmo steak and seafood chain with high prices for the average Joe.

What a crust!  

OK so it's from a small chain pizzeria.  But hey, this is Vegas, this is the Strip.  They are going to copy the NY original like no other place else can.  Classic 1200 degree coal burning ovens, formulated water with identical pH and mineral content of NYC water (not sure if this is a good thing).  All leads to what is undoubtedly one of the best NYC style pizza crust.  It's blistered,  well seasoned, just the right thinness with the perfect chew, with the perfect hint of smoky bitterness.  

Dirt cheap for the Strip.  $9 for a personal 12" red sauce pie $10 for a garlic white sauce or pesto.  Add $2 per topping including some great spiced meatballs, sweet Italian Sausage (American style), tender oven roasted peppers and milky mozzarella.  Mild intensity to any of the sauces to let the toppings show through.

Calzones are excellent.  Same great dough as the pies, same great filling in a hand held pouch.

True NYC pizzeria feel with the manager, hostess, and bartenders loudly shooting the breeze right at the door (when it's not too busy).  

A well chosen  selection of wines focusing on Italy, most offered by the glass or half carafe (500ml or 2/3 of a whole bottle).  Reasonable prices.  Half off all wines on Tuesdays.

A welcome, affordable addition to the Palazzo.

Sushi Samba was the perfect spot to fill up on tasty food after a quick shopping spree at The Shoppes at The Palazzo with my fashionista girlfriend. We went straight for the $16 Chilean seabass bento box, which was the best deal on the lunch menu. It came with miso soup, field green salad, tuna roll and oshinko pickles. 

The three skewers of miso glazed seabass, along with all the sides, was a nice amount of food (though could've been a little small for a big appetite), but I seriously could have eaten three more skewers. The seabass was amazing! That miso marinade was to die for. I suppose I could've gotten the entree portion, but for lunch, it was perfect. Plus, $29 is a bit much to spend on a lunch entree. There were six tuna rolls, so that also made the bento filling.

The funky decor was really cool, and reminded me a little of Blowfish in the bay area -- but much bigger and with Latin influences intertwined. The staff was awesome, and the food came out quick. We were in and out in a flash, and back to the pool before our guys even missed us.

Was in the area seeking new places to try for lunch and found Crpe Bar , so off I went.  It was Friday little after 11 and the place was busy, but not overly busy, I was able to get my order in and find me a seat. I have to say I love the vibe of this place.

I originally went seeking a savory crpe, but after looking over the menu I went with a savory & sweet crpe. Oh boy, this was not a good diet day. Haha

I ordered the breakfast burrito crpe, eggs, bacon, queso jack, avocado salsa. Let me tell you, this was amazing, it took an entirely different perspective on the breakfast burrito, and the chipotle crpe just made it that much better! The flavors of everything blended perfectly, was surprised when I noticed I ate it all :( where did it go? Who did that?  

I also ordered the first time, I was sold on this because it was with Nutella - that stuff is crack!!! Love it!!!.  The crpe was beautifully prepared it was filled with that glorious Nutella (either you love Nutella or you hate it) and surrounded by mind blowing banana brle OOHHH MMMYYY FFFFFNNNN GGGGGAAAAAWWWWDDD!!! Banana Brle Who thought of this!! Bananas with crispy sugar coating mixed with Nutella!!! Genius!!!! 

Crpe Bar expect to see me on a regularly basis!

A 24 hour cheap hot sandwich place is a vegas jackpot!!!  I always find myself having sandwich cravings and i'd been spending weeks looking at the reviews. I had decided way before i stepped into the store at PH, that i would be ordering the Full Montagu- Roast beef and turkey!!! 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=pqiqUiWVESs9LubdKK2zcw
We were still full from breakfast, so i didn't get to try a second sandwich as i had hoped (i'm definitely getting the canonball meatball sammie next time). I'm sure after i try a few more different sammies here, i would upgrade to a 5, but based on just the one i had, i just needed a little something more. More mayonaisy sauce? Avocado? Not sure. But i am not craving it, as i do with Cooks, Mendo, Caps or Langers. But... I will be back for sure to get the cannonball and get ANOTHER brownie whoopie pie !! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=DbdvnjAtWRE2Hj0_MbX26Q

"The noblest of all dogs is the hot-dog; it feeds the hand that bites it. " - Lawrence J. Peter.

After having Short Leash numerous times at events around the valley, I finally gotten around to visiting their place and boy am I full!  Strolled in today after a dramatic parking adventure with Linh L. and we ordered a delicious meal.  Between the two of us, we had a root beer, a ginger ale, corn dog bites, the Igby, and the Sunny.  Our bill came out to about $30 before tip for the both of us.  Admittedly, it's a bit of a splurge for wieners on naan bread but hey, it's Friday, I paid my student loans, and I wanted some good eats.  It's always good eats with Short Leash!  The Bear caught my eye but I was thinking I wanted something with some greens.  That Sunny... pure bliss.  It had pear with some honey, prosciutto, goat cheese, arugula, cracked black pepper, with a chicken wiener on fluffy warm naan bread.  Savory-sweet [with a hint of bitterness from the arugula]  wins me over every time.  I think it's more than just puppy love...

Other yummy items that have crossed these lips:  The Bear, Mac Daddy, fried pickles, jalapeno poppers, the pimento cheese dip, and the brat-stuffed pretzel.  Yum!  Try to save room for their dessert items.  If I didn't feel like passing out right on the spot from that food coma, I would have loved to split the orange-glazed and pistachio doughnut or the maple and candied bacon.  Gimme gimme!  More reason to arrange lunch again with some friends, right?  *cough, hint, cough* Mike W., Laz C., Brett B., Melodie C., Meghan L., and Linh L.

A $19 cobb salad with a $3 PBR. Well, let's be real here...eventually we learned of buckets of PBR, six for $15. DEAL! SOLD! The cocktail list is lively, fresh and inventive and pricey as one would expect at a resort. 

We took shelter in our private cabana and had stellar service from AJ. We were served a fruit and veggie platter along with other things we ordered...nachos were delicious...as was my cobb salad.

The cabana was comfortable with a u shaped seating area with complimentary bottled water (well, complimentary my ass...it's part of the $200 that was paid for the cabana...but I digress) and of course plenty of clean, fresh towels. 

The entrance, the grounds, the main pool...everything just so vibrant, clean and utterly breathtaking. The crowd was so NOT douchey. It was a nice mix of old and young, gay and straight and black and white...you get the picture. We met a lot of fun people during our six hours there. 

Now. The best part. My friends, young as they are, were staying for happy hour. Well I had my limit of PBR's and had a Schnauzer in diapers waiting for her afternoon walk, so I decided to split. The concierge directed me to the bellman and said he would help me get a taxi. The bellman asked if a towncar would be ok? Um. Hmm. A pristine, shiny black town car or a roll of the dice with a skanked out taxi with a sweaty, hairy, stinky driver. Yes. Town car. 

It. Was. Perfect. I was sunburnt. Tipsy. And on my way home. The drive down the 51 is so beautiful. When he pulled into my driveway and said it was $29 (a deal!)...I gave him two twenties and thanked him. Cuz that's how I roll.

I heard about this place online just today.  They opened not too terribly long ago, but when I heard the name of the store and what type of business it was, there was no question that I was bound to go soon, and by "soon", I mean "immediately".  Weird and unique businesses draw me in like a magnet, so awaaaaaaaaay I went.

Pulling up in the strange little lot is an all-black store adorned with Tiki torches, and a dinosaur on the roof.  "Why a dinosaur", you ask?  Who the Hell knows, really.  But I figure if people are already in the acceptance stages of zombies ravaging and consuming the planet, who is going to notice the occasional dinosaur smattering here and there?  Besides, why are you worrying about dinosaurs anyway when there are zombies about?  Geez, people.  Priorities!

Inside, the store is a fantastical cornucopia of all you'll ever need to survive when the shizz hits the fan... and a synthetic lawn store.  I actually commend this.  Just because society is going to Hades in a handbasket doesn't mean that you can't appreciate a proper, well manicured lawn.  If there's anything worse than zombies, it's an irate HOA on your back because your survival bunker isn't up to code.

But they have a plethora of swords, tazers, and axes, zombie training dummies and shooting range targets, and even artwork.  And food.  Oh, so much food.  Need a kit that will cover the hunger needs of 200 people?  They've got it for a mere $100.  You may even have enough to cater a wedding after a tough day of fending off the hordes of the undead.

This is all well and good, but I finally decided on a decently priced survival pack for my car, which looked suspiciously like the med packs from "Left 4 Dead".  Actually, it's a nice little kit in case I get stuck out somewhere, and need supplies in a pinch.

They even do zombie themed in-store events.  Max Brooks of "World War Z" fame actually came out there about two weeks back (dang it) for a book signing, and they have video forecasting the impending doom.

But in seriousness, if you want to look at it from the "Real World" perspective, it's a decent place to prepare for a camping trip, or some related outdoor activity.  The prices aren't bad, the theme is certainly funny, and the staff (Larry and Mike) are super nice and eager to answer any questions.  If you seriously want to stock up on some long-term survival supplies or that sword on the go, they have a person covered.  Stores with a sense of humor win me over every time.

So to paraphrase the old saying: Run, don't shamble to apparently the only store who will have our backs when the dead return to walk the Earth.

And those periodic dinosaur attacks that are bound to crop up.  Man, the future's going to be weird....

I've been here a few of times with friends, and like the food very, very much.

There is a reason, there are over 500 plus Chicago style (Italian Beef & or Hot Dog) places in Chicagoland and why no one can agree.  

You have Al's Beef, Super Dawg, Gold Coast, Luke's, Joey's, Portillo's, U Dawg U, Little Louie's, Michael's Red Hot, and so on, and so forth.  

Just for fun, type-in: "Italian Beef" into Yelp's Chicago search engine and see all the choices.  I was surprised that the computer didn't crash, and that was just for "Italian Beef", try "Hot Dog" afterwards, too.

So, is it truly a wonder why several Chicago-ites cannot agree on what a good Chicago place is here in the Valley of the Sun?  

What Chicago Hamburger does best, can be found in their name.  Hamburgers!  More specifically, Sliders!

If you have ever been to a White Castle, then you know what a Slider is.  Sorry for ending in a preposition. 

Imagine what a good All Beef Slider would taste like if you used quality meats and put more then 1 oz of meat on a bun.  Now you know all you need to know about Chicago Hamburger Company!   And, the price for this Windy City Slider?  $0.99!

Oh, one additional item -- you need to get here early or late, because the kids start arriving from school around 11:30, and CHC has a ridiculously tiny parking lot.  You've been warned!

So run, don't walk to Chicago Hamburger Company for their Windy City Slider, or to Al's Beef for a great Italian Beef or Luke's for a great Hot Dog.  I call that a division of labor.

Enjoy!

On a perfectly mild sunny day in vegas, it was a great choice to eat on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi overlooking Las Vegas Blvd. As soon as we entered the restaurant from the casino entrance, from the dark interior, it was like stepping into a whole different world once we got seated on the patio. 
Usually when servers rattle off the specials of the day, it goes out the other ear for me. But after looking over the menu and half heartedly deciding on the spinach and gruyere omlette, I heard the server mention Bacon and Spinach Eggs Benedict and i was sold! Quiche Lorraine with bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=4Ua39HREZlvlYbEf3EP_ew for the dude and my friend got the dish i was thinking of originally http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=5luau0SKUmjSVfXBalxsMQ. We all agreed that my dish ended up being the best: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=T3jPSmE56xcETgTqjegttw.
The quiche had a nice crust, but was kind of monotonous. (i love breakfast sides and this had none). The spinach omelette was ok- i enjoyed my omelette at Max Brenner much more. 
I've only had eggs benedict a few times elsewhere and i have to say this one was very yummy- the eggs were perfectly runny and the bacon (i believe it was applewood) was nice and crispy. 
We were too sweets wasted this time to order the pancakes, french toast etc, so next time i would like to try those or the steak dishes with a side of their onion soup!

Bouchon is more than just breakfast.

"I'll buy dinner and the wine" says Lucas, my poker bud from France, "as long as it's French" then giggles.

"Ever heard of Thomas Keller?"  I remark.

"The dry cleaning guy?"  he quips in his thick French accent, as if the chef of one of the greatest restaurants in the US, the Michelin three star French Laundry, can't compare to the French.

"Bouchon it is but if you like the food, you pay the check and twice that to me in cold, hard cash".

"Book it" is the smug reply.

Truly French, baguette, chewy, expertly baked with a crisp crust.  It's required to carry the delicious "stuff" that is to follow:

(1) Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard - Velvety smooth with a clean foie taste, balanced saltiness and a kiss of Sauternes sweetness.

(2) Pate de Champagne; a country style pate akin to a finely ground head cheese.  Delicious tasty bits of this and that.  Perfect with grain mustard and cornichons that elevate it's natural sweetness.

(3) Rillettes aux Deux Saumons (a combination of fresh and smoked salmon rillettes, prepared in terrine and topped with a layer of clarified butter.  Rich, fatty, salty salmon bits begging to be spread on some crusty bread.

Finally the must have, Brandade de Morue ala Provencal.  Not the traditional whipped salt cod and olive oil, this interpretation is deep fried into crisp, light balls of goodness.  Incredible.

A nice selection of creamy goat, sheep, and cows milk cheeses finishes the meal.

Service is French casual and Vegas friendly.

Short but very well chosen French / domestic French style wine list.  $100 average bottle price with few selections below $65.

Oh yeah, "Pay up Frenchie".  He did; in Euros.  Ugh.

If I lived here I would probably be dead in a year. LOL! Walk the strip and view the freak show that is AMURRICA!

Sure, when in Vegas it's almost mandatory to take a walk on The Strip to view the sights. To me it's always better at night when everything is lit up in all it's cheesy glory! Plus, if there during the summer season walking The Strip in the day is inviting heat stroke! Damn, it's hot over here. 

Don't get fooled by the optical illusion thinking that the casino you want to walk to is close as after shlepping a half hour you realize you should have taken a cab, the monorail, or the shuttle that runs along The Strip. Still, the views of the massive casinos all lit up and the free shows make it worth a trek up and down The Strip. The Pirate Show at Treasure Island, the Volcano at the Mirage, the Dancing Waters at the Bellagio to name a few.

Hey, at least you are allowed to drink in public here so load up a cold one and have at it as you walk by the hordes of tourists, Eurotrash, bachelor and bachelorette parties, and assorted middle America white trash WalMart crowd that seems to gather here. Don't forget to view the crazies, homeless, porn card slappers, bad street performers, drunk blotto people, and those annoying characters in knock off costumes posing for money. The craziness never ends! It's almost like being in Times Square NYC!

The Las Vegas Strip is an amusement park of kitschy weirdness in itself. I love cheesy and approve totally!

This Swiss bakery has been my go-to spot for cakes and macarons. I first noticed this bakery on Yelp, and the owner makes everything from scratch with natural ingredients. Foot traffic is rare, and the interior encompasses large glass cases, tiled floor, and colorful chocolates and European pastries to fill out the dcor.

The quarter sheet Custard Cake ($29.98) came with soft spongy cake, custard, and airy textures with moderate sweetness. My friends raved about its light-tasting qualities and I really enjoyed it too. The website says the cake can feed 15-20 people, but I always have leftovers to share with others.

The quarter sheet Tiramisu ($29.98) came with good moisture and mascarpone flavor, but the consistency of the custard needed to be more refined. The overall flavor was borderline bland, and without rum this cake could use another anchor such as an aromatic coffee to render that special effect. It was a solid cake, but I have had better.

I absolutely loved their Macarons ($1.50). It all started with a crisp airy texture, followed by a soft chew and persistent flagrant ganache at the center. I have tried the Red Velvet, Pistachio, Chocolate Orange, Pumpkin Pie, Almond, Blueberry, and Coconut flavors. They were all striking, memorable, and the fruit flavors were particularly delectable. The textures and flavors on these Macarons were consistent on each of my previous visits. It never fails.

Each time the service was forward, efficient, and responsive. I find it helpful to communicate directly with the owner, as he is knowledgeable and always finds ways to meet my expectations. Eventually I'd like to order off the menu and try the Saint Honore Cake, Poppy Seed Bread, and other Macaron flavors.

I've never heard of Filipino-Mexican fusion.  (Filican?  Mexipino?  FiliMex?)  I joined friends Donald and Mark (Donark?  Monald?) here for a nice Friday lunch.

The folks here were friendly and hospitable (Fraspitable? Hofriendly?) when we came in and offered sample tastes of several dishes.  We tried chicken coconut curry, pork adobo, beef mechado and the special, roasted pork.  As in roasted pig.  A whole pig, roasted on site.  In my head I heard Christopher Walken blurt his patented "Wow."

Everything was tasty.  I went with a platter of two meats and garlic rice.  I chose the chicken coconut curry and the pork adobo.  The meats were tender and well sauced.   Savory and aromatic.  Savormatic?  Aromavory?

As we were finishing they brought over a slice of cassava cake, sliced for three.  Very sweet.  (The gesture and the cake.)  When we ordered I had asked if the cassava cake was similar to flan because it looked a bit like flan.  It's not.  It has more depth and texture and substantial vegetable flavor to it.  Good stuff.

I think Karey's gets 4 stars.  This is a place that could take their food to the 5 star level.  All of the dishes were really good but tasted like they were going for a milder, more mainstream version of the full bright flavor potential.  My advice is to keep doing what they are doing, only more.

Thanks to Preston's UYE at Lobbys, I now know the spot for a great burger in Tempe!

One of the things I love about Lobby's, its locally owned, and the owner takes pride in his shop!

After studying the menu for a minute I went with a cheeseburger & fries and was told to get some of that Lobby Sauce, I also heard that the Italian beef is the bombdiggity, I'll have to try that next time for sure. 

My burger was perfectly cooked! And it was messy too, but in a good way, everything on the burger tasted fresh too! Great flavor! The fries were delish too! Dip them in the Lobby Sauce and its game over! So good!

Glad to have tried Lobby Burger and plan on coming back soon!

This location is at the Las Vegas Premium Outlets (North) and has great deals going on. I didn't intend on coming here or even knew this store was here. After passing by I decided to step inside and check things out. The store was filled with customers as well several staff on hand to assist. The guy who helped me was very nice and helpful in getting me the sizes I wanted to try. I ended up getting 2 pairs on a BOGO deal and was pleased. They offer a variety of styles and colors and have sizes for the whole family.

Guys, do you have a problem approaching beautiful women?  Afraid of rejection?  No idea how to start a conversation without cheezy pickup lines?  Maybe you need to feel like a man again after being beaten down at the office or just want to feel like a 10 when ladies at the club call you a six?  Two words gents, Caf Teaze.

For less than half of what it cost for a dance, you can have all that plus a great milk tea.

To be clear, this is NOT a strip club!  Just a bunch of Asian ladies prancing around in their underwear doing everyday things.  You know, like serving tea and making conversation. Normal stuff.

About the conversations, it's slightly deeper than what you expect at the Rhino or Sapphire ("Where you from?  Really?  Me too!") but not by much.  They are however, experts at stroking your ego.  (Stop it, it's not a euphemism).

Before you go all sexist on me, I respect the servers for doing what they need to, to make a living. Tips, from what I gave, must be good and if you got it, use it.

Am I a fan of the concept?  No.  It reminds me of the countless bars in Shibuya Japan staffed by beautiful women who, for a metered rate, talk men into feeling better about themselves.  I guess it's cheaper than a shrink.  To each his own.

Almost forgot, the teas are good.  Brews are strong, especially the flavored teas (the Passion fruit black tea borders on bitter).  Milk teas can be ordered hot or cold.  Good ratio of tea to "milk".  Boba is well cooked.  tender throughout.  The hot taro milk tea is excellent.

I take the fifth and refuse to say anymore after all, what happens in Vegas...

Horrible Horrible Horrible!!!!!!

For a dedicated customer whose been loyal for over 10 years, I've never been more disappointed in an airline than JetBlue 

Our flight was scheduled to depart at 2:45 pm over the New Years weekend and while we were waiting in line to check in, our flight was suddenly cancelled due to inclement weather.  That's not all. The rescheduled flight wasn't set to leave until three whole days later! Holy moly, i had to get back to work! That being said, they made no attempt to accommodate me or pay for the inconvenience. No hotel, no taxi voucher or nothing. They did offer a refund if I didn't want to take the ridiculous flight that was leaving three days later. I think you can figure out the choice I made. The heavens were looking over me that day and I managed to nab a late flight leaving to LAX 8+ hours later that evening. 

I swore never again to fly JetBlue but when February came around, I had to make reservations for a business trip and because my Amex preferred airline was JetBlue, I just took the leap of faith. I flew out of long beach with no hassle but when it came time to flying back home, trouble was brewing yet again. 
This time, the flight gate was changed last minute without any changes made on the overhead flight monitors. I was chilling in the airport lounge and checking the monitors periodically, and there was no gate change announcement until I arrived at the gate to depart. To add insult to injury, they stated the 5pm flight was delayed until 7pm for maintenance issues. 2 hours later, they dropped the bomb on us and said the flight was cancelled. I scrambled again, just like I did in January to find another flight. Thankfully I found another flight with absolutely no help from JetBlue whatsoever. JetBlue emailed me and offered a 75$ credit towards my next flight. Hmmmmm, would you fly again with them when your flight was cancelled twice in less than 6 weeks? I think not. I tried calling and asking for a refund or reimbursement for all the inconveniences (ie having to find another flight same night, leaving at a much later time than my scheduled flight, no accommodations, driving from Santa Ana airport to long beach to get my car, etc) The rep responded with a resounding "No compensation, only 75$ credit towards another flight" I asked to speak to a supervisor, she again responded with "No"  I'm done with this airline and if you have any common sense, you should avoid them like the plague. Horrible service, no regard or consideration whatsoever for their customers and completely unreliable.

After visiting the Neon Museum, I wish I had a time machine to go back to the 1950's and '60's to see what old timey Las Vegas was like. No mega hotels/resorts, no football shaped drinks and no video poker in a bar. This was a time when people actually got dressed up to go to on a Vegas vacation 'cause gambling was a special occasion.

Such a cool exhibit and informative tour - guides take you through a curated maze of old, rusty neon signs (you can look, but don't touch!) and provide some interesting tidbits about Vegas history. As many have mentioned, it does take an hour or so and you must be escorted with an employee... no random wandering.

Plenty of photo opportunities, especially for those who love changing their social media profile pics on the regular. Though I don't think a camera phone could really do this place justice, as the signs are quite impressive and I'd rather take a mental picture to remember. 

And yes, this also doubles as an event space. I can only imagine how cool it looks at night with some of the working signs lit up! 

$18/person if you aren't a local. Worth the cost, as they're a 501(c)3 and your tour ticket is tax-deductible. Plus, it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see Vegas history.

I was very fortunate to be able to stay in one of the Caesars Palace Hotel's suites a few years ago. Not only was I taken back by their amazing hotel room, but their entire Rome themed property surrounded with beautiful pools, tall marble columns and life-like statues.  I've been coming to this hotel for years, and the atmosphere never ceases to amaze me.

The property boasts tons of restaurants from gourmet to casual dining including restaurants from famous well-known name chefs such as Bobby Flay, Gordon Ramsay, and Nobu Matsuhisa along with more casual family dining such as The Cheesecake Factory and Planet Hollywood.

They also have lots of gaming space, including an immense Race and Sports Book area where you can bet on your teams or just follow the action on one of their oversized flat screens or LED board.

You could also dive into one of their five spacious, elegant pools, enjoy some relaxation in their spa, indulge in a drink or two at one of their bars or see their live performance show with the famous Celine Dion singing her greatest hits.

Another reason I enjoy staying at this hotel is for the shopping found in their Forum Shops.  You can pick up the finest apparel, jewelry and other gifts there from stores like Banana Republic, Bebe, Bath and Body Works, Christian Louboutin, Coach, H & M, MAC Cosmetics and Tiffany.  They even have an Apple store!  Okay, so I only named a handful of MY favorites, but you get the point.  They've got everything!  I will definitely be back the next time I'm visiting Las Vegas!

Pinball for charity & fun too!

Are you a metal head? 
Does Captain Fantastic and The Brown Dirt Cowboy mean anything to you? 

If you answered YES or NO to any of these questions then you must go to the Pinball Hall of Fame!  Run, don't walk, driving is OK too. This is 5 ***** Star fun.

In an attempt to limit my time spent on slot machines and card tables, I yelped some alternate gaming fun and this place is at the top of the list for many good reasons. Thanks Tim S.

vintage games from the 70's (and earleir)  thru present. I was stoked to find a bunch of killer games from my youth. The only favorite I did not find was Evel Knievel, but it didn't matter 'cause I found all these gems, and many more. 

I've always been a fan of Rock & Roll and pinball games. Much love to PHOF!

Cap't Fantastic and The Brown Dirt Cowboy 1975 classic game!

But the coolest thing about this place is the owner Tim Arnold who has donated over $500,000.00 to the salvation Army and other local charities from the proceeds of the Pinball HOF. He is one righteous dude. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=fHHakES3UchMp8t11WI36Q&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw so bring your dollars and exchange them for quarters and tons of fun and help out those in need at the same time.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pinball-hall-of-fame-las-vegas?select=Joz7Y64GdxAcDL_tu59kWA#Joz7Y64GdxAcDL_tu59kWA

Booked the Penthouse and all i can say is....WOW!!!!

The panoramic view of the strip from the corner Penthouse was breathtaking and the spacious rooms were elegant, modern & clean.  The beds you ask? Nice and firm, just the way i like it! Flat screens in every room. What's next? the toilet? lol
Oh, and the fully automated shades and daily "turn down" service was pretty impressive, too!
  
Throughout my weekend stay, service was on point and the hotel staff didn't miss a beat.  Even on my last day, they provided complimentary limousine service to the airport!  Very swank.

My only complaint would be that my darn ears kept popping as I rapidly ascended the elevator to the 54th floor.  But hey the view from that soaring height was worth a few annoying pops in my ear and luckily after a couple of days, i adjusted ;)  

The spa at the hotel was also clean, contemporary and most importantly, relaxing. They had all the facilities i've come to expect from a fine resort hotel spa (i.e. TV lounge with refreshments, expansive fitness room, jacuzzi & whirlpool, steam room, and sauna.  

Located inside the newly built City Center, this smoke free & eco-friendly hotel is within walking distance to all the local hotspots, dining, and entertainment on the main strip.
If you're looking for a relaxing recovery after a night of complete decadence, this just might be your ticket to paradise.

Happy Times!

Gorgeous pool where the mermaids play. It's such an idyllic setting with the cascading waterfalls and calm waters. Add an alcoholic beverage to complete the picture and you're all set. Relax in this beautiful scene or meet some fun people to party with. Anything's fair game in Vegas, after all!

There are plenty of lounge chairs if you just want to kick back and recover from a long night. Grab a towel and catch some sun. Make sure to wear sunblock anytime you're outside in Las Vegas. The desert sun will own you. Guaranteed.

If you've napped long enough, take your drink with you into the pool and meet some highly interesting folks. You know how it is. When everyone's drinking, anyone can become your new friend.

So whether you're seeking the water nymph of your dreams or just have some fun, this is the place to be!

DATE TIP: The huge waterfall may *seem* like a nice romantic idea, but it's NOT romantic to piggyback someone right under the waterfall's force and just stand there forever. Once you get to the other side though, it becomes a private oasis.

We stayed here a couple of months ago for our Vegas Getaway because we heard good things.

It is generally a good hotel casino off the strip about 10 minutes drive from the strip.  The property is huge!  They have a bowling alley and movie theatre in the building.  They have a good variety of restaurants.  We got to try Steak & Shake which was really good cheap eats.

The room was very spacious and clean.  We had no problems with the room.  The bathroom was huge & had a great shower.  The bed was very comfortable.  We got a pretty good deal on our rooms to boot.

One thing to note was there were lots of older folks at this hotel.  Not your typical Vegas hotel.

They have self & valet parking.  We normally parked ourselves in the front parking facing the hotel.

Thanks to some friends coming into town I got to check out The Westin Kierland Resort, what a great looking place! Very grand.

Room 2163 was the spot, and I have to say I was sort of shocked because it was on the small side; the bathroom had a shower stall  for one, not even a bathtub. 

There was a nice size king bed that was comfy. My friends brought their dogs with them and the resort does provide kennels, food bowls and even a heavenly doggy pillow for them to sleep on, I thought that was pretty sweet.  The doors opened up to a outside seating area next to the lush green grass.  The room also had a desk, comfy love seat, mini bar, a mini sink & counter top, just over all was a very small room. 

Check out 2 of the pool areas, one where the lazy river is at, posted everywhere it says the lazy river is opened till 7, but we went for it around 6:30 and we were told it was already closed.  This pool area closed at 8pm but we just walked across and went to the pool that's opened 24 hours and hung out there. 

Over all enjoyed my time at the Westin Kierland, looking forward to booking a staycation soon!

He confidently pushed the menu to the edge of the table with a hand calloused, wrinkled and bent by time and years of hard work fixing cars and pushing brooms. "I don't need the menu. I have been coming here for 30 years and they have the best chicken fried steak I have had in my life."

"Hey, I know better than to doubt you, grandpa." replied the young man with the same face, minus 40 years and 30 lbs but with the benefit of an extra 4 inches in height.

The old man ordered a lemonade to wash it down and the kid took a sweet tea, both ariving in giant plastic cups that reminded the kid, now nearly 30 of his childhood summers spent with his family in El Paso,Texas with his father's family who had moved with the army from Mississippi many years before he was born but brought the traditions of cooking for taste and comfort and damned be anyone for telling them it wasn't healthy.

They sat quietly, tired from a morning of moving furniture into the young man's new home, reading the signatures on the wall. The old man pointed out and explained who some of the old-timers were, mostly polititians and actors who, while big in their day, were not legendary enough to cary into the vernacular of pop culture 30 years later, and the young man pointing out and explaining the athletes and musicians of his era.

The waiter dropped off their chicken fried steaks along with their sides: Red beans, rice with gravy, greens and potatoes. They grinned in acknowledement of having made the right choices and began to eat.

"You know, her son opened a chicken and waffle place not too far from here." ther kid said, "but you are right; this place is better. Thanks for your help today grandpa."

"As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster." - Henry Hill in Goodfellas (and secretly most guys watching the movie)

The Mob Museum was better than expected (3.5 stars), but, at $20/person, not exactly an offer you can't refuse. Here's what Wise Guys know:

 * Open 10:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. (8:00 p.m. Fri/Sat)
 * Adult: $20; Child (10-17): $14; Under 10: Free; Seniors/Military: $16; 
 * Nevada Residents can save $6 ... so $14 and $10
 * $30 Tickets for 2 Museums available: Neon Museum plus Mob Museum
 * Parking Lot next to Mob Museum is $5 ... or use a downtown casino lot & walk
 * Located inside the historic (1933) Las Vegas Federal Courthouse & Post Office
 * The self-guided tour takes a couple hours and covers 3 floors
 * The Mob Museum shows how Prohibition led to the expansion of the Mafia
 * The real wall from the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago is there
 * Exhibits cover legends Al Capone, Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel
 * Also Sam Giancana, Lefty Rosenthal, Mickey Cohen, John Gotti, & Whitey Bulger
 * The FBI & government get props for their battle against the mafia
 * Weapons, crime scene pics, and mob stories are everywhere
 * Lots of photographs of real mobsters and stories of their "real" families
 * The history of Las Vegas in the pictures/displays was very interesting to me
 * There's as much memorabilia of Las Vegas as there is for La Costa Nostra
 * Original casino/bar photos were fascinating; my how far Vegas has come
 * Liked displays on connections between mob families in different U.S. cities
 * One floor is dedicated to the actual Courtroom used for a Kefauver Hearing in 1950
 * Of course, Mob Movies are highlighted/celebrated, too.
 * No food/beverages, professional cameras, or large bags ... and no weapons
 * Small Mob Museum Gift Shop had some friendly people working there

At times, the Mob Museum feels like a romanticized Hall of Fame for organized criminals and law enforcement catching them. Because it is relatively modern, many of the displays keep your attention. It's not in the "must-visit" category for a Vegas vacation or weekend, but if you're tired of the casinos, clubs, shows, and action on the Las Vegas Strip then you may consider the Mob Musuem to "see what everyone's not talking about."

Recognize the chef?  Bravo's Top Chef contestant, consulted for XXX, worked at world class YYY, Michelin Chef ZZZ says he's "the greatest thing since boiled chicken".  Celebrity chef or otherwise, food must speak for itself.

Dishes are artfully presented.  Portions are very small for the price.  Flavors run from boring to interesting to "delicious but" to bizarre.  Examples:

Watermelon salad with goat cheese, a classic, is very refreshing but could benefit from a drizzle of aged balsamic to boost sweetness and complexity.  The hint of wasabi does nothing.  The watermelon lacked the "in season" fruity goodness.  Boring.

Quinoa fried rice with sun dried pineapple and tofu is intriguing.  Good first bite but unless you are a quinoa lover, the texture of the and nutty flavor of the grain quickly becomes one dimensional.  The pineapple lacks the acidic punch to brighten the dish.  Interesting.

The roasted duck breast is delicious.  Perfectly cooked, mid rare.  Mineral duck flavors enhanced by the honey.  A great side of grilled baby bok choy to add bitterness and crunch.  Just be sure to scrape off the ridiculous addition of children's breakfast cereal.   Blood soaked Kix.  Really?  Delicious but.

Miso toffee ice cream.  Wait for it.... Disgusting.  The first bite is good,  but with each successive bite, the miso flavor builds to the point your brain tells you not to swallow.  Fermented ice cream.  Bizarre.

Very small selection of micro brews.  Nice selection of sake.  High off Strip prices.

Bottom line, the food is not for everyone.  There are many better options for more globally accepted creativity.  You're better off looking to the Strip for excellence.

Yes, Four Stars.

Actually Qdoba is pretty close to Chipotle in taste and setup (see photos).  You get in line, tell them either Burrito or Taco, what beans, onions, guacamole, et cetera you want, and before you know it you are enjoying a flavorful meal.

I found Qdoba is trying very hard to stay relevant in a very crowded "fast casual Mexican food" segment. and seems doing a good job and business.  I came here a few weeks ago on a whim and enjoyed myself.  It was around 2 pm and they were just recovering from a busy lunch crowd.

I believe some of the pluses that standout from that visit is the diversity of the food menu and variety of choices when you are ordering.  One example is their Queso.  Yes they have it and it's as delicious as anything you can make in your microwave at home. LOL

So Four Stars and "Yay! I'm a fan."

Enjoy!

I had my first taste of the Capistrami in Vegas and was so excited they opened a location in Beverly Hills, but after coming to this new location, i am reminded that i still like the set up in Vegas the best. 
It feels alot more family run and friendly here.
Place your order first with the cooks, grab your drinks out the fridge and chips to munch on, and pay at the register. Be generous and give them tip for their Beer Fund! 

I've enjoyed the Bobbie and the Slaw Be Jo, (the philly is too spicy for me), but i still love their Capistrami the best. This time we got a 20 inch of that, and 12 inch roast beef Slaw Be Jo. They have tastykakes here, which i have yet to try and i love their potato chip selection. 

If ur tired of buffet gorging or don't have enough money left to keep splurging, and had enough of Sonics, I def recommend trying their pastrami!

This used to be called "The Gift of Lights" at Sunset Park, but has a new name and home. The now "Glittering Lights" at Las Vegas Motor Speedway was fun and free for a 2nd year thanks to yelp. There were a lot more cars this year compared to last year. It seemed like there were a few more lights up this year, but pretty much the same light displays just put up in a different spot. The difference I notice here at the speedway vs. susnet park is there is a lot more space for lights. I just wish they filled it all up! It's too bad more businesses don't get involved and set up a light display where it's dark. There is a sign at the gate telling you which radio station you can listen to while you drive through. I enjoyed munching on popcorn and hot chocolate that were for sale by the Boy Scouts at the entrance and seeing all the pretty lights :)

Downtown Pizza Lounge is a nice place to pop into if you're looking for a quick slice of pizza.  The basic set-up is that there are 6-8 varieties of pizza daily, and once you choose the type you it is reheated in the oven for you.  On the day we stopped in, the fresh pies were coming out of the oven so we were able to have fresh pizza, versus the reheated version.  Slices were good, and they have a few different lunch specials to choose from.  If we had gotten slices that had been reheated, I don't think they would have held up so well.   So like most other things in life, timing is everything.

The menu is fairly limited, with buffalo wings and house salads being the only other options.  But if you're in need of a quick pizza fix, go for whichever variety is coming fresh out of the oven and you'll leave pleased.  Overall, closer to 3.5 stars.  Three if you get reheated, four if you catch them fresh.

Disinterested servers with their noses held high.
The Sommelier had a stick shoved so high up his butt he could barely make sense. Insisting we could not bring in a bottle of wine if it was on the wine list. We told him that we had already checked and it was not on their wine list.  He checked (more than once) and couldn't find it on the list. He finally gave in.  The bottle of Lodi Gluttony 2006 Old Vine Zinfandel was the bottle we brought for this occasion. We had every intention of ordering a second bottle from their list. But as it turns out we didn't want to spend any more time at Bouchon than we needed to. It was NOT the way to start a Birthday dinner.... Or any dinner for that matter.     
The Food   
The scallops were amazing according to my Grandson 
The sausage (Boudin Blac) ordered by my Grandaughter, didn't seem to impress her
Son-In-laws salad nicoise was not what he expected. Seems it was more of a tuna salad on lettuce. But he said it tasted good 
The Roasted Leg of Lamb was not memorable -literally 
The beautifully presented Pork chop Delmonico was tasty, but way to tough to chew.
The best thing was Son-in-laws first course of a micro greens that seem to have a light sprinkling of a Nutty Gremolata and topped with deep fried calamari rings. I'm having a hard time getting that salad out of my mind. I'll have to try my hand at making it, because I won't be back to Bouchon.
Snobbery makes good food taste bad. 

Sheesh, I can't believe I put on high heels for this.

I've stayed at Mandalay Bay twice and been to shows, dinner, or gamble several times and it is a solid 4-stars ... a notch below the elite of Vegas and a step above the mediocre. It's large with the full Vegas experience under one roof if you aren't wanting to explore ... with multiple pools, a plethora of restaurants, the Michael Jackson show, other concerts, standard shopping, and, of course, a casino. Resort is a better name for Mandalay Bay than hotel.

The rooms aren't elite opulence, but they are nice with functional, yet cozy furniture and large bathrooms. If you can afford it, be sure to upgrade to one of the upper floors because the views of the Las Vegas Strip are better from there. Since Mandalay Bay is currently near the South end of the Strip, rooms with a view facing north/east will be the best. The location is also really close to the airport and 15 freeway.

Overall, Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino is a solid option when visiting Vegas. If you get a good deal on a room or are looking for a one-stop shop for a large group with diverse needs then I definitely recommend Mandalay Bay.

FOOD POISONING

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, especially after being a huge fan of this place. But 3 out of 4 people in our dinner party Tuesday night ate the hamburger sliders. My fiance..who has an iron stomach had a little stomach ache Wednesday night, but my friend and I at about 2 am both were doubled over in severe pain and I finally went to urgent care. All symptoms I have been experiencing point to E Coli...if I am wrong on that its still definitely food poisoning bad enough I was put on antibiotics and told not to return to work until Monday (I work in a kitchen and its health code) besides I barely still have enough energy to walk my dog let alone work. I have lost 600.00 in wages due to this and been completely miserable. I called the restaurant and they were very apologetic and tried to be accomodating saying they would take care of us the next time we came in...but I am still out basically a whole months rent because one of their cooks didn't abide by proper cooking procedures and health codes. I am worried how many other people are sick from them this week and IF Firefly did in fact take the sliders off the menu until they could investigate the situation as they told me. Please contact me if you see this and were also hit with a case of food poisoning or better yet contact the health department. If FIREFLY is resolving their situation and fixing this then they wont have a problem with the health department. But if they disregard this issue then more people could be at danger which is why they must be contacted. More than 2 cases of food poisoning from the same item on the same day is considered an outbreak...I have 3 cases already. Lets protect our tourists so they want to come back. I promise that if I find out they have fixed and followed proper procedure I will update my yelp and encourage people to go back but for now I just cant.

"You better cut the pizza in four pieces because I'm not hungry enough to eat six."   Yogi Berra

Nothing beats a cheesy deep-dish pizza with all your beloved toppings.  That original pan crust is crazy delicious.  It's always busy here for a reason.  I personally love the BBQ Chicken.  If you grab it to go, make sure you toss some fresh cilantro on top for even more flavor.  Their wings are also incredible and they even throw some Parmesan on top of the Garlic Parmesan Wings for more cheesy-goodness.  Nello's pies are flavorful and packed full of calories so if you're on a diet, leave it outside and indulge.  This 30+ year-old award-winning establishment is made of love.

I think of dieting for the new year and then I eat Nello's pizza.  No shame.  No regrets.

Partied too hard?  You know, dinner, ultra lounge, casino gaming for pre-gaming, a club, an after hours club.  Mobile filled with numbers of people called "the hot one", "the hot hot one", "the hottest one".  Enter Japanese Curry Zen; cure for a hangover and tragically lighter money clip.

The dish is simple.  Rice with plain curry topped with mostly deep fried goodies.

Ordering:
1.  Choose the size:  small $3.75, regular $5.95, or extra rice plus $1.00.
2.  Choose the heat level (this is Japanese not Thai.  J-Level 10 = T-Level 4 AND the taste is altered).
3.  Select toppings (braised beef, chicken, pork or tofu katsu, deep fried shrimp, potato croquette, or vegetables); $2.00 - $6.50.
4.  Done.

Typical Japanese curry (viscous, vegetable base with a complex, aromatic blend of Indian spices and a gentle heat).  No coconut milk, no painful chilies in the mix.  Everyday quality short grain white or brown rice.  The braised beef, tender, fall apart goodness.  The fried items, crunchy on the outside, correctly cooked on the inside.  The veg, cooked to death, very soft and lending their flavor to the mix.  A single order of any topping is enough to fill most up.  Typical offering of pickled veg and raisins at the table.

Multiple visits, very consistent.

A simple meal, done right.

The night is hot and sticky. The streets of old town have an eerily abandoned feeling as we realize it's 9pm on a Friday night and we are the only pedestrians around. Even in a sundress and sandals, I feel my skin glow with perspiration. After a bit of wandering, we realize we might be lost when I see a corridor lined with vines and trellises and my intuition and sense of adventure tells me to follow it. I grab his hand and lead the way blindly. He begins questioning my decision when I see a mysterious wooden door and before he can finish objecting we realize we found our way to the truth within. 

We step inside and it feels like we found the closet that leads to Narnia. We walk into another world. Another time. Relaxed sounds of jazz caress our ears as our eyes adjust to the darkness and candlelight. We take in the old world feel, the stone, the wood, the beautiful sleek bar...that seems to be beckoning us to sit. Couples and groups of friends absorbed in each other on cushy couches and stools all with a sense of privacy and feeling that there is no world outside of this place and there is no moment other than now. His eyes meet mine and we know this is exactly where we want to be.

As we settle in at the bar, helpful suggestions are ready when we ask. He orders for me, as only seems appropriate in this mysterious and romantic era. Pinot Noir, Cabernet, plates of pt, soppressata, brie, stilton white with cherries. I can taste the pure indulgence dripping off the mere words as they leave his mouth. The wine flows and the food is plentiful. Every sip, every bite, is something to savor and worthy of noting. Our conversation, whispers of love and beauty in each other's ears, lips close enough for a kiss. Knowledge of another world, remembrances of anyone else is lost as we fall under the spell that is Kazimierz. 

When the night is over and we have no choice but to go back to where we came from, we reluctantly step back out into the warm, heavy night air greeted by sounds of traffic and rickshaw drivers ringing their bells. But as we leave, we take with us a secret. A sexy, decadent, mysterious secret that lies behind an old wooden door in the heart of old town. 

The only way to discover that secret is to seek out that door and enter it yourself.

Not counting price I like this store and the service. 
My favorite, a fellow I call Scotsman the meat counter man. I don't know if this gentleman is from Scotland or not, but his language reminds me of one I know. But the key distinguishing factor for him is his superb service and great attitude. He is just  short of your personal butcher. He takes his time with you, and he does not rush you on. Listens, gives advice and is extremely helpful. When necessary he will look in the back to satisfy your request . He alone could keep me coming back. Oh, and also the meat counter is excellent overall. Great selection,  and good cuts.
What else, well the cheese section is outstanding, the prepared foods are plentiful and tasty. I like the baked goods also. Another nice feature is you can eat right there, which I do sometimes so I don't food shop when starving, which always costs me more somehow.

This event was held at La Grand Orange.  This was an easy location to go to for shopping for me.  I go to LGO often enough and love their cookies.  I arrived at 5:30 on the dot.  Yelp had a table setup for "shoppers" who checked-in to pick-up their check-in offer sweet treat - for me, it was the mini-red-velvet cupcake.  I dropped off my cleaning supplies that I purchased for the Ronald McDonald House at the table.  We also received a sweet ticket to get a cup of hot chocolate and an invitation to try out the new restaurant in the LGO family that is located across the street.

I ordered food and sat in the dining room.  I ate dinner and then went back to check out the offerings that LGO has.  I previously wrote a review about LGO.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix#hrid:gx2aCOeK4UAv7h2_jBB3Ag

Besides the food (salads, sammies, desserts), you can get an eclectic variety of games, coffee mugs and various other trinkets in the store.  Here are the links to the pics I took of the things in their store a few months ago.

I enjoy shopping local.  I co-organize a supper club UYE that almost exclusively supports locally owned restaurants and I usually eat at local places.  When I can, I do like to give my business to locally owned farmers and grocers.  Thanks to Lindsey and LGO for the invite to join. I am hopeful that next week's shop local will introduce me to more stores in the Phoenix area that interest me.

I honestly believe that clubs are only fun and enjoyable if YOU make it that way. With that being said, Pure sucks, but my girlfriends and I managed to make it fun and enjoyable for us.

We knew one of the promoters, so we got in for free. I think that's the ONLY good thing about that night. Sad, I know.

Let's list out some of the reasons why Pure was a huge disappointment.

1. The bouncers are beyond rude (more than usual). 
2. I don't get it, why did we have to wait in line when we were on the guestlist? Someone please enlighten me.
3. There was no room to even breathe on the first floor, let alone dance -_-
4. The crowd is a lot older than I had anticipated.
5. Pure attracts MORE creepers than other clubs I've been to. I seriously felt like I was being raped by this one perv on the dance floor.

Pure, it was nice knowing ya, but let's just end it here. Don't want to come back to you ever again.

This marathon has gotten a bad rap. 

I have many friends & co-workers who have run the Rock n' Roll marathons in other cities. Most of them would probably unanimously agree that the Vegas is the one of the worst. Their opinions are ones I trust. 

This was my 3rd year running the half. Is it chaotic? Yes. Disorganized? Expensive entry? Yep. Would I run it again? Absolutely. So if it's so bad, why am I giving it 4 stars? It's just that fun!

When I read the other reviews to see what most people hated, don't get me wrong, they are legitimate complaints. What's my biggest suggestion if you're reading this, thinking of running it for the first time or trying it again next year? READ THE EMAIL. They send runners a final informational email to explain everything, showing maps of where to park to explaining where families can reunite with the marathoners they finish. Is everything strictly enforced, like the corralling? No. Do they have the best course support? Probably not. But a lot of the headaches can be avoided by reading your email and planning ahead. If you race, you know - something always unexpected happens on Race Day!

There's nothing like running down the Strip at night. I'm going to run other cities in the future and enjoy it for what they offer. This is what we offer and I just appreciate that we can hold something so unique. It's one of many things that makes Vegas... VEGAS!  That's just me, take it for what it's worth. I have fun and if you run it, you can make it a blast, too!

Every now and then I iron my clothes, brush my hair, and rock the high heels. But even when I do that, it's highly unlikely that you'll find me at Pure or Tryst or LAX or any other of the one word clubs on the strip. 

Here's where The Cosmopolitan comes in: I didn't stay here, but I can still get dressed up and feel like I'm being one of those girls, but I don't have to go to a club. They have two (maybe more, but at least two) really cool bars. You don't need table service. You don't need to have 80% ladies to get in. You don't have to pay a cover. They are just awesome bar/lounges.

Vesper, near the entrance is cool, but The Chandelier Bar was the real stunner. It's all schmancy, but the cocktails are about $10-$12, which isn't absolutely horrible for a schmancy joint. The service could be better, but they've got some interesting cocktails and the decor is just - AMAZING.

Excalibur is the "bang for your dollar" hotel located on the strip. It's not the nicest looking, doesn't have the most amenities or the most up to date decor.

It gives you the opportunity to be on the Vegas strip at a cheaper price compared to other hotels. If you come with kids or have a big family you are traveling with then Excalibur will offer you value in staying in Vegas.

I had a bad experience with my check in where I was offered a free upgrade offering the pool view and adjacent rooms where we could open the doors to each other's rooms. Neither of those happened and we were too exhausted from the drive to complain or change rooms. 

The pool was great for the kids. They have a single slide there for kids and adults. They have a VIP pool as well. Drinks are expensive, as you would probably imagine. We ordered a bucket with 5 beers and it cost $30.

I would stay here again and here is why: I come here to walk around Vegas, not sit in my room. I don't care to pay for an expensive hotel that I come to sleep in.

Solid divey neighborhood bar - I like this place.  Very affordable, not so big that you feel like you're swimming in it on a slow Monday night, and yet it's not too small that it felt jam-packed on a recent Friday night, either.  I need to check out the jukebox prices, they're apparently variable which for some reason always makes me clench up a little when I approach with my cash in hand. 

I'm pretty amazed at the girls they have working here - I've only ever seen some lovely ladies behind the bar.  That's worth a bunch of extra points for sure.  The air conditioning works janky, and everything from the carpet to the bar stools to the leather padding on the bar is pretty worn down, but it's still a cool place that i'm sure i'll be going back to again and again in the future.  

The beers on tap, the quality of the bathroom, and the huge smoking patio put this place over the top - 5 stars.  Dive bar heaven.

This review is NSFW (Not Safe For Work). You might just end up reading it, calling in sick, *cough*, *cough*, catching a ride (cab, light rail, uber, lyft, friend, bicycle, skateboard, roller skates, shoes, or slippers) and spending your day at Hanny's instead.

Hanny's has a special place in my heart. Oh, Hanny's. You're close enough to my house to be an easy light rail destination, and just far enough for me to stay away most of the time. "Dangerous curves ahead" doesn't even begin to cover the tepidness one should take while ordering your $5 martini's, especially when you order them on the rocks, in a tumbler glass, and a couple of limes to dress it up instead. Your $5 martini special is always special and that's just why I like you, you make every hour happy and not just the hours between 3pm and 6pm ;-)

The one complaint I hear from most people and many reviews is that at Hanny's, there's no Happy Hour, I think you just have to know to order their $5 martinis. I generally consider happy hours to be happy only when they come coupled with a decent drink selection AND food selection, but those martini's, they make up for it.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, set your limit at two, possibly even one, be sure you've got a DD and have the happiest of hours.

The lovely Sarah G decided to bless me w her awesome presence for lunch this afternoon. I am so glad we decided on this lovely House of Tricks! Does anyone know why its called that?!?! I'm curious please tell me??!?! Soooo this should really be 4.5 stars as everyone has said the service was a bit slow. A lot of places down here in Tempe seem that way to me. For some weird reason or another I feel like I enter the Twilight Zone and the waiters dont seem to have a need for time. Maybe they teach this course at ASU or maybe everyones just stoned, IDK!?!?! 

The soup of the day was some carrot ginger thing with creme it did not taste like carrots at all whatsoever but it was super delicous and I dont even like ginger haha!! Sarah took a pic of the salad I had. I had the best salad EVER!!! Moroccan Fruit and Chicken Shawarma Salad with Mango, Melon, Strawberries, Oranges, Toasted Pine Nuts, Citrus Cous Cous and Baby Field Greens with Preserved Lemon Vinaigrette. I substituted the chicken for some Tombo Ahi it was a few dollars more but OH SOOO WORTH IT!! Abso-fucking-lutely YUM-GASMIC!! The chef here is a fucking genius and I will never have enough of this place.....EVER! Where is Gordon Ramsey when you need him to light a fire under your server's ass to get the tables turned around quicker?? 

I will surely bring all out of towner's here for dinner and do more special occasions here in the future. Wine tasting is on Tuesdays I better move closer!! So when are we going?!?!?

I was about to start a new weight lost challenge, but knew before that was to start I wanted something sweet and good!  I was in the area for lunch and saw that there was this sweet looking bakery at the end of the shopping center, so I knew that's where I was headed to!

I ordered the Salted Carmel Mocha cupcake to go, just from looking at it I was already drooling! You could clearly see the salt crystals on the top of the drizzled caramel!  Its my new craving, salty/sweet! Can't get enough it!

Got back to work and got to try it out! Let me tell you! The cake part of the cupcake was amazing! It was a moist chocolate with chocolate chucks inside! Yes!! Chucks!!! Yummy!!! The frosting, omg, you get a nice blend of mocha, caramel and salt!! OMG HEAVEN!!!!  This was a perfect cupcake for me!

Also for you ice cream lovin fools (I'm more of cake brownie person) they serve thrifty ice cream, I remember back in the day, that was the bomb ice cream!!  And if you have a crazy sweet tooth, they also have for sale shoots of frosting!!! Forget the cake and go straight to the sweet stuff!!!

It truly pains me to have to write this review of what I would otherwise consider an excellent establishment, but recent events prevent me from recommending this restaurant to anyone.

Yes, this may be a bit of a rant, so in an attempt to be balanced, let me offer a little perspective.

Pizzeria Bianco was one of the first places that I ate at when I moved to Phoenix earlier this year. The food is very good. The service is good, but I was immediately aware that the business model is very flawed, in that I have never waited for less than 90 minutes for a table. It is true that you can pass the time quickly in the adjacent wine bar, and I have done so on many occasions. The wine selection is above average, and the environment is pleasant.

However, the business manager (owner Chris Bianco's ex-wife) is a truly miserable human being (ask any of her employees), and her imprint on the approach to customer service at the restaurant is unmistakable. The management believes that there is absolutely no incentive to provide anything resembling an enjoyable experience for their patrons because there are unlimited numbers of people who will wait upwards of 4 hours for their signature wood-fired pizzas.

As a fan of excellent food, I do appreciate their attention to detail and excellent craft. But the consistent manner in which I see loyal customers disrespected and outright abused is completely unacceptable.

While I do love their pizza and antipasto (which is not, irreplaceable I might add), after many months of consistent patronage, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Small little mom & pop restaurant; if you're going to come here with a big group then you might have to wait. 

Great place to come after a night of partying & clubbing on the LV strip where you know you're trying to get over a hangover hahaha.. =)

Noodles were very tasty & Yummy...5 stars

Pad keep Mao: Not greasy / oily but yummy 4 stars

Pad Thai so so yummy & tatsty noodles were awesome 5 stars

Papaya Salad yummy & had a spicy kick to it. 4 stars

Thai Tea: yummy & thirst quenching 4 stars

Food: A - (Portions are generous, but to go orders are very small) 

Don't order to go because the portions that they give in their to go orders are so so much smaller than when you sit down & eat inside the restaurant. -1

Service: B-  (can be a bit slow)

Decor: A - (interesting giant mural on the wall for you to check out while you eat) =)

We came here for a cup of coffee and decided to order some eggs and bacon. Clearly bacon is their strong suit and the coffee was really very good as well.

I decided to come back the next day and see if yesterday was a fluke. Since we generally liked our original visit over a year ago but at the time we found things somewhat uneven.

Well the good news to report is that since my first visit with fellow Yelp'ers and Pepper Head Mark, things have improved. Service can be a bit slow during busy periods, they have definitely improved. The sad sausage I had eighteen months ago has been retired. It's been replaced by a very flavorful one (see photos).

Today we ordered the French Toast and the Oink's French Toast. The latter is just over the top sweet and a bit too much for this gourmand. While the regular French Toast would be enjoyed by every Gourmet as being just right. Look that up in your Roget's. LOL

Expect to pay $15 each if you don't order a 4 piece (1/2 flight) or 8 piece (full flight) of their absolutely delicious thick flavored bacon. If you do, and I would recommend that you do, then expect to pay accordingly, around $22-$25.  But ohhh, but it's sooo worth it!

Enjoy!

My four years at Arizona State University (2003-2007) were some of the most interesting times of my life - during this time I made some amazing friends, grew tremendously as a person, and even spent about three years working for the University (and absolutely loving it for the most part). Why then, might you wonder, am I giving ASU such a low rating?

Simple.

The quality of education is lacking at best, and laughable at worst. Granted, my experience is going to be different than someone who majored in the hard sciences, law, business, engineering, or any of Michael Crow's other pet projects. I had the misfortune of dual-majoring in Psychology and Women's Studies, both areas of study that fall under the Liberal Arts. 

The University, by the way, refused to confer my Women's Studies degree because the numerous advisers I met with neglected to tell me that I had missed the cutoff deadline by about a semester. So, despite doing all the work and finishing my thesis, I was awarded a minor, alongside an invitation to take fifteen completely unnecessary credits to get my second degree. When translated to cold, hard, cash, that comes out to the tune of ~$9,000. 

In the end I decided to forget about the second major - an undergraduate degree in the Liberal Arts from ASU isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Do not take this to mean however, that good professors don't exist - I've met plenty of fantastic professors during my time at ASU, but I also saw a number of them leave, disgusted by Crow's vision for the college. 

As an employee, I got to see the ASU that a lot of students don't - I had the opportunity to talk to many professors at staff meet and greets who simply couldn't deal with what they'd come to refer to as "bureaucratic bull****". I've talked to no less than half a dozen professors who left, tired of frustrating tenure requirements, narrow minded research-oriented policies, and uneven allocation of educational funding. So, really, it's not just the students-at-large that are treated like second-class citizens at the university. The teachers present get their fair share of abuse too. 

In addition to the education, there are a host of other things wrong with ASU - astronomical parking prices, overemphasis on new dorms, mandatory meal plans (for on-campus students anyway), and terrible student/alumni support, to name a few. 

Make no mistake about it. Michael Crow's ASU couldn't care less about the quality of education that you receive at this "university". If you want to get the best education your money get get you, look elsewhere.

Buying a Westgate timeshare was the biggest mistake I've ever made. Every other bad choice in my life has at least ended up leading me somewhere better or helped me to become a better person down the road, but not the timeshare. This bad decision sucked a ton of money out of me and continues to do so for maintenance and taxes every year, and I haven't gotten ANYTHING out of it except for years worth of scam artists cold-calling me to get MORE money out of me to supposedly sell it - a scam that probably works a lot with Westgate owners because having this $#@! timeshare is such a MISERABLE experience. EVERY time I have tried to use my timeshare, there has been something new pop out of the woodwork. "Oh sorry, that resort will be an extra $1000 fee because it's ski season." "Oh sorry, that resort, and that one, and that one, and yes, those other ones, are all full." "Oh sorry, there's a new rule at Planet Hollywood now where you have to bank your week by September 30th of the previous year or it's gone until 2014. Yes, we know that Westgate used to allow you to use it in off-years, but we're Hilton now. Tough luck." 

We were promised easy booking, plenty of availability, lots of choices for resorts, a big grand opening party when PH opened... nothing. I've had none of that. The timeshare presentation was smoke and mirrors, and now I own a worthless so-called "vacation" package I have not been able to actually use ONCE in 4 years. And I've been paying over $650 in taxes every year for the privilege of NOT actually going on vacation.

DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT let these scam artists suck you in. If only I had read reviews before signing that paper. If only.

I have been to Turf twice now.. 

Once for breakfast .. I got your typical English breakfast, cant say it was the best ive ever had, or memorable for that matter, but it was alright. My bloody Mary was good, but I swear the second one only had half a shot of vodka in it.. and if im wrong I am sorry, but I could only taste Mary mix. As my friend put it, the bartender was a "charisma vacuum".. and yes, I didn't catch his name, but he wasn't cool at all. They had various sports teams playing on all the TV's, which is great if youre into that. 

Second time I came I was with a group of extremely inebriated people.. and I FELL ASLEEP at the bar. I did not get kicked out, so 2 cool points for that.. I still cannot believe myself and how I got away with that I do not know. Either way, I remember a lot of weird shit going on, and everyone I saw, for the most part, was laughing. 

I have nothing bad to say about Turf, but I also have nothing to rave about. If you're hungry or want a drink and are in this neighborhood, try it out for yourself, and try to stay awake. Its a little embarrassing when you don't.

Who would have thought I'd find myself downtown at a rundown casino like Palace Station, but there I was on a late Sunday night enjoying one of the most satisfying dishes sin city had to offer! 

Yup, I'm talkin about the Pan Roast at Oyster Bar! 

Do yourself a huge favor and order the palace version with shrimp chicken andouille sausage and crab. I added lobster too. But either way, It's the bomb, cuz its all about that crazy good sauce! Keep in mind however, to truly enjoy this dish, you've gotta love your spice! Trust, each bite will be a scorching spoonful of fiery goodness! Chunks of meaty sausage, chicken and seafood in every bite and I bet you won't be able to put your spoon down! Well, except to wipe your forehead from the sweat cuz this bad boy is hot hot hot! But oooh soooo hot diggity good! I ordered a level 7 (1-10 being spiciest) and it was just right!

We started with 1/2 a dozen oysters on the half shell, and that was an excellent intro to our fantastic meal! The oysters were fresh and went down the hatch nicely with a swig of cold frosty Kirin! 

We also ordered the shrimp scampi. It came served with loads of succulent tiger shrimp, a heaping serving of fresh chopped garlic and noodles swimming in a pool of buttery glory. Although it was tasty, it simply couldn't hold a candle to the signature pan roast IMO! 

I'm tellin ya, order the pan roast and enjoy! Your taste buds and tummy will thank you for it!

Happy Eats!

The reason I stay at the MGM Grand is that I'm familiar with it. 
Things I like
Housekeeping is friendly and efficient
Great view of the strip from most rooms 
The Studio Caf for breakfast- Best Lox ever! 
Many really good restaurants 
Maintenance crew responds well.
Photos of yesteryears stars hanging on the walls-Wow did they know how to dress. 

Things I don't like
Horrible water pressure- unfixable
Nasty looking couches in our room
Broken shower handle, so no hot water- until I called for maintenance
Broken hair dryer
Broken lock on our door- until I called for maintenance
No Internet until I called for maintenance 
Requested a King bed, got two queen beds 
Room service doesn't pick up in a timely manner. Wine glasses in hall for 3 days. 
Poor hotel maintenance- Ice cream drips on the beautiful brass elevator doors, never cleaned in the 5 days we were there 
Robot staff at front desk.  
Real Lions on display in a glass enclosure -I get the connection, just don't approve
The rainforest area with all its dusty plastic plants.  
I don't expect cheesiness at a hotel of this caliber 
I also expect to be pampered in a Hotel like the MGM. 
Things seem to be going downhill at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. 

But all in all, I had my family with me and that makes everything perfect 
We had a blast playing together. Happy 21ST Birthday Grandaughter 

Now please excuse me I need another nap.

What a spiritual, uplifting Catholic Community!

From the opening notes of the hymn, "All are welcome in this place", I knew how special Saint Patrick's was to me.

"Let us build a house
where love can dwell
And all can safely live,
A place where
saints and children tell
How hearts learn to forgive."

There are so many things I want to share about coming here for 5 pm Mass. First is coming into their sacred space and hearing a first class Choir and musicians practicing . Their group also includes a pianist, a person on Keyboard and a very young College age drummer.  They were great, and not just for the practice, but throughout the service. They all worked well together and didn't overwhelm the senses. The music of Paul Hillebrand and the heavenly voice of their Cantor Jill Bagshaw are incredible and needs to be experienced to be appreciated.  

"Let us build a house where prophets speak,
And words are strong and true,
Where all God's children dare to seek
To dream God's reign anew."

Second is the friendly parishioners who sat around me, including some long time friends. Even though Father Eric was away on vacation, the folk at Saint Patrick's didn't seem to miss a beat. Their ministry to the poor of spirit here in the valley is well known, particularly their efforts at Justa Center.  But it's also the nearly four dozen other ministries, where they offering themselves as the hands and body of Christ, which makes you realize how special this community is.

"Let us build a house where love is found
In water, wine and wheat:
A banquet hall on holy ground,
Where peace and justice meet."

I've come to Mass here many times and the Liturgy is wonderful. I have never felt this way in any other Catholic Church.  It is so moving, to stand up and have the entire church hold hands for The Lord's Prayer, and I do mean everyone. It's special and I only wish I could convey how moving it is to feel the spirit in this church when it happens. It's just amazing to have over five hundred members standing, holding hands and reciting not a prayer by rote, but with feeling and love that makes it so special. 

"Here the love of God, through Jesus,
Is revealed in time and space;
As we share in Christ the feast that frees us:

All are welcome, all are welcome,
All are welcome in this place."

OK. So I've only had a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese. I'm not a New Yorker. I'm not a bagel expert. I know the yelp debate on this culinary disc can get more heated than a black leather seat in Phoenix in July. But each time, it's perfect. Cream cheese is spread evenly on the bagel. Bagel is cut in half and wrapped in white paper. I hate the places that serve you cream cheese in a little squeeze packet. UGH! I never get all the cream cheese out and end up cutting it open and licking it out. Like the lady in the commercial squeezing ketchup packets at home into her ketchup bottle to save money.

The gentleman behind the counter is friendly and remembers my name even when I don't. The menu has pastries, hot breakfast and hot lunches. You can also grab fruit, yogurt and Snapple. There's plenty of reading material and the decor is simple yet comfortable. 

It's tucked away at City Square Plaza (gee, thus the name)...next to the Light (De)Railed Cafe. Yep. It's 86'd. 

Thanks City Square Cafe...for allowing me to make a pit stop on my way to work. Those three blocks can be grueling in the summer and it's refreshing to cool down a bit before walking 200 yards to my job.

Back in 1999, Kenny Guinn declared this part of Spring Mountain as "China Town" because apparently all Asians in Clark County are Chinese. Sure, you can argue that all Asian people did originate from the Chinese, but thats not the point. 

The Chinatown Plaza was the very first China themed mall in Chinatown. And today the Chinese community of Las Vegas is very honored that the most famous resident of Chinatown is Floyd Mayweather.

This shopping center has a Filipino Restaurant, a couple of Pho places, a ton of Korean restaurants, and a huge shopping mall to buy Chinese gifts and Beckoning Cats. Like only 30% of this shopping center actually features Chinese businesses.

Remember that Chinese food has a 5000 year history. So that's why so many of our favorite Japanese and Korean dishes look so similar. Every other Asian country stole their cuisine from China. A lot of you know that Ramen originated in China, but did you know that Sushi also originated in China  as well?

Most of us use this shopping center as a place to park because the shopping center with Ichiza, Yagyu Yakiniku, and Anime Ramen has no parking spaces. I've never been towed, but recently they hired this gigantic Native-American parking enforcer who looks f*cking scary!

When I first moved to Las Vegas, I immediately noticed that all the different ethnic groups of Asian people hated each other. There was a gigantic and vicious inter-Asian rivalry going on. I didn't like this one bit because as a young child, I grew up in Arcadia, where one of the most brutal concentration camps for Japanese-Americans once existed. As a child I remember seeing Chinese-Americans get told to "go back to Japan". During the LA Riots, many African-Americans in the area used to say racial slurs to Chinese-Americans, telling them to go back to Korea. My point here is that we as Asian-Americans all had to suffer together because they just don't care what specific type of Asian we are. Vincent Chin made this argument a fact when he was murdered.  

The very first documented Asian-American was actually Filipino. But, the very first large migration of Asian-Americans were Chinese. They paved the way for all the rest of us. Since they first set foot in the United States, they were hated and vilified for no reason at all.  In the 1850s,  a legislative was passed that made Chinese men unable to testify in court, in 1862 California residents voted that all Chinese residents should be taxed for being Chinese, 1878 the United States Government revoked every Chinese immigrants citizenship as Americans even if they were born in the USA, they were also prohibited from getting married, and in California it was NOT illegal to assault a Chinese man, in 1882 all Chinese immigrants are banned from entering the USA. Most of these laws were not repealed until the 1940s!! 

Frequently, I walk around in Chinatown and see a "westerner"acting completely disrespectful and making racist jokes towards every little Chinese decoration in the plaza.  The reason they do this is because the Chinese people are too polite to them and allow them to do this. These "westerners" should thank God everyday that they didn't do that in a Vietnamese district like Westminster California, because I guarantee that some Vietnamese guy would have beaten the living crap out of them, abducted them, and brought them to the backroom of a Pho restaurant and force them to play Russian Roulette. Yeah, it's called "Russian" Roulette, but the Vietnamese are the only people who are Man enough to play it. 

All I ask, is that you treat the Chinese with some respect when you come here. You don't see Chinese people  come into stores like "EXTREME John Smith's HARDCORE Dirt bikes, Surfboards, and Skate Shop" and disrespect you guys.

Just got this message from one of the owners (their review is under Jestin M.) 

this is me one of the owner of Tina's cafe.  you are obviously a poor idiot who is miserable in life.  If you have a nerve, you should've tell your complaint to us instead of crying out on yelp.  We have so many flowers and will continue doing great. Tina will bit the fack out of you if you come and let her know who you are.  ASS HOLE. Go back to your Mexico and eat corn with your whore mother.  by the way, your picture looks like a a guy who is infected with some kinds of disease.   Your women is ugly as you btw (lol)

So after this I personally called and spoke with a manager, they confirmed Jestin works there. Even though I was being cordial with my tone and trying to be helpful in saying that this was my experience, maybe others are experiencing the same thing and that can help fix the problem, they proceeded to say a few things I wont retype here and hung up. 

I responded back and so did they. If you want to read that here is a screen shot of that: 
http://i.imgur.com/PvcBz.jpg

So it was not enough for them to say that message. They just texted me this right now (since I called with my cell). 

"You keep mentioning 5yrs old about your stupid compain, we will report your info to be investigated if you are a child melester. Tina has a right not serve you for the safty of our customer. Take your little 10 dollar to mcdonald's. Lol"

Here is a screen shot of the text I just got from the business phone number:

So if you feel like this is a place you would like to try out after reading this, by all means take your chances.

This is the busiest Walgreens I ever been to, there are good reason why.  First of is located in the Las Vegas Strip, it between Palazzo and Venetian.  Just next to the popular Tao Night Club.  This is the place to get you food, water and other important items restocked.  Eating and drinking is pricey in the Strip, you can save tons of money just shopped here, and just aware that most hotel in the strip does not had microwave or the fridge unless you got a suite type of room.

Price is slight higher than what you fight in most other Walgreen, but is understand since the high cost of the strip in general, even a foot long subway cost $10, but you still manage to find 99 cents Arizona Tea in here.   If you wanted to eat a nice buffet later of the day, this is good place to get you breakfast and late night snack fix without had to spend much.  Save those money can use more in party and gamble =)

Looking down & spying the bright "Red Velvet Cafe" sign from the upper floor of the Fashion Show mall had me doing a quick search for the closest escalator. If one wasn't nearby, I was considering jumping over the rail and Spidermanning it down to this beacon of red velvet in the middle of a mall. Was I bored with shopping? Sure. Was it time for Red Velvet? It's ALWAYS time for red velvet, foo.

Well, guess what? This isn't just any old corner bakery red velvet cupcake or Grandma's Christmas cake either. It's a Vegan Red Velvet Cake. Yep, VEGAN. Giddy-up cause I'm getting one to eat right then and there. The lady at the counter brought it to our table with two forks and couple glasses of water. The individual cake costs $5.50 and is perfect for sharing or just eating by yourself. Olivia Z. and I split it since we were heading to a buffet in a couple hours.

Soooooo... how was it? Oh, you mean the Vegan Red Velvet Cake. It was great. I don't know how they do it without butter and such, but the flavor was rich, the cake moist, and the frosting near perfect. If you are sick of the uber-sweet fake red velvet at your local supermarket, the Vegan Red Velvet Cake at Red Velvet Cafe is a treat. 

Sure, they have other stuff like sandwiches, salads, coffee, and juices, but save room for a healthier and yummier take on a classic American dessert - the Red Velvet Cake.

In every city, usually across the street or within a short walk of the High School there is a neighborhood hangout. 

The food can run from just average, to exceptional. Elmer's tends to be mostly in the latter camp over the former, what a wonderful surprise.

My two coworkers and I came here for a late lunch yesterday. From the outside, it doesn't look like anything special. Heck, even on the inside it doesn't either. 

Yes, Elmer's is a hole in the wall type place. One that probably wouldn't even make Guy Fieri's DDD list. But the food is good.

I ordered chips, steak burrito and a drink. The tab came to under $9 and if you look at the picture of the chips, it's kind of basic. The Salsa btw comes in plastic squirt bottles. LOL. 

But my steak burrito was the real deal and bomb! Take a look at my picture and know that Chipotle has nothing on this bad boy. It tasted as good as it looks and it's only $5.85.  Nice. 

Enjoy!

I was met at the back door.  Yes, I'm your back door girl!  Parking here can be a bitch, as well as pulling into the place...but when you get there...Heaven!
I got a cheese and garlic pizza to go.  I pulled into the parking lot and they said my name.  Stalker?  Nope.  Just good service, I guess.  Or maybe they know what a pain it is to park in back and walk allllllll the way around the building to get to the front door?  Anyway...
This is true East Coast pizza.  Thin crust, proper sauce and amount and loads of dripping cheese.  Tons of crushed garlic, too!  
My first time there, I chatted with the owner.  He actually uses Frank's for his wings!  Hey, I'm from Buffalo.  I *know* wings!  I didn't have them, but he did let me try the sauce.  Perfecto!
Huge, East Coast slices, too.  The kind you have to fold in half to eat it, with grease dripping down your hand to your elbow.  THIS is what pizza is supposed to be!!!

First off - LOVE Lily!!
She is super sweet, very helpful and an awesome tattoo artist!

I like the staff here. Mainly because they all seem to get along and joke around a lot. That always makes me feel comfortable. You're uncomfortable enough as it is when you're having your body needled up. 

This place is clean and the decor is pretty sweet. I called to make an appointment with Lily after seeing her portfolio on Instagram. I emailed her what I wanted and she was ready when I got there. I've had a hard time with people wanting to do my tattoo in all red. Some artists just don't like it because it doesn't always turn out as well - this is what I've been told. Lily said "no problem" and completed the job better than I even anticipated. 

They have very reasonable pricing and they're fairly easy to get into. I would recommend really knowing what you want before you go in and schedule an appt. They seem to get a lot of walk ins due to being so close to the strip. I'm glad I finally found a good tattoo parlor in town. It's hard to find good artists that are friendly. 

I got an all red lotus - representing my recent spiritual journey. I am more than pleased with the final product!

It remains an excellent choice for steak in Vegas but where's the Japanese beef?

Straightforward starters.  A good tuna tartae.  Chunkier than most, lightly layered / mixed with avocado with soy ginger dressing. A crisp rice cracker a good textural foil.   The tempura calamari, light and crisp with very little residual oil.  Pairs well with it's sweet chili sauce.

To the steaks, USDA Prime, extremely well trimmed, beautifully seared on a hardwood burring grill, even coking to exact temperature.  

The Australian wagyu filet mignon, buttery with a cloying fatty finish.  Around A3 quality.  Tender but lacks any wow factor.  The star of the menu is the Angus 300 (it is not aged for 300 days but the name of the steak.).   According to the restaurant, the steak is raised in elevations in excess of 3000 feet and fed slowly for 300 days, finished for the last 100 without any hormones or antibiotics.  The steak is wet aged 14 days and finished with a 28 day dry age.  Very good, pronounced dry age flavor, nutty and buttery with a good umame punch.

Standard USDA Prime cuts are right on par.  Excellent, porterhouse and rib eye.  Both tender with good beef flavor. 

For sides, props to the bone marrow with lemon remolata.  Rich and unctuous.  Toss the toast, scoop the marrow on the steak, add the granita and enjoy!  A beautiful pairing that brightens the steak and makes it even more wine friendly.  The black truffle and cheese decedent.  Aromatic, covered with shaved black truffles.  Works very well with the Angus 300 further accentuating its umame goodness.

Finally, for non beef eaters, the roasted Chilean Sea Bass with a miso yuzu glaze and a side of roasted maitake mushrooms good eats.  Think miso butter fish with a side of great mushrooms, umame on umame.  

Keep in mind, portions are smaller when compared to other top steakhouses.

Service remains steakhouse proper and friendly.  The wine list remains excellent.  High Vegas resort pricing.

*****scratches head***** No Japanese beef?

Looking for comfort food.... Away from home.....  Where to go? Well. First, check out yelp reviews in the area, and you may be pleasantly surprised as to what you will find. I'm trying to find a place to eat outside of the infamous LV strip and I see Mike O's review which solved my quandry.

Located on Decatur, tucked away in the many warehouse and strip mall type buildings is Mr. Mama's. Simple menu, simple interior, open kitchen, friendly service, most times a wait for your table, good food! Good prices! And great and friendly Mr. Mama! 


Okay Mike !!! Chicken Fried steak. $9.75???? And enough left overs for another meal!
and the tuna melt! Whole chunks (not flakes) of albacore... Choice of cheese and a choice of soup or salad, and the clam chowder ? chowder flavored with oregano... Filled our table and tummies!

Yelp deal?  Get your deal before you go!

It was late and I was doing some early Christmas shopping in west Chandler and I stumbled upon Zos Kitchen. I decided to run in and grab something. 

But when I got back to my office after my pickup, I was really impressed. I've heard so many good stories, so I wasn't sure if it was going to live up to the hype. 

For my first try, I went with their Steak Stack for $7.59 with a Hummus 5oz side for $0.79(see photos). The damage came to $9.06 including taxes, which seemed pretty good for everything. 

What I wasn't prepared for was the tastiness of their bread. Don't get me wrong, everything was really very good. In fact, if they had used any commercial bread, this still would be a Four Star review. But the flavor of their rosemary bread was incredible. I would have paid $9.06 for a loaf of it. It was delicious! 

So, go enjoy, Zos Kitchen!  I will definitely be back.

As I walked up to will call about thirty minutes to showtime, I was astounded at the line of people to the right of the Crown Theater entrance.  "Damn! Is it like this every night?" I asked the box office person.  "Every Saturday night." he said.  You'd think that the actual "King of Pop" himself was about to hit the stage.  Fortunately, I had golden circle seats and avoided all of that.  Maybe tip the guys working the front to get in early and dodge that whole debacle or fake an injury, start limping and tell them you need to be seated immediately.  It was 90 percent full.    
    
MJ's Live?  Four different cast members play him throughout the week.  We were fortunate to see Justin Dean.  The moves and mannerisms were as believable as they could possibly be.  To his credit, I had a hard time telling when he was actually singing or lip-synching.  He would switch from singing into his headset mic and then to a regular handheld throughout while still wearing the headset which was kind of weird but whatever.

The audience took everything over the top.  One guy at the table up front was sporting a full on MJ Jheri curl hairstyle with sunglasses that he wore the entire time.  At another table was an adorable 3 year old with his own plastic mic that danced his face off, and even did some pop star poses with the guitar player.  Then there were the folks looking for a complete suspension of disbelief and going batshit crazy the whole hour.  "OMG! We luuuuvvv you Michaaaaaaaaal!"  Someone needed a Pepsi.

I can't find the exact word for all of it, but there was a fun, schlocky, "am I really being entertained by this right now?" vibe to the whole deal.  Kids would love it.  3.5 stars.

An all American steakhouse.  No Australian Wagyu.  No A5 Japanese beef.  Just USDA Prime Nebraska corn feed beef and American comfort food sides that bring out the best in the beef's flavor.

Rule one:  Stick to land.  Visit it's sister restaurant, Lakeside for well prepared seafood.  This is a steakhouse.

For starters, classic foie.  Served incredible thick cut, beautifully seared with slivers of apple, apple puree, tart huckleberries and vegetal celery leaves.  Beautiful balance. Pure decadence.  The charred steak tartare with the classic Worcestershire, Dijon, chives and crumbled egg is equally good.  The slight addition of the heat tightens up some of the beef and releases it's beef flavor.  Good texture and another flavor dimension.

To the steaks.  USDA prime, well aged, extremely well trimmed.  All steaks cooked to temperature, juicy and tender.  Top props to the 28 day, dry aged tomahawk.  Complex, nutty, slightly bleu cheese flavor of the dry aging and deep beefy goodness near the bone.  Win!   The porterhouse for two, the best way to enjoy both the filet mignon and the NY strip.  Less complex flavor but a steak lover's steak.  Once again, excellent beef flavor nearest the bone.

A well made variety of sauces are offered that enrich or brighten the steaks but then again, why rob yourself of the great American beef flavor?

Sides are very well conceived.  They enhancing the smoky, umame characteristics of the beef.  Top props to a great late season creamed corn topped with shaved black truffle.  Sets off all kinds of earthy fireworks when paired with the beef.  Sauted wild mushrooms (enhance umame) and grilled jumbo asparagus with the hint of vibrant lemon juice (contrasting flavor enhancing the beefs natural sweetness) all great choices.

Service is steakhouse familiar and efficient.

Excellent wine list. Good vintage depth.  New world emphasis.  High Vegas resort pricing.

Consistent.  Several repeat visits (thanks to the Wynn Classic tourney).  An American steakhouse that hits the mark.

Everything from my previous review no longer applies.  Except for my tips about carrying a camera and a small plastic bag for food and water at the finish.  In 2010, when I wrote my first review, the race was limited to 28,000 runners.  It was crowded but not too horrific.  This year, Las Vegas and the race organizers apparently got greedy and allowed 44,000 runners to enroll.  That is way too much.  Next year, they want to have 60,000 runners.  Not a good idea.  In the interest of being concise, here were the problems with the 2011 race and why I will not run this again unless they get the number back down to 28,000:

1. The race organizers listed on the website that runners and spectators could park at the Luxor or Excalibur.  But apparently, they failed to clear that with the casinos and the casinos would not let us in.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.

2. The marathon started 1.5 hours before the half marathon and went out in the neighborhoods surrounding Mandalay Bay.  So when the marathon runners hit the strip after running the first 13 miles, unless they were extremely fast, they ran right into a wall of much slower half marathon runners.  That just sucks.

3. It took forever to get out of the finish line corral area because it was backed up for pictures.  Just mug shots of the runners.  Nothing fun like pictures with showgirls like last year.

4.  It took us over an hour to just get out of Mandalay Bay.  This is just walking out of the casino and does not include walking to the car, traffic, etc.  Mandalay Bay and/or the race organizers got the bright idea to schedule all this during National Final Rodeo and the opening weekend for Michael Jackson's The Immortal World Tour.  Piss poor planning all around.

It's a real bummer that I can't do this race again.  I've been doing the half marathon ever since it has been on the Strip and I wanted to continue the tradition.  But unless the race organizers place the cap at something reasonable, I can't do it anymore.

They say good things come in small packages. Well this has to be the smallest Peter Piper that I've been to yet. 

What I really like about this place is that they actually have pizzas lined up and ready to eat.  A fair share of Triple P's aren't ready for the 11:30 lunch crowd and hardly have any pizzas available. I chalk that up to poor management. They're usually too busy making pizzas for the carry out crowd instead of the dining room. This place is the exception and seems to be managed correctly.

Another thing that is very cool about this location is that they give you one of those flashing buzzers when your customized pizza is ready to go. So you don't look like an ass when you're cutting in line to get your special order. I hate when I order a pizza and it's half way eaten by the time I get up there.

As far the taste, of course Peter Piper is an average tasting product but it's a cheap lunch. The only thing is that this place can get pretty crowed since it has a relatively small dining room. But they do have plenty of parking.

Fantastic fries ..., but the Farm Burger was flavorless & dry. It should be renamed the Farm BoreGR. The famous Farm was totally not worth our 30-minute wait in line.

Luckily, a Hell's Kitchen Burger was much better ... thanks to add-ons of Duck Breast Bacon and a Fried Egg (both of which are on the Farm BoreGR) which complimented the Hell's Kitchen Jalapeo, Tomato, and Avocado.

Truffle Parmesan Fries (Lunch $10) 
... featured large Potato Cuts that were exhilarating without the normal oiliness of French Fries. The flavor blend of Truffle Parmesan, Truffle Salt, and Truffle Aioli was Truffletastic. Of course, at $10 you'd hope these were better than your normal burger joint fries ... and they were. (4 stars) 

Hell's Kitchen Burger (Lunch $13) 
... is one of the popular burger choices with Asadero Cheese, Roasted Jalapeno Peppers, Avocado, and Roasted Tomatoes. It would of been 3 stars except we added, for a few $ extra, Bacon and a Fried Egg. (4 stars with add-ons)

Farm Burger (Lunch $14) 
... was probably the most hyped burger on Yelp; however, despite the goodness of Bacon and ooze of a Fried Egg, this was a dry blah disappointment. Olivia wanted to return it, so, I gave her half of my HK Burger. If you get the Farm BoreGR add Avocado and Jalapeno Peppers to add any flavor. (2 stars)

Batch 19 Beer ($7)
... Bold and hoppy like Gordon Ramsay himself, this Coors-brewed Pre-Prohibition Style Lager helped take the edge off. If I go back to Gordon Ramsay ... and there is no line ... then I might just plop down in front of one of the TVs and relax with an order of the Fries and this brew.

With a slow wait and overpriced BoreGRs, the cool factor for Gordon Ramsay BurGR isn't enough to elevate this burger joint among the elite food destinations in Las Vegas.

My overall experience here was good, not phenomenal. Lets face it, it's a beautiful venue... Very urban San Francisco like, that I loved. But the very first impression apart from the building itself was the bouncer. He was very rude. I understand he probably deals with a lot of bs being its downtown and all but when a group of very well dressed young girls approaches, no need to be anything but nice. I was also very bummed the 2nd story (a rooftop balcony) was closed. When I asked one of the bartenders why, she shrugged & said "because it's a slow night I guess" when I also asked a different female bartender if they had wine she had no clue. Then I proceeded to ask her if they had Chopin (due to my gluten allergy I can only have potato vodka) & she had no idea what that was. A bartender named Vinny intervened and made me my usual Chopin & water. He took care of my group the rest of the night & was very helpful. You can obviously tell the majority of the staff was hired for their looks not their skills. Once they weed out the bimbos I'm sure they will do much better.  
The bar is absolutely stunning. With a very sleek look to it Commonwealth definitely sets itself apart from your average downtown bar. A lot of people are on here complaining about the prices... Honestly I think it's about time we had an upscale bar downtown. It's all apart of the revamping Zappos has brought to the area. Give this place some time to work out the kinks & I'm sure it will be a 5 star review the next time I come in.

My favorite free attraction in Vegas.  Yes, even beating the street people giving out cards with naked women on them J/K ;p

The Fountains of Bellagio are located in the heart of the Strip, where visitors can enjoy a beautiful display of water being shot high into the sky, in tune with music.  
http://www.vegas.com/attractions/on-the-strip/bellagio-fountains/

Strolling along the Strip, especially at night, it's a great sight to behold, whether with friends or your significant other.  Last time I was there, we saw the Fountains with Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" playing.  Later on, on the way back to our hotel, we saw it again with Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On".  Such an extravagant spectacle for the senses!  There's just something about an oasis of moving water right before your eyes in the middle of the searing desert,  music tickling your tympanic membranes.  All for free!

Great views from the front of Bellagio, or when dining at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  The show runs every 15-30 mins, with the start times depending upon the day.  

You can't miss this attraction at the Strip, literally & figuratively.  I know when I'm in Vegas again, I'll certainly enjoy checking out the Fountains of Bellagio several times more.

Highly recommmend!

Decadence & debauchery abound at this local hotspot! 

If you're looking to celebrate and get your party on, i highly recommend this club.

Located inside Steve Wynn's Encore Hotel and Resort, the club was buzzing with party goers crammed in a line that appeared to have no end!

To forgo the line, we opted for bottle service with Goose and it was worth every penny!  If you're a dude, plan on paying bottle or slipping the usher a few $$$, that's just how they roll in Vegas.  When in Rome, folks!

With that said, there was still a bit of a frustrating wait inside the club for our table.  Once we got past all that BS, we did indeed land a great table...with a POLE! 

The girls got right up there as soon as we arrived and the party was officially on! The club was huge but oddly enough it was shoulder to shoulder on the dance floor and pretty much everywhere else!  This place was packed, but truth be told, who wants to go to an empty club anyways?! 

A great mix of Top 40 music was blasting with a heavy bass from the large speakers throughout and the club opened out to a beautiful pool area where folks were partying it up outside, as well. 

From there, drinks were up and the evening slowly became a distant blur.
Ok, I recall more than that, but am i actually gonna tell ya? 

Heck no!

What happens in Vegas, right?

Happy Times

I have to go w/ five.  I can still remember every, even the most subtle flavor, starting with the bread and oil, the Ginhound cocktail, followed by the salad (we chose the salad Pavle talked up, and we were not disappointed).  As we munched on the salad, I commented to my dining partner that we were eating a lot of grapefruit - both the Ginhound and the shaved fennel salad featured the fruit, but neither were overly bitter at all.  It was the ideal way to start the meal.

We elected to carry on with the Spigarello (delicious- excellent balance of garlic and a slightly buttery taste) again per Pavle's recommendation, along with an order of the mozzarella w/ an egg over braised leeks.  This was my favorite dish (well, tied with the salad and dessert...).  The mustard breadcrumbs added a little tangy flavor along with a fantastic texture.  

Finally, we decided to split the bread pudding dessert.  Made w/ chocolate/cherry bread from the Phoenician's bakery (available at the Old Town Farmer's Market in Scottsdale), it was decadent.  

All in all a fantastic meal - everything was perfect.  The atmosphere, the service...  It was fantastic.  You won't regret going there.

The Flamingo is definitely A-OK in my book. It's definitely not the nicest hotel on the strip, but for the price you get prime location and a pretty nice pool.

I paid $300 for three nights in a suite last weekend, seriously can't beat that price. But, it's true - the amenities are lacking. While there was lots of space in the room, the beds are meh (although very clean), the carpets are pretty dirty, the bathtub is straight outta 1981, and there's no minibar in the room.

I've stayed in the go-rooms before, and while they are much smaller than this suite, there are definitely a nicer experience. 

The service was nice throughout though and I really really enjoy the Flamingo pool. It's adults only (except for a small, very separate pool elsewhere for kids), it's pretty huge, they play good music, and they have cheap craps tables poolside. 

Would I stay there again? ...meh, I'd probably suck it up and upgrade to a Go-Room if I did. While I don't spend a ton of time in the hotel room when I'm in Vegas, it is much nicer to have a big plush bed and a schmancy shower waiting for you when you do get back to the room.

My Sweet lovers guide to vegas treats!!

Jean Phillipe patisserie is a must. They have two locations, bellagio with the famous chocolate fountain display  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=5CTu6r-oMEnATEqkMQFtYg and the one at Aria  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=zqVvDm_-ikgvhPMZrUK3Lg which is bigger and has an area to sit down and indulge. U can have a variety of cakes, gelato, chocolates, crepes, pastries.. They do not sell individual macarons but u can buy a packaged set. The crepe, mousse cake and creme brulee gelato I had were all excellent!

Max Brenner @ Caesars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=VM3v-ly8TaqF6Gi21XOCTg is chocolate lovers dream! The chocolate smell wafting alone is intoxicatingly delicious. They not only have a boutique of chocolate treats, u can eat a fabulous meal here and make sure to get a chocolate chip walnut cookie: the best I ever had! 

Check out sugar factory at PH http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pNR0cAPdO4RHulVTFssn-A?select=eFmRocS3vcKGcJNlBTibOQ if u love gummies, lollies etc. but the cupcakes, macarons, gelato looked pretty ordinary.

Bouchon bakery at the Venetian  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aT_SsfZ6GQgJGyuIv1Hapw?select=U4VwyUcdlz4Mlsl3hqb5Ug is a great stop if you've never been to any of the bouchon bakeries. It's a small stand as opposed to a shop. Signature bouchons r always great, their macarons r not my fave but huge and pretty. A new fave for me is their carrot whoopie pie!

Vosges at the Forum shoppes is a cool place to check out if u like exotic flavor chocolates. But it can be  pricey.
If u like banana cream pie, the one at Emerils at MGM is awesome!

I went to Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmo http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=v2QzpbqjH_ok7MlKhQsnpw expecting awesome desserts but altho beautiful, I was not too impressed.

Didn't get to check out Payard at Caesars but they have macarons there, altho i'm sure they don't beat Paulettes (now called Lettes) in LA.  Dessert at Wynn buffet  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=IAjMHTukj1EFSbL6WILEgg was disappointing

Other highlights of vegas eats for me was Cosmopolitan pizza, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon@ MGM and Earl of Sandwich @ PH.

Shows: Jabbawockeez at Monte Carlo was super fun and very memorable!

If ur going from LA, if they r open, make sure to visit My Delight Cupcakery in Ontario on the way home. They have the best cupcakes around!!!http://www.yelp.com/biz/my-delight-cupcakery-ontario#query:my%20delight%20cupcaker

Arizona's okay. 

Arizona when drunk is awesome.

When coming to Shotgun Betty's, your perspective will probably be influenced greatly by your expectations and also your gender. And, the time of day you visit.

If you're a guy and you just want to get drunk at a bar (and don't want to get dressed up to do it), Shotgun Betty's will satisfy your cravings both for liquor and eye candy.

The girls who work here are pretty much all 9s and 10s in a porn video sort of way (I mean that as a compliment), and they are all friendly enough, especially if you have a roll of dollar bills.

If you hand out fives and tens you might earn a nice, Cointreau-flavored kiss, depending on the girl.

It's crowded because it's such a low-pressure bar and they let in everyone. The drinks suck, but it's a dive and the girls have a "but I'm pretty" excuse going for them.

A huge percentage of the patrons will be total dirtbags and creeps, but what do you expect when the girls gyrate on stripper poles and there's no cover charge to get in.

If you're a girl coming to this bar, you'll be in the minority because most of the patrons are boozed up men, whose attention will be given to the hottie dancing on the bar in her Daisy Dukes and cowboy boots. 

If you come in for a boozer-nooner, and enjoy a meal at the bar, you'll find that the girls who work here are not mindless airheads. Not that they're going to work on the space station sometime in the future, but they're really cool.

Mixed drinks are much better during the day because there's not such a huge crowd, it's light outside, and the girls probably have more time to gin the tonics and coke the rums.

The music is mostly rock and roll, with bits of metal and country thrown in for good measure. Such a soundtrack always bangs, but after your fifth Jaeger bomb it's positively orgasmic.

So, when you come back to your real town, and your friends say, "Hey man, what did you do this weekend?" And you reply, "Went to Arizona," and they come back with, "Oh, sorry..."

--you can hit them with, "Yeah I went to Scottsdale."

"Did you go to Shotgun Betty's?"

"That's why I went to Scottsdale."

The Blue Adobe serves excellent  Santa Fe and New Mexican cuisine.

Sorry, there's no Tex-Mex, or piled high nachos or sizzling fajitas here.  New Mexican food focuses on Hatch green chiles and what they call a Christmas Tree sauce, that is half red and green.  

In New Mexico they put the green chile in and on almost everything, from bagels to burgers*.  You can even get dried red New Mexico chile pepper pod as Christmas ornaments in Santa Fe!

The Blue Adobe was founded by Chef Jose Leyva. It was his ability to deliver spice while maintaining incredible flavor that makes Blue Adobe different. As they advertise: "Our Fire Wood Grille uses Pecan Wood and our Chilies are Hatch."

One of the hallmark of Blue Adobe is their Fire-roasted Salsa and tri-color chips. These are so popular, you can order a 27 oz jar to take some home. On our most recent trip, we started off with this, along with an order of Guacamole ($5.95). 

One of us had their shredded beef Chimichanga ($14.95).  Very flavorful and not overly spicy. We also tried their High Desert Pasta ($13.95), which had a delicious EVOO garlic and Asiago sauce, served on a Tortilla (photo).  

For dessert, we had a New Mexican favorite of sopapillas with honey.  It's a very special puff dessert for only $1.50, and is not on the menu.

Our bill, including three drinks came to a fair $66.73 including taxes, but before tip.  Everything was delicious and exquisite. And, yes we're a fan of the Blue Adobe!

Enjoy!

I have created a Santa Fe and Taos list, if you would like to know more about the area and cuisine:

I love America. I love tacos. Not always in that order, but let's continue. I've been a few times already. And have yet to order a taco. That's because America's Taco Shop could easily be named America's Quesadilla Shop. But, we know, that wouldn't stick. I've had the carne asada quesadilla with lettuce, guac and monterey jack. Definitely on the smaller side, but hey, it's $4.50. And then there's that Mexican Coke. Pricier than the U.S. Coke. Oh. Wait. We're talking beverages here folks. I left the 80s behind years ago! Yep. Mexican Coke has REAL sugar and not HFCS. I"m not a real anti HFCS kinda guy...but let's just say, this Mexican Coca Cola really rocks my meats and cheeses! But, it's $3. So you gotta feel in a fancy lunch mood. My last visit I added an order of chips and salsa. All said, with tip, was over $13. 

A little pricey. But I didn't mind. Kind of like buying Kiehl products at Neiman's. Or a brick of brie at AJs. Or the expensive toilet paper with chamomile and lotion. Worth it! Especially the latter. I"m just sayin'!

Great service. Friendly, if not a bit too aggressive. Last visit Miss America herself was there with her cute and chatty daughter. I loved it! Though my kids are limited to a Schnauzer, I like seeing family together in the biz. 

America. America. God bless your tacos. From sea to shining sea. From 7th St. to 7th Ave. God shed your guac on me....

One of best hotels in the world. The Wynn hotel is located on the old Desert Inn hotel. It's the only hotel on the strip with a golf course. If you are a person who loves the European decor and beautiful artwork you are in for a treat. As we all know Las Vegas has a lot hotels from low end to high end. 

If you are a person who enjoys high end hotels you must give this hotel a try. The casino is done with outstanding artwork with great art finishing. If you are a high roller or a person plays the slot you will enjoy the great casino layout. The hotels is gorgeous from  A to Z. If you are a picky person when it comes to hotel beds you are going to love the beds here. 

If you are coming to Vegas you must give the spa a try. One of the best spas in the world. If you are buffet lover you will enjoy the outstanding food. I highly recommend  the Sinatra for high end dinning. If you are looking for something more low key check out the country club. You can have lunch over the patio that overlooks the golf course. 

Being a big fan of Caesars Palace for may years the Wynn is my new playground in Vegas. All the way around this is a 5 star resort.

Ever hear that saying "muscle weighs more than fat"? I don't know about you, but doesn't a pound of muscle weigh the same as a pound of fat?  You hear it all from time to time..."I'm not fat, I'm big boned", "it's baby fat", or "I weigh a lot because I have a lot of muscle" How do you know?  How do you really know if you've never been tested?  Yes, we can all do the eye test.  But if you're interested in knowing exactly where you stand with your body fat, you have to give Bod Pod a try. 

Bod Pod Las Vegas is located in Summerlin inside Anytime Fitness.  I've been tested before, but only through BF calipers.  However, there's about a 5% variance with calipers. In my opinion, that's way too big of a variance.  That's the difference between someone 15% BF and 20% BF.  The most affordable and closest to 100% accurate is the Bod Pod.  

Here's the process:
1.  Set up an appointment.  Cost is $50 for one test or $100 for three.  http://leanbodymetrics.com/

2.  Don't eat or workout at least 3 hours before your appointment.  Before you arrive, you will need to come prepared with the correct clothing.  Very important to wear minimal, form-fitting clothing such as compression shorts.  Women can wear a swim suit.  Both men and women have to wear swim cap, which they can provide if you do not have one. 

3.  Arrive at Anytime Fitness and complete a small questionnaire

4.  The Bod Pod is in a private room inside the gym.  You get weighed and then you sit inside the pod for 3 tests to ensure accuracy.  Dave is the best. He'll explain the process and later cover the data. 

5.  In less than 5 minutes, you get a print out of your body fat percentage, total body fat in pounds, and lean mass pounds/percentage.  From your numbers, you'll find out if you're risky (high body fat), excess fat, moderately lean, lean, ultra lean, or risky (too low).  Your overall numbers will also determine your resting metabolic rate (i.e. what your daily calorie intake should be). 

6.  You're done...Now, go eat and hit the gym. 

This is some pretty exciting and motivating stuff.  You don't have to be a fitness pro, bodybuilder, or athlete to be tested. If you're interested to finding out how much calories you need to gain or lose weight, looking to see if you're progressing in the right direction, or simply just want to know your true body fat percentage...then give Bod Pod a try. 


PS:  For me, it's no longer how much or how little I weigh.  It's all about body composition.  The scale keeps track.  But it's my body fat percentage that keeps score.  Dropped 5+ percent body fat since my last testing.  Yes, I'm keeping score and winning.  Yeah Buddy!!!

Vegas, day 50.  Final day of a successful WSOP.  Celebratory / farewell dinner for my poker buds.  Only one place fitting enough for this meal; Gourmet Magazines number one Thai restaurant in North America. 

It's unpretentious in an unassuming neighborhood. Looks can be deceiving, be prepared for a true culinary adventure.  This isn't your average neighborhood Thai restaurant.  Tamarind paste, not ketchup in the pad Thai.

Tip:  The menu is huge.  Expert on Thai food, study it in advance else let the servers guide you.  Allow the servers to suggest spice levels as well so dishes compliment not over power each other.

The meal usually consist of numerous dishes served at once.  It create a play of complimenting and contrasting flavors that collectively make the experience. If forced to find standout dishes:

Issan Sausage (a grilled sour pork sausage.  The natural sweetness of the pork shines through in this simple yet perfectly balanced sausage).

Sua Rong Hai (broiled beef tenderloin in a spicy, sweet sauce.  Tender with the spices bringing out the sweetness of the beef).

Plar Dook Kar-Prow Krob (Deep fried whole catfish topped with sauted fresh chili, garlic, and basil.  Earthy, fiery, absolutely delicious against the crisp, slightly overcooked catfish).

Charbroiled prawns (Extra large prawns grilled and served with a spicy, tangy tamarind sauce.  Beautiful balance again with the spices heightening the natural sweetness of the prawn.  The charbroiling adds a good bitterness).

Garlic prawns (lightly battered, deep fried with shells on in a fresh, peppery garlic sauce.  Just good eats).

Massive wine list (Wine Spectator Best Award of Excellence) with over 600 selections.  Heavy emphasis on Germany and France (Rieslings).  Very inexpensive.

And to the annoying ladies dining next to us commenting on our unrefined choice of utensils and wasteful over ordering:  (1) Thai etiquette dictates you use your fork to put food on your spoon and only put your spoon in your mouth,  (2) you don't ask for chopsticks, and (3) it is rude not to leave some food on the serving dishes and your plate.

Always a great culinary adventure.

Throw out everything you've known about frozen desserts because this will blow your mind. Ice cream...no. Frozen Yogurt...no way. Snow Cones...not even close.
Frost Bites Shavery is the modern day dessert craze that will take over!
At first glance, the flavors are common enough...mango, strawberry, chocolate, coconut...but wait...BLACK SESAME?! Where did you come from?!
Let's start with the texture...fluffy sheets of creamy ice in mango or BLACK SESAME (yes will use all caps for that) flavor that are piled high in a cup size of your choice...do not get anything less than a regular size. The delicate flecks of toasted sesame throughout prep you for this encounter. Rich, full bodied creaminess that has warm nutty and vanilla hints wrapped up in these icey sheets that is a wonderful departure from your normal experience. The mucho mango is like biting into fresh mango and topped with ripe mango is a tropical fruitopia blast. Lastly, strawberry condensed milk? Oh yes, please!! Only 4 ingredients in each, fresh fruit and all natural. It won't fill you up like ice cream or froyo and much more waist-friendly choice, even if making multiple trips....ahem, you know who you are :)
The owners are all super friendly and this location has shade plus some seating and plenty of parking. The ordering is simplified into 3 steps that streamlines the process. They offer stamp cards & will even honor Kuma cards as well.
Stay tuned for more flavors and cool off at our new summer hot spot!

Went there on opening weekend on Saturday.

1.  A billion stair-steps everywhere.  I had fun watching drunk girls trip and fall all over the place.  TROLOLOLOL, loads of laughter.  Someone is going to fall and die and they will get sued and eventually shut down.  You would think being built by Asians, this place would have better engineered walk-ways and lighted staircases, but NOPE.  Instead they hire a bouncer to hold a flashlight to shine each and every staircase.  Kids, this is why you go to college.

2.  Do we really need an Asian themed club?  AS IF THERE AREN"T ENOUGH ASIANS IN VEGAS CLUBS.  Yeah I said it, I'm Asian too, UMAD?  Can we have some diversity?  This way, we won't scare all the White girls and Hispanic girls, you know, the ones actually capable of flirting and talking to strangers instead of the circle jerk AZNs.

3.  No outside patio!!  Some times I just want to connect with a smart girl and stare at her big, beautiful eyes, and tell her my awesome stories instead of just getting bumped by Rotunda and have armpit sweat slapped on my face.  Can't beat XS' outdoor patio.

4.  They don't give out tap water!  The bottle water is 9$!  I didn't come here to drink and get stupid, I came here to flirt, and being the stingy Asian that I am, I think 9$ for water is a really bad deal.  My six pack requires a lot of babysitting and no thanks alcohol.  Asian girls: don't ask me to buy you a drink or if I have a table... especially those of you coming from LA.  It makes you sound really classless and ghetto.  You're not a princess and you're not entitled to free things.  Mommy spoiled you too much.

If you're a nerdy Asian guy who is tired of being BETA and put in the FRIEND ZONE by your rude bitchy Asian female friends and you want to be alpha, aesthetic, and learn how to pick up girls in Vegas or anywhere for that matter, hit me up.  Here is a video of me in Vegas.

This place is pretty fantastic. I actually felt like I was in a real life city when I was sitting here the other day on my laptop looking out the window. I sorely miss living in a real life city, specifically Boston, so places like this make me super happy. 

Staff are really cool and helpful. Its spacious and clean, and I don't feel like everyone in the place can see my screen, not that there is anything weird on there... okay there probably is, but bottom line is no one else is staring over my shoulder making me feel self conscious about shit I enjoy looking at on the internet. 

The coffee is delicious and strong. Nothing worse than a weak cup'o joe. I had a pot of their Orange Detox also, which wasn't terrible, but I could tell they used tap water.. I loathe tap water and can immediately tell a difference because I think the tap here tastes absolutely fucking disgusting. I still drank it though, because the chick promised me it would help me feel better.. Guess what, I sneezed all night. 

O'well.

Another thing I liked about this place is that there aren't 500 hipsters or emo-assholes sitting around looking depressed.. maybe I was lucky that day because it wasn't very crowded at all. So yeah, I dug Lola, and the prices are CHEAP. Thankfully this is yet another groovy coffee shop in the valley that is there to help me avoid the Corporate Whore that is Starbucks.

I love this place for breakfast! They have a huge selection of extremely delicious (and fattening) breakfast pastries. However, they also have options for those more health conscious. Their veggie sandwich was amazing... goat cheese, asparagus, tomato, onion...YUM. It was warm and crispy and just perfect. The wait can get a little long especially on the weekends, but the staff is always accommodating and efficient. The people next to our table were waiting for their order for quite some time and one of the staff came out and brought three complementary pastries for them because of the wait. Their food arrived shortly after and they shared their pastries with us! How nice...on all accounts! Overall i am excited to sample more of their menu..the smoked salmon sandwich looked pretty enticing.

Solid.  Still serving up all the flavor, fat, and syrupy opulence one expects from the Emeril Lagasse empire.  Oh, it happens to serve some great steaks.

Lunch is straight forward.  Salads, gumbo, and an INCREDIBLE STEAK SANDWICH.  A juicy skirt steak is topped with loads of roasted mushrooms, onions, wilted spinach and a pungent horseradish mayo on a warm ciabatta roll with a side of crispy truffle fries.  A great deal for under $20.

Dinner brings out the best.  For starters its hard to pass on the truffle parm potato chips (you weren't expecting that huh).  Crispy, earthy, just good eats and so perfect with any cocktail or wine.  The roasted heirloom tomato soup with  grilled ricotta cheese sandwich, creamy and acidic, comforting goodness.

The steaks are all great quality USDA prime.  Well trimmed and dry aged on site.  Unfortunately, the selection of cuts is limited.   The bone in strip, dense beefy goodness and stands up well to the Creole seasoning (used on all their steaks).  Dry aged steak purist will balk at its use as it destroys the umame goodness.  The bone in rib is more tender and makes the perfect base for "Oscar" style prep (topped with a generous heaping of jumbo lump crab meat, asparagus, and a very rich and tangy barnaise that blends perfectly with the creole seasoning). Win!

It's not all about the steaks.  The apple smoked kurobuta ham chop with grits and cider reduction is outstanding.  Pure simplicity.  Natural, tender ham packing  deep "hammy" flavor whose richness and saltiness is balanced perfectly by the acidity and sweetness of hard cider reduction.  Holiday ham on steroids!

Friendly and efficient service.

Very good wine list.  Vegas resort prices.

BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! (Four stars; yeah I couldn't resist).

A three star rating per Yelp means A-OK. I think that fits for this restaurant. I think all of the employees are polite AND helpful. They are always willing to help out the newbies coming into the shop. The sandwiches are okay, but nothing which will blow you away. The only exception would be the Beef and Cheddar, which is really good. I dig the two soda machines that they have so you're never waiting to fill up. They have those new machines where you use the touchscreens to pick your drink.

One source of aggravation for me as a customer is that businesses are always asking the customer to donate something. In this case, they ask the customer if they want to round up their purchases. I really just want to buy lunch and move on. Let me decide how I want to spend my Charity budget on my own terms.

Well Happy New Year everyone!

I was in the area and remembered there was a Luke's of Chicago nearby.  Sadly, to paraphrase Shakespeare's Hamlet: "Alas, poor Luke (Yorick)! I knew him" well!  

Seems the Chicago dog placed closed a while ago, replaced with the 5 minute pizza place Fired Pie. We have a Fired Pie up on Northsight in Scottsdale.  It too has moved into a former Chicago dog place, in that case Al's Beef.

I arrived around 1:45 and had only a few folks ahead of me in line.  I ordered their Tomato Basil (see photos) adding saut onions and mushrooms.  It came to only $7.75 which has to be a steal.

There was a nice amount cheese and sauce, with a hint of garlic.  It had a nice flavor and made me think of more expensive pizza places like Pomo's Cucina. The only drawback is that it's an "ultra thin" pie which they press out ahead of time (again see photos).  On the plus side, Fired Pie also has a small wine and beer list

So Four Stars, and yes I am a Fan.

After getting into this funny invention called a "car," we were off and headed to Symphony Hall for what the Muggle Studies professor calls "an orchestra show."  We were told we had to fit in.  Imagine if thousands of witches and wizards arrived by broomstick.  Those muggles would be so scared.  They're clearly of faint-heart.  It was a whirl of colors and sounds and somehow we found ourselves in a brightly lit lobby.  It is almost as gorgeous as the Grand Hall at Hogwarts!  How muggles manipulate "electricity" is beyond me.  Clearly floating candles would be more majestic and appropriate.  

I wonder if Minister Shacklebolt warned the local muggles that Hogwarts was doing a special show in town.  There was a flurry of activities for the odd muggle children.  So many people were dressed as what they perceive wizards and witches look like.  How peculiar.  The Sorting Hat was in attendance and putting children in different houses.  There was also a wand making area where squibs can feel more like a witch or wizard as well.  Pointy metallic objects were being thrown around and I was worried that it'll gouge my eye out.  If one of the filthy little muggles threw it in my hair or my face, I would have thrown out a Bat-Bogey Hex regardless of the professor's watchful eye.  I later learned that the muggles call it "glitter."

The show started at 2:30PM and the lights turned off faster than you can say, "Nox!"  The professor and the Gryffindork with us couldn't find our seats and an usher had to help us.  Had we been allowed to cast "Lumos," we wouldn't need the silly muggle to help us with her portable tube-thing with the light on the end.  A wand is so much more classy.  I was half-expecting Filch and Mrs. Norris to pop out and give us all detention but lucky for us, the muggle was nice.  Anyways, it was an hour of beautiful music and the acoustics was amazing.  Not a bad seat in the place!  Who knew a trombone and a harp can make such hauntingly beautiful music?  They acted out a skit with two Hogwarts student against a witch from the dungeons who was out to steal the conductor's wand.  At one point they told everyone to stand up to help cast, "Expelliarmus."  Had the professor not been sitting to my left, I would have cast, "Avada Kedavra."  Clearly it's a sure-fire way to defeat a dark witch.

The show ended with a special tribute to a mouse.  Who even has a mouse anymore besides poor Ron Weasley?  I'm glad Scabbers died.  Anyways, the tribute was for a Mouse... a Mickey Mouse.  The composition was from Fantasia.  You can tell the muggle children were lost while the adults all had a look of nostalgia.  Anyways, now that I have Yelped my review instead of having to write a two-foot essay, extra credit is complete.

[Just got back from the "Halloween at Hogwarts" show today if you couldn't tell.  Please don't take my Elite badge away because of my nerdom.  Toodles from The Slytherin Empress!]

Hubby and I decided to stop here to have a drink and share a dessert after having dinner somewhere else. I have really wanted to try this place for a while, but it was not what I had hoped. I ordered a "Banana Mango Margarita" priced at $16 and it came garnished with a few banana gummies. The drink tasted good and I liked the banana sugar that rimmed the drink, but the banana gummies were so rock hard that they couldn't be eaten. Bummer. Hubby ordered a "Reese's Martini" also priced at $16 and it was rimmed with peanut butter. I tried a couple drinks and thought it looked much better than it tasted. 

We ordered the "Sugar Factory Fondue" priced at $21.95 and was disappointed. You can choose white, milk or dark chocolate and we decided to go with the milk chocolate fondue. It came with gummy bears, homemade marshmallows, white chocolate bread, brownie bites, strawberries and bananas. The gummy bears were so hard like the banana gummies that we didn't bother with them. The homemade marshmallows and strawberries and bananas were actually good, but the bread and brownie bites were dry and bland. 

We sat near a window so the Bellagio water show made for a nice view. Our server was nice, but our total including tax was $60.86 and that is just way too much for 2 cocktails and 1 dessert that were nothing special. I came, I tried, I doubt I will be back if I am picking where to eat.

24 hour buffet run...It sounded like a good idea on paper....But after one meal, I vow to never eat again...lol

The theme of this place is so adorable and cute.  We went for brunch so we could get a taste of lunch and breakfast.  I didn't think anything was really a standout, most buffet food tastes the same to me.  

I stood in line at the crepe station for a long ass time...it wasn't really worth it to me, but it was still pretty good.  

There was so many different eggs and breakfast meat/sausage type things, I always wonder why white folk come in hoards for breakfast...it always tastes the same to me...

"The perfect lover is one who turns into a pizza at 4:00 a.m."  - Charles Pierce

One fateful night after a long grueling ten-hour shift, the ladies who work next door decided that we were going to grab some pizza and wings and complain relentlessly about working in customer service.  Pizza, wings, and a bitch-fest?  I'm down!

Being that I'm not from the Avondale area, I never would have came across this place if it wasn't for my ladies.  We have invaded Brother's time-and-time again for years and we always get the same large pizza and wings special they have.  Wings are always lip-smacking delicious and the pizza is gigantic and oozing with cheese and grease.  The crust isn't strong enough to hold their generous amounts of toppings and is pretty flavorless by itself but we can always toss away the crust, right?  It's the kind of comfort food you need after a day of dealing with ignorant and difficult people.  One bite from this place I don't like:  the canoli.  Then again, I'm not crazy for canolis so what do I know?

Brother's isn't a glamorous establishment by any means.  It's brightly lit, there are multiple televisions with sports on, the tables and booths are strong and sturdy, and there's a semi-sporty theme going on.  It's definitely not a romantic date spot but hey, you can grab a beer and catch a game while eating some cheap eats!

To all the people that are worried about their bodies when they go to a Vegas pool party...just get drunk and have fun because no one cares!
  
Tips:  
There is always a free guestlist for ladies.  Ask around to promotors.  
You must be wearing "fashionable swimwear".  Security will turn you away if you're wearing regular street clothes.
There are lockers at $40 for the day to store your stuff in.  They have all types of cell phone charges inside the lockers too.
Food and drinks are expensive but who cares.  The food is actually pretty good.  And the servings are pretty large.
You can't bring big bags or purses in.  Only tiny clutches.  They make you check large bags ($5) at entry.
You can't bring in any type of drugs, even OTC like asprin, ibuprofen, nothing...not even eye drops!
You can't bring gum, mints or breath spray.  Security said "nothing that can go in your mouth".
The security is way more strict if you go in General Admission or Guestlist line on the left side..  If you're getting a daybed/cabana or have a hookup, and go in on the right side, they don't check your stuff as strict.
Get one of those plastic cups with covers filled with liquor.  The slushy drinks are so good and they will get you f*cked up.  They're $40 and totally worth it, especially if you want to go in the pool with your drink.  Everyone starts splashing and you don't want herpe pool water filling your cup.

miX Lounge on the 64th floor of Mandalay Bay offers the best open-air panoramic views of the Las Vegas Strip. It opens at 5:00 p.m. and the night views are stunning. The restaurant and bar offer an upscale casual way to impress your date or your own eyes with all the lights & sparkles of Vegas over 400 feet below.

Olivia Z. and me stopped in miX before hitting the Michael Jackson ONE show cause it is very convenient to the theater. We were lucky cause there was no cover charge on Christmas Eve. After a quick ride up an express elevator, we eagerly hit the balcony to take in the mesmerizing view. Bring a camera and smiles.

After snapping a few pics, we headed inside and grabbed a seat at one of the many tables facing out. A waitress popped over in just a few seconds and our first round of drinks was on their way. miX Lounge is dark, but the menu is backlit and kind of cool. The faux leather seats and aluminum tables actually seem cool, too. 

Olivia started with a miXOPOLITAN ($16) with Absolut Citron, Cointreau, White Cranberry, Candied Lemon, and a string of Fresh Cranberries. It was sweet and refreshing at the same time. For round two, she switched to a Pear Martini ($18) recommended by the waitress. It features Grey Goose La Poire, Champagne, St. Germain, and a Pear Slice. Much like Olivia, this was even sweeter than the first drink. She liked them both.

For me, I was recovering from the previous night's drinking binge and stuck with some beers. Both were fine and $9: Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale and Sierra Nevada Kellerweis.

This review is strictly for the miX Lounge (not miX Restaurant) and the beautiful views from the outdoor patio.
 - Service was stellar. 
 - Drinks were decent.
 - The vibe was cool.
 - The view was dazzling.

It's time to add miX Lounge to the mix of must see attractions in Las Vegas.

Greek restaurant in a German hotel on the Vegas Strip?  Why not.

Estiatorio Milos continues to impress.  Outstanding seafood that calls one back to the costal villages and towns bordering the Mediterranean.  And let's just say, you will pay 40 percent less for this level of quality and freshness as the "other" place in the twin parabolic, glass sheathed extensions of an eccentric, once vegan, billionaire's ego anchoring the North Strip.  Huh what?

Milos features extremely fresh and vibrant ingredients like Mediterranean seafood, air flown live daily.  Dishes are prepared with respect for the incredible ingredients.  Most seafood is simply grilled, dressed with a peppery Greek olive oil and a squeeze of sun ripened lemon allowing the flavors to shine.  Exemplary examples include simply grilled, uber sweet, live langoustines (the only other place in Vegas to offer this), salty, oceanic Portuguese sardines, and a tender braised then grilled octopus.  The razor focused flavor of each carried by richness of the oil and enhanced by the acidity of the lemon.

Grilled whole fish also benefit from the simple finish.  Simply tour the seafood bar, pick one out, pay by the pound and enjoy.

Finally, for lobster lovers, do not pass on any of the lobster pastas (the lobster pasta for lunch uses an American lobster, dinner choices include the deep sea Bay of Fundy or Mediterranean blue lobsters).  Perfectly cooked chunks of tail meat mixed in a mild but acidic tomato base served with the cooked head.  Be sure to scrape out the tamale and mix it with the pasta for the added briny oceanic finish.

Tip:  Lunch offers the best value.  Three courses beginning at $22.14 with a maximum $20 supplement for top selections.

Very good wine list.  Wine by the glass offerings mainly Greek and pair perfectly with the food.  Service is attentive and very friendly.

A restaurant that has vastly improved with time.

Michelin Stars #20, 21, and 22

Let me start by answering your questions;

"No" and "No."

For my 30th birthday present, my wife treated me (us) to our first 3 star dining experience. My hopes were sky-high as we rode in our complimentary limo ride into the back of the MGM. We were escorted through the private baller area of the casino to the main entrance of the restaurant. Once inside, we were greeted with what might happen if you filled Barney the Dinosaur with gold and velvet and then blew him up, a purple pantheon of out-of-placeness. 

Of course, when having a once in a lifetime meal, you never order a la carte, you go all out with the 16 course degustation menu. Which leads me to some of my major gripes of the meal; the amuse was counted as a course, there were no intermezzos, apritifs and digestifs to break up the heavy French food, and the amazing cheese cart was not part of the tasting!

I lack the energy to describe each course in detail as I often do, but most of it was really really good. A couple were jaw droppingly good, yet others were only okay, and only okay for any place. For the price and the reputation, I expected so much more. I expected the foie gras to shed new light on the start of the universe and for the veloute to show me god, but no epiphanies were had that night. 

Service was spot on, never smothering or pretentious, and the wine guy guided us well. The pre-dinner bread and separate butter carts were equally amazing. 

For the money though, we both agreed that we would choose Urasawa, Spago, or Providence in a heartbeat for another meal. 

So now for your questions;
Was it worth it? NO
Would we go back? NO

PS - No good pictures because my old cybershot took a shit that day, so I bought a Sony Nex-3 and had no idea how to use it for dinner =[

I came here to celebrate the first birthday of my friends son. It was my first time at this park, dedicated in 1998. While this park offers several things the baseball and softball fields probably yield the most attention. They have 5 of them and they are well kept. From the O'Bannon Dr. side you will find 4 of the 5 fields and plenty of parking from that entrance. From the W. Oakey Blvd entrance is the other field and picnic area that you can reserve. The picnic area is first come first serve if not reserved. Even though my friends reserved the spot months in advance and the paperwork was posted showing it was reserved, people had already posted up in the spot when they arrived and had to be told politely that the spot was already taken. The picnic area is nice and spacious. Lots of tables under plenty of shade and plenty of surrounding tables out of the shade. My friends also hired a taco man and they had plenty of space to set up. There is a running faucet and counter area. The faucet/sink needs work because the faucet was bent and the bottom of the sink was black. Cans are set up for trash and recycle and working outlets meant we were able to play music which was nice. They have a small playground area with slides and swings as well a water play area that the kids at the party had a great time cooling off at. There are plenty of big trees where the large imported pinatas that were brought to the party hung and the kids had a blast. 

When it comes to the fee for reserving the picnic area (there is only 1 picnic area) I can't believe how affordable it is. For just $25 the picnic area is yours from 8 am - 10 pm. My nephews first birthday was at a park in Henderson and the fee was much, much more and the picnic area was smaller with less options. For parties larger than 50 you need to call and find out about possibly getting a permit. You will also need a special event permit if you plan on serving alcohol at your party. When making your reservation make sure and let them know if you plan on having a DJ or bounce house.

Geez!  I've been dreading this review for the last couple of hours.  If this is the last review you see from me, it is because I have upset someone and they have killed me.

Cash Only? WTF! The hot dogs are barely good (flinches, looks over shoulder).  YEAH I SAID IT!  Its not so much the food I have a problem with, its the staff and the hype.

I mean, I had a feeling it wouldn't live up to the hype.  How could it?  Its a hot dog joint that has the reputation of a 5 Star restaurant.  The dogs are good. Thats it, good.  The staff and functionality of the restaurant, however, was not. Plus, they charged me for an extra order of fries! Hey! My 20 month old can't eat two orders of fries!

I ate at Ted's for lunch on Sunday with my wife.  We both got the Jumbo All Beef dog with all the toppings (Catsup, Mustard, Onions, Relish, and a Pickle)... The problem was, while in line for only 5 minutes the staff managed to screw up 3 different orders.  That was like 40% screw up!  They were not apologetic, and the customers were getting irate!  This isn't the atmosphere I look for when eating lunch.  Irate customers and hasty cooks are not a good combo.  The onion rings were just a knot of messy fried mystery.  Don't get me wrong, I ate them!

Unfortunately, I can't give this place more than 3 stars.  And with this review I will be buying a handgun for protection.

Many fine dining restaurants in Vegas resorts seem to be having recession specials right now, so we decided to take advantage of a $39 prix fixe menu L'Atelier is offering. We found out that they stop serving this particular pre-theater menu at 6:45pm. We were running late, and got in closer to 7pm, but the chef still accommodated us. 

The three course meal was served bento box style, with even the dessert on the plate. I can see how this is a convenient wham, bam, thank you ma'am option for people rushing to catch a Vegas show. 

I ordered the king crab and cous cous appetizer, osso buco entree and peach panna cotta dessert. While everything was tasty, portions were definitely on the small side, and nothing that blew me away. It wasn't the quality you'd expect from a Joel Robuchon restaurant. 

Service was pretty mediocre as well. Just because L'Atelier is the more affordable and trendy alternative to its sister restaurant, it doesn't mean it shouldn't put out excellent food and service too.

The Lion's Tail Tavern is a drink-forward, gaming bar with one of the best names around!

Billed as an American style cocktail bar with a Vegas twist, The Lion's Tail Tavern fits right in at Village Square.  It's a locals kind of establishment where I could easily see regulars coming to gamble a little while they get their drink on.  They are classier than the typical Vegas neighborhood bar, but still maintain a warm genuine feel. 

The Lion's Tail Tavern is straightforward in their approach--serving quality drinks (with some elevated options), lots of seats for gaming, big screens to watch the game, and of course... Golden Tee to keep things real.  Those familiar with this area of town may know Danny from Three Angry Wives.  One of the nicer bartenders around, he knows how to take care of players and is now the general manager at TLTT.

I also understand that you will be able to order from Bachi Burger (next door) to satisfy your hunger needs, and that they will bring your food over to you!

I don't frequent gaming bars, but had an enjoyable experience here.  5 stars for drinks, gaming, viewing and purity of focus.  If you're not into gaming this is probably not a spot you'll be dying to come back to, but if you're looking for another option to incorporate into your weekly routine they are solid option to play on West Sahara.

I have been somewhat flummoxed over how to rate Which Wich.

I believe Which Wich does a nice job making a pricey average sandwich in a quirky feeling store (see photo of the Arrows).

We have been here several times and came yesterday after receiving a coupon by email for a free Regular (Small). My friend used my punch card for a free tenth one.  What that means is that they credit your bill for $5.50.

We both ordered the brown, thinly sliced roast beef. Which Wich defines their sizes as Regular 7", Large 10" and Super 14" You have the option of adding various veggies, or toasting it a la Quiznos. Like Quiznos, Which Wich weights how much meat you get and I would imagine that Regular has about 3 ounces. 

It's only a guess on my part since there is a five foot wall separating you and the person preparing your sandwich.  Why would you not want me to see how you are preparing my sandwich?

My friend's sandwich didn't weight that much when I picked it up.  I ordered the Large 10" (photo) with double meat (a $3.00 up charge). It felt like what a regular would feel like at Jimmy Johns or Jersey Mikes.  So you are paying $5.50 for a 7" sandwich which has about the same meat that Subway puts on their $3.00 six inch.  Yep I know, it's not really a 6 inches.  

In summary, that's $8.50 for a sandwich which would be $5.95 at Jimmy Johns, or $6.95 at Jersey Mike's (all prices do not include taxes).  Good thing they were comping me $5.50. LOL

My suggestion...  drive a little further down FLW to get a better sandwich and a better deal. Sorry.

Went to FEZ for happy hour to kick off my last night being 39, and it was my 1st time to the FEZ, I have driven past it so many time the past few years, so I thought it was about time to stop!

I made reservations because I had a group coming with me, and everything went smoothly! My plans for the day sort of changed, so I wound up being at FEZ 30 mins earlier than I had originally planned, but they already had my area set up and ready, so I just waited there for everyone to show! Staff was so nice and friendly!

I ordered a pomegranate margarita with a sugared rim, and it was perfect!! And very eye catching too! I also tried some of their sweet potato fries, and boy are those yummy!! And tried the pomegranate press too, and what a pleasantly surprising drink that was! 

Happy hour with friends went great! Look forward to coming back and trying out some other drinks, I know for sure I want to try that Dark Chocolate Martini!!

From Chef Marc Sgrizzi of Parma comes an outstanding pizzeria.  Wow!

Note:  This is the sister restaurant to the original opened in Centennial under the name Novecento Pizzeria.  Same menu, same phenomenal quality.

Chef Marc's passion for sharing his craft shows.  Truly Italian.  It results in great food and a light atmosphere.

The pizzas are crafted in the Napolitano way as set forth by the Italian government.  Personal pizzas, 11 inches in diameter, thicker crust than Roman pizzas baked in a wood burning (they use almond hardwood) at 900 degrees  for literally 90 seconds.  The extremely glutinous 00 flour from Campania  creates a very chewy, well blistered crust.  

Sauces are well made, with the classic crushed San Marzano tomato puree being very good; not to thick with sweet, acidic tomato goodness.  A spicy version has good heat and chili flavor.

Toppings are designed for the quick cooking.  Quality throughout with excellent house made sausage and its hints of fennel, moist and toothsome meatballs, sweet seasoned eggplant, tender artichokes and fresh mozzarella.  Of cause, being America and being trained by a place whose slogan was "have it your way", there are a large number of other toppings that can be added.  Want peaches, figs, pineapple, even smoked salmon and pesto, go for it.

Simple starters including a delicious chopped salad loaded with salami, oven roasted peppers, and gorgonzola and dressed in a zesty red wine vinaigrette, oven roasted escarole and beans dressed in olive oil and house sausage.  

Very friendly counter staff.  No waiter service.  

Despite its greatness, authenticity, and low price, it is still eclipsed by Settebello Pizzeria Napolitano with slightly better seasoning, crust flavor, quality toppings, ambiance, and wine program. 

Regardless, Wow!

UPGRADE TO THE TOWER ROOMS!!!

if ur main goal in vegas is to eat eat eat, sleep sleep sleep, gamble and more eating, your room might not be of the most importance if your budget is ruled mainly by eating good food. For me: I just wanted a decent place to stay, close to the City Center, without spending a fortune on a room, that i would just use to sleep and shower. We took advantage of booking early to a discount and I spent about $230.00 for a fri-mon stay. The upgrade says Widescreen TV, but we didn't really care about that- the main difference from the other rooms is that it looks a little more modern. Beds were decent and comfortable : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o7AiTlyWUrBSzdz6oMHj5w?select=hEzxVsEJzj4_Bdm1CJoQFQ
Bathrooms were clean. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o7AiTlyWUrBSzdz6oMHj5w?select=ez1T5FamJ8MzAvyp94Zueg
I have crashed in some pretty ugly looking hotel rooms in vegas, and for the price and convenience, it was pretty decent! 
Check in was smooth, signing up for the Mlife playing card was a breeze since i registered ahead online, staff was friendly, but slots were not. 
They have a convenient food court http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/o7AiTlyWUrBSzdz6oMHj5w?select=mvxEq1vTcSsHPYC5Kzwrnw.
There's always Thunder From Down Under (been twice for bachelorette parties!)- which is pretty decent too!

I always enjoy coming to the Market Cafe.  The staff is always really friendly and I love how they have happy hour every day from 3-close.  HH includes $5 pitchers of beer and $5 cocktails.  

Last night was the first time I had dinner at the Cafe.  Normally when I come it is either for HH or for breakfast.  Well I had the Rachel sandwich that had coleslaw, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, house dressing, melted on sourdough. WOW, that sandwich was amazing.  I'm glad I finally had dinner here.  I definitely be coming back to try something different.  Also my favorite cocktail drink is the Lee Trevino and my favorite breakfast item is The Rooster Booster.  

If you have not been to the Phoenix Public Market Caf you are totally missing out.  So, when you are in the downtown area and wanting something to eat or drink.  You should totally come here.

The 9th Island:  Portuguese sausage, spam, jalapeos, pineapple and mozzarella pizza?  I'm so there!

Enter Buddha Belly Deli.  Aside from the odd tribute to Hawaii, essentially a mish mash of Asian flavors creating new Asian comfort food in Hendertucky.  And it's good.

In general, individual components to each dish are well made with the slightly over pronounced flavors.  Dishes lean towards South East Asia but with well controlled spice heat.  A series of house made chili sauces and concoctions can definitely make dishes thermonuclear without masking flavor if desired.

The pho dip lives up the hype.  A banh mi dipped in a flavorful beef pho broth.  Fresh baked roll loaded with five spice rubbed, rare, sliced beef and just the right amount of still crisp pickled been sprouts onions cilantro and basil slathered with hot, pungent Chinese mustard.  Simply put great eats.  The char siu pork roll equally good.  Juicy but not excessively fatty char siu topped with an Asian slaw and hoisin on a sweet bun.  Need I say more.  All sandwiches are accompanies by a side of their house made chips that provide a great textural contrast and neutrality between bites of the flavorful offerings.

A very good clam.  Basically tom yum kung with clams.  Aromatic, herbaceous, rich and warming.

The fries topped with Japanese curry (no coconut milk or aggressive spices of Indian curry) and a fried egg and strips of nori (laver), is and outstanding take on the Midwest classic.  Creamy, messy, and just plain good.

Finally, dragon breath fries.  Not spicy but a good wallop of garlic will remind you of its goodness for hours.

Although not destination worthy from the Strip, a great neighborhood, locals kind of fast food restaurant with a very friendly staff.

If you have a longish lunch hour, go.  I went around 5pm tonight and there was nobody in front of me.  Took me 5 minutes to get my fish burrito (Thanks to Chris T for the recommendation!)
It was HUGE and came with a little cup of two salsas: green and red.  I cut it in half to enjoy the salsas separately.  
Filled to the brim with rice, cheese, beans and the fish and smothered in some sort of sauce, it was delicious!  
Service was super-friendly and everyone had a smile on their face and said "Amy, your fish burrito is ready!"  I mean, the personalized service was great.  Maybe hitting them at a slow hour was what did it.  There is a little retail spot where you can get incense (they're hippies, get it???) and posters on the wall to peruse while waiting.  I took mine home, but the patio is lovely.  There's even a vintage bike parked out front with little baskets filled with potted plants.  How adorable is that????

Desserts is stressed spelled backwards.

After a long stressful day at work, desserts is the best cure.  After a great meal at a restaurant as fantastic as Yonaka's, desserts is a bonus.  You can say that I had the best of both worlds with my most recent visit to the Perfect Scoop and Boba Tea.  

As soon as I walked in, I'm greeted with a menu making me decide whether I get ice cream or boba.  How about both?  So, I asked the owner if anyone gets ice cream with boba as a topping.  He replied "Yes, only if you're young".  I thought that his response was hilarious, but at the same time not sure if he was implying I was young or old.  It didn't matter because I decided on getting ice cream with boba anyway.  I opted for a scoop of Butter Pecan, a scoop of Cappuccino, and topped it with Boba.  All of this was served in a green tea waffle bowl.  The ice cream is homemade here and it was simply delicious.  I love the taste of Butter Pecan ice cream combined with the taste of coffee.  You can say this was the perfect scoop.   The owner also hooked us up with some green tea which oddly compliments everything I had.  Come to think of it, I had exactly what the name of this joint portrays.  I had a perfect scoop, with boba, and washed it down with green tea.  

PS:  Love the "Asian Flavors"!!  I'm Asian and never knew I had my own flavor.  Well done Perfect Scoop, well done.

This show features so much pussy! 
And by pussy, I mean kitty cats. 
Sorry, I couldn't resist. 

Popovich Comedy Pet Theater runs mid afternoons Tuesday-Thursdays (closed Wednesdays) in the somewhat low budget, not too spectacular V Theater inside the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile shopping center. 

If you're a pet lover then you'll probably enjoy this show. Popovich personally trains every animal that appears on stage and what's even more impressive is all the animals are rescued.  

As far as the show goes, it's just a hair over an hour in length and has some pretty cool moments. Besides being an excellent animal trainer, Popovich is also an experienced juggler. 

However, there are quite a few dull moments in this show. Popovich also had a few guys in his show who try their best to entertain the crowd but they are nowhere near as entertaining as Pop. 
Also some of the animal segments are a bit boring. The highlight of this show is definitely when the cats are on stage. It's amazing that Pop has been able to train these kitties so well. 

Normal price of admission is about $42 a person. Luckily for my wife and I had a coupon for buy one ticket, get one free. I'm glad we had that because I would have benn disappointed if I would have paid $100 for this show. 

I don't regret watching the show, I actually had a pretty good time, I just think $100 would have been way too much for a not so amazing Vegas show. I'm so thankful we had that coupon. If you're an animal lover or are looking for a kid friendly show, check out Popovich and his show.

Try saying Bobby Q three times really fast in a southern accent. It sounds like you're saying Barbeque.

I can't believe that I've been living in this area for a few years and I just started patronizing Bobby Q's. There's definitely a happening vibe to this place after dark. The place is packed and the air is buzzing with conversations and laughter. They have ample seating inside and outside. We met some friends that have never been here a few weeks ago and they became instantly hooked.

We ordered steaks, pulled pork, ribs and brisket. Everything along with the sides were fabulous. My brisket was tender and the flavor instantly transported my taste buds to a happy place. The pulled pork was equally as good. I've had the ribs on other trips to Bobby Q and have always enjoyed them. I got a big thumbs up on the steak from my dining companion so I'm going to have to try that next time I'm in the house. The tab for four people without alcohol and before tip was $70. 

This is definitely my favorite BBQ place in the metro area.

I moved from a condo to a house 6 streets away but wanted to use movers to move the heavy furniture. I found the glowing reviews on Yelp and decided to give them a try.

I called to schedule my move in date 5 days before my move and they were able to accomodate. The representative on the phone was very nice and knowledgable, explaining everything about the process and an estimated cost based on the size of my condo and number of furniture.

They called a couple days before the move to affirm the date and time, and then the movers called an hour before the scheduled time to let me know their arrival time. The movers were all very professional, very nice, and very attentive. Any items they weren't unsure about where to place it, they asked before moving it in. They also moved a couple pieces of furniture around since I wasn't completely sure where I wanted everything to go.

Finally, I decided that morning that I wanted to switch out the washer and dryer between the condo and the house. Without hesitation, they said they'd be happy to do that, so they swapped them out and hooked them up in the two places without any complaints.

Given that I was only having them move my furniture and I moved all my "stuff" myself, I did think it took them quite a while to move everything, but that's because they wrapped all pieces of furniture in plastic wrap before loading them on the truck and were very careful with all my furntiure. I had an antique large bookcase that they successfuly moved without any wear or tear.

If you're looking for a cheap and quick place to move your stuff, this is not the company for you. But if you have good quality furniture that needs gentle care in moving between two locations, I would definitely recommend them.

Have you ever gotten an orgasm from peanuts?  No?  Well, I just did.
Number 27.  Medium hot.  Went with Robert M & Bacon for dinner tonight and we each got a dish to share.  Started with the fried tofu.  Bland.  the sauces were watery.  Also got shrimp rolls.  Yummy.
In all, we had a red curry (#26) which was good, but it seemed as if the green beans had been frozen then cooked.  Also, the #34, medium spicy.  Had a peanut taste, a little sweet.  And then: #27.  (angels singing) Now, I don't know the names of any dishes.  I always order by number.  When it came to the table, I drooled all over my white shirt.  And, well, something else in my white panties.  Amazing!
Service was quick and friendly.  I love that it's RIGHT ON McDowell.  Tables face the street, which you don't get very often here in the PHX.
My leftovers are in the fridge.  Since I'm single and need the *ahem* effects of #27, I'll be having it before bed.  As a snack.  To get ready for bed.  #27.  Marry me.  I'll be the first person to marry a number.

Oh how I love wine country... and now, thanks to Oakville Grocery, we've got our own little taste of wine country right here in the Valley!

While I anxiously anticipated the opening of this unique little gem, I finally made it in for a visit over the weekend... and there isn't too much more to add than what Aimee and Linda already wrote.  (Those bitches beat me to the punch!)

While I went in just to get a drink and check it out, I wanted to yelp about it sooner than later so more people will know about this recently opened grocery.  I can say, without a doubt that I'll be back soon.  One visit to this place is not enough.  Their salads and sandwiches look fresh and delicious, their pizza and prepared foods do too.  I love their espresso bar area and especially that they carry Julia Baker Confections.  Whether you're looking for a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, a snack or a full meal, to dine in or to take out, this place has something for you.

While I'd much rather transport myself to the original Oakville Grocery in Napa Valley, I'll settle for Scottsdale Quarter in the meantime.  Cheers!

SUNDAY NIGHT FUN

I swung on in here while walking back to my room. I couldn't resist because of the lively country music that was coming out of this lounge. Vegas is full of entertainers and the band on this stage did not disappoint. 

It was a country band and they were playing very lively tunes. It probably helped that there was a girls weekend birthday party and they were all sporting wigs. The main guy on guitar was flirting away with them even doing a funny version of happy birthday. He was really working the ladies. I didn't stick around long enough to see if he scored. 

The rest of the band consisted of a drummer who did some great vocals. Look out Phil Collins this guy can sing. A lady on piano who was very talented with amazing vocals. I did find it weird that she was playing piano with a pair of red gloves on. I'm not sure why but she didn't miss a note. I really loved the fiddle guy but the stage was so small he had to stand near a blackjack table. Yes there are three gambling tables inside this tiny little lounge. You can not get away from gaming at this casino. 

So if your looking for a place to see some live music then I highly recommend this place. You will be kicking back and throwing your boots in the air not realizing it is way past your bed time. Nobody really sleeps in Vegas! Do they?

A real 4.5-star rating for lil' Baguette Cafe. If you're in the area (or work nearby), there's no better place to pick up a fresh 'wich, salad, or juice. The menu is small, so they don't spread themselves to thin here. That being said, theres something for everyone. Eggs all day, salads (with various greens and meats), pastries and hot & cold sandwiches are all represented. I've yet to hit the pressed sammies, but The Turkey, crispy greens and egg baguette panini (w/ ham added) are enough to have me hooked. Everything tasted fresh and the portion sizes were perfect for lunch.

The real knocks here are the location (NOT easy to find from the road. Use the map in the Yelp app) and that the place is a bit small. When the queue reaches 4+ people, you might be waiting outside or right on someone who is eating. Avoid the lunch rush and you're money!

PF Chang's is a nice place to bring a client for a Lunch meeting.

Or, maybe I should say it's a safe place.  I came here recently and the food was as I had remembered it -- Asian inspired and quite good. 

They have some solid dishes like Orange Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Chang's Spicy Chicken (their version of General Tso's).  I love their Hot & Sour soup, and our family still remembers the first time they tried their Lettuce Wraps and Dan Dan noodles.

But over the years, it seems PF Changs has become a caricature of itself  Sometimes the service is good, as it was today.  Other times, it just seems as if the waitstaff is new and has never worked in a restaurant before. See Gabi's review from three years ago. Also, sometimes the food can be off, ie: dried or not hot rice, etc.  I'll end it here, since it looks like I've used up my allotment of the word 'sometimes'.

So, Three Stars "A-OK".  But, they're on my Watch List for a possible downgrade.

Visiting Paris Las Vegas is kind of like a trip to Paris, France. No worries, you won't need a guide book. Check yourself in, eat the food, use the wrong verbs, get charged double, and end up kissing strangers - or is that just me? Don't ask.

They say a lot of things about Paris ... it's a place to find inspiration ... a place to discover something new about life ... a place to find love. I say it's a place to discover your fate. Sadly for me, fate seems to be the Paris casino tables liberating my money in ridiculous fashion. Fate should be when people meet on a train or in a Paris cafe and not in line at the ATM machine.

Most people go to Paris, France to fall in love ... while at Paris Vegas, people go for the prime center-Strip location/views plus the good fortune of not having to actually talk to French people. 

The beautiful exterior with iconic Eiffel Tower, Montgolfier Balloon, and Arc de Triomphe are photo op spots un deux trois. Inside, the Casino is like a small French village under a sunny blue sky. Two restaurants with views are Mon Ami Gabi (patio view of the Bellagio Fountains) and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant (view of the Strip). Don't forget, you're either in a caf in Paris or a coffee shop in Vegas. 

Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino is a quaint charming theme hotel in the heart of the Strip, but without better luck at the tables or lower prices, my preference is other hotels in Vegas. Even so, we'll always have Paris ... at least until somebody builds the Berlin Hotel & Casino next door.

Ruben has been wanting to check the improved Gold Spike out for a while, but I've been hesitant - what was there to see? Well, I was wrong! It turns out I've been to Gold Spike during a Superhero Pub Crawl a couple years ago. The only thing recognizable now was the bar! What used to be a casino is now comfortable Love Sacs, modern furniture and decor, a bed, and various games. It's quite the transformation.

After admiring the area, Ruben and I settled down for a few games of Tic Tac Toe with a large version set on one of the tables. As we continued to venture, we discovered shuffleboard (deck version), cornhole, billiards, life-size connect four, and more. We also played a game of connect four, which we really enjoyed!

Another neat feature is an art installation by Miguel Rodriguez. You peer through curtained slots while sitting at a "bar" and it's neon paint and objects against a black backdrop. You may also be able to go inside?

The best part of this newly renovated Gold Spike is definitely the "Backyard" as they've coined it. Complete with synthetic grass, patio furniture, fire pits, additional cornhole games, life-size jenga, life-size beer pong, bullet trailer, and "Cold Spike," their ice skating rink. Admission is $10 and skate rentals are $5, but I read that this is an all-day price like The Cosmopolitan. The rink looked nice and it's large compared to the others in town, however, I heard that it's not really ice! Which makes sense why they haven't shut it down yet and have no plans on closing it for the season until they figure out their next move (the attendant shared that it's possibly being converted into a roller rink). The furniture was rather dirty, so I didn't take the chance of sitting down, but we really enjoyed a game of life-size jenga! Make sure you wear shoes or run quickly when it falls! 

Overall, really cool place to chill with friends and grab a couple drinks. The only mood killer was the smell!! It reeks of bad bathroom freshener that was trying really hard to mask (rather than eliminate) odors, but failed miserably. It was hard to stay inside for a long period of time and you could still smell it while in the Backyard as well, though not as bad.

I want to warn everyone out there to NOT use this bakery for any special event!! I ordered 100 cupcakes for my recent wedding and confirmed my order (including the remainder of payment) with Slade, the owner, one week before. Slade assured me that although he would be out of town on the day of my event, my cupcakes would be delivered to the wedding site the morning of the ceremony/reception. On the day of the wedding, however, there were no cupcakes! They never showed up. According to a bakery employee (the day after the event), the person responsible for bringing them did not have a key to get into the bakery, as the locks had recently been changed. I can understand that these things happen, but what really upset were two things... 1)no one from the bakery bothered to call us or even the location where the wedding was held to help problem solve a new dessert; we were left on our own to scramble at the last minute. 2)I had to call Slade (when I returned from my honeymoon to NO message from him and NO refund of my money as of yet) to insist upon my money back. And, to add insult to injury, NOT ONCE did he ever even apologize or attempt to express even the slightest tone of remorse for the troubles his business caused us on my wedding day. If anything, he sounded taken aback that I was upset and put-out at my insistence that the money be refunded that day. I have never dealt with anyone who so blatantly cared less about his customers! I repeat... DO NOT USE THE WICKED WITCH BAKERY FOR ANY SPECIAL EVENT! 

One additional note... I called Slade back on Thursday (10/30) as no credit had yet showed pending on my account. He informed me that he had not put it through on Tuesday (as he had promised) but had "just done it this (Thurs) morning." When I stated that I was perturbed that he had not found it a priority to refund my $$ for services that his business did not provide, he became defensive and nasty once again and basically hung up on me! He called me back about an hour later (all nice and sweet this time) giving me the credit invoice numbers and told me that he "had just put them through." Sooo... not only did he not bother to refund my money the first time as promised, but then he lied to me about having done it Thursday morning before my call. This man can not be trusted!! I don't know about the rest of you Yelpers, but I think business integrity is more important than cupcake taste. I plan to stay faaaaaaaaaaar away from the Wicked Bakery.

Tourist trap alert!  Tourist trap alert!

That's what first came to mind when I dropped by to have lunch in the awkwardly-capitalized Gordon Ramsey BurGR in the Planet Hollywood hotel.

Even at 11am -- before the doors had even opened -- there was a *massive* line at the front door, wrapping along the ultra-sleek fire-and-glass exterior and extending into the casino.  My heart sank a little, since the prospect of a 3-hr wait did not appeal to me whatsoever.

The good news was the wait was only 5 minutes.  I skipped the line and went straight to the bar, which has open seating and serves the full menu.  (I recommend the bar to everyone trying to eat here.)  The interior is absolutely gorgeous, with no expense spared to make the atmosphere contemporary and hip.  Even the utensils are high-end.

The menu is long, and the portions are massive.  It's very easy for your eyes to overestimate your belly's capacity here, so choose wisely.

For lunch, I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and a side of Maui parmesan onion rings.  I was bummed at just how average they were.  The burger tasted like jalapenos and grease -- and nothing else.  I couldn't discern the beef, the cheese, nothing.  And at $14, this burger was wickedly overpriced.  I ate about half the burger before I didn't want any more.

The onion rings were better, but not by much. The crisp was nice, but the dish was underseasoned.  No salt, no pepper.  The dipping sauces helped a bit.  I preferred the aioli.

Service was fast.  Very fast.  Fast to the point that I was being rushed out of there.

I'll skip this tourist trap next time.

Maybe it was just an off night but I'd have to agree to disagree with all the glowing reviews of this place. I think people might be fans because of the HUGE wraps. I saw them making one and I was amazed at the portion size! But lots of food ain't my style... especially if it is lots of crappy food! Tasted both of the shawarmas and they were drier than the Sahara desert plus gristle. Adding tons of tzatziki couldn't even save my meal. Their food didn't seem fresh to me at all, which is one of their selling points on their website. Either things have gone downhill, or it just wasn't in the cards for me tonight. I was really disappointed with their food and what I ordered. I really wanted to like Parsley Mediterranean Grill since it's local and I heard good things but I probably won't be back. The extra star is for the service and the chocolate dessert as both of those were good.

Potbelly's makes a tasty little sandwich for $4.80, and an even better one for $5.00.

I was here today with some friends for their Pre- Grand Opening slated for tomorrow. A suggested donation of $5.00 went to Scottsdale Christian Academy Baseball Team (see photo). After giving my donation, I won a free shake on their spinning wheel.  All the places were food items.

Potbelly is a yummy Midwest sandwich place that has live music in all of their shops.  The older locations have tall ceiling where a banjo, or guitar player sits on the top of the booth area while playing away.  This location has a guitar playing in the corner on the right as you come in. Very cool.

As for the food, Potbelly is known primarily for their their Wreck sub which is $5.00.  It's made with salami, roast beef, turkey and ham along with swiss cheese. They also have two similar subs called:  "Italian" with capicola, mortadella, pepperoni, salami with provolone cheese, also $5.00; and a "Pizza Sandwich" which has many of the above cold cuts but with marinara sauce.  I've had both before and they are good too.

Those are their three upscale sandwiches for $5.00, but their regular ones for $4.80 are equally good.  I particularly like the Roast Beef (which I had today, see photo), but the Turkey Breast, Smoked Ham, Meatball are all delicious.  
  
I've been told by Jim their JV Manager, that their 30% larger sandwiches, called "Bigs", will be rolled out later in the year.  Nice. You also need to try their hand-dipped shakes and smoothies. Delicious!

Enjoy!

See the amazing family  attempt to eat vegan!! 
Watch the brave kids eat fake burgers!! 
Observe the care and balance of the waiter/server/host  who attempts to amuse the meat eating group as they  balance the high wire of going green! 

We had a fun and adventure trying out the local vegan place that we would love to love.. but it's just not  in our future. 

Fresh and bright inside , the decor screams: I am earthy , and healthy and well thought out .  I give it two thumbs up for the refreshing design. ( except that blasted TV with "SuperiorMaster"  TV channel from a Satellite Planet located somewhere near the moon of vegan. 
The place was empty at 4 , I hope they have more business later , they really need a better location and more informative signage. 

We gave a shot trying out Vegan burger with fries, they tasted okay from all accounts but not enjoyed. My husband had the only winner at the table "Cha Cha Chicken"  tasty and good texture. I would order it if you made me go back . My meal was the loser ..it had 5  fake shrimp and big huge bright green bean pods ..very snappish ..I felt well Beaned.  
 Youngest kiddo avoided the whole adventure with a bowl of 
rice ..wimp. 

We all decided if we were vegan we would like this place and be happy to come back .. but we are  steak loving, dairy drinkers with our eyes on the leftovers in the fridge when we came back. On to another adventure!

OK I say they change the name of Open Wide Dental to Up and Died Dental. And I mean that in only a good way. Walking into this dental office is like walking into a boutique hotel lobby. Modern. Clean. Well designed. Warm. Light. Fountain. Massage chairs....

What? Wait. What?

Yep.

Massage chairs people. Far away from the sounds of gurgling, drilling and chunks of plaque and tartar hitting the wall, are two massage chairs in the second room off the main lobby. I thought, "probably going to be some cheap ass novelty chair". "Probably no better than the vibrating beds at Lita's Motel (hourly rates on the weekend!) in Champlain, Minnesota" (it was a prom thing, don't ask). These are state of the art baby and nearly put me to sleep. I went with Swedish and I believe there were two other options. What a brilliant idea. They told me some of their patients come early for appointments just to have a good massage. DONE!

Now the bad news is I need some work done. Ugh. UGH! Dental work. UGH!  Not only did I have x rays done, but a teeny, tiny little camera was in my mouth taking pictures. Pahleeze! If these walls could talk honey! The pictures were amazing to see. The details were, well, actually pretty gross. Ewww...

I was well taken care of by all. Seriously. Not only will I be VERY early to my next appointment (end of March in case anyone wants to join me in the next massage chair...you bring the champagne!)...but I may just book a room for the night.

Something tells me I would find a mint on my pillow. 

Yep. Up and Died.

This was my first time in Terminal 3 since I was flying Virgin America to LA and I do have to say that it's pretty awesome because it's new, modern, open, and spacious. Checking in is a breeze if you must do so. All the airlines are all lined up with awesome LED screens indicating each airline's specific counter. 

The security now has two separate lines - one for regular screens and individuals who have TSA Pre-Check. The TSA Pre-Check line moved pretty quickly even if it looks pretty long. Just remember folks, put all your stuff in your bag and don't have any metal like belts, coin change, etc. on your or in your pockets. It'll make the line move much more quickly!

After getting through security, there are plenty of screen to inform you of you arriving and departing flights. The terminal is pretty big with huge windows that let in plenty of light. In true Vegas style, there are slot machines around every corner in case you have extra time before your flight.

There are plenty of food options such as Pei Wei, Burger King, Carl's Jr., and Coffee Bean. I think there are a couple more options, but I noticed these just from looking for food. They also had your basic stores in case you wanted some snacks, reading material, Las Vegas memorabilia, etc. The bathrooms are also modern and clean, which is always a plus.

The terminal is very accommodating to tech savvy folks. There is free wi-fi for your use and there's also a dedicated charging station. It would've been better if there were chargers are each seat, but that's just me being picky.

If I have to fly to Las Vegas again, going through Terminal 3 would be awesome. It has everything I need to literally make the time fly! You will not be disappointed!

Thank heaven for Shirley B.!  I learned about Sheffield from her, and immediately planned to visit before the store closed today.  I zoomed over there at 6:40, with 20 minutes to spare.  I met the Sheffields who own this one and only shop.  Personally, I always felt Vegas was missing a Spice shop (well, and a tea shop after Two Sisters closed) and have been ordering my spices online from the Spice and Tea Exchange, which is a national chain that I discovered in Portland.  I order my tea from many places online so if you want to talk tea, that is another long discussion with me!

As for this place, it was exactly what I have been looking for - the Sheffields told me they get spices, salts, and sugars from the same distributor as S&T (though some of the rubs and other blends are different).  This store also has flavored and varietal olive oils.  Upon entering, I was offered a sample of strawberry green tea brewed and iced, which was refreshing.  There are many nice teas here, including matcha, genmaicha, and green jasmine.  The store carries several flavored teas as well.

There are tea accessories, saltkeepers, spice jars, bamboo cutting boards and other related items.  Over 200 spices are available here.  Because I have an enormous spice collection as it is and no extra room, I only got powdered lemon peel, roasted garlic chips, and Jamaican jerk blend tonight.  However, when I need something, I will definitely be back here instead of paying shipping online!  I did ask if the store has truffle salt, which it does not.  The Sheffields seem open to special orders if there is enough interest, so if I do run out I will ask for it, but for now I am truffly good.  I am really curious about the habanero sugar.  Who wants to try it first?

Warning: Douche Bag level CODE RED!

Here's how my experience went ... 

Me: "May I have a Carmel Latte?" 
Employee: "No"
.... dead air ...
Me: "Ummm why not?"
Employee: "We don't have carmel"
Me: "Ummm I guess I'll just have a Cappuccino then"
Employee: "Just so you know it's a REAL Cappuccino"
Me: "Okay" (in my head I'm trying to figure out if I can legally punch this dickhead in the face or not).

So I sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how he'll be moving to downtown Phoenix soon. To which I just chuckled to myself as this person was FAR from cool enough to blend into CenPho. What a complete and utter douche bag. Stay in Tempe poser (and keep your employer there to!).

This experience was months ago, and now they have opened up a shop downtown. Guess what? I'm not going to check them out. Fuck you Cartel. You'll never be Lux, so just stay in Tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you haven't earned.

Complete FAIL. 

For my two cents, skip this place and go to Lux in CenPho/Mid Town right off the Light Rail. Authentically cool with ZERO attitude, great coffee and no douche bag employees. 

And as for great coffee ... try Conspire WAY better coffee and authenticly cool.

---- 
please read "owners comment" below ... here's my response ... 
----
Wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner ... I guess my new job  should be to "promote good coffee in Arizona" ... and I don't appreciate good coffee because I enjoy the combination of caramel AND coffee ... 

By that definition I guess I don't know good ice cream because I like hot fudge on it or good pizza because I enjoy pepperoni AND cheese or good music if it's not acoustic or a good voice unless it's A cappella ... thanks for proving my point. I wouldn't go here unless you are a total coffee snob ... (I guess) they don't need your business you poser!

I had a little problem with the turbocharger on my car (and I think we would all agree that life without "turbo" is pretty nearly unbearable! :-)
Turns out the turbocharger wastegate solenoid was sticking...man I hate it when that happens! 
But my trusty mechanic at Radiator King (Steve may truly be an automotive genius) quickly, expertly (and inexpensively:) diagnosed and repaired said wastegate solenoid while I went and enjoyed lunch!
Delightful!
I wandered across the lot trying to decide between Andreoli Italian Deli and Vermont Sandwich Company.
I decided on VSC, because when you think about it...a whole company, devoted to sandwiches! :-) 
Geez! What a good idea!
What if other companies devoted themselves to what they say they do?
What if US Air and United Airlines were really in the business of expertly flying people around?
What if GM and Chrysler were  truly in the business of building adequate and serviceable vehicles?
What if AIG had actually been in the insurance business?
What a world this could be.
Happily, VSC is the real deal. 
Their devotion to sandwiches and the related accouterments is real and touching in its sincerity:)
Walking into the establishment, you are confronted by an almost overwhelming array of choices...fear not, they will (with a smile, BTW:) help you navigate through the menu.
The place itself is very "Vermonty"...an eclectic blend of painted 2x4 stud walls and 2x4 tchotchke shelves with all manner of toy cars, salt and pepper shakers, small pictures, etc.
That's juxtaposed with Deadhead posters, Phish memorabilia, Dave Matthews Band paraphernalia and Live In Brooklyn playing in the background.
I ordered a "Long Trail", a very Vermonty reference to the Green Mountains of Vermont and the hiking trail through those mountains (an incredibly beautiful hike, if you ever get the chance:) with a frosty hand squeezed lemonade...lunch as it was meant to be:)
The Long Trail is a softball size wad of house roast beef, shaved super thin and served on 9 grain bread (in my case...I don't really care for sourdough, but VSC will happily customize for you:), with fresh tomatoes, lettuce, horseradish mayo, pickles, gruyere and...wait for it...crumbled bacon! 
It was a nearly perfect roast beef sandwich!
It came with potato salad...really good potato salad!!...not far from what I would make for myself:)
A word about the sides at most sandwich shops...that word is "crap":)
Too often the sides are, at best, uninteresting afterthoughts...at worst, something inedible, bought in 55 gallon drums from Costco:(
Not here!
They make their own potato salad, slaw and pasta salad...all are fresh and tasty!
I felt like I had taken a pleasant little trip to Vermont in the summer and found myself a great little sandwich place off the Long Trail...and I didn't even have to endure the garbage scows of the skies at US Air to get there:)

What I am about to say is going to be both hard to believe and incredibly shocking, but true. Completely, utterly, and brutally honest. Ready?

I would rather Z Pizza than any other thing on this planet. More than food, fame, wealth, love, sex, beauty... need I go on?

I have heard some less-than-stellar things about Z Pizza, so I have been giving my business (not THE business) to Pizza Heaven, but one fateful night I took an elevator ride with a Z Pizza delivery man who explained that they have both gluten free crust AND vegan cheese. It was awkward being that I had a Pizza Heaven equivalent literally right in my hand, but the delivery dude handled it with poise and handed me a magnetic business card.

Well, today it is rainy and I'm drunk and I was hungry and I didn't want to drive, so I gave Z Pizza a chance and I am so happy I did because my life changed today. 

Let me repeat that: MY LIFE CHANGED TODAY

This pizza, despite it being abnormal in every way possible, was the most delicious culinary specimen I have put in my mouth in MONTHS. Get the Mexican (sans chicken and sour cream, of course)... you owe it to yourself. You really, seriously do.

I love this pizza so much that in future trysts, I will fantasize about this pizza instead of my lover. I really will.

I hate this review because I cannot even articulate the words to do this pizza justice. I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy!

Oh, and PS... when I ordered they told me 45-60 minutes and it was here within 30. That's better than finding a rich guy that dresses well, doesn't have mommy issues, and is straight up hung. 

Did I just say that?

Can I just say.....

Expedia dot cooooooooooooooooooooom

Hell-to-the-yes! I'm totally and completely in love with Expedia. I am a walking advertisement for that website and the customer support there because of the trip I just took to Vegas. After scavenging the World Wide Web for deals to Vegas for a friend's birthday I came across a few killer packages through Expedia. I ultimately called to speak with an agent and told him what we would like to spend. In about 15 minutes he had us booked in a JR Suite at the Signature at MGM, a brand new hotel that consists of three towers, 2 of which are for hotel guests and 1 for residences. Our room was on the 29th floor with a view of the strip and the room was absolutely amazing. The hotel is just off of the strip, however it is connected by an underground walkway that spills out into the MGM pool and casino entrance, as well as the entrance to the monorail. The hotel was lovely, the JR suite had a kitchenette, huge bathroom with his and her sinks, jacuzzi tub, plush, comfortable king-size bed, a Starbucks in the lobby, and three pools to choose from. The main pool is located in Tower 2, along with the Delights Cafe and each tower has it's own lobby lounge. For the price (about $200 per night), and the gracious staff, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The only thing I would mention is that they do require a $350 pre paid incidentals fee upfront that can be used to charge back food/drink to your room. Any remaining balance is then credited to your account 5 - 7 days after your check out.

I've had the chance to visit Hakkasan and XS this past weekend and let me tell you that XS completely blows it out of the water on almost every level.  Sure Hakkasan has exclusive contracts with deadmau5, tiesto, and calvin harris but XS' 2013 residency lineup is nothing to scoff at: Porter Robinson, Knife Party, Avicii, Steve Angello, Eric Prydz, Afrojack, etc.   But an amazing club experience from a consumer's standpoint is more than just who comes on the decks at 1:30AM.  

There are a plethora of factors, both tangible and intangible, that these new clubs neglect that ultimately leads me to the conclusion that XS remains the best club in Las Vegas over Hakkasan and Marquee.  Here are a few reasons:

1) Hakkasan should be renamed Hakkastairs due to the massive amount of stairs that you cannot avoid and you MUST take to even get into the main dance floor.  This is also a major problem with Marquee's presale line as you HAVE to walk up like 10 flights of stairs to get to the main dance floor.  Have fun with that in your 5 inch heels ladies.

2) No outdoor patio area?!?!  Is this real life?  No pool? What is this 2006?

3) No gambling section?!?  No water fountain??  No I don't want to pay 9 dollars for your bottle of water.  And give me the option to play blackjack and lose $1000 but at least I get a couple free drinks.

4) With XS and Marquee, when you have a presale ticket, you never have to wait more than 10-15 minutes.   Hakkasan's presale line took approximately 1 hour. 

5) No re-entry stamps at Hakkasan....seriously?  But what if its just me and a couple of my guy friends and we get there at 9:00PM just to get stamps with the intention of coming back at a more reasonable Vegas club time at 11:30ish?  

6) Hakkasan was such a letdown that my friends and I left before the headliner even came on.  Hakkasan is like a nicer marquee (inside only as there is no outside to hakkasan).  To Hakkasan's credit, they have a very spacious dance floor and their production value of their lights and lazers is unmatched but a club experience is more than that and XS beats Hakkasan down badly when it comes to every other relevant factor

7) I've heard that Hakkasan charges 43% on top of your table minimum... Now I see how they are paying abnormally above market prices for deadmau5, tiesto, and calvin harris.  This is absurd.

Unfortunately the hype for Hakkasan was too big since it was supposed to be the XS killer but just like Marquee, they both fall very short of the top tier in which XS stands alone.

Now we get to see Light take its shot on Memorial Weekend.

TLDR; Hakkasan was overhyped and I was very underwhelmed.  XS remains the best nightclub hands down for a variety of factors.

For my 600th review, it seemed appropriate to write about the place that brought me to the scenic wonderland of the Midwest, The University of Illinois here in delightful Urbana-Champaign.

For a Southern California pseudo-hipster and person of color raised in Los Angeles and educated in San Diego, the U of I is a bit of a disorienting shock.  It's gigantic, yet full of personality and character.  It's also on some levels every stock stereotype about the 'college experience', from the pretentious architecture (that screams "we look like an East Coast college!!!  Bricks!!  Yay!!!") to the terrifying/amazing/astounding/bizarrely huge percentage of students involved in a Greek life that resembles in almost creepy detail the stereotypical movie depictions of said groups, to the absolute obsession Illini sports engenders.

I love a lot of it, with the fantastic resources, first class scholarship and immense potential.  I turned down Stanford and a few other 'name' schools as I was amazed and remain constantly impressed by their history doctoral program, and I'm thankful to be here for the education.  However, the location is a bit remote (although sometimes corn can be charming, I swear!), and there are some considerable issues here at U of I that have to be mentioned.

While the U of I is definitely a brilliant academic institution and a great place for meaningful exchanges of ideas, diversity is weak here, and cultural understanding/communication is particularly weak.  The issues surrounding the infamous mascot linger on years after its supposed resolution, and to be a person of color in central Illinois is occasionally a difficult and daunting prospect indeed.  I've been called the 'n' word already, and it's a hard place to process when there are screaming groups of students that have been known to have 'tacos and tequila' parties and still openly ask for the return of a racial caricature as a mascot.  It's daunting, but not insurmountable.

Most of the students I've met here are friendly, engaging, and generally cheerful.  They mean well, although it is *hard* to sometimes deal with racism either explicit or less intentional, honestly, and incidences like this year's vandalism of the Native American art exhibit outside the culture houses are emblematic of that.

That said, the school's trying.  The people of color are vibrant that are here, there is a good community, and it's growing.  I'm thankful for that.  There's a strong organizing tradition here.  People *care* about things, and it's nice to see.

A year after accepting their decision to come here, I don't regret it one bit, but Illinois is far from perfect or ideal.  It's a fantastic and wonderfully intellectually rigorous place, but it's also a daily challenge, particularly for us people of color who often have to fight to make our own spaces.  But I love it enough here to keep trying, and I certainly won't stop any time soon.

Besides, I've got at least another four years to go 'til I get to be Dr. Teej.

When in Rome, eat pizza.

If you're in Buffalo, NY, you must have wings.

West Tropicana and Jones Blvd??  Chicken fried steak.  

I'll call it CFS from here on out but "Chicken from Satan" might be a better acronym.

It's rare that I get out of bed early enough on a Sunday to check out any of the dizzying array of excellent brunches around Vegas.  So when my first 2 planned spots went to hell, I chose to eat my feelings at the Black Bear Diner.  Anyone that works here will tell you that CFS is the most popular dish.  They were coming out of the kitchen and into the packed dining area like an assembly line.

Beef that is breaded and deep fried like chicken is kind of a mind blowing thing for non-Americans.  I had to repeat how my entre was being prepared to my Japanese wife twice.  It was a lot to wrap her head around and it should!!  According to BlackBearDiner.com, the CFS with hash browns, gigantic biscuit and 2 eggs totals 1580 total calories, 70 grams of fat, 20 grams of saturated fat, 4870 mg of sodium and 170 grams of carbs.  Holy....fucking.....shit.  This is the exact opposite of Crossfit.  CrossFAT!!

Funny how "comfort food" always makes me feel like death at the end.  Good thing the urgent care center across the street stays open late.

Dear Chef Ramsay, are we not worthy?  

Gordon Ramsay's pub features tasty Americanized pub grub.  It's too bad because the British classics are so much better.

The food.  Fish and chips.   Perfectly cooked, moist cod encased in a crisp crust.  Win!  The chips?  Excessively large, like fried baked potatoes.  They are fluffy and delicate in the middle.  Feminine chips!  A good, vegetal but sweet mushy peas complete the dish.

The Sheppard pie, Americanized.  The addition of beef to the traditional lamb mellows flavor.  The dish is no longer rustic and earthy.  The fat and grease (hey, its flavor) in the stew is gone.  It's been  replaced with a buttery potato crust.  Either way, it goes to your butt.  Tasty yes, but it leaves you yearning.

The pork belly roll is total pork heaven although much less fatty than the British counterpart.  Served simply in its own jus with roasted carrots and pea pure.  Done.

Finally, the beef short rib and cheek sandwich; TRY THIS!  Juicy, tender short rib is combined with the sweet goodness of braised beef cheeks.  Served on sourdough, accented by the very earthy flavors from the horseradish aioli, roasted pepper jam and onion marmalade. Win!

Passable selection of British beers that share space with butt wiper and the like.  High Vegas resort prices.

The dining space is contemporary with a Disneyland feel.  It's a pub by dcor not by the vibe of the guest you expect from a crowded, boisterous, friendly pub.  

If you're wearing a t-shirt that says "I love Las Vegas" go right on in.  This is your kind of place.

Where do I start? Cocktails! This joint has an entire section of their menu for Moscow Mule variations. 

That's it. End of review.

Nooo. I kid. 
But if you're a fan of Moscow mules take a Lyft here. Partnered with a drinking friend during Happy Hour we were able to sample four of the six available. All include ginger beer. $5 during HH!

Yes, FIVE dollars.
[Be still my heart.]

Happy Hour is sweet. Mon-Sat 3 to 7pm. If you come on Sunday a bottle of wine and pizza (or prime rib) is only $20. Monday 1/2 priced wine. Tuesdays offer $4 craft beers. 

My partner in crime narrowed our eating options to street tacos ($3/piece) and a $7 pizza. (What can I say? I'm a cheap date.) The tacos we had were amazing. I'd eat those again in a heartbeat. The pizza of the day was delightful.

This is a stunning restaurant. Outside seating for when the The Oven temperatures are not in effect. The bar has great seating. (You can comfortably enjoy a meal there.) Booths abound. Pink Pony has *tons* of baseball memorabilia. On the sidewalk is the original home base plate from the Scottsdale Stadium!

Being greeted like family at the door by the owner set the mood. I *adored* my visit to Pink Pony.

How do you give four women simultaneous (food) orgasms?

First take them to Vegas.  Then take them to Rio and stick them in a long-ass line, make them watch the same loud, lame show twice (and considering that show starts every hour, that gives you an idea of exactly how long that long-ass line was), and force them to see the same freaking faces all around them as they get hungrier and hungrier and crankier and crankier.  Basically the equivalent of taking them to see the English Patient on a first date.

When you have about 30 minutes to go, shake things up a bit by getting two of them hammered off one drink from the casino bar.  (After all, it doesn't take much to get them going if their stomachs are *that* empty. http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/wHN6nbeG3TPvQlEAq1jQKw/l)

Get them *just* to the point where they're saying, "goddammit, this better be damn good!" (http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/xg4EfS0b8ZOaYD0xwiBL1w/l)

...then let them loose.

No foreplay, NO FILLER!!!!!!

Get straight to the point and take these women to the CRAB LEGS.  We're not talking costco style, salty-yet-still-bland, cut up the side for easy access crab legs...we're talking succulent, taste-like-they-just-came-out-of-the-wild-Bering Sea amazing morsels of heaven.  

Seriously, food has never given me such pure joy.  Pure, pure, unadulterated crustacean-induced happiness.

My dearest Village Buffet, you were so memorable, almost 2 months later, I'm still trying to figure out how to quit you.

Like most west valley Asians would say, Great Wall is a staple.  I've been to Great Wall a hundred times for dim sum and banquet-dinners since I was  kid --- heck, maybe even since I was born!   It's hard for me to even imagine how my childhood would be like without Great Wall.

From before their renovations to days before the kitchen fire, Great Wall has always served up delicious food.  As it is the only major Chinese restaurant in the west valley, Great Wall is always busy with a flurry of customers at any given time of day.  They have delicious hot dim sum and they have an even more amazing 10-course dinner.  If you don't understand Chinese customs, this place will always be LOUD!  Chinese people are loud.  We like to hear ourselves talk over other people's voices.  I think it adds to the charm of the restaurant.  ;)

Great Wall specializes in a lot of authentic off-the-menu dishes like duck tongues, fried pork intestines with sweet & sour sauce, fried fish heads with eyeballs the size of golf balls, and all the other stuff probably not palatable to people who didn't grow up around these kinds of foods but it's all reminiscent of  majestic China.  *wistful sigh*

Anyways, Great Wall will always hold a soft spot in my heart.  From sweet karaoke-infused memories to visions of old people dancing to terrible Chinese music.  Cheers!

Mi Comida was the place picked for the International Supper Club UYE for September and I for one was excited to try them out!

As others have stated this place is small, and if you are in a hurry, then skip it all together.  With that being said, we all arrived around the same time, and Carlos, who I guess is the owner, waited on us, and I have to say Carlos was amazing, gave us all personal attention, took each person's order one at a time and yes the dishes came out that way as well. But I have to say this was one of the best dinning experiences I have had in a very long time. I enjoyed the fact that we were not rushed and that we all were able to carry on a conversation and enjoy some great food! So if you are not in a hurry and are looking for great personal service, this is your place!

I knew before I got there I wanted tamales! I have been craving tamales, but I didn't want the normal run of the mill tamales!  I ordered Tamale de papa, which on the menu said its made in the highlands of Ecuador, it was made with a potato cheese dough (hello this Irish girl loves potatoes!!) and it was filled with chicken, veggies and a slice of chorizo wrapped in a banana leaf, it was pretty darn tasty! Really enjoyed it!

I also ordered the Pastel Crillo De Pollo - chicken, veggies and aji chilli wrapped inside a pastry puff, this too was delish!!    I crave/love spicy foods, and Carlos brought out some aji sauce and said that it was spicy, for me, it was lacking the heat, but made up for the amazing flavor it had. That stuff is delish! 

Impeccable service, excellent food, amazing company, hope to be back soon!

I had a wonderful experience here. I needed a new pair of running shoes badly. I am in the process of getting back into it after taking way too much time off...... (like 3 years)  I know, pathedic. Sometimes liquor and sluts take precedence; don't judge.
Anyway, I decided to do this on my lunch break and I was out in about 45 minutes with the most comfortable running shoes I've ever owned. 

As stated in previous reviews, the staff is extremely friendly and they know their stuff. The structure of my feet were looked at as well as how I walk. I have never been fitted for running shoes before so it was kind of strange but I knew what to expect. I found out my calves are extremely tight and if I don't start streaching more/better, I'll end up with repetitive motion injuries.... good to know! 

I was presented with 3 different pairs of shoes to try out and in those found the perfect pair. I felt like an ass running around out front with the diferent shoes on in business attire but whatever... I found a great pair of runners so I'm happy. 

All in all it was an interesting experience. I will be back to pick up some more gear as soon as I feel truely committed again. Not once did I feel pressure to spend money or make a quick decision. As a matter of fact price was never even mentioned until I picked the shoes I wanted. Of course my feet have champagne taste so they chose the most expensive pair.

Shhhhhh!  Don't tell my friends but one of the hottest guys in the show was gay.  I didn't realize this until he realized I was gay and offered me his lap to sit on for the picture.  There's nothing really telling about the moment.  It was just a feeling.

As I sat on his muscular legs, I was like "umm...this Jaymes Vaughan fellow is such a sweetie pie."  Then it hit me, he's most likely a southern gay.

He was a great emcee, full of charisma, warmth, and humor.  Not that a straight guy can't be those things.  But...yeah.

And he was hot, way hotter than his pictures--which captures his body beautifully but not his face.  That's a good thing.  Why wouldn't you want the performers to be better looking live for a live show.

Pleasant surprise.

And at the end of the show, he gave me a shout-out for being the only guy in the audience and said I would totally get laid that night by one of my three female companions.  Awkward heteronormative moment but not in the annoying way.  My friends got a chuckle because they knew better.

I thought this show was going to be so cheesy and homophobic but it's quite gay-friendly.  Audience friendly in general.

Nothing trashy.  

Very suggestive.  

And lots of great naked butts.

Really great.  

Expect women to go crazy.

Really crazy.

If Chippendales is something you're thinking of going to see, you really just should!  Put this expected Vegas experience on your list and cross it off.  I didn't necessarily find all the performers hot, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.

Doesn't matter if the dancers are straight or gay, it's fantasy.  I've always been a fan of thinking.

Thanks Kristin for hooking us Yelpers up with a deal for the Yelp Spring Break.

I'm at tofu hut on a weekly basis and i'm surprised i havent gotten sick of this place!!! My BF & I mostly go during happy hour (after 10pm) and our orders usually consist of : brisket, regular pork belly, ribeye and marinated pork belly. My top fave is not included during happy hr and u have to pay extra (Short ribs). I noticed a decline in their marinated pork belly. I noticed during the last several visits, most of the meat is fat. Brisket comes in different thickness/length with each order, but still tastes the same. (Pls keep it long & thick!...."that's what she said....")..When we first started coming here, we didnt know if what they gave us was brisket or tongue coz it ALWAYS looked so different every time they brought it out....I am a HUGE fan of their salad...so flavorful! i'm not a big salad girl and this is a definite must have every time i eat here..My bf loves their korean pancakes and i am a fan of the japchae. Overall, good banchan.  Our servers are usually the same 2 guys at night and they are both so friendly, attentive and hard workers! 

This and Sura are my faves for Korean bbq...Honey Pig wasnt bad either!

What a great surprise, just around the corner from a closed Baja Fresh is Caf Rio Mexican Grill 

There's no comparison to that former Wendy's Mexican food concept. Cafe Rio is the real deal. 

We came here for lunch and then, since we were working late we came back to grab something for dinner.  It's crazy good.  It also wasn't as packed, but the food was really good. 

As you enter, you'll see that standard Mexican cantina decor. Tin lights with punch holes (photo) in them. Bright, very bright painted tables and beautifully made iron stone plates hanging on the walls. All very familiar, but nicer than you've seen before in other places.

After a few visits now, I've ordered most item on the menu.  My favorite?  Their Burrito, Enchilada style ($7.99) with spicy sauce and cheese on top.  Yummy!.  They have that homemade press (photo) working non-stop.  The Burrito stretches to fit, since it's so fresh and the dough hasn't become hard.  Love it.

Their Tacos ($2.99) are also good, as is their Guacamole ($1.99).  But you have to try their Lime-aide drink.  It tastes like a virgin Mojito!  BYOB I guess. LOL

Now I realize this is a chain, and therefore it might not be for everyone, but... a lunch here for $10.00, is a nice alternative to that other place with the corrugated stainless steel fetish.  You know who I mean.

Enjoy!

I appreciate French food and like it more than I should. 

I also love NOLA and their Laissez les bons temps roulern!

But, the French Grocery is really not a grocery store at all. You cannot buy any grocery items, like you might find in a typical Champion or Carrefour. No Carte Noire coffee, no Maille moutardes, et cetera

They also do not cook, nor serve food here.  Everything is pre-made, wrapped for sale and kept in a refrigeration case. The only exception is the bakery items and a small chilled salad deli case. 

When we arrived on Friday just before five, there were also very few items left in the refrigerator. There was no croissants, no french bread or much of anything in the bakery case except for some small $1.75 cookies.

There were a couple of small individual Quiche Lorraines (which didn't contain any bacon or ham) and a few small baguette sandwiches, like you would find in Gare du Nord. 

The French Bakery also has a wine section, along with a few French press coffee pots. As others have noted, the lighting is poor and makes the store feel dreary. There are a few tables scattered in this cavernous store. But I am unsure what they are used for since you cannot sit and eat any of the chilled items. 

I believe the French Grocery is set up to appeal to working couples on the go --who want something more interesting than the Take Out selection of Fresh & Easy.  Of the six items we ordered, the best was the chocolate Pot de Creme for $3.50. Our total including tax came to $32.11

But if you come to the French Grocery thinking of Le Pain Quotidien, Le Madeleine, or even local Amuse Bouche (Surprise), you might leave disappointed.   Sorry!

It was our second day in Vegas we wanted to get a pedi.  Although we were staying at the MGM we did not want to try their Spa and was looking to find a place off strip that was reasonable.  Yelp app to the rescue!  Found Elan Nails and Spa.  They didn't have a lot of reviews but the ones they did have were all really great.  

We came in about 11:30 and asked for a pedi.  We really would have liked to have done a mani as well but we were meeting friends at 1:00 and didn't think we had time.  The place is way off strip and more into the residential area and is in a strip mall.  It's a small place but they had about 6 massage chairs against one wall and the other side where they did mani.  The staff were all young and friendly.

Picked out our colors sat in the comfy chair and got our foot soaking for a good 5min before they went to work.  Let me say one thing about the chairs.  They massage your butt!!!   

My nail person Christina was awesome from beginning to end.  I didn't do the gel thing but the color didn't chip and had stayed on 2 weeks with no problem which show how well it was painted on.  The cost was very reasonable at $22 and they worked pretty fast.

Locale ~ Way off strip on the Westside!
Services ~ Nails, Facials, Eyelashes and Waxing.
Extras ~ Butt massaging chairs, woohoo!

Whyyyyyyy whhyyyy fat dumpling? Why you gotta do me dirty like that?! We could of had something. 

My boyfriend and I are hard core boba heads and we just needed our fix tonight. Being that it's our first time here, we even went as far as buying 3 drinks total between the 2 of us. You really let us down! Weak flavor, mushy boba, whack customer service - all terrible. 

Here's the story: 
I ordered the lemon honey green tea with half boba. Man, I didn't expect it to come out with the whole lemon, seeds, bitter rind, pulp and all. The wide boba straw slurped up all of the seeds every time I would take a sip. I choked on a few. Then I decided I couldn't go through with it, it just didn't taste right, and brought the drink back to the counter.

The guy was not having it. He told us that the drink is not for us to taste, but for us to buy... Whaaa? Wait huh? Accent or no accent, those are some fighting words mister. He then said he would pick out the seeds for us. Ugh. No, the drink tastes weird mister. It's not good. At all. 

He said he would not exchange the drink out for something else. We had to stand at the counter for a while and firmly tell him that we would like to have the almond milk tea instead, that the the lemon seeds were horrible. After a few minutes of going back and forth he then tried to exchange it out for a small almond milk tea with no boba. Lol. This guy is a character. So stingy! 

In the end he gave in and we got the almond milk tea with boba - woohoo an even (embarrassing) exchange. 

To my dismay, the drink tasted like a lot of hatred went into it. My almond milk tea tasted like pure powdered thick milk. That's the flavor I got. Why you gotta hate to hard?

Not to mention the other 2 drinks we got: durian slush and red bean slush - were super watery! Icy slushy ice is what we ended up getting. 

To be fair: they were clean inside, had a huge menu (they even have a vietnamese menu!) the drinks were cheap, not a sugar bomb, and they are open late!

Was in the Hendertucky area so I gotta take advantage of one of my bookmarks and it definitely did not disappoint!

I was greeted by a nice lady as soon as I came in. I told her that I was a first timer and that  I was gonna need a few minutes. She smiled and said there was no rush. Right away I felt comfortable being there.

While looking over all the wonderful creations they made, she explained to me that the items on the left side were refrigerated and needed to be consumed right away or put in a fridge if you are going home at once. The ones on the right can be stored at room temperature.

So I went with the Cannoli and the Blueberry Crumb Cake. I havnt had a good Cannoli in a while and it was a supposed refrigerated item so down the pipe it went. The Blueberry Crumb Cake was gone as soon as I brought it home. Both were delicious and the family was wondering why I didn't get more than I should.

Overall, I liked what I saw and ate. Some negative things to mention would be that the parking is limited to the street and just the fact that its kind of drive to Hendertucky coming from North Las Vegas. If you are in the area, it's a nice stop for you sugar addicts.

We had Melman bucks. So we came for dinner. Just four of us. But holy shit. They fed us like we we're three hundred pound men. Don't get me wrong. I love food. But there's enough, and there's just too much. We split a pasta as a first course. It was adequate, taste wise. But portion wise? How one person could even think of ordering it for dinner is beyond me. I would blow up. Wafer thin? I think not.

We followed with baked clams which were pretty darned good. I like to put a little finely grated lemon rind and romano in my homemade version. I tasted both in theirs. I may sue.

We moved on to a chicken saltimbucca, which was actually quite good. We followed with a salad. I could see the dissapointment in the servers face. When we only asked for espresso after, she seemed sad. 

I almost felt sorry for her. I guess she's used to people who live a week off the leftovers. We did, however, enjoy some very nice wine. So I think that may have made her feel a little better.

After finding out that most strip clubs in Vegas were 21+ (Yes, in Cali almost all strip clubs are 18+ due to alcohol laws) my gf and I had no choice but to come to this lovely hole in the wall. 30 dollars cover charge, not bad for Vegas you know? So I keep an open mind and take a step in..  

The real problem for me was that  there wasn't really any "stripping" per say. The strippers would come out in their bathing suits.. then go to the back, take it off then come out completely naked. WTF? Isn't stripping supposed to be sexy? Stripping done right is an art, but all these girls would do was come out naked and do the SAME moves. They would shake their asses around repeatedly and of course all the horn dogs would drool and think its the best thing on earth. Yawn.

There were also questionable role playing and dancing.There was an act of grim reaper.. Yes she came out in a grim reaper outfit (with the blade and all) I was confused and started laughing. There's nothing sexy about a grim reaper... Why not have a dominatrix or something that's more appealing? There was also a strange part where they layed a blanket out and poured candle wax on their bodies.. Kinky? Nope.... for some reason it was just gross. They were so unattractive, physically and personality wise. 

There were also 3 strippers that made a huge fuss on stage. They were wildly waving their arms around at each other because nobody tipped them while they were on their poles. They were all mad and they even went up to a guy and started yelling when he gave them two dollars. Then she proceeded to flip him off. Errr... people pay you to STRIP not to be a bitch. If you would just do your job and do it WELL, people would freaking tip you. Period. 

Overall, the girls were all around 6's. They were out of shape (stretch marks, pooches and tatts everywhere), unenthusiastic and looked miserable! I swear, some of them looked like they would rather go to jury duty then to be dancing at that club.. I don't know where this establishment got these "dancers" but for Vegas I was thoroughly disappointed. 

When I come back again in a few weeks (when I turn 21) hopefully I'll visit a real Vegas strip club such as Spearmint Rhino or Treasures.

Save your money for quality guys!

Bacchanalia, a festival of merriment and libations, a riotous tribute to Bacchus, the god of wine and ecstasy. Intoxicated revelry, drunken orgies...the Romans had it good.

Contemporary visitors to Caesar's Palace aren't so lucky. They must queue up before indulging at the Bacchanal Buffet by checking in at the self-service kiosks. A piece of parchment with a wait time will be dispensed. 

At 3 in the afternoon on a Sunday, our wait was CLVI minutes. That's fancy for 156 minutes, which is, in other words, 2 hours and 36 minutes. Within an hour and a half, however, they delivered a message that our turn was up, at which point we were allowed 15 minutes to come claim our spot.

The price for dinner was LVIII dollars and some change. You're better off not deciphering that. For those who put in the effort to understand it, you'll probably want to know, was it worth it?

If you just want to load up on typical buffet foods like crab legs and prime rib, you can be satisfied somewhere else and pay less. The draw of Bacchanal is their dishes, prepared with the attention you may find at a fine-dining restaurant.

Many of their selections come tapas-style, on a tiny plate or miniature pan that you take with you to your table. They even provide silicon finger tabs so you don't burn yourself as you grab. The seabass on wasabi mashed potatoes was outstanding as well as the shrimp on grits. 

As for seafood, crab legs were available hot or cold and cross-sectioned for easy extraction. Raw oysters were offered but only half-shucked, and they weren't that meaty. 

Dessert items were hit or miss, but the chocolate-filled beignets were exceptional, and the chocolate macarons were on par with the ones from a nice bakery.

Although the price and wait time may make the gods gasp in dismay and tumble out of Mt. Olympus, the quality preparations would satisfy the pickiest of the pantheon. The god of wine continues to inspire cult-ish gatherings, this time in the name of refined gluttony.

At the very last minute before driving to Lost Wages, I booked a single room at the Microtel Inn & Suites ($70 on Orbitz).  Having never heard of the chain, I pretty much felt I was rolling the dice with this one.  But since no true tourist in Lost Wages ever spends more than a few hours in the room, I figured, what the hell?  It can't be any dingier than my last stay at Excaliber.

Well, this joint (obviously new or newly remodeled) is light years ahead of the MGM, Excaliber, and even the Mirage in cleanliness and the bed and pillows are waaaay more comfortable.  Rooms are modest, but decor and amenities are up-to-date and modern.  Amenities range from flat screen Vizios, microwaves and even a mini fridge to store your booze in to drink before hitting the casinos.  They even do free breakfast until 9:30am!

However, the BEST part about this hotel is that it's 100% NON SMOKING, so you don't get that nasty smoke stench that (despite Febreeze) seeps into the walls, carpet and draperies over time (*ahem MGM!).  It's also a few miles just south of the main strip off of Las Vegas Blvd with simple, no hassle parking right in front.  This makes it super mellow for getting in and out.

Overall, I highly recommend this place if you 1) want to save on cash, 2) don't mind staying outside the strip, and 3) want a non-smoking, super mellow place to get in and out of during your weekend of ephemeral debauchery.

Note:  No King beds.  They only do Queen Sized.  Check out is at 12pm (not 11am like most hotels on the strip)!

In 24 hours...

You are committed to getting your dinner, midnight snack, breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, pre-dinner and dinner again.  Well, that was my original plan when I first heard about this deal but here's what really happened...

8:11pm dinner - Caesars Palace's Bacchanal Buffet.  This is the hottest spot in town for buffets right now.  If you decide to dine here, there is a supplemental charge of $15 on top of what you already paid.  And it's for each time you decide to dine here within 24 hours. (Retail value $49.99)

9:30am breakfast - Paris Le Village Buffet.  Such a darling place to dine at. (Retail value $20.99)

3:30pm lunch - Flamingo Paradise Garden Buffet.  All the grannies and pappies dine here.  I believe they are locals.  But they have an amazing desert spread and the food was not too shabby. (Retail value $19.99)

6:15pm dinner - Planet Hollywood The Spice Market Buffet.  We were still full from lunch but forced ourselves to sit and eat more crab and nibbled on everything else.  Since this was our last buffet stop, I made sure I enjoyed as much crab as I could squeeze into my already bloated belly. (Retail value $29.99)

Did I get enough to eat?  Yes
Did I get my money's worth?  You bet I did
Was the supplemental charge at Caesars worth it?  Yes, it was
Would I do this again?  Hell no!

We planned our entire day around making it to these buffets and it added in some unnecessary stress.  I did it, I loved it, I won't be doing it again.  But for those of you who love to eat buffets, then this is seriously the best deal in town.  Go for it.

Cost savings analysis!
Paid $49.99 + $15 = $65
Retail value $49.99 + $20.99 + $19.99 + $29.99 = $120.96
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAVINGS!!!!  $55.96 

OR

$65/4 meals = $16.25 for each buffet (winning!)

Just don't throw up afterwards, then you'll really get your values worth :)

I'm officially in love with Sol Y Sombra. I wasn't sure if I had room in my heart to love another tapas place, but turns out I'm shameless and can love many at one time. 

My visit to Sol y Sombra was on a beautiful spring evening. Mr. Hottie and I decided to go out on a date. There was a nice breeze so we chose to sit outside. We were greeted by a server that was QUITE enthusiastic almost to the point of annoyance, but hey he was friendly and attentive. 

We looked over the menu and I suggested that we order every single item on it. I was reigned in and made to pick out 6 dishes. We ordered the: 
*Tortilla Espanola -amazing, I could have devoured the whole slice by myself. 
*Brussels sprouts- I didn't like them. For some reason the cook must have gone crazy with the lemon. We sent them back. 
*Chilled Asparagus w/Romanesco sauce- YUM! Big thick spears of asparagus covered with a creamy red sauce. 
*Gambas a la plancha- LARGE shrimp with a garlic aioli. The shrimp were tender and juicy. Fantastic. 
*Skirt steak ala plancha with romanesco sauce- tender, juicy nice char flavor and more of that glorious sauce. 

We washed it all down with copious amounts of sangria and I was in heaven! 

I will CERTAINLY return to Sol y Sombra again! It was a relaxing spot with great food and good service.

We have a lot of snow falling here in the Vegas Valley lately! Shaved SNOW  that is! Frost Bites Shavery caught my attention when I read "Snow Cream" "Smoother" and "Black Sesame" and saw that Michael K's check was in Henderson!  I don't proclaim to be an expert of this dessert that originated in Taiwan but after trying Frost Bites Shavery's version, now we're talkin this is what shaved snow cream is all about.

Walked up and was elated to see Green Tea and Black Sesame flavors on the menu!  Mike the owner and creator was really gracious and offered samples of any flavors I wanted to check out. That's when I discovered the difference between here and the other place. Frost Bites Shavery is the REAL DEAL!

When it was presented to me, it was in ribbon like layers, even looked fluffier and no granular ice crystals like I had at Kuma's. Frost Bites Shavery was way smoother and texture reminded me of fresh fallen snow. It's NOT Snow Cones or shave ice..but a mixture of the two, hence shaved snow! Big plus it's all natural, you won't go into sugar shock from having flavored syrups drowned in ice.
 
Taste wise the flavors I tried ( Mango, Green Tea, Coconut, Black Sesame) had much more depth. Especially the Green Tea. Black Sesame fans will really appreciate this, Mike said he roasts and grinds the black sesame himself.  In fact, all ingredients used to make snow cream are all natural including fresh fruit used to make the Mango snow cream! Which tastes fresh and fruity!  No canned fruit for topping either. That's why Lychee is missing. Can't get it fresh, so they passed on it.  Other flavors I saw were Coffee and your traditional flavors of Chocolate, Strawberry and Vanilla for those who aren't the adventurous types.
 
Price: In line with all the other icy treat stands in the area. Range from $2.25 - $6.25 toppings additional .50 cents.  There are four different sizes. I appreciate they have a kid size for the little ones.
 
Location: Along Boulder Highway between Major and Greenway/Palo Verde. You're reference point is the marquee for Smith's Grocery. It's a freestanding structure. You'll see the pastel blue and white trailer/food truck right on Boulder closer to corner of Greenway/Palo Verde.   Plenty of parking. There's a canopy for shade and a couple of chairs.
  
This snow cream is tastier and  healthier can't beat that! I'm a fan!  Five Stars most def!

It may be Tryst or Pure or whatever "Sexy name" club on the strip for you during your Vegas trips, but for for a dive barrin' gal like myself, it's the Double Down. ...well at least it is from now on.

Always expecting dives to be at list a smidge too hot and muggy, I was pleasantly surprised by a blast of cool A/C when I walked in and remembered that A/C is an absolute must everywhere in Vegas - even in dive bars. 

And it is a dive. Through and through and through... although with surprisingly clean floors. In fact, after reading about the Double Down and having knowledge of a drink called "Ass Juice," I was actually surprised at just how clean the Double Down was. DOn't get me wrong, it's not pristine, but they keep it in pretty good shape. Must be due to all that puke insurance they offer.

"Puke insurance?" you ask. Yes, puke insurance. For a mere $20, my friend - if you puke, you are not responsible for cleaning it up. Somehow I don't think this is offered on my AAA policy. 

Now, on to the (in)famous drinks. The Double Down falls under my philosophy of "Just because it's the 'original' doesn't make it the best." And that's sadly how I felt about the "original" bacon martini. It wasn't that bacon-y... but at least it was super vodka-y, so you get your $6 worth. 

The ass juice... well, I was thinking of it wrong. When I hear "ass juice," before you're even finished saying the words, I'm already grossed out. So I was expecting something pickley and briney and gross... turns out it's a girly drink with peach schnapps in it. I've decided that it's gotta be called ass juice, as in "Dude, I'm going to get so much ass with this juice."

Strong drinks, ridiculous names for drinks, puke insurance, semi-surly barkeeps... all things for a strong 4-star dive. What bumps 'em on up to 5? Pinball. Not just any pinball - the Playboy Pinball machine. One of my faves. I was bummed that the flippers didn't quite work all the time, but I'll take what I can get... plus they had a photobooth and pool to add to the mix too.

Next time I've been wiped out at the Blackjack tables in Vegas, you'll know where to find me.

ToGo isn't quite the new kid in town, but they are trying hard to make a go of it in the Valley.  

ToGo's origins are NorCal, with a huge following there.  Here, they've met with mixed results so far, closing some locations including one in Scottsdale. 

Their choice of locations have been somewhat puzzling, with no natural customer base like a school or large office park nearby. The other nearby Togo's location (Chandler/Tempe border) is tiny and shoehorned next to a Fry's.  I've driven past it many times not knowing it was there, but this one is much larger. 

My two co-worker and I made a trip here for a late 1:30 lunch one Friday. There was only five or six other here. So it gave us time to chat with the Manager and have him give us a nice introduction and overview to Togo's.

The subs were very good. But the bomb is their Pastrami. It's a killer. Expect to pay $8 including a drink for a small sub, or $10 for the large waist buster. LOL

There's also a frequent diners card and an email club you can join to get online specials. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free drink, see photo. 

So the three of us are now Fans and enjoyed our Four Star meal.

Not exactly what I expected ..................I liked it. 

I was thinking some sprawling ranch house with wood floors and saw dust everywhere, maybe some old west artifacts on the walls and grumpy old waitresses. 

What I got was a cool little funky building, with cool interior and neat things on the walls. More of a sports bar atmosphere with a good sized dining area. Killer staff and great food. 

I had a burger, I believe flat grilled, cooked medium rare and I could tell it was good beef. They said they grind it themselves. The fries were great as they are a fresh cut type. The beans were different. They were a lighter vinegary type of bean with onion and bacon. I liked them but could not eat the whole pot that came out. 

It ended up being a little expensive. 9 for the burger and Fries, 2.50 for the drink and 1.50 for the beans. Tax and tip it was an 18 dollar lunch.

Why don't they allow us to give negative star reviews?

My 5 YO loves this place.  It's close to home and the price is very decent.

Today, he had no school so my parents (his grandparents) took him to Jambo and spent most of the day there.  At one point, my son was thirsty and had gone to the counter to ask for a cup for water.  The person at the counter was very kind and got a water cup for him, put ice in it and for whatever reason, put orange soda in there for him instead of water.  That was nice.   

My son went to sit down in the sitting area and proceeded to drink out of his cup.  A man (who claims is the manager) stormed up to my son, GRABBED his arm and demanded to know why there was soda in there since those cups were specific for water only.  He continued to snatch the cup out of my sons hand and threw it in the trash can and huffed and puffed away.  My mother, upon seeing this went straight to him and asked him what was going on.  The "manager" exclaimed that those cups were specifically for water and why would my mom try to sneak in soda for free?  My mother tried to explain to him that it wasn't her and that it was one of the employees that did it.  He demanded that my mom tell him who it was because he was going to fire him on the spot for doing that.  My mom refused to tell him because she didn't want him to get fired over pouring a measly ounce of soda in to a cup. The "manager" continued to berate my mom for "stealing" soda and told her to go to McDonald's next time because their soda was cheaper there.  

I am absolutely FLOORED by this and could not believe that someone is THAT miserable with their job that they would man-handle my son and throw a drink cup away and claim to fire someone over giving an innocent 5 YO a small plastic cup with soda.  You can bet I will NEVER come here again and you can believe that this story will be on REPEAT to ANYONE and EVERYONE that I know.  I'll also be making a trip to Jambo to confront this alleged manager.

Any visit to Las Vegas would not be complete without a trip to Honolulu Cookie Company especially if you're a bit of a Cookie Monster.

Located inside the Venetian it may take some time to find but once it is a plethora of delicious little Cookies await in flavors like Pineapple Macadamia, White Chocolate Coconut, Lilikoi Mango and Chocolate Chip Macadamia. Now that Fall is upon us some new flavors have made it's way into store's - Ginger Spice and White Chocolate Ginger Spice. 
The store is small and well laid out with lot's of assorted boxes or you can create your own box, 5 Cookies for $4.95 or 10 for $8.95. They also had some large containers that hold maybe 20-25 but I did not see any pricing for those.
The staff are very welcoming and encouraged us to sample as many of the flavors as wanted until we had come to a decision which ones to get, the sample station is located near the door with jar's of little Cookie pieces you can help yourself to.

As for the Cookies themselves.. Yum! I'm a it of a snob when it comes to Shortbread being that I am British with a Northern background (where Shortbread originated) so trust me when I say these are really good! They're baked and imported from Honolulu which explains the slightly hefty price tag but they are worth it.

*TIP*
 Get a "Aloha Card" and receive a stamp for every $5 spent, 20 stamps gets you free Cookies! Also sign up for the ''Pineapple ERewards'' where you will get special offers throughout the year including one for your Birthday.

THIS IS NOW CALLED TOTTIE'S ASIAN FUSION. SAME FABULOUS OWNERS. EXPANDED DIGS. MORE SUSHI. Can't wait to check it out!

Bland strip mall location does not equal bland experience. Do not be leary of an Asian restaurant that covers Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. Normally that would scare me off. The room is full of well kept plants and the obligatory bamboo plants. The staff is uber friendly. This is probably due to the owners who go out of their way to know regulars names. I hadn't been there in months and Tottie remembered both me and my partners names. 
You MUST have the Tottie Spring Rolls....perfectly fried thin skinned yet plumply filled rolls served with large leaves of lettuce, fresh mint and cilantro along with fish sauce. The cool of the produce with the hot of the roll is so yummy I eat four and my partner eats four. 
I love the Thai section so far. I don't remember the name of what I've ordered recently but it had the best "fun" noodles with veggies and chicken....dee lish!
The owner/chef checks on tables, is a dee lite and extremely personable lady. The menu is large and deserves exploring. Also a must order is an appetizer of chicken served over a fire with sugar sticks. Unreal. 
This is truly a warm and loving place.

Update: We've returned several times now and tried more of their menu. 

The Taro Mung Bean Slush and also the Matcha Milk were both great! Thick, rich in flavor, high quality ingredients, and not at all too icy or watery. Lots of flavor! 

Their Taro Milk Tea w/ honey boba is also rich and deep in taro flavor (they don't use artificial tasting ingredients)  It's not a bad choice, but also not my personal favorite - my boyfriend loves it (I'll sneak a sip here and there.)

Honey Black Tea with honey boba has a robust steeped black tea flavor and the honey boba sweetens it up nicely. It's a great choice if you're feeling something lighter and refreshing.

Taro and Red Bean Slush is crazy BOMB as well! It's thick and has bold taro and red bean flavor. They use all quality ingredients. You won't taste powder here! If you can't handle (seriously delicious) flavor, I wouldn't recommend it. ;) 

WOW Green Milk with added Red Bean is another a great choice. It's not actually a milk tea- it's lactose free milk with red bean, mung bean, and honey boba toppings. Give this one a whirl if you're feeling adventurous. You'll enjoy the chewy textures of the beans and boba.

My personal favorite has to be the Golden Oolong Milk Tea w/ honey boba. I can't stop drinking it. If you enjoy flavorful milk tea that's not too thick, this is the perfect choice! It's refreshing and the honey boba sweetens it up nicely.

Also, we always make sure to communicate to them that we want it sweet, but not a sugar bomb and they always hook us right up! Just tell them the percentage of sugar you want them to add: 

Less sugar: 70%
Half Sugar: 50%
Little sugar: 30%
No sugar: 0% duh :p

Thanks KFT crew!

Pro tip: the honey in the boba dissolves into the drink if you drink it very slowly (like we do.) So at first it might not seem too sweet, but in due time it will become sweeter. Just FYI for the non sweets peeps! Just add more ice and you're back in business baby!

Hated it.
Yes, it was cheap. Yes, it's centrally located. Yes, it's disgusting.

A couple of friends and I went for a turn around trip to Vegas for the night. We knew we weren't going to spend that much time in the room because we were there to eat and play some tables. Who knew that we weren't going to spend that much time in the room because we didn't want to be in it? Granted, yes- it was off season and we only spent $15 for the room- but I wish I would have spent $15 more to stay at one of the nicer hotels. We were being cheap, and we paid for it.

I knew it was an older hotel, but come on... a little updating (and cleaning) wouldn't hurt, would it? Being on the main strip next to all of these other nicer hotels, you would think they would try to up their amenities a little. At least run a steam cleaner over the effing carpets.

It took forever to find the check-in from the garage. There was a place that looked like a front desk, but wasn't really a front desk? A maintenance person had to tell us where to go. Check-in was fun, too. The lady pulled out a map that looked like something from an Indiana Jones adventure and proceeded to draw our route to the room. We were really confused when we had to exit the hotel to get to our room. WTF. There was a separate section that resembled a Motel 6 from the 70's. That's where our room was.

Upon opening the door, we were greeted by more dilapidated furniture, stale air and heavily stained carpet. Either someone had a crazy orgy in here before us- or there was a homicide. Needless to say- I waited until I got home to shower and I refused to take off my shoes.

Yes, it's cheap. But spring a little more for a nicer room regardless if you're just there to party. I'd hate to wake up face down on that carpet.

I'm seriously upset with myself for waiting this long to go get me some fried chicken :) KFC in my mind stands for Korean fried chicken and I have been looking for a place to match Bon Chon in New York and this place is as close as it's gonna get!  The chicken is extremely crispy on the outside and so moist on the inside it makes the white meat tastes like dark meat!  I love all the sauces they offer but the soy garlic is my favorite.  The family size is a huge portion and can easily feed 4-6 depending on ones appetite.  The dishes come with some ban chan (side dishes) and the cabbage salad with thousand island is a nice pairing to the spicy flavors in some of the dishes and chicken flavors.  We tried the bulgogi fried rice and that was tasty as well.  We also ordered the stir fried gizzards and I would have to recommend not getting it....not enough flavor and overly chewy.  But I'll overlook anything for good fried chicken or in this case SUPERB fried chicken.  Just two words bomb diggity! Similar concept to Soyo but with a cheaper price point.  The chicken beats the chicken wings at soyo and beats the fried chicken at Bazic.  Definitely give this place a try if you are a fried chicken connoisseur and perhaps you can head next door for a little karaoke action afterwards.

I'm horrified by my experience today. It. Smelled. Awful!

And here's the thing. Gyms probably naturally smell awful. But it's the staff/gyms job to not let that smell linger. Of course there's going to be sweat, B.O. and God knows what else lingering long past your work out. But I'd think it should be one of the main objectives to keep it smelling fresh, because you'd want to keep people coming in.

But here's the thing. I'm paying for not only the use of the machinery, but also the actual space. Do I want to work out in a place that smells like stale B.O.? No way! I want to work out in a clean, properly air conditioned and comfortable space. None of these things are happening here right now. 

That brings me to my next point. Every summer the place suffers from stale and poorly ventilated air. What does that mean? It's freakin' hot in herre! I'd understand you wouldn't want to work out in an ice box. But this isn't a sauna either. It's awful and you can tell it's not supposed to that way. 

I'll leave you with this final fact. I hopped on the elliptical today and there was gum on the front part where you'd put your cell phone. Seriously?? That's rude for the person that did that, but rude that no one would clean that up. I'm honestly disgusted at this point. 

I hope they clean up their act (literally) or I may take my sweat somewhere else that does a better job masking it.

Where do I begin... well, let me start by saying you don't matter to Mandalay Bay unless you're a 'whale' (their term for big time gamblers).  If you're here with your family for a vacation and just looking to have fun -- sorry, even if you can afford it, you're not getting a cabana.  You're lucky to even get a chair.  They will -- as they've personally told me -- physically remove you from a cabana if one of their 'whales' so happens to desire the cabana you're in.  It's their policy.  They might make up for it by giving you a lawn chair out in the 110 degree heat with no sun protection... you know, where you belong!  Equivalent to 'let them eat cake' in my opinion. 

Furthermore, let's say you're like me and you do happen to gamble a lot.  Maybe you've even made their second highest status (Platinum) like me... yeah, that doesn't matter either.   In fact, on two separate occasions now it has yet to matter.  They say Platinum members are given "priority cabana reservations" ...  What they mean to say is, "you can call us at a special VIP number only to have someone say 'sorry, get lost' in a little nicer tone".  It's a complete joke.  They only care about you if you are losing the kind of money that could run most cities for weeks.  

If you are spending money on dinners and shows and suites and whatnot... get lost, they don't want your business.  If you have a chronic gambling problem and don't mind paying the electric bill for Vegas while you're there... Welcome to Mandalay Bay -- let me kick this family out of a cabana that they should never have been allowed in in the first place!

Just as an aside -- I've only had this experience at MGM properties.  The Wynn, The Cosmopolitan & The Palms actually apologized to me for the treatment I received from MGM properties.  I can tell you honestly they don't treat their guests this way.  Nobody should!

I'm sure this place is a great hike. However, I've only been to this mountain for the Lori Piestewa Memorial Services. And that is what this review is about.

I remember what it was like when Lori Piestewa was declared a prisoner or war and how my family got calls from Hopi inlaws asking us to pray in our way for her safe return. There were many things online, in our newspapers and on tv - we were so afraid. And then the inevitable came, the news we didn't want to hear.

I don't know if any of ya'll know this, but Tuba City and the Hopi Nation are small places. Both are tight knit communities where everyone knows one another. And the devistation felt by her loss was incredible. I remember a cousin of mine recalled it as "you could hear the cries in the streets". Every Native in the country probably went to bed hungry that night in honor of her.

And as for the name Squaw. I always knew it was bad. It was something you never said,  you never needed to say it. It was always something terrible. Once when I asked my grandfather what it meant he said "a terrible, terrible woman who's unfit to get married." I later learned that it meant, to his tribe, a women who was raped as a child and was deemed no longer fit to bear children. That was the interrpretation I grew up with and that is how I equate it today. I know of the mainstream meaning of that word, as a derogitory term for a vagina. But know that different tribes view it differently. but all meanings are terrible.

I've only been called a squaw once. and unfortunatly, that person knew what it meant and used it in that context. And inspite of my education, eloquence and empathy - I was nothing but a mere squaw to this person and to this state and so was it's mountian. And I gotta admit, it stung a little to hear Squaw Peak Freeway or Squaw Peak used so... lightly. 

It was a wonderful day to hear Governor Napalitano decide to change the name to honor Lori Piestewa. I found it ironic and fitting. An elder once said, "Jessica may have gotten a movie, but Lori got a mountain!" And though she lost her life fighting for the freedoms of all Americans, she won a major battle in the war against using hurtful names from Indian Country's past to casually name things such as: mountains, sports teams, etc.

This little indian girl who cried when she heard that Woman Warrior died is now a young woman who does what she can to push for change in America - and a big part of what inspires me and other women of color (not just natives) was the renaming of this mountain. This Peak is more than just a place for a great hike, it's the beginning of a movement. I have never forgotten that everytime I've traveled to it's base to honor the woman who inspired the change. And I know this woman, where ever she is, smiles down knowing her daughter doesn't have to live in the same world where she once did - where Native women were constantly being cursed at when asked for directions. Where signs all over a city sliced through you like knives. Where you'd try not to whince whenever a non-native on TV spoke about the traffic. It's a wonderful world, I only wish Lori could see it.

Marquee is the newest club to hit Vegas and it is ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. A gorgeous club full of gorgeous people! My girls and I agreed that it would be very, very hard for any other place to top it... it was that epic.

The main room will blow you away with its 40 foot LED DJ booth, but make sure you check out all three levels, including the Boombox and the Library - you will be wowed by it all. The Boombox is a smaller underground club with a separate DJ, and the Library is more of an intimate lounge area hidden behind the massive LED screen - complete with pool tables, vintage books and offers more craft cocktails. And if you need to cool off, head outside, where you'll be impressed by the incredible backdrop of City Center views and the fabulous pool cabanas with see-through jacuzzis. 

We received rockstar treatment from beginning to end, and were fortunate to be walked right in. The GA line was scary long. We ended up dancing the night away at the VIP booth right next to the DJ booth, so it almost seemed like we were go-go dancers on stage. It was ATB's first night of residency and it was so amazing to be right there with him. His set was totally nostalgic - remember "Till I Come"?! - we were partying like it was 1999! The dance floor was completely packed with a high energy crowd.

Marquee has really taken the Vegas club to a new level. AMAZE-BALLS!!

Oh how easy it would be to diss the USPS. What with all the "gone postal" stories we've heard. But I have to say, not only are the little uniforms hot....I mean really... those cute little black socks many of them wear....HELLO!!!

I"ve learned many things at this particular location.

Agnes' husband Leanord cannot stand in line with her because he has horrible arthritis in his knees. So he sits while she stands. Lovely. 

Agnes has bad breath. Sorry. She just did. 

Fancy lady enters, while dozens of us are waiting in line, thinking of starting a game of Twister, when Fancy lady buds in front of everybody "cuz she's in a hurry". Really. Cuz we all got nothing else to do Missy.

And one nice man used to collect stamps "the old fashioned kind", until "they came out with the kind you can't lick!"...yes...he said that!

But. These folks know when to add clerks and everyone is very helpful and friendly. Perhaps they are eating healthy food and drinking Naked Juice from Fresh n Easy next door. 

Licking or no licking. This location is purrrrfect for me. And even though I appreciate being asked if I want the special Star Wars stamps, I say HELL NO...I'm waiting for the Hello Kitty collection. Hello???!!!? Peace out yelpitas. You rawk my chain Mary!

One of the most intimate and unique dining experiences you will ever experience in Sin City!

Having tried most of the fine dining restaurants in Vegas, I thought i'd seen it all til i was pleasantly surprised with a shiny golden ticket in the mail!

When that fateful evening arrived on Saturday October 13th, I was like Charlie waiting in eager anticipation to finally visit Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.  Truth be told, I wasn't quite sure what was in store for me but i had a feeling it would be something good! 

In fact, as soon as we stepped into Jaleo, we were cordially seated at the bar and kindly given the drink menu for the evening on a handy iPad! Since I was feeling celebratory, i decided on the wine pairing with my meal and  as soon as our server found out it was my birthday, he gave us a glass of cava on the house! Now that's service IMO! 

After that, we were escorted to a dimly lit and intimate private room with a semicircular bar surrounded by wooden card catalogs housing Jose Andre's eclectic tchotchkes, which he apparently collected from his travels around the world.  At this time, the chef introduced himself and proceeded with a brief explanation of the evening's events.  Without a moment to spare, the chef and his skilled staff worked feverishly on the first dish. Liquid nitrogen began to billow over the counter and within moments, we were presented with beautiful bite size pieces of food art. About 20 or more dishes followed in succession, each skillfully crafted to engage and amaze!

I must admit, I arrived with high expectations, but the chef and staff at  definitely did not disappoint. It was a truly unforgettable experience that was filled with intrigue and spectacle. An intimate showcase inspired by traditional Spanish dishes, masterfully executed by the talented chef and staff.  is bar none one of the most interesting and enjoyable dining experiences I've ever had in Vegas! With that said, it's an experience you should make when visiting the city because like magic, it could soon disappear!

Happy Eats!

Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Rave ... Repeat
Eat ... Sleep ... Marquee ... Repeat

Marquee Nightclub was packed. The music was thumpin' and the drinks were flowin'. Who cares if there were more dudes on the crowded dance floor than ladies? We were there to jump and dance ... and after quickly staking out a spot in the middle near the front, that is exactly what we and a few hundred of our new best friends did.

Tip #1: Stay at the Cosmopolitan. Go online and book a room because it includes free admission to Marquee through a much shorter line. It'll also give you a place to freshen up before hitting the club and crash/party afterwards. Ask for a room in the East Tower for convenience to Marquee.

Marquee Mondays makes Marquee a reason to stay in Sin City an extra day. The EC Twins and Nadia Ali performed on the Monday before Christmas and this was like an early gift from Santa.

Tip #2: Get on the main dance floor early cause by midnight it was wall-to-wall people with almost no one getting in or out. Many "couples" were frustrated with the tight quarters, so, come prepared for bumpin' and jumpin' with people from all around the globe.

DJ Lisa Pittman worked it at the pool while Eddie Makabi and another DJ pumped up the beats inside before the headliners came out around 12:30. Nadia did a 30-minute live set which had the crowd frothing and then the energy reached a peak with the frenetic twins.

Tip #3: Get a table if you aren't planning to stake out a spot on the crowded dance floor. If you are just wanting to chill at a club, the outdoor pool vibe and tables may be best or get one of the prime spots inside so you and your crew can dance in your own area.

Drinks are expensive ... of course, and table service is crazy expensive. Plan accordingly.

Marquee was a blast. We loved the vibe, the confetti, foam light sticks, blasts of cold air, and non-stop beats. If you get free admission to Marquee while staying at The Cosmopolitan then it is easily a 5-star night for any EDM fan.

Fry's is one of the Kroger brand stores and it is clearly their best.

Every so often, we will pick up a few bottles of wine and grab one of those ecological friendly bags.  I took the time recently and noticed that they have printed all the Kroger stores on it's side.  Clearly someone in Kroger HQ was thinking beyond their area.  Realizing, that having one bag for all their stores, would save money and promote brand awareness.  Well, it did.

Turkey Hill, Smith's, Ralph's, QFC, Fred Meyer, Payless, City Market and Fry's.  These are all of the Kroger stores we've been lucky to shop in over several relocations, and they're all very good individually.  Fry's and this store in particular, seems to be the best!  

In the short five years we've been in Arizona, this store has had several updates. The books and magazine area was updated four years ago and then again recently. Same thing for the convenience food.  Three times in five years.  Now, they have a wine tasting, sushi maker on hand, bar area -- which is always packed!  At least a dozen shoppers watching a flat screen TV, drinking wine and eating some personally made sushi and pot stickers.  WOW!

This would all be a sidebar, if their prices weren't competitive.  And how do I know their competitive?  Because mammoth Walmarts is now airing TV commercials against Fry's and saying theirs prices are lower.  Incredible!  Who ever heard of Walmarts airing commercial against one competitor!  One competitor. Think about it for a moment.  

As our YCM Lindsey F wrote fourteen months ago: "Holy grocery store! I don't even know if the term grocery store can be applied to this Fry's. Imagine Target, Costco, AJ's, Fry's, Walgreens and Whole Foods all piled into one overwhelming massive store."  Our family agrees and we haven't even mentioned their $0.10 off a gallon of gas/diesel tie-in with Circle K or Shell.  So, why shop anywhere else?

A shout-out to Jeff in Bakery, Donnie in Checkout and Gloria in Deli.  They are friendly, helpful and willing to go out of their way to get you whatever you want!  Did I mention their great customer service?

Okay, I'm a Fan!  And, this is: "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"  Five Stars.

Where to begin?

I came here yesterday to purchase a cup of tea, but what I encountered was a high pressured sales experience!

Recently I noticed that Starbucks bought Teavana and I decide to give it a try.  Teavana is located across the street from my office in Kierland. I went inside and asked about their Rooibos or other white teas.  It was too late in the day for a Oolong and I wanted something light.  

When we lived in Seattle, I use to enjoy stopping at Peet's Coffee & Teas in Fremont. http://www.yelp.com/biz/peets-coffee-and-tea-seattle-2 Their selection was outstanding and I had high hopes for Teavana.

I vaguely remember hearing stories of the hard sell employed here.  Sadly, they were all true.

I came in and asked if they sold hot tea, or were they strictly a bulk outlet. No, I was told they did both.  Great!  I asked if they carried any Rooibos, or other white teas and I was shown some strong black teas and Oolongs.  "Danger Will Robinson", I thought.  I corrected the salesperson and said I wanted something lighter, that didn't have as much caffeine. 

Well, this went on for a while, but I finally purchased a Grande size cup of one of their teas for $5.45. It took ten minutes, after several false started.  As I was leaving, I tasted a samplers outside and decided to get some tea for home.  The tea I like, Samurai Chai Mat wasn't sold in a bag and  I was informed that I needed to purchase one of their tins for $7.00!  Hmm, okay I thought.

I asked for a small amount to take home.  They filled the tin and I was told that would be $56.00. I said empty half the can and then it was $34.00. So I asked how much was it an ounce and was told $6.30.  In the end, I paid $19.53 for 3.1 oz and along with my $7.00 tin including taxes it came to $27.57.

I've skipped the blow by blow dialogue. In sales, these tactics are called the "Assumptive Close". It's where the salesperson, assumes you want the largest amount, or a fully loaded car, er tea -- until they are corrected. It can be exasperating and somewhat annoying.

In the future, I'll pass and stick to Starbucks. I never thought I would ever say that!

For my 500th Review, I wanted to share my experience at a cool club at the Wynn. I finally came here after going to most of the clubs and lounges in town including, XS, Marquee, Tao, Lavo, 1OAK, Rain, Playboy, et al.

Tryst is located near the entrance to the Wynn.  Just make a quick right after you enter the hotel.  I really liked this club because the staff was chill, the clientele was friendly and the place was not crowded on a Fri night in early June.

LA Riots was deejaying and was dropping some down beats.  LA Riots in known for introducing a blend of Indie Rock, Alternative Dance & Electro music in 2007.  The bartenders were really cool and poured some stiff effin drinks!!!  There were at least three bars and we didn't have to wait long.  The bouncers were chill and present, but not "overly" present.  Lastly, the valets in the restroom were excellent:  5 Stars.  The ambiance is very nice.  You walk downstairs and the hallway leads you to the main entry to the dance floor.  There is a stage for the dj, two separate platforms for the two dancers and a waterfall & pool in the backdrop.  There is also a pole for the amateurs to try out too - LOL!! -http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=LuRoNUSPwGtPQMe5gDF7sw&userid=o1_sfJ71nrq5QrF00v3Icw.   Lastly, there are a couple of outside areas to get some fresh air:  5 Stars.

Tryst means a meeting place, and it wouldn't be true if my friend and I didn't meet some ladies.  We met a couple from Chicago who were very nice and kept us company.  They were not ratchets, they were cute, and they could carry on intelligent conversations.  As for what happened later, well like Lil' Wayne's lines from Love Me (Drake)

And I would say these girls' names
But then I would be snitching
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges, man!

LMFAO!!!!!

(3.5)
A Frickin MAZE!!!

I like to start with the positives. 
There's Earl of Sandwich. 
Prices are reasonable (i booked mine from hotel.com)
They have tubs instead of just showers. 

I originally booked a Hollywood Hip room, which was the basic. 
However, when checking in, they showed me that i would be facing the back lot. (ofcourse right?)  I was offered a $20/per room./per night upgrade so i could see the strip and they also found me adjoining rooms, which was good since i was with relatives in two rooms. It was so much more convenient than being separated and plus they got to see the strip. 

MAJOR COMPLAINT= the self parking is hella far from hotel entrance!
My poor grandma and mom had to walk the entire miracle mile as we did not know it would be that far! The rest of the trip, dude and i pretty much was going back and forth to pick them up at the lobby. Took about 12 minutes each way. They have free valet, but we never like to valet in general... bad stories. 

Rooms are not created equally! (in the same category). 
We had adjacent rooms on the 16th floor and there was a few differences we noticed. The room i was NOT sleeping in had noticeably softer beds (must be the beds some yelpers were saying were sooooo comfortable- we didn't get those). My room had the very low water pressure that some guests noted, while the other room had perfectly good water pressure... 

Minor complaints. 
There's a pretty sizable opening on the doors leading to the restroom, which do not lock or close all the way. Peek a boo... thankfully not peek a poo, as you have ur private door for the toilet.

I wanted to try this when I was here last year, but I had to wait a year.  Like many similar spots throughout the different casinos this is a frozen drink and bottled beer stand that serves blended slush like drinks in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic versions.  This one is located just outside of the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino's Street of Dreams next to the Starbucks at the foot of the escalators leading visitors to the Aria/Crystals/Bellagio free tram.  The location is in a bad spot hidden from view from visitors exiting the Street of Dreams shops.  There is bar seating and small round tables nearby as the Monte Carlo website depicts (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nAQtZgjU0fAjAtWtCETkew?select=HWH4uputadH926t3vAqz6A).

My friends walked over to Starbucks for some after-dinner coffee, but since I don't drink coffee I decided to have an alcoholic slushie instead.  Of the eight or so blended concoctions I went with the 16 ounce Blue Ice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nAQtZgjU0fAjAtWtCETkew?select=w-MIlrBEGwq3Sh1GUL7g9g) made with SKYY Citron Vodka partly because I'm attracted to blue colored drinks like blue Gatorade, blue PowerAde, Blue Raspberry Slurpees from 7-11 or blue cream soda.  The vodka taste stood out quite well and with the exception of a few spells of brain freeze I enjoyed the drink very much.

The flavor was neither too sweet nor too tart.  It was a very good smurfy blue after-dinner refresher.  The $8 price for a 16 ounce serving was exactly the same as all the other similar frozen alcohol blender stands we saw at other casinos along the Strip.  Jello shots are also available but not every night.

The first time I dined at Chompies I was blown away at how extensive the menu is. I have enjoyed everything that I have ordered. This is my go to place when we get caught between that critical 6pm to 7pm time slot when a lot of restaurants have big waiting times. This is not a knock on Chompies, It just works out that way since their clientele seems to eat earlier in the day.

I've usually order their burgers or the pastrami. My son loves their chicken sandwich. My favorite is the whole pastrami sandwich. It's very tasty and probably the best pastrami I've ever had. It is a mountain of a sandwich. I usually eat half of it and finish the next day for lunch. I order the whole sandwich as opposed to the 1/2 sandwich, soup option since the soup always seems to spill on to the plate when it's being delivered to the table. I don't like soggy sandwiches.

They also serve breakfast items. So if you have that picky eater in your family, this place is definitely an option.

Last minute decision to finally drive to Montreal brought me to Hotel10 - thank you hoteltonight app. (I mean it was either that or watch Honeymooners reruns all weekend - Montreal won).

The location is perfect - walking distance from old town and port, right next to St Laurent with all its restaurants and bars, and close to St Denis if you want to do some shopping.

Design is modern chic, which I always loved. 
Complimentary bath robe, oversized rain umbrella and huuuuge shower are big plus. Keurig coffeemaker in the room is cool too.
It also pretty quiet - polished concrete ceilings (darn kewl), carpeted floors, and covered walls - good soundproofing. I saw college kids with party supplies go to room next door and was prepared for much noise - did not hear a peep.

Garage parking is convenient, and I am tipping my hat to most awesome valet. 
Free wifi - good speed.
Huge gym room, clean, spotless, with fresh towels and ice cold water.

Breakfast is Ok-ish, I rather prefer eating elsewhere. 
However, Jargo lounge at night is pretty decent to grab a drink or dinner.

One word to management and my only disappointment - is how they maintain it. Carpets on ground level need cleaning, headboards need to be dusted, and hairdryer bags need to be cleaned. I don't enjoy finding other peoples hair there.

There's a hair in my arugula. A long, straight hair. I know what you're thinking ... 'well, that's better than a short and curly hair.' Although true, I'm just not in need of the extra protein. Plenty of that provided by the grilled tenderloin sitting atop of said arugula and beside aforementioned hair.

I chose not to make a scene as the place - early afternoon on a Tuesday - was fairly full of fine female patrons. I removed the hair with surgical precision and proceeded to enjoy my lunch. And enjoy, I did.

I saw many many savory items on the menu, but I can only speak to the Arugula-Gorgonzola Steak. Tasty. Oh ... and the sweet potato chips were the truth as well. The place is kinda' unique in that it shares two different suites - a "market" on one side and an "eatery" on the other - joined by a breezeway in the middle. One could enjoy their meal, or a glass of wine outside if one so desired. 

Four stars. I'm not deducting anything for the hair, but the 'Box is awfully proud of their prices and the service leaves much to be desired. I mean, the gal that occasionally tended to me was friendly ... just not necessarily well-versed in the art of prompt, accommodation of customer requests. Like the one I made for silverware and a napkin. Twice. 

That said, the Herb Box was a cute little joint and I'm sure I'll be stopping in again for lunch when I find myself hocking fenestrations mid-day in north Scottsdale.
 
Next time I'll try a twelve-dollar sandwich. Brown Sugar Pork Ciabatta. Sans follicle, if I may.

So you are lost in Sin City and you want some sinning and debauchery... what will you do? Go down to the pool and hit on every member of the opposite sex till someone goes yeah lets hook it up? Or is that too blunt in yo face and chit? If it's the latter, perhaps a trip to Sapphire may be in order since it is a "klassy" establishment... 

Well at least they want you to think that they are klassy... marble columns, a portico faade, travertine floors/wall panels, sculptures and large vases, and a podium with security flanking that want to cop a feel before you can move further into the establishment.

Pro Tip: Free ride over for larger parties in a limo or limo bus...

So once you get inside, then you run into problems. If your group goes in without having purchased "bottle service" well you are screwed. There is literally no where you can sit except for a few seats surrounding the stages which were mostly empty or filled with ugly girls when I was there. So lets think this through... you want to go see some dancers and there is nowhere to sit down unless you spend ridiculous amounts of cash on a bottle of liquor. Like 5-10 times the normal value for said bottle at an average liquor store. Talk about a racquet, you know I don't think they would make as much running prostitutes hahaha well unless you want to get a "private room" and I have no clue what those things would cost...

So once you realize you are screwed without bottle service and finally purchase it, the "damsels in distress" errr girls on who knows what come over and beg for drinks and to give you a "private" dance better known as a lap dance.  Well most of the girls that I saw here were just not my type. Some were downright scary... was it ugly girls night at the Sapphire? I have no clue but it was not the typical exotic dancer experience that I have had in the past. 

The best looking women there seemed to be the waitresses and they wouldn't talk to you hardly at all unless you were buying a bottle or three at the ridiculously inflated prices that they were demanding. Overall, my friend who was a bachelor had a blast while we were there, but when we were brought in and expected one thing and pulled the bait and credit card charge swap for an extra $800 really sucked for the rest of us. Ohhh and that was for 3 bottles and mixers haha *SMH*

Consequently I am not a fan of this joint and do not plan on returning here... So yeah don't say I didn't warn ya... bait and switched...

While I was in Vegas and bored outta my mind, I called my "friend" Chris who moved to Vegas a few years ago so we could "chat".

I was staying at the Cosmo so I told him to meet me at the Vesper Bar so we could have a drink and he could possibly slip me a quaalude *kidding*

People watching here is amazing.  The bar area is pretty much empty most of the time, but there are so many people moving past from the hotel.  All kinds of walks of life, from everywhere.  

The drinks all have interesting names and even more interesting ingredients.  Drinks are average prices, anywhere from 10-15 bucks, but they're worth it.  The bartenders are nice, and easy on the eyes.  

If you happened to see an Asian guy making out with a tall white guy...That was probably me...God I'm such a slut, at least Chris cured my case of boredom.

If not for photos, and reviews posted by Betty and Cindy, I wouldn't really be able to go into detail about what we ate here. I was not hungover, but completely buzzed all throughout dinner. However, I do remember that my tastebuds were happy about what was consumed. 

I didn't really have much of an appetite, but everyone seemed to force me to eat each of my 3-courses. We started with mac 'n' cheese bites, which were the perfect combination of two of my favorite comfort foods: mac 'n' cheese and tater tots. The dipping sauce (I think it had truffle oil in it) was so yummy. I chose to go all out on carbs and got the trenne pasta with prosciutto for my main entree. I think this also had truffle oil in the sauce. The triangular penne pasta was delicious. For dessert, we had the donut balls. I'm pretty sure the caramel sauce I had with it did NOT have truffle oil in it.

Our server Todd (thanks for refreshing my memory, Cindy), and the Assistant GM Patrick were both very accommodating and friendly. Even though they had taken off the petite filet mignon from the $36 prix-fixe menu, they were still able to offer them to us since the concierge had told us it would be available. 

Although we missed out on a fabulous dinner at Mix at Mandalay Bay, I'm glad we went with Plan B and came here. Again, thank goodness for photos.

Great Little Bar Tucked Away Inside the Luxor Pyramid in Vegas

SITREP

"Aurora", the "Goddess of the Dawn", so aptly named since on one occasion, I think it actually was almost dawn when we left after late night Karaoke activities ending at 3am.

THE SETUP

We actually cabbed back to the Luxor after Bazil's, but still a bit too wired to go to sleep and this place was still open.  Wait.  Let me rephrase that.  It's ALWAYS open.  Jesus - 24 HRS!  [This is SOOOO not Sacramento.] ;)

WHY I LOVE VEGAS

That's the remarkable thing about Vegas I still have to get to used is that most bars don't close - they are open 24 hours!  That's actually the thing I hate about bars in Sacramento, and even San Francisco & Seattle (my favorite Cities) - the bar security will go around and grab your drink at, what (checks his watch) 2am or even 1:40am and take the $10 drink you ordered that is still half full (because I am a sipper who likes to savor my martini or cocktail) - or forces you to down the top shelf goodness like it was some cheap shot.

TRIANGULATION 

Located across from the lobby's front desk, Aurora can be that first distracting stop (as it was with me) before you get back to your room (and often a couple hour detour).

MY DRINK

Anyways, this was a fantastic chill spot.  As far as drinks go, I'm basic with a Rum & Coke, and it was great to see that this drink is cheap - commensurately speaking - when compared to other cocktails here as anywhere.

LUXOR-DECOR

Nice to watch people doing the table top games nearby, but just as interesting is the lighting-effects inside the bar on the ceiling.  And though the name-antecedent originates back to "The Dawn", in this instance, this bar's use of the name "Aurora", more specifically references those aforementioned lighting effects reminiscent of the Aurora Borealis or "Northern lights". 

THE LOWDOWN

Aurora has a great chill Vegas vibe, and if you don't really want to be in the Casino areas, Aurora had for me a fun environment  [Where I could enjoy my drink and have fun flirting with a group of ladies from the Czech Republic, whose biological clocks were still on Czech time, and so they were "up" already.] ;)

I haven't been to Fatburger in a while and this was my 1st time to visit this location.  I'm a fan of Fatburger, but not this location.  Here's why.

FOOD - 4 Stars
I was prepared to give this place a 4 Star rating.  I noticed a new menu since my last visit to a Fatburger and ordered a XXL with all of the toppings & added Bacon & Cheese.  For a side, I ordered the Skinny Fries.

After a 15 minute wait, I received my food.  To my surprise, the Burger was HUGE!  I should have paid more attention to the menu because this monster was more than I expected.....I guess I should have ordered a XL.

I attacked the Burger and the Fatburger taste that I grew up with was still there.  The sharp flavor from the Mustard Relish and the Onions generated an explosion on my taste buds.  The Bacon was a nice addition and the Cheese was gooey and made it just right.  The Skinny Fries were just ok.

Overall, the meal was awesome.....now, this is where it went from 4 Stars to 1 Star.....I went to the restroom to wash up since the Burger was pretty messy.  When I got to the restroom I was appalled at how disgusting it was.  It was worse than a Gas Station Bathroom.  The kicker was when I saw that the paper towels to wipe your hands were on top of the toilet.....what's the point of washing your hands when you're about to wipe it on towels that are contaminated from the toilet?!!!  

See the pics I uploaded for details....you'll notice the brown paper towels sitting on top of the toilet tank and that the spot on the wall where the dispenser is suppose to be mounted has spots where plaster was used to cover up the holes...the hand towels are almost touching the toilet seat!!!  ....someone must have pulled it off the wall....but they're not going to replace it?  My issue with this is that is the same bathroom where the employees wash their hands.....gross.  To be fair, I've sent an email to their corporate office to make them aware of this situation....it can't be up to code...can it?  I hope not.

Will I return?  Not until they fix the issue with the hand towels.

Best Foot Spa really is the BEST FOOT SPA in VEGAS!
And Get your mind out of the gutter, this ain't "THAT" kinda foot spa!

After so many 5-star 100% positive reviews, I was itching for a massage. All the tension in my neck and back became so much more apparent and I was counting the seconds till I had a day off. I haven't had a massage in a year!

MASSAGE: They hit all areas of the body. Start with the shoulders, move to the head & scalp, and arms while your feet are soaking. Then off to the legs & feet. You'll flip over face down and then they'll go to town on the reverse side--neck, back, legs, the whole nine-yards. I had Song Lee (sp?) and boy did he really work my aching muscles. The rest of my body prefers a medium-firm handle. But when it comes to all the knots in my neck, shoulders, and back I really need someone to relentlessly work those puppies out. And he didn't disappoint!

OUCH: Not gonna lie, he de-knotted every muscle in my back. In the following days, the skin there is still a tad tender. But no pain, no gain. All that tension back there is gone. One thing though, the towels are kind've rough. They really need to use more fabric softener or fluffier towels. When he's using that much muscle, the towel tends to rub my sensitive skin--and not in a good way. 

CLOTHING: You'll be fully clothed. For women, I recommend wearing some type of tank top and lounging pants of a thin cotton material. The pants should be able to roll up to your knees so they can work on your feet and legs. Also, when you're covered by towels and being rubbed down, it can get a little hot. You're not taking your clothes off so wear lightweight breathable materials. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE: Song Lee chimed in to make sure my comfort level was ok. I was uncomfortable during all the digging into my back but I knew I needed it--I didn't want him to let up! Next time, I'll probably ask for more neck/shoulders a little less foot. But I can't stress enough how polite and respectful he was. Rex checked me out and again, what a kind and polite person. 

PRICES: Mention Yelp, and you'll get a 10% discount.
               $34 = 60 mins (Org $38) ---I did this. Paid Credit Card. Tipped $10 cash. 
               $43 = 75 mins (Org $48)
               $52 = 90 mins (Org $58)

After such a wonderful experience, I'll be back once a month for my monthly rub-down.

Don't forget to RATE & FOLLOW! ;)

Can an establishment have a classier name?

I'm not sure if I should be writing a review for this place, or a review for my awesome wife that actually let me bring her here. Every vacation we go on some excursion, whether it be cave diving, zip-lining, dune buggys, etc. well in Montreal they don't have a lot of these things to choose from, but what they do have a lot of is kink, so this became our Montreal adventure. 

It took a lot of wine beforehand to convince my wife to walk up the seedy stairwell to the second floor, but she eventually mustered the blood alcohol level to pull it off. When the door upstairs opened we were greeted by two girls wearing nothing but their bras, okay I'm thinking, this is already a good time!

So you pay a fee to get in which basically covers entry, a private room, a couple free beers, and your choice of dancer. I was surprised when the lady we chose told us her name was "Mercedes". I thought surely outside the US these girls could get more creative with their stripper names, but I guess that's a global stereotype.

All I will give away is that it was an experience neither of us will forget, and we left both satisfied and probably a little embarrassed. It was a lot of fun and the girl we chose was very nice and made the whole experience comfortable. The owner was also really cool so feel free to call ahead like we did if you have any questions.

If you are looking for an experience outside the repetitive mechanics of a strip club, or the limitations we have here in the states, then this is the place to go.

Great Casino Buffet Restaurant & FREAKIN LIONS

SITREP

Every time I pop into the MGM Grand Hotel, it's a fun casual experience.

THE SETUP

I love their dining buffets because they are quick & efficient.  Lunch runs $19.99.  Dinner runs $29.99.  (I never do both on the same day since I eat like it's my only meal of the day!)

LIONS! 

The LIONS in their large area are fun to watch interact with one another and the people.  They bring a LOT of spectators who are fascinated by being so close to observe them.  But part of me feels this is not kind to them.  So I am conflicted about this to be honest.  [Update:  see note at bottom of this review about the Lions new whereabouts]  :D

SHUTTLE PICK-UP

MGM Grand is also one of the major drop-off and get-on locations for catching shuttles back and forth from Mc Carran airport.  Great place to know.

THE LOWDOWN

My casual hotel run-in / grab a bite / run-out and hit the strip place.

ADDITIONAL UPDATE - Owner Response within 24 HRS

Here is one of two messages I just received in less than 24 hours from the MGM Owners Group.  You can't see this personal message below since it's in my Yelp inbox.  However, there is a 2nd message that shows up on the Business profile attached to my review (though these messages are not viewable from one's personal Yelp profile page).  A great response below to the Lion Issue.  Now that was unlooked for!  Message begins:

March 10, 2014

Social M.
Owner

Dear Michelangelo:

Thank you for expressing your concerns regarding the MGM Grand Lion Habitat. 

The MGM Grand Lion Habitat closed as part of a property wide renovation project. Head trainer Keith Evans will continue to care for the lions at his large desert compound here in Southern Nevada, where the animals have actually spent the majority of their lives. Several years ago, MGM Grand and Mr. Evans established means to ensure that the lions will receive proper care for the rest of their lives.

The lion will remain an icon and logo forever associated with the MGM Grand brand.  We truly value your comments and patronage, and look forward to serving you again in the future.

Sincerely,

The Guest Experience Department
MGM Grand - Las Vegas

Living up to the hype.  A warm and contemporary Italian American eatery that delivers great tastes with the energy that is Vegas.  

This is not an authentic taste of Italian regional specialties rather refined and prettied up versions of Italian American favorites.  All good, it works.

The majority of the menu centers around small plates of antipasti shared family style.  Flavors are very complimentary so ordering a wide variety of dishes works.  An incredible simple grilled broccoli rabe natural bitterness is enhanced by hints of char and smoke but brought to life by a spicy, chili vinaigrette.  Sweet peppers stuffed with a tangy goat cheese and peppery olive oil create a very well balanced dish exploding with freshness.

For seafood antipasti, do not pass on the lobster arancini.  Dressed with a spicy pomodoro of Calabria chili and a touch of a herbaceous basil aioli that elevates the sweetness of the lobster.  Slightly cloying mouth feel but great flavors.  

Great selection of well made salumi.  Try a variety.  The Bresaola and finocchiona as good as any in Tuscany.  Add a selection of cheeses with perfectly paired condiments (Mozzarella with a citrus chili pesto,  Parmigiano with honey).  

Small selection of pastas.  The lobster ravioli excellent.  Perfectly cooked sheets of pasta surrounding chunks of barely cooked through lobster perfumed by tarragon.  Richness on richness but it works.

The only weakness of the restaurant are the mains.  A mustard, walnut, and raisin crusted rack of lamb, while perfectly cooked was one dimensional, needing more herbaceous, lemony gremolata.  A bone in "Tuscan" rib-eye topped with a sunny side up egg did not make sense.   The yolk did nothing to elevate the flavor of the beef rather giving it an unpleasant yolky aftertaste as it cooled.

Service is a work in progress.  Slow and lacking confidence.  This will definitely improve with time.

Decent wine list at Vegas resort prices.

Guys, admit it, Giada turned you on to cooking shows.  Now the chance is here to try the food you know you never cooked.  Worthy.

A "Japanese" chain restaurant in cities Brentwood, Dubai, Glendale, Hollywood, Kuwait, LA, Las Vegas and South Beach; an NO location in Japan.  It speaks volumes.

Sarcasm aside, and putting it mildly, this is yet another restaurant designed for the gaijin serving faux Japanese fare like silly 15 ingredient sushi creations with even more ridiculous names like a tiger roll or corn crunch roll.  That said, it does a better job than most.

Modern interior, clean lines, and a contemporary vibe provide a great setting for the culinary creations.  

In general, fresh seafood, beautiful, colorful plantings and wonderful presentation that heighten the experience and mask imperfections.

Creative dishes are very good.  A lobster and truffle chawanmushi with its soft, velvety texture, hints of dashi and sweet lobster accented by the earthy finish of truffle is good eats.  The scallop sashimi outstanding.  Brightened by the yuzu, perfect texture with apple and peppery finish of watercress.  The wagyu sashimi, gently seared with oil perfectly accented by the heat and pounced flavor of ginger and bitterness of chives.

Nice selection of wagyu beef dishes including some using A4 Japanese wagyu.  Be careful of the fatty richness.  It's very easy to fill up.  The wagu short rib, rib eye, and skirt steak from the robata grill are a great way to try different cuts and flavors.  The wagyu filet with foie and a plum wine reduction also worthy albeit excessively rich as the plum reduction lacks sufficient acidity to cut through the fat on fat pairing of the wagyu and foie.  Sadly the A4 wagyu rice was excessively oily with a cloying mouth feel paling in comparison to that of BarMASA.

Forget the silly rolls, they are a waste of the very good quality, fresh seafood.  Additionally, the rice for the nigiri is aggressively seasoned, sticky, and compacted with broken grains.  The seasoning takes away from the enjoyment.  Focus on sashimi offerings (ask for any sushi offering as sashimi).  Correctly graded chu and o-toro, very good mirugai, aji, and uni.

Well chosen selection of beer  and very well chosen selection of sake at Vegas resort markup.   

Good service but still showing the "green" uncertainty that will go away with time.

Definitely one of the better "interpretive" Japanese eateries in Vegas today.

My family and friends have been getting together for a few years here to grub. That will be happening no longer. The last 3 visits were terrible and the last visit specifically was not good. I'm sad about this because I really loved the food before, but now it's just not consistent. On this last visit we were the only customers in the restaurant yet it still took over an hour to receive our food and the food came out staggered. My niece only wanted Egg Drop Soup and they totally forgot to bring it to her and only did so after asking a 3rd time about it. When she finally got her soup it was like a bowl of gloppy gel. I loved the soup here before, so I have no idea what has happened, but it wasn't even edible. What I loved ordering here most, Strawberry Chicken, tasted awful. One thing that wasn't easy to ignore was the nasty smell inside. It smelled so badly of like sewage or something. Then at the end of the meal we noticed roaches on the floor! OMG I was so ready to leave. Drinks come in cans and refills aren't free. After loving this place for so long it's a major disappointment to see New China Cuisine go so downhill.

Five score years ago two great Americans, Brad and Kat, signed the Short Leash food truck proclamation. This momentous decree of great bacon, sausages, naan bread and gourmet toppings will be seared in the flames of delicious. But years later we face the tragic fact that we are still not free, not free to eat Short Leash when we want it.

But there is something that I must say to my people who stand in the long lines which leads into the palace of delicious. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and eat Short Leash whenever we want. I have a dream that one day we will be able to sit down together at a table inside a restaurant. I have a dream today. 

It's not every day that dreams become reality, but the dream of dining at Short Leash on a whim, whenever we feel like, without waiting in lines has come to fruition.

I had the privilege of visiting during their friends and family preview, and left with great conviction to visit over and over again. They've got a few restaurant only items on their menu like Scotch Eggs, savory Funnel Cakes, and a few other gems I'll let you discover for yourself. They're serving beer and wine on their menu now, with a pitcher costing you just $7.50

Short Leash Sit...Stay will be a great addition to Roosevelt Row's way of life.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, I can't wait to see you there!

Note: I rated this one-star because I can't give it less.

My wife Jill and I went to this at ten this morning.  First, let's talk about how we almost didn't make it because Hero Ventures and TicketMaster never got their act together.  When they postponed opening the event for a week, we did not get any information about our NEW tickets.  All they did was mention that we could bring a friend for free.  All that this did was add to the total number of disappointed attendees today.

We arrived and were very much surprised by a heretofore unmentioned charge for parking.  Not once was it referenced in any of the communications, or on the page for the event.  Ten additional dollars poorer, we then waited for thirty to forty five minutes, in the sun, while other attendees tried futilely to register their less than useless tracker bracelets.  The wait would still have been a long time, even if EVERYONE had pre-registered, because none of the pre-registration credentials were being recognized.  However, the wait was even LONGER because only fifty five to sixty percent of the kiosks were working, and only forty five to fifty of them working completely.

We were then treated to spending huge amounts of time standing and waiting.  The shortest wait, after the registration debacle, was twenty minutes before getting to the "Interactive" area.  This consisted mostly of cheesy games (more at home at Castles and Coasters than a groundbreaking technological marvel) that had simply been reskinned with Marvel characters. But, most of the Marvel Experience was the waiting.  Waiting for the "3-D" and the "4-D" experiences.  Both of these were notable lacking in at least one advertised dimension. The 3-D Projection wasn't even working, so the glasses they handed us were handed right back.  This after a forty five to fifty minute wait.  The wait to go from the "3-D" part to the "4-D" ride was only twenty to twenty five minutes... But, also NO 3-D!!!

So we spent two and a half hours getting less than half of what we paid for.  The only thing this had in common with Marvel was the name, as well as the waiting that Marvels dedicated fans do.  But, at least that waiting pays off in dividends of great comics, movies and TV series.  The "Marvel Experience" was the waiting but, it was only followed by profound disappointment.

Also, the staff couldn't have been more disorganized and I'll-informed if they were the voting public.

This event was an over-hyped, under-delivered, bad faith rip-off.  We will pursue this as far as we need to get resolution.  I can't get the time from my limited life back that was wasted this morning back from them but, they can sure as Hell give me back my money.

Holy Elephant Balls, Buddha! This place is incurrydible!!! Okay, okay I'll stop.

So my wife and I decided to hook up for lunch.  She works downtown so I decided to head down that way and pick her up.  I suggested Thai Elephant because I had never been, and she raved about the Pad Thai she had ordered a couple weeks ago.  It's located on Adams just West of Central Ave., and parking is scarce.  Make sure to have some change for the meter!

I knew I was at home when I saw the "People Love Us On Yelp" sticker on their door.  It was about 1 pm so the lunch crowd wasn't in FULL effect.  There were about 10 empty tables in which we had our pick. We sat by the window.  My wife ordered the Drunken Noodles with Chicken (a la medium), and I ordered the Green Curry with Chicken (a la medium).  A round of Thai Tea was also added to the bill.  Our food came out in about 4 minutes, which came as a shocker! Yes, I said shocker... I was pleasantly surprised!

The moment I slammed my chompers onto the emerald dripping chicken, I became green with envy. Envious of all the people who have eaten here in the past and had such a precious secret hidden up their sleeves.  I sniffled a bit, but not from emotion.  It was the green curry and its beautiful spices stroking my mucus glands in just the right way.  A bit of rice and a sip of the Thai Tea (I'll get into in a second) and I was right back on track.

The Thai Tea. Ooohhhh, the Thai Tea!  It was $2.50 and twice as large as the ones I order from The Street.  It was like being chosen by Ganghis Khan to sit alongside him in Xanadu and drink the Milk of Paradise (Rush Reference).  It was sweet, as you would expect paradise to be, and creamy. I began to float out of my chair and harpies wiped my nose as I sipped the golden brown goblet of goodness.

Service was Spectacular
Food was Fabulous
Portions were Phenomenal

Dare I say it? 5 Big Ones, Mr. Elephant... and I shall return!

This place is great. I can't believe I've never been here before. I've been severely missing out. Old Vegas charm meets unglamorous dive bar. Perfection. This place gets it. 

Liam (Door staff) is one of the most genuinely nicest guys in town. He proves that you don't have to be a douche to control the door. **Other bars take note!!
I was told it's the oldest bar in Vegas, but technically there's a bar that's been open (consecutively) longer. I haven't been to that bar either, so as far as I'm concerned this is the oldest. I love the old style memorabilia. Bathrooms are surprisingly clean. 
This place rocks! Drinks are cheap and delicious. I was a little hesitant to order a dirty martini in a such a distinct dive bar, but I couldn't stop my mouth from saying the words. Not to worry, because it came out perfect. Absolutely perfect. 

Everyone is extremely friendly. Our waitress was adorable and attentive. She told me her name, but of course I forgot.

Patio:  Unfortunately the view isn't that great.. right now you are just facing a dirt lot, but it's still spacious and nice to have the option.  

Pros: Bike rake. I'm new to biking, so I'm on the lookout for downtown bars with bike racks. 

I didn't see a liquor store section, but apparently you can buy some of the bottles from behind the bar.

I wish I could rate this place with 0 stars. 

Came here to see Hardwell and W&W for EDC week. My host put me under a guestlist and said to come by 10 because we had a group of guys. The rate they told us was $75 for males and 0 cover charge for the ladies. We got there before 10, and asked the guys with the suits with the mini ipads about the rates and they had said the same. fast foward 2 hours and we finally reach the front of the line to only be told  guys were $170 and ladies were $66. 

....are you serious? We could've just bought tickets, but the host personally said that he would put us on guest list and we would be able to get in with no problem. 

Anyways, we were trying to make a decision to pay the fee or not, another guy in a suit with the ipad in his hand shoved us out of the line yelling, "step off the line if you're not paying". Uh, hello. You clearly see us discussing if we want to pay or not. Not even a half second later, the same guy grabbed me and threw me off the line telling us off. Where is the professionalism? TRAIN YOUR STAFF PLEASE.

After what I went through with the staff,  I don't think I will ever come here again.

This review is for the 2012 Electric Daisy Carnival at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.  They should have called it the Electric Daisy Clusterfuck.  Nothing good can come out of 200,000+ people on drugs trying to figure anything out.  Here are a list of the pros and cons of the event:
PROS:
There were a lot of cool things to look at, including parades, rides, lights, and art installations.
Despite huge crouds, I did not personally witness any violence or riot behavior.

People were pretty chilll
CONS:

Traffic was a huge clusterfuck.  It took us 2 hours to drive the 20 miles to the venue on Friday, and 3 hours on Saturday.  

LInes to get in were also long and out of control.  We were sent to three different lines from staff when they told us to "go to the next gate, there is no line".  On the way, other ravers were walking toward us, claiming they were told the same thing.  

There was clearly no communication between staff members.

Hope you're not a fan of toilet paper or washing your hands after using a tiolet shared with tens of thousands of people.  The sanitation conditions are horrific.  

Not a single event staff member knew where water stations, bathrooms, lockers, first aid, or parking lots were located.  After each time we asked a staff member a question (like, which way to Lot 9?  Where are the lockers?  Where is the nearest water refill station?) we were met with an apathetic, "I don't know..."

Las Vegas PD clearly turned a blind eye to those who were endangering themselves and others- While stuck in traffic on the way to the LVMS, I saw TWO trucks with passengers riding in the bed of the truck drinking.  These people were not pulled over by police, which made me nervous as to what else was going on in plain sight.  I'm not stupid, I know that people go to these events to party and do drugs, but it scares me to think that there are people blatantly endangering themselves and others and no one is doind anything about it. 

The fact that the event was shut down at 1 am on Saturday didn't contribute to this shitty one star reivew- it is because of the obvious greed exhibited by Insomniac and Pasqual Rotella to oversell a venue to almost 300.000 people promising that it will be a safe experience.  I feel like they took our money and then said, "Thanks, and fuck you" since it was clear that there was no training what so ever for event staff, nor did they seem like they cared at all about any of us.  Personally, I will NEVER attend another Insomniac event.  Someone was injured Sunday night in an accident which is unforutnate, but I am glad (and surprised) that there were no deaths this year.  Fuck you, Insomiac, you selfish rat bastards.  

TLDR: Don't waste your money or time on this clusterfuck of an event.  Bottom line: I felt UNSAFE and taken advantage of during the entire experience.

Hello Katsu if you are reading this, this is Lt. Col. Nakamura's son. I met you in front of the Japanese Specialties store. I just want to thank you for all your hard work, and congratulations on opening up your restaurant. I know you have only been open for a few days but every Japanese person I know already thinks you have the best Ramen-Ya in Las Vegas. I also want to add that you have the very very best Tan Tan Men I have ever had in my life. It is even better than the Tan Tan Men at the world famous Chin-Ma-Ya. 

Sorry to Yoshi and my friends at Ramen Sora, but FUKUMIMI has officially taken the top spot on my "Best Ramen in Las Vegas" list. The bowl of Tan Tan Men I had here the other day was not just the best Tan Tan Men, but it was the very best bowl of Ramen I have ever had. Way better than anything you would find at one of the MON restaurants. FUKUMIMI is also the only Japanese restaurant in all of Las Vegas that has a bowl of Tan Tan Men that leans more on the Japanese spectrum. The Tan Tan Men at Shuseki is more of the Chinese variation, which is also really good but not exactly what I am looking for. Katsu who is the owner and chef at FUKUMIMI has put in years of experimenting to get the exact perfect balance of spice and sweetness for his Tan Tan.  Not to mention, the texture and thickness of the broth was almost like curry, and the big pieces of bok choy just made an already perfect bowl of Ramen even more perfect. 

FUKUMIMI is practically a one man operation. The owner is also the lead chef, and he makes sure that every little thing is absolutely perfect down to the smallest detail.  You know a restaurant is going to be good when the chef who created the recipes is also the one cooking for you. And, just to let you guys know,  FUKUMIMI is NOT a multi-million dollar bankrolled Ramen-Ya like Monta.  FUKUMIMI is the underdog now, but I predict in a couple of months they will have way more business than the other Ramen-Ya's here in Vegas because every Japanese person will tell you that the best Ramen comes from small family operated restaurants, not some big chain ala Santouka. 

I also want to thank the staff at FUKUMIMI for being so hospitable to my Korean Mother who told me that the inhouse-made Kim-uchi was way better than Korean Kimchi. She and her other Korean friends loved it.

I really encourage all the Japanese-Americans here in LV and Henderson to come support this business.

5-stars and my favorite Ramen-Ya in Vegas, and my 2nd favorite Japanese restaurant in Vegas(right behind Shogo's Sushi on Rainbow).

The food here is a solid 3 stars, but the consistently amazing service is enough to bump it up to 4.

This is NOT an authentic Mexican restaurant, it caters to the middle aged American palate. That being said, they do a great job with that. All of the usual suspects like combo plates with burritos, tacos, tostadas, tamales etc.. But also some dishes with nopales (cactus) and calabaza (pumpkin) to make some feel like maybe they're eating adventurously.

What stands out the most here is that they are all about the freebies, and I think that's really what draws the crowd here. Heaping baskets of chips with endless bean dip and salsa. Fideo soup to start every meal (they even asked me if I wanted more) and they gave me a side of vegetables with my dinner for free. They also have free grilled onions and jalapeos. They ALSO honored some happy hour prices for some patrons at the table next to me even though happy hour was over to which those people exclaimed "now that's service!" No.. It's not.. You're just jerks, and they're just really nice. A server who couldn't honor happy hour prices when it's been over for an hour isn't a bad server.

The fajitas are their claim to fame here, and while they are impressive upon delivery, I found them to be quite bland. The tall flame is a gimmick, but I think it's fun anyway. All of the food is solid.. But the check backs, friendly chatter, anticipation of your needs and presence of the servers without being overbearing is really impressive. Just don't come expecting something that your abuela used to make for you.

I was glad to finally check this one off my bookmark list. I'm not sure what took me so long to try this place. It's right down the street and the pictures always looked so yummy. 
If it's your first time here, ordering can be a bit overwhelming. So many choices, options, do I sit down first? No. Stand in line and order at the counter. Pretty cool you get to watch them prepare your pie right as you order it. There's an array off toppings to choose from. Don't go crazy. I think they recommend no more than 3 toppings to ensure even cooking in their wood fired brick oven. They pop it in and 90 seconds later, Voil it's done. This is the type of pizza my inner fat kid would eat everyday. But I'll try to be good and limit myself. This won't be easy. :)

My only dissappointment (actually there is one more and it has to do with cold balls...proceed with caution) with the Herberger was I thought it was called the Hamburger Theatre and was looking forward to a meaty snack. But alas. It is the Herberger. Not the Himberger. Or the Itsmyberger. The Herberger. Rickie was an "esteemed and prestigious" judge at the Miss Black Arizona Pagaent. A pagaent, mind you, that lasted SIX hours. So I was a frequent customer at the bar. And the restroom. So I can attest to good bar service. One time as I grabbed a cookie from the bar, he politely told me they were $1.50. Oops. Color me red. I had started out in the VIP lounge where everything was complimentery. Including the ice cold meatballs. But I digress. The restrooms. Clean. Really, really clean. The box office staff was friendly and helped find the right person who had my ticket. Rickie had already been seated. You know, as the "esteemed and prestigious judge". I was basically road kill at this point. Finally got my balcony seat and had a great view of the pagaent and could see Rickie writing and watch him texting me. Now back to the VIP Lounge. No bar set up. Which equals no adult beverages. Kinda sucked. And the food was COLD. I met the craziest pagaent moms. One lady, in fun, even told me to "talk to the hand". I kid you not. Oh. Parking you ask?  Across the street. I think we spent five bucks. I would most definitely return to the Herberger. I will remember to bring my own cookies and to ask how long the show will be. The art scattered about was enjoyable and the theatre itself was quite beautiful. Hopefully sometime soon the Pet Shop Boys will perform here. That's all I have...

Those who live by the sword...

We came here last evening around six for quick bite and walked in on a crazy house.  You couldn't tell it by the two other couples eating here.  It was only when we got to the counter and discovered they couldn't stop taking telephone Take-Out orders to take ours. LOL  

We actually didn't wait too long, maybe ninety seconds.  But the phones were ringing off the hook!  China Jade is basically an old style Chinese Take-Out place, doubling as a restaurant.  Gaging by the phones ringing every thirty seconds, there's no need to change their setup.  You don't fix things that aren't broken.

China Jade's weakness isn't the food. It's the hurried service to get back to the phones.  I am not exaggerating this point.  It was almost bye-bye cell phone as they nearly spilt the soup in their rush. And, since China Jade is built for takeout, you'll find a lot of plastic plates and utensils. The soup BTW was served in a  plastic 16 oz "To Go" container (photo).

From our standpoint this is all minor stuff, if the food is good.  Last night the food was very good and just short of Four Stars. 

We had the Hot & Sour Soup (photos), eight Fried Dumplings, Sesame Chicken with Fried Rice and a soft drink; all for just $18 including tax. Nice! 

So, Three and a Half Stars "A-OK" and we'll be back; most likely for Take-Out. LOL

I think I had the #7 and the #41 add tofu. My friend John had the #8 and the #38 complete with fish balls....who knew...fish...had balls? Or was it the #6 and the #39. I don't know. I was distracted by the ambiance. Old tiled floors. Really funny, faux velvet art deco chairs and tables that could have used a little Windex. We were greeted immediately, sat, received water and then...well...waited and waited. I didn't want to be to rude but finally flagged someone down. 

You could tell this was a family run gig...dad type figure bussing tables, little kids running around with rice falling out of their mouths (seriously, it wasn't gross, but kinda sweet) and the big mama just kinda surveying the scene. Meanwhile the younger men ran the floor. Our order was finally taken and food was delivered swiftly. The spring rolls did not dissapoint....so fresh, so delicious...who needs a fried spring roll any more? The menu was so huge and intimidating I basically just pointed at something and blurted out the number. 

Taking the safe route was kind of boring I realize but the noodles were yummy, the veggies crisp and the tofu was amazing. I watched the other patrons (i.e. anybody that wasn't white) to see what they ordered. It was Pho all around. Next time it's Pho for Pho sure! 

Great experience. Would totally order a tray of those spring rolls for a party. And next time in addition to Pho I'll have Alexander C.'s fave Banh. He says it makes him horny you know!? Oh. The prices were unbelievably low! I could have paid the entire bill with change from the cracks of my sofa cushions.

I must confess that this was my first time eating Salvadoran food.  I don't know much about Salvadoran cuisine except that pupusas are a staple and after my first bite, I'm kicking myself for not trying pupusas earlier.  I wish I ordered two!  

While nachos are pretty standard everywhere, I will say their beans are quite flavorful and doesn't seem to be the generic straight-out-of-the-can kind.  It's really nothing to write home about but it was still tasty and I'm glad I shared because it was a pretty big portion .  Their pupusas though...  Oh my.  Thick cornmeal tortillas filled with cheese and pork for around $2 a pop.  It came with a cabbage slaw and this watery tomato salsa.  I don't know if I was eating it correctly but I piled my pupusas with some slaw, sprinkled on the salsa, and tore into it with my hands.  Hey, it strikes me as street food and ain't nobody got time for a fork and knife.  It was bliss!  The pupusas was delicious without the slaw and salsa but with everything on it, it was refreshing and even more flavorful.  My mouth is drooling just thinking about today's lunch.

Cristina's is a nice clean restaurant with a slow but steady crowd.  The cashier was friendly, answered all our noob questions, and was patient.  Their staff size seems to consist of two people so it's a bit of a wait but it's definitely worth it.  I'll definitely be sneaking over this gem of a place while I work.  :)

At last, Mr. Lee's Woonam Jung adds AYCE Korean BBQ to their menu. Ordering their tender, delicious Kalbi a la carte certainly put a hole in my pocket. As tasty as it was, I had a difficult time paying $30 for a plate of it on top of whatever entree I ate. Sura has some serious competition now that Mr. Lee threw his hat into the AYCE KBBQ ring. 

For a measly $26 at dinner, you can fill your three stomachs with all the Kalbi you want and your other three with bulgogi, chadolbaegi (thinly sliced beef brisket), samgyupsal (pork belly), dak (chicken) bulgogi , deh ji (pork) bulgogi plus the steamed egg and doenjang jjigae (soybean soup) traditionally served with a Korean BBQ meal. Given you have six full stomachs and still have room to spare, all of this and more is 'bottomless' and you still get a 5-star worthy selection of fresh banchan. 

Think of those pricey front-loading washer/dryers. Yeah, those shiny, fancy ones that are so quiet you can take a nap in the laundry room. They're considerably less annoying than their top-loading ancestors. Where am I going with this? Woonam Jung uses the fancy front-loaders of BBQ hoods--nearly silent and 1,000x more efficient. You won't have to project your voice over a noisy fan and you'll go home smelling like your perfume of the night instead of grilled meat. 

While Woonam Jung doesn't look like much from the outside, the inside is nicely decorated and has this Asian tranquility thing going for it. In short, it's a more luxurious establishment to stuff your face. If you want to up your dining experience or fancy up the act of over-eating, Woonam Jung's food presentation, modern plates, and cute server uniforms will not disappoint.

AYCE BBQ is available at lunch-time. But I hope you like bulgogi because kalbi isn't served until dinner. And if for whatever reason you're not into the AYCE BBQ thing or great deals make you feel cheap, BBQ is still available to purchase a la carte and their other entrees are flat out delicious! The yukgaejang and dolsot bibimbap are two of my favorites.

With all the stress in my life, I could really use a bank that gives some sort of thought to something...anything at all.  

However.....

**Boring story**

I put in an online request for a transfer last week, and a couple days later I got an email saying that the transfer had been initiated.  The days since the request have been the busiest I've ever experienced, leaving little time to think about sleep, much less think about my money.  Today, I needed to get a cashier's check, but when I went to the bank, I found that the transfer never went through.  So, I spent 20 minutes on hold with customer service while they tried to figure out why it had been canceled.

**End boring story**

Okay anyway.  The gist is that the transfer didn't go through, but they never let me know that they had canceled it.

Dudes.  If my shit doesn't go through, fucking tell me my shit didn't go through!  How hard is it to set up automatically generated emails to let people know stuff?  If the universe weren't looking out for me, this could have spelled disaster for my new living situation...and made my already tearfully stressful life, well, disastrous.

In addition to all this, they have different systems for California, Washington, and the rest of the country, which makes my banking life even more complicated because my account was opened in Virginia, I live in California, and spend a lot of time in Seattle (woo!).  

Dear B of A, your cheap lollipops don't make up for your thoughtlessness and stressfulness and complication-inducing awfulness.  You better fucking be glad I got some sleep last night and I'm in a good mood.

Upscale gourmet burger places are popping up all over the Valley.  Except this one is different!

I could write about how they are better than Coal Burger(?), Five Guys or ZinBurgers, but why do that -- since they did a much better job:

"While most people are eating breakfast, we''re already doing lunch -- shaping fresh 100% Certified Angus Beef into plump meatballs.  (When was our beef frozen, by the way?  Try never.)

"Why meatballs, not patties?  Because unlike the other burger places, we don''t squish.  We smash.  Place your order and we spring into action, painting the grill with real butter, adding a dash of our secret spice blend, and smashing the meatball with a tool we invented ourselves (it''s so new, it doesn''t even have a name -- let''s just call it the smashing tool).

Okay, their corporate marketing aside, we had a very nice time here yesterday.  One of us ordered the large Smashburger Arizona, with Habanero cheese, quacamole, jalapeos on their spicy chipotle bun for $6.99(photo), along with the French Fries for $2.29(photo).  Ohh, was that good!

We also ordered the large Mushroom Swiss Smashburger for $6.99, and the Haystack Onions for $2.29.  Everything was outstanding and yummy.  

Yummy? Yes, yummy!  Like, why waste your time going somewhere else yummy!  Oh, yeah the bill for two came to $22.  Did I mention that Smashburger was an upscale gourmet burger place?  But that did include drinks and some sides.

I know that might be too Richie Rich$$ for some, so you can drive down FLW to In 'n Out and order it Animal Style.  But if you do, you will be missing an outstanding and delicious burger!  LOL

Enjoy!

Why does everything have to be SO BIG?! Usually we Yelpers don't complain about that (ha!), but in this case it's just ridiculous. Not to mention the potential for inducing heart attacks is immeasurably increased. It must be part of the appeal / gimmick, but too bad larger sizes don't translate to better food quality.

We were here for breakfast at 8 AM after a long night of partying and gambling (we hadn't slept yet) so at this point everything * should * have tasted good, right?

My Grilled Cheese with ham was hearty and a decent size -- thankfully not a monstrosity. The "Hash Browns" were more like a plateful of overcooked potato chunks, most of which were too hard in texture to eat. The "Side of Bacon" turned out to be an overflowing platter of much-too-crunchy, strange looking meat strips.

Service was friendly when we arrived, but seemed more hassled as the room began filling up for breakfast. 

All in all, an okay experience but would only come back for convenience (a.k.a. when staying at the Mirage and cannot make it to a restaurant outside the hotel).

TIP: Size isn't everything.

DATE TIP: Size isn't everything. Wait, what?! I'm talking about the sandwiches!

Came here with a group of friends to see The Green perform.. While walking up to BB we saw a huge line of people and got worried but that was just the line for the box office.. If you had already purchased your ticket, you were able to walk straight to the entrance and head up the escalators... 

I really love the space of BB.. You are free to stand and listen to the music, get as close to the stage or as far away as you want, dance with your friends or go outside on the patio and hang out.. At one point one of my GFs and I were too drunk and wanted to sit down so we got a table in the restaurant section.. which BTW from our booth, we had a great view of the stage.. We ordered cheese fries which came out to be over $13 (a bit overpriced IMO) but service was friendly, especially the drink runner, Pons!

I will definitely be coming back to the Brooklyn Bowl and will hopefully be taking advantage of some of the bowling promotions that they do for locals~

HOT TIP: BUY YOUR TICKETS IN ADVANCE! It's cheaper and gets you in faster...

For brunch we decided to come to  Bouchon, and it didn't disappoint. From the get-go the service was top-notch. Our( forgot his name) waiter did an amazing job. He explaining the special they had that day and for his services. But I had to give it to the manager Jonathan. He was so professional,and friendly. He kept on coming by to our table and asking if the food  tasted to our likening. 
As for the food their pastries were fabulous. It was fresh and was  still nice and warm, and not to sweet. Highly recommend the pastrie platter.
The special omelette with skirt steak and potato was just ok. Nothing to fancy  about it.
Their chicken and waffle is a must try dish. The chicken was so moist and well season. The waffle with bacon bits and chives was awesome.
In the end it was a great brunch, and amazing service from start to finish.
Thank you again Jonathan for your hospitality, and your staff for an excellent service, and the wonderful food.

Our first Fox restaurant was Sauce, which we like very much and continue to go back for both lunch and dinner.

Since then, it's been mostly down hill. We have been to Blanco twice, North once and now The Greene House.  My feeling with each of these places is that they're one or maybe two food items good.  The rest is just m'eh!  

Clearly the Fox group knows how to make a very good, flavorful taco. Four Stars good, both here and at Blanco. As for the rest of the story, to paraphrase Paul Harvey....  

We came here yesterday for a light lunch. I spotted the Tuna Tartar tacos on the menu and knew I had to try them.  At the time, I hadn't seen any of the posted pictures on Yelp. Too bad .

The tacos were three tiny, minuscule things about three inches wide.  Our server did try to warn us they were small and asked if I wanted a fourth?  Sure, I said. So three tiny tacos for $13.00 and the fourth for $4.50. Were they good?  Yes. Were they better than the ones down the street at Tommy Bahamas? Sadly no. 

My lunch partner had their Fish and Chips for $15.00 and was very unimpressed.  "Bland and nothing special, mushy and greasy" were his exact words.

The lunch bill for two came to $38.75, along with one Iced Tea.  A little pricey for a Two and Half Star experience.. 

Sorry!

How many bites does it take to get to the lamb filled center of a gyros-pop?

I'd say one, cause if you can't find gyros on the first bite, there's probably something wrong with your order ;-) ... are you sure you didn't order the chicken?

And you thought I was going to say something deep and meaningful, you obviously don't know me that well.

Cypress Grill is my favorite place for a gyros in Central Phoenix. There's a handful of them around (gyros spots that is), but if you're looking for a gyros and within a few miles of this place, I'd say skip all the rest. I've tried at least five or so spots that serve em nearby. You'll spend a couple bucks more here than at the other places, with a gyro running you about $8, but I'm happy to conclude that Cypress is my favorite gyro in town.

The hummus here is good, so is the spanikopita and dolmades. For those of you who are carb counting, you can get your gyros in a salad too. I've done that a few times myself. All in all a solid choice for medditeranean dining - one of the better spots in the area. 

Happy Yelping Phoenix!

I've had this place bookmarked for a long time &  finally got a chance to try it out!!

As with all AYCE, not everything will be the best quality, but you get good quality fish for a reasonable price.

Some of our faves of the night were:
yellowtail - very fresh & creamy
lychee sorbet - THE best sorbet, mmmmm
strawberry mochi - I love mochi
unagi - good texture, not slimy
pork belly - great grill flavor but kinda fatty
salmon
scallop
poke salad
cucumber salad
gyozas

Some of our not so faves of the night were:
uni - not freshest
sweet shrimp was ok 
tuna - not fresh

The location is nice but pretty far from the strip, about 10 minutes drive.  The ambiance is really cute.  Loved the decor and bar area.  It is smaller than I would have expected, about 15 tables and a bar.

The service is top notch as we were never rushed.  Even when we spent about 2.5 hours, they still made sure we got everything we wanted.  I ordered extra dessert a couple of times (hehe).

Definitely recommended for being piggies in the desert!!  What's Vegas without all the munching!!  Don't forget to get a stampcard, buy 10 get 1 free!

Oh no, not another Starbucks review. But, read on.

I come here two to four times a week, mostly to relax and have some quiet time. If you come here often, you might find that statement funny, since there's always a steady stream of folks coming and going.  But the line is never longer than three, go figure.

This is an above average location for Starbucks, in so far that you have the space to linger, sip your beverage, snack and read a paper. The wall spaces have a few 110 outlets, so you know who sits there.  But the beauty here are the spaces that come away from the wall, which are always free. 

As others have noted, the drive-thru is a mess. So I've never understood why more patrons haven't decided to come inside and see how friendly and inviting this store really is.  All the employees are great btw.  Fortunately most have decided to stay in their cars. Fortunate for me. LOL

I've found 6:30 to 7:30 am and 2:00 to 4:00 are good times to linger.  If you do, I'll be sitting at the big table near the door. Stop by and say "hi"! 

So, three and seven-eighths Stars, and yes, I am a fan.

Oh, Bouchon. I love you oh so much. We usually pick one schmancy dinner during a Vegas trip, and since I'm not one for the over-the-top fancy $500 per person dinners, Bouchon suited me just fine.

First of all, I realize you're supposed to order wine with all things Frenchy, but I've gotta say the cocktails at Bouchon are spectacular. Supremely amazing. I had a Bulleit Old Fashioned - and it was one helluva Old Fashioned.

Of course the service is more than superb. And makes you really feel like it's worth every penny that you're spending. 

The food? Ah. Delicious. I never ever get chicken at a restaurant, but something about the chicken on the menu at Bouchon struck my fancy. And I ordered right. That roast chicken was just superb. So amazing perfect. 

Like I said worth every penny. Sure, it's not quite as pricey as some of the places on the strip (at around $80-$100 p/p), but you'll be in store for a fantastic dinner, that's for certain.

The absence of flaw in beauty is itself a flaw.

I was in Phoenix for 17 hours a couple of days ago.  

It was a perfectly warm day outside, one of those beautiful early fall days in the desert when the sun bathes everything in clear, comforting sunlight.  It felt great just walking around Kierland Commons in the warm, late afternoon sunshine. 

My friend chose her favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix, Shogun, for dinner.  We got there fairly early and sat at the sushi bar.  Looking around, I noticed that I was the only Buddhahead in the restaurant (and I'm only half-Asian).  "This can't be a good sign", I thought.  Don't' get me wrong:  I don't believe that a restaurant operator's ethnicity must match the culinary heritage of the food he serves.  This can't be right.  Food, like human compassion and friendship, transcends race and ethnicity.  

My friend ordered most of the items off the menu.  We started with a Sunshine Roll, which was heaping mounds of spicy tuna loaded onto a modified California Roll.  The sauce for the spicy tuna was heavily mayonnaise based, which was a bit odd.  It was different, but tasty and original.

The Wahoo Sashimi in ponzu sauce with sliced cucumbers was light and delicate.  Wahoo is ono in Hawaii and is a white fish that is mild and slightly sweet.  It went well with the citrus ponzu.  

The Veggie Roll was odd in that the ingredients didn't blend together at all.  It consisted of cooked asparagus, some kind of weird takuan (pickled daikon radish) that was a bit bitter, kimpira gobou (burdock root), and shisou (mint leaf).  All the wasabi and gari in the world couldn't fix this roll. 

We also had Shake Sushi (Salmon Sushi), Octopus Salad, and some edamame.

The sushi here was so far off the beaten path that the tastes were a bit off, they were almost uncomfortable to my palate.  But, it's good to try different styles of food in different settings.

Food doesn't have to be perfect, or authentic, to be enjoyable.

This is without a doubt my favorite club to go to in Vegas!!! 

I was told that they started selling tickets for the outside section only? I totally see how that can be a great idea because I like the outside section more than the inside section. 

The inside section is only fun when I go with a large group of guys to protect me from other people bumping into me... cause if I'm just with my girl friends I'm usually the crazy one that will go and push other people back. That's just too much work!! The stage is pretty dope though. I've seen a bunch of people here, including Dead Mau5 2 years ago and David Guetta over Memorial's Day Weekend. 

Nevertheless that outside area is what really does it for me :D you can dance and take pictures by the pool!! There's an outside bar also!! It isn't hot and stuffy, and it definitely isn't as crowded as the inside!! The only setback is when it rains O_O' When it started sprinkling on Saturday night, I was very worried for my hair and make up... Thankfully the sprinkles stopped and my friends and I were able to party it up!! 

Caution: Don't get pushed into the pool!! I actually know some of the girls who got pushed into the pool this past weekend... Drunk people =/ tsk tsk

It's almost been five years since we first started coming to Corleone's and nearly two and a half since my last review.

Corleone's hasn't changed much during that period of time, which is a very good thing.  You see, Corleone's is primarily a Philly Steak place that makes a great New York cheese pizza.  It's more authentic and tastier than either Ray's, or NYPD.

As a family, we order a few pies each month whenever we do not feel like cooking.  They deliver, but we like to visit and pick up our order.  Another east coast authentic food they offer are the Tastykakes snack food and warm pretzels.  I know this might appear to be trivial.  But, it's this attention to detail that impresses me most about Corleone's.  Yes, you could open a Philly cheese steak place, but would you bother to bring in Taskykakes?

A great thing about Corleone's is all the coupons they offer.  You order a pie, there's a coupon sticker on the box.  Open the mail, yep coupons there too.  They even have $2.00 off coupons on the top of your receipt.  So they're always hustling for your business.  But if the food wasn't good... it  wouldn't matter.

The 18 inch cheese pizza is still $8.99, less a two dollar coupon if you have one. LOL  It's thin and has the right amount of sauce and cheese.  It also flop when you pick it up.  Delicious!

Enjoy!~

Lord knows how many businesses have come and gone at this address over the years like Underworld, Black Label, and Emergency Room etc.  Its transformation into Gyu-Kaku has been nothing short of amazing.  The ultra cool lit entrance begged the question...does Tron eat here?  Being seated while a female sung cover of Savage Garden's "Truly, Madly, Deeply" at 300 BPM's blared through the stereo made me think it possible if he were drunk.  

We considered the course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 for a moment but saw a lot of filler that would have ended up untouched like cheese wontons, chicken cheese fondue, house salad, fried chicken (ok,ok, maybe one piece), calamari and S'mores.  Our initial server, Keiko, recommended we start with the spicy cabbage salad over the kim-chee.  Thankfully, we listened.  Crispy, spicy and dare I say refreshing?  It was a fine way to whet our appetite.        
 
Standing out among with meats was the beef tongue and harami skirt steak.  Quality matched the price and both delivered on what decent yakiniku should be.  We also enjoyed the kalbi short rib and although the Angus beef ribs were a little too fatty for the wife, I happily devoured it.  The mushroom medley cooked in an unbeatable combination of soy sauce and butter was a nice side dish.  

The only letdown was the "Spicy Kalbi Bibimbap".  They got the stone pot right but the rest of it?  It was as if it were made by a northern Swedish resident with no knowledge of Korean cuisine attempting to replicate it through hearsay.  I would have rather ordered the sliced duck breast, an atypical yakiniku offering, or dessert over this pointless filler.  

Despite that, I know I'll be back and stick to grilling.  It's yet another welcome dining choice around Spring Mountain.  3.46729311238987 stars.

First thing you should know is you are "not suppose" to drink on this LED lit bar on wheels. It is "suppose" to only transport you from bar to bar to get your drink on. Here are my tips to make this experience all you ever dreamed of.....

*Pick only your coolest friends who know how to party. This is key to the whole equation equaling awesome.

*Load your ipod with all of your favorite gangsta rap and the Killers or whatever gets you in the mood to fuckin' rage. This crazy apparatus does not have tunes of it's own. All good, just come prepared.

*Adjust your damn seat. You may be too faded to hear the dude running the show point this out. If you are part hobbit like myself you have to lower that seat or you may not be able to sit like a normal human being for days and it will royally suck balls.

*Master the art of fake peddling. News flash: YOU DON'T HAVE TO PEDDLE IN REAL LIFE TO MAKE THIS BIKE MOVE. IT'S A MAGIC BAR BIKE YOU CAN'T DRINK ON. Pretending is always more fun. What's even more fun is if you look around at your friends really peddling like this is a high intensity spin class. Just smile and wave and do your fake peddling. It's Friday night and this is not the Tour De Vegas. It's like a booze cruise on the city streets.

*Tell the man in charge where you want to go. Otherwise he will take you to lame places like the Nacho Daddy or other lame tourist traps. Create your own destiny guys.

*Bring a "coffee thermos or something" filled with a tasty beverage that you can disguise as water or coffee or hot chocolate. That's all I have to say about that. If you can't decode that message than maybe you should just be home playing Candy Crush or something. 

That's all I got. Overall this is an amazing experience with the right group of people and the right music and right level of intoxication. Not 5 stars for me because the owner should A. Have his own music program. B. Negotiate drink deals with the local bars he drags you to. C. I wish it lasted longer. 

Enjoy the ride......

Taking up residence where Ivan Kane's Forty Deuce used to be is the newest Speakeasy to hit the strip. There's something fun and exciting about entering through a secret door and needing a password to get in. 

I wasn't sure of the stats on the place, so I had called Mandalay Bay box office and the woman had no info to give me, I wasn't sure if we needed tickets prior, or if we purchase there, I then searched the actual 1923 website and didn't get any info there as well. I ended up speaking with concierge and she was the most helpful, this is the info I can pass along to others:

*No cover charge for locals
*$20 cover for non-locals 
*If you're interested in getting a table, you can email info@1923lv.com and they should get back to you within 24 hours.

If you show up around 10p and get yourself a seat at the bar, you'll have a perfect view for the stage, the entire place only holds 150 people, and the place got packed really quick, there were no seats or anywhere to stand by 11. Holly Madison performs 3 times nightly, and the shows run from 11p-2a. 

Jazz band plays intermittently throughout the night as well as a house DJ. They have a small specialty cocktail menu, Pisco Sour included. Our bartender, Marvin, was able to create a cocktail off menu by us telling him what our likes are. 

They have a cigar room in the back and they also sell them at the bar. They do allow smoking in the lounge, and it did get pretty smokey between the cigarettes and cigars, so be warned. 

I loved the burlesque dancers, the 1920's inspired outfits of the cocktails waitresses and bartenders were classy, and the prohibition style cocktails were good. I'd for sure come back.

Not. 
A.
Fan.

Don't believe me? Ask Steven or Liz (not Steve L or Liz B, but Steven V and Liz H) they've had the unfortunate task of witnessing me throwing a temper tantrum on more than one occasion at the door. (But they like, and I like them, and so I go.)

Why? BECAUSE THEY CHARGE A COVER! Even if it's 1:30 and they stop serving at 2am. (I almost left this weekend). 

Why does this irk me? 

Because when I pay for something, in this case, to walk inside the door, with that exchange of my hard earned cash comes the expectation I'm going to get something in return. And what do I get for my $5? 

1. A bathroom situation that's an unfortunate cross between a slip-n-slide and a bad Friends re-run all about Joey... "how you doin?" Seriously, can someone mop that floor? It's not safe and it's just plain gross. Couple that with the lurkers that think it's ok to watch me urinate, keep staring and I'm going to stare back, and you know what's going to happen? (Figure it out, when I turn, my whole body comes with me.)

2. Bartenders working for tips find it more important to werk than work. I just want a drink, and I'm already pissed that I paid five bucks for nothing, so get his/her number later and get me alcohol. 

3. Cups on the ground. (Why are their plastic cups on the ground? Always? This isn't Woodstock/SXSW/or anything as cool.) 

I'll stop there. 

I did ask once why there's a cover and I was told, "it keeps the riff-raff out." Not true. I've been, I've seen, the riff-raff find their way in. 

You know who doesn't charge a cover and isn't concerned with riff-raff? Every other bar in Madison.

$5 to get in +
$3 to check my coat = 
$8 to wish I was somewhere else.

I recently had one of the worst days of my life and that's not an exaggeration. I received some really bad news mid day, mid week and kinda walked around in a fog until I get off work at 5:00pm. In a Xanax induced coma; tired and starving due to skipping lunch I happened upon Lucky Boy. I've been meaning to stop in for awhile but just never made it happen.

Now, I'm not one of those chicks that drowns her sorrows in french fries and ice cream, quite the opposite actually so I figured I'd take advantage of my appetite. I ordered an "international burger" and fries and some sort of large carbonated beverage. It was wonderful. The fries were crispy and perfectly salted and the burger was one of the best I've had in a very long time. The ingredients were fresh and the price was right. I'm sure there are better burgers out there, but I can't think of any. I ate the whole fucking thing and was actually sad when the experience was over. 

I'll be back soon to gorge myself on some other menu items. Maybe I'll wait for PMS to kick in, maybe I wont. All I have to say is this- there is something comforting about smothering your insides in cheese and oil. Lucky Boy may not solve all of your problems, but it fills the void in your tummy without having to prepare a meal when you are out of your flippin mind.
And that's something....

I had this crazy fantasy that Mario Batali himself was in the back grinding up Carnevino's riserva, ribeye and porterhouse cuts to be made into patties.  Not exactly the case but the guys behind one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas definitely know beef.  So a visit here was inevitable despite the mixed reviews.

Before B&B burger opened, Batali himself said "The food will be easier to accept if you've never heard of me."  Everyone comes to expect so much with his name on the front.  

My verdict: a damn good burger!  We ordered what most reviewers got and also what the servers recommended.  The "Morning After" was everything I want in a good burger.  The patty was a very juicy medium rare.  The egg on top looked and tasted so perfect upon my first bite which then turned into a beautiful mess of yolk everywhere.  The bun itself was excellent with a kind of croissant quality to it.  I was only able to notice it after eating part of the bun separately though.  The royale with cheese was also very good and my wife preferred this more with all its caramelized onion glory.

I still would have paid more for a riserva patty though :)

I'm a fan, indeed. Especially of the fancy schmancy Perrier-Jouet champagne that kept on going and going. So, for those not in the know, this is a Sunday morning only brunch buffet at Ballys, and it comes with quite the pricetag: $85 per person (about $110/person after tax, tip and such). ...and it's by reservation, so you've gotta plan ahead.

And it is pretty fancy schmancy in there. Not in the modern, Wynn/Encore sorta way, but in the 1955 sorta way.. with waiters in white dinner coats and green striped wallpaper. The food selection is supposed to be amazing, and I concur (mostly), it wasn't bad.

Despite what my profile may say about lobster, the lobster here was actually my favorite thing. ...or maybe it was just the butter I doused it in. Either way, it was one tasty dish. I also tried caviar for the first time, and it wasn't bad, but nothin' to write home about. 

There were crab claws, but not crab legs. There's filet mignon that you can get from the tray, but I recommend asking your waiter for them to cook some to order for you. Other than that, I had some delicious lamb chops, a delish pretzel roll and some pretty decent dessert. 

The real highlight is the service. Even though the buffet is self-serve, our waiter was ON it. I never had an empty champagne glass, and he gladly got our filet mignons to order. 

The ultimate test though... would I go again? Nope. It was worth an experience, but I'm pretty sure I'm just as satisfied (and probably because I'm not a huge lobster fan) with the Spice Market or Wynn buffets.

Ok, Ok, Ok another strip mall restaurant in Phoenix. I get it. We can be a fab place in a drab space. Wow, how cool, I just came up with a new motto. But let me just say, PCG, as the regs call it, is a FAB place. Voted many times as a local hot spot or a great neighborhood spot, PCG actually shines on many levels. Yes, the space itself is not inventive or trendy. But why do we go out to eat? Mostly for some killer ass food. Well, you got it here sister. Appetizer: bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with cotija....yowzaaa yowzaa Potsie. Yummy! The tenderloin rivals Ruth's Chris and any other high end steak place. The corn cakes are, well, let's just say I'd raffle off a limb for these babies. Pot roast is right off my Momma Jo's dining room table. The pork  tenderloin entree makes Miss Piggy cry and me, well I'm weeping already. Juicy, firm white meat with amazing sides. Services runs always a Bplus to and Aplus. Waitstaff knows everyone and is literally family to the owners and management. I LOVE it here. Now, the space. Yes, it's a mini mall. But they've made it iintimate and not sports bar like. The gang here has made a home run on  every level. It's like coming home everytime I eat here. EAT AT PCG people. It'll give strip malls a new meaning!

Wings or prime rib?  Those are probably the two most common choices at this 24 hour restaurant located at the casino level of the Hooters Casino Hotel. The prime rib special is $9.95 all day and you can order 25 cents hot wings with a minimum order of ten from midnight until 6 AM.  The restaurant used to be Dan Marino's and quotes and images of the former NFL Miami Dolphins star quarterback are still a big part of the restaurant's dcor.  Apparently, the recent name change to Mad Onion Fine Foods and Spirits occurred just before Thanksgiving 2009.  

From a distance both specials looked decent, but I made a middle-of-the-night mistake by ordering their half pound Classic Mad Onion Burger.  The unique thing about the Mad Onion burger is having your choice of onions put on your burger.  I chose "carmalized" onions among the list which also included raw onions, sauteed onions, BBQ onions and chipotle onions.  The burger comes with fries also.

At least the fries were hot in temperature because the burger was not.  The food took an excruciating amount of time to come out of the kitchen and when it finally did not only was the burger just warm but the carmalized onions were ice cold.  The half pound sirloin burger did not taste like fresh beef either.  It was a bit too ground up in texture and had a peculiar taste.  I think I made the right decision by tossing most of my food and making a run up to a 24 hour Wendy's at a nearby food court instead.

The Mad Onion staff were nice though, but this place is avoidable.

I take the light rail daily to get from my place in downtown Phoenix to ASU.  As far as public transportation goes this is pretty good.  For the most part the trains come in predictable 10 minute intervals.  I've only experience an extended wait once.  I have waited 40 minutes in -5 degree weather for a T in Boston.  20 minutes is nothing to me.  Having disruptions in service along the way goes with the territory of public transportation.  Heck, it goes with any sort of transportation.  To complain that it is loud is just silly...it's a TRAIN!  I find it to be incredibly quiet when compared to the subway in NY or the T in Boston. Its not some rickety old high speed line or glorified trolley car.
 
Time wise and location wise its very convenient for me.  It takes me the same exact amount of time to get to campus as it would if I drove and it saves me $600 a year in a parking permit  I can take it to any number of local establishments, enjoy Happy Hour in Tempe without having to worry about a DD, and get myself to Chase Field in the summer when its too hot to walk.  (I live close enough where driving there is just plain dumb, but the 20 minute walk in 110 degrees is too much)  Which brings me to my next point, don't smoke crack.  Well not that, (but seriously, don't smoke crack) but I fully intend on using it in the summer.  I can endure standing outside for 10 minutes....if I can endure waiting for the T in a Boston winter, 10 minutes in a Phoenix summer is nothing. (And this will be my 3rd summer here so spare me the "you don't know the summer" lecture).
 
The 11pm end time does kind of suck, but it was 12 in Boston so its not terribly shocking for me.  It means you may have to take a cab home.  Of course livery regulation leaves much to be desired in this city but that is a different review entirely.
 
Now, I do think they could start to sell advertising inside, both for revenue and to give me something to look at.  I do wish the route maps were in better locations throughout the cars.  Placing them only in the middle means a large number of people (oh, like the entire rest of the car...) can't see them.  I also think the hand rails are awkwardly shaped.  The bike racks drive me nuts but I understand their purpose. 
 
But all in all I think it's a good start.  I'm happy to have it- I find it easy to use, clean, quiet and it gets me to where I want to go.  I would like some wifi for when I'm working on my laptop but hey, I'll take what I can get.

Wildlife World Zoo and Aquarium is a privately run zoo, aquarium, and park geared toward families. We visited on a hot afternoon recently and saw a lot of animals that appeared to be well-cared for. 

I am generally zoo-averse. I think it has something to do with having seen "Gorillas in the Mist" and seeing some zoos where the animals are cooped up in cages that are too small for them to live a happy life. I'd rather watch the animals on PBS or go on safari and see the animals in their own habitat. That being said, I am okay with places that take care of animals that are already not in the wild, as long as the conditions are good. 

Wildlife World Zoo's monkeys were purchased from an overseas meat trade (being in a zoo is better than being eaten, I think!). Some of the animals were donated by people who had them and didn't know what to do with them. Some animals were bred in captivity.
 
I thought that the tortoise and the animals in the petting zoo could've used more supervision from zoo staff. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eE4MUd3m6j6yISWjEYjyPQ?select=hvL9zbLpCQLv-ACZ73fI2g I didn't see any guests abusing the animals, but I hope there are cameras or enough staff present to make sure that it never happens. Many animal exhitbits are interactive, and I didn't notice zoo personnel near all of the interactive exhibits.

When you visit the Congo Cooker, they don't provide straws in order to protect the animals. In this case, they're putting the animals first, which is great.

Highlights for us included:

+ Feeding the parrots cut apples which they ate out of our hands. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eE4MUd3m6j6yISWjEYjyPQ?select=CGDdCL2Euu0FU7GFwXuZ_Q
+ Riding the safari train ride where we saw lots of animals. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eE4MUd3m6j6yISWjEYjyPQ?select=XBZ0cTUr0TVos5IKBmpoPw
+ Petting the stingray, sea star, and lobster.
+ Seeing the baby animals.

Tips and other info:

* If you're going during hot weather, visit during the morning before it gets scorching. Save the aquarium for last, since it's cooler inside.

* There are coupons available for discounts of admission in the Entertainment book and local newspaper.

* Tiburon Restaurant is located on the grounds of Wildlife World Zoo and has lovely views of the aquarium. We didn't eat here, though it appears to have nice ambiance and an extensive menu with a variety including a kids' menu. http://www.tiburonrestaurant.net

* The playground is downwind of the petting zoo, so it doesn't smell great there. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eE4MUd3m6j6yISWjEYjyPQ?select=CnTTkQrivcm6QGJvHrnytw

There was one goat in the petting zoo that was especially aggressive with us, which wasn't that fun. We hadn't purchased any feed, so he settled for our clothing. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eE4MUd3m6j6yISWjEYjyPQ?select=A75NiwFXuPt7lwdZXJEUTw All in all, it was a very fun afternoon and a very stimulating place to take kids.

Family Style
This was our convention group dinner. 
They closed the restaurant to accommodate over 200 of us. 

The restaurant is on the second floor of the masquerade tower at the Rio Hotel. 
It over looks the swimming pool. 
It has a nice long bar 
They had 3 TV in the main dining area, two of which was playing Godfather II, Sweet. 
Music playing and disco lights on. 
A really nice place to have dinner. 

Here's the rundown:
The Best Meatball & Salad "Signature Martorano Meatball" I have to say, the meatballs are really good. It  was serve with ricotta which made it taste better. The salad it came with was just okay. 

Fried Calamari w/ Sweet & Spicy Chili Sauce   This dish was my favorite of the night. Nice size calamari. Perfectly fried. That sweet & spicy chili sauce was dynamite. So good. Thinly sliced Serrano chili rounded this dish nicely

Fried Mozzarella Stack "Tomatoes, Prosciutto di Parma, Aged Balsamic Vinegar & Extra Virgin Olive Oil" This was another winner. A thick piece fried nicely and tasted great with the prosciutto and balsamic vinegar. Yum!!

Rigatoni Pollo "Diced Chicken Cutlet, Hot & Sweet Peopers, San Marzano Tomatoes & Reggiano Parmesan Cheese" the rigorous was a bit too Al dente for me. The taste was good, just not pasta part for me. 

Chilean Seabass Scampi Style w/ White Wine, Garlic Butter, Peas & Cherry Tomatoes. The Seabass was just so buttery, melt in your mouth delicious. The white wine sauce complimented this dish 

Chicken Downtown "Chicken Cutlet, Ricotta Cheese, Spinach, Mushrooms, Vine Ripe Tomatoes & Fresh Mozzarella" a nice well rounded dish. Crunch from the chicken cutlet and a very flavorful sauce.

Red Velvet Cake. The cake was very moist with a cream cheese frosting. A nice way to finish our meal. 

The service was excellent. Sparkling mineral water was refilled constantly. Plates cleared efficiently. Dishes explained as they are served. 

What an Italian feast!!
Family Style!!

Each Saturday, there's a limited serving of Japanese noodles from ramen to udon to whatever. It's fresh and authentic. I have eaten ramen all over Japan, SoCal, NorCal and throughout the world. Trust me on this!

So this place is not a restaurant, by the way. It's actually a small grocery market that they set up some plastic chairs and tables in the corner of the store. You can actually buy bento boxes or other food items or drinks and sit down to enjoy it. It's a local Japanese grocery store!

Ok, but back to the ramen/udon. Each week, you can check on their facebook page for the noodle bowl of the week. You come in and order and there's really small staff in the back preparing your food. Everyone in there is Japanese and speaks Japanese. I actually sat with these two old Japanese ladies that came in for ramen and we talked about Japan and AZ when they first got here in the 1960s. That was awesome.

Like I said before, it gets pretty packed and they run out of noodles usually in an hour. Come early and eat the delicious food. You can walk over to the freezer and buy yourself a Japanese drink too. Afterwards, you can go next door to the Japanese bakery and get dessert.

There's really no other place like this in the Phoenix area so come try it out.

Now the last time I was at The Rooste, I was bedazzled in pink Hello Kitty cowboy hat taking home first prize. I think it was some kind of yelp sticker lol! And that's when I got the full flavor of this meaty, enormous yet charming country restaurant/bar/event facility/iconic Phoenix restaurant. We yelpers devoured the buffet and downed some free beer. This time, a little different...Let the sawdust fly!

Picture this. South Mountain. Covered in careening white mini vans and large American cars. Children. Everywhere. Like Children of the Corn. Octogenarians with walkers complete with two yellow tennis balls. Parents scrambling to keep their brood in order. Teenagers glued to their smart phones, completely unaware of the reason for this holiday. The stealing of land from the Native Americans. Yep. We Americans sure know when to party.

Picture this. Me. My mom and my dad. Two of the cutest things I've ever seen. Walking. Slowly. Navigating the "rustic" entrance to the restaurant. It's like they're trying to imitate Tim Conway. Me? Patient. Oh so patient. You see, I was psyched to have my folks all to myself. No cooking. No cleaning. But would the food be gross? Cafeteria-like? And the worst, cold?

No. No. And no.

From our warm biscuits and Indian flat bread to our entrees (we all chose turkey with all the fixins)...it was a fantastic meal for $20 a  head. Our server was efficient and delightful. If I remembered her name I would publicly apologize for my father's flirting. Heck. Maybe she liked it! She mentioned she was working from 9am to 9pm. God Bless her. Hope she's wearing sensible shoes. 

They were helpful with extras (can you say "More gravy please?") and with boxing up to go treats. We skipped dessert as I was serving pumpkin pie, chocolate coffee cake and coffee at my place.

The window booth we had (thanks dad for calling ahead) had those famous sweeping views of the valley, brown smog included. And of the large families swallowing the picnic tables outside below, chowing down and obviously having a good time. 

Other staff were energetic, friendly and helpful. 

I cannot imagine the pilgrims having a finer meal and a better time then me and my folks. 

Well, they did have those cute outfits. Not my folks. The pilgrims. Though mom was working her dangely Christmas tree earrings.

Oh. The. Holidays.

Before pop culture coined the term tween; but only by about a year or two, I had the privilege of playing ice hockey as a young teen. I had a few 'wordy' on ice debates over this or that during a peewee season. "I think you'll like they way I use 'Pow!', 'Bam!', and 'Zap!' in a sentence." I 'politely' explained to the defense-man, alas, I was cordially invited to take a 'break' from the sport I so loved. Time marches on, or so the song goes, and fifteen years later I still hadn't picked it back up.

Shazam! I got this wonder-brained idea about a year ago, I'm going to play ice hockey again! 

Fifteen years later, the call to get back on the ice was overwhelming, I felt like Uncle Sam himself was calling me to serve my country, do my duty, stand up and take action! I spent a few months debating weather I would do it or not and decided to take the plunge.

Being the frugal person I am, I chose to pay the entire season instead of game by game. You'll spend closer to $20 per league game, instead of $25 by paying it upfront. I picked up a few new pieces of necessary gear I didn't already own, a helmet, gloves, athletic protector (those boys are sensitive you know) ;-), and away I went. 

Suiting up that first time, brought back that feeling of sporting camaraderie you can't find anywhere, at least outside of a locker room. Taped the hockey stick, laced up the skates, pulled on the jersey, buttoned up the helmet, and away I went. The puck dropped for my first rotation on the ice, I skated my heart out, and holy cr*p! What the heck was I thinking! OMG, I think I'm about to die, right here, on the ice.

I looked up at the clock, and it was only about 67 seconds into the game, go figure. My next thought was "I knew I shouldn't have paid the 'entire' season. Now I have to come back :-/ "

Fast forward nine months, I'm still going back week after week. I can finally make it back to the car after a game without limping the entire way there, and no longer feel like I'm punishing myself for the future possibility of keeping up in Adult League Ice Hockey.

I've been told by a number of skaters that while Arcadia doesn't have the best facility, they've got one of the better patches of ice in the valley. Lucky for me, I live only a few miles from here, short commute!

Check them out for a free skate, drop in for an open hockey, or join me for C-League. There's always a beginner class happening on the weekend for anyone interested, they'll even loan you out some gear if you'd like to 'try before you buy' so to speak.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, see you on the ice!

The best damn popcorn I've ever had. Seriously! 
The 505 is caramel popcorn coated in white chocolate and dusted with green and red hatch chilies.

The 505 is sweet, spicy and oh so addicting. I went through my big bag in ten minutes. 

Located on the south side of Vegas, Popped is a gourmet popcorn shop that has a huge amount of some of the most creative, insanely delicious popcorn I've ever had. They have at least fifteen different flavors (including specials) that you can sample before you purchase. And sample I did. Just look at all I tried. I tasted popcorn with white chocolate and coconut. Popcorn with jalapenos. Popcorn with caramel and apples. Popcorn with sea salt and vinegar. I truly got popcorn wasted. In the end, my wife and I bought four bags. This is what we took home with us:

505- Caramel popcorn coated in white chocolate & dusted w/ green & red hatch chilies http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OGQ_6nIn4QQL2U6t0XeHtA?select=chiThLLPBz2aAGrBzM1o3A

Dill Pickle Popcorn- Tasted just like dill pickles. This one's for you, Chris D. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OGQ_6nIn4QQL2U6t0XeHtA?select=Xh4sd5IkeabqzZpo-Dsa2Q
S'mores Popcorn- Caramel corn with graham crackers, marshmallows and premium Swiss chocolate http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OGQ_6nIn4QQL2U6t0XeHtA?select=giCcRVvmtaZBV3F02KorGA

Honestly, I've never tried popcorn this amazing, and I've had lots of different popcorn in my time. I'm actually going to buy some from their website to be shipped to my home soon. It's that good. 

The prices at Popped are cheap. A small bag ranges from three bucks up to five. Large bags range from five to seven or so. 
The girl working the day I went was so friendly and willing to let us try all we wanted. So cool. 

If you can't make it to Vegas to try this place, I would hop on their site and buy a few bags. Seriously, do it. You won't regret it.

I thought I'd treat my man to Sensi because we're both represented on the menu. They've got a little bit of Italian, a little bit of Asian, and a little bit of American. Oh, and they've got seafood too, which we both love.

While everything on the menu sounded amazing, we decided to go for the pan roasted halibut and Sensi's braised beef short ribs. Presentation was beautiful, but I wasn't completely blown away. For $$$$, I was expecting to have the best foodgasm ever, but I didn't even have one. 

Service was top notch, and everything else about this place was exquisite. And what a gorgeous place! The open kitchen is the center of attention here. We were seated near the lobster tank, but thankfully, I didn't see or hear any lobsters being cooked. 

If I come back again, I'll give their prix-fixe menu a try. Seems that would be the best way to go here.

LOVE The Barrymore!! What a hidden gem and one of the best meals I have ever had in Vegas! I've been to many upscale restaurants opened by celebrity chefs, but this honestly blows many of them away. Located inside the Royal Resort behind Encore, you'd never expect to find such a fabulous restaurant here. The interior is Mad Men-esque with chic retro decor and a really swanky ambiance.

Food and cocktails were phenomenal and the service was unpretentious and top notch. Everyone was super friendly and we even had the pleasure of meeting their amazing chef de cuisine Francisco Campa.

The seared foie gras was to die for! My friend and I shared one order, but considered ordering another because it was just that delicious. We also enjoyed their decadent lobster mac n cheese, and the fish and duck specials of the night were amazing. Be sure to ask for recommendations and hear about their specials. For cocktails, I really loved the Virginia Hill (Pisco, Lillet Blanc, peach syrup, fresh lemon juice, egg whites, 
peach bitters, sage). You really can't go wrong with anything though.
Book a table here and thank me later!

If you're a fan of modern Japanese -- the kind that Nobu made popular and places like Social House reimagined -- you'll love the food at Soho. The chef owner is the former executive chef at Social House and has brought his fusion-style of cooking to the 'burbs. That means Strip-quality food at off-Strip prices.

The strip mall location is nothing special and the interior is quaint and understated. But, it's the food that shines at this restaurant. You can't go wrong with the yellowtail yuzu soy ($10), tuna or hamachi tostadas ($2 ea.), or the angus gyoza ($5). The miso marinated black cod ($18) is as good as any I've had on or around the Strip (including the one at Nobu).

The variety of rolls may be limited, but the quality and execution is solid. This is not an all you can eat place, so expect to spend a little more for a higher end product.

The subtle sweetness and silky creaminess of the vanilla creme brulee ($5) was a great way to end the meal. If chocolate is your thing, try the chocolate mousse ($7). It's the perfect balance of sweet and bitter chocolate with cocoa crumbles and cookie pieces to add variety in texture.

The chef/owner stopped by to chat, which is always a nice touch to show that he cares about the diner's experience. With beautifully presented and well crafted food, Soho is a welcome addition to the local scene. For people on a budget, like myself, it's just another reason to dine in the 'burbs instead of the Strip.

It's hard to believe the 5-diamond, all-suite Venetian Hotel rose from the dust of the Sands way back in 1999. The opulent Casino, famous Grand Canal Shoppes, 24-hour Race & Sports Book, and large Suite Hotel Rooms (with sunken living room and Italian-marble baths) are just a few reasons the Venetian still reigns as a spectacular destination for an unforgettable Las Vegas vacation.

Of course, the Venetian is inspired by Venice, Italy (sorry, California). Several detailed replicas of landmarks from Europe's most beautiful city include Piazza San Marco (St. Mark's Square) with Campanile di San Marco (St. Mark's Campanile Bell Tower) and columns for the Lion of Venice and Saint Theodore. Other notable reproductions are Palazzo Ducale (Doge's Palace), Ponte di Rialto (Rialto Bridge), and Ponte dei Sospiri (Bridge of Sighs).

 * Rates get high for larger Renaissance & Penthouse Suites
 * An In-Suite Breakfast offer is available, but not my style
 * The Venezia Tower is newer, but may not be for everyone
 * Book online & check discount packages for the best deals
 * Daily resort fee: $25 + tax ($3): Fitness Center, Internet, & 1 coffee

 * Semi-romantic types can ride a gondola indoors and out

Shopping
 * Grand Canal Shoppes has shops along an indoor canal
 * The stores are open 10am - 11pm (midnight on Fri/Sat)
 * More than 160 stores with mall favorites, boutiques, & high-end
 * Louboutin, Burberry, Ferragamo, & Fendi are highlights

The Venetian Resort Hotel and Casino is a truly remarkable Vegas Strip hotel offering upscale value and amenities for reasonable prices. It should be one of the first places you check for reservations before any trip to Las Vegas.

Over the last few days, I've eaten here four times.

First, I took my daughter for a late dinner on Tuesday night; then I sprung a friend over at Westminster Retirement for his first Chicago Italian Beef yesterday; then my son on his last night in Scottsdale wanted some comfort food before journeying to California for his new job; and lastly, today we had a UYE with Phoenix Buffet King Rand H, Robyn N, Mike C and his fiancee Jackie R.

Over the last few days I've gotten to know Mike Portillo pretty well.  He's a great guy who is in charge of Training at his family's restaurants and is here working the kitchen with the rest of his employees. Given the crazy opening three months ago, he's done an incredible job! A textbook management case study if you ask me!

The food is still great!  And now, that some our out of town guests have returned to points north, it's easier to get in and out of here. The place today was packed, but with three/four cashiers working, the wait-time was less than ten minutes to get your food. Nice!

Sooooo, if you feel like an Italian Beef, Combo with sausage, or a Chicago "Red Hot" stop on by.

Now a shout-out to Nancy P, who is next door at Scottsdale Health waiting to deliver her son and tells me: "Think my hubby will be spending a lot of time in line here while I'm recovering after our son is born!"  You hear that Mike!

After our first decadent evening in Vegas, the first thing on our minds was getting hydrated and nourished ASAP. Our party of four was staying at Paris so it was a no brainer that we'd pay the much praised Mon Ami Gabi a visit for a quick brekkie.

At 9:30am there was hardly any wait and we all were seated in the glass atrium overlooking the busy strip and Bellagio fountains. With coffee and o2 in hand, we were off to a great start!

Our server was congenial, efficient and helpful with the menu, as well.  

We went with the famous Croque Madame, traditional eggs and sausage with crispy hash browns, large mixed berry crepe, and corned beef hash & poached eggs, respectively.  

There was a bit of a wait but nothing too bad and the food was definitely worth the wait! Everything was fresh, nicely plated and the portions were very generous.

Our coffees were always topped off and waters constantly filled without asking, which was nice. 

Overall, a fantastic breakfast stop at Mon Ami Gabi. The food was solid, service was on point and the price was very reasonable for the location. 

Next stop, sippin on margaritas in our  poolside cabana :)

Happy Eats!

I remember when we went here for the first time
Saying "This is it! I'm gonna eat some chocolate so prime!"
This place is in the left wing of Caesar's Forum Shops
On our four-day trip this was one of our scheduled stops
Greeted on a semi-crowded Tuesday night, nicely
Seated to the souvenir shop's left and kitchen's right, precisely
We looked at the menu and were astounded by the selection
We needed someone to point us in the right direction

And ooooooooooh...I didn't listen to the waitress' recommendation (about maybe not getting the sampler)
And ooooooooooh...I better listen next time, I'm telling you
If we ever ever ever go back to Vegas we should remember
That we will get together together together with Max Brenner
We'll order the O.M.G. cookie
Order the milkshakes
Order food savory
So we may get together together together again with Max Brenner

"But shouldn't every chocolate dessert be 5-star here?", I think
And shouldn't all the flavors in their sampler be clear, and in sync
And while the milk and white chocolate bark "branches" were exciting
And the chocolate sauce and chocolate wafer balls made the ice cream inviting
The banana tempura had a strange batter and aftertaste
And the chocolate sponge cake had no chocolate flavor, what a waste
And while the waffle with fruit made me somewhat happy
The next morning I had a much better waffle with fruit at Mon Ami Gabi

And while the fondue was nice, it didn't fill my chocolate wish
They had to start the marshmallow grill flame twice because once it did extinguish
But however ever ever disappointed I was by this endeavor
I don't know if we'll sever sever sever our ties to Max Brenner
While we liked the bark branch
Liked the fondue
Liked the ice cream
We may never ever ever go back to Max Brenner 

And while the waitress was bubbly and endearing and sweet
The management had her working too many tables; she looked flustered and beat

While the concept is a clever clever clever cocoa endeavor
Should we ever ever ever go back to Max Brenner?
(Yelpers, please let me know if I should ever ever ever go back to Max Brenner!)

I came here because a group of us were downtown.  When I entered I thought that it was a stupid gimik but I went a long with it because I was hungry and in a hurry. 

We ordered our food and when it arrived it wasn't the greatest.  It didn't taste that great and the atmosphere was cheesy.  

While we were eating we heard a couple come in and ask to be seated.  The nurse at the front told them that they would have to put on a hospital gown.  The girl in the couple looked at the gowns and noticed that they weren't clean.  Thats when I looked mine over and noticed that she was right.  She immediately said that because she has been diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder; she shouldn't be forced to wear that.  I know someone who lives with that disorder so I know that they have high anxiety when it comes to cleanliness.  The nurse argued with her until the girl asked to talk to a manager.  The nurse yelled across the restaurant to an old guy in a Dr outfit who claimed he owned the place.  

He arrogantly asked "what's the problem," in the same tone the nurse was having with the two patrons.  The girl stated that she didn't want to wear the medical gown because she didn't trust how clean it was and the manager said, "leave then!"  

The girl responded, "you would rather us eat somewhere else instead of voting with our dollars here?"

The so called manager started to get in both of the couples faces in an aggressive manner.  The male part of the couple was just standing there and didn't say a word until the manager started to make the couple feel apprehensive. The old manager then threatened the guy after the couple had exited the front door.  Thats when the guy started to stand his ground and call the manager out as a coward.  The guy told the manager to come at him if he wanted to threaten him otherwise he should go back inside and eat a %@)#.  "You obviously like a lot of meat in your mouth."  I started rolling after that and expected the manager to do something.  

I thought the situation absurd because the so called 'owner' threatened a couple who wanted to pay to eat at his horrible restaurant.  Then when the manager was bowed up to, he had to cowar back and close the door.  

I wont be coming back to this place after the way I saw patrons were treated and after I saw that the restaurant won't make exceptions for someone who has been diagnosed with a disability.   The "owner" made the situation worse and made himself look like a coward.

I have been a fan of Dan's food since the last place he was at.  When word came out that he was going to open a new place, I immediately started daydreaming on how long it would take to open.  I'll be the first to admit that I was very let down by the time it took to open Mucho Macho Taco(MMT).  Well guess what...you can't rush perfection!  First things first, this is not an authentic Mexican restaurant.  MMT is a Mexican fusion restaurant.  The combination of traditional Mexican dishes with a clever injection of culinary magic makes you feel as if you had discovered an extra sense you never knew you had!

Horchata...best I have tasted in Phoenix hands down!  Dan found a way to take his original recipe and kick it up a few notches(the dates that top this drink is a great touch).  I challenge my fellow Yelpers to point out a better tasting horchata in the Phoenix area.

Skirt Steak Taco...basically a carne asada taco that is so tender and has mastered this taco staple. 

50/50 Taco...it is a Skirt Steak Taco mixed with a locally sourced Chorizo that is greaseless and savory.  

Crispy Fish Taco...a Baja California favorite that Dan already had down pat!  I am not able to pinpoint what Dan and crew did differently here but they knocked this fish taco out the park.

Roasted Turkey Mole Taco...I had a mouth orgasm with this one!  They dominated a perfect smoke flavor along with celery and mole sauce.  I recommend that everyone taste this taco!

Braised Brisket Taco...this brisket is tender, moist and flavorful.  The union of the brisket, orange segments and cilantro truly packs a wallop to your taste buds.  

Bacon Taco...who will argue that anything with bacon taste bad?  A non-Merican that's who!  This locally sourced bacon tastes heavenly.  

Sopapillas...a appetizing dessert you find at most Mexican joints.  MMT has topped theirs off with an authentic cajeta, Mexican chocolate and pecans.  I don't eat flour but had to have a couple pieces of these sopapillas, well worth the stomach cramps!

I truly wish Dan and crew much success!  The first weekend that Mucho Macho Taco was open, it already appears that they have a contender for a title fight!

Had a family wedding to attend this past weekend and most everyone was booked into "The New Tropicana."  I would never opt to stay at this end of the strip as it is a long schlep to the bumpin part. The monorail doesn't even come this far so you have to walk over to the MGM to catch it.

Well I was more than pleasantly surprised by the remod. Looks great, even smells great. My room was spacious and looked out on the strip as I was in the Paradise Tower, which BTW is closest to the casino and front door. No fridge, but I hear you can rent one for $10 per night. 

What was most impressive was the friendly staff. Everyone from the two check-in ladies, to the convenience store and house cleaning staff were all smiles. They really did a great job on their hires. The pool area has also undergone a remod and while it ain't the Wynn pool, it is very nice with plenty of shade for pale faces like me. 

The lounge is conveniently located by the Paradise Tower elevators, and the band jamming there on Friday - Sunday was a funky good time. We spent around an hour there all three nights before going out for the evening. 

Would I stay here again? Would not be my first choice because of the location, but if family or friends were already booked I would gladly join in again.

I've always wanted to try Bobby Flay's famous restaurant Mesa Grill but never had the chance till now. After the watching the Celine Dion Concert, we were both starving and my Mom wanted to eat something right away close to the Coliseum and I told her about Mesa Grill which was owned by Celeb Chef Bobby Flay. They say, sometimes he'll be working behind the grill but unfortunately he wasn't there. 

='(

But that didn't stop me from enjoying my dinner with Mum, the place is hip and modern just like the rest of Caesars Palace's restaurants and they don't have a strict dress code, just casual to formal. Staff here are top notch in service and the food here is on the $$$ side but I knew that before walking in and ordering our food since there was a big menu with prices outside of the restaurant.

We ordered:

22 oz Bone in Chipotle Glazed Rib-Eye $48
  -side of Mashed Potatoes + Green Chile Queso Sauce $9

Ancho Chile Honey Glazed Salmon
 - Spicy Black Sauce + Roasted Jalapeno Crema  - $32

Both of the entrees were excellent and couldn't fault on anything, bone in Chipotle Glazed Rib-Eye was very tender and juicy and included two different sauces hot and mild but I forgot the names. And a side of mashed potatoes, was nothing phenomenal. My mom ordered the Ancho Chile Honey Glazed Salmon and that was a great dish. 

Service here great, not excellent. Our waiter never explained the different sauces I had for my Chipotle Rib-Eye and that took it down one star. Other than that, dinner was lovely and I was glad to finally eat in Bobby Flay's Famous Mesa Grill restaurant at Caesar's Palace.

Unfortunately I didn't see Bobby Flay grilling his signature steaks in his kitchen. 

Boo!

I'll start by yelling, MORE PASTA PLEASE!... and that's a good thing because the dish I had was insanely delicious. I ordered the Chitarra alla Carbonara with Guanciale. Man-o- man was it good. Thanks to Kevin H for my new found addiction; Guanciale! You Rule!  Now back to the review...
If I were rating my entire experience on the pasta alone, you would see 5 stars. However, in order to get there I feel a few tweaks are needed to land on perfection. First, the local greens salad I had was way overly salted and a bit meager in my opinion. A little less on the salt and throw in a few shavings of Parmigiano and you got a winner. Second, I feel the pricing structure is little steep for the lunch crowd and may be the reason why my co-worker and I were the only ones in the place during the 11am lunch hour on a Tuesday. Consider a price adjustment to attract the lunch crowd and you're sure to draw them in.  My bill with tip was $24.66 for the salad, tea, and pasta. Lastly, and I second Alexander's plea. Where's the freaking bread!  I could not believe I had to give up my bowl with a pool of deliciousness still left at the bottom. The drippings alone could feed a family of three. It was criminal.
 I mentioned my disappointment to our server who kindly said there were no plans to serve bread with pasta dishes, the cracker sticks is all they were serving. Ditch the cracker sticks man and get with the program. I begged with him to make it happen and was a bit dramatic while conveying this request.  He must have got the message because 10 min later he came back to our table saying that the kitchen staff was working on a plan to serve bread with the pasta dishes. I promised a return visit to validate the change and I look forward to reporting back.  Wishin' and Hopin' and Thinkin' and Prayin' la,la, la, la~

I am very sorry to report I must give a negative review to this gym. I had SUCH high hopes for it. Nice, location, clean, good equipment, etc. I was a walking billboard for this place.

But I can no longer support that position. It has become a nightmare over there.

It is run by people who seem like they are pretending to run a business and seem to know nothing about it. In the first 6 months I was there, they charged my credit card for a 6 session training package I never bought. It took almost two months of screaming up the corporate ladder for them to reverse that charge (but they did!). After that, I had questions about the massage program. Steve Lubarsky gave me many many different answers about the prices and when I pushed him to either give me a consistent price or let me speak to someone at Meridien (their management company), he refused. I found out later from Kevin Kavanaugh, that they never had a license to perform massages and Steve was basically stalling until he could figure out what to do to cover his ass. He then proceeded to halt the program immediately, which certainly speaks for itself. 

Since then, I have tried very earnestly to straighten things out with corporate and at the very least get an apology for Steve ignoring my requests while he covered his ass, but they refuse to do so. So, I would say, do NOT go to this gym. They are a corporate mess. They just fired one GM and they have hired a new one, but I heard he was ready to quit. It's a mess. 

Additionally, every person I have brought in who joined as a member has since quit because of the non-stop pressure from David Riviera to buy training packages. If you decide to ignore my advice and join, be prepared for daily texts and phone calls urging you to buy overpriced training packages. 

And everybody there pays a different price. I pay $99 a month. They charge friends of mine $130. Others pay $150. It all depends who you talk to and how desperate they are to make their membership quotas.

Okay, have I made myself clear. I can't stress enough - STAY AWAY!!!!

What a monumental shithole Treasures.

Cover charge at 4:30 in the afternoon was $33.00. Almost immediately upon entering you're besieged with hustling bitches trying to shake you down for table dances at twenty bucks a pop. Should you decline, they'll step up their marketing skills by offering you a package of five dances for only one-hundred dollars. 
God, they're clever. I think that works out to, oh wait, twenty dollars a dance.
As I said, clever.

When servers ask for your drink order, they'll immediately ask how you're going to pay for it, suggesting perhaps you may be homeless and without funds for such a wondrous event. 
The look on your face suggests you're experiencing a wtf moment. 

          " Cash or credit card?" she annoyingly barks while you're still in disbelief.

Shaken down at the door, now insulted, as if you were going to swill down a beer and beeline it for an awaiting cab without paying, you begin to reassess if any of this was worth it.

Whether your response is cash or credit, they'll demand payment up front prior to taking the order. I believe this is because, and this is only conjecture mind you, their default statement is to not trust anyone who graces their shit hole establishment for fear they're part shit hole too. It's a projection thing I guess.

Don't get suckered into a VIP dance in the back room by one of the many fleeting nubiles promenading about.. They're there for one reason. To take you to the 'back room'.
If you do get suckered into a back room dance, the fee starts at $100 with a $32 two-drink minimum, again, all paid up front of course. And god help you if you happen to get caught up in the moment, losing count of your five song 'deal'. The sixth song just shot the price up to $250 along with a now $50 two-drink minimum. 
It's like being penalized for getting caught up in the music and whirling tits!

You're now knee-deep in the shit, having unwittingly purchased the multi-dance package and guess what? This time, the dancer doesn't shake you down for loot, she waltzes you over to some guy bigger than all outdoors, whose tone of voice is lower than a 30" subwoofer and whose countenance is that of a guard at Buckingham Palace.

   "Two hundred fifty bucks pal, how you gonna pay?" 

I panic.
The eighth song just began playing and I don't know what the rules are. The seventh shot the price from twenty to thirty-five. After everything I've seen thus far, I'm thinking they're going to ask me to pony up a nut when song number eight begins playing.
I cut my losses and head for the door.

When you've had enough of their bullshit and want to take a cab back to the hotel, guess what, no cabs. 
Oh there are cabs, a cab line and a valet, but you're not going anywhere...not just yet. 
That's because you'll need to grease the valet, this or else wait in a terminally long line of losers who didn't have money to line the valet's pockets.

Here's what I did.
I saw an off-duty cab about 100 yards from their driveway entrance and started toward it.

   "HE'S OFF DUTY!" the valet shouts. 

    "FUCK YOU," I respond politely. 

I offered the taxi driver a fifty to take me anywhere as fast as he could. This so I could begin erasing the entire shitty experience out of my memory. 
He declines, saying he'll get in trouble with va-ray. (Asian)
I make it a Franklin.

  " Hop in" he says.

Everything about Treasures smells to high heaven, including the plethora of Russian whores in cheap perfume and glitter. You'll know who they are immediately.
They speak with the same dialect as that ugly bitch from Rocky & Bullwinkle.

I would only come back here if I won the lottery.

There are a lot of great parks and trails in Summerlin that I love going to, but I hadn't been to Cottonwood Canyon Park before. Our neighbor told us it was a great place to take dogs because they have nice grassy areas and there are usually other dogs for the fur babies to socialize with. With that info we loaded up a "Brownie" (our fur baby), a bag of essentials, a picnic lunch...... and we were off! 

We first met a hearty set of stairs on our journey. Going down them them was a breeze, but I wondered how coming back up would be! I will have to find out some other time because I took a different way back. There are ramps on either side of the stairs which makes easy access for wheelchairs. At the bottom of the stairs/ramp the path lead us on a beautiful journey. The trail is well kept and the variety of cacti, wild flowers and trees I saw along the way was nice. It wasn't soon before we came upon a grassy area that had a covered patio area with tables and BBQ grills. I thought the picnic area was spacious and well kept. As we went along the trail we went through a tunnel/overpass which lead us to the next grassy area. I loved the amount of space and how peaceful it was so this would be where our picnic lunch would take place. After laying out a blanket, getting Brownie set up with her water bowl and snacks it was time to relax and enjoy lunch. The park didn't seem too crowded, but there were people passing by on the trail by bike, jogging and walking their dog. A couple dogs did stop along the way to say hello to Brownie and do the usual butt sniffing thing dogs do. After a tasty lunch we decided to head back. 

There is a bridge near the beginning of the trail, it goes over the old wash. Well, not too far from this bridge is a dirt path. I saw no sign saying that we couldn't go up it so... up we went! I'm not sure what the top of this dirt path is used for, but please beware that currently there is A LOT of broken glass in that area. If you have dogs with you it will NOT be safe for them to walk here. Brownie had to have her daddy carry her to the car. The car wasn't far, since at the top of this dirt path and to the left is the parking lot, but the glass still is an issue since there is nothing marked saying you can't take that route. 

They have trash bins so please be respectful and keep your dog(s) on leash and clean up after them! Always be prepared and bring your own potty bags from home just in case!

I went here on a Friday after work for some dinner. The parking can be a challenge so have some patience. 

I have had this place bookmarked for several years but I have never really found myself in the area to take advantage of this place. I was trying to decide on a couple of Korean dishes. There was one that was cooked in a skillet with rice and the dish that I finally chose was the Spicy Korean dish with beef and noodles. I'm really not a more spicy the better aficionado. I don't mine a little heat as long as it compliments the meal. I thought the spiciness to this dish was just right. They give you a huge portion and our waiter was always there to refill my water glass because my mouth was en fuego at times.

The cost was under $12 and a good deal for the amount of food received. The service was excellent and my wife really enjoyed this place as well. I will be back!

Wrap me up and take me home ZiKiZ. Your food is BoMb. (I don't know why their name has a capital K in the middle. I almoSt wAnT to wriTe the WhOle rEviEw this way, but I'm too full now.)

Back to the wraps. Your choice of Steak, Chicken or Crab mix or Falafel and 4 types of tortillas you can wrap it in. Or if you aren't a wrapper you could make it into a salad or a bowl. This is your meal so make your food dreams come true. 

Add: spinach, rice (white or brown), lettuce mix, olives, tomatoes, red onion, jalapeno, pickles, cucumbers, chick peas, green peppers, banana peppers, avocado, feta or mozzarella ($.99 extra for cheese), crumbled ZiKiZ chips. 

Dressing: I want to try them all! A house dressing that's good, Chipotle Ranch, Asian BBQ, Citrus, Hot Sauce, Mango Curry, Caesar, Vinaigrette. I only wish they had a Tzatziki sauce.

Wraps $7.99
Salads $8.49
Bowls $8.49 (they even have Tabouli!)

This is one of those meals that you can make healthy or kill it with the carbs depending your mood that day. I like that. Did I mention they have a cheesecake wrap? Tubby didn't try that, but it sure sounded good especially since you can choose chocolate, lemon or strawberries as your topping. Might as well rip the drawstring out of your pants to make some more room. 

I ordered online and like the fact they have the nutritional guidelines on there. Not that I even want to know about the cheesecake wrap.... Wait, strawberries are an exceptional source of antioxidants:) 

If you haven't got the memo yet ZiKiZ is doing it big up in here. Fresh, simple and have it your way. If you like to be your own boss of what you eat than check it out.

Hate to say it, but Free Vegas Club Passes didn't exactly deliver as I had hoped during my girls weekend in Vegas. Now, we did plan our trip during one of the busiest weekends of the year, Labor Day weekend. That said, I booked my schedule more than a month in advance on Chris' website. Since you are required to party at the Palms on the first night, I signed us up for Rain and Moon for Friday. I also selected Tryst for Saturday and XS for Sunday. I knew that these clubs were among the most popular but they were listed as options at the time and I received a confirmation shortly after submitting my request. 

The confirmation did state that the info might change but I didn't hear anything in the following days that would indicate that it had. One week before the trip, I received emails that said the lists for Tryst and XS had been canceled, and we were now on a list for Cathouse at the Luxor for both of those nights. I appreciated the back-up plan, but we already had our hearts set on the other clubs, not to mention dinner reservations at the Wynn for Saturday night since we thought it was where we were going to party later in the evening.

Since there was no way in hell I was going to let my girls down, I quickly contacted another friend who was going on the trip to explain the situation. She worked her own contacts and got us on VIP lists for Tryst and XS on the same nights we originally wanted. 

We did stick with our Friday night plans regardless and went to Rain since DJ Pauly D was spinning. It was a GREAT time.

So will I use the service again or recommend it to friends? Perhaps. Probably. On non-holiday weekends, it's probably a great service. But I'd definitely be wary that things may not work out, so I'd probably come up with my own back-up plan just in case.

I had a horrible experience at the Marquee Day Club with its small pool and their fantastic ability to stuff people in like sardines.

There's nothing better than to come to a spacious pool, good looking people, and best of all: you don't even have to try to look good. 
Just grab a drink and relax in the pool, pot belly goes under water folks ;), and waddle in the water to good music. 

If you come with a bad ratio of guys and girls (bad, meaning that having men in your group diminish your chances of getting in for free), I would recommend contacting a promoter about your ratio and then come very early, before noon, to avoid the $50-$60 cover charge for men. But generally, girls get in for $30 if you can't get in for the promotion price.

Oh, and if you're worried about fitting your lunch plans prior to pool time, they have a grill there that serves food.

Drinks are fairly expensive, as they regularly are in Las Vegas clubs.

The only thing to complain: I know the pools are heated, but the water is slightly too warm for the amount of people, which makes me think that the water is warm for other reasons :(

But I definitely would do this again on my next trip(s),

Asian fusion tapas is how I would best describe Jayde Fuzion and Seonkyoung, the new Food Network star surely delivered with her culinary vision and concepts!

My advice is to go in a group of 4 and order a bunch of dishes and share.   We loved the Crab Salad - I believe this was one of the dishes featured in the early episode of Restaurant Express.  The salad was so fresh, light and refreshing.  The crab salad is paired with these lettuce endives and sesame wonton chips to scoop the crab goodness up.  This was one of our favorites.

You can't go wrong with the lettuce wraps stuffed with pork belly....YES....pork belly.  Next time I will get the Duck sliders and Korean street tacos as we saw many tables having these dishes.  

There are many traditional Korean dishes such as Japchae and Kalbi and for less adventurous eaters you can order a cashew chicken.  There's an even a full blown sushi bar.  

There's definitely something for everyone.   The best part is most entrees are in the $8 to $15 range so you can order several and share.  Be sure to save room for desserts.  We really enjoyed the Yuzu Donuts - I could eat a dozen of those.  Hopefully chef will bring her famous sticky Asian bbq Ribs.  If you're in the area, be sure to check out this new Asian gem at the M Resort.

I was indeed intrigued by the idea of Posh Improvisational Cuisine... and although I'd been wanting to try it for awhile, I waited for a special occasion to do so.  I finally made it to Posh last week for Jared's birthday!  (And yes, I selfishly chose the restaurant since I wanted to try it!)

It was me, Jared, our friend Larry G who was visiting from Jersey, and my brother met us a bit later... we took both Joel L's recommendation and that of "Josh from Posh," who called back to confirm our reservation, and we sat at the bar.  

The experience was more than just a meal... it was foodie heaven, entertainment, and like nothing we'd ever experienced before!  We were there for several hours and the time flew by... in that time, we laughed a lot, got to know the extremely attentive staff, ate our fair share of 7+ courses each, and drank some of us drank a glass of wine to go with each course...

I started taking notes of the courses as they came out, but Jonathan, one of our servers, insisted that they could email me a description of what I ate after the fact instead, so I took him up on it!  Here it is:

Amuse Bouche:  cucumber caviar with pickled grape, (everyone had this)

1st:  Belgian endive, blood orange vinaigrette, goat cheese and candied pine nuts

2nd:  Shrimp chorizo, kimchee broth, baby bok choy and shaved fennel

3rd:  Atlantic fluke, sesame oyster aioli, roated fingerling potatoes and mustard greens

4th:  Foie gras torchon brulee, fig consomme, spun sugar and duck cracklings

5th:  Sonoma duck breast, soy ponzu gelee, oyster mushrooms and carrot coulis

6th: Roasted venison loin, ginger cucumber salsa, pommes anna and carmelized shallots

7th:  trio of cheeses, Tomme de savoie, robiola, humbotl fog(everyone had this) 

Yes, I ate all of the above in one sitting and then some!  I also tasted several of the other courses that my dining companions had including Jared's 2nd course of Black Cod and his 5th course of Braised short rib... not to mention the various desserts we all shared (Buttermilk panne cotta with fresh fruit, Trio of homemade candy bars, and Honey and Mascarpone tart with ancho chocolate ganache).  They even provided us with little goodie bags of sweet treats for the road.

Everything was expertly prepared.  I didn't take a bite of anything I didn't like... even the foie gras was surprisingly tasty although I only took a small bite.  Don't hate me for that, please!

We were all beyond impressed with our experience at Posh and although it was a splurge, it was totally worth it for a special occasion.  We'll be back!

See what happens when you wait too long to write your review!? Phoenix Magazine beats you to the punch and lists one of your favorite finds as one of the Valley's best dishes! 

Oh well, I guess I should just feel "validated."

Here's my take on this place:
For $12.50 you get a platter full of diced shrimp ceviche bordered by at least a dozen grilled regular sized shrimp and no less that a whole avocado's worth of wedges. It's served with crisp, flat, tostada chips and is plenty to share! A real value!!

If I'm dining alone, I generally get a couple of pupusas. Pupusas are like thick corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, beans or meat - your pick! They even offer a version stuffed with the loroco flower, which I understand is similar to a squash blossom. Myself? I'm a bean and cheese girl most of the time. And, I prefer them straight up: skip the tomato sauce and slaw topping. 

The chicken soup is flavorful and the portion size is significant, served with a couple of handmade tortillas.

Salvadoreno recently got a beer and wine license, and, a I can't think of a better beverage to wash down a pupusa than an ice cold beer!

Oh! I guess this can be my "scoop" - Salvadoreno is going to start offering a $7.95 lunch buffet from 11 - 3. Buffet items will vary depending on the day of the week.  I'm feelin' a pupusa eating contest as a lunchtime UYE!

Truly a tour de force of Spanish Cuisine.

Four visits, the most recent in the fall of 2014, e continues it's reign atop Vegas' culinary scene.

Seated in the bar of Jose Andres, glasses of Cava in hand, getting to know your fellow diners.  The hostess for the evening (and the sommelier) discretely interrupt each party to discuss water preferences and drink pairings.  As is Spanish tradition, always a little beyond the appointed hour, you're whisked away past the roaring fire and pans of cooking paella and into a secluded private, whimsical dining room.  Seated at a semicircular stainless steel counter, surrounded by hard woods and trinkets; representing the mind of the chef.   A hard knock on the solid kitchen door, the music of Spain fills the room, the chefs and servers enter and take their positions.  The experience begins.

E is about molecular gastronomy and modernist cuisine.  Perhaps a solid, foam sangria that magically dissipates on the tongue leaving the distinct flavor of wine and fruits, a thimble of soup with the pure essence of Spanish Jamon, liquefied olives that burst with the salty, briny taste of the real thing.  Artistry, flavor and pride are showcased in each dish as the head chef works in front of guest and describes each dish.  

Tip:  Wine pairings are essential.  They tie courses together and greatly enhance the experience.  Standard pairing $130, select pairing $300.  Opt for the select.  Incredibly well though out, running the gamut from sherry to 20 year cellared brooding reds, impossible to find whites and dessert wines.

20 courses grouped in three "flights".  Flavors of each small "starter" build on one another, as flavors of each and their accompanying wine pairing flow and compliment.  The progression makes the diner appreciate temperature and texture.  "Mains" provide contrast.  Flavors held together by the wine pairings that span more than one dish.  Finally desserts, with the boldest contrast between each to keep the palate yearning for more.

As always, with meals of so many selections, not everything will be to your taste.  All good, the next bite awaits.

Service is beyond reproach.  Unpretentious, friendly, very informative, perfect.

The experience for three diners with select wine pairing, incidental drinks, water, service and gratuity, $2,100.

Michelin three star worthy and a must in Vegas.

Notes:

1.  Reservations by emailing reserve@ebyjoseandres.com  beginning 90 day in advance.  No reservations or replies on Monday and Tuesday.  No phone in reservations accepted.  
2.  Credit card required to warranty reservation.
3.  Base price; $195 plus 20% service.

I love Public House this was my second time here. The restaurant is located in the Venetian hotel. Let's keep this simple. 
Food we ordered all appetizer.
Poutine with duck confit and Stout gravy was delish,but it wasn't the best. Make sure to add  a fried egg to it. 
Lamb Meatballs was awesome. The tomato sugo,and the herb bread crumbs was on point. The lamb meatballs was cook perfectly. Highly recommend.
Steak Tartare. This for me was my favorite dish. The tenderloin was super tender. The capers beer mustard dressing was wonderful. What made the dish even more was the perfectly poached egg. That made the dish rich and creamy. Get this dish with the poached egg extra ($2.50).
Southern Fried Quail was fantastic. The quail fried perfectly crispy layer and very moist in the inside. Had a lot of great flavor going on.
And lastly The Foie Gras Torchon. This one I was a little disappointment with. So past on it. 
As for the drinks Huge selection of wonderful craft beers. 
The service was great and helpful. You'll see me around public house again.

Big yummy breakfast food. AKA comfort food overload deluxe.

My x-brother-in-law told me about The Hash House A Go Go several years ago while we were fishing in Mexico. He said "dude you are gonna love this place, we're going when we hit the docks tomorow, the breakfast there is off the hook."  But it wasn't in the cards as we got thick in the fish and opted for some fresh bluefin sashimi instead.

So fast forward several years, that Hash House place is still ingrained in the back of my mind and what do ya know, while taking a breather from the Venetian's casino I go for a walkabout and stumble on a sign that tells me there is a HHAGG in the Imperial Palace Hotel. So I go thru this construction maze of an entry to the IPH and into the hottest (like 90 degrees) casino on the planet. I go pass the performing blues brothers  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9wjTzw8bEYOTQJk41V8WQw?select=TZSIV-_ypvbTuH7mh_f8cg#TZSIV-_ypvbTuH7mh_f8cg blackjack dealers and up an escalater to find that they are closed! Damn, so I make plans for the next days breakfast.

Wake up at zero dark thirty (6:30) so I can have B-fast before going to the Fabtech trade show. I get there NO LINE! Yes the casino gods are favoring me today. I asked to be seated at the bar for quicker service. This was the first time I ever ordered a glass of milk at a bar, it felt wierd. I then ordered up a Andy's Sage Fried Chicken.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=W3BT2l3t-ifYfCtQ_Q2vbQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

FOOD: Andys Sage Fried Chicken ... This was a giant breakfast, the chicken and eggs atop a couple of biskets piled onto a heap of country style mashed potatoes loaded with bacon bits all covered up with a benedictish gravy with diced bell peppers. This was some good stuff a solid 4 **** Star for me. But less bisket and more of that yummy gravy and it would have been 5 Stars.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VDLsrE-gNdkh8N82jlEo5A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

SERVICE: From the hostess taking my picture http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Eo1U2kj6OyU_a_Kr9pC-6A&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw and quickly seating me, to the bar (milk) tender who was way cool and friendly, the service was great, fast and polite. 5*****Stars

I'll be back.

Another afternoon in the Summerlin area, we decided to trek over to the Suncoast Casino for some grub.  I'm so happy we encountered this place that serves happy hour deals all day everyday!   Appetizers are half price in their large bar area.  The Tuscan Spinach Dip was served with fresh (warm) tortilla chips.  Their $1.50 bucket of fries weren't really served in a bucket, but were way worth it.  A high point of our dining experience was the sliders, each for $1.50 on the happy hour menu.  With a nice charbroiled taste and caramelized onions, we ended up ordering more.  A low point was my incomplete house salad.  This order usually comes with croutons, cucumber slices, and a garlic breadstick.  I pretty much had a small plate of just lettuce.  They did bring me a garlic breadstick later though.

Speaking of bringing it...all the waiters work as a team, tending to all patrons.  I must've dealt with six different waiters after we were seated.  Service was with a smile and diligence!  The drinks weren't bad either during happy hour.  I tried their Electric Lemonade which was like kool-aid with a little kick.  Their $5 Margarita, with 1800 Silver Tequila, was flawless.  

The next time I visit, I will partake in their Endless Soup, Salad and Bread Lunch Deal.  From 10am to 4pm, $4.99 will get you all you can eat soup, salad, and bread.  What a freakin deal.  Hell...I might just have to get a slider or two while I'm at it.

Pros: 
- Easy to make money if you lack a college education.
- A tourist economy that permits upward mobility among lower classes via tips. Also, it has become standard decorum in Vegas to tip in industries in that are not perceived as tip-worthy elsewhere (e.g., nail salons, car washes).
- Kitschy architecture and art that is unique to Vegas. 
- Affordable houses and townhouses. 
- Less racial tension than other larger cities.
- FREE PARKING EVERYWHERE!!! Parking lots are abundant, rarely do you ever have to park on the street, and parking lots are always free. 
- Cool place if you like to gamble and party.
- A truly 24 hour city - you can do your grocery shopping, hit the gym, or go out to dinner 24/7. 
- The winters aren't warm (it's a desert, not the coast), but snow in the winter is never an issue. 
- Never humid, with a little extra conditioner you can get your hair to do whatever the hell you want it to and never have to worry about it going flat or frizzy.
- Amazing shopping (think Chanel rather than Intermix). 
- Fine dining epicenter (housed in casinos only). 

Cons: 
- The women in Vegas are vacuous, uneducated, with bad style. Frosted pink lipstick, huge fake boobs, haggard ex-druggie face, baby-T's and distressed denim, and lots of sweat. I feel like I'm in an eighties porno. 
- Incestuous social circles. 
- No locally grown food, and the stuff that is grown here isn't organic (or particularly nutritious since there is no decent soil in the valley). Consequently, the food off the strip is prepared with ingredients that are shipped in from California. These ingredients are picked before they are sufficiently ripened, treated with chemicals to artificially induce ripeness, and therein lies the reason why food in Vegas is tasteless and the flavors are so muted. 
- Limited things to do if you don't drink, gamble, or go to clubs. This means that if you are under 21, you are at home getting high and playing video games (I know I was). 
- No cultural innovation, since anyone remotely talented or creative moves somewhere else. No available jobs for creative professionals. 
- Commuter university that doesn't lend itself to the establishment of a college town culture. 
- One of the highest high school drop out rates in the nation.
- One of the least responsive media markets in the nation. You will never see a film being released here that isn't being released in at least 100 other cities. 
- Highest teen pregnancy rate in the nation, a result of the insidious but ever-present religious power complex that exists in this city, constantly wielding its power to crush anything progressive or reasonable (like planned parenthood). 
- Lesbian community rife w/ gnarly uneducated women in cowboy hats or catty pseudo-hipster college students. 
- Huge population of people with limited or no education occupying high paying professions, meaning that the people operating this city are dumb as rocks. 
- Limited mental health care facilities, which translates into having a substantial percentage of the local population self-medicated and driving drunk 24 hours a day (hence the astronomical DUI rates).
- One of the highest domestic abuse rates in the nation. Conjoin a bustling drug trade, the 24 hour availability of liquor, and underscore it all with a cultural milieu that hates women (ala conservative religious and androcentric sex trade gender politics), and you get sky high domestic abuse rates. 
- The city attracts people who can't successfully live anywhere else, whether its due to their disaffecting personality, addictive behavior, or delusional relationship with reality. 
- It's a small town masquerading as a big city. People move here because they think the valley is the Strip, when in actuality, if you're not on the Strip, you're essentially in a strip mall somewhere in Arkansas.
- Downtown gentrification projects and new high rise developments are elitist, the cost of which prohibit young, creative, and innovative people from affording them. 
- All apartments have carpeted floors. Like I really want to live on a pile of fabric that has been lived on by innumerable other people that is impossible to sanitize. 
- The men in Vegas fall into one of three categories. A) a tourist who wants to get drunk and fuck, B) local who wants to get drunk and fuck, and then go home to his unknowing wife, C) Las Vegas native with severe addiction/mommy/daddy issues.
- Inconvenient public trans, grid system city planning, no "green" spaces, recycling services that don't serve apartments.
- Post-segregation town; segregation was an irrefutable social scourge, but it encouraged the development of rich cultural enclaves (e.g., Little Tokyo, Little Italy, etc.). Vegas lacks these rich cultural hotspots.

Taquitos Jalisco serves up Mexican street food common to the state of Jalisco.  You might be more familiar with the state capital city, Guadalajara.  This particular restaurant has a "sister" property on Gilbert Road that I've heard has better tasting food than this location.  Hmmm... I may have to find out!  as this was very good Mexican street food!  There's a bandwagon forming for Taquitos Jalisco and it's making stops in Mesa!

Let me jump on the bandwagon for a ride too!  I missed the Yelper Lunch UYE here in April, but I scheduled my lunch group to go here this month.  I'd heard from Robyn N and Rand H that the place was small, but had no idea that by small they meant TINY!  The international lunch group that I organize was about 14 deep for lunch!  We were smart enough to arrive early.  Every table was taken once we got in the door.  Thankfully, it was not terribly hot outside and the tables outside were still open.  We gladly occupied those tables under the shade with the roar of the traffic on Broadway whizzing by.

I sat next to my buddy Dawn K and we split our food!  I ordered 3 carne asada Tacos and 2 Tamales.  I will say that I was disappointed with the Tacos.  The carne asada was a little dry for me.  But still tasty enough to enjoy.  The tamales were fantastic!  I split one of my tamales with the entire group so that everyone could get a taste.  But I saved the other for myself for lunch the next day!  Dawn K ordered a platter with 3 things on it.  Enchilada, Taco and a Chile Relleno.  I tried some of her Chile Relleno!  The chile relleno was extremely good.  It was my favorite thing that I tasted.  

I did not try it, but one lunch'er raved about the fish tacos and Robyn N also said their fish tacos were very good.  A slip of the brain as I would have ordered that instead of the carne asada taco.

Everyone in the group was happy, even the vegetarian lunch'er was happy with his veggie burrito!  Score!  This place is worth stopping in and trying.   

Remember, this is definitely a DIVE!  The parking lot is also very small.  It is on the north side of the street.  Pay attention.  The building is so small, you will likely drive past it and miss the turn.

I went to Two Hippies Breakfast Joint open-minded the other day... I was in the area and jonesing for some healthy but filling breakfast food.  Conveniently located just off 7th Ave between Indian School and Camelback, I pulled in when I saw the place and joined just a handful of other peeps inside.

First of all, the ambiance of this place is right on with their name... very hippy like.  Adorning the walls are all kinds of posters including the likes of Grateful Dead, Animal House, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Led Zeppelin, and even one of Bob Marley smoking a big fat jizzoint.  There are also license plates from all over the country, an old school pinball machine, and some bicycles.

The staff was super friendly - it's the type of place where you order at the counter and they call your name when your food is ready.  I looked at the menu and debated between doing a breakfast bowl and a bowl of oatmeal with a side of scrambled egg whites.  My decision was made when I was told that indeed the oatmeal is not the instant kind.  And they even served it with soy milk and blueberries per my request.  My dining companion went with a breakfast bowl burrito style and was happy with his order too...

The only negative (which I now see is in some of the previous reviews) is that it was disappointing to eat in and have our meals served on styrofoam... not only is it not so enjoyable to eat on styrofoam, but it's very un-hippylike!  

It's worth noting that this place has more than just breakfast - they also have burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, and salads... and they have free soup daily!

This place was better than the reviews reflect, especially for the price.  I would definitely return but since it's a bit out of my 3 mile radius, it may not be for awhile.  That should give them enough time to switch out the styrofoam!

We came here for a business lunch and left feeling as if we had just enjoyed something special. 

As our server Carlos bought us our menu and water glasses, I had already figured out what I was going to order.  I had been reading the Yelp reviews about their delicious Ceviche for $14.00. What caught my eye was the small cuts, almost diced portions of fish.  In some restaurants, it is almost like they are trying to overwhelm you with the size of the cuts.  Not here!  And yes, it was delicious!  Carlos asked how much spice I wanted before he mixed all the ingredients.  First class.

Also while we were checking in on Yelp, we found that there was $5.00 Off one Don Julio Blanco margarita. Thank you Yelp! They were also willing to substitute the offer for their Sangria. Nice!

My friend Richard S had the equally good breaded Coconut Calamari for $12.50. It was excellent!  

We split our bill and our lunch came to very reasonable $19.63, including taxes and tip. Next up will be coming here for their Happy Hour and Taco Tuesdays.

Located on the third floor on restaurant row and a hallway's distance from the newly erected Chelsea, the restaurant was elegant with a cool jazzy swagger to it. Warm Edison style lighting cascading above with a panoramic window view of the Bellagio fountains! What more could you ask for? Well, yeah great service comes with your reservation as well. Our server Titus was a pro! He was thoughtful friendly and attentive. That said, the supporting staff and sommelier were equally charming and helpful.  

I decided on the New Year's Eve pre fixe, no brainer right with a bottle of bubbly to accompany the memorable experience. 

Our first course was a tuna tartare prepared with pine nuts and topped with micro greens. The texture was light with a supple mouthfeel. It had a subtle nutty flavor to it tasting almost like a steak tartare, which I adore.  Two small toastettes accompanied this whimsically delicious starting dish, as well.


Second course was a roasted sea scallop topped with foie gras and served with a butternut squash raisin caper caponata. Now I've had my share of scallop dishes and for the most part I'm usually left feeling underwhelmed  but not with this dish. Foie gras and scallops are like a match made in foodie heaven. The thick and beautifully seared scallop medallion paired with rich velvety foie gras and the sweet & salty tang of the creamy butternut squash and caper caponata made each bite a flavor explosion in my mouth. Superb!


Just when I thought it couldn't get better, the following dish blew me away! A pumpkin ravioli topped with crumbled amaretto cookies. The Hand made ravioli was soft and perfectly cooked, the creamy pumpkin coupled with crunchy amaretto cookies was a play on all my senses! The sweet flavor and fragrant aroma also made this intoxicating dish not only decadent  but a satisfying flavor journey I'd gladly take again and again! 


The final savory dish was a wagyu beef served atop a creamy mash with spinach. Now this dish speaks for itself. You simply can't go wrong with perfectly medium rare wagyu beef. It just melts in your mouth, literally! It's a symphony of delights from start to finish. Encore! 

From the amazing cuisine, exceptional service, sleek & cool environs and awesome view, I really couldn't ask for more out of a wonderfully unforgettable NYE dinner.

Bravo Scarpetta!!!

Just because it's at the Four Seasons does not mean it's stuffy and pretentious.  Charlie Paler Steak has come into it's own and is now a great steak eatery.  Non steak eaters will not find much to eat (couple of fish dishes, a lobster, chicken breast, rack of lamb).

Yes it exudes elegance. Yes the service is steakhouse proper versus steakhouse friendly.  It's steakhouse service that guys would be comfortable bringing their ladies to.  

Straight forward steakhouse starters (oysters on the half shell, shellfish platter, prawn cocktail; nothing wrong, nothing stands out.   Excellent American Wagyu tartare with fried quail egg.  Hand cut beef, balanced seasoning.  Very good without being too cloying.  The pan seared foie is inventive.  The traditional sweetness and acidity is provided by a pineapple upside down cake and a strawberry gastrique.  Stunning.

Steak mains now impress. The Kagoshima A5, yes A5 filet mignon ($40/oz four ounce minimum).  Eclipses the A4 quality at other top steakhouses.  Simply seared and seasoned with sea salt.  Sublime.  Sweet, clean beef flavor  and it literally melts in your mouth.  Think otoro tuna.  The wet aged USDA Prime charcoal grilled filet is excellent.  Extremely high heat charcoal creates the perfect crust.  The charcoal imparts a good smoky bitterness that elevates the sweetness of the usually boring cut.  Finally the 28 day dry aged porterhouse.  Well trimmed with a more mild umame finish.  Nutty but not much bleu cheese flavor.

Sides are steakhouse standard but the standout remains the twice baked truffle potato.  Seriously good eats that adds a deem earthy flavor and richness to any steak.  Why more steakhouses don't make twice baked potato is beyond me.

Not calorie counting and wanting to splurge?  Add seared foie or bone marrow to any steak and put it over the top.

Tip:  Do check out their prefix menus which include bottomless pour wine pairings.

Excellent wine list with many smaller, hard to get producers.  Good selection of pinot noir.  Typical Vegas resort pricing.

Kagoshima A5.  Ahhh.

Of all the changes over the years at the Boulevard Mall, this Cinnabon is still here! I was in the area and thought I'd pop in to see if it was still around since I hadn't enjoyed one of their tasty gems in years. This was the only place in the food court with a line and the smell coming from Cinnabon was wonderful. There was a lady rolling out dough and another quickly moving customers in line through. They had the usual classic Cinnabon and Minibon warm and ready to eat and some packaged for those who want to take some on the go. Priced at $13.99 I picked up a "Classic 4 Pack" for take home and priced at $3.99 an order of "Cinnabon Stix" (5 pc.) that came with a side of cream cheese frosting. Hubby and I munched on the stix during out ride home and didn't really like them as much as we hoped to. The stix needed more cinnamon sugar to be enjoyable in my opinion. The classic rolls I heated up for dessert later were very good! There was plenty of cinnamon and cream cheese frosting on them and they heated up nicely. 

I noticed something else on the menu called "Center of the Roll" which is nothing but centers from their classic rolls pilled together with cream cheese frosting. I know what I'm trying next time!

Now that a week has gone by, I feel I can write this review and not become unhinged. My beloved cat Pepper, who was my constant companion for the last 2 years, spent last weekend at this Emergency Animal Clinic. Our regular vet told us to bring him here as it was the 24-hour animal hospital closest to our home. It turned out he had a very serious bladder stone condition, and come Monday, when we were able to see our regular vet, we made the heart-breaking decision that putting him down was the best thing to do. 

However, if the staff at this EAC had managed to give us all the information they had, we might have been able to save Pepper a lot of pain and misery sooner and maybe us hundreds if not thousands of dollars. First of all, this place is ghetto. Nothing about the appearance and upkeep inspires any confidence. Secondly, they have rotating doctors and technicians, so you are always talking to someone new. And everyone has a different opinion, and most of them were inconsistent with what our vet told us in the end. The reception area staff was unprofessional. The first girl we spoke to stammered over how to ask when Pepper had last urinated or defecated. Um... how about learning and using appropriate terminology? The person entering my information transposed 2 of the numbers of my cell phone number. No wonder they had to call my husband instead. I verbally corrected it with them over the phone, but when we went in later that day, they still had not changed it on Pepper's  paperwork, so we took out a pen and fixed it ourselves. They neglected to call us when Pepper's urethra blocked yet again within the first 12 hours. They neglected to call us when his temperature spiked again and he became agitated. They said they told my husband the results of his blood tests over the phone, but he does not recall hearing that information. They did let us come see him several times, and while we were waiting to be led back to the cages, we were regaled with loud and stupid personal conversations, that apparently the staff did not care that the rest of us in the waiting room could hear. It just pissed me off that we were all in life-and-death situations and they were all into their petty gossiping. Not that I expect a medical practice to be a somber graveyard, but appropriate conversation at an appropriate volume would simply show respect for the clientele. 

When I told my boss, a fellow cat lover and downtown resident, what happened, she said that she too had once taken a cat to this EAC in an emergency. It was having severe upper respiratory problems, and they were having some trouble getting it out of its carrier. So instead of getting my boss to see if she could coax it out, they tied a rope around its neck. Around the neck of a cat who couldn't breathe. She took the cat somewhere else immediately.

I will also never go here again in an emergency, and have since spoken to a number of people who have given me other options should I find myself in need of immediate after hours care. Our bill (which had to be pre-paid, mind you) was nearly $2000. Outrageous indeed.

I've been to Share probably 2-3 times in the past couple of years and it's pretty much the same thing every time. I think if you haven't been to Share, it's definitely worth going at least once so you can take it all in, so to speak. It's one of the only nice gay clubs in Vegas and although you might be tempted to opt for Marquee or Tryst, sometimes, you just wanna gay it up. It's by no means anything fancy, but it isn't trashy either. Located just a short taxi ride away from the Strip (I think I paid around $12 from the Wynn), it's a good option if you want to let loose and be fabulous. Again as other Yelpers said, it's best to go with a group so you can have a good time.

- Expect it to be kind of empty.
- Expect some good dancy upbeat pop/hiphop music.
- Expect the drinks to be around $10 (not bad for Vegas IMO)
- Expect some hottie gay-for-pay dancers that will probably spend more time hitting on your hag than trying to get your attention.
- Expect to awkwardly avoid sexual advances from the Vegas locals (they are aggressive and can bite, unless you like that)
- Expect to be standing the entire time (because the empty seats are reserved for bottle service, which NO ONE is paying for)
- Expect to leave happy you experienced it, but somewhat disappointed.

That's all folks!

Michelin rated 1 star. 

Bellagio hotel with a view of the waterfall show.

Need I say more.

Well, I'll say more than that.

The food was well executed and thought out. 

I tried the degustation menu.

First Course:

Sea urchin ice cream: This was like a sea urchin mouse. Subtle flavors but creamy and a hint of sea urchin, I taste more of the cream. Probably my least favorite of the tasting menu.

Foie Gras: Since California banned foie gras, I had to indulge as much as I can while I'm here. It had a small piece of foie gras on top of a raisin type of bread. I actually felt like the the foie gras tasted better along. The foie gras, i felt was a little over cooked but the it had some really tender areas. 

Chilean Sea Bass: This was probably the best dish. The sea bass was melt in your mouth, with a nice sauce to compliment it. Really good!

Suckling Pig: They gave you an assortment of pork, from the more dry area of the pig, to the more fatty area, it was a good variety into the pigs anatomy.

Cheese: They gave a nicely decorated flower shape cheese, it was very good, creamy and flavorful for cheese. 

Coconut Dessert: This probably was my favorite part of the dinner. The dessert came on an open coconut, inside was a mixed dessert of coconut, nuts, cream, and various other flavors, it was so good. I could of gotten another one.

The service of course of a Michelin starred restaurant was superb and the presentation of fabulous. 

Not the most amazing meal I had but definitely well thought out menu, service and presentation.

The grilling of food over an open flame is almost 125,000 years old.

And, the Habit Burger story is an interesting one. http://www.habitburger.com/story/  Yet the charbroiling of hamburgers and chicken is a cooking technique that many fast food places have yet to master.  Until now that is. We came here this past Saturday and came away thinking, Wow.

The menu is very familiar.  It will remind many of "In 'n Out" in it's simplicity and style of service.  Their Char-burger is $2.95 and the Double Char is $3.95. I don't know if you can order it animal style, but the burgers are delicious.  Yes, delicious.  It has that smokey char-boiled taste down to where you will want lick your fingers.

Other grilled Habit Burger sandwiches include, Chicken for $5.75, Tri-Tip beef $6.25, as well as Veggie options and Albacore Tuna.  The Sides include French fries, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and a salad range in price from $1.85 to $2.65.  

Besides a side of salad, Habit Burger also has six different Specialty Salads to choose from, ranging from a Garden for $3.95 to a Santa Barbara Chicken Cobb for $6.95.

A couple of burgers, a side of sweet potato fries and a drink ran us $12.68, including tax.  Wow.  Less expensive than "SmashBurger", slightly more than "In 'n Out"; but a lot better tasting.  Nice.

Enjoy!

Well well well... I'm the first to review the new Dick's location. Of course I am. I can already hear this review screaming ROTD and I haven't even written it yet... 

1. I'm not gay. This is probably the fourth Yelp in which I've disclosed this. It's not important because you should care what my orientation is but so that you can get a sense of this place from the hetero-perspective.   

2. Many people think I'm in the closet. So if you're rolling your eyes at number one, you're not alone. 

3. Granted, my speech patterns and flamboyant style are confusing, especially if you're from the midwest.* 

4. People are gonna think what they want and life is just really, really good anyway. 

5. I was DD one night and we were driving from E. McDowell to Cenpho. Someone, who shall remain nameless, screams from the back seat, "DICKS!" 

6. We go.

7. The two ladies I "brought" loved it. 

8. One of the dancers is "huge." I want one of those. 

9. I can appreciate male beauty. There were maybe one or two pretty dudes but the rest were just ridiculously fit. Six packs and the like... 

10. Apparently, three more minutes of the grind and my lady friend was gonna not be not actively orgasming. She was with the "huge" dude. 

11. She went back the next night. 

12. My other friend's personal dancer said, "I think I'm enjoying this more than you are." I hang with some sexy ladies. I'm very lucky. 

13. It's fully nude if I haven't made that clear. 

14. There is a no cell phone use policy, which I had no idea they would enforce. 

15. Punishment for using cell phone: The most twinkish dancer among them came over and started grinding in my crotch with his ass. Like........ yeah. If that wasn't bad enough, he kept screaming "Pull my hair!" Dude. "Don't call me dude!" Sorry, Dude. "Don't call me dude!!!" "Smack my ass!" 

16. They make straight dudes pay to get in. Remedy that immediately, please. If I'm there with 2 or 7 women, and your gaydar doesn't go off, hook a brother up. 

*Just kidding middle America.

I love, love Scramble! I don't know what it is about the place! Is it the sleek and simple decor? Hmm, is it the friendly, attentive service? Is it the supa yum food? Perhaps all of the above make me a fan of this joint! 

I so love Scramble ( Did I say that already?). On my first visit, I was with Mr. Hottie and we were Harley geared out . The staff didn't bat an eyelash at our rough appearances. They were warm and welcoming. I had the traditional eggs Benedict. I thought it was very good! I washed it down with a cup of coffee and was ready to tackle the rest of my day! 

On my second visit I had the biscuits and gravy. WHAT a huge portion! I wasn't terribly impressed by the dish, however. I guess I expected a little more flavoring in the gravy, but overall, the dish was satisfying. 

My third visit had me munching on the spicy and tasty chorizo and egg burro with extra avocado. Mmm... I couldn't eat the whole burro. I ate almost half of it and took the rest home. 

Each time I visit Scramble I am impressed by the staff. There is a person on the floor at all times checking on people and making sure their food is ok. Considering this is a walk up and order type of place, it's a nice change to not be forgotten after you receive your food. 

I know that Scramble will be a regular breakfast stop for me. It's nice to see such a great place take a chance on Sunnyslope. I think they'll come out winners!

I'm so glad I finally gave Rollin Smoke a try and that I didn't go here by myself as I would've driven away. The location isn't that great. It's close to a strip club, adult stores, etc. Tits and BBQ - this is a man's restaurant. The BBQ aroma fills the air inside the restaurant and sticks to your hair and clothes (had to shampoo my hair twice).

The food was amazing!  I'm not the biggest fan of ribs so, for me to like this place is a major deal. We had a meat Trio: brisket, pork and ribs with waffle fries and Mac n cheese. I liked everything we got. The meats were tender, juicy and smokey. I poured some house BBQ sauce on the meats for more flavor. The waffle fries were very crispy and I wanted to order more. The Mac n cheese has a smokey taste to it as well but was runny...still damn good though. The chicken sandwich and a black berry cobbler were ok.

This is not a fast-food restaurant so, expect to wait about 20 minutes or more to get your food. It's worth the wait.

" It's a Bird ... It's a Plane ... It's Superwomen " Just kidding. It's just me getting ready to drop 108 floors from the Stratosphere tower. 

The Sky Jump had been on my Bucketlist ever since I went Sky diving 21,000 ft. last year. Since this jump was only 855ft. and a controlled descent like Bungee jumping, I thought piece of cake, right? NO, I was so wrong.

There are 3 different packages to chose from:
- $119.00 for the Jump
- $129.00 for the Jump and photos
- $149.00 for the Jump, photos and wristband. All photos uploaded on a USB.

There is a separate admission fee to the tower which is $20.00. The good thing is If your a guest of the hotel, admission fee is waived and they give you a discount for the Jump.

I chose the more expensive package. When Im old and grey, I want to be able to look at videos and photos and remember in my youth that I WAS A BADASS.

After I paid for my package and signed my deathwish, I got suited up. The suit was a cute blue jumper. My friends were too scared to even go up the Stratosphere, so they stayed downstairs in the " waiting zone " which is also where you land.

There were three other people doing the jump so we all walked into the elevator together. At this point I wish I had taken a shot or two. Why had I choosen to eat a buffet instead? The ride up the elevator seemed like an eternity. The doors finally opened at the 108th floor. I followed the employee to the jump area. 

Before you walk on the ledge, your taken to a room where your straps are attached to your 
Blue suit. Its all glass so all guest visiting at the Observation deck can see this being done. Guest were taking photos of me probably because only insane people do stuff like sky jump off tall buildings.

I finally walked on the ledge and another employee double checked my straps. He had me turn around and take a photo and then  explained how my wrist camera worked. Once he said the spill, he told me to jump when I was ready.

It was 8pm on Saturday night and here I was standing on a ledge from one of the tallest buiding ever built. I looked down to the Strip and see Trump Towers. From way above Trump Towers looks only a few feet high. When I did my first sky dive, I wasnt too scared but since I had to go off the ledge at my free will, the thought scared me. I put my big girl pants on and .....

Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!
Like the Movie Toy Story said " Its not falling, its flying with Grace " 

Before I could take it all in, it was over. I landed on the ground and immediately looked up. The jump was so high which I didnt realize until afterwards. One of the best experiences in my life. Words cant describe it. I loved the thrill. 

Once is good enough for me. Its a must do for all thrill seekers.

I was in Scottsdale for 1 night and the local Yelpers on Talk suggested I check out Pomo, so I dropped by for dinner and to add a Scottsdale Pizza joint to my Pizza Bender Tour 2011 Edition.  I was solo and there was a 15-25 minute wait for a table.  I didn't mind and waited until my name was called.

After a 20 min wait, I was seated.  My server's name was Michelle and she was very enthusiastic and helpful.  After browsing the menu, I decided to get the Don Alfonso (Tomatoes San Marzano DOP, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Italian Salame Piccante, Italian Sausage, Roasted Bell Pepper, $14.95) and a glass of house Cabernet ($6).  The Pizza is Napoletana Style....Google it if you don't know what it is.
http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=napoletana+pizza

After a short wait my Pizza was brought out.  I took a bite out of the first slice and instantly became a fan!  The Crust was soft and chewy and the ingredients were fresh....it reminded me of the Pizza I had in Napoli, Italy.  I finished the entire Pizza and still wanted more when I was finished.  The middle of the Pizza is soft and wet, so if you don't prefer your Pizza this way, don't come here.  You'll be missing out on some great Pizza though!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A?select=Me5jFmm9lrWCfKaRI4OtFQ

After dinner Michelle suggested a dessert.  I went for the Bigne Al Cioccolato (Cream Puffs Filled With Light Pastry Cream and Drizzled With  Chocolate, $7.95).  I'm glad Michelle suggested it, because it was fantastic!  The Cream Puffs were excellent and the Chocolate wasn't too heavy....just the way I like it!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Gv2aZfTlYImmsERZg5D93A?select=LEZcnTOv7H9irlpSm7dMhA

Overall, it was an awesome dinner.  I'm glad I listened to the local AZ Yelpers.  Can't wait to come back.

Return Factor - 99%

Eating at a buffet is all about choices and 500+ items automatically makes it 5 stars and the greatest daily buffet in Vegas history.  If you can't find at least 25 things you enjoy here, you might want to consider seeking professional help.  

They really excel at a lot of the buffet staples like pizza, sushi, and fried chicken.  A stand alone restaurant could be set up on each of these dishes and they'd average at least a 3 star Yelp rating for sure.  But you gotta love the unique food items like handmade tortillas, lamb chops, ribeye, ramen, kobe sliders and THEN the dessert section good lord!  My advice would be to check that area out first so you have some idea of what you may want to try before going for that 5th plate of Peking duck with a side of pasta.  I am not saying all the food is 4-5 star quality but Bacchanal Buffet is pretty amazing as a whole.  

Avoid peak hours or try to find a gambling degenerate friend with a 7-star players card to avoid the line completely.  I was there on a Wednesday night at 8pm and the line wasn't long at all.  

Bravo to Caesars Palace for finally having a buffet worthy of their resort!

It makes me sad to write this update, but it has to be done.

My very good friend Brenda celebrated her 50th birthday yesterday and she wanted to do two things to celebrate it:  have her favorite VPN pizza down the street at Village Square and then have her favorite chocolate cappuccino here at Sambalatte.  Simple, right?  Well, no, apparently not.

Anyone who knows me knows that I've been a big fan of Sambalatte since it opened.  I've been coming here for a while and I even introduced Brenda to this cafe and to my favorite drink, the chocolate cappuccino, which then became her favorite drink.
Now, I'd noticed already on prior visits that if you arrive close to closing time, your drink will be served in a to-go cup, which I thought made sense because they were about to close in a few minutes.  However, we arrived at precisely 7:54pm and they were closing at 9:00pm.  When Brenda placed her order, she was told that her beloved chocolate cappuccino would be served in a to-go cup. 
 "Why is that?" Brenda asked.  
 "Because we're closing in an hour.  It's the owner's policy," replied the Samba lady.
  "OK, but it's 7:54," Brenda replied. (We know this because the three of us all checked our cellphones right then.)
 "It says 8:00pm on my clock," "says the Samba lady.
  "OK, but it's only 7:54pm AND it's her birthday,"  I chimed in.
  "Sorry, but it's the owner's policy.  We can't change it. If we serve the drinks in the porcelain cups, people hang around."

Is this not a cafe?  If we wanted to-go cups, we could have gone to one of the chains.  If you don't want people to "hang around," why are you in business?  Is it too much trouble to wash your cups at night?
Now we know.  Brenda placed her Sipping Rewards card on the counter, we turned around, and went to the cafe at Tivoli Village.  They served us pleasantly and Brenda got her birthday chocolate cappuccino just like she wanted.
This may not seem like a big deal to anyone but us. Brenda just wanted to enjoy her drink with the leaf design and hang out for an hour as she's done on several prior visits.  There are lots of people who love Sambalatte as I have. They won't notice that they lost us as customers. I get it .  But, you don't treat loyal customers like that, especially if they're my friends.  End rant.

A late night dessert restaurant is something every area of town needs, and the southwest area is no exception.  So Serenade is definitely a welcome addition to this part of town! 

We arrive after 8 pm and most of the tables are occupied by those enjoying hot drinks, on their laptops, or enjoying a sweet treat.  We grab the one large table by the counter and it takes awhile for us to decide.  Ultimately, we get the Honey Bread ($8.50) (aka Honey Toast) with extra honey and two drinks - the Pistachio Latte ($4.50) and the Peppermint Latte ($4.50).  The flavor is quite subtle for the Pistachio Latte and the Husband enjoyed it.  The Little Guy preferred my Peppermint Latte more though.  The honey bread is lovely as usual, but they do offer a Garlic version for 50 cents more.  Apparently it's garlic butter instead of plain butter used on it. 

The menu has your standard cafe drinks, hot and cold.  Waffles, cakes, pizzas, and pastries are among the items to munch on.

They offer outside seating and blankets too!

Stamp cards are available via the Epoxy app, so download for your Buy 9 Get 1 Free cards.  

Since they are located in the Smiths's Shopping Center, and the same corner as Rice N Noodle and Patty's Closet, there is plenty of parking available.  Free WiFi - look for the pass code on the board behind the register.

Overall, a nice alternative to meet up with friends at for coffee and cake.

I read all the other reviews and I did not get the same service that everyone else got. I walked in yesterday hoping that I would get the help that I needed to get started. I stood in the front counter waiting for someone to help me. When finally I get a " can I help you " 

I told this person that I wanted to know what I needed to get started and what should I purchase just to get me going. He pointed that two items " this one and this one " then started talking to one of his friends that walked into the shop. I was shocked I came in expecting to buy a kit but after that there is no way I'm going to spend my money here. 

I went to Pink Spot Vapors now that's the place that know how to treat new and old customers.

Consider me a big fan!  

I was perusing potential spots for dinner last night and then I saw My T's picture of the 5 spice game hen and it..waS...ON.  They bake the game hen and THEN deep fry it!  Why don't more spots bake and then fry things?  It tasted even better than it looked.  The side of tomato rice was really good too.  I almost never rave about eating bird but I will be having this again.   

Another favorite was their shaken beef salad.  I was shaken up after my first freakin bite!  The beef was so juicy and so tender and only $12!  The hot grilled beef mixed with the cool lettuce, onion, tomato and spices made for one of the best salads I've had in recent memory. 

The Mekong River noodle soup was just ok.  It looked great and was filled with lots of fixings like fish balls, pork tenderloin, quail eggs, veggies and shrimp but the pork based broth fell short for me.  I saw a lot of customers going for the bone marrow soup and holy shit what a spectacle that was.  HUGE bones!  Me would feel like caveman and raise bone like champion (grunt!).  Check out the pics of it.  

But man oh man so much other stuff I want to try like the slow braised pork belly entree, crispy bird nest noodle and more shaken beef!  They're located in the old Cravin Cajun spot so it's great for groups.  I hope they get their liquor license soon.

I had high hopes. Obama is our president...the Cardnials are one win away from the super bowl....things are looking good. 

I would have to say that Fuego didn't live up to the expectations. The prices are a bit high (20$ per plate) for the style of the place (casual) and for the food itself. It was good, but not great. 

We had the empanadas. Interesting...but try them at Mi Cocina Mi Pais (great!). Fuego's are good...but too much pastry...and a sauce that tasted like a wing sauce (like would be great on hot wings but overwhelmed the empanadas). 

The drinks were good but again not amazing. Mismatched glasses and plates (I mean that is sort of cute, but not for a nice dinner out).

The Ropa and the Pernil were good. The corn was ok (not enough flavor) and the mashed potatoes were overpowered with chipotle flavor (which I usually like)

Everyone was nice. Our server was a little too familar...but whatever. There was this really sad folksy music playing. For a cuban/latin place, get some freaking latin cuban music.   The music made the whole vibe a bit odd.  I felt I should go get high afterwards and think about the sadness in this world...:)   But (my wife is making me say this)...the singer was talented. Keep up the good work buddy, maybe at a different venue.

Overall, it was ok. Not worth the drive and probably won't be coming back. With so many other great places in PHX, this one needs some fine tunning to be amoung the list.

I typically like to keep the money in our state and if I'm making a big purchase, I will do it in Arizona. However, when it comes to this Gucci, I will most likely only make purchases elsewhere. I've had several disappointing experiences here. 

Customer service is big for me and when walking into a high-end store such as Gucci, I look for quality customer service. Sadly, I get the opposite here. I purchased a purse and a month into having it, the strap broke. The purse was only a month old. I brought in my new purse with a broken strap into this Gucci and asked them if they could replace it since it was a brand new purse. They immediately said no and said that they would need to send it back to the factory to be fixed. I understand this requirement if the purse has been used and owned for awhile, but this was practically a brand new purse. However, I followed the rules and let them send it into the factory. Six weeks later, I finally got it back. I thought it would be as good as new and not give me any other problems. I took my purse on a work trip to San Francisco a couple months later and in the middle of my trip, the same exact strap broke a second time. This time it left me without a purse on my work trip. Since I was in San Francisco, I immediately went over to the Union Square location and explained the situation. They were horrified that Gucci didn't replace it the first time and without any questions, they exchanged my broken bag for a brand new one and sent me on my way. Now that's customer service and I'm sad that it took the Gucci in San Francisco (and not Scottsdale) to give it to me. I was very disappointed with how Gucci in Scottsdale treated me. 

During a second experience, I had Gucci sunglasses with scratched lenses. I love my sunglasses and wanted to fix or replace the lenses. I figured that Gucci was my best bet so I took my sunglasses into this location because it was my only Gucci store option. I explained the situation and asked them if they could send my sunglasses to be fixed. Without a second glance, they said no and that there was nothing that could be done and sent me on my way. A couple months later, I discovered another sunglass store in Fashion Square and decided to ask them about fixing my lenses. To my surprise, they did it for a reasonable cost and my sunglasses were like new. Sadly, Gucci was not the store who helped me and I had to resort to another business. 

I like Gucci products and I typically like Gucci service, but unfortunately this particular Gucci location lacks the customer service and I will therefore shop at other locations and not this one.

Ohhhh myyyy goshhhh I LOVED this place! =)

So my friend wanted to go to dinner one lovely evening. I found this place on Yelp and it sounded really good. For the entree I ordered the Baked Artisan Goat Cheese Crepes. This thing was freaking amazinggggg... So good! It came with spinach, herb grilled wild mushrooms, roasted bell pepper sauce, and watercress salad. The special sauce that was on it was really good as well. For drinks, you HAVE to get the Bunny Slope. I saw a picture of it on Yelp and just had to try it. It comes with Vodka, Strawberry Cream Infusion, White Chocolate Liqueur. You wouldn't think it was that strong since it's on the thicker side but it was! So dam yummy! 

Not only was the food amazing but the service was spectacular. This place has only been open for a little over a year but I really enjoyed it. My only recommendation is maybe they need a little more decor in the place. The walls felt a little bit of plain jane. I will DEFINITELY be coming back for dinner, AND they have a happy hour that they will most likely see me at in the near future. =)

This cake kicks other cake's @$$es, now queue the Rocky Theme Song!

Day after day, driving from bakery to bakery, looking for the perfect cake to present at the wife and my 30th birthday extravaganza. It was tedious work, but somebody had to do it. I felt a bit like Rocky Balboa, climbing up and down the endless flight of stairs and beating up on that hanging slab of meat. Except my stairs and cow was a fork and cake; plate to mouth lift, plate to mouth lift. You can work up a sweat just thinking about it.

It's wasn't easy choosing a bakery for that top notch cake. Chocolate cake, vanilla cake, marbled, and layered, filled with strawberry jam, raspberry ganache, topped with butter cream, cream cheese icing, fondant, rum infused; it's enough to make your head spin. I had to sacrifice and dedicate the countless hours of time to complete this task; but in the end, I got it done.

Good, bad, and indifferent, we made it through the first 5 or 6 opponents and ultimately found ourselves pitted against Kick Ass Kakes. Jay started throwing punches, left hook, right hook, upper cut, KO; I didn't think Rocky was ever KO'd in the movies, but maybe it was just a sugar coma - I'll go with that.

Jay got behind our crazy idea for a Hot Dog shaped cake; we 'were' catering Short Leash Hot Dogs after all and wanted a fun cake to go along!  Most other bakers we met with explained 'how difficult of a job it would be', how it would be 'better as a regular cake with hot dogs designed onto it', or lets 'craft little hot dogs and place them around the cake' instead. Jay was the only baker we met with who had the confidence to actually pull off what we were looking to do, and he did not disappoint!

You can check out the picture of our cake if you're interested; *view at your own risk* you might just get K.O.'d from looking at it. Ours is the cake that looks like a big hot dog! ;-)

Jay battered us silly with an awesome red velvet cake, filled with a perfect cream cheese icing, topped with fondant, and shaped to look like a Short Leash Hot Dog. It was a hit, everyone was knocked out with amazement at how cool the cake looked. This was the perfect center piece to our catered celebration!

Thanks again K.A.K's! You can bet we'll be around again for some of those cupcakes and macaroons you bake up daily, just let us recuperate a little before our next prized fight.

I WAS going to give this place a 4 star review...until an unfortunate incident recently.  

I shop at this store from time to time - they have a small selection of natural/organic snack foods and I love that they have a little deli as well (which I haven't had the chance to try).  Trader Joe's and Sprouts have a better selection, but this place is close to my place and I like to support local business.

I'm perusing the aisles after the gym one afternoon, texting on my phone, and generally, minding my own business.  I picked up just 2 or 3 things - some kale, some sort of delicious gluten-free snack, etc - and I headed to the check out line.  As I'm checking out, an older employee says to me:

Old, rude man: "Did you put something in your purse?"  
Me: *Looks around, confused* "Umm, I'm sorry, what?"
Old, rude man: "I think I saw you put something from the shelf into your purse."  
Me: *Kind of laughs, offended, but more awkward* No.  Definitely not.
Old, rude man with no social skills: "Can I take a look?"
Me: *in disbelief* "Yeah - go right ahead."  *opens purse, shuffles through it for him to see*
Old, rude man:  "Oh.  Ok."

End scene.

Look, I get that you're protecting your store - so, if you think you saw me steal something, kudos to you for asking.  However, when you realize that I did NOT, in fact, steal anything, and that you just accused a paying customer or shoplifting, that would be the appropriate time to apologize to said customer...but as I stood there waiting, mouth agape, I realized there would be no apology forthcoming.

Now, I wasn't embarrassed, because well, I'm me....but most people would be mortified.  The fact that he didn't apologize or even acknowledge that he mistakenly accused me of theft is extremely off-putting.  The checker girl didn't say anything either.  It was all a bit odd.  It was so odd in fact, that when I got to my car, I double checked my purse just to make sure nothing had accidentally fallen in!!  (Nothing had.)

Sad about this review - I really liked that store.

A modern and elegant Japanese restaurant popping up at the intersection of Flamingo and Decatur was definitely unexpected. But here, Yonaka takes fusion and knocks it out of the park. Too often, Asian fusion takes a wrong turn (at least on my taste buds). But I could just die at the perfection of each and every dish served up here. Its beautiful to look at and even better to taste.

I'll start by saying that I've left every meal feeling light and healthy. Nothing is overladen with fat, sodium or sauce and I've come to prefer eating my uncooked fish here over any other place in Vegas. Fusion or not, this place is the real deal. Top-quality fish and expertly sliced nigiri. We sampled the Toro, Salmon Belly, Saba, Hamachi, Hirame, Scallop and Beef Tongue. The Saba was a winner (I love my cured mackerel) but the Hamachi had to be my favorite flavored with jalapeno miso. The beef tongue wasn't my cup of tea. It seemed overly dry and had a slight jerky quality to it which only added to the oddness of it being served as nigiri.

After that, it was all enjoyable again. We came late and ordered a the Konpa and Brussel Sprouts off the Happy Hour menu (Everyday 5-630 & 11-2). Those brussel sprouts are totally addicting and the innovative combination of salmon, yellowtail and apricots is news to me. Toss in some jalapenos and tomato chips and you've found the must order item on the HH menu (also available on the regular menu w/ a higher price tag). On the main menu, their take on crudo is perfection with candied quinoa. The tuna nicoise, machitaki, umi matsuri, and shirohana were all equally as fabulous. Next trip, I'm trying some of their hot items for sure!

After all of that, I have to rave over the prices. Rave in positivity and gloriousness. As if the already low-prices weren't alluring enough, the HH menu is downright irresistible. Recherche, creative and artistic cuisine in a strip mall on Flamingo is as random as it gets. But as soon as you see the modern and minimalistic design of the interior, you will be impressed from first glance to final taste. 

Basically, everything is amazing. And needless to say, like everyone else I'm beyond fangirl-ing (or fanboy-ing for my male Yelpers) over Yonaka.

Jol Robuchon was the choice for the girlfriend and my dinner on our first night in Vegas.  While there were plenty of other, much less expensive, restaurants I could've taken my girlfriend, unbeknownst to her, I planned to propose to her over dinner and the occasion called for something special.  Upon stepping through the door and up until we left several hours later, Jol Robuchon exuded style, class, opulence, and Franco/Vegas charm in all facets of its operation. We elected to have the 16 (or so)-course degustation menu.  The team of wait staff was off the charts with its informed, surgically precise, personable, but never "stuffy" service throughout our meal.  Likewise, the sommelier was spot on with her wine recommendations (we had two splits, one white and one red), which were surprisingly affordable and very well suited complements to the varied courses of food received.

Our meal started off with a bread cart, which was more aptly described as a boulangerie on wheels.  Every type of French style bread or roll was present and was served with amazingly creamy butter and an exotic sea salt.  After the bread, came our culinary Tour de Force.  We received the following...

La Cerise - Cherry gazpacho with pistachios and ricotta ice cream
La Tomate - Salad of tomato with basil infused olive oil, tomato gele topped with mozzarella  
Le Caviar - Red turnip and radish with yellowtail carpaccio, delicate cream of corn, caviar on a fennel cream served as a surprise
La Saint-Jacques - Pan seared sea scallop in green curry and fresh coriander
Les Crustacs - Truffled langoustine ravioli, Sea urchin prepared in "chaud-froid" with anise juices, spiny lobster served atop spinach in a black Malabar pepper sauce
Les Petits Pois - Sweet green pea veloute with vegetable aroma and hints of mint
Le Foie Gras - Seared foie gras with red berries and kumquat compote
Le Bar - Pan-fried sea bass with a lemon grass foam and stewed baby leeks
Le Boeuf - Grilled beef rib-eye, black olive and bone marrow condiment
Le Broccolini - Broccollini and soybean sprouts cooked as a risotto
Le Pop-Fraise - Fresh strawberries and strawberry mousse with Ros Champagne cream and soursop sorbet
Le Dome - Black fruits on a delicate chocolate fondant and dolce.

Our meal closed with the Le Moka-Le Th, a cart filled with over 35 different Mignardises.  It was the proverbial sweet finale to an amazing meal!  Every course was beautiful in its presentation, but easily matched by the complex, yet exquisite flavors delivered with every bite.  In truth, I can't pick a favorite course since they were each amazing in their own unique way.  It was definitely not traditional French bistro fare.  

Jol Robuchon was the perfect choice for our most special occasion.  I highly recommend it for yours.  And if you were still wondering...she did say, "Yes".

Made a huge mistake and went to the airport hungry.....damn.  Since I was stuck at the airport, I decided to try a new place.  My flight was out of gate B-12 and there is a 360 Gourmet Burrito joint that I've spotted here in the past....so I went for it.  There was no line and the menu is pretty large with a lot of options.

The lady working the register kept asking me for my order even after I told her I needed a few minutes to review the menu.  I decided on a Steak Burrito (Steak, Rice, Beans, Cheese, Lettuce, $6.99) and blurted it out......before I could say anything else, a guy handed me a Burrito....wow, that was fast!  I also ordered a bottle of Water ($2.99) and a bag of Jalapeno Chips ($1.99).

The Burrito was small....about 1/2 the size of a Chipotle or Q'doba Burrito.....and it is very Bland.  The Beans had no flavor.  Additionally, there's no Salsa on it.....and there is no Salsa Bar.  WTH?  I looked up at the menu and saw that Salsa is $.99 extra.  Dammit, nobody told me this.  Actually, for extra cash you could get Guacomole ($1.25), Sour Cream ($.99), or Salsa ($.99) in your Burrito...or bundle them all together for an additonal $2.99...what?!!  That would have made this tiny Burrito $9.98, no freakin' way!  Glad I didn't see that.

Anyway, it was a complete waste of money and calories.  Save yourself and don't stop here if you're at McCarran Airport.

Will I return?  No!

3.5 stars.

Freddy's Frozen Custard & Steakburgers is apparently known for their burgers and custard, but I haven't tried either! The first visit I only ordered fries because I'm not into burgers and wasn't too hungry. I also hit up the drive-thru on my first visit so I still wasn't sure what Freddy' s was all about and since hubby was in the mood for a burger I suggested we go back and try this place again. Since Freddy' s promotes Chicago dogs outside their building and the fact that they use vienna all beef hot dogs, I figured they were based out of Chicago. Nope! Freddy' s started in Wichita, KS. The burgers are fresh, never frozen and grilled to order. Custard is churned fresh daily at each location. I will try the custard on the next visit!

This visit though, I ordered a "Chili Cheese Dog" priced at $3.89 and "Chili Cheese Fries" priced at $3.59. The hot dog, all beef, was topped with chili, cheese and onions. I enjoyed it! The chili cheese fries were much bigger then I expected. The fries are shoestring and covered in chili, cheese and onions. I liked that nacho cheese sauce was used and I love shoestring fries, but the fries were soggy from not being hearty enough to hold all of the toppings. I'm a fan of onions rings so I ordered some priced at $2.29 and found them to be pretty good. The onion rings weren't as thick as I would like, but they were big round-wise and cooked just right. Hubby ordered a double "Hatch Green Chili Burger" priced at $5.49 and he enjoyed it. 

The inside was clean and the employees friendly.

"Eat rice, drink tea, slurp noodles, stay healthy".  Maybe.

Accept this about all Asian restaurants on the Strip:
1)  Prices are 2x-3x higher than your local joint.
2)  Portions are smaller but prettier.
3)  Flavors are not authentic.
4)  Specialty drinks are delicious.
5)  Service is excellent.

Straight to it, the food.  It's properly cooked by Western standards.  Veg in stir fries are still crisp and vibrant, deep fried chicken still moist, and scallops tender not rubber balls.  Seasonings and flavors are loosely Asian but are subdued and for the uninitiated.  Don't expect undertones of sweet, fermented fish sauce or umame charged fermented black beans.  The subdued flavors do work better with their creative mixed drinks.

Skip the everyday items or risk leaving upset at the price (miso soup at $9, beef broccoli at $25).  Opt for the extravagant.  The lobster tail in ginger onion soy glaze is good.  Correctly cooked.  The simple earthy soy does enhance the sweetness of the lobster and the ginger adds zest.  The togarashi rubbed seared ahi with a miso lime sauce is very good.

The only serious fault remains the sushi.  Questionable freshness.  The Uni, off color and fishy.  The sweet shrimp, slightly ammoniated and tacky mouth feel.  Creative rolls still miss the mark.  Over sauced, unbalanced flavors, bizarre cooking techniques.  Is the chef so vain he can't try one of the many AYCE joints and see how Vegas style sushi is done?  Face it, asking a Chinese chef to prepare Japanese sushi is the same as asking a Italian pizza cook to make dim sum.

To the credit of management, service problems have been correct.  Everyone is familiar with the menu and can describe dishes.  Bar staff who float ask regular staff before making recommendations.

Standard Asian beers.  Fairly priced introductory sakes.  

Want authentic national and regional Asian cuisines, look off the Strip.  Looking for some great cocktails and correctly cooked "Asian" inspired food Rice and Company modestly delivers.

Recently I was invited to a dinner which featured several of the most famous Las Vegas Japanese restaurant owners. It was unanimous in their opinion that they believed RAMEN TATSU was the best TOKYO RAMEN-YA in America. Yes, you heard that statement correctly. TATSU is NOT a Kyushu Ramen-Ya, it is a TOKYO style Ramen-Ya that specializes in Shoyu style broth. If you don't believe me, ask the owner himself. The owners name is Wayne and he is a very respected man in the LV Japanese-American community. 

RAMEN TATSU is unique in the fact that all ingredients are natural/organic style. Wayne uses three different types of natural chicken bones for the broth in his Tokyo style ramen. He also uses three different types of natural pork bones for his Tonkotsu ramen. No other ramen-ya in Las Vegas goes this far out of their way to produce such a rich broth. Many Japanese yelpers express that the reason California(Sawtelle Blvd) ramen is so much better than LV ramen is because the California places use this style of cooking. The cook and owner has been the force behind many of the popular ramen-yas in Los Angeles. He was the man responsible for the recipes which have now achieved notoriety, the same recipes from the LA ramen-yas that attended this years Ramen festival at the Rio Casino. 

The signature dish at RAMEN TATSU is the Shoyu-Tonkotsu fusion. This variation of ramen has become increasingly popular in modern day Japan. It's origins stem from the Kobe area, where it has become a new subregional variation of ramen. On account of the fact that Wayne is from Kobe, he has many years of experience preparing this subregional variation.  The recipe at TATSU remains unchanged from the recipe from Kobe while Monta's Shoyu-Tonkotsu is not the authentic recipe, instead it is merely an invention of the Kurume cook(who is now a Brazilian dude), who mixes his Kyushu broth with a generic nonaffiliated shoyu broth. What I am expressing is that RAMEN TATSU has the only authentic Shoyu-Tonkotsu in LV. And, this is the item you should order during your next visit.  

The Curry- During your next visit at RAMEN TATSU, you should not neglect the Japanese Curry. TATSU uses their own secret recipe which facilities a unique taste which upon my assessment is superior to CoCo Ichinbanya and Kaba Curry. In a demonstration of unique cooking styles, the Chicken broth from the ramen is used as the backing for the curry. Wayne's own particular Gram Masala is then instilled into the broth, and combined with three different types of vegetables. The resulting product is curry that is as addictive as Mr. Zenbayashi's recipe. And during a recent conversation with Mr. Zenbayashi, even he verbally approved of Wayne's recipe. That is a major compliment coming from the man who runs the highest rated Curry-Ya in yelp history. 

They also have Shio Ramen which is great for older Japanese folks. A lot of older Japanese people like my Dad refuse to eat Tonkotsu and Miso Ramen, and eat nothing but Shio. 

I will argue that RAMEN TATSU is the most authentic Japanese Ramen-Ya in America. It remains true to the regional recipes in Japan, and the owner refuses to submit to western pressures to "Americanize" his recipes(as you can see, many of the negative reviews are due to the fact that the recipe is not americanized). For example, Wayne recently terminated contracts with noodle suppliers because he felt they were not completely authentic to Japanese standards. For the last few weeks, several Japanese noodle companies have been competing for the contract, while Wayne assesses and samples them all to determine which is the most appropriate. The whole reason that Tsukemen is no longer on the menu is because Wayne demanded his distributors send noodles which were 100% authentic to the dish and made in Japan. He would not accept anything lower, and would NEVER serve an item that wasn't 100% authentic to the traditional Japanese recipe. Tsukemen will return shortly from my understanding. This establishment represents the Japanese culture very proudly and will not give into the pressures to westernize the menu. This is the reason there is no Togarashi. This is the reason there is no Srirachi. This is the reason why there is no cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon. Just like the owner of Kabuto, Wayne won't breech protocol which was established in Japan by the Japanese, for the Japanese. And I respect him a lot for this. Complaining that there is no  Shichimi Togarashi at a ramen-ya is like bitching to the chef at Kabuto about why there is no California rolls while you soak your chutoro nigiri in a mixture of shoyu and wasabi that you plan on eating with a fork. I have to say that I vouch for RAMEN TATSU and encourage all the Japanese-American residents of LV to support this business. 

Just a final note- The music they play here is the theme music to the Final Fantasy games, and old school anime like Cutey Honey, Candy Candy, and the Miyazaki films

Recommendation:  Take it all off!  Get in the bed nude!  (Stop it.  I'll get back to this).

Note:  This review is for Aria Sky Suites, the hotel within the hotel.

One of only 83 Forbes Five Star and a AAA Five Diamond award winner, Aria Sky Suites is the pinnacle of "rentable"  Vegas experience (once again, stop it).  This is the home of the much talked about Sky Villas.

The experience begins with complimentary airport limo service.  Arrival through a gated, private entrance.  Extends to a private checkin where your daily news paper choices are noted, your personal itinerary discussed (if you used the concierge book shows and make dining reservations - best seats and impossible to get tables included) then  you are swept to your suite.

Suites and villas are contemporary with excellent finishes.   Yes, you will probably play with the kitchen faucet for five minutes before finally figuring out how to turn it on, another five staring at a 5'x5'x2' "cube" and wondering who would want to sit on that until you try it and yet another thirty trying to program your room kicking yourself for telling the bell man you could figure it out on your own.  In the end, high tech and comfortable.

Master bathrooms are massive.  Each bedroom has its own.  Marble and glass throughout, his and her vanities, separate area for the ladies to pretty themselves up, separate tub, steam shower, separate water closet with heated seat and washlet, and full walk in closet with a safe large enough for most full size notebooks..  That little zip-lock bag slowing you down at TSA?  Forget it.  All toiletries are provided.  Teeth too good for Colgate?  Contact the concierge and have whatever you want ordered to your suite.

No worrying about throwing used towels on the floor to be replaced.  If it's used it's changed (including your sheets), not once but twice daily with turndown service.   The bedtime chocolates are wonderful.

Friendly and professional service throughout with no air of snootiness. 

Suites start around $600 per night for high level mLife members.  Book through the mlife.com for the best rates.  You do need to pay the dreaded "resort fee" but for the budget conscious, there is a 24/7 private lounge that provide all the bottled water, juices, soda, coffee, tea, and fruits you want.

Oh yeah, the sleeping naked tip.  Just do it.  Sheets are softer and more inviting than any clothes you probably own.  Turn down the AC and enjoy the cocoon of comfort.

Parents of children with disabilities, this is the museum for you. The staff here are very empathetic and understanding of their behaviors. For example, if you got an autistic kid who verbally stims, the staff won't tell him to be quiet. I'm giving LVNHM a 5-star review just based on how nice the staff is!!!

The admission fee is $10.00 for adults. I know that most yelpers dropped out of school, and $10 is a lot of money to you guys, but maybe cut back on the Yonaka and Snowflake for a couple of days and you can finally save enough money to come here. Hey, you might even lose some weight so you no longer have to take pictures of yourself at those odd angles where they can't see your body. I'm kidding..I'm kidding...Just busting your balls again. But, LVNHM does participate in a program that allows anyone with a BOA debit card in for free twice a month! So you can keep your Taiwanese shaved ice, bring it here to LVNHM, and eat it in front of the animatronic dinosaur. (note- btw I'm an Art of Flavors guy)

I brought the same kid from my review of "Tony's Container Park" here. He liked this place a lot better than Tony's park for 2 particular  reasons: 1st they didn't stigmatize him and accuse him of being one of the homeless children that live downtown. 2nd, there were no hipsters.

At 2pm we get to feed the sharks, and they even got those blind cavefish that can see things through their other senses. There is also a turtle, a big snake, and a scorpion.  And on the bottom floor they got Double Deck Blackjack, 15 slot machines, video poker and a full bar. Yes, bring all your nerdy Asian yelp friends over here, since you guys never understand sarcasm for some reason...

Since Christmas is coming up they decorated this place really  nice. They also put up a bunch of Hanukkah decorations. This is probably the best time to come. 

On weekends they close real early, so please after your next UYE at Poppy Den, skip Johnny Fontanes for one night and don't stay out till 5 am drinking. But, if you do spend all night drinking, remember to drive really fast because it decreases the amount of time you spend on the road, which equals more sleep! I'm a well educated gentleman so take my advice as fact.

Can you say "food coma?"

OMG... I think perhaps I am in a food coma as I type this review... not sure what more I can add that the other 75 reviews haven't covered, but I'll give it a shot!

We went to Lo-Lo's today after the Phoenix 10k.  There was a group of 7 of us total and we arrived around 10:30am.  We were told there would be a 30 minute wait (which was pretty accurate).  Some of us went in and filled up drink cups with Kool Aid, Lemonade, Iced Tea or a combination - the sugar totally held us over!

We studied the menu as we waited so we all knew what we were going to order before we sat down.  Rasheeta was our waitress and she was awesome - there were a few other guys helping her out as well.  I had the "Nay Nay's" which came with 2 waffles, 2 eggs (i ordered them over easy), and grits.  Oh, and I ordered a side of fried okra as well.  (I figured I may as well go all out 'cause who knows when I'll be back).  The waffles and grits had enough butter on them to feed an army of hungry runners.  I also had a bite of Jared's Fried Chicken.  Everything was delicious...

So much for all of the calories burned during the 10k.  Thanks Lo-Lo's for my fix of Southern Food - it reminded me of the good ol' days I spent in Atlanta!  

I'm sure I'm missing some highlights from our meal, but since I was there with a table full of yelpers, hopefully they will fill-in what I missed!

Another fun staycation. I'm just glad it was free! The room was clean and spacious enough for us. We let them know ahead of time that we would need to use the sofa bed and they assured us that it would have a blanket, sheets and pillows, but it didn't. The sofa bed was not comfortable and flimsy. The following morning were able to get room service to set the bed up right. It still wasn't comfy, but at least had sheets and such. The regular bed was comfy and roomy. Room service spoiled me with a bag of yummy caramel popcorn that I couldn't put down. The kitchen area is nice if you bring your own pots, pans, utensils and food! The kitchen was bare. I didn't plan on cooking a meal anyway so found it useless. There is a small stove-top yet no coffee maker? I didn't get that. At least at a "motel" I would have had a coffee maker and coffee/tea packets complimentary. The fridge was stocked, but I didn't get anything from it since it is overpriced. Be careful when opening these fridges because if you even pick something up to look at, the sensor will know and charge your room for it. 

There is a cafe, bar, starbucks and of course room service for food options, but nothing else as far as I could see for dining. At least there are other hotels within City Center to check out dining options at and of course shopping. I can't say I would recommend this place to anyone but if you get the chance to stay here for free, do it!

Welcome to Part II of Dallas G's Improving My Life series.

You may recall in Part I of Improving My Life I reviewed Whole Foods. I talked about how I stopped drinking (haven't had a drink in over a month, which means my Yelps will no longer be funny) and switched from a vegetarian diet to vegan, which is going on about 2 months. I'm even considering a raw food diet. We'll see. 

In Part II, I'm going to be ridiculously effusive about Amen and the Amenzone Primal Workout. 

The deal with human fitness, at least for me, is that you don't realize how far you've let yourself go until you start working out rigorously and discover through pain, but hopefully not injury (be careful!), that you're not 18 anymore. Like many of you, I have several extra ELL BEE ESS's. I'm not obese, but I'm not the lean specimen of lady lust induction I'd like to be... In fact, my problem has been that my life was too good living with a mediocre body. My bird likes a man with a belly. And I still manage to have many wonderful friends despite my paunch. I AM FORTUNE'S FOOL! 

But I realize I'd be happier if I LOVED how I look naked. My sizable head could swell even larger. And most importantly I know I'd feel better because I've been in really good shape once before and it's amazing. 

So here's the meat:

Amen is a HIGHLY charismatic, energetic gentleman who is the creator and 5:30 AM inspiration for me and about 15-30 others of a "primal" workout that involves no weights, no machines, and no B.S. 

We use old tires. We use our bodies. Sandbags. It's intense. It's draining. It's honestly the greatest way you can possibly start your day. Almost every day of the week he offers some kind of training. There is now primal yoga. There are high intensity before and after lunch sessions. You can hire him for some one on one brutality. He has trained professional athletes and yet he's not gonna make you feel like an asshole if you can't physically do something. 

The first session is free. it's $20 for a drop in and if you buy a package it's about $15. So what's your health worth? I highly suggest you check it out. During my first session I had to quit with ten minutes left. It's seriously intense. I've since been able to finish but it's still as challenging as the first time. I've just learned to pace myself. If you are totally out of shape and haven't worked out in years I suggest talking to him about easing your way back into it. 

Seriously, try this. Thank me later.

Convention time.
Twice a year I go to a Safety Convention run by our insurance company. Our group has grown steadily. 10 years ago we were the 7th company to join, today there are 200 companies. Being so big, we need a big place. This years venue the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. 

It's a big hotel, able to accommodate a group like ours (about 150 participants). Our group was the small one. Another group had over 1,000 participants. Yikes. 

The Room:
800 sq ft in area. The beds were comfortable. Bathroom was clean. Living area had a sofa and a work desk. Flat screen TV, mini bar, refrigerator, safe, hair dryer,  iron & ironing board were the amenities they had in the room. All in all, a nice place to relax after a long day of work. 

The Convention:
Big rooms to accommodate us. 
We had breakfast and lunch catered by the hotel. The food was good, but nothing special. 
It is a long long walk to get to the convention area from the hotel. 

The Restaurants
The Rio has quite a few of them. 
They have 2 buffets. The famous Carnival buffet and the Seafood buffet. I've tried both and they are both very good.

Martorano's is an Italian restaurant. We had our group dinner here and food was great. It's served family style so it good for a group. 

They also have a dim sum (KJ Chinese Dim Sum), Indian (Royal India Bistro), seafood (Buzios), breakfast (Hash House A Go Go) & steak (Voo Doo Steak House) restaurants inside the Rio. 

The Casino
All the casino games you expect. They also have a sports book area to bet on games. 

The Rio is off the Strip. They offer 2 free shuttles to their sister casinos on the Strip. One goes to Bally's and the other one goes to Harrah's. There is a return shuttle from both of those casino back to the Rio. It operates every half hour. 

I really enjoyed my time here. 
The convention space was huge. 
The room are nice and clean. 
The restaurant inside the hotel were a plenty. 
The casino area was vibrant and fun. 
A Las Vegas experience indeed.

**Sleek, upscale and reminiscent of the flashy places on Sunset Blvd in West Hollywood, The Cosmopolitan attracts a young crowd and feels much more distinct than the other nearby and new casino/hotel Aria***

I did not stay at The Cosmopolitan hotel, but I did spend a little time in the hotel (including the rooms).  The Cosmopolitan is the new hotel that is adjacent to the CityCenter but not part of it (one of the towers, from the outside, looks similar to the Ritz Carlton at LA Live).

Like Aria (located in the CityCenter), The Cosmopolitan is less themed than other Vegas hotels (like Bellagio, Venetian, Mirage, Paris, and so on).  So if you are not a fan of those themed places, you may like The Cosmopolitan.

I can see how some people would find The Cosmopolitan a little boring when compared to some of the other Vegas casinos.  Luckily, The Cosmopolitan does have a few noticeable advantages over Aria and provides a much more unique experience.

First, the decor is nicer.  Very upscale, sleek and contemporary.  The atmosphere throughout the hotel and the casino floor reminded me of some of the nice and trendy places you may find on Sunset Blvd in West Hollywood.  I felt there was a sense of style and point-of-view with The Cosmopolitan while Aria felt much more sterile.

The Cosmopolitan (which was designed to bring in some residential business) also features bigger rooms with more apartment-like features such as kitchenettes.  All the rooms I went to had balconies, which were nice (haven't seen that on The Strip).  The balconies were also thoughtfully designed to prevent accidents.  Depending on which side of the building your room is located, you may get treated to a great view of Paris, Bellagio and the Bellagio Fountains.

Finally, The Cosmopolitan was bringing in a lot of young people (at least right now).  That might be a plus or negative depending on your life stage.  Place was definitely crowded and hopping.

Several of the restaurants at The Cosmopolitan have locations in L.A. (Scarpetta, Comme Ca and STK).  I think they also have some upscale shopping boutiques, but I did not check them out.

The Cosmopolitan is a nice hotel and it is one I would consider staying at if the price was right.  The balcony is a nice touch and the rooms were also nice.  It also has a great location by being near other big casinos like Bellagio, Caesars Palace and MGM Grand.  And unlike Aria, it is much closer to The Strip.  If I wanted to try one of the newer hotels out (in the CityCenter or near it), I think The Cosmopolitan would be my first choice.

I saw valet parking here.  I am not sure if they also have a parking structure for self-parking.

**breakfast review**

I had absolutely no expectations at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grll, I don't follow his TV persona or his shows. All I know is that he grills and invades peoples' restaurants for a challenge, how freakin' humble..
But I could honestly say this is one of the best breakfast (or actually brunch) places I've had in a very long time!

I started off my brunch with a Spicy Bloody Mary, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=g_DhgA5vwnDyojJ5hAg00Q
Honestly not worth the $9, but I appreciated the unique olive & chile pepper on the side, and the drink didn't taste like straight up tomato juice + vodka, there were a lot of spices in there! 
Warning, it was quite spicy for a morning drink. I thought "Hey~~~ Whatever, I'm in Vegas,"  but boy, did it kick my @ss that morning. 

Their impressive "bread basket" is breakfast alone! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=Sy-fdjtW7Drd-6LBJ-i3ww

You must get the one and only soup Mesa Grill serves, the Grilled Corn Soup. Delicious and the consistency reminded me of soupier porridge, which made me feel warm and homey :*) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=0UI-AK7kH_DvUWgjOce34g

I admit I was regretful while ordering a salmon dish while Mesa is known for Tex Mex, but my Honey Glazed Salmon w/ black bean sauce was amazing. You can request the salmon medium or even medium rare!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=Wz2EFRR4Kt-uZfR6WPjoPg

My girlfriends also ordered other breakfast staples like a Sweet Potato Hash (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=u4pq7PFOPYytWEhfxCxQ0w) and the Jalapeno scrambled eggs with Ham (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg?select=8YIzCO87s62KyKgqNedm5g). I can easily say these dishes were impressively satisfying breakfast dishes, and definitely exceeded my expectations.

BREAKFAST FOOD SUCCESS!

It is really hard to believe that I have yet to write a review of The Lost Leaf. The Lost leaf used to be the place to be. I guess it still is. I love it anyway. Just not on a first Friday. Too many people on that night. I like it on a  Monday when Jiggle or Running from Bears might be playing a little something. Free jazz and there is no cover also. 

You wont find any fruity cocktail or smokey concoctions at this bar. Strictly beer and wine. I think they even have a few taps now. Love the craft selection. They have something for every beer drinker in phoenix. The wine selection is the tits as well. 

They don't serve food though so you should plan on eating before or after or not at all. There are a few good places around the way. And the bar tenders are super appreciative if you bring them tacos... hahaha. I like ending up here as we stroll through downtown Phoenix. Its not too casual but not too... stuffy (?) I guess. I can't find a word for it. But Its different. Its one of those places where you can make new friends and always run into a few old ones! Tells you who my fiends are... :D 

These bar tenders are my favorite though. Not to mention I found my love of craft beers 5/6 years ago at this very bar. So, it will always have a special place in my heart.

Jack Norworth wrote be best sports related song in 1908, coincidentally it was the year the Cub's won their last World Series Championship.  Does anyone remember the "The Baseball Polka"...no just like the 1907 World Series Championship.

Take me out to the ball game

Take me out with the crowd

Buy me some peanuts and Crackerjack

I don't care if I never get back

Let me root...root...root

For the Cubbies(remix version)

If they don't win it's a shame

For it's one...two...three strikes you're out

At the old ball game

Spring training facilities in the last few years in the metro Phoenix area have put out a few new stadiums and none topped the Salt River Fields (Rockies & Diamondbacks) until Cub's Park.  This park has so much seating which is great when you compare it to Hohokam Stadium.  Parking is so much better!  Oh yeah, they have tons of bathrooms.  

I was lucky enough to get a ticket to open day which was also the opening of the park.  I snapped a few photos that are attached to this review.  The stadium is beautiful.  It does have many cues that remind you of Wrigley Field.  If there is one thing that I could tell Tom Ricketts to add to this park, it would be adding a vinyl wrap that looks like a brick wall in the outfield around the advertisement to emulate Wrigley's outfield wall.

Food and Beer, check.  The thing that stood out, no pizza sold inside the park.  My apologies if I missed it.  Most people are pointing out that there is no Old Style sold.   I can go a few hours without to watch a game here.  The food is just the normal stuff you will find at most spring training stadiums.  The one feature that I find way cool is that you will find three food trucks parked on the right field side next to the Dos Gringos tent along with some picnic tables, nice touch!  Chicago deep dish pizza places take note, you could make a killing by just investing in a food truck and getting a spot here!

If you choose to buy a general admission ticket, there are many great views that are standing room if you do not want to tan yourself in the outfield.  Let me say again, tons of seating.  The things that are works in progress are minimal and not worth mentioning and know the Cub's have a winner here.  I hope they use this park for fall ball too.

We came here recently, when a friend bought us a couples massage.  Our most recent visit brought back all my memories of this great Hyatt locale, just minutes from our front door. 

As I've previously noted, with some minor updating: "The rooms here are amazing, as are the guest services. Looking for Spa Day? Well this Hyatt is the place!  Looking for a beautiful sunset dinner by a fire pit?  No question, then you have to come here.  

If you are lucky to be a Diamond Club member, their Regency Club is one of the best in the world.  I would rank this Hyatt alongside Brenner's Park in Baden Baden; the Savoy or Jumeirah Carlton Tower in London for WOW factor. Simply outstanding!  Stay and enjoy the sunsets and Gondola ride after dinner!"

Our couples massage began with a relaxed, tranquil time outside in their shaded portico (photo), sipping cucumber and fruited mineral water, overlooking the Spa's private pool. 

After a few minutes, we were escorted to our room by two massage therapists to select our scented oils. The hour slipped by ever so slowly and was over before we realized it. Wow, they were very professional and made us feel renewed

But that wasn't the end of our visit. Again we returned to the portico and some quiet time by the pool. One of our friends who was also here for a Spa Day soon joined us. We enjoyed some delicious flavored teas for the rest of the afternoon and some good conversation. The shopping in the Hyatt, though small is excellent. 

As noted before, "...we have stayed at this Hyatt Regency many times when we lived elsewhere.  But now that we live in the valley, it has become a fun place to go for dinning (See: Alto Ristorante e Bar and SWB Southwest Bistro)."  

Come, eat, relax, stay, visit; you'll be glad you did!  Five Stars, simply the best!

Enjoy!!

I came by here last week for a one o'clock lunch and was impressed by the quality and taste of their pizza. 

We've been to Crusts a bunch of times and have never made it over to their new quick individual pizza place near the PV Mall. It's actually few doors down from where the old Atomic Comics use to be.

I find MyPie is very similar in setup to Fired Pie on Northsight. http://www.yelp.com/biz/fired-pie-scottsdale#hrid:aWt21x1Kt7IlKg41opmbug  But the taste is better at MyPie in most instances and they excel -- way over the top at customer service. Crazy nice!

I went with the Margherita ($7.49) pizza (photos) with some sweet italian sausage ($1.00).  It was very good, so I ordered a regular one without sausage for home.  That pie wasn't as special as this, but overall slightly better than the one at Fired Pie.

Recently, the WSJ had an article on how Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. has quietly joined a growing group of restaurants aiming to change how we eat pizza. http://m.us.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304403804579264220659257040?ref=/news-lifestyle-arts-entertainment  

My friends in SoCal tell me these are very similar to Pieology: "Pieology prides itself on providing the best tasting, healthiest kustom pizza in the world. Using only the freshest ingredients, Pieology provides smoking hot pizzas in under 5 minutes."  

Whereas, Fired Pie says: "Fired Pie, a fast, casual, rich in flavor customizable pizza and salad made from scratch using fresh ingredients just the way you like it - all at a respectful price."

No matter!  I like My Pie slightly better than Fired Pie, but both are very good.  Expect to pay $10 to $12 for a very tasty individual wood fired pizza.  So Four Stars, and yes I am a Fan.

Enjoy!

Somedays I wonder why I even stay on Yelp. I'm so burnt out on the whole community, and I don't particularly fit in here with the breakdancing asian guys, single moms with inferiority complexes, and gossiping housewives. But, then I come to a place like DOWNTOWN VINTAGE BARBERSHOP on Water Street, and I'm glad Yelp is around to give respect and credit to a barber whose been a master of his craft since the 1960s. Ray is the greatest old school barber I have ever met. He is a man in his 70s, but none of the young guys can compare to him in regards to his ability to hold the straight-razor. 

Usually when I walk into a barbershop, the barber expresses to me that he doesn't like to shave people because it "takes too long". When I asked Ray for a shave he was more than happy, and even told me that he misses the 1960s when everyone who walked into his shop used to ask for one. It was the good old days according to him. 

The most important part of the hot-towel shave experience is the pre-shave preparations. Most rockabilly barber shops rush this process and use a barely warm towel.  Ray spends over 15 minutes during the pre-shave process.  First, he spends a good 5 minutes massaging the hot lather into your beard(Oldschool barbers from the 50s and 60s would do this for up to 10 minutes in order to soften the beard to a point where the hair just literally melts off during the shave).  No other barber in Las Vegas goes this far to satisfy their clients! Ray then puts the hot towel over the lather, to open the pores and further soften the hair. This step is important because it brings the root of the hair to the surface, so that a shadow won't be visible after the shave.  Because this is a REAL pre 1960s-era barbershop, the 2nd shave is not done with lather instead it's done with some type of lotion(another lost art that modern barbers neglect).  

The technique that Ray holds his blade is at the highest elite level.  Because of his pre shave preparations and the fact that his technique is so beautiful, he did not have to use pre-shave oils.   The younger barbers use pre-shave oils to compensate for their lack of technique. Like I mentioned earlier, Ray doesn't use oils because his technique is quite flawless.  I NEVER felt the blade against my skin, and if my eyes were closed I would have never known I was being shaved.

Ray actually administers a real 1960s style shave. The rockabilly places don't do this, they actually administer a modern 14-step shave.  Some of the most notable vintage procedures is that the barber roll slaps the aftershave onto your face, and then they massage your neck. The neck massage is a pre 1970s method used by barbers to loosen up a client who had been laying down for over 30 minutes. The roll-slap was a technique used by WW2 era barbers in America to wake up the skin, it's a long lost art. I particularly enjoyed it though.

After your shave he uses another hot towel to reopen your pores and that's when he applies the menthol rub. Due to your pores being wide open from the hot towel, the menthol gets deep into your skin, and even an hour later you will still be feeling that amazing cooling sensation. After all the hot lather, hot towels, aftershaves, and the razor gliding down your skin, at that moment your skin is going to feel very hot. It's then when he applies the final cold towel that extinguishes the hot sensation. For some reason, the way Ray did this felt amazing and was the perfect ending to an already perfect shave. 

They actually use running hot water to heat up their towels. Now that's REAL OLDSCHOOL! The newer places that claim to be "old school", use those generic hot towel warmers. The barbers here stick to 50s-60s protocol and they go way out of their way to do more than the minimum, they don't ever cut corners!! 

I would rather come here any day of the week over High Roller Barbershop for 3 reasons: no 2 hour wait, A real vintage barber on staff(not a hipster with an ironic mustache pretending to be rockabilly for the $$), and no meth addicts asking for money outside the door. Also, this place ain't just for men to get shaves...I've seen some of your profile pictures and a lot of you chicks have a lot of testosterone. You may also wanna get a shave here as well. Oh and I almost forgot to mention...Thank you Drew and Victoria for putting on this event.

I went here with a group of six and everyone was pretty bombed after a fun afternoon on the strip.  Dinner suggestions popped up, but options got slimmer when a companion meeting us was sporting a Randy "Macho Man" Savage t-shirt.  Giada was undoubtedly out of the question.  Carmine's welcomed us with open arms.  

My jaw dropped as the hostess walked us to our table.  I gawked and commented out loud to no one in particular on the enormous portions at other tables.  Yeah, it's family style, but who's family??  The Brady Brunch with Alice?  Joey Chestnut's family???  The Klumps????  Monstrous plates of pasta were everywhere!!

The spicy wings were a fantastic appetizer.  $32 got us 24 wings, sliced fennel as opposed to celery, and their homemade bleu cheese dip.  Carmine's isn't a typical place to order wings, but these were some of the best I've had in recent memory.  The tomato based sauce had nice spicy kick and went so well with the thick dip.  The fennel grew on me bite after bite as it kind of worked as a palette cleanser.     

Then all the main entrees came out.  Good god!!  The chicken parmigiana had ton of cheese on top and managed not to be dry despite being hammered super thin.  Ragu with meatballs was suggested by our server and he didn't steer us wrong.  I overheard someone else say the meatballs were "tender as fuck".  I agreed.  

The main event was the "Four Pasta Special" which is only available Sundays.  If you have a chance to check out my picture, just look at how small the server's hand/wrist looks compared to the dish.  It looks like a child brought this dish over!  We barely made a dent in it.  I enjoyed lasagna and gnocchi the most.

My wife and I could never eat here by ourselves unless I cleared my car trunk out to make room for the leftovers.  The ones I did have on this particular evening came in a large aluminum buffet pan (no joke) and weighed at least 5 pounds.  If a full on Italian pig out is what you're looking for, look no further.

One, two, three strikes, you're out!

Let's just talk about last night's dinner:  I really wanted to love this place but it just wasn't working out.  Maybe it was the ripe sewer smell as soon as you walk in [Johnny Rockets at Westgate also has this issue] or maybe it was the lack of hot tea on a super cold December evening... I like to attribute it to the fact that they overuse the "orange sauce"  and unagi sauce on EVERYTHING.  

It wasn't just a few artsy swirls of the "orange sauce" and unagi sauce.  They absolutely drench it.  You can dive in with scuba gear!  Maybe I didn't notice that I wasn't ordering a wide array of items but I swear almost everything I saw on the menu had the same sauce combo.  Eating the Firecracker Jalapeos, The Mexican Roll, and The Kamikaze Roll felt and tasted the same to me.  The only real difference between the two rolls was that The Mexican had peppers on top with cooked salmon [yes, cooked] and imitation crab while The Kamikaze had avocado on top with spicy tuna and tempura shrimp inside.  Other than that, it felt like we had three of the same dishes since the sauce was so overwhelming.  Thinking back to it is seriously making me feel a little queasy.

The tacos here are pretty decent and we ended up ordering edamame on the side to help switch up the taste after eating so much orange and unagi sauce.  Like I said, maybe they do have more variety and we didn't see any but I don't think I'll be back to test this theory.  Portions are pretty generous and you can at least ask for easy sauce but it's your poison if you choose to dine here.  Too many great places to eat to just settle for sauce-drenched-everything.  Service here could also be a little better considering when we went, we were just one of three tables.

$27 each [for 2 ppl] including tip for edamame, firecracker jalapeos, two rolls, three tacos, and an iced tea.

John Mull's Meats also does BBQ catering under Road KIll Grill. 2008 Taste & Sounds of Soul Winner.

I ventured downtown to the Taste & Sounds of Soul Friday & Saturday to indulge in some good bbq and soul food.

Friday night was a packed house with long lines and a huge crowd enjoying the entertainment on the main stage at Fitzgerald's.

I walked up & down the tent area of vendors and there was about 8-10 food vendors serving bbw,asian,seafood gumbo,turkey legs,giant cajun shrimp,fried catfish,shrimp and hushpuppies,funnel cakes and lots of pies and cakes.

The lines were outrageous. H&H Bar-B-Q with a big red smoker trailer had a line of 50+ people about 75 yards long the longest by far.

Phat Katz BBQ had 30-40 people waiting. Usually long lines and full parking lots are a sign of excellent food, service,etc.

This would not be the case here.

Road Kill Grill was the 1st stand in the food court and the line was short because it moved rapidly.
I had the 5-bonz/w tips rib dinner w/2 sides for $10-I had mac n cheese and macaroni salad. I also ordered 2 sandwiches-a pulled pork and a beef brisket. SOdas were $1.

The ribs were rub no sauce. Nice smoky taste very tender and very meaty. the tips were the best. juicy and oh so yummy.

The mac n cheese was better than I've found at any storefront BBq and the macaroni salad was great too.

The pork sandwich was great, sauce had a little zip and the bread was very fresh and quite remarkable.

The beef brisket was some of the best I've had could've used a little crust & rub but very juicy & tender. Sauce on the side.

I wish they had a stand at Lowe's or Home Depot or something because this guy knows his BBQ.

If you're in Las Vegas and you're as awesome as I am, please spend an evening at Insert Coins. It sure beats a night out at one of those swanky Las Vegas clubs. 

Let's compare and contrast the two potential experiences.

The Cover at a Swanky Vegas Club: It tends to be free if you're a girl and $20 (or more) if you're a guy. Lame. Those clubs should be paying me for my presence.

The Cover at Insert Coins: It was free for girls and $5 for guys. Sort of lame, but it could be worse. 

The Winner: Insert Coins. It's the lesser of the two evils, which is why I voted for Barack Obama in 2008.

The People at a Swanky Vegas Club: The guys usually have enough gel in their hair to glue together two bowling balls. And they tend to wear tight t-shirts with metallic prints or a dress shirts with really big stripes and maybe a skull on the back. Either fashion choice shows off their steroid influence muscles and fake tans. And yeah, they will say they are 30 and look more like 44.

As for the women, you will usually see them caked with make up, Medusa like hair extensions, one size too tight dresses from Forever 21, and heels they got on sale at Macy's, but are one half size too big. They look sloppy. So they walk around in big groups so they seem more attractive. It's the Sorority Effect. Sure, they look great in a large group. But individually, no one really stands out.

The People at Insert Coints: The guys were in jeans and t-shirts. The girls were in jeans and t-shirts.  I actually felt totally comfortable wearing a Pac-Man t-shirt, jeans, and some Star Wars shoes. And I even got compliments from men and women on my attire. It's just that kind of joint.

Winner: Insert Coins. I'll take a laid back setting over a the Jersey Shore. 

The Entertainment at a Swanky Vegas Club: Some random DJ who is famous for playing music off his MacBook that usually consists of electronic dance music that hasn't changed much since 1995. Sigh.

The Entertainment at Insert Coins: If you're an old school gamer, hit up the old school arcades from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. I showed off my Pac-Man skills, then played some WWF wrestling game where half of the characters were currently dead, and then moved on to some Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat.

You can also play more current video games at the bar such as Madden, FIFA Soccer, and Tekken. And they have lounge sections with an array of choices to sit back, grab some drinks, and play video games with your friends.

In the background, there was some pretty awesome late 80s and early 90s New Jack Swing type music. So people could get up and dance the night away to New Edition and their spin off acts such as Bobby Brown, Ralph Tresvant, and Bell Biv Devoe. Best advice ever: Never trust a big butt and a smile.

Winner: Insert Coins. Duh.

Anyway, if you're in Las Vegas and want a break from the strip, head to Insert Coins. It's the perfect place to sit back, grab a drink, and be awesome.

This Villa Pizza is located inside the food court at Red Rock Station. I would doubt anybody makes a special trip just to eat the pizza here, but it does work out nicely after getting out of a movie for grabbing a quick bite. I wouldn't eat at the chain Villa Pizza for years since I grew up on the locally owned original, but sometimes you have to stop being stubborn which is exactly what I did. 

When I walked by I wasn't sure if I wanted to eat here or at Rubio's, then I saw a fresh cheese pizza come out of the oven and knew that I wanted a slice. The girl behind the counter was nice. A "Cheese Slice" cost $3.79 before tax. For being in a food court and a chain, the pizza was A-OK. I didn't think the price was bad, but I also shared my husbands drink from Panda Express (panda has a decent medium and large size for the price with free refills). Definitely not the best pizza in town, but is decent enough for a quick dinner. They have table and half table/booth seating in the food court area.

First I have to rave about why I love Yelp. Without Yelp, I never would have found out about this place. I never would have went. So a big thank you to Shirley B. for the very helpful info and hooking a sister up.

I made an appointment and was the first of the day. My appointment was scheduled for 10am, however Reina didn't show up until right at 10am and had to set up. She apologized and said they should have scheduled me for 10:20 am and not at 10. She apparently doesn't do the scheduling.

I went with a tint and wax. Reina mapped my brow before she started applying the tint. She asked me which tint I wanted and I explained this was my first time. She suggested a color of dark brown but not ebony and so that is what we went with. The tinting process was easy and not long at all. It gave me a nice color and I was happy with it. It could have lasted a little longer I think, since I feel I don't have much tint now and my visit was a week or so ago. I think I could have went darker and had her leave it on longer. But now I know for next time. 

The job Reina did on my wax was really one of the best I have ever had here in Las Vegas. She didn't over wax and worked with the natural shape of my brows. I have a natural high arch and I have a deep scar in one of my eyebrows and this often throws people off. But Reina did something out of this world. She gave me a shape and didn't make my arch more intense. She instead worked with it and provided me with results I loved. 

I didn't feel rushed in her chair. Reina took her time with me and it was a very nice experience. I will be back. I am okay with paying a slight premium if I know I am paying for good services.

Payment was easy. She gives you a card filled out and you take it to the cashier. Worked for me really especially since I had bought some other items from Ulta and was able to pay all together.

"I must.  I must.  I must INCREASE MY BUST!"

And I squeeezed.  And I flexed.  And I waited.  And I waited...

18 I was (3 years ago...ok fine, 4...and then some), and the twin peaks were like small mounds.  The other girls were wearing big bountiful lacy things and I still hadn't outgrown my sports bra.  They had told me that I must do my exercises.  So exercise I did...religiously.  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3TZB3upHZY )  The only thing the Bust Song and dance ever accomplished was a deflated ego and an increase in my pectoral muscles.  When the realization came that I was gonna need a bro instead of a bra, ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfONNfAjyrc ) the insanity stopped.  Naive much?  Yes.

ENTER:  Gallagher's Steakhouse's beautifully dry aged, bright scarlet, marbled beef displayed in a sealed glass case for all passersby to admire.  It's like that gorgeous girl you had your eyes on but just wanted to look at, not really converse with.  Why?  Because she just didn't taste as good as she looked.  Wait.  I'm still talking about the cow.  Right.

The Signature New York Steak is dry aged for 21 days in order to allow the flavors to seep in.  Although somewhat flavorful, it's rather tough even when served medium rare.  Try it with the accompanied sauces ($3 each).  We liked the Brandied Peppercorn served in a gravy boat.  The peppercorn provides that perfect kick along with the brandy reduction.  

Although the restaurant advertises the signature steaks displayed in their case, it's really nothing more than a good marketing ploy.  The mystery of dry aged beef to be more wonderful in flavor is as appealing as ExtenZe for Men.  In the end, it's nothing more than a stiff wind.

The true star of the evening was the 18 oz Cowboy Ribeye.  Sure, it was bigger than my face, but I rode that cowboy like any good cowgirl would...right into the sunset.  Each bite exploded with flavor.  It was tender, robust, and served with crispy string onions which was the perfect accompaniment.  Service was very attentive and friendly, which earned them an extra star.  Overall, a decent steakhouse though a bit gimmicky.

When Suzanne Somers told me that I could have buns of steel, I took a beating with the Thigh Master.  When the Shake Weight promised to revolutionize the way I tone my arms and shoulders, I ended up looking like I was JACKING. SOMEONE. OFF.  Yes, I fall for gimmicks as much as the guy who bought that Snuggie to free his hands for the remote (as well as "other" activities - notably after popping his ExtenZe pill).  Gallagher's may not have really lived up to the hype, but its marketing genius keeps people like me coming in, in hopes that the product really will deliver.  Every now and then, it's good to keep the hope alive for us infomercial-suckers.

Perhaps one day, I will learn that The Clapper cannot clap off an idiot.

That my ChiaPet will not play fetch.

That I may not "increase my bust" by squeezing my arms across my chest...

But like my breastesses, these hopes and dreams, though late to bloom, would one day become reality...however small and humble.  You just gotta believe...preferably with a Visa or MasterCard ready in hand.

The Cosmopolitan's  "grand social experiment".  It delivers!

Walk in to be greeted by five doors.  Some leading into turn of the century meets Star Trek rooms, others, well...  Spaces morph, the experience evolves, life happens all around you.  Live bands, eclectic music, spontaneous vaudeville acts and a stage production, good food, great craft cocktails.  You need to experience it to understand.

Essentially it's a craft cocktail ultra lounge, stage production, and mega club and restaurant all in one.

Breaking it down:

Craft Cocktails - Excellent, many reinvented, from classics.  Very consistent (a rarity when some cocktails contain 10+ ingredients).

Stage Production (Vegas Nocturne) -  Similar to Absinthe.  Acrobatics, comedy, tap dancing, strip teases. No more details as you are sworn to secrecy.  

Club - Still need to experience this.

Restaurant - Inventive and indulgent.  Many items to be shared like the outstanding caviar mini tacos (Yukon gold shells filled with hamachi and drowned in caviar), deconstructed oysters Rockefeller (fried oysters on a bacon butter sauted spinach and bacon dust in an oyster shell) or the tete de cochon (deep fried panko crusted head cheese topped with a poached egg).

For larger dishes, the reinvented beef Wellington (beef tenderloin with a generous portion of seared foie, trumpet mushrooms, studded with cream spinach, topped with shaved black truffle and crowned by a flaky, latticed puff pastry is very good albeit rich.

Incredible caviar service (five types sold by the ounce, half kilo, kilo).

Outstanding wine and champagne list.  Ultra lounge prices.

Tip;  To make the most of your experience:
1.  Make a night of it.  Drinks, dinner, and the show.
2.  Move through the rooms.  There is something different in each.
3.  Make reservations if you want to eat a full meal.
4.  Purchase your tickets in advance for the show.  Don't skimp.  Pay the $135 for the best seats.
5.  Shows are not the same.  The later you go, the edgier.
6.  Be prepared to spend $$$$.  The show, dinner, and some cocktails averages $300 per person.  Add some caviar and bottles of wine and it's easy to drop several dimes.

Now if only I can remember how Alice got home after falling down the rabbit hole.

I know that some People really love Dr. Wilson. That is why I went to her in the first place. I have tried to wait awhile before reviewing this, so my anger would cool down.

Some people that work in her office are nice. Especially one of her nurses.
I cannot remember her name,but she is older and blonde and perhaps German. She is the best person that works there.
The rest that work there all act as if they are doing you a favor by being there.
The worst is Shannon. She is beyond rude!
I had surgery with Dr. Wilson about 6months ago now. I had the worst treatment of my medical life from this Shannon. Everyone I have ever talked to about this and has had dealings with her has said the same thing.
My pain medication was never discussed just given to me (in prescription). When I asked about not having heavy pain meds, Just perhaps a relaxer. She actually started raising her voice to me and refused to explain anything.

When I did have the surgery, I went to the Piper Center. They were wonderful Thank you Jesus. I do not know what I would of done if everyone had treated me the way I was treated at Dr. Wilson's office.
 After my Surgery, the Dr. did not speak to anyone in my family about it. To say if I was dead or alive, nothing. They were all there in the waiting room.
They saw her sail out the door and never return.
Not only did she not come to see me and check on me in the hospital the next day, she sent no one.
When I asked the nurses when the DR. was coming so I could go home. They said she is not, she does not do it that way.
No one ever came to see me, no one ever called me, or emailed ,or sent a letter, Nothing! I had a serious surgery as well.
My dentist called me the day after a crown to make sure I was alright!

When I went back to her 6 weeks later, I said no one ever came to see me, or call me to see if I was alright. She (the Dr.) said we do not do it like that.
I understand that she is good at what she does, but no bed side manner here at all. Her staff is the same way. 
They treat you as if you are a Welfare case. Which of course I am not, everything was paid for in full.     But, no one should be treated this way for any reason.


Before I was even dressed from the exam, they were in the room preparing it for the next Victim. That happened 2 times! On 2 separate visits! I am not kidding about that at all. Just walked in the room 2 of them with the door open and started getting it ready.


I do not care how good you are, you cannot treat people like this. I would NEVER recommend this office to anyone. You would have better treatment at the VET!

Kings Fish House is a restaurant that I come to quite frequently. I'm not sure if it's commonly known but this particular Kings location serves sushi in addition to seafood. And I am a self proclaimed Sushi Superfan! I come here specifically for the Tuna Poke salad. It's the best I've ever had. Something about it... They make theirs with macadamia nuts, cucumbers, avocado, seaweed and sprouts. It's really spicy and flavorful and like nothing I've ever had before. I'm a Tuna Poke connoisseur and I've traveled all over sampling various Tuna Poke salads. I've even tried to get other places to recreate the one I've experienced at Kings Fish House to no avail. So therefore, I recommend trying it because it is special, but don't blame me if you get hooked too! You've been warned! I've contemplated bribing the chef for the recipe many times and you might not want to be in that boat, plotting and planning like I do. I've actually been putting off writing this review because I knew I'd start thinking about it and have to go satisfy my urge AGAIN. I just can't get enough! I crave it on a regular basis. And sure enough, I was right about my reviewing Kings and thoughts of Poke overtaking my brain. Yep, I'm wanting it in a bad way now. Doh!!!!

Speaking of DOH!!... The other thing I love that is worth mentioning is their Sourdough bread. Amazing, warm, fluffy and yummilicious! Their Oysters, Miso soup & Key Lime pie are all worth a try too.

Service is usually quick. Since I've been so many times, a few of the servers remember what I want so I don't even have to order, which is always nice and makes you feel at home.

Bachi has a breakfast restaurant?! What!! Obsessed with Bachi Burger as it is, and super disappointed by their ramen, I'm glad HLK lives up to the Bachi name. 

My friends and I are fatties and had the Bella farms foie gras de canard (torchon, jelly, marcona almonds, cornichons, cranberry walnut bread) as a starter. Delicious! It has a pretty thick layer of duck fat on top as well. Yeah, as disgusting as you may feel thinking about eating straight up fat, who cares? Spread that stuff on! 

I had the wild mushroom hash (potato, kale, gruyere, egg, fried onions, bechamel) as well as the corned beef hash (potato, brussel sprouts, onion, egg, bechamel) . No, not all too myself, I'm not that much of a fatty. Disappointed a bit, because none of us were asked how we wanted our eggs cooked. On both hashes they came over hard, which I hate. I love runny yolks, don't take that away from me! Especially on a hash. But other than that, they were both delicious. Corned beef had good flavor. 

Friend got the braised short ribs loco modo ( two eggs, fried rice, onion rings, orange lentil gravy). Looked bomb. Meat was tender. Braised for thirty six hours. 

Also tried the crispy sweet chili chicken and waffle (apple bacon, brussel sprouts, green onion waffle, curry butter). Chicken was very moist, and the sauce on it was delicious. Unfortunately they only put it on one of the pieces. Waffle was ok. Butter ess definitely the high point of the waffle. You get three choices of syrups (maple, coconut, blueberry). 

Overall, good experience. Great service. Thanks Adrianna! Definitely a come back spot.

I have been to Marquee a few times already, but this time is THE WORST experience ever. Yeah, the lines are extremely long, the wait is probably 1-2 hours, and it was crowded in the venue...but all this still won't make me as mad and as disappointed...

Basically,  two of my friends and I had a couple drinks at the bar, then we went to the dance floor and started dancing. My friend and I decided to take another shot at the bar...While we were walking to the bar, we got stopped by the security and asked us to follow them. At this point, I thought that, "I guess I am really fucked up and I'm going to get kicked out!"

So we continue to follow the security, which leaded us into a room. Next thing the security in the room yelled at us and said, "Where is the E? Why are you guys selling E?"  The fact that we did not have any E or drugs, my friend and I were really confused. We told them we didn't have any drugs, but the security kept yelling and questioning us and even said that they got us on tape for evidence.

At this point, I was EXTREMELY frustrated and felt very disrespected, so I took all my belongs out from my pocket and told them," Find the fucking E if you can!!!"  Since they couldn't find E or drugs, you would think that they would apologize for the mistake and let us go... HELL to the Fucking No... They said, "Here's the deal: you guys are banned from Marquee, Tao and the Cosmopolitan property forever." Then, they took a picture of us, and released us from the back door... is this a fucking joke?

First of all, your asses did not find any drugs from my friend and I. Second, you guys were even trying to threaten us with all kind of tricks: "We have everything on the tape!" "We will call the police!" and other bullshits as well, to forces us to admit something we did not do! Where is the fucking justice?!

The top two things to like here are the quality and price.  There is definitely some bang for your buck to be had.  Well known spots like McCormick and Schmick's would feature these entrees at much more than these guys charge.  They also offer a discount for LVAC members.  

We started with the "New England Clam Chowder" which was served in a bread bowl with plenty of oyster crackers for some elegant carb on carb action.  The soup was delicious and the clams were plentiful.  This was a steal for $4.50.

I got the "Seared Ahi Tuna" plate which came with a side and cole slaw.  You can see from all the pictures that you get A LOT of tuna for $15.  The tuna was seasoned in Cajun spice and it was terrific.   I paid $1 extra to get another side and opted for the quinoa and kale salad.  The kale salad was great and the mix of strawberries, almonds, carrots, jicama, cranberries and more made me feel like a walking antioxidant afterwards.  I will most likely just order the tuna and kale salad combo next time which is a couple of bucks less but you get the same size tuna and more salad.  

My wife got the salmon with garlic butter sauce.  That sauce was so good that we asked for an extra side of it.  It had the consistency of tartar sauce and was a welcome change.  The salmon was grilled well although the pieces were not as big as the tuna.  

It's definitely a casual atmosphere since you're ordering from the cash register. I imagine they get a lot of take out orders for lunch.  This is another solid choice for lunch if you're leaning towards the healthy side of things....or not since the fried catfish in their pics looks amazing too.  The only thing I felt was missing from dinner was some wine.  Not sure if they plan on serving it in the future.

My newest obsession! I almost don't want to write a review because I want to keep this little spot all to myself. Though the tiny obscure sign helps disguise the restaurant quite well hehe. Look for the small "Noodle Pot" oval next to a looming sign in Chinese. 

This restaurant tastes like...home. I always thought my mother didn't cook any specialty dishes (sorry for hating in the past, mom) but now I realize that everything she made for us was traditional Taiwanese style dishes! Which is exactly what this restaurant sells. You MUST go with the spicy beef noodle soup! The soup is hearty and rich in beef flavor. It is also heavier on the tomato side which some beef noodle soup enthusiasts might not be accustomed to, though it's exactly how my grandma makes it. The noodles they use are perfectly chewy, slightly wavy and neither too thin or thick and the beef chunks are tender and savory. It comes with plenty of baby bok choy and pickled mustard and cilantro. 

For the side dishes I would recommend anything marinated! The cucumbers are garlicky, crunchy and refreshing while the cabbage is deliciously sour and spicy. My mouth is starting to water right now. Another must order is the beef wrap which is a thin green onion egg pancake wrapped around marinated beef slices, cilantro, and what seems like oyster sauce.  BUT THAT'S NOT ALL! You definitely need to order the chili oil wontons too. And all their dumplings are made in house. And finally the green bean (sweet mung bean, not the string variety) drink to top it all off! Noodle Pot is Taiwanese comfort food perfection.

P.S. More waitresses please. That is all.

In the ever evolving world of sandwiches, many claim to produce the best sandwich in the world.  Among the contenders are the likes of Capriotti's, Mendocino Farms, Which Wich? and many more. Among this iconic list of sandwich makers, there are droves of fans and haters alike.
But make no mistake, The Earl of Sandwich makes some of the most addictively good sandwiches i've enjoyed in a very long time! Tack on the competitive prices and it makes it even better! So it's safe to say i'm a fan when it comes to the Earl's cheap & tasty eats!


The Original with Roast Beef - 
The bread was excellent! As soon as I grabbed the warm bag in my hand, I knew I was in for a toasty treat!
The bread was perfectly crisp on the outside yet warm and fluffy on the inside. Not thick, bread-y, dry & spongy like most other places. The roast beef was piled high and it was juicy and full of mouthwatering flavor!

Jerk Chicken Sandwich
Filled with generous portions of chunk grilled chicken breast (not sandwich meat), red peppers and of course a good helping of zippy banana peppers, this zesty lil number was quite flavorful and surprisingly juicy (considering it was chicken breast!) but my favorite has to be the original for overall mmmmmm mmmm mm factor!

Dessert
Brownie Cream Sandwich
Imagine two chocalatey rich brownies sandwiching a decadent layer of sweet vanilla frosting...yup it's insanely rich and sweet! I advise you to purchase a glass of milk with this decadent number cuz you'll definitely need it!

Service was nifty & quick and they got us in and out in no time flat! Don't forget that all toppings are free with the exclusion of avocado, so pile it high if you so desire! And did I mention the prices? Only 6$ for a delicious hot sammie! That's a steal for a great sandwich on the strip I might add!

With that said, it's a no brainer...if you're out after the club looking for some awesome late nite eats or just strolling the strip, give EoS a try, you won't be disappointed!

Happy Eats!

In a city full of displaced Chicagoans longing for their beef, dogs, and deep dish it would seem odd to some that one of the most exciting Windy City imports to Sin City in years has arrived in the form of Japanese Street food but having been lucky enough to attend the soft opening this Saturday suffice it to say that Yusho is poised to buck the trend of "celebrity chef" Strip-side dining.  Owned by Matthias Merges and nothing short of stellar in its Avondale location where service, sourcing, and skills befitting his Michelin starred past found new footing in reinterpreted yakitori, a visit to Yusho at the Monte Carlo begins with the space, a jazzed up version of the original with a long floorplan plus eye-popping colors juxtaposing the gleaming open kitchen and with knowledgeable servers brought in from icons like Savoy and Robuchon without any pomp or pretense the 'experience' unfolds like few others - casually refined and a whole lot of fun, the kitchen and front of house doing each other justice even on day one.  Speaking to the cuisine itself, having already visited the original twice a few selections were made while allowing the kitchen carte blanche otherwise and beginning with pristine oysters each of the eleven courses that followed proved superlative, the signature 2xChicken as good as ever while eggplant, pork shoulder, and crispy duck served with bao all served notice that that Fat Choy is no longer the only game in town.  Surprised by the nutty, acid kissed octopus before being wowed by both the umami-laden wrapped Wagyu and a fluffy okonomiyaki serving up funk and heat tempered by fruit it was finally with a duo of desserts that we concluded and although the softserve remains a worthy staple it was the doughnuts that stole the show, an unexpected lightness from the tofu beneath sophisticated herbal notes and crystallized ginger, just barely sweet.  Admittedly a fan of Chef Merges dating back to a meal partly responsible for stoking my love of fine dining during his tenure at Charlie Trotter's only time will tell whether such a radical departure from the Vegas 'norm' will yield success, but with a great team already in place and a dynamic cocktail menu including several draught options alongside the sort of food this city has not yet seen I know I'll be back soon because whether for drinks, bites, or a full meal Yusho is the sort of restaurant Las Vegas Boulevard needs.

What can I say that hasn't been said. Outstanding burgers, should be enough to say.

Went for lunch Saturday of memorial day weekend. Got there at 2 and the place was pretty full with at 15 minute wait for a party of three. But actually got seated in a booth in 10 minutes.
Service was pretty quick, I'd say within 3 minutes or less after seating. Got the drink orders in right away while we looked over the menu and the build your own configuration sheets.
I ordered the standard deluxe with white American, and their own house burger sauce, done pink. I also ordered the fries instead of the chips which come with.
Jody ordered the bison burger and Linda the Crab Shack.
Jody, who has been around and is hard to please gave his an 8 or 9 out of ten. That's a real complement. Linda said she loved the crab shack. Also we had two shakes, one just plain chocolate shake and Linda had the Espresso Love which sounded great and was except it was just kind of too sweet.

Funny thing happened while we were here when the power went out for a few minutes. Just a little added excitement.

Well we will all be coming back here again to try and work our way through the menu and all the options. This place is highly recommended by usens.

FABU-nothing-LOUS-than-five-stars!!

Palazzo, you were so good to us during our Vegas trip! Let me count the ways...

1. The large suite was SAH-WEET!! 3 LCD TVs in the room (including the bathroom), one for each one of the Three Miss Yelps. Swank and modern decor. Velvet chaise lounges and sofas in our sunken living room for us to chill and use as fun props in our impromptu photo shoots. The beds were so comfortable, and the blackout curtains could have made us sleep until 3pm if some of us didn't have such precise internal clocks.

2. The service was top notch! Our request for extra goodies for our room were accommodated quickly, and a follow up phone call from the concierge was made to make sure we received everything we needed. One of the concierge, Angie, was so sweet and helpful. If it hadn't been for her recommendations, we would have missed out on dining at Okada in Wynn and Koi in Planet Hollywood. The doormen were also all super friendly!

3. The hotel is gorgeous! The newest resort/casino on The Strip, it offers the finest amenities, shopping and dining. Nestled between the fabulous Wynn and Venetian resorts, we were able to walk to each one easily (cabbed it to all other casinos, which is usually $10/way). The pool area is beautiful, and if you rent a cabana, it comes complete with a flat screen TV.

4. The room rates were a steal! Our 2 queen beds suite was a mere $209/night. Although wi-fi was not free, it was only $10/day. 

5. On our final day in Vegas, we decided that I would try my luck at the tables. We scoped out the blackjack tables, and as we were walking by, one of the dealers, Damion, asked us how we were doing. I got a good vibe from him and the rest of the players so I joined in. $15 minimum to play, I dropped down $40. Damion and the other guys at the table were super friendly and fun to play with. They even let me stay in the game when I only had $10 left. The player to my right gave me $15 of his chips to keep me alive when I lost my last chips. I walked away from the table 15 minutes later with $90!! You can call me Lady Luck. ;)

Good, straight forward fish house / steakhouse.  Best of all, you get to dine in a contemporary "pod" in the middle of Crystals (they call it a tree house, either way its cool).  Unfortunately, because of it's mall location, it doesn't feel like a special occasion, destination restaurant rather  "I'm hungry after all YOUR shopping, oh look, a restaurant, let's eat".

With the exception of a few starters and a hand full of mains, you get exactly what the menu says, unadorned. No special sauces, no veg.  Just fish or beef on a plate.  

Portions are large.  Unless you're hungry, pass on the starters.  They are traditional (raw bar, seafood cocktails).  You can get them anywhere.  

Fish is expertly cooked to order.  The thick cut fillet of pan roasted Chilean sea bass and salmon are excellent.  Cooked medium with no sign of albumin (white substance that comes out of fish if the cooking temperature is too high).  Both were moist and naturally oily, exuding their naked fish flavors.  

Good quality prime steaks.  Decent aging.  Good selection of bone in cuts.   Sadly, nothing sets them apart from other quality steakhouses in Vegas.  The bone in fillet is tender, mildly flavored.  No complaints.  

For sides, its gotta be the rich and incredibly flavorful, king crab and truffle dressed gnocchi or the lobster mashed potatoes.  Chunks of lobster enveloped in a buttery mash that explodes with lobster flavor.  I could eat either an a main and be happy!  

Solid wine list.  Vegas resort pricing.

Sometimes "a kiss is just a kiss..."  and that's fine by me.

If you need a spot to get away from it all....look no further!

For a mere $20 (or less with coupons available on various sites) you have access to their facilities where you can relax and detox until they shut off the lights and security drags your naked ass out to the parking lot.  

Paolo D, Regina P, David S and Julie S all give very helpful and detailed reviews on how it'll all go down so you should read them.  I have a few things to add:

- Bring flip flops.  They didn't supply them for me and I walked around barefoot the whole time.  It wasn't bad but I was running out of a couple of the sauna rooms really quickly since the floor was hot.   

- No option for bathing suits.  You will be naked with everyone else.  I am very near sighted so everyone looks like they've been blurred out for public television.

- Be VERY careful when getting into one of the beds in the red clay ball room.  It's like walking on a hundred marbles and the floor is not forgiving.  I wiped out pretty bad and strained my MCL.  My doctor said I'll be fine in a week.  Thanks to all that laughed at me (wife included).  I am going butt in first the next time.  

- The signs say to use each sauna on the 2nd floor for 3-7 minutes.  You can definitely do a little longer than that.  But one guy fell asleep in the red clay ball room (you could hear him snoring) and I am guessing he was in there for a solid hour.  He looked like a total disaster when he came out.  Stay hydrated!

- I never do this but I paid $1 for the 3 minute massage chairs.  There were 2 types.  One was the standard massage which was decent and the other was the "slimming massage chair" which was ridiculous.  The latter just started shaking your butt from left to right, up and down like you were going through terrible airplane turbulence and it also crushed your calves.  Definitely avoid that one.

I know it sounds like I am just complaining but there's a lot to like about Imperial.  The steam rooms are great.  I enjoyed sitting in the sheer heat of the herbal steam room only to jump into the cold tub as soon as I got out.  It felt so refreshing! 

I still think it's a wonderful place that I will be coming back to repeatedly despite my injury.

As soon as you walk into T-Bone Steakhouse you jump in a time machine to a much simpler time.  No frills or thrills just your choice of meats or fish cooked over mesquite.  This is a converted adobe and river rock house from the 1920's.  The whole ambiance of this place is old school western.  If you're over 6'4" you'll need to duck inside some spots of the restaurant!  The views of Phoenix from T-Bone's are beautiful.  The only thing that they did not offer which I wish they did was a tour of the converted house.  This place is so out of the ordinary and a tour would make you want to appreciate the place even more than just for their steaks.  

Your meal comes with cowboy beans served up family style for the table along with a visit to the salad bar.  The salad bar is just like this place, very simple.  You will find the bare minimum but it does the trick.  I understand that they're not a proper salad bar and will not complain.  T-Bone's prices for their meals are on the lower end for what you are served.  Can you find a better steak in Phoenix, yes but not at these prices or backdrop.  A good meal with a good view along with good company is a winner in my book.  Our party has a couple 12oz Boneless Rib Eye Steaks.  These cuts where excellent with very little fat but tons of flavor!  We had a 8 oz Filet Mignon, the only complaint is that it was butterflied but a good cut as well.  We also had a Smoked Bone-In Chicken Breast & 5 oz Filet Mignon combo.  The complaint on this one is that the chicken breast does not say bone-in on the menu.  Our table also shared a very warm brownie with ice cream and whipped cream topped with a cherry that the table raved about.  The complaints from our table are very minimal and will not prevent me from going back.  

Do not attempt to drive in their elevated dirt driveway and parking lot in a lower clearance vehicle.  You feel a bit out of place if you're not on a horse.  I am now a fan of this place and can't wait for a "out of towner" to bring here.  I brought my father in-law who does not require much to be happy, T-Bone's did the trick.

Those who know me will tell you I am one difficult person to impress, a fact that still has my mother wondering where she could have gone wrong. But I promise you I can be impressed, and when it does happen, even I get a little chill up and down my spine. 

If you hope to get my attention, especially with food, you better hit all the right notes at all the same time. From presentation and taste, service and atmosphere, right up to the bite you take out of my wallet, everything needs to fit just perfectly together if you hope to get a rave out of me. You can have the world's best food, but if I have to wait an eternity in line, or drop a small fortune, or suffer miserably apathetic service, then even the world's greatest food can suck.

But when everything you do fits perfectly together; when the food is good and the service is friendly and the price is a bargain, that's when you're doing things right. 

And then there are those rare occasions when all those elements come together, except the food is not simply good it's extraordinary, that's when you're going to start making some serious impressions in my book.

Imagine for me, if you will, a simple bacon cheeseburger. If you are like me, it always has been, and likely always will be, one of life's great guilty pleasures. 

Now imagine that simple bacon cheeseburger: with thick-cut smoked bacon, silky-smooth gruyere, arugula, and perfectly seasoned, grass-fed beef with just a hint of garlic aioli on top. Add all those elements together with the understated genius from The Blind Pig's kitchen and you have a bacon cheeseburger that requires no additional adornment, that challenges the lines of what makes a great burger. If you can imagine that (or better yet, if you can stop by The Blind Pig and try one for yourself) well then you will know firsthand what it takes to impress me - and I can promise you, I am very impressed.

Everybody knows you can get some really great burgers in Vegas these days, but I always find myself walking out wondering whether the extra cost and extra effort were really worth it. I will hold The Blind Pig's $12 "BP Burger" up against any burger in this town and say simply - "beat that!"

Can't wait to try what's next.

XS is nothing short of stunning. This nightclub is aptly named as everything is seriously in excess.

Check out this beautiful picture of the pool. Wow!
http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9wi2sjt7DqxocVEleO-_MQ/l

AMBIANCE - 5
When I first walked in I literally stopped to take everything in and could not close my jaw. The dance floor, bars, and outside area are illuminated by a variety of soft neon and natural lights, there are huge statues everywhere, and there is a huge pool in the center that captures everyone's attention. (especially those who are drunk enough to jump in and get kicked out.) They also have beautiful ladies doing things on stages and poles around the dance floor and near the pool which is erm... always fun. 

COVER -4
Men are usually $30 and women are $20, which is decent for an upscale Vegas club. If you buy tickets from random vendors on the strip, you can get in for about $2-3 bucks a person! My friends and I did this, so we had some "extra money" left over for drinks.

THE BARS - 4
http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RDU9ch-Duz-P05Ik16r_kw/l
Picture of one of the bars ^^^

The bartenders are almost as polite as they are efficient, occasionally smiling during their blitz of drink making. Drinks are expensive but hey, it's Vegas. AMF's are $16 bucks each with shots running a little cheaper. Don't get carried away in all of your fun, it really adds up. (That is why flasks and pre-gaming  were invented!)

THE DANCEFLOOR - 3.5
http://static1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RHyfezuyZdQz5_5xDZo1Cw/l
Picture of the dance floor ^^^

The music was a little off, probably to cater to the diverse crowd. No matter what you like or dislike, you will be unhappy for some time during the night, as the music is played in strange "blocks." They mashed up some weird techno beats for 30 minutes, which we hated, and then transitioned into Nirvana before finally getting into some hip hop club songs for another 30 minutes. The floor itself is CROWDED to the max with energetic patrons mostly in their 20's and early 30's flailing around with the help of some good drinks. Even when the songs are bad, the floor is never clear. Choose a spot and commit, and be sure to have a meeting point, as this club is huuuge and texting on the floor to find your chums is not very effective. 

Overall, I had a great time and ended up going twice. My friends and I will probably go back if we ever return to the City of Sin!

I was here in January for our Yelp Book Club meeting and we decided to have our last meeting of this year at the Martini again.  I came an hour early and had dinner.  

The dining room is small in width but runs the length of the building.  There's a nice wooden wall with some fireplaces that block the dinging room from the bar section and makes a great spot for our book club meetings.

I started with the Caesar salad.  Good dressing with nice croutons.  There was a lot of salad.  It wasn't a starter salad but rather like a dinner salad without meat.

For my main course, I ordered the chicken scaloppine.  While the menu says it's a chicken breast with artichoke, mushrooms, and prosciutto there was no artichoke.  The breast was very lightly breaded and fried and served with seasonal vegetables and risotto.  The dish was very good.  The artichoke would have added some to it, but it stood the way it was very well.

For dessert, how could I resist the deep fried Oreos with ice cream?  Four battered and deep fried Oreos and a martini glass of ice cream.  It was very good, but the Oreos lose something in the deep frying.  The creamy inside got lost with the fried crust of the batter.  If someone should offer me this again, I wouldn't turn them down.

My server was named Princess.  She was very good.  Great personality and good service.  She kept my iced tea filled all during my meal.  

As I was tackling dessert, one of our club members arrived and we were soon discussion our book about living in a Mumbai slum.  I felt somewhat guilty.

Omakase!!
I'm a fan of Chef Nobu and I've been dreaming of dining at one of his restaurant some day. Well tonight was the night

I got a seat at the sushi bar. 
A great way to see the action up front and personal. 

I went with the Omakase (Chef's Choice)
13 cold dishes
3 hot dishes
Desserts

Here's the rundown:
Cold dishes:
Nobu Tako w/ Jalapeo Sauce - a great way to start things off. 

Toro Tartare - Wow, melts in your mouth goodness. 

Toro, Big Eye Tuna, Abalone, Tamago, Scallop w/ Fresh Pickled Ginger - this was the nigiri part of the meal. Every thing was great. Fresh, clean tasting sushi. Yum!!

Amaebi w/ Uni, Egg Custard & Snapper - the shrimp and Uni was ridiculously good. Egg custard was so creamy and tasty. The anapper had a yuzu sauce that was so good (and I don't usually like yuzu)

Xxx salad, Amberjack,  xxxxx - I didn't get the names on the last 3 cold dishes, but they were all good. 

Hot dishes. 
Grilled Diver Sea Scallop w/ Tomato Sauce & Chive Oil - Scallops were perfectly cooked, but that sauce was AMAZING!!

Wagyu Beef w/ Garlic Butter & Brussels Sprouts. OMG!  Melts in your mouth goodness. PERFECT!!

Ramen w/ Crab and Vinaigrette Broth. A nice dish to finish the meal. 

Dessert:
Sudachi Cream, Merengue, Hazelnut and Black Sesame Ice Cream - a Napoleon (sideways). That sudachi (Japanese Citrus) cream was delicious. Hazelnut provided the crunch. A thin chocolate sheet provided the sweetness. That black sesame ice cream is the BEST ice cream I've had in a long long time. It was creamy, not too sweet and the sesame flavor shines through. I highly recommend it. 

Service was SUPERB!
From start to finish, I was pampered. 

For me, one of my dining dreams come true and it lived up to everything I imagined it to be. 

My Rating:
5 Star Plus!! 
Try it for yourself and decide.

Easily one of my favorite hotels in Vegas.  I highly recommend this place to all of my friends and family who visit.  Here's why:

- Great selection of rooms.  You really have 3 choices of rooms & service here.....Mandalay Bay has mid-level rooms/service, THEhotel has great rooms/service, and the Four Seasons has excellent rooms/service.  The giant 2 bedroom suite at the end of the towers of Mandalay Bay are my favorite.

- Parking is easy.  The self parking and valet parking here is so easy.  The parking garage at the rear of the property has easy access from Frank Sinatra drive or Mandalay Bay Dr.  For locals or tourists it's an easy in/out.

- Great selection of restaurant choices.  From high end restaurants to cheap eats, there's something for everyone....and it's good food too.

- Lots of bars and lounges.  Everyone can find a place to have a drink and enjoy themselves.....from hipsters to regular joe's, there's something for everyone.

- Decent limits on table games.  You can find $10 min bet blackjack here on occasion.  There's also a good selection of slots and other table games.

- The vibe here is awesome.  I can't explain it, but I always feel good here.  The people and the vibe are always energizing.

- Great entertainment.  The House of Blues and the Mandalay Events Center always has great entertainers in their lineup.

- Walkway to Luxor.  If you want a different experience, you can easily walk to the Luxor via a connecting mall area without going outside.  This is huge during the sweltering Summer months.

Overall, this place has a little bit of everything for everyone....and they do it well.

Will I return?  You bet I will!

I know, I know, this is a brand new steakhouse in Vegas and I probably committed every faux pas in the book by ordering the fish. But I did it. And I don't regret it for a minute.

FOOD:
---------
As our group asked for my opinion on appetizers, I knew I had to select the **Smoked Pork Terrine** because it offered the sublime foie gras, of which I have been deprived for ages, being a Californian and all. Combined with delicious pickled figs and pepper jelly atop a piece of bread, this appetizer was everything I wanted and more.

I was a little worried that choosing the **Roasted Market Fish** would be a total mistake, but it was delicious! It turned out to be Sea Bass with a tomato paste and zucchini relish. The bass was prepared perfectly, being sufficiently firm while also smoothly melting in the mouth. This would rival any bass from an acclaimed seafood restaurant. I sampled a piece of Anna's **Porterhouse** and it was divine. I would definitely order it on my next visit.

For side dishes we got the roasted mushrooms, asparagus, creamless sweet creamed corn. We all thought the asparagus could have used some more flavoring or some sort of creative twist, but the corn was a huge hit with its buttery smoothness.

SERVICE / AMBIANCE:
-------------------------------
Absolutely outstanding. Every member of the staff we encountered was on point, very warm and helpful, and extremely professional. Our server had an entertaining sense of humor. Even the busser impressed us with his refined gestures.

The decor is mod and clean with beautiful wood accents everywhere. The open kitchen in the back is a nice touch.

Of course you get what you pay for, so be ready to lay down some cash. For four people (3 steaks, 1 fish, 3 sides, 4 drinks), we each fronted about $100.

DATE TIP: With swankified dining at its best,
How could your date not be impressed?

I like to bring red heads here. I don't know why it works out this way it just does. I think red heads really suit The Parlor. Alright, alright, alright.

The actual restaurant is pretty awesome. Brick and wood and overall hipness. Great place to impress a date or just have a bite with a friend (I have done both I know.)

The food is super good. I have been a Harley's fan for awhile but have to admit this place picks up the red sauce slack. The food has always been fresh with the right amount of parsley for that fresh taste. The pizza isn't the best in town but it would make the top 10 list. They make the pasta themselves and it is delicious. Even the sea food pasta (I don't speak Italian but whatever it was called) was awesome and we are in a land-locked state. The salads are pretty amazing as well.

*****LISTEN UP OWNERS*****
I am actually giving The Parlor 5-stars but holding one hostage. Why would you take the mushroom risotto out for a sweet corn one?! I haven't tried the corn yet and I am sure it is super fantastic but Virgin Mary mother of god , the mushroom one was soooo good. If you ever want to see your beloved 5th star from me you will bring it back. This is no joke. If I do not hear back in 5 days I will begin mailing you pieces of the star, but it will not end up on this review. Do it! Do it now!

My son in law & daughter treated myself and his mom to a Mom's night out down at the Celebrity Theater.  Now this review isn't about the show we saw, but more on the venue. 

I have lived in the valley for 13 years and never knew this place existed, crazy right?

We arrived an hour early so we went down into the club area and son in law & I had some drinks, this is a cool little waiting spot, it did fill up quickly, but didn't feel over crowded. 

Then the doors opened, and I have to say, I enjoyed the set up, we were only 6 rows back from the stage, but after looking around I can't honestly say there isn't a bad seat in the house, and this is a smaller more intimate venue where the stage turns, so everyone can get a great view.  

The seats were comfortable, the show was great. I truly enjoyed my night out with them! Definitely will be checking the event calendar to see what acts/shows will be coming because I don't mind going back!

New look.  New menu.  Same vibe.

Updated contemporary dcor in a dining space where line of sight for celebrity sightings is as important as the LED mood lighting.  High energy, loud, for the young and young at heart.  Quality steaks but, "not your daddy's steakhouse".    

The new menu sees the addition of dry aged beef,  contemporary cuts and steakhouse staples such as a  beautiful braised short rib and a classic 3lb lobster thermidor.

Starters fail to impress.  Secondary to conversation or an after thought kickin it with your buds, the flavors are correct, the presentation OK, no WOW factor.  The fried rock shrimp OK.  Perfectly cooked but the accompanying lemon aioli increases the oily mouth feel.  The lobster pot stickers with bok choy, shitake mushrooms and a chile ginger soy sauce, not memorable.  The king crab and gruyere stuffed shrooms, a tasty bite but the cheese masks the sweetness of the crab.

The steaks.  All USDA prime, wet aged (except he 35 and 50 day dry aged rib eyes), very well trimmed.  Excellent sear.  Even cooking.  Accurate temp.  Standard cuts are, well standard.  Great bone in fillet and porterhouse.  The 35 day dry aged rib steak is tender, and pleasantly nutty with hints of cheesy aroma and a wafting umame finish.  The 50 day, meltingly tender with a pronounced bleu cheese aroma.  Some funkiness at the edges, not for everyone.  The standout, "Barry's Steak".  A simple grilled rib cap.  Tender, packed with flavor.  Served with complementing cipollini onions and shishito peppers.

For entrees, the "Kobe" short rib is excellent.  Not true Kobe beef but, perfectly braised, not stringy, finished with a horseradish crust served with curried root veg and a Cabernet sauce, the earthy flavors marry well.  The lobster thermidor, a classic in every respect.  At three pounds, massive, with firm but still juicy meat enveloped in cream and cheese.  Simply put, good eats.

For sides, the creamed corn, adds a great sweetness to any steak.  The broccoli and cauliflower gratin with a cheddar cheese sauce complements the dry aged steaks umame finish.  The highly touted lobster mashed potato is good but far to rich as a side dish to steaks.  It steals the show.

Very good service.  Steakhouse proper despite the cool vibe of the place.  Very good wine list.  Vegas resort prices.

A steakhouse that understands what not having "Las Vegas Blvd" in its address means.  Translated:  it's less expensive, omits baller ingredients but manages to keep the vibe of the Palms.

My friend and I came here during Memorial Day Weekend. We came during the transition between brunch to dinner time (but we paid dinner prices) so it was really nice to be able to eat a bit of everything. 

I remember thinking it was a very decent price for a Vegas Buffet... but then I was not too impressed when it came down to the food. 

I just gathered a bit of everything to take *a bite* and the only thing that I really enjoyed was the lobster mac and cheese, shrimp cocktail & crab legs!! After the experimental plates, I just filled up on the expensive stuff to get my money's worth!! 

I also wanted to try the prime rib, but my friend said her slice was over cooked even though she asked for a medium/medium-rare cut. I saw all of the meats and it DID look too over cooked so I passed on the prime rib. What a disappointment... 

I was especially unsatisfied with their dessert selection... I gathered all the pretty desserts that would fit on a plate: macaroons, eclairs, tarts and a chocolate covered strawberry... but it was all so mediocre... Most items only got one bite from me. I took a double taste on the flan, but I was still not impressed. The only dessert I finished was this Cappuccino shooter (minus the whipped cream on top).

Don't get fooled by the Trio of fries!!!

If i see a fries sampler, i always want to get all of them. It said on the menu- waffle fries, steak fries and petit fries. You would think petit fries would be shoestrings (a neighbor made the same mistake), but they were just mini waffle fries. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=F4NLspbB1o4xetDmIEKmXQ. You're better off just ordering two different kinds. We ended up too full and not even finishing half of the trio order. Good to share though between 4 people or more. 

I got the signature burger Le Paris. Comes with brie, caramelized onions and bacon. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=5ZAFIRT5zqm6FeTlTH-9zg Tony got the Le Blue http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw?select=t3WtvkSrPOn7tGN-TZwrLw with blue cheese, avo and bacon. 
The burgers were decent, but at 12 bucks each, i wanted Uhmaaazzing and they were not. The hefty burger patty was perfectly round and flattened, but i like my hamburger kind of mishapen so you get those nice charred marks around the edges. 

Service was friendly, everything tasted ok, but i wasn't wowed enough to add to my vegas favorites.

Oh Twin Peaks... These girls were not hired for skill. It's almost like they were too air headed for Hooters so try were hired here. Ok I get the theme. And I must say that's pretty cute, great concept. But this is a local spot meaning the slutty outfits arent gong to excuse your lack of skill and knowledge for long . Here are two conversations that actually happened last night...

First Bartender- hi! Welcome to ..... Twin Peaks .she obviously forgot what the place was called.  
Me- hello I'll take a scotch and soda with a twist
Bartender- I don't know if we have that
She stands and stares at me
Me- ok could you possibly check?
She leaves and comes back 5 minutes later
Bartender- what kind of soda do you want
Me- just soda water
Bartender- oh like sparkling water?
Me- that would be great
She leaves comes back after talking to every bartender there
Bartender- I'm sorry we don't have lemon twists
Me- do you have a lemon wedge?
Bartender umm let me check
...is this real life...
She comes back with a lime wedge and a bourbon and water. I figured that was close enough so I head over to the table to join my group. (i was the late arrival since I was coming from work and I figured going to the bar to get a drink would have been faster since my bf informed me of their slow service at the table)

My second conversation was with our waitress.

Waitress- can I get you any drinks?
Me- do you by chance have Pinot Noir here?
I knew it was a long shot but I figured there had to be at least one red wine here
Waitress- ummm 
Me- pinot noir is a red wine
Waitress- ohh! No, all we have is canyon red. 
Me- that's a red wine?
Waitress- yea that's what the bottle says
Me- ok I'll take a glass please.
We waited about 10 minutes and the waitress came back to tell me a manager had to "get the bottle open" so it would be right out.
Don't order wine here btw, words can't describe how disgusting it is.


Bartenders that don't know what scotch or a lemon twist is. A waitress that didn't know there are more then one type of red wine and a whole restaurant that doesn't know how to open a bottle of wine. Good luck Twin Peaks... Good luck. 

Btw what's up with the random girls walking around to give out "free hugs" I wonder what they'll put on their resume for future jobs. 
Skills: friendly, outgoing, great hugger 

Smh Smh Smh Smh Smh ok now I'm dizzy.

Stopped by to check out the place and ask if the ice cream flavors were made with corn syrup (yes).  However, the nice man, whose name is Terry, took the time to tell me about their products, and I became very interested in their custom-roasted beans from Miscela d'Oro.  Terry kindly obliged to let me sample a "cortadito," http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/petersens-old-fashion-ice-cream-scottsdale-2?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA#tmGvi9oRu0JNOri3JpKT7w a taste of cortado, a single espresso mixed with (sweetened) milk.  Now, I usually drink my coffee black, preferring to glean calories off of sweet pastries, pancakes, and waffles instead, so I was glad that Terry had not told me that he was going to add the sweet milk-- I most likely would've skipped it!  The cortadito was a beauty to look at and so velvety and luscious, that I savored each and every sip.  After a delightful chat, I continued on to visit a favorite coffee shop nearby and the second of three breakfast stops for sweets.  An hour or two later, I walked back to Petersen's to buy a cup of drip coffee to help me finish off a few more sweet bites.

I'm definitely coming back to have a cortado!  (And maybe buy a chocolate-dipped waffle cone to complement.)

Playful interpretation of comfort food and innovative craft cocktails served in a bizarre turn of the century brothel meets postmodern industrial  Sci-Fi steam punk dining space.

To be clear, I'm not a fan of the Disneyesque dcor which makes you the thing that looks out of place.

The Boiler Room is a craft cocktail lounge meaning, it's not the beer, neat scotch, or wine kind of place.  Complex, new creations and reinvented, turn of the century cocktails containing multiple liquors, house made infusions, and oils dominate the unique drink offerings.   Tried a few, won't go into them individually, suffice it to say, they are excellent.   It's like drinking a dish.  You can taste the evolving flavor on the palate even after the sip is long gone.  Impressive.

The food hit the mark.  The "Bacon Wrapped Bacon-N-Egg", quirky, difficult to eat but once you stuff it in your mouth, it's like breakfast in a big bite.  Sitting on a piece of toasted brioche is a bacon wraps a cube of pork belly topped with a fried quail egg, tomato jam and guacamole.

The shrimp corndogs, not bad.  Sweet corndog batter coating slightly over cooked jumbo shrimp topped with a vibrant cilantro aioli.  Good flavor, a little excessive on the aioli that leaves a greasy feel in the mouth.

The smoked gravlax are excellent.  Cucumbers, fresh dill, red onion and pieces of gravlax (cured salmon) are placed in a dish with a dome filled with hardwood smoke.  Sensory dining as the smoke tickles your nose before you taste the mild bitterness it has imparted throughout the entire dish.  Excellent texture, just plain fun.

Finally, "Squid-E-Os with Spicy Merguez Meatballs".  A surprise from a disturbing sounding dish.  Tender cooked squid rings sit atop a squid ink / tomato sauce whose oceanic flavor is counter balanced by spicy, earthy meat balls.  It works and is good eats.

Servers are well trained and friendly.  No problems when describing the unusual offerings.

Keep an open mind.  Experiment.  Well worth a visit.

The Trump Hotel is a great crash pad when you're in Vegas. It being a holiday weekend, most resort/casinos on the strip were priced pretty high. However, I was able to find a great deal at Trump on Expedia for $109/night. 

We got a great room on the 57th floor facing the strip. The rooms are nicely appointed. All rooms have two doors to get through so you are away from the hallway and it's extremely quiet. There is a kitchenette that is fully stocked with a stove, microwave, fridge, toaster, blender, utensils, pots, pans, plates, pasta strainer, martini shaker and more. You can cook all your meals right inside your room, but there really isn't a grocery store nearby, so it's pretty unlikely that you will. Each room has a comfy king bed and a sofa bed so you can sleep up to 4. The bathroom has a huge jacuzzi tub and separate shower, and a tv right in the mirror. There is plenty of closet space. And there's also free wi-fi.

The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and you'll receive top notch service as you would expect from a luxury hotel. And that's all it really is. It is NOT a resort/casino. There are only two restaurants, one bar, a pool, spa and gift shop. Which means you'll be spending most of your time being entertained at other places. While it's located across the street from Encore/Wynn and next to the mall, it is set back from the strip, and you will end up taking taxis everywhere you go. So, on one hand, it's nice that you don't have to walk 20 minutes through a casino to get to your room, but if you're there to gamble, this is not the hotel for you.

4 stars for the value and the great customer service. Plus, they allowed early check-in and late check-out. But if you want to go all out, I'd suggest Palazzo or Encore.

My boyfriend summed up our experience at Coup Des Tartes pretty well, even with the spelling and grammar issues - I swear he's college educated; he just thinks it's 'kool' to 'right' in his own unique style :)

I'm just going to add my own two cents...
After reading so many great reviews of this place, we were both pretty excited to try it out.  I made our reservations online with no problem.  As he said, going on a Wednesday night was perfect - it was not too crowded and we received great service. Claire and Mona took great care of us... great ambiance and food too - To start, I went with the Roquefort Salad (their signature salad) and it was delicious! Jared was happy with his mussels appetizer as well.  They brought plenty of bread and butter for him to sop up the sauce as well - it too was fresh, moist, and yummy. Jared had the chicken entree and I had the lobster... I really enjoyed it - the lobster itself was flavorful and it also had a light sweet sauce (with coconut) that enhanced each bite.  I liked that it came with asparagus as well as a risotto.  I didn't love that the risotto had pineapple in it, but that may be just me.  We didn't need it but J twisted my arm to share a dessert... chocolate crusted cheesecake with an orange sauce and fresh berries - the perfect sweet ending to a wonderful meal!

If you like quaint, unique, local places, check out Coup Des Tartes - you won't be disappointed!

It had been over a decade since I last stayed at the MGM.  Came here during Yelps Spring break and was hoping to get into one of the newly renovated rooms but I ended up in the regular ones.  It was the same weekend as the Billboard Music award.  Too bad I didn't see any celebs.

We got the first room right off the elevator.  I was thinking it was going to be noisy with all the peeps coming and going and the up and down of the elevator but it was actually pretty quite.  The 2 queens size beds were comfortable and the room spacious enough for 2 people.  Big bathroom with plenty of counter space for all the hair and makeup stuff.  

On the evening of the 2nd day we were surprised with a special delivery of champagne and sweets.  We almost made the guy leave stating to him that we didn't order anything LOL.  Well he got our names right and it was a little something from the hotel to welcome us.  

Im not very picky when it comes to hotel accommodations.  As I don't tend to spend much time in the hotel room.  As long as it had a comfortable bed, a TV, nice size shower with good water pressure Im happy.  That said the one thing I was disappointed about was the WiFi.  It was struggling a bit.

Local ~ On the Strip
Room ~ 2 Queen beds and on the 18th floor.
Stay ~ Clean and comfortable.
Extras ~ WiFi struggled a bit.

Let me preface this with the crucial fact that I have not yet been to Hakkasan. But let me follow with two words that explain this 1 star rating: customer service. 

Everyone working in this industry should know and value the importance of customer service, especially in Las Vegas. People travel from all parts of the world to enjoy an extravagant weekend in the one&only Sin City. So to be mistreated, disrespected, and borderline harassed before even starting a vacation is unacceptable. 

Let me explain. 

I go to Vegas a lot. And I know a wonderful promoter who always hooks it up. She doesn't work for Hakkasan, so we went through a different promoter that my friend got the number for. Dan. He told us that our guys would have to pay - and that's fine. We understood, but didn't want to go to Hakkasan and pay over going to XS for free. 

The text my friend sent was incredibly polite: 

"hi sorry I think we're gonna pass cause we can get the guys into the other clubs for free. thanks anyway tho! I'll text you in the future :)"

Among other things, he responded with this:

"Ur gonna favor free & have an experience prob bad because we dominate sundays vs. having time of your life which is ur coming to Vegas." 

"whoever u talking to is miss leading you" because XS charging is "commonly known"

and repeatedly said that Hakkasan was the #1 club in the country. 

1) No need to put down other clubs or the fact that our guys don't want to pay
2) Don't tell us we won't have fun unless we come to your club
3) It's not all about being voted number 1 by a magazine, it's about customer service and relations and in the few months that Hakkasan has been open, they can't even beat a subpar tier 3 Vegas club on Yelp - that's probably due to poor customer service.

If this club expects to compete with XS, Marquee, & Surrender once the hype has died down, they should reevaluate how they treat potential guests at their club. 

I still plan on going to Hakkasan and I do look forward to seeing what all the hype is about. I believe that the owner of the club and those working have put a lot of hard work into making a new and exciting atmosphere for EDM lovers. But until I see for myself, my only impression of the club is through our interactions with the club's promoter - whose role is to represent and "promote" the club. Instead, his aggressive assertion of Hakkasan's superiority to all other clubs in Vegas and condescending response at our polite refusal of his offer left a bad taste in my mouth.

Probably my mother's favorite place for siu laap!  Since she lives in Glendale, I'm often asked to be the delivery gal to bring her roasted duck, boiled chicken with the head still on, and roasted pork whenever she needs to do some Chinese ceremonial tradition.  If it's not me she's forcing to do the grunt work, it's one of her co-workers.  Regardless, even if it's on the east side, it will always show up to Mommy W. fresh!

I first came across this place when my friend invited us out for dinner.  It seemed to have all your Americanized and authentic foods.  Service can be a bit of a wait but it's definitely worth your time.  Kudos to the chef for making such amazing flavorful food.  Prices are reasonable and the place is clean.  I haven't tried any of their lunch specials but my friend says they're pretty decent.  They make a delicious Mussels with Black Bean Sauce and their Salt & Pepper Shrimp is pretty amazing as well.  And there's nothing like some rice soup [aka porridge] when you want something warm.  It's the Asian chicken noodle soup [comfort food].  I stick with either the pork with the century egg or the fish fillet porridge.  Momma W. makes it best but Best Hong Kong Dining is a close second.  

The only reason why I don't frequent here as often as I should is because parking is always a pain.  There are some other eateries and a grocery store in this strip plaza so parking can be pretty sketchy.  You know us Asian drivers.  Look out!  :P

Umiya is my current go-to spot for AYCE. Its pretty, modern looking and well-decorated. High ceilings, good lighting, and a screen playing music videos of everything from Rihanna to Girls Generation. Everything you want in a sushi spot! *kidding*

I usually only order nigiri + appetizers. They have nice cuts of fish which so far, have always been fresh. Rice is solid. However, if you're a roll person, my friend ordered a few which were pretty delicious. Their appetizer menu is larger than most. I would say it's comparable to that of OYSHI. My favorites being the spicy garlic edamame and spicy tuna crispy rice. 

Service has always been up to par. The servers are generally friendly and attentive. It's never so crazy busy in there that you feel as though you're ignored and can't put an order in.

Note: Last call is at 1:30am. No AYCE after 1:00am, just a la carte. They also have a sushi chef which has a THUG LIFE tattoo. Because that is absolutely relevant.

We ended up at the airport with a few hours to kill, and wanted to have a decent meal at a sitdown restaurant, versus a fast-paced sandwich shop.  We were in the C Terminal, and Zinc looked like the best option.  The menu was pricey, but that wasn't completely surprising being in an airport and our expectations of the food quality.  Unfortunately, we were wrong.

The French onion soup was a good version, but for $14 it needed to be better than just good.  And that was the highlight of the meal.  The steak frites were a complete let down.  It consisted of a flat iron steak, served medium rare.  I guess you have to pay extra for flavor, because it had none.  And the steak itself was so tough and full of fat that it was difficult to chew.  The frites were basically frozen shoestring fries, loaded up with some kind of red seasoning that was also flavorless.  The only thing that made the food passable was an orange sauce that accompanied the steak.  I'm not quite sure what it was, and it wasn't that great, but it was the most flavorful component of the entire meal.

I would go one star based on the food alone, but the service was good and it was one of the only places in the terminal where you could sit back and relax, and not feel rushed.  Just plan on eating somewhere else first, and maybe hitting Zinc for a couple of cocktails and skipping the food.

***Aria is very generic, but the rooms (especially the bigger ones) are comfortable and very nice; it also has a good location, but you really have to walk to get to The Strip***

Aria is one of the new very tall hotels at City Center in Las Vegas.  Here is a rundown on the pros and cons (a pleasant experience overall).

Pros:

--Nice rooms.  Contemporary, clean and comfortable.

--Location.  City Center is near a lot of the action (with casinos like Caesars and Bellagio closeby).

--Lots of places to eat in the hotel.

--Because of its newness, the smoke smell is less strong.  Still, I feel Bellagio and Wynn are better at clearing out the smoke.

--A different option.  Not as "theme-like" as other casinos.  This could be a pro or con depending on how you feel about those "theme-like" casinos, but at least it provides an option for those who are looking for something else.

--The interior/decor of the hotel/casino (like the rooms) are modern and sleek.

--The exterior is pleasant to look at and all glass (very similar to the Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott at LA Live).

Cons:

--While Aria is located on the Strip, it is a little bit of a walk to get down to the sidewalk to visit other casinos.  I like walking in Vegas, but this may be a con if you are not wearing comfortable shoes (or need to get somewhere quick by foot).

--The rooms are small.

--I think their rates are a little higher than other serviceable hotels nearby.

--I only tried one food place (Cafe Vettro) and it was not good.

--While this place is a different option, the lack of a theme or style gives the hotel kind of a too simple feel.  Once again, good or bad depending on your perspective.

I haven't stayed at many hotels in Vegas so it is hard for me to rank Aria, but my experience at Aria was pleasant overall.  Since Aria is near a lot of casinos I like, I would come back, but I would do so only if I got a good deal.

Note: They have little packaged accessories (such as an iPod auxiliary cable and charger) next to nuts and candies on the counter.  These are obviously things (expensive things) you can buy (like the minibar).  The items are weight sensored so if you pick one of them up, the hotel automatically charges your room.  So you lift it, you bought it.

They will take it off your credit card if you picked it up to just get a better look.

Trivia: Aria was featured on a recent episode of ABC's The Bachelorette.

We order the 20" cheese pizza for $14.11 last night for dinner and thought it was very good.

Giant Rustic Pizza is located in the Safeway shopping area, next to after school learning center Kumon and Leslie Pool supplies.  This is a take-out only store that has seating outside.  Besides selling whole and half pies, Giant Rustic sells by the slice, along with salads and artisan breads.  The latter is mainly for the lunch crowd, but it seems to have attracted some of the parents waiting for their kids at Kumon.

The pizza is a very large twenty inch pie that is tasty.  The smaller 14" pies are called Large.  Although it is a thin crust, the bread is very chewy.  Our family of three thought is was a little too chewy, but that is a matter of taste. The dough they use seems above average, while the pizza sauce was not seasoned very much.  The light dusting of cheese on top was just enough to cover the pie.

Compared to the other pizza places within a few miles of this location, Giant Rustic's is closer to NYPD, than Ray's or Corleone's in terms of style.  NYPD tends to be chewier of the three.

We liked the pizza and all the energy and extras the new owners bring.  The prices seem in line -- somewhat less than Ray's and NYPD; but more than Corleone's for a similar sized pizzas. As I've mentioned, the 20" Giant Rustic Pizza is $12.95, while the 14" Large Rustic Pizza is $8.95. Additional toppings are $1.75 each for the Giant and $2.50 each for the Large. All prices are before AZ sales tax.

Giant Rustic also serves sandwiches that are made with their Artisan bread for $7.95.  They include Chipotle Turkey Slaw, BMT, Tuscan Veggie and Italian Bird (Turkey).

In the case next to the counter, they sell Giant Salads for $8.95, with names like Sonoran Chicken, Mediterranean, Italian Kitchen, California Dreamin and The All American. They all looked good, so I'll be back at some point for lunch.  So Three Stars, "A-OK".

Alice Cooper'stown is directly across the street from the US Airways Center (home to the Phoenix Suns.)  When I first visited the restaurant, the Suns were putting their finishing moves on the Utah Jazz (84-87), and I suppose it was due to the game that business that evening was slow.  However, for me, it didn't matter.  Besides paying respect to Mr. Cooper, an episode of "Man vs Food" wherein Adam Richman and Alice--the shock-rocking legend himself--attack 22"-long "Big Unit" hotdogs was motivation enough: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C86akA3G6rg.

The "Big Unit"--smothered in "Nightmare" Chili, bacon, cheese sauce, sauerkraut, jalapeos, diced tomatoes and onions, sweet relish, and shredded cheddar--is jaw-dropping!  In fact, upon delievery, fire alarms--shrilling throughout the restaurant--direct full attention to this behemoth as it snakes its way toward its next victim: me.  Respectfully named after the now-retired, 6'10" Arizona Diamondback, Randy "The Big Unit" Johnson, this dog headlines.  At $19.99, it seems a bit steep, but I couldn't eat more than a third.  Along with the fries, it easily feeds two or three.  Divided, the cost is more than reasonable.

The "Elaine Benes" Big Salad, the "Johnny 'Beef' Depp", the "Al McCoy" ["The Voice of the Suns" since 1972] Crispy Chicken Salad, the "John O'Hurley" ["Seinfeld's" J. Peterman] Buffalo Chicken Wrap: the menu items definitely hail celebrity.  But why not?  The fare--along this guitar-lined, autograph-infused, rock-n-roll museum--is meant to be fun.  And it is.  Even though, on this evening, the locals were instead supporting their beloved Suns, I had a great time with my friends.  Cooper'stown is worth a try.

I will say that it's an interesting touch that the servers and bartenders should adopt the Cooper-esque eye make-up--it's cool--but our server wasn't enthused: his bother-me-not attitude and poor service had me questioning his allegiance.  I mean, you work at Cooper'stown!  I know that between two servers and four tables, feeling as though you're in the weeds at times is natural, but couldn't you at least "feign" appreciation and interest?  The manager, however, checked-in on us, refilled our drinks, and asked about our visit.  I think he's quite aware.


Note to Mr. Cooper:  

When I was a kid, Alice Cooper album covers completely unnerved--yet intrigued--me.  I was ten, and I remember visiting our neighbors--hard rockers to the core--who had many of your LP's resting against their metal-plated, knob-heavy component stereo system in their living room.  I would walk around their house pretending I was cool and ignoring--or at least attempting to ignore--your nightmare: I couldn't look you in the eye.  At Cooper'stown, however, upon the slightest chance that you might drop in, I'd kept an eye out...just in case!  I'm not afraid anymore...I don't think.   =]   Nevertheless, for your music, your vision, and your endeavors, I'm a fan.  And I thank you.

Hmm, where do I put Jinya... That's the million dollar question. But after careful consideration, I believe 4 stars is accurate.
This is probably my toughest place to review, so bear with me...

First time I was here, I ordered the tonkatsu assuri, their cheapest ramen at 7.90. I thought the flavor was ok, but it didn't blow me away. My friend ordered a veggie ramen, he said that he liked it a lot, but I thought that was ok.

I came next during their HH and sampled the world renowned Jinya bun and crispy chicken, aka karage. Things were starting to look up!! The Jinya bun is a pork belly bao, and probably ranks up there with Wendy's ribeye bao. It's grilled with a delicate BBQ sauce, and it is extremely tender, and the fat is nice and melty. It's a little pricy at 3.00 during HH. The karage is a great deal during HH. This isn't your normal, popcorn chicken sized crispy chicken. These are 5 large hunks of chicken, that are super crispy and moist!! So good! I do have regrets of not ordering the quinoa salad that a neighboring table ordered, it looked very appetizing.

On my last visit, I was feeling full from a late lunch so I decided to get something small so I ordered the small pork chashu bowl. The best part of this bowl was the rice, it was perfectly cooked. I was disappointed in the pork chashu. It looked like the leftover bits from the Jinya bun meat. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great, there wasn't a lot of fat on it, but it wasn't dry. Overall, I thought it was kinda bland.

The service here is really good. They really do a good job of taking care of you. The ambiance is really great, especially the large communal table in the center. I don't know if this would be my go to ramen spot, especially with so many unique ramen spots in town, but it has a great vibe and would be a fun hangout spot with friends.

Regardless of where you are on Saturday, this is definitely the place to be on Sunday! Well, for brunch that is.

From the relaxing views of the well manicured gardens to the elegant dining atmosphere, no detail is overlooked at this posh "English tea party" inspired restaurant. 

The brew here is eye opening and the OJ is freshly squeezed. Small details IMO that make the dining experience that much more enjoyable. In this day and age, we all know little things do mean a lot!

In regards to the brunch fare, I was pleasantly surprised with both the quality and flavor. You can tell the execution was performed with distinction & care.

Although the white chocolate French toast was the claim to fame here, I was hooked by the pictures of fluffy blueberry pancakes on my iPhone Yelp app. Suffice it to say, I was not disappointed at all. It was as fluffy and soft as I expected. I would have preferred more fresh blueberries, but with all things considered,  it was still quite a treat. Especially when I drizzled a generous amount of that warm maple syrup on top and watched it cascade down each thick layer of divine, doughy goodness!

However, the highlight of the meal had to be the Duck Croque Madame. I'd even venture out to say that it's the single best thing I've ever had for brunch thus far in Vegas! Topped with a fried egg (now how can that be wrong?!) this French sandwich was packed with mouthwatering deliciousness!  From the perfectly tender morsels of duck that tasted like it was slow roasted for hours, to the melted Gruyere and caramelized onions (reminiscent of a french onion soup), it was like a virtual foodgasm in my mouth!

So there ya have it, pleasant atmosphere, beautiful views, and incredibly good food.  What more could you ask for? That's right, seconds!

Happy Eats!

I'm just not into this place anymore. I was so stoked when it was being built and even after it opened I was a weekly regular. With nearby options like Burger King and McDonald's, I was excited to have a place that would be different and have a variety of menu options. The online ordering is pretty much useless. I place my order online because it is supposed to be convenient yet I still end up most of the time waiting in my car and having to go inside and get my food only to find out it isn't even ready. I have no issues with going inside and ordering something and waiting for it, but when a place offers online ordering so that you don't have to do those things and cut down on wait time and can't get it right it becomes useless. Then when I finally get my food it is overcooked. This wasn't an issue when they first opened however maybe because they are expanding around town too fast consistency is an issue. This last time my Omelet was yet again crispy and brown (overcooked) and hubbys breakfast burrito tasted awful (we used to eat these a couple times a week) and the tortilla was hard and the pancakes had a burnt flavor. The potatoes that came with my breakfast were dry and clearly came from a frozen bag. A lot of people think this is a "healthy" only food establishment... Wrong! After too many failed attempts... I give up!

If you are looking for an Hollywood vibe this the place to be. The Chandelier is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino.  If you looking for an upscale place in Las Vegas you just found it. The place is worth visiting. 


This bar is just like the rest of the Cosmopolitan, very blingy, I don't usually like that sort of thing but I must admit the chandelier bar was pretty unique. They have got the ambience and lighting just right here, great atmosphere, lots of little nooks and crannies with tables in over 3 different levels.

We went here on 2 different nights for a drink, good quality cocktails, a couple of different ones I haven't seen before, if you want an old classic that isn't on the menu they will do it for you too. Even though it was quite busy we still managed to get seats every night, service was a little slow at times.

The food here is good and this location seems to be improving with each moving van, dropping off new residents to the former bankrupt Desert Ridge North area. While real estate sales have gone from non-existent at this north Phoenix area, to white hot over the past twelve months. Go figure 

We love everything on the menu, including the appetizers like the soft pretzels, the meatballs (I'll return to this in a minute), their pizza selections are tasty and they also have an extensive beer list.  To top it off, their Happy Hour has most drinks marked 50% off!  So all good, right?  Well maybe. 

As we said, we like the Mellow Mushroom. But on our most recent visit, it was m'eh at best. The big negative for us was the afore mentioned meatballs. 

Sadly, they weren't even half cooked. The plate was ice cold, the marinara sauce was cold, meatballs(photo) were luke warm but pre-cooked, and the mozzarella inside was not melted and also cold. Ugh. 

I've decided to average out my rating to Three Stars, because we like the place and they normally do a nice job. 

So yes, we'll be back. But, they need to get their act together.

Maybe ramen really is the new pizza!  It's kind of mind blowing how I was dying for just one legit ramen joint in Las Vegas only a few years back and now I could do a week straight without going to the same spot.  I'd also have to chug 500 gallons of water during said week but still....

I was looking for a basic, no frills ramen and their "Tonkotsu Assari" fit that bill perfectly.  Our server also mentioned it was his favorite.  Assari consisted of pork broth, chashu, green onion, egg and bean sprouts, but the thick noodles were the clincher for me.  Most of Jinya's ramen offerings come with thin noodles which I am usually not down with although I didn't ask if they would substitute.  

It's a good thing they put me at a corner table since I slurped my face off.  From top to bottom, it was solid through and through.  There is better chashu to be had in town, but this was still a nice bowl of satisfaction.  I'd also skip the salad (dressing was gross) plus gyoza add-on and opt for another tapas dish instead.  

To my knowledge, Jinya is also the first and only spot in Vegas to do takoyaki the right way.  I've had so many awful versions of it since moving from Japan that I had given up hope.  I was delirious after my first bite!  The light crunch, generous chunks of octopus with its signature sauce, mayonnaise and dried bonito flakes put my taste buds on another planet.  It was a terrific dish that I will be having multiple times in the future.  Love that they're open until 3am!!  

Good call with giving only the ladies the nice Toto toilet.  :P

We are usually big fans of the foodie flavors that come out of Fox Concepts, but felt this one fell a little short for us.

True Food Kitchen is the brain-child of Dr. Andrew Weil and Sam Fox. Their two-fold mission is that every dish served must not only be delicious but must also promote the diner's well-being. Our palates were somewhat uninspired by the offerings

True Foods is also showcasing proper proportions and the benefits of an anti-inflammatory food pyramid diet of Dr Weil. The only problem is the menu prices need to go on a diet too.  Everything is tasty, but a tad pricey

Our introduction might have also been tempered by the amateurish hostess station, which seemed more interested in having a conversation with a girlfriend friend who stopped by, rather then sitting the customers.  We watched in amusement until our turn came. LOL  

Our server was a bit spacey too.  She was MIA for long stretches of time during our meal and was only bailed out by the other servers.

We tried the Spaghetti Squash (photo) with a "protein" of Chicken Sausage and the Teriyaki (photo) with a "protein" of chicken with brown rice. BTW, "protein" is True Kitchen's favorite add on noun.  

As for our meal, we found the squash was overwhelmed by it's spaghetti sauce, which was mildly spicy which we liked.  Though we really enjoyed the chicken sausage "protein".  As for the the Teriyaki it was somewhat bland and overwhelmed by the brown rice.  Hard to believe.  We did enjoy the Pomegranate Limeaide (photo) and the Honey Ice Teas.

Expect to pay around $30 per person, including one non alcoholic drink.  Our return factor is less than twenty percent.  Sorry.

SITEREP:
If you've been following along in the newspapers, Fox Restaurant Concepts made national headlines in February 2012, when PF Chang's acquired a 51 percent stake in True Foods after providing a initial $10 million in start up costs back in 2009.  http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2009/08/10/daily51.html
http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/morning_call/2012/02/pf-changs-buying-majority-stake-in.html

They are showcasing a cookbook from Dr. Weil and chef Michael Stebner which includes more than 125 original recipes.  On the menu you will find Spring Salad with Aged Provolone, Curried Cauliflower Soup, Corn-Ricotta Ravioli, Spicy Shrimp and Asian Noodles, Bison Umami Burgers, Chocolate Icebox Tart, and Pomegranate Martini and much more.

Wow.  Everyone is right-this place really is a dive.  Stained seats, trash on the floor, and is that bird poop on the screen?  Maybe I should have washed my car first.  Seriously, maybe Scottsdale 6 is a dive, but what would make for a "nice" drive-in?  Aren't they all the same?

Then there's the complaints about the sound system.  Are you kidding me?  Compared to the days of hanging a speaker off your window, listening to the movie through your FM radio is like the most advanced sound system in the universe.  

I hadn't been to the drive in since the late 70's, as a child of course, and not a lot has changed...except the price.  $6.25 for a double feature, and new movies to boot!  I didn't visit the snack bar as we brought our own freshly popped corn with a touch of sea salt and a little butter..mmm.  I also didn't visit the bathrooms because I still have some degree of bladder control.    

My complaints...total train wreck getting in.  Double-sided ticket booths with only one attendant working both sides.  Cash only when it's quicker to swipe a card than make change.  Since the first showing for all movies is 7:45, it might be better to have the lanes correspond to the movie you're seeing with overhead signs identifying the radio station and the screen number.  As it is, the attendants have to go through all that with you as well as directions to your screen.

I would also suggest if you want to check the movies online you don't use the website listed here, it only gives you the times of each movie--not which movies are paired on the same screen.  Instead, use http://www.movietickets.com/house_detail.asp?house_id=3998

I like that I can zone in and out of the movie and ask my husband to explain it to me without disturbing anyone, even if he doesn't.  I like that I can recline my seat, and not have my knees buckle under when I get up after 2 hours of sitting in the same position.  I like that I don't need a payday loan to buy a Coke.  And I like that I could go to the movies with a cough!  This little conversation was a bonus:

Me:  Are you watching HANNAH MONTANA? (on another screen)
Him:  No.
Me:  You're looking over there.
Him:  I was just looking around.
Me:  I can't wait to post this in my Yelp review.
Him:  You better not, I was just looking around.
Me:  Okay, I won't.

I can't wait to go again!

Finally!! 

I've had the Charcoal Room on my list of eats since I moved out here a few years ago.  My neighbor, some co-workers, and even friends/family from California even recommended the Charcoal Room to me. But when it came to other Yelpers, most haven't been here or reviewed them.  The Charcoal Room has a lot of pros and very little cons.  You don't get what you pay for here, you get more.  And if you're having steak, you get a lot more.  I got their petite filet and it was delicious.  Their petite is about 6 oz, juicy, and most importantly, very tasty. Don't let the price fool you.  For less than $30, I had a steak that rivals some of the 5 star steak houses out here.  My filet was so tender that I think I used a butter knife to cut through it.  I had my steak with a side of their Caesar salad, lobster corn chowder, sauted mushrooms, and asparagus.  All portions were huge and I ended up with leftovers. My GF opted for their roasted chicken and baked sweet potato.  Her meal was hooked up too.  I swear she was served half a chicken and a football sized sweet potato.  She said her meal was good as well.  

I have no complaints about the service.  We were seated right away, our orders were taken, and our food was served in a timely manner.  I left the Charcoal Room very satisfied and my only regret is not coming here sooner.  We got a lot of food and paid less than $100 for it.  Yes...I'm sure I will be back.


PS: No pictures of their steak and no pictures of their fabulous forks.  I was focused the night I ate here....focused on my beautiful date.  1OAK!

Better than a food court but not by much.

Part of a growing chain (18 restaurants in 11 states).  It's not fancy.  No build your own anything.  Make a "concept" selection, choose either burger, chicken, or turkey.  For beef burgers, choose a doneness level.  Opt for plain or "crunchified" (silly addition of chips in the sandwich).  Done.

The dcor looks like a burger exploded.  Ketchup red, mustard yellow, golden bun, grilled beef brown.

Burgers are cooked to order, relatively juicy, decent beef flavor but grossly under seasoned.  Not good for mild burgers but welcome for spicy creations which are SPICY.  Toppings are fresh.  The Philadelphia Burger (provolone, griddled onions and hot peppers) packs a spicy punch but is good eats.  The LA burger (avocado, watercress, tomato and cheddar cheese) is so mild the burger is lost.

Definitely NOT a fan of the "crunchified" burgers.  The addition of chips adds a distracting textural contrast and nothing to the taste.  

Simple sides.  The beer battered onion rings best of the bunch.  Fries just OK.  Soggy at times.  The mayo, roasted red pepper, chipotle sauce it's served with is spicy and flavorful.  The sweet potato fries with honey mustard horseradish sauce is a better choice.

Very good, rich milk shake with pronounced flavors (the pistachio is worthy!)

Excellent service.

Overall, inexpensive for the Strip but not worth the pilgrimage or the wait.  This is Vegas.  X times the money does equal X times the pleasure.

I absolutely despise feeling like I've been judged not worth someone's time due to their assumptions about my financial status based on my outward appearance.
And this time it wasn't even by a girl in a G-String on a pole!

Okay, so anyone who reads my reviews knows I'm not regularly dining high on the hog, but don't the beautiful rich people slum around in workout gear sometimes, too?

So after a recent run down Central Ave, one of my K9's and I decided to partake in a little of the awesome concept Donald S calls RETOXIFYING.  A little snack and some wine out on the patio sounded great to me, so I went over to Bomberos.

It was early in the day, so they weren't at all busy, there were only a couple of other customers either inside or out.  I walked in and out between the patio and the inside seating area several times over a few moments, purposefully contorting my face into the restaurant patron's "where do I go?" look.  Since the server's work station and door to the kitchen area were in that narrow hallway, I actually was in the way of the couple of servers who were there trying to move to and from the two dining areas.

I did not get greeted at all, either before or after I had to stop one of them and ask for a menu. 

I sat and reviewed the menu for a several minutes, all the while continuing my confused, helpless patron routine.

Nothing.

With nary a peep out of the servers, I walked away.

My tendency to frequent $ instead of $$$$ places comes less from a lack of means than it does from my countless experiences that what you get for your $$$$ is often not worth it.  
If I have a 2* experience at a $ restaurant, I may be a little upset, but if I have a 2* experience at a $$$$ establishment, I'm going to be postally pioughd.

Bomberos may treat you like one of the Sunnyslope Elite, if you show up looking like you are one of the Sunnyslope Elite.  Maybe then their overpriced wine and admittedly tasty looking nosh might seem worth it.  (It IS all from South America)  Without friendly or at least minimally cordial customer service, they can stuff it up their stuffy butts.

I ended up stopping at a nasty dirty nearby Sonic (limited options due to the dog, remember) where both the order-taking electronic voice and the rollerskate-less carhop both had the decency to ask me how I was doing that day.

Mom and I stopped in to my favorite breakfast joint on the way to the airport.  I decided to try something I haven't tried before, so I went with the Peanut Butter & Cream Cheese stuffed French Toast w/Bananas.

After a short wait, our oder came out.....their portions are enough to feed two people!  I wish they offered a 1/2 order.  Oh well, I did my best to finish this thing, but it proved to be too much for me.  The combination of Peanut Butter and Cream Cheese was awesome!  It was so good I didn't need any Syrup or Butter added to it.

I like the Monte Carlo. It's usually cheaper than the surrounding hotels and the staff have always been super friendly.

Now, it's not the Bellagio- but it's definitely not the Circus Circus. You can get a good Vegas experience in the heart of the strip without breaking the bank. I also like that it's walking distance from the other hotels, so hopping from place to place isn't an issue.

The rooms are clean, but again, no-frills. For us, we don't spend too much time in the room, we usually wander around, shop, gamble and eat. We're not the club type, so having one in the hotel is definitely not a priority.

The casino has the usual slots and tables- but it's not my favorite place to gamble. I prefer heading to the old Vegas where minimums are between $2 and $5. If you go during the week here, they have them, but you're usually playing by yourself. I prefer playing with a crowded table- I think it makes it more exciting (for Blackjack at least...)

Valet is sometimes a little bit of a pain- especially around check-out time for hotel guests. We've waited 45-minutes for our car. After being hungover and tired, that is the last thing you want to do. Yes, it's free. But it's much quicker to just park in the structure and do a quick little hike to get out faster.

Now, I haven't tried the restaurants on property- however, it looks like they aren't favored by a lot of Yelpers. I usually stick to the binging of buffets to fulfill my hunger.

Tip: Check the website and Vegas.com frequently as rates can change drastically from one day to the next.

Shout out to Nelson Q for having a good eye and letting me know this business opened today! I got myself down here about 30 minutes after the heads up.. Dedicated!

I arrived expecting this to be the chain that's based out of Hawaii. Unfortunately, this is independently owned, and not at all like the Bale that I'm used to back home, but that's where my disappointment ends. The owner, seeing my sad expression enthusiastically told me that it's much better than the place I was looking for. That's a lot to live up to, since I have childhood memories of pate banh mi.

I came knowing I was going to order a pate sandwich, but didn't see it on the menu. Upon asking, they told me they could make me a pate sandwich and asked if I wanted it with or without butter. I opted for no butter, letting the pate do it's own rich thing.

The sandwich was huge and only $2! Not sure if this is regular pricing or grand opening pricing seeing as all the other banh mi are $3.45- which, on it's own, is pretty competitive for Vegas.
The bread is crusty and crisp on the outside while light and buttery on the inside- perfect! Way better than Mr. Sandwich and on par with Dakao. The vegetables were just right and cut the richness from the smear of chicken pate which was actually minimally applied. The cilantro provided that herbal kick that I love so dearly. Jalapeos for heat. Sriracha because.. Well.. It's Sriracha, and every table is equipped with it. Based on the bread and veggies alone, this is a major banh mi contender on the LV China Town strip.

They offer a lot of soups and deli items as well, though the sandwich was just right for me and I was unable to bring myself to sample anything else.

And nice plus was the hot jasmine tea they brought me when I sat down, brewed just right and not bitter. 

Update!: after speaking with the owner, he also owns Dakao up the road, but he says he likes the bread better here because they have a different oven. =)

Don't tell anyone Christopher. But I have a serious crush on you and your elegant eatery and your fabulous Crush Lounge. This could rival my Scott Baio crush in the 70s. Or my crush on arrugula, beet and goat cheese salad in the 80s. Or even my 90s crush, yep, again, Scott Baio. 

We were greeted by a lovely host person who gave us the 411 on our dining options. We chose the restaurant kitchen bar which had happy hour prices on food and drink. No sooner had Rickie and I bucked up to the bar did we have our server take our drink order: two iced teas and a large flat water. Soon to follow was some delicious pillowy yet crunchy French bread with a ramekin of soft buttah!

While we waited for our food it was most entertaining watching the kitchen staff prepare for what was sure to be a very busy Valentine's weekend. And since I was already with my Valentine, I was most happy. 

We had a delicious cheese plate with herbed chevre, Manchego, Pecorino Romano and a mild cheese I won't even try to spell. I had a crispy, creamy pizza with goat cheese, roasted garlic and oven dried tomatoes. Very good though I kept thinking of my favorite flat bread delight at St. Francis. Hmmm...Rickie had a burger he enjoyed though the top bun was very doughy and not pleasant to eat. Yam fries were tasty though a dipping sauce would have been fun. All that was only $36!

Now. Is it just me but does every new restaurant try to out do the next guy with the jazziest bathroom sinks? Well, I'd have to say, Christopher's takes home the gold. A huge communal sink with a wall in front of you that shoots out water below as you rub your hands over hundreds of little rocks. Enjoyable! 

And now in the 2000s I have a new crush. And it's a sink. Sorry Scott. 

OMG...I think I just finished my 400th review! Cheers my yelpitas!

I came across this place on yelp and wanted to check it out. We used to have some Hostess outlets in the NW part of town (since closed) that I liked and was hoping to find something similar to that in this place. I found much more than I expected! Walking in I was greeted by a friendly cashier who asked if I had been in before. When I told her I hadn't, she went over the different sections and said to ask if I had any questions. They mostly have Entenmann's, Oroweat, Thomas, Grandma Sycamore's and Sara Lee goods, but they also have other stuff like Bear Creek soup and Boboli pizza crusts. I got a loaf of Sun Maid cinnamon raisin bread for just $1.75 and Texas Toast for the same price. Bagels were $1.99 and I picked out some pizza crusts, english muffins and other pastries. The prices here are drastically lower compared to buying these items at the grocery store. Not even Walmart has a "rollback" like this! 

When I got to the register I was given a stamp card. You get a punch for every dollar you spend. Once the card is full you can get a free item by the brand listed on the card. For every $9 spent you also get to pick something free (changes everyday) from the premium section near the front door. I also received a $1 coupon to bring back towards my total purchase for a future visit and the cashier told me I can combine them! The $1 coupons can only be used during the month on them so make sure to pay attention to that. You get a $1 off coupon for every $8 you spend.The cashier said what is sold here isn't leftover stale stuff from the grocery stores like most people think. She says Bimbo is the largest bread supplier and the stuff sold here is leftovers, but fresh leftovers that grocery stores, etc. had no shelf room for. Nothing I purchased was past a "sell by" date and was soft and fresh. This bakery outlet isn't anywhere near where I live, but I work in the area once a week and will make a point to stop and load up on delicious savings.

A theater where I can recline in my chair with my feet up and watch a movie? I'm in! The ticket price for adults is $11 per person plus a $1 convenience fee when purchasing online. You get to pick your seats which I thought was nice. The website is user friendly and once you have picked your seats (hurry because if you wait too long to decide someone else can snatch the seats) and completed your purchase, the seats are reserved for you, so you wont need to worry about getting to the theater in time to get a certain seat or seats together with your group.

Inside they have the typical concession area with popcorn, soda, candy, nachos, etc., but they also have a sausage bar and sell beer and wine. There are separate lines for the concession and sausage/alcohol bar, but the employee at the sausage bar let me get my nachos and soda combo ($12) at her line so we could just pay with one transaction. She was courteous and let me know that customers get free soda refills on the date on the receipt. 

We saw "The Lego Movie" and I was happy with the plush reclining seats. I made myself fast at home in mine! Each chair has a button on the side to adjust the seat however you want it. I liked that when I moved mine it wasn't felt by the person next to me so I didn't feel bad about adjusting it whenever I wanted. The table attached was decent sized too. The screen was huge and the movie looked good. I just about fell asleep I was so comfy! 

There is a parking garage (free parking) or a open lot. If you plan to go to the movies often, you might want to consider signing up for Galaxy Rewards, it's free.

Now let's sing!

This is another long overdue review that I've been needing to write in a bad way. I actually feel guilty keeping this information all to myself for so long! This place couldn't be more deserving of a fantastic review from yours truly.

I come to Spa Mio mostly for blowouts but I've had massages and facials done here as well. I like that I don't even need to request a specific person as I know when I'm coming to Spa Mio, everyone that works here does a great job! It's a rare thing for me to be able to say that about a salon/spa. The fact that all of their hairdressers/therapists are talented saves me time and headaches because then I don't have to work around a specific person's schedule and can just book in right away. Whomever does their hiring is on it! In addition to being great at what they do, all of the people that work here are nice and friendly and always a pleasure to deal with. I've never had a bad experience and I've been coming here a lot and for a long time, as you can see from my number of checkins listed above.

They offer discounts for locals which is awesome! They also have a shop in the front where you can buy hair and skincare products, flat irons & other styling tools, bath bombs, even cute jewelry. Come a little early so that you can have a look.

Without hesitation, I can recommend Spa Mio to all of my fellow Yelpers. They also offer many other services here including nails (which I have not tried yet) but I can assume their employees are on par with the rest since they're always busy. For more information on all they have to offer visit:

I usually only eat Papa Murphy's once or twice a year, but when I do, I enjoy it. I already knew what I wanted when I walked in. In the past, when they have a special promotion going on they have some already made in their cooler to keep the long lines down. This time though my pizza was made fresh right in front of me. I asked for a "Heart Shaped Pizza" priced at $7 and included 1 topping (additional toppings extra). For an additional $6, I added "Cheesy Bread" and "Cookie Dough" to complete the meal. 

Different types of pizza here take different times to cook. I had the original crust so it needed to be baked at 425 for about 12 minutes. The pizza came out nice and tasted good. I baked the cheesy bread at 400 for about 10 minutes and it was pretty good for what it was. If you are going to buy frozen pizza at the store, you might as well come here and get something you can customize for about the same price and it tastes better. The pizza and cheesy bread are baked on the trays they come on, but they do offer instructions if you would prefer the pizza to be baked on your pizza stone or grill. The cookie dough comes in a tub and you bake in on your own sheet. I baked the cookies at 375 for about 10 minutes.

They also offer stuffed pizzas and at home pizza kits for kids.

Feeling like pizza, I called in a order for pick-up. The girl who took my order was friendly and said my pizza would be ready in about 15 minutes. I headed over and upon walking in I was quickly greeted by the hostess who rang me up and asked if I needed any crushed red pepper or parmesan cheese added to my pizza box. I sat only for a couple minutes before my pizza was brought out. The inside looks very clean, but I was glad I placed my order for pick-up because it looked too trendy to be eating pizza in there. The hostess opened my pizza box and went over my order and asked if it was to my liking. It looked good!

Priced at $13.50 I had the "Margherita DOC" and the pizzas seem to come in one size here. It is more of a personal size pizza, but not super tiny. I was happy with it and couldn't finish the last 2 pieces. The pizza has crushed tomatoes, fresh buffalo mozzarella, basil, parmigiano reggiano and extra virgin olive oil. The crust was light and crispy, while the center of the pizza was softer. I had trouble picking up the pizza and eating it so I used a fork and knife which I don't mind. The crushed tomato sauce tasted sweet. I loved the amount of fresh mozzarella that was on it too! I'd like to try some of their other pizzas so I will be back. They also have some salads that sounds good!

Wow. 5 stars for a grocery store, huh? I've only been to a handful of these elsewhere and haven't found much that appeals to my grocery perusing self. Honestly, I've always thought of Whole Foods as a "window shopping" grocery store. Not the smartest way to utilize one's time, let me tell ya. Despite the astronomically priced goods and somewhat niche, organic, so-local-it-will-make-your-eyes-water type products, these guys earn a solid 5-star high five. Here's why. 

Staff. There is more staff in this joint than you could imagine. I counted 11 behind the cheese counter, 6 behind the fish counter, 6 at the coffee shop, and at least 2 people on each check-out lane. Every aisle had a representative to answer questions, talk up products, or help you find what you need throughout this organic wonderland. 

Local. I love seeing produce and from farms and farmers that are just hours away. There were vendors delivering local salmon, produce, meat, beer, and coffee while people were walking around. It seems that these guys aren't playing around with the idea of "best products for where YOU are" mantra. This does Charlotte well. 

Levels. This place has three levels. First floor is everyone's favorite grocery store. Second is a cafe and third is a cooking school. Yes. A freaking cooking school. That is so rad. They are definitely aiming to be more than just a store where you can buy stuff. The bottom floor is the parking deck. Get this. There are freaking escalators you can ride WITH your shopping cart. Hello, future. This place is just ridiculously cool. 

Although it is a grocery store, I think WF can do some really cool things in Charlotte. I'm looking forward to seeing how the beer/wine bar on the 1st floor impacts the local breweries! So cool to see NoDa, Foothills, Birdsong and Olde Meck on draught! Yes. Draught, local brewskies at a freaking grocery store. Dig it. 

Looking forward to all that is to come for these guys!

"It doesn't matter what my profit margin is, I own the f@#$ing place."
~Old Man Harrison

This place reminds me the Big Mac that seen on TV Commercial looks big and juicy. However, when you actually go get one is totally opposite from the ads.  It located almost out of nowhere location in downtown Las Vegas.  This is a Tourist Hot Spot, the store sure know how's to take advantage of their fame...  Almost half all stuff in the pawnshop is their merchandise; many of them can found on-line.

This pawnshop had the same layout and shape like typical one, but it got army of staff both inside and outside.  It got its own parking lot which is nice, but won't enough in the weekend.  The reason many people wanted to come here, is really wanted a chance to see the real Pawn Star cast, but reality they almost never here at all.  Only any real change you get to meet them is to win a raffle. 

There are some cool stuff in the shop, but that's very small of collection from what it show in TV.  Their main business in the shop is to sell jewelry, after all they name of the store is Gold and Silver ! 

I don't recommend come in the weekend, there will be always a very long line.  Best go there during weekday when the line is usually is much shorter.  One of the nice thing they did in the shop but is really mostly for PR, they had a machine that let you create a free E-Card so you can share to Facebook or just send it to email.  The machine is very slow and the camera will capture many other people in the background that is not from your group.  Camera is allow in the store except in the cashier section. 

I won't come back here unless those cast member are actually there which most likely not unless you won the raffle which I don't I think I did.  Don't just come to Vegas because you only want goes to this shop, there is far more things to do in the Sin City.  This is more like onetime thing for 99% of people.

Yo! To all you legit foodies in the house.  This place is da bomb!

Ok, now that I have your attention with my lame ass hook, seriously, you people need to check this out.  $250/person.  Not stuffy at all.  A ton of fun.  If you really do truly love inventive food (picky eaters opt out) then you will LOVE this. And at $250 per person including tax, alcohol, and gratuity (although you will want to tip more when you are done) it is such a bargain!  Plus, for people who don't drink, the chefs and servers say that the non-alcoholic offerings are extremely inventive.  They seem quite eager to serve them.  I think they just need advance notice.

The process: First, send an email to reserve@ebyjoseandres.com with a variety of dates and times that you would like to go.  Give a bunch of choices.  There are only 8 seats, so keep that in mind.

Next, wait for confirmation.  If you are lucky, you will get a reservation and they will ask for more details including any allergies and if there are any non-drinkers.  Eventually, you will get golden tickets in the mail and a very nice note. (Yes, snail mail.)  Yay!  Very Willy Wonka.

Next, show up at Jaleo at the Cosmopolitan promptly.  Anthony (one of your servers) will be waiting at the hostess stand and will psychically know who you are.  Especially if you are the dope with the golden ticket in your hand and a stupid grin on your face.

Next, enjoy some cava (a variety of sparkling wine) at the bar and meet your foodie companions.  At your respective reservation time (5:30pm and 8:30pm are the choices), you will be escorted to an exquisitely designed room separate from the rest of the restaurant where three chefs and two servers will prepare and serve the best food in the world right in front of your eyes.  It's essentially a 3-hour conversation about food, while you pig out.  And, yes, there is stripper dust involved.  http://eat.c-bas.com/2011/03/14/e-by-jose-andres/  But it's all good. :)

The other reviews and all the blogs go through all the courses in better detail than I ever could.  For example, see http://www.kevineats.com/2011/01/e-by-jose-andres-las-vegas-nv.html and the link above. Just let me say that this is a best meal I have ever had and I've been to Guy Savoy, Joel Robuchon/L'Atelier, Masa (NYC), French Laundry, Per Se, Le Bernardin... need I go on.  I'm a food and service snob (when I expect quality), and this is the best.  I actually closed my eyes in bliss during many of the courses.  The servers, Anthony and Stephanie, are fabulous. The chefs, Edwin, Brett, and Johannes, are also terrific.  Very knowledgeable and so willing to share that knowledge.  It's so much fun and we made some new foodie friends.  What's better than that?

The Biltmore is superbly impressive from the moment you drive up and keeps your eyes dancing throughout your stay.  So much history and so much charm, this place is part Playboy Mansion, part Neverland Ranch and part Palace of Versailles.  Life size chess sets on the perfectly manicured lawn, fountains at every turn, an undeveloped mountain range as its backdrop, and poolside cabanas fit for Marilyn Monroe (she called the Biltmore her favorite pool).  Indeed, the halls are lined with photographic history of famous guests spanning the resort's opening in 1929 to present day.  (I didn't take a star off for the picture of our current prez who's a repeat guest, but I was tempted).  It makes you feel like royalty to just be there, even if you're an average Joe like me.

I give an enthusiastic A+ to the SERVICE, landscaping, feather-topped bed, and aesthetic appeal/charm of the grounds.  I was most impressed with the service.  With rooms running $600 a night, you don't want to find out that only half of the staff got the five star customer service training.  Biltmore has it down from the front desk to groundskeepers.  A special mention of the 24/7 town cars waiting to pick you up any time you're ready  to step out.

I give an A to the spa which could use a face lift, but nonetheless awarded me the best massage and facial that I've had this millennium.  Also to the in-room dining which was kinda yummy, but lickety-split, the fastest room service I ever had.

I give an A- to the room decor.  They are going for that Mission-style rustic chic, but it looked a little too Hilton and could use less of the "standardized theme" decor.  But, the rooms were very well kept and sparkling clean.  I stayed in, and highly recommend, a "resort deluxe" room and think it's worth every extra penny to wake up to coffee on your private balcony with a view of the mountains.  

If I hadn't stayed there in the middle of winter I could have played at one of their eight pools. (I'd def hang at the one with the waterslide AND the swim up bar.)  On the flip side, it was nice to have the resort virtually to myself; I had no problem getting room service in less than 1/2 an hour or a couple same-day reservations at the spa.

*psst* It's Frank Lloyd Wright "inspired."  The actual architect was a student of his, but the big guy didn't actual design the hotel.  Darn good knock-off though!

I always get flyers in the mail for BJ's, but for whatever reason hadn't ever tried it until now. The inside appeared clean and I was greeted and helped right away. The menu had a good variety of options. I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered a "Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato Salad" priced at $3.50 thinking it would be small for the price, but I was wrong! There was a fair mix of red onion, tomato, mozzarella, basil and it was topped with a balsamic dressing. I was impressed with the amount of mozzarella in it and it tasted fresh and good. My niece was with me and she chose priced at $4.95 a "Kids Pizza" from the kids menu. It was a 6 in deep dish cheese pizza topped with tomatoes. I scored a piece and it was good! I liked the thickness and flavor. The kids pizza also included a drink so it was a good deal and she was happy! 

They offer online ordering and you can go inside to pick it up or call the number on the sign in the designated parking when you arrive and they will bring it out to you. If you eat here often you might want to consider signing up for their rewards program.

I recently stayed at the Riviera for a large, national conference and have been fantasizing about what kind of review I would write after the horrible service I received. 

I should mention, first, that we were warned about booking a room at the hotel. Several people affiliated with the conference warned they, their family members, or friends had gotten bed bugs while staying at the Riviera. Because the conference we were in Vegas to attend was being held there, my colleague and I decided to press our luck and stay there for convenience.

I've decided to write a simple account of my experience in chronological order. 

1) When I went to check in, I attempted to redeem a voucher for a free room upgrade. Surprise! The room was already booked and they had only rooms left with king-sized beds. No offense fo my colleague, but we preferred to have our own beds. Sounded like the Twitter deal was a scam. The real offense? The check-in clerk was incredibly rude. I was astounded. 

2) We got bedbugs. Yep. It happened. I have pictures. When we brought this to the front desk's attention a manager came out, hurried us into a corner, told us security would meet us up at the room to investigate. We protested, he insisted. We went up to the room where a security officer met us. He took pictures of the bites, wrote something down and keyed up his radio, "Code green, that's a positive." I rolled my eyes. He took his flashlight and peered under the top cover. "I don't see any bedbugs." 

Bedbugs infest the corners of mattresses. They get in the little seams. They crawl on the top of picture frames. Alongside the corners of the carpet. I couldn't believe it. We protested and he called his supervisor. 

This huge guy came into the room and we explained how impossible it was to conclude there were no bedbugs after such a cursory check. We said we didn't want to pay for the room. He said that the management would take care of everything and escorted us back to the manager. 

The manager told us there was nothing he could do except change our rooms. He told us security have their procedures and are trained (to be useless, for sure). We protested. He gave us a card and said loss prevention would contact us in 7-10 days. That was on the 14th of March. Today is March 29th; I've heard nothing. We told him the security guy said management would take care of us. He said there was nothing he could do. As a result of their incompetence, we missed dinner with our colleagues. They did give us, after my roommate got upset, a voucher for dinner. 

3) When we went to check out, we asked right away to speak with a manager. A different manager than the previous night appeared, and when we said we got bedbugs she hurried us away from the other folks checking out. We told her we didn't want to pay for the room. She said there was nothing she could do--loss prevention would contact us. We said she was the manager--she could do anything she wanted. I said, "I've read many reviews on various travel sites that have claimed loss prevention never contacts them after they get bed bugs." She got upset and said, "Why would you go and read those sites!" I laughed and said, I'm happy to show the folks in line my bites. Then she called security. 

4) Security came and mocked us and threatened us. We said we were here with the teacher's conference, and one guard got angry and said angrily, "What kind of teachers do you think you are?" They circled us as my roommate continued talking to the manager. I told them to get out of my personal space and asked folks who were checking out to witness their hostility. They got in my face and I started taking pictures. I have several. I started tweeting everything. That's when they backed off and left. 

Now, you can make your own decision to stay here. My roommate and I have not yet been contacted by the hotel about getting bed bugs. 

The managers at this hotel had total control over our experience as guests, and they chose not to compensate us adequately, the hotel security insulted and threatened us, and there has been no follow up. 

Choose where you stay wisely.

Ive tried to like this place, really! Ive put in a solid effort but time after time I'm just so disappointed. 

1st time- I sat at the bar for lunch. After waiting almost 15 minutes for the bartender to show up, I ordered a glass of Cab and the Carpaccio. The carpaccio came out 20 minutes later, and it was room temperature. Now after working in Italian restaurants for most of my life I know carpaccio is supposed to be cold, due to being raw meat. When i confronted the bartender about this all she said was "that's how its served here" I ordered another glass of wine and didn't touch my meal. When i got the bill i noticed i was charged for two glasses of Merlot. at $16 each & she didn't take the carpaccio off my bill even though it was untouched and I voiced my concern about it. 
When I asked her why the Merlot she said "Oh well that's what i poured you, and you drank it" I laughed paid the bill and vowed to never return.

2nd time- Firefly was too busy and my friends all talked me into giving this place another try so I did. It was a disaster. Bartender obviously had friends at the bar so we were ignored the majority of the time, and when we got our bill their were drinks on their that were obviously not ours... but couldn't help but notice the bartenders friends were drinking what was on our bill. Nice dude.. real nice.

3rd time- Came in here last night for the live music. And once again... 100% pure disappointment. We were seating in the lounge area and it was absolutely impossible to get service. The little Russian server was not only rude but we kept having to go up to the bartender for drinks because she was no where to be found.

All i have left to say now is... 3 STRIKES YOUR OUT.

I was driving through Mt. Lebanon at lunchtime and saw a new sign on Washington Rd. I'm glad I stopped to investigate because I was in for a delicious surprise! 

The Simple Greek is essentially a Greek food version of Chipotle and Qdoba (with all the same greatness!) You can build a pita, a salad, or a bowl with rice, vegetables, sauces, and meats to your own liking. I had a gyro meat rice bowl with delicious sour cream tzatziki sauce, green beans and potatoes in red sauce, and fresh veggies on top. I was so excited that I could decide what flavors to put together! They really make it to suit you--when I asked to try both types of rice in my bowl, the man making my meal was perfectly willing to split it down the middle to make it just the way I wanted it.

Additionally, the staff there was wonderful! I really appreciated that they took the time to explain what was in everything because, as someone with multiple food allergies, I hate to be surprised. Also, the woman in line behind me was asking about the vegetarian options on the menu and the man assisting her seemed very accommodating to her too. Each person I talked to seemed genuinely happy that I was there to eat, and that is always a plus in my book!

The atmosphere is welcoming, the place looks clean and well-maintained, and I'm eager to recommend it to all of my friends!

My husband and I went to Las Vegas for a quick honeymoon after our wedding since we both had to go back to work. He booked Joel Robuchon after research and reading about how amazing this place is.  

Our trip to Joel Robuchon started out wonderful. A limo picked us up from our hotel and we got a walk through the gorgeous MGM mansion. The decor of the restaurant was beautiful. Then the wine list came and my husband LOVES wine so he asked to speak to the sommelier with a few questions about the wine. The sommelier arrived at our table and rather hesitatingly answered my husband's few questions then proceeded to steer us towards another page with the comment "I think you'll find these more in your.. price range"

record scratch.

uhm, excuse me?! Yes, we are both in our mid twenties and it doesn't help that we are asian and therefore look like we are in our teens but here we are, about to shell out at least $600 for a meal (ours ended up around $800) that comment was so unnecessary in so many ways. We were both shocked into silence and proceeded with our meal.

Then came time for dessert. During the course of our meal we saw the tables to our right, left, front, and back be served complimentary desserts/cakes for anniversaries, birthdays, etc. We ended up with nothing despite the fact that it was our honeymoon. I'm not one to complain about complimentary things but it was a little ridiculous considering literally everyone in the restaurant was getting them except us. Perhaps we were not in the.. price range..

Overall the food itself was really really spectacular. The bread and dessert cart was amazing and every dish that came along was just exquisite. However the service completely ruined our meal and it was really really disappointing. We've never dealt with such condescension at any restaurant and was definitely not expecting it from such a highly renowned place with a michelin star.

FOIE GRAS...F-orget O-ther I-nsignificant E-xperiences G-et R-eady (for an) A-mazing S-andwich at Goodwich.
That is what possessed me to drive from Henderson to Downtown with a growling stomach looking for a unique lunch and not settle for everyday boring because my usual lunch date has stomach issues.
I get to this little shack around 12pm with normal looking people standing in line...not a weird downtown crowd at all. I didn't know what everyone meant by "OG"...until I looked across the street and saw OG Topless Bar (good landmark)...maybe where the bad witch lives lol.
I walked up to order looking at the simple menu (with descriptions of ingredients, yay) knowing I was going to try the much talked about "Foie" even though I had a lot of apprehension from never having eaten foie gras in my life. I was bewitched by all the positive descriptions everyone posted about this sandwich that I had to have it...good, bad or otherwise I was going to try foie gras today. The gentleman who took my order was very reassuring that it would be a treat for me and that at $9, it was a great way for me to try it and not break the bank. I found an empty chair to eat that made me feel like I was a young student at school having my favorite sandwich at lunch.
As you can already tell, I LOVED it! Such a strange combination to put together but it all works. Foie gras mousse/terrine that had a creamy texture with light earthy, almost truffle-like hints (not at all gamey), this very crispy thick chicken skin (like when you hit the crispy skin jackpot on a perfectly roasted chicken), chopped almonds, and pickled purple cabbage that made sense as a necessity to cut the richness of the foie gras, all inside a grilled crunchy white bread that scrapes the inside of your mouth a little. Creamy, crunchy, savory...I couldn't believe this taste explosion that I enjoyed with each bite to the last. Oh yes. I finished the whole thing! I was really blown away how
 much I enjoyed this sandwich. It was life changing lol. It would be wonderful to see Goodwich occupy a space in the upcoming Galaxy Market in the Arts District...a space for artisanal foods, craft brews and aspiring restauranteurs.

Wow! What a fantastic meal. From start to finish the attention to detail was incredible. The staff was well trained for the soft opening, the kitchen executed beautifully and Giada was in the house to see everything was up to par. It did not disappoint!

Cocktails are well thought out and the Hannibal was a crowd favorite. We sipped on those while we gazed over the huge selection of anti-pasta items. It's a bit overwhelming to choose, because they all sound delicious, but eventually we decided the table would share the dates ($14), burrata ($12), orzo meatballs ($13), rollatini ($12) lobster arancini ($18), salami and cheese platter. Bite after bite was utterly delicious. However, the dates stood out as a favorite, like most these were sweet and salty, but what set them apart was the spice from the Italian sausage. They had some serious kick, which I loved. The aged parmesan from the platter was dreamy, as well.

Next, we shared a variety of pastas: Giada's signature spaghetti ($28), tortellini ($26), ravioli ($34), and farrotto ($26). The spaghetti's simplicity really shines with a touch of lemon, basil and three jumbo shrimp. The ravioli was delicate and filled with wonderful flavors from the lobster, asparagus, and tarragon. The farrotto had a wonderfully chewy texture and earthy flavor from the morel mushrooms and distinct richness from the pecorino, we really enjoyed it. The manager brought over an order of risotto ($30) for comparison. It too was delicious, it oozed with bold seafood flavors from the crab and scallops. You cannot go wrong.

We had already enjoyed a feast, but the main course was still to come. We had the veal chop saltimbocca ($43), rack of lamb ($45), and Tuscan ribeye ($68). The veal chop and the ribeye were straight from the Flintstones. These were extremely large portions even for the heartiest of appetites. Every bit of it was stellar. The lemon potatoes were the perfect accompaniment. They are smashed and fried and topped with cheese.  Meat and potatoes never tasted so good.

Dessert selections were chosen for us. There was a trio of gelatos, the espresso and chocolate really stood out. The banana was the least favorite. Then, there were assorted cookies, tart and other pastries. To cap it off they served a scrumptious nutella espresso that was simply sinful.

The dining room is gorgeous. You can spot Giada's special touches all over. The retractable windows are impressive though it got a bit warm when they were open. The photobooth is fun and sets the mood for the playful evening that lies ahead.

So bad I had to review about it right away.. DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED!

I really had high hopes and was dying to try this place since it opened... I should've read the reviews and did a little more research but my eagerness got the best of me and I paid for it... $39 dollars of crappy food that is..

Idea and concept is there but execution sucked! Presentation sucked! And service definitely sucked!

First the prices for hotdogs, burgers and fries were up the ass.. Second, upon ordering our burger we had requested for the meat to be cooked "medium rare".. The cashier and so-called cook said "You know that's raw right?" I said, "What?!" Excuse me last time I checked medium rare meant the meat cooked but has a touch of red in the middle, not raw.. PLEASE EDUCATE YOUR COOKS & STAFF!! Looked at us like we were stupid... Third, when we received our food presentation was crap! Wasn't at all pretty and looked pretty damn ordinary to me considering we got the most expensive hot dog & burger... 

Now the taste.. There was no quality in the food! Was not worth the monies we spent! Hot dogs could've more than likely come from your local Albertsons, the foie gras was bland, cheap bread, the "Perfect Burger" was so ordinary, my first poutine was yet my worst poutine.. 

WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY & SPACE AT THE LINQ-- will NOT be returning!

I've had 14 reviews deleted by the legal department this year. And, I really wanna write a nice review for Tea Time Cafe that will still be around this time next year. So, I've decided to drop my tired and worn out "Schtick" in order to avoid violating any more TOS. Therefore, I have devised an ingenious idea to use everyone else's schticks, since they don't seem to have as many reviews deleted. 

So here it goes: 

THE SKINNY Tea Time Cafe is a real jewel of the Northwest. THE SKINNY, they have honey toast with green tea ice cream. THE SKINNY I loved it more than I love Canada.  THE SKINNY, with honey toast in the NW, I don't have to drive to Ichiza or Shuseki anymore! THE SKINNY, the guy who manages this place was really nice to me and didn't mind that I waited on the couch for 10 minutes for my friends to show up. THE SKINNY, they got a cool claw machine that has rilakkuma and domos.  THE SKINNY I don't LIKE Tea Time Cafe. I LOVE it. THE SKINNY If I don't love it, I don't swallow. 

I LOVE BIG WEINERS! But they didn't have weiners here, MORONS! So perhaps my morals helped me get the curry fries. They are perhaps like chili cheese fries but with curry instead of chili. The fries weren't immoral and perhaps were cooked extra crispy. It did not hella suck. Perhaps, it was the opposite of sucking. Speaking about sucking, I sucked them down like a hoover! The workers were not IDIOTS or CREEPY immorals! They were actually really nice, SCORE! Perhaps, I love the fries more than I love big weiners. And the prices be so low dat I be ballin on a budget! YAY!

GABAZINGA! I'm so fun! I showed up to Tea Time Cafe alone, but I always have fun when I'm around! While waiting for my friend to show up, I broke out my photography skills and took several pictures of the food I ordered. But, I accidentally deleted all the photos before uploading them onto yelp. Jeez could I be more ridiculous? I sometimes wish I could be! Wizzle Wozzle! The curry fries were perfectly browned and the curry itself was made from a real gram masala rather than a powder mix. It wasn't JCZ, but I was satisfied and not too uncomfortably full. I wasn't trippin... and after taking a selfie with that same goofball face I always make, Amanda and I ended up break dancing on out of there. 

(T)hank u BIG MAHALO Amanda-monstah for always recommending such great restaurants! SHAKA!  
(E)very Japanese item from ramen to unagi don is on the menu-monstah. ATTACK!!!
(A)pple Yogurt Smoothie had me slurping like a smoothie-killah!! ATTACK!! 

(T)una rice balls with unagi sauce is on FIYAH! Bomb!
(I)'m running out of creative words to use for this schtick
(M)e has a gud tee drunk...
(E)pithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma..Sorry I couldn't think of another word that started with E. 
Wakki Lakki Aloha!
(yelp challenge 100 out of 2343)

after dropping off donations at the next yelp help event and bragging about it all over talk, i'm gonna make sure that tea time cafe becomes my regular spot to hang out with my friends who are so much more popular than you. i can see myself jumping into my vessel of transportation which carries the shape of my soul to tea time cafe every morning for coffee and a boba.  i don't go to bad restaurants, and i can see a bad restaurant from miles away because i have super powers..i can see through bullshit. and tea time cafe is ranked #1 by centennial hills yelp. i'm not spreading rumors again, ttc is more legit than yonaka. i can't believe i just said that, well i guess i'm at that age where my brain just says things just to see what happens. 

99.9% of the time it's those darn BANDWAGON faux Japanese WANNABES who run 99.9% of these places. My ability to sense bandwagon wannabe Japanese restaurants is 99.9% more acute than the reflexes of the kitty cat on my profile picture. I'm 99.9% sure Tea Time Cafe is 99.9% not a bandwagon wannabe.  I love Tea Time Cafe more than 99.9% of yelpers. I've eaten here 99.9% more than all of you. They got good miso ramen here, and as you know I got 99.9% more ramen experience than you. They also have Tonkatsu here, not Tonkotsu!! GET IT RIGHT!!! GOD DAMN IT! Why is it that 99.9% of you non-Japanese get tonkAtsu confused with tonkOtsu! That makes me feel 99.9% like blowing my brains out at Kabuto where I'm 99.9% sure they are not bandwagon wannabes. 

BTW Amanda, keep your meaningless crown! 

Legal disclaimer- RELAX!!! Please learn how to take a joke. I'm a big fan of all your reviews and schticks. This was not a diss, it was an informative parody.  At least this review was more informative than those yelp tips that only say "yummy" or "the duke is here!"

70+ visits and Tender continues to deliver!!!

This is my goto spot to unwind in Vegas.  Why?

1.  Top notch service especially at the bar.  Bar staff is incredible.  Perfect if your dining alone.

2.  Simple food done right.

3.  Well chosen "special" ingredients (like their butter... ask them about how its sourced, and the game).

4.  Very reasonable prices. (Expect to pay less than $100 for a couple of drinks and dinner especially with all the discounts they give you just for walking into the Luxor).

As always, the rule with Tender is, if its different, order it, else keep it simple.

The charcuterie and deli meats (different) is outstanding.  It includes wild boar sausage, duck ham, and antelope pastrami with a selection of mustard.  Wow!  The salmon sampler (simple) is also well worth the try.  Both are large portions and can easily be a light meal if you pair it with a drink.

For mains, its all about the meat.  Take your pick of the cuts and different producers.  This is the short list:  American Kobe from Mishima Ranch, Durham Ranch Bison, Strauss Farm veal, and free-range Berkshire Heritage pork.  Any cut.  All incredible and take the classic flavors of each type of meat to the limit. You will notice this immediately.

Finally, if you're adventurous, have the wild game tasting or if they have it as a special order the elk chop.  I can't even describe how good these dishes are.

Skip the sides unless you are really hungry.

I always say when it comes to Asian restaurants especially Chinese and Taiwanese - the crappier the service, the better the food. Tony T's ROTD reminded me to take this off my bookmarked places.

Xiao Long Bao:
You get 9 baos for $7. I can't help but compare XLB I've had in Shanghai and Taipei to everyone else's version. I'm very happy to say that I've found my XLB spot here in Vegas! The bao had the perfect thickness, the soup inside was hot and delicious. Glowing and glistening 5/5

Fried Tofu with Mixed Mushrooms:
Even though the tofu pieces were fried, they were soft. The mushrooms were tasty but they slide off your chopsticks. The brown sauce was good. 4/5

Beef Noodle Soup:
Our server warned me this was spicy. I appreciate it when they do that but I had a cold anyway so, bring on the heat! I could taste cumin. My nose started running - I'm not sure if it was from the spiciness or my cold...or both. The beef chunks were fatty so I had to eat around it since I'm not a fan of animal fat. I had 2 pieces of bok choy and tender noodles in my bowl. 3.5/5

Pork Loin in Red Garlic Sauce:
I didn't even know we ordered this. Shredded pork with red bell pepper strips. This reminded me of a thick and meatier version of Hot & Sour soup. 3.5/5

Steamed Shrimps in House Garlic Sauce:
Head on, butterflied but not all shrimps got de-veined. But the sauce was fantastic! Nice and garlicky. One of the better ways I've had shrimp. 4.5/5

They have street food you'll find in China like frog legs, chicken organ meat on a stick, etc.There were items we wanted to try but they no longer serve them like: enoki mushroom beef roll, pork belly with preserved vegetable(s)They need to update their menu. Even our server said it. They need to remove items they no longer serve and correct the typos. I'll definitely come back for XLB!

Everything is pretty small and served like tapas, but somehow its surprisingly filling.  There were definite highs and lows to this meal, but I think there were a few dishes that excelled while only a few weren't quite what we had hoped for.

There was a big group of us so I managed to sample quite a big portion of the menu.

Highlights:

Carnitas tacos-served with guac, pork rinds, and a verde sauce!

Like water for Chocolate- fried quail served with dragonfruit and edible flowers.  

Chilaquilles- tortilla chips cooked in a pan with a salsa verde and cheese.  Kinda like nachos.

Mango "sticky rice"- this is something quite interesting.  The sticky rice part was made into a mousse and ripe mangoes.  I've never seen this before and it was really cool.  The "rice" element were like rice crispies on top.  

Chocolate "terrain"- Awesome chocolate mold of a Chinese soldier with a spicy chocolate mousse inside.  It was served with cookie crumbs to look like sand, and a ginger ice cream that was spicy and sweet all at the same time.

Things to skip:

Oceans Nest- fried noodles served with stirfried saucy seafood and veggies.  We ate all the lobster out of it and then left it there.  It was super bland.

Lamb potstickers- pretty presentation with the little edible flowers and everything but it was bland and looked more exciting than it tasted.

Overall, I thought the place had a whimsy to it that I thought was fun.  The ambiance was interesting and diverting, the waitress and wait staff were helpful and went out of their way to see to our requests.  While some of the food is a bit overpriced and small, I really enjoyed their desserts, there is something light hearted and comical about them.  They were the highlight of the meal.  If nothing else, come and have dessert and a laugh all at the same time.

XS is a gorgeous club, no doubt. Plus, it's huge and you can go outside when it's getting cramped inside. However, like most clubs in Vegas, the cover is expensive ($30 for guys, $20 for girls and Encore guests - there's no guestlist), the drinks are nearly $20 a pop, and terrible, terrible DJ. I personally cannot stand mash-ups of terrible hip hop songs, but I guess the majority of club-goers are down with that and/or have short attention spans. They seriously need to get some good celebrity DJs in there -- they make enough money to have one every night.

The doormen and staff are actually really nice, and luckily we got to bypass the insane line. It looked like the line was rather quick though, and they started letting people inside on Friday at around 9:30pm.

The huge pool area is a nice place to lounge, and you can get bottle service out in the cabanas as well. The bartenders work fast, so getting drinks from the bars isn't a problem. 

There are a lot of beautiful people (ow! 8/14 gallery, page 6 http://www.xslasvegas.com/flash/index.php), and the go-go dancers are pretty hot... so yes, there are a lot of things that make XS way better than all of the other big clubs I've been to in Vegas. It definitely feels glamorous, not trashy. Expect to spend around $100 per person. But then again, money ain't a thing when you're in Sin City!

After living here 10 years I figure I have seen enough to have something to say.

What started as a rural community with a few subdisions and of course the toursist attraction of a street full of casinos & hotels. The Strip.

Then it was NightClubs,StripClubs,MegaRessorts, and World Class Dining & Entertainment.

This place has morphed into a Metropolis with freeways criss-crossing the city and MegaResorts, Supermalls, neighborhood strip malls and neighborhood casinos suburban communities like Summerlin, Del Webb, Lone Mountain, and all the subdiviisions.

Houses were built by the 1000's overnight with imported labor. Population went from 60K to over 300K in less than 5 years.

WHat happend?

Schools are 48th in the country which is BAD.Huge class sizes, very underqualified teachers and lots of non-english speaking.40% high school drop out rate!!

Healthcare is non-existant-UMC the county hospital receycled needles spreading Hepatitis last year.Plus nurse shortages.

Courts, County Commission, Mayor and other Governemnt Offcials are corrupt as they come.-The mayor is a former mob attorney. County officials have been indicted & convicted of many crimes, Judges & lawyers arrested regularly. Its madness

Parks & Recreation is where we actually exceed expectations. Theres lots of parks and stuff to do without having to gamble.Lots of sporting events for the kids.

Jobs-Well pay is relatively low unless you are in a high tip paying job or a stripper or something illegal.
Most jobs on the Strip require a Sherrifs Card which cost you $40-$50 and requires a background check and fingerprinting at the police station.
Some jobs also require a Health Card for food handling etc, this requires you to go to the hospital and get a TB shot and watch a video some people have to get other shots too.
Then there the TAM card-Tobacco & Alcohol Managemnt-waitresses,bartenders,clerks and lots more have to get this card which requires a class & test to complete. Plus it cost you $80-#$00.

Food & Entertainment.-Well everyone knows about the Fancy Chefs and all their Fancy restaurants on the Strip but Las VEgas is filled with culinary delights. Many people relocate here and bring their own cuisine and styles.

There's tons of community events for familys and Vegas knows how to throw a party. The big Holidays are always loaded with tourists  but you kind find many intimate events throughout the year.

Lots of quality librarys and other resources.


Casinos have been allowed to build in residential neighborhoods so now nearly every neighborhood has a casino of some kind which is nice if you like $2.99 breakfast & other thinngs casinos offer.

The bus system has added the Duece to its fleet making ir a little better but its still a little slow. The monorail has been erected but not completed. It seems it would be a better beenfit going to & from the airport to the strip.

Many of the traditional casinos had been imploded & new ones bigger & brighter and more expensive have been built in their place. Condos on the strip have become a reality and even Trump has come to town.

Our XFL Football team came & went. We have lots of sporting events and concerts to attend and at reasonable prices.No real chance of ever getting a PRO sports team..

Las Vegas is hot & sunny 300 days a year and for some a little too hot but we adapt and learn to beat the heat.

We have pools in our backyards all hotels and apartments have them too. Lake Mead & Hoover Dam is just a drive to the water even though its been less than impressive over the years.

It's pricy to live in the city but you have everything you need right in the neighborhood, lots of great finds & deals around, usually plenty of jobs to go around and there's always a little luck.

You can take a vacation just by going down the strip or downtown , theres always something new & exciting. Learning to use the comp system at the casinos makes living in Vegas so much funner.

Prostituion may not be legal but there's plenty of Escorts for you and Marijuana has been decriminalized so the cops don't fuck with you plus the quality has gotten alot better with all the legal supply in California nearby.I love this place all you can eat munchies for under $10 everyday!!

This place is awesome!  If you've never had a pasty, think of it as a huge empanada.  If you've never had an empanada, think of it as the biggest and best gourmet hot pocket ever...and maybe think about trying some new restaurants :)

Choices, choices, choices!!  So many fillings to try.  My wife got the Veggie Chicken Tikka Masala.  Their faux meat of choice is a British brand called Quorn.  It's not as firm as Gardein but blended really well with the curried sauce, potatoes, peppers and had great texture.  I got the Veggie Cottage Pie (Quorn vegetarian ground beef, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar. With a side of HP sauce.) that really hit the spot as it was savory and just got better bite after bite.  We also got to see the guys make a set of pasties by the bar and it looked as homemade as you could get.  

I'd say this would be an ideal place for lunch but you'd be seriously missing out on one major thing...their beer list!!  That is unless you can get away with being buzzed and having beer breath at work.  If that's the case, please PM me your work address so I can apply.  There are a ton of great beers from Joseph James to Chimay to a lot of British brands I have never heard of.  I got a beer that tasted like banana bread.  The bartender told me he didn't like it, my wife hated it, I loved it!!!

Then there's the whole atmosphere...really cool!  No video poker at the bar.  No TV anywhere!  The Cure and Sex Pistols blaring from the speakers.  Very refreshing!

Located way off the strip in an unassuming shopping center, you'd probably miss this restaurant if you blinked. Luckily, the stellar reviews made in part by my fellow Yelpers piqued my interest in finding this elusive favorite. Now locating the place is a challenge in itself but landing a reservation is equally exhausting!
As fate would have it, I landed a 9pm dining reservation. Woot! Little did I know, however, that a reservation merely meant when you arrived, you'd be relegated to waiting an additional 10-15minutes for your seat. 
That being said, I took the opportunity to park it at the sidebar to glance over the extensive menu while guzzling down a bottle of Asahi with shots of chilled nigori. 
Honestly, by the time I was seated, I was about three sheets to the wind! I know, I'm a cheap date.

Now onto the food shall we?

I went with the server's recommendations as well as my seasoned Yelp buddies' choices who've had successful dining experiences here previously...

Negitoro Blue Fin 35$ fresh and buttery slices of blue fin tuna with a cast of delectable condiments that left my taste buds doing a happy dance! Trust me, the experience is virtually umami x 10! 

Wagyu Sashimi 20$ - thinly sliced filets of premium rare wagyu beef with a hint of wasabi on top and accompanied with a special savory soy dipping sauce. The first bite was like velvet on my tongue and the mouthfeel was literally like butter melting in my mouth. Superb!

Agedashi tofu 7.50$ 1/2 order -a delightful dish with compelling flavors and an irresistibly soft texture that had me pining for more 

Butter sauted scallop 7$ x2 - my favorite dish of the evening. The butter poached scallops were soft and supple with an incredibly mouthwatering garlicky flavor and fluffy texture. Absolutely amazing!

Enoki Mushroom & Bacon 3$ x2 come on now, we know everything tastes better with bacon and this was no exception. Just order it and thank me later.

Chicken wrapped chicken skin 3x2 -tender chunks of chicken breast wrapped in succulent chicken skin. An indulgent  experience that is second to none 

Poached Egg with Sea Urchin & Salmon Roe full cast of delectable ingredients that left my taste buds in a tailspin of delight. Intriguing enjoyable and texturally fascinating! 

Other notable dishes included:
Kobe Garlic Skirt 7.50 x2
Kurobuta Pork Cheek 4.25$ x2
Foie gras egg custard 10
Duck in balsamic 4.50$ x2
Iberico Pork 10 x2
Nigori 40$ well worth it! IMO I bought 2 bottles :)

All in all, I had a great dining experience at Raku and it's safe to say I'd gladly return to enjoy their enticing small plates again and, of course, to imbibe in their spirits!

Happy Eats!

The following review is specifically for the "Bungalow room type" 

These rooms are in the attached two story building out by the swimming pool. We had a ground level room with a sliding glass door facing the parking lot and a busy street. 

Did not have a secure feeling as it felt like anyone could walk up from the street and have direct access to the sliding glass door. The rooms are all nonsmoking in the Bungalows so the sliding glass door was good for lover boy to go in and out for a smoke. That was the only good thing! 

Thank goodness I had my lover Sean with me for protection, otherwise I would have been sleeping with one eye open. 

We only stayed here one night as we attended an industry VIP open bar event and showing for "Purple Reign" who performs at Hooter's. We planned on getting sloppy drunk that night so figured we could just crawl to our room and avoid driving for the night. 

This room sucked balls, and not the good kind. The bathroom tub was moldy and the water did not drain, seriously I took a shower standing in half a tub of water! The walls and floors had major mold as well. 

The room was very small, and had one outlet for electricity which was occupied by the lamp and TV. We had to reach behind and unplug the TV just to charge our phone, ridiculous. 

The towels are cheap, stained and shredding. Wow the quality is so bad it makes paper towels a better option to dry off with. 

The ice machine was broke, took housekeeping 45 minutes to bring us a bucket of ice. 

Yes! You get what you pay for in Vegas when it comes to hotel accommodations! It was $27 for the night (weekday) we stayed on a Tuesday. 

Crappy rooms, moldy bathrooms and no outlets for charging your cell will leave you with a stinky taste in your mouth by staying in these rooms! 

Hooter's is a huge let down, it is obvious they have given up and are not going to put any money into keeping this property updated. What a shame! 

I normally complain when something is this bad, luckily for the front desk we had partied so much and just wanted to jump in bed and get busy. 

I later sent an email to Hooter's "Customer Service" with the complaint details of our stay, did I get a response? Of course not...lol I knew that was a waste of time. 

Don't do it! Please Please I beg of you!

After two consecutive incidents with the same server, Debra, I'm forced to write this review. First happened February 14th, 2014. My girlfriend and I came in for dinner. She took our order wrong, food came out wrong, runner went back into kitchen, couple minutes later food came out right so no big deal. Debra however pretended it didn't happen and didn't even apologize. Again, no big deal. Left her a 18% tip and totaled it to 90$ on my card. On my credit card statement I was charged 100$. 

I Talked to the manager, Alennry, on the phone and said he was busy at the moment so he gave me his email to explain the situation. Emailed him twice over the course of two weeks and no reply. I ended up letting it go, convincing myself it could have been an honest mistake. 

April 12th, 2014 rolls around and I decide their happy hour sounds good, which it is. Don't get me wrong it's a great happy hour. Again were sat in Debra's section. Funny right? This time I total my card to 33$ and I was charged 38$, same thing with my girlfriends card. Now I'm at the point where I'm very upset because it's clear Debra is forging credit card tips. Being a server in the Vegas industry myself I know this is the biggest no no. 

Now I go in and talk to Nectaly himself about the situation. He seemed very sorry and genuine about the situation and said he would get the money refunded. At the end of the day, the extra 5$ charged on not only one but both our cards is not a big deal, it's the principle that counts. Nectaly emails me saying he's getting statements from his merchant. Takes about a week but he finally gets them. Then he doesn't email back for a couple days and then I finally get an email saying he's in New York and will refund them as soon as he's back. I say that's awesome and couple days go by and no email or refund. I email again and now there's absolutely no response for a week.

And now I'm writing this review. It's upsetting because like I said, their happy hour and food quality is awesome. But this is not the way you do business. The first time could have been an honest mistake but twice from the same server is no coincidence. You don't steal from customers, that's not the way you do business. Please take warning. The managers and owners seem to be more than okay with doing shady business.

Any buffet that calls itself "The Buffet" is either very comfortable with what it is (a buffet) or is trying to sound like "THE buffet" (kind of like the pretentious alums of THE Ohio State). In the case of "The Buffet" at Aria, it is the more humble laidback version. The light, bright, and open atmosphere of the buffet and simple, yet delicious dishes means The Buffet is a good choice when at the hotel, casino, or City Center. This isn't really a buffet to go out of your way for in Vegas, but is a nice option if you're already there.

It's only $21 for lunch. If you want all-you-can-drink wine, then try the $37 dinner. The good stuff (aka Gourmet with Lobster) is only served Friday and Saturday dinner. If you are used to Las Vegas buffets, then the pile of crab legs, small selection of sushi, meats, pastas, and salads will seem very familiar. Nothing really stood out or sucked. I liked the pasta with alfredo sauce for some reason and a simple salad. Maybe it was because we were towards the end of our stay. Of course, desserts are a highlight of any Vegas buffet and the same is true at Aria with little cakes, pastries, and ice cream.

What a pleasant surprise !   Took the gf, another friend and her daughter to dinner at SF a few nights ago.  Unusual location but not out of the way.  The eating area is kinda small but comfortable.  Laughed when I hit the restroom and determined the men's room is almost equal in size to the dining area.

The menu is a little confusing but the concept is simply  you got food for health conscious people and food for a fat ass like me.  we ordered:

flat chicken and greens ( $8 ) with a side of fruit ( included in price - not sure why ) 

Chicken and waffles ( $8.50)  - secret, off menu item

Nice to greek you healthy pizza flat bread/pizza ( 9.50 )

Maine Wedge happy salad ( $4.50 ) 

Highlights - well, basically EVERYTHING !  great value, well prepared and creative.  I can't believe i'm going to write this but I think the prices are on the low side for what you get - the wedge salad ( pic incl ) has large chunks of cheese and bacon with the egg and then you smash on one of the lettuce spears - Mmmmmm - good stuff ! and at $4.50 ??? are you kiddin' me !

The flat chicken and greens has a full chicken breast smashed done and grilled, seasoned perfectly with a bed of greens - the gf was happy.

I guess a slight ding is the chicken and waffles - the chicken need a little more seasoning ( salt ) but overall, we were very happy with the combo.

And heck, I even liked the healthy pizza.

total bill with sodas was $50.

Yes, we will be back !

I was shopping at the nearby Centennial Center as I do pretty much every week and even though there are many food options within the shopping center, I was bored with those options at the moment. I decided to pull up places on the good ole yelp app and came across Above the Crust. It's on Ann Rd across from Painted Desert, so not too far behind Centennial Center. Deciding to give Above the Crust a try, I stopped in and placed a order. They have so many good deals going on each day! It being Tuesday meant that I could get a large pizza free with the purchase of a large pizza and toppings an additional $2 each. I went with a large cheese and a large pepperoni and added a couple "Garlic Rolls" priced at .95 cents each. I really liked the taste of the pizza and the sauce on it. The rolls had a nice garlic and butter flavor on the outside, the inside was a bit too much bread that was tough. I prefer a more traditional knot personally. When I walked in, I was greeted with a friendly hello from all the employees and I was given a menu and a flyer that shows the current daily specials offered. 

Sunday and Monday ($32.95) - Large pizza, bucket of wings, 4 garlic rolls and a 2 liter of soda.

Two for Tuesday - Buy one large pizza get one free.

Wing Wednesday (24.95) - Sampler bucket of wings, choose up to 4 flavors.

Friday Special ($29.95) - Large pizza and a bucket of fingers.

Stromboli Saturday ($17.95) - Large pizza and any stromboli. 

Daily special ($5.95) - 2 slices and a drink.

They offer delivery and also offer sandwiches, salads and calzones.

Finally a solid option in my neck of the woods. I've never been to a Barro's Pizza until a few weeks ago when they opened up one a couple of miles from my house.

They have a spacious dining room with a self serve soda machine, including Diet Dr. Pepper, and one flat screen TV in one corner of the room. They might want to consider getting another TV. You order at the cashier and they bring your food to you. My wife and I go here when we don't feel like cooking.

Major kudos to Barro's Pizza for not price gouging on pasta like a lot of places. Seriously, I've been to casual restaurants that want to charge $10-$12 dollars for penne with meatballs. At Barro's, you can get a small plate for less than $4 dollars. And that's plenty to fill an adult up at lunch. I tried their Calzone for $8.95. It was okay, nothing to write home about. It included a couple of toppings. They certainly don't make the world's greatest pizza but it's decent and very economically priced. My wife loves the garlic bread, but it's a bit too garlicky for my taste. Note to management, start serving artichokes for pizza and don't chop those onions so small.

Most of the time my wife and I spend about $7-$12 dollars to eat here unless we order a pizza. They have sandwiches which I haven't tried yet. I am eating my way thru their entire menu so I'll eventually try all their offerings.

Spoon is easily one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. For fine dining, I put them in the top five.
Been here four or five times now just to make sure I was not dreaming. But for sure this is a solid four stars and edging on five. A few subtle enhancements could tip the scale to 5.
Dcor is nice and trendy with several seating areas including a great bar.  Service includes John the top sommelier in the area, usually two hostesses, well-mannered servers and great bartenders. Service is prompt and a drink order results in libations within 5 minutes along with a choice of waters. There is a very ample selection of cocktails and wines by the bottle or glass.
I should mention there is a prompt and courteous valet service as another notch up the service pyramid.
Next the wonderful bread basket with warm selections of biscuits, awesome cornbread and ciabatta or some other artesian bread with sugar or honey butter to complement. We usually need a second basket as a testament.
The short menu is a design to keep choices interesting but not drone on, the ingredients fresh, the food delicious and it changes often enough to keep regulars coming back.
Seafood is my favorite here in appetizer and entre, but the soups and salads are fresh and outstanding as well. A very well enjoyed appetizer choice from the other night we had the 'bacon and eggs' appetizer which was seared pork belly, 5 minute egg (just right) sauted spinach, and hollandaise. Also we had the crispy duck confit which was a fabulous set of ingredients of crispy duck, 3 grain salad, Indian spices, goat cheese, cucumber yogurt, and toasted almonds. Almost sounds like decadence and just about was.
Around the tale we had the shellfish pappardelle; Alaskan black cod; cassoulet which interestingly was comprised of roasted pork, chicken sausage, duck confit, braised cannellini + cranberry beans, herbed bread crumbs, and farm egg. This was 'dryer' version of cassoulet a French peasants, style stew.
We have tried many other appetizers and entrees on our other visits and they all were as wonderful as these I mention here. All had the same complexity of ingredients, preparations, with flavors all overwhelmingly pleasing to the senses.

I'v been watching Cake Boss for years now and after my experiences at Carlo's Bake Shop I have come to the conclusion that Buddy and the Bakery is a case of a TV show making things look way better than they actually are. One thing I noticed from the show is that Buddy excels at making Cakes LOOK amazing but have you noticed everything is produced from sheet cake? There's no real skill at baking a sheet cake, even my 4 year old Niece can do that.

Visiting on a Tuesday evening the Bakery wasn't as busy as I expected so if you don't want to wait long this is the time to come!
The ordering system is all over the place and there are three, yes THREE lines for the whole ordering process:

1. Line to get into the Shop.
2. Line to order.

You're then stood awkwardly hanging around the till to have your name called to check your order is correct before then waiting again to have your name called again.

3. Line to pay.

The items myself and my Sister In Law ordered were extremely underwhelming.

- Caramel Cupcake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carlos-bake-shop-las-vegas#z99RKrkzTHMyAvPytNK2Pg). Cupcake was dry and there was barely any Caramel flavor. The sponge itself was Vanilla with a lightly Caramel flavored whipped Cream Frosting and a blob of Chocolate.

- Caramel Pecan Cookie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carlos-bake-shop-las-vegas#UMNG2Ovvk7h25q7uIl723w)  Crumbly, Sweet, Buttery. My favorite of the items I got.

- Jelly filled Cookie (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/carlos-bake-shop-las-vegas#QRUgV7htWb05IsFC77sHdg). Tasteless, dry.

My Sister In Law didn't like the items she got either - Chocolate Cupcake and Chocolate Brownie. She said that the Cupcake went in the trash after 2 bites and the Brownies I made her just a few days before we ''a million times better''.

Sorry Buddy, just not feeling this.

I'm mortified!  I've never written a review of the Farm at South Mountain?  I'm not sure how this is even possible!

I go here so often that this might actually be my favorite place in Phoenix to go for a relaxing cool/warm Saturday or Sunday afternoon in PHoenix.  In fact, I think I'm headed there momentarily.

Many people write reviews for the various "businesses" at the Farm on South Mountain on the wrong Business/Venue pages.  But I guess this listing is a catch-all for everything.  Let's see if I can help people get this clear.  I really want to point that the Farm at South Mountain has several "businesses" and venues listed on Yelp.  You can go here for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  You can have your baby shower here or your 200+ person wedding and reception here.  You can hold a corporate event in "Stoned Grove" area around an outdoor pizza oven or you can have an intimate dinner under mature trees with glimmers of stars at night at Quiessence.  This place is a one stop shop for everything simple and beautiful in the out of doors.  I've written reviews for a few of the places on the farm and I will let those reviews speak for themselves.  I've posted pics too... 

One of the things that the Yelping community might appreciate knowing is that you should visit their website for special events.  Sometimes, they have special Farm dinners.  Sometimes there's a special holiday dinner or lunch.  For instance, I know for Valentine weekend, they have Valentine Dinners and Picnic lunches.  

Here are my reviews of places on the farm:

Maya's Farm (At the end of the Farm Drive and directly North.)
Organic Certified Farm.  See them at the Farm on Sunday mornings.  Phoenix Public Market on Saturdays and also get on their CSA)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz/mayas-farm-phoenix#hrid:5dPGtdn4SQIClbJ_uIe1zw

Succulentia (it is in the green house on the north side of the farm, back by Maya's garden House)
http://www.yelp.com/biz/succulentia-phoenix#hrid:Z91CIQ4jVqF9RG3HrRe22w

The Farm Kitchen 
(Lunch/Brunch and is the closest to the Picnic Tables.  you see it immediately as you enter the farm, north of  "The Farm Driveway".)
http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-farm-kitchen-phoenix#hrid:7w3mgerwC9Yqd_b1amkDjA/src:self

Morning Glory 
(Breakfast only, but the patio is a nice place to rent for an event.  Go All the way to the end of the Farm Drive and YOu'll find it.)
http://www.yelp.com/biz/morning-glory-cafe-phoenix#hrid:yzI8RxBsNlKndP1HMQ0Q6A


There are a few other businesses on the Farm listed on Yelp
Weddings:
(I am sure there was a wedding listing on Yelp for the FASM because I used to check in to it accidentally when I first started Yelping.  If I find it, I will update)

Quiessence (I haven't written a reveiw of this either.  SMH!!):
http://www.yelp.com/biz/quiessence-restaurant-phoenix

Botanica (Been here once, but no review)
http://www.yelp.com/biz/botanica-phoenix-3

This is a great place to visit after you've completed a Hike on South Mountain too.  Enjoy.  Thank me later.

Wow, generally speaking, this is probably one of the most crooked places I've been to in Vegas! Please note, do not buy the Groupon here, you will get hoodwinked!! I've never had so much trouble using one until I came to this spot.

First, I would like to say that the employees are not at fault for the confusion, I think the owner of this location is the main culprit in the poor customer service. They are creating ridiculous rules for their customers. So the groupon is for 5 for 10. On my first visit, the tall guy wouldn't add tax into the total price of the meal. I was like "fine". I was able to macguyver my ordering until the total before tax was 9.98. They guy was like "our minimum is 10 dollars before you can use it" I was thinking "what a great way to nickel and dime your customers"! The tall guy was rude and confrontational to a customer in front of me.


The next day, I came back to use up the groupon and fortunately the tall guy wasn't working at that time. I wasn't impressed with the food during the last visit, so just decided to order sides and dessert. I was then told that I could not use the groupon because it was not a "food item"....
...
.......
..............

So ice cream and sides aren't food? Apparently not I guess. He then told me the groupon is available only for the numbered items, 1-14, on the menu, no sides, drinks, salads or anything else..

I was about to bust out my Cris Carter, "Cmon man!"
The shorter guy with glasses proceeded to apologize saying those are the rules set by the management there. I understood.

Food wise, there is nothing to talk about here, everything is mediocre. Very bland and disappointing. I do have to say the Rose tea was really good.

I've done the math here. Mediocre food + shady, non-customer oriented iron handed management with a concern only with a bottom line = 2 stars!! And I thought I was being generous. In the words of Terminus "Never again".

Ah, Vegas. The life of excess. And, holy shit, did Encore do it right. Everything about this casino is amazing, from the smell pumped in through the vents, even to the cocktail napkins - which are by far the best cocktail napkins I've ever seen at a casino. That's why it's so fitting that their steakhouse is named after Botero, an artist whose signature is very, very rotund people in his paintings and sculptures.

Yes - I gave the shrimp cocktail place in Vegas five stars, I even gave the OC Fair five stars. So why only four at Botero? Well, because I also gave five stars to Del Frisco's in Vegas, and the steak and experience here just didn't match it.

I must say though, the decor of the restaurant is pretty damn cool though. With all the tables set up around one of Botero's largest sculptures or one of the largest ladies. We ended up seated right next to her ass, which made me feel better about myself with every bite of my calorie overloaded steak. Even the silverware is custom made to have that plump, Botero-esque feel.

Now, let's get down to the food and drinks. I had the ribeye with chimichurri on it, which was...pretty good. But you know what, I really should have gone without the chimichurri it didn't add anything good to the steak. What was absolutely delicious though was the mac n' cheese. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this was the absolute best mac n' cheese I've ever had in my life. I doubt this is the sort of establishment where you could just go in and order the mac n' cheese, but if you could....this would be on my list of stops in Vegas every time.

The desserts all seemed to focus on presentation more than taste. But it's actually kind of fun eating a bon bon lollipop after a schmancy dinner. (Just don't remind yourself that you paid $22 for a few bon bons.)

Worth the $300 pricetag for a dinner for two? Sure, you're in Vegas. You're damn right it's worth it.

Thumbs Up:
-Fab art from Botero as far as the eye can see.
-Your self esteem will skyrocket if you're seated next to the fat lady sculpture.
-Mac N' Cheese. Holy mother of god. Amazing.
-Of course, amazing service. You're at a Wynn property. Duh.

Thumbs Down:
-You know, it's really not bad, just as far as Vegas steakhouses go - it's not as good as Del Frisco's.

AVOID this place at all costs.  I've never been treated so disrespectful in my entire life. 

Came here last night with 3 friends after having dinner at Squid Ink since it's the only bar in the area.  Ordered a beer for myself and 2 of my friends and was promptly told that in order to get the drinks I would need to surrender my keys.  Ok... I told them and I gave them my keys even though I didn't even bring my car here.  My friends and I ordered shots, then went on the dance floor and goofed around having a good time.  When I went to order another drink I was told by the waitress that I was "too drunk."  "Excuse me?" I asked her, "I've had 2 drinks!"  When I asked for my keys back she just flatly told me, "No." I went to find a manager and a burly doorman asked me what was my "problem." I told him my problem was I was being refused service and I just wanted to get my keys and get out of this crappy bar.  He told me I would get my keys as soon as a cab got here. I told him a cab was on the way, and that never in my life had I been treated like a common criminal for doing nothing wrong!  I told him obviously you people don't want my business and I won't ever return.  That's when the doorman told me, "That's fine, fags like you aren't welcome here." That's when I completely lost my shit.  After the cab arrived I asked for my keys back. I was told, "you're just planning on taking the cab to your car." I told him my car was at home and I needed my keys to get into my house! He finally thew the keys at me and I got the heck out of there.

I have no idea where the people come off treating someone like that.  I did nothing wrong and was called a hateful word and was treated like a common criminal. And my tab came to around $25 for 3 beers. Definitely avoid this place.

Imagine two college roommates, one an all-american kid raised on classic fast food fare, the other a Korean foreign exchange student with an overprotective mom preparing meals weekly from home, and then picture some pothead next door raiding their refrigerator one night and throwing their leftovers together in one massive pile for a meal of his own.  That may have been my first impression upon glancing at the menu, but after finishing my first meal here I am convinced this is the work of some evil mad culinary genius.       

Went and checked out this place over lunch with a friend and decided to sample their two most popular items: the #1 (Beef Buldogi hotdog)  and the Angry Kimchi Fries

The beef bulgogi dog is a 100% premium beef dog covered with an avalanche of Asian cole slaw, grilled onions, generous strips of beef bulgogi (marinated beef with Korean seasonings, finished off with a dusting of sesame seeds and a light drizzle of house mayo.   The first bite of any hot dog usually begins with a naked end devoid of bread or toppings, and one can tell that the Buldogi dog has been grilled to that perfect smokey char with a nice firm "snap" of the casing that explodes with mouthwatering flavor.  The contrast in textures and flavors from the tender bulgogi, crispy slaw, smokey onions, creamy mayo, and toasted sesame seeds surprisingly round out one another in harmonious balance.

The angry kimchi fries was a whole other beast.  Wheras the oxtail chili cheese fries at Bachi Burger look better than they taste, the Angry fries here taste better than they look.  Start with a bed of sweet potato fries, add a layer of pork bulgogi, throw in some cooked kimchi and melted cheese with diced green onion and jalapeno, and then finishing the whole concoction with a sunny side egg, I found myself unable to stop with each progressive bite since something so wrong apparently seemed so right!  There's a stroke of brilliance with the choice of sweet potato for the starch since the natural sugar cuts through all the spicy and savory components and the richness from the cheese and runny egg yolk cleverly binds all the distinct bold flavors together  (pro-tip: break the yolk immediately upon being served otherwise the heat from the other ingredients will continue to cook the egg)

If I had one minor critique, it would be the lack of beer and the ambience inside is a bit drab since I think the food has heavy flavors that go well with beer in the company of friends with a sporting event in the background since I would totally attend any stadium or ballpark which served these items.    It looks like they may have attempted to expand previously but the other location appears closed on yelp, but hopefully their following will grow to be successful on a repeat attempt in the future.

In a word, Twist.  

The mere idea of the word is enough to send your token foodie's stomach into a conniption fit of pure desire.  The mere whisper of the word is enough to trigger endless blogging and tweeting due to sheer sweaty-handed anticipation.  The mere realization of the word is enough a road trip all the way to Lost Wages to see what all the fuss is about.  

And so it was done.  Off to the south Las Vegas strip we would go in search of langostine (among other things), prepared in the manner of a man who pretty much put langostine on the map.  

Being the gastronomic simpleton that I am, I decided I couldn't pass up a grand opening invite to the first ever dinner service at Twist by Pierre Gagnaire (December 5, 2009).  But in lieu of a ginormous appetite, what I really should've packed was my brain.  Food this complex, this multi-layered, and this (pardon my crude undertone) "weird", simply can't just be engulfed.  It requires several hours of thinking, ruminating, pondering or whatever-the-hell-it-takes to justify paying $400 a head for arguably one of the fanciest and most thought-out meal you'd ever dream of having this west of the Mississippi.  It's been days since engulfing this meal and I STILL can't wrap my head around it (and my stomach definitely had its work cut out for it too).

Surprisingly, it took nearly 5 hours to complete this marathon of a 6-course tasting menu plus 6 courses of added appetizer supplements (note: every single thing I ate is pictorially posted here).  And don't you dare go on thinking that I'm slow and that 12 courses aren't all that much, because under Pierre Gagniere's roof, that really means like 36 presentations.  Do the math.  

Throughout this marathon dinner complete with cocktails and fine wine, Voss water and a few $8 diet cokes sprinkled in "here and there", I began to realize the perplexity as this:  Pierre Gagnaire is, quite truthfully, an enigma of a man.  Forget that he's Michelin starred-this, iconoclastic-that.  Forget that he practically invented all that we have come to realize is "fusion" cuisine.  And just forget that his so-called eponymous "other" location on Rue. St. Balzac near the Champps Elysees is thought of as being the "3rd best restaurant" in the world by Restaurant Magazine (El Bulli in Spain is the 1st).

Pierre Gagnaire creates an inspiring vision for this type of weird food, which is, not surprisingly, just weirdly delicious.  He's even a lovable weird guy himself, so appropriately charming and entertaining us like a "crazy uncle" might do during his brief cameo at our table.

And as we were appropriately informed by our server David, the whole idea is to "taste and experience" all the ingredients which God put on this earth, which might occasionally occur in 1 singular dish.  This is most evident in the first of 3 presentations of Gagnaire's "Shellfish Royale" - somewhat of an oyster extravaganza with a backdrop of toasted beef gele and shallots, as well as his last presentation of "King Sea Bream", a curiously concoction of a "bonito-shellfish gele" with mozzarella ice cream.  I loved the fact seared scallops aren't even safe from Gagnaire's innovative antics as "black olive gelee" provides a certain Mediterranean setting, but then squab breast and foie gras come in to steal the show.  The end result of these seemingly contradictory flavor combinations and layers is this:  each bite resembles something that you have never ever tasted, with few ways to describe them, save for these vague examples --  My first time eating Pierre Gagnaire cuisine allowed me to taste 5 different representations of the langostine, including the unmistakable "head", allowed me to taste (and like) seafood mixed with cheese mixed with meat, and allowed me to eat something that tasted like the splendor that exists in a tidepool.  

Overall, do I have any idea what this means?  Not on your life.  The only thing I can muster up is that a dinner under Pierre Gagnaire's roof is absolutely positively unlike any other eating experience you will ever have.  Ever.  Go there, and you will see.  The originality of it ensures that you cannot and will not be disappointed.

From the Light Group; creators of some of the most impressive mega clubs, ultra lounges, and restaurants in Vegas, Miami, and Dubai so yes, it's impressive, contemporary, and trendy.  Smoke and mirrors.

Bottom line, you're paying for beautiful plates of "contemporary" cuisine unjustified by the quality of the ingredients.  In other words, want to impress a non foodie, this is your kind of place.

To start, the "Hot Rocks" (Japanese style of cooking thin slices of beef on super heated stones), fun but it's USDA choice at best and a chewier sirloin cut.  Not much internal fat, marinated in an acidic ponzu, olive oil mix causes the protein to tighten up even further.   Fun and visually cool but misses the mark. The tuna tartare, much better.  Deconstructed at service, mix everything up to enjoy.  Everyday sushi grade tuna mixed with well toasted pine nuts, crisp Asian pair and some soy with a hint of horseradish on toast points.  Refreshing and texturally interesting.

For mains, no mention is made on the quality or aging of the beef.  It appears to be USDA top choice, not prime.  Steaks are well trimmed.  Cooking temperatures off.  The tomahawk rib eye cooked mid well when ordered mid rare (twice) was OK.  Not as tender as it should be.  Good bitterness from the wood burring grill but lacking intense beef flavor of a well aged piece of beef.  The menu says 24oz but a lot of that weight is the bone.  Maybe 12oz of actual beef.  The bone in Brooklyn fillet is OK.  Cooked to temperature.  The bone, slightly cut away from the beef for looks fails to impart sufficient flavor as dry aged versions of the same cut.  

Pet peeve:  they put a pat of COLD butter on top of the steak.  Am I supposed to rub it around in the beef drippings and make my own sauce?

Correct sides.  No real standouts.

Good happy hour where you can try scaled down versions of the starters for $9.

Good wine list.  High Vegas resort pricing.

Smoke and mirrors a bad thing?  Hey, you're in Vegas aren't you?

On a recent trip to Las Vegas we stayed at The Cosmo for two nights. I had stayed there once before and wasn't a fan but had a much better experience this time around. Our room was beautiful. It had a balcony and a huge tub over looking a great view of Vegas. The room was very nicely decorated with a Jonathan Adler feel. 

The gym had great equipment and a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. But they did not offer bottled water, only a water machine with cups, which is not easy to drink while working out. 

There aren't that many breakfast options, which I found frustrating. The main breakfast restaurant had a long wait each morning and the grab and go food only consisted of pastries and coffees. Nothing healthy or fresh. 

The restaurant options in the hotel are quite vast for lunch and dinner. Milos is by far my favorite for lunch and dinner. We also had a nice lunch at China Poblano. 

*Tip: Milos offers food to go, so if you want to eat dinner in your car on your way back to LA get Milos to go rather than having to stop for fast food!

I love Mom and Pop run businesses. 

I was driving along Chandler Boulevard, saw the sign "Family Run Business" and decided to stop.  

There is so much homogeneity in our dinning experience today. Everything is so cookie cutter. 

Yet with that uniformity comes time tested (and test lab) food tastes, that makes us come back for more -- no matter which city or town we find ourselves in. 

But if you are tired of the "same old, same old" as I am, you keep your eye open for these places. Don't get me wrong Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ isn't perfect, but it's a nice change. 

Last night I ordered their Combo Dinner.  That's two specialty smoked meats, two sides, a soft drink and your choice of breads. I went with the Brisket, smoke polish sausage, garlic mash, apple cobbler and jalapeo corn bread for $10.99. They do the same thing for lunch at $7.99. 

I found Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ "A-Okay" and Three Stars good. The meat had a nice smokey taste that lasted after my meal, while the sides were little bland and the corn bread had no kick. BTW, what's with all this 4 Sq signage? I didn't even know they were still in business. LOL

Located inside of the diviest of dive bars, but that's not the issue to us - we enjoy a good dingy dive bar.

We came here for 2 reasons:
1. I had an emergency late night pizza craving. 
2. This was the only place open past 12am that had decent reviews (namely because Guy Fieri recommended them on Triple D.)

I'm just going to put this boldly out there - the pizza was a lie. 

I can't necessarily state that Guy is lie on this one, because I bet this place used to be good, then triple D aires, then the word gets out, then the hype man takes the stage, then they cut massive ingredients and quality to make a profit. Right. It's a sad tune we're all too familiar with. 

The pizza itself was very dry and I can honestly state it was pretty much all thick, dense dough. The dough wasn't even special or memorable - not even slightly sweet or anything that would make it stand out. The tomato sauce was barely noticeable and it wasn't robust, or striking in flavor. The cheese was also extremely limited as well. Everything fell seriously flat on our taste buds.

The toppings were all few and very far between. The meats were sparse and standard, nothing to holler home about. There were tiny specs here and there with spinach. Seriously!? How expensive is spinach, that you can't even hook an honest paying customer up with it? It was truly nonexistent.

Let me ask you this, why did we get the pizza with no love? I think my theory is concrete and valid. 

Here's what we regretted ordering:
Fatboy "not so wee" Pizza: $21
- subbed sausage for spinach 
- subbed salami for ricotta 
- this pizza advertised basil yet they some how forgot the basil? (forgot? or, on purpose... my paranoia is beginning to wonder...)

Pit BBQ Wings: $8 (single = 10pcs?)
- hahahahaha they either, a.) Skimped us, or, b.) Don't know how to count - either way, that's totally annoying and frustrating when you pay for 10 wings and expect 10 wings, but get 9. 
(To be fair- the bbq sauce was robust & the wings were well sauced)

Ranch: free 
- very runny and watery 

It's pathetic that I had a better pizza slice at Sbarro in the mall the other day - the red pizza sauce they had there was full of life and flavor, plus they probably put 1 handful of spinach on that 1 slice of pizza. Sadly, that's the opposite of Naked Pizza.

The only thing they got going for them is this: open until 3am. 

$31 bill for a disappointing pizza dinner is not cool, not cool at all. We wasted our time and our dime.

I got a reputation around Yelp when it comes to Ramen. I've eaten at every major Ramen-Ya on the West coast, so I got a lot of credibility when it comes to recognizing a good bowl of Ramen. So my assessment is that: SHOKU RAMEN-YA doesn't have a good bowl of Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen...SHOKU has a GREAT bowl of Hakata Tonkotsu. 

Things have changed a lot here in the last month. I came here over a month ago during their soft opening,  and the manager was still training the cooks and servers to be more proficient. Today when I came to SHOKU, everything had been perfected. I have to congratulate the new manager(Ehren) for working non-stop around the clock, and dedicating his whole life into turning this place into one of the best Ramen-Yas in Las Vegas. The flavor of the Hakata Tonkotsu was a world of difference from last month! You can really taste the pork bones and marrow from them preparing the broth all day long in that traditional Kyushu style. 

The Charsu has changed as well. It's very soft, fatty, and tender like the ones you get at Onizuka Street. I loved it! 

Unlike 99% of the Ramen-Yas in LV, SHOKU actually has a Hanjuku Egg as one of their add ons. This is big! This really BIG!  Monta, Sora, and Shuseki only have normal medium-boiled eggs. A Hanjuku egg needs a lot of work to prepare correctly. It needs to be boiled for exactly 7 minutes to preserve it's extremely runny nature, then it must be instantly placed into ice water or the egg will continue to cook itself and the yolk will be ruined.Afterwards it's transferred to a mixture of shoyu, sugar, and sometimes vinegar. It will then be marinated for many hours. SHOKU is the only Ramen-Ya in Vegas that features this style of egg. It's a very rare delicacy here in LV. 

The Bacon Fried rice was the best Japanese fried rice I have ever had. Better than Monta...Better than Yagyu Yakinku..Better than Shuseki. The Bacon Rice here at SHOKU RAMEN-YA is a perfect fusion blend of flavors. It has the buttery qualities of Hibachi Fried Rice(ex-Benihana), but with much stronger and unique added flavors. Because SHOKU is a Bachi Burger spinoff, their cooks do fusion better than anyone. 

The manager of this restaurant told me that in a few weeks they will add Tan Tan Men onto the menu. I was like HOLY SH!T THIS IS HEAVY! Every Yelper knows that Tan Tan Men is my favorite Ramen variation in the world. I've been to every major Ramen-ya on the westcoast and only like 8 of them had Tan Tan Men. For those who don't know, Tan Tan Men is a very difficult dish to master for any chef. That's why there are Ramen-Yas that specifically specialized in ONLY Tan Tan Men. I've been to Chinese-Japanese Ramen houses where TTM was the only thing on the menu because the chef needed to put all his attention in only that one thing. I can't wait to see the SHOKU variation of Tan Tan Men. Ehren is one of the most talented restaurant managers in Las Vegas, and I'm confident that his staff can master this difficult variation. 

I encourage all the Nisei, Sansei, and Yonsei to come eat here, especially if you are from Hawaii. Every Japanese born in Hawaii I have spoken to have told me that SHOKU is one of the best Ramen-Yas on the mainland. There is something about the flavors here at SHOKU that make Hawaiians happy. I know that many of my Japanese-Hawaiian Yelp friends would love this place. 

Also, remember that this is a Kyushu style Ramen-Ya so it would be a travesty to order something that wasn't Tonkotsu. You don't go to a Sapporo Ramen house and not order the Miso. You don't got to a Tokyo Ramen house and not order the Shoyu. You don't go to a Chinese-Japanese Ramen house and not order the Tan Tan Men. And you defiantly should not go to a Hakata Ramen-Ya and not get the Tonkotsu. Tonkotsu is the signature dish of Hakata, Kyushu.

This Auntie Anne's is located inside the food court at Red Rock Station. It opened a few months back and received some good reviews so hubby and I stopped by to try for ourselves. For a tiny pretzel shop they had a a nice variety of things on the menu, including vegan-friendly options. 

When it comes to pretzels they offer the following:
Plain
Garlic
Jalapeno
Cinnamon Sugar
Pepperoni
Raisin
Sesame
Sweet Almond
Honey Whole Grain
Sour Cream and Onion

Pretzel Stix and Pretzel Nuggets come either salted or in cinnamon sugar. They also have Pretzel Dogs that come in sizes mini, regular and jumbo.

Dipping Sauces:
Cheese 
Melted Cheese 
Hot Salsa Cheese
Marinara
Caramel 
Sweet Mustard
Light Cream Cheese
Sweet Glaze

I ordered a "Sour Cream and Onion" and "Jalapeno" pretzel. They were priced at $3.49 each. I also ordered 2 melted cheese dips priced at 75 cents each. The cashier was very friendly and they had samples out on the counter. One thing I did like is the cashier asked if I wanted my pretzels salted or unsalted. I don't like salt on my pretzel and some places have it already on the pretzel and I get stuck picking it off, at least here I had the option to have it with or without. The sour cream and onion pretzel was just ok. It wasn't as soft and warm like I'm used to and it could have used more of the sour cream and onion on it. The jalapeno pretzel was pretty good, but again on the dry side. They weren't stingy with the jalapenos which was nice, but it seemed like the pretzel wasn't as fresh as it could have been. The melted cheese dip wasn't melted at all. I think she gave me the regular cheese dips instead. I didn't mind the regular cheese dip however the cheese being warm would have been more to my liking. Since I get coupons for Auntie Anne's I will be back, but I can't see paying full price again if it isn't going to be hot and fresher.

"What on earth is a pasty?!" and "Where on earth was it located?!" These were burning questions that became an obsession until I couldn't take it anymore. The juvenile humor in me kept thinking of nipple tassles and it being located near the infamous Green Door only fueled my misconception. Seeing this place given 4.5 stars, mostly from respectable Elites made it too irresistible for me. I didn't want to miss the train!
I had the darnedest time finding CP inside the vast commercial center and even gave up after driving around aimlessly the first time. But I was a determined little you-know-what so I did a little more research and found it. Oh happy day! It's located next to the green storefront of Komol. A dark venue inside with a large bar and church pews with special molded iron barstools and a history lesson on the tin miners who originated the pasty. It holds true that as a "hole in the wall" type of establishment,  this place has excellent food that draws all types of foodies. 
My daughter who is a foodie in the making ordered the OGGIE...the very first pasty on the menu. It's filled with steak, potatoes and rutabaga served with a wine sauce. Tender pieces of beef with soft potatoes and the bright pop of the rutabaga. Let's just say, she cleaned her dish with not a crumb left.
I decided to make up for not finding it the first time, by ordering 2 pasties. The Pilgrim and the Chicken Tikka Masala. The Pilgrim is taking the best Thanksgiving leftovers and rolling it up in a flakey crust and the best part is having ample gravy and cranberry sauce to go with it (they will offer more upon asking). The Chicken Tikka Masala would rival any good Indian restaurant and served with a nice mint yogurt. Tender chicken breast so full of flavor and it tastes good even after sitting in the fridge a few days and reheated.
These pasties are all handcrafted and made ahead of time then par-baked for 90 minutes. When you order, they are finished in the oven, then served neatly sliced in half with a perfect crust in every bite.
Be sure to save room for the Shirley Temple pudding because it is life changing. It's served HOT in a mini caldron that is like 900 degrees which carmelized the sides of the pudding into a chewy crust, and you must get it with vanilla ice cream. Imported british treacle cake (just don't smell it lol) is so moist and has this toffee sauce on top that comes to you bubbling...careful not to burn your mouth.
Bring everyone you know, they will thank you for introducing this unique eat to them. If they can't make it, you can get any pasty par-baked and taken home. Believe the hype!

I love the 51 because, many years ago, I managed to lose a police helicopter that was following and tracking me with it's spotlight, in the middle of the night. I felt like James Fucking Bond 007. First of all because I have 0 respect for law enforcement officers and their Nazi-like "just following orders" arrests of people for victimless crimes, followed by locking them in government cages. Second of all, because I knew that the statistical chances of me ever being tailed by a Police helicopter and managing to lose it, at any time again in my entire life, approached 0. Third, because I spontaneously adapted an idea from an entirely different field.

Story time! Pull up a chair.

The setting: mid-late 1990's. Perhaps around 1996, 1997, when there was massive construction going on, on the 51. I lived downtown, on Roosevelt back then. Roosevelt then was NOTHING like it is now - most foot traffic was crack heads and transvestite hookers. But whatever, I'm from NY and I felt right at home. We're a tough breed. 

I had spent the evening visiting some people who were friends at the time -  if you remember The Congo, after it turned into the first Internet coffee house ("cyber cafe") in the Valley - it was the couple that made that happen.

It was late at night. I was driving home, tired. I just wanted to get home and into bed, so I was speeding. A lot. Next thing I know, there are light flashing all over my car. I look behind me and see nothing. Roll down the window and look up, thinking I'm about to be abducted by aliens in a Betty and Barny Hill type scenario. Nope! Just the Popos! They had their spotlight on me and were ordering me to pull over on the megaphone. 

First thought: Oh shit. I'm going to jail tonight. I had probably been smoking some high grade indoor sensimillia or something similar all evening. I know, dumb to do that and drive. I'm much more responsible now, so if you want to give me a hard time for being a dumbass at the age of 23, go right ahead and I'll probably agree with you - I was a with an outsized ego because I was... a computer programmer at the time. Sounds dorky but unless you've been in that world, you have no idea of the massively exaggerated sense of self worth a kick ass software developer can have. Now that I truly am that awesome, I look back and laugh. ;)

Anyway, I digress, Back to my police problem.

Brainstorm! Amazing what the chemically altered mind can come up with. 

I've always had an interest in military tactics and strategy, even though I never joined any army. I'm a history buff, and it makes history come alive. Only I didn't learn this tactic by reading about ancient armies prepping the battle field, or reading about their troop formations, or reading one of my all time favorites, Sun Tzu. I learned it by watching the Robotech and Macross cartoons. 

I remembered a tactic called Fokker's Feint, named after a German WWI flying ace. In a nutshell - you're being chased. You gain speed but then slow down rapidly, before your opponent in the dogfight has a chance to respond. He zooms past you, you get behind, and now he's in your gunsights.

Since my car wasn't equipped with heat seeking missile launchers, lasers, or other cool accessories, just a CD player, shooting it down wasn't really an option. 

Instead, a plan came together. The best part was, I realized that if it failed, they'd have no idea of what I was trying to do, so I had nothing to lose. Go big or go home! Or in this case probably directly to jail, not passing go and not collecting $200.

At the time, the 51 was under construction Well, lucky for me, this construction involved a long stretch of the 51 that was just ahead of me having no street lights at all. Also, there was an exit coming up - if I recall correctly it was somewhere between Northern and Bethany Home.  I'm thinking Glendale, but as I mentioned, I wasn't exactly sober and this is going back a ways, so I don't recall.

Calculations going through my mind: I am going fast. (prob 90+). Helicopter going same speed. Tracked by helicopter with spotlight, which uses my headlights to tell where I am. Street lights which illuminate the freeway - off. I have one chance to do this right.

I sped up another 15 MPH so I was going past 100. Helicopter speeds up to follow, megaphone guy goes nuts, telling me to pull over. Then.... as I approach the freeway exit.... I turn off the car headlights, slam on the brakes, and pull off the exit. I watch as the helicopter zooms right past me, down the freeway. It then starts circling the freeway to figure out where I went - I watched, parked with my lights out in a parking lot right off the freeway. 

My windows were rolled down and I'm pretty sure I heard helicopter guy drop the F bomb over the megaphone. I waited for the flying pigs to leave, then took city streets the rest of the way home, careful to drive the speed limit and obey all traffic laws. 

Whew.

It was a little quiet at work so I decided it was a good day to have an offsite lunch. I yelped new spots in Chinatown.

Yes, this is the old Anime place, and the maid place which I did not get to try. It is next door to Kaya Sushi. 

We ordered the Roti to start and it was one of the best in Las Vegas, next to Island Malaysian and Veggie House. It was freshly sauteed and fluffy. The sauce was slightly spicy but nothing too fancy (because the Roti was the star). 

I read the restaurant was opened by Thai people so I was hesitant about ordering anything not Thai or Southeast Asian, but my Ramen craving was still going strong, so I had to try their Tonkatsu Ramen. The ramen was the thin noodle kind, with a really tasty, savory and sticky broth. The pork was tender, sliced really thin, and was surprisingly good. The major difference was that there were fried shallots added, and that totally changed the flavor profile, in a good way.   

I was also able to try a slice of the roasted pork from another noodle soup dish, and again, it was surprisingly good, sliced thin and flavorful. 

Side note, their entire menu is pictorial, so that made it really easy to pick what to order! 

I would absolutely come back... to try the other menu items, as well as the Roti again!

Met up with some fellow Yelpers at Short Leash Dog Sit Stay UYE, now earlier in the year I was introduced to Short Leash in the same manor, but it was in an alley off Central and Camelback at a food truck and they were an instant hit with me! Since then Short Leash has expanded/ added an actually restaurant, and we were there to check them out! 

I found my group pretty quick and then after I settled in my seat, and got my date situated (my 8 month old grandson)  I looked around the joint, I like it, it has a nice opened feel, maybe a little hipster, but I dig it!

I knew before I got there what I wanted, I wanted The Bear, I had a taste of it awhile back and had been craving it since then! 

Let's stop for a minute and discuss the Bear, where did they come up with this idea? Who said let's make a hot dog, and then place it on naan bread, then top it with smoked Gouda, Bacon, Bbq Sauce, Peanut Butter and some Cracker Jacks for kicks! Whose idea was this, and who 2nd it?????  I know if I came to the table with this for my kids, they would think I was smoking something! Short Leash Dogs are geniuses!  

The Bear is amazing!!! My dog was a brat, and it was smothered in bbq sauce, peanut butter, Gouda cheese, BACON and yes even the cracker jacks and blanketed in Naan bread!! This is the most amazing hot dog I have had so far!  Just mind blowing how the combinations of everything blend together. Also my bear came with a nice little green salad, eating the salad made me feel less guilty about eating the dog haha got some healthy stuff with it! 

For the little guy I ordered the corn dog bites, though he only ate 1  1/2, he dug the corn meal crust of the dog, devoured that up quickly.  He has 6 teeth and knows how to use them. He wasn't a fan of the jalapeno cheese stuffed dog, but I can safely say, that's pretty banging dog!  Might have to try it out as a Moki, yes I think that's what I'll try next!  

Another great UYE, and Short Leash, you guys have a fan in me!! I will be back!

I gave away our card with 4 stamps at the end of the meal.  THAT'S how sure our group was that none of us would ever return.  

This isn't sushi in the Japanese sense.  These are crazy freakin rolls/inventions that contain some raw fish in, on or around them.  Calling this Japanese is very misleading.  The typical roll on the menu sounds like this:

"Tastes and smells like your bitchy ex-mother in law's 1st semester college sophomore roommate who did the whole lacrosse team on a dare and got Hepatitis C roll:  Baked inside out roll stuffed with eel, cream cheese, bbq sauce, avocado, super super super white tuna, chopped yellowtail and spicy tuna, shishito peppers, scallop, garlic and salmon on top with orgasm, yum yum, and fuck me in the ass sauce on the side."

As you can see, they used the whole "I Love Sushi" concept and took it way over the top.  This could be a potentially fun dinner (as many Yelp reviews can attest) trying all the insanity but there were enough misses to warrant my negativity.  It wasn't fun, but it sure was funny.  

- Sushi rice was off.  Slimy?  Low quality?  I don't know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.  I see a lot of reviews raving about sashimi though.
  
-Speaking of sauce...what's up with drenching sauce all over nigiri?  Several pieces of nigiri came with sauce on top as a default.  We actually had to request it without.  Freshness of the fish was ok.  None of us died afterwards.  

-Pretty sure that was shrimp cocktail drenched in a soy sauce base and topped with scallion advertised as amaebi. 

-1 order of green tea was not green but it might have been due to the lipstick contamination on the side of the cup.  The liquid was a very, very light brown.  The server claimed it was green tea despite my protest.  Magically, the next cup of tea was suddenly very green.  So that's where Dirk Arthur has been performing all this time!!

- I didn't know uni came in so many colors.  The most suspect pieces were left on the plate.  The server didn't even question it.  She just took them away like she knew.

- My native Japanese dinnermates found the tamago presentation to be hilarious.  A tamago house!

At least the unagi was good.  Congratulations on well cooked eel!  Have a good life.

Three words:  Fuck this place.  If it wasn't for the fact they carry gluten-free/dairy-free coconut milk Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream, Tamari Wheat-Free Soy Sauce, Hemp Milk, Boston  Baked Beans, Brown rice in bulk, Blueberry gluten-free waffles, and a variety of bulk spices and flours, I would never shop here.  With the exception of the checkout clerks, the rest of the staff is not only completely worthless, they are, for the most part, grumpy ass holes.  ESPECIALLY the managers.

I tried doing a special order one time to purchase a case of large bottles of Tamari soy sauce.  Haha, oh what a fail.  They never called me, like they said they would when it arrived, so I finally called to inquire.  "We've got it in", the manager said, "come on down.".  Sweet.  I get in my car, drive down there and what do you know, they don't have it.  Wtf?  The guy looked everywhere and 35mins later, we agreed it was lost and I ordered another case.  Well, 2 weeks later, again, no phone call on their part, I called and they said it was in.  When I got there I asked to open the box to check my order, and what do you know, they ordered the wrong product.  They ordered the low-sodium (which needs to be cooled) instead of the regular.  Fuck it, I took it anyway.

We have had to return four (4) packages of beef that went sour before the sell-by date.  FOUR!  Each time greeted by an unapologetic, seemingly annoyed manager.  We were never offered anything in exchange for our troubles.  The third time I told the guy that not only was he going to refund my $$, he would also be comping my package of fresh beef, which he did, but after a bit of an argument.

A few days ago I was in the store and asked the manager if he had any chocolate syrup other than "Fat-free / Sugar-free" syrup (loaded with Splenda!) and he sort of chuckled and said, "No, we're a health-food store", like a pompous cock.  I said to him, "well, real sugar is certainly better for you than fake chemical sweeter" to which he again chuckled and said, "whatever, I'll make sure to let our people know" in an extremely condescending manner.  I just laughed.  First, this guy can only be described as the opposite of healthy.  Second, their store is FULL of sugar candies, IN BULK!!  Third, Splenda is hardly "healthy" for you.  Fucking idiot.

So yeah, avoid this store, if you can.  Unfortunately, it would be more of a major inconvenience for me to avoid it, so I suffer the pain.  Oh, and don't bother asking a floor guy anything, they're COMPLETELY worthless as well.

How can I not give Marcellino five stars?

The food was fantastic - as was the experience.  We'd been hearing about Marcellino Ristorante for awhile but it wasn't until we were looking for a place to celebrate Mother's Day that we thought to check it out.

From the moment I called to make a reservation, we received the friendliest service ever!  I was told that they could take our group at 6:45 and that they'd have a live Opera Singer (specifically a Tenor) in house that night performing - what a treat!  Well - that's what I figured when they told me that.  (None of us were opera fans before and we still are not opera fans, but it did add to the experience!)

We were seated right away and Scott was our server.  He was attentive and patient with us, even when Jared had him repeat the specials several times.  Their homemade pasta specials looked incredible, but I stayed away... Instead, I enjoyed the Insalata Ortolana, a few bites of the Canestina Polenta (if you like polenta and you like mushrooms, get this - it's incredible), and I shared the Gamberi Affogtai entree with my mother-in-law-to-be.  We requested extra veggies instead of mashed potatoes and not only did they oblige, but the broccoli, cabbage, and asparagus we received were delicious!  The shrimp were magnificent as well - juicy and tender!  Oh - I have to also admit to having some of the 'special sauce' they serve with the bread basket... it is tangy and wonderful - if you go, you must try that too.  It's made with eggplant, olive oil, and red pepper I believe... yum!

Jared and his sister had a Caprese Salad (a bit overpriced at $12.95), the Paccatelli al Ragu (a bolognese pasta dish I believe), the Scaloppine al Gorganzola (a veal dish that he enjoyed but serving size was not as big as he'd wished for).  We finished off the meal with an Apple Galetta served with hazelnut gelato and a Panna Cotta (similar to flan).  While I had just a small taste of the apple one, I can report that it was delicious... and since Jared and his mom finished off the panna cotta, i'll assume it was not so bad either.

All of the above plus a pellegrino, a coffee, and a cappuccino for $159.85 before tip.  Note - no alcohol.

So, yes, we wish it was more affordable - but we'll be back without a doubt!

Fuck this place.

Yes, I said it and even after 6 years, I will still say it.

So the girls and I are on a tear it up Vegas weekend. All very cute and sessy gals for the record and all gals who appreciate the less than finer things in life like fake boobied strippers, over-priced drinks and titty bars. 

So we cab it over to the Crazy Horse Too after hearing that THIS was THE place to go. We roll up and instantly get static at the door. You can't come in without a date. Um, okay, well we are a bunch of girls with lots of money to spend? NO! But...? NO!

So we walk a few feet away and regroup while trying to keep the temper of one Drunky MaGoo down to a manageable level since the a-hole of a door guy was especially rude to this one girl in our group. I suggest grabbing a few guys and rollin in with them. I mean who cares, we can ditch them at the door but at least it gets us in. So we latch onto said guys and walk up.

Door guy says, NO!

I say, "You said dates, these are our dates. We are in love, let us in." (Mind you I'm drunk and his anger is amusing me at this point)

Door guy says, "fine you can come in, but that one stays out!" (pointing to my friend)

I say, "Come on, don't be THAT guy, did mama raise you to be THAT guy? She just really wants to see some boobs, surely you can relate."

Apparently he couldn't, but I also think he was suffering from mama abandonment issues and clearly wasn't loved enough as a child, but I digress...

He then decides that none of us should be allowed to come in. Fine, I'd rather not go if my friend is going to not be let in, so just give us our money back and we will go spend it elsewhere, right?

Apparently this is when the poor chap lost all sense of hearing as i became invisible and mute in his eyes.

"Excuse me, I said we'll go. Can you please just give us our money back?"

"Hello?"

"Umm"

"Yo!"

Retard Roy then starts smirking and it is quite clear that the four of us who "got in" will not be getting our money back, even though we technically never even entered the club. 

I then followed up with calls to the establishment the next day that were (to no surprise) never returned. Maybe they are in cahoots with Prime Time Shuttle as their customer service seems to be pretty dead on.

So if you are a girl don't go here. If you are a guy, have at it, but why waste your money on a place that won't let cute girls in who might actually go home with you for free. Just sayin.

FINALLY!! I've been waiting for this location to open f-o-r-e-v-e-r! With the location on the Strip closing, it couldn't have come at a better time. Walking in I saw the usual lines for adobada, asada, etc. You have to pay attention to the signs so you know what line to get in. I only ever get adobada, so I usually go straight to that line and hubby usually goes straight to the asada line. Sometimes I do feel like an asada taco, so hubby just gets mine when he gets his and that saves time and my food from getting cold. This last visit the line wasn't bad at all and the place had a good amount of heads in it. I only waited maybe 5 minutes in the adobada line and hubby waited less than that in his line. The wait time will no doubt change depending on the day at time, but the wait is worth it. I had an "Adobada Taco" ($2) and an "Adobada Mulas" ($4, I requested mine to me made on flour tortillas) and they were both so good! I asked for them both with pineapple and the dude hooked me up with a fair amount. The adobada has such great flavor and is very addicting! The taste just keeps you wanting more. They do have seating inside, but I noticed they are working on the other part of the building, so maybe they will add more seating there?? That will be good for those who like to eat inside, but a lot of people, myself included, just eat at our cars. They offer a variety of meats including asada, adobada, lengua, sesos, buche, tripa, suadero and chorizo. You can get any of these meats in a taco, mulas, tostadas, vampiro, sopes and even over fries. This place is absolutely legit when it comes to tacos and I'll be a regular for sure!

I came here for snack before going to Marquee.  Holsteins offers gourmet burgers, @ very high prices.  They also offer salmon and chicken options, as well as apps like wings & calamari.  In addition, you can also get foie gras on your burger for $12 extra.  Lastly, Holsteins offers bamboozled shakes w/ liquor at $11.

I ordered the Gold Standard ($18 - Dry aged beef sirloin burger w/smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli).  Sweet potato fries or rings are a $2 upgrade.  

Unfortunately, the burger should have been called the "Old Standard", because it was a basic burger w/ bacon on top.  The burger wasn't that big, didn't have any distinctive flavor, and it was nothing special especially for the price.  I can get an equivalent burger & fries for much less.  The same goes for the fries.  They were nothing special:  Both 3 Stars.

The ambiance was typical sports bar w/ a bar obviously, lounge seating, and the regular dining room:  3 Stars.  The only thing that was superior was the service from Toshi the bartender.  He was super cool & friendly.  He also comped me on a drink, so I gave him the cost of the drink as an additional tip ($10):  5 Stars for Toshi.

Holsteins is a pricey place to have a burger if you are staying at the Cosmo.  But I would definitely not go out of my way to come here.  However, I would go out of my way to say hello to Toshi, and just have drinks.

"Meh" is exactly right for this place. After reading all the 4-5 star reviews on opening night, I was really excited to finally have a sushi place downtown. Needless to say, I was very underwhelmed by the whole experience. 

Miso soup was sub-par at best. You'll get much better Miso at Hana (7th Ave & Missouri) or Yasu (near PV mall). Miso is my favorite part of the whole sushi experience, and they did just about everything wrong with it. 

Prices were what you would expect for good sushi, but definitely over-priced for the quality that was served here. 

Good sushi is about fresh fish, so my husband and I like to ask the chef's for their recommendation for the night. The chef here sent us out toro (it's the fatty part of the tuna, good toro is like biting through butter) which also happened to be the most expensive fish they had. I couldn't even chew through this toro, if this was the freshest fish they had then I am seriously concerned about the quality of their fish. It was like chewing a tough piece of steak and very unpleasant. 

The chef came out to ask us if we liked the toro, and when we told him it wasn't good he got very offended and insulted us (basically said that it was because we couldn't tell good fish from bad fish). 

Wait staff was also slow (we were the only people there) and didn't know anything about their menu or sushi. Chairs were uncomfortable (they were wire frames, kinda like shopping carts). Tables were too small (every plate and glass on our table was literally touching everything else b/c there was no room). 

I could go on and on with the things they did wrong...but I think you get the idea.

What. The. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck?????!!

I was stone-cold sober last night, I SWEAR. I went to see George Wallace, expecting a middle-of-the-road Vegas standup show. Some laffs, some audience participation, whatever. What do you expect for free tickets, ya know?

What I got was about 60 minutes of a cherubic relic in a pimp suit mumbling, slurring and stumbling through a bunch of dusty one-liners 
(sometimes his delivery was so bad, I couldn't understand what he was saying). There were a few jokes in really bad taste, though, about which he was totally unapologetic...so I did laugh at those.

But then, the show got WEIRD AS FUCK!

As one of the other reviewers mentioned, the audience is mostly middle-aged black people. Now, I've seen Madea and Coming to America and all those movies that end with church scenes featuring gospel singers clapping and throwing up their hands and singing "O Happy Day" and shit like that -- I thought it was some bullshit racist Hollywood stereotype.

But I'm here to tell you: at end of his show, on a Wednesday night in Vegas, George Wallace asked all the ministers in the house to stand up -- astonishingly, there were 7 or 8 of them in there that night, so they all got up and passed the mic around, saying their names, where they were from, and what church they preached at:"The First African Episcopalian Tabernacle Church of God in Christ," stuff like that.  WTF!!! 

Now George Wallace cued some 80s gospel music, and handed the mic around again. This one guy down front started belting away in a majestic baritone, somehow knowing all the words without a problem. Was he a plant? Or do all ministers just know these songs, and happen to frequent the George Wallace show (other reviewers here describe this same thing going down)? 

Next, he invited another one of the ministers, this big spiky-haired woman, onstage. He told her if she could sing this next track, and really kill it, he would match all the money people in the audience threw at her. WTF?! He didn't say anything about it going to her church -- I guess she just got to keep the cash.
 
So he cued up another obscure gospel track, and she took the mic -- and started DOMINATING that song!! I thought for sure she must be a plant -- she'd been sitting in a booth with a bunch of much younger guys who had raised their hands earlier when Wallace asked if anyone was from Detroit, but she said she was from Henderson...plus, they didn't react like friends would when she was pulled up onstage. Definitely seemed plant-y.

But if that's the case, then what a scam!!! Because after she belted a verse or two, people in the audience started getting up and throwing cash at her!!! They came from all over the theater -- the back, sides, front -- and even my friend went up and gave her $5, so I know the money wasn't all fake. People were standing up in the aisles, waving their hands in the air like on those creepy megachurch broadcasts, singing along and praising Jesus. Did I mention this was a Wednesday night in Vegas, and most of them were drinking Mai Tais and shit!!!!! WTF!!!

If this lady was really a plant, she has a pretty sweet gig going there -- she probably made about $100 for her "impromptu" performance, which I assume she repeated the following night...and the following night. George Wallace said he would match the money after the show -- he said, "Come see me, and I'll give you $100." Hmmm. 

Now that I think about it...the theater was only about a third full, and as mentioned my friends and I had gotten free tickets, so who knows how many other comps were in there. He's probably not making much money, since he spent a good portion of the show hawking his merch -- he told people over and over to be sure and buy one of his signature "I Be Thinkin'" hats after the show, which were normally $30 but this night only, just for us, he was marking them down to $20. He also pimped his $100 package, which included 2 CDs, 2 DVDs, 2 t-shirts and 2 keychains. 

It came off as kinda swap-meetish, and pretty desperate...so that makes me wonder: is he splitting the take with this planted gospel singer???

Either way, even if she was for real -- that's pretty fucking weird, too! I mean, these people were throwing money at her like it was the Spearmint Rhino!! 

WEIRD show. I would recommend scoring free tix somewhere, then eating mushrooms 30min before it starts.

And if you do -- be sure to let me know if the same lady gets up and sings! She looked like a fat Fantasia Barrino, with short spiky hair and a toothy smile.

This Fry's has some exceptional people working here.  And now, for the rest of the story...

Wherever possible, Fry's Gas Stations have been sprouting up throughout the Valley.  This one opened about six months ago.  After having dinner last night at Red House (excellent as usual, btw), I noticed I was near empty.

As I came in I also realized it was the third of the month.  Since we hadn't gone shopping yet that means we didn't have any points.  No matter I thought, we needed gas.  

The attendant, Joe T was outside helping folks. When was the last time your saw a gas station attendant outside helping people?

Joe does a lot of that I found out.  One woman who had a rental VW, couldn't figure out how to open her tank.  She asked for my assistance, but Joe had fixed it by the time I walked over. I on the other hand was had problems getting the pump to accept my card.  Seems, it doesn't matter if you do not have any points.  Unless you input your Fry's card, the machine doesn't work. D'oh!

Well. Joe came by and fixed it. So we got to chatting.  He believes the more time he's spends behind the glass; the less time he can be outside helping customers!  He told me he likes being able to help folks.  Feels that's the real job, his job.  Wow!

So Four Stars to Joe T for understanding the service end of the pump, and Fry's for hiring him.

Nice!

10/27

OK, I've decreed that Crust is my favorite pizza and wine restaurant!  (That is, until a few friends prove to me otherwise that there are better NY-style/thin-crust pizza joints in the valley.)  Not only does Crust offer up super-crispy and flavorful Rustica pizzas ("hand-stretched"), but their 20" thin-crust round pies (I've tried the Little Nicky- white pie w/ fresh spinach and tomatoes) and pasta dishes (crusted mac 'n cheese is delicious both fresh and re-heated) are good, too!

I am IN LOVE w/ Crust's filet mignon sliders w/ horseradish cream sauce.  This time the au jus reduction was SUBLIME, and oh so garlicky!  I was told that the "regular" chef was working that day.  To the unnamed chef, I salute you!  :)  The table bread, which you will have to specially request or you won't get any, was great w/ either butter or dunked into the au jus.  MMmm!

As if the steak sliders and the decadent cream sauce ($4.50 for 3 pcs, HH menu) weren't enough- I've got to find out where I can get my hands on those buns these sliders are served on!- I went ahead and ordered a pot of brownie sundae ($9.50).  This was my first time ordering the brownie sundae and had not realized it came served in a mini-caulderon-style pot.  Should you decide to order this sweet, make sure you have at least two other tablemates w/ you to share the wealth!  The walnut brownie came w/ sliced bananas, fudge sauce, and a scoop of ice cream and then topped w/ homemade whip cream and a maraschino cherry!  If you're a sundae fan, you'll love this delectable sweet pot!

Addendum 10/30:
So why not 5 stars?  The atmosphere here isn't as inviting as it could be.  I never minded much about this quality until I spent happy hour with three friends at Cork last night.  (What a beautiful and cozy space Cork has!  Cork review coming soon!)  I'm assuming it's intentional- this being a pizza and wine cafe, the owners want quick turnovers.  Am I right?  Hmm...

East Fremont has a great bar for beer and food!

Park on Fremont is now open.  They call themselves a gastropub...and I get it.  They have a great selection of beer (pub) and they do an elevated bar food-meets-comfort food...so yeah, they're a gastropub...just not what I would typically think of when I think gastropub.  Everything on the menu is tweaked or twisted in some way to be more than just your run-of -the mill bar menu.

Park on Fremont is the bar I always wanted to aesthetically design, but never knew  about.  Owned by the same group as the nearby Commonwealth, Park on Fremont is just plain cool on the inside.  Look around...stuffed birds behind the bar, a deer head with gold plated machine guns in its antlers, throwback trendy wallpaper, a beer garden that is way too cool for school!  Suffice it to say that you need to come down and check it out.  

There is not a lot of good food on East Fremont.  Park on Fremont is absolutely quality food!  I had the Philly Mac and Cheese Steak...yeah, a Philly Cheese steak with mac and cheese on top..I know why didn't you think of this before and make it?  Eat this.  I also tried the Chicken Bar Bites--Cornflake crusted pieces of real chicken with a trio of sauces...too large to be called nuggets...too small to be called fingers.  There were tasty.  I opted not to order the Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich.  I heard it was a little on the small side, but it sounded so good. Cap'n Crunch fired chicken with applewood, smoked bacon waffles and vanilla maple syrup...I will be eating you in the future...promise!

...I almost forgot!...Sweet Potato Teeter Tots!...soo good! 

My only qualm...and maybe I'm just spit-balling here...all the beers come in mason jars...cool I know...but are they the normal 16oz pour you are expecting?...I'm not up to date on my mason jar volumes, but they felt more like 14oz and I thought I would be getting a standard American Pint.  Maybe I did, but without some actual measuring I'll never know.

Come here for good food while hopping the happening bars of East Fremont!
Come here for a great beer selection!
Come here for a beer garden that will make you swear you're not in Vegas!
Come here for a different take on bar food!
Come here for sippy, summer cocktails that will transport you poolside!
Come here just to find the secret smoking area of the patio!
Regardless of why...you should in fact come here!

***Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate is pretty good (and is topped off with some nice whipped cream), but it is quite overpriced at $11***

I have always wanted to try Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate.  Serendipity has a takeout booth where you can get many drinks and such to go or a sit-down restaurant where you can get a full menu of food options as well as the frozen hot chocolate in a much nicer presentation.  I opted for the takeout booth.

The frozen hot chocolate is a good portion size and features a frozen chocolate concoction, which is similar to a milkshake though it really is an iced chocolate drink.  The chocolate drink is good.  It is cool and refreshing and has a good chocolate flavor.  I wouldn't say that it is any more memorable than any other good frozen chocolate drink out there, but it is satisfying enough.

They top the drink off with whipped cream and the whipped cream is good.  It is a little thicker than a lot of whipped creams out there and it has a pretty good vanilla flavor.

Service was quick on my one visit.

Prices were high--probably too high (maybe even too high for Las Vegas).  The frozen hot chocolate runs $11.  I think outside of Vegas, a drink like this one would most likely go for $6 and would probably not exceed $8.

Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate is a good but not special drink even though you are definitely paying a special, premium price.  I think it is good for at least one try, but I think the flavor does not really stand out that much.  There is a Vosges boutique in the Forum Shops and that chocolates boutiques used to serve milkshakes--they were far better in terms of flavor and even a little cheaper than Serendipity's frozen hot chocolate.

Now that Vosges no longer offers those milkshakes, I'm not sure where you can find a great frozen chocolate drink in Vegas, but a less expensive Haagen-Dazs milkshake would probably provide just as satisfying flavor and experience as what you can have at Serendipity (with the exception of the whipped cream).

Serendipity is located in the outside dining area at the front of Caesars Palace.  Caesars Palace offers both complimentary valet and self parking.

A lifesaver during my last Vegas trip. My first mistake: assuming everything there would be fattening and unhealthy like every other crepe place. But wait! They have fresh cleansing juices. Oh my! I've never been into juicing but this place changed my mind for sure. 

Have you ever become FITTER during a Vegas trip?!? Well, it happened to me. I was very pleased with the surprising results. How did it happen?

All hail the **Detoxifyer**! Densely packed with kale, celery, apple, beet, ginger, and lemon, the juice is delicious compared to many of the healthy concoctions out there. Of course it can't compare to a sugary juice, but it does soooo much more.

I had arrived in Vegas knowing I would be attending a pool party at Wet Republic after 4 days of eating terribly. There were no vegetables or good salad options anywhere around. So I had a feeling I'd gain weight by the time I had to don a bikini. But hey! Detoxifyer to the rescue! One juice once a day for 3 days was enough to do the trick. On the 4th day I put on my swimsuit and was actually impressed. I couldn't believe it.

If you need something more substantial to eat (I did), try **The Fitness** crepe and add Alfredo chicken to the mushroom spinachy mozzarella goodness. I split one of these with with my friend and also had the Detoxifyer.

The only thing I'd change about this place is the system to indicate when orders are ready. They have to shout the order number out and then people come up and take items without having to show a receipt. Maybe a more automated system that shows a number and patrons have to show proof of purchase. My order was stolen twice! Granted the MGM Grand was overrun by about 15,000 people from my company's convention. But still, such a system would help even on a daily basis.

Overall I love Blizz for introducing healthy juice options to me. Thank you to the clerks for the recommendation! And special thanks to the Detoxifyer! You've really opened my eyes.

DATE TIP: The Detoxifyer will definitely get you ready for your next hot Vegas date. 

TIP: [[[ T.M.I. Alert ]]] Remember that what you put in must also come out. You may have to use the restroom slightly more often than before, and things may look the same color as when you consumed them. The Detoxifyer is a vivid pomegranate color. Haha, I told you it was TMI. You've been warned!

My review is for the MALE REVIEW (Exotic Male strippers show)

Olympic Garden's is my #1 choice for  Bachelorette/Girls Night out!

Entry: FREE with purchase of 2 drink minimum at the door ($25)
Basically you pay $25 for 2 drinks of your choice (domestic beer, wine, and well spirits) and your entry fee is waived.

Days: Wednesday-Sunday
Hours: 8pm-3am

They offer complimentary house limo pick up at your hotel, just tip the limo driver. Message me if you want my friend Joey's number and I will happily connect you with him! When you come in a house limo you will pay the $25 at the door and a host will walk you upstairs to a table or chair seat on the rail. The waitress will greet your group and offer each girl 2 drinks of your choice or to put your tab total towards bottle service. If you choose the 2 drinks you have to order them both at the same time but they don't have to be the same thing so you can order a shot and drink if they suites your fancy. The waitress gratuity is not included in the $25 so make sure you take care of her accordingly. 

The strippers are not allowed to approach you until you have a drink in your hand. Once you are good and liquored up then WATCH OUT! These guys are there to work and they can be pretty aggressive at times. They will woo you with a gorgeous smile and rock hard body by smoothly asking if they can do a dance for you. Watch out for a tag team where they ask you to buy each other dances. Just make sure you talk to each other about who is buying who what. If you don't want a dance then a polite no thanks or not right now works well. 

TIP #1: Take a few minutes and check out the scenery and approach the guy you want versus buying something from the first guy who asks. 

While inside the show you have the option of sitting at the rail and donating $1's to the various entertainers as they shake their junk! Feel free to strategically place dollars between the bride to be's boobies for added excitement ;) If you are really feeling frisky then pick a guy for a personal dance for $20 which is 1 song long or they will usually do deals for 2 songs for $30. You can do a private dance away from the group if you want. 

For the birthday girl/guest of honor/bachelorette I suggest a stage dance for $40 where she is called up and seated in a chair center stage for 3 minutes of dry humping which might be slightly embarrassing, but wildly hilarious fun. 

TIP #2: !f you want a stage dance order is as soon as you arrive since sometimes it takes awhile for them to rotate to your dancer. 

TIP #3: You are allowed to take pictures and video if you wish to get proof of your crazy Vegas adventures!


I hope I yelped you!

I know. I'm updating this about 2-3 weeks after I first got there.  It went from a 3 to 1 purely because I got kicked out for NO apparent reason ... and here's why.

I was standing by the bar next to my boyfriend and I had rested my head on his shoulder area.  I was hugging him too - it was literally the stance of most couples when girls just want to rest their head on their guys. Literally 30 seconds after I did that, we got a tap on our shoulder saying that we had to go. WTF? Not wanting to cause a scene, we followed this bouncer to the door and he asked for my driver's license - so I gave it to him.  He then took my ID, wrote down my entire information, then gave that piece of paper to the bouncers at the entrance so that I couldn't back in ... since there's only one entry way into the club. 

First of all, can I just ask why I was kicked out?  I was perfectly fine - and the bouncer must've known since he asked ME for my ID, looked ME in the eye, gave ME BACK my own ID and watched me walk off perfectly fine. Now, I'm not going to lie and say that I was sober, but I was DEFINITELY not drunk to the point where it's obvious that I need to be kicked out. 

Secondly, if you bouncers are going to be strict, don't be looking around the bar for people to kick out. Because guess what?  My friend YACKED in the MIDDLE of the dance floor. Did he get kicked out? No. And I was kicked out for resting my head on my boyfriend's shoulder?  I wasn't stumbling, I wasn't all over the place. and I wasn't even near yacking or looking like I needed to. 

This club is ridiculous. 
I had SUCH high expectations and I've given this club a second chance that it COMPLETELY ruined - on my birthday weekend too. 

The only good part? The promoter was nice and got us girls in fast.  But after that - downhill. I will avoid this club at ALL costs.  And I suggest you guys do the same -  it's NOT worth it. At all. It's to the point where Marquee seems better. I mean it does have re-entry and an outdoor pool area.

Last week, I had the choice of any reasonable place in Las Vegas for my graduation lunch. Having only had the lunch buffet before at Lotus of Siam, I decided to atone for my past errors in judgment.

I had an opportunity to read the articles all over the waiting area in the twenty minutes or so of wait time, so I learned that Lotus of Siam has been open since around 2000. Amazing. I'll bet the plaza in which they're located was also pretty rundown back then, but the quality of their food has probably not lessened and their reputation has only soared. I did my research this time and, along with some appetizer suggestions from my mom, we picked a lot of specialties and Northern Thai menu options.

The food arrived all at once after perhaps fifteen minutes. Patience is a virtue, as we were rewarded with delicious food. For starters, the tod mun plar (#7, $8.95) was a great take on a deceptively simple fish cakes with nice pickled cucumber. The nam kao tod (#14, $7.95), everybody's favorite crispy rice dish, was definitely yummy but a little too sour for my taste. Also very delicious but not suited for my palate was the yum nuah (#36A, $12.95), which is a great beef salad that's just too spicy for me and paralyzed me in fire and sweat for a few minutes. The spicy catfish with basil leaves (#85, $14.95) was a solid if small portion of sauteed fish in a basil sauce

After recovering from the yum nuah, I delved into the Northern specialties. The khao soi (#A, $9.95) was one of my favorite tastes of the meal. To call it an egg noodle curry is not nearly doing it justice, so I'll just say that you'd better order it when you get the chance. The kha nom jean nam ngyow (#G, $9.95) is a non-spicy pork and rice vermicelli dish that reminds me slightly of a certain Vietnamese dish called bun rieu, but I wouldn't have this one again as it seemed a bit boring compared to some other dishes. The last item from this part of the menu was the nam prik ong (#I, $10.95), a non-spicy dish consisting of a red chili paste and various items to dip into it. Pretty nice, possibly worthy of a repeat, but not a palate dazzler either.

I think the best item we had may have been the garlic prawns (on the chef's choice menu, $22.95). They are certainly pricey, and they are actually kinda worth it. Very crunchy, perfectly cooked, and just delicious. And even considering the modest portions of other dishes, definitely a splurge.

Having finally had items from the proper menu, I can now confidently express my opinion that Lotus of Siam deserves all of its praise. I don't know if I'd tell somebody to fly here just for one restaurant, but when you are in Las Vegas, you must make this a destination. Oh, and you'll definitely want to reserve well in advance if you choose dinner hours. Just saying.

For our 350th review it is only fitting to write one on the Cirque du Soleil Show "O" at the Bellagio.

The "O" is simply "eau" in French meaning water :)

While I have seen a lot of Cirque shows and this was my second time seeing "O", this was Dave's FIRST EVER Cirque Du Soleil Experience! This was also a first viewing for his parents for "O".

In Vegas "Ka" and "O" are my two favourite shows. What I love about "O" is how unique it is and how artfully the show is choreographed with the use of water, music, story and amazing acrobatics.

The opening of the show always reminds me of something I would catch in a Tim Burton Movie.. the beheaded corpse hanging from the ceiling, the somewhat creepy deathly music and tones. That said the show like most Cirque shows has beautiful colorful costumes and an element of comedy. The two clowns that appear throughout the show are "corny" funny. I find the stage very distinctive in its ability to transform into a stage for them to walk on, swim in, dive into and sail on -the depth of water is amazing.

If you like acrobatics, water, music then "O" is a great show for you to go see. We had front row seats so we did get splashed a bit but that was all part of the experience.

Editors Note (Dave):  This was simply one of the best show experiences I've had in my life.  We were lucky enough to be in the front row but we were off to the side a bit.  The front edge of the stage is curved so when the curtain was down, we missed moments of the show while it was going on on the other side of the stage.

Watching the swimmers come out of the water slowly without even a sign of bubbles was a bit on the surreal side.  Their carefully decorated costumes and face painting definitely gave much to look at even at close detail when they were running in front of us just a couple feet away at times!

The whole show was pretty amazing, however, there was so much going on, I wish I had read the program we bought ($15, and worth it) to get a little bit more of the story since when I'm in such an amazement I tend to zone out focusing on something specific.  It will be moments later when I'll realize something else is happening on the other side of the stage that deserves my attention.  There was even a time where I was staring at something happening in the air and the person performing in the water right in front of us splashed us.  I guess they felt they deserved my attention more?!?

I would definitely go again.    I hope I do, at least.

TIPS:
1. Buy tickets ahead of time or online
2. If you want front row seats get them in the middle section
3. Go to the 7pm showing instead of the 10pm if you are not a night owl! 
4. The first few rows are definitely "wet" seats, so don't go in something that can't get chlorinated water on it, but don't freak out, its not a Sea World show.

On my way to Ross J's for some Korean chicken I spotted this new restaurant with a grand opening sign and cartoon character. I quickly flipped a u up the hill in hopes to being the FTR but nope beat LOL. I quite don't remember what was here before but I've been here before just can't remember. Big parking lot and lots of seating. Maybe no room for chacha.

13 iced flavor milk teas such as honey milk green tea, taro milk tea, rose milk tea.  10 iced teas such as bubble green or black tea, mango, plum, passion fruit, lychee. 6 fruit smoothies and 9 other drink that's 38 different drinks, crazy, and you can also add jelly for extra charge. YEESSS

They have roast duck so of course I had to get some. Owner recommanded the roast duck and wonton noodles soup. It's like he was reading my mind. As a lunch special its $7.95 and comes with an egg roll and choice of egg drop soup or salad. Loved the duck and wonton, the broth was between good and ok, and not a fan of the noodles felt packaged maybe!? It threw me off since it says "serious noodles" in their logo. But still the dish and price overall is pretty good.

Their whole roast duck is only $24 has to he a steal, half is $13, and regular portion $10. Their menu looks so delicious and yummy and want to try more but its just to far out of the way for me. I can't keep passing this area and not go Ross J's or Chicken Shack. 

17 lunch specials for $8 can't go wrong. In the theirs about 73 different choices on the menu, there could be more.  Pho, udon, ramen, kimchi fried rice, pad thai, mapo tofu, just check out my menu pics for all the details.

Customer service was good, very friendly.

Down side is theres $20 minimum for using credit cards. So glad I had cash other wise I had to watch dishes LOL

Forte was mysteriously closed on a recent Saturday night, yet my wife was unable to shake her hunger for Eastern European cuisine.  Nothing else would do.  You know those Snickers commercials "you're not you when you're hungry"?  My wife turned into Dolph Lundgren aka Ivan Drago from Rocky 4.  For a brief moment, I feared for my life ;)  A Bulgarian friend recommended BG Bistro a while ago and it was the perfect time to give it a shot. 

I found it curious that outdoor seating was offered when all to see was a Smith's supermarket parking lot.  The cigarette smoke hit me as soon as I entered.  Was this their way of staying authentically Eastern Europe?  I kinda felt like a tourist.  With all the college football games going on that moment, they opted to show golf and soccer on their TV's to enhance the Europeanness.  I could see the smoke being a huge turnoff to prospective patrons, definitely wore it upon exit.   But on this evening, we would NOT be deterred.   DRAGO!!!

Our friendly waitress walked us through the menu and specials.  The priciest entres were the daily specials of lamb chops or grilled trout for only $13.  I was so close to getting one of them, but the kufteta was calling my name.  Grilled Bulgarian meatballish burger patties made with pork were juicy and accompanied by 3 small salads: potato, bean (blaaand), and cabbage.  The tomato sauce on the side went well with the kufteta, we asked for more.    

I should have traded out the bean salad for fries topped with Bulgarian feta.  Lots of tables ordered that as a stand-alone dish.   Bulgarian feta is good stuff.  It's quite different from the popular Greek version, creamy while still being firm.  That really shines when shredded like in the shopska salad at the start of our meal.  It also tasted great when baked in a clay pot with lukanka, egg and tomato sauce.  The lukanka had a nice, lean salami and bacon taste to it.  I'd love to try their other dried meats.  The Bulgarian red wine was served cold and went well with everything.  A bottle was only $18.  Nazdrave!  
   
Got talked into the biscuit cake for dessert after some arm-twisting.....light twistin..............OK....no freaking twist at all.  She simply suggested it and we said yes.   Glad we did!  It was like a sweeter tiramisu.  

So the food definitely made up for the smokiness, but BG Bistro would not be for everyone.   Pretty cool that it's in the same plaza as Villa Algarve though.  A burgeoning international plaza!!

I attempted when they were in Henderson, but was a day late and a cup of shave ice short. They were apparently moving over to a spot in Chinatown (now open!) and I would have to wait a couple more weeks. While on a taco trek UYE last week I was told that SnowFlake Shavery would be added as one of our stops and was thrilled! This isn't ice cream and it isn't a sno-cone. I know there is a lot of confusion to what shave ice is and I am learning myself, but you wont find any artificial syrups here! If you haven't had it before, it is something you need to experience first hand. The appearance, texture and taste is something special. SnowFlake Shavery uses fresh and all natural ingredients. Flavors range from chocolate, vanilla, cantaloupe, mango, coconut, green tea, black sesame and depending on the season you might be lucky enough to try the banana! I missed out, but heard it was fantastic! 

Sizes: Regular ($3.49) Large ($4.75) Monster ($6.49)

Step 1 - Choose your flavor and size
Step 2 - Choose your toppings priced 50 cents each
Step 3 - Choose sauce priced at 25 cents each (first sauce is free) 

I ordered the "Ex-Straw-Binary" (regular) and it had strawberry snow, strawberries, strawberry sauce and I had them add chocolate sprinkles and extra strawberry condensed milk. The strawberry condensed milk is SO good! The shave ice is very light. The portions are big and even though the regular looks like something you wont be able to finish, give it a try because it wasn't filling at all to me. It was just refreshing and yummy. I will be back to try other flavors!

The employees are very friendly and willing to answer any questions you might have. If you aren't sure about a flavor just ask and they will give you a sample. Don't forget to ask for a rewards card because when you buy 10 you get one free!

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

We came here on the Friday of Labor Day weekend. The food was just okay and not very memorable.  There really isn't a Happy Hour menu at Four Peaks.  As it was explained to us, "the drinks are $1.00 off and the food is just the regular prices."   

This is the sort of thing you run into at Craft Brewers that serves food.  A lot of times they confuse their beer sales, as proof of their food success.  It's too bad they don't eat here.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
Very, very noisy and somewhat overly attentive service, particularily from those busing tables.

MENU:
Everything under the sun, but nothing that stands out:
Chicken Rolls $7; Spinach Artichoke Dip $8; Garlic Cheese Beer Bread $6; Cheese Puffs $7; Spanekopita $7; Wings $7; Nachos $7; Quesadilla $7; Thai Hummus $6; Stuffed Poblano $8; Chicken Strips & Fries $8; Pub Fish and Chips $9; Chicken Enchiladas $9; Carne Adovada $10 and various pizzas starting at $13.50

SERVICE:
As noted above, they are overly attentive, including their over the top busers. They seem to excel at taking your plates before you have finished your food. LOL.  No, it's actually not funny.

FOOD:
Four Peaks is a Craft/ Micro brewer http://www.craftbeer.com/breweries/brewery-locator/find-a-us-brewery  who uses the restaurant to sell their beer.  Now, normally that isn't a bad thing. Except the food here is uninspiring at best.  RAM, Rock Bottom, Yard House, Gordon Biersch, BJs all do it quite well, but these are restaurants concepts trying to sell food and beer, in that order.

We tried their  Spanekopita, which they describe as a blend of cheeses, spinach, pine nuts, and dill rolled in phyllo dough and served with marinara sauce. We actually liked this very much and would recommend it.  

On the other hand, their Five Layer Nachos was a big miss. It came out cold and you could peal the cheese off the nacho chips. We added chicken ($2.50) which looked like it came out of a Sysco bag and dropped on top before serving. Ugh.

As you would expect, the beer at Four Peaks is very much Four Stars.  We enjoyed their Oatmeal Stout and their 8th Street Scottish Ale, both of which had low IBUs and 4.8-5.2% alcohol.  

PRICES:
Expect to pay around $40 including tax and tip, depending on how many pints you are going to enjoy.

I fell in love with the oxtail bone marrow fried rice when I visited the NYC location. You can only imagine the smile on my face when they told me they served it here in Vegas, as well!

Score!

We started the evening with a bottle of nigori, that drink gets me buzzing from the get go and at 19% alcohol on the Genshu Sake I knew I was in for a treat!

Our first dish was one of the restaurant's signature dishes kanpachi Yuzu which was delicate with a soft supple texture but with a nice acidic finish from the yuzu. Great start!

King crab truffle fried rice - dare I say I found a new favorite?!? I think I died and went to fried rice heaven!! The truffle added just the right amount of fragrant aroma to this drool worthy dish to make my mouth water and the moist and flaky king crab took it up to whole new level! AMAZEBALLS!!!

Oxtail bone marrow fried rice with egg - as deliciously magnificent as I remembered! Rich, flavorful and marvelous!!!!

Bone marrow - Rich, smooth with deep flavors enhanced by the accompanying sauce! You really don't need the accompanying bread but the contrast in textures are inviting!

Fried chicken - served nice & hot! Perfectly crisp on the outside and beautifully juicy on the inside! Finger lickin gooooood!

We were running late for a show so the thoughtful staff had us sign sealed and delivered before we could even say "check please!"

Overall, great food, courteous staff and cool hip ambiance! The prices are a bit high but what do expect? IMO, this a great place to dine if you're into Japanese cuisine/Asian fusion. 

Happy Eats!

It's my 100th review, and I saved it for XS!

We heard that there wasn't a guestlist for this new club, as everyone and their mommas were trying to get in. We decided to get in line at 9:30pm, and there was already a line formed along the wall. Thankfully, some people from our group came earlier in the day and scored the ladies free tickets. Woot!

The guys opted to get a table and do bottle service in order to get in. The table they reserved was right along the pool, with 2 lounge beds in the water, and a shallow area where we could dance! My feet were thankful for this, as I had been wearing 4-inch heels for the past 3 nights. I think I was the first one in the water, I was so excited! 

The first week of November offered the perfect weather. It was sunny in the day time, and just right at night. Half of the nightclub is outdoors and it wouldn't have been as enjoyable once it started getting cold. Really though, this club was gorgeous. There were booths, cabanas, and even rooms that opened out to the club that you could reserve. They really catered to parties of all sizes. There was even a casino area in the middle of the pool. Some drunk-tard decided against walking around the pool to get there... he jumped in and swam across the pool instead!

Drinks were yummy. I renewed my love for vodka here.. especially Belvedere vodka. After 3 shots and 2 vodka cranberries, I was on a mission... to get my dance on! Too bad the music was off. It went from Trance, to Reggaeton, to... who the hell knows? Can you play some hip-hop please? If anything is a buzz kill, it's bad music. 

None-the-less I had an amazing time at XS. It was all a blurr by the end of the night... and I can't wait to do it all over again!

I spotted this Thai restaurant on the road and decided to stop by to grab dinner. It was during peak hour so the small venue was packed with people waiting to be seated by the door. The dim lit atmosphere was warm and inviting. Quite the contrast when I asked for a table for one. Their male servers seemed more concerned with the bigger parties, but the lone female server was friendly and made me feel welcomed.  

I started off with the Papaya Salad ($10) served with shredded papaya, cabbage, carrots, green beans, scallions, grilled shrimps, tomato, chili, lime, and fish sauce. The dish was crisp, feisty spicy, with hints of peanut flavors here and there. The fish sauce flavor was noticeable, but weighted down given the amount of explosive spiciness. I thought adding a handful of basil could provide that welcoming lift, but I did enjoy the differential textures and the grilled jumbo shrimps immensely. 

Next, I tried the Spicy Mussels ($15). The plate full of mussels were sauted in a roasted chili sauce, jalapeno, tomatoes, green onions, cilantro, bell peppers, and zucchini. The mussels were fresh, spicy, and the sweet zucchini gave it a nice contrast. 

It was a pleasant surprise to find Sticky Rice ($2) to go with the meal. Overall, the prices were very steep for Thai food. Even though the ingredients were freshly prepared, the spicy flavors still lacked the striking complex aroma that made me fell in love with Thai cuisine in the first place. The experience was very Westernized so this might still be a welcoming experience for a large segment of the population. The server was very nice to provide me a frequent user card, but I don't think I will return anytime soon. 2.5 stars.

I have been wanting to try Due Forni for a while so I was glad to finally try it. Here they offer pizza, appetizers, salads, mozzarella bar and have a selection of wines.  They have 2 different ovens for 2 different types of pizza. The "Neapolitan" had a crust that is more soft and thick and the "Roman" had a crust that is thin and crispier. 

Since I was here having lunch with a fellow yelper who has been here several times, I asked her suggestions as far as portion size and what was good. She said the pizza was huge and filling so we decided to split a pizza and salad. I can't remember the name of the salad, but it was the special of the day and delicious. The figs were very tasty and I'm usually not a fan of arugula however everything paired well and tasted great. Then came time for the pizza. We ordered the "Quattro Formaggi" priced at $15.99 with the roman crust. This pizza had buffalo mozzarella, parmesan, fontina fontal and ricotta on it which made for one cheesy delight. All the cheeses were perfect together and tasted very good. This pizza usually comes white, but we requested red sauce made with san marzano tomatoes be added and the sauce is boss! The crust however I wasn't a fan of. I found the roman crust very chewy and tough to eat so I would try this pizza with the neapolitan crust next time. Another thing is I was still hungry when the bill came so I wouldn't share again since I could have easily eaten 3 pieces of the pizza and all of the salad *oink oink*. Service was great and I will definitely come back to Due Forni. 

**Happy Hour is from 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm 7 days a week**
 Current HH menu: $5
-Oven Baked Goat Cheese

If you ask me what Yonaka is all about, two words: PRESENTATION and FLAVOR.

This place is one of those fusion places that bring different foods that you wouldn't think would be good together actually taste good. 

The PRESENTATION.
Doesn't matter what you order, when they bring it out, the first thing you think of is to take a picture. Then, you take a moment or two to admire the colors, the texture, and the usage of the dimensions of the plate. 

The FLAVOR.
OMG! As if the presentation didn't take your breath away, the taste will just do the opposite. You will find out you have way more taste buds than you realize after taking a nibble of any of their choices whether its an appetizer, main entre, or dessert. They even give you a complimentary palette cleanser to keep your tongue in check from the multiple flavors you will encounter. 

Now you're probably wondering what I ordered. Well, im still trying to figure that out too! I have been here twice. The first time me and the wifey ordered the 6 course Omakase which consisted of 6 of the popular favorite dishes. The second time, we did the Happy Hour from 5 to 6:30. If you refer to my pics, I have each one identified. If I actually typed up each thing, I will never get this review done. I will leave it up to you to decide what you think. Im just merely guiding you to this place. You know, you can lead a horse to water and so on.

But wait, if you go and eat here now, as a bonus, you will get some seriously awesome service! Your drinks will constantly be refilled, plates picked up when you are done, and then on to the next course.

How's that for a synopsis? Again, just when you think this review is over, they not only give you great service, but the overall dcor of the place will astound you! Did I also mention the bathroom? Its very nice. What's that word to describe the ambiance of this place? Oh yeah, its very MODERN.

Lastly, if you want to make a good first impression and want to be adventurous whether its your friends, family or that awkward first date, this place will impress them. I know I was with my first impression which brings me back to my intro. Once you try this place, you will know why I said what I said. Cheers!

My Friday night plans fell through and wound up with my son and his boyfriend and we were starving I asked them if they were up to trying out a new Thai place that we haven't been to yet and they answered back quickly with a yes, let's go!

We got their around 8:45pm and the place was sort of emptied out, but it was perfect for us. I also noticed that I got a free Thai Tea for checking in on Yelp! How sweet is that!  

For starters we ordered the chicken satay, the chicken was delish and full of flavors, the peanut sauce was amazing! My son and I at the same time said we could bath in the peanut sauce it was that good! Apple doesn't fall far from the tree I guess. But that sauce is amazing! Love it! 

One ordered the Massaman Curry, mild and that dish looked so very yummy! He said it was delish too! The other one ordered the Chicken Pad Thai mild without bean sprouts and he loved it too!

I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai as well, but had my Thai hot baby, bring on the heat I say! I enjoyed the Pad Thai, the noodles where perfectly cooked, the chicken was very tender and so tasty! The pad Thai did come with tofu, which next time I know to have it without tofu but since it was already on my plate I went ahead and tried it out, and well it was flavorless and blubbery, like you would imagine a whale to be. It's not my thing, but I tried :) .

My son and I have a favorite little Thai place on the other end of Mesa that we love, but I think Thai Spices just might have knocked them out, can't wait to come back and try the pineapple fried rice of course with chicken!

I was really craving a "nice" dinner somewhere and my new Vegas friend and I decided to try out the buffet here since we heard good things from other people about it. Also I had gotten kicked out of the Wynn earlier in the day and it really made me want to walk around inside in a spiteful and evermorecurious manner. 

Downsides:
-It will cost you upwards of $40 bucks for dinner.
-Lots of nuts in food, but they have labels for food allergies! 
-After partaking of the lunch buffet at Paris, I felt the selections here weren't that different. 
-Only power outlet that I could find was in the bathroom. (You don't want to know. Or do you?)
-King crab legs were still frozen :(
-Sushi sucks, no sashimi at all unless you count the smoked salmon sitting on a tray in a different section.
-Prime rib was better than the buffet at Paris and it was tender and more edible, but lacked flavor. Maybe I'm meat spoiled. 

Upsides:
-Beautiful beautiful decor!
-I got to try rabbit, which I can't remember if I've had before but I would like to say that I have. So let's say I got to resample rabbit. 
-Lots of choices.
-Beautiful dessert selection.
-We got to traumatize an older couple sitting next to us. Muhahaha.
-Silverware and table settings are still in new condition. It sucks to eat somewhere that has ratty utensils. Just saying.
-Our server was great with her timing. She would come by to clear plates and refill drinks without being gone too long, or checking up too frequently. 

Overall, it was great. I wish I could have eaten more and that I got to experience it without having buffet for lunch so I could have appreciated the food more instead of comparing.

New First Meal/Breakfast Review:

A couple of months ago the AZ Republic had coupon inserts for Taco Bell's roll-out of their new breakfast menu. They call it The First Meal. Not being a breakfast person, I ignored it. 

Well, several months later, more and more TBs are starting to serve breakfast.  Soon almost all their Phoenix locations will have it. What can you expect?  Typical Taco Bell faire with some interesting twists. 

Their big new item, is something call the "AM Crunchwap".  Your choices are either bacon or sausage. I tried the bacon and it's quite good.  It's a little smaller than their normal Crunchwrap, maybe 3/4 of inch.  It's filled with scrambled egg, bacon, cheese and a creamy Jalapeno sauce that gives off a little heat.  Yummy!

The key to the sandwich, besides the flavorful sauce, is a very thin circular hash-brown that is in the middle of the wrap.  I liked it and it's priced at only $2.49 each. BTW, breakfast is served until 11 am.

Should Mickey Ds next door start worrying? No. But along with their Bacon or Sausage Skillet (Soft Taco) for $0.99, it's a nice alternative.  The Combo meal ran me slightly less than $4.00, excluding tax.  

Surprisingly, there doesn't seem to be any decent coffee option.  When I paid, the server offered me a medium drink. Taco Bell's First Meal won't change my habit of skipping breakfast, but I might give them a try every couple of months.

Wow, I just gave a Taco Bell Four Stars.  D'oh!

Another 4 star Ramen spot in Vegas.  I'm really enjoying hitting up the various one's on every trip out to sin city.  This time it was meeting up with great friends from high school in Japan for a much needed girls weekend.  Being that we grew up eating ramen picking it for lunch was a easy choice.

Ramen Sora serves up all broth type ramen froms shio, shoyu, tonkotsu and miso.  They state they serve Sapporo Ramen which is miso based.  It is def one of my fave broth flavor that I grew up eating in Japan including the instant kind by sapporo ichiban!  Obviously the toppings at each ramen house varies but typically a bowl of miso ramen is served with chashu, bean sprouts and corn.  

Deluxe Sora Ramen ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#hCJU9RRGp3DKxDTlDB3YSA  You get to pick the broth choice and I decided to go with miso.  The bowl came out nice and hot.  Broth had a great flavor not salty as some can be.  Good ajitama. The chashu was nice and fatty and soft.  It was sliced on the thinner side but it was very good http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#D-VllyZqgYKzpRSSEh7PBw The noodles were the yellow curly chijiri type.  It was cooked perfectly and not mushy.  They offer 2 bowl sizes (regular and large) and additional toppings are offered for a reasonable price.  

Gyoza ~ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-sora-las-vegas?select=0vjKNr87LblVN2JuatKoTg#eaaQo6H7y5Ob4t3j7ydoeg Fried up with a decent char.  The filling had a good flavor.  They have a premixed sauce so no guessing on the soy sauce to vinegar ratio. 

Ramen Sora is located a few blocks away from Monta.  Driving by this place in the evening you might think they are closed due to the tinting they have on the window but rest assured they are open.  The single building is of decent size and a good number of tables however I felt they could have used the somewhat open space with another communal table.  Depending on the time you get there you will def have a wait as we did albeit a short one.  

Eyes ~ Nice bowl of noodle goodness!
Nose ~ Smells so good!.
Ear ~ Happy chatting and eating.
Mouth ~ So very very good!.
Tummy ~ Satisfied!

A welcome addition to the ramen scene on the east side of town.  Located in an inconspicuous strip mall at the corner of Tropicana and Eastern, this is a true neighborhood ramen joint where one is always greeted enthusiastically at the door and local Japanese residents can always be spotted as regulars.  The decor is minimalist but modern and service is prompt and non-overbearing.  

Appetizers that stand out are the karaage (Japanese fried chicken) and the gyoza (pork/chicken pot stickers).  The chicken is served fresh out of the fryer with a nice crispy exterior and juicy interior with a hint of ginger accentuated with a squeeze of fresh lemon whereas the gyoza have a nice char and the dough skin and filling are light enough to leave room for the main course.  

After consuming 15+ bowls of ramen on multiple lunch break visits from work, the key words describing the soups here are consistency and balance.  Whereas I've had a few instances at Ramen Sora and Monta where the soups were either too salty or too bitter (black garlic oil was literally blackened garlic),  the broths here all have a creamy rich depth of flavor and are not overly cloying in the mouth so the resistance to reaching for additional spoonfuls of broth once the noodles are finished is quite low.  Noodles come in thick and thin varieties with decent texture although lacking any true inherent flavor only found at the top joints.  

The standout broth for me is one of the relative newcomers on the menu: the kogashi (or burnt miso) ramen.  I've waxed poetic before on the Mallard reaction in chemistry  applied to food in a previous review(nerd alert!) but here again is yet another example of the magical powers of applying heat to rearrange amino acids and simple sugars to create a new unique flavor.  By charring miso paste, not only is there an intense aroma given off by the broth upon arriving at your table, but the flavor profile retains the savory note of the fermented soybeans we all know and love in miso but also has additional complex notes with an almost caramelized sweetness and a hint of bitterness that is pleasing on the tongue.  The crispy fried onions topping the noodles further enhance the umami tsunami.   I wish I could comment on the tan-tan men (spicy Szechuan style broth), but alas my first experience was on a full stomach from a previous meal so I must defer one to read other fellow yelper's raves on this other unique offering.

For the most part, the choices here are safe and reliably consistent, much like dating the girl next door, but if you're in the mood for something a little more adventuresome and unpredictable, the krazy kogashi ramen or the spicy and fiery tan tan men are worthy "fuku-mi-mi" one night stands (had to do it,  the name of the joint is just begging for a little humorous acknowledgment!)  

P.S.  Don't forget to partake in their generous punch-card system where one is entitled to a free order of gyoza or karaage with every fourth bowl of ramen purchased!

***I do not think the pastries and desserts at Aria's Jean Philippe Patisserie are worth the high prices, but it still one to consider if you are on the hunt for fancy-looking desserts (I haven't loved anything here yet, but there are some good items)***

Aria's Jean Philippe Patisserie has a very attractive display of pastries and individual desserts.  Located right next to the casino, this stand is very versatile.  You can pick up breakfast pastries or individual cakes, but you can also get cafe-esque breakfast items and sandwiches.  They also have a gelato bar as well as a selection of expensive but nice looking packaged sweets (for gifts).

I had a few things.  I tried their pain au chocolat, which was very flaky and crispy.  The chocolate flavor was good though the chocolate bar inside the croissant was too hard.

I also had one of their parfaits, which was gingerbread gelato mixed with hazelnut gelato and then garnished with crunchy hazelnuts and spice-flavored gingerbread.  The parfait was topped off with whipped cream and chocolate sauce.

The parfait was just okay.  The gelato was a little too thick (the whipped cream was also not that great; too similar in consistency to a canned whipped cream though I believe this one was fresh).  Also, while the parfait had a good flavor, I felt there was too much gingerbread in it (and the gingerbread was dense).

Service is not rude or lazy here, but it is consistently slow.  I think part of it is due to a lack of staff.  I also do not think it is the most organized spot.  Another issue is that the staff does not seem to notice when a line is building or when customers have been waiting long.

Prices are very high, but it is Las Vegas.  Still, the pastries and desserts here could definitely be better (especially when considering that some of their more ambitious items can run up to $6-$8 each).

Jean Philippe Patisserie is definitely overpriced, but you can walk away with a good pastry or dessert here.  I have not found anything here that I absolutely loved, but there are enough decent things where it might be worth checking out if you are in Aria and on the hunt for a fancy dessert.

Aria has its own parking structure, which is free.  Valet parking is also available.

A truly awesome experience!

Unlike the mansion, L'atelier is a much more casual restaurant coupled with a vibrant and interactive experience where the best seat in the house is actually at the counter!

Our server was warm friendly and helpful with the menu, which included the enticing Seasonal Discovery Tasting Menu. We all decided to go with that with wine pairings and our exhilarating journey began. We were started with an amuse bouche, which was a Parfait of foie gras with Parmesan cream coupled with a glass of Veuve Clicquot Champs.  The flavor profiles were impeccable. Creamy smooth fragrant and indulgent. A spectacular start to our meal.

The breads were warm and fluffy. My personal favorite was the buttery brioche that was flaky, light, and simply delicious. 

The first course was a beautiful Alaskan king crab on a delicate gelee and cream of spiced fresh peas. It was both refreshing and flavorful.

Next up were beautifully seared medallions of buttery diver scallops, which were served with a vibrant shimeji salad that brought out just the right amount of acidity to this wonderful dish.

La Cebette
A crisp white onion tart topped with savory smoked bacon green asparagus and crowned with a perfectly cooked quail egg. 
Easily one of my favorite dishes of the evening.

Seared duck foie gras
Served au torchon, this satisfying dish made me realize why I waited so long to enjoy foie gras in Vegas. Decadently rich, yet infinitely satisfying!

John Dory served with a crisp skin
This beautiful dish was served with a irresistible tomato saffron bouillon sauce that had a subtle earthy, fragrant flavor. 

Free range quail stuffed with foie gras. 
The quail leg was cooked to perfection and the stuffed quail was flavorful and rich.

Hanger steak
With a beautifully pink center and a melt in your mouth texture, this was easily the best cut of steak I had the pleasure to enjoy all weekend! Oh and the accompanying creamy mash potatoes? Like velvet and yes they're ridiculously good as everyone boasts! 

The mango mouse dessert was exemplary! A fantastic finish to our extraordinary meal.
It was cool, smooth creamy and fragrant. A combination quite fitting for any successful dessert 

The final dish was no "also ran" it was as easy on the eyes as it was on the palate. A bright and tantalizing Creme de menthe atop a decadently rich chocolate cake. It truly was a fantastic finale to our inspiring meal.

I can't speak enough about our experience here. Dining at the chef's table was a truly organic experience that involved a lot of interaction with the sommelier and staff on a personal level that made for an unforgettable experience I will cherish for years to come!

Bravo L'atelier!

Happy Eats!

I've heard so much good stuff for here so we came for lunch on a Friday afternoon on our way to Vegas.  Luckily, there was no line to get in and we go seated near the windows with a view of he strip.  The bad thing was, it was so far away from the food!  :P  No prob though, we needed to get the cardio in.  

We started in the salad line and made our way through the whole buffet.  I loved the way it was set up.  Lots of action stations and lots of variety.   

However, I don't know, I wasn't impressed with the flavors of things.  The best thing I had was the beet salad.  That was really good.  Everything else was just average.  I'm not much of a drinker, but the unlimited beer and wine was cool.  The root beer on tap was really good too. 

The service we got was average, some of our dirty plates were on our tables a lil too long though.

I'd like to try other places again before coming back here.  I guess the $16 price tag for lunch was a deal for the variety to keep everyone happy.

Tao is a foreign word, which loosely translates to "panty-dropper."  Wait a minute, it doesn't?  Those guys lied to me? 

Jake, a really cool promotions guy, approached Lindsey and I on the street early last Saturday and asked if we wanted to get VIP entrance into Tao at 10 pm and have an open bar.  So, after thinking about this for 2 nanoseconds, we eagerly agreed.  We had dinner reservations at Tao for 11 pm, and figured that we could have a few free drinks before being seated downstairs. 

After calling Tao to confirm that our promoter was legit (although I wasn't too concerned, since Mama taught me how to disable taillights when trapped inside a predator's trunk), Lindsey and I brought our sexy selves to the Girl's Only VIP line.  We received our wristbands and were quickly ushered in - past at least one hundred clubgoers in waiting (some people wait all night and are never permitted entry).  

At one of the bars (there are 3 on the main level and a few on "the beach" upstairs) the bartender sadly informed me that the best I could get with my free drink wristband is a Skyy and Red Bull.  Expecting a slap in the face from my high-maintenance friends, instead, he received squeals of delight.  Obviously, he isn't aware that we're girls who prefer top shelf but are just as happy shotgunning beers at a tailgate party.

After a delicious dinner at Tao (review to follow) we effortlessly re-entered the club upstairs.  There are three dance areas:  The large one on the main floor, one in a side room, and one upstairs at "the beach."  Beware of the single man that groups of guys send out to find cute girls and drag back to their table lair caveman style.

Being in a female-only group (although a male co-worker of mine was running around this place like a kid in a candy store) allowed us to receive the ultimate VIP treatment at this sexy "see and be scene" club.  It's nice having men in suits repeatedly request your presence at their special tables & VIP rooms with curtains - but not when the men's faces resemble that SNL skit where cousins breed with each other and spawn deformed offspring.  Also, the married men who were there to prove they "still got it" proved to be a little trying.  Come on, guys, do you think that we don't notice you keeping your left hands in your pockets, excusing yourselves to the restroom, coming back and gesturing with a tan-lined finger?  NiceGirl rule #84:  Don't do the nasty with guys who are taken.  Period.

Note: the restrooms are marked "Yin" and "Yang."  A little tipsy, I mistakenly wandered into the Yin room and saw a guy's Yang.  Not advisable (unless timed strategically after consuming copious amounts of high-proof liquor).


My favorite part?  "The Beach" upstairs.  Poolside setting (which is actually a hot place for sun and fun during the day), sexy environment, and a cool breeze to help you feel relaxed.

The motto of this Asian-inspired place is, "Always a Happy Ending."   Wow, that's gutsy.  Take with this what you like, but right around 4 am, Lindsey and I were forced to make a hasty retreat when the lights slightly brightened and the 4 am "bed partner" scramble began.  
Sorry dudes, we don't care if you do play for the Giants or really make that much money.  This is Vegas - everyone is a star.

(Review of buffet only)

Interesting choice of location to set up a new Indian buffet on the east side of town considering you have Mint, India Masala, Origin India, Gandhi, and Taste of India all within a 2 mile radius, although I think it's the others that should be intimidated, since the new kid in town has got some bhangra swagger.  Pretty much all of its rivals are in little strip malls of varying degrees of  decay, so this should not deter you in terms of its exterior.  Once you step inside, the modern decor with track lighting, single open room layout, and seemingly endless linear display of offerings along the buffet line should set your mind at ease.  

Upon being seated, you are immediately prompted if you would like naan bread with your buffet.  Not only should you say yes, but you should specifically request the garlic naan since the aroma alone with the freshly minced garlic and finishing brush of ghee emanating from the freshly cut bread removed from the tandoori oven is intoxicating enough to get your appetite revved up on the feast that lies ahead (refills are complimentary if you need more)

As one approaches the buffet line, the first wave of offerings include various meats including the standards such tandoori, tikki masala, and curry chicken along with some wild cards such as goat curry and reshmi kababs, which is a ground chicken meatball that seems a bit healthier than the sauced meats.   The latter half of the line offers a multitude of vegetarian offerings including saag paneer (spinach), chana masala (spicy stewed chickpeas), eggplant, mixed curry veggies, and lentils.  The third category of offerings is the carbs, which in this case included plain basmati, a spicy chicken biryani, mini-samosas (which gives you more of the flaky crust to enjoy, much like why mini-pecan pies are superior to regular pecan pie), idli (a steamed rice cake), and something I've never seen before, a spongy savory cake called dhokla, which I've read to be a beloved street snack in the southern part of India.  It has a cornbread-like consistency, a rich yellow hue from turmeric and mustard seeds, and is served with some chili peppers, cilantro, and toasted coriander seeds.  Add a dollop of tamarind, and it is a pretty addictive combo of flavors which I would have had more of had I not discovered it at the end of my meal.  

I almost never have room for desserts after an Indian buffet but it is a rotating mix of gulab jamun(sweet milk balls), rice pudding, gajar halwa (carrots+milk), and a few offerings of fruit which I am always a bit wary of when it comes to buffets in general.  

Service was very good in which plates were cleared and water was refilled efficiently, and the staff checked in a few times to see how I was enjoying the meal.  Compared to the local competition, price point is excellent (9.99 vs 10.99 at India Masala, and 12 and up at Mint and Gandhi), quality of food is definitely in my top 3 in Vegas (Mount Everest and Taj Palace), and highlights include the garlic naan, balance in offerings between vegetarian and meat dishes,  a few unique offerings (mini samosas and dhokla), and ambiance.  India Masala is still my go-to choice for take out buffet due to quantity (refer to my review for my patented packing technique) as well as complimentary Mango Lassi with yelp check-in, but if I'm dining in, Delhi Indian is my new go-to place for quality when I plan to go on an Indian carb feeding frenzy for lunch.

Pop Quiz:  
Would you prefer a sports bar, with a lot of beer specials on tap? 
Or...  a nice restaurant, that has a good beer selection?

Well, I'm more in the second group.  Though I do enjoy a nice watering hole.  Zipps however fails the food test.  Well at least last night they did.

Yelp'er Scott D and I came here around 5:30 yesterday, to enjoy a cold beer and some good conversation.  I had ordered the chips, salsa and guacamole HH (photo) appetizer for $4.00.  The salsa was a puree of something red and didn't have much kick or taste.  The Guac had an odd texture, with I believe saute onions in it.  Again, no taste, no cilantro, no Pico and nothing special.

We did like the beer.  Zipps runs 32 ounce specials for $3.75 on various beers. We had the Michelob and it was great.  We also each ordered some of their pizza wedges for $2.00 each.  The pepperoni was just okay, while the sausage had a faint fennel taste to it.

If our food order stopped there, I might have been inclined to give them three stars.  But as we were getting our checks, my daughter called and asked if I would get her some takeout.  She asked for: "Golden medium wings ($7.50) and a order of 1/2 Fries and 1/2 Onion Rings ($3.25) along with some extra Golden Sauce ($0.50)".

When I got home, she opened the boxes and we couldn't believe what we were given.  The Onion rings were charred burnt and inedible, while the fries were a cold soggy mush.  The chicken however wasn't bad.

So "Two Stars" M'eh. Yes, we've experienced better.  Return factor, Zero.

It's sleek, chic and modern with state-of-the-art amenities. 

We came to Vegas for our anniversary and booked our room for three nights back in November. They have several VIP and weekend packages, and we opted for the $100 buy-back option. You can spend $100 on any outlet to charge to your room and can get compensated for it. Pretty good deal, I might say. All in all, I was pretty impressed by Aria. 

The Lobby/Front Desk area was decorated in fall-themed motif and gives it a welcoming experience. It's pretty spacious and not too cluttered unlike in some other hotels. My only negative comment is the provided seatings weren't too comfortable. They could be museum-piece seatings, but not too friendly on the tush. There is a huge waterfall element designed outside the building that has a calming and relaxing effect. 

Security were stationed in every Elevator Landing so that is a plus in my book. I hate the smell of cigarette smoke, but walking thru their casino was pretty bearable even with plenty of smokers sucking on their cancer sticks was on every table. It wasn't fresh air by all means, but the ventilation unit did its job. 

They have several bars, restaurants, a buffet, clubs and a Jean Phillipe Chocolatier. You can also catch a Cirque Du Soleil show called Zarakana. Concierge and Front Desk were friendly and efficient. Didn't have to deal with Valet since they have a self-park option. (I don't like dealing with Valets since dings and dents always magically appear out of nowhere every time I deal with them) Luckily, I found a parking spot on the 2nd floor near the exit leading to the bridge. The parking stalls are pretty spacious and they have several floors that could easily fit thousands of cars. 

The room - What can I say?

First their key cards are the latest generation and integration of a microchips key access card that doesn't require you to insert the card into a slot. Just wave the card in front of the door handle unit and voila. 

As soon as you open the door, the mood lights and music turn on simultaneously and the curtain automatically opens to give you a wonderful view of the strip. It's pretty breathtaking and gets you in the mood for some bump-n-grind if you're thinking with your other head. 

Subliminal? Nah...these guys know what they're doing for sure. 

You can also control the lighting, TV, music, curtain, temperature and almost everything else inside the room with a touch of a button or with the remote control. Everything is fully integrated and we even have free Wi-Fi in the room. The shower head in the bathroom is effin enormous and spacious and the even the bathtub. The toilet is located on the side and you can do your business in private. I also love the texture of their towels. 

And lastly, we happen to bump into Hunter Pence during breakfast and took a picture with him. My smile must have been as wide as the Grand Canyon.

Middle Eastern food on the strip!  SLS players club offered $30 off of $60 during my birthday month so that made it a clear choice on a recent Monday night.  It was packed at 8:30pm with quite a few people waiting outside.  I'd suggest making a reservation.  Being the middle ground between casual eateries at the resort (Umami) and high end (Bazaar Meat) makes it easy to see why Cleo is so popular.

The menu offered a lot to ponder over, but my mind was already set on one thing....falafel!  It's not easy to find a good version of those deep fried balls of chickpea/fava bean heaven around these parts, but the ones they're serving up here are falawesome.  The light crunch of the exterior went into delicious, warm legume center that was well spiced.  My only regret was not ordering the side of hummus since the amount that arrived with the plate wasn't even enough for three balls let alone seven.  

A minor complaint was that while six of the balls were dark green on the inside, one was very pale green.  It didn't taste much different...still... can you imagine if Robert DeNiro's character from the film "Casino" saw this?  He would have ripped the chef a new one and then made sure he personally saw to every falafel that came out of the kitchen!  

"Kibbeh Nayyeh": chopped raw lamb accompanied with mint, bulgar and lebaneh, was my wife's favorite dish.  It was unlike any other tartare I'd ever had.  The creaminess of the lebaneh (Lebanese yogurt cheese) blended so well with the meat and the toasted parmesan crackers to spread it on.

I found the shawarma portion to be very small for $8 and would definitely pay more for a full lamb entre or just get kebabs instead.  The moussaka was below average and we didn't even bother finishing it before ordering the impressively rich and decadent sticky toffee dessert.  

There are plenty of other menu items worth checking out on a repeat visit like grilled octopus, flatbreads, and multiple mezzes.  I don't plan on being a stranger.

Recently featured as a ROTD, my BF and I came by for dinner. Prices are all over the place, with a few good deals but a lot need to come down a buck or two to be reasonable. We were one of two tables, yet our order took 25 minutes to come out and the entre was unacceptable in quality. 

FRIED MUSHROOMS: $7 for 8 button mushrooms. Lovely crispy breading.
FRIED PICKLES: $5, overbattered and greasy but sweet-and-spicy dipping sauce was awesome.
FOOTLONG CHILI DOG: $8, shriveled hotdog looked like jerky it was so overcooked and the chili looked and tasted like it came from a can. One of the worst things I've ever been served in a restaurant. Intended to split it with my guy, but neither of us would eat anything beyond that first bite.

Our waitress noticed our uneaten meal and we expressed our dissatisfaction. They offered to box it up but not to remake it. She removed the hotdog from our table, showed it to the female manager, Kelly, (who left the scene and never returned), and brought us our check along with a comment card, stating that "the system" did not "allow" her to give any "discounts" but that we were welcome to leave feedback. The hotdog was still on the bill despite being sent back because it was inedible.

We asked to speak to management (who should have taken the initiative to come speak to us), and the male owner, Robert, came out and asked what the problem was.  We again reiterated that the hotdog was inedible, both looking and tasting like it was made yesterday. 

His response? A defensive, "Well that's just like, your opinion." Literally. His exact response, no irony whatsoever. He then went on to rant about how he's "not afraid of bad Yelps" and his food is made to order and if we're dissatisfied that's our prerogative and it must be our first visit because he "doesn't give discounts."
In the end, unable to reach a civil agreement, we were given the ultimatum to pay in full for a half-uneaten meal or he "could comp the whole thing, whatever."  I assume that was intended as a bluff but I simply left. 

I like their concept, but management is completely unprofessional and has no idea how to run a business or a restaurant- which was evident when they were featured on the show Hungry Investors.  Clearly they were unable to benefit from the publicity and learn from the experience- the same issues that held them back then are still here now.

EDIT: As of the time of this review, there are nearly 70 "filtered" reviews at the bottom of this page. If that's not a red flag, I don't know what is. Most of them are single-star experiences with terrible service and/or food as well.

After a nice dinner and a great time in DTLV with Terri R, our last stop for the evening was dessert. In fact, we purposely put dessert aside because of all the hype that Kuma has been receiving the last couple of nights.  It seemed like every Vegas Yelper, at least the ones we knew, were checking in.  We were no different and had to see what's really going on.

Well, what's really going on?  For me, not much anyway.  My first impression of the place was cool.  I mean, this place is cold.  Kuma goes out of the way to make you feel like you're in an igloo with the their snow decor, polar bear, and even ice looking flooring.  My first thought, this place would be perfect to go to during the summer to just chill.  I mean that literally.  

As for their "snow cream", I wasn't too impressed. First of all, not fluffy like advertised.  That's no big because it's all about taste and satisfaction for me.  I opted for their Taro w/Red Bean, Mochi, and Capt N Crunch.  I thought taste was pretty good, but texture wasn't what I expected.  Again, I expected a fluffy snow type feel. What I got was texture close to froyo.  Taste wise, I'd give them 4 stars. 

But why the overall 3 stars?  Here's why;
1.  Selection:  Not much of a choice of flavors here.  I'm not saying there should be a plethora of flavors, but 5 just doesn't cut it for me.  

2.  Price:  You have choice of two sizes.  Their smaller size is their "Ninja" and their biggest size is their "Sumo".  Both are pricey, with the Ninja costing $5.  The cup size is huge, but this is where the disappointment starts.  Look at the pictures all over this joint and even the pictures that Kuma has posted.  You see their snow cream over-flowing at least 2 inches above the rim.  Now look at the pictures that Yelpers have posted, even mine.  You see skimpy portions and this is where they get you.  But I get it. Their $5 small is named Ninja for a reason.  Silent, but deadly....on your wallet that is. 

I'm giving this place 3 stars for now because Kuma is just A-Okay in my book.  I'm not saying I will never return.  I'm sure my daughter and nephews would love this place, especially since I'm Daddy Warbucks to them.  I just don't see myself going out of my way for Kuma.

Eek! Methinks not, indeed!

Okay, I never usually give a place a 1 star because I have this moral dilemma with it... BUT, I also never usually walk out of a restaurant. 

So, I walked in, was awkwardly greeted, and told to have a seat. It was lunch time, so the place was full, but not overflowing with stressed out customers. In all honesty, it was a typical lunchtime scenario inside. 

*I'd also like to note that I read reviews for slower than average service, so I was prepared to wait a little extra to try the food*

Once I sat down, I noticed the server bringing menus over to the patrons that entered immediately before me, but he never came over with one for me. I decided to patiently wait for the next five minutes. That's when I started overhearing the conversation at the table next to me, and to sum it up:

I don't know if we can stay and eat, we might have to get it to go.. We've been waiting a long time.

Again, that's not verbatim, but it's exactly along those lines. I figured the reviews were right about the food prep times, and continued to wait. 

After a few more minutes passed by, another couple walked in, were acknowledged and seated, and after a minute, they were given menus (This is about 8-10 minutes in). It was then that the server came over with water for the first couple that had walked in before me. He then walked back to the drink area and brought out two more glasses of water for the couple that came in almost ten minutes after me. With no menu, water or sense of appreciation for wanting to spend my money at Fresh Mint, I got up and walked out.

A good way to lose a customer is to not serve them. With service complaints since 2008 on Yelp, I really think something needs to be done. That was unbelievably insulting.

I like INSERT COIN(S), I really do. But any of you who have been there lately knows it's gotten REALLY scene-y. The people there aren't gamers, they're hipsters who just want to party downtown so they can tell everyone loudly and obscenely that they party downtown and would never be caught dead on the strip.

Uh, excuse me... you're blocking our game. You forgot this is a barcade, huh?

So when I heard about Hi-Scores, I was stoked... another chance to have a true gamer's space! And it's practically right down the street from me. So off I went to check out the new kid in town.

In gamer's terms, Hi-Scores is like "Super Ghouls 'n' Ghosts" -- an unnecessary sequel that doesn't make it out of Stage 1 before people give up on it.

First, Hi-Scores is actually two "businesses" -- Hi-Scores and The Player's Club. More about that later, but it's pretty much the same place.

Secondly, a good barcade should give you the feeling that you're partying in an arcade. I felt like I was in a warehouse a good portion of the time. There was very little theming, and the only reference to games on the menu was the Pac Man's Burger (meh) and a drink called the Centipede. But the specialty drink selection was pretty weak.

The bar in general is weak. Maybe I'm spoiled on skilled Vegas bartenders, but I ordered a Long Beach Iced Tea. For those who don't know, it's exactly like a Long Island Iced Tea, except you use cranberry juice instead of Coke. Now, I don't expect everyone to know that, but at a bar, it's pretty common knowledge. Instead, I get this from the server (who for what it's worth was really nice):

ME: Can I get a Long Beach Iced Tea?
SHE: You mean a Long Island.
ME: No, a Long Beach Iced Tea.
SHE: ...........
ME: A Long Beach?
SHE: What's that?
ME: It's a Long Island Iced Tea, except it's made with cranberry juice, not Coke.
SHE: ............ I'll see what we can do.

"See what we can do?" It's not that hard. Minus Coke. Plus cranberry juice. Voila!

I was excited to find out they had a kitchen, which IC doesn't have. Their kitchen staff, however, is obsessed with food on sticks. Our appetizer was Chinese meatballs (on sticks). For our entree, the Bestie got sliders (with big toothpicks through them) and I got Cajun beef (on skewers). The sliders were okay but super small, even for sliders. My Cajun beef was larger, but not that much better. Here's the thing: most of what they served, I could have done with a Crock-Pot and a trip to Trader Joe's. Yawn.

Here's the kicker: their game area is about the size of my living room. Four console stations, not playing anything wildly popular, two Golden Tee machines, a few pinball games and a couple of cabinets. The biggest hit in the room was a 4-player Pac-Man machine, which was busy all night.

Now, excuse me one dang minute, but HOW IN THE MAPPYLAND HELL are you going to try to pass yourself off as a bar-arcade and have a sorry-ass game area?

Sorry, gamers, but your Princess is in another Barcade.

Ellis Island, you are dead to me!

Oh Ellis Island, I have been a fan for over 10 years. I have been a loyal customer. I have sung your praises from mountain tops. I brought my friends to enjoy the goodness (or should I say former goodness) of your $7.99 steak dinner. But no more! After the experience I had last night, you are indeed now dead to me and hopefully to all the people who read this review.

Ellis Island, I stuck with the even after you continually raised the price of your steak dinner from $4.99 to $5.99 to $6.99 to what it is now $7.99.

Ellis Island, I stuck with you despite the increasingly awful service...your employees have no sense of urgency nor do they understand customer service.

Ellis Island, I stuck with you even after finding out that your "center cut sirloin" is indeed just beef scraps combined with meat glue, rolled up into a loaf and cut into "steaks."

But, after the experience I had last night with your obnoxious, insensitive, offensive, bully of a restaurant manager I will never visit your establishment again.

I arrived on a Monday night at 9:15pm very excited and hungry. I was really looking forward to a "steak" dinner. We were unenthusiastically "greeted" by a hostess who told us there was a 20 minute wait. Odd, the restaurant was more than half empty...in fact the casino was almost empty. The hostess then directed my attention to a printer paper sign stating the kitchen is being cleaned and anyone who arrives after 9:30 pm will only be able to order off of a limited menu. As we were given a 20 minute wait time I asked the hostess if we would be able to get the steak dinner...she said no. I told her we were there now and if we were seated by 9:30, the supposed cut off time, would we be able to order the steak dinner...she said no. I explained we came specifically for the steak dinner, having walked from the strip, and asked if there was any way we could get the steak dinner...she said no. I then asked to speak to the manager.

After a long wait the manager finally arrived...with a security guard. Really, a security guard? Please look at my Yelp picture...do I look like a threat? The manager stood about 2 inches from my face and proceeded to tell me No over and over again. He kept interrupting me when I pointed out his restaurant was empty, that the hostess was specifically giving wait times so that that people would have to order off the limited menu, etc. I told him his manner and policies were completely unacceptable. I finally just asked, "Am I going to be able to order a steak dinner?" He got even closer to me and yelled, "No!" I then informed him that I would make sure to tell everyone about this terrible experience and he yelled in a close and threatening manner, "Don't threaten me!" I told him that I was not threatening, just informing him that this is what is going to happen and this is what happens when people receive horrible customer service like this. We then walked out, while the manager continued to yell at us.

Amazing! I have never had an experience like this. Just an FYI to you my Yelp friends...this is the experience you can expect from Ellis Island. Inferior food, inferior service, all served up to you by a manager who is a bully. Enter at your own risk.

I have never fully appreciated nouveau cuisine. It has always left me a little hungry and a few Benjamins short. LOL 

Our introduction to Cantina Laredo was somewhat inauspicious, since they misplaced our reservations on a busy Friday night.  

We also had the same experience with the hostesses that fellow Yelp'er Teehee wrote about.  But in end, we had a nice evening, with our bill coming in at the low end.  

After the confusion and a five minute wait, we were seated near the patio. It was a nice location and we had the added bonus of observing a pre-wedding family dinner of eighteen. 

Cantina Laredo likes to market itself as serving "modern Mexican food in a sophisticated, vibrant atmosphere. ... with a Mexico City style menu."  I believe it's more Mexican petite nouveau cuisine. 

We started off with a delivery of chips and two types of salsa. The milder version had a nice tomato base. But it was the spicier one, with fire roasted peppers that was the standout. It was complex and so delicious, that you could have eaten it with a spoon. 

Next was their table-side guacamole making called Top Shelf for $9.99. It was an exquisite. Now I make this all the time at home, yet it always seems tastier when someone else is doing it. LOL

Somewhere along the way our white honey sangria was dropped off. It was very good and fairly priced served in large 12 oz flute glass. Nice!

For dinner we decided to share two entrees. One was their Vera Cruz Enchiladas (photo), which was a nice mixture of spinach and chicken for $13.99; and the other was the Carnitas Tacos for $13.79.  The enchiladas had a nice flavor and kick. Both were very good, with the street tacos seeming deceptively small. 

The bill came to about $30 a person including drinks, but before taxes and gratuities. 

So Four Stars, and yes we are Fans of Cantina Laredo. While eating here might not get you a doggie bag for later, you will go home feeling as though you've enjoyed something special.  Remember to make reservations like we did! LOL

If this is a new trend of having tasty steamed buns ("bao" if you read it in Cantonese) following a foot race I'm loving it!  

I had the pleasure of ordering and eating from this food truck (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/great-bao-las-vegas?select=IYXd86zCnkTdXHihCywYNg#RRkCwVYiUUhxC2gY4bScQA) back in December after participating in the Las Vegas Great Santa Run as it and another dozen or so food trucks were all lined up in the race assembly area ready to feed the nearly 10,000 Santas who turned out for the event.

The Great Bao truck was easily one of the more popular trucks with a steady line of people ordering food and another group waiting for their orders.  I waited too, but it was until the crowds diminished before I put in my order.  The menu was pretty simple (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/great-bao-las-vegas?select=IYXd86zCnkTdXHihCywYNg#nLQH80BQIF9oW2S7iGVl1g).  They basically had four types of steamed buns, bagged chips and refreshments.  The buns were pretty inexpensive at $3.50 each or 3 for $10.  The 3 bao combo also included a drink and a bag of chips!

I'm not sure what I was thinking when I placed an order for 2 buns instead of 3.  I didn't realize my mental breakdown until I had paid for my order.  Maybe it was the temporary meltdown of having run hard for a short distance race or maybe I was just wacky from seeing all that red from the people in Santa suits at every direction I turned.  Anyway, I ordered 1 Roast Duck bao and 1 Pork Belly bao and nothing else since I had collected an armful of race refreshments from other event sponsors.

By this time the staff had their routine down to perfection, and my made to order steamed buns (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/great-bao-las-vegas?select=IYXd86zCnkTdXHihCywYNg#Sd1ztJyGREFdt-vAbJi7ng) were ready lickety-split.

The Roast Duck bao was delicious.  The plum sauce was just sweet enough as to not overpower the taste of the roast duck, and I loved that they included a piece of green onion which reminded me of the Peking Duck and steamed clamshell buns we enjoy at Chinese banquets.  The piece of duck I had, however, was a bit dry and slightly burned as you can probably notice in the photo that I've posted.

I lucked out on the Pork Belly bao as they gave me a huge piece of pork belly with very little fat on it.  Even though there was a sauce, a smidgeon of what looked like minced pickled veggies and a sprig or two of fresh cilantro all I could really taste was the delicious pork belly and the subtle sweetness of the steamed bun.

This was my first experience with any Las Vegas food truck and I liked it ... a lot!

Came in on a Wednesday night and sat inside, part eatery and Sports bar. I liked how each booth had a flat screen but there were flat screens and sofas if you just wanted to relax as if you're at home!

I opted for a booth but had great views of the entire place for decent people watching. I started off with a cold green tea which was flavorless. My waitress who was there physically but mentally absent took my order for BBQ wings , onion rings and the  B.U.B burger. I specifically requested the wings first and others to follow later but within minutes after the wings arrived the other two items appeared. When the waitress returned and I advised her what happened and her reply was the kitchen was caught up!  The food was decent but I was pleased mostly with the wings. The onion rings were too large, under cooked and a few had too much batter. The burger which contained two large slices of beef, bacon bits and contained another slice of bread which I removed. The burger was overcooked and on the dry side. I was ready to order peanut butter ice cream but the absent minded waitress didn't even bother asking if I wanted dessert and just left me my tab. It's ashame an establishment put this much time and money into this business and yet they have such a sad and unmotivated employee interacting directly with clients. I made sure I tipped accordingly which I thought was still generous.

Compared to my first experience outside at the Umami Beer Garden, this was a horrible experience. Such a disappointing dining experience. If I ever returned here, I will make sure and request not to be seated in the area of this waitress!

I've been looking for a great Persian restaurant since my last dining experience at Doostan. It was quite a drive for me, but I enjoyed the food so much that I came for dinner twice within the same week. The vibe seemed subdued from the lack of patrons, but the quiet atmosphere made it a cozy place to bring dates and small gatherings. Along with the front patio, there was a full bar situated next to the entrance. Past the partition was the dining area with scores of smaller tables surrounding the long vertical one for large gatherings. The blue, purple, and beige dcor nicely complemented the warm lighting and a number of paintings on the walls.

Their complementary pita bread was thick, fluffy, and pillow-like with a hint of smoke. It was a great starter with Halim Bademjan ($7.50) assembled with fried eggplant, tomatoes, garlic, onions, and other seasoning. The consistency was not as thick or flavorful as the one at Flame International. However, the pronounced garlic flavor was a hit when added to the soft smoky pita. My only wish was for the eggplant flavor to stand out more. It was good, but not mind blowing.

The Lamb Shish-Kebab ($21) was put together with chunks of marinated lamb, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, and at my request, cherry rice ($4.50).  The lamb was tender and moist with full-on flavor. The cuts were chewy, but I could taste the saffron as the mix of cherry was delicious in the basmati. For the price, I wished there could be more cherries in the basmati, but the lamb made quite an impression. 

The Chicken Shish-Kebab ($17) arrived with charbroiled marinated chicken breast, bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and choice of dill and lima beans rice ($4.5). The chicken came with tremendous wow factor: super moist, juicy, and flavorful. The dill and lima beans basmati was not overpowering, and instead the taste was complementary to the chicken.

The Cornish Hen Kebob ($17) was equally outstanding. This dish came with an entire Cornish Hen served bone-in, and each piece was evenly cooked to perfection to render a meaty juicy sensation. The cherry rice was again a hit. I will go the distance whenever I can find cherry rice. 

Lastly, the Salmon Kebob ($18.50) came with marinated salmon and basmati rice mixed with fresh garlic, dill weed, parsley & cilantro. The salmon was tender but slightly overdone. The rice had a smooth refined flaovr as a secondary to provide depth. I wasn't particularly blown away by this dish, especially since the previous dishes were really outstanding. Among them, I'm still partial to the Lamb and Chicken Kebob. 

Service was inconsistent, as my dining companion drank from a dirty glass without knowing it until the end of his meal. My second visit fared much better. The server was knowledgeable, friendly, highly attentive, and invited us to return. Here's one of the few legitimate places to grab Persian cuisine in this area. I'd be very interested in coming back to try the Persian Ice Cream, Baklava, and Zoombia & Bamieh.

We walked in here without a reservation on a Saturday night and ate at the bar.  I am super late on the Honey Salt bandwagon.  So much so that I might as well be writing a review on this cool new show called "Breaking Bad".  I mean, the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich has similar qualities to meth...so I've heard anyways.  

The creamless corn soup intrigued my wife the most and she loved it.  The charred kernels and arugula oil was kind of a shock at initial taste but it grew on her quickly and she already plans to order it the next time we're there.  

I got "My Wife's Favorite Salad" consisting of duck confit, arugula, frise, pine nuts, roasted bing cherries, and a farm fresh poached egg.  This was terrific and I only wished there was even more duck but I am sure everyone feels that way.  I thought the mix of flavors were really good.  

We split the Colorado Lamb porterhouse for the entree.  It came with bacon sofrito, pea tendrils, roasted fingerling potatoes, and balsamic reduction.  I'd never had lamb prepared this way and thought it was quite creative.  The lamb was a little more done than I wanted it to be but it was still juicy.  Like all good porterhouses, I found myself gnawing on the bone with my bare hands at the end.  

Our super friendly (and fellow Red Sox fan from Andover, MA) bartender lightly twisted our arm into getting "The Brookie" for dessert which the menu describes "chocolate chip cookie meets chocolate fudge brownie, with vanilla bean ice cream".  You should definitely try this if you like but are really tired of chocolate lava cake.  I feel so jaded typing that last sentence.  

Overall it was great.  What's not to like about this spot?

I had an appearance at the Chandler Performing Arts Center across the street on Saturday, January 25th.  My wife and I decided to make a road trip out of it and had intended on arriving a couple of days early to visit with family and do some sightseeing. Since I used to live in Arizona, I wanted to show her around a bit.  Our reservation was for the two bedroom Presidential Suite.  We arrived in Chandler at 7:10 pm, after driving for nearly eight hours.  We pull up to the valet station, but there is no valet in sight.  We leave our car in front and go up to the check-in desk and ask about the valet/bell hop.  The gentleman behind the counter (I didn't get his name) informs us that the valet/bell hop service ends at 7pm and that we had "just missed it"  We then proceed to at least check in to our room. The gentleman tells us that the Presidential Suite is occupied. My wife and I were both in disbelief.  He said that the current occupant is there for two nights and we were scheduled to stay four nights, so we could move rooms once it's available.  To make up for the inconvenience, we were promised all sorts of comps including "free breakfast" coupons.  My wife and I were so livid and tired we just wanted to lay down.  All we requested is for our rooms to be adjoined.  While the hotel clerk was scrambling to find us rooms, another gentleman named Brandon recognized me and offered to take our bags to our room.  Once we arrived in our rooms, we discovered that our rooms were NOT adjoining.  The next morning, we were contacted by the front desk to alert us that the Presidential Suite was available, but it only had one bedroom.  The other room would be "close by"  We decided to just stay put in our original rooms.  At least they were next to each other and fortunately, the rooms are very nice.  Leading up to the night of my performance, I wanted to get my pants pressed. I called the front desk and I was told that there is no laundry service on the weekends. So, no valet or bell service after 7 and no laundry service on the weekends.  I have never heard of this!  I thought these were just standard hotel services.  I later get a knock on my door by a hotel employee delivering our "free breakfast" coupons.  I mention the "no laundry on weekends" policy and she confirmed it, but offered to press my pants for me.  Unfortunately, I didn't get her name  but I'm certain I got this service because she also recognized me.   Regardless of that, I did appreciate that.  

My wife and I decided to check out a day early, since we'd prefer to be home together instead of in separate rooms.  When we checked out we were given our room charges bill and there were no comps or free breakfasts.  Needless to say, if we ever return to Chandler, we will not be staying at the Crowne Plaza.

Dear owners of Commonwealth, 

You built an amazing bar and a beautiful space.   Good beer and drink selection too.  It really could be called the crown jewel of the "new downtown".  Too bad you ruined it by running it like a douchey club that interferes with a patron's ability to relax and charges ridiculous prices.

The space you built is exceptional -- quirky design mixing elements of a lounge and upscale European chateau with laidback couches, chandeliers, a rooftop patio with an open air bar.  The drink selection is excellent -- great selection of beers and some nice creative cocktails.  After 5 minutes in your business, I thought it was a solid 5 star rating all the way.  

But why . . . why are you running this place like a douche magnet?  Why the hell would you build a lounge-like pub and then refuse to let people sit on the weekends without paying for "bottle service"?  Seriously.  Why the hell would locals ever frequent a place where they can't sit down without paying 1000% mark up on a bottle of liquor?  And putting a velvet rope outside with a bouncer to control access to your bar?  What the hell?  And no happy hour?  And no prices on the beer menu?  That's not classy.  It's just annoying.  I guess I understand wanting to hide your prices given that you're charging the tourist/rip off rate for drinks.   

I've visited your bar twice and I can officially say I'm done.  I won't be coming back and won't be bringing visitors.  You're absolutely a one-and-done type of bar.  Most everyone I know who's visited, has not gone back.  Too expensive, too douchey, too uninterested in wanting people to come back.

A piece of advice: in 6 months to a year when you're not the hip new kid on the block anymore and start to notice that your bar is pretty much empty until 9 pm (like Insert Coins), start making changes to encourage locals to be repeat customers: 1) Get a happy hour, 2) lose the stupid velvet rope, 3) let people sit down without buying $100+ of liquor.  Treat your customers like you want them there and don't just want to bilk them out of their money.  Start trying to earn their money by having an inviting bar and you'll bring the locals in.  Don't and you'll be closed by the end of 3-5 years.

This is a great spot to pick up lunch. A newer location opened up closer to my home but I just feel comfy and familiar at this PB. Being a bakery and cafe, they offer lunch and breakfast. They have some tasty options when it comes to breakfast you can choose from bagels, pastries, souffles, breakfast sandwiches and fresh baked bread. It wouldn't be breakfast if coffee wasn't offered so they do have a nice variety of options for that too. The lunch menu is my favorite. I love that they introduce new salads & sandwiches, but also love that they bring back old seasonal favorites. The "You Pick 2" option is great. I love that I can switch it up between soup, salad, and sandwiches. I have eaten inside this location a couple times, but usually just phone my order in and pick it up. They have a program called "My Panera" that you should look into if you plan on eating here more then once. You can earn free food and other cool stuff. I am able to log in online and check the status of my rewards. Please note that currently if you have a freebie and don't use it for 60 days that it will expire. This last visit I saw a sign that they offer catering. I never thought of PB for catering needs, but I bet it is a big hit at most offices. 

My absolute favorite sandwich from PB is the "Roasted Turkey Artichoke Panini"and it really hit the spot last night it is so good! I get the "Broccoli Cheddar Soup" and love dipping my panini into it. Such a nice combo and a comforting meal no matter what time of year it is. I'm glad we have PB!

This location is in a small strip mall with other popular places and the parking lot can be packed. Patience is key!

It's a sad story that you hear every once in a while, a grand opening kick off party setting low expectations. I'm guessing they will learn to iron out the kinks here though.

With a weekend packed full of stuff scheduled through the Yelp events page, I was excited to cap off Saturday Night with a grand opening party at Gypsy Bar. We heard that theres an adult's only arcade in there, and skee ball is the wifes fave! I liked what Gypsy Bar is doing with the arcade, bar, dance club atmosphere. Apparently, so does half of sun city's most eligible bachelors; the dance floor seemed to ooze ben gay. I wasn't so excited, waiting about 10+ minutes for the bar staff to notice me standing right in front of them, waiving my arms in hopes that they would grace me with their presence. "Vodka diet, and a diet coke for the DD please" I said without hesitating; I didn't want to miss my opportunity. $10 later, I wouldn't call it a cheap drink, but I certainly am glad they didn't charge $12 to pour some kettle one into my cocktail; it's about what I was expecting.

We spent a few minutes checking everything out and another 45 minutes or so playing air hockey, skee ball, basket ball, and other games of the arcade variety. My best skee ball score was 34,000, in case you were wondering. I could have done better though, given enough time, money, and dedication to achieving the high score.

I considered busting out my uber white guy moves on the dance floor, but I wasn't really into the 80's / 90's remix the DJ was spinning. Sir mix alot isn't on my personal play list and for good reason. 

In need of some personal validation, I was bounced from the girl at the door, to the bar staff (another 10 minute wait by the way), and ultimately the maitre d' desk at Lucky Strike next door to get my CityScape parking ticket stamped. Save yourself some time and skip bouncing from staff member to staff member; go directly to Lucky Strike to get your ticket validated too.

I'll likely check them out again down the line, but I won't be running out the door to make a night of it if there's something better to do on a Friday or Saturday. 

Sorry Gypsy Bar, that's just how I saw it. Happy Yelping Phoenix.

I had read some great Yelp reviews about this place and anything Keller has got to be good. So I figured when in Rome....

Or is it when at the Venetian do as the French do?  Very confusing. So as I swaggered out of the hotel in the morning to my trade show at the convention center I made a 6:30 dinner reservation for later that night. Oh man it smelled good, I almost stayed for breakfast.

After a long day at the convention center, it came time for dinner and man I couldn't wait to dive into Bouchon and do a French belly flop!  

I was immediately seated and my first (of many) waiters came to get me started off. I'm not much of a wino so I asked about the beer selection they had to offer and settled on a dark pumpkin spice number.

The 2nd was  bringing some bread shells and pistachio's  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bouchon-las-vegas?select=w-8xsdNVt1DXAJhXaGNLsw#gQ8-2YOTknwRmAxwp1fVEw   as the 3rd waiter was showing me the menu. A newsprint deal that wrapped around the cutlery and napkin.  Crap! I told the waiter I don't have my glasses and can hardly see. The restaurant was dim and oozed romance too bad I was alone and blind. But waiter #3 to the rescue! He had a mini LED flashlight and I was able to read the menu and find some choices for my dinner!

French onion soup ... What else? I love FR Onion soup and Bouchon's soup is no slouch. It kicked ass! One of the best I've ever eaten. 4.5*****Stars http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=yXvxjUxdZxTXkv4b1pp6HA&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw
I finished every drop!

SALAD: ... Salade Marachre au Chvre Chaud
I can't even pronounce half of that, but it was a great fru fru salad with a tasty hunk of goat cheese and a delish red wine dressing, I ate every leaf of that bad boy. 4.****Stars

ENTREE: ... I ordered the Steak Frites. OMG that steak was heavenly! Melt in my mouth tender, juicy and  topped with caramelized shallots & matre d'htel butter (light garlic butter and caramelized onion medley). One of the best steaks I've ever eaten. The mountain of shoe string fries never got limp or soggy and were a perfect match for my steak. 5****Stars

DESERT: ... I managed to strike up a conversation with the guy to my left, who it turns out was the Keller resturants IT guy who was visiting for work, he suggested the Poire Belle Hlne for my dessert. OK I'm game I said. The poached pear and hazelnut ice cream with a chocolate sauce was spot on. Too bad my camera died, but my tongue was working overtime on this insider tip. 5*****Stars

The restaurant is impeccable and the service here is top notch!  I had a great experience here and can't wait to come back again.

I have been to this restaurant on several occasions, including my most recent experiences with their brunch menu. The atmosphere was much more upbeat in the morning than their dinner hours. Facing the street was the open bar accompanied by the sunny patio. On this Sunday, the lazy sunshine was slowly triggering through its rustic interior. 

I highly recommend their Eggs Benedict ($13). My dish came with perfectly poached eggs, English muffin, hollandaise sauce, crispy potatoes, and smoked salmon. The thick cut smoked salmon was delicious and not too salty. The thick gooey hollandaise sauce added refinement to the fantastic doughy texture of the English muffin. There was great purpose, balance and distribution of flavors. The potatoes were lightly salted and quite addictive. It had all the elements I was looking for in a benedict. 

I also enjoyed the Fall Squash Risotto ($13) served with crispy pork belly, squash, parmesan, rosemary honey, and risotto. The pork belly was nicely marbled to provide a nice contrast to the perfectly executed risotto. I wished this dish could come with more squash to accompany the risotto, but otherwise it's a dish I'd order again.

The Farmer's Market Frittata ($10) was really fantastic too. It came with oyster mushrooms, asparagus, cheddar, arugula, tomato, and other seasonal vegetables layered on top of the omelet. The combination of veggies was fresh and the range of diverse flavors further complicated the omelet at the bottom. It's a lighter alternative than the benedict, but we still had plenty of leftover to take home.

The dishes that did not live up to my expectations were the Cinnamon Roll ($5) and the Iron Skillet Pancake ($8). The Cinnamon Roll was expensive but also humongous and good to share. It tasted dry, bread-like, and lacked the full on moisture that I prefer in a cinnamon roll. It's a novelty and highly visible at every table, but unfortunately not something I'll be ordering again. 

The Iron Skillet Pancake came with olive oil, dark chocolate, berry compote, whipped cream, and maple syrup. The price was too steep for a single pancake. The pancake was easy to cut into until the sticky crispy outer ring. The berry compote was overwhelming the dark chocolate, but it was still a decent pancake without the expected wow factor.

My dining companion did not enjoy the coffee, so it's not something I would recommend. Service can be inconsistent, but friendly and responsive when you have their attention. There's not a lot of innovative breakfast and brunch restaurants in the Phoenix area, so St. Francis is a solid option for those looking for conventional wisdom with a twist of refinement. The other downside to the experience was parking. They have a small lot, and the required valet can be frustrating as you wait for your car when it is parked right in front of you. 

With all considered, 3.5 stars for the overall experience. I'd be interested in coming back for dinner.

Many Las Vegans have declared that pursuing authentic Taiwanese food in this town is like finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. My ever-growing curiosity in this uniquely ethnic cuisine, as well as guidance from people who are knowledgeable about this food has led me to Noodle Pot. I can say, without a shadow of doubt, that this establishment has superseded  my expectations!

Following a brief stop at the Shavery, I ran into Will (a.k.a. the artist formerly known as SnowFlake), along with a couple of Yelper's, and we decided to go to Noodle Pot. I have driven past this joint many times without thinking twice to stop in. It was a startling revelation to learn that, according to Will, Noodle Pot has some truly legitimate  Taiwanese grub in Vegas. Most notably, I wanted to try the national dish of Taiwan, spicy beef noodle soup.

I admire extraordinary mom-and-pop, hole-in-the-wall resto's, and Noodle Pot fits the bill to a tee. The comfortable yet lively vibe keeps the interaction going. After the server sat us down, we ordered some appetizers along with the spicy beef noodle soup.

Cold Vegetable Appetizer Plate - The first time I ordered this it came with pickled cucumbers and other vegetables, and wheat gluten. The cucumbers were marvelous, with the correct amount of saltiness to harmonize with the sweetness used in the sauce. The wheat gluten was another smash hit. It tasted incredibly akin to a concoction of beef and chicken. 

(Note: Coming here on a separate visit, and ordering this dish again, they had replaced the wheat gluten with soy sauce hard-boiled eggs. I notably did not enjoy them, and I was not too confident to which tree the egg grows on, but that's just me ((hehe)).

Pork and Chive Dumplings - Another sublime feature! The dumpling wrappers tasted hand made, and the filling inside was outstanding with perfectly tender pork matching the bright flavor of the chives. The vinegary soy sauce dip was the icing on the cake.

Beef Roll - My least favorite item, but pretty splendid nonetheless. Slices of beef and cilantro wrapped around a thin crepe. I actually prefer other Chinese versions that use a thicker, flakier scallion pancake in which the inside is coated with hoisin sauce. But, it was delish.

Spicy Beef Noodle Soup - the "Pice de rsistance" to our meal. We opted for the wide noodles instead of the regular noodles (think of it as thicker version of pappardelle). The noodles were perceived as if they were hand made and hand pulled, even though they probably came from a special noodle factory. The broth was nuts! It was packed with beef flavor, but exceptionally delicate. Hints of tomato added depth. Large portions of tender beef dotted the soup. Also, if the server has not brought out the chopped pickled cilantro, ask for it. That combined with the baby bok choy in the soup will give the dish a marvelous variation!

Many have mentioned this before, but I will proclaim it again. CASH ONLY!!! Save the plastic for the surgeon's table! :D

(Another side note: I took my brother here when he visited and at the time they had run out of beef so we opted for the Spicy Beef Tendon Soup. Even though I was fine, my brother returned home and had the hershey squirts for the next few days. The soup comes with a tremendous amount of tendons, so if you are not used to eating lots of offal or weird animal bits, I would be cautious when ordering this version).

I've had this bookmarked for a while and realized it was closed weekends. Now that our days off are weekdays and our friends who have the same day off as us live in the SW, it was time to finally check something off my list that has been sitting there, patiently, for years. 

We were gonna order off the menu until we were told the two specialty sandwiches. There was a yellow curry chicken sandwich and a moroccan sandwich that had north african spices, goat cheese, red bellpepper, etc. Both sandwiches were great sounding so we chose those. I liked the moroccan a bit more, but only because Im a sucker for those flavors combos. The bread was nice, good balance of crusty and softer bready center. 

Got the ice tea of the day - green tea citrus gingko which was refreshing. I like places the brew fresh, and brew something a bit more unique that plain black. 

The service was really friendly - it was the owner of the place at the counter. He was super enthusiastic and caring of his place. They brought out our food outside and came to check on everyone outside which I didn't expect. It is always a nice touch for counter service places to still have some sort of service. 

I think the price to quality ratio was very good. It seems they use better products with an emphasis on natural, healthy choices and nice to have places not charge a arm to get fresh choices.

I can see why people like this as their casual lunch spot. I think there are other similar sandwich and coffee type cafes like these you can compare it to, and this I think this probably ranks top notch among them. I will be back to try more and try a specialty drink next time now that it's near places we frequent.

I'm agitated by the time I sit down with my food. 

So many different eateries I go to, I understand the delivery system. Self-serve, buffet, seat yourself, order/pay at counter then take that thingamajig number to your table, and of course my favorite, full wait help service! But at Taco y Taco, I look at the menu board, see the different ordering stations, the cashier to the side, and I don't understand! I do understand, I just don't see how it's a good system. 

So if I wanted an Al Pastor taco, I stand and wait in that line, then if I want a quesadilla for my son, I wait in this other line, order, and wait for that.  Which line is to order the corn? Each station has a couple of guys back in that general area, but you don't know who takes what order, you just wait till someone asks you or make eye contact with one. So finally, I pile all my food onto a tray and make it to the cashier line, wait, pay, then wait at the salsa bar line. Yes, I'm serious. Hallelujah, I finally get to sit, only to realize I forgot my napkins. Where's the napkins line?

I've tried this location twice. I won't review the food, because I don't think I've tasted enough of these tacos elsewhere to know how good they are comparatively. Food was ok, I don't crave any to go back in a hurry. Plus, I've heard about their recent health demerits. 

I appreciate  the music and the vibe, and that they offer vegetarian options. I liked sitting upstairs and prices are reasonable. Will I be back? Probably not. I'm not on the Taco y Taco bandwagon, but I'm ok with that.  I'll go look for a taco shop where there's only one line.

The best meal I have had in a very long time. I'm so excited to review this place i don't even know where to start...!

Met a friend here last night and decided to grab a drink at the bar before sitting down. The bartender was a tall bald guy (cant remember his name) but he was so awesome! he made me a ginger mojito but used vodka instead of rum, it was delish!
We sat in the gorgeous intimate dinning room. With the high ceilings and kitchen behind a glass wall it was a very enjoyable setting. 
Our waiter (Arty i believe his name was) was amazing. very informative and accommodating with my peanut allergy request. He suggested I start off with a Lychee Lemon Drop. this was mixology at its finest. Sweet but refreshing and with rock candy sugar i cant wait to try to replicate it.
We started off with the lobster pancakes as an appetizer. More of a crepe then a traditional pancake filled with plumb lobster meat, mushrooms, red chili, scallions and dressed a lobster and coconut milk sauce they were melt in your mouth goodness.
Moving on to the main course. We decided to split two entrees. 
Grilled Garlic Shrimp- Huge prawns over a bed of black fettuccine in a red coconut curry sauce they were mouth watering delish. The sauce truly made the dish. With the spice of the curry and a sweetness from the coconut milk it was the perfect combination.
Our waiter then suggested the Short Ribs- totally melt in your mouth meat accompanied with goat cheese mashed potatoes. We also ordered a side of Wasabi mashed potatoes... which i ate the entire portion. don't judge me.
I also had the Strawberry Burst cocktail. Made with cachaca (a Brazilian rum) it was packed full of strawberry flavor in every drink. 
We finished our meal with a bottle of pinot gregio. 

This was an amazing experience and i highly recommend it to everyone.

You know... when it comes to desserts a particular subgroup in the LV yelp scene has declared Snowflake as their common  place to end their nights after events. Truthfully, I liked Snowflake a lot for a ton of reasons, but I would rather "check-in" at Art of Flavors any day. I don't think I have ever had service, ice cream, and espresso that could ever compare to this place. Not to mention the prices are really low. 

If you are a tourist reading this review, I recommend stopping here during your next visit. Desyree's Art of Flavors truly is one of the best things we got here in Las Vegas. 

For many years I declined to eat gelatto. The only times I ever ate it was at Caesar's Palace, Venetian, and the buffet at Rio. At Caesar's, I got piss awful service, and the smallest gelatto they had costed me $14.00. At Venetian the dude working there who was covered in tattoos and piercings had no clue what gelatto was. But he told me that their gelatto is pre-made at a different location. And the gelatto at the Rio buffet gave me aids. Here at Art of Flavors, the ingredients are all organic and natural. They ain't gonna use any artificial ingredients ever. And the service is incredible. No matter how busy it is, every single person will get individual attention.

Don't neglect the espresso next time you come here. I noticed that not very many people wrote about it in their reviews. The espresso here is so strong that you need to drink it with a spoon because drinking it too fast could stop your heart. I've never had real European espresso in my life, and it impressed me. 

I had no doubt that this place was gonna be good since Amanda vouched for it, but I didn't know it was  gonna be the best restaurant for dessert in Las Vegas.  

My friend Mel asked "where are all the 2, and 3 star reviews"..... It's because the Korean and Chinese yelpers haven't found out about this place yet to rate it down. (Come on, take a joke guys! I'm just busting your balls)

I was extremely disappointed in my experience with The Root Salon. I want to mention that I did NOT end up getting hair cut here because of SEVERAL scheduling issues. So my review is based solely on that. 

I called to book an appointment with Roxanne after hearing pretty rave reviews. When I called, I was told that it was a long wait to just get my ends trimmed. Totally okay with that. For the time I needed, and day of the week, I was looking at almost a 2 month wait. Right when I was ready to give up, the receptionist told me that she just got an opening for what I thought was Monday June 24th. Monday June 24th rolls around and I make the 45 MINUTE DRIVE over to the salon. I was told that my appointment wasn't on Monday, but on Wednesday the 26th. Apparently, Roxanne doesn't work on Mondays. So I must have written it down in my planner wrong. I said to the receptionist, "So I'm 2 days early?!" And she told me "Yes." Feeling like a complete idiot, I told her that I would see her on Wednesday the 26. We said goodbye, and I left. 

Finally it's Wednesday and I'm getting my hair cut! Woo! I make the 45 MINUTE FREAKING DRIVE to the salon. I walk in, and this time a man is at the front desk. I tell him my name, and that I have a 6:15 appointment with Roxanne. HE SAYS NOTHING. I say something sarcastically about hoping that I have the right day this time. He asked for my last name, and I start to get worried. PLEASE DO NOT TELL ME I'M NOT ON THE SCHEDULE. I ask him if I have the right day, and he said "No."

YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. I explain what happened, and what was said between me and the receptionist and he just stared at me. I told him over and over that I was clearly told that my appointment was today. I was basically told that I was out of luck, and that my appointment is sometime in freaking July. That is NOT what I was told over the phone, and NOT what I was told in person 2 days before. I asked to be taken out of the books for WHAT EVER appointment they decided to place me in, and stormed out. 

Twice I drove almost an hour, for days that were confirmed, only to be told that I wasn't there on the right day. I do not get appointments wrong. No one apoligized. I don't think I've ever been so infuriated with a business. I never write bad reviews, but this just needed to be known. Mostly known to The Root Salon. It was bad business. You lost a potential customer and my referrals. I have nothing positive to say about any of it.

$20/hr foot massage.  Need I say more?

Anyone who knows me knows I love a good foot rub!  And finally, Las Vegas has seen the light and is offering $20/hr foot massages!  Yes, you heard that right - $20/hr foot massages!  (What's even sweeter, you can buy 5 gift cards and get 1 free here!! Score!)

Bali Foot Spa is yet another place that has popped up in Vegas and smack dab in the oh so popular area of Spring Mountain.  This place is lit up like a Christmas tree at night, so it's really hard to miss if you're driving down Spring Mountain and it's dark.

Walking in on a weekday evening, I asked immediately if they had two females available and they did! Yes!  (Usually I call other places first and they say they do, but it involves them calling around first to make sure.)  Not here, these ladies are ready and waiting to work which is always a plus!  And it looks like they had at least two people whose dedicated job was to answer the phones and work the cash register.  (This is important to me because I hate when they answer the phone when they are working on me.)

Walking into the massage area, their space is enormous!! It's almost like a showroom!  Areas are partitioned off with 2-3 chairs in each space and they had a good amount of clients in there when we walked in.  I think they would have no problem accommodating a large group last minute.

Overall, my girl was good.  I was pleased with what she did and she didn't smell like cigarette smoke (a common thing when you get a guy working on you).  The Husband said his girl was okay, although he fell asleep relatively early and was snoring away, so I'm not sure how he can really judge it.  I think it's a good sign when they put him to sleep so quickly.

Sidenote: It's hard for me to be loyal to one specific foot  massage place because ultimately, it's the person working on you, right?   Very rarely have I gotten the same person twice at any foot massage place and they were that stellar that I would only request for them.  (I'm always curious to see what other people can do.)  I will definitely be going back there again though because we bought the gift cards!

This was my first time here and it was fun to meet up with some fellow Yelpers for a top secret UYE. Actually it was a great opportunity to meet Larry W from CA/TX as he drove through on his way back home. COOL!

We arrived on a Saturday around Noonish and the place was super packed. They had a pretty good wait list and everyone outside looked very hungry.

Ordered the Border Bowl and a giant glass of freshly squeezed OJ. Other members went with the Whole Hog plate, Eggs Benedict, a Caesar Chicken Wrap and some type of Veggie Dish.

Everything was delicious and the portions were very large. The fresh squeezed OJ was definitely good and something I've not had in a long time. The Bloody Marys looked fantastic and were giant.

We all had a great time visiting and the service was excellent. The menu has something for everyone and this would be a place that I'd bring the family back for a special occasion.

The parking can be a little tricky and it is mostly behind the building. Just take you time and be careful driving in this part of town. The locals are pretty crazy and some of the streets nearby go around in circles. Dang shopping malls.

See ya there next time and remember you can eat breakfast at any time of the day. There is no real written rule. ORDER UP!

Yagyu, Yama Sushi, Yellowtail, Yonaka, Yoshinoya, Yummy, Yusho, Yu-Yu, Yuzu.  There are many Japanese restaurants in Vegas that begin with a Y.  Some are much more authentic than others, and some are definitely more delicious.  While Yuzu comes in last place alphabetically, they are near the top of the list when it comes to their food.  Yuzu would also probably get you more points in Scrabble than the other restaurants.  

The service is friendly and quite attentive.  This is not really an entree style restaurant, it's best to go with friends and order multiple dishes and share family style.  We tried many things, so I'll just go through each of them:

Sashimi Salad Yuzu Style - Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, carrot, celery, cucumber, radish sprouts and seasonal vegetables.  The description doesn't do it justice: It's like a Japanese mini- taquito or flauta, but instead of meat & cheese wrapped in a tortilla, it's julienned veggies arranged lengthwise and wrapped in sashimi, served on top of greens.  The presentation rocked my socks.

Cold Green Tea Buckwheat Noodles - The noodles had a good texture and firmness, but green tea noodles typically don't float my boat.  Because it's hard to float on noodles.  And I don't have a boat.

Yellowtail Jalapeno - Good, but many restaurants have this.

Halibut Carpaccio -  Instead of a typical soy or citrus sauce, the halibut was served in a basil sauce.  Good flavor and texture, the basil wasn't overpowering.  Just enough to tickle your fancy.

Yuba Sashimi - The menu notes that this is limited to five servings a day; all tofu is made in-house, and this is the tofu skin resulting from that.  I liked it more than I thought I would, but I'm a bigger fan of the zaru tofu.  Still, it's good to try what homemade tofu tastes like to see if it tickles your pickle.

Zaru Tofu - Zaru means basket, and tofu means tofu.  Yuzu's house made tofu is served in a basket with some grated veggies.  Put the toppings on the tofu, pour a bit of the zaru sauce on it, mix and eat.  The sauce was like a less salty, slightly sweet soy sauce.  I liked this dish a lot; if the Yuba Sashimi tickles your pickle, this will turn your pickle into a cucumber.

Chicken Karaage - Good rendition of karaage.  Not too oily, the chicken was flavorful and moist.

Salmon Collar - This was cooked very well.  The salmon was not dry at all.  Not a dish I typically order though.

Yuzu Sorbet - Yum, yum, yum.  This is a perfect treat for summer, plenty of refreshing yuzu flavor.

Black Sesame Pudding - Tasted just like black sesame, but didn't float my boat (pudding buoyancy, lack of boat)

Soy Milk Pudding - Tasted like soy milk.  Nothing wrong with it, pudding just doesn't teeter my totter.

Unlike other restaurants, Yuzu's menu is not large, it consists of a single sheet of paper, double sided.  The above represents a good chunk of the menu, and everything was executed well.  Although many dishes are served with a sauce, nothing is over powering.  Flavors can be delicate, but are balanced.  One visit has already made me a fan, and I can't wait to go back.

It's a strange phenomenon that happens so very rarely, where something is redone, a song or movie for example, and ends up better than the source material -- 

*More Real Than The Original*

...Buffy the Vampire Slayer television show vs. movie  

...Jimi Hendrix vs. Bob Dylan All Along The Watchtower (even Dylan admitted it was Jimi's song now)

There is a restaurant concept sweeping the valley right now, based on a certain small number (between 1 and 3) of people of a certain philosophy (free-wheeling, nature-loving, noodly-music-listening) and their crazy atmosphere establishments full of odd "paraphernalia".

Well, think about how one of those places got your hopes up and then  left them dashed, and head on over to Rocket Burgers & Subs for everything you thought you'd get with those other guys:

~A fresh, clean, uncluttered atmosphere that you can sit comfortably inside of while enjoying your meal.
~A HUGE selection of almost any kind of soft drink you'd desire to quench that thirsty, dry mouth of yours.
~Lots of variety of menu, all with inexpensive good quality items of decent portion
~A radio playing the xmsirius Grateful Dead Channel for your soothing/stimulating dining pleasure.
~and a couple of really nice, friendly, hippy-on-the-inside-not-just-for-show restauranteurs eager to discuss their business and products, who are not only present now, but seem that they'll be sticking around to ensure the quality and value of their new place doesn't wane.

The food is fresh, fast, and inexpensive.  If you want burgers, subs, dogs, pizza-bread, gyro, salad, handmade fries &  onion rings, PBJ with homemade jam  -- they've got it.  The chicken sandwich had a light crispy breading and a solid chunk of breast meat.  The burger was a smaller patty (available as a double) but not dry, and the condiments were fresh and generous.  
For both sandwiches, the standout part was the fresh bun from Simply Bread (local).  It was soft/firm enough to be just right, and had great flavor.
They have a cooler chock full of interesting and bizarre selections from Pop The Soda Shop (Jones Soda, imported ginger ales and root beers, glass bottle real sugar sodas from mexico, dublin dr pepper, etc). My spicy Bleinheim Ginger Ale did not skimp on the ginger flavor!

A couple of real ex hippies would do it like this -- 
no flashy superficial emphasis on outward appearances and gimmicks, just quality, freshness, and friendliness that is truly genuine and sincere.
I feel like I made a new friend.
Rocket Burgers & Subs is one out of this world place, and I'm glad it landed in my neighborhood.

Maybe it's been a while since I last stepped foot into a Carrabba's or something but this place makes me, a 5'0" gal, feel like a giant.  

After being given our beeper/pager/thingie for our table [10-15min wait at 7PM on a busy Saturday night], I managed to get the top of my riding boot caught in the stupid bench twice and bump my head on the trim of the window.  Is this how you normal height people feel?  Anyways, more boot-catching-on-seats-action followed as we were seated in the tiniest booth ever.  I was sitting on one side with my gal friend, who's about the same height and weight as me, while my brother had the other side for himself.  During the whole meal, we were bumping into each other and it's hard to imagine how two people can sit on one side of a booth comfortably.  It's a surprise how I even ate when I was curled up against her the whole time!

Anyways, while I seldom review bigger chain restaurants, I really just wanted to say that Carrabba's has delicious food but I think their portions shrank... A LOT.  I had my fill of warm toasty bread with herbs and olive oil, a nice steamy bowl of sausage and lentils soup, and then had the tiniest plate of shrimp and scallops linguine alla vodka.  I'm not a big eater by any means but I somehow found myself in front of an empty plate with a hungry tummy.    It tasted amazing, so much more than my brother's lobster mac and cheese and my friend's champagne shrimp and scallop linguine, but it was ridiculously small.

I know I look pretty young but seriously, it was like a kid's sized meal and considering that I was carded when I ordered my Limoncello and Prosecco drink, which tasted more like cranberry juice than anything, I'm definitely an adult.  $23/pp including tip for three entrees, one alcoholic beverage, and a lemonade.  Not sure I'd be back even though they have decent flavor.  Pity... I do love their sausage and lentil soup!

I so badly wish that this place would open up in Portland. It just doesn't make sense that we don't have a Vila Argave. When you're seated here, you're asked if this is your first time in the restaurant. There's a good reason for that, so be patient, because when you say that it's your first time, they will give you a very thorough explanation of the menu, but only after bringing you the complimentary breads and spreads that start you off to a wonderful experience. 

It might feel for just a moment that the explanations of the menu items are wordy or lengthy- they're not. It's just that there's a LOT to choose from, and some of them are things that might be a bit "exotic" for the good ol' 'merkin. There are snails, among other things. They look absolutely delicious though, and next time, we will try them. This time, we tried the calamari. 

One of the brilliant features of Vila is that barely ANYTHING is fried. The calamari comes in a light, delicious cream sauce over herbed rice. It is mouth-watering, and we damn-near impaled eachother with forks over the last piece. I don't know if we'll ever have the CHANCE to try the snails, because the calamari is so craveable. 

Claire ordered the marinated grilled Portuguese chicken, and I tried it. It was marvelous. Something to know about this selection- if you order it, be comfortable with a 20 minute or more wait. This is NOT KFC. The chicken is cooked fresh when you order it. As a result, it is spectacular. Get over yourself. 

I ordered the seafood pasta, and I'm not sure, at this point, that I'd be able to bring myself to order anything else. Rather than a heavy alfredo, as most restaurants tend to serve over their seafood pastas, this selection is adorned with a creamy, tomato sauce akin to vodka sauce (my mouth was too full to ask exactly what it was, and to be perfectly honest, I don't care). This is by far the best pasta dish I have had from any restaurant. Especially with seafood. The scallops in my dish tasted extremely fresh. Everything did, really. 

What would I change about this place? Absolutely nothing. Except that it's in Las Vegas and not Portland. The owner is a magnificent human being who engages her clientele for feedback so she knows what to nip and tuck about her establishment. The night that we came in was a karaoke night, and I will not hesitate to mention that this place is not only gay friendly, but it absolutely EMBRACES the gay community. All around perfect dining experience. Would recommend, insist, and return.

After picking up tickets at will-call for Absinthe, we figured "hmmmm, now where to eat?"
We were stranded on the expansive grounds at Caesar's Palace and figured the wisest choice was to check out the restaurants inside the hotel. 

That being said, we headed straight for the forum shops!
A quick stroll lead us to Wolfgang Puck's world famous Spago!

Having dined previously at the iconic Beverly Hills location, I came with an expectation of good quality food and great service. 

We were running late so we wanted a quick but tasty meal. With the attractive al fresco dining option albeit indoors with artificial skyline and people watching galore, we opted for cafe seating. Within moments, we were seated and began perusing the menu. 

For appetizers, we enjoyed the oysters on a half shell. Let me tell ya, these lil' guys were fresh, plump and with the addictively tangy cocktail sauce, it was a virtual party in my mouth! Foodgasm guaranteed!

Now onto the entrees:

Spaghettini with a side of roasted chicken - I've been on a scratch made pasta kick lately, so when I had heard they rolled out fresh pasta daily, I was instantly sold!  There's a difference in the texture, flavor and overall mouthfeel of the pasta! If you haven't had it fresh I strongly advise you try a plate of the spaghettini here. It's phenomenal! Each strand was coursing with a vibrant red sauce which lent its wonderful aroma from the fresh basil. The richness of the sauce and marked acidity came from the ropa vieja tomatoes, which rounded out the flavor profiles of this winning dish perfectly.
And the chicken? Tender and juicy with an irresistibly crispy skin that I devoured in a flash!

Lamb Chorizo Pizza with rapini, sundries tomatoes, goat cheese and cilantro -  Now this was my kinda pizza pie! It was nice and thin but definitely not lacking in the flavor department by any means. The lamb chorizo was savory and well seasoned and the crunchy rapini added a pleasant  contrast in texture. The chopped cilantro and fresh tomato brightened up the dish and definitely took this droolworthy pizza to another level of deliciousness! 

Service was prompt and friendly. Our waters were always filled and staff constantly stopped by to see how we were doing, which was nice for a bustling cafe. We enjoyed an elegant meal that was quick, unfussy and delicious!

Overall, I was quite pleased with my experience here and it goes without saying I'd  definitely come back.  Hopefully with time to spare on my next visit, ill give the main dining room a whirl.

Until then,

Happy Eats!

Defalco's rates five stars for me because every dish on the menu that I have tried tastes fabulous. I found Defalco's the first week during my initial scouting trip to Arizona a few years ago.

After my first taste of their Chicken Parmigiana sandwich I was hooked. I love the meatball sandwich as well. But my favorite is definitely the Italian Sausage served with roasted green peppers and onions with the marinara sauce on the roll of your choice. Talk about foodie nirvana; The Italian Sausage sandwich does it for me.

I keep coming here because the food is excellent and the pricing is reasonable. One time my family members ordered half sandwiches of the same item and they gave us the full sandwich pricing which was a discount from half sandwich pricing. They didn't have to do that. But that's just one of the ways that they look out for their customers. This place gets really busy and it can be a challenge to find seating during the busy lunch and dinner hours.  They also have a thriving deli.

One of these days I've got to try the pizza.

What to write for my 1600th review?

Sometimes, sage sayings can be contradictory. For example, the definition of intelligence is sometimes given as the ability to learn from one's past mistakes but it is also said that the definition of stupidity is repeating the same action again and again and expecting a different outcome!

With certain honourable exceptions such as Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley, I tend to be wary of restaurants in hotels, regarding them as traps for hotel guests too lazy to leave the hotel in search of a top notch meal

However, when I booked to watch Ka at the MGM Grand, I was intrigued by the omakase tasting menu at Shibuya, the Japanese restaurant located in their restaurant row. With a line-up of ingredients including toro, wagyu, foie gras and lobster, it looked very promising though I knew that it would take a first rate Japanese meal to satisfy me as I was also dining at another local Japanese legend in Vegas and favourite amongst Yelpers on the same trip - Raku (http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/raku-las-vegas#hrid:kQccGZ8GEw6cqZNBUqkwpQ)

I made my reservation via the hotel website and the only wrinkle in the evening was that my table wasn't ready at the time I booked

The restaurant is gargantuan, a definite contrast to the intimate Raku but I did appreciate the stylish surroundungs. There was a Vegas buzz of excitement to the place and despite the size of the operation, my food arrived quickly but the meal was well paced

1. Amuse of Kushi Oyster with Apple Momiji and Orange Ponzu
I usually like my oysters freshly shucked, briney and metallic from the sea but here, the citrus notes did enhance the meaty oyster

2. Trio of hamachi
This delicate fish was served in different preparations. Firstly as a sashimi with a hint of garlic, ginger and pepper. Then a tartar where the minced fish was mixed in with tobiko and garlic-infused ponzu. Lastly again as sashimi with wasabi, wasabi oil and Hawaiian red salt. A lovely contrast of 3 preparations

3. Sashimi duo
My first slice of sashimi was one of my favourite fish - chu toro (fatty part of the tuna belly), served with ginger soy sauce and spiced crunchy garlic. The other piece was kanpachi, yuzu juice and black truffle oil. Yummy sashimi

4. Tataki of Australian wagyu beef, lemon tamari soy, tarragon oil and garlic chips
The beef was almost sweet with freshness and the lemon lifted it with the nice contrast of crunchy garlic chips

5. Ezi Ebi
If I tell you that this dish was Australian lobster tail and day boat scallops in uni sake butter sauce and that it tasted every bit as magnificent as it sounds, I think I can rest my case

6. Niku
Braised Kobe-style short rib was served with sauted foie gras and rounded off with sweet and spicy soy. The meat was meltingly tender and the sauce wasn't over-sweet. The umami hit from the foie gras was heavenly as usual

7. Maine Lobster Miso Soup, Green Onions, Shitake Mushrooms
No ordinary soup as you can tell from the ingredients!

8. Nigiri with freshly grated wasabi root

9. Dessert Tasting
Raspberry-Yuzu calpico pannacotta, choco-lychee mousse cake, and mochi ice cream proved a tasty, sweet and surprisingly light end to a magnificent meal

As you can tell just from reading the review (until Yelp invents smell-o-vision or taste-o-vision, I'm afraid my photos will have to do with helping me enhance my words), this was a legendary meal. Top class ingredients were treated sympahetically and allowed to sing with complementary sidekicks that enhanced and not take over. Recognisably Japanese but with a nod to western ingredients

As for restaurants in hotels, I'm very happy to eat my words provided the words are as delicious as the food at Shibuya!

Forgive the lateness of this review. Usually when a new ramen-ya opens up in LV, I line up outside the door on opening day. Problem is that I've recently entered a PsyD program that has completely consumed my life. I'm lucky to sleep 2-4 hours a night before having to go to work and then school. 

I actually didn't have time to come here today, but one of the students in my learning group really wanted to try this place out and he even offered to pay for it. I couldn't say no to a free lunch. 

So, we have a lot of odd ball ramen-yas here in Las Vegas. Typically, in other cities in America, the most common variations of ramen are: Sapporo, Tokyo, and Hakata. But, here in LV we have a rare Kurume ramen-ya and an Osaka ramen-ya which dominate our ramen scene. I've lived in the Japanese districts of Los Angeles county and have never seen a Kurume or Osaka variation. But, even though Las Vegas has so many rare variations of ramen, we have never had a Tokyo ramen-ya.  And back in Los Angeles we had 100s of Hakata ramen-yas but only one lonely Tokyo ramen-ya. And that LA Tokyo ramen-ya just happened to be......KORAKU. So, you can see why I don't know what a good Tokyo ramen is supposed to taste like. But, after reading Hooto's review, I knew it had to be good. If a man who is from Tokyo is vouching that a restaurant has a good Shoyu ramen, then it erases all my doubts. 

The prices here are very low compared to the KORAKUs in California. My bowl of Shoyu ramen was only $6.95, compared to the $11 I paid 5 years ago when I last went to a KORAKU in California. 

The first thing Japanese people do when they enter a new ramen-ya is ask "what regional variation of ramen is served here?". When I asked this at the California location, the server said " I is... don't know". When I asked here, the server immediately answered "Tokyo". I was really happy that the servers had a lot of ramen knowledge. BTW, I miss the days when Japanese restaurant owners used to force their non-asian workers to learn to speak Japanese.

KORAKU gives a free slice of Naruto-maki with each bowl of ramen! Sora, Fukumimi, and Monta don't do that. 

My Shoyu broth was perfect. My Dad grew up in Hawaii, and he used to tell me that Shoyu broth is best when fish bones are used instead of traditional chicken. KORAKU's  broth did have a hint of fish, but it wasn't very noticeable. Anyway, I thought it was very good and much better than Monta's Shoyu. 

I loved the thin yet slightly curly noodles. Shoyu is always supposed to have thinner curly noodles, but no other place here in LV does that. Sora has curly Sapporo noodles but they are way too thick for Shoyu.  

I liked the ramen so much that I called my Dad in California and told him that I found the best Tokyo Shoyu Ramen-ya in America. My Dad is one of those guys who insists that ramen on the mainland can't compare to ramen in Hawaii so he told me to shut up.

A friend told me that KORAKU had Tan Tan Men. When I showed up, it turned out it was Tanmen. I can't count how many times in the last 10 years this has happened to me. 

It sucks how this place had to open up during the same week as Monta part 2(which many of us Sansei/Yonsei have nicknamed "Monta Strikes Back"). I noticed that Monta 2 is always extremely busy while KORAKU usually only has 2-3 people in it. For some odd reason which I will never understand, people here in LV have this idea that Monta is "the best" and that all ramen should be compared to their Tonkotsu. This is far from the truth. I've only met a handful of Japanese people who think Monta is "good ramen". Most Japanese people I know think Monta is one of your typical Las Vegas "tourist traps" and cannot compare to Katsu & Daisuke's Fukumimi or Yoshi's Ramen Sora. 

I encourage all Japanese-American residents of Las Vegas to support KORAKU. I know that these days there are only like 5 of us left in this whole city...but just do it anyway...

Some of my friends laughed and others scoffed at the fact that I had booked accommodations at the Hooters Casino Hotel for my Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon weekend in Las Vegas.

It wasn't as bad as everybody told me it would be, and considering I booked many months in advance and found Expedia rates ranging from $45 to $55 a night for a room in the Tower building I wouldn't hesitate to go back.  For the race the "off the Strip" location was perfect as it was a comfortable fifteen minute walk to the start / finish area on race day.

My room was okay since I only spent time there to sleep and to yelp.  With the exception of parts of the carpet the room was fairly clean too.  I wore white socks in the room and each night my white socks turned either light gray or charcoal colored depending on how much walking I did in the room.

Here were some of the cool things about my room:

*The queen size bed was firm and comfortable (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=iHWbOO5Jzfh31dVthmiB6Q).
*Standard sized television (no flat screen) had crisp cable broadcasting.
*Comfortable desk had a brand new issue of the latest Hooters magazine (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=96qyqd-PoYisLKTjPUswuA).
*There is a digital room safe just in case you decide to go out for a 13 or 26 mile run (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=BZMBwl3J5Y6vylsT0c-hBA).
*Clean bathroom (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=dPRiakqkf2jm4_1Tyw-Iww).
*Basic amenities (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=yqsvK9WYxf_OtSIjZUBXIA).
*Free bottled water (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=S4pY5Ebf2pSWPyP59WTvmQ).  Runners love water!!
*Two fake palms in the room look great without the flying insects (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=YBp_3-oEiKi-ayVqcVDe_w).
*Amusing privacy door signs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pQ-H32BJ81tpaF1dNHA1Pg?select=toTBsd8WeZhsSMAEALOiOQ).

Of course there's always bad things that makes it a 3 star review:

*The comforter was lumpy.
*No free internet.  No problem as I brought a wireless card this time.
*The deadbolt kept slamming into the door jamb.  I had to whip out my Leatherman and do a repair job for them.  The deadbolt works perfectly now.  You're welcome!!
*Noisy pipes and the water pressure in the water closet was horrible.
*Toilet tissue holder was too short and the spool would come loose and fall on the floor every time the tissue was in use.
*Thin walls.  I heard every foul-mouthed conversation my neighbors had, but I heard every intimate one too!
*Horrible, lazy housekeeping staff!  I did a better job cleaning up after myself!
*Incompetent and slow check-in process.  The lady kept mispronouncing my last name.  How do you fuck up my last name?  It's three letters and the second and third letters are the same vowel.  Dummy!

I didn't take advantage of the slot playing amenity that came with the room.  The casino downstairs is very small.  Like I said, if I could find these rates again I would return.  If not, don't bother!

My wife and I celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary here.  What a dining experience it was!  

The complimentary gold MGM limo picking us up right in front of our place was sweet.  You must do this!  We were met by a beautiful hostess straight out of a James Bond film as we rolled up to the Mansion.  An amazing place to check out.  I guess this is what playing $25k a hand in blackjack gets you.  

We had all intentions of getting the 16 course dinner but realized there was no chance whatsoever of my very petite sized wife having even a hail mary's shot at finishing.  She might've reached course 10 at best.  

No problem!  Let's just fill up on champagne and do four courses.

There are so many extremely detailed reviews for this restaurant.  Read all of them!  I'm only going to do notes and observations:

- Is it possible to be too fancy?  This comes close. I love fine dining as much as the next fat Asian with glasses but the word "stuffy" came to mind.  Maybe my suit was too tight.  

- The man, the myth, the legend was there.  Right before our appetizers (ah-hem! Une Entree) came out I heard a "Bon Soir!" from behind me and there he was in the flesh!  Joel Robuchon!!  He shook our hands.  Joel stops by the restaurant 4 times a year according to the staff and he said we were lucky to see him.  I should've asked Mr. Robuchon to sign one of the rolls from the ridiculously amazing bread cart.

- The lobster salad with fruit was orgasmic.  

- Whoever invented foie gras should go down in history as one of the greatest people ever.

- Veal cheek kind of tasted like if a chicken thigh had sex with filet mignon.  I savored every little bite.  I believe the neighboring table shot me a look after I said this out loud to my wife.  Whatever.  More champagne please!!

- They served us an extra dessert to celebrate the occasion.  It was the white and yellow meringue fruit pie cake I took a picture of.  I forgot what they said it was called. Blame it on the ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah-alcohol.  Tremendous stuff!  We ordered 2 more dessert dishes and THEN the dessert cart came out.  Wow!!

3 hours later we were stuffed and ready for the limo to take us back.  A fantastic gourmet experience I would recommend to anyone.

Okay... I love LoLo's. I think it IS better than Roscoe's. I live for their Red Velvet Cake. I DO love most of their food and usually the service is great... so why the two stars? Because I'm not a fan of THIS location. and here's why...

- The crazy hours. I never know WHEN this place is open, sometimes the sun isn't even set and it's closed and other times I go by and late at night and they're open. It's very inconsistant and frustrating. 
- The loud azz sound system blaring in the background makes it hard for me to hear the person I'm dining with. So usually we just eat in silence while the music plays on.
- The food simply isn't as good as the original location. Everything is a subpar immitation. The chicken is usually overcooked and the waffles lack that certain crunch or crispiness. 
- and my own personal reason - I had hit up Lolos on twitter and said they should have a separate to-go menu and I even said on twitter that we were dining at the counter and it was way facinating to watch the food come from the window. Which it was. I liked it, they were cranking it out and were having a good time when in comes this manager who started barking out orders and basically bullying the staff. I thought it was unfair. and then I got the bill... and was misbilled. I told the waitress who didn't do anything about it and ran my card. I asked her to fix it before running my card - she didn't. I didn't sign my ticket and asked the bully of a manager (who was bald with a tan shirt on June 10th) and then shrugged off my complaint and didn't change it. He didn't even look at it. I was astounded. I didn't know what to do - so I entered my tip and signed my ticket and vowed to never return to the Scottsdale location. oh and before we left, the Bully of a Manager asked me if I wanted a to-go menu, I said yes, thinking it was so serendipidous but when he handed me a regular menu with this shitty look and scarcastic tone he said that THIS WAS their to-go menu... and that's when I knew... he had read my tweets. 

I didn't mean any disrespect, honestly. It WOULD be awesome if they had a to-go or catering menu. There will be feedback from customers. And I don't care HOW good your food is, nothing warrents such rudeness to a PAYING customer. I think success had gone to the manager's head and they forgot how to keep it real - one of the drawbacks of being "Hood-rich" as the waitstaff's t-shirts declare. 

To my yelpers I say: Be careful of what you tweet. The manager at the Lolo's Scottsdale location is sensitive so perhaps you should just save your opinion for yelp. And as for the food... imagine you found Lolo's recipe book... and you tried to make yourself a little feast, you did everything EXACTLY as it says, but it misses something... some pizazz, some flavor, some... soul? You will have the Scottsdale location's food down! Stay away from the Scottsdale location. i will keep to the Downtown location where they keep it real

I have been to this salon twice. The first time was only ok. I had an appointment and told the girl exactly what I wanted. When I got there I sat down right away. The girl was very brash and not very friendly at all. When I told her what I wanted (a full set, very short and natural and not thick. I asked if gel's were possible) she said she couldn't do the gels (even though I've had them before) and that she could do pink and white's. The reception and the nail tech went back and forth about whether or not there was enough time. I was annoyed because I had booked time for a full set so I knew I had t least an hour. Once it was all settled she got to work. I had asked for them short and she just didn't listen to me. They were way longer than I wanted. 

I went back in 2 weeks later for a fill. On a pink and white you sometimes needs the pink and the white done and sometimes just the pink. I had let them know when I booked the fill that I would want the nails short and that the white would probably need to be done. The receptionist told me no, the pink would be enough. So of course, when I went in...I didn't have enough time scheduled. I told them I would go elsewhere and they "moved some things around"

The girl who did my nails was referred to as "tiny" but I believe her name was tina.When we were discussing that I wanted my nails short she kept trying to change my mind ( so she wouldn't have to fill the pink and the white I assume) and i was very annoyed.  Once she started  it quickly became the most painful and uncomfortable fill I've ever had. She drilled so much that my fingers are sore and red now. And she kept pulling and bending my fingers even though I asked her to go easy. (my hands were sore that day).  Due to all the drill work my nails have lines and spots that are visible through the top coat,

When I checked out the receptionist asked how everything was and i said "not great". She waited a beat and looked and me and then said "what?" pretending not to hear me. I told her nothing. it was just ok. She didn't even ask why? She asked if I wanted to make another appointment and I said I would not be back. She said great have a nice day. 

Also while I was there, employees were speaking about other customers in a very unprofessional way and swearing. It was so uncomfortable. 

The fill was 38 dollars. I didn't even get an I'm sorry.

I do not recommend this salon. Nor will I return there.....

Secret 1 - Yes, I was trying to look you in the eyes, but I'm a man and my eyes tend to stray.
Secret 2 - I'm a bit shy.  So buy me alcohol and I'll open up a bit.
Secret 3 - If you are female and I left you a compliment, it's likely I think you are cute.  Not so for men.

No more secrets!!  I've given too much away--unless you go the Secret 2 route.

Service - 5 Stars
Cleanliness - Excellent
Price - Approximately $26.00 (The soon to be brother-in-law paid).
Seafood - ??
Meats - Yes
Vegetables - Yes
Dessert - Yes, Cannoli & New York Cheesecake.
Fruits - N/A
Other - (1) Located on Level 3 of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, (2) You will find it between Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill and Jaleo. (3) Cash and Credit Cards are accepted here.  (4) Papst Blue Ribbon Beer is on tap here.  (5) Avoid the times 1 am to 5 am because that is the busiest times--that is when all The Situations and J Wowws come out from Marquee.  

What was Ordered:

Pizza with 4 toppings ($26.00) - A-Okay (3 Stars) - My sister and fianc chose a 3 topping pizza.  One side was pepperoni and green peppers pizza.  The other side was sausage and roasted garlic.  All pizza here is thin crust and the large pizza has 8 large slices.  Here is the breakdown by slice:

*The Crust - Meh! I've had better (2 Stars) - You are looking at approximately a 14" diameter of thin crust with tomato sauce and melted cheese.  One word comes to mind, "greasy."  

*Sausage and Roasted Garlic - Meh! I've had better (2 Stars) - The sausage was good, but I think the Roasted Garlic was forgotten--maybe that's why they charged us the 3 topping price.  Plus, I do not think they gave us enough of the sausage per slice to make it more fulfilling.

*Pepperoni and Green Peppers - A-Okay (3 Stars) - Probably the best combination of toppings that made the pizza tasty.  The pepperoni tasted like it was suppose to.  What brought this slice up a notch was the flavor of the roasted green peppers.  

The Secret Pizza is really in a nondescript location--with no signage at all.  If you are near a random billiards table, you are in the right place.  The place is A-Ok, but I've experienced better.  Maybe if I was crazy drunk and just got out of the club, this place would have been rated higher.  Unfortunately, I'm sober.

"I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know
I've got to know
What is this place that I have found? 
What's this?" - J. Skellington


The lunch bunch had wanted to enjoy Crepe Bar for many months, but had been previously scared away by reports of insane wait times and limited seating (sohwee Janee P).  Realizing that they took reservations, I set aside a table for 6 (really 8) about two weeks prior.  And boy, am I glad I did.

Walking in with Ann R, I didn't see an available table in the place... which is when I noticed J-WoW and Linh were occupying the table of highest honors... the reserved hi-top.

Realizing that our party of 4 was not getting any larger, we shifted to one side of the table to free up four contiguous chairs, because we're thoughtful and stuff.

Our Sep outing found us at Salut Kitchen Bar with the greatest waitress of all time: Keary.  I found her male counterpart: Cody.  This dude embodied the essence of Crepe Bar, fun, witty, timely, and able to turn down a bribe.  I'll be back with more cash...

Being our first time, the table took a while to lock in on palatable entrees, and Cody didn't rush, even though the place was packed.  Even better, since we were at a reserved table, we didn't have to order at the counter.

Dining in a group really is the only way to go.  I paid for one savory crepe, yet was a partaker in four amazing crepe combinations.  I couldn't pick a favorite, they were all so good!

And Cody had the sensibility to hold off on the sweet crepes until our party had completed round 1.  But what's this?  We were being treated to a sampling of paper thin cut radishes on cultured butter.  Hey, it could have been served with ignorant margarine, and I wouldn't have known the difference, but it was nice to feel so froufrou... because, you know.. I'm in the fast lane from LA to Tokyo.  Okay

Upon arrival, I knew J's dessert was going to take the cake.  That crepe was bananas, B.A.N.A.N.A.S.  That crepe was also nutella, N.U.T.E.L.L.A!

One more round of free resplendent Rollos and we were ready for our PhotoOp... which Cody and team made happen.  Overall, it was a FABULOUS lunch.  I'll award the Crepe Bar an: A + + + + + + + + + + !

And I didn't even have to use my AK, today was a good day

Follow the yellow brick road to the emerald city and you'll find the golden lion! It's the first thing you see as you enter the main lobby.

This hotel is pretty grand, alright, at least in size. Being the largest hotel and casino in Las Vegas, maybe they feel they don't need to be the best in customer service. Granted, there were over 15,000 people from my company for a huge convention, but they should be equipped to handle as many guests as can fit in the hotel, right? They're just lucky the other 15,000 people went elsewhere.

Need to Spend $?
---------------------
Plenty of restaurants, touristy shops, and of course... massive casino space. Many vehicles for spending dolla bills! The food court gets wicked crowded so I tended to opt for **Blizz**, which is just around the corner and has some healthy juice options (see Blizz review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/blizz-las-vegas?hrid=9pL5NN9VJ-YEqvD0mBJjBA). Also MGM is home to **Cirque Du Soleil's 'Ka'**. Not my favorite Cirque show, but still an interesting one. My favorite Cirque show is the Beatles' 'LOVE', which you can only catch in Las Vegas. (see LOVE review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?hrid=FBWaEYnI5TPtpuBeePDZdA).

Need to Catch Some Sun?
-------------------------------
They have not one, not two, but FOUR pools! If those weren't enough fun for you, they have 3 whirlpools and waterfalls too. It's a 6.5 acre complex of pool action and also includes a quarter mile lazy river. As if you hadn't already consumed enough food and alcohol, they have 5 bars and a full service Cabana grill. You can even get a poolside massage. What?!

Need to Feel Large and In Charge?
----------------------------------------
The **MGM Grand Garden Arena** is there for you! When you're here, you can't help but feel the power and energy of thousands of people in one space. Amazing sound systems and visual effects really enhance the experience. If your company is cool enough to play EDM (electronic dance music) for 5 hours, I can guarantee you'll have a great time here. Arena staff are friendly and helpful, which is a huge contrast compared to much of the hotel.

Need to Dance?

Other than partying with my company's EDM fix, you can also hit up **Hakkasan**, one of the hottest nightclubs in Vegas. No wonder this place won the title of "#1 Nightclub in the World" by Playboy Magazine. All the top DJ's spin here, including resident DJ's Tiesto and Calvin Harris. Then of course there's also **Wet Republic** at the ultra pool, complete with the resident DJ's, a newly expanded 95-foot bar (neverending alcohol), a huge LED display, party cabanas/bungalows, and of course tons of people ready to party in their bathing suits. A super fun day party! (see Wet Republic review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/wet-republic-ultra-pool-las-vegas?hrid=KRe8TmiGoVdgNzKIFNxjgw)

All in all, the MGM Grand has a LOT to offer. Just wish their customer service could keep up.

TIP: Be prepared when asking for extra towels. Staff may sound as shocked as if you had asked for their firstborn child.

DATE TIP: Plenty of venues here for a hot date!

I'm a huge fan of Raku so it was only a matter of time before I would stop by Sweets Raku to check out their confectionery creations.  This was by far one of the most impressive culinary experiences I've ever had in Vegas.

Although you can order ala carte here, their 3-course pre-fixe menu is the way to go.  Here's how mine went:

Edible Menu -- http://bit.ly/1mhBL8B
First off, this came as a surprise to me.  What an interesting concept for a quick appetizer.  They provide you with a raspberry dipping sauce.  Just remember to make sure you order first before eating your menu.

Daily Iced Tea with Muscat Ice Cube --  http://bit.ly/1p0YITQ
Another twist!  The Iced Tea was good but the Muscat Ice Cube made it enjoyable.  I actually couldn't wait for that whole cube to melt down.

Pineapple Sorbet with White Wine Jelly -- http://bit.ly/1tNghV9
Amuse Bouche course.  This was a good start to the sweets meal.  Not overly sweet and had a refreshing taste to it.

Stella - Strawberry Tiramisu --  http://bit.ly/1p0ZDDH
Main Course.  I'm glad that they provided pictures on their menu because this looked amazing on the pic, but it was an even bigger treat watching them create it from scratch.  I've never had a Tiramisu with strawberries before so this was a pleasant surprise.  The presentation was very creative and of course it was delish!

Creme Puff with Vanilla Cream and Black Currant Syrup -- http://bit.ly/1mhGvek
Petit Four course.  I'm always a sucker for a good cream puff.  So I was glad to see they made this the final course.  You do have a choice of cream and syrup and I thought my choice of Vanilla and Black Currant went very well together.  Again, spot on with the presentation!

If you enjoy Raku like me, I'm pretty sure you'll be thoroughly impressed with Sweets Raku.  Like its older sibling, the service, presentation, and quality desserts are impeccable and as stated earlier, it's always a treat just to see the desserts being created right before your eyes.  Definitely worth another visit!  5 Stella Stars!

NEW PHO SHOP! (1/18/2012)

After first seeing the signs for Pho House getting put up a few weeks ago, I knew I had to try this place immediately. This part of Phoenix needed a little Vietnamese dive. Every time I'm sitting at home and have a pho craving, I always have to think in "miles away." It's not always convenient to have to drive ten plus miles for a decent bowl of pho (and by not always, I mean never).  

Well, I had dinner there tonight and I can already strongly recommend a bowl of their pho dac biet! Consistency will be key, but the broth was definitely one of the better  pho broths that I've had in the city. Along with the pho, I tried a spring roll and an egg roll. The spring roll was tasty and fresh, and the egg roll was crunchy and delicious! I'd order both again. If you've had good spring/egg rolls at other Viet spots, you'll know what you'll be getting. Oh, and one more thing... no chili oil as of yet. I'm sure that could change in the future, but I was a tiny bit bummed.

I think Pho House is totally starting on the right path with its food and friendly service, and if they keep it up, I could see it being a busy little neighborhood restaurant. It's really in a perfect spot that lacks close competition. C'mon, Arcadians and East Phoenicians, go try it and write a review!

Two of us discovered this Ethiopian restaurant on Yelp and decided to come here for lunch. We were the first to arrive and the black-white colored interior consisted of a small bar, and plenty of tables that spread across several platforms that overlooked a screen looping various images of Ethiopia. 

We had the Meat and Vegetarian Combo ($13.99) that came with seven vegetarian items and our choice of lamb. There were two types of lentils and split peas, string beans, collard greens, spiced cabbage, and mushrooms. The ingredients were fresh and arrived with good consistency. However, the flavors were rather subdued as many items could use more spice and pop in the flavor.  One of their lentils was served at room temperature, and although such practice is common, I still prefer the warm version.

The Alitcha Wot was a bit dry and very greasy. The lamb was unexpectedly swimming in a pool of oil and not aesthetically pleasing. This is not a dish I would order again.

Their injera was fluffy and soft. As other reviewers had mentioned, it is on the sour side, but I really enjoyed it. However, there was a general lack of depth and intensity in the flavor when compared to others that might be more authentic.

Portions were huge and menu prices were excellent. Service was warm, friendly, and attentive. However, the worst part of this experience was when they overcharged the meal by having us to pay these two dishes separately--instead of the combo price that was listed on the menu. 

Several reviewers have mentioned about Blue Nile, so that's the next place I'm going to visit. Otherwise, I recommend people to try Lalibela for those that are searching for the cuisine in the area. My favorite of all times is still by far Awash, hands down.

In an unlucky turn of events, I ended up having a grand experience with my new favorite, Grimaldi's. 

More of my reviews lately have began with me aimed for one place and ending up at another, and I'll start with "this one isn't any different." Maybe it's a trend, maybe it's indecisive decision making, or maybe it's just plain old coincidence. Mostly because I don't believe in fate; I'll go with coincidence, but for those of you who mystify the universe in a shroud of hocus pocus, wizardry, and magic then feel free to call it fate.

While I make the claim of "My New Favorite" I'm not really comparing it to much outside of oreganos, humble pie, upper crust, and streets of new york. I've yet to visit bianco, cibo, and plenty other wild-west, pizza slingers round these parts.

Earlier this week I planed my birthday lunch at Cibo in Downtown PHX. A calorie and carb packed, delicious birthday meal. Much to my dismay, a quick pre-lunch look at the Cibo menu (on their website), seemed to be lacking a certain sauce and cheese covered, carbo loaded delight. After a call in confirming this fear, a fast yelping finger pointed me to Grimaldi's in Scottsdale. It didn't hurt that they had also sent me a voucher for free birthday pizza; I guess my wife signed me up for their email list. :-)

On Sunday afternoon; even though they were busily serving plenty of customers, there was no wait. I placed an order with the server for a manhattan while I checked out their menu. Regretfully I had to send my drink back, it tasted more like straight whiskey, and bottom shelf at that. I decided to go with the house red wine in stead; which was decent and chilled, a bit odd for a red, but it worked out well.

We dined on a large meatball, ricotta pizza and a large mediterranean salad. The salad was huge, big enough for 3 people to share, and each end up with 2 portions. The pizza came out with a perfectly crisped crust, evenly distributed slices or meatball and ricotta, and was delicious!

We finished off our meal sharing a blueberry cheese cake AND a canolie, it was my birthday after all. I cant say that I've had many canolies in my life, but if they're all this good, there will be an eternal place in my heart set aside for these delectible deserts.

Happy dining friends, and godspeed to all your yelping fingers!

It feels as if we've eaten in Jade Palace a zillion times over the years and have always had a great time. 

The food is very good, boarding on excellent. While the wait staff can be both inattentive and on top of you during the same visit. LOL But we keep coming back because it feels like home. It also reminds us of all those other great white table cloth Chinese restaurants we've eaten in over the years. 

We arrived around 7 on a Friday night and Jade Palace was full swing, with a few tables just being bused. Lucky us! The wait was less than five minutes. We were able to be seated at a booth off to the side. It had both the advantages of being intimate, as well as tucked away and out of sight. We sat for long period before we were able to flag down the owners son. But we hardly noticed since we were having such a great conversation. 

We were also fortunate on this visit to order off menu that delicious dish of Cold Noodles with Sesame Sauce.  It was a reasonable $9.95, and a old favorite of mine. Sadly I couldn't make the same deal to get some Sichuan Won-Tons. Oh well, the Fried Pot Stickers for $5.95 were very good substitute!

Our appetizers were complemented by some Plum wine and LI Ice Tea.  My friend Marvin loves this place and so do we. http://www.yelp.com/biz/jade-palace-scottsdale-2?hrid=RRwVjbbyGOQSFkDY8VfAmA

For our entrees, we ordered the yummy General Tso's Chicken for $13.95 and the equally delicious Pork Lo Mein for $10.50. Both came with that individually prepared, layered taste that Jade is known for. We've eaten both here and the Jade up on Pinnacle Peak, but this is our favorite location. 

Our bill came to just over $30 per person, including drinks and we left feeling well satisfied with this exquisite Chinese meal. 

An energetic Four and half Stars, and yes we are most definitely Fans. 

Enjoy!!

I had passed this restaurant located just outside Mandalay Bay's casino room beside the escalators that takes patrons over to the Luxor Hotel & Casino earlier in the day, and after reading some reviews about it I decided to go back.

The dining room has a nice airy feeling to it with lots of shiny chrome and little mirrors to accent the interior.  Tables and chairs are all stained wood and the smooth melamine white vinyl couches are firm and cushiony.  The hostess sat me down with a double-sided menu, a catalog of available wines and an order form for raw oysters.  My waiter, Julius, came around right away to greet me and take my drink order and offer me water.  When it was determined I didn't want wine or oysters those menus quickly disappeared from the table.

Most of the main dishes that the restaurant serves are seafood-based, but I did notice a beef burger on the lunch menu.  In addition the second side of the menu offered nigiri, sashimi, sushi and Asian inspired appetizers.  I wasn't quite clear on some of the ingredients listed, and the waiter was excellent in answering my questions as well as giving me a little background on Executive Chef Rick Moonen.

After consulting with the waiter I ordered the Warm Soba appetizer and two specialty rolls, the California Roll (I was playing it safe!) and the Ebi Go Roll.  The waiter returned with disposable chopsticks, a ceramic soup spoon and a shaker of soy sauce.  Considering that the dining room was more than half full the time lines on the food were excellent.

The Warm Soba (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg?select=0AWoj6zm-riOcrL2irrXYA) was excellent with thin strands of dark-colored soba noodles in a flavorful dashi (broth).  Nice fatty pieces of braised pork belly circled the rim of the bowl and in the center was a delightful soft boiled quail egg.  As described the soba was warm.

Both of the rolls arrived on the same platter.  The California Roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg?select=JqumIcuWOSYljeqMuu6ydg) was mostly minced up blue crab with a bit of ripe avocado and crunchy cucumber.  Topped by toasted sesame seeds the roll was very good.  The Ebi Go Roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LYWbyu1EQM2o5hwHG5_Ldg?select=O7vm8KezcXcZVUtj5givbQ) was magnificent.  It is crunchy tempura shrimp with Kabayaki, avocado and jalapenos, wrapped in sushi rice then wrapped again with fresh tuna and topped with a jalapeno sauce and micro cilantro.  I loved the texture comparison between the soft tuna and the crunchy shrimp as well as the flavor contrasts between the tuna and the jalapenos.  Both rolls were made very well too as all of the ingredients stayed intact and did not fall apart.

The meal left me stuffed but wonderfully happy.

I went to @coachnwillies last night, as part of the @downtownphoenix spring fling pub crawl.
Coach & Willies is the reason negative ratings should be possible on @yelp.

I will never, ever return.

When we arrived, we ordered a beer, and a soda.

We also ordered nachos. They were piled high. This is a good thing.

Removing the first couple chips resulted in a couple olives falling on to the bar. I wiped them into a pile, but figured I'd wait until I was done, to catch anything else, and clean it up.

A few of us decided to have a shot, to celebrate a birthday-in-progress. I flagged one of the bartenders down.

He approaches me and says "Are you gonna stop making a mess on my bar?"
Me: "Excuse me?"
BT: "You're making a mess"
Me: "I would like to order a drink, not get hassled"
BT: "I don't care about your drinks, I only care about your tips"
Me: "Well you're not exactly working for one at the moment"
BT: "Are you going to order or not?"

I placed my order without any further comments, lest I inform him of my true feelings.

He takes my credit card and asks if I'd like to keep it open. I tell him no, because I have left my card in the past.

He returns with the receipt. On the "tip" line I write "NoFuckingWay!"
I work in a service industry. You don't treat me like shit and still get a tip. Fuck you.

A while later I go to order a beer. This same motherfucker tells me I'm cut off.

Yes, I am cut off.

I have had maybe three beers, and a shot, in 5 hours.

I ask another bartender, and as he is about to pour me a beer, the first SOB hollers to him that I am cut off, then proceeds to show him my receipt.

Because, apparently, you not giving a tip is justification for him being a cocksucker.

I demand to see a manager, and one comes over. I tell him that the guy is cutting me off because I refused to tip him, and he tells me that the problem is that there is a $10 minimum on CC transactions.

Curiously, that isn't stated anywhere. Further, this "manager" took my first beer order, when I arrived, and made no mention of the minimum when I bought just the one beer, nor did the other bartender mention that when I paid for the shots, which actually totaled $24.

This "manager" was gracious enough to let me pay their establishment for service again. /sarcasm

I will recommend to every single person I know to never patronize that establishment, and I will never return to a place with such puerile and petty employees.

Everyone just shut up and listen to me for a minute!

:::::Soy chorizo burritos in Las Vegas:::::

Ok, so maybe you don't find this news as exciting as I do but you cannot believe the excitement I have for Taco Taco and their love of vegetarians like me.

Until recently, trying to find veg-friendly, authentic, good Mexican food in this town was like going on a quest to find the Fountain of Youth.  It just didn't exist.  Sure, there were places that list "vegetarian" items on their menus, only to tell you that it's full of lard and chicken broth.  Then there are the tex-mex chain restaurants that are veg-friendly but about as authentic as this Italian-Hungarian girl making a burrito.  Taco Taco is The Fountain of Youth.

You have your choice of burritos, tacos, bowls, and salads.  Soy chorizo is available, but for more health-conscious vegetarians you can just stick with beans and veggies.  Speaking of beans, they aren't cooked in lard or pork!  Woot!

The burritos are large and can be stuffed with tons of ingredients.  The tacos have house-made tortillas that are cooked up the second you order them.  Now here comes a dilemma: do you get the burrito that fits tons of extras like rice and beans or do you go for the tacos with their delicious tortillas?  Life can be so cruel.

They also have some special items like soy chorizo tacos that have been grilled (crunchy like a taquito) and topped with spicy salsa and cheese.  Or there are breakfast burritos with potatoes.  Then there's the horchata and Jarritos among the many beverage options.  And did I mention they offer a salsa bar with radishes, pickled veggies, beans, and eight types of salsa??  

Don't you worry, meat-eaters, there are plenty of options for you and I'm sure they are just as good as my soy chorizo.

Just a heads-up, if you follow them on social media you can stay up to date with specials they will throw from time to time, like 2-for-1 tacos on a random Saturday afternoon or a free corn for checking in.

The owners and all the employees are super friendly and helpful.  Despite being on the opposite side of town, I've managed to make the trip out here far too many times.  Rumor has it they are looking for a second location which can be bad news for me if it's near my all my downtown drinking establishments.  Expect me to be 50 pounds heavier if that's the case.

Check this place out! And if you're vegetarian, make sure to tell them thanks for thinking about us!

Located by registration and the neighboring crystals wing of the expansive Aria resort, this unassuming contemporary restaurant had me intrigued as soon as I stepped inside. 

As we traversed through the dimly lit bar flanked with purple hued impressionist walled paintings that soared up to the high ceilings and into the main dining area, I couldn't help but be impressed by the sleek modern club-like feel of the space. It was the perfect mix of contemporary cool with traditional elegance. With chilled house music pulsating in the background, I did get an ultra lounge vibe from the restaurant, which was actually refreshing and relaxing. We also didn't feel crammed next to our neighboring diners, which made things feel much more intimate and private.

Our server was full of friendly banter and made every effort to make us feel welcome.  

We all went with the Signature Tasting Menu.  The wait staff knew that we were heading out to a show afterwards so they made sure our dishes came out at a good pace. 

We were started with a tuna tartare amuse bouche that was just the right mouthful of tang & punch of flavor to whet our appetites.

The first courses were all very good. From the fresh oysters to the beautifully prepared wagyu beef tartare to the exceptionally inventive foie gras brle.

The second courses were inspiring and enjoyable, as well. The octopus was grilled to perfection and the dayboat scallops were easily the best I've ever had! These thick golden medallions were beautifully seared on the outside locking in a fluffy and buttery flesh that left me in complete awe bite after bite.

Our third courses were also winners in my book.  The wagyu sirloin was mouthwatering and each tender bite was blissful. The 48 hour braised beef was incredibly soft and you could tell it was cooked for awhile for all those rich, permeating flavors to develop.

Desserts were exquisite and what could be better than a surprise at the very end! A shot of cinnamon hot white chocolate. It was both warm comforting and festive. An excellent end to an amazing meal. 

I can't say enough about my wonderful experience here. It's definitely one I'd gladly experience again and again.

Happy Eats!

Me and the wifey met up with Bethany E and her hubby Mike for lunch on a Sunday just right after they opened which was 12 pm. Already the place was packed and we were told that the wait was an hour. So we were given the option to sit at the bar. I thought it was better way for we got superb service in getting our rolls because the chefs were literally right in front of us.

We opted for the AYCE ($21.95) lunch option which was from 11:45 am to 6 pm. According to the menu, you had 45 minutes to alotted time to do the AYCE which didnt make sense because we were there for at least an hour.

What is good to mention is that most of the rolls you can get you have the option of getting a half (4 pieces) or full (8 pieces) roll. I strongly recommend that you get the half rolls so that you have more chances of trying more rolls. Some rolls are only available as a full (refer to menu for they clearly state which ones are not available for half orders). 

As for what I ordered. Man, I will only tell the names but not describe them because this review would go on forever! That's what's good about doing the ayce option because you can try just about everything!

What I got for starters were the Garlic Edamame, Fried Calamari, Ahi Poke, and Shrimp Tempura. Then, we got half orders of the Taylor Roll, Sexy Girl, and Frying Jason, Then full rolls only for the Spider Roll and Pixie Roll. We also tried one order (2 pieces) of the Seared Ahi. Lastly, we finished it up with 2 pieces of Strawberry Mochi.

Originally, we wanted a table so we can all hang out much more comfortably while we ate, but after sitting at the bar, I think we got our orders much faster for the chefs actually hand you your order instead of your server grabbing it and bringing it out to your table. If you are at the bar, the servers are mainly there to get your drinks, appetizers, and dessert. 

Overall, I think that this will be the measuring stick to other sushi places that I will be trying out. The only negative thing that might deserve a mention is the wait time. But after eating here, I can understand why it can be a long wait for they serve good stuff  and the overall size of the place is not that big. Shout outs to Bethany E and her hubby Mike for inviting us to lunch! You guys are awesome!

We came here during our recent stay at the Wynn for some late night dessert. They had these huge slices of cake in the display cases, so we figured between the four of us, we could easily polish one off. Now, when I saw huge, I am talking seven layers of cake and seven layers of frosting. Huge.

At $11.95 a slice, it was a little pricey. Because there were so many of us, we justified that it would have been more if we had purchased individual items on our own. So we went with it.

Upon ordering, we were greeted by a fellow named Dylan who was less than helpful. When we asked him questions about the menu, he just shook his head or muttered yes or no. Whatever. My friend asked for a glass of water, he ignored her. She asked again after the transaction, and he slammed it in front of her. Maybe it was us. Nope- the next group of people weren't from the US and were having a some trouble communicating their order. Did Dylan help? Nope. They asked a question about a sandwich and he just pointed to the menu and said, "whatever's up there, is on it." Thanks guy- I'm sure that helped.

Now, only Dylan was less than pleasant. The other lady (who I interacted with while getting some drinks), Denise, was super friendly and helpful. She greeted people at the register, asked if we were having fun and thanked us for coming. Complete difference.

Now, I did take off a star for service (was going to take off more, but Denise was the saving factor)- but the rest of the stars were taken off because of how bad the cake was. We went with the Strawberry Shortcake version that was made with strawberries and white cake. The cake seriously tasted like it had be sitting in the fridge uncovered for quite some time or next to a macaroni salad. It definitely didn't taste like sweet cake- but something that should accompany a salad. I think it was sitting for too long next to too many different ingredients. It acted like a sponge for all the other flavors. Gross.

I guess the cakes in the display case are just for looks- such a bummer that something so beautiful tasted so rancid. For being the Wynn, I expected their standards to be a little higher in food and customer service.

I dig Nosh & Swig. They had me from the second I walked through the door and they were playing Tupac. The vibe and the food are just too cool to pass up. Food porn that tastes as good as it looks.

NOSH- You all I know I can nosh. 
Beef Lumpia-Wonton thing. Delish. Served with a sweet and spicy chili sauce and garnished with green onions. Not on the menu, but if you are lucky it just might be a Chef Special that day. 

Pretzel Brat $8- You REALLY need to order these. Chicken sausage, sauerkraut, cheese gravy on pretzel roll. I cannot begin to tell you how much I enjoyed this and I don't usually get down on kraut. Everything works with this and it came on two separate rolls which was perfect for sharing.

Monte Cristo $7- ORDER THIS. My favorite dish here. The mellow melted goodness of the Gruyere complimented the smokiness of the Black Forest ham. But it doesn't end there. It's then topped with a perfectly fried egg and warm berry compote. Hot damn I loved this. 

Truffled Tots- ORDER THESE The best tater tots I have ever tasted. They were creamy, yet crisp on the outside and topped with shredded cheese. Every bite tasted of truffle and made me wish my friend I was dining with was allergic to potato so I could eat every single one of them. No such luck. We both battled it out for the last tater. You won't be disappointed with these and if you are well we probably wouldn't be friends anyways and your mutha's a whore.

Cock-A-Waffle-Doo $10- This was good, real good in fact. My only problem and it's a total personal one because I'm not perfect is it was dark meat. I don't enjoy dark meat chicken, yet it was crispy, flavorful and worked well with the sweet Belgium waffle and Berry Maple reduction. P.S. I could drink the reduction all by itself. 

Spicy Edamame $2- Small portion, but not short in flavor. GET THIS, TOO. We destroyed this and loved the sauce so much we were dipping the tots in it. 

SWIG- I slurped up the Chata-Effup which was a-okay. I am still excited for them to get their liquor license because I know they will have some crazy good cocktails.

Prices are cheap for the creative delicious dishes this place is bangin' out. Great place for sharing plates in a casual environment. The service was on point and friendly. These are good people executing great food and I can't wait to bring everyone I know back to grub and rap with me! IT WAS ALL A DREAM. I USE TO READ.....

The chefs of today may well be the Van Goghs of our time. The care and precision of modern food presentation has made some of the creations on our plates incredible edible works of art.

The Japanese have the art of food presentation imbued in their food culture and they really put their heart and soul into making their food a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.

On my visit to Las Vegas last September, I was starting to feel a bit jaded about eating at the big corporate named restaurants on the strip and sought out a dinner spot more in keeping with being a locals' favourite. A Yelp search threw up Raku and a quick check with local Yelp friend Emily R confirmed that it was one of her favourite spots in town.

I was especially drawn to their kaiseki menu, where they create a unique menu based on the best ingredients available that day. A quick phone call secured  my dinner reservation and as requested on their website, I pre-ordered the kaiseki menu.

My taxi dropped outside Raku, which is located in a non-descipt small off-Strip mall. Any initial fears about the unprepossessing surroundings were soon dispelled by the warm welcome I received on entering the restaurant. There was a general hubbub of conviviality in the restaurant all evening with many customers obviously being happy regulars.

I bagged a seat at my favourite place to sit in a restaurant - at the counter watching the chefs at work. I was able to chat to the main chef all evening, who was very happy to engage and explain things to me about my unfolding gastronomic adventure.

Every dish was a work of art and there were quite a few new flavours for my palate to savour.

1. Mountain potato croquettes in dashi broth

2. Eight mini treasures, including creations such as tofu skin with wasabi and egg with sashimi

3. The house signature homemade silken tofu with salmon roe and homemade green tea salt and soya sauce

4. Fluke sashimi and liver with spring radish and grated onion dipped in ponzu sauce

5. Japanese/Spanish mackarel marinated in yuzu

6. Foie gras/egg custard/summer truffle served in an egg shell

7. Eel with shisho pepper

8. Uni with egg

9. Kobe beef on hot rock flamed with Hennessy XO sauce

10. Mixed tuna over rice

11. Panna cota

As you can see, the list of ingredients is like a who's who of the best ingredients to pass one's lips. Everything was a delight to eat.

 I love the way that Japanese cookery has given exquisite food presentation to the west but in return, the has given them ingredients like foie gras to cook with.

Service was always with a smile all evening.

The final touch of class came at the end of my meal when the chef confessed that normally, they don't do the kaiseki menu for only one person due to the large amount of prep time involved but as I was visiting from London, they made an exception.

Arigato, Aburiya Raku!

There are few places that I make a decision to NEVER step foot into again. Yasu has earned this dubious distinction from me. 

First, let me give you my background with sushi since this came into question from the manager himself. I have been eating sushi for about 11 years. Some really bad sushi, some amazing sushi. I have mentioned in previous reviews that I have had sushi fresh off a boat in Hawaii. While I don't claim to have had ALL the sushi in the world, I know what good sushi and what good sushi service is. 

Second, let me tell you that I have had omakase (chef's menu) in several locales, so I know what it entails. 

I was with a group of friends on my highly anticipated visit to Yasu Sushi Bistro. We had made a reservation and were seated immediately. We quickly decided to indulge in the omakase menu. We wanted the best that Yasu Sushi Bistro had to offer! I always say "Hit me with your best shot!" 

Well... if you have nothing to do, and aren't hungry...you should do the omakase menu. It took Thirty Minutes between courses. And please don't think we were given platters full of food. This is more like 2 small oysters per person, A plate of 1 shrimp, a couple slices of King Claim, a dollop of Spanish mackerel tartar on a bone chip.... So think tiny gourmet food. So think how hungry and irritated I was Two HOURS later. In a 3.5 hour visit, we had consumed Four tiny dishes. I really tried to be patient, but this is absurd and unacceptable! I finally asked for the check as we wanted to leave and go eat elsewhere. I expressed my displeasure at the slowness of the meal. 

Now before you Yasu lovers roll your eyes and shake your fingers at me. Let me put it in perspective. At ANY restaurant, it is unacceptable to be the first table to arrive, watch subsequent tables seated, and fed, and watch them leave and you're still waiting to be fed... you would be ticked off too. Now add to that a condescending manager who comes over to talk to you and asks if you have ever had an omakase experience before and tries to piss in your pocket and tell you that it's raining. Unacceptable. Now, add to that the restaurant sending out another dish after you had already asked for the check and then CHARGING you for that dish even though you said you didn't want the dish. 

I have nothing against the food, though it wasn't very imaginative on the SUSHI level. What killed the entire visit was the slowness of the courses, the response of the management, and the lack of ethical treatment in regards to the check. 

I will never visit Yasu Sushi again and I bet my stress level will be all the better for it.

I walked in with a sore back and legs, walked out with a huge headache and even more sore back and legs.!

I'm going to start this review by the main reason why I only gave them a two stars review. Worse experience ever! 
When our massage was completed, we charged the massage on our credit cards and I was preparing tip money in cash for our two masseuses.. Upon that time, one of the lady, perhaps the owner  saw that I had only pulled out a $5 bill, she screamed out loud in Chinese, "Only $5 for tip!!!" I looked at her and rolled my eyes and regret I didn't say anything! I was in so much pain, I just wanted to get out of there.

I wanted to give Coco who worked on my sister $10 tip, and for the guy who worked on me $5 because I was nice enough to tip on such a horrendous massage!  Instead, I gave $10 each but walked out of there mad as hell! I wished I was more braver to say something back and I don't know what got over me to even tip more! Maybe I just really felt bad for the guy. 

After days of walking and walking from casinos to casinos, my sister and I are exhausted! What was needed was a good massage! Found this place by it's high ratings and by Yelp's recommendations. Called in and book an appointment at 10pm with Coco and Rex. 

Upon our arrival, they took us into a little sectioned out room with two massage chairs. My sister took Coco, and instead of having Rex, they said he had another appointment and swore to me another guy was as good as Rex and they told me not to worry. 

That was the worst massage I'd ever had!! The entire hour was miserable. I wanted to get up in the middle of the massage because it was so bad, but I felt bad because he was a nice guy and I he was new. 
First, he was confused to either have me sit up first or lay on my face first. Coco that was next to us was directing him what to do. He wasn't well trained and didn't really knew where the body pressure points were. He hurt me by massaging too hard on my bone, His massage techniques was just pushing and pinching. He had long nails so every time he used his fingers to massage me, his fingernails pinched my skin. I was so uncomfortable. I didn't get his name, but he was short and chubby, in his early forties, and didn't speak much English.

P.s.~ My sister said Coco's massage was only just OK. Three stars OK.

So this experience had FAILED! ... will never be back again!

Dang, Cantina Laredo - I wanted to like you so hard!  Like a hot date that ends in a restraining order, like an incredible hike that ends in poison oak or skunk spray - I've walked past this place for years, imagining a swanky, high-end Mexican food joint behind the dark windows and high prices; sadly, what I found was a very regular, uninspired restaurant serving up some rather meh Mexican food.  This was a 'man behind the curtain' Wizard of Oz moment for me.

Good things?  Mmmmmm - the warm spicy salsa which they serve along with another milder cold one (not so good) and chips is the reason this place gets 2 very enthusiastic stars from me - SO DELICIOUS!  It was hook-me-up-to-a-feed-bag delicious.  Service was quick and pleasant.

After that though, it all goes downhill.  Being vegetarian, I can 99% of the time find something meatless and tasty when I go out to eat but there were very few such options here.  I ended up selecting the Enchiladas de Espinaca and subbed in a Cheese & Onion one to shake things up a bit (I know, I'm very exciting).  When my meal came out, the waitress said she had the kitchen put zucchini alongside my Mexican rice instead of beans (wtf - who in their right mind opts out of beans for zucchini at a Mexican food restaurant?!); so began the first of my meal modifications - I might note here that while being veggie, I am a pretty low-maintenance diner.  So, just as the black beans are being brought out, I realize the sauce atop my cheese enchilada consists of red chili with beef chunks - again wtf - in my 31 years of life on this earth, no Mexican food joint I've ever visited has ever converted a cheese enchilada to a meat one via the sauce!  The waitress said they could make me a new cheese & onion with sour cream sauce atop (cringe).  The mushroom and spinach enchilada was kinda gross - something about the oil they used to saut the spinach in gave it a strange taste and the button mushrooms looked like they had been plunked into it straight out of a can.  The zucchini and cheese & onion enchilada were nothing I would ever want to order again.  Black beans were alright - hard to mess those up though.  

In defense of Cantina Laredo, if you're a big meat eater, perhaps you might have more luck here than I.  The place was clean, the workers were nice, the one aforementioned salsa is killer.  But this place is neither authentic nor new-agey Mexican, not worthy of the steeper price points, and certainly lacks any great ambience to carry the lackluster food.  Don't think I will be auditioning this place for a second date or hike - would strongly consider rolling around in poison oak or getting skunk sprayed over coming back - it was that bad.

Once upon a time... when Cher was still Cheryl... I sat in my auntie's old El Camino happily eating my strawberry shortcake when my auntie stopped at a red light on the corner of 20th street & Van Buren when out of no WHERE a crack head with a gun tried to car jack us. My auntie yelled and threw an half empty bottle of tequila out the window as she sped threw the intersection. This was more than 10 years ago and things haven't improved much since that day in this neighborhood.

When I read about Baiz Market it was from my fellow yelper Jim W. who ranted and raved and even encouraged me to check it out. The other night not having much to do, my friend Ree & I decided to go to Baiz Market which is just north of the intersection where my auntie & I almost got car jacked and check it out. We both have love for middle eastern food and know how to take on scary neighborhoods. 

When we walked up to the counter of the deli inside the quaint grocery store we were excited and a little scared of what to order. The cashier was SO patient and VERY nice about explaining everything to us! I really must give her props on that. There was a cab driver who was very helpful in explaining the different dishes and even recommended a few items. I listened to Tarek S. and chose the beef Shawerma it was delishous! My friend chose the chicken toolawoosh (is that spelled right?) sandwich which was very good with it's bell pepper, pickles and tomato fixins. We also chose to sample the small spinach pies which weren't that good btw and cheese pie which I could make at home with pizza crust & some cheese and the yummy yummy hummus that came with some pita bread. We also got a bottle of water and a can of imported orange soda. ALL this for only $27! Can you believe that?! 

The dining area was nice and quiet with mellow middle eastern music on in the background. Everyone kept to themselves and was nice to us even though we backed up the line. 

After our meal we wandered around the candy aisle in the grocery store and found lil heart shaped boxes of chocolates which - ummm wasn't that great! lol. We wanted to spend a heck of a lot more time going threw every aisle but unfortunatly they were closing so we had to leave. 

We will DEFINATLY be back! And prolly with a few more in tow. And no, no one tried to car jack us on our way out... but we did see a tranny hooker get questioned by the cops. Maybe if she went to Baiz Market for some baklava instead of walking the streets she wouldn't be in that situation! I'm just saying. To my yelpers, I say go! and when you go, order the beef shawerma and avoid the spinach pies! Oh and get there before 4pm so you can have time to really enjoy your meal without the rush!

Wow I expected much more from one of the Venetian's flagship eateries.
  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=I4InWGszg4yUFN2ReYq_Ig&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw

I stepped up to the plate as I was debating between the Grand Lux & the new burger joint Rattlecan. I opted for the tried and true and struck out several times. 

I had no wait to be seated and as I was guided to my table I almost wiped out as I slipped on the greasy floor in front of one of the kitchen door. STRIKE ONE!.

After studying hard to read the menu in the very dimly lit back of the resturant I decided on several items for dinner.

FOOD ORDERED:
Salisbury Chopped Kobe Steak 
House Green Salad 

A guy (manager?) came to me about 10 min after I ordered and told me that the chef did not like the look of the kobe beef, and would not serve it customers. This tells me that they didn't have any kobe beef. Regaudless, I had to pick another choice now almost 20 min into the trip.  STRIKE TWO!

FOOD Re-ORDERED:
Chicken Royale and Shrimp Scampi
House Green Salad 

WHAT I GOT:
House Green Salad ...  my salad and it was very good the blue cheese dressing was exceptional (although they charged me extra for it)  4****Stars
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VRVeFAfNVQtqdjvAZ23rQQ&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw
Chicken Royale and Shrimp Scampi ... I was pretty suprised by the entree it had lightly breaded shrimp in a citrius tasting cream sauce, masted potatoes grilled green beans and a thin piece of fried chicken with scallions. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tvJj23joNXjio7SdhYC5QA&userid=EMMzx-gGDKsU4enmbae6dw
This was not like any scampi I'd ever eaten nor was the chicken although tender very "royal".  Both tasted ok but I was not thrilled with what I got. The Mashed potatoes wer good as were the beans even though they were cold.

I finished my meal, the buss lady took away my plates and I waited for my check. And waited, and waited until I finally flagged down another waitress who said she'd inform my waitress, and I waited some more. Finally after 15 min I got a check then had to wait 5 more min for her to run my card. STRIKE THREE! 

Grand Lux Cafe YOU're OUT!

The Grand Lux Cafe is is a very nice place with great atmosphere, maybe a tad too dark but it needs to really work on the service.

I will not return to Grand Lux Cafe.

Me and a friend received the tea service at 2 PM for $20 a person. Actually in comparison to other tea services, this is pretty cheap -- so it's worth it if you really love tea :) 

Ambiance: 5 - I'm surprised that there was no one in this restaurant at the time that I went! Although, it is upstairs in a little hard to see for visitors & tourists. 

The place is clean and nicely decorated. there is a huge bar inside and a gorgeous balcony where you can eat. Or, you can sit inside and enjoy the warmth of the restaurant.

Service: 5 - The service was perfect! Our server always checked on us to see if we were okay or needed more water for our tea. They came out with everything pretty fast. They were chill about us staying there, so we took our sweet time ;) 

Food: 4 - First, the tea: I got wild berry tea. it's served with actual tea leaves and is very tasty. If you require honey, you must ask! 

The Plates: The bottom tier of sandwiches was really good!! There are. 4 types, but I really enjoyed that smoked salmon sandwich. 

The 2nd tier was the scone! It came with jam and cream for spooning on top. That scone is delicious. It's not crazy sweet, but light and fluffy. Actually, I might do tea service again just for the scone. 

The top tier was dessert. It came with macarons, chocolate nuggets, and a delicious cream puff. The macaron was probably not their best choice to include, but that cream puff makes up for it!!! 

Desserts change too; you may request certain desserts if they have them available! 

This is a calm, romantic spot for tea lovers! I'll probably be going again!

We have been to two Outbacks in the last ten years.

It's wasn't because the food was bad; it was just that the experience wasn't anything special.  

We tried the Happy Hour once up at Mayo Boulevard location and left underwhelmed. Recently however we received two gift cards and decided to give them another try.  

Outback has always reminded me of a slightly more upscale Sizzler, mainly because prices are so low.

Last night the three of us started off with Spinach Artichoke Dip for $7.99, Blooming Onions for $7.29 and the Coconut Shrimp for $7.99.  All these were pretty good, though the star was the Coconut Shrimp.  It was served with an orange marmalade/stone mustard sauce which was interesting, but we had to ask for some cocktail sauce in the end. The Blooming Onions on the other hand are still way too greasy for me and clearly they need to rethink this offering.

For our meal, we tried to order the Pork Chops.  But strangely, they had run out (?) this, so we had to substituted for the 1/2 order of Baby Back Ribs ($13.49). They were very good and had a nice smoky taste.  

We also ordered the Filet with Shrimp for $15.99.  We ordered it medium rare and it came out with a pink center and very tender. But as Yelp'er Jody K pointed out in her review -- the shrimp were tiny and way too salty, with some sort of Cajun/blacken seasoning just dropped on top.

Our last dinner item was actually their Short Ribs Nacho appetizer for $6.99.  It had a nice taste and must be considered an incredible value.

So our tab came to $74.60, including a diet soft drink, a nice Chteau St Michelle Riesling, and one of their special Black Sangria. This also included a discount of 50% off one entree that we found on-line as we waited for our drinks to arrive. LOL

I had a slice of pizza from this place at a friends house shortly after they first opened. I couldn't remember if I liked it or not, so I suggested to hubby that we try this place for dinner. The employees inside were very courteous and friendly and the guy who gave me the pizza let me know they offer delivery, which is a plus if you like the pizza. 

Hungry Howie's claims to be "The Home of the Flavored Crust" and offers 8 different types to choose from. The concept here I do like. It sounds like a too good to be true pizza place. Well, it is in my opinion. The 8 types of flavors are butter, asiago cheese, cajun, butter cheese, ranch, sesame, garlic herb and onion. Sounds great right?

I ordered a large "Cheese Pizza" and a large "1/2 Pepperoni and 1/2 Sausage Pizza" as well "Asiago Howie Bread" to go along with the pizza. When I first opened the pizza it looked great. I asked for the cheese pizza to have butter cheese crust. I could see the ring of butter soaked into the pizza box around the crust and it didn't bother me because I did order a pizza with butter on it, but the crust as well the pizza in general had no real flavor. Maybe all the butter cheese flavor soaked into the pizza box instead? The pizza wasn't gross, it just wasn't great. Very average for all the flavor the menu claims to offer. Hubby had garlic herb on his crust and after I sampled a bite of his crust I tasted no garlic flavor. The howie bread I found to be dry and not the type of cheesy I was looking for. The total was $25.93 for the 2 pizzas and bread which I wouldn't have minded if the food tasted as good as it looked. I might be up for trying this place again in the future, but not anytime soon. 

Other things offered on the menu are salads, calzones and wings. You can also order online.

My girls are the shit. They dragged me out and promised a night that I won't forget - but I almost forgot because of the bottle service!

Upon arrival for the midnight showing, our host walked us right in and dropped us off at the bar so we could get drinks while they got our table ready. I ordered the Washington Apple which consisted of: Pendleton 12 year Canadian Whiskey, Cranberry Compote, Lemon, and Apple Bitters. Delicious!

About 15 minutes passed and we were escorted to our table located in front to the left of the stage, but we ended up being front and center after they moved us :) Our server was friendly, fun and kept checking up on us throughout the night. Open the top of the ottomans to stash your purses, wallets, and phones here. The bouncers are geat at keeping an eye on your things and we always had people sitting at the table to make sure.

Now for the show.. I'm positive there are going to be those who haven't seen it reading the reviews so I won't go into detail, but these are a few acts to keep an eye out for: Prescott (super hot and an amazing beat boxing woman), Pandora (HOLY MOLY! Keep an eye out for her!), The Girl Who Plays with Fire, table tapping, and some lap dancing fun ;) There are maaaany more acts that will keep you enveloped with the highly inappropriate (love it!) show the whole time since there's always something going on!

The last act of the show helps transition Rose. Rabbit. Lie. into a "night club." The majority of the audience got out of their seats and went to the dance floor to have some fun. A few of the performers even came out to mingle with the crowd and danced with us (love you Frog Man). The stage keeps rotating to reveal the DJ, some fun with bubbles, and more performers doing various things. After half an hour, they did clear out the middle of the dance floor for a fun little cirque du doleil act. Then it was dancing time again! Since our table was right there in front, we got to both people watch while hanging out and step out onto the dance floor when we wanted to. I forgot how good it felt to just.. DANCE!

Remember that a little party never killed nobody ;)

Cafe Monarch is everything the five star reviews make it out to be and more. It's a must try for a unique brunch/lunch/dinner/whatever experience in the valley! I'm reluctant to review this place since I don't want to wade through patrons on my way to another lovely Sunday brunch, but my taste buds will not be deterred. (Plus I have until September before they re-open, so there's plenty of buffer room.)

It's an impromptu fly-by-the-seat-of-whatever-the-chef-feels-like-whipping-up type place. The kind of place where you show up to breakfast and are asked one question: Sweet or savory? 

So whatever you do, leave those picky eater at home! When it comes to dinner, you don't want a wonderbread palate ("Um, I don't eat anything green...") influencing the meal. Chef Christopher is a dynamo in the kitchen, and you need to leave that one man show plenty of room to create his masterpieces. No exaggeration, his dishes are crazy delicious masterpieces. It's like having your own personal top chef customizing something just for you.

The fact that this place is BYOB makes my heart smile. I love sharing a couple bottles of good wine or champagne among friends over dinner, and the fact that I don't have to pay a restaurant mark-up is ideal. He's also cool with you brining in some orange or cranberry juice for  DIY mimosas in the morning. There's a $10 corking fee, but considering the fact that a glass of wine is often more expensive than that, it's a screaming deal. 

Be forewarned that this is a dining experience rather than a quicky meal. A much more European approach to lingering and enjoying the food, drink and atmosphere. It will take you a couple hours to get through everything from initial seat and greet with the chef (who doubles as the waiter/busser/todos!) to your last scrumptious bite. Totally worth every minute of waiting. Also, you might not want to come here starvin marvin. And definitely don't invite anyone you can't stomach hanging out with for a couple hours. 

Let's wrap it up:
-Don't bring picky eaters.
-Don't come so hungry that you'd eat the ass end carpaccio out of fresh roadkill.
-Don't bring socially awkward schmoes that will suck all the fun out of the room because you've got to be around that for hours, man. Hours.
-Do BYOB, and don't be afraid to bring a mixer for mimosa fun.
-Do bring cash only, and tip very, very well. (He deserves it!)

I now set you forth upon the world with the knowledge necessary to enjoy all that Cafe Monarch has to offer. Use it wisely.

The beautiful Carin and I went to the Village this morning for our respective workouts...She hit the cardio machines hard and I played squash with my buddies.

As I finished my last game with one of my buddies, Jim (who happens to be a cardiologist), he mentioned that I looked a little emaciated...peaked even, and prescribed chicken and waffles, "stat" (stat is a medical term that means "with extra butter, syrup and a side of grits":)

Fortunately for me there is a new emergency location for Lolo's that has opened up altogether too close to my home:)

Serendipity started to smile on me when we pulled up just as someone was leaving and we scored the parking spot right in front...serendipity continued as we put our name in for the 30 minute wait, only to be called after 15 minutes...and continued to weave it's way through the entire meal, as we got our drinks right away (really, is there much of anything better than a 1/2 gallon of sweet tea with your Saturday afternoon brunch?:), and we were waited on promptly and served right away.

I was saved from wasting away:)

I was particularly delighted for 2 reasons:

     - This was only their second day open in Scottsdale and they were   absolutely slammed with both people eating at Lolo's and with take out orders, so it looked like the service was a little uneven...but the Lolo's staff were so darn nice to everyone, most of the customers seemed  to be pretty understanding:)

     - This was Carin's first experience with Lolo's, and like all of her other "first times" with me, I wanted it to be both "special" and "delightful"...I am a loving, thoughtful and caring husband:)

We couldn't have asked for it to go any better, especially for going by so soon after they opened:)

The chicken and waffles are every bit as good as the original location down on Yuma:)...Carin has fallen in love with Lolo's, too:)

The decor in the new place is pleasant...welcoming and comfortable...I love the wash tub lighting treatments:)

And the staff continues to be pleasant (trending toward sweet as pie) to everyone...they could have been pretty tight-faced today, because they really did have a ton of people (all looking to get their chicken and waffle on) come by Lolo's today.

I wasn't expecting to give these guys 5 stars right out of the gate, but doggone it, they earned it!

Great food, great atmosphere, nice people and now, right in the hood:)

I wonder if Jim is going to send me a bill for the medical advice? :-)

Lucky # 200!
(Disclaimer: Apologies for the long length of review)

A milestone number, deserves a milestone Review.  So it's only proper, that it's a Spa Review!

F A C I L I T Y,  F A C I L I T Y...F A C I L I T Y

I've been around--around the block and them some.   And when it comes to spa's I've seen it all, or at least I thought I've seen it all.   That was until I came here to Vegas and visited the Canyon Ranch Spa and Heath Club here at the Venetian/Palazzo resort.  

I've had the privilege to use both the Fitness Center and the Spa, so I'll be writing a review for both.  

*  Fitness Center *

What do you do wheny you've spent the previous evening at the Buffet for 3 hours?  If you are a normal person, you spend your time sleeping away after having bad-ass food coma.  

If you are like me, and have complimentary use of the Fitness Center, you take advantage of the start of the art facility to work off your previous meal. 

Talk about top-notch, high quality work out equipment!  Upon entering the Health Club from the Palazzo side of the facility, I was amazed to see first notice the huge rock climb wall.  Unfortunately, I did not have a chance to try out the wall, but for future visits, I definitely will.

Continuing down the stairway, I was even more amazed to see the Fitness Center.  All of the machines are provided by TechnoGym.  TV's built-in to all of the cardio equipment, and virtual terrain cardio biking as well.  Machines were the smoothest, quietest I've ever had.   In addition to the TVs in front of every machine, they were also 4 huge big screen TVs set above the entire room.  

If you are ever feeling guilty about eating in Vegas, this Health Center is definitely the place to rid yourself of those thoughts.  Second to the Spa in the hotel, the fitness center was my haven.  I've never had so much fun working out before, and time never passed so quickly!

*Spa Spa Spa* Ahhhhhh....

So this spa girl made it a PRIORITY to pay a visit to the infamous Canyon Ranch Spa.  I booked myself the Canyon Ranch Signature Massage, which is their version of the traditional Swedish.  My 50 minute massage was steep at $150.00, but competitive for Vegas spa prices.  Not much can be said about my massage that I hadn't experienced before, so I won't go much into the massage itself.  I will note that my therapist was Gary, and he was a very polite and hospitable.  

Again, what Wow's me about this Spa is the F A C I L I T Y!
If there are general standards for the Spa industry, Canyon Ranch comes to mind.  

By far my favorite part of the whole facility is the Aquavana Experience.  
The Aquavana Experience is a set of European-insipred thermal spa cabins, tubs and aqua thermal bathing.  

Within the Spa, both the mens and womens's locker-rooms are provided with an  HydroSpa (Jacuzzi), Finnish Sauna, Igloo, Crystal Steam Room, Experiential Rains, and Herbal Laconium.    

What makes the HydroSpa stand out in comparison to your typical jacuzzi tub, is the Volcano jet coming out from the middle of the Jacuzzi, and the sides of the tub which allow you to actually lay down on your back or front, with little jets straying throughout.  

The Sauna was a 3 level sauna, and they also provided wooden head pillows. Lol.  

The Igloo is a cold room of three different Artic Mists, with your choice of menthol, mint or eucalyptus scent.  Twinkling fiber optics also shines above.  

The Experinental Rains Shower's were interesting.  Here, you get to experiment different shower's that range from a Mist/Fog, Atlantic Storm equip with Thunder and Lightening, and also a Caribbean Monsoon shower.  Interesting, is the word, the water was cold of course, giving you the real deal in weather storms. 

Also within each locker room, is the Herbal Laconium, set with individual booths of heated tiles where you sit and inhale herbal scents.  

You can experience all these either before of after your spa treatment.  And stay as long as you like.  

In addition to the above facilities, the Spa also has a Communal Relaxation Conservatory, ready with comfortable couches and waterfalls to enhance your experience.  

But the Wow factor of the experience is the Wave Room able to be shared by both sexes together.  The wave room is literally a planetarium-like room with comfortable chairs that turn you upside-down where you stare up at a waves.  All while calming music plays. Talk about ultimate relaxation! 

I spent everyday of my vacation here at the Spa, at one part of the day or another.  

How do you know you are addicted to this place?  You are the last person to leave,and spa closes at 8:00pm. And you are being paged by the employees, telling you that your familiy is wondering where the hell you are.  LOL.  

Until next time dear Canyon Ranch!

Owner Scott Conant (the dude from Chopped) hates raw onions. Therefore, I don't trust him... half kidding

I think Scarpetta is more like 4 stars, but I knocked off a star because our party definitely felt a little sick after eating here. Maybe it was an off day (we think it's from the cheese in the potatoes of a side dish).

Undeniably a beautiful spot to eat. The large windows display the neighboring Bellagio water fountain show, where my girlfriends and I packed into one side of the booth, so we could watch and eat at the same time.

Oysters West Coast - good, fresh raw oysters. I loved the horseradish sauce that came with it, and a gravy boat of tabasco was brought to us upon request

Stracci - a flat noodle pasta with lobster, crab, shrimp. There were generous portions of seafood and the pasta and tasted creamy/good.

Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli - I actually have to go against the hype to say that it was just okay, and not that great. The dish was a tad bit colder than luke warm, and just the richness of the foie gras/drier duck made it hard to finish the whole dish. Maybe a couple bites and I was pretty much done with it :-P

Black Cod - So soft and melted in my mouth (I think I ate a cloud..). 

Ribeye of Beef 24 oz - For $62, this had better been some good ribeye. Although I know that Scarpetta doesn't specialize in steak, I thought it was a bit overpriced for it being standard and nothing special.  Even though it was medium-rare, the steak was still a tad tough.

**don't fill up on the bread** Scarpetta has fantastic bread. The bread basket had 3-4 different kinds of breads, one of them being a melted roll of salami and cheese (a meal itself). And the bread came with mascarpone butter (LOVE), eggplant dip, and olive oil

One of the better restaurants in the Cosmo. Did anybody realize the restaurants in the City Center area (Cosmopolitan, Vdara, Aria) are not that great? Hmmm

I read all the good reviews for this place so I thought I would give it a try.
My friend lives close, so I said I will meet you there.
To see it, you would never think ,oh this place will be great.
It is in a strange shopping center. Right next to Chino Bandito,or something like that. Though I must try that place one day as well.
When you walk in it smells divine!
My friend was already there and had ordered an Ice Tea.
She ended up getting the Chicken lettuce wraps, and I the Gryo dish,which is on a bed of fantastic rice.
We each got the chicken Potato soup. Oh my gosh, everything was fantastic! 
Plus we even got pita bread and they were nice enough to give me hot tea,even though it is not on the menu.
I even got 2 Baklava's to go. Which we had for dessert that night.
So glad I read the reviews or I never would of known about this place.
It is very clean as well, with nice clean rest rooms and lots of parking.

Being in Vegas and not wanting to eat at the Casino when we got in, I had bookmarked Eat after reading all the great reviews from LV Elite Yelpers and had to check this place out. Well I was truly glad that I got our group to let me choose the Saturday breakfast. (They actually had no choice I was driving)

Eat is roughly about a 5 minute drive from the California Hotel making it really convenient. Waiting only 10 minutes after we arrived at 9:00am we were seated in this nice trendy hipster place in downtown. The sound level was a little loud with the music and people chatting but it didn't deter us from enjoying the food and decor at Eat. 
Some of the items we ordered:

*Beignets http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=FfSeubYzwJBP9R_YfkUcvQ#FfSeubYzwJBP9R_YfkUcvQ Great item to share, jam and mascarpone made this dish yums.
*Eggs Benedict with turkey bacon and spinach: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=--TpWg7-6ctPuUbpzYUGvg#--TpWg7-6ctPuUbpzYUGvg  I swear the hollandaise sauce must be one of the best I ever had! 
*Pancakes with chicken apple sausage: My friend took one bite and busted out a huge smile. I got to sample the pancakes, melt in your mouth and a slight crunch on the edges of the pancakes made this dish a must.
*Eggs with smoked bacon and smashed potatoes: Smoked bacon was that standout of this dish.

*Outside seating available
*Street Parking
*Friendly Service

*Eat is a must for breakfast when staying in Downtown*

Eight of us came to this Ethiopian restaurant for dinner during Restaurant Week. Among all participating restaurants, we made the decision on Lalibela based on the strength of the prix fixe menu, availability of vegetarian and gluten-free options, and price.

We were seated immediately upon arrival and the interior was well lit, spacious, and clean. The seating arrangement started with a score of smaller tables that led to ours in the back. The vibe was casual and appropriate for groups of all sizes. 

My choice of appetizer, the Beet and Potato Salad, was a wonderful starter. The mix of chunky beet and potato came with great texture underscored by a light lemon vinaigrette flavor. This is one item I haven't had at Ethiopian restaurants, but it's something I would order again.

The main entre came with two forms of beef stews; pan-fried beef, chicken stew, green beans, collard greens, lentil, salad, and cabbage with carrots and potatoes. They were served on a bed of fluffy injera with just the right amount of sourness. I was addicted to the softness of the injera, and they were generous to replenish them whenever it was needed. 

The beef items were cut too small, but the spiciness was on point with purpose. The chicken needed to come with an egg, but the vegetarian platter was truly delicious. All the flavors were discernible, unlike some of the Ethiopian restaurants where the seasoning began to taste in uniform after a while. I particularly loved the spicy beef stew, green beans, collard greens, lentil, and cabbage with carrots and potatoes. My dinner companions really enjoyed their food as well.

For dessert, my choice of Mango Mousse Cake was a hit. Plating was not particularly striking but everyone raved about it once I passed around the table. It came with an intense mango flavor, soft custard-like texture, and a smooth refined finish. 

The restaurant became extremely busy by the time we left. And, for $15, the meal was a fantastic deal. I still think the execution was not as sophisticated as Awash, Meskerem, or Abyssinia, but when price and value are considered, this place can certainly go toe to toe with some of the better places around the country. Service was slow, but knowledgeable, responsive, and friendly. Interested diners should expect a good level of authenticity when it comes to the seasoning. Those interested should also be aware of their large portions--so be ready to take some of the food home. I'd be very interested in coming back for another feast.

Protip: BUY the groupon!! 1 admission for $12; 2-people admission for $21; and 4-people admission for $42 as of 2/24/2014. Yes, it gets cheaper if you buy more. There is almost always a groupon going on for this place! Always check!! Beats paying $20 per person there. 

*ALSO* if you buy a groupon for 4 people, but you just want to go by yourself/just with one other person, they will write a coupon card with the remainder! This way you can use your remaining groupon visits each time you come in with the card! So go with a friend or by yourself, they're accommodating for whichever groupon you purchase!

This is a korean spa tucked away on Sahara and Maryland. Not visible from the major streets. Ample parking.

I absolutely adore this place! You walk in, pay, and you're free to enjoy the saunas or pay extra for their facials/other spa services they offer. If you've never been to an asian sauna, (I know I was confused) here's some helpful step-by-step tips:

FIRST: After paying, they hand you a waterproof wristlet key for your locker; towels; baggy T-shirt + pants to change into for sauna. There's also disposable razor blades. Feel free to ask for extra towels and slippers! Some of the room floors are HOT. Trust. 
Go to your gender segregated room; take off your street shoes please!! Look for your real locker after the tiny shoe lockers. Deposit your stuff and bring any bath stuffs. Undress completely. Yes, it's one of those spas. You're nude. Get used to seeing other nude people as well. Haha.

If you're body-shy, wrap yourself with your itty-bitty towel. Head to the shower place room past the lounge area with the sinks/mirrors. There's rows of showerheads/mirrors along with generic shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispenser in case you didn't bring your own tote. Pull up a stool and have fun manipulating the temperature. To get a hotter water temperature, just know there is a red button to push in as you slide it toward you. It's a safety measure. Can you say unlimited hot shower?!

After, you can enjoy their 2 hot bath pools or their cool temp pool. Please don't go in without scrubbing/washing yourself proper! You're meant to go in nude for sanitation purposes. There's a dry sauna in this room as well.

Head back to your locker and change to your baggy T-shirt and pants. As you're barefoot, marvel at how clean everything is or just wear the slippers you asked for at the front desk. Head upstairs for the co-ed saunas now! 

There's a caf, lounge area with korean TV playing, and the sauna rooms. 

ROOMS: The clay ball room has giant tubs filled with tiny clay balls that are HOT as you get in. It is a bit noisy as you get in and out. Careful not to slip when you get out! 

The jade room is a room with large mats. Lie down with a friend, plug in your headphones, relax to the herbal-infused air here.

There's a water dispenser where the food bar is. Be sure to drink plenty of cold water!! Plenty of fluids are lost when you're sweating this much.

The red clay room is one of faves as well. Be warned, the floors are searingly hot as you step in. Clean house sandals/flip-flops are the way to go! The red domes each have a mat and a light control switch in there. It doesn't get too bright though. My friends and I play card games crammed in one dome haha. Easily the hottest room, sure to sweat your heart out. 

*Look for the wi-fi password listed outside this room!*

FOOD: The caf does have pricey food. I believe it comes with banchan (multiple korean side dishes like kimchi) with whatever meal you order. We normally get the hard-boiled eggs ($1 each) and the delicious sweet rice drink. Super refreshing. Hand them your key # and you pay when you return your key at the front desk.

One of my favorite rooms is the frozen room. Small. Feels like sitting in a mcdonald's freezer, only without the gross frozen McRibs and the self-loathing. Very nice change of pace from sweating.

After all that sweat, it's a good idea to head back downstairs, strip again (throw your sauna clothes in one of the large chutes), and take another shower. They also have standing showers at one end if you want a lighter shower. 

AMBIANCE: it's never super crowded whenever I go, especially during the weekdays. Very soothing. Quiet normally. 

Have a hangover? Stressed out? Come here. It's fun to go with friends. It's slightly awkward being naked around each other at first, but it's also a great place to bond, hang out, and have a girls' day. You know it's love when a friend scrubs your back! Also a fun date idea. My skin always feels amazing when I leave. Super affordable, fun, and a great experience! Absolutely my favorite place to detox and relax.

We came here around six this past Saturday, and found SaladWorks refreshing.

Yes, I know it's a salad bar.  But it's much more.  It has frozen yogurt with various toppings.  It has...   wait for it...   a wide selection of bottle beer. Yes, beer.  Haven't you ever thought of combining your liquid carbohydrates with your protein?  If you're not into beer, they have wine, or soda.  They even carry the healthier beverage of water or seltzer.

What makes SaladWorks unique, is their focus on fresh.  They cut up each of their sixty or so salad items each morning, and throughout the day.  According to their corporate marketing speak: 

"In 1986, John Scardapane developed the Saladworks concept while working as a gourmet chef at a southern New Jersey country club.  Saladworks continually won over new fans with its fresh take on salads.  John's vision meant an end to the days of chemical-coated tomatoes and brown-tinged lettuce.  He decided that salads should be made to order, chopped on-location and assembled right in front of your eyes."  Yeah, for some reason I'm not a big fan of salad bars because of the "chemical-coated tomatoes and brown-tinged lettuce."  Problem solved.

Our meal ran us $18.28, including tax which seems a little high considering we were drinking water.  I opted for the "make your own salad" which has the drawback of $0.79 (protein is $0.99) for each item.  So in the future, I'll start with one of their base salads and add on from there.  

Interestingly, they do not have any vegetarian or vegan base offerings on the menu. D'oh!  All seem to come with a meat or fish protein attached to the salad, including the wraps.  They'll need to fix this going forward, or better educate the staff on the options.

The setup is pretty straight forward. The restaurant itself is brightly lit, very clean, and located in the old Starbucks/ Sushi restaurant location.  Since the restaurant is so new, it was funny watching cars pull up and then back out realizing the other places aren't here anymore.  Both are on the other side of FLW.

We'll be back.  Enjoy!

It was a dark and windy Bike Week 09 type of night. After spending most of the evening at West World, surrounded by hot biker boys... I was hungry. 

I suggested hitting Corbin's for some food and drink. I had never been to Corbin's before and I'm glad we went in for a quick bite. When I opened the door to Corbin's I was hit by a semi-swanky vibe. I was certainly glad I wasn't all "Dirty Harleyed" out. I was more "Harley Hookered" out which, in my mind, is more swanky bar vibe acceptable. 
We were greeted warmly and seated at a table in full view of a family that was VERY interested in our presence (it could have been my super low cut shirt...hmmm...sorry about that...not really.). I even waved! I love my "adoring" fans who found themselves back to being busy with events at their own table. 
Anywho... back to the events at my table! 
After ordering a glass of wine (and being told they were out of my first choice..grr) I finally scored a nice glass of pinot noir. I also went with the grilled cheese sandwich. It wasn't just any ol' grilled cheese, my dear yelpers! This yummy sammie had cheddar, swiss and queso fresco cheese and it was all grilled with thick-cut bacon and a good hunk of tomato. I chose whole wheat for my bread. It was WONDERFUL. The home-cut fries were so good and they have yummy ranch to go along with it! My biker boy chose the Cajun Tasso ham quesadilla. Again... so yummy! The ham was nice and spicy but not HOT, just had some nice seasoning going on. The quesadilla is the size of a small, thin-crust pizza. So it can easily satisfy one person with leftovers to take with them. The whole meal was surprisingly VERY good! 

I only wish that Corbin's chairs were more comfortable to allow for some serious lounge time. I could imagine myself lounging after a great meal and just soaking in the swanky atmosphere. They have a nice bar area and also have hip music playing in the background. 

I look forward to another visit to Corbin's. I promise to not come dressed like a Harley Hooker next time... or not.... we'll see! Continue to surprise me, and I might surprise ya back Corbie!

No f-ing way.  Over an hour's wait and $43 later, only to realize that you're getting this crap from such a highly praised buffet?!?!

I dined at the Wynn buffet when they first opened over 3 years ago and wasn't impressed then, and I am not impressed now.  Let me break it down for you:

* Seafood station: the only worthwhile item of the bunch were the freezing cold crab legs.  You could only find smoked salmon and shrimp cocktail here -- whoopdeedo.  No raw oysters will be found here.

* Sushi: three types of "pseushi"  (Ken K.) consisting of California rolls, vegetarian rolls, and last but not least, Salmon maki rolls.  No sashimi, no nigiri.  They even had this pathetic seaweed salad that was 10% seaweed and 90% celery.  Oh, and not to mention they offered kimchee, because kimchee is so appropriate for sushi.

* Carving station: prime rib, turkey, and rack of lamb.  Everything was fine here, except for the angry carving station lady who couldn't cut the meat properly because she was under-slicing the meat, so she kept losing grip of the knife and thus, splattering beef juice on the customers.  She expressed no apologies for splashing beef juice on the nice blouse of the poor girl in front of me.  Not to mention, when I asked for a more rarer lamb chop (seeing that an entire uncut rack was in front of me), she proceeded to give me a well-done lamb chop that was leftover from everyone else's pickings.  How rude!

* Dessert station: alluring desserts that tasted horrible.  Stay away from the dry cupcakes, rock hard poppy seed lemon pastry, mediocre cookies, and way-too-thick crepes.  The ice cream was delish though.

* Other pathetic and disappointing offerings: hummus, baba ghanoush, pita bread, cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, miso soup, and tons of baked bread as fillers.

The only things keeping the Wynn buffet from plummeting to a 1-star review is their beautiful dining area, amazing vanilla ice cream, tasty lamb chops (when given the perfect medium rare piece), and the attentive service.

Take my advice though, and spend your $50 elsewhere.  Las Vegas has so many other great dining establishments that are well worth the money spent.  The Wynn buffet is just not one of those.

So long Pink's, hello The Wiener's Circle! I was sad to see Pink's go, but the location was never going to work with the jacked up prices and confusion with the names they gave the hot dogs compared to what they are actually called at the original location in California. So, The Wiener's Circle enters in its spot. Will it last? Time will tell! I must admit, I did watch the TV show they had on a while back and found the games they played with the customers (at night they curse at the customers and play crazy ass games... It's intended, expected to all customers and hilarious) funny. I was surprised they opened up in Vegas, but hey it saved me the trip to Chicago for the moment! The original location in Chicago has been in business for over 30 years.

Looking over the menu board, I was surprised at how fair the prices were. The prices here range from about $2-$3 higher depending on the item compared to the Chicago menu. Being in a casino we can expect higher prices, but they weren't too outrageous. I ordered "Wieners in a Blanket" priced at $4.99 for 6. They are made fresh to order. I had my choice of sauce and chose honey mustard. That honey mustard had a real good flavor and paired nicely with the tasty blanketed wieners. They also come 12 to a order, but the 6 was good enough for me. Priced at $4.99 I also ordered "Cheddar Fries" and wow were they good! The fries are fresh cut and come 1 pound per order. The cheese they put on top was very good! Hubby and I split a "Char Polish" priced at $6.99 and came with mustard, relish, onions, pickle, tomato, celery salt and sport peppers. It was pretty good. Next time I would ask for a lighter char, but a decent hot dog with nice toppings. All the burgers and dogs come with those toppings unless you tell them to leave it off. They are happy to customize your order so just ask! If you are in a pinch for time you can phone your order ahead and just pick it up. Aside from lunch and dinner they also serve breakfast and offer Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

I bookmarked Renegade a few months ago, but didn't have the inclination to go until I decided to try takeout from Stone & Vine and spotted Renegade next door.  I already planned to try Renegade after Restaurant Week ended, so imagine my surprise to find an invitation via text last night to attend today's Grand Opening VIP Tasting!  (I'd just arrived from a terrific RW dinner at Sassi when I received the text.)  I received the confirmation email this morning asking guests to arrive in casual attire.

Arrived before the place started to get crowded.  Spied a couple of old acquaintances, and we decided to sit together.  (Had a great time catching up with you, Chris and Heather!)  Glad we moved to a table close to the musicians playing at the front- Jared Blackstone sang and played guitar, while another would join in on keyboards from time to time.  He did covers ranging from Rob Thomas and Johnny Cash to Pearl Jam and The Beatles.  So good was the music tonight that Heather and I went and bought CDs.  I hope he's on regular rotation at Renegade...

Before moving to the table, we sat at the bar, where Heather and I immediately were given ribbon-tied plastic bags filled with fruit-infused rum cocktails finished with Kool-Aid.  I couldn't have any, so I gave mine to Chris.  At the table, Heather ordered a glass of Earthquake Zin, and I a Rosemary Margarita, which had an ice cube made up of a rosebud and rosemary sprigs!  So delicate and very pretty, yet packed quite a punch! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale?select=_fcCyNNVYAMPDoCmi9NkHw#_fcCyNNVYAMPDoCmi9NkHw

Here's what we sampled...

Venison lollipops dusted with dry mole http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale?select=4KVXnXAm8j3t-5VBet-dEg#4KVXnXAm8j3t-5VBet-dEg

Crab mac 'n cheese http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale#w1v6-PF0tYC5NfZ3RfXeyQ
Black bean hummus & raw veggies http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale?select=GBDdAENiERWBeQJnZGLYUQ#GBDdAENiERWBeQJnZGLYUQ (too sour!)
MOD 'N Sour pork wings and Slider "MODS" Kobe beef and bufalo sweet chili sloppy joes with Velveeta http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale?select=RLohz8wYTXLR8e-ZCouEMg#RLohz8wYTXLR8e-ZCouEMg
Flavored goat cheese cream under smoke-fennel pollen essence http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/renegade-by-mod-scottsdale?select=TCq1A2-aLJTJD0ABfZsXGQ#TCq1A2-aLJTJD0ABfZsXGQ

My faves were the venison lollipops, kimchi pate (on duck-scented black bread!), pork wings (not too sour or sweet- perfect!), Kobe beef sloppy joe sliders, mango pudding mini-cones, crab mac 'n cheese, and of course, the winner of the evening-- flavored goat cheese cream served on ashtrays!  The first serving I had, I concentrated on the different flavors and textures of the sweet dish-- smoky fennel mixing with the creamy goat cheese, and the nutty fennel pollen amidst the silky goat cheese cream- oh la la!  We were practically begging for more!  When we finally got seconds of it, a server actually brought out a covered smoking tray, stopped in front of our table, waited till it dawned on us what we were about to receive, and then lifted the cover, and out drifted smoke!  This time, the fennel pollen tasted even smokier than the first batch, and then I finally had to stop and shake my head, because darn it, I'm eating out of an ashtray!  I'm sure it painted quite a picture to see me, a non-smoker who abhors the habit (I work in a smoke-infested environment), eating out of an ashtray with glee!

We each took a parting gift of Mole Gold 24K gold-infused EVOO and a set of headphones in a paint can on our way out, and I asked the artist I'd passed a couple of times on my way to the restroom, he had an unfinished canvas next to him, if he was responsible for some of the artwork adorning the walls; he said yes.  He is Lalo Cota, and he's painted some of the murals here, as well as the ceiling of one of the dining rooms, and has done artwork at PHX's District American Kitchen and Wine Bar. 

I shall return!

p.s.  Also tried a tough pork belly and two Big Azz burger lollipops (one good, the second not so).

After reading a few reviews I was really tricked into thinking the portions would be minuscule. Like french-modern-cuisine tiny, but luckily I was wrong. 

I erred on the side of thinking the portions would be small so I ordered us two starters but we could have just done with one. However, they were both drool-worthy. One was the baguette with creamy garlic, it consisted of  6 slices of bread with a whole garlic cooked until it's spreadable covered in olive oil and spices. Basically you scoop a clove out and spread it on the bread. This was good, like drool-on-you-keyboard-good (DOYKG). We also ordered the Nosh plate,a typical melon, meat, cheese and nuts plate. Everything on that was tasty and both would have been great alone, but I'm glad we tried both.

For main courses my gf ordered the mac and cheese with prosciutto and breadcrumbs and liked it. I had Vovo's special which is a rotating special. Last night it was the tamale and tortilla soup. We both liked our dishes and were stuffed. I was a little envious after seeing another couple's dish. They ordered the chicken and waffles. It wasn't your typical soul food style but it looked tasty regardless. We both had wine. Gf had the Rose which she thought was a little dry and I wasn't too fond of either. I had the Tempranillo which I liked but wasn't amazing. That's probably the only gripe, I wish their wine list was deeper.

All in all the place was awesome and a great date destination. Romantic lighting and original decor and architecture, good for conversation starters.

The crowd was older that I expected, not a negative just an observation, although it was a Thursday and that might change on weekends. The service was nice and the free after dinner snack. Chocolate covered cookie dough was like pastry crack and also (DOYKG).

Side note: The prices aren't cheap but they won't break you. Especially if you go to other establishments in the same area. My tab for this meal was $60 which is good I think. Two sides, two glasses of wine, one main course and one small course. Not bad as far as I'm concerned.

Gold Dust Woman

Damn I really hate being THAT guy.  You know, the last on one the bandwagon...before everyone else has already jumped off because it's going down in flames.  Well, because of Lil Brown Sugar's Cupcakes, I officially jumped on board (feel free to exit the cabin at any time).

Over the past 3 weeks, I've sampled probably a dozen flavors and all of them were absolutely spot on.  First of all, if you've read any of my reviews of cupcake places (if not, I will find you and tape your eyelids open), I don't like frosting.  Yeah, I'm odd like that, but my kids love that they get an extra dose of kiddy crack.  These are the only cupcakes where I absolutely cannot pass up the frosting.  They capture the essence of the flavor in the frosting, like how Jelly Belly does in a jelly bean.  Seriously!  Here's a rundown:

1.  Key Lime - Hold your butt cheeks together otherwise you'll shit yourself.  The frosting tastes like a fluffy key lime pie.  Well, not "like" a key lime pie...EXACTLY like one.  I actually ate the frosting before the cupcake.  It so light and fluffy it feels like there aren't any calories, just angel dust.  The cupcake itself had a hint of lime, which was nice, but really, it was second fiddle to the frosting.

2.  Butter Beer - I think this was butterscotch cake batter mixed with cream soda topped with butterscotch frosting.  I'm not a fan of butterscotch, but the flavors were so rich and flavorful.  The cake was a little too dense for my wife's taste, but exactly how I like it.  

3.  Peanut Butter Cup - It was a chocolate cupcake with a Hershey Kiss baked inside, topped with peanut butter frosting.  I hate peanut butter, so this wasn't my cup of tea because it tasted exactly like a peanut butter cup (duh).  On the other hand, my wife and mother-in-law thought this was their favorite of all.

4.  Strawberry Lemonade - One of my favorites.  The cupcake is a strong lemon flavor.  Not tart and not sweet.  Just easily identifiable as lemon.  The frosting was on the sweeter side, so I did scrape off about half, but it perfectly complemented the cupcake to the point where it really did taste like a mild strawberry lemonade.  

5.  Orange Dreamsicle - Just like when Ego eats the ratatouille, my hanabata days memories of eating a Meadow Gold orange dreamsicle came rushing back.  This cupcake was like eating a fluffy one, and without the brain freeze.  Of all the flavors I've tried, this is the most subdued, yet highly addictive.

6.  Chocolate Covered Strawberry - Exactly as described, a chocolate cupcake with strawberry frosting.  Not quite the most memorable, but not too shabby either.  The fact that the frosting is mixed with FRESH strawberries gets points from me.

7.  S'mores - Dude.  Totally tastes like a s'more.  And nowhere near as sweet as a real one.  Chocolate (maybe it was Devil's Food) cupcake with marshmallow whip frosting, topped with crushed graham cracker.  My family still raves about this one.  

8.  Thin Mint Cake Pop - When the lady behind the counter told me it tastes like a Thin Mint, she wasn't kidding.  Sans the snap of the cookie, this thing is choco-minty goodness.  Get two of these and you almost have a box of the real thing.  

9.  Sugar Cookies - I buy these for my rug rats.  Haven't been able to taste them because they're usually gone.  I guess that means they're pretty good.

10.  Red Velvet - Tastes like red velvet.  Although it is exactly as described, I would have to say this is the most boring flavor offered (this statement comes from a guy who LOVES red velvet.  I'm the guy who bought my wife a red velvet birthday cake because hell, if I like it, she better like it too (right?)).  I suggest you do yourself a favor and try anything else in the case.

I would argue that these tasty nuggets don't contain brown sugar.  No, they must have been sprinkled with some gold dust because I'm ready to dig in with my silver spoon.

Thanks to the awesome review from my yelp buddy Nelson Q, I decided to bookmark this place and make it a point to stop here the next time the boyfriend and I are in town.

After figuring out where it was from where we were staying we put it off until the next day we would be in the general area. This place is not close to the Strip its a little past DTLV, but in my opinion, it's totally worth the drive to get some cheap yummy Mexican treats. The place is located in a small kind of run down business/shopping center. Do not let it scare you, it is safe as for what you find inside will totally be worth it! 

Walking in the first thing, I see is a couple of bags left of my precious snack that I have been longing for, Duroa de Harina with lime and chili salt (or in English wheat pinwheels ).

They also have helado (Mexican ice cream) that is made fresh in house; some of the flavors that I saw there were:

Fresa-Strawberry
Guayaba-Guava
Mango
Pina-Pineapple
Lime
Bubble Gum

and a bunch more that I could not see because not only is this place super small, but after 5:00pm on a weekday, this is the place to be after a hard day at work or school!

If you do order ice cream they offer a free topping as well, which is great! 

They have a nice selection of agua frescas (Horchata, Tamarind and Melon). 

If you are not wanting desert right away then they also have tacos and burritos too, which the boyfriend and I decided that we will have to try the next time we are in town!

They also have Smoothies, Tostilocos (one of my favorites) an assortment of Mexican candy as well!

Prices are amazing for a single scoop of ice cream and my bag of Duroa de Harina it came to under $8.00. 

Note: If you are not certain on how a flavor will taste you can try a sample of it. Everyone working there was very nice and helpful. The parking lot can be a bit of a zoo; we parked toward the end where there were a couple of extra spaces.

Wow. The sandwich game has been lifted. 

I came to Buddha Belly Deli after I saw a few Elites, one in particular (Shirley B.) frequented here about three times over the course of two weeks. That's some bodacious Buddha dedication. You know what though, her dedication was rightly placed. 

Not only is the food here amazing, but the staff is insanely helpful and friendly. With my hunger pains increasing I walked in and zero'd in on the "Schezwan Shrimp Po' Boy"... "yes please!" My lunchtime partner got the "Pho Dip", a very thinly sliced meaty sandwich, with pickled veggies piled high, and accompanied by a hot side of Pho broth. 

To kick-off this food frenzy, we also order smothered-fries. Now these aren't your drunken southern uncle's chili-fries, these are on another level. Crispy, thin french fries covered with a thai chili flavored pulled pork. They call this type of topping "Sloppy Joe", on the menu, but it's more than the all American slop you're most likely used to. It's a game changer in-deed. Simple, but amazing and once this hit the table it was game on! 

I'm pretty sure The Schezwen Shrimp Po' Boy had a dash of Viagra in it because I was getting more and more aroused with each flavor-filled bite. Loaded with fried shrimp, a spicy mayo, pickled jalapeos and a few other pepper options. This amazing concoction of sandwich fair was wedged between two very soft pieces of a french baguette. The shrimp was crispy on the outside, but still juicy and firm on the inside. Seriously I could have eaten two of these at one sitting.
 
Now, at this point my hunger monster was taking over and I noticed that my lunchtime partner still had half of her "Pho Dip" sammie on the plate. I asked her for a taste and before she could even answer I was already mid-bite. Soft bread, a big layer of thin sliced meat, and a perfect Pho broth to dip it in. This was pure magic. I ate almost the whole thing before coming out of my flavor induced black-out and seeing an angry glare staring back at me from across the table.

If you were to witness this gross display of gluttony, it would remind you of Shark Week's "best of" clips... you know where a shark's eyes roll into the back of their head before they viscously attack some poor unsuspecting tasty creature. I couldn't care less, no food shaming here. 

Honestly this isn't just a sandwich shop, but a place where the owners actually take pride in their food on many levels. There it is folks... The secret has been unlocked. Just take pride in your art and maybe something beautiful and tasty will come out of it. 

Whoa. That last line might be the Buddha talking.

Saturday night, no reservation, my choice was to wait 45 minutes for a table or take a table in the bar.  I opted for the bar.  I should have waited or went somewhere else.

I had eaten at Roy's in Philadelphia, which was an awesome experience.  I expected that same in Scottsdale.  Didn't happen.

I started out with my favorite drink, an Original Hawaiian Martini.  They are not cheap with the alcohol in the drink, it's very potent.  For dinner, I opted for choices on the Prix Fix menu.  My starter was a Hawaiian Crunch Winter roll.  It was great, made with shrimp tempura and avocado.  For my entree, I selected the Panang-style tiger shrimp with vegetable coconut curry and jasmine rice.  Very good combination of flavors, but could have been served a little warmer.  Dessert was the always awesome "Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle".  This dessert is always to die for.  It's the best  dessert I have ever had anywhere!!

Other than the slightly cold entree, the thing that amazed me about this restaurant was the fact that the staff didn't intercede when a nearby customer managed to annoy me all evening long.  This guy was in the restaurant bar, supposedly waiting for his brother.  Well, I was there for over an hour and the brother never showed up.  Go figure.  But, in the meantime, this guy managed to annoy me, tell me strange stories, sit at my table (until I asked him to leave), go back to this table, remove papers from his bag, bring them back to my table and spread them out, (until I asked him to leave again), used my cell phone to call his brother, mother, sister, god knows who else.  But at least while he was on my cell phone, he wasn't bothering me.  He even begged me for a ride and helped himself to some of my food.  You get the picture.  I can not believe that the staff allowed this to happen.  It's outrageous.  Other customers noticed, I guess I should have demanded to speak to a manager to have situation resolved, but I didn't want to make a scene.  I couldn't believe it was happening or that is was allowed to happen!!!  I even had to sneak out a side door when this nut wasn't looking, so he wouldn't follow me.  Completely nuts.  I think a restaurant of this caliber has an obligation to protect it's customers.

I don't just hand out 5 star reviews. ESPECIALLY after only one visit. But I have absolutely not a single doubt that I will be back for this incredibly fresh seafood. AND I DON'T EVEN EAT OYSTERS! We came on a Saturday night, and luckily since there was a fight going on, there was NO WAIT!! (note taken: come on fight night) After reading a ton of reviews, I pretty much had my heart set on the Signature Pan Roast with shrimp crab and lobster at about level 8 spice level, long before my arrival. But I also got a cup of New England style chowder first. Other than being along the coast in Oregon or Washington, best I have had!  This clam chowder was thick, with HUGE amounts of clams. Exactly what I expected. 
My bf got the shrimp scampi, and the stepson went with the Bouillabaisse. It literally had one of everything in there! Like a big fish stew! Even the sourdough rolls they brought to the table were great. And watching the chef cook your food, as well as others is the best part! 
My boyfriend is semi allergic to shrimp, and he still wanted to return for one of those beautiful lobsters.
The spice in the pan roast was perfection, however next time I will get one scoop of rice instead of two. It soaks up the spice which I am sure most people usually love. The chunks of crab and lobster were full of flavor! It will be hard for me to order anything else. 
The service was great, and in a casino you can't always expect that. Overall a wonderful place for good seafood and fresh shellfish!

Well, I have to admit that I wasn't expecting to be blown away by the cuisine here, but goodness gracious was I. Stopped in promptly after 5pm to sample this new East Blvd restaurant installment and I'm thrilled that we did. It's in the old Sutton House building at the corner of East and Kenilworth. You can't miss it now. Upon the Yellow brick rests a glorious mural facing the Kenilworth side and it's gnarly. Really like the aesthetic. 

The interior has your typical kitschy bar decor, pop art on surfboards, and plenty of beer paraphernalia. Tables, booths along the east wall, ample bar seating, 25 draught beers with plenty being local(s), cocktails a gogo, and a moderately expansive menu. On to the meal.

Started with the chips and salsa -- Pineapple and tomatillo. The pineapple salsa was great, perky, laden with cilantro, and super sweet. It worked well with the lime salt on the chips. The tomatillo....lacking. It had a pretty viscous consistency and I didn't enjoy it very much at all. Topped with a bit of Cholula and it was passable. There are a few different salsas. I'm looking forward to trying them all. 

Tacos. Hmm where to start other th....AMAZING. Dude. Seriously. The tortillas are textbook. Flour tortillas were choice du jour and are lightly fried, puffy, housing a slight crunch and retains a light chew throughout. I'd like to lobby for a take-home pack of these tortillas, por favor. Went with the pablano shrimp tacos. Sign me up. Every time. Smoky pablanos, chipotle cream, slaw, spicy shrimp. I didn't want them to end. Your order can consist of two or three tacos. I went with two and it was plenty for an entree. 

Tempura avocado tacos. Umm...vegetarians should be lining the block for these. I was astonished at the flavor(s). I may order these again for myself. Great job, fellas. 

Sides. Mexican Street Corn. I repeat, MEXICAN STREET CORN. Just go look at the photo I posted. Stellar execution. Try it. Thank me later. Repeat. 

Black beans and rice. They were A-OK. Flavor was rather pungent but a nice rounded side for tacos. 

Price point is fair, staff was suuuuper friendly, and the location is great. Only real problem, which I'm sure all could commiserate on, is the parking issue. We walked since we live in the neighborhood, but the parking situation is abysmal. Garage parking, some street parking, or snag a space at an adjacent business and pray not to get towed. Maybe that vacant lot can turn into something in the future? Hmmm...

Synopsis: We'll be back. Very soon. (For more of those tacos, no doubt)

Cheers and welcome to the neighborhood, Longboards!

I always make a point to inquire as to what people do for Christmas dinner. This is easily mistaken as an interest in learning and understanding other cultures, when in reality I'm just looking for a scapegoat. 

Just once, when someone screams "YOU EAT CHEF BOYARDEE FOR CHRISTMAS!?" at me, I'd like to be able to say "oh yeah...well [insert your name] eats [insert something like but not necessarily puppy tails and applesauce]!"

For like, a long time, my family have made hand-made ravioli for Christmas. It's a long and laborious process that takes up the better part of a Sunday afternoon. So naturally that's when I decided to pick up a gift certificate for someone from Tammie Coe.

We're almost knuckle deep in flour and grated cheese when I call to see when they close. 

The ravioli was going to take us 2-3 hours to finish. 

And guess how much longer Tammie Coe was open? That's right, 2-3 hours.

The smell of dough still fresh on my threads, Misty S and I jetted (or should I say "jetta'd"...fuck you) to central phoenix to pick up the gift certificate before the dogs realized they preferred raw dough to dog food. 

Now, I had been to Tammie Coe quite a few times,  usually in tow with Amanda B. Since layers of delicious frosting tend to clash with layers of expensive makeup, I usually opt out of eating any of their tasty treats. I simply sip on a peach tea and pretend I'm not starving for some fucking cake.

But there we were, on a Sunday morning, dressed in our pajamas, having missed breakfast and looking forward to three hours of pasta-making.

Misty S said looking at all the food made her hungry.

Well, yeah.

Saying that Tammie Coe doesn't make you hungry is like saying Bandaids doesn't bring you deep, deep shame.

So along with the gift certificate we got two chicken salad sliders, a peach tea, iced chai, and one of those giant chocolate chip cookies I like to call "diabetes frisbees".

The sliders were all kinds of delicious. Even my veg-leaning squeeze thought so. And considering the prices at other places in the area, you're not going to beat a $2 sandwich. Unless you rob the place.

Would a yelp review count as evidence in court? 

"Your honor, I present to you Exhibit Y, where the defendant  writes 'and as I walked out of the restaurant, money in hand, the cowering hostess muttered to me 'thank you for coming, have a nice day'. Three stars for outstanding hospitality." 

The peach tea was, as expected, great. I almost wish someone would find a way to fuck up peach tea so I could judge how good all this tea I've been drinking really is. The few sips I had of Misty's iced chai latte were above and beyond Starbucks quality. 

But then again, what isn't?

"Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights"

I know this song is a little old, but I hope you get the picture.  I heard good things from my Vegas promoter friends at Galavantier, but not so good things from a personal friend, so I said WTH!!!  I am always game to check out a new club in Vegas!!!

Light is located towards the rear of the Mandalay Bay Hotel.  I believe there used to be another club here, but I forget the name because I rarely venture away from the strip (Mandalay is pretty far south for me!).  We bypassed GP (general population) via Galavantier (please see my review).  It was well worth the extra $.  We heard peeps wait 3 hours to get in this club.  FTS!!! (F*ck That $hit!!!).

Krewella was playing the Fri night we went, and the standard Cirque du Soleil show was entertaining.  However, not as entertaining as the talent!!!  There were many fine looking ladies that my friend and I would have loved to meet given the opportunity.  We had nearly given up when we met a pair of Azn ladies at the bar.  I don't usually talk to Azn ladies much (primarily because they rarely talk to me, and I had a bad experience recently w/ two Azn ladies:  They were the wrong kinda F's:  Fliar [F*cking Liar] & a Flake [Fulla Lame A$$ Kine Excuses]).  But these Azn ladies were the right kinda F's:   Fwhiiiiine, Friendly & Fun!!!  The one I liked had a shoulder piece tattoo and I complimented her on her artwork.  She asked me if I had any work, so I showed her a pic of my shoulder piece, half sleeve and chest plate.  She liked my work so much that she asked me to open up my buttons to see.  I am not usually an exhibitionist, but we weren't getting any love so I threw caution to the wind and said OK!!!  At this point in time I was waiting for her to tell me she was a pro, and she cost $$$ much, but it never happened.  Turns out these women were the good kind of pros:  "Professionals" just like us, who love to party and to top it off they were from LA!!!

We spent the rest of the evening with these ladies because they were not ratchets (we bought each other drinks at their insistence), and they could carry on intelligent conversations.  Afterwards, we grabbed an early morning breakfast.  Lastly, we also agreed to meet up in LA soon.  I guess I should stop being so judgmental of Azn ladies.  These hawt Azn ladies helped me see the "Light"! - LMAO!!!

The owner greeted me at my car door with a giant umbrella to escort me inside the restaurant while it was raining...

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! 

Georgie S. wasn't kidding when she said this place is a fantastic establishment. Its totally in a shitty strip mall and from the outside looks like an old greasy diner, but let me tell you friends, looks can certainly be deceiving, and in this instance, they totally 100% completely are. 

I visited last Sunday on the rainiest day in the universe. The first thing I saw when I walked in was a bowl of Jelly Bellys, and if you know anything about me, you know I love me some jelly beans. Spoon full for me, Handful for you. We asked for a booth, so they quickly got one ready and seated us, all the while shooting the shit and laughing with us about something or other. 

They have this whole New York theme going which made me happy reminiscing on my days living in the city. Sports memorabilia, license plates, photos and everything else you can think of that represents The Empire State were hanging or scattered around. The menu is out of this world. $3 mimosa's & BM's.. full bar, everything from Hot Dogs to Breakfast Burritos to Turkey Subs to Philly cheese steaks and so on and so on.. a little piece of everything you'd find from a street vendor in NYC.. and that by no means is a shot at their food. New York City vendors sell some of the most delicious culinary creations in the universe. 

Our waiter was super attentive and of course, I asked him what his favorite thing was. Bam. The Philly Cheese Steak, so I order one. This bitch of a sandwich was HUGE. It was like a Philly Cheese mountain, and holy cheesy steaky mushroomy oniony Batman it was delicious. Georgie S. was clearly being a fat kid that day and proceeded to order 4 things. Chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, a hot dog and, dammit, I don't remember the last thing. The Canadian went with the most boring thing on menu and got bacon and eggs.. But what does he know? Canada is useful only to provide me with furs and I don't even wear that shit anyway, so I guess that means its really good for nothing. (just kidding. (not really)). Everything was tasty and perfect for the hangovers we were all battling. 

This place is nothing fancy and is certainly not crap. I loved everything about it from start to finish, including the bill, which was about $40 for 3 people including 2 drinks each. Not bad Gino's. Not bad at all. See you soon, rain or shine!

Ever since the Bellagio opened up on the Strip, their buffet was generally the best in my eyes.  Though the Paris buffet is arguably just as good from what I remember, I always thought what the Bellagio had to offer was the best overall.  Well, until now that is; move over Bellagio, cuz someone has come along and snatched top billing from you.

Now, don't let the trendy and chic decor distract you...there is some serious food being thrown out here.  While you will might assume it's just the generic sorts of items like salad, Chinese food, sushi, pasta/pizza, and carvery items, there is just so much more to it than that.  Rather, you can find more unique offerings like kalbi (Korean BBQ ribs...surprisingly good!), buns with pork belly, gnocchi, risotto, pork loin, beef stews, flatbreads, truffle potatoes, and even a station to build your own bowl of pho.  Seriously, how many other places can say that?  A pho station!  It'd be better if it were a ramen station, but still impressive enough!

What's really cool about the place though is that it's not your usual sort of buffet where you pile a bunch of food on your plate and then go to town.  Rather, like the rest of the hotel, it feels so refined, with a majority of the food being served in small plates, bowls, and mini-pots.  Think like an individual tapas plate buffet.  Pretty ingenious if you ask me since it's probably better at reducing the amount of food that gets wasted or dumped.

The food alone makes the price worthwhile, but it's even more reasonable when compared to the other buffets on the strip.  Considering the quality and choices, it's not too shabby at $28 a head for lunch (by Vegas buffet standards).  Wicked Spoon has pretty much all you could ask for at a buffet, but I have to admit that the long walk back to the main part of the hotel when you've got a stomach full of food kind of sucks.  In any case, Wicked Spoon is wicked awesome (so cheesy, I know).

It is ALL about the Aromatherapy Scrub & Massage at Imperial Health Spa. But brace yourself, bitches. There's no gentle, relaxing touch involved so if that's your thing, don't even bother reading any more of my review. The hearts and rainbows and jumping unicorns and rose petals are just not the type of things that transpire over at the Korean Spa. So if you're a bad ass like me and you're from the school that whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, do feel free to read on... 

They will scrub you within an inch of your life and elbow the shit out of knots in your back but it's sooo worth it! No pain no gain baby! Brunhilda from Ryan and Sean's Not So Excellent Adventure has nothing on the chicks that work here! If you don't get that reference, don't feel bad. It's just some obscure, cheesy movie that I happen to have acted in so I wouldn't expect you to have any idea what I'm talking about. And if you do get it... I'm impressed! Extra cool points in my book for you!

Come earlier than your appointment time. Like half an hour early minimum. They want you to be human soup with the rest of the nudists that enjoy the facilities here pre-scrub/massage. Oh and jump into that steam room for a few too if you can handle it. I can't take it too long though. I get wayyy too hot! *insert cute boys sending me compliments like "Yeah, that's right, you ARE way too hot!" here*

My suggestion is to come here before an airbrush tanning session. Get all that dead skin off your body and then head over to see Terry over at Bronzed. But actually the ideal thing is to do this the day or two before because they put a bunch of hardcore moisturizer/oil on you which is not good to have on your skin before an airbrush tanning session because it will make it so the tanner doesn't stick and defeat the whole purpose of your doing the scrub in the first place.

They do just about everything that can be done to pamper you here during this treatment. And there are two different options. One's $125 and the other is $150. Only difference between the two is that one is longer than the other. The Aromatherapy Scrub and Massage appointment goes as follows:

Your scrubber/massage lady comes and finds you in the steam room or jacuzzi. You go back with her and get completely nude. She scrubs the hell out of you as you contemplate your escape route and/or start thinking of a way you can start climbing the ceiling. She shows you all the nasty skin she has taken off of you and you're like, "Wow! I guess I definitely needed this! I swear I don't live in a cardboard box under a freeway overpass!" Then she washes you with this pineapple smelling soap and one of those poof things. This is one of my favorite parts of the treatment because the scent is very intense and smells amazing! After that they wash your hair for you and condition it while giving you a bit of a head massage. Then they seat you up and give you some soap for your face and have you go get in the shower while they clean up all your dead skin off the table so everything is nice and clean for the massage portion that is coming up next. After your shower, they hand you a towel and have you lay down on the table face down. Then they dry you off some more and begin the massage. After that they flip you over and massage a little more, then put a mask on your face. While the mask is drying, they massage your neck and shoulders. Then they peel the mask off and that's the end of your aromatherapy scrub and massage treatment. 

All in all it is a great experience that I recommend and partake in often. So if you see me running around naked 'round these parts, don't be surprised. And sorry dudes... it's not co-ed in the naked area although the men do have their own birthday suit section at this spa. No clue what goes on back there so you're on your own there, buddy. To all the ladies out there... Maybe say hi or something if you see me... Or not. Cuz that like might be awkward since we're like naked and stuff. I dunno... I'm pretty easygoing so if you don't mind, I won't. Your call either way, fellow yelpers. 

All I know is this... You will leave here glowing and looking fantastic, feeling like a new woman! This place is the bomb diggity and the sheer number of checkins I have listed above should speak volumes about how much I love this place!

WOW! What a terrific find this place turned out to be.  During our recent trip to Las Vegas, we decided to stay at the Monte Carlo and low and behold this little gem of a coffee shop was right downstairs off the casino floor.  

After a long trip in the day before, including a late night show it was time for a quick pick me up.  We headed downstairs to Samablatte and decided to order a couple of drinks to help wake up a bit along with a couple of pastries for a light breakfast.  The staff here is very friendly and the menu is as diverse as they come for these type of places.  They offer everything from your standard drip coffees to blended drinks, teas, smoothies, pastries, sandwiches etc...

My wife went with the hot mocha and a scone while I opted for the hot white mocha and a apple turnover style pastry.  The drinks were FANTASTIC and definitely hit the spot (although I wish they were a bit bigger or came in multiple sizes).  My wife thought her scone was OK but the apple turnover was really good and filled with lots of apple.  Normally we are not big connoisseurs of the hot drinks but these were really good.  So much so that a return trip was made the next morning prior to our departure back home.

Trip two saw my wife get the same drink again but this time I went with the Penguin Hot Chocolate (White and Milk Chocolates).  This could possible have been the greatest hot chocolate I have ever had if not the best in all mankind, a definite recommendation.  The place has a great vibe to it, plenty of seating (both indoors and out) and is the perfect place to come down and hang out with a laptop and utilize the WiFi (only available on two floors of the Monte Carlo).  We are already missing this place bunches and will definitely be back here again  the next time we are in town.  My only regret is not trying it the day we got in as I would have loved to have tried the blended drinks or the incredible smoothie that was also on the menu.  If you love coffee then try this place out, it;s more than worth the trip.

When it comes to fine dining restaurants Las Vegas can compete with any city. But, what the city lacks (with the exception of Chinatown/Spring Mountain Rd.) is casual, moderately-priced dining spots with excellent food. Hops and Harvest fills that void with Bradley and Bryan Ogden's farm to table concept. 

The James Beard award winning chef and his son have created a menu full of comfort food with inspired and creative touches like the goat cheese stuffed crepe in the bibb lettuce salad and brought back  items from their former restaurant in Caesars Palace like the blue corn muffins and the Maytag bleu cheese souffle.

The short rib nachos are one of my favorite dishes with its great salty and savory flavors. The potato chips do tend to get a little soggy with the sauce  covering them, but the combo of ingredients are so good that the dish won't last long. The pork belly bites are another hit with its sweet and spicy BBQ sauce and cheddar ale sauce. I've tried both the tuna sliders and the crispy chicken sliders and wasn't disappointed either time. The heirloom tomatoes may be a small dish but the combo of tomatoes and bleu cheese was excellent.

The bone-in prime rib eye was slightly overcooked but the seasoning and the zinfandel shallot sauce made up for it. I rarely order meatloaf, but the bacon wrapped version here was good enough to make me want to order it again. I've also tried the crab cake dish, which was pretty good, but the star of that dish was the carrot-fennel slaw. It was so good they should offer that up as one of their sides on the menu.

The butterscotch pudding and the cinnamon sugar donut holes were both good. Each one is large enough for two people to share.

There were only a couple things I wasn't crazy about. The blue corn muffins could have used more salt or something and the polenta bites were bland.

Our server, Jessica, was amazing. Each time I've been back I made a point to request a table in her section.

I was sad to see Bradley Ogden's place in Caesars Palace close a while back, but now I'm glad he's back and serving up some Strip-quality food in a local's setting.

4.5 Stars

This place is like Burning Man...with foie gras!
First caveat: I was heavily medicated on the occasion of my visit to this far-out "social experiment". Maybe that's why I had such a great time...or maybe the place is just cool on its own. All I know for sure is that I was suspended in a wonderfully floaty state of confusion the entire evening, as I was led through a maze of sumptuously decorated rooms full of weird performers doing weird shit, plying me with fabulously sumptuous drinks and dishes. I felt like Alice in Tsarist-era Wonderland, as if at any moment Josephine Baker would pop out of a Victrola and offer me a magic banana with a tag reading "EAT ME." Magnifique!
Second caveat: I could never afford going here myself, but a visiting liberal-elitist New York journalist pal invited me to accompany him on a sort of VIP PR tour. We were heavily schmoozed by PR people...but PR snowjob or not, this place is super fucking cool! 
It's the same vibe as Absinthe - creepy vintage cabaret, with Hieronymous Bosch murals and old telephones and freaky performers being artsy in every corner as you sip craft cocktails and eat "updated" versions of classic, old-school Vegas fare like rack of lamb and beef Wellington. Three times a night, they put on an actual show with acrobats and shit, but you have to buy special tickets for that in addition to dinner and drinks. And then after the last show -- excuse me, "canto"-- the showroom turns into a nightclub...and you can par-taaaay late into the night, if that's your bag.
Since my friend was being schmoozed, it was seen to that our experience was exceptionally fabulous, and to that end we were hosted by a smart young hipster-type in a velveteen jacket and Morrissey glasses, with the most astonishingly earnest stream of P.R.B.S. flowing effortlessly from his mouth all night long. I don't mean to make him sound insincere -- he was amazing in that he was totally earnest about every adjective he used. Words like "mixologist," "craft bitters" and "ice chef" rolled effortlessly and completely irony-free off his gilded tongue, and with every word he spoke I found myself more and more spellbound by his surreal gravitas. Plus, he had the most amazing vocabulary of anyone I've ever met!
Now, it's true that Rose.Rabbit.Lie. is pretentious to a fault -- but somehow, that's part of its charm. As mentioned, it's not for the feint of wallet-- those fabulous craft cocktails will set you back $16 or more apiece...but astonishingly, it's worth it! They were some of the best drinks I've ever tasted -- and I've tasted 'em all! I supposed it helps that they're heavy into bitters, and use my all-time favorite spirit Campari liberally (I had a cocktail containing Campari jelly...!!!)...but drinks aside, the ambiance and atmosphere alone are totally worth ponying up the cash for (you're subsidizing a huge and very attentive staff). The experience really is that fabulous -- the aforementioned ice chef is responsible for carving giant chunks of ice into various shapes, like diamonds (!!!), that sparkle in your cocktail like a Liz Taylor-Richard Burton quaalude-fueled sex-a-thon.
After drinks in the fabulously-appointed "study," we went onto dinner in the dining room. Our gracious host ordered a huge feast of just about one of everything, and it was truly exceptional in the details --- the menus are sealed and stamped with wax, plus there are all manner of weird 1%er tableware accouterments like animal-shaped silverware-rests, filigreed forks and swan-shaped pewter sea-salt dishes with tiny spoons. 
After stuffing ourselves with foie gras, caviar, lobster and champagne, we retired to the showroom to watch the last of the three nightly "cantos" of Vegas Nocturne -- basically, an Absinthe-style sort of burlesque circus about an hour long, after which the showroom turned into a nightclub, and a Sexy Lady DJ came out and played club music while everyone danced. Maybe I'm just jaded, but I found the whole showroom component of the evening boring. The show itself was nothing you can't see elsewhere, and I just felt it wasn't cool/creative/freaky enough to live up to the rest of the place.
If/when I return to Rose.Rabbit.Lie., I plan to dress to the nines and spend the whole night boozing in the Study, with maybe a few small bites here and there to soak up all that Campari. Our host mentioned something about an old-fashioned record player in there, with free-for-all records, so I think it would be much more fun to just get genteelly sloshed while doing the Charleston to Al Jolson or some such, late into the wee hours. Pre-gaming with my medication was great, and psychedelics would also greatly enhance the experience...if one were so inclined. 
Overall, as pretentious and expensive as it is, I am compelled to wholeheartedly recommend Rose.Rabbit.Lie. as one of my favorite new places to party -- I've already made plans, in fact, to come back with some friends next month! See you there!!

From acclaimed Michelin star steakhouses to the trendiest gastropubs, from AYCE buffets to authentic Asian food, Vegas has a ton of restaurants. 

Unfortunately, almost all of these restaurants are not dog-friendly. I even heard that you can't walk dogs on the Strip because they wanted to keep the peddlers and their dogs off Las Vegas Boulevard. 

Therefore, trying to find a dog-friendly restaurant will require you to leave the Strip and head over to the more residential areas of Vegas. Perusing the Yelp app, that is how the wife and I stumbled upon Honey Salt, a glorious restaurant in the Summerlin part of northwest Las Vegas that feels like Palm Springs, CA... complete with wealthy white people and golf courses.

Like morons, we decided to do a late lunch with our four-legged son, Charlie, in the hot desert that encompasses Las Vegas. Blame our stupidity or the fact that we are so used to taking him around with us everywhere in Southern California that we did not realize how fucking hot it gets in Las Vegas. That is why when we arrived at Honey Salt, their spacious patio was empty. However, almost immediately, one of their workers, Mauro, came out and set up a patio umbrella for us to shade us from the hot desert sun. I'm sure he was thinking, stupid tourists! 

As we were waiting for the umbrella to be set up, our mindful server, Louis, brought out a bowl of water filled with ice cubes for Charlie! He even brought out two glasses and a pitcher of ice water for the dumb humans! First impressions go a long way and we were definitely impressed. 

We ended up ordering two of the "Family Favorites" off their lunch menu. The Mary's Free Range Chicken ($15) and the Ahi Tuna Salad ($17). 

The Mary's Free Range Chicken is served with red and white quinoa, beluga lentils, shaved fennel, radish, avocado chunks, and a citrus vinaigrette. While the chicken was very good, the grains definitely stole the show. This hearty conception was delicious and the citrus vinaigrette made it really refreshing. True to their name the citrus vinaigrette provided the "honey" and the grains provided the "salt".

The Ahi Tuna Salad was equally amazing. Yes, the wasabi pea and ginger crusted ahi tuna was great and the baby spinach with cream soy vinaigrette was delicious. However, the real star was the sea beans and julienned Asian pears salad mixed in what was a sesame kind of sauce. This single salad had both "honey" from the sweet Asian pears and "salt" from the sea beans. Freaking awesome.

All in all, the service and the fresh farm-to-table food was really impressive. It's definitely a hidden gem in the Las Vegas desert. Next time the family is in Vegas, we will wait for the sun to go down so that Mauro won't have to break a sweat for us.

* The complimentary Parmesan crisps served with honey butter were very addicting and they have an extensive beer selection.

* Honey Salt is located in the inconspicuous Rampart Commons shopping center with a Chico's, Gap, and Pottery Barn at the northwest corner of Rampart and Charleston. If exiting the Rampart exit off the Summerlin Parkway, the shopping center will be on the right.

* Honey Salt must be doing something right because they will be opening up another restaurant in the Summerlin area!

Let me preface by saying that I know I will catch a lot of criticism for going against the grain here because from what I've seen on Yelp, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon is universally adored. So why three stars? Two things, the service was abysmal and the menu was underwhelming for what you pay for. 

Service (Grade: F)

Our dinner at L'Atelier was a testament to the importance of good, prompt service and conversely how poor service can destroy a generally well-executed meal in terms of cooking. 

They started out well by being very attentive but this was easy enough as we were the absolute first and only party for dinner. However, service got progressively worse as they siphoned off the wait staff to attend to later arriving parties. At a restaurant with the reputation that comes along with being associated with Joel Robuchon, I found it unacceptable that we had to wait hours and hours for our mains, dessert, etc. The coup de grace was that they had to be reminded that our dinner was to celebrate a birthday even though this was expressed in the reservation and had been told to two separate waiters. 

You just can't forget about a birthday dinner party, especially when the restaurant was not particularly swamped that night, just so you can favor other parties. That kind of chosen neglect was inexplicably rude.

Food (Grade: B)

L'Atelier's prix fixe menus are renowned because they give you several options. Some come with supplemental charges of $10 or more but those are generally the options that are better. 

The amuse bouche of foie gras parfait with a port wine reduction and a Parmesan foam was hit or miss. Half of us liked it the other half didn't finish the tiny shot. 

The Les Pates (supp. charge): lobster chunks over orecchiette was probably one of the better mains. On the other hand, the supplemental charge on the Le Veau (veal ravioli) was not worth it as the dish was bland. 

The La Dorade: snapper carpaccio with lemon glaze was probably the best of the appetizers. However, the La Tomate (chilled tomato gazpacho with burratta) was too salty and felt like drinking marinara sauce straight.

If you're opting for the pre-theater prix fixe menu, the roast of the day (8/9/14) was the free range chicken and it was just okay. 

The desserts were of course beautiful to look at but were not especially noteworthy in terms of flavor. 

Overall, I was expecting something on par with a restaurant like Providence which also has comparably priced prix fixe menus. However, L'Atelier was underwhelming throughout. There are some good dishes but many were weighed down by bad service. Even without considering the service, the food itself did not meet the high expectations and I don't think that was for lack of choosing the "right" dishes. We asked our waiter for suggestions and with four in our party we were able to try a broad swath of dishes. Nevertheless, I wouldn't be able to in good faith give a good review because like one in our party said: "you don't pay a lot to get ignored."

Pizzeria Bianco isn't just a restaurant, it's an institution.  Ever since I moved to the Valley of the Sun five years ago, I've watched peoples' eyes glaze over as they ramble on and on about how amazing the food is there; many argue that it serves up the best pizza in Phoenix (if not the country).  Why it took me so long to get there is a mystery but after going today, I can unequivocally say that the rumors are all true - it is fabulous!

LOGISTICS: Nestled in the Southeast corner of Heritage Square near the Arizona Science Center, Pizzeria Bianco sits in a rather small brick building with an outdoor patio and charming little bar.  While the space restriction makes for a more intimate dining experience, I could easily see this place becoming swarmed with diners during peak hours; so perhaps coming before or after the main lunch/dinner rush would be a good idea for those who are patience-challenged or in a time crunch.  Park in the structure off of 5th and Monroe - the restaurant validates your ticket (I ended up paying $0 instead of the usual $12).  

FOOD: Wow!  Just wow!  I ordered the Market Salad, which consisted of fresh local cantaloupe and honeydew melon, cucumbers, mint, red onions, and peppers served in a yogurt dressing; it was hands-down one of the most creative and refreshing salads I've ever had!  They serve their sodas in old fashioned glass bottles and bring freshly-baked bread with olive oil to your table - haven't had olive oil that good in ages!  If you can't decide on one pizza combo, they're great about doing halfsies.  I ordered a half Margherita, half Rosa (red onion, parmigiano reggiano, rosemary, and Arizona pistachios) pizza - both were sheer perfection!  Crust is heavenly, ingredients are beyond fresh, innovative toppings - who'dve thunk pistachios would taste so good on a pizza?!      

SERVICE: Pizzeria Bianco runs like a well-oiled machine.  The service staff is amazing - both friendly and fast.  They greet every single guest who comes and goes - pretty impressive! 

I don't really think you can go wrong here.  I came in skeptical but left a believer; somehow they worked their magic over on me - another happy Pizzeria Bianco customer.  A thousand flies can't be wrong!  ;)

With the exception of a check-in snafu caused by the very "green" & inexperieced hostess, I'd have to say I had a pretty good experience at the tea lounge at the Mandarin Oriental.  I just have one point of advice, check your reservation with the hostess at least three times. By then, it may sink in for her.

Ok, let's carry on shall we?

Located adjacent to registration above the 23rd floor, you'd think the Tea Lounge was part of the lobby. But make no mistake, these premium seats come at a lofty price tag and a reservation to boot.  

Luckily, we were seated by the panoramic window as I requested and service, albeit a bit slow, was paced nicely and lent to the whole relaxing afternoon tea experience.  With that in mind, the tea selection was fairly limited but adequate for my needs. There were a host of green teas and herbal teas to accommodate most individual preferences and tastes IMO. Since I just arrived from a massage session, I went with the introspective herbal relaxation tea. The tea service runs from 2-5 pm daily and reservations are highly recommended as there are only a few tables in the lounge.  The views can be quite spectacular if you're seated by the window. We had a perfect view of the strip and City Center and the natural lighting was equally relaxing and calming.  

The food selections included a selection of finger sandwiches inspired by English afternoon "high tea" traditions, but where was the cucumber cream cheese?
In any case, the selections included a savory smoked salmon cucumber and watercress spread sandwich (my favorite of the bunch) egg salad & chives on brioche, curried chicken salad, and black forest ham. The tea service also included the best scones I've ever had in my life! These were buttery, light, flaky and irresistibly good. They came out nice and warm, served with some fresh berry jam, marmalade and an imported Devonshire clotted cream (extremely smooth and very addictive.) So addictive, in fact,  I found myself wanting to spread it on practically everything!  
Lastly, our afternoon tea service was completed with a selection of small bite sized desserts and pastries, which included macarons, tarts and chocolates.

By the end of the meal, I felt nicely sated and totally relaxed. I would definitely return on my next trip to Vegas but im going to have to put that hostess on check!

Happy Eats!

Well My Friend, this is a great place to dine at.  It was our last night in Vegas and wanted to dine someplace where we could people watch on the strip.  So after trying to decide between 2 places we went with Mon Ami Gabi.  Since we didn't have reservation and we wanted to sit out on the patio the wait was over an hour.  

We were seated towards the corner and was soon greeted by our waiter Scott.  He was all smiles kinda reminded me of Marc Anthony.  Very friendly and helpful in trying to decide on what to order as he shared the recomendations.

Started off with some drinks and got 2 appetizers.  

Sea scallops gratinees ~ was broiled to yummygoodness I could have easily eaten 2 plated of these.  

Mussels Mariniere ~ Cooked in white wine with slithers of garlic.  They were very good.  

Scallop potato and green beans that came with the Prime rib was very addicting.  The scallop potatoes had a pretty good garlic flavor throughout it was really good. 

Prime Rib ~ This was one huge honker of a prime rib.  Cooked perfectly to a medium rare.  It was juicy and tender.  Mmmm Meat!

Skate Wing ~ One thing I always order when its on the menu.  If you have never had one its like the best of crab, lobster and fish.  Its sooo damn good.  I could have eaten 2 of these things.  Its very lightly pan fried and served with pureed cauliflower.  

After pigging out we needed to settle out tummy so as all reasonably sound person would do we ordered some cappuccino and dessert.

Bananas Foster Crepe ~ It wasn't like the bananas fosters you get in New Orleans but it had the right flavor.  It was very good and with the tasty cup of cappuccino it was the perfect end to a great visit in Vegas.

Eyes ~ Great place to people watch and catch the show of the Bellagio fountains.
Nose ~ Smelling like its gonna be a great dinner!
Ear ~ Its a typical dinner time vibe!
Mouth ~ Really tasty good stuff!
Tummy ~ Everything was tasty good and was totally satisfied!

We got in around 7 pm into Las  Vegas, everyone was hungry. We didn't want to go to a buffet. We wanted something simple, since we had a bunch of kids with us. When we checked in at the resort, they gave us a menu for Rosati's Pizza. It even had some family value coupons and they deliver. Spaghetti, Pizza & Wings it is then. 

The coupon "Family Pasta Special" ($25.99) was for (1) Family Spaghetti or Mostaccioli, (4) Bread Sticks, (6) Meatballs & a 2 litter soda. We chose the spaghetti w/ meat sauce. When they say "family" they mean big, large as in a full tray of spaghetti. That was not what I expected. And it was very very good. The bread stick was garlicky, also good. The meatballs were delicious. (A must order) Matched well with the spaghetti. Highly recommend this deal. 

Like I said, I didn't expect the special to be so much food, so I ordered more. 

Hawaiian Luau Pizza, Canadian Bacon & Pineapple. This was just okay for me. The kids loved it though. 

Buffalo Wings (24 pcs) Delicious. Fried to perfection. The sauce was not too vinegary (the way I like it) I could not stop eating them. Yummy!!

Fettuccine Alfredo was also a hit. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was creamy without being too rich. Delicious 

Service was good. From the lady taking the order to the gentlemen who delivered it. Even got a courtesy phone call to tell me he was parking (it's hard to find parking where I'm staying) I appreciated that 

It was a very good Family dinner. Everything tasted delicious and getting a lot of food was a pleasant surprise. 
I'll definitely be back.

Homigosh, The Buffet at the Wynn only has 950 yelp reviews? That must be some sort of Yelp record, no?

My friends and I decided to buffet dine at the Wynn since it was our last day in LV together. While all of us were sleep deprived, some were slightly hungover or depressed about not winning big! It didn't matter as we were so excited to eat at this famous buffet.

All I have to say is that this buffet is one of THE best ever. It's worth the wait (as I waited about an hour) and price ($40+) Lunch. Oh, and did I mention bottomless mimosas too for just a few extra bucks?

Look at what the main dining area looks like. Isn't it just simply gorgeous? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=A9lwzLYMlhlQkXyHs611DA

The food is absolutely amazing, as there are sections for breakfast, seafood, and other ethnic foods like Italian, Japanese, Chinese, etc.,
The presentation of the food was absolutely wonderful, and the chefs were hard at work always putting fresh and hot new trays of the highest quality dishes.

Everything I put on my multiple plates (from the eggs benedict, bacon, pasta, grilled fish, mashed potatoes, etc.,) was absolutely outstanding and delish. There wasn't one thing that I didn't enjoy eating. I died and went to heaven when I saw the dessert area. I couldn't stop saying "OH MYLANTA" with all of the cookies, pastries, cakes, and gelato galore. My fav was the pecan pie with a thin layer of chocolate inside the crust and the gelato. Num!
Here are a couple of pics - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=phkc9wlQM4f2D2__GDS87A
Beautiful Gelato and toppings
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=ikMzLsgFM-ipeCq1rsVY0A

The Buffet at the Wynn is definitely a Wynner! Special thanks to Janice C for this awesome suggestion (and even Plan A, which I'll go to another time). This was a memorable lunch buffet with my pals, and cannot wait to go back!

It's hard to look at life the same way after you've stayed at the Skylofts. We're talking about two story lofts, unbelievably luxurious amenities, just gorgeous designs at every corner, and being able to get anything you want or need with just one phone call.

Everyone here leaves a 5 star review because it's true, the Skylofts give you a true 5 star feeling. At $10,000 a night, it better! Now, keep in mind, I didn't pay that fee. I simply know somebody who gets sponsored by MGM Grand and he extended his generosity to me. Some reviewers claim the Skylofts are worth every penny. Well, even my friend would say that if he had to pay the full fee, it would NOT be worth every penny. If you could have an incredible double suite at Caesar's Palace for $800, who wouldn't do that instead of spending 10 grand?

Like most people who dine at The French Laundry, post the picture of their bill in a very braggadocious manner, and claim it's worth every penny, they usually don't genuinely mean it. Instead, what they're really saying is, "This was insanely expensive and very possibly overpriced. In an attempt to make myself feel better, I will act as if I paid for this comfortably and without a shred of regret, as if my experience was so moving that I would do this as often as financially possible. Here, please act as if you care about this picture of the tab any more than I would care if you posted one. Envy me. Please, envy me. It'll give me the validation I need." 

Now, before I sound too cynical, I should note that I don't mind people who live flashy lives, so long as they earned their possessions from their own work. Hey, if that's what makes you happy, I'm happy. Just try not to unnecessarily rub it in my face. Now, I'll reiterate that there's so much to love at the Skylofts. We're talking private elevators, pool tables, movie rooms, the best personal service, access to private restaurants, and anything you'd expect if you were part of the 1%. There's a reason I got disillusioned and materialistic from Vegas. And, quite surprisingly, the Skylofts was not a huge part of that. It was more from the food destinations, the overall treatment, and the carefree spending of money that left a real impression. In other words, it was the people I was with and their behaviors that impacted me the most, not a physical place. Would I pay $10,000 a night for a Skyloft? Hell no. But was it one of the best experiences of my life? Hell yes. 

To having great friends. And hopefully enjoying life's great experiences without getting too ripped off. After all, I still want to dine at The French Laundry. But I doubt I'll pay for the preposterous $150 corkage fee.

Pink Himalayan salt, portobello mushroom fries with aioli, marble flooring...am I at Bottega Louie in L.A.? This place seem all too familiar thanks to Chef Sam Marvin who's behind both Bottega Louie and Echo & Rig. I'm so happy I could eat portobello fries whenever I please now.

Located in suite #120 in Tivoli Village. Across from Brio and Barton gym where there's a roundabout for valet. The only signage you'll find are carcass hanging and pig heads. This is afterall a butcher shop and a steakhouse. You can also buy Terra Blue chips, sauces from here aside from meats.

Our server, Brian was terrific. Great personality and knew the menu inside and out. He informed us that they currently have 3 dessert sundaes: applie pie, mixed berry shortcake and salted caramel. But that they would eventually have 12. He also told us that the 3 top-selling appetizers are octopus, portobello fries (of course!) and tomato watermelon and cucumber. Our busser, Shawn, also did a great job. Our tables were cleared immediately and our drinks were not even half empty and we'd already get another glass of whatever we're drinking.

For our appetizers, we got fried chicken, oyster sliders, portobello fries and grilled octopus. For steaks we had hanger (with Bearnaise), rib eye cap (with blue cheese) and filet mignon (with chimichurri) - all come with homemade garlic chips and mushroom Rockefeller. The sauces were excellent. We got a side of garlic mashed potatoes anyway. For dessert, we tried apple pie sundae and salted caramel sundae.

Fried Chicken:
Crispy fried chicken skin (not breaded), meat was tender and juicy, and the sauce reminds me of Korean fried chicken...the one with sweet brown sauce. 5/5

Portobello Fries:
Breaded and fried strips of portobello sprinkled with parmesan cheese and parsley. Comes with the most wonderful aioli for dipping. One of the reasons I go to Bottega Louie and now they're here. Love it love it love it! 5/5

Grilled Octopus:
Tender grilled pieces of octopus with gigante beans in garlic and green olive vinaigrette. The vinaigrette gives acidity to the perfectly-charred octopus. 5/5

Filet Mignon:
Simply seasoned grass-fed natural beef. This is my favorite cut since I'm not a fan of animal fat (except for pork belly and bacon) and as usual, cooked medium-rare. I got chimichurri to go with it but honestly, the steak doesn't need sauce. 5/5

Apple Pie Sundae:
Vanilla ice cream, half a cookie, apple pie pieces and caramel. 5/5

Salted Caramel Sundae:
Vanilla and coffee ice cream, candied peanuts, toffee bits and salted caramel. 4/5

The prices are totally reasonable. $35 for a good piece of steak? Oh, c'mon! For everything we ate, we only spent $160. We also got a complimentary bowl of cauliflower with chili. The only thing missing is macarons. Bottega Louie does have the best macarons in this country that isn't Laduree. So, when the day comes they start to carry macarons here, I've no reason to go back to L.A.!

This is the Pho restaurant that most of the Japanese people in town recommend, so I decided to try it out a few months ago and now my coworkers and I meet here regularly. 

I've noticed at 2am some nights when I'm driving by Pho Sing Sing, that the lights in the kitchen are still on and someone is preparing the broth for the pho. The manager of this restaurant informed me that there is always someone around to make sure the broth is perfectly supervised. Special attention is put into the broth at Sing Sing, the type of attention that the other Pho restaurants neglect due to various reasons I will explain later. The heat that the broth is boiled in must be at a specific temperature or the taste will deviate. Sing Sing prides themselves on consistency, and makes sure that during the cooking process, the heat never exceeds or falls below the standard which produces the most quality broth. For a more bold taste, the bones still have the meat on them when boiled along with various spices such as Saigon cinnamon, ginger, and a particular secret spice recipe that Sing Sing has developed. This method of intense cooking removes any reason to put MSG into the broth. The reason why all the other pho places(most particularly Pho So 1 and Kim Long) pack their broth with MSG is because they absolutely have to in order to serve the gigantic crowds that rush in 24 hours a day. Yes, because the 24 hour Pho restaurants never close, they need to rush the cooking process or they will run out of broth. This is the reason the Pho usually tastes very weak, and to mask some of that weak taste they use MSG. Pho Sing Sing absolutely does not use MSG. But, who cares about that...Japan has used more MSG(Ajinomoto) than any other country in the world and they also happen to have one of the lowest cancer rates in the world, and they live longer than Westerners. There actually has never been any study that proves that MSG is detrimental to an individual's health. But regardless, Sing Sing does not use it at all due to the reasons I mentioned. 

They serve oxtail here but you gotta come early because they sell out. The oxtail is boiled for over 20 hours, so the meat literally falls of the bone. They also give you a ton of steamed onions with it. There is nothing else like oxtail with srirachi, hoisin, and onions with your pho. 

The reason why Pho comes out in less than 5 minutes at other restaurants like Pho Kim Long is because it's cooked ahead of time. That's also why all the noodles stick together. The reason why it takes a longer time here is because they cook the noodles when you order it, just like at Ramen-Yas. What I like the best about the noodles at Sing Sing is the medium-firmness from being cooked at the moment before serving. 

Pho Sing Sing is the only Pho restaurant I have ever been to that actually has good service, or even service at all. I love Pho Little Saigon but after the server brings you your Pho, you never see another living person again. Same sh!t goes on at Kim Long and especially at Pho So 1. 

By reading yelp reviews, it's hard to determine which Pho restaurant to go to. Like I mentioned in my "Pho Saigon" review, there is a "PHO WAR" going on between Vietnamese restaurant owners who sabotage each other's businesses with fake reviews. Also, other races of Asians tend to be ignorant of each other's cuisine. For example, Many Chinese and Koreans will complain that Miso Ramen is too salty, and Shoyu ramen is not salty enough. They don't realize that in Japan, Miso is meant to be extra salty, and Shoyu is meant to have a subtle flavor.   What I am trying to say is that every single Pho restaurant on LV yelp has a very low rating(3 stars), but that is not a reflection on how good the places really are for various reasons.

I actually got to attend the pre pre-show party on the 26th, which was more commonly known as the event that was supposed to be two hours long, around 1,000 people showed up, and not many got in.  The fact that I did feels nothing short of a miracle.  From what I gathered, the Facebook invite got leaked, so they got way overbooked, and just couldn't handle the traffic flow.  So a lot of people didn't get in, and a lot of people (understandably) weren't happy.  How that's going to affect the initial impression remains to be seen.

Conceptually, this place is very clever.  Simply put: I like theme bars and restaurants.  I still mourn the demise of the Star Trek Experience as it was just great fun, and nothing really has replaced it.

Goretorium is a year-round haunted house attraction with a bar.  All those places that pop up this time of year with mazes and blood and people jumping out at you?  This is a 365 day a year version of that.

Being the pre-opening, and considering the awkward crowd control, I don't think the place was 100% operational, so it's hard to critique in some ways.  The downstairs bar wasn't open, and it's hard to say if the upstairs bar is accessible to the general public, or just a bonus for the end of the horror experience.

As far as costumes go, they have some GREAT ghouls.  Zombies, mad scientists, magicians, and even "Bloody Mary" was really cool.  I've worked a few horror gigs over the years, and I was trying to figure out some of the special effects.  I'd like to see how they interact with the crowd under a "normal" day.

The maze was well done.  Plenty of lead up, a couple of nice jumps, lots of blood and trickery.  My friend accidentally walked into a wrong door (I followed, naturally my luck), and it led into a cast holding area.  Oops.  But they held in character, and they teased when we went down the "right" path.  I won't spoil the haunt itself as that's half the fun, but the end of the experience leads hapless wanderers into an upper level bar area with a nice view of the Strip.  They even have a unisex bathroom, so if you walk in, and something doesn't seem right, it actually is.  Someone could have warned me, though.  I had that initial "Oh, crap.  Wrong bathroom" moment, and I couldn't even excuse the mishap on too much liquor.

There were a few things I'd make note of.  I think $40 is simply too high a price to charge for the attraction, especially with the economy still being so "meh" right now.  $30?  I could better see that.  Locals discounts?  I'd strongly consider that, otherwise they are going to have to cater exclusively to tourists because unless you love horror, and I mean LOVE horror, the experience is fun, but a one time deal.  Especially for the price.

The gift shop wasn't much to look at, either.  Not a varied or wide selection, though it looked like they were selling prop surgical tools.

It's unfortunate that Goretorium seemed to have such a rough first night, and hopefully the bad taste will leave people's mouths so they give the place a chance later when it gets some kinks worked out.  I stayed out of all the "political" aspects, and as a customer, I had fun with my group of friends.

Goretorium has potential, and I love wacky theme bars, but the prices shouldn't be the scariest thing there.

Perhaps it was a bad night or the fact that I ran into an old fling while dining out with the in-laws [awkward!] but I just didn't see or taste the magic that all my Yelper buddies had!  Maybe it was also because in my head, I was expecting Vegas quality but this is just a small casino in Arizona.  Get real, Joyce W.!  :(

We arrived at 6ish for a Saturday Dinner Buffet.  I believe it was $14/pp but I'm not entirely sure since my MIL picked up the bill.  They had NY Strip, oysters both raw and fried, king crab legs, lobster claws, clams, mussels, tilapia ceviche, a fajita station, pizza, a cheese selection, fruits, salads, Asian stir fry, a very impressive dessert bar, et cetera. 

Sure, the king crab legs were plenty and always stocked full but it was all frozen firm meat.  At one point, my brother-in-law asked someone to heat some up for us because it had ice chunks inside.  The raw oysters were sadly not fresh.  I was telling everyone I was going to down at least a dozen by myself.  Two fishy oysters in, I gave up.  You just can't choke down oysters that can't be pried off their shells.  I also ate one with too much horseradish to try to off-set the weird-taste but all I got was a clear sinus from it.  Whoa!  I heard the NY strip with au ju was pretty decent.  I regret not getting a cut because I was starting to feel like an ice cube from all the cold foods I was eating.  I think the highlight was dessert.  Everything was small and dainty and the serving size was perfect since I wanted to try a little bit of everything.  Give me more creme brulee and I'll be a happy camper.  I even had some sugar-free spumoni in honor of Brett B. and Jasmine F.

All-in-all, it was a decent dinner buffet for $14 with an okay selection.  It's a very clean dining area and the wait staff is friendly and on-point with clearing dishes away.  They keep the glasses filled and the tables stocked with wet napkins.

My fiancee Santi and I came across this tapas-style restaurant on Yelp and decided to swing by for an early dinner. Dcor-wise, the restaurant had a nondescript exterior, sidewalk seating, communal tables, and all-around wooden interior. We were the first to arrive, but eventually the room was filled with small groups, families, and young professionals at every turn.

The Rabbit Rillette ($10) came with a large jar of chilled rabbit and handfuls of crushed pistachio embedded. There was also a side of sweet cherries marinated in thick syrup, and the crisp toasted bread had a nice texture and crunch. Once these ingredients were stacked together, the rabbit was absolutely sensational. There was plenty of meat in the jar to mix easily with a top layer of rabbit fat. The cherry also added an unusual sweet-tart dimension of refinement, and the server was generous to provide additional servings of the toasted bread. I thought the bread could use a smoky flavor to extend the overall experience, but otherwise it was a nice opener that is easy to share. I highly recommend it.

The Lamb Carpaccio ($14) came with thinly sliced raw lamb, corn shoots, raw egg yolk, and salsa verde. The innovative combination had a unique flavor, but our taste buds were able to come to some coherence by the second serving. For the price, the plate could have included more lamb. I also thought the dish needed an additional egg or alternatives such as quail or duck eggs to make the innovation much more compelling. There were also no kicks in the salsa verde, which was another idea that the chef should consider playing with. Otherwise, I enjoy the lifts in the flavors generated by the corn shoots. I really liked this dish, but thought the innovation could take a few more turns and twists. 

The Octopus ($13) was served with two long tentacles stacked on top of a good number of mussels, green garlic, crazy water, and spinach. The octopus was very tender, but a hint of charred smoke would have sent it out of this world. The mussels were excellent with good size, fresh, and very moist. I also enjoyed the spinach, and thought the complex seafood flavors mingled nicely with the use of seawater. Having more seawater to serve as a dip would be a nice idea to consider for the future.

Lastly, the Veal Neck ($21) arrived with miso, carrots, turnips, ramps, and radishes. The carrot was nicely pureed into a sauce that went nicely with the charred turnip. Although the veal was tender and easy to fork off the bone, it also needed more seasoning. Very simply, the taste of miso was absent to help the veal to make a stronger statement. We didn't enjoy this particular dish and weren't able to finish it.

Our server was very knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. He knew the menu inside out, and was prompt to provide new plate settings while he orchestrated the meal. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their Porchetta, Pork Tripe, Pork Belly, and Foie Gras Mousse.

On a recent trip to Sin City, a visit to Serendipity was on the top of my list. I've been to the original NYC location several times, and looked forward to seeing how this west coast location compared to the east coast OG one. My partner in crime for the weekend, Li, had never been to either location, so was more than happy to accompany her. 

Slightly hungover, we needed sustenance before diving into the famous Frozen Hot Chocolate. I was shocked to find out that the wait was only 20 minutes. The interior doesn't quite have the charm and coziness of the NYC location, but is open and spacious. There is also outdoor seating available. The music was an eclectic mix of 80s, 90s, and current tunes, which I appreciate, but the volume was a bit loud for my liking. 

So, we ordered: 
- Cup of Tomato Soup: The flavor and texture were perfect, and one of my best I've ever had. I loved how it was accented with goldfish crackers. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=Hni3DAqO9NXPth8mNsK5eA 

- ABC Burger: Avocado, Brie Cheese burger. Li and I were intrigued with this unique combo, and decided to split this and it was wonderful. Juicy burger and toasty buns, and ginormous portions of avo and brie. This was accompanied by crisp, sweet potato fries. 

- Frozen Hot Chocolate: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eoHdUeQDNgQ6WYEnP2aiRw?select=85Ev04Z-UaQksArEs2ZVNg The grand finale! It didn't disappoint and was super thick and chocolatey. It's better than a chocolate malt/milkshake, as the consistency is icy, yet creamy. This was topped with a huge dollop of whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Talk about choco heaven! Oh Mylanta! We sipped and slurped as much as our stomachs could handle, but failed to finish it. 

Overall, a decent Serendipity experience. Our server wasn't the friendliest nor super attentive. It took some time for my Diet Coke refills, food, and bill  to arrive at our table. Ambiance isn't as quaint and lovely as the NYC location, but it's still fun place to bring your friends and family. Be warned that the prices are a bit high, food portions are large, music is loud, and service can be spotty. There's a lil' retail area for the t-shirts, frozen hot choco packets, etc., Also, unlike the NYC location, there is a take-out window where you can order from a limited menu (some snacks like pretzels, donuts, etc.,as well as frozen hot chocolate) to enjoy in front of the patio tables in front of Caesar's Hotel or to take along while you walk the strip.

Straight out of Cali and family owned. This location was originally built to be a Dunkin' Donuts, but DD never opened. I'm glad Tom's swooped in! You will find a variety of options on the menu here from burgers, tacos, burritos, sandwiches, bacon & eggs, pancakes, steak, pork chops,  fish & chips, salads, smoothies, and Mediterranean & Greek options, and believe it or not much more! They have some pretty good all day specials if you like breakfast.  Seniors 55+ get a free cup of coffee with any breakfast or lunch purchase.

Hubby and I decided to split the "Pastrami Sandwich Combo" priced at $9.59 plus 40 cents for cheese. The combo came with fries and a drink. I also wanted to try the "Zucchini" priced at $3.99 and it came with a side of ranch. The pastrami sandwich was SO good. The bread held up the sandwich well and the mustard and pickles were just right. I know this is something that I will for sure be back for. Good pastrami in Vegas is hard to come by. The fries were excellent. I wasn't actually crazy about the zucchini. The ranch that it came with was a decent size though. They make the onion rings and zucchini from scratch. I want to try the onion rings next time, but will pass on the zucchini again. 

They have a drive-thru if you don't want to eat inside. The burgers are made fresh to order and the steak and chicken is hand trimmed on site. There are a lot of things I want to try here at Tom's so I will be back!

The Mission is a wonderful restaurant located in Old Town Scottsdale and priced accordingly.

We came here this past Friday night around 5;30 or so.  Over drinks and our meal, we keep discussing the term In-elasticity of demand.  That's economics, for how high you can raise prices before consumers will start cutting back.  

You see the food at The Mission is excellent!   It's delicious!  It's outstanding!  But, judging on how they pack them in, the investors who own The Mission, could easily raise prices by 10 or 20%, and no one would blink an eye.

Hopefully, you're not reading my Yelp Reviews for Economics lessons. But to find out about the dining experience and food.  LOL 

Since there is no Happy Hour at The Mission, we were lucky to get a table near the bar.  We ordered the "made at your table" Guacamole for $12.00.  Excellent!  If you do not believe me -- checkout the nearly half dozen photos other Yelpers have posted for this one menu item.  Yes, it's very good.  They cut up one avocado, add a pinch of salt, red onion, half a lime, cilantro, pine nuts and some grated mexican cheese. Creamy texture and yummy.

We ordered a glass of Sangria for $8.00. and a Mohito for $12.00.  Both were very good, though each had too much ice.  We also ordered off the appetizers menu the Chicken Anticuchos for $8.00, and Skirt Steak tacos for $12.00. 

The chicken comes on two skewers, with a very nice tasting mole that dominates.  It's seasoned with raisin, balsamic, sesame ,cocoa and peanuts.  Very nice.  The three small steak tacos were marinated in Tecate and smoked in their back yard. It's the smokey taste that makes the dish unique.  It also comes with green chili salsa, some diced avocado, cilantro and cotija on top.  These too were delicious and hit the spot.  

A shout-out to fellow Yelp'er Pepper T, who coined the term "Petite proteins" in her review.  Nicely said Pepper!  I believe it's nouveau cuisine.

We ordered one more drink before asking for the check.  The damage came to just over $69 including taxes, but before tip.  As I mention in the begining, The Mission gets very crowded and can feel claustrophobic.  It's also dark inside, and at times can be very noisy.

After the show at the Permorming Art Center down the street, we thought about coming back for dessert. But there was about twenty customers waiting outside to be seated.  Maybe next time.  In-elascity of Demand as they say.

The Wynn Hotel and Casino is one of the top hotels in Las Vegas for two reasons. The employees do the little extra things that make you feel special and the place breathes class instead of oozing kitsch. If you're going to spend $30 extra to stay at a hotel in Vegas, the Wynn must be one of the first you check.  

 - The rooms will run you 2 bills and up which is just fine because the amenities and 600+ square feet are worth it when you are wanting a "better" vacation. 
 - Le Reve is a 4-star cirque-style in the water. We sat in the third row, but the circular theater looked like every seat had a great view.
 - I'm not a golfer, but the course looks beautiful. If you can't have a room with a view of the strip, getting one of this course is nice.
 - Lakeside is a nice restaurant to enjoy the Lake of Dreams
 - The Buffet is especially nice for dinner on weekends or holidays.
 - Save money on taxis because the 3 nightclubs (XS, Tryst, and Surrender) at the Wynn & Encore are bumpin!
 - the Esplanades at Wynn has high-end shopping too rich for my wallet, but still a guy can dream, right?
 - The Wynn pool is heated and a true Vegas party pool
 - The Casino is classy. They still will take your money, but in $25-$100 chunks instead of $10-$20 bites.
 - Housekeeping is wonderful. Need something? Ask. Seriously. Be prepared to tip.
 - Even the valet was great as he recommended we just walk instead of ride to the Venetian and then gave us bottle waters for the 5-minute stroll.
 - The worst part of the Wynn is the ever present voice of Steve Wynn telling you how awesome he thinks the hotel is. At some point, he needs to let the property, service, style, and experience speak for itself, but until then we are stuck trying to find a way to change the channel or hit mute.

Even if you don't rake in dough at craps or baccarate, you'll feel like a winner at the Wynn Las Vegas.

I could tell you all the reasons why you shouldn't go here. But what good of a reviewer would I be if I told the Yelp community to stay away because this place is far too amazing and you're not good enough to take part in it. Every food lover who can appreciate the beauty in a piece of raw fish should have the chance to experience what Kabuto has brought to Las Vegas. But good luck trying, there are only 18 seats in the entire restaurant and once word gets out, it ain't gonna be easy to get in.

Kabuto is part of the Mon Restaurant Family (Monta, Goyemon, Sushi Mon) and another development from restaurant stylist Martin Koleff. Martin is a pioneer for authentic Japanese eateries in Las Vegas. And at the sushi bar, I was rubbing elbows with those who were more than familiar with Martin's talents. He even popped in for a brief hello during my meal. 

I was told the Omakase Course ($80) will not be available until after the grand opening. I went with the Nigiri Course ($48) but you can order a la carte if you wish. I was served a pineapple appertif sake, a small cucumber salad with sea snail, and 10 pieces of the best fish I've ever had. You can state your preferences, but I had the chef choose for me. He was actually quite vocal and very friendly! He was conversational and took the time to explain the origin of each fish. The giant clam and bull eye were a couple of my favorites. And the uni with ikura were to die for. After your 10 pieces are served, you have the option of ordering more nigiri or moving on to your handroll. I ordered an additional saba then finished my meal. If you love mackerel. Order it here. I've now found the best saba in Las Vegas.

Dessert is not taken lightly here either.  In a couple of months, a Japanese pastry shop is to join this family of restaurants right next door. You have a few dessert options with the nigiri course--mochi, ice cream, or the strawberry layered crepe I ordered. Before I started eating, the chef busted out his iPhone and showed me a picture of a bunch of rocks. Confused, he explained to me the pastry chef's vision. She created the pink and white layers to resemble the layers of rock and sandstone at Red Rock. It was touching, and very delicious.

To be quite honest, I've never been to Japan. My understanding of Japanese tradition is a smattering of information from the internet and my Japanese-immigrant friends. But even I can tell that authenticity and quality are of the utmost importance here. From the food to the decor, Kabuto lives and breathes culture. Its unlike any sushi "joint" you've ever visited in town. I won't discourage you from visiting this magnificent addition to the Las Vegas community. But if you walk in expecting a baked roll with cream cheese, please, turn around and leave those 18 seats for the rest of us.

Holy Customer Service NIGHTMARE.

WOW. The lack of professionalism the entire staff showed leading up to our reservation followed through to 3 months later when our issue from NYE was not resolved... One word... NIGHTMARE. An all around headache that I would not care to every partake in ever again. 

Please note the actual club itself is gorgeous. However, that doesn't give anyone the right to completely forget any form of customer service. 

LONG story short:
Had a reserved table for NYE.
Arrived at 10:30pm and were given the reserved table for a party of 12 on stage.
11:30pm - removed from the table with no explanation, sent around trying to talk to the managers to figure out what was happening. Did I mention this was NYE and all happening right before the ball drop?
11:50 - told the team of 3 that had handled our reservation was not working the night of. WHO CARES! We had emails and confirmations of the reservation. 
11:55 - the option to get a table that fits 4 behind the stage next to the pool when we had a party of 12. So yes, a table that did not fit our group nor was it anywhere near the DJ booth or dance floor.
Basically learned that someone else offered more money for our table so we were booted. We were told we would receive a refund. It is now 3 months after and we are still waiting on the refund. Atrocious. 

In the last of the 23 emails returned back and forth, this was the closing: "Please let me know if you decide to visit again and I will personally make sure your experience is flawless." BAHAHAHA! Right... because that is what we were told when we made our original reservation for NYE. Did I mention we planned this in September? Yes, 3 months of planning down the drain thanks to greedy club managers and owners. 

Big name DJs? Yes
Bottle Service & VIP? Yes
Huge areas to move around? Yes... however, during the high tourist months, they pack them in. Also, if you are in one spot of the club and have to get to the other side and there are crowds... give yourself 20 minutes. Not even joking. 
Great sound system? Yes
Fun lights and confetti? Yes
**Absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with in any club around the world. TRIPLE YES.**

While in the area, hubby and I decided to stop here for lunch. They have a drive-thru and chairs/tables outside. Their location on Decatur has only a drive-thru and walk-up window (seating outside), but at this location you can walk inside to order and they also have a dining area. I noticed a $14 for $20 yelp deal upon checking in, so I purchased it. The guy who took my order was very nice, but had some issues figuring out the yelp deal. He called the manager and it all got straightened out. 

The portions here are big, so hubby and I shared. We started out with "Fried Mozzarella" priced at $8.69 for the large and side if sauce. These weren't bad at all, but not the best I've tasted either, above average. I've had the "Garlic Romano Fries" from the Decatur location and loved them, so at $4.59 I ordered them with a side a Sammy's Sauce. The fries here were consistent with the ones I had previously, so they tasted great! Next I enjoyed my half of "The L.A. Pastrami" priced at $10.79 for the large. The pastrami was very tender and had good flavor. It also has mustard, pickles and cheese on it. This sandwich even comes in a extra large size! Even their small sizes are fair, so if you get a medium size or larger, it's very possible you could share with someone depending on your appetite. This place is definitely worth giving a try!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 45/100

I had read some amazing reviews about Jean Philippe Patisserie, so I HAD to come here on my recent visit to Vegas this past weekend.

It is located in the Bellagio hotel, just a little bit past the Conservatory & Botanical Gardens. There are signs pointing towards which direction it is located in!

I was actually pretty surprised at how small this place was. I had envisioned to be a full bakery/patisserie with tons of cute little cafe tables/chairs and whatnot, but that wasn't the case. It's like a circular area with the employees/staff all in the middle, and you kinda just walk around the counter to look at all of the pastries, gelato, sandwiches, etc.

One wall has the famous chocolate fountain, which honestly...was not as big as I had pictured. When people said it's the "biggest chocolate fountain in the world" I was thinking like straight up Willy Wonka status. This was totally not the case! Granted, it was a really nice glass display and I really liked that they had dark, milk, and white chocolate pouring in it, but I didn't think it was as mindblowing as I had expected it to be.

Along the circular walls they have a bunch of packaged goodies like chocolates, candies, hot chocolate mix, etc. They also have some fake cakes on display. I'm not sure if they actually bake fancy cakes here, but the displays were nice!

Unfortunately I had just eaten lunch and wasn't hungry at all, so I didn't any of the pastries although I had REALLY wanted to try some of them out! They didn't have a HUGE selection but some of them looked very tasty! I ended up getting a scoop of the dulce de leche gelato ($3+), and the Jean Philippe vanilla hot chocolate mix ($18).

The gelato was ok to me. Presentation wasn't the nicest, and also it was really soft...like to the point where it was basically melting! Gross. I wasn't impressed.

I made the hot chocolate mix when I came home, and I must say, this stuff is INCREDIBLE. It reminds me of the hot chocolate at Churros Calientes in Los Angeles. Super thick, rich, and decadent. omg, it is incredible. I'm glad it turned out well because $18 for only a few cups of hot chocolate was pretty pricey! Even more than Godiva and some other high end chocolate brands.

Overall, I liked Jean Philippe but I wasn't as blown away as I thought I was going to be. I definitely would return to actually try some of their pastries and maybe even their crepes (which are supposed to be amazing). 3 stars!

I purchased a $10 for $20 groupon so we could try this place out for dinner. Upon walking in we were greeted and right away offered a sample of their Huli Huli Chicken and Kalua Pig. Both of these were equally good, but I really loved the Huli Huli Chicken. After reading the menu board I decided to go with the "3 Tacos" with 2 on flour tortillas and 1 on crispy corn. I was torn on which meat to choose for my tacos, so the man behind the counter said I could mix and match them. Cool! I ended up going with chicken, pig and steak tacos and paying the extra $1.35 for guac on them. A lot of places would charge for the guacamole per taco, but I was just charged the 1 price and got a generous portion on all 3 tacos. The tacos were delicious! The charred pineapple verde adds a nice flavor addition, the meat is tender and has great flavor, the tortilla was soft and good and the price was right for what I got. The guacamole is worth buying just as a side to have with chips, but I have to admit that if there was some sort of Hawaiian pink salt in it, I didn't see it or taste anything except for fresh yummy guac. Hubby had a "Pulehu Steak Burrito" and loved it, but found the size to be too small for his hungry appetite. I still had half of a taco left so I was very fulfilled! So full that I didn't even taste a bite of the "Cheese Quesadilla" priced at $2.50 (meat extra) that we also ordered. 

I also had to make room for dessert later because I got a bag of "Coconut Bark" priced at $3.50 to try. Whoa!! This stuff is addicting! I have never had anything like it before and honestly don't even know for sure what all was in it. It seems like a saltine cracker with a layer of brown sugar or caramel and then a layer of chocolate and coconut. Whatever it is, I want more! 

You can eat inside, outside or even grab some grub from their drive-thru.

I hadn't been to this place in over 12 years so I decided to take hubby to try it out and see if it was still any good. There is no drive-thru, this is a small little building where you walk-up and place your order. If there is actual parking for this place someone let me know because it seems people still just pull up along the curb, hop out and order, get their food then roll out. I just figure the parking situation adds adventure to the experience ha! There is seating right outside of the ordering window which is nice, if mother nature is being nice :)

As I walked up to the window I immediately recognized the owner. He is a character for sure! He let me know he was celebrating 18 years in the same location. I told him I had read in the Review Journal a few years back that Celine Dion liked to stop at Hot Dog Heaven for a hot dog on her way home. The owner had an immediate response that had both my husband and myself laughing so hard! I'd repeat what he said, but it might not be appropriate so just trust me it was hilarious or ask yourself next time you stop by! 

So I ordered a "Vienna All Beef Hot Dog" priced at $2.79 on the menu board, but I was charged $2.89 before taxes. It's only 10 cents, but still the prices should be listed correctly. I asked for mine loaded so it came on a poppy seed bun and had a pickle, onions, tomatoes, sport peppers and true green relish. I asked for the celery salt to be left off.  This hot dog was as good as I remembered it. It really is a simple thing yet hits the spot. I also ordered "Chili Cheese Fries" priced at $4.19 and the chili cheese fries only come in one size unlike the plain fries. The chili cheese fries can easily be shared between 2 or more people. The chili is made from scratch and being a Chicago joint there is no beans in the chili. The chili was pretty good, but not as good as Original Tommy's. The fries are nice and fat so they hold up the chili and cheese nicely. Hubby ordered a "Maxwell Street Style Polish Dog" that was priced on the menu at $4 and some change, yet I was charged $5.19 for it before tax. Look, I really don't mind paying whatever you are charging if it is fair, but it needs to be posted correctly or it is just misleading and people will wonder about shadiness. 

They serve Coca-Cola here as well Barq's root beer if that is your thing.

They only take CA$H MONEY for payment, so stop at a bank or have some cash on you because cash is king at this place.

I was debating a 3 or 4 star for this place on my drive home.  I decided this place is certainly over the 3.5 star mark, so 4 star it is.

First, you will find that the Cleaver Koi is on the west side of Central/Lite Rail in a small copper/bronze colored building that has a small breezeway down the middle.  The sign out front is small.  You should turn on/down (don't U turn) Glenrosa St or if you U-turn, be sure to turn into their parking lot at the FIRST left turn (just north of the building) you get to.  If you try that second turn, you will be turning into the wrong parking lot and you will have to circle around on Central and come back again.  Don't ask me how I know this.  But I will say it could be helpful information for those who are not familiar with the area.

Cleaver Koi is a very "neat/cute" space.  I LOVE the ambiance, the look and feel of the restaurant.  It has an atmosphere that is right on par with Central Phoenix, hipster, chic, cool.  I stopped in there today, a Saturday, for lunch. The cleaver Koi has been open about 2 months, so there wasn't a crowd, but the server mentioned that the day before on a Friday, they were completely packed pretty much the entire lunch and dinner service.  So as the masses are finding out about this place, it is filling up like good CenPho restaurants do.

My friend and I ordered a variety of things.  Here's my take on a few of memorable things.

My favorite item was the "Pig Face" dumplings!!!  Amazingly delicious and savory with an appropriate level of spice.  Tender dumplings that practically melt in your mouth. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#TwNmKVIhbSWHQgm22KMfQw

We also tried the following notable things:
Salt and Pepper Shrimp:  worth having again.  I was pleased with the size and amount of this dish.  I would have had that as an entre.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-clever-koi-phoenix?select=mXNzgML9mn7GR0EFTj5Otg#QJLxMqO42DMuun5bZzDsoA

Peking Duck Steamed Bun:  Oh man, the duck is very good!

I will definitely come back here for HH when I get the opportunity.  I originally planned to have the roasted pork ramen, but I ended up ordering the Massaman Noodles.  I was satisfied with it, but I ordered it thinking that the noodles would be in a more brothy/soup-like base.  but this dish is certainly a curry (gravy) texture (as the menu stated) and the dish could be eaten with chopsticks.

Oh, they have the cutest crafted cocktail menu... there's one drink "Hey Bartender"... you tell them the spirit and the flavor choice you like... the bartender creates a drink just for you.  It worked twice for us!  Awesome, loved it.

I have had this place bookmarked for a while and am glad we finally tried it. I felt like deep dish pizza and heard that North End puts out a good one. Walking inside we were greeted and told to sit anywhere. Looking around there were many pictures on the wall of movie posters and different sporting events as well family history of the owner and her family. A lot of Boston decor! The owner, Claudia, was there at a table not only eating, but saying hello to each customer and making sure they were enjoying their food. Claudia has her dad make the pizza dough at his restaurant in Boston, and then ships it to Las Vegas for use here at North End Pizza. Her mom makes the pizza sauce locally from her secret recipe.  

We started out with an order of "Garlic Knots" priced at $6.50 for an order of 12 knots and sauce. These weren't traditional since they were *not* in a *knot*, but more a disc if flavorless dough. With all of the seasoning on them, I didn't get it and would not order them again, knowing where I can get authentic ones at other restaurants in town. 

For the main course I ordered a "1/2 Ricotta & Garlic 1/2 Sausage Pizza" priced at  $22.99 including toppings. I ordered the Sicilian, which requires an hour for prep/bake time. If you know you want this then you can just call ahead and have them start it for you. The Sicilian only comes in 16 inch size. I really enjoyed this pizza! I tasted nothing but garlic on my half so I don't know where the garlic flavor was on the knots? The pizza dough was nice and thick and cooked thoroughly. We had more then enough left to take home for another meal! I want to come back and try their thin crust pizza next.

You can come in and buy pizza by the slice or try out some of their calzones, pasta, salads, sandwiches or appetizers. North End offers delivery/dine-in/carryout. 

Mon thru Sat: 11 am - 9 pm

Consider this Sunday Brunch buffet the Godfather to all buffets in the Valley. If you're like me, you won't quite realize what you're getting yourself into until you've been seated and you make your way into the buffet room. Yes, I said buffet room and I mean that it's an entire room dedicated to the buffet. Here's how it works: you stand in line to enter the restaurant, you pay upfront, you're seated by a hostess and then the feeding frenzy begins. 

Once we were seated, we took a moment to take in our surroundings. I looked to my left, I looked to my right and everywhere I looked, people had food piled (and I mean piled) high on their plates. Had they eaten in weeks or had they just eaten last night? It's hard to tell, but really, it's also hard to blame the gorging-like behavior because the second you see this buffet, an animal instinct triggers in your body and you must attack the buffet as if it is your last meal on this earth. People piled entire meat shops on their plates and then topped it off with heaps of fried Chinese food, cheesy Mexican food, Seafood glory and any pastry, dessert or breakfast dish imaginable. 

For the amount of traffic this buffet gets, the staff, service and structure is spot-on and even with just one person working the register, we got through the initial line pretty quickly. Once we were inside, we were let loose to discover the culinary creations on our own. The buffet room is clean, stocked high with food and organized in a structured way. People pile the food high on their plates and this results in the food disappearing off the serving platters faster than the chef's can put it down. But the chef's aren't phased and keep cooking as fast as they can. There is every type of food imaginable and there's no possible way a human could enjoy everything this buffet has to offer. But it's definitely worth a shot. 

The Sunday Brunch Buffet is $26 for adults but it's absolutely worth it. I was told it's pricier because it's a seafood buffet. It's not your 5 star resort "stuffy" brunch but rather a nice quality casual buffet and probably the nicest one Phoenix has to offer for this price range and quantity. I will be back soon to try out the $9.99 buffet they offer on Saturdays. 

This is absolutely the buffet to check-out in Phoenix. You'll walk away as in awe as I am.

I heard rumors about Karl's Quality Bakery from some of my friends and through other reviews, I just have to try it out. Saturday mornings from 7 to 8 am around the valley seems to be quite lovely; barely any traffic on the roads at all. All you weekend pleasure drivers should give it a try. The drive north on 7th avenue to Dunlap took about 10 minutes, and my head danced towards thoughts of sugarplums... and other sweet treats. I hope they have a good Apple Filled donut!

Arriving this early just about anywhere means you pretty much have the run of the place. There were one or two other customers and the scent of freshly baked goodies was almost overwhelming. I had my eye on the freshly made quiche, which looked awesome, but that's not what I was really here for. I asked the girl at the counter "What's your most popular donut" and I got a list of some of the local favorites; Apple Fritter, a variety of fruit / cheese danish, a few different cream filled goodies. MMMM... what a way to start your Saturday! Unfortunately no Apple Filled donut, but the Apple Danish looked like a pretty good alternative.

Mental note: Next time bring cash, $10 minimum order with credit cards. We ended up ordering extras to meet the $10 mark and the thought of bringing home donuts is scary. I know that if I bring baked goods into the house, its leaving one of two ways; me eating it, or my wife eating it. I'm pretty sure we all know how that's gonna turn out. We sat at one of the cafe tables and began sharing. Yes, that thing you were taught when you were two. Sharing is caring!

At the first bite of the Apple Danish I was hooked. In my head I am working out this scheme to convince my wife that it was no good and she wouldn't even like it. Since that probably wouldn't work anyway. I gave in to my selfish desires to finish the danish and shared the other half, with my other half. The Apple Filling was just about perfect.

Thank's for such great pastries and desserts. Happy Yelping Phoenix!

I've been looking forward to coming here since I made plans to go to Las Vegas a couple of months ago. Since I've been waiting for so long, my expectation has been building up so high. When I get to the restaurant it's anti-climactic. Not today, Not here. 

You can smell the burgers from the parking lot. If the smell is half what it taste like, I was going to be happy. It was and more. 

We got here at 3pm on A Thursday, only a few customers were present. We got seated immediately. 

Here's the rundown:
Grilled Kurobuta & Arabiki Sausage - delicious, almost like a JapaDog but skinnier and smaller. It was served with some whole grain honey mustard, perfect pairing. Yum!!

Pork Belly Steamed Buns - OMG Delicious. You get 3 per order. The steamed bun was airy. The pork belly was melt in your mouth goodness. Hoisin sauce made for a perfect little bite. My only quibble would be the boiled egg, which didn't add anything to the dish. A sunny side up quail egg would have been just over the top good on this, but that's just my take on it. It's still a very very good dish. 

Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - another winner. A huge portion of perfectly cooked fries (crunchy outside, soft inside) topped with Garlic Aioli, Stewed Oxtail and a Fried Egg. The oxtail by itself was so good, but adding everything else was just superb. Must order for sure. 

Shogun Burger - talk about a decadent burger. The burger is made with Wagyu Beef topped with Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach & Arugula. It was salty, sweet, bitter, peppery, savory deliciousness. Is this what they call "Umami" if not I have a word for it "Delicious!!" It's got a hefty price tag, but well worth it. 

My son had the Grilled Cheese w/ Fries, Carrots and Apple. It was served with a Barnaise sauce on the side. My son is a picky eater, but he devoured that grilled cheese. The adults devoured that barnaise sauce, oh so good. Anything with that sauce would be good. 

Usually reality out performs our expectations, not in this case. Reality out performed my expectations and it was high to begin with. Incredible meal. 

5 Star Plus
I'll definitely be back.

Can we say over hyped? Being a Las Vegas Local, may seem like I am being biased or sensitive on reviews, but just being at SLS will speak for it self. They spent so much money on advertising, hyping up the new resort by renovating a classic landmark casino in which was once called Sahara hotel.  Sadly with all the renovations or what has become, it sadly failed to deliver in giving honor to a classic Vegas time piece and destination.  Times have changed and obviously what goes up, must come down...but what gets rebuilt shouldn't always be the case.  This is what you get when you come to the SLS. 

Owned by SBE entertainment and known for their posh boutique luxury style and offering...the SLS is anything but that.  In the capital city of entertainment destination around the world, the kind of grand opening that the SLS delivered was more of a 99 cents store opening up at a local ghetto. (With all due respect...I do shop at 99 cents store) but to get to the point of their grand opening is that, why open up shop when you are not ready?!?  

Their carpets were all filled with wood and construction debris, the concrete pavement which was painted white were full of grease marks and over spray and was rather unpleasant. It reminded me of walking into  a model home being constructed.  

Now the concept is nice and in some cases, some decor was actually modern and intriguing but it leaves you with a feeling of emptiness and questions yourself..."that's it?!?"  I'm not sure what the interior decorator or designer was going through but in my opinion and point of view, as if they were going for a mix of modern and vintage at the same time, rather than being contemporary.  There was too much going on yet too little of it going on. (Confusing right?...that's what it is confusing!)

We all know casinos don't have windows and clocks for a reason, but the ambience is pretty dark and gothic like. Lighting was a fail...common this is Vegas...not a Seattle grunge night club. It may be good for those who rock ED Hardy or are into twilight (no offense again I've watched the whole twilight series) but check out the ceilings. It looks like you are entering a consignment warehouse. Even with SLS being crowded due to grand opening, I managed to walk the whole casino floor premises in a boring 15 minutes. 

SLS does offer some interesting restaurants and clubs but nothing on par with what MGM/WYNN offers in house.  Prices on some of the upscale restaurants are not worth paying (unless you have cash to blow and don't give a $&@!) I'd rather take my business elsewhere. 

And what's up with the parking lot/valet/taxi staging area/entrance? Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles could design a much better traffic flowing concept. This parking concept is literally an accident waiting to happen. My advice is be careful if you plan to visit and park. I suggest parking yourself instead if valet at least until they get their stuff together and that's if they do.  

I really do hope SLS succeeds.  This is my city and I would hate failure to happen, but the way it is going now does not look good.  They need to step it up, otherwise they will lose customers, especially locals. Sahara Hotel was actually more better and even had a nascar cafe with roller coaster. I just hope this isn't the end of it, otherwise it will be the end of it. SLS until you can provide a cleaner, more attractive and on par resort...I won't be coming back anytime soon. For that matter, I may not come back at all. 

1 star rating does not even do justice. If I could this rating would be negative.  So sad.

Happy Hour Review:

We came for the Tempe Arts Fair,http://www.yelp.com/biz/tempe-arts-festival-tempe#hrid:mFf-pIdZ8gGArDYHL4-YgA  but decided to checkout the Happy Hour at La Bocca.  For the last three years, this restaurant and it's Chef Julian Wright is all anyone can talk about.  It feels like Phoenix's New Times writes about him at least once a week. LOL 

AMBIANCE:
Mill Avenue continues to change with the times and reinvent itself -- something we like!  We chose to sit outside and people watch since it was still early.  Inside the restaurant has a modern 1940s feel which is really very nice.

CLIENTELE:
Here's an interesting category.  Mill Avenue and the restaurants are a mixture of older college kids from ASU (21+), along with Alumni of all ages.  You also have people like us who just like the vibe of the area.

MENU:
They've made some changes in their Happy Hour menu, but everything is still excellent! Most items from the bar are $3.00 during HH, that also includes shots.  So it really is a watering hole. We really like their Rojo Sangria, and it's a very reasonable at $22.00 for a 750 ml Carafe, btw.
http://laboccapizzeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-WINTER-WINE-LIST.pdf

SERVICE:
Is a tag team affair, but our server Alex was outstanding.  He stayed on top of things and came back to check in from time to time.  When we mentioned Yelp, he told us how customers have written some very nice reviews about the restaurant and one had even mentioned his service.  Well Alex, here's your second nod.  You were great, and we would come back to your section anytime! 

FOOD:
The food at LaBocca is mostly Italian with some tweaks to the concept.  A good example is their Harvest Chop Salad for $8.00 which we enjoyed.  There's a nominal $2.00 up-charge for the split, but it was subtle and very nice. It had a light Dijon mustard vinaigrette dressing, over tubetti pasta, romaine lettuce, bacon, tomatoes and some blue cheese.  It was delicious and the blue cheese was very mild, almost Gorgonzola-ish.  

Next we had their famous Margarita pizza was $9.00 (see photo). La Bocca is known for their pizzas. It was made with some crushed San Marzano tomatoes and mozzarella.  It also had a rough cut of basil leaves on top.  We liked it a lot, but also enjoy the pizza at Pomo's on Scottsdale Road for the real Neopolitan stuff. 

For dessert we shared each others -- Tiramisu $ 5.00 (photo) and Fresh Mint Chip Ice Cream $6.00.  A nice ending to a wonderful meal.
http://laboccapizzeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/labocca-urban-pizzeria-lunch-dinner-menu.pdf

PRICES:
Our bill came to $52.00 after taxes, but before gratuities.  It would have been less if we kept to the HH wine list but the carafe of Sangria (photo) was too good to pass up.

Enjoy!  We'll be back.

I guess people do really like them on Yelp!

I've had my hair done by the infamous Kim Vo & I don't consider myself fortunate. You couldn't pay me to go back to him. I gave him two chances but he lost me as a client! Not that he cares because Kim is some "big shot" hairdresser (allegedly). But please allow me to explain because YOU REALLY SHOULD NOT GO HERE!

I thought Kim was a nice guy, so it sucks to have to write this, but this is about hair here & I make my money partially based upon how I look. The results of his work has messed with my livelihood & I'm not happy about it! In short, Kim majorly screwed my hair up & this isn't some isolated incident. I'm completely baffled as to why Kim is a so called "celebrity hairdresser" yet THIS doesn't seem to be common knowledge:

"Kim Vo Firestarter" it's appropriately titled... http://gomezhyatt.com/2010-03-22-kim-vo-firestarter/

I wish I'd read all this BEFORE I went to him because if I had, I would have never let him come within 50 ft of my hair! The whole reason why I went to him was his BS marketing about how he's the "best blonder in the business" & how his blonde techniques are actually healthy for your hair. And I'm embarrassed to say that he caught me with his marketing hook, line and sinker. His PR company must be GOOD at burying info because it turns out that Kim is actually also famous for allegedly burning people & frying people's hair off. You can google all of this info yourself or you will hear it from time to time on Chelsea Lately, as apparently he fried her hair hair off too. Luckily I wasn't burned but I had to cut ties because Kim Vo left my hair in the worst shape that it has ever been in my life after only two visits with him. 

Kim does a GREAT job alright... at packing on the clients like an assembly line! The first time I saw him I was amazed at how fast he works. I was happy with my color but I did notice some tiger striping which was also pointed out to me every time I had a blowout. I think "Who did you hair?!" were the exact words my stylist said when she looked at all the bleeding from the foils in the back section that I was unable to see. But stupid me ignored these warning signs & I somehow thought perhaps it was my fault & that maybe I had tapped the foils by accident while under the dryer. And Kim had me roped in with his lil used car salespitch about how I have to give him a good four visits for my hair to be where it should be. So back I went for time #2 at his salon in Vegas at The Palms. I had been noticing that my hair was sticking up straight every morning like I had been sticking my finger in a light socket so I said something to Kim about it thinking that maybe I should cut my hair even shorter because it was obviously still damaged. Kim talked me out of it though. He related a story about how he was having the same issues with his own hair that morning & that it was sticking up because our hair was short & that we didn't have the weight of it being long to weigh it down. His explanation quieted my concerns & I entrusted him with my hair again. After this visit, my hair condition got even worse & then it finally hit me that HE was the one who was messing my hair up! That's when I started reflecting, & think about it, if he can't even get his own hair right, that is NOT a good sign! And the other thing is that I've had short hair before & I never had issues with my hair sticking up straight like it did under his care. So yeah, the length of my hair was not the problem. It was Kim Vo that was the problem. And let me just say, he is FIRED & officially off my Xmas card list! He's actually lucky I'm not waiting for him in a dark alley to show him my wrestling moves & brass knuckle phone case demonstration, LOL!

And now that I'm done with him, it's crazy how many horror stories I've heard about Mr. Vo which lead me to the articles/shows talking about how he (allegedly) burns people & fries hair. And I also heard that he uses some really hardcore bleach on everyone's hair because when he does his little assembly line action it allows him to lift the hair quicker which means mo clients + mo money = win for him. So if these things are true, then to Kim, you are really nothing more than a dollar sign & that pisses me off. The guy doesn't give a flying F#$K about your hair's health & I had to get back on the extension train & spend a lot of $$ to fix what he did. I just wish someone had said something on Yelp &/or this info wasn't buried by PR campaigns because I definitely would have thought twice about going to him. I'm pissed I drove all the way to Beverly Hills to see him the first time & paid a fortune x2, only to have my hair ruined! So that's my story. Maybe you won't have to fry your hair off or ruin it like he's done to me & others (allegedly). It's really a shame because I wanted to like Kim! I just got sucked in to all the hype. If I can save one person from my fate, this review will have been worth it.

All the hot dogs here are Boar's Head, but you can choose skinless or a turkey dog. Walking in there were several employees that greeted us. We chose a table near the window and started looking through the menu. The menu offers a variety of not just hot dogs, but also sausage, burgers, sandwiches, chicken, fish, and salad.  

Given the name, I had to try a hot dog the first time! Priced at $4.59 I ordered the "Philly Griller dog" that had grilled peppers, onion and cheese sauce. Yum! I couldn't even eat the whole thing so half went to hubby who didn't care for the char taste, but I like a good charred dog. The peppers and onions had a great flavor and there was a fair amount of cheese sauce. I also had some "Italian Fries" priced at $4.29 and had my choice of shoestring or crinkle-cut. I chose the shoestring and it was tossed in a garlic butter sauce and topped with parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning. These were good! I asked for a side of ranch to dip them in and the ranch was good. Our server was nice and checked on us often. I do feel the restaurant could be cleaner inside, but there was a good vibe and I'd go back. You can place your order for pick-up as well.

I have reviewed other In-N-Out Burger locations, so it seemed strange I didn't have a review for this location since it is the one I most frequent (at least once a week). Seems more like "creeper fishy" to me, but anyways. This location is my favorite. I have been eating here since it opened and have never once had an issue. Consistency is clearly something In-N-Out Burger focuses on. The inside is always very clean as well the restrooms. The line inside as well the drive-thru can be crazy, but it's worth it. If eating inside it is best to go in with others so you have someone to order and get drinks so the other can scout out a spot to sit. The booths are hard to come by at peak times. The parking can fill up too, but recently they have added orange cones so there isn't as much congestion between the parking area and the drive-thru. 

Everybody pretty much knows the secret menu at In-N-Out Burger isn't so secret anymore. I love that the menu is so simple. When you know how to make something right, you don't need a large menu. Hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries, shakes and drinks are what you will find here! For me this last visit (and pretty much every visit) I had a "Grilled Cheese W/Grilled Onions" (no lettuce) and it was perfect. Sometimes I get extra tomato, extra grilled onions or even ask that they add mustard. I also ordered "Animal Style Fries" and was glad hubby helped me eat them because it was a decent size. The chilies here are good and you can get them chopped on your burger or just on the side to munch on.  If you like to spoil your pooch then order a "Flying Dutchman" for them and they will thank you :)

Izakaya Cocokala's menu reflects a lot of what would be found at a typical street corner izakaya in Japan with a couple of wrinkles from the norm.  I was excited to check it out.  Things were looking even better when I was the only non-Japanese patron in a restaurant 75% full on a Sunday night.  That's always a good sign!  

Shocking me right off the bat was being served cold edamame.  Although typical in other places (like umm..Japan?), I've actually met people who grew up in Vegas thinking edamame was always served hot.  Even I expect it to be hot everytime in LV now for chrissakes.  I could tell this place gave a damn about "keeping it real" just from these itty bitty green things.

My wife was ready to order "bakudan" as soon as we sat down.  She thinks natto (fermented soybeans that smell like the foot of a corpse and taste even worse) is the single greatest culinary contribution from Japan to the world.  Cocokala's version included said item, tuna, okra, yamaimo (mountain potato) and spicy mustard.  Mix everything up and go to town because you're a braver person than I.  She thought this was awesome.  

I didn't expect the grilled saba (mackerel) to be my favorite dish but it totally was.  Nice portioned filet with a terrific char, tender meat and the oil from the fish had me considering another order as soon as I finished.  This went very well with their samurai barley beer which was their strongest brew at 10% alcohol.  

I also had a bottle of their stout brewed with oysters which tasted like you'd expect.....super funky Guinness.  My wife loved their Echigo red ale.  All the premium brews are $9-$10 for a 12 oz bottle.  They also have a nice selection of sake and shochu.      

Their chawanmushi (egg custard) was chockful of seafood deliciousness that rivaled Kyara's version.  I also thought highly of their take on black cod miso.  It's everything you'd expect at a very reasonable price.  

Chicken cartilage skewers were something I missed dearly from my days in Japan.  Usually the cartilage is stripped naked of any meat before it's grilled but I kind of liked it better their way with chicken meat still on it.  Cocokala would become my new best friend if they started serving fried chicken cartilage :)

Some stuff didn't make this visit five stars but they're all things that are correctable and are probably due to being so new.  I thought the white meat yakitori were very dry.  The ume jiso (sour plum sauce) kind of masked the dryness a little but the wasabi yakitori wasn't good.  They mistakenly added a grilled hamachi to our receipt.  And instead of being offered a refill of water, the glasses were simply taken away.  

None of these are very big issues.  I am just happy there's another quality izakaya in town!!

"Bonjour, mon ami.  Lardons, si vous plait"

Located conveniently by the hotel elevators at the Paris Las Vegas hotel, Le Cafe Ile St. Louis offers French American cuisine, specializing in breakfast/brunch.  A cute facade makes diners feel they are in city of lights, with dining inside or "al fresco", which in this case means overlooking the casino floor.  I chose to sit "al fresco" both times I dined here, as it gave ample opportunity to people watch, both those gambling & those walking by, and to enjoy the filtered casino air.  I assumed seating inside would be rather stuffy.

As previously mentioned, I dined at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis on two occasions, for dinner then for breakfast the next day.  Here's the 411-

Dinner - There was very little wait & was quickly led to a table.  While waiting for my order to arrive, crusty bread & butter were placed on our table-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ
By crusty, I mean crusty.  The outer layer of bread was as crusty as my tidy whities after my first wet dream.  Yes, that crusty!  Inside, though, was airy & soft.  The butter was crack to me.  I asked for another helping of it, as I was liberally dousing each piece of bread w/ butter.  I even helped myself to spoonfuls applied directly to mouth, w/o the interference of bread.

Calamari - Fried squid w/ crispy onions, fennel, lemon & a dijon mustard vinaigrette $12-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#kVwRy-qO3v8PJYyLn5u9aw
This was delicious.  Generous portions, fried crisp & light with a captivating vinaigrette.  I asked for more of said vinaigrette because I was bathing each piece of calamari and/or onion with it.  

Burger and foie gras - Angus beef, pate de foie gras, caramelized apples, balsamic gastrique on a brioche bun w/ pomme frites $18-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#MeXfEou-G1FANcmYRGUT5w
Tres bien!  What sold it for me was the foie gras, a food item that was recently banned for sale in California.  It's like meat butter.  I delighted in the medium-rare goodness-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#b40GDQLSlIUeiYa7GWeWQw
The pomme frites (french fries) were, sadly, soggy & limp.  I guess they spent too much time w/ the Paris go-go dancer the previous night ;p She sure knew how to twerk it, so I don't blame the fries for being limp LOL

Creme brulee $8 - 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#I2QqmkDyFQxm4iGwkx9Y_A
Ahhh, the crispy sugar shell forming a roof over the thick creme underneath.  This was magnifique!  I savored each & every bite, delighting in the burnt flavoring of the sugary shell.

Breakfast - There was about a 5 min wait, so it wasn't long before being seated "al fresco".  Complimentary toasted bread of choice was provided.  I chose sourdough & extra of that fantastic butter.  

Corned beef hash w/ two poached eggs $15 -

Hearty, rich, stick to your ribs good!  I relished each & every bite, as the runny egg yolks slithered down the hash, making for a delectable meal.  Quality portions, worth the $15.

Cafe latte $5 - This could French kiss my derriere.  Weak coffee in a small cup.  I thought the Europeans were known for how strong they like their coffee.  This was more like Folgers.  The Gevalia I brew at home is leaps & bounds better than this drivel.

Service was good, as extra butter was brought out & drinks were refilled.  Seating is plentiful throughout, w/ my recommendation of dining "al fresco".

I enjoyed my 2 dining experiences here at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis.  It's Vegas, so the prices can be a little high for what you get, but I mostly enjoyed the food I had the pleasure of eating here.  Plus, the convenience of having the restaurant located right outside the hotel elevators make stopping here a breeze.

Recommend!

Au revoir!

When I saw this place show up as a Hot New Business on the Yelp frontpage, I thought it was a bit of a silly name.  But it tells you everything you need to know about the business.  Think Subway/Chipotle (Custom Built Sandwich/Burrito) assembly line style ordering, but for pizza.  $8.95 gets you a 12-inch pizza with all the toppings you want.  According to their website:

(4) kinds of sauces
(4) kinds of cheeses, which you can combine together
(7) kinds of meats
(7) kinds of veggies
(7) kinds of toppers, added after the pizza is cooked

Who else sells you a (potentially) 25-topping pizza for $8.95?!  I don't know if I would try it.  Except that I totally would if I could order it without feeling like a bit of a jerk.  Once you order your pie, you'll have it within minutes; these cook fast.  10 minutes after setting foot into the restaurant I had my food!

For my very first custom built pizza I had the spicy diavola sauce, fresh mozzarella, Italian sausage, mushroom, garlic and sun dried tomatoes (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CeqWpwHBoaxwRcv5btnv6g?select=zg2BAK39ZOP7M6bmZmAF7Q#tqe5lahN7SPZZw2mLVaFag).  I can still taste the spicy diavola and garlic in my breath, and I'm quite okay with that.  No gum for me, I'm still enjoying my pizza.  Tasty ingredients all around, and the crust keeps a chewy consistency with a slight crunch.  

You want to ask me out for dinner?  How the heck are you gonna do that?  You can build me a pizza or something.  I am a fan and I will most definitely be back.

Received a killer deal for a 4 day/3 night stay at Encore. Turned out to be ~$116/night package that included a Wynn buffet for two for 3 days and two tickets to Le Rve.  Hey that's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick any day in my book!

Dang SWEET right?!
I'm saving a lot of money by coming here right?!
They don't call it Lost Wages for nothing right?!

Spent two days playing craps at the Encore Casino.  I wasn't even planning on playing there, but their Craps tables stuck with the $10 minimum all weekend long.  I thought for sure they would raise it to a $25 min, but no such luck.  So I couldn't resist and to my detriment, I lost big time.  I did have a 20+ roll streak and won some of it back.  Drank a lot of "free" Bloody Mary's and Dirty Martini's.  But no matter how you look at it, Encore/Wynn got their money's worth outta me.   Even though I didn't end up with a roll of 100's in my pocket, I did not leave this place disappointed.  (I did end up having enough to buy a Ho Dduk the next time I'm at Koo's ;P) 

The rooms were awesome; roomy suites (requested more shoe polish and they gave me 10 cans of it!), huge spa-like bathrooms accommodated with robes, slippers, and a flat-screen TV.  Also for your viewing pleasure, awesome views of the entire strip or downtown LV.  Part of the deal included free Wi-Fi, and use of the fitness club; a very sweet setup with a juice bar, cold and room-temp bottled water, headphones, and ample sweat towels.  When staying at the Encore/Wynn, you also have access to their "European" outdoor pool where Steve Wynn proudly states that you are free to go topless if desired.  So we went and indeed, there were many uninhibited women who were "propped up" and indeed topless.  More power to them.  Cabaas can be rented on a per/day basis.   

I wish we came to LV to experience more places to eat, but with my losing streak and money leaving my wallet left and right, we ended up eating at the "free" buffet for either lunch or dinner all three days... AND YES, I AM SO SICK OF THE WYNN BUFFET.  Even though we earned another free buffet for two the next time we go, I don't think I'll want to spend any more time there.  The one great thing was the wait service.  The waiters we had were all very nice, cordial, and attentative.  As far as the buffet was concerned nothing to write home about.  I think I did eat about 10 crme brulees as that was all that was memorable.

Le Rve was a watery enigma of a story about a lost lover who is shown a world of the underground, ravaged with temptation, and is always being pulled back and forth until the end.  At least that's my take on it.  But a great production none the less.

Two things I uphold above all in my reviews:

Customer service & food (quality, taste, veg options)

When I first walk in to order food to-go door girl or Naomi from what I spotted greets me with a scowl on her face and asks if I want a table. No, ordering out. can I have a menu please? she says "Order at the counter" ... Can-I-have-a-menu-PLEASE?
"Oh, u want a menu.... here. " she hands me a stack. I put the overflow back. She's still scowling. 

Finally, I decide what I want and approach the counter/cooking area. Sunny takes my order with a cheerful smile on her face and was extremely helpful in putting together a combo option for what I was ordering and directing me that when I was ready I could pay and pick up my food at the front where I originally was. I thanked her and went back to pissy pants. 

Door girl doesn't even smile, says "You ready to pay?"... then as I take a seat in the waiting area, I wasn't sure if Sunny knew where I was sitting but I noticed her maybe 10 minutes later with an order looking around. 

I ask door girl if my order is ready and she literally rolls her eyes and says "She'll bring it over when it's ready lady"

..... (these dots represent the angered pause in my head)

Finally, a different waitress approaches me and asks what I ordered and subsequently brought me the order as Sunny was held up with another guest. 

As I leave, Sunny had run outside to find me still in my car and politely said "You forgot your strawberries!" I thanked her and the 3rd waitress for their polite and prompt customer service. 

Sunny should be appreciated or promoted to show her level of excellent customer interaction. it was very pleasant!

Naomi "door girl" should be fired. In a customer facing role as the first person that guests see and that first impression that is crucial for return business, she is seriously offering a lack of enthusiasm and disservice. 

I am a return guest because I do love the quality of food here, and this location is close to my home and the hours offered for late breakfast! but customer service is about 50/50 currently with her as the "face" of Egg Works.

Had the most Mind blowing Experinece here!

This place rocks!  Seriously they have hundreds of gems, fossils, rocks etc etc. I wish they were closer to get to.

So my friend Dawn R. who flew in from Portland for the Yelp Spring Break had been looking for 6 gems for a Feng Shui thing in the living room.  Everything on the internet was just a online store and not a business that you could walk into.  When it comes to gems and minerals you want to hold and see.  Think about a diamond for example.  Wouldn't you rather see it and touch in person before buying!   Well the Yelp Ap came to the rescue again.  

This place is on the outskirts of downtown and easy to get to.  I wasn't sure want to expect since there was less than 10 reviews but WHOA when we walked in it was like DAYUM.  They have A LOT of stuff.  They have the place organized by the minerals, gems and fossils in the front.  When you go to the back you can find even more minerals, gems in all type of sizes and shapes and even a sections of beads.  Another smaller room where they have Buddhist statues.  I was totally impressed with the amount of items this place carries.

I personally was not looking for anything in particular.  I was looking at some pendulum and I tried out a few.  There was one answering me even when I was not holding it so I getting it.   I also purchased a Moldavite http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavite.  Something I had never heard of until that day.  I was curious to know more about it and Miguel was the one who took the time to explain what it was and how people use it.  Being that I had by Reiki 1 & 2 done and he was a Reiki Master and had also done theta healing I knew exactly what he was talking about in terms of energy work.  I could totally feel the warmth from this one gem from holding it in my hand.  I felt like what one may feel when having a hot flash.  It was pretty odd how this little gem was giving off that much energy.  There are only 3-4 mines and it is estimated that it will all be gone in the less than 10 years so I thought I should get one.   So I picked a pendant http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jMrpr92nMEhe4cC4FF00VQ?userid=3H2VbXZ8upvCFncbi5xTcg#hddvoHue4g2iC-Tv6KuvRA and a chain I like and put it on.  The pendant sat right between my heart and throat chakra and I could immediately feel the warmth in my chest area.   

Now this is when things got interesting.  As we were checking out, Miguel had left to the back room to grab a bag for my pendulum.  When he returned he told me to put out both hand and close my eye.  Hmmm that is a strange request but I obliged.  He then put a good size spirit quartz in both hands and told me to hold on an feel.  I seriously never ever ever felt so much energy and vibration coming from gem before.  It was so intense my hands were shaking.  It shot up through my arms and straight to my chest and was pounding right were the Moldavite pendulum lay.  I was totally speechless and all that came out of my mouth was Oh Shit, Oh my goodness, Oh Damn Oh my god etc etc.   A minute or so into it Miguel proceeds to share with me a message from my spirit guide to not be so hard on myself and to take things slowly and to take my time.  With the massive energy and vibration going through me and what I was hearing I teared up big time.  This was so unexpected and a great surprise.  It was one of the most amazing experience I had in a store!!!  Now this is not to be expected with every person that comes in but I was totally opened to it and was ready for it and so I welcomed it.  Freaking amazing.   I was feeling that energy pretty much all day, it was freaking great!!!! 

Anywho, if your' looking to buy a few pieces for feng shuei or maybe even by a Moldavite and you happen to be visiting sin city you have got to stop by this place.  It's a gem of a place!

Locale ~ Downtown 
Offerings ~ Gems, Minerals, Jewelry, Statues
Extras ~ Ask for Miguel,  He is very knowledgeable and helpful!

I have had this place bookmarked for some time, so when given the opportunity to dine here with some fellow Yelpers, I was excited by the prospect. We arrived around noon and the place wasn't too busy. We shared a large number of items from the menu.

Here's a list of all everything we tried:

GARLC KNOTS: Really good. Really small, but warm, flavorful and soft. 
RICE BALLS: These were just ok. I enjoyed them, but they weren't notable. 
LASAGNA EXPLOSIONS - I don't usually like lasagna, but this was a nice change of pace from typical lasagna. Moist and very cheesy.
TRIPE - My favorite part of the meal. I don't typically enjoy tripe, but this preparation was very enjoyable. Not chewy at all and didn't have that tripe-y smell that usually turns me off.
MEATBALLS & ITALIAN SAUSAGE - This dish was ok. The meatballs are huge, however, and I enjoyed the tomato sauce.  
SEAFOOD PASTA IN GARLIC CREAM SAUCE - This dish was just ok. the sauce didn't have enough depth of flavor for me and I don't see myself ordering this dish again if I returned.
SICILIAN PIZZA - I'm not usually a fan of deep dish. This had nice flavor, but it was a little doughy for my taste. Everyone else seemed to love this pizza, so it's just a matter of preference.
WHITE PIZZA - This was one of the standouts. The pizza was seasoned and cooked well. I could have eaten just this dish and been happy. 
EGGPLANT PARM - I absolutely love eggplant, but this wasn't my favorite preparation. Too much breading and the eggplant was sliced a little too thinly for my taste. I do enjoy how they serve ziti instead of spaghetti with this dish, since I'm not a fan of spaghetti.
ZEPPOLES - These were my favorite of all the desserts served. I usually don't enjoy Italian desserts since they are a little denser than I prefer, so the zeppoles stood out for being a little more subtle and not overly sweet. Plus, I can never resist powdered sugar. 
RAINBOW CAKE - This was a little on the dry side for me. A little too chocolatey as well, but that's just a matter of preference.
CANNOLI - I don't usually like cannolis and I can't say this one changed my mind about them. 
ASSORTED COOKIES - These were good. They have a number of varieties and I would be back for more of these for sure. 

Service was spectacular. Our drinks were kept full and everyone was extremely friendly and entertaining, making our meal that much more enjoyable. 

We all had a great meal and there were plenty of leftovers for all. I was able to take some home to my mom who's a pasta fanatic and she loved it. I'd definitely be back for pizza, tripe and dessert as those were my favorites from our meal.

Boba!

Yes, I said boba.  Boba as in "a name for the sweet, chewy, tapioca balls found at the bottom of the Taiwanese bubble tea/boba tea drink."

There are few places that have boba in the Valley, and after seeing a sign out front of Red Kimchi on several occasions, I finally decided to go pay them a visit.

I walked in at an odd time... around 5pm on a Tuesday.  I was heading to a meeting and not sure how long it would be, so I wanted a little something to hold me over until dinner.  The restaurant was empty except for all of their staff sitting at a table in the back eating.  I felt like I was interrupting but once I was in, I wasn't going to turn around and walk out.  I came in for boba and I was going to leave with boba!

I felt kind of awkward as I just wanted a boba to-go, but they sat me at a table while I waited... I perused the menu of boba choices and narrowed it down to either green tea, mango, or strawberry boba.  I asked the guy for his input and he asked if I wanted it to be low cal or not.  When I said, yes, I'd prefer the low cal option, he convinced me to go with the green tea flavor.  Imagine my surprise when he brought me my drink five minutes later and it tasted like ice cream!  I really really doubt it was low cal, but I decided to "suck it up" quite literally... and it was delicious!

I took a menu with me and since then, decided I need to return sometime soon to give their Korean food a shot.  Hopefully when I do, it will be a less-awkward experience.  If you're up for joining me for Korean sometime, let me know!  And regardless, go check out Red Kimchi's boba and yelp about it so I can see what you think!

I am flabbergasted. Flummoxed. Freaking the fug out. 

WHY IS THIS PLACE NOT BEING TALKED ABOUT ON YELP!?!?!?

I'm sorry, I just had to get that out of my system. 

But seriously, how is it POSSIBLE that only one review exists for Fantasy Costume Rentals and that it dates back to 2009??? This is a spectacular business!

First off, let me tell you a funny little story about my discovery of this gem. My birthday was a couple of weeks ago, and I was planning a little shindig for myself. In true Heather fashion (I tend to go a little over the top with everything I do) I chose to have a theme, the "Roaring 20's" as I was turning 29 (OMG I'm effing THIRTY next year?! When the hell did that happen??) 
I digress. 

I was looking for a costume and was unhappy with my choices at the "other" costume shop that shall not be named that seems to hold a monopoly on costume rentals in the valley. It was about midnight on a Sunday. I did a google search for costume rentals and Fantasy Costumes came up. I of course go straight to the reviews, and when I saw the only one written was in 2009, I was convinced they were no longer open. How would a costume fanatic like myself not know of this place? I decided to call the business number (keep in mind the time of night) to see if it was a disconnected number or if I reached a message listing hours. A man answers. Completely astounded to hear a live voice on the other end of the line, I stammered,
"Um, is this Fantasy Costumes??" 
"Yes, it sure is."
"OMG, I'm SOOOO sorry for calling so late. I didn't think anyone would answer!"
"It's ok, I have calls forwarded to my cell in case of emergencies." 
"So, uh, when are you open?"
"Tues-Sun 10am-6pm"
"Cool, thanks. Well, I'll be seeing you in person soon! Goodnight!"

Located on University off of McKemy (near Hardy), this is a small unassuming shop that you really have to know about to notice. In the front of the shop are two large catalogs with pictures of the costumes in order of category, with a list of sizes each costume is available in. This makes it so easy to shop for something. I pointed at a couple of costumes and asked the owner about them. One he replied "That one's really cheesy. I don't think you'll like it, but this one (he points) is really nice." and then proceeds to bring out some options for me to try on.

For $45, I rented a super cute silver flapper dress (see pics), which came with a feather headpiece, long pearl necklace, boa, and free fishnet stockings!. The "other" costume shop wanted $50 for a similar dress and that did not include the boa ($10 extra), necklace, or stockings. Just the dress and headband. 

My boyfriend also rented a super cool gangster costume, which the owner was sure to adjust the length of the pants for him before we picked up the costumes. Again, it came with everything. Hat, shirt, tie, gloves, shoe covers, and he even pinned a red carnation on the jacket! Last minute, Jared realized the suspenders weren't with the costume and he called the owner (on Sunday, the day he is closed) and the owner told him to come by right away and he would get the suspenders to him. 

A couple of things to note. You can only pay with CASH or CHECK and a deposit (2x the cost of the rental) is required. But I will tell you, it is SO worth it. This guy is so organized, really cares for his costumes, and is not about nickel and diming. He provides a quality product for a reasonable price. I will be using Fantasy Costumes for my costume needs from this point on! Love love love!

Tonight we found our new little hole in the wall joint. Brand new at this location ( the owner has another in the camelback swapmart)  this is one sweet little find. Housed in a small restaurant that just opened in the beginning of January . 

Clean and neat as you enter this place ,  it seems ready to meet all your soul food needs. The menu offers such standards as fried chicken , fried catfish , ribs,  waffles and my new favorite  fried shrimp. We we first entered the service was a bit off , with many people coming in for take out and us sitting down we kind of got lost in the crowd. But soon our waiter got back to us with apologies and we were ready to start the meal.   For tonight's meal we had Catfish , cornbread , yams , fried shrimp, cabbage , beans and rice and sweet potatoe pie.   From the first taster we were happy with our choice to stop in. With tons of pepper and soul this food made us feel homestyle good. We were impressed with each item with exception to the macaroni and cheese , which  was a bit bland in comparison to bursts of flavor in everything else.  Big favorite were  the cabbage -wow what a tasty surprise great home seasoning and velvety taste. 
We also really liked the sweet potato pie , it was in a light crust and had a delicate flavor not overly sweeten and very smooth. 

The owner is a big sweetheart of a guy and offered us a taste of his new macaroni salad which tasted like dear old moms.  Yum! 

If you go give a call and ask if they are serving your favorite because with the great tastes they are serving they go quick!   Can't wait to go back and try the ribs!

I recently realized that I've had excellent experiences at every Michael Mina restaurant I've been to.  Seablue, Nobhill, American Fish etc.  They're all at least 4 stars and sometimes more.  This past trip to Stripsteak was 4.5 stars.  

I have been here at least 5 times and I always bring a $50 restaurant.com coupon.  This isn't a top 3 steakhouse in Vegas but $50 off from $100 makes it a terrific value for a really solid steak.  

We've recently been ordering the $72 porterhouse which is a monster cut that can easily be split 2 ways and even 3 if you get an appetizer or an extra side.  They'll bring it out to you in a pan already carved up if you want a la Peter Luger style and that's what we do.  I also love all the meaty goodness on the bone itself.  To me, kobe beef is basically that really tender, juicy part by the bone all blown up into a regular sized piece of steak.  My wife loves the filet so I eat the majority of the sirloin side which is just fine with me.  We like it rare.

The sides are $14 each so 2 of those gets me to a $100 exact.  The spinach souffle is the absolute must freakin have side dish.  I don't think there's any other restaurant doing the souffle quite like this.  The server brings it to the table piping hot, punctures the top of it and pours cream into it.  One of my favorite sides ever.  I am over creamed spinach!  We're through!

We went with the mushrooms cooked in bacon for our second side since we already loaded up on starch from those awesome complimentary fries they bring to the table.  Forget bread, forget appetizers, you've got french fries!  I never make it to dessert anyways.        

But the kicker this evening was when it came to box the steak.  We had asked the server to box up the 2 leftover pieces along with the bone itself.  The general manager was assisting the servers and busing tables.  She accidentally threw out the leftovers not hearing the server ask her to box it up.  I didn't make that big of a beef (ha) about it but she proposed the chef to cook us another WHOLE porterhouse and box it up for us!  I was stunned.  Talk about going above and beyond!  Who are we to say no to another $72 steak?  Wow.  This was an all around great experience and I look forward to the next time.

To review or not to review, that's the question I've been struggling with. With 50 reviews already, what more could little ol' me possibly add? Absolutely nothing, I knew.

But then, today turned out to be a special day...
I was trapped - back to back meetings from early morning through late afternoon with no time for lunch. Fortunately for me a good friend but obviously not as hardworking co-worker on her way out the door offered to bring me something back. Where was she going? Pasty!!! She just needed to know what I wanted, of course. So I checked the Pasty to go menu hanging from the bars of my cell - oops - I mean the wall of my cube, and to my surprise discovered that this wasn't going to be just another Pasty... Being the quasi-vegetarian I am, I've been slowly working my way through their vegetarian menu (more than 10 delicious options, including my favorite eggplant parmesan), and there was only one left - the Veggie Tikka Masala. My 11th and final vegetarian pasty - quite the momentous occasion, don't you think?

It was while I was savoring the perfect mix of fake chicken, bell pepper and basmati rice in tikka masala sauce wrapped in that soft chewy crust, dipped in that rich mint-yogurt dressing that I realized, 50 reviews be damned. Something new to say or not, I've got to say it. So for what's it's worth, this is it.

So, in conclusion: If you haven't been to Pasty yet, you need to go - soon. Come on, man - 50 reviews with a 4 1/2 star average rating? This place so obviously rocks! One tip: if you go for lunch, go early (they open at 11). It gets pretty busy and takes longer the later and busier it gets. Going early is also recommended if there are more than 2 in your party - there are only a couple of tables that fit 3 or more (otherwise you'll be sittin' at separate tables, or at the bar - oh, and should you find yourself headed for the bar, try not to sit directly in front of the one of the ovens, as those seats get pretty freakin' warm).

There have been some changes at the DMV and I'm impressed. No more waiting in a long line yay! This new "Dash Pass" system worked well. With the Dash Pass you can text, call or go online and put yourself in the line without having to even go down to the DMV until it's your turn. They will text you with how many people are ahead of you and your estimated wait time and then they send you a command list so you can text back whenever you want to find out things like how long your current wait time is or to let them know if you need more time or even if you want to be taken out of the line. They text you with fair enough warning about when your turn is so you know when to arrive at the DMV and they let you know around that time what window you will need to go to. This is seriously awesome! I never would have thought I'd give the DMV 5 stars, but this new system really worked great for me twice now and the employees were even really friendly. I needed to renew my license so I had to go inside. Usually I avoid going inside since they have the DMV kiosks around town at a variety of places and it's so convenient to stop and register your car at the kiosk and you can do it at any hour. Sometimes though you just can't avoid having to go inside and now it's not that bad having to do so. The snack bar seems to get bigger and bigger and the line of people at it cracks me up, but hey why not grab a hot dog, nachos or cotton candy while at the DMV? When it came time to pay for my license renewal and the lady told me it would cost $41.25 I was shocked. I asked why so much now and she said that I would be getting a license good for 8 years. Say what?!?! Apparently those born even numbered years get the 8 year license and those in odd numbered years that renew will continue to receive the 4 year license until 2017 and then get the 8 year license after that. I kind of like the idea of not having to go back for 8 years a lot. I'm kind of surprised though since people do age differently among other things. I didn't have an issue with finding a parking spot like I have many times before and that was nice. I'm guessing the parking lot wasn't so bad because people are maybe using Dash Pass. I am happy to say that I had a quick and painless experience at the DMV.

Cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap. And no, I don't mean great value. I mean it's obvious how many corners they cut with this place. I love the sls in BH and this place feels like a budget motel in comparison. 

We paid an extra 70 bucks to upgrade to a "lux corner suite" what we got was a cheaply decorated room with a super hard mattress, thin sandpaper sheets, cheap thin sandpaper duvet. The ac is crazy loud. The view is of a back service area. Curtains don't keep light out. No bath tub. And this is not a suite.... It's just a regular king bed. Using French themed printed curtains as wallpaper and dividers does not make the room cool. It makes it look like they cut corners, which, oh yeah... It's obvious. This is probably by far the worst "luxury" hotel I've stayed in. Ever. 

Not to mention, right when we checked in the room was not even cleaned! It took over half an hour of trying to get a hold of someone via phone and then going down to the lobby before the housekeeper we were able to flag down just felt bad for us and cleaned up right away. No, we were never able to get a hold of anyone to make a complaint. 

The finish and quality of this hotel just isn't there and neither is the service. Take your business elsewhere. You will be disappointed. Our friends warned us already, but given that I love the sls BH, I wanted to try it out anyway. Boo. Guess they "already told me so."


Update: yea I wrote this prior to check out. But here comes the sweet cherry on top of an already crappy experience. So while we were waiting for the room we had nowhere to go... Decided to grab two beers at the bar downstairs. Total, $17. We charged it to the room. Upon check out we noticed that they charged us $19 on top of the $17 beer charge as "gratuity".. Really? For that crappy service? Get real. Then they tried to sneak on another room charge and double charge us for the one night. Wow. And no offer to waive any fees or anything for our entire crappy experience which I did finally unload onto the front desk agent. Just dropped another star. Definitely by far the worst Vegas experience ever. Zero customer service or appreciation. Won't even be patronizing the BH location anymore.

Even asked for late check out but decided I really couldn't blow the joint quick enough. It was just too unrelaxing and flustering.

I love German food!!!! I have always loved German food!!!! 

Oddly enough, Vegas is a German food Mecca of sorts - at least for our part of the country. I was amazed at how many German places I saw around Vegas! Especially since the town is not the biggest. I actually got to try two places and one of them was the fabulous Hofbrahaus!

I know that German food is not one of the most well known cuisines in the world since it is so simple but if you get to try it you will see there is true beauty in its simplicity!

To start with Hofbrauhaus is beautiful inside and out. The building looks like traditional German architecture on the outside and inside. The ceilings are high and they are painted really nicely. They have a stage for live bands too! Seating is on large tables with benches just like you would expect in a Munich beer hall!

My BF and I came here on our last day in Vegas and I decided to treat him with the money I got from the machines!

What is really cool, and even impressive is that some of the food items are actually flown in from Germany!!!! We had a large freshly flown in pretzel to start with and we found out that the red cabbage, bratwurst and sauerkraut are also flown in!!!! We had the veal bratwurst, the chicken bratwurst and two beers. Mine was a incredibly good special seasonal beer! We also tried the apple strudel which was also flown in! Everything was seriously very tasty!

This review, of course, is not truly complete since I did not get to be here during Oktoberfest! The ambience here must be truly incredible when it is that time of year! However, if this place gets five stars without all the excitement of Oktoberfest - it truly must be good and, trust me it is

Service was pretty good! While you wait they give you interesting little newspapers with all kinds of information about the restaurant and its events. Next time we come I will make sure we get to check out one of the live bands! Expect to spend a great deal of what you win at the machines haha! This place is not cheap! I shelled out about $90 for two with tip included!

Parking is no problem as you would expect in most places in Vegas! There is a large lot adjacent to the restaurant.

***We had a large party menu (fixed) at Tao's and that could have contributed to the experience; the food was mediocre with some of the courses being decent, but more of them with a quality and flavor similar to a PF Chang's***

Tao has never been high on my list to try in Las Vegas, but I've definitely heard a lot about it--especially since it is both a restaurant and, I believe, a nightclub after dinner ends.  Tao was also featured on the Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate where Duff Goldman selected their satay of Chilean sea bass as his favorite thing in Las Vegas.

Tao is located in The Venetian and it is a big spot with a dark decor (very loud as well).  Tao's huge menu is very modern Asian or Asian fusion with a wide variety of items including sushi, sashimi, edamame, satay, tuna tartare, hot and sour soup, dumplings, spring rolls, BBQ meats, tempura, wok-fried meat, poultry and seafood dishes, fried rice, and noodles.

Everything was kind of okay, but while a few dishes were noticeably better than what you would get at a PF Chang's, a lot of it wasn't (and Tao carries a much higher price tag though part of that is because Tao is in Las Vegas).  We did have a fixed party menu so maybe more freshly prepared dishes would have stood out more though the flavors were not exciting or memorable.

Service was fine.  The food came out at a good pace.

As mentioned, prices were high for a just okay Asian fusion restaurant.

Tao does offer many different dishes and it brings in a lot of customers to make for a lively atmosphere so if either of those two qualities appeal to you, Tao might be worth checking out.  But if you are looking for high quality food or good value, Tao might not be the best choice on The Strip.

Like other Las Vegas casinos on The Strip, The Venetian offers both free self and valet parking.

I had three thoughts running through my head as my wife and I were walking out.

1. Outfuckingstanding!!
2. I am having this, this and this next time.
3. We better come back soon because popularity is inevitable and I am going to dread when I'll have to wait 30+ minutes for a table.  I'll do it though.  

Eating at the bar was great since we were able to chat with Woosuk aka Ryan aka the owner throughout our meal.  He handles everything with Moko except for the cooking.  That's left to Chef Hong who is a goooooodddddaaaamn culinary wizard!!  That guy is a total one man show coming in at 10am daily to prep all their amazing stuff for dinner when doors open at 5pm.    

Just discussing the effort and detail Hong goes into preparing plates like the delectable beef short rib (butchering the beef himself, select bones to cook with to enhance the flavor, 3+ hours of cooking etc) was inspiring.  A well presented dish, the beefy fattiness of the short rib accompanied by crispy garlic, gratin and amazing sauce was heavenly.    Christina Perri's "A Thousand Years" was playing while I savored it all and it seemed very fitting.  

It's not often that an Asian restaurant includes a spoon for their table setting but Ryan is smart enough to know the sauce for not only the short rib but others like their "Black Bean Noodle" will/need/must be scooped up out of the bowl.  It sure looks a lot more elegant than sticking my face into it.  Genius!   

They offer Berkshire pork belly cooked for either 10 or 30(!!!) hours.  Even though the 10 hour belly is tenderer, how could I pass up 20 more hours of cooking for $1 more?  It was like nothing I'd ever had before.  The soybean paste marinade with the kimchi crepe and their homemade black raspberry marinated salt (who does that???) was exceptional. 

The grilled then chilled eggplant salad with micro greens and tomato was refreshing and flavorful.  We also got an order of the fried soy chicken wings which was like modern soul food with the unique breading and honey glaze.  There was absolutely nothing left but bones.  

I entered Moko expecting a decent meal and left having an excellent one.  There's nothing quite like this in Vegas at the moment.  Go go go!!

Recently, my husband and I made a trip to Las Vegas. Since we are huge fans of Gordon Ramsay, we made reservations at his "Gordon Ramsay Steak" restaurant, in the Paris hotel. 
 
My husband wrote a great review of our experience but it wouldn't fit here.  So this is the condensed version.  We had a reservation on a Thursday night for 8:15.  We arrived on time and were told by the woman in front that it would be 10-15 minutes.  Go wait in the bar.  No I'm sorry, nothing, not even a smile when we walked up to her.  We were later told by a manager her name was Danielle.

We went into the bar and it was packed and had to stand.  15 minutes later a couple that had an 8:15 reservation left and we took their seats and ordered a drink.  My husband went to check with Danielle who held up her hand in an impatient "stop talking" manner,  and informed my husband "You are the next to be seated". Then immediately turned her back on him.

Then the people next to us who had an 8:30 reservation were seated.  I got up to talk to Danielle who was quite rude to me as well and informed me that "someone" was in there looking for us.  Apparently when you arrive Danielle writes down what you look like and when it's your turn to be seated she gives your description to a young girl who has to come in an find you.

Finally a young girl got us, at 9:00 for an 8:15 reservation.   I'm sure Danielle had forgotten about us and couldn't be bothered to apologize for her error.  We told the young woman you got us how displeased we were.  She had nothing to say and looked very uncomfortable.  We were seated and at this point I told my husband I just wanted to pay for our drinks and talk to the manager.  The waiter came and we told him, he apologized, first person to do so.  Then another man came up we told him the whole story, nope he was not the manager.  Finally the manager came up and by this time we were really upset.  He offered us a table near the kitchen.  There was no way I was going to spend several hundred dollars on dinner.  We had to repeat we just wanted our check, he comped us for the drinks.

So be aware, reservations mean nothing at GR Steak. We watch all of Gordan's shows, he always preaches STANDARDS.  Apparently he needs to teach some to Danielle and the hostesses of GR steak.

I ate here during "Restaurant Week" and am so glad I did! I enjoyed every bite of my meal and the service was fantastic. Hubby and I were seated at a roomy booth and our drinks were never empty. A basket of warm bread with butter came out quick and tasted great. The price for the RW menu was $50.14 per person and I enjoyed the following for that price before tax:

The Famous Original Spinning Bowl Salad - This is made right at your table. Our server, Ms. Huang had 2 metal bowls that spun as she added the dressing. The salad had lettuce, beets, hard boiled eggs, croutons and their signature vintage dressing. I haven't ever tasted a salad like this before. It was suggested that I add some of the Lawry's seasoning that was on the table, so I did. The salad tasted so fresh and delicious. Very good.

Mashed Potatoes - This was a nice addition to my plate. The mashed potatoes are whipped with butter and milk and tasted perfect. The brown gravy that came on it was good. 

Buttered Peas - Yum! Being on the same plate, the peas ended up with brown gravy and au jus on them which I like. Plus, I just like peas!

Yorkshire Pudding - This comes in a skillet by itself. It tasted great and was perfect for soaking up the last bits of gravy on my plate. it was soft and really good. 

Prime Rib - 8 ounces of pure heaven! A carver came to the table with a cart of prime rib and let me pick how I wanted it and then carved it right in front of me. I like mine a little more done and that's just what I got. The prime rib was so tender and literally fell apart. It had such great flavor. To say I didn't leave here stuffed would be absolutely wrong! Everything tasted good, but the prime rib was the true star.

Creme Brulee - This had fresh berries on top and It tasted so good, but I could only eat half because I was so full. 

Coffee - Tasted great and was a perfect way to end the meal. At this point I just needed a pillow for a nap!

I can't say enough about our server. She was fantastic and took great care of us. The manager on duty, Wendy came over and chit chatted with us for maybe 10 minutes and she was warm and friendly. She let us know a little about the lunch menu which sounds like a winner. This was a great RW experience and I will be back!

DEAL ME IN

This place is a total find and is located on Fremont Street next to the Heart Attack Cafe. You can not miss it because they have a blinking red neon sign that says $2 Tacos. Enough said!!!

I needed a light snack before dinner after skipping lunch, so I decided to pop in here. They had a large selection of meats to choose from. I decided to go with a pork carnitas taco and a shredded beef taco. Both were really good and packed full of meat. The $2 price also included a choice of hot sauce and I went with the medium green salsa.  Cilantro and raw onions were included too. I skipped the cilantro but dived in on the raw onions. Luckily I had a tin of the Yelp shaped breath mints to freshen me up afterwards. 

The meats were really tasty. There is nothing like a slow roasted piece of meat in my book. I saw the grilled steak and grilled chicken but they looked a little dried out. This location has many of its meats precooked and sitting in warming trays. This is why I choose the two meats I did. The pork carnitas and shredded beef were sitting in their own natural juices and I knew they would be yummy at any time of the day. I was dead on. 

I decided to go with a medium salsa because I was taking a redeye flight back home and I wasn't looking forward to terror at 30,000 feet, so I played it safe. They had several salsas to choose from but I was happy with the medium salsa verde. It had the perfect amount of spicy without being too over powering. 

The location is in a food court without any  mall. There were two other restaurants in here. One serving pizza/pasta and the other serving Asian food. I did not try the other food at these two places but was offered some Asian chicken on a toothpick that I nicely turned down. 

So if your on Fremont Street looking for a light but filling snack then I highly recommend this place. The tacos were really good and I would come back here in a heartbeat for a good meal deal that won't break the bank.

Exhilarating pre fixe menu that showcases the chef's masterful culinary skills!

Located in the beautiful themed garden of the Bellagio, the restaurant's sleek blond wood interior was both intimate and inviting.  Set against soft lighting, the dining space was conducive to a festive and celebratory evening with good friends and at first glance of the tasting menu, i was looking forward to the exciting evening ahead. 

The Breads: Warm sourdough & honey wheat rolls came out nice & hot with a side of lightly salted soft butter. The sourdough was my personal favorite with its nice buttery crust and warm chewy center.

Our party of four didn't need much coaxing as we almost instantly decided on the all inclusive chef's tasting menu with wine pairings, which included the famous lobster pot pie!  

Tuna Tartare - Fresh plump ruby red tuna prepared table side with bright vibrant colors that was definitely a sight to see!  The ancho chili and fresh mint pumped up the volume by adding a tangy zing to this remarkable dish and the pine nuts added a pleasant rustic contrast of texture and rounded out the flavor profiles nicely!

Caviar Parfait - Magnificent! Served atop airy light creme fraiche and a crisp potato cake, each bite was magical! The bubbly paired perfectly with this exquisitely enjoyable dish!

Lobster Pot Pie - Outstanding! I was anxiously anticipating this dish and i am happy to admit that it did not disappoint! As soon as the server carved away the warm golden crust, the sweet smell of buttery lobster wafted into the air and i was mesmerized! As i glanced down into my ramekin, i could see chunks of juicy lobster bathed in brandied lobster cream and it made my mouth instantly water!  I simply love pot pie and lobster has always been on my guilty pleasure list, so the combination for me was a match made in foodie heaven! 

American Kobe Rib Eye - Perfection! The kobe beef was exceptionally moist, tender and buttery! Oh, and yes, it melted in my mouth! Hot dayam, what i'd give to sink my teeth into this luscious piece of premium meat again! Let's not forget about the sides! The butter poached porcini was rich and flavorful while the creamed corn was decadence in every bite!

The tasting menu ended with several small dessert items that showcased the chef's whimsical approach to sweets including a magnificent root beer float, a cookie served with hot mulled apple cider, chocolate bon bons, chocolate chip cookies and a glazed chocolate brownie with cocoa nib ice cream & spiced pecans. 

In a few words, it was literally death by chocolate!!!....and oh what a way to die!

The wine pairings were 100% spot on compliments to our meals. With that said, our server was nothing short of professional, helpful, and friendly.  It was great having friendly conversation with everyone but still enjoy the formalities of fine dining. 

What more could a birthday boy ask for?

BEST OMAKASE EVER ! Thanks to Chef Eric for accommodating us for so long (oh my god it took FOUR AND A HALF HOURS) ! ! ! First and BEST omakase experience ! Omakase is a show in itself. Watching Chef Eric work his magic and show his creativity in his dishes. max points on service ! 

Fresh Wasabi - made into a relish. Addicting! went well with a lot of dishes but also yummy to "snack" on while waiting in between dishes. produces a fast effect to the nasal passages. has a nice, sweet flavor. 

#1 - Marinated Tuna on top of chopped Mountain Yam with Wasabi Tobiko

Saw Chef Eric chopping mountain yam. After chopping, the yam produced a "slimy" texture, similar to okra but crunchy like jicama. Yam itself was plain but paired with a marinated tuna balanced flavors very well. what a variety of textures

#2 - Deep Fried Gobo/Burdock Root with dipping sauce

Little chips. Fried perfectly. Very slight starchy texture but crispy overall. Lightly sweet. Great "snack" ! 

#3 - Fresh Santa Barbara Sea Conch with salt/pepper/sesame oil dipping sauce

Very fresh. Meat texture had a nice "bite" texture. LIGHTLY dipping the sliced conch in the sauce gives it a nice flavor. Salt helps brings out more sweetness of the conch meat

#4 - Fresh Hama Hama & Shigoku Oysters

One of my fears on eating raw oysters is they being not fresh, and not clean (resulting in biting into sand/shell/etc.) Two different sizes. Shigoku oysters were small and fat. Very clean and fresh. Gave a nice, creamy texture. Hama Hama oysters were much bigger, not as "fat/thick". Outer "rim" of the oyster, gave it a nice "crispy/crunchy" texture when eating. 

#5 - Fresh Live Scallop w/ Dried Miso

Served two ways. The scallop itself was thinly sliced and sprinkled with dried miso and layered with slices of cucumber. The miso gave it a nice flavor on top of the fresh taste of the scallop. The muscle? was sliced and placed in the middle. Not chewy but gave a nice "crispy/crunchy" texture, similar to what you'd get from eating fresh geoduck sashimi 

#6 - Takoyaki - Deep Fried Fresh Octopus Suction Cups

At first, i thought this was calamari. But was told it was the SUCTION CUPS of an octopus leg. Lightly battered and deep fried. Crispy batter. Suction cups itself was nice and "crispy" 

#7 - Fresh Live Hokkaido Octopus Leg

This was definitely a surprise. Aside it from having a small spot of sriracha sauce on top that gave it a little kick... i did NOT expect the octopus to be so soft and tender. Granted i dont think i've had raw octopus, especially served like this but oh man ! 

#8 - Fresh Live Sweet Shrimp with Black Tobiko and Uni + Deep Fried Head

The head was deep fried. Fried pretty well. Most of it was edible, except some thicker, harder areas. The sweet shrimp itself was big. Meat texture was firm. Slightly naturally sweet. 

#9 - Fresh Live Santa Barbara Sea Urchin topped with a raw Quail Egg & Ikura on a bed of mixed seaweed brown rice

LARGE & FAT (no joke !) pieces of sea urchin placed on top of the bed of mixed seaweed with brown rice (and other things) with a raw quail egg on top with some Ikura. The sea urchin was SUPER creamy. Mixing in the quail egg and ikura. Taking a small piece of the sea urchin and everything else. What a orchestra of flavors and textures. so delicious ! add a little fresh wasabi for even better experience !  i think this is less than $20 ala carte too ! what a deal, even normally ! 

#10 - Fresh Blue Fin Tuna/Chu-Toro/O-toro from Spain Nigiri Trio 

Made into nigiri. Chef used his special homemade soy sauce on the tuna as well ! Best blue fin tuna i've ever eaten. Very slight metallic taste. Super tender and flavorful. Chu-toro was a perfect balance of meat and fat. Melts in your mouth. O-toro (was a little disappointing due to the pieces of chewy parts (tendons?) which req' the chef to slice and arrange it differently). Super fatty. Would have liked the chef to quickly torch the top to bring out the aroma and flavor of the fat even more. 

#11 - Fresh Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna with Fried Onions

Sliced tuna. Add a few onions to the middle, on top of the sliced chili, wrap it around and enjoy. plethora of flavors on top of the nice sauce it was sitting in. Chili adds a little small kick to it all

#12 - Torch Seared Wagyu Beef with Uni, Ikura, and chopped Shallots

Super tender! Roll it around to "encase" the uni and ikura. Opposite side of beef still raw. variation of beef tataki. 

#13 - Fresh Kohada (Spotted Sardine) 

First time trying kohada ! always wanted to try ! strong flavor with a little sourness (similar to mackerel) 

#14 - Fresh Australian Ocean Trout and New Zealand King Salmon

Trout tastes crisper, less fatty than salmon. Both orange meat. Simple and clean. 

#15 - Fresh Blue Fin O-Toro Sashimi

THAT MARBLING ! Super tender. A5 Wagyu of the Sea. 

#16 - Unagi topped with avocado and bonito flakes

Simple but delicious unagi nigiri

#17 - Green Tea Ice Cream

1st floral tasting and aromatic green tea EVER

TWO STARS is all you get. Reason being I am glad this location was not taken over by a pawn shop, happy ending spa or a needle exchange and also because the food is decent. I repeat. The food is decent. 

My big beef with this restaurant is the service. When I say service I mean the Management. 

I have been to Sammy's on three separate occasions. First time with a fellow Yelper for brunch and I had the breakfast tacos which were good. Not great, but good. Service was on point.

Second visit was at lunch time on a Sunday with my mother. It took our waitress 25 minutes to get us our drinks. I realize how long it takes to get water and how difficult it is. What was even more annoying than our waitress was the fact that they let the patrons who were sitting at the nice bar in the center of the restaurant scream at the TV during the football game. They were tossing back $10 bottomless Mimosas and obnoxiously reacting to every play and startling all of the dining customers who most of them appeared to have just come from church. Not cool especially because this restaurant has a side sports bar where they should have been directed to. Not cool especially because the Managers did nothing at all about it. The Managers stood by the bar and watched the game the entire time, too! Not my idea for a relaxing Sunday brunch. If I wanted this ruckus I would have gone to the sports book!

Third visit I really disliked a pasta dish I was sharing. Took one bite and no more. I mentioned it to the waitress and was still charged for it. Way to keep it classy, Sammy's. 

NOT ONCE IN ANY OF MY VISITS DID THE MANAGERS TOUCH ANY TABLES TO SEE IF THE GUESTS WERE HAPPY WITH THEIR FOOD AND SERVICE.

Lastly, I did not want to write this review.It's my favorite time of year when I pretty much love everyone and everything.  I shared my frustration with their website directly. But, when 2 MONTHS later I did not receive anything more than a generated email response from the Sammy's website I knew I had to let the Yelp family know. I will not be playing it again, Sam I am.

Darden Restaurants has recently made a renewed effort to improve the offerings of their Italian inspired Olive Garden. 

We were so impressed, we might be back soon. Really. 

Given the likes of Macaroni Grill, Johnny Carino, Carrabba, Buca di Beppo, Spaghetti Factory (to some extent Margiano's), they have all been stealing market share away from Olive Garden, the so called king of Americanized Italian food. 

Tired of being a late night comedy punching bag, Darden recently made a wholesale upgrades to their menu and I believe brought out their "A Game". http://investor.darden.com/m/#deepLink/%7B%22view%22%3A%22PressReleaseDetails%22%2C%22languageId%22%3A%221%22%2C%22itemId%22%3A%225f329c57-9e8f-469a-8482-758db3cc9d1f%22%2C%22year%22%3A%222014%22%7D. 

If you have somehow missed the differentiation for some of these Italian themed concepts, both Carrabba's and Macaroni Grill aim for a higher demo group. And not a lot has changed over the last ten years since the Times wrote: 

"Carrabba's Italian Grill and Romano's Macaroni Grill, are both far behind Olive Garden in the full-service Italian restaurants... Although both chains are significantly smaller and are outspent by Olive Garden, they aim at a somewhat different customer: one who is willing to spend a bit more on a meal. Reflecting that higher-end positioning, Carrabba's and Macaroni Grill both used chefs to promote their brand." http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/25/business/media-business-advertising-spots-for-carrabba-s-macaroni-grill-try-pull-away.html 

Clearly there's no shortage of opinions regarding which one of these concepts are your favorite. http://www.disboards.com/archive/index.php/t-2641561.html. 

So with all this in mind, we decided to give this former Pillsbury concept another try.  

We arrive on a Friday night around seven-fifteen. Most of the families with small kids were just finishing their entrees. This restaurant actually has a section in the back, cordoned off from the regular patrons for families. Nice. 

We were seated pretty quickly. Our waitress Rebbecca greeted us, asked us about drinks and if we wanted water with our meal. 

One of their menu items, is a choice of six or nine ounce carafes of their house wines.  Rebbecca offered us a tasting from the bottle of Riesling she brought to our table. Clever marketing, very clever. 

We decided to share a 9 oz carafe, skipping appetizers and starting with their famous never ending Salad Bowl (see photo). It's still including in the price of your dinner btw, or soup if you prefer.

My friend Marvin A wrote about Olive Garden as...  "Their Dreck will not make you ill. It'll simply remind you ...... what BLAH Drive-In Dreck taste like. SpaghettiOs would of been a welcomed sight, last night." 

Prior to this evening's experience, we would have tended to agree.  

But the Italian Trio (photo) and Grilled Chicken (photo) were tasty and just as good the next day when we reheated them. LOL

In many ways, Olive Garden is still just a safe, standby type of place. But as you might have noticed, this is a Four Star review. Clearly Darden wants to be taken seriously and this is their best effort to date. 

So is Olive Garden better than Romano's Macaroni Grill, or Carrabba's? True-fully, I don't know. But we had a nice time and the food was good. 

So Four Stars and expect to pay around $30.00 each

"That's all you need to know, right there, " she said, pointing up behind her head at a framed plackard from local news affiliate CBS 5 Dean's List.  
It was dated from like 1996, or 2003, or something like that, I can't remember, but it wasn't very recent.
"What's that got to do with Customer Service?" I asked, completely perplexed.  
I was just trying to tell her that I've had the same thing happen here twice now in two visits, where she is attending to personal business instead of her customer, ie me.  
"Go on. (waving towards the door)  We been here 17 years.  We don't need YOU."
"You haven't even listened to me.  I'm going to have to tell somebody about this."
"I don't care.  I dont need to listen.  I'M the owner. Go." (she starts pacing back and forth behind the counter, like a caged animal or a person about to get in a fight)
"You're the ONLY owner?  So you're saying your PARENTS work for YOU?  Here, and down the street at BurgerMania?"
"I'm the owner.   I don't care."

A customer standing next to me, who's already received her order but has been waiting the entire time, come to find out, for Mrs. Rude to scoop her an ice cream cone, chimes in with, "I don't think she WANTS to listen to you."

You think?!    


Moments earlier, I'd stood at the counter ready to order, while she was digging red plastic baskets out of one of the trash containers in the lobby.  She saw me, and proceeded to continue what she was doing without acknowledging me, for a few more moments.

Then she comes around the counter  -- no hand washing -- and proceeds to take my order.  
$7.03 ... hand her my card, she swipes it but doesn't press any buttons on the card machine or the cash register.  
~
On her phone laying on the counter, she continues the texting she originally started while taking my order.
~
It's taking forever, and she keeps going back and forth between the credit card reading machine and her phone laying on the counter.
     -a few buttons pressed over here, -a few buttons pressed over there
Finally, I say "Forget it, this is the second time you've done something like this to me recently, and it's not acceptable to me.  I'm taking my business elsewhere."  
"I WAS WAITING FOR THE MACHINE! "  she lamely attempts to defend.
"You were on the phone instead of doing what you should have been doing."
"Go ahead.  I don't care.  That's all you need to know right there."

.......and now you're up to date, back at the top of the review.

WAIT!  I forgot to tell you about what happened last time:

I go for a late lunch, and I'm after a Falafel sandwich, easy enough.
Into a near empty dining room walks your humble narrator, and there's no one waiting in line at all, since it's 1 ish already.  
A single patron is waiting at the counter for his food, engaged in personal conversation with our villain, Mrs Rude.

As I stand patiently behind Chatty Customer Man, Mrs Rude makes no effort to wrap it up or otherwise acknowledge me as a waiting customer, despite having already made indisputable eye contact.  

"Shit, Did they just change subjects?!?" I'm thinking to myself, as I make the Universal Signal for depicting the perfect combination of Hunger and Readiness at a food ordering counter -- I caused my keys to jingle in my hands.  

I literally stood at an empty counter while they chatted for a full minute and a half before I decided to turn and begin walking away.
I didn't rush, since there were a few Mother-May-I-Giant-Steps between me and the exit, and I would have gladly turned back if called upon.

But she let me go, and now I know why.

Mr Gyro doesn't need my business.
Mr Gyro doesn't need your business.

And if Mrs Rude does, in fact, speak on behalf of the entire ownership of Mr Gyro, well, then I guess 

Mr Gyro doesn't even WANT our business.   So be it.

***The food at Charlie Palmer's Aureole varied from okay to below average; I think you could have a decent meal here but probably not a great one***

Aureole definitely feels like a restaurant that might have been great when it first opened (though the standards and food quality are not there now).  The restaurant itself is nice.  The space goes beyond high ceilings with a massive glass wine tower.  The dining area is nice--it is contemporary and elegant (with white tablecloth) and there are big windows that provide a view of the outside greens.

In terms of the menu, there are two tasting menus (a seasonal tasting menu and a parallel tasting menu, which presents a primary ingredient in two separate preparations on the same plate).  There is also an a la carte menu (with some nice sounding dishes).

I had the parallel tasting menu because it sounded like an intriguing concept.  There were definitely bright spots, but there were also some average to below average courses (from the concept not being great to begin with or poor cooking of the ingredients and thus not yielding the appropriate flavor/texture).  Here is the rundown on the tasting menu:

(Roasted baby beets, tangerines, herb cheese, bourbon maple syrup) This dish was good.  I really liked the flavorful and juicy beets as well as the creamy and lightly tangy cheese.  The tangerines were just okay (not as vibrant as they could have been).

(Golden beet panna cotta, cured salmon, tangerine lace) The golden beet panna cotta was creamy and did have a mild beet flavor.  The cured salmon was okay in terms of flavor, but I would have preferred more freshness and moistness.

(Diver scallop, white asparagus and scallop terrine, wild mushrooms, asparagus, yuzu froth, trout roe) I thought the scallop was good.  It was very fresh and moist and had a good outside sear (though it was a tad salty).  A lot of times, froths/foams taste of nothing, but the yuzu froth here was surprisingly strong.  With the slight saltiness of the scallop and the strong yuzu flavor, this dish was not as light as it should have been.

The asparagus terrine was okay--I was not a fan of the gelatin-like texture and I thought it kind of tasted of nothing.  The garnishes of wild mushrooms, roe and asparagus were fine.

(White asparagus, crispy Serrano ham, black peppercorn gastrique) I like how white asparagus pulls apart like green onions and these were a good representation of that (nicely cooked).  The Serrano ham was crispy and salty.  Like the scallops, I felt this dish should have been lighter in flavor.

(Roasted Niman Ranch pork tenderloin, wrinkle potatoes, grilled baby leek, romesco sauce) This was a very below average dish.  The pork tenderloin was visibly overcooked and it was quite dry.  The sides and romesco sauce were not bad (the wrinkle purple potatoes were nice and tender), but they were not great either.

(Pork sausage, crispy rock shrimp, steamed bun, cucumber salad) This dish seemed way too close to its Asian/Vietnamese basis.  The flavors and fragrances were okay, but I think you could get a much more flavorful and fragrant dish at a good Vietnamese restaurant.

The only element that really stood out was the crispy rock shrimp--very moist but also a light and crispy outside.

(Ginger beignets, poached strawberries, lychee sorbet, lime rind) The ginger beignets were very disappointing.  They were filled with a ginger custard.  And because of this, the kitchen had to probably chill the beignets.  Unfortunately, the beignets were not evenly warm.  They were half cold, which was disappointing (especially when you think beignet, you think something hot, light and fluffy).

The lychee sorbet was cool and refreshing and I really liked the lime rind (small but very strong in flavor).

(Coconut ginger vacherin, braised pineapple, vanilla Chantilly, meringue) This dessert was okay.  The vacherin was creamy and cool.  It was filled with pineapple and there was more of a pineapple flavor than a ginger flavor.  While I thought the dessert was kind of a standard dessert, I really liked the braised pineapple (sweet and not too tart), which looked like ginger.

There was also an assortment of below average complimentary bread.

In terms of service, the food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.  I thought the female servers were more personable and pleasant than my main male server (who was still polite).

For a fine dining place with a notable chef backing it, the price for their parallel tasting menu was not as high as other similar Vegas spots.  The food was disappointing though and given the lack of quality, it felt overpriced.

Aureole may have once been a good fine dining spot, but I am not sure if you can get a great meal here now.  If there was more attention to detail (and better cooking/preparation of the ingredients), you might be able to get at the very least a decent meal here.

Aureole is located in Mandalay Bay (free parking structure).

If you are looking for a really good Italian beef sandwich, you will find it here. Hubby and I stopped here for dinner and left full and satisfied. The inside is clean and there are plenty of tables. The employees were friendly and went over some of the menu items with us. They have Italian sausage, wraps, char-grilled burgers, hot dogs, salads, chili, tamales and fries, but my first time I had to try what they are famous for.

So, I ordered an "Italian Beef Sandwich" (regular Al) priced at $6.35 and added provolone and hot peppers for 50 cents each topping as well asked for the sandwich to be dipped. The bread really held up everything in it very well. Napkins are required when eating this sandwich dipped! The beef was tender and had good flavor and the peppers added a nice flavor to the sandwich. I also ordered a small "Cheddar Cheese Fries" priced at $3.85 and just thought they were average. Next time I am going to try them with different toppings. I liked that my food was made fresh in front of me. There isn't a drive-thru here, but if you are on a time crunch you can phone in your order for pick-up.

Let me preface this review by saying that I take eating pretty damn seriously, especially when I travel outside of my local area.  I "train" for the trip like any athlete would for a big game. I do weeks of research (no, seriously), read reviews, examine menus, even ask friends for feedback just to ensure I compile a more than awesome list of MUST EATS during my trip.

Anyway, with the bevy of gastropubs and burger joints Vegas has to offer, Gordon Ramsay's BurGR wasn't even a speck on my radar.  GRB didn't pique my interest until a friend said they made their burgers with deckle-meat. Deckle-meat..the buttery, fatty, extra marbly outskirts of that delicious ribeye.GRB quickly made it to the top 3 on my hitlist. 

So after having somewhat dieted all day -- told you I took these experiences seriously- I was more than prepared to sink my teeth into one of these burgers. 

The restaurant itself isn't anything notable. Orange-themed and contemporary, down to the silverware. Service was fine, attentive and friendly. 

The menu isn't so lengthy that you would need to spend 20 minutes deciding on an order, BUT all the options appeared so appetizing that it certainly took about 17 minutes to finally come to some decisions. My boo is very steak and potatoes, doesn't deviate much from culinary fundamentals.  He ordered the American burger, added bacon I believe.  Since I knew I would be able to steal a few bites, I got the fresh roasted chili dog. And yes, I did order this a bit for the shock value since I had seen yelp photos of this particular item. Our buddy got himself the farm burger which is something I would have ordered if I wasn't so interested in that hotdog. We also got regular and truffle parm fries.

We also got shakes. Man did we get shakes. If I were to pick only one item off this menu and nothing else, I would get a shake from here. i used to walk all the way to cosmo for a Holstein's shake but the GRB shakes are exponentially better. Like to the umpteenth power.  I got myself the coffee shake with hazelnut pudding, which I killed in literally 2 minutes. I couldn't keep my hands off it. It was a freakish newfound addiction. Our friend got the Oreo and creme brulee shake which was just as sinfully, almost painfully delicious. 

Our food came and the burgers were juicy, rich and what you would expect from the deckle claim. Although since it was thrown into ground beef, it didn't impart a noticeably different flavor.  Burgers were also on the smaller end of the spectrum especially given the higher price point.  My man enjoyed the hotdog more than I did. Other than the hotdog length far exceeding the bun, it wasn't memorable.   The truffle parm fries were piping hot and very generous on the toppings. Wish the fries were cut slightly thinner to lessen their density. 

Overall, we were quite satisfied with our meals.  I may even venture to say that I enjoyed it more than Holstein's.  Dang those shakes really got me.

Tucked away in the strip mall, this small Cuban bakery has been overlooked and undervalued by many who don't frequent the area or knows very little about the cuisine. Once inside, there are only six small tables. The red tablecloths, glass dessert counter, tiled floors, and bright natural lighting coming through the doors nicely accentuated the dcor. Fellow Yelper Kurdy S and I were the only non-Spanish speaking customers during this afternoon. Like many of the nearby restaurants, the atmosphere was fitting as a casual lunch spot.

For appetizer, we shared the Tostones Rellenos de Roja Villeja ($4.49). The plate came with four fried green plantains holding a small scoop of tender shredded beef on top. The plantains had great texture on the outside to add to the soft green banana flavor on the inside. The beef was tender, flavorful, complex, and very nicely seasoned. I can eat these all day long.

We also had a side order of Plantanos Maduro Fritos ($2.49) that came with soft bananas served piping hot, perfectly fried, and sweet. It was nicely glazed, but also unexpectedly oily. 

Next, the Cuban Sandwich ($6.95) came with shredded beef, ham, and mustard. The bread had an awesome crunch with an excellent secondary chew. The sandwich was big enough to share and the dish also came with French fries. The way they kept it simple without all the fillers made this one of the best Cuban Sandwiches I've had so far.

Finally, the Filete a la Plancha ($9.99) came with a big serving of grilled sole, black bean rice, and salad. The sole was fresh, moist, tender, and had good flavor but slightly over salted. The black bean rice had great flavor and moisture--much better than the one at Victor's 1959 Caf. The lightly dressed salad provided a nice change of pace to the sole.

Antithetical to the cuisine's longstanding stereotype of being bland, this place simply rocks. Service however, was friendly but also inattentive, offbeat, and at times awkward. For instance, the food and bill took forever to come, and our water was never refilled even though the restaurant was not busy. Despite the shortcomings, interested diners should still come for the impressive lineup of dishes and great prices. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their other seafood and chicken items followed by their great looking desserts.

La Perla Caf is family owned/operated and has been around for YEARS. I went there with my wife Carol for dinner. 

Carol got the #23 combo (Tostada, enchilada & a taco) she totally devoured her meal so I know she liked it. When she was done there was nothing left on her plate. 

I got the Cimichanga dinner w/ rice and refried beans. My entre was mouthwatering scrumptious. It was well-prepared, flavorful and came out sizzling hot. OMG, the food is SO GOOD here, all the way down to their terrific salsa!  Every bite of it was just stellar!

Outstanding Mexican comfort food. Excellent service from Sandra, our waitress. This place is has excellent food and the prices are reasonable in addition the quality is top notch.

One of the other greatest parts of the meal was the 3 different salsas they serve with their home made chips. They come in small carafes with the food.  All three salsa were extremely flavorful in a way totally unique to La Perla Caf. Their salsa unlike most places is less spicy and more flavorful. Its also not so thick. 

If you love Mexican food you really owe it to yourself to check out La Perla. 

FOOD: Top quality Mexican food - MUY DELICIOSO!!! SERVICE: The people are very nice, helpful and caring. They truly want you to enjoy the food they make for you. PRICE: Comparable to other Mexican restaurants.  AMBIANCE: Rustic western steakhouse atmosphere. CONCLUSION: AMAZING FAMILY OWED MEXICAN RESTAURANT! A truly wonderful establishment. I cant believe how long its been around and how nice and hospitable everyone there was. I love supporting independent, family run business.  Props to La Perla Caf for staying authentic through the years. If you love Mexican food definitely  visit this restaurant. RETURN FACTOR 100%. 

************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************

5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!

2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.

We are big fans of OTFM!

We had been going to the Phoenix Downtown Market on Saturdays for a year + now & love it. It's just a bit of a hike for us. We also participated in Maya's Farm's CSA the last go around & have been missing our market visits.

Well, we've been going religiously to OTFM now for some time & pretty much cannot miss it.

It just continues to get better & better (and more & more crowded).

McClendon Farms has a big spread there & the produce is awesome. They have enough variety that we don't even have to supplement produce purchases with supermarket visits at all.

My other favorite thing about OTFM is that they have GREAT food.

Highlights for me:

-Payton Curry is typically there (some representative of Digestif always is) & has killer dishes. We've had awesome chili, wonderful frittatas & even fresh hand pulled mozzarella with bagna cauda (which is probably our new favorite find of the past several months).

-Tracey Dempsey (desert genius of assorted Kasperski spots) is there & has wonderful creations. She typically has a great offering from Cowboy Ciao as well.

-Chrysa Kaufman & Rancho Pinot are there showcasing McClendon produce. Whatever they have flat out rocks. I've had amazing sandwiches there every time, unbelievable bean & sausage soup & about 50 glasses of meyer lemonade (the kids help).

The other absolute must for us is the bread by the Phoenician folks. They have a chocolate cherry sourdough which is insane. Pairs wonderfully with red wine & coffee (so it's easy to do twice in a day). Their other breads are awesome too.

That's enough for me to already be a win. I absolutely love that the chefs of some of the great local independent spots were there chatting & interacting with the community. Makes me doubly want to patronize their restaurants. It seems as if the chefs are pairing up with local farms as well.

Other faves: 

-The tamale folks from Downtown Market are there with their excellent product. Unfortunately, they don't focus much on food sales on the spot but more on frozen packets for home.  We love their tamales (especially their chicken/mole).

-There is a hot dog stand using Vienna Beef & doing Chicago style dogs with sport peppers, celery salt & all. Food is good but be prepared to wait.

-There is also an interesting looking huge BBQ smoker which I need to try. Heard it was great from some folks we talked to.

-Maya's Farm is there. Produce looked great.

-There was an interesting vegan desert stall which was quite yummy that we'll be checking out more closely as well (dairy/egg allergic kids).

-Several artisan bread stalls...

And throughout the day, they also have live music which gives it a nice vibe.

Was bummed Tortillas Rosario isn't there any longer. Hopefully they'll return as they were there early on. 

Excited that Seacat Gardens will also be coming back soon!

Have also heard Sweet Republic will have a presence soon which we'll be totall psyched for.

Fresh eggs are scarce. We've been too late but have heard that Maya & the goat lady have eggs. Definitely something that they need more of.

They also do the write your order down on a card & go pay at a central location type thing like Downtown Phoenix Market as well but there are a couple vendors who only take cash.

If you need it, there is an ATM just north of 1st street on Brown (west side of the street) - I needed it.

Anyway, for us, it's by far our favorite farmers market in town!

My friends....I think I've died and gone to Tapas Heaven....seriously.  The Better Half and I were at the Hard Rock and decided to check out Johnny Smalls.  You can imagine the look on our face when we saw the sign that said $19.99 AYCE....seriously, check out the pics.  We thought there was a catch and asked the hostess.  She said, no joke it's $19.99 per person.  You didn't have to ask us twice.....they were packed, so we were forced to saddle up to the bar and eat there instead of a table.  No big deal, we enjoy doing that from time to time.

We were looking over the menu, which has a ton of items to choose from, and the bartender gave us the ground rules.....it's simple.  Each person gets to order 2 Tapas, if you finish both plates you can order 2 more, it stops when you stop finishing your plate.  If you decide you want to order more food and you didn't finish your last order, you have to pay full price for the Tapas plate.....seems fair to me.

Since the average price per Tapas is around $7, each person needs to order at least 3 Tapas to be "in the money".....aka "get your money's worth".

I was starving, so I knew I was going to eat my money's worth.  Here's a breakdown of each round of Tapas (see pics):

Round 1
Crab & Artichoke Dip (Creamy Cheese, Lump Crab, 'Junk Basket' Chips)
Tempura Green Beans (Tempura Battered, Thai Chili Sauce)
Philly-ish (Warm Flat Iron Steak, Chipotle Mayo, Roasted Peppers, Farmstead White Cheddar)
Chili Dogs (Mini Pinks, Kobe Chili)

Round 2
Small Balls (Creamy Risotto, Shortribs, Parmesan Fondue)
Jack & Coke (Kobe Beef, Sweet Whiskey Cola, Pancetta)
Nuttin' Honey (Battered Rock Shrimp, Honey-Walnut Glaze, Candied Walnuts)
Octapussy (Tapioca Battered Calamari, Basil, Candied Orange)

Round 3
Shorty (Braised Short Ribs, Baked Apple Chips, Sage, Savory Virgin Oil)
Tuscan Pizza (esto Base, Fresh Mozzarella, Marinated Tomatoes, Roasted Peppers, Balsamic Vinaigrette)

Everything was excellent except the Chili Dogs (kind of plain & bland).

***TIP*** - The Pizzas are pretty big for Tapas.  Order it last if you want to sample a lot of Tapas so you won't get full early in the meal.

Over the course of the meal, we ordered 3 glasses of Merlot ($9 ea) and we were able to keep the bill to $72.41 plus a $15 tip, $87.41 total damage.  Not bad for a night out at the Hard Rock!

Will I return?  Hell yeah!  Return Factor - 100%

The last place we went to before leaving Vegas was First... and yes, we ended up saving the best for last! If you want to be a complete glutton, and get the most bang for your buck, you must put First on your list of restaurants to hit up in Vegas.

It's only been open for about two months, so we actually just stumbled upon it while we were on our way out of The Shoppes at Palazzo. We were drawn in by the really cool space, and their touch screen menu outside posted extremely appealing inexpensive gourmet comfort food options. Once inside, we got seated at one of the large booths looking out onto the Strip, so we had a perfect view of the pirate show across the street at TI. 

Instead of plain old bread, we were brought pretzels that came with three dipping sauces. If you want, they offer a $5 cheese fondue to go with it. Our server, Carolyn, was awesome, and gave us recommendations on the food and drinks. We decided to start off with the Mojito Lamb Chops which were topped with Mint glaze, 151 and lime and torched at the table. We were impressed with the three thick cuts, and they were perfectly medium-rare. For entrees, I had the wide papardelle pasta with a heaping portion of forest mushrooms in a delicious truffle butter sauce. My guy had the Sesame Miso Glazed Salmon topped with seaweed salad on a bed of sticky rice, which was fantastic. The presentation was beautiful and the salmon was nice and flaky. For dessert, we indulged in the chocolate bar (which tasted like a 100 Grand as an ice cream bar) and the donut sundae... mmm... donut. 

For cocktails, I highly recommend the Cotton Candy Kiss (Grey Goose, elderflower, vanilla, pineapple, cranberry), especially if you're a sweet tooth. It's such a pretty cocktail, and even the presentation is lovely! The martini glass is rimmed with crushed Life Savers and comes with a blue fluff of cotton candy. The liquor is poured over it when it's brought to the table. 

The awesome thing is that they are open late, and I mean really late. They have a special late night menu from 1am-4am Sun-Wed and 1am-6am Th-Sat.

This place would be amazing in the Mission in SF -- foodie hipsters would flock here... I hope they open one up there!!

I've been anticipating SLS opening their doors and now I'm sadly disappointed. 

Staff: The dealers at the tables were very friendly and welcoming. I agree with other reviewers that there are way too many employees standing around doing nothing but chatting with one another. We walked around and saw groups of 3 or more employees just leaning against the wall talking. Other than the dealers no other staff member said hello or went out of their way to acknowledge guests and seemed engrossed in their own conversations. 

Cleanliness: The amount of trash and dirt was astounding. The carpets were covered with cigarette ash and bits of junk. Either they don't have enough people cleaning or they don't seem to care to clean up. Maybe the staff that just stand around talking could take pride in their own establishment and pitch in. There were half empty glasses left out in the bars from the night before. Walking around and seeing that the bars left dirty things overnight was such a turnoff. The bathrooms had toilet paper strewn about all over the floor and the trash was piled high in the baskets. Plus the janitorial staff left piles of plastic bags of trash outside the bathroom entrance. 

The Griddle: We went here for breakfast and had to wait over 15 minutes to be seated when 2/3 of tables were empty. The line of people outside couldn't stop complaining about how poorly the 4 (yes, 4) hostesses were handling the seating. When asked about the hold-up their response was that the staff was going through a shift change.    After being seated it took a few minutes before anyone came by with water. Then, it took a few more minutes before our server came by. Another server brought someone else's food to our table and then my boyfriend's meal was brought first and it took over 5 more minutes for my food to come out. When we finished our meal about an hour later and walked out of the restaurant at about 9am the line to get in went around the corner and the staff must still have been going through a shift change because there were loads of empty tables inside. 

Spa: We wanted to check out the spa but an unfriendly guard brusquely told us that only guests can go to the spa. I don't know how the spa will do if their only clientele comes from the hotel. You would think that they would want more business. All the other spas on the strip welcome outside guests. 

I noticed that a lot of people who left positive reviews had specifically attended the grand opening party. I would imagine that in the hype of the event everything seemed great but during the day and to an average visitor this place is just a huge flop. Disappointing.

***Todd English PUB offers many entrees that are not that expensive when compared to other celebrity chef backed Vegas restaurants, but the food was mediocre; I will probably seek out Todd English's Olives (The Bellagio) instead on my next Vegas trip***

We were in Las Vegas and were looking for a decent but still reasonably priced dinner spot so we decided to head to Todd English PUB.  I was impressed with Todd English's food at the LA Food & Wine Festival and had high hopes for this one (even though I knew that Todd English PUB was going to be much more casual and simple fare).

The atmosphere was very raucous.  It very much had a gastropub feel and it was quite loud.  There was also a seating area outside with heat lamps (unfortunately, since Todd English PUB is located in a congested area, you have to deal with several smokers nearby).

The menu consisted of a wide variety of food from several fried appetizers to burgers and sandwiches as well as some English pub grub like fish and chips and bangers and mash.

We started with the ahi tuna on wonton crackers, which was the best dish of the night.  While expensive, the starter was good.  The ahi tuna was nicely mixed with seaweed and gingered sesame vinaigrette.  The tuna mixture sat on light and crispy fried wontons.  The tuna was fresh.  It was also quite spicy.

I also had the bangers and mash.  The mashed potatoes were good.  They were very light for mashed potatoes and had a good flavor.  They kind of reminded me of the mashed potatoes at Nick & Stef's in Downtown LA.  The bangers were quite bland though.  They were moist enough, but they had very little flavor.  They sat on a creamy mustard sauce, which was also bland.

I tried some of my friend's fries, which were just okay (a little soft).  My friend mentioned that the fish and chips were bland.

Service was decent.  The staff was friendly, but it was hard to flag down our waiter at times (which is a common problem when you eat outside and the outside dining area is not that connected to the inside dining area).

Prices were not too bad for Las Vegas.  There were several entrees below $20.  However, for the quality of food, you can find better gastropub food in other cities at similar or lower prices.

Though we liked the ahi tuna on wonton crackers, the entrees were very disappointing and I am not sure if the other entrees would be any better.  I did like the little sampling of Todd English's food at the LA event (and he is a very charming, funny and smart guy), but I think his more upscale Olives in The Bellagio is probably a better representation of his skills in the kitchen.

Todd English PUB is located right next to Aria.  Aria has its own free parking structure and it is easy to find a space (valet parking is also available).

If at first you don't get in, try, try again! This is what I told myself after visiting the first time on a Saturday night only to learn that it was a three-hour wait for a bay (the private golf areas). The next time we tried to visit, we came at a down time and luckily scored a bay right away! I'm so excited to see a place like Top Golf come to the Valley. My only question is, what took them so long and why don't other fun entertainment spots like this open up more often!? 

Golfer or not, this is a really fun time and it's family-friendly so Mom & Dad can have a cocktail while the children play! It's like a driving range meets a bar meets a golf arcade. Now, if you are a golfer, you might never want to leave and if you aren't a golfer, this might kick start you into wanting to play. We had a lot of fun and can't wait to continue to visit, especially when the weather cools down!

Here's how it works. 

1. First time you visit, you will go to the check-in counter and buy a card for $5. This card will serve as your license to golf and that means you can bypass the first counter on your next visit. You will also pay for the first hour which varies in price depending on the time of day: $25 an hour (total, not per person) from open until Noon, $35 an hour from Noon-5 and $45 an hour from 5:00 until close. 

2. After you've signed up and purchase your card and first hour, they send you over to the concierge where they will set you up with your bay or put you on a wait-list depending on the time of day. 

3. Now that you're set up, you can head over to your bay and start to play. The bay comes with golf clubs and a private area with couches and misters so even if you don't want to play, you can still hang out and watch! 

4. The bays run by the hour, so when your hour is up, you can pay for another half hour or hour right at your bay, making it easy (and pricey!)

5. You will get your own server at your bay and they offer a full bar and full menu of tasty food.

*** If you just want to come and drink, they also have a full bar set-up so you don't have to rent a bay. ****


Tips:

1. If you're a golfer, you can bring your own clubs. 

2. If you like to play with a glove, bring it with you. 

3. Wear comfortable clothes. 

4. You don't need golf shoes but I suggest you wear closed toed shoes. I played in flip flops and it wasn't very fun. 

5. If you don't want to play golf, you can still hang out with your friends in the bay while they play.

I have been waiting for sweets raku to be opened since a year ago. I visited this place with my husband on the second week after grand opening. We came here with full stomach and high expectation after dinner. I have to say it was worth the wait! We shared the pre-fixed menu ($19) and ordered momo (peach) and champagne rose tea ($6). (FYI, they charge $5 additional for sharing pre-fixed menu and $7 extra for dessert wine pairing !) We had seating at the desert bar and got to see how the magic happened. It was quite a show to see how pastry chef assembled all the pastries into art. 

Amuse - Mango sorbet with mint jelly and leaf
I never had mango with mint together before. I was surprised how well these two flavors went together, Sorbet had a thick texture, and I felt like I had real mango in my mouth. Mint jelly kinda refresh my palate in the end.

Marriage - sponge cake with banana cream and strawberries
I liked this dish a lot! Sponge cake tasted really moist and soft. Banana cream has just right amount of sweetness. 

Apollo - Chocolate and framboise mousse cake
I loved the earl grey ice cream on top of the this chocolate mousse cake. It was definitely the highlight of this dish. Also, the strawberry rice stick was very airy and delish!

Petits Fours - mini lava cake
lava cake was super chocolatey and went very well with raisins and passion fruit marshmallows. 

Our waitress told me that we have the option to order a la carte and it would be $12 each dish. It would definitely be a good option for people just want to have little sweet ending after a full meal from other restaurants. She also told me that sweets raku is gonna change their menu next week. (new items like apple pie and chestnut cream cake... and maybe foie gras dishes) I got really excited after hearing that!! Everyone knows me knows how much I love foie gras hahaaa!! Next time, I will come back to try their cheese plate with dessert wine pairing (illiskillin ice wine) and maybe foie gras dishes!!!!

While other restaurants market themselves as being different, Bazaar Meat delivers the goods. With a massive menu -- physically heavier than most and with more variety of items than other steakhouses -- this place really is unique. As soon as I learned their opening date I snagged reservations for our party of four. I'm typically weary of new restaurants, but as a fan of Jose Andres I had to give it a shot.

From beginning to end our meal was outstanding. To start, a dozen oysters ($34) -- six medium sized, briny and meaty Paradise oysters and six small, more mild Kusshi oysters. There are four types of tartares on the menu. The classic ($24) is prepared tableside and served with parker house rolls. Don't be afraid to make yourself a steak tartare slider, I did and it was fantastic.

The list of starters is where Andres' influence is most evident with items like cotton candy foie gras, tacos, chicharron, and croquetas. The dish that jumped out at me, though, was the s'mores ($30). Four to an order. Each with wafer thin graham crackers sandwiching slivers of chocolate, velvety smooth and rich foie, and torched and blistered hunks of marshmallow. Try to stay composed after eating one. It's impossible. They're so good you'll be banging the table or letting some expletives fly out of shear amazement. They are sweet, so next time I might consider getting them as a dessert.

Side dishes are delicious as well. Andres takes a playful jab at Joel Robuchon's pomme puree with his own rendition of mashed potatoes ($15) with a menu description that reads, "butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes." On the lighter side are the Brussels sprouts petals ($12), served with grapes, apricots, lemon air, and lemon puree. My favorite side was the baby corn ($13). Grilled and topped with mayo, chile piquin, and popcorn powder it's the perfect combo of heat and sweetness.

Our group shared the Spanish-style bone-in rib eye ($80/lb) from Washugyu Ranch, Oregon. It's cooked on their Josper grill (part oven, part grill. Google it. I had to and it looks cool.) using charcoal and grape leaves, giving it plenty of smokiness. It isn't cheap at $80 a pound. Our steak came in at 3.13 pounds, which equals an empty wallet at the end of the night. But, it's one of the best I've had in town. 

Desserts are on the small side. They're about the size of single serving buffet desserts.  We ordered ten ($25) consisting of five different types served in a cute bakery-style box. The order: dark chocolate and olive oil cream puff; dark chocolate and aged rum cake; caramelized puff pastry with bacon, strawberries and cream; milk chocolate peanut, and caramel tart; and caramelized puff pastry with chocolate, caramel and sea salt. All were great, particularly the dark chocolate cake and the bacon and strawberry puff pastry.

Service was exceptional all night. Our server (formerly of L'Atelier) and busser offered great recommendations and checked in frequently to make sure all of our needs were met. The only negative is that their dessert menu didn't list all ingredients for the dishes. My friend, who has a nut allergy, reacted to hazelnuts in the dark chocolate and aged rum cake forcing her to rush home after dinner for allergy medicine. Luckily, she was fine and we had a fantastic meal. Bazaar Meat might be the new kid on the block, but in my book they're already one of the top three steak houses in Vegas.

Fast forward due to yelps word limit. 

The table that came nearly 15 minutes after is has received their meal. I know my timing is accurate as I have been watching my clock on my phone the entire time. We were trying to be out of there by 3:15 so that we could make the Roos n More zoo benefit at Zappos. It was already 3:15. We arrived at 2pm. We have not received our entrees yet.

The hostess, who is also running food, walks by and we ask her is she has an idea of how much longer we need to wait for our food. Her demeanor changes. Condescendingly, she tells us "they serve quality food here and it takes time". I have dined at Joel Robuchon on more than one occasion. That restaurant has three Michelin stars, and their food does not take anywhere near this long to prepare. How could french toast, a grilled cheese and a fish sandwich be expected to take this long? I'm pescetarian. I cook fish every day. Even if it is being prepared via sous-vide, it should take no longer than 30 minutes. Bewildered, I repeat that we have waited nearly 50 minutes. The hostess raises her eyebrows puts her index finger to her lips and "shush's" us. She actually hisses and then angrily reminds us that we are seated next to their "investors" and tells us to say things quietly so that their precious "investors" don't hear.

My girlfriend did not respond very well to that. Loudly, she tells the hostess that she will not be quiet and that the investors they are so worried about should probably hear what we are talking about. With a panicked look on her face, the girl threateningly replies "You want me to go and get the manager?Because I will go and get George!" Without waiting for a response, she does, in fact, get George. In retrospect, I respect her for subtly warning us what we were in for.

Clearly displeased to have his feeding session interrupted. The manager finishes enjoying a few fries from his plate before coming by. He lumbers over, still masticating, crumbs spewing from his lips as he attempts to swallow the large quantity of deep fried potatoes visibly struggling to find their way down his esophagus. Uninvited, he takes a seat opposite us. The fish and french toast arrive. The grilled cheese is nowhere in sight. 

"So, what's going on?" 
We told him our food arrived after waiting nearly 50 minutes. He told us that it's our fault because we ordered the fish. And fish takes a very long time to cook. Incredulously, I informed him that fish is the quickest cooking of every animal protein source. I asked him if he ever cooked before. 

Then he proudly, and very defensively informed us that he "owns this place". Next, this rather large man points at my 100 pound girlfriend and instructs her to "just sit down and enjoy the meal. It's the best fish you're ever going to have in your life." 

The grilled cheese arrives. 

My girlfriend did not appreciate being bossed around and dismissed as though her complaint had no merit. In fact, I believe this is the turning point in which we both became visibly enraged. I was confused, my entire body was shaking with rage, and I was fighting back tears.She told the manager that he had no right to tell her what to do, and that she would not just sit down and enjoy the meal. The manger responded "So leave then!" My girlfriend responded with a resounding "Oh, we will." 

Horrified, the entire restaurant, precious "investors" included, stared at us, jaws slack, eyes filled with pity. Realizing an opportunity to twist the situation and make us the bad guy, he demanded we pay for the meal we did not even stick a fork into and insinuated that we were creating a scene in order to get something for free. My girlfriend happily agreed to pay, and directly called him out on accusing us of not having the money to pay the bill. He then barked at the bartender to come and process her debit card. While waiting for the card to go through, my girlfriend turned to the horrified "investors" and apologized for disturbing their meal by making a scene.She mentioned that they should reconsider investing in a business that is owned by someone so classless and unprofessional. One woman, with empathy in her eyes said it was okay, and they all looked like they felt for us. Interrupting her apology, the manager insisted that they are not investors. My girlfriend insisted that every person on their staff said they were investors and thats why we had to sit at the lounge tables instead of a real table for lunch. Failing to find anything rational to say, the manager/owner then demanded to know where I work so that he could come in and complain at my job, like we did at his. He proceeded to yell at us and tell us we are a "bunch of a**holes" amongst other unnecessarily profane things for creating a scene. As we were walking out, he yelled at us to never come back. 
I told him to go f*** himself. 

This happened because we asked why our food was taking so long.

We asked. Asked NICELY. And we're met with this response

After spending the morning at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center, I typed into my cell phone "Where is a unique place to have lunch near the Phoenix Indian Medical Center?" and sent the text to KGB (542542). As we ventured into the hot sun, I recieved my answer...Sacred Hogan Navajo Frybread

*ding!* one of the few Native American resturants in the city that I HAVEN'T reviewed yet!! Let's go!! After lunch plans with one of my favorite Navajos fell through - I guess a Navajo Taco would suffice! :P 

We entered the blue and white tiled room and were met by a very tired Navajo girl who spoke of problems with the DMV throughout our meal. We sat down and took it all in, the small glass case with bottles of hot sauce, pottery and earrings for sale; the pepsi frige that held nothing but Shasta soda. Uber rez! lol and the lack of a public restroom (BOO!!)

I ordered a double Navajo burger and my mom got the Pima Taco (beans are crushed  as opposed to the Navajo tacos where the beans are whole) and two teas. We sat down and waited for our tea, which, to our annoyance, didn't come until our food did. We asked for ketchup and salsa and the hot sauce was NOT good. I have no idea what the heck that stuff was... but it wasn't cute. They would've been better off opening up a can of El Pato or Tapitio than dispensing that stuff. I think it was bad. The ketchup was good though! :P 

The food itself... was meh. Nothing great. I didn't really read the menu, or I would have noticed that the burgers come with roasted green chilis... something I'm not a fan of... but I chose to just go with it and eat it anyway. The chili brought a nice kick to things. The burger itself was just a burger, it needed something... like CHEESE! I love cheese! :P 

The bread was kind of tough... and obviously Navajo... made with the superfind Blue Bird Flour which is like GOLD in the Navajo Rez... women LITTERALLY make dresses out of their cloth Blue Bird Flour sacks! And I could tell they used powdered milk in their recipe, when the edges are significatly thick it's the milk reacting to the hot oil. When the dough is fried when fresh... it creates an awesome fluffy affect... but at Sacred Hogan, there were cracks and flakes on one side of the bread which means that the dough was left out in the elements and not kept covered and moist... which is kind of gross... the dough gets hard and when fried creates these little tiles that are hard and the rest of the dough loses moisture which makes the bread lose its flaky goodness. 

My mom wasn't thrilled with her Pima Taco... as a Pima, I guess she oughta know what its supposed to be like! She said it was okay, but the salsa made it not so good. She prefers the light crispiness of FBH, so do I. the ONE thing I like about this place is their lunch special... they will make half a taco, of your choice... for $5!! That's pretty rad! 

To my yelpers, I say skip this place. The tables were dirty and grimey and not in a good way... where its part of the ambiance, like Carolina's. The staff stared at us the entire time we ate and complained about their personal problems. The food took over 20 minutes to make and the worst food crime... they brought back the MONSTROSITY that is the Indian Dessert!!

WTF?! No one eats like this on the rez!! NO ONE!! If you want to loose some toes, eat this fucking thig! A whole frybread, topped with a scoop of ice cream, chocolate syrup and cinna-sugar! That is disgusting... i'm sorry. it's gross! These flavors cannot possible be good!! If you want a nice dessert, JUST get a plain bread with EAITHER honey OR powdered sugar!! GEEZ!

To answer Mr. K's question... The FBH uses a simpler recipe of flour, salt, baking powder & very hot water. It's hyper use of baking powder creates it crispiness... and Navajos are not as liberal with their baking powder and some use powdered milk which creates a thicker more rich frybread. Both tribes typically use crisco veggie oil or shortening to fry their bread in, but some of the old timers still prefer good ol' fashioned lard! Navajo frybread is usually smaller in diameter, where as O'odham bread is usually larger, but thinner... ummm... think of Navajos as the chicago deep dish of Frybread... and O'odham as the New York thin crust of frybread!

Thanks again yelp and yelpers with helping me to discover yet another obscure but amazing find Cop Out Pierogies!  I had just received my weekly email about places around the burg focused on Dumplings, particularly pierogies.  Growing up in and around the burg it is just about inconceivable that you didn't eat these plump pillows of carbs at least on a few occasions.  I always preferred the homemade to Mrs. T though she drives a hard bargain since honestly pierogies may not be the most complicated thing to make; they are certainly very laborious and somewhat complicated to get perfect.  When I say perfect I mean the taste and texture as no two homemade dumplings look alike.

Cop Out Pierogies can be found on Butler St in Etna which was very close to my work though I didn't know of its existence until the email arrived in my inbox.  I spoke to a couple of co-workers that week and decided that Friday we were going to get some takeout.  There are a couple things to keep in mind before heading to Cop Out Pierogies.  They are only open on Friday and Saturday for a few hours.  They are also cash only, so hit the ATM before you set out to get your fix.  Lastly, and perhaps this is a personal problem, I found it a little tricky to find them.  Etna is about as small as you can get but if you don't go there often you may pass it up once or twice before finding it.

I and my co-workers all ordered the same pierogies the potato/cheese/and jalapeno.  For a dozen they give you 14, not too shabby!  I also got a pint of Haluski.  The price for the pierogies does increase if you have them cook them for you.  I got the understanding quickly that most people buy them frozen in large bags.  When I arrived to pick up our food, I was greeted with a line of others waiting.  I didn't have to wait too long, but as I did the cook/owner brought out a couple samples of a sweet potato pierogies for the patrons waiting or eating in the small dining area they have set up.  Nice touch to ease the pain of my empty stomach suffering even more from the wonderful smell coming from the kitchen.  So they call this joint Cop Out and as I read online the owner/cook was a sergeant with the Shaler Township Police Department.  The dcor was cute, some toy cop cars, lots of pics of the burg, some newspaper write ups that I could only imagine was of the store but I didn't get close enough to read them.  To complete this atmosphere was five on duty police officers enjoying lunch in the dining area.  

Once waited on the food came out pretty quick, paid gave my thanks and off I went back to the office to enjoy my Polish lunch, and enjoy I did!  The pierogies were sauted perfectly cooked with the creamiest smoothest texture encased inside the dumpling.  The spice from the jalapeno was nice and noticeable but definitely not overpowering.  They were in short delicious.  I could only finish half and took the rest home for dinner.  The Haluski was also very good but the pierogies stole the show for me.  Great stop if you find yourself in the area!

This place is just a couple miles away from my house, so I have been watching it like a hawk! I came in with my boyfriend on grand opening day (today), which happened to be a Monday, the only day they're suppose to be closed. The place Was fully stocked with EVERYTHING. Macarons in every color of the rainbow, different flavored flans, cakes (whole and slices), eclairs, tarts, cookies, croissants, banquettes, etc. 

We came in for pastries, but my boyfriend ended up with a sandwich combo (iced tea, French onion soup, roast beef/pesto sandwich) for $9.95. I ordered a 12oz latte ($3) and a few macarons ($1.10ea) pistachio, pistachio/chocolate, and rose. 

The soup was very flavorful. I didn't expect it to taste that great, so I was pleasantly surprised. The sandwich was a pretty generous portion, considering the combo price. You get a whole croissant with loads of meat inside. I didn't try it since I'm not a big roast beef fan, but my bf killed it pretty fast, so I'm assuming it was good. 

The espresso was nicely made considering it came from an automatic machine and it went very well with my 3 delicious macarons. The guy accidentally gave me a ginger macaron instead of my rose macaron. Luckily I really like ginger, so it was a satisfying mistake, but I only took a bite before trading it for the rose macaron! All the macarons were very fresh with a light, crisp outer layer and soft center. They all tasted exactly like you would imagine the flavor to taste. When I had a bite of the ginger, I felt like I ate a piece of the actual root! And when I ate the rose macaron, I imagined smelling a bouquet of roses. 

Overall, this place is amazing. I usually expect a few kinks when going to a brand new place, but all the food and pastries we had were amazing. This would've been a 5 star review, but I felt like the customer service wasn't equally distributed. We were sitting just two tables away from a couple that the cashier/server constantly kept checking up on and conversing with without checking up on us a single time, even after I had to exchange the macaron he mistakenly gave me. He even gave the couple some complimentary pastries (not exactly sure what they were) to try. I just feel that he should've at least checked up on us or talked to us if he was going to constantly give them special treatment.

"I rather eat like no one's watching than dance like no one's watching."  - Cristela Alonzo

I'm no cheese steak expert nor have I had an actual philly cheese steak from Philadelphia but I will say that this is a damn good sandwich.  It has everything I was looking for:  lots of meat, lots of cheese, and lots of flavor!  Great Friday night meal!

The beef is juicy, tender, and plentiful and the cheese helped glue everything together. I got the red sauce on the side since I wasn't sure what to expect but after trying it out, I will say that I'm definitely getting it on it next time.  One tiny cup just isn't enough!  That tomato sauce with oregano and other spices... Yum!  Mr. W. ran out of red sauce fast for his 12in. sandwich.  I had mine with no vegetables because I usually never finish my meal in one sitting and end up taking it home.  I figured the vegetables will fill me up too fast and I wanted to try to finish majority of it while it was still piping hot.  I will shamefully admit that I took down all 8-inches like a champ [that's what she said].  It was a feat that both impressed and scared Mr. W.  We also got our combos with the seasoned fries which were actually potato wedges.  Not bad or extraordinary but the star is definitely the sandwich with the red sauce.

This is a family-owned establishment and this is seriously the sweetest family ever.  I had a chance to talk with the boss-lady/mother and she was a delight!  The ambiance of the joint is super casual and the sound of metal cooking utensils banging on the flat-top stove only adds to the charm.  Ah, a place where I can eat like a pig and no one would judge me.  Also to note, they have this crazy drink called Barq's red creme soda.  I've never heard of it or had it before tonight and I can never go back to such ignorance!  And since it is a small family-owned place, the wait time can be pretty long since it's made to order but the wait is worth it.  EAT HERE, PEOPLE!

If I were on my deathbed, I would request to be wheeled over to eat at Bacio because it would feel like a LIFETIME!!!

I dined here because of a $150 food credit.  With so many quality restaurants in Las Vegas, the ones at The Tropicana aren't on the top of my list.  They're not even on the list.

But color me surprised when I saw their 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings for only $39.  Hey!  That made "restaurant week" look expensive.  It's a shame we didn't even get to the third course after 2+ hours.  I felt even worse for the couple from Italy at the next table playing the same waiting game.  Why in God's name would actual Italians eat here?!?!  

Their saving grace was that the food I did try was actually decent.  The "Risotto Capesante" with scallops, asparagus and prosciutto paired with a crispy white wine was surprisingly good.  I would've been happy with this dish as all four courses.  The "White Peach" salad I received over an hour later was also good but the wait made it taste a little less good.  My dinner companions ordered a la carte and got the veal parmigiana (huge and juicy) and shrimp risotto 90 minutes after ordering.  If they actually got this whole "serving food in a timely manner" down, Bacio wouldn't be a half bad place.  

What the heck was going on in the kitchen??  My guess was the chef suffered from narcolepsy.  We had less than 35 minutes to make a 10pm show at Caesars Palace.  I spoke with the manager to express my displeasure and he took the 2 course dinners off the bill.  The server was super nice, apologetic and took care of a round of drinks too.  At least they made an effort to make it right.  They then boxed up our last two courses of lobster gnocchi (rubbery) and apple granola cheesecake.  The dessert then melted in my car and went straight into the garbage.

You can't buy happiness but you can buy ramen and sushi and that's kind of the same thing.

Le grr.  I was hoping to start the new year off with a 5-star worthy meal!  At least it's not as bad as the Japanese-Mexican fusion place I went to earlier this week.  Yikes.  Anyways, met up with the in-laws today to celebrate my sister-in-law's milestone birthday.  I have never been here before so I jumped onto Yelp last night to see what would catch my eye.  Since it's been pretty chilly due to the winter storm, I was leaning towards ramen.  It ended up being a safe choice after seeing and tasting a little bit of what everyone ordered.

I ordered the Miso Butter Ramen with the Deluxe Dragon Roll on the side.  My ramen came with either salad or edamame and three California rolls.  I should have checked the tips on Yelp because I chose the edamame thinking the warm soybeans would help warm me up as we were seated under the only ceiling fan that appeared to be running.  It was cold and old and I ended up sliding it over the Mr. W. who had a very gross salad.  The California rolls are basic so it's nothing to write home about.  The ramen was satisfying.  Although the noodles seem to be the store-bought variety, I enjoyed the flavor of the miso broth immensely.  Paired with the butter that made the soup base creamy and coat my mouth with a wonderfully richness, I was pretty happy --- even with the hard-boiled egg [I was hoping for a soft-boiled egg].  I wish they had corn instead of bamboo shoots in their ramen but that's just all personal preference.  The chashu in my ramen was also nothing special.  The Deluxe Dragon Roll is a fancified dragon roll with the addition of cream cheese and tempura shrimp.  I also got to try some sashimi that didn't seem all too fresh, a cold lovely-dressed jellyfish salad, and other little bites.

Service was a little lacking but it's understandable since it was super busy.  It was a full-restaurant for the two hours we were there.  If I ever stop in again, I think I want to try their udon.

After finding out it would be a 2 hour wait at Gordon Ramday BurGR, we decided to hang out inside YOLOS (they had no wait) for drinks and appetizers. I was first impressed by the large, long booth we were sat at. That quickly changed when the people at our table kept kicking each other. There was no room under the table for us to sit comfortably. Our server was quick to take our drink order and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. 

We ordered a "Quesadilla" priced at $10 and "Empanadas" priced at $10 for our snackage. The quesadilla had jack cheese, onions and peppers inside. It also came with a side of salsa, sour cream and guacamole. The quesadilla was good, but average. If you want beef, chicken or shrimp in it then it will cost you $4-$5 more. The empanadas were well liked by hubby and I. They were stuffed with chorizo and had a green chile avocado salsa underneath them. The only complaint I have about that dish is the size of it. They put enough of the green chile avocado salsa on the plate so why not add just 1 more empanada to make it an even 4? If this were a cocktail party I could understand the small bites and portions, but this wasn't the case. With 4 people at our table it was awkward so hubby and I just ended up splitting one of them. The margarita did taste decent! 

They have lunch specials during the week that right now start at $9.95 and a Happy Hour at the bar as well. Also beware about the music inside this place. it's very loud and it's hard to have a conversation with the people sitting right at your table.

Where do I start with DW Bistro?  First of all DW has been a long time bookmark for me.  I never had the opportunity until recently with a bunch of Yelp peeps. Read the reviews and one thing in common with everyones review is the wait. So, if you're a patient person, DW's is worth if for you.  I'm one of those impatient people, but had no issues hanging out with a bunch of Yelp buds while our table was being prepared. 

Ambiance...so cool.  I love the decor, specifically the art pieces by Pamela Nielsen. One thing about the decor here is that it keeps you calm.  No angry colors anywhere in this joint.  However, the prices to these pieces are pretty expensive even with the DW discount.  If I ever was to meet that sugar mama, the artwork from Pamela Nielsen would be on my list of gifts.  So right now, it's just on my wish list.  But I did get her card for one of those "I don't care about money" days. 

Price is about right for the type of food this place serves.  Food presentation is the key to places like this and DW's definitely got this part right.  All their dishes are well portioned, meaning huge, and the presentation of each dish is prepped so nicely that it made it even tougher to eat.  But for someone like me, this wasn't going to be a problem since food is my number one priority. For brunch, I ended up getting their Filet Mignon and Eggs.  By the way, this dish is not on their normal menu.  This dish comes with two 4 oz filets, 2 eggs, and some bread.  I killed this meal with the quickness so it would be tough for me to say I didn't like it. I love me some red meat and red meat for brunch made meal #3 for the day just perfect. 

Service here is great considering how busy this place gets. We had a party of 10+ and our server dealt with us as best as he can.  Busy is an understatement here.  Yes, you have to get here before they open and line up.  We were one of the lucky ones to be here before opening and I really feel sorry for the folks that waited over an hour just to be seated.  Actually, I don't feel bad. Their bad for coming in late. 

PS:  Vanessa N shout out.  DW Bistro is super super super good.

Throwing an amazing party is not easy, I give them that. Tao, similar to other popular hot spots Rain, Tryst, Prive and clubs of the like, are so overcrowded that it's hard to enjoy yourself. Tons of people get on the guestlist, and those who aren't usually have to wait in a long line. When you're working at the door, the last thing you want to do is turn people away or make them wait. Trust me, I know the feeling. 

We had a group of 12, and it was really hard for us to stay together. Even though we were on the guestlist, only the girls got in for free. Guys had to pay a $20 cover. Had we planned things out so that we had table service, we would have gotten our own roped off VIP section. Instead, we took our chances and unfortunately were packed like sardines on the dance floor. We made the best of it, and I ended up having a great time dancing, even though I was bumpin' and grindin' with people on all sides. 

Jessica and Nicole got separated from us, but I found them standing near the window trying to look for us. They had gotten themselves into the VIP section next to boxer Bernard Hopkins who was in town for the fight. They took me back there, and we hung out there for a while. When our guy friends found us there, they were denied entry. That's when we decided to leave. While the rest of the group stayed and checked out Tao Beach upstairs (which was just as chaotic), we decided to call it a night. 

As we walked down to the restaurant, they had cleared the area out and there were hardly any people down there even though there was another DJ spinning there and the bar was less crowded. We probably could have gotten the rest of the group to come down and hang out with us there, but we were pretty much over the scene and took off. 

You'll find a lot of hot women put on display throughout the club. Although they are gorgeous girls with hot bodies, it was a bit disturbing to see them sitting in rose petal filled bathtubs and getting massages. I think what made it degrading was that they didn't look happy to be there and be stared at. I guess it's their choice, right?

Me:  "Fatburger?  Never heard of them!"
One of my friends suggested, "I hear they're pretty good."
We decided to try it.

Both my friends and I agreed.  This might be a good burger if you're drunk, but it was pretty bad while sober.  While my friends ordered their own combinations I went with the medium Fatburger deal omitting cheese and onions on my burger and choosing the fat fries over the skinny fries.

Although this place looks and operates very much like a fast food place it is not.  The burgers are cooked to order so definitely expect a wait for your food order to be called.  If you order a soft drink it's self serve.  That part I liked about Fatburger because I can control how little ice and how much soft drink actually goes into the cup.

However, back to the burger.  My number was called and a worker delivered the burger tray to me.  The first thing I noticed was how small the burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LtXy1VinKWfuLFslVarKRw?select=2v29rPxqQNAWVXQlLTyqPQ) was compared to how large the portion of steak fries were.  I love thick fries which is why I selected the Fat Fries over the skinny ones.  These were a huge disappointment even though they were nice and meaty and fried to a perfect golden yellow color.  The fault was in the oil which tasted old, and because of that the fries didn't taste fresh.  You'd be surprised how big a difference there is just by changing the oil in a fryer.

The burger was not good either.  The burger patty was so overcooked no moisture existed within the meat.  I might have been happy had there even been a glistening of grease within, but nope, chewing cardboard is probably the best comparison.  The shredded lettuce while crisp had the odd taste of being stored in a refrigeration unit badly in need of a box of baking soda.  I don't mind that they use pickle relish instead of pickle slices but even that tasted old.  It's kind of like when you go to Costco and stock up on too much of something and store it until the taste begins to waver.  The pickle relish did not have a fresh snappy taste to it.  The only ingredients which tasted fresh were the tomato slice, the bun and the mustard.

At the least the service was good and the workers are friendly.  I can honestly say I won't be back at a Fatburger restaurant anytime in the foreseeable future.

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Warning! Going to Sam Fox Restaurants for Happy Hour after a movie can be habit forming. 

We have heard many good things about this Italian farmhouse concept, but we were little hesitant given that we found the lunch at North in Kierland just okay.  Our caution however, was unwarranted.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
We arrived around four-thirty and the parking lot was mostly empty. Were they open we thought? But as we approached the front door, it was opened by a hostess and we were invited in. Nice.  

We said we had come for the Happy Hour and were escorted not to the bar, but to some tables along the back wall. We were given menus, both Dinner and HH and heard a brief explanation of the fish special. Very cozy and very nice. I have taken a few photos of the inside of the restaurant.  The mood is upscale and dare I say 'hip".

MENU:
Like other Fox places, the HH menu is more of a starting point of samplers. For instances, if you like HH serving of freshly made meatballs and spaghetti, then maybe you'll like the lager dinner serving.

The HH menu has about a dozen items, mostly in the $5.00 - $8.00 range.  They have Caesar Salad, Arancini, Pizza of the Day $8, Chef's Board of meats and cheese $10, Zucca chips $3.  Two holdovers from other restaurants are the Castelvetrano Olives $3 and Spiced Nuts $2. These two look similar to the Olive & Ivy's offering. http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-and-ivy-scottsdale#hrid:XB-E39WNviGs1MkkQ4XIxw

As you would expect, they also have all beers and well drinks priced at $4.00 to $5.00.  But what we found special, are all their wines marked at 50% off.  They will also re-cork it for you to go.

Here are links to the menus:

http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/North_40th_Dinner_Menu2.pdf

SERVICE:
We found the service to be very professional.  Yes, the water glasses were refilled on a timely basis, but also the wait staff comes by and chats with you about your food and answers any questions you have very knowledgeably.  We actually got into a very detailed discussion on Washington State wines and Oregon Pinots with our server Vail.

FOOD:
We started off by ordering a Washington State Chardonnay, but found they didn't have any chilled.  We then opted instead for the Snoqualmie Riesling, which was somewhat sweet, with a hint of cherries.

We tried the HH Caesar Salad for $5.00 and the HH Spaghetti, also for $5.00. The salad came with some of the most delicious croutons that had a smokey taste we have ever had.  A definite must.  The spaghetti was equally interesting and flavorful.  The meatballs must be cooked in a marinara, and has a complexed layering taste which was different than the pasta sauce, which has a hint of fennel. Wow.

Next we ordered the Margherita Pizza ($11.00) off the Dinner menu, see photos. It was very good but we found the cheese slipped off when you bit into a wedge. 

For dessert, we each ordered the Gelato scoop for $3.00 and the Tiramisu for $6.00, both off the dinner menu.  I've taken pictures of the Titamisu.  It came in a glass ramekin with an amazing amount of delicious mascarpone cheese and flavorful Kahlua.

PRICES:
Our petite Happy Hour dinner of six items, ran us $41.50 before taxes and gratuities.  It also included the bottle ($23.00, 50% off) of Riesling, which our wonderful server Vail re-corked for us. As we left, the parking lot was full with a dozen cars waiting to be parked.

Enjoy!

**Review #600: The single best meal I've ever experienced**

To celebrate our one year wedding anniversary, my wife and I ate a feast fit for  royalty at Chef Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak. 

Located inside the MGM Grand, Craftsteak is a dimly lit, elegantly decorated high end steak house. 

The menu at CS is littered with amazing sounding salads, sides, steaks, seafood, desserts and more. Instead of trying one or two things, my wife and I decided to make this meal a memorable one and partake in their Domestic Wagyu tasting, which included a grand total of FOURTEEN dishes in three courses.  Ready?? Here we go;

Course 1- The Warm UP:

Course 3- My Favorite Stuff:
Cinnamon Monkey Bread W/ Brown Sugar Sour Cream Ice Cream & Pecan Toffee http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=12a18ImEp5GMU4k417Nt0Q 
Guava Sorbet & Vanilla Bean Ice Cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=_vXAXf8OBLrJBrVgAS_02A 
Flourless Chocolate Cake W/ Blood Orange Sorbet & Tangerines http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=c0AWtBt9_3y1-WoR_BXkAA
Farmers Market Fruit Plate  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xkVMIk_Vqh17f48ZQ_6b0w?select=iPcZn31A-sZQZdAPIT5Yzw

Everything and I mean EVERYTHING we ate was phenomenal. Not one dish disappointed me. I've had many meals in my life and this one now ranks as the biggest and best yet. The salads were great. The meat was juicy and melted in my mouth. The sides were fantastic and the desserts were mind blowing. I did have some favorites, which I'll list below. 
My favorite dishes in the first course were the tartare and the warm Frise salad.
My favorite dishes in the second course were the Wagyu ribeye and the Yukon Gold Puree (best mashed potatoes EVER). 
My favorite dessert was the cinnamon monkey bread.

The service here was top notch. We had two separate servers, both of whom were friendly and attentive. Both answered any questions we asked and trust me, we had a few.  

The price for the Wagyu tasting menu was $140 a person, which was not bad considering the massive amount of incredible food we received. In all honesty, I could not afford to do this on a weekly (or even monthly) basis but since I got lucky the night before at the Roulette tables, this meal only set me back about thirty dollars of my own money. Thanks, Vegas. 

If you ever have the opportunity to dine at Craftsteak, even if you can't afford a steak tasting (tastings start at $100 a person), then just order off their regular menu. I can't highly recommend Craftsteak enough. This truly was THE BEST meal I've ever had in my entire life.

Wicked Spoon was at the top of my list of places to go in vegas and i actually got a little depressed at the end of the meal when i didn't feel that 5 star feeling... I had been drooling over the pics posted by friends weeks in advance and I found myself enjoying it, but 5 days later, i can't really think of too many dishes i would go back for... 
But no surprise to SY, i would still give this place 4 stars. Mainly because compared to most of the other Vegas Buffets, they do have a cool concept of serving most dishes tapas style,a large selection and you can't beat the price. $29.00 for dinner is a great deal!!!
Things i liked: cute sweet potato fries basket: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=iPghhy9N4azg0lP_S5HrkA
Salad (yes salad): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=hdhBFzkgK6B6235Cd9EpDA
That they have a mac and cheese bar: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=M2_4E_aQ9CKhPjH1w-2--Q
and surprisingly the brussel sprouts were deelicious. 
Loved eating out of the little pans : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=Ym-lY0eK698v546Q_AzDTg
Crunchy tacos were good.

Sad they didn't have the raved about pork belly bun and XLB. They only had 3 types of sushi and they were all generic rolls. Crab legs were small crab claws. I had Bone Marrow for the first time- thumbs up. 
The desserts looked beautiful and were plenty : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=xDoLAU2S10POWue58tlXBw
and i grabbed a whole plateful :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=zxZDmDpWsDs2rcaWQa0ZEw
But the only thing i really liked was this lemony jelly dessert thing that was served inside of an eggshell topped with a baby macaron (mac was not great tho). Gelato was yum. Chocolate covered strawberries are always nice. 
I did enjoy the desserts here more than Wynn Buffet. But i remember liking the Bellagio desserts the best (but that was years ago)

A little disappointing overall, but service was friendly (our waitress took the time to take pics for us and make conversation about our trip), everything was beautiful and how much fun was it to take some pics in the shoes and by the dog statues around the way.!

I read about this new attraction in the Las Vegas Sun and decided to make a trip down to Fremont Street to give it a try.  Since my Son was off of school today, I brought him along.  The attraction is located on the far East side of Fremont Street, which is closest to Las Vegas Blvd.  The best place to park is the parking garage on the corner of Fremont Street & Las Vegas Blvd.  It's pretty cheap for parking....we were there for 2 hours and paid $3.

I posted a video on YouTube if you want to see the experience:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxzOl3TXeJs

The ticket office for this attraction is on the Fremont Street level next to the Walgreens.  Tickets are $15 each for 1 ride, $25 for 2 rides, $30 for 3 rides....that's per person.  In other words, 3 people riding once will pay $45 total.....capiche?  Cool....

Since we didn't know if we'd enjoy it, we paid $15 each for the single ride.  We should have paid $30 each for the 3 pack.....because we ended up riding a 2nd time.  The girl was cool and only charged us $10 each for the 2nd ride as if we paid for the 2 pack....not sure she'll hook you up like that though, so don't expect that.  (see pics for full price list and all day discount pricing)

The launch pad is I think 60 ft in the air and you access it by going to the 5th floor (roof) of the parking garage, which is the same building the ticket office is located.  We made our way up there and waited in line.  Everyone in line was pretty nervous, including myself.  I'm not a fan of heights, but wanted to give this a try.  My Son was pretty brave....he wasn't nervous at all....until we got up to the edge of the platform.

You get strapped into a harness and get some instruction.  Here are some tips:

- Don't wear flip flops or sandals with no ankle straps....if you do, they'll make you take them off and put them in a netted bag.

- Purses or bags without secure straps will not be allowed on the ride.

- Don't wear anything with loose pockets or if you do, don't put anything in them because it could fly out easily.

- Don't wear loose sunglasses.  They could fly of easily with the airflow generated during the ride.

- They don't allow pictures to be taken during the ride, for obvious reasons...ie your camera could slip out of your hands and seriously injure someone on the ground.

It sounds like a lot of rules, but it's common sense.  Knowing this in advance will save you a trip back to your car or hotel room.

The zipline can handle groups up to 4 people at one time.  A quick hint if you want to get on/off the ride fast.....ride as a single.  They're always looking for a single to fill up a group of three, which happened often while we were there.

We were nervous on the final walk up the stairs to the launch pad....when you get up there the instructor will attach you to a cable until you're secured on the zipline.  Each person will be hooked up to the zipline and given instructions on what to do.  I admit, I was nervous all the way up until the launch of our 1st ride.  It looks much higher from the launch pad than from the ground.

After everyone is given instructions, he releases the safety clip and you lift up your legs and your body weight launches you down the zipline.  If you want to go really fast, tuck your knees up to your chest like a cannon ball dive in a pool.....you'll pick up speed right away.  If you stay in this position, you'll maximize your speed all the way through the ride.....this was a tip given to us by the instructor.

The ride itself is very fun.....you feel like you're flying above everyone, because you are.  It was very exhilarating and I felt free.  The landing is the roughest part.....you slam into a padded stopping mechanism and your momentum swings you up quickly while an employee secures your line with a rope.  I was amazed at how fast we came in on the landing.....the 2nd time around I nailed the employee in the shoulder with my knee....I'm surprised he didn't go down.  He said it happens all day long.....I wouldn't want his job.

After your ride, you get your picture taken and you have the option to purchase pictures of your ride.....prices are $10 each for the 1st 2 pics, then $5 a pic after that.  I paid for 4 pics since we couldn't take any on the ride itself.....nice to have as a souvenir for the 1st time, won't pay for it again though.  I didn't post those pics because I don't have a scanner.  The pics I posted of people on the zipline were other riders.  The pics from the launch pad was from my perspective....I put the camera away just before launch.

Overall, it was an exhilarating ride and we had a blast.

Will we return?  There's no doubt about it.....I'm taking all of my friends who visit from out of town to ride.

I can safely say this was my first time even remotely being excited to eat Italian food on the strip.  Currently the hottest restaurant in the city, Giada is bringing in the masses nightly.  I thought 90 days ahead of my 7th wedding anniversary would be adequate lead time for a 7pm-ish dinner on a Tuesday, but we ended up with 9pm.  Not a big deal.  That meant more drinks at the bar!  I had a few tasty "Flash Gordon" cocktails that made me feel semi-invincible; the sensation was unfortunately fleeting as I felt like Ming the Merciless had pointed his stupid ring to my head in the AM.  

If you do one thing above anything else with your time at Giada, my advice would be to wait for a premium table.  The hostess initially walked us to a less than favorable area with only a partial strip view.  Despite her warning that it could take half an hour or more for a better spot, we stayed strong and went back to the bar.  Luckily, she came back in less than 15 minutes and brought us to an excellent table with grand views of Bellagio and Caesars Palace.  

Like Rod U. said in his excellent review, antipasti are where it's at.  If I could do it all over again, I would order more small plates of seafood, salumi, cheese, crostini, salumi, cheese, seafood and cheese.  The burrata was magnificent.  It was a creamy, mozzarella dream that tasted more heavenly as I got to the center.  Accompanying this glorious gift from cows with anything else more than olive oil, garnish and balsamic salt would have been offensive.  

I had some serious doubts about the waiter's recommendation of the "Prosciutto San Daniele" since we recently had Carnevino's "Prosciutto di Parma Riserva", but that all went away when the first slice melted in my mouth.  As unimaginable to me as it could be, it was better than Batali's.  The waiter had tried Mario's as well and agreed. Not that he was biased or anything.....

Another highlight was Giada's signature spaghetti with 2 large shrimp, lemon and basil.  She really loves her citrus as it's all over the menu.  It was wonderful!  The handmade pasta was superb and the light cream sauce at the bottom of the bowl was well worth sopping up with the shrimp.  I am a huge sucker for fresh pasta.

Although the "Veal Chop Saltimbocca" was an impressive looking entre in size, I felt it was underwhelming and quite plain.  This wasn't the kind of place that had salt and pepper shakers at the table, but I would have reached for some.  The massive leftover we brought home will definitely be getting some seasonal treatment.  The sauce it came with took it nowhere.  I wished we had given the branzino a shot instead.  At least the asparagus it came with was outstanding.  The wood grill brought out a whole new dimension of flavor to the standard upscale restaurant vegetable.  

The dessert cart they rolled out made final decisions tough but the strawberry tart, blackberry lime tiramisu and white coffee gelato (I'd bath in it) were great conclusions to an overall solid meal.  With dinner clocking in at almost 3 hours, Giada isn't a dinner before a show kind of place, this is the show.

Jjanga is AYCE for $25.95
Jjanga is new and not busy
Jjanga has excellent service
Jjanga is a good pick if you're looking for some Yum Yum Rolls. 

I'm not a sushi snob, but I do prefer Sashimi's and Nigiri over rolls.  It's been forever since I've had a Yum Yum Roll.  For some reason, I was craving these California Rolls drenched in mayo. It's been awhile. It's been a very long time.  So, when the gf suggested sushi for our Valentine's Day dinner instead of our usual steak dinner, I couldn't help be get a little excited about it.  

From the time we walked in to the time we left, we had nothing but excellent service.  The team at Jjanga can sure teach a few other sushi restuarants out there about customer service.  They know what's up and they knew how to treat me and my special lady.  Good Job, Jjanga!

My Items:
Mells Roll:  This was my first roll of the evening. How could I not get this roll, right?  Inside was crab and shrimp.  This roll has a spectacular name, but was just okay when it came to taste.  
 
Jjanga Burrito:  This is a hand roll with shrimp, broccoli tempura, and crab wrapped in soy paper.  This was actually pretty good and great light option if you're looking for something that isn't going to weigh you down. 

Jackpot Special:  Jackpot!  I think I found the king of all Yum Yum Rolls.  This one had shrimp tempura on the inside with spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and of course a ton of mayo sauce on the outside.  If you're going to eat bad, might as well get this. I probably could have gotten two of these rolls. 

Freshman Roll:  This had everything...tuna, salmon, and crab.  Wrapped in rice paper, my taste buds were a little confused on what it was tasting because there was so much going on.  But I still thought that this was good.  

Teriyaki Chicken w/Brown Rice:  What was I thinking?  The brown rice wasn't the best and the chicken was a little bland even with Teriyaki sauce. My bad...I shouldn't be going to a sushi restuarant expecting great chicken. 

Regarding their food, I only had 4 full rolls, their Jjanga burrito, Teriyaki chicken, and Green Tea Mochi.  Needless to say, I was stuffed.  I thought that the sushi was fresh, the rolls were tight, and all were packed with taste.  Bottomline, the food is fresh.  On my next visit, I will probably go back to Sashimi's and Nigiri's because that's what I prefer.  But from someone that doesn't frequent a Yum Yum Roll, I recommend this place. I

PS:  They got the same rolls as Sumo. So if you're a fan of Sumo, then you'll be a fan of Jjanga.

I was able to knock off another spot that was bookmarked and loved it! It was almost 9 pm when we arrived and the there was a good amount of customers inside. They have different sizes of tables to accommodate the size of your party. There was a nice man who greeted us and took us to a table right away. Drinks and peanuts were brought to the table and the night was off to a great start.

There were tons of things on Wendy's menu that I had never seen before. After much menu gazing I decided on the "Flaming Hot Stir-Fried Beef" priced at $8.99 and it was so good! The portion was much more then I expected and the dish was packed with delicious flavor. This was a dish that could easily be shared. The rice brought with it was cooked perfectly. You just can't go wrong with the prices at Wendy's or the portion.

Wendy herself came over to our table to introduce herself and ask how the meal was. I mentioned that I was curious about a few items on the menu and she took much appreciated time explaining the items on the menu and asking me what my personal likes were so she could suggest certain dishes for the next visit. She mentioned that the "Clay Pots" take at least 30 minutes to prepare and that you can just call ahead if you are on a time crunch and they can start preparing it for you. Wendy was so genuinely nice and it is evident she cares about the food they are serving as much as the customers.

They have TV's inside and offer catering. This is the type of place you could go on a date, take your family, or just grab some lunch on a break. Inside was very clean and the water they serve is filtered. I will for sure be back!

A very good friend told me about this Irish pub not too long ago, and since then this family-operated establishment has been one of my go-to destinations for live music and Irish cuisine. The atmosphere is dim lit, bustling, and equipped with several TVs for local sports fans here and there. The dcor starts with an open patio, and a horseshoe bar surrounded by a score of booths and tables. Last Friday the Sullivan's were on hand to provide the live music that rocked the house.

The Jinky's Famous Chicken Wings ($8.99) arrived with ten sizable drumettes and they were spicy delicious. The meat was a tad on the dry side, and I wished there were a number of actual wings that could appear on the plate. On the other hand, the explosive flavor was quite striking, addictive, and good to share. This is a good dish to order during game day.

Their Corned Beef and Cabbage ($11.99) came with prime pieces of corned beef, boiled cabbage, potatoes, carrots, horseradish sauce, and mustard. The thick cuts of corned beef was a tad chewy, but there was plenty of flavor to go with the creamy horseradish and pointed mustard seeds. The cabbage and potatoes were sensational. Portions were generous and good for two meals. This is one dish that I would recommend.

The Grilled Basa ($9.95) came with a strip of perfectly buttery blackened basa. The fish was tender, flavorful, and had great moisture so it was easy to fork into. This dish also came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes nicely whipped with a mix of potato skin here and there. Fia thought the fish was a tad too salty, but we both really liked the mashed potatoes. 

Service was friendly, efficient, and fast. My drink was not refilled the first time, but service was much improved during my latest visit. The atmosphere really picked up once the Sullivan's came on stage. Eventually it got a bit too loud and hard to chat across the table. A cool spot to catch a game and enjoy their live music. I would be interested in coming back to try their Fish 'n Chips and Irish Whiskey Bread Pudding.

In my first review of Picasso 6 years ago, I compared dining here to having a one night stand with a celebrity.  

Well who said you can't hook up again when they're back in town???

My wife and I wanted to celebrate our 6th anniversary with a nice dinner.   It had been a long time since we were last here and it sounded a lot better than going to Red Lobster.  The original plan was to dine indoors and admire all the wonderful, priceless Picasso art displayed around the restaurant since we sat outside last time.  The hostess informed us they had a table open outside and asked if we wanted to check it out before deciding.  The fountain show was going off right then and we gave into the temptation of the patio once again.  Screw art :)  It's one of the best atmospheres to dine in Vegas!  I can't say no!

You get one of two course choices, there's the prix fixe and the menu dgustation.  We ordered one of each with wine pairings and even though the menu hadn't changed very much over the years, it was even more awesome now than before.  I think I appreciate fine dining now more than I did 6 years ago but that could also be due to prescription pills.  

We're foie gras crazy people so that was one of the many highlights.  The foie gras au torchon is the way my wife prefers it while I love their "sauted steak of "A" foie gras".  The tenderness, oil and fattyness of it all complimented with figs and pistachios is like having a mouthful of multiple orgasms.

The pan seared U-10 day boat scallop with potato mousseline and jus de veau is like the most perfect, hand picked scallop.  A pearl!  I try to eat as small a bite as possible to savor it all.  

You basically can't go wrong with any of it.  Why change the menu when it's pretty much perfect?  This also marks the first time I've gotten through wine courses without leaving totally bombed at the end.  I must be getting more mature :P

Service was A++ from beginning to end and they offered us an extra dessert dish to celebrate the occasion.  We had such a great time that we ended up being the last ones in the place!

And now ladies and gentlemen... the single worst establishment I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. Heart Attack Grill has ZERO redeeming qualities. There is not a single reason for me to even get close to giving this place anything more than one star. This is one place that makes me wish Yelp would allow a zero or negative star rating. 

Now, to preface this review... I'm not an idiot... I know that this place is "The Heart Attack Grill" so I went in prepared for greasy and unhealthy food but hoped it'd be fun and even though unhealthy, maybe taste alright. Whoa, was I ever wrong to hope for that. They group their burgers by how many patties there are... starting out with the Single Bypass burger (one pattie) and going up to the Quadruple Bypass burger (four patties). Being a little more on the conservative end, I went with the Single Bypass burger and a side order of fries. My Dad came along for the fun and he got the same... for the purposes of this review I should tell you that my Dad is a machine, he can eat... and he doesn't mind a little grease. 

Right as they bring our food out, I immediately get intimidated. The patty of the burger was dripping with fat and the meat used was such low quality (extremely high fat/meat ratio) that the patty didn't even appear to be beef... it had this whitish tint to it that you'd have to see to believe. I've never seen such an unhealthy piece of beef in my life... it doesn't help that they cook it in pure lard either. This was beyond unhealthy, it was disgusting. I feel like if you're making something blatantly unhealthy there should at least be a method to the madness; there should be some attempt at wanting to make it actually taste good (it is food by the way). It just seemed like they were pushing the grease and lard to the absolute maximum just to see how far they can take it. Well I'm not impressed... I took one bite and was instantly grossed out, I actually almost threw up it was so bad. My Dad who can hang with the best of 'em was able to stomach about three bites until he could no longer continue. The second we left the place I turned to my Dad and said "that's the worst single piece of food I've ever put in my mouth". I'm not exaggerating when I say that I'd rather eat a dried up piece of dog shit between two buns than a Heart Attack Grill burger. 

The only thing worse than the food is the tacky and over the top waitresses. They wander around in little nurses outfits often times with their underwear quite visible, and their whole bar area has a slanted mirror to actually encourage you to look up their skirts. That'd be fine and all, except I didn't want to look up these skirts. If you're going to have your wait staff dress sexy, you better make sure they're worth looking at in the first place. These girls were a little rough around the edges... most of them had that 'ex-stripper' look; and I could have sworn that one of them had bullet wounds on her stomach... that's not a joke.

P.S. I actually dry heaved while writing this review just thinking about my fat drenched burger. 

DO NOT GO HERE.

CHA, CHA, CHA, CHA CHAIYA!

After seeing EVERYBODY check in here every last Sunday of the month, I finally got the chance to join them this last one on 3/30/14. Better late than never I guess. 

As I show up with my wifey, I just happen to bump into Andrew C who was nice enough to give me some pointers. He kind of ended up being my Chaiya guide along with tips by other Yelpers. First thing you notice about this place is that its right in the middle of a neighborhood community. 

First stop was to put my name down on the clipboard for an order of Pad Thai ($5). Wifey got 10 Pork Satay Skewers ($1 each). Then on down to the Sticky Mango Rice table ($5). After that the Thai Soup table ($5). Next is Papaya Salad ($4). 

Since just about everything was made fresh, you had to do a bit of waiting for certain things. Like the Pad Thai. They cook it from scratch with two big woks so two orders can be cooked at a time. Same goes for the Papaya Salad. The guy is literally peeling the skin off the fruit and finely slicing it for the salad mix. As for the Sticky Mango, they can only peel and cut the fruit so fast so the wait for that is based on how many mangos they can carve. Once they run out of that and sticky rice, you are out of luck. The Pork Satay Skewers are all ready to go and cooks pretty quick on the grill. The Thai Soup table has all the ingredients ready to go as well. You just need to select thick or thin noodles, then they throw it in a medium sized styrofoam bowl  along with broth, meat, and pork balls.

Shout outs go out to Nik O, Debra W, Terri R, and Chris V for helping me out also. Nik gave me her extra Eggroll to try out. Debra told me what there was to drink. Terri told me about the vegetables available for purchase. Lastly, Chris told me about the Curry Puffs that you have to order a month in advance. He even gave me one from his stash to try. Thanks a lot guys!

Some random info: Cash only! Preferrably small bills. Sometimes they give you coins that are worth 2 dollars that is valid for their items only. Come early! Show up just right before 9 am for great parking, better selection, and getting your Pad Thai quicker by being one of the first to sign up. Phone reception is low so it might take you a while to check in and upload pics sometimes. Lastly, this is an outdoor event so always be prepared for what the season may bring. If you follow what I just pointed out from beginning to end, you will fare much better than most peeps that show up later on.

Overall, I am kicking myself for not coming here sooner. Next time I am bringing back up. Usually on Saturdays and Sundays, I tend to sleep in but in cases like access to delicious cheap food and good company, I don't mind sacrificing a little bit of sleep. Hay, maybe I can nap........errr I mean meditate for a bit inside the monastery.

Very disappointed! It's exactly what you expect to find in a pawn shop. Only difference is, they just happen to be famous because their shop is on the History channel. 

Here's a typical day at this place. When you pull up to their building, it's recognizable cuz of what you see on tv. Otherwise it looks just like any other pawn shop place anywhere else.  If you see people lined up outside to get in, chances are you won't find any parking. Wait times vary from 30 mins to an hour (Come on, really? For a pawn shop? SMH). At least if you are in line they have those water sprinkler thingies that spray out mists of water to keep you cool. (about the only positive thing I think). Once you get to the door, there is usually a rude security guy that tells you where to go. When you get in, there is a divider in the middle that directs the flow of traffic like an oval track at a raceway. You will see various items (mostly overpriced). You can stop and look but only if you are actually interested in purchasing something is when the attendants behind the counter will actually talk to you. You'll be lucky if whoever helps you knows anything about what is in the glass cases. I think these people were hired mainly just to make sure nobody does a smash and grab. About halfway down towards the back are mostly pawn shop souvenirs. From what I saw it was mainly Chumlee souvenirs. Why? Go figure. Then you basically do a U-turn and you are on your way out. 

The most bogus thing about this place is the hours of operation. Outside it says 24 hours but you soon find out when you show up late at night that only the pawn shop portion of the place is open 24/7. That means if you have actual merchandise you wanna sell or pawn, you can come in. The portion I mentioned earlier, the day I went that section closed at 9 pm. So if you are just a tourist, the rude security guard at the entrance will announce the store section is now closed, if you are not here to sell or buy any actual display items, then get out. Only the pawn shop section is open 24 hours. I suggest you call them first before you go there because they might be filming or have changed their hours.

As for the actual Pawn Stars people. Don't get too excited. These guys dont actually man the counters. They are usually in the back doing whatever. That is if they are actually there. I was told they only show up for filming and occasional courtesy visits. People tell me that Rick and his old man are really anal if you just happen to catch them. They tend to blow you off thinking they dont have any time for you and that they have more important things to do. Chumlee is a little more receptive and laid back. You'll be lucky if any of these guys even know you are standing there. They got their show so I think that's why they don't care too much for "tourists".

So overall, don't waste your time. I live here so that's why I gave them 2 stars. Yes it's a tourist spot but if you really need to check it out then I suggest you include this on your way to Fremont Experience. It sucks if you paid money for a cab only to be disappointed especially if your hotel and points of interest are off of the main strip.  If you are visiting from out of town, hopefully you have read this first BEFORE you went out there. Otherwise, if you are reading this while in line or afterwards, you will probably give it only 1 star.

So I guess Imperial Palace is now QUAD RESORT & CASINO. But, it's the same place. Please read my review of IP before reading this review. You can find it right over here:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/imperial-palace-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas#hrid:PmcM2qPVlg96fjp2d6ut7g

And I just want to add, about 5 months ago I got into a fight with that bald headed boob(I think his name is Kevin or Carl), who is the manager of this place. He literally told me that "YELP SUCKS" and even taunted me to write a bad review. Let me explain to you why this fight occurred:

One of my friends came to town and decided to stay here because of the cheap room rates. She lived in West Hollywood most of her life, so she felt comfortable in this atmosphere. But, even West Hollywood can't compare to the f*cked up shit you find here at IP. Just to let you guys know, there was 2 assaults and what might have been a robbery or attempted robbery here on the same floor my friend was staying at. Like I mentioned in my previous review, for the last 2 years there has been a network of thieves who take advantage of the "door defect" that most of the doors here at IP have. The doors have a slight defect where they don't close 100%, and you actually have to slam the door twice to fully close it. The thieves know about this defect and due to the fact that IP has no security guards in front of the entrances to their towers, these thieves have been running this cycle for years. Read all the reviews on IPs page, many of the reviews are from yelpers who fell victim to this network of robbers. While visiting my friend, I actually saw the guys this time. They attempted to try to trick me and pretend they were just guests. They said "hello" to me while they suspiciously walked down the hallway. Both men had New Yorker accents. A few minutes later a lady runs down the hallway telling me that those guys entered her room and then ran out when they noticed she was still inside. The hotel manager is a total rat.  The guests who were almost robbed asked the guy to at least comp their stay and the manager literally tells them: "we don't comp for that. It wasn't our fault." He then tells the guests that the hotel management is aware of  the door malfunction defect and he even went out of his way to show her a small sign that read: "we are not responsible for the door not closing". What this means is that the hotel managers are all cheap motherf*ckers and won't put in the extra cash to fix the defect on the doors. When I was going back to my friends room, the moment we got out of the elevator there was a group of college kids getting the sh!t kicked out of them by more weirdos with New York accents. Now, my friend didn't want to stay here anymore. I asked that bald boob at the front desk for a room change and he practically tells me to f*ck off.  

I saw my 2nd assault of the trip at the Pet Stay area. A family was walking their dog to the pet area and some d-bag threw a glass bottle off their balcony at them. The security guard never showed up. 

Here is the most interesting part... The managers let me know that they think "Yelp is a joke". When I told them that I would write about this on Yelp, he started getting really sarcastic and said that Yelp has no effect on there business. He expressed that no matter how many 1-star ratings they get on Yelp, problem gamblers from out of state will always choose IP because they save money on lodging which means they get to have more money for gaming. 

There is probably like a 90% chance that something like this will happen to you. For example: You will go down to the poker room to play some cards. When you come back to your room, you notice your door is open. You find your daughter  tied up in the closet, badly beaten. Your wife's neck is snapped. Your oldest son has been thrown off the balcony onto Carnival Court, and no one noticed because of how loud it is. Your youngest son has been abducted and is already being sold to a Thai brothel who will force-inject him with female hormones in order to make him into a transgendered child prostitute. At that moment you will start to think to yourself: "Maybe I should have listened to that weird Tetsuro guy on Yelp, or at least listened to all the negative reviews instead of trying to save $10 a night!"  But, then you decide that you need to rescue your son and avenge your family, so you head off to Thailand and use your special forces training to fight the gangsters that took your son to find out that it was those Australian guys from "Human Nature" who were behind it all along. And all this happened cause you decided to stay at IP for the week.

Currently, I've actually decided to film a documentary style video about how dangerous, filthy, and disgusting IP is. In Feb I get 2 free nights through Total Rewards, and while I'm staying there I will document the door defects and hopefully capture one of the many assaults on video. I will upload it on my youtube channel.

Had some time to kill, so I stopped in here to grab a bite to eat and watch the Cowboys vs Eagles Sunday night football game.  It has been over 5 yrs since I last visited this place and have heard a lot of good things about it, so I figured it was time.  I'm glad I did!

The waiter brought over the menu and as I turned through each page I got more and more excited......2 pages dedicated to Sliders, what?!!  I love Sliders!  Yes, it's true....two whole pages (see pics).  One page has exotic style sliders....ie Alligator, etc.  The other page has some unique ones.....I decided on getting a 6-pack ($15) which allows you to select 2 styles of Sliders.  I chose the Black and Blue (Black Angus w/Cajun Spices, Blue Cheese Crumbles, Caramelized Onions, & Chipotle Mayo)  and the Chicken Cordon Bleu (Grilled Chicken, Honey Baked Ham, Swiss Cheese & Honey Mustard Sauce).  However, I was extremely curious about the Ghost Sliders, which has Ghost Sauce, made from the world's hottest pepper....the Ghost Pepper.  Plus there's an entire 1/2 page on the menu dedicated to items prepared with Ghost Pepper!

As most of my friends know, I love spicy food.....but have never tried anything with Ghost Pepper before.  As a reference point, Habanero Peppers are 350,000 on the Scoville Scale, which measures spiceness.  Ghost Pepper registers 1,000,000+ on the Scoville Scale!

I asked the waiter if I could have a side of the Ghost Sauce so I could try it out.  He said sure.....however, he didn't tell me I'd get charged an extra $1 for that....which kind of irks me.  Keep that in mind if you decide to order a side of it.

To wash it down, I had a Hardway IPA ($3)....that's right $3 for a 20 oz glass!

After a few minutes the 6-pack of Sliders came out as well as the Ghost Sauce.  I wanted to try the Ghost Sauce before the food, so I took a toothpick and dipped the tip into the Sauce.....it burned the hell out of my tongue!  That is seriously H-O-T!  It's no joke!  But that's what I enjoy!

So....I took a Chicken Cordon Bleu Slider and dipped a little Ghost Sauce on it and took a bite.....yum!  It was great!  Perfect proportion of Ham & Chicken.....they complimented each other well.  The Bun was soft and fresh.....again, perfect.  Next I tried the Black and Bleu Slider.....it was just as good.  Although I could have had it without the Red Onion....I'm not a fan of grilled Red Onions...oh well, next time I get them without it.

I'm glad I ordered the IPA because I needed it to put the 5 alarm fire out in my mouth.  I also ordered a glass of Blueberry Vanilla Wheat ($2) after I was done with the IPA....it was also very good and cheap!  Can't get over how cheap the Beer was!

Overall, it was an awesome experience.  Good food, good Beer, and I lost my Ghost Pepper virginity!

Other things worth mentioning.....there's a 7 lb Burger challenge, yes 7 LBS!  If you can eat it in less than 12 min and change, then you get it named after you.  Believe it or not, it's been done before.  No way I could do that!

Will I return?  As the Macho Man Randy Savage would say......Oh Hell Ya!

One of the things you HAVE to do while in Vegas ... eat breakfast.  Whether it is that crazy night or just because you are on vacation.  I'm not normally a breakfast eater, but I do like to eat breakfast while in Vegas.

Service - 5 Stars
Cleanliness - Excellent
Price - $17.58 (includes tax and tip).
Seafood - Yes, smoked salmon
Meats - Yes, chicken, bacon, steak, ham
Vegetables - Yes, salads.
Dessert - Yes
Fruits - Yes
Other - (1) Located in the Paris Hotel, (2) Cash and Credit Cards are accepted here. (3) Try to get the patio seating because it's a great spot to people watch since it faces Las Vegas Blvd.

What was ordered:

Emergen-C Drink ($4.95) - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 stars) - Simply orange juice.  Perfect because it is packed with vitamin C, but also very tasty start for the morning.  The orange juice was served in a flute glass.  The orange juice was not overtly sweet and nicely chilled--yet a bit flat.

Three Eggs ($9.95) - A-Okay (4 Stars) - 3 eggs with your choice of crispy bacon or sausage.  All egg dishes are served with breakfast potatoes (aka hash browns) and toast.  Let me give you the breakfast entree breakdown:

*3 eggs - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - You get your choice of how you want your eggs cooked--scrambled or sunny side up.  I chose scrambled and they were cooked very nicely.  Mmm, tasted so good with ketchup.  I wanted to add some Tapatio (or any hot sauce), but I didn't think they had it and was a bit embarrassed to ask for it.

*Sausage - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - You have a choice of regular or chicken sausage.  I chose regular sausage--you get 2 elongated ones.  The sausages were approximately 6 inches in length and 0.7" in diameter.  The skin were cooked to a beautiful toasty brown color.  The sausage was nothing more than porky heavenly goodness.

*Breakfast Potatoes - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - Approximately 5" x 5" square area of hash browns.  The outer portion was cooked until nicely toasted--with a perfectly soft texture on the inside.  

*Toast - Meh! I had better (2 Stars) - You get two pieces of thick toasted bread--3.5" x 3" x 1.5."  All I can really say is it felt like eating extra large croutons.

The Mon Ami Gabi staff seated us on the patio which is perfect because the weather was nice and we could people watch at the same time.  It is nice to finally relax with the family and have good food.  The food here is good, but was not extraordinary--hence my struggle.  I've rounded up so Yay! I'm a Fan!

Bonjour Mes Amis 

Dit mon la verite'! 5 stars?!? 
Ca c'est bon 

Lafitte's seems to be one of the nicest restaurants in the area, and still quite affordable, considering what you get for your money. 
(and this from a bonifide cheapskate) 

It was also nearly empty for Sunday dinner, but I'm sure that is something that varies greatly seasonally. Lafitte's is hidden inside of the Embassy Fountain Suites Hotel s.e. corner of I-17 and Greenway Rd, and is a little cajun/creole restaurant that really is a Lagniappe! 

The menu was quite large and much more varied than I thought it would be. (not all seafood) 
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served. 
Gumbo, Jambalaya, soup, Po'Boy and a bunch of other sandwiches, salads, pizza, entrees from pasta and veggies to fillet, ribs, prime rib, and more scrimps than you, Capt. Dan (and Bubba, en spirit) could ever get from a night out on the Jenny in the bayou. 

The baby back ribs had both a dry rub and a sauce glazed on while grilling ~sweet, spicy (could've been a tad hotter), tender and meaty and moist. 

The prime rib came in a slab worthy of Fred Flintstones dinner plate. The large portion was seriously somewhere between two and three inches thick, and the portion and it's demi-glace filled HALF of the plate, shoving the colorful mixed veggies to one side, and the side order of chicken and sausage jambalaya -- luckily in it's own little cup -- was moved onto the table to accommodate meat-slab-slicing-room. 
The beef was cooked perfectly to order (MR for me, R for pop), tender, flavorful with or without the sauce, and just the right amount of fattiness. 
Let us return to that jambalaya. WHEW BOYEE, it was a delicious dark gravy stew over rice that easily could be a satisfying meal on its own! C'est magnifique, I gau-RUN-tee! 

There were two different scrimps dishes at the table as well, which both must have been really good, because neither the saucy one or the pasta-ey one got shared with anyone! 

There is a tasty although probably over-hyped ice cream dish on the desert menu that seems like some sort of cake but is really just a big slab of Neapolitan ice cream with a tiny bit of meringue on the outside. 

Service was superb! Our server was lively, attentive, funny, and really nice. She was knowledgeable about the dishes, offered recommendations when asked (even a bit of a Miracle on 34th Street-ish: "I'd get one of the other sides, not because the sweet potato fries are bad, they're just average, and so many of the other sides you'd be missing are so good"), and was also familiar with the details (and made sure we were, too) of the restaurant.com coupon. 

The restaurant.com coupon was what really made this a smokin' deal, and I heard from a coworker that they have a BOGO in the Entertainment book ,too. Even without the deals, the menu is really not very expensive considering the quality and portion size that you get at Lafitte's. 4 out of 5 dinner entrees were all $16, with many choices on either side of that average. Lunch sammies complete with side of fries or ? are around $8-9. The ice cream conglomeration fed all 5 of us for $8. Not bad 'tall, mon cheri. 

Laisser les bons temps rouler !

I've had this Bosnian restaurant bookmarked for some time and finally my friend and I were able to stop by for dinner. Located in a tiny strip mall, the dcor was neatly arranged with cultural artifacts, white table clothes, and the atmosphere was spacious and cozy. 

The menu was smaller and more affordable than my visit to Saraj. We decided to start off with a Home Style Bean Soup ($5) filled with light tasting Bosnian beans and chunks of beef here and there. Very hearty as the bowl warmed the belly. The beans boast wonderful flavor with hints of beef to render depth. The owner was very generous to give us a second serving so there was plenty to share.  

Next, the Stuffed Cabbage ($5) arrived with boiled cabbage stuffed with ground beef that came with onions, peppers, and other seasonings with a dollop of sour cream on top. The cabbage was soft, naturally sweet, and easy to bite into. The ground beef had some pop due to the seasonings with a nicely broth to bring to a finer note. They were much bigger than the ones at Saraj as there were plenty of ground beef to fill the center. So delicious, it's something I'm eager to have again.

Their highly recommended item, the Bosnian Sausage Sandwich ($7), came with 10 pieces of small Bosnian sausages sandwiched held in-between two thick fluffy fried breads. The bread was slightly browned and crispy on the outside and spongy on the inside. The sausages were savory delicious and wonderfully seasoned. The sandwich also came with creamy red pepper sauce and raw onions to ignite sweet and sharp contrasts.

The extra fried bread for the bean soup was superfluous. Service-wise, the server was Bosnian but not particularly knowledgeable about the cuisine. The owner, however, was very warm, friendly, and managed to come out of the kitchen to greet us and address questions. Interested diners should know that they also have authentic Bosnian items that are not listed on the menu. 

4.5 stars. Cheaper, bigger, and better than Saraj. This is one of the most overlooked places in the Valley. I would love to come back to try their veal and assortment of desserts.

Part of what makes Yelp so exciting, at least for me, is finding places that I might not normally hear about. Rock 'N'oodles is definitely one of those good finds! I don't live or work anywhere near downtown and would have probably never seen it otherwise. It's a small building right off Charleston on 3rd Street that would be easy to miss if you were driving by. The restaurant itself is very small and can only seat about 12 people plus a couple outside tables. I love the dcor though, it's simple but awesome with an entire wall covered in great albums they've got in really cool little frames.

When it comes to the food, you'll quickly realize why it's called Rock 'N'oodles. All the dishes are named after songs like Great Balls of Fire, Californication & The Devil Went Down To Georgia, just to name a few. Two of the ones we've tried so far now are Buffalo Soldier and Sweet Home Alabama...which I can only describe as versions of mac 'n cheese on steroids! The Alabama is a gouda macaroni topped with popcorn chicken and BBQ sauce with some bacon and onions tossed in. With the Buffalo Soldier you get blue cheese macaroni with carrots and celery topped with buffalo chicken. Now, like I said...steroids! Flavor is spectacular in both, pasta is cooked perfectly and each bite just keeps you wanting more! 

I've noticed some reviews mention small portions. I can only assume the owner/management are paying attention because these are definitely not small plates. We've also tried Born On The Bayou and Paradise City...I was only able to finish my entire plate once. On top of that, the customer service is great and even after my son accidentally spilled his Sprite all over the counter, we were met with smiles and a friendly attitude! Prices aren't bad either, with the most expensive dish coming in at about $12. This is a must try spot!

Yes, we hit all 7 buffets within a 24-hour period!  We can't say we ate full meals at each, and we can't say we really enjoyed the last few buffets.  But we did it, and we brag about it on a regular basis.

First, a note... my husband and I do not have an eating problem.  We only intended to hit 3 or 4 buffets.  You can get your money's worth doing that.  But once we got a couple under our belt, then it became a pride thing to complete the challenge.  So here's how we did it.

#1 - Caesar's
We started with lunch on Friday.  The food and the atmosphere is great here.  But considering the size of Caesar's, I was surprised by how small the buffet is.  It seems they go for quality over quantity, which is not always my preference.  There was a line to get in, so keep that in mind when planning.

#2 - Harrah's
We were walking by the casino, and there was no line.  So we went in to check out the options and ended up getting a second dessert.  There's not a lot of buffets where cotton candy is available.. it was a nice, light treat.

#3 - Imperial Palace
It's an older property, and the buffet is not much more than a small cafeteria.  We got a quick salad, and moved right along.

#4 - Flamingo
I did another dessert here.  Don't judge... I'm a sucker for a chocolate fountain!  And if you're walking the Strip, the Flamingo is right next to the Imperial Palace.  So it was easier to get some chocolate and then go to dinner, rather than back-track.

#5 - Paris
We had a nice dinner here.  Again, there was a line to get in.  But since we had already hit 4 buffets during the afternoon hours, having some extra time to digest didn't bother me.  There's some nicer high-end items at the Paris, but with a higher quantity than Caesar's.  So it was one of the best of the bunch.

#6 - Rio
We didn't wake up hungry on Saturday, but the Rio Carnival buffet has always been one of my favorites.  And on weekend mornings, mimosas are included.  So knowing the hard part was over, we gathered up what was left of our appetites and headed back towards the Strip.  We would have had a nice leisurely breakfast, if we didn't have to keep an eye on the clock.  But there was one more stop....

# 7 - Planet Hollywood
In retrospect, I wish we had done this one earlier.  I had never been before, and I think I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't stuffed myself over the past 23 hours.  There are some great international items, including fresh made naan.   Unfortunately, I only had a few bites before I told my husband it was time to go home and nap.

A final note... your 24 hours start when you purchase the first buffet.  The time will be noted on your receipt.  If you're in line when your time is up, too bad.  There are generally lines at Caesar's, Paris, Rio and Planet Hollywood... some of them can be up to an hour, if you go at a peak time.  So keep that in mind, if you want to hit all 7.

I've never written about him before, I have a gay father. Well, technically he's not my real father but a man who I met some years ago. Coming out for me was pretty tough, married, house in the suburbs and a wife who I loved deeply. After coming out to her, my family and friends, my therapist suggested I quickly join an online support group for married gay men, and that's where I met Larry Johnson. A kind older man, Larry immediately took me under his wing; living in San Francisco it was easy for him to show me more about our mutual passion, food.  

Over the years we've exchanged thousands of emails and I've visited him in SF as often as I could, Larry taught me a great deal about fine dining. Including how to have food adventures and about getting the most out of life's pleasures. While my mom will always be my first food hero, Larry will always be my gay dad and has helped to make me who I am today. 

So when he comes into town for a visit I'm always a little stressed out about where to take him for dinner. This visit was easy, I decided to choose something basic and straight forward like steak. Opened 60 years ago, Durant's is not only a Phoenix institution but is also a great steakhouse. While the trend of new steakhouses in the Valley has finally started to taper off, Durant's classic approach is commendable and endearing. I'm talking about fantastically tender steak, understandable sides and professional service. 

Steakhouses in general are probably some of the most expensive restaurants in town. So I was ready to spend a mint on dinner but did notice one thing at Durant's, the steaks aren't ala carte. This means when you order a steak you're not only getting soup or salad but you're also getting your choice of accompaniment, what a value.

Entering Durant's from the rear will take you right through the kitchen, dont worry about this, its all part of the charm. You'll see that the kitchen is spotless and most of the cooks turn around and give you a warm smile and a happy hello. Once you get into the dining room its all old school. Black leather booths, crushed red velour wallpaper and dim lighting all set the mood for a relaxed and subdued dinner experience. 

Ordering the 16 oz Ribeye Steak ($39.50) was an easy choice for most steak lovers. The ribeye for has the perfect amount of marbling to meat ratio, this means that the meat will be really flavorful without being too fatty. I have to tell you, the ribeye at Durant's was one of the best steaks I've had in years. This thick juicy steak was everything that a steak should be, slightly salty with a distinct smoky char and perfectly tender. I also upgraded my side to the Stuffed Baked Potato ($4.95), think twice baked potato. 

Larry's 8oz New York Strip ($29.50) and loaded baked potato were delivered. Not only was the steak perfectly seasoned, it was expertly cooked at medium-rare as requested. 

A silence fell over the table as we enjoyed our meals together. Durant's not only impressed me and me made look good, but they made me proud of our restaurant heritage here in Phoenix. Durant's, thank you.

Herbs & Rye was one of those late dinners with Terri R that was on a whim.  Herbs & Rye looks like a pub on the outside, even has that feel when you walk in. All I know is that it was a very long day, I was starving, and anything that was food would have hit the spot.  In other words, I didn't expect much coming in. Maybe a good thing that I didn't expect much because I was actually surprised by the menu.  I expected nothing but fried dishes or meals with zero sustenance. What I found was a menu ranging from apps to steaks.  Prices are not pub prices though.  Price here is what you are to expect at a steakhouse.  A ton of really tempting items on this menu like Filet Mignon and Lobster, Burgers, and other steak options.  

With all the recent talk about White Castle here in Vegas for the last couple of days (compliments of the Foodie Fest), I decided on their sliders.  The presentation of these sliders is probably the best I've seen in awhile.  It at least kicks White Castle's butt.  I thought that the sliders were pretty good, but just a little rich.  We also got their fully loaded calamari.  To me, I thought it was one big workout killing mess.  It had a ton of what appears to be mayo, bacon, and some other add ons.  Both Terri and I, scraped off this mess and ate some calamari the way it should be eaten.  

As for the ambiance, you can say that you get two types.  When you walk in, you have the bar to the right where all the action is.  It's louder, brighter, and this is where everyone else is eating.  Then you got the quiet side where it's dimmer, quiet, and barely where anyone is dining.  Normally, I'm good with either side. But on this night, the dining was a little too tight on the bar side. So, we ate where it was quieter and darker.  Since it was also late, keeping ourselves from falling asleep was a challenge in itself.  My other concern is that we would be forgotten and our orders never taken.  This wasn't an issue at Herbs & Rye.  Regardless which side you choose to eat, service seems to be right on. 

Overall, Herbs & Rye is a decent place to meet with friends, grab a drink, and some dinner.  I'm not a huge fan of pubs in general, but I still have my favorites.  Herbs and Rye can easily be one of them.  

PS:  I don't drink, but there's a some great Happy Hour specials here.  For all you HH dudes and gals, give this place a try.

4/7/10

Wanted to try this place back in March when Mom and I spotted an ad mentioning Filipino food in the plaza, but we'd already eaten pho, so had to wait until the next shopping opportunity brought us to this area again.  Met the very warm and friendly owners-- we really do wish them great success!

Since it was almost closing time, the food items in the buffet, and there weren't many to choose from, didn't look interesting, so we decided to try the pork skewers (the recipe of which the husband and wife team were very proud of), as well as the liempo (pork belly) serving that called out to Mom.  A combo plate of these two items also came with rice and achara (pickled papaya and carrots).  I also ordered one piece of saba at langka [saba bananas (or in this case, plantains) and jackfruit, wrapped in lumpia wrapper and deep-fried].

The wait for our food took longer than I expected, but it wasn't too much of an issue since Mom took awhile to do the groceries.  The wait, however, was worth it!  I really enjoyed the pork barbecue skewers- the flavors really took me back to my childhood in the Philippines, when street food, already a daily ritual for us then (and just now gaining popularity stateside) had us sampling BBQ, fried fishballs (and the many different sauces to dip them in!), steamed rolled rice and tuber pancakes, ripe and sour mangoes (the latter eaten with bagoong (very tiny salted shrimp) or vinegar and garlic, and "dirty" ice cream, to name a few from food carts that were to be seen all over Metro Manila and around colleges (grammar schools) and universities ("colleges" here).  Writing about those pork skewers actually make me want to stop at Mekong Plaza now, instead of going for Italian or French food I was considering earlier!  The liempo, on the other hand, I could've gone without; I remember thinking that we should've just ordered a double of the BBQ!  The skewers were just more flavorful than the pork belly pieces.  While Mom enjoyed the liempo, she did agree that the BBQ was were the money was at, and the owners really did have something to be proud of!

Let's not forget the dessert!  On second thought, maybe we should.  First, I didn't care for the presentation.  Take a gander at the photos, and you'll see what I mean.  Second, it wasn't very sweet.  Not even sweet enough.  See that pool of caramel sauce the turon rested on?  I did not leave a single drop on the plate!  Not because it was so delicious, but because the roll really needed the added punch.  Mom already knew it wasn't going to be anything to write home about, just by looking at the offering, but did wait till I took a couple of bites before saying "I should've just bought the ingredients at Mekong and made you those at home!"  My sentiments exactly, Mommy dearest!

Oh, but the pork BBQ!  Run and try some now!

Thanks Yelp, I know you're not a dating site, but Flores AC and my air conditioner are a match made in heaven and it was love at first sight! 

It was a grueling day, manual labor in the hot Phoenix sun really does a number on you. Mid July, 110 degrees, sweating so much people think you just jumped in the neighbor's pool. whew. I get my underoos in a bunch just thinking about people who work outside. Luckily, I just have a quick walk from the office, to the car then the car to the perfectly cooled 87 degree condo in CenPho. It's on a timer and set to start cooling exactly 45 minutes prior to my daily arrival. 

What the? What's going on? OMG. No. Please, no. Wait, NOOOOO. Now don't hyperventilate. You've seen this before. OK. Breathe, deep breaths. I think I remember someone suggesting to turn off the AC for an hour, killing the compressor. Sometimes the coolant lines can get frozen. Yes, that's right. I know its 110 degrees outside, but yes this sometimes does happen. I guess this is a good time to swap out my return air filter - it is a few weeks overdue once every 2-3 months. So after an hour; well, it could have been like 58 minutes, but I didn't really want to wait any longer. I cut the air back on, gave it 10 minutes and still nothing. Well, these tried and true AC tricks didn't quite cut it this time. Time to get someone to Yelp me out with this one.

I popped open Yelp and searched my way through Phoenix for "Air Conditioning", a handful of results showed up but really, my first call was Flores AC. They outshine just about everyone else that came up by a good 30 reviews and have a 4.5 overall rating. This is my guy. 

I explained to him that I tried everything in my bag of tricks already, but I was just blowing a bunch of hot air. "No problem" he replied and said "I'll be there in 15 minutes." really? 15 minutes? whatever. "OK hunny, they'll be here sometime soon-ish." They said 15 minutes, but I dunno. I'll believe it when I see it."

... Told you so, service guys and contractors, they never get here on time. 15 minutes. I knew he couldn't get here in 15 minutes; heh, now where's my free pizza? pssshh.  It took them 17 minutes to get here. I knew it, two minutes. 

He had my AC fixed up in about 20 minutes, apparently a bad compressor. At just $160 for the part, the call, and his time - those other guys have done me wrong for the last time. 

From walking in the door and discovering my AC wasn't working to happily signing the charge to my credit card, 1.5 hours - you just don't find that anywhere else. They were super friendly, family owned, and in business since 1980 something. Lets face it. 30+ years is longer than some people have lived in Phoenix, let alone been doing AC in Phoenix. Fully licensed, bonded, and insured; you don't have to worry about weather or not you're getting some Joe off the street; or George, Chas, or Parker for that matter.

Stay cool Phoenix and happy Yelping!

***There are some great things about Guy Savoy like the lobster with beets in cold steam, the great service, and the nice dining room, but like other Las Vegas restaurants, it is very overpriced***

Guy Savoy definitely reminds me of Joel Robuchon.  They both feature formal fine dining French cuisine from esteemed chefs and very expensive tasting menus and a la carte items as well as lavish bread carts and dessert trolleys.  The restaurants are quite different though.  Savoy has a minimalist and modern decor.  It feels much more elegant, comfortable and less distracting than the over-the-top and all over the place elegant decor at Robuchon.  Savoy also features much more personable service that is still professional and polite.

In terms of the food, it is hard for me to compare Savoy to Robuchon because I had a few a la carte items at Savoy while I had a tasting menu with many, many courses at Robuchon.  In terms of bread, Robuchon is better.  Both feature a wide variety of bread, but I felt Robuchon's bread had better textures as well as much more distinct flavors (Robuchon's bread was warmer and felt fresher too).

Robuchon's dessert trolley is significantly better than the one at Savoy.  Robuchon's lavish dessert trolley is an extravagant and over-the-top movable feast of sweets while Savoy is more of a small selection sweets on a nice tableside cart.  Variety is not the only reason why Robuchon is better.  The sweet treats at Robuchon have much better (and more interesting) flavors.

In terms of the food, I had really good things at Robuchon and Savoy but nothing as good as what I have had at Bay Area fine dining spots like The French Laundry, Cyrus or Manresa.

There were bright spots.  I really liked the lobster and jumbo lump crab with beets and cold steam from seaweed water.  There were great beet cups filled with creamy beet mousse and soft, fresh and moist crab.  There was also lobster carpaccio that was topped with minced golden beets; the beets had a great sweet flavor that was reminiscent of fruit.  There was also warm and nicely cooked lobster meat--fresh, moist and soft.

There was even puff pastry topped with beet ribbons.  The finishing touch was great seaweed aroma from the cold steam that enveloped the food (cool effect and great fragrance).

I also liked the mushroom brioche topped with black truffle butter.  The brioche was warm, buttery, crispy, and flaky (and the black truffle flavor was very prominent).  The accompanying black truffle and artichoke soup was just okay.

The amuse of foie gras with brioche was good--rich, creamy and a great foie gras flavor.  The pumpkin soup amuse was good though surprisingly thin.

Other courses were not as good.  The crab tart was just soggy and boring and I probably should have ordered the veal three ways as my entree.  They present the veal chop before they slice it and it was very nicely cooked--a great golden brown sear.

My entree was a variety of game birds cooked in a pot.  The cooking in the pot yielded tender and moist meat, but there were no contrasts in textures so the meats were a little uninteresting.  I thought the pheasant was good.  I thought the squab was good too, but I prefer it when they achieve a crispy skin on squab.

I was not a fan of the Mallard duck.  Like the squab, there was no crispy skin.  The flavor of the duck was very strong--interesting but not my favorite flavor.  The texture was off-putting.  The texture of the duck meat was squishy and a tad rubbery; it ended up being similar to the unique texture of squab.

The garnishes were good though a tad rustic for such a fine dining spot.  There was some good sweet and sour cabbage and wild mushrooms.  There was also a nicely cooked, buttery and smooth foie gras.

While the savory courses were a mix of good and average, I was not a fan of Savoy's desserts.  I ordered the coconut six ways and while I really liked the light and crispy coconut flakes and tapioca, I did not like the rest of the dish.  It was like various bland ingredients in water.

The mignardises from the trolley were okay; the pate de fruit was kind of hard and overly sugared.  The dark chocolate ice cream was rich and good though and I liked the flavor of the earl grey sorbet with English cream and black pepper. 

As mentioned, service was good; prices were too high, but that is often the case with high-end Vegas restaurants.

I did not love Robuchon, but I preferred it to Savoy.  There were some nice things about Savoy, but the food is just too expensive for just so many okay dishes.  I think your money would be much better spent on a dinner at an upscale Bay Area spot like Manresa.  If you do want a nice dinner in Vegas, I recommend the much more price friendly Picasso or L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (seasonal tasting menu).

Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Caesars Palace offers both free valet and self parking.

We arrived at Snooze for what would be our final meal here AZ before heading back home. My sister claims this is her favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix--which is a huge recommendation considering every breakfast here has been terrific. As I perused the menu I noticed they had a nice selection of fancy pancakes and they all sounded terrific. My Brother-in-law pointed out that they had a thing called the "Pancake Flight" where you can choose any three flavors you want.

Pancake Flight:

Pineapple Upside Down Pancake- I had to get this since it was one of the Yelp Review Highlights, and it was pretty good but didn't live up to the hype. I actually would've appreciated more Pineapple in it. While it was good, I doubt I'd order it again. 3*

Molten Chocolate Lava Pancake- This was a little slice of Heaven; it's a chocolate buttermilk pancake with a huge dollop of chocolate custard in the middle and topped with a Tangerine Glaze. Oh, yeah.. it's as good as it sounds. 4.5*

Pancake of the Day- Snooze features a different Pancake everyday, so be sure to ask your server before making any final decisions. On the day I was there it was some kind of Salted Caramel/Cinnamon concoction with a dollop of Ancho-Chocolate Custard in the middle. My jaw dropped as our waitress described it--much as yours did as you read my description. It was superb, and if you're lucky enough to be there when they feature it you *must* get it. 5*

Chocolate-Peanut Butter- My wife ordered this as a side to her eggs, and it was so massive I had to help her finish it--one of the perks when you're married to a light eater! It was pretty good, and tasted a lot like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. I'm not a huge Reese's fan, but if you are then this should be right up your alley! 3.5*

Coffee- Above-standard Diner Coffee, but nothing special. They have a whole placard on your table ballyhooing their coffee, but I just didn't get it. 3.5*

Service & Ambiance- Our server was excellent, and I wish I could remember her name and give her credit, but I misplaced the receipt as well. She was a tall, pretty brunette--you can't miss her. Snooze is a very clean and modern-looking, but I found some of their decorations to be a bit cloying--especially that huge asterisk logo thingy. The place also gets very loud, which I don't particularly want first thing in the morning. Time to invest in some sound dampeners, me thinks. 4.5*-service/2.5*-Ambiance

Value- Standard AZ value of less than $10 for breakfast, but still cheaper than Cali pricing. 4*

Everyone really enjoyed their breakfast here at Snooze; I was tempted to give it a 5th star, but the noise factor was a bit of a turn-off. I'd still probably say it's a solid 4.5-star breakfast joint, and I'd definitely go again and again if I lived in the area; I'll just try to remember to bring some earplugs next time.

I like this place so much I'm selling it to the Yelp world for free. Cromwell and Victor Drai, you're welcome. If you are hitting Vegas with a group of girls and no guys, this is DEFINITELY the club to pick. Drai's is exceptionally girl-friendly, even for Vegas. If you are going with just girls, send me a Yelp message, and I'll send the number for Mike, the super awesome promoter that got me and a female friend in for free last night. 

NOTE: Please remember that clubs care about image... Facts- you should be dressed very well and are expected to be decently attractive and look 30 or under if you want to get in with a promoter.

Since it was slow at 10:30, they gave a whole bunch of groups of girls a table and free champagne until the table was sold later on. Such an awesome perk, especially since you know every girl is wearing painful, hot-looking shoes. I've been to XS, Hakkasan, Haze, Marquee, and LiFE, and gotten free drink tickets, but I've only seen this extra mile at Drai's, and I've seen it more than once. (No promises on a table, but they will take care of you if possible.)

The club design maximizes room for people that didn't get a table, so you have plenty of room to move around and dance still. Unlike Hakkasan. The energy is fantastic here because it's an open space. Be prepared to wait for a drink, though, likely from a pissed off-looking bartender.

If you got a table, there is plenty of room to dance, and service has always been fantastic. Even the bouncers were so incredibly nice to my friend and I. Just don't be #basic by taking your shoes off. Get you some Dr Scholls and go to Drai's.  :)

The effects are so bomb with lasers, lights, cold air, and massive screens lining the roof and ceiling. 

Of note- music mixes hip hop, Top 40, and EDM, depending what day and time it is. I was here twice this week, and on Thursday it was all hip hop. Not a fan. If you like EDM like me, I would check the Vegas EDM calendar for Thursdays.

Saturday around 11PM was all vocal EDM before switching to the guest DJ. Their only downfall is that Drai's don't have a resident DJ with a huge name, so you don't really know what you are going to get unless they have a headliner that week, and they seem to be lining up famous DJs now.
Sundays, I believe, are hip-hoppish as well. (XS is perfect for Sundays with good crowds, by the way.... You're welcome, too, XS!)

After we left Drai's, the guys at the door even asked us if we wanted to go to Drai's After Hours for free. Definitely the place to be if you are all girls. It's a really, really fun club, and you will never have trouble finding the bathroom here either like in other clubs. :)

Dating Guide for Dummies, Vol. 4: How to properly club & hit on a group of bodacious bimbos at an A-list Vegas night club.

In this edition of DG for D's, I'm going to cover a premiere Vegas night club and extract it's venue perks towards your benefit.  This is also one of the few clubs where every girl will still look amazing after the lights turn on, so there's no need to rush out.

When you go to a night club, you need to be fresh, look fresh, and feel fresh.  The girls don't get Barbie'd up for nothing in this town so you need to do your part too, but do it with a cool sense of casual-class and finesse.  Down-dress with a nice untucked dress shirt with your sleeves rolled, slim designer jeans, dress shoes other than black, and a loose, solid tie (optional, but highly recommended). 

Now on to the venue, XS is a club where the guys "can" get some loving, but how, you ask?  I feel your pain brother, that's why I wrote this installment.  Main rule of thumb, don't wait in the 2 hour line and don't go in broke.  Even if you manage to walk in with a group of lovely girls, you will need to order drinks.  Your best bet is to cut the line by booking a VIP table and/or cabana with your boys and splitting the costs.  Girls love VIP and they love free bottle service so you're sure to attract a herd of them.  With that said, if you're not hitting it off, limit those skanks to 1 drink or risk getting played.

Did I mention the girls are easy?  For the most part they are.  Trust me, 85% are there to get some sort of action: simple flirting, subtle make out sessions, someone to dance with, or straight answer how they like their eggs in the morning question.  Over easy please.  Stay away from the other 15%, you'll immediately know who they are and don't question the validity of these statistics, it's certified as I've scientifically proven them during my last visit.

Make sure to stay away from any pair of girls since they usually want to dance with themselves, unless they approach you or emit an inviting aura a la cutesy wandering eyes.  Also, steer clear of groups larger than 4 unless you have backup.  There's too much criticism amongst these felines and you'll be heavily scrutinized.  Even if the entire group digs you, it takes one crazy bitch to say stop-no-and-don't to ruin your game.  3 is the magic number fellas, there are less girls to impress and you'll get a chance to charm them up on a more intimate level.  If you happen to cusp one away from her pack, the other two girls will still have each other so she's really not leaving her girls hanging.  Once you do, take her outside to cool off and dance at the shallow end of the pool.  Trust me and get your feet wet, this will show her your fun, adventurous side.

If you arrive a little late, well that's perfect!  The girls are already liquored up from the many guys offering them free drinks.  This is a good thing as these guys haven't read my guide so they're making our jobs easier and cheaper.  They don't call me Dr. Date, aka Mr. Steal-Your-Girl for nothing.  Have no shame, just roll on in and commit a robbery.  Also remember, these girls are already wet from how magnificent the venue is: the euro style dcor and endless stripper poles, flashing lights and fancy limelights, gorgeously-lit pool area and spacious outdoor dance floor, loungy plush-white day beds, and party-rocking-world-class dj's.  XS is really doing us a favor.  You paid for it so use it towards your advantage.

Now go, young padawan, for you have the tools necessary to roam the short skirts of XS.  May good luck and fortune bestow upon you.  And remember kids, what happens in Vegas, stays...except for herpes.  That shit will come home with you.

***Mandalay Bay's Fleur is a good option for an upscale lunch in Las Vegas***

Fleur used to be Fleur de Lys, a more traditional fine dining restaurant (based on the original SF location), but Hubert Keller converted it into Fleur, a modern tapas spot (probably to better align with the diverse crowd that Vegas attracts).

I tried Fleur a few years ago and for the most part the food was good (with some just okay dishes here and there).  Despite the quality of the food, the portions were incredibly dainty making Fleur feel quite overpriced.

For lunch, Fleur works better though (at least in terms of value).  There is a mix of small plates so you can get a small taste of what Fleur cooks up at dinner.  There are also more substantial lunch plates--sandwiches and salads but also entrees like steak frites and salmon.

I started with the burrata salad--something I would expect to see on the dinner menu and it was actually a substantial starter.  There was a generous portion of burrata, which was very creamy.  The burrata sat on some good, juicy and sweet heirloom tomatoes.  The burrata was topped with tomato pearls.

There was also olive oil powder and basil powder.  The basil powder had a stronger flavor, but the olive oil powder had a more memorable texture as it turned to almost cream upon tasting it.

Everything was garnished with a really good balsamic--a very deep and rich flavor.  There was also a side of bread, which was just okay--they probably should have toasted it.

For my entree, I went with the steak frites, which included a very generous portion of hanger steak.  There were two pieces of steak.  One was cooked very nicely.  It was incredibly tender and also quite juicy.  The even cooking of the steak (maybe it was sous vide) was very impressive.  There was also a good outside sear.

The other piece of steak was not as good (maybe the unevenness of temperature had to with how the pieces were quite different in size).  The steak was okay, but it was not as tender and a little dry in parts.

The steak had a good flavor; I still would have preferred more seasoning because the sauce was too light in flavor to add much.  With steak frites, I like a richer bordelaise like the one at Lucques (Los Angeles).

The herb garlic frites were nice and crisp.  The frites were a little uneven in seasoning as some frites had more of a garlic flavor, which was nice.

They had several desserts, but I didn't think much sounded exciting.  I ended up opting for the almond panna cotta.  The panna cotta was topped with strawberry citrus soup and then garnished with blackberries, streusel, and kalamansi blackberry sorbet.  The panna cotta had a great consistency.  It was creamy, smooth and light.

There was not much of an almond flavor while there was an overabundance of strawberry citrus soup.  The strawberry soup kind of overpowered the panna cotta.

I liked the streusel, which was buttery and crisp.  The kalamansi blackberry sorbet was also good--not icy and very cool and refreshing.

Service was very good.  My server was personable and polite.  He was also very attentive and intuitive even though he had to service many tables.  The hostess was nice too (and attractive if that is important to you).

As mentioned, prices are not too bad.  Almost everything was priced under $20 and portions were more than generous on a few plates.

For lunch, only the cafe is open.  While the decor is nice and contemporary, it is close to the casino so you have to deal with casino noise; the cigarette smoke also wafts over a little bit, which is unfortunate.

For dinner, the main dining room is much nicer.  The room is very contemporary, but it is also very warm (great use of warm colors) and inviting.  It is also farther back in the restaurant, which makes it feel like a nice and relaxing retreat from Vegas.

The food at Fleur is good for both lunch and dinner, but lunch is much more affordable.  There are not many notable upscale places open for lunch in Vegas so it is nice to have an option like Fleur available.

Fleur is located in Mandalay Bay and like many casinos, Mandalay Bay has its own free parking structure.  The structure leads right to Fleur's entrance.

When I saw their signature Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles platter on a Las Vegas television show one night I knew I had to try this.  As my buddies stopped into the Imperial Palace casino to throw away a little more cash I decided a mid day feast was in order.  I imagined this place would get pretty crowded, but at 4:30 in the afternoon on a weekend this restaurant was surprisingly empty.

My buddies later told me they were concerned that a huge meal a day before the marathon would hamper their performance.  I'm a slower runner than they are though so my only concern was to finish the race and have fun doing it.

Back to the restaurant I was greeted and offered a seat at the bar or a table.  I noticed an attractive vixen sitting alone at the bar so I decided I was going to go there and offer her a bit of companionship.  As I sat comfortably into my seat I couldn't help but notice this dainty young lady was eating from two giant platters of food.  She acknowledged my presence, turned to me, smiled, greeted me and told me she's a dancer and hadn't eaten all day.  Don't mind my stare, lady!  I'm not checking out your perfect physique, but I do have an eye on the humongous burger on your plate.  Wait!  Do all showgirls eat like this?

I finally picked up my menu.  They offer fresh squeezed fruit juices in 10 ounce and 20 ounce glasses so I went with a fresh tangerine juice, but I'm sitting at a bar, and how does one not have a beer when they're sitting at a bar?  I selected a Pyramid Apricot Wheat Ale (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=I1ZZCzT_lKHJ_YthVtc-Cw) and ice water knowing all to well I needed to stay hydrated for the run ahead.

I took a quick glance at the food menu although I knew exactly what I wanted to try the minute I walked into the restaurant.  I selected the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles.  The service here was outstanding.  Every time the bartender left his station he'd return and give me an update on my food.

I had a crappy camera with me at the time, but this is what I had (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=BagiL1VmvJTeDz_CIsty3w).  It's two huge chicken breasts partial bone attached battered and fried and sitting on an angle atop four squares of bacon-stuffed Belgian waffles drizzled in hot maple syrup.  That's right.  The waffles are stuffed with crispy bacon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=t2IoUrYE-c7cIHRBxkk6ow)!

The weight of the two chicken pieces quickly gave way to gravity as they fell onto the plate.  The chicken breast was amazingly juicy and the crispy batter was well seasoned.  The waffles were fluffy and chewy and I hadn't even gotten to the crispy bacon yet.  This signature dish definitely lived up to its hype.  This was outstanding.  I had to sit awhile after nearly finishing that entire platter.

The dancer did better than I did taking what little food she left in a to-go box.  As she turned, smiled and bid me farewell I couldn't help but notice how gracefully she walked out the door.  I was so stuffed you might have been able to tip me over on my side and rolled me out the door!

Las Vegas dancer or not, this time next year at 4:30 in the afternoon I will be back!

My second favorite buffet is vegas!!! (#1 is Studio B)

I took Kimberly K's awesome advice to take advantage of lunch prices for dinner.  So basically this was my first stop driving into vegas on a Tuesday and we arrived about 30 minutes before lunch was about to end.
Got in for lunch price at $20 and got to eat dinner as well, which is normally $30.  Paying for 5 people, it was a $50 savings!

PRICES: as of 9/6/11  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw?select=O5p34DZJZrd9YRIoHpREMQ

Breakfast : M-F 6am to 11am = $16
Lunch: M-F  11am-4pm = $20
Dinner Sun-Th  4pm-10pm = $30
Gourmet Dinner Fri/Sat  4pm-10pm $37
Weekend Brunch 7am-4pm  $25    (with champagne = $30)

The most important part for me is that they have a pretty good dessert selection : These were my pickings :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ujHiaprwCQ5ewziu0Vi9rw?select=aBragtXmC5EWj12o632S-A

They had: CREME BRULEE, soft serve, banana foster, bread pudding, cute little cone things, carrot cake, tiramisu, cheesecake, chocolate cake, tarts, flan. Ofcourse these were not superb desserts like u would find at jean philippes. But for buffet desserts, i think this is way better than most. Way better than Wynn buffet, which i thought was bad overall. Didn't see any chocolate covered strawberries tho. :( 

Meats and Seafood:
Kobe Top Round, Prime Rib, Ham, Roast Chicken, Turkey. 
(my fave was the top round)
Snow Crab Legs, King Crab Legs, Shrimp Cocktail. 
*crab was a bit salty and not super fresh. but it really didnt' stop anyone for getting heaping piles of it. 

Other stuff they had was Salmon Teriyaki, Miso Chilean Seabass, 3 kinds of mashpotatoes including sweet potato- my fave was the pesto mash potatoes. A few different salads, which werent' that great. pasta salads, soups, chashu bao, salmon and tuna sushi and poke, CA rolls, sliders (meh), pizza, mac and cheese, sausage

I've been to this buffet probably about 5 times over the years, and it's been pretty consistently good IMO. Unfortunately prices keep going up and lines can get ridiculously long. If it were the weekend, i would prefer going to SB, but if i'm here during the weekday, i would definitely recommend coming here for a late lunch/early dinner!!!

***L'Etoile is a very good contemporary fine dining restaurant, but it is also a great showcase of Midwestern farms, Wisconsin cheese and grass fed beef***

More than any restaurant I have tried in the Midwest, L'Etoile is truly committed to local, seasonal cuisine.  The back of the menu lists the many local farms that L'Etoile uses to produce its contemporary fine dining cuisine and the freshness and quality really come across.  A lot of their produce burst with flavor and freshness that is easy to find in California but difficult to find elsewhere.

In addition to the fresh ingredients, L'Etoile utilizes a lot of premium ingredients like chanterelles, high quality prosciutto, buttery and velvety foie gras, and grass fed, dry aged beef. The kitchen also shows great versatility whether it is a fresh and vibrant salad like their tomato, cantaloupe, arugula, and prosciutto salad, an intense and refined fine dining dish like their foie gras with sweet corn, chanterelles and blueberry gastrique or a hearty Midwestern dish like their New York Strip with mashed potatoes, mushrooms and bearnaise.

I enjoyed all the savory courses I had.  Their cantaloupe in their starter salad had a great sweetness and the aftertaste of that fruit was mellowed out.  In addition, the dish was one of the menu items utilizing Asian ingredients (the head chef Tory Miller has an Asian heritage).  The cantaloupe was marinated like kimchi to provided a nice spiciness.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#1Dm_XzeFUsGbh-7ea6UYpw

The seared foie gras was very good--buttery and creamy on the inside and a slightly crispy exterior.  All of the garnishes stood out--earthy chanterelles, very sweet summer corn and a sweet and tart blueberry gastrique.  I think the dish could have benefitted from brioche, a crumble or a streusel because of the creaminess of the dish.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#kZci-HIMA6X0QDqBEI8hxw

They do beef very well here.  They source from a farm that dry ages their beef. L'Etoile then performs additional dry aging.  With dry aging, you can make the meat more flavorful but which can sacrifice juiciness.  That was not the case here.  Despite being a New York Strip and being dry aged, the meat was very tender and juicy.

The meat also had a really strong beef flavor, which you do not always get (even with good beef).  The outside crust was also good--slightly crisp and very flavorful.  The side of mashed potatoes was also very good--rich and very thick (like good French pomme pure).  The other sides (like overcooked shiitake mushrooms) were very ordinary--the kind of food you would get at a run of the mill steakhouse.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#X9QeW2cMEXDG8iUldS1h1Q

For cheeses, they feature 30 varieties of cheese from Wisconsin.  I did not love the cow's milk cheese I had, but it was more because it was not my kind of cheese.  I like softer and creamier cheeses.  The cheese did have a complex flavor--nutty like gouda but also with salty Parmesan notes.  The garnishes were great--really flavorful and crisp walnut toast, spicy hazelnuts and a really good fruit paste of cherries and berries.

For dessert, I had their warm polenta cake with blueberry compote.  The cake was good as was the blueberry topping.  The garnishes did not work though.  I liked the caramel corn but the regular corn (not treated in any way to produce a different texture) just did not work as a dessert. The sour cream and blueberry sorbet was icy and tart.  And given that the polenta cake was not incredibly sweet or rich, I think a good ice cream would have been the better way to go.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-etoile-madison?select=Daphtl19riahtuVjCOvD4g#VYKnzdgfn2KDV7hMZcgsgQ

Service was excellent.  My server Jessica was very personable, polite and polished.  She was also very knowledgeable about the menu, which made me very confident on what I was ordering.  Despite the many courses, the food came out at a very even pace.

Prices are high at L'Etoile, but the quality is very good and portions on several items are very generous.

L'Etoile occupies a very nice space. The room is elegant but also contemporary and the huge windows allow a lot of great natural light to fill the room as well as allow patrons to view Madison's picturesque and lively capital square.

I have not dined at many restaurants in Wisconsin, but I would imagine that L'Etoile has to be one of the very best.  It is one of the best Midwestern restaurants I have been to outside of Chicago.  With its focus on local farms, Wisconsin cheese, high quality beef, and contemporary cooking techniques/styles, L'Etoile is a great restaurant to experience cuisine that reflects both the chef's formal training at great restaurants as well as the high quality food that the midwest has to offer.

Parking via pay lots/structures is available.

My Favorite Vegas Sweet Stop! I got chocolate wasted and wouldn't have minded spending a whole day in this chocolate dream. 

Their chocolate drinks are heavenly. Friend had an italian in a cute hug mug http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=efFt78-ToFIXyJm5ZIjr4g
Dude had an 80s milkshake which was soooo delicious! Love the alice in wonderland "Drink Me" cup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=WslMBkiMScJAM6fOITjHQg

I ADDED BACON to my Guilt Free Omelette (CG style) and this was one of my favorite breakfast dishes i've had in a long time (thanks Janice C!). The omelette had some veggies and cheese, came with a side of potatoes. It came with an awesome sweet biscuit served with a side of butter and a side of milk chocolate!!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=WjX7TqdKnJfQ8_rL21lnNw. The potatoes dipped in the chocolate worked delicious as well. 
Friend had the Brenner Kobe Burger- but didn't swoon over it. But the fries were good. Dipped them in chocolate- even better! 
Shared a apple cinnamon waffle and it came out soo pretty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=ZM1r3Jgh1rIOAd8CLg_w8g
Loved loved the tiny vial of chocolate sauce and the tiny chocolate pearls to dress up our waffles. The Vanilla icecream made it all perfect. 
While waiting for your food, u can check out the boutique inside filled with chocolate galore. The bill even came in the cutest chocolate bar like tin. 
I couldn't leave without getting me the chocolate walnut cookie that Dru C wrote about, at the stand where they also display the chocolate pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=4XrN-0eKjrZ_O1MZPwUwDA, cupcakes and chocolate syringes! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/w8RWhhuKxMiFCpvFvIQ3zg?select=Y_OtGVh8HWQQzXQcHFcZRg
If u like the texture of Mrs Fields cookies, you will love this one which is 10 times better.I can say this is the best cookie i've ever had! It's $5.00, but it's big and super packed with chocolate and every bite is buttery bliss. Just make sure to eat it right away or if you're gonna savor it bite by bite like me and keep putting it away only to open the bag again to take another bite- get an extra bag cuz the grease will seep through- in the good way of course. 

I cannot wait to go back to get myself a couple more cookies and stay for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

*at the Forum Shoppes at Caesar across from the huge ass H and M store. Mens while ur waiting for your girl at the 3 floor H and M, you can get yourself a chocolate syringe and die happy.

I've been by several times and loved everything I had each time. The employees are very courteous and make you feel like family when you are there. I like how affordable the menu is for the quality of food that you get. For $7.99 I got a "Smoked Brisket Sandwich" and for a few bucks more I made it a combo which included a side and a drink. I also added an additional side of "Cheezy Mac & Cheese" to my order. The brisket is smoked for 18 hours and is the best brisket I have had in town. The meat has such great flavor! When it comes to flavor the beans have it and like the brisket, the beans here are the best I've had in town. The macaroni and cheese was very good too. I'm not the type to eat meat off of the bone, but I did try a rib and I enjoyed every bite! So tender and flavorful! For dessert I had "Banana Pudding" priced at $3.99 and it was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. 

Inside is clean and smells like heaven. So does the parking lot where you can on most days see the man himself outside smoking up some of the tasty meats they offer here. If you want to eat at home they offer a variety of party packs. They will even come to your home and bring their own grills and smokers to cater your event. Call them to find out about the packages they have and pricing. I am going to definitely keep the catering in mind for the future!

As they say, "time marches on".

The original POMO was a very special pizzeria, that transported it's diners back to Italy. It was located further south along Scottsdale Road in the Borgata Shopping Center, next to Blanco's. Though small, it had an intimate feel where you could have an easy conversation with you server. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz/pomo-pizzeria-napoletana-scottsdale-2#hrid:DP4ygw0P_5831sjXGX5ecA

The "new" Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria feels like a concept restaurant, sort of like Fox's Olive & Ivy or North, which is not a bad thing. But gone is that old world Italian Grotto elegance and feel. I guess it's only fitting that it's in the former Blooms space. 

Also gone is any mention of POMO's being a certified Napoletana pizzeria, from either APN (Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani) or VPN (Verace Pizza Napoletana). But in truth, the pizzas are still very good and they now have a new, much larger wood fired brick oven. 

The square footage feels three times larger. At times it seems like a dozen or so wait staff are rushing around, delivering pizzas to almost forty tables and that is just inside the restaurant. The outside space is equally large, with a heavy duty tarp covering the diners. I eyed at least two Culinary Managers on the floor keeping track of the staff and food. Nice!
 
The three of us arrived around two o'clock on Black Friday. We were seated pretty quickly, with a good view of the pizza oven. I would highly recommend the location and view. The menu has been updated. And yes it may seem more expensive, given the pricier location near Gainey Ranch and the Hyatt Regency, but it's not. 
http://www.pomopizzeria.com/pomo-scottsdale-menu.pdf. 

I started out by ordering a Cappuccino ($4.00) which was as good as anything I've had at the green mermaid. It had a nice taste but lacked foam. My friends ordered a diet soft drink and a black ice tea, both $2.50. 

Since we remembered how tasty the bruschetta was at the old POMO's we decided to start there. We had the Sorrentina for $7.95 (see photo), which was very good with a hint of garlic. 

Next we decided to share two pizzas. One was their famous Regina Margherita.  It was as tasty and good (though somewhat smaller) as it's predecessor.  I've posted two pictures, a before and after if you will. It was priced at $12.95, same as before.  

The other pizza was their Amatriciana, which comes with saut onions and tiny amount of diced panchetta. It too was very good and priced at $14.95. I believe the key to their delicious tasting pizzas, is the constant and watchful eye as they cook in an over 850 F oven. 

A new addition not found in the old Restaurante, is a grab and go sandwich annex, called "Forno Fabbri, an Italian Market & Mozzarella Bar".  It's to the left as you come into Pomo Cucina and very similar in size and setup to the ones found in Olive and Ivy or the Herb Box. It's a major plus for a quick weekday lunch, one which I will try in the near future. 

Our total for three came to $48.42, including taxes but before gratuities. It seemed fair and the food as I've mention is very good. So Four Stars and yes, we are a Fan of the new Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria. 

Enjoy!

My first Arepas and is was Viva Las Vegas good!

I had to try this place after reading Craig R's review.  I've never had an Arepas before so I was looking forward to trying it.  This place is a stand alone shack on the corner at the end of the north side of the strip.  Seriously its a shack, you cant miss it cuz it sticks out!!!  They have some tables set outside so there are places to for you to eat there.  Saw a few that just swung by and got it to go.   

An Arepa is a flat, round and soft patty made out of cornmeal, which is grilled, making it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and then it can be stuffed with beef, chicken, ham, cheese, beans, shrimp, and many more. These delights are gluten-free, and wheat-free.  Aside from arepas (hot/cold) they also serve empanadas and hallacas which are like tamales.

SInce I was having a really late dinner I decided to try 2 and got a #5 and #7 with a mango drink to wash is down.  I sat down and waited about 10 min and the guy brought it out. 

#5 Roasted Pork Butt  (Pernil) which is Slow Cooked Marinated Pork, Fresh Tomato Slices and cheese.  Damn this was tasty good.  Great flavored pork, tender and juicy.  The cornmeal was grilled perfectly with a crisp!

#7 Reina Pepiada which is Shredded Chicken Breast, Avocado,  Mayonnaise, Cilantro, Green Peas.  Was like a chicken salad as this was a cold version.  They look small but they are actually pretty big and was only able to eat half of this one as I was totally full. 

The guy told me about the 2 homemade sauces they have on the table.  One is green and a milder version but with a really good flavor.  I would buy some of this good stuff.  The red was obviously spicy and so I didn't really use it but it was good.  

This place may look questionable but let me tell you this is a great hole in the wall place to hit up when your in LV.  It's way off the strip so you wont have to deal with lines and strip prices.  They have great tasty food 

Eyes ~ Ok its on the corner and the seats are pretty much on the sidewalk.
Nose ~ Not much to smell when your outside and the wind whipping!
Ear ~ Cars cars cars!
Mouth ~ Damn tasty arepas!
Tummy ~ Stop stuffing more food mouth, I'm freaking full yo!

Lunch here was unexpectedly good!

I had never ate at a Bobby Flay establishment before and was not really in a hurry to try.  Truth be told I've never really been a fan of his but, after reading several reviews of some trusty yelp friends I decided to give this place a try.  The resto is located in Caesar's palace.  The decor is warm but clean and open.  We came here during lunch with no reservation.  Waited about 15min and was seated near the kitchen.  Im realizing more and more that there are tables for 2 which I get but seriously can the tables be a little bigger!!!  I'm just saying!!

So after looking over the menu I remembered that everyone was raving about the tamales so we ordered that, and another appetizer to share and our main.

Tiger shrimp roasted corn tamale ~ First let me say the masa was very light unlike other tamales I've had.  The shrimp was plump and cooked perfectly.  The cilantro sauce was creamy but also very light and really brought the entire dish together.

Blue corn pancake ~ Barbecued Duck with Habanero Chile and Star Anise Sauce.  Holy moly I would have to say this was the star of the dining experience.  I never would have thought to sauce up duck with BBQ.  This was a fantastic dish.  

Smoked Shrimp Tacos ~ Skewered shrimp with Cabbage Slaw and Grilled Tortillas.  It came with 3 salsas to use.  The shrimp had a decent smoke flavor to it.  There was not heat to it although it looked like there could be.  To me it was just your typical shrimp taco.  Nothing too exciting.  The mango salsa with a bit of kick was really tasty.

Grouper ~ I only had a bit of it.  The portion was really bit and had great flavor.  It didn't appear to be dry which I don't care for when eating fish.

We passed on dessert since lunch already started off late plus we had other plans.  All in all I would have to say it was a pleasant experience.  I would not mind coming back here to eat.  

Eyes ~ Warm and inviting decor.
Nose ~ Even though we say near the kitchen there was not a smell that was present!
Ear ~ Not very loud.  Just your usual!
Mouth ~ Duck in BBQ sauce!
Tummy ~ Very well satisfied!

Musashi Japanese Steakhouse
When in Vegas....some of the better restaurants are located just off the strip...that Musashi Japanese Steakhouse was just that.

So, after dropping $400 on a Black Jack table (losing 7 out of  8 hands) in less than 10 minutes it was decided that it was time for dinner.  At least the room was comp.  

Whisked away in a large black vehicle our party arrived at Musashi Japanese Steakhouse.  We were hungry, we were ecstatic....no wait, no line....what a way to go.  We were seated, drinks ordered and menus were served.

Here is what we decided on:

My Ex-Girlfriend

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ

99% Roll

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#mfMYDmaLojuTHenrx-1BbA

NY Steak

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#wcfYoMtMWEiJctnRK8dpPg

Ika-Yaki (Baked Squid)

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#kMmweG5KHbbIklQFy0KWiA

Broiled Salmon

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/BcW7Z9lPmOB_8eS2lEuOqQ?select=O4JtnWgrryVq3aLDTTFYnQ#zPyvxdok-7JyeWyqJKUGmg

It didn't take too long before our food had arrived, but we were running behind schedule as we were....there was another table waiting for us at another event....so we still asked our server to please hurry up....sure enough our food began to arrive.

First the Ika-Yaki.....for those of you who like Baked Squid, this was not a bad dish.  

Next was the Broiled Salmon....the Salmon was very fresh and not over cooked.  Very moist and tasty as it was covered in Teriyaki sauce.  The sauce was just about right, not an over dominating flavor.

This was followed by the NY Steak and Rib-Eye.  I have no idea what a NY Steak is doing in a Japanese Restaurant....but that was what we had ordered.  The Rib-Eye was a much better cut, soft and tender, juicy and topped off with some Teriyaki Sauce.  The NY Steak was done the same way, not too bad...I can't complain much about the NY Steak...just that my preference would be the Rib-Eye.

As we were half way through our meal...the rolls began to come.

The 99% roll came first and was all too good to not eat one piece but you just had to eat 2 pieces or more.

We had one more roll coming.....and our server had just informed me that our Ex-Girlfriend will be a little late.  DARN!!  I picked up my phone and called my Ex....she's late as usual....

Ok....I need to settle down a little....I should have gone for the Porn Star instead.....would have been rolling in style.  So finally our Ex-Girlfriend shows up and we just devour her as quickly as we can.   To my surprise it was very good.  Crab, avocado, spicy tuna with halibut tempura and spicy mayo.

Next time I'm going for the Porn Star, she'll be at the table before the Ex-Girl Friend.  I'm also looking forward to their Kama Sutra roll next time.

Overall, the meal was exotic, climatic with loads of orgasmic flavors.  Such an explosive meal....off to the next event.  Will be back for the Porn Star for sure!!

Place was clean, bathrooms clean, not too loud and a nice atmosphere.  

A restaurant to try when in Vegas!!  

4 Stars

It's in the name. They like to smash burgers! The menu says they use 100% certified angus beef. The burgers are fresh, never frozen, and cooked to order. If you prefer chicken instead of burgers you can find that here too.

Yesterday I picked up my favorite the "Avocado Club" (crispy chicken) for lunch priced at $6.99 and it was delicious. The all white meat crispy chicken has nice flavor. The sandwich had bacon that was freshly cooked, not microwaved or something questionable. Also the sandwich has lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing on it. I love the fries! I'm not picky about how skinny or fat my fries are as long as they are good and these fries paired with the garlic they put on them makes for a nice side to your sandwich or burger. The "Fried Pickles" priced at $2.29 are not good at all here. I have tried them twice now and they are way too greasy. 

They offer a few different salads if burgers and chicken aren't your thing. Also on the menu is the "Spicy Black Bean Burger"  for you veggie burger eaters. For dessert (like you have room) they offer Haagen-Dazs shakes! They range in price from $3.99 - $4.29 and you can get classic vanilla, chocolate and strawberry or you can go for a oreo or nutter butter shake. The "Nutter Butter" is super tasty. There is a kids menu and they serve Coke products (yay coke) and beer. 

I must admit that I only ever come here with a coupon. I signed up for the e-mail club and for my birthday I get a free shake and throughout the year I get coupons for BOGO on entrees. I always present my coupons before I place my order and have never had an issue. There is a offer with your yelp check-in for 10% off any SB meal, but they wont let you combine it with a coupon you already plan to use so I haven't even redeemed mine yet. Nice lunch spot especially with a coupon.

*Please make note that this review contains information about a salon not providing me with services that I paid for. Please proceed with caution when dealing with them*

Also, the owner wrote a note questioning the validity of my review based on negative reviews (completely ignoring the positive ones), but if you look at the review for his store, no one who gave that place a good score has more than a few reviews outside of one person. OBVIOUSLY, he's a scammer. 

Please forgive the one star above, this isn't a zero star system otherwise I gladly would have awarded this wreck of a salon one, or none as the case may be. 

First, the complaints about attitudes and inexperience are spot on. They have NO idea what they're doing at this salon.

I was a member of a different salon (note: these are franchised so they have no accountability to a corporate office which explains that extreme lack of professionalism) and came over to this one as it was closer to my house. 

I asked about specials and packages when I first came in and they explained them to me. I then chose a 12-session package for a little over $100. They told me that this gave me any choice of bed that I wanted. 

The first time I went in everything went relatively smoothly, except they charge you for the tanning canister that is required for you to be able to tan. What was I paying for then? Whatever. I tanned in a bed and then did the spray tan (a ritual I repeated each and every time I went in).

The second time I went in everything went south. They had no idea about my sessions, etc. They eventually 'figured it out' and I went on my way, repeating the steps above - two tans, etc. 

Every single time after that no one could figure out what was going on. I would stand there for 10 minutes waiting to tan while they figured my account out, AGAIN. I have no idea why this happened, and personally, it wasn't my problem. As a consumer with disposable income in this economy I have a right to not have any screw ups when I go to do something as decadent as tanning (and as simple). Forget it, that was never going to happen.

Please repeat the above for the third time.

The fourth time I went in and tanned fine, although the check-in routine stayed the same - confusion, confusion, solution. The spray tan didn't go so well and malfunctioned. Which, by the way, used to happen a lot with this machine, it seemed old. Anyway, the girl gave me a credit on my account so now I had five sessions left (this is important).

The fifth time I went in must have been a bad day for someone because the girl that helped me had a serious attitude problem. So much so that when I came out I told her that I didn't appreciate the way she treated me (that's really unusual for me - I believe in politeness at all costs and had shown it consistently with a place that could NEVER get my account right and cost me time constantly). Anyway.

For my sixth visit I called first to verify the amount of tans I had and to make an appointment to go in. Someone named Barbie answer the phone and AGAIN went into the computer and couldn't find ANYTHING for me. She said I must have used all of my tans. I said even if that was the case I'd still have one extra left from the time when the spray machine didn't work. She said 'sorry, there's nothing here.' 

Okay, all patience has almost run out. I told her that I am positive that she is the person I spoke with who said all this was fixed. She then said to me (verbatim), well I don't know if you came in when I wasn't in...' I stopped her, laughing incredulously, and said 'did you just imply that I stole something?' She then said I was rude and slammed down the phone. REALLY? REALLY? 

So, after that display of complete unprofessionalism, I call back and speak with Karenna. She tells me she somehow heard the whole conversation and that I was the rude one (right, I accused you of stealing?). She then proceeded to tell me (after Barbie, in our initial conversation admitted knowing who I was) that I had never been a member there, had never tanned there and had never paid them any money. Stop, I know. I thought I was in the Twilight Zone, too!

So, how much further could I have gone with this? It wasn't like I could get into their computer and prove anything. They get to keep my money without giving me the services I paid for, and because they are the final word, I get screwed.

Whatever you do, don't tan here. They are unethical and management will TELL you that they're franchised and if you have a complaint it will just come back to him, implying nothing will be done to them. Yikes. BAD BUSINESS.

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW

Olive & Ivy is another one of Sam Fox's restaurant concepts, one which we like. http://www.foxrc.com/restaurants/olive-ivy-restaurant-marketplace/

We came here after a movie on the Fourth of July around four. It was mostly empty and we felt we had the run of the place just to ourselves.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
On most nights this is a crazy busy place with a bar area that can get crowded very quickly. Yet on other nights...  well it can be empty. It tends to be more young, after work-ish, along with the 40s/50s who live nearby. Yesterday, there was a dozen of us evenly split, outnumbering the staff. 

MENU:
You have two menus to choose from, Dinner and Happy Hour. Both are incredibly large and diverse for the 3 to 6 HH period. The major difference between the two is the lack of pastas, and that the salads can only be found on the Dinner menu. See link: http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Olive_And_Ivy_Happy_Hour_Menu.pdf

SERVICE:
It can be a little uneven, though we find it mostly amusing. We were seated this time in the dining room, near the bar. The wait staff is off doing various things and completely out of sight. A hard thing to do considering the vast open expanse of the restaurant. LOL

They tend to drop off a dish and then get lost; only returning to the area to see if you are done. No water glass refills, no inquires to see if you want another drink, etcetera. 

After dropping off their signature pesto and bread, we were told absent-mindedly, "oh, it's our basil parmesan something-or-other". Really. LOL

FOOD:
The food is very good, with interesting layers for the palate. On this visit we started with the Fresh Mozzarella (photo)-- which comes with a yummy tomato jam with basil on top for only $4.00. Delicious. Then we each ordered a salad (photos) -- the Mediterranean that has couscous while the Butter Lettuce comes a' la BLT with gorgonzola cheese. 

The Med was huge, and large enough for two. It was only ten dollars though we added a chicken breast for an extra four dollars. We were less impressed with the Butter, since it came with only three small Bib lettuce leaves. It was very tasty, though small compared to the Med.  The wine selection is fairly large and fairly priced. See the photo of their huge transparent "Feature Wall" of wine by the bar. 

PRICES:
You'll find some Old Town price creep with some items, but it's not too crazy. The above salads were in the $12 to $14 range which seem about right. 

The HH menu tends to be in the $6 to $8 range and is generous.  Our bill came in just over $40 and we had an email 25% off coupon. That is something we like about being on the Fox Concept email list. There's at least one coupon or promotion going a month. Nice!

Enjoy!

Cue Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue", because the curtain just went up yesterday on a new Five Star food experience!

For most Chicago food lovers, Portillo's holds a special place.  Yes, there are several hundred Italian Beef and Char Dog places up there.  But it was Dick Portillo and his family who first capitalized on turning Chicago comfort food into a culinary science.  Then they made it into a destination stop with all of the visual entertainment of their theme restaurants.  Very simply, the food was very good and it was a fun place to go.

This Portillo's is no different.  Here they have a 50s/60s Retro Theme.  As I waited in line last night, it was more like a carnival atmosphere.  Of the nearly four hundred ahead of me, there was ne're a raised voice or a sad face. Everyone was laughing and telling stories.  

As you entered the restaurant after forty-five minutes to an hour outside, and then realizing you had another forty-five minute wait inside -- you looked around and saw nothing but a sea of happy, satisfied customers chowing down on their favorite food.

I was ordering for three, since I had two hungry somebodies waiting at home for my food delivery service.  For myself, I ordered the Big Italian Beef wet ($5.95) with sweet and hot peppers giardinera ($0.90) and Mozzarella ($0.50) and a Jumbo Hot dog ($2.99) with everything on it.  Boy, did if goof.  The prices for the food are outrageously fair and reasonable.  Heck, I left thinking they got my order wrong with all the food they gave me. 

Their beef sandwich was nearly a foot long and I needed to cut it in half.  There was no way any human being could finish something this big and I didn't.  The amount of beef on half, was more than double what I have had in the past at any other restaurant! They could have easily sold my half sandwich for the $5.95 that I paid.  My jumbo dog was also very good, but I should have ordered it charred instead.  It was worth the wait, everything was delicious.

The other items on my family's order, were two Beef 'n Cheddar croissants for $5.25 each, another Jumbo Dog with an order of large Fries ($2.19) and onion rings ($2.09), along with four hot giardiners ($0.45) and one pop.  Our total came to $35.95, including taxes and could have easily fed four.  As I said, I goofed and over ordered by a mile!

Other items on the menu that we didn't try are: the 1/3 of pound Char Burgers for $3.95, or the double for $6.19. They also have a Halibut  or Tuna sandwich $5.19, and a Veggie Sandwich for $5.35. Portillo's is famous for their Garbage Salad which is $7.69.  They also have a Chicken Caesar for $6.59.  Their Shakes are $2.69/ $3.39 and Malts $2.79/ $3.59. For something completely different, they also have Tamales $1.89 and a Tamale in a Box for $2.99.

In Yelp-ese, a Four Star experience is "Yay! I'm a fan."  A Five Star is "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"  Before tonight, I would have said Portillo's was a Four Stars. But NOT after this evening.  To even the toughest critic or curmudgeon, they would have to admiit that this is as good as it gets!  Five Stars.

Enjoy!

After seeing so many of my friends check in to this place and proceeded to give it no less than 4 stars, I knew it had to be good. Just the pictures alone made my gut instinct (also known as my stomach growling and my mouth drooling) tell me it was gonna be good!

So I take my wife here to dinner on a late Friday afternoon around 5. We are greeted warmly and are seated immediately. Nice place. Very spacious. They even have a little stage for bands to perform I assume. Before we even see our server, there was already another guy putting down a basket of chips, salsa, and bean dip on our table. Talk about calming down a hungry customer! What an awesome feeling it is to chow down on some delicious chips and salsa while trying to decide what wonderful menu item(s) to order. Besides the chips and salsa, they also give you a cup of fideo soup before your entre comes out. 

So we go with Juan's Flaming Combo for 2. It's your choice of two meats (Chicken, Steak, or Pork. Shrimp is a dollar extra), grilled with onions, green and red peppers on a sizzling fajita skillet. We chose Steak and Shrimp. When they bring it out, not only is it sizzling, but they throw some alcohol on top of it (some kind of tequila I think) and ignite it with a lighter. Which at this point makes you understand why they call this place "Juan's Flaming Fajitas and Cantina". This dish comes with your choice of rice, beans, and pico de gallo or sour cream, guacamole, and sauted veggies. I went with the first choice while my wife went for the second so we can try all options. Turns out all items are very good. Of course to round it out you get either flour or corn tortillas because what is a fajita without the tortilla? It's like having a gun with no bullets or brushing your teeth with no toothpaste. It just wont work without it. 

As for the service, we didn't have to ask for anything. One thing that really stood out was that even though our server was doing an excellent job already, another server from another area saw me finish my water and as I was putting the empty glass at the edge of the table, she proceeded to fill it with fresh water. Wow! I like the fact that other servers are not just looking after their own area, but are more than willing to help out their fellow servers when it comes to simple things like refilling water glasses. Bravo to whoever does the customer service training at this place. Keep up the good work for im sure every customer will notice these things.

So any time I see or hear of anything fajita, I will automatically think of Juan's Flaming Fajitas! Im looking forward to bringing my friends and family here! Ole!

Spraggle!!!  You heard me right, the food at Echo & Rig is spraggle!  This is one of my favorite spots for the $$!  I have been here a few times now and each time I have been completely satisfied with the excellent quality they consistently put out and the reasonable price.  I'm not saying that it's my favorite steakhouse, but again, for the money, it is certainly one of the best around!

They are a butcher and a steakhouse.  This makes for a unique feel as you enter, but there's more... The steakhouse means that they have several regular cuts of meat on their menu all the time...the butcher part means that you can order from the shop to-go...but it also means that several additional cuts are available routinely that are not on the menu but sold per ounce.  Steaks are seasoned well and cooked beautifully.  I would not hesitate to order with confidence any cut that you fancy on or off the menu.

The real standouts for me are the small plates.  They have 30 different veggie and small plates that range from $5.50 - $9.30.  On this list you will find such taste-bud copulations as Grilled Octopus w/ Gigante Beans, Bone Marrow Carne Asada, Maryland Lump Crab Cakes, Asparagus & Fried Egg, and their now famous Portobello Fries w/ Aioli...start with these, then venture out to the Sweetbread Nuggets, Steak Tartare, Brussels Sprouts, and Mussels Mainiere...Looks like I need to try more of their veggies next time!

If you are here with a group of 6 - 8 you might want to see what Ribeye Tomahawks they have (or if you happen to eat on your own like a Thunder Cat.)  This cut receives nice flavor from the bone and marbling, and slices up nice to share.  All of their steaks come with the option of the following sauces: Blue Cheese, Red Wine Demi, Green Pepercorn, Bernaise, Charred Onion, Horseradish Cream, or Lemon Chimichurri...I'm a succker for the more traditional Bernaise.

E&R is a great place to take a date and share some of the small plates...or come with a group and order by the ounce!  Did I mention that they don't have a corkage fee here?...well they don't, so bring in your favorite bottle of vino.

They also have some incredible looking Happy Hour prices, but I have not sampled any of these options. I have however tried the wonderful boutique hand creams in the restrooms, and I'm a fan!...hey Echo, let's keep some hand towels in there though ...2 out 4 times you've been out...

Come here for remarkable food for the price point!
Come here with a group open to sharing and trying a lot of options!
Come here for fancy hand creams in the bath room!
Come here and close-the-place-down drinking wine at the bar while conversing with the most stunning woman you know!
Come here for a trendy date spot with a modern distressed interior!
Either way...you should come check it out!

This place is definitely my favorite Chinese Restaurant in Las Vegas. Hands down. Every time I have friends in town and they want to eat good off the strip Chinese food, this is place we go. Its open around lunch time and closes super late, 11am-3am. When I first walked into this place, I saw a good sign. Tons and tons of other Asian families eating here. The menu is pretty extensive and also has pictures for the newbies.

We ordered: Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Pan Fried Sea Bass, Roast Duck, Salt and Pepper Sea Bass, Spicy String Beans with Chicken, Garlic Ong Choy, and some Oyster Clay Pot.

Wow. I was definitely amazed by the taste and quality of the food. The Salt and Pepper Pork Chops are definitely different from the other restaurants. Instead of battering the pork and deep frying it, they do it in a way that the batter isn't fried in. Its like a separate layer above the meat so you can taste both parts when you bite into it. Its weird to explain but its good. So good, that we order it every time we go there. 

The Pan Fried Sea Bass is my absolute favorite. The lightly fried sea bass comes swimming in sweet soy sauce but it doesn't overpower the taste nor the light crisp. Definitely a must order.

The Roast Duck here is waaaaaay better than at Sam Woo BBQ. The dish here actually has large chunks of meat. It has a right combination of crispy skin and meaty meat. That's the way this dish should be served.

The Salt and Pepper Sea Bass was good but not a must have. The Spicy String Beans with Pork was good also.... But not a must have. I would probably order other dishes the next time I'm here.

The Oyster Clay Pot was surprisingly filled with..... Lots of oysters! It comes with roast port, fried tofu, and lots of oysters. Definitely a must have if you like this kind of dish.

Last but not least, the Garlic Ong Choy is one of my favorite veggie dishes. It was cooked perfectly. The leafy part was soft, yet not overcooked, and the stems were slightly crunchy in texture.

This place is great. I highly recommended it. Funny thing is when I ask my coworkers where they go to get good Chinese food, they always say Joyful House. I felt like I was the last one in on this wonderful secret. I've been back here at least 5 times since I first discovered it. Its that good.

As always, pictures are included! Yummy!

Oh no! I'm the worst kind of guest. I came, I ate, I drank and I failed to send a thank you card.  I joined a group of fellow Yelpers for a Wednesday Happy Hour. (Jeff E. is awesome at planning Yelp unofficial events.) We rolled our way out fatter and happier.

THE RUNDOWN
+ Has TV? Yes. That's a definite yes! You really can't find a bad seat facing the mega-televisions that border the top of the bar.
+ Huge front patio (perfect for people watching!)
+ The food is over the top generous in size, flavor and character. 
+ Build A Burger is bananas 
+ Wide selection of beers on draft
+ Great for groups

SPECIALS
+ Happy Hour (M-F, 3-7): $4 Local Pints $3 Domestics $4 Prem Wells $5 House Wine & some $5 appetizers
+ Mon: $10 Build Mac-n-Cheese (unlimited toppings!)
+ Tue: $20 House wine & hummus platter
+ Wed: $10 Build A Burger (unlimited toppings!)

THIS BURGER BUSINESS
I like a good challenge. When I heard I could pile on unlimited toppings the game was on. I triple confirmed the pricing on Wednesday is a flat $10 NO MATTER WHAT. Like a speed demon I selected a bun (pretzel!), a protein (angus beef) and a cheese (gruyere). My pencil hovered over veges. (Yes to jalapeos and caramelized onions. No one to kiss that night. Boo! Hiss!) 

I heard someone at my table order avocados on the side. "Ooo! Good idea. Check." While in that section I thought, "Hmmm...what about an egg? You've never had an egg on your burger. WHY NOT?" 

[Shrug]
People. I hadn't been to the gym in three months. What's little bit of caloric love?

At Step Six I tossed in lettuce, tomato and mayo. I circled back and opted for some regular onions. (Again, no prince that night. I like a bit of crunch to my burger.) I topped off my rare burger with a tangy chipotle sauce and a side of sweet potato tots. (Interestingly enough you can top your burger with Steakhouse Herb Butter. How curious!)

God bless our server that night. I have to poll my friends to see if anyone can remember who helped us. She was the Shizzle. Patient, on top of our beer orders like a ninja and sweet as pie. We must have asked one thousand questions.

FIRE FIRE FIRE
While eagerly awaiting my mountain of food Jeff ordered "The Hell Fire Chips". I scoffed when I heard they were hot. Potato chips, buffalo sauce and blue cheese.  

My tongue thanks beer for its many healing powers. Speaking of beer, Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers was serving a Black Butte Porter at the time. I really hope they still have it on tap!

Back to the flame. Ursula had ordered something called TOT CHOS. Think of nachos, layered with chili, sour cream, guac and roasted pepper cheese sauce. Got that? Except the base is on tater tots! Also FIRE. A half order can easily be shared.

When The Burger finally rolled out my eyes opened like saucers. Cutting it with a knife clearly wasn't going to help! It wasn't pretty eating, but, oh boy was it yummy!

There were left overs. Good place. Fun!

Oh! Oh! Oh!
I just heard. The restaurant is still offering the same Yelp check-in offer. $5 off your order! GET IT!

***Mon Ami Gabi is a very popular French brasserie though I found their brunch to be mediocre and disappointing; the restaurant has a great atmosphere and nice service though***

Mon Ami Gabi in Las Vegas' Paris has been around for a long time and it still seems to be as popular as ever.  If you have been to Las Vegas, you have likely walked past this French brasserie; it is the one with the big outdoor patio just outside the Paris hotel that looks like either a great spot or a very hot place to have brunch or lunch.  Mon Ami Gabi is from famous Chicago chef Jean Joho, who also runs Paris' fine dining restaurant The Eiffel Tower Restaurant and Chicago's Everest.

While I was not a fan of The Eiffel Tower Restaurant, I was looking forward to trying Mon Ami Gabi.  This French brasserie seemed like a good choice for a delicious but not too expensive brunch.  I really liked the look.  The outdoor patio can be nice during some parts of the year and the restaurant also has an indoor-outdoor dining area, which offers a good view and a lot of sunlight but still provides a French bistro-esque room with good tables and a comfortable temperature.

Mon Ami Gabi's brunch menu features a mix of breakfast and lunch dishes from Eggs Benedict and omelets to steak frites and sandwiches like the Croque Madame, which I ordered.  Unfortunately, it was not good.  The ham was too thickly cut and quite dry while the toasted bread was dry, hard and way too crunchy.  The cheese did not have that stretchy and melted quality that a good Croque Madame has.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mon-ami-gabi-las-vegas-2?select=RSpAHvSIkAL21g6FHhd-Mw#8hc0hKwEWBkyr-oSH8V1dA

The Croque Madame was topped, of course, with a fried egg.  Unfortunately, the fried egg was quite burnt around the edges.  The fries had a thin potato chip-like cut.  They were not super crispy, but I liked the soft insides contrasted against the crispy edges.  Unfortunately, the fries were quite salty.

For dessert, I had their profiteroles and this was a much better representation of a classic French dish.  The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.  The chocolate topping was not the traditional thin dark chocolate sauce.  Instead, it was a thick double fudge sauce. While I prefer the more traditional thin bittersweet chocolate sauce, the chocolate combined with the ice cream and pastry to make a satisfying dessert.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mon-ami-gabi-las-vegas-2?select=RSpAHvSIkAL21g6FHhd-Mw#3Vy7BG3KJjbNjcREFoUeJQ

Service was good.  My server was very pleasant, polite and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace.

Prices were not too bad for their breakfast and brunch options.  Some of their steak dishes seemed pricey, but they were similar to other Las Vegas restaurants though Las Vegas restaurants tend to be very overpriced.

Bouchon is Las Vegas' signature French brasserie, but I try to seek out other places.  Bouchon is perfectly fine, but it feels very similar to the Bouchons in Yountville and Beverly Hills (in terms of food, the Yountville location is easily the best of the bunch).  Mon Ami Gabi offers a more unique experience for people on the West Coast (Mon Ami Gabi has several locations in the middle of the country and the East Coast).

Unfortunately, the food at Mon Ami Gabi was simply not that good.  While I liked Mon Ami Gabi's service and atmosphere, Bouchon is a much better option if you desire a French brunch (or dinner); it would probably not cost you that much more either.  Comme Ca in The Cosmopolitan would probably also be a better option for French bistro fare than Mon Ami Gabi.

Like most Las Vegas hotels and casinos, Paris offers complimentary valet and self parking.

***Many Las Vegas restaurants let their quality standards slip once they have been around for a while and that is the case with Hubert Keller's Burger Bar; Burger Bar is still a decent value compared to the many overpriced high-end restaurants on The Strip, but there are several new gourmet burger spots in Vegas (like Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood) that are probably more exciting***

There are several reasons to visit Hubert Keller's Burger Bar.  It is from a celebrity chef (Hubert Keller), but it is a relatively inexpensive restaurant (at least compared to the many expensive celebrity chef backed fine dining restaurants on The Strip).  It also primarily features two items--burgers and milkshakes--that are very popular.  Finally, Hubert Keller was on Top Chef Masters and showcased this restaurant as well as his burger skills so many might be intrigued with this one if they saw that season of Top Chef Masters on the Food Network.

This Burger Bar (there is also one located in the Macy's in San Francisco) is housed in Mandalay Place--a mini-mall within Mandalay Bay that features a few retail and dining options.  It is a fairly small place and the menu showcases a build-your-own-burger concept where you pick your burger protein--several types of beef, lamb, buffalo, turkey, and veggie as well as chicken breast and salmon.  You then choose your desired bun as well as all kinds of toppings including raw vegetables, grilled vegetables, many types of cheese (standard stuff like American and cheddar but also brie and smoked Gouda), several sauces, additional proteins like bacon and prosciutto, and finally a few premium ingredients like seared foie gras and black truffle.  You can also order one of their signature chef's burger creations so you do not have to make any choices.

In addition to their burgers, Burger Bar also serves all kinds of fried food from French fries and onion rings to zucchini fries and mozzarella sticks.  Chicken wings and a few salads are available too.

I went the build-your-own-burger route and opted for their Prime ground beef and added bacon, smoked Gouda and spinach on a potato bun.  The burger was okay.  I thought the burger at the newer Gordon Ramsay BurGR was much better--the beef was much juicier there and it featured both a higher quality bun as well as higher quality toppings.  The burger at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar was okay, but only the really thick and meaty (crispy but also chewy) bacon stood out.  The bun felt very plain for a gourmet burger spot.

I also opted for one of their milkshakes.  They have all kinds of milkshakes from build-your-own-milkshakes with many toppings to signature creations.  I tried their caramel latte, which featured coffee ice cream, caramel syrup, graham crackers, and butterscotch morsels.  It was a great mix of caramel and coffee and the milkshake had a great thick and creamy consistency (very addictive and hard to put down).

Service was good--pleasant and quick.

Prices are reasonable for a notable Las Vegas restaurant.  Burger Bar's prices are higher than similar gourmet burger restaurants in other big cities like Los Angeles, but that is to be expected given that Burger Bar is on The Strip.  Burger Bar does offer a decent meal that comes at a much lower price than the many celebrity chef backed (and very pricey) fine dining restaurants on The Strip.

I remember liking Burger Bar more on my first trip.  It is not too surprising that the quality has dropped since then; the quality standards at many Vegas restaurants seem to slip if it has been around for a long time.  Hubert Keller's Burger Bar is still a decent spot, but Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood is a much better option for an gourmet burger on The Strip.

Burger Bar is located in Mandalay Place, which is attached to Mandalay Bay.  Like other major casinos and hotels on The Strip, Mandalay Bay offers both complimentary self and valet parking.

An award winning dining experience that will leave you sated and infinitely satisfied!

As soon as we stepped inside the restaurant, we were immediately greeted by the restaurant manager who proceeded to lead us to our seats by the window. 
Located inside the newly erected Augustus tower of Caesar's Palace, the restaurant embraced a contemporary elegance that was refined yet simple and unfussy.  With warm tones from the rich wood panels, ceilings that soared high up, and large glass paneled windows with a peek a boo view of the Bellagio fountains, the ambiance was nothing less than magnificent!
  
The sommelier was helpful and knowledgeable as he started us with some bubbly and as soon as I saw a bottle of vintage Krug, I knew I was in for a treat!

The server was equally friendly and suggested The Chef's Signature Tasting Menu, which showcased the restaurant's acclaimed dishes.  Frankly, It goes without saying I went with the chef's signature tasting menu.  When in Rome, right folks?

Amuse Bouches

Foie gras with black truffle
Crisp toastettes pierced together with creamy smooth foie gras and irresistible black truffle was a decadent play of flavors and textures in the mouth. 

Parmesan waffle
Light fragrant and perfectly crisp and a delightful start to a sumptuous meal.

Cold zuchini soup with diced Radish & celery seed powder - very refreshing with a pleasant bite from the diced radishes

Fingerling potatoes with cream cheese and ham and topped with watercress. A charming little surprise that came with the cold zucchini soup.  This accompaniment rounded out our amuse plates wonderfully but something was telling me it probably wasn't the last surprise of the evening!

First Course

Heirloom tomatoes wedges with watermelon and tomato gelee - refreshing and vibrant! the addition of the frozen tomato added just enough saltiness to the sweet heirloom tomatoes and the addition of the crisp basil was surprisingly delightful!

Surprise #2 A tomato tartar topped with a pomegranate gelee and  basil drops was lightly flavorful and beautifully plated.

2nd dish

Colors of caviar - elegant and perfectly composed with layers of complex flavors and rich textures that paired beautifully with the champagne and meant to be savored slowly

3rd dish

Fish with ratatouille - Perfectly cooked, and the fish was imported from the southeast of France...Si Bon! Presented with its natural jus foam, the flesh was supple and soft to the touch with my fork. The ratatouille added the perfect amount of rustic flavor to this light yet incredibly flavorful fish

4th dish
Foie Gras - Considering its recent ban in California, I have found my new mecca for foie gras...Vegas baby! Served with a side of duck jus in a shot glass steeped in chopped fresh beets, green tea with crispy rice, the foie gras was absolute perfection. It was decadently rich and the orange zest cleansed the palate perfectly! Without a doubt, one of my favorite dishes of the evening!

5th
Black Truffle Soup - served with a warm buttery brioche that tasted like a flaky pastry. We were encouraged to dip the brioche into the velvety smooth soup. Infused with an incredibly rich depth of flavor imparted from the black truffle shavings and Parmesan flakes, this well composed soup was absolutely sublime and left my taste buds dancing long after i finished it!

6th dish
Filet mignon tenderloin with bone marrow was simply exquisite. The filet was insanely tender and very flavorful. The bone marrow that topped the filet was buttery soft and paired nicely with the filet. The shoulder cut of beef wrapped in delicate ribbons of carrot exhibited a briny flavor that added an earthy element to the dish, as well.

Desserts

Dessert Amuse Bouche - Apricot sorbet and with diced apricot. Tart, refreshing, and an excellent palate cleanser

Coconut 6 ways - An splendid little dessert with an interesting mix of textures that made it a sheer joy to eat!

Chocolate ganache with praline cream. Divine & a chocolate lover's dream come true!

Everything ended with a citrusy sorbet with creme fraiche as a final palate cleanser...

But our sweet journey didn't end there!  A large dessert cart was then rolled out for us to choose to our heart's content. We went with a variety of the server's tempting suggestions and then came the cheese cart! Seriously, the dinner lasted over 3 hours, but i hardly felt the time pass because i was enjoying myself so much!

At the end of the meal, we were greeted by the chef and left with complementary muffins to enjoy the following morning.

In short, the wait staff was kind courteous and very informative. Food was brought out at a very good pace and we never felt rushed or felt like we waited forever between dishes.

I would highly recommend Guy Savoy for any special occasion. It will leave you with an unforgettable experience that you will cherish for years to come.

Happy Eats!

I'm the first real person to review this place, let all other fake spammers be gone!  Yelp should really work that shizzle out.  Zack S...um this place closes at 11 so you couldn't have possibly hit the bar...so yeah if your gonna post fake reviews at least check your facts..

This place has so much potential, yet the ridiculously bad service just overshadowed everything good they did.

This is probably the worst service I have ever received in my life.  

Do you guys remember in Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts goes into the first store on Rodeo and the snooty lady acts like she's too good for this place?  Well that's what they did to us.

Where's the hostess?  Oh she's chatting with her friend...*ignoring me*

We finally get seated and then we sit and wait...

and wait...

and wait...

finally I get up and ask one of the waiters at the cash register to send over someone...

She treats us like we're a nuisance to her, she's singing along to the song that's playing...(WTF?)  I think they turned up the music louder as more people left because by the time it was near closing time it was blaring hip hop music...really weird considering it was a nice casual Italian restaurant.

We order almost 200 bucks worth of food, and then she's like "is that it?"

excuse me bitch...watch the attitude...

Wait, wait, watch as all the waiters get together to talk about us...seriously I can see you whispering about us....this is so unprofessional right now....

We seriously waited for like an hour and a half, it was ridiculous!  The place was practically empty!  The waiters were standing around and chatting with each other.  I took pictures as evidence!

This place is supposed to be a nice place, for the prices they charge they should have a whole restaurant re-staffed because it was ridiculous!  I have never felt more uncomfortable and treated so rudely in my life!

I also wanted to order take out for later and apparently they don't have take out boxes?  You're a restaurant?  You don't have boxes?  Seriously?

This is the worst experience in a restaurant I have ever had.  I've gotten better service at Carls Jr in a shady neighborhood than this.  

I won't hesitate to tell everyone to avoid this restaurant when you're in Vegas because this was outrageous!  No one treats me like that and gets away with it!  I wish I had a You've been yelped card so I could give them a piece of my mind.

I'm like those crazy housewives who have nothing better to do...I won't stop calling to speak to management until someone is fired.  I'm serious, no one gets away with treating me like that without suffering repercussions.  We don't play that, I'm sorry I'm not one of those quiet asian people who take your shit...I will not be silenced... You best believe.  You're done..The end.


*note I left for the manager*

"This is probably the most unprofessional and ridiculous restaurant I have ever had the misfortune to experience, not just from the our waitress, but the waitstaff and blatant ignorance from most of the employees I had to encounter."
                                                                   Anthony Nguyen

I hate to be an asshole, but I hated this place. 

I came here yesterday with a group of friends for lunch. Our 15 minute wait turned into what felt like an hour, when impatient me finally went in to see what the deal was... To my surprise, there was an empty table for a party of 7 that was just sitting there. Are you kidding me? So I ask one of the servers if its cool that we snag it, to which he said Yes. Just cram in tight. NO big deal. So I go and grab my friends to alert them that the table was ready, and when I walk back in, some stupid little bitchy server is standing there glaring at me telling me she "needs a minute to move the table" while huffing and puffing and sighing and just generally being a little queen about having to move a freakin table. I'm sorry, isn't it your JOB to accommodate patrons? I thanked her as she stormed off, and say something shitty to her about being such an inconvenience. I never saw her again throughout the duration of my visit. 

Star removal #1.

We all sit down, and continue waiting for our drink order to be placed. Finally, after about 10 minutes, this happens, but were without menus, so no one *really* knows what they want, Waitress huffs, rolls her eyes, and goes to grab menus. We look, she takes our order, but only for about 6 of the 8 people at the table. She somehow forgot about the tallest man at the table and the girl sitting across from him. Once she comes back, after 3 attempts, she gets the order wrong, serves me my sake without a cup or a glass for my beer. Seriously?

Star removal #2.

We finally order. Mind you, this was the longest lunch in the universe, because at this point we had already been there for an hour. Luckily our waitress got the order correct, except a few of us ended up waiting at least 45 minutes for our rolls to come out.. specifically the Avocado rolls.. did you run to California to grow and pick them yourself because.. wow. 

Star removal #3.

They managed to Eff up the most important part, which was the SUSHI. My unagi was not fresh, the spicy tuna tasted like plastic, they only had smoked salmon, no raw. They waitress *highly* recommended the dessert roll, which was ice cream rolled in rice krispys.. I know that sounds awesome and all, but im here for sushi, not ice cream. Also, on the menus, it says they have the choice to put a grat on ANY size party.. this to me is absolutely absurd.

Star Removal #4

I'm sorry, but when you see a PARTY OF EIGHT slide in, you do everything in your power to make these people happy, because if you don't, you can expect that "We can grat anyone we want" to be the only grat you get. Nothing additonal.

Get your shit together Moto, and maybe remind your waitstaff that their JOB is to make sure your patrons enjoy themselves, not make us feel like a burden. If it weren't for them, this review wouldn't have been so shitty.

P.S. Start to finish, lunch took 2.5 hours. 

FAIL.

What a shame as my first review was a well deserved 5 Star rating!

Oh Sammy baby...what has happened to you?

I had been bragging to my boyfriend who is a big fan of anything Pastrami so we finally had the time to stop by and get our grub on...eh hem I mean attempt to.

We walk up and place our order for two LA style pastrami sandwiches, order of garlic fries and a large soda. He says $30 dollars as I am handing him my two for one coupon he says "ugh" then says OK $20 dollars. Yes I shit you not he actually groaned "UGH" after presenting him with their coupon.

Anyhow, I have a bad feeling from the start. This guy is sweating buckets, he is blinded by the sweat in his eyes that he drops our cup on the dirty ground and picks it up and fills it. Wow! He hands us our drink and says 20 minutes. 

He did not bother washing his hands after just handling our money as he begins throwing stuff on the grill for the order that is before ours.This guy clearly did not want to be here working that is for sure!

We go and stand on the side of the building where the door to the kitchen is open, bad mistake as my bf started to add up all of the health violations. 

I was embarrassed as my experience picking up food here previously was a world of difference. Where was the mature sweet couple who was smiles behind the counter at? The people that were so full of life and excited to explain and suggest menu items? They are a thing of the past I suppose? :(

I swear we waited 10 minutes and still our order had not been started and at that point all I could think of was how bad this guy needs a shower and how I will throw up if I see him touch my food with his bare hands after seeing him break health code upon health code violation.

The kitchen was disgusting and not once did we see this guy wash his hands. His behavior was odd as well, he clearly was angered at having to work it seemed as he was slamming stuff around in the kitchen. 

We waited...waited...waited....and then I was to the point of just flat out disgusted so I walked right up to him and said I would like my money back as we have decided not to dine here. He said "how much you give me"? I replied 20.00 he reached into his pocket and gave me 20.00 and that was that nothing else said. He actually seemed happy that he did not have to bother with making our order.

The end...

What a disappointment, not sure if they sold the business or what however I can tell you this is the beginning of the end for them if this keeps up!

I will never be back in fact you could not pay me to come back to this hot mess of a once great operation!!!


So sad...

A 5-star rated restaurant on Yelp is very hard to come by but leave it to the tourists, or wait, better yet, the locals, to lead you in the right direction when it comes to good food in Vegas. 

Owned by Chef John Lee with his wife who also runs the dining area of the restaurant, the place seems to have something note-worthy going on. The quality of the ingredients they use are phenomenal, not to mention the exceptional freshness and grade of their fish. Like many, I value service that's genuine and efficient as well as a price tag that doesn't hurt your wallet as much. This place has it all.

ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA ($9) started off our meal with 3 dipping sauces that accompanied it: wasabi aioli, sweet banana sesame, and garlic ponzu. If there was one dip we fought over who gets to lick the last bit of it, that'll be the sweet banana sesame. 

SNAPPER w/ UNI ($13) initiated our cold sashimi orders. The presentation was so beautiful that all we wanted to do was stare at it. The inevitable was bound to happen and gladly we savored each bite appreciating how the uni did not overpower the snapper. Delicious!

SALMON WASABI CREME ($11) was highly recommended by our server and we took heed since we are big salmon fans. Clean flavors with a climax on the wasabi creme that sang melodiously altogether, this was easily my favorite out of all the sashimi dishes.

YELLOWTAIL YUZU SOY ($12) was served with "compliments of the chef" says our dear server. It was after all one of his most popular dishes and I completely understand why. The tempura serrano, cilantro, garlic oil, ponzu, and garlic dust all worked harmoniously for the benefit of the fish. 

BIG EYE TUNA POKI ($15) which was a special of the evening had a lusciously melt-in-your-mouth texture that only proves how fresh the tuna is. A much bigger portion compared to the sashimi dishes was a plus.

MISO MARINATED BLACK COD ($18) was cooked to perfection and was probably the best thing I ate here. So much for sharing but I'm getting an entree all to myself next time. Buttery yet flaky, black cod to me is the version of a grade-A Wagyu steak in fish.

TUNA TADA ($2) would be poki tuna on a tostada shell topped with avocado and cilantro. The contrasting textures of the crunchy shell to the tenderness of the fish and creaminess of the avocado was superb. For $2 each, can I have one more please? 

SOFT SHELL CRAB ROLL ($9) seemed to be popular but this did not wow me in presentation, however, looks can be deceiving and I'll say it was very good. My daughter will vouch for it, too but I'm sure the spicy version of this is much better.

FIRE CRACKER ROLL ($9) was my least favorite as it had cream cheese in it. Not their fault, just my preference. This had spicy tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, sweet onion, then deep fried. Everyone else enjoyed it.   

TWIN DRAGON ROLL ($15) won me over despite how stuffed I already was at this point. All the dishes we shared between 4 people but we all can't deny this roll was truly something with Alaskan King crab, spicy tuna, avocado, and tempura shrimp. Without a doubt this was the best out of the three rolls we had.

MATCHA TIRAMISU ($7) ended our meal with a sweet note. Green tea soaked sponge cake and matcha sabayon topped with whipped cream were all there was to it but let your imagination run wild as to how heavenly scrumptious this really was. 

Leaving us with a lasting impression, this entire meal kicked-off our weekend in Vegas with a bang!

We came in during the first few days after they opened, so the staff was still working out some of the kinks. I won't fault them for that. They were all extremely friendly and helpful and there is always a bit of a learning curve for a new spot.

Despite the fact that the entire staff was still in the training stages, the food came out tasting great. Chef Marc was there helping the staff out and giving them pointers as they prepared our food and chatted us up while we waited. You really see how passionate he is for his business, which was important. 

Everyone in our party ordered the one topping pizza, salad and drink combo. My fella and I decided to share since we wanted to try out the dessert pizza. We opted for the spicy sauce and supprassota on top. It had a nice spicy kick and the crust was perfection. Even better than the one I had at their other location on Eastern. The salad was great as well. We opted for the Caesar and it had a nice subtle flavor and wasn't overly sauced, which I enjoyed. We ordered everything together and they offered to make our dessert pizza a little later so we could enjoy it when we were ready, so it was as fresh and warm as possible. The flavors were great and I really enjoyed this little treat. Not overly sweet and had a nice savory aspect that helped even out the powdered sugar and fruit topping. 

As much as I liked it, I would probably stick to their savory items next time since they offer Art of Flavors gelato as well and it's very hard to me to resist that when it's available.

I'm very excited by the newest addition to this complex and I see myself coming pretty often to indulge my pizza and gelato cravings.

From the first bite I took of their Chinese style baked goods I knew I'd return despite having to walk several miles to and from my hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.  In the world of Chinese bakeries I think Diamond Bakery is pretty darn good and very much comparable to one of my San Francisco Bay Area favorites Sheng Kee Bakery.

Surprisingly I had very little soreness from running in the Rock n Roll Las Vegas 1/2 Marathon just about a dozen hours earlier on Sunday night, and since I considered this a vacation I definitely wasn't about to sit around in or near my hotel like a couple of my friends decided to do.  A long, leisurely walk was in order so I chose Chinatown having never really explored the area before.

After an exploratory visit inside a Ranch 99 Asian supermarket yielded zero results as far as finding something to snack on I came upon the Diamond Bakery and a nice 4 star rating on Yelp.  Yelp friend Matt G and the Las Vegas Yelpers' rating did not disappoint as I gathered an arm full of individually wrapped pastries to take with me on my walking journey.  Everything I tried during my walk I liked from the Baked BBQ Pork Buns to the Chinese Rice Tamales to the Pineapple Buns, and by the time I returned to my room I still had food left over.

I whipped out my camera and captured what I had later in the day.

Japanese Style Hot Dog Bun (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IcOvxejpd5FLFIkj20Opqg?select=Mw5zFwaUWjAwE04lrwRTMA) - I feared this would be a bit salty, but it wasn't at all.  I would easily buy this one again.  It's braided bread dough that forms the bun and houses a quarter inch slice of hot dog inside each braid.  Topped with a crispy layer of cheese my only wish was having some yellow mustard to smear on it.

Red Bean Bun (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IcOvxejpd5FLFIkj20Opqg?select=lQxtG3VxFBndCvv-yVGY7w) - Stuffed to the gills with lumpy red bean paste this was easily one of the best red bean buns I've ever had.  In terms of volume I'm definitely certain there was more red bean than there was bun in this pastry.  Make sure you pop a Beano or two before devouring this one!

Winter Melon Cake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IcOvxejpd5FLFIkj20Opqg?select=3gP1L6c1YWXWtGKTbk3cqw) - The super flaky pastry was very good and the winter melon filling was chewy but rather sweet.  The amount of filling was also quite generous.  I did detect a bit of coconut mixed in with bits of crunchy melon in the filling and that kind of made it a miss for me not really being a fan of coconut.  This was probably the one thing I would not buy again, but 1 out of 6 ain't bad at all.

Alright Pittsburgh, another new, great restaurant for our fair city. Dined here twice so far so I think I can write a fair and informed review and I expect I will be here many more times to come. Eddie Merlot's is a, very good and lovely to look at, Steakhouse and more.
High on looks, high on service, high on price, high on the palate. Worth it all, when you want to splurge.

So far I have had the pleasure to enjoy the 22 oz Prime Bone-in Ribeye Steak and the 18oz Prime Dry-aged New York Strip Steak. Both steaks were delicious and very highly representative of the best of their cuts. Perfectly cooked to medium rare and with such moistness and flavor. Have had the East coast and West Coast Oysters on the half. They were very fresh, flavorful and nicely presented. A word to the shucker, only one issues was a little too much chipped shell included done at shucking time.
 
Starting also with soup and salad, I tried the Merlot's wedge and then the Chopped Salad. Both were outstanding, but watch for the Chopped Salad containing: Crisp lettuce, Gruyre cheese, red onion, celery, tomatoes, artichoke hearts, crispy prosciutto, and seasoned almonds, with creamy herb dressing, to be very large and filling. A companion liked the French Onion soup enough to order it on two visits.
All the sides we tried were pretty good, mostly everything is a la carte so you pick em as you like and have room for. One surprise though and an outstanding one at that, was not listed on the menu but my Strip came with fries. I am not sure how they cooked them but these fries were really good I have to say. 

Service is courteous, efficient and informed. For only being in operation a month or two now, I see no real bugs in the orchestration of the complexity that is high end service. 

The hosts station was very efficient and we were seated within minutes of our reservations. I really like that efficiency and management skill in a top restaurant because that is part of what you are paying for and you get it here.
There is paid Valet parking out on the Liberty St. side and complimentary, validated  parking in the underground garage. 

There is a great looking bar area/section where folks are drinking, mingling and eating. I have not tried that side but it certainly looks inviting and beautiful.

As I said at the start, alright Pittsburgh, we have another great new restaurant in our great city. Thanks Eddie Merlot for coming our way.

We were fortunate enough to have lunch here today - on their soft opening day.

This is a rare opportunity in Vegas to enjoy plates prepared by a Michelin starred chef himself, not just by a name on its signage.

Eventually this place will be a kaiseki restaurant - a traditional multi-course Japanese dinner - of only 12 seats, but due to limitated availability of uncommon ingredients required for kaiseki, liquor license, etc. they will only offer Japanese comfort food lunch in the coming months.

It was a three-course lunch for $20:

- First course: Triple layered vegetable soup served chilled - Seven vegetables in the first layer, soy sauce based brown gele in the second layer, avocado and egg white with Japanese sake in the third layer
- Second course: Petite Assorted Appetizer - Flavored edamame, marinated cucumber with sweetened miso, yuzu flavored shrimp, soy flavored Japanese taro potato, deep fried lotus roots
- Main course (choose one from three): a) Chicken Rice Omelette - egg omelette over white steamed rice sauted with ketchup, onion, green peppers, chicken, bacon and mushroom. b) Tonkotsu Ramen Noodle Soup Wok Charred - pork based ramen. c) Black Curry over Steamed Rice - traditional Japanese style curry over white steamed rice.

The first cource - the three layered soup was amazing. Very complex tastes mingled on my tongue, the potato-ish veggie flavor on the top followed by the sweet gele, deepened with the avocado. All completely grated, but I was still able to tell the texture, scoop and taste individually or all at once.

There came the second, more traditional kaiseki-like appetizer. This time, we could see the basic attributes of natural ingredients were preserved, yet amusing presentation of craftsmanship was well displayed. The finish of shrimp was like what we eat for Osechi that would bring back old timey memories. Satoimo (Japanese taro) came with tangy rock salt. Cucumber came hocho-crafted with mildly sweet moromi-miso. Deep fried lotus roots had perfect crunchiness that played nice in the mix. However, the edamame was lacking the finishing touch. Not only that the flavor was nothing special, it felt awkward to pull out beans from the pod by hand.

We chose Omurice (Rice Omelette) and Tonkotsu Ramen for the main.

As much as I would like to say the Omurice was perfect, it was also pretty basic to be honest. Considering that Omurice has been less accepted in the US market, I can understand that the straightforward path is a safe bet, but for matured taste buds like ours, some you-cannot-do-it-at-home factors seemed to be missing. My personal preference is rice less steamed and eggs more runny. Also I personally like demi-glace sauce better, or at least the ketchup could use some twist.

Now the best part- the tonkotsu ramen! I was blown away. I know it's like cheating to compare ramen elaborated by a kaiseki chef with shops serving bowls in every 60 seconds, it was the best ramen I've had in this competitive Las Vegas market. The broth had very intricate flavors, but was not too greasy or heavy. Quite contrary, the aftertaste was pleasantly light. Chashu was a little sweetened, which added a unique perspective. Typically noodles are straight and thin for tonkotsu, but wavy noodles used by Omae worked to fully enjoy this rich-yet-not-too-rich broth.

In the end, all those three (plus drink) for $20 was a well considered price point. It's on a high-end for lunch, particularly for local clientele, but is a steal for the quality of food and service.

Some obvious opening day flaws aside, this place is very promising. I spotted some misses in the food as described above, but I will hold off my full review until they start offering kaiseki, a big missing piece in the Las Vegas culinary scene.

4 stars + 1 for a forward looking factor.

Best of 2008: Best Place to Make Yourself at Home 
Best of 2007: Best Downtown Lunch 
Best of 2006: Best Gourmet Pizza 
Best of 2005: Best Gourmet Pizza 

These are just some of the awards that Cibo has won.
Well, this year, Cibo is being awarded its most prestigious award to date. 
And that is the Craig R's Favorite Dinner While Visiting Arizona Award 

Cibo, which is located in a residential neighborhood in Phoenix, is actually an old restored 1913 bungalow. The inside of Cibo has hardwood floors, beautiful stained glass paneling, an all wood bar and a fireplace. Since it was such a warm, beautiful Phoenix evening, my fianc and I decided to dine in the front yard of Cibo, which is covered with tables, Christmas lights and a fire pit. Cibo also has local Jazz bands come in and play live music in the front yard, which gives Cibo a super relaxing and romantic vibe. In fact, this was one of the most romantic evenings my fianc and I have shared in a long time. 

To start out the night we shared their famous Burrata appetizer, which tends to sell out every night. The Burrata consisted of fresh mozzarella topped with a balsamic glaze, black label prosciutto crudo and toasted bread. This app was extremely flavorful and fun to eat. I can see why it sells out almost every night. The mozzarella was really creamy and had an awesome sweet and tangy flavor because of the balsamic glaze. When you combine all the elements of this dish together you get this awesome little sandwich that is sweet, tangy and salty all at the same time.  

Cibo is known for their homemade wood fire pizza's that they prepare with only locally grown organic produce and imported Italian products. Every pizza on their menu sounded amazing so my fianc and I each ordered a different one so we could share them. These are the pizza's we got: 

Diavola- Tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy salami, and Italian sausage 
Tartufata- Mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and truffle oil. I also added Italian sausage and ricotta cheese.  

Both of these pizzas were phenomenal. They were both huge and cooked perfectly so the crust was thin and crispy, with slightly burnt edges. The spicy salami on the Diavola was actually really, really spicy. The tomato sauce on this pie was extremely flavorful too. The Tartufata  was really cheesy since it contained both mozzarella and ricotta cheese. The truffle oil and the white mushrooms that were on this pizza gave it such an amazing taste. 

The service at Cibo was top notch. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive. Since we had never been there before she was very helpful in explaining their menu and giving us suggestions on what we should try and what some of their most popular dishes are. She also always made sure our drinks were always full and that we had everything we needed. 
The prices at Cibo were good too. Their pizzas range anywhere from $12 to $15 dollars a piece, which is great considering how big and delicious they were. 

Whether you live in Phoenix or just visiting like I was, if you're looking for a romantic place to take you significant other then look no further than Cibo.

My new favorite place for Mexican food! When I heard there was a new Mexican restaurant serving a taco with a fried avocado on it, I knew I had to give it a try! When hubby and I walked in we were greeted by a woman who took us to a booth and took our drink order. When you walk inside there is a decent size cantina on the right and the dining area on the left. I noticed the dining area half full of customers so I took this as a good sign. The chips, salsa and bean dip brought to the table were delicious. The salsa could have been a bit more chunkier for me, but it tasted very fresh and good. 

I ordered "Tacos Del Campo" priced at just $8. This was 2 tacos with beer battered fried avocado, jicama slaw and pico de gallo in them. It was just so yummy! This wasn't like any dish I have tasted before and I will be ordering it again for sure. It also came with rice and beans. I'm pretty picky about rice at Mexican restaurants and really liked it here. The rice was moist and had great flavor as the beans. All this fresh tasty food for only $8 is a great deal. Hubby ordered the "Casero Burrito" priced at $13 and had some issues with the order accuracy of his food, but enjoyed it and really liked the tomatillo salsa that came on it. His food also came with a side of guacamole and since he is weird and doesn't like 'cados, I scooped it right up! That guac was definitely fresh made and freaking tasty! Our server was great and checked on us for refills regularly. 

Jalisco Cantina has a few different options as far as catering. They can host up to 100 people at the restaurant with live music and either a sit down dinner or buffet style dinner. They had other options too, but I can't remember them all so you can call for more info.

Currently they are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

If it weren't for the ice-cold A/C, this place would definitely get 5 stars!
I just got home from dinner with my brother-in-law, who's in town for a conference.  He said "pick a nice place" and, of course, I chose Durant's!
Valet parking.  Cute as a button, and I gave him the "I wanna put you in my pocket" line.  
See, my sister and her family live in the OC.  Not much for flavor there.  When we walked in through the kitchen, the first thing the bro-in-law said was "Awesome!  Just like old Queens mobsters, walking in through the kitchen!"
We were early for our reservation, but it didn't look like we needed it for a Monday night (come on, it's football season!) so we were promptly seated.
Decor reminds me of my Hungarian/Polish grandparent's house.  Red velvet wallpaper and dark red leather booths.  Really plush and the booths could sit 4 comfortably.  There were some hotties in there, so I made sure to sit across from the bro-in-law!  
One of the thing you KNOW means class is them giving out BLACK linen napkins if you're wearing black.  Nothing ruins a good night out more than white lint on your lap.
The bread came and it was doused in an olive oil-basil-onion concoction.  I only had a little piece, but it was awesome!  It was already pre-cut, too.  Convenient!
The BIL (keep up, that's brother-in-law and I'm gonna type it a bunch of times and that's just ridiculous) had to order the fried calamari, his staple.  Breading was light, but a bit too salty.
The soup special was an onion-cheese and really rich and creamy.  I had the 8oz filet with a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  BIL got the scallops, which had pieces of bacon around the edges.  Both dishes were perfect.  My steak was done just right - medium rare.  
We shared dessert.  Strawberry shortcake.  For 2.  We couldn't even finish it.  Topped with homemade whipped cream.
The best touch, though, was the ambience.  Oh, and members of "the Family" at the table right next to us.  Ah, to hear that Queens accent again!  
Definitely my top high-end restaurant in the Valley now!  I'll be back!  Not with the BIL, though.  I'll bring one of my boys.

***Jose Andres' China Poblano in the Cosmopolitan Hotel scores a mediocre score of 3 stars on Yelp, but I found all of the food (I had two of their savory courses and 1 dessert) to be good to very good***

China Poblano features a mix of contemporary Mexican and Chinese dishes.  Some dishes are gussied up with contemporary cooking techniques or high end ingredients while other dishes veer more on the fusion side.  

I started with one of their tacos--a carnitas one topped with guacamole, fresh lime and chicarrones.  I thought the fillings were great.  The carnitas was moist and tender.  It was also nicely seasoned.  It had a good flavor and wasn't too salty (which happens a lot with carnitas).  The guacamole was cool and refreshing and it was a great contrast to the warm and savory carnitas.

The chicarrones were crispy and light.  The soft corn tortilla was fine, but it wasn't a good vessel for the meat juices.  The only problem with the taco was that it was too wet.

I also has the twenty vegetable fried rice and it was very good.  The rice had a nice soy flavor, but it was not too salty.  The vegetables provided great contrasts in textures, but with that many vegetables, which were cut up into small pieces as well as paired with a flavorful rice, the individual flavors of the vegetables were (as expected) kind of lost.

Still, there were a lot of vegetables including fresh greens, crispy sweet potato, haricot verts, squash, turnips, carrots, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, and watermelon radish.  There were also proteins like soft tofu and scambled egg.

For dessert, I opted for their flan and it was very good.  The flan was incredibly smooth, creamy and light like a panna cotta.  It was topped with a great cajeta gelee (rich caramel flavor).  There was also cajeta ice cream (incredibly dense and a great rich caramel flavor).  The plate was garnished with good pineapple, which was not too tart.

Service by the bartender Victor was excellent; he was incredibly personal and helpful with the menu.  You could tell he really wanted all of his customers to have the best experience possible.

Prices are not too bad considering that it was Vegas.  The fried rice dish was under $20 and it was a very generous portion.  Some portion sizes seem small in a few dishes when considering the prices (like the tacos), but it is still a better value than the many overpriced Vegas restaurants serving just so-so food.

In terms of the decor at China Poblano, the bar gives you a view of the chefs making the dim sum.  There is a main dining room, but I wasn't a fan of the tables (they kind of looked like what you would find at a gourmet order-at-the-counter spot).  Overall, the decor was forgettable and not that great.

I thought the food at China Poblano was good.  The food was pricey, but Vegas food tends to be pricey and there are places in Vegas serving much more expensive food that is not nearly as tasty or refined as what you can get at China Poblano.  I think China Poblano is a good spot for an upscale lunch.  And since the same menu (with the same prices) is featured at dinner, it is a good spot for a nice dinner with a more casual approach and more reasonable prices than the many overpriced high-end dinner places in Las Vegas.

I believe the Cosmopolitan offers both complimentary valet and self parking.

This is one of those hidden gem in the strip.  Located in the Stratosphere Towel Hotel and Casino, which is in the north edge of the strip. Getting to this lounge is not easy unless you ask around.  The lounge is located at top of the top of the world restaurant, which is in the 108 floor; this lounge is in 109 floor. The first thing you notice of this lounge is the spectacular view of the Las Vegas.  The entire city of Las Vegas can be view from all 360" angle.  This floor does not rotated like fancy restaurant below.  So the strip and other good view is often been hawk by other customer very quickly.

Early Happy Hour
Half Price Appetizers: 4pm - 7pm
2-for-1 Cocktails: 4pm - 7pm
Late Happy Hour
Half Price Appetizers: 10:30pm - 1am
2-for-1 Cocktails: 1am - 4am

They got happy hour daily, sadly to say their food is bad in this time type of atmosphere.  They said the food comes from the restaurant below, but is hard to believe since the quality is just way off.  It could be we got the wrong chef that night, but several review did point that their food were not good.  I have not try their cocktail, it should be better than the food quality I assume.  We try the Kurobuta Pork Belly, which was super fatty and didn't got the right flavor, it tasted more like left over from lunch.  The Waygu Beef Tenderloin Carppacio was also not fresh and disappoint, The Shrimp Cocktail & Lobster Mango Ceviche was not bad but too small portion.  The best one was the Cheese Plate.

The seat is comfortable but the tablet is very small, this is not idea for big group.  However, is perfect for couple, kids do not allow here. Our ID's were check despite we did not even drink.  The bathroom sink have a mini television, but the lounge there were none.  The real bonus here is that you get to access to the observation desk, I believe this is not the same as those who paid but still provided very nice view.  Definite bring you camera when you get here and enjoy.  Just aware the food is not great, a least in our experience in their happy hour.

Welcome to my worst dining experience ever with excellent service. Not even the waiter who worked his ass off could eliminate what a horrible dining experience I just got back from. Normally I let things sit for a bit before writing a review... 

Tonight I am just too astoundingly pissed off to wait. My dining experienced SUCKED

Pro Tip: DO NOT COME HERE OR EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE AN UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER.

First: We saw a cleared table outside which we were waiting to be seated and had stated we were waiting for an outside seat. Well after we waited and the table was cleared and set, at least 15-20 minutes when there was no wait inside (shoulda known something was amiss right here). We were informed surreptitiously that there wasnt a table available outside as it was for a reservation that hadnt yet arrived.

Second: We ordered our drinks and I was excited to get a liter of tea mixed with Vodka. Well if there was any Vodka in my drink, no one, I LITERALLY MEAN NO ONE, could taste or smell it. So I complained and asked for additional alcohol. $13.50 for a drink that is supposed to be a contain a good amount of alcohol, you think you could taste or smell it slightly right? Well yeah they said it was made properly and wouldnt do anything for me so the waiter got me a shot of vodka which i poured into my drink which guess what? it tasted like there was a hint of alcohol at that point.

Third: This was the worst ribeye i have ever gotten. I requested it to be medium. I do not know how, but they were able to cook the middle medium and half of one side was bloodier than extra rare and the other side was medium rare. I had to get A1 to give it some flavor. This is the first time I have had to ask for A1 in a steakhouse in over a year... *SMH* WTH is wrong with you )(*^&^$'s!

Other stuff: My friends who ordered chicken loved it. My friend who ordered the primerib felt his was as bad as mine and it was covered in lots and lots of fat! So much so that my other friends dog is eating great tonight...

The good things: The waiter who took our order was on point, but was hampered severely by the bartender and the kitchen staff. The mini muffins and biscuits were great. The honey butter was outstanding to go with them. 

If you come here prepare to be disappointed or taken advantage of. I was completely and thoroughly unsatisfied with my entire meal. THERE IS NO REASON TO EAT HERE, so dont waste your money, time, or desire to have a good meal. You will likely leave here disappointed unless you order the chicken.

2.5 stars 

I have visited PastaBar twice now. Both times I have been left with the "Eh.. it's ok" opinion about it. 

The first visit was during their opening week, I believe. When we walked in we were warmly greeted and seated immediately. I noticed the very stark decor and the nice big mirror they had to make the room look huge. We were seated in a corner booth that is not very comfortable for two people that want to sit next to each other, not across from each other (just a note). We took the time to look over a simple menu. They had just obtained their liquor license and our waiter was stumbling on the wine selection. While I understand that the liquor license is new, your knowledge of wine should not be. For such a nice place, the servers should have a slight knowledge of wine and be able to advise on them. When it came time to ordering our meal, our waiter was nice enough to advise us to order a side to split with our pasta if we were hungry. Good to know! 

On my first trip, I ordered the Chitarra alla Carbonara. I enjoyed the dish, except for the fact that it was a tad salty and it had a lot of black pepper in it, personal taste is one thing, but when you're chewing into black pepper...woah. I couldn't even enjoy the flavor of the guanciale in the dish because of the pepper in the sauce. The pasta was very good, I like my pastas al dente and this pasta met my expectation. My date ordered the gnocchi. It was again just ok. On the side my date and I split the meatballs. I thought they were ok. The sauce wasn't your run of the mill spaghetti sauce. It had a smoky, almost barbecued flavor to it. It was good, but again a little crazy with the black pepper. At the end of that trip I was left with a "yeah....uh...I think it was good" and vowed to come back to render my final decision. 

The second trip sealed the coffin for me. We were greeted and seated immediately, once again. I took the time to really check out the place. Oh! They put new artwork up....um... I will refer to the art as "Signs of the Apocalypse". Timothy McVeigh? Really? I found it tasteless, but to each his own. Knocked the restaurant down a notch for me, personally. We ordered the Fried Buffalo Mozz, Marinara "crudo" to start. Our waitress left us to take our time looking at the menu. I decided on Orecchiette with homemade sausage and greens. My friend and I shared the Slow Roasted Pork Shoulder. We noted that our appetizer was taking forever and when I spotted the waitress to ask her about it, she was delivering our dinner.... HUGE pet peeve. I gently said "You delivered our entrees before our appetizer." She stood looking astonished and said "OH! Yes I did!" and continued to stand as if she was lost. Well after we told her we still wanted the appetizer, she came back MUCH later with the incorrect appetizer, and offered to leave it and not charge us for it. NO. Wrong. If the customer ordered an appetizer, they wanted that one for a reason. Our appetizer finally made it as the dessert course of our dining experience, but that's not it folks! Rewind to our meals. My pasta was lukewarm at best. It was like I rewarmed leftover pasta and didn't warm it all the way and decided to eat it out of a Tupperware bowl. This was definitely not the marking of a 17 dollar bowl of pasta. By the time I was about 5 bites into my dish, it was cold. At this point, I was so irritated, I truly didn't care. 

I know we're not in Scottsdale, but does that mean we need to sacrifice quality and service due to a different zip code? I know we're in America, but do we need to offend patrons with artwork of mass murderers while they're trying to eat? Again, to each his/her own, but I doubt I will visit PastaBar again. I'm sure it will thrive without a few people with discerning taste. 

It's not a place I will crave, it's not a place that I would jump to visit again.

Heard about the 16 oz Ribeye for 12.99 here so of course I had to investigate. It's a tough job but hay, somebody has to do it!

As you come in, the bar is the first thing you run into. That's great if you want to eat and drink while inhaling second hand smoke. Just go around to your left and into the actual dining room where there is about 6 booths and 3 tables.

If you are lucky, you just might get Holly as your server. She is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and she provides great service. The vibe I got from her was all positive. It seemed to me like she actually enjoyed her job. Needless to say, I knew I was going to give her a generous tip when it was all said and done.

As promised, I ordered the 12.99 1 pound Ribeye which comes with your choice of Fries or Onion Rings (I got the Onion Rings and man, they were so good!). I also added a side salad which is only a dollar more with any meal. I ordered the Ribeye medium rare topped off with my request of sauted onions and mushrooms. I assume they have been offering this Ribeye deal for a while now because my steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it. It was so juicy and  tender that my wife was kicking herself for not ordering it. Refer to my pic of the inner portion of my exquisite piece of meat. To me, that's how all steak should be cooked and look like when its cut apart.

My wifey ordered the Pretzel appetizer (which is funny because it could be a meal in itself cuz its so huge!) Comes with 3 sauces. Hot mustard, Jalapeno Cream Cheese, and Nacho Cheese infused with Beer! Now that last sauce was kind of weird but definitely a change of pace if you have never had it.

Now probably the only obvious thing that stood out as a negative for me was that even though we were in the supposed "Non Smoking" dining section, you can still smell the smoke coming in from the bar. At the time of our dining experience, I smelled only a little bit of smoke and when we got home, some of the smell was on our clothing. I can only imagine that on really busy nights, the smoke factor would be even worse and that your clothes will smell like an ashtray full of cigarette butts later on.

So if you are ever craving steak, especially Ribeye, then Jacksons Bar and Grill is the place for you! Doesn't matter if it's 11 pm at night or 9 am breakfast time, you can get it at any time because these guys are 24/7!

Tradition. 
Comfort.
Value.

These words best describe our dining experience at Lao Sze Chuan on opening night. The value here was surprising! Every dish we sampled was priced very reasonably, if not competitive. The dishes we tried were served in the perfect sized portions to share between 2-4. My boyfriend and I actually took home 2 bags of leftovers by the end of the evening. 

Right away, I immediately noted the modest presentation and culinary style of master chef Tony Hu. It's a breath of fresh air to not be confronted with nibbles of expensive, weak and flavorless rabbit food. It's also important for me to note that the chef is not reinventing the wheel, he's just putting his spin on classical Szechuan dishes - fine tuning it to his culinary expertise.

We received top-notch service from start to finish. Every member of their well trained staff made us feel extra cared for. We were curious about one of the dishes we tried and one server took his time to explain to us, in detail, about the Szechuan chili and how different chilies cause different effects to the palate. He was articulate and eager to share his knowledge of the cuisine. 

I'll also quickly note that the ambiance was classy and blanketed in a swanky, modern pan asian decor - but that's what we all come to expect from a Vegas casino restaurant. Let me just put this out there - dress code is not strictly enforced. 


Here's what we tried:

//Cold spicy cabbage// complimentary 
The cold, crisp cabbage had a medium spice that tickled our nostrils and tastebuds. We enjoyed the spicy, slightly sweet and addicting crunchy texture so much that we immediately ordered a second round. *pro tip: as addicting as they are, wait to eat them with your dinner! This paired very well with the rice and the rest of our dishes. 5/5

//Chongquin chili oil wontons// (6 wontons) $5.95
We savored the expert layering of sweet, spicy flavor and also admired the striking ginger flavor infused into the chili oil. The Szechuan chili peppers pleasantly tingled and numbed my entire mouth, making it such a unique dining sensation. I only had 2 minor annoyances: the wonton wrappers were not as luscious and soft as I would prefer; they were actually hard and a bit undercooked. The same could be said about the wonton filling; a little lackluster and dry. However, the winning aspect of the entire dish was the sensational and flavorful numbing chili oil sauce. *pro tip: make sure to save the remaining chili oil and pour it over your rice! 4/5

//Sliced tender cold pork marinated in garlic sauce and chili oil// $6.95
This dish was presented exactly how we expected - glistening ribbons of cold, thinly sliced pork. The pork ribbons were buttery soft and marinated in a mouthwatering garlicky chili oil flavor - but the dish is not at all oily. Keep in mind, this dish is not saucy and had mild spice. 5/5

//Lamb with pure cumin// $15.95
A dry (not saucy), stir-fried dish with a gorgeous deep brown color, red and green bell peppers, whole Szechuan chili peppers (not spicy in the slightest, but great smoky flavor), jalapeo slices (not spicy at all), garlic, and onion. Pure cumin is the precise way to describe the overall flavor of this dish. The lamb was generously coated in the warm cumin spice and was extremely bold and aromatic. However I can't emphasize it enough, this dish was lacking spiciness altogether. Also, I personally thought the lamb was a bit too chewy and tough, yet my boyfriend felt that the lamb was expertly prepared and was as tender as it will ever be - two different preferences and views on an arguably tasty dish. In the end, this fact remains - the lovely cumin spice complimented the gamey nature of the lamb very well. 4/5
*edit: just had the most divine (leftover) lunch! The lamb marinated even longer with the intense, flavorful cumin seasonings, making it 100% more tender and flavorful. These are a solid 5/5 now! 

//Eggplant in garlic sauce// $11.95 
A traditional dish with familiar flavors. However, it was a sultry celebration of a classic dish, namely because they selected the most perfectly ripe, plump eggplants and gently cooked them in effort to retain their lovely firm texture and to keep their beautiful shape. They were insanely juicy, sweet and buttery. Also, the sauce was super silky, swimming with an abundance of wood ear mushrooms and crisp pickled cucumber. I couldn't stop eating it, even well after I claimed I was full. 5/5

All minor issues aside, my boyfriend and I absolutely enjoyed our dining experience here; our dinner was satisfying and comforting. We are looking forward to returning soon, in hopes that the small setbacks we encountered were just a case of the opening day jitters. 

I applaud master chef Tony Hu and his World-class staff and wish them continued success.

Pro tip: Grand opening 25% off your entire bill with the discount card that can be obtained at the hostess desk. Expires 10/15.

Third times a charm? This makes three times I have seen a pizza spot in this location. I stopped in and ordered a "Monday's Special" which is a large cheese pizza for $9.99 and additional toppings are extra. Inside was very busy so I guess others are wanting to this place out too. While I was waiting for my pizza, I noticed they have pizza by the slice for sale. I asked if they could add a slice of Sicilian (cheese) to my order priced at $3.25 and make it to-go. My husband isn't a fan of a lot of sauce on a pizza, but I'm the opposite. I asked for a side of sauce (cost .85 cents) to go along with my pizza for dipping and it and I ended up really liking the flavor. The pizza had a thin crust and the right amount of cheese for it. The pizza wasn't very greasy at all and hubby and I both enjoyed it. The Sicilian slice tasted great and had the crisp crust it should, but I was a but disappointed when I got home and opened the paper bag it was in and it was just on a paper plate inside the bag. They did just open, so it's possible they ran out of to-go boxes, but I hope it's not this way all the time. The Sicilian slice was actually my favorite part. The employees were nice and with the different specials they have going on and the food being decent, I can see coming back.

Most pizza joints have a "slice special" and it has a certain time it runs and sometimes only on certain days. Well, here you can get 2 slices and a drink for $5.50 7 days a week anytime. I thought it was a plus that I could get a slice special for dinner instead of just a restricted lunch time special. Aside from pizza they also have wings, fingers, salads, strombolis, pasta, sandwiches and desserts. They also cater.

The Noob's guide to a $20 massage at Bali!

If you guys reading this are like me, you would consider yourself very INEXPERIENCED when it comes to massages in general.  And of course, you've heard plenty of stories about the shady Asian Massage parlors in Vegas LOL.  

Since I am now an expert (jk only been one time lol), I will HELP you out and let you know what to expect!



1)  I showed up with no appointment, but was promptly welcomed and walked to the back.  Maybe during prime time, you might have to wait, but I had NO WAIT on a Thursday around 630pm.  Maybe if you enjoy a particular masseuse, you could schedule an appointment with that person, but since it was my first visit, I only showed up with a dumb look on my face lol.

2)  There are no upsells or uncomfortable requests for additional money.  There were no options, no choices.  No drinks or products to buy.  You walk in for a massage, and you drop a $20 bill on the table on the way out.  Simple and CHEAP...I like that!

3)  I was walked into the back into a large community room with tall cubical-like partitions set up  (BTW, there were places for me to CHARGE my phone).  It is very dark in there, but because it is not a private area, you should probably leave your clothes on, which brings me to my next point :

4)  Wear COMFORTABLE clothing.  I came in with a T-shirt, Jeans and tied tennis shoes, but I should have came in a tank top, shorts, and sandals.  They rub this very low scented lotion pretty much everywhere, so you don't want that crap on your good clothes, as well as them getting rolled up and wrinkled.  Your hair gets all messed up too...don't plan on going out lookin your best when you're finished.

5)  Once you get your area, take off your socks/shoes etc, and relax....maybe put your phone on silent.  My masseuse was there after about 5min with a bucket of hot water for my feet. 

6)  The massage itself : Probably depends on your masseuse for the most part.  Mine was a middle aged lady with a bit of meat on her, and was the perfect "STRENGTH" I needed.  I am a wuss...I don't need anyone breaking my back or gettin super deep-tissue on me, but if you do, ask for it!  As well as once you are on your chair...TELL EM if they need to go easy or harder on ya.

7)  Mine started off with my forehead, hair and scalp, temples, behind the ears (OMG YES!) and then to the neck.  Shoulders, arms and hands were next, to the feet/calves/thighs and then to the back.  I would imagine I could have asked for more or less time in any of the areas, and it would have been acceptable.

8)  My massage lasted about an hour and fifteen from sit down to leaving.  I never noticed her checking her watch, but she kept me BUSY pretty much the entire session.  I felt great right after the massage, and felt a lil beat up the next day.  Nothing crazy, just like a good workout at the gym.

9)  On the way out, she offered water and sat at a bench by the front door to get her tip I presume.  Drop your $20 bill at the front, and then your tip to your masseuse. 

10)  As for the TIP, that obviously depends on your masseuse, your overall experience, and your personal pocketbook.  I won't tell you what to pay, but my experience was wonderful, and I would have personally felt cheap droppin a $5 bill for an hour of hands on work.  I spent $10 and she seemed happy...maybe if it was enlightening, I would have tipped more, but for a great massage, I think $10 was fair.  Still at $30 that's crazy cheap!  I might come here once every week or two!



I know most of this is common sense to the seasoned veteran, but I can't be the only one that has been living under a rock!!

Hope some of this helped the fellow noob!  I know it would have helped me if I would have read this before my first visit :P

Now go get your $20 massage!

What an amazing experience from start to finish! Locals are in for a treat and I have no doubt that word is about to get out. I'm considering myself lucky to be amongst the first set of patrons. 

I have found myself a new favorite sushi spot in Vegas! Got my megaphone out and I'm spreading the good word, starting now. I'm making a prediction that I'm about to become the Duchess of Soho Japanese Restaurant. I'm ready to duke it out for that crown so bring it! ;)

Unreal! These prices are too good to be true... especially for the quality you get! The sushi quality is comparable to high-end restaurants on The Strip. I highly suggest running, not walking, to check Soho Japanese Restaurant out now.  

Took some friends here and every single thing we tried was excellent. The chef hit the ball way out of the park! 

Some things that I recommend trying are:

Ty Ku Coconut Nigori Sake... only $21 for 720 ml (WOW! I'm moving in!)

SOHO Tostadas - Tuna - Hawaiian Poke Sauce (pictured)

Beef Tataki (probably my favorite dish but I'd be hardpressed to choose a favorite, pictured.)

Rock Shrimp Tempura with 3 different sauces (faves were jalapeo aioli and the sweet banana sesame)

Spicy Tuna with Crispy Rice (pictured)

Soft Shell Crab Roll (second favorite, pictured)

Crme Brle (pictured... all of the desserts were really good though so don't mean to leave them out. Just ask my stunt double, she knows all about it! *wink*)

If there's something you usually order that is not on the menu, ask and you might receive. I get the impression that they are still gauging what people would like to see on their menu and/or they're willing to make it if they have the ingredients and it's not. 

I would have taken more pics but everything looked so good it was hard to get everyone to wait before going to town on the food. Our guests were extremely impressed with Soho and it didn't break the bank to take them here. I cannot believe all that we ordered and what we ended up paying. It was especially cool when the owner himself, Mr. John Lee, came out to welcome us. He made us feel like true VIPs and he was really personable and funny. He told us about his plans and I like what he is trying to do with his place. I wish him nothing but the best. 

I have no doubt that Soho Japanese Restaurant is going to do well. The news is going to start spreading like wildfire, mark my words! 

I'm eating there again tonight. Yep, it is THAT good!

Update: As you can tell by my checkins I go here quite regularly. Recently, one of my dining companions needed to eat gluten free because she has celiac disease. Chef John Lee hooked up many options for her. My guests were so impressed! Thanks Soho Japanese Restaurant and John Lee for all the extra special things that you do.

***Todd English's Olives is a reasonably priced and good option for a nice lunch in Las Vegas, but dinner here is, unfortunately, similar to many other restaurants in Las Vegas--expensive with just okay food at best***

I enjoyed my first trip to Todd English's Olives for lunch.  The view was great though you may have to deal with cigarette smoking on the patio and the food was both good and reasonably priced (nice housemade pastas and good scallops).  Dinner at Olives did not offer the same experience.  The dining room was pretty dark and the food was very overpriced like other Las Vegas restaurants backed by well known chefs.

The dinner menu at Olives did have similarities to Olives' lunch offerings.  There was a good mix of starters and housemade pastas (though the housemade pastas on my last trip were more my style).  For dinner, Olives nixes the lunchtime sandwiches for more substantial entrees.

Dinner started the same as lunch--breads with olives and a variety of olive spreads.  I started with the seared foie gras, which was served on buttered brioche and garnished with spice poached pears, honeyed yogurt and crushed walnuts.  It was a mostly sweet plate especially given that the portion of foie gras was so small.  I really enjoyed the spice poached pears--nice caramelization and sweetness.  The foie gras was good and creamy, but it was just too small of a portion.

For my entree, I had the seared scallops, which were served on truffled yukon mashed potatoes and topped with sauteed sea beans and a Cabernet reduction.  The scallops themselves were a very good quality--fresh, moist and soft.  Unfortunately, they were also quite salty.  The sides were okay but nothing special.

For dessert, I had their chocolate molten cake, which was not the most original dessert, but it was still a very good dessert.  The cake had a good outside crust while the center was hot, rich, chocolaty, and gooey.  The cake and the warm, gooey center went very well with the okay but not great ice cream.

Service was just okay.  It took a while to put in our order and while our server seemed pleasant, she also seemed a little distracted.

As mentioned, dinner prices are high here.  The prices are consistent with similar quality restaurants in Las Vegas, but the entree prices here would be very overpriced in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.

Olives' food is at the very least okay, which is actually better than a lot of Vegas restaurants.  Still, the food is not that remarkable and it comes at a very high price at dinner.  Olives is not a bad option for lunch where prices are lower and the atmosphere is nicer, but you might want to seek another option for an upscale dinner in Las Vegas.

Olives is located in Bellagio.  Like almost all of the major hotels and casinos on The Strip, Bellagio offers complimentary valet and self parking.

EAT, pretty simply put, how could I go wrong as I Yelped up a something to eat this morning for some breakfast before returning home from Vegas? 

I generally stay clear of the places that appear so sublime on Yelp, but I was hungry and I was biting on the the Yelp hook again for a relatively new place with a short track record. My GPS in the rent-a-car told me this place didn't exist WTF was this some kind of Yelp trick? I found it anyway a half dozen blocks down from the Fremont Street Experience downtown, nestled under an old apartment complex.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#1FLXhCFNGaHKlo7mePjUCQ  Maybe 707 never existed before Eat made her home here???

After feeding the meter across the street I crossed and hesitantly I walked into a nicely appointed, clean semi industrial, semi earthy space of a restaurant  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#5hwJW33twIKPbYqGXborAw  with only a few customers and was greeted by a tall dude (forget his name) with face full of jewelery, a punker hair-do and a dark gothish demeanor. He showed me to a table and got me some coffee right off. Nice guy.

As I read the menu I knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore Toto, there were a bunch of menu choices that were out of the box and sounded very promising. http://eatdowntownlv.com/breakfast/

FOOD ORDERED:
Truffled Egg Sandwich Two farm-fresh scrambled eggs with wild mushrooms, chives, feta, bacon and smashed potatoes

WHAT I GOT:
Truffled Egg Sandwich and some country style fried potatoes. The sammy was great, yummy thick sliced bacon atop a couple of fried eggs laced with shrooms and some chives and a kiss of feta cheese crumbles on a croissant roll. This sammy was good! And the taters were well seasoned and tasty as well. 4.5*****STARS

The service was great too. Plenty of refills, checked on me couple times too. Had their s**t together.  4.5 **** Stars

I also briefly met Natalie Young  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#kz1WySQnziPX0GxnBQvwQA the chef / owner as she was kicking it with a few patrons at the table next to me. She seemed like a very nice and down to earth gal.

She explained that breakfast crowd for some unknown reason was always a bit slower but lunch and later times were always slammed full of customers. I can believe it if the Lunch and Dinner choices are anything like breakfast food. While a little pricey (still cheaper than the Vegas strip restaurants) it's so worth it.

This place is as cool, hipster, and the food is as good as you are likely to find in a local Las Vegas eatery. Its a local downtown eating establishment that's not on the beaten path when it comes to locale or food. This place is what most trendy LA places wish they were  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=DMEmu_sXcHUW4EFf8Mxpog#lSlXZcBJk6tow9WEoEUcsw hip with legit with great food and real atmosphere.

I gotta try the chicken fried steak next time it looked awesome!

I'll be back, next time in Vegas!

NIGHTMARE ON FREMONT ST

My driver dropped me off at the hotel in the back and when I say driver I received a ride alone in a short bus from the airport. I was staying in the Carson tower and when I walked in I was informed to go to the Carson tower registration. 

So I started walking through the craziness of a Vegas Casino. Maneuvering around tired people who are drinking a lot and losing too much money. They are like rats trapped in a box for 4 days and 3 nights and are in no hurry to go anywhere. But I pushed on and made my way past the mayhem while dragging my suitcase to get to the Carson tower for check in.

When I arrived at the Carson registration desk there was a sign that said Desk closed. Check in at the Rush Tower. What? So now I had to go back through the mayhem again. I pushed through and when I got to the Rush Tower there was a sign that informed me to check in at the Gold Tower registration because the desk was closed. What?

At this point I felt like there were hidden cameras laughing at my every move. I took a deep breath and decided to look for the Gold Tower registration. I asked the lady running the high roller Keno room and she pointed me to the VIP check in door. I knew this wasn't correct but I was frustrated and I was going to make it work. 

So I walked in with my frustrated face and informed the staff of my wild goose chase I had just been on. I also dropped the Keno ladies name because it's always good to drop a name. I believe they took a little pity on me but the staff was very unapologetic to my dilemma. They were also very unfriendly and it was probably because I wasn't a high roller VIP. I did ask them if it's normal to send guests on a scavenger hunt to check in and they looked at me like it wasn't a big deal. I then asked if they were going to fix the incorrect signs and they told me no. After 10 hours of no sleep and traveling I had no more fight in me but I do know this was wrong. 

Upon walking to my room I finally walked past the open registration desk for the Gold Tower. I will say this was a frustrating way to arrive at a hotel. 

So I get into my room and start unpacking my bag. I then go to the bathroom to wash my face and realized someone had used the bathroom. Yes someone sat on the toilet seat, used the toilet paper, unwrapped the soap and used a clean towel. I'm too exhausted for this. I called down and spoke with the front desk. I also asked if I could be moved to a new room. Of course my request was denied and a maid was sent up to clean my room. A housekeeping manager walked in and told the maid to clean my whole room including the sheets. She was actually nice and hard working. So I left my room for an hour to let the maid do her job. 

Day 2...I wake up early and leave to get my work day started. When I arrived back 4 hours later my room wasn't clean. I spoke with the maid in the hall and she said they would clean my room by 1pm. She even wrote me on her list. I came back to the room at 2pm and it wasn't clean. I called Housekeeping and they said they would send someone up. I got back to my room at 5pm and it was still dirty. I called and spoke with a manager who promised to take care of it and my room was finally cleaned at 6pm. Honestly is it that hard?

Day 3...It was my only day to sleep in and the maid bangs 5 times with the vacuum cleaner even though I had a "Do Not Disturb" sign on my door! Was it necessary to ram my door that many times? It was just rude. She knew what she was doing. 

Day 4...The room was prepaid by my client but for some reason the hotel decided to charge my credit card. I called down to the front desk and they were no help. The girl on the phone was rude and unhelpful. Then when I went downstairs that same girl was there. She was mean to me because of our phone call. I asked her to only see a copy of my bill. She printed me a bill with my credit card charged. She then slid open a drawer where she had her personal cell phone and started texting. This was incredibly rude & why would you do this in front of an upset customer. I did snap a photo of her displaying this unacceptable behavior. I really believe the staff needs to go through a hospitality travel course because they don't get it. 

The hotel staff doesn't have any good customer service. The employees seem unhappy and it translates into the bad customer service I received. In all of my travels, I've never seen a more incompetent  staff, then here. 

On another note: the room was nice. I was expecting dirty old gross Vegas but that is not what I received. The casino was very modern. The pool had a shark tank in the middle which was really cool. You could even water slide through the middle of the sharks. This place wasn't what I expected. It's just sad that the customer service isn't there. I score hard on being treated nice and the Golden Nugget failed on every level.

Oh what a night! Took my date here back on June 13. It was a very special time for me, as I remember what a night.

The lady and I came in on a Wednesday evening and were promptly greeted by the hostess. She asked if we'd like to be seated at a table or in their piano bar; it was open seating. Delighted to hear that we could enjoy our dinner with a little live piano, I opted to check out the bar. 

Oh I, got a funny feeling when we walked in the room. And I, as I recall it ended much too soon. Miffed at having to wait 15 minutes now with no waiter stopping by, we went back to the hostess and asked if we could sit somewhere that had actual wait staff to take our orders. After a quick and sincere apology from the hostess and who I believe to have been the manager, they said they would seat us with their best waitress! They too seemed; or at least acted, genuinely concerned that we had to wait so long. 

Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me. She was everything I dreamed she'd be. Within moments of being seated; for real this time, our waitress had our drink orders and was describing the specials of the day.  We ordered up a bowl of (so-so) chicken tortilla soup.Then went on to a (super fantastic) artichoke / goat cheese flat bread!

The Summer Vegetarian Tasting Salad was out-a-sight, it came with one an awesome tasting taco and it was all veggie! The wife loved the chili relleno, and I found the cedar roasted tofu with mango chutney to be top notch. The "grains of life" as they are listed on the menu was one of the better versions of quinoa I've been served in the valley; light refreshing and one of the best protein sources you can find in the veggie kingdom.

Along with our vegetarian sampler, we shared an order of Wood-Roasted Pork Tenderloin; and oh was it tender. Served up with an amazing creamy herb polenta and one or two other vegetables, this meal was 100% delish.

Oh what a night, this meal was turning out to be. Sweet Surrender, what a night! They served me up a few of those Mini Indulgence Desserts. "Yes, I'll have two desserts." Why not, they're only a couple bucks!

Thanks seasons 52 for turning around an unimpressive start and taking care of what could have been an ugly experience, you guys certainly saved the evening!

I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder, Straining my head around and taking my body under. O what a night! After a meal like this I'll be singing that famous Four Seasons song for a days to come. OH what a night! Doo dit doo dit dit, doo dit doo dit dit. Oh what a night!...

A collection of Art, Music, Food, Drink, and good times.....First Friday is a monthly event held in the Downtown Las Vegas arts district.  I'm not sure if you can call it a 'district', but it's the closest thing Vegas has to what outsiders and new residents refer to as 'culture'.  The streets are blocked off and food vendors, art vendors, galleries, and music stages pepper the surrounding area......think of a massive block party or small festival.

I enjoy coming down here with the family from time to time to check out the scene.  It gets really crowded, so it's difficult to really appreciate the art if you're into a more quiet and calm setting like I am.  One First Friday I saw a guy smoking inside the Arts Factory gallery.....that's crazy, the smoke can ruin the artwork!  Of course, nobody said anything to him.....and when I mentioned it, he gave me a "who the F___ are you?!" look and walked away.  *sigh*  Some people come to First Friday for the party and not the art.....that's cool, but not really my style.

There's a lot of local musicians represented down here and a few stages where they perform.....it's kind of cool to see local bands perform since there aren't too many places in Vegas to listen to them.  There's usually a few food trucks and concession stands as well as restaurants down here.  We rarely eat at the event though as the lines can get very long and we don't really enjoy our meals when there's nowhere to sit and enjoy the food.  Definitely worth a trip if you've never been before though.

Some TIPS:

- Parking is very difficult to find.  There is paid valet parking at the Arts Factory on the corner of Charleston & Main St, but it fills up quickly.  Street parking close to the event is sometimes hard to find too.....my recommendation is to get there early or be patient to find a spot.

- Wear comfortable shoes.  The First Friday event covers a few city blocks, so if you want to get the full experience be prepared to walk.

- Bathrooms are a premium.  Because of the large crowds, expect long waits at the restroom.  The Arts Factory has one, some of the smaller galleries around the area won't let you use their private bathroom....keep that in mind.

- If you bring your kids, make sure you keep an eye on them.  It's easy to lose them in the crowd and remember that you're on the streets of Downtown Las Vegas.....not a cool place to lose your kid at night.

Overall, it's a pretty cool experience if you know what to expect.

So my closest 17 relatives and I were going to Vegas and I wanted to try to introduce them to some interesting food that they might not otherwise try. Talking to a group like that is like herding cats! MY GAHHHD!!! It was such a loooooong, painful process! I showed them pictures, menus, prices, and spent hours deciding what to eat for our 3 days in Vegas.

While talking about our dining options, I often heard: "It's expensive!" "Buffet! Let's go to a buffet!" "That's such a small portion!" "Let's go to the Filipino restaurant!" "Umm...where else can we go?" GEEEEZZZZ. I wanted to end my misery so I gave up persuading them to eat somewhere else.

PAN SEARED SCALLOPS - Yessss, oh yeeeees...These scallops were perfectly seared, fresh and tasty! The red wine sauce was so good that I actually ate all the brussels sprouts and parsnip pear pasta that came with it. The sauce had a tremendous flavor but it didn't cover up the scallopy flavor! Is "scallopy" a word? Well, it should be!

Nothing else was as superb as the scallops, though.

COMPLIMENTARY BREAD - They gave us so much! Unfortunately it wasn't fresh off the oven. I didn't even mind if it was recycled but at least heat it up! The olive oil/balsamic vinegar it came with was spicy and wasn't good. My family, on the other hand, must've liked it cuz they inhaled most of the bread and the olive oil, maybe because the entrees were taking too long.

OSSO BUCCO - This was the special that night but it wasn't that special. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, it was alright but it was thirsty. I was not impressed with the risotto it came with either, it was a little tough. A little more water all around would be great!

TIRAMISU - It was decent and that's all I can say about that.

PANNA COTTA - Light, silky, creamy, yummy! But it was just like many a panna cotta I've had.

SERVICE - Needs improvement! We were the only customers for a while and their service was so slow. Our entrees took about 45 minutes. It got even slower when more people came in. Our waitress was MIA for so long that we asked another waiter for the dessert menu. It took about 15 minutes for everyone to decide what to get and our waitress was still missing when we were ready to order. When we asked for our waitress the waiter replied, "She's busy." Uhh...how about us??? We didn't want to be late to the Cirque du Soleil show! So another waiter took our order. We finally saw our waitress again when she served our dessert.

I was kind of disappointed that my family chose to eat here cuz there are so many other excellent restaurants in Las Vegas. It wasn't a total bummer because the scallops kicked serious ass, the panna cotta was good, and my family liked their dishes. So in the end I guess I didn't mind so much that we had dinner here, but I don't think I could be convinced to eat here again.

I have heard a lot about KoMex Fusion so when a new location opened up near me, I wanted to give it a try. The place was packed, but luckily there were still 2 open tables to choose from. I have no idea how many employees were in the back, but I only saw the same two girls working the whole time and they were doing a fantastic job at keeping all of the tables taken care of. Our server took the time to go over the menu with us and suggest things we might like try. 

After my "Mexican Coke" was brought to the table some complimentary chips, salsa and guacamole soon arrived. The guac was fresh and delicious! The salsa had a nice fresh flavor too. Hubby and I decided to order a few different things to try buffet style between us. 

Fried Wonton's ($1.50) - These came 5 to an order and were good! They were stuffed with green onion, ground beef & pork. The dipping sauce that came with it was sweet and yummy. 

Chicken Flauta ($2) - The flavor was very good and I can't even describe it, you will just have to try one of these tasty flautas yourself! It had some sour cream and pico de gallo on the plate as well. 

Fusion Tacos ($1.75 & $2.25 for flour tortilla) - I tried the pork and beef with one being on a corn tortilla and one on a flour tortilla. They weren't totally bad, but nothing spectacular to me. 

Beef Chow Fettuccine ($8.50) - This was the dish hubby wanted to try most. The cabbage and carrots were left out, but the portion was still hearty. The flavor of this dish was something new for me and I liked it. You can't go wrong on this dish with the price, portion and flavor. 

At the end of the meal fortune cookies and a fresh orange were brought to us. The orange was a light and tasty finish to our meal. I was very pleased with the service, taste and price here at KoMex Fusion!

We wanted to BBQ since it was such a gorgeous day outside, so I suggested we give The Butcher Block a try since I had seen such good reviews on yelp. 

I was not disappointed! The Butcher Block is family owned and operated and offeres a wide variety of meats from U.S.D.A. Prime Beef, U.S.D.A. Prime Dry-Aged Beef, Wagyu Kobe Style Beef , Homemade Sausages, just to name some! If you want something on the wild side they offer Gator, Quail, Venison, Elk, Rabbit and plenty of other woodland creatures. Seafood isn't my thing, but they had a good looking variety of stuff including live lobsters and blue crabs. I'm amazed that they had so much to offer for a tiny shop. One thing I noticed was "Jalapeno Bacon" priced at $8.99 each. Compared to what it costs at the grocery store that isn't bad for good quality bacon.

After looking over the selection and wanting pretty much everything, we decided on a few different things to try. I wish I could remember the name (I think porterhouse?!) of the 2 steaks we bought, but I can't. I do know both steaks together cost $35.81 and were worth every penny! I picked put a rub priced at $5.99 for the meat and the steaks just grilled up so nicely and the steak melted in my mouth. We also picked out a "Petite Bacon Wrapped Filet" priced at $5, "Mushroom Caps W/Homemade Sausage" priced at $1 each, "Mini Bell Peppers Stuffed W/Homemade Sausage" priced at $1 each, "Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Jalapenos" priced at $1.50 each and some "Hot Italian Sausages" priced at $4.99 per pound. 

The mushroom caps stuffed with sausage were decent as the peppers stuffed with sausage, but it was the bacon wrapped stuffed jalapenos that were an awesome flavor explosion in my mouth! I was bummed we didn't get more than 4 of them. The sausages were full of flavor, but not too spicy and grilled up perfectly. The petite bacon wrapped filet is the perfect size and price for the smaller appetite. Perfect for spoiled pooches too! I was very pleased with everything and will be stopping here at The Butcher Block more often.

You can also stop by to pick up a sandwich for lunch because they have Boar's Head meats and cheeses! What The Butcher Block is currently charging for the meats and cheeses per pound is too much compared to where I get it at a store near my house. I do think the prices for having them make you a sandwich with the Boar's Head meats and cheeses though is reasonable. The man who helped us behind the counter was very helpful and inside the shop was very clean.

We go to Vegas a lot and usually have always stayed at the larger, flashier hotels, but this time, I decided to try out the Westin. I'm usually a huge fan of the Westin and although this particular location isn't as nice as the majority of them worldwide, it still has all the fixings which I love about the Westin.

Check in was a breeze and friendly. It didn't take much time at all before we were all headed up to our room. I like the fact that this was a smaller hotel and that we didn't have to walk forever to get to our room. The other redeeming factor was that it didn't smell like smoke. Smoking is allowed in the casino area, but since it's so small, you don't have a host of people hanging out anyway.

Between 5 and 7pm, there is a complimentary happy hour for all guests. You can go down to Suede restaurant and enjoy wine, beer, snacks -- all unlimited -- for 2 hrs. We went down and got some fruit, cheese, chips and they had some pretty tasty wine available as well as various beers and soft drinks.

Later, we were making tea in our room and ran out of tea bags, cups and water (they give you Nestle bottled water for free to make tea and coffee with) so we called housekeeping and within 5 mins they had brought us some more.

The Heavenly bed is out of this world -- I just dozed off in the middle of the afternoon enveloped in its comfort. The shower is another plus with its signature 2 shower heads.

We did have a problem with the AC as it wouldn't register any lower than 72 degrees. I had set it to 65 degrees before we left to go out for dinner and when we returned, it was the same temp. So I again called downstairs and they sent an engineer within 5 minutes. He brought us a bar of chocolate -- how awesome is that?

He changed the filter and fixed the problem and was out the door in less than 10 mins. The room remained cool for the whole night. 

So for me, this was an awesome experience. The service was out of this world. My previous experiences with other hotels is that you can call them, but they won't arrive for at least 15-20mins. I would definitely come back again the next time we visit Vegas. I'm done with all those kitschy flashy hotels.

Oh, and winning money at the casino was another huge plus!!

4.5 stars!!!

What's good enough for Nic Cage is good enough for me.

Have been here twice now, both for lunch.   First time I got take out and did the Parma cold sandwich without cheese.   The guy helping me seemed a little preoccupied during the ordering process, and particularly when I was trying to get my iced tea I'd ordered.   A few minutes later I finally realized why he seemed to be brushing me aside (that's a strong way to put it, he was still friendly).   Nic Cage and his wife and son (presumably) were dining at one of the tables nearby.   Now there was a large part of me that wanted to be the annoying fan and run over and ask for him to do a scene of Bad Lieutenant from Port of Call (youtube this immediately if you're unaware).   Since his wife and kid were with him, I figured that might not be the best idea, so I settled for a scene from the Wicker Man instead.   Okay so I really just sat and did nothing and waited for my food.   When I ate it later at my office, I was greatly impressed.  A plethora of olives, pepperocinis and various italian meats.  I marked it as reason #41 why I will never go to a Subway by choice again and awaited my next opportunity to strike.

Well that came yesterday, when I brought a co-worker with me for a sit down lunch.   I was dead set to try a pasta so I could have a more well rounded Yelp Review (I do it all for you guys).   Unfortunately while looking through the menu I couldn't shake the pics of the italian beef sandwich I'd seen in the pics section on this site.  I asked our extremely friendly and efficient waitress which I should get, the italian beef or the rigatoni and she said she hadn't had the rigatoni but the italian beef is amazing.   I mean she didn't even upsell me the extra $1.75 for the pasta.   Sorry Yelp, but the well rounded review will have to wait.  

To go all 17 year old snapchatter on you:   OMG at this sandwich!!! :) :) :)     Just unbelievably stuffed full of juicy beef, pepperocini and with a healthy serving of lusciously melted cheese.   Then with a big bowl of au jus to dip it in.   I'm used to au jus from lesser quality restaurants being very thin and not extremely flavorful.   Not here.   Thick with beef flavor, because what you really need when shoving your mouth full of 2 pounds of beef on a sandwich is more beef flavor.    And you know what?  That's not all.  I'm pretty sure the bread was garlic bread.   In fact, I'm sure of it because the rest of the day my mouth couldn't shake that garlic flavor and flowers wilted when I breathed on them.    A+

Refills on the iced tea came at a fast pace, and I even inconvenienced our poor waitress by asking for one to go, as well as by signing the wrong receipt on a 50/50 split check because I'm a massive idiot.  She took it all in stride.

I promise, next time I'll try the pasta (and get a creepshot of Nic Cage)

I WISH I COULD GIVE SALT CELLAR ZERO STARS.

If you enjoy being treated as if you are an unworthy piece of crap, you will love Salt Cellar.

Short version: 
We were asked to leave because we were ordering drinks and appetizers, not entrees. We received horrible treatment from top down: owner, manager and server because we weren't spending enough money... and the money we were spending (probably around  $200+ total) wasn't worthy of a table. Now myself, my family, nor the friends I was with will ever spend another dime in this poor-excuse for a "service industry" establishment ever again.

Details:
Myself along with four other coworkers came here after work on a Friday to order drinks and food. We all arrived separately between 5-5:30 and put our name in for a table because the bar area did not have enough open seating for us. Two rounds of drinks and about 40 minutes later, we are seated. The waitress offered transfer our bar tab to our new waitress at the table, but we wanted to pay the bartender, to ensure he was getting tipped for his time helping us at the bar.

Once we were seated, we ordered appetizers, and we continued to order drinks.  About 45 minutes in, the server came over and proceeded to say that if we are not ordering dinner, Salt Cellar needs to use the table for people who actually will be ordering dinner. 

So, we, paying customers, need to leave our table because we aren't ordering food of a certain price point? Mind you, we weren't just taking up space, we were still ordering food and drink!!!

Naturally, our reaction was to question her action. She stood firm. We went to the manager to explain what had just happened. Then, the MANAGER essentially said yeah, if you aren't ordering dinner, we need you to leave the table because there are people waiting to eat dinner. Was extremely rude about it, too. (weird concept, waiting for a table at a restaurant, right?)

That alone made us want to leave, and also made us realize that our waitress was probably told to say that, and it probably wasn't her fault. So on our way out, I apologized to our waitress for the way I reacted. 

The owner overheard me apologizing and asked what was going on, and I proceeded to tell him about our experience. To which he, THE OWNER, responded by telling me that I was wrong. Said we couldn't sit at the table if we weren't ordering dinner. He said that we "misrepresented" our intentions of what we would be ordering (we never said we wanted dinner) Anyway, I told him that it's wrong to treat customers that way, and he argued me. Told me I was wrong and we need to leave.
 

Just FYI: we are not a rowdy crowd, we were not loud, annoying, inappropriately dressed. We are are all professionals who had just come from the office and wanted to go to (what we thought was) a decent place to enjoy each others company outside of work.

I am still alive. I am still grateful. I still remember. 

This week, I celebrate the outcome of a lifesaving surgery. This time each year, I take a road trip to remember how lucky I am to be alive and the life lessons that I learned from almost dying. 

El Cortez. A great find. A bargain-priced well-run, cleaner-than-most hotel in old-school downtown dirty Vegas. This location is perfect for a variety of traveler's wants, especially mine.

Steps from the double-decker 'Deuce' bus which runs the strip 24 hours a day starting here. If you have no means of transportation or just love saving lives by letting sober hands take the wheel, having the Deuce, ($7 per 24 hours) steps away is critical.

I didn't love Vegas my first visit. I flew in from LA, stayed at Cesar's Palace, took taxis to and from exclusive nightclubs and fancy steak houses with my former-frat-boy ex. 

Since, I've stayed at a gamut of convenient-to-the-strip hotels, found a nonexclusive place to dance and liked it. But I didn't love Vegas until I found the old-timey Vegas that resides at the Fremont street experience, steps from El Cortez. 

Why I prefer 'downtown' to 'uptown' in general represents one of the reasons my nickname at Yelp is "grassroots girl". The other, is that this account, like all my social networking, began to respond with an authentic voice to corporate injustice. My commitment to the ideology behind both is also what I celebrate this week, why I came & why I loved it here.

I lost my memory once years ago. Can you imagine waking up ten years from now with no memory of the time passing within those ten years? That was me, years ago. 

I was a broke teenager with lavender hair who carried picket signs and fronted a rock band, 13. When I woke up, I was VERY different, twenty something. It wasn't just the blond hair or the fancy car in my driveway that was different, I didn't know my mail carrier's name nor did I care. *The good news about finding out the bad news about yourself, is that you can change.

I'll be prone to falling in love with "uptown" things forever. I will fall off the course once set for myself, ideals included. Ridiculous insecurities will drive my wants to "fit in" and "be accepted". I'll have the opportunity to be both ashamed or proud of where I came from.

With any luck, I'll hang on to 'grassroots' ideals. Won't be easy. Once a year, I will take a road trip to remember how I'd once forgotten everything I stood for on the path to acceptance from everybody but me.

If you want access to the most exclusive nightclubs, if you like the limelight, if you steer from classic towards the newest, coolest, chicest, you might not like it here. If you send your food back because it never meets your standards, if you only frequent the "in" spots only when the "in" crowd is there, this might not be for you. 

If you have not yet deleted all memory of the years spent turning your once-idealistic values to shit, you might choose to stay elsewhere. There was a time in my life when this place wasn't up to my standards.

 I was an asshole. A bitch. A stuck up jerk who only cared about the label beneath her lapel and the logo on her car keys. I'm not saying that I'm not all of the aforementioned still. (I am) It will be a lifetime uphill battle to avoid becoming that way again completely. Loving my stay here is proof that I have not fallen all the way off the tracks.

We had two double beds on the 5th floor. Room 5509 had a GREAT view from the window. We used the coffee maker to make hot water for tea. (the coffee is meh) We watched the big flat-screen TV for the weather report. Over 100 degrees!

A fridge was given to us on request, on the house. We filled it with fruit, drinks and milk for cereal which we purchased from the bodega spotted from our beautiful window view. 

We took advantage of the Shea butter lotions, soaps and high-end toiletries provided. We used the lush bath towels and called down for more. We took some extra towels to the dingy pool 2 blocks away, but we had the pool all to ourselves so had a great time swimming anyway.

I drank espresso every morning from the coolest cafe/record store/art gallery in the world located just steps away. We watched the 'Tribute To Queen' show at the Fremont experience where water was 2 for $1. deep fried Oreo cookies, 99 cents each & green cans of cream ale, 2 bucks. 

We shared steak dinners ($6.99) in the middle of the night when the "gambler's specials" roll out. We treated ourselves to a  $6.25 breakfast buffet (coffee & OJ included) from Vegas Club down the block. We waited behind the wise elderly locals outfitted with walkers and wheel chairs who smiled at us. We smiled back. 

We slept all day in the cool comfort of personalized AC without hearing neighbors or slot machines. We felt safe leaving the casino late-night. Highly recommended. Will return. Hopefully, grassroots forever.;-)

This is one of my favorite restaurants. Vincenzo goes out of his way to make us feel like a VIP every time we come in. Everyone is always so friendly and professional.

The other night I tried the braised beef short ribs. They were absolutely amazing. I've been dreaming about them every since. Boneless and completely melt in your mouth deliciousness.  Served with blue cheese mashed potatoes. $31

My roommate had the lemon chicken and of course I had to try a bite Very moist and tender, really good. $29 he also often orders the risotto $28-$30.

The huge standout was the Caprese Martini, yes I said that right. CAPRESE MARTINI. Holy goodness it was good. It's only a seasonal drink, but I'm hoping that it sticks around for a little while. It's a little steep at $11 but oh so worth it.

In the past I've had the Blackend Chicken  Rigatoni $28 and a super yummy Shrimp and Scallop Ravioli $27. Everything is always amazing. 

They also have an excellent Happy Hour from 4pm to 7pm
Drinks are half price in the bar!!! There's also a special HH Food menu. 

This is a great place for date night or taking a group of friends for a nice dinner. A huge wall of windows, shows off  a nice view of the LV skyline There's also pretty large private dining room and a nice chef's table. 

I can't say enough about how much I love this place!!

A fellow yelper suggested this place for lunch and I had been wanting to try it so she made reservations for us. At first when I walked in I noticed they were packed so was glad a reservation was made. I was seated at a half booth half chair type of table. I never mind these but in this instance I felt cramped. It kinda seemed like a space that was left over and they decided to cram 2 more seats into a corner. If the table were larger it would have made a better difference. I just know next time to request a different table since this one seemed like the only one like it.

The lunch menu was short and simple but had something for everyone. I decided to order the "Grilled Barely Buzzed Cheddar Cheese" that was accompanied by a cup of "Crushed Pea Soup w/Bacon Lardons" priced at $13. I was so pleased with it! The sandwich had such great flavor and I kept wanting more. The pea soup was simply delicious. I can't say enough about how much I liked this and I will for sure be back to order it again! The server was nice and kept checking on our drinks and how we were doing.

They have daily specials and I noticed they offer a kids menu. Some places offer you a mint or root beer candy when leaving but Honey Salt had salt water taffy! There is a fun guestbook before the hostess stand you can sign. If you feel like eating at the bar you can sit there and order from the menu as well but if there are any happy hour specials I didn't see any posted but there is a TV.  There is tables and chairs outside if you are wanting to enjoy the day should the weather be pleasant.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 52/100

Stayed in this hotel with my bf for the first time a few weeks ago and absolutely LOVED IT!

I had never heard of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay before. Apparently it's the nicer of the two towers at Mandalay Bay, and consists entirely of suite-style hotel rooms. 

My bf had booked our stay about four months in advance through Expedia, and he only paid around $110 per night for a HUGE suite for the two of us! It was amazing and you definitely get a bang for your buck!

Parking is free, as with most if not all of the hotels in Vegas. The parking garage is HUGE and has stairs, escalators, and elevators. There's also valet parking and a taxi drop off/pick up area.

Check-in was quick and easy. Lines weren't long and it took us around 5 minutes.

Decor/ambience is really great in this hotel. It doesn't really have a theme like a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's just modern, classy, and trendy. I really liked it!

Elevators were kinda confusing since depending on what floor you're on, you have a certain set of elevators you have to take. However, the elevators are AWESOME and INCREDIBLY fast! We stayed on the 20th floor and it only took a few seconds to get from our room down to the lobby and back!

Our suite was AMAZING. There was a living room area that had a couch, desk, chairs, coffee table, and a huge television! There was also a guest bathroom located right by the door if you have people over. It's a 1/2 bath so just a sink and toilet, but still really awesome! There's also a mini-bar area, but make sure you don't touch any of the items there because they are monitored with a weight system, and you are automatically charged for anything you pick up. 

The bedroom area of our room was really nice. We had an incredible king sized bed with a HUGE wall unit that had a TV in the middle, and his and hers closets on either side of it. The closets even had lights inside to see your clothes, and robes, slippers, hangers, etc.!

Our main bathroom was HUGE! It came with two sinks, toilet, a big shower, and a ginormous bathtub that could fit like 3 people in it. My college dorm room was honestly smaller than this bathroom...it was crazy!

The Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson show plays at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. We didn't watch it, but we plan on watching it during one of our future visits! 

The MIX Lounge at the top of the hotel is supposed to be da bomb. We didn't end up going up there but we saw a ton of people waiting in line to go up.

The ONLY things I didn't love about THEhotel were:

1) LACK OF WIFI IN ROOMS. I think they only had ethernet but that is useless when you only have your smart phone and iPad with you.

2) NO REFRIGERATOR IN SUITE. The bf tried to create a makeshift refrigerator with our ice bucket. Didn't really work...

3) LOCATION. That it's on the far south end of the strip. Like literally the last hotel. Fortunately we drove to Vegas so we used our car to drive further up the strip, but if you don't have a car I can imagine it being a huge issue. It's quite a long walk from THEhotel towards the middle/north end of the strip.

I would definitely stay at THEhotel again and highly recommend it! 5 stars!

The Palazzo and the Venetian are exactly what you expect a Las Vegas Hotel Room to be.  If you look around the room and think to yourself, I could live here and be happy, then you know you are staying in the right place.  All the "basic" rooms are suites with a step down into a living room with sectional couch, desk, and table.  If you want to hang out in a nice room with friends and have a few drinks, then this is your room.  3 flat screen TVs (Living room, Bedroom, and yes in the bathroom).  The marble bathroom has a nice soaking tub and glass shower.  Private room for the toilet as well and dual sinks.  The beds are very high quality with high thread count linen.  Only the Wynn has better beds IMO.  The window drapes are nice and thick if you want to sleep in.  They are also push button automated.  It's a feeling of power to push a button only to reveal the Las Vegas Strip and it's night life below you.  It's the best basic room you will find in Vegas bar none.  5 stars.

For me the pool while nice, isn't on the right side of the hotel.  If you enjoy morning sun, you won't get it here.  Of course this depends on the time of year, but with us staying here in April, only 1/4th of the pool had any sun by 11 am.  Most of the time when we would leave the pool around Noon or 1 for lunch, the pool area was still shaded by the hotel.  Pool side drinks were also a shadow of the quality you get at the Wynn and at the same price tag.  The frozen drinks aren't made to order.   3.5 stars for the pool.

One disadvantage to staying at a high end hotel are the black jack tables.  They aren't cheaper than $15 min.  If your gaming strategy involves putting more money on the table while you are winning, well it's not hard to often have a $45 hand and have to double down.  Now you got $90 on one hand of blackjack.  It can go south real quick if you don't show restraint.  The guy sitting next to me, was playing 3 hands at a time and must have lost about $5,000 in a matter of minutes.  So If you like stumbling downstairs from your room right into a reasonable priced casino, perhaps the Monte Carlo is more your speed than the Palazzo, Venetian, or Wynn.  That said, all the dealers were friendly.  If you are going to lose money, a nice smile and conversation from the guy pulling 6 card 21s to ruin your double down does go a long way. 4 stars for the casino

At first the parking seemed to be crazy here.  It's the only strip resort with an underground garage and not very well designed, with cars getting frustrated trying to get out, it's easy to get mowed down.  But as our stay went on, I realized if you always parked on the bottom floors, you could get a spot right next to the elevators and miss out on all the craziness, so it's one of the shortest walks you'll have from your car to the casino.  Parking 3 stars.

When reading a review about a hotel in Vegas, it's good to know the reviewer's experience with all the strip offers.  Other hotels, I've stayed at are The Wynn, Venetian, MGM Grand, New York New York, Monte Carlo, Luxor, Mandalay Bay, and Las Vegas Hilton.  You aren't going to find the perfect hotel.  Even though I gave the Palazzo 5 stars, they do have flaws.  But feeling you aren't getting luxury for what you pay for, isn't one of them. Just walking around the highly polished luxury hotel will make you feel like a million bucks.

Whenever I get the inkling to play poker, this is one of my favorite places to play.  The decor is ornate yet sophisticated, crowded yet intimate, intimidating yet accommodating.  Where else are you gonna be able to find a poker game in town where Johnny F-ing Chan is standing a few feet from you chatting with the floor manager as you sip on an expresso, proceed to call down an all-in river bet after flopping the nut straight, and throw a few chips from the two stacks of high society that you just raked in to order Thai food from a restaurant within the Aria resort to be delivered table side?   Sounds too much like a deleted scene from Rounders but inevitably a true story starring yours truly, thereby prompting me to pay homage to one of the great poker movies by throwing in a few related quotes from Teddy KGB.  

"Mr. Son of a Bitch, let's play some cards!"
Offering a variety of game options ranging from 1-3 no limit and pot limit Omaha to higher stakes in the Ivey Room where you will likely spot a recognizable pro on any given day, there is constant turnover of players ranging from all levels of skill.  There is also a daily no limit hold-em tournament that starts at 7PM where first prize typically takes in a few thousand dollars and the top 5-6 get paid out on a $125 entry fee. 

"Just like a young man coming in for a quickie, I feel so unsatisfied"
Need some distractions from the cards?  There are multiple flat screen TVs broadcasting various sporting events and the sports-book is a few yards down if one needs to place bets.  The room has an open structure where one has an unobstructed view towards the entrance for people- watching as folks heading to and from the nightclubs stumble back and forth.  Unlike a lot of the other smaller poker rooms, the majority of the servers and a few of the dealers here are quite easy on the eyes (just saying). 

"Want a cookie?"
 If you need to refuel with food, Five-fifty pizza is a few doors down for a nice hearty slice and the Jean Phillipe patisserie is also a short walk for gelato, pastries, and packaged sandwiches/salads.   If you want to stay at the table, you will be hard-pressed to find the variety and quality of dining in any other poker room in town delivered to your seat with a cheesecake factory-like menu that offers a smorgasbord of options from various Aria restaurants on the premises.  Just be sure your eating habits don't serve as a tell when you have a monster hand like Teddy KGB crunching his Oreos.

"In my club, I will splash the pot whenever the fuck I please."
Complimentary drinks!  You can customize your coffee whether it be cappuccino, mocha, espresso served with a classy rock candy sugar stick in a hard mug (although you can request a plastic cup as well), or choose from a variety of sodas and juices including pineapple, watermelon, and  freshly pressed carrot (a few bucks extra), as well as Fiji bottled water, Perrier sparkling water, and I've seen a range of spirits ordered ranging from beer and tequila shots to red wine and cognac (these are the players you need to get in a hand with especially after they've knocked back a few, remember the words of Mike McD "it's immoral to let a sucker keep his money").

"Hanging around, hanging around. Kid's got alligator blood. Can't get rid of him"
Be sure to check in with your Mlife card since 2-3 dollars gets credited to your card with every hour of play, which can help comp for some of the meals above.  A masseuse is also available at an hourly rate on the premises to massage your backside as you play  if your back starts feeling the strain of a long session on the felt.

"That's a position raise.  I call"
Pro-tip: the weekends can often get very busy with long waiting lists.  If you call the number on the the yelp page, they accept calls to be placed on the list before you arrive in person.

"Nyet! Nyet! No More! No! Not tonight! This son of bitch, all night he, "Check. Check. Check." He trap me!"
The poker room is located within a short walk of the self-park lot so be sure to park on the 2nd floor for the shortest path to the tables as well as to minimize your walk of shame on those nights you are delivered a bad beat or on tilt.  

"Respect is all you have left in the morning!"
For any poker player, this is a quintessential Vegas experience where you get the opportunity to partake in exciting gambling action, great food/drink, people-watching and celebrity sightings, and hopefully a cinematic story to take home regardless of where the chips may fall.

Ay Caramba!!!!

I Love This Place!!!!

On our last stop through SinCity before heading out to the airport, my friends and I decided to check out this off-strip Yelp favorite. With over 1,000 reviews, Firefly has scored an impressive 4.5 star average out of five, no easy feat I might add!

Well, it goes without saying that I came with high expectations. Luckily, I was not disappointed...whew!

Upon stepping into the bustling restaurant, i heard rhythmic salsa music being played in the background and it had a very familar Latin cantina vibe to it, which felt casual and fun. With lots of red and orange all around my hankering for tasty tapas became even more amplified!

We were seated conveniently by the large window, which let in a good amount of natural lighting (excellent for foodporn) and spacious enough for us to stow our luggage.

Our server was friendly and helpful with the menu and never pushy or rude.  Within moments of ordering, we got some sliced baguettes drizzled with butter and served with pickled olives and a house butter spread. The bread was warm & crisp and house butter was delicious! 

Then came our drinks and tapas!

I must insist that you try the blood orange mojito. You can taste that the blood orange was deeply infused in this amazing drink and the combination of the refreshing mint makes this exhilarating drink all the more enjoyable! Of course, the sangrias here are phenomenal and also a must if you're going to enjoy tapas here, as well.

Now onto the tapas...

Bacon Wrapped dates with smoked almonds red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles were remarkably good! Crisp bacon wrapped around sweet dates and tooped with fragrant blue cheese crumbles is always a winning combination in my book!

Tuna tartare - the marinated tuna had a tangy Asian flare that had hints of soy, lime & chili...enjoyed on crisp taro chips, it was a delicious contrast of textures and flavors that made this tartare a shining success!

Tierra Y Mar Skewers - Grilled Shrimp, Filet Mignon, Chorizo, Salsa Verde - from the plump shrimp to the juicy filet, each morsel on the skewer was cooked perfectly. Tack on the the tangy  kick of the salsa verde and it was a virtual fiesta in the mouth! 

Duck rolls - Crisp and delicious fried wonton wrapped around tender pieces of succulent braised duck and dressed in a very tangy sweet hoisin sauce, almost too cloyingly sweet but overall, very tasty.

Filet Mignon sliders - Served with a very rich Serrano ham, cabrales cheese sauce and caramelized onions this dish was probably the most disappointing as the burgers were cooked well done leaving them without the awesome pink center I love so much. Because they were well done, they were chewier and less tender juicy and flavorful 

Camarones la diabla - Now this dish was a winner! Bursting with bright flavor and beautifully presented in a fiery red sauce, the plump shrimp were generously dressed with a sauce that creeped up slowly but left a spicy kick at the end of each bite...yum!

Ceviche - Loaded with plump shrimp, this dish came with loads of crunchy tortilla chips and buttery avocado. My only gripe would be that it needed some some spice to kick it up a notch. Nothing a lil Tabasco couldn't fix which our lovely server remedied for us upon request.

For dessert - We enjoyed a caramel flan with a lady finger and it was the perfect end to a delightful meal!

Our server also arranged cab service for us which arrived in record time!

I highly recommend Firefly to anyone looking for a great lunch or evening out with friends. The restaurant is fun, the service is friendly and the food is fantastic!

Happy Eats!

I don't expect this to go anywhere, especially given the level of customer service (or lack thereof)  I received this past weekend at the SLS Las Vegas. Nevertheless, I feel the need to vent so here goes.

I booked a 4-day stay at the SLS in order to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday as well as to ask her to marry me. I had heard that the SLS was a small hotel, recently refurbished and that it provided a hip and trendy way yet friendly atmosphere. I was especially attracted to the fact that the SLS is somewhat removed from the strip and that afforded us some much needed quiet and privacy.

24-hours prior to my arrival I called the hotel to confirm my reservation (which I booked directly with the hotel on-line) as well as to advise reservations that I had a late flight in and therefore required late check-in. At first the agent couldn't locate my reservation and actually told me that I did not have one. After 20-minutes on the telephone he finally located my reservation under the confirmation number i had given him. He told me that he would notate the system about the late arrival and that I should have no problems from there.

I arrived at the SLS shortly before midnight on the 8th only to find out that my reserved room had been assigned to someone else. The agent at the counter seemed clueless about what to do next so I jokingly suggested that she upgrade me to a suite - which she said she would do. The problem? Well the "suite" was a room with two under-sized double beds. Given that this was supposed to have been a romantic getaway long weekend I did not consider the sleeping arrangements to be ideal. I then proceeded to call the front desk who told me they would call me at 10AM the next day when my original room became available. The call never came.

At 11:00 AM on the 9th I went to the front desk to inquire about the room and was told by the employee that no rooms were available, that I should consider myself lucky to have the room I had because it was better than my original room and that perhaps I should check out and try to check back in after 3PM if something became available. Really?!?!?! Not being able to tolerate any more stupidity my girlfriend and I decided to go to the SLS buffet for breakfast. While on the way I stopped to ask an employee if the buffet was open and where it was located. They told me that they didn't know where it was located and went on to tell me that they were likely no longer serving food at 11:30 AM so my girlfriend and I went to the MGM buffet instead. We subsequently found out that the SLS Buffet is indeed open for breakfast, lunch and dinner - but more to follow on that one. 

While all of this was going on my girlfriend was attempting to track down a package that she had delivered to the hotel. The person at the front desk told her to check with the FedEx Office. The FedEx Office told her to check with the mail room. Nobody knew anything about the package so I asked the concierge and explained the story to her. She was surprised to learn that the SLS had an actual mail room. She did locate it, however we were promptly informed that we could not go to the mail room because it was an employee only area. The concierge was helpful in that she offered to have a bell-hop deliver the package, the problem however is that the package wasn't delivered to us until 4-hours after the request.

Back to the room fiasco - we stayed in the room with the undersized beds. The lack of helpfulness of the staff wore us out.

Back to the buffet - we finally made it there Sunday. The food was great, it's a shame that there was nobody around to bring us drinks - the wait staff (in typical SLS fashion) was missing and less than helpful.

Oh and then there is the cab ride where the valet at the gate stopped our cab driver to yell at him (using profanities) and asking what country he thought he was driving in because he accidentally turned out in the wrong direction.

To top it all off everyone at the SLS kept addressing me as Mr. Fxxxxo when my name is Sxxxxxe. Fxxxxo is my girlfriends last name. Given that I made the reservations, that I paid for the trip and that everything was under Sxxxxxe I am unsure why the SLS couldn't get something as simple as my name right. 

SLS - Our experience was horrible. I ended up not proposing to my girlfriend because of the stress that you put on both of us. You ruined my girlfriend's long birthday weekend and we will never be back. It's really a shame because on the surface the SLS is a great hotel but when you put lipstick on a pig you still have a pig and that is exactly what the SLS is - a painted pig.

Again, I expect this will fall on deaf ears but I really needed to vent.

5/31/13

Finally stopped in for my first time visit to order takeout.  Since it was my first time, I wanted to check out the menu board overhead, but staring up at menu boards while people are waiting to take my order has never been my cup o' tea, so I looked around for a leaflet to peruse through, instead.  I liked the open layout of the grill and kitchen, as i was able to see the cooks in action.  I read under "Habanero Specialties" a listing for Chiles rellenos, a roasted poblano chile stuffed with jack cheese combo (rice, choice of beans-refried or black, choice of tortillas (corn, wheat, or flour) and pico de gallo for $9, and I'm a cheese-lover, so I had to try this. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=GtRJBN7OK6Vhu6x-zgZgrA#GtRJBN7OK6Vhu6x-zgZgrA  Looking around for a meaty meal, I saw under "Parrillada," that I could get a four-meat combo http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=GtRJBN7OK6Vhu6x-zgZgrA#vd5i45jyypKwClT1WigsnQ (grilled steak and chicken, chorizo, and carnitas, with rice, choice of beans, choice of tortilla, guacamole, and sour cream for one person, $11, but I also noticed that diners could add shrimp to their meals, so I wondered if the red meats were grilled alongside the shrimp (I'm allergic to shellfish), or perhaps there is a designated area where shrimp are partitioned away from the other meats, and looking past the order-taker's shoulder, I could see that shrimp are indeed cooked on the same grill with the meats.  I told the order-taker that I would like to try some of their barbecue, but I can't if the meats are cooked in the same area as the shrimp, since I have a shrimp allergy, and she fired off a few sentences in Spanish to the cook, who replied with a few sentences of his own, after which she turned to me and said that my meats would be prepared in a separate pan.  Sweet!!

While my orders were cooking, I surveyed the place and observed that while the resto is small, it didn't FEEL small, because of all the flourishes that gave the place a bigger presence (wooden furnishings and counters, a mini-bar with a handful of Mexican beer pumps, a small fridge stocked with bottles of Mexican beer if you don't want to order drafts, a counter in front of the grills where you may dine, or sit and sip on a pint of beer while you wait for your takeout (which is what one guy did while I paid for my order and waited it out on one of the dining tables).  There's even patio seating, should you choose to dine alfresco, or if you don't want to leave the restaurant smelling like you spent all day cooking in the kitchen!

Both dishes were muy delicioso!  Since I had two entrees, I decided to try both bean choices (refried and black), as well as two tortilla choices (wheat and flour), and they were all very good!  The black beans were soft and tender- I was expecting something like biting into boiled lima or kidney beans, but the black beans were softer, more akin to firm, spring peas (not mushy!).  I also appreciated that both bean choices weren't very salty and tasted freshly-prepared and sprinkled with cotija cheese, not from cans and doctored over the stove.  The chile relleno batter tasted decidedly eggy, which I did not mind, but if you don't like your foods eggy, then you might want to stay away from this dish.  I usually try to avoid tomatoes (inflammatory), but the pico de gallo smelled so bright and flavorful that I couldn't resist, and I'm glad I didn't, for it complemented the cheesy relleno perfectly!  As for the barbecue meats, I liked them all, even the spicy chorizo!  I'd say the grilled steak was my fave, followed by the diabolical chorizo, which also came with similarly-seasoned, grilled cubed potatoes.  (I didn't mind the spice level of the chorizo while the meal was fresh, but I noticed that it tasted too salty and too spicy for me to tolerate subsequent leftover meals- strange, that.)  While I enjoyed the grilled chicken (I try to avoid anything corn-based, since I'm allergic to corn, and yes, that would also include eggs... one or two in a batter is OK for me on most days), I wondered if I could order my next barbecue combo sans chicken and with more grilled steak, instead?  Doesn't hurt to ask...

I returned the next night for another installment, since Mom finished the chile relleno leftovers soon after I arrived home with them.  Would love to go back and dine-in one of these days, and perhaps enjoy a complementing beverage and dessert with my meal!  :)  Mmm... happy hour menu sounds delightful, too!

You wouldn't know it if you saw me, but I'm a girl that can eat. I'm part Samoan so inside this 100 pound 5'2" frame lives a very large and in charge polynesian appetite. 

My BF and I have sworn off buffets but we made an exception during our trip to Las Vegas. It's not that I'm against all-you-can-eat food but I am against the mediocrity that most buffets offer. I'd rather have three bites of something amazing, than thirty bites of something which can best be described as "meh." But when in Vegas I feel as though having at least one buffet is just something you must do. Much like you must see the fountains at the Bellagio. Your trip just would not be complete without it! 

So after scanning the Yelp reviews we decided to go to the buffet at the Wynn. We went with three other friends and after waiting in line for about 10 minutes we were seated. My BF and I strategically planned to eat our weight in Alaskan King Crab legs. I personally feel like that's really the only way to get your money's worth. Eat the most expensive thing you can find until you throw up! I take that back, eat the most expensive thing until you can't even think of eating it for a solid week. 

I waited in line for the crab legs and they were pre-cracked which I thought was AWESOME! Less time cracking legs and more time eating! While waiting in line there was an old Chinese lady who tried to cut and I totally froze her out of the way with two plates and a bowl of butter. Hey, I don't care how old you are, there is no cutting when it comes to crab! She made as though she didn't speak English, but the language of cutting is Universal and that sneaky senior citizen knew exactly what she was doing. I might sound heartless but my own Grandma is totally crafty, so don't even play me woman. I see right thru you and your "Oh I didn't know'" fake liners! Back of the line Grannie!

My BF and I tore through four plates of crab legs and our friends were dumbfounded. When you have hot butter to dip into, anything is possible! I stood up and said "Now that I've got gout, I'm ready to move onto something else." I have to say that everything else I ate was pretty mediocre. How do you top crab legs? It just can't be done. I can say that you should stay away from the tom yum soup station. That stuff was rancid! 

We ended our buffet experience with the dessert station. They made candy apples, crepes, rice crispy treats, creme brulee, gelato, etc. It was great! I had them make me a crepe with peaches and chocolate which was not a 10 but a solid 7. It's a buffet, what do you expect? 

Would I do it again? 50/50 and it would totally depend on how big of a crab craving I had.

if nothing else Yelpers, please read the kicker at the end. McFadden's is not playing fair with Yelp.

I've been their 3 times as I really wanted to like the place.  it looks great inside and out and they have a really good happy hour and specials each night.

visit one was for opening night (Thursday night).  they ran everything pretty well for as packed as it was.  the passed apps were pretty good.  service was just ok, but expected as it was their first night.

next visit last Tuesday was barely ok.  I confused the bartender with trying to order a Black and Gold.  I guess it's only available at the main bar by the entrance.  She probably should have known this by then, not running around behind the bar then finally asking the other bartender.  
I love Heather and Singing with the Band karaoke.  the karaoke was only thing that kept my interest while I waited over 30 minutes for wings. The wings were pretty good and came with fries.  they are not breaded and I really like the teriyaki sauce.
even with sitting at the bar the service was slow.  my bartender seemed like she had no prior experience, as she relied on her coworker for help often.

my last visit (figuratively and literally) Friday night was even worse.  we sat on the patio.  our server arrived quickly, then got slower and slower, often forgetting drinks.
I ordered the wings again, but this time they did not come with fries. odd.
it took over 30 minutes to get our checks.  one couple was about to walk out, we were going to head inside and let her find us.  she finally came back out as we were getting up.

it seems they hired staff based solely on looks or other criteria.  their lack of experience is overwhelming.

and the kicker:  their marketing manager Gaby sent an email to all their employees blatantly asking them to do Yelp reviews on where they work!!  SHAME!  I posted a copy of the email in the pictures. Pasted  below is the body of the text.

Do NOT board your pets here because THEY WILL LOSE THEM!!!!

My friend and I came to Vegas for Memorial Day weekend and she had to bring her dog Crusher, with us since no one could watch him back home in the Bay Area. She decided to board him here at Green Valley because she used their services before when she used to live in the area. 

We dropped him off before the weekend and when we came back to pick him up on Monday morning around 11:30, they told us they LOST Crusher around 9:00am when they took him for a morning walk. Somehow he slipped out of his harness and leash... I do not understand how that is possible. Crusher is a chihuahua/daschund mix, so he is a small dog, but the harness fit him perfectly. If he were to slip out, wouldn't the person walking him feel him tugging and struggling to escape? Somehow their story of him just simply escaping his leash made no sense to us. It seems very likely that whoever was walking him was not even paying attention to what Crusher was doing at the time...

They said they had been searching for him for the past two hours but had no luck. We were speechless... We darted out the doors and began searching for him ourselves for the next 5 hours. The staff insisted they were helping us find him but we barely saw anyone out there during the search. I mean, if I worked at that facility and lost someone's pet, I would not stop searching until I found it! They argued that they couldn't keep watch all day because they had a lot of things to do at the hospital as well, which is understandable, but they should have at least had someone out there helping us search for Crusher. They were the ones responsible for losing him, yet they were finding excuses to not be on top of the search. Later on we were told that Crusher was not lost at 9:00am, but instead he was lost at 7:45am. Regardless of what time he was lost, why wasn't his owner informed RIGHT AWAY?? They should have called her the moment he slipped from their fingers! If they called her sooner, we would have been able to head over there right away and search for him. Maybe we would have found him sooner if he heard his mom's voice pleading for him to return... Were they even planning on calling her to give her the bad news? We had to come in to the hospital for them to even mention he was gone..

So after searching for many hours, we decided to stay in Vegas for one more night just in case he was found. Tuesday morning arrived and there was still no news regarding Crusher's whereabouts. That morning we went back to Green Valley. They gave us a list of numbers and addresses of different shelters in the area. We called and visited a few of them trying to find him but still, no luck. Then at 1:30 someone called Green Valley saying they thought they spotted him around Sunset and Valle Verde. We immediately went to the area to find him, searched for hours, and still wasn't able to locate him.. Again, we didn't see ANYONE from the hospital helping us search for him. Time was running out and we had to return to San Francisco soon. We headed back to Green Valley and spoke to them about how disappointed we were that no one was helping us search. We had to head back home to San Francisco and we were worried that no one would bother to look for him once we were gone... They assured us they would not stop searching until they found him. 

That evening, we had to leave without Crusher. My friend was so worried about his current condition. It was so hot.. Was he dehydrated? Did he get hit by a car? Did anyone find him and take him in as their own pet? Endless questions but no answers.

She posted a lost and found ad on Craigslist with a picture of Crusher and where he was last seen. After we arrived home, she kept receiving e-mails from people saying they saw a dog like him around the CVS Pharmacy. She continued to call Green Valley to tell them to look for him there. They said they were looking but couldn't find him. It took one of her friends who used to live with her to drive all the way from Southern California to that CVS Pharmacy in Henderson to finally find Crusher. Amazingly, he was able to locate Crusher right away. Crusher recognized his voice and followed him. Although he is malnourished, he is alive and will reunite with his owner very soon!!

Somehow we feel that Green Valley did not follow through with what they promised. Yes, they posted up fliers and called local animal shelters, but we feel like Crusher could have been found sooner if they had searched harder. And this whole situation could have been avoided if the person walking him was paying attention in the first place. 

So, I do apologize for this long long review. But I want people to be aware of what happened. If it happened to one dog, it can happen to yours.

3.5 stars!  The crew decided to try a new sushi spot tonight.  After looking around Yelp, we decided to stop here since we intended to go grab boba afterwards at a nearby place.  After bracing ourselves for a strip mall sushi joint, we walked in and our dinner adventure begins.

It's a small cozy restaurant with a few modest tables and some seating at the sushi bar.  It's sparsely decorate with the personality of a goldfish.  Oh well.  We're here for the food anyways.  From what I could tell, there was one sushi chef making the rolls, two waitresses, and perhaps someone else in the back area prepping stuff.  We were told to sit anywhere we want and the most unenthusiastic waitress [we'll call her "unhappy child"] and her trainee served us.  Do you ever get that feeling that your server just doesn't care about her job?  Yeah, that's totally the vibe her.  The trainee was super friendly though and seemed more than willing to answer any questions and refill our waters and tea.

10-minutes of decision making later, we decided to order a sushi boat set and some Happy Hour rolls on the side.  Set A for $35 comes with nine pieces of sashimi, five pieces sushi, and two "special rolls."  When asked what the special rolls were, the unhappy child just shrugged and told us, "whatever the chef wants to make."  Oookaaay...  I'm no expert but I'm pretty sure there's actual names for the rolls but she was just too lazy to ask.  Whatever.

After eating a small cucumber salad with imitation crab and too much dressing, the rolls all came out and shortly after, the boat!  I was starting to get excited again, after the unhappy child dampened the mood, upon seeing thick cuts of sashimi and our rolls.  I decided that after eating some HH salmon rolls and a few avocado rolls, I wanted my first bite from the boat to be some salmon sashimi.  I love salmon.  They were so generously thickly cut but it wasn't fresh.  No cantaloupe smell but still smooth.  It was kind of a let down and the rolls were unevenly cut!  Everything else was pretty much the same:  big portion and/or cuts, not the best quality.  I do like how they offer fresh wasabi.

$20ea. before tip for the three of us for a $35 sushi boat and four Happy Hour rolls.  Cheap on the wallet AND on the quality.  One pro is, if you want to eat on a budget, Happy Hour is all day, every day, and runs between $3-7 [if you think about it, that just means they have really cheaply priced rolls and there's no real specials here].  Not the best sushi in the west valley but okay prices for okay food.

This ain't no Hometown Buffet, yo!

FYI, I am NOT a fan of buffets! When my brother wanted to spend his birthday here out of ALL the other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I wanted to say, "What?!?! Are you serious?!?! What the heck is wrong with you?!?! Do we really need 3000 calories in one meal???"

But hey, he was paying for our dinner at $36.95/person so I just kept my mouth shut. I'm sure my bratty face showed how I was feeling anyway. While dining here, I realized that the food was much better than most buffets. Actually, it's the best buffet I've been to so far.

Excellent dishes:
Thai Beef Salad
Crab legs
Smoked Salmon
Chicken with some kind of mango salsa
Pepperoni Pizza
And so many more but I can't remember cuz I was in a food coma.

Not so great dishes:
All the sushi rolls - rice was old, dry, tough. Sushi is never good at a buffet. I know this but I was curious, I just wanted to try it.
And some other things but I can't remember cuz I was in a food coma.

Then there's the dessert area....EEEEEEEEEEEEKKK!  It was HEAVEN!!! A crepe station, gelato, cookies, carrot cake, cheescakes, cupcakes, mousse, chocolate-dipped marshmallows, etc. The creme brulee was my favorite! I think I tried almost ALL of them. YAY for sugar!!! I had about 10 desserts on the table in front of me. WOOO!

Service was excellent! I wish I remembered the name of the guy who helped us with drinks and other things cuz he was really patient with the 18 of us. We needed more utensils, napkins, drinks and we changed the seating for the kids, our requests seemed endless but we didn't have to wait long to get them. When my family realized he was Filipino, they were all over him and kept asking him questions: "Where do you live?" "Where's your family?" "How long have you been here?" "Can you take our picture?" "Can you take one more?" "Okay, one more picture?" I felt sorry for the guy but it didn't look like it bothered him at all. He never stopped working or smiling while he was answering a billion questions...and thank you for taking 50 pics of us!

I had so much fun trying so many different things! I'm glad my brother celebrated his birthday here. For a buffet, this is really good!

My wife and I were in the area and had this place bookmarked for a while.  It's rare that a J-AYCE reviews are as swingy as Sakana but I was desperate for sushi.  I called them to ask if they were a Japanese owned and run restaurant (semi-important to my wife) and the lady on the other end said "yes" in a super annoyed teenager way like I asked if she was still going out with that guy she met while waiting in line for hot dog on a stick at the Meadows Mall food court last week.

Next thing you know...we see an all Korean staff, hear K-pop music in the air and I am all "eff it, we're starving, let's eat".  It was nice of them to keep all that Kabuki signage up to make the place easy to find :P  I am docking them a star just for that.  

We chose to eat at the sushi bar and our sushi chef was definitely one of the highlights of dinner.  He was personable, funny and asked us random questions throughout the evening like:

Chef: Did you just get married?
Us: No.  It's been over 6 years.
Chef:  Oh.  Just asking because you look happy.

(a few minutes later)

Chef asks my wife: Is it your birthday?
Wife: No it's not.
Chef: Well why else would he take you here?

HAHA

(later)

Chef asks me: Did you do something wrong to upset her?  Did you bring her here to apologize?  Maybe that's why you're here.
Me: (laughing) If I had to do that, we would be at a much more expensive place!

So on to the food.  They had an appetizer called "The Shit".  How could I not order this?  It was kind of a tempura fried California roll with some other ingredients I couldn't make out that came with a side of spicy mayo.  It was ok.  Foie gras wrapped in bacon...that would have been the shit.  

Their pork belly is the BEST I've had at any AYCE.  I had five orders of it.  I thought I was there for fish?

I liked their sashimi plates, fresh oysters and our comedic chef sliced up some special pieces that weren't escolar or had cream cheese in them.  Nice.  Lots of reviewers have raved about the fish to rice ratio and it's great.  I would nigiri my way to fullness if we ever came here again.

Javier's is hit or miss at this location so that's why I gave four stars instead of five. I've been to them all practically, from Cabo, Mexico to Irvine to the one in the airport at John Wayne. Only Javier's I haven't been to is the one at Crystal Cove. 

For whatever reason, sometimes the food at the Aria location tastes consistent with my five star reviews of all their other locations, and sometimes it just tastes off. 

My first experience with this restaurant pissed me off and I almost didn't go back again. I ordered "enchiladas de mariscos" which is my favorite dish and what I order at all the other Javier's. I didn't think I even needed to look at the menu because I assumed it was the same as all the other locations, so I never bothered and just ordered away. I guess, in retrospect, I should have double-checked because the waiter brought me out chicken enchiladas instead of what I wanted. The second I tasted it I noticed something was not quite right but it was dark in there and I just assumed since this was a different Javier's and my first time, that maybe their cooks weren't up to speed out here in Vegas yet. The place was still somewhat new at the time. It didn't taste amazing like I was used to so I ate about half of one enchilada and then finally gave up, thinking another one bites the dust! I called the waiter over and told them that I was very disappointed with my dish (which I never do, for the record). I told him he must have brought me the wrong thing or the chef had no clue what was up and then he said, "No, I brought you what you ordered, enchiladas suizas." and I said, "No, I had ordered enchiladas de mariscos!" So yeah, obvious miscommunication there! That explained the mystery of why it didn't taste right. However, the waiter didn't offer to fix the situation and instead told me not to tip him. No clue what that was all about. Maybe the management takes it out of the waiters' tips if they get the orders wrong. I dunno... I've never had that happen before. Just thought that was the most interesting customer service I had ever received to date, if you even want to call that customer service. So needless to say, I left there unhappy that night. Thank god I complained because had I not, I would have written this place off as a no go. And waiter guy still got a tip even though I shoulda stiffed him! I'm too nice...

Anyway... Note to everyone who is used to calling it Enchiladas de Mariscos: It's actually called "Seafood Enchiladas" here and only here. Why my waiter, who spoke Spanish mind you, didn't get this right is beyond me but whatever! Mariscos translates to "seafood". What's the problemo, seor? Since the staff doesn't get it, they should be told that at the other locations this particular dish is called something different so technically it has two names. And they should be told what that name is so as to avoid other Javier's professionals, like me, from getting chicken enchiladas when they want seafood. And one more thing, if the waiters get it wrong, they should credit you back the price of your dish or remake your food for you the right way, at least. None of that don't tip me BS because that still doesn't make up for your mistake!

Anywhoooo... hate to admit it but these aholes at Javier's sure make good food (sometimes at this location, not 100% consistent) so that's why I keep coming back and not boycotting, in spite of my bad first impression with this Aria location. And it's not like I'm about to take a four hour drive to Cali just to satisfy my Javier's craving elsewhere. So I guess they have me stuck eating here, from time to time, when my cravings hit.

I absolutely love their organic margaritas (cadillac style). I guess after a few of those I'm willing to accept any of the crap that jerk Javier wishes to dish at me. I'm such a sucker! Their chips and salsa are addictive so be careful. Mustn't be too full for when your entre arrives! Another thing, the atmosphere here is a 10! I love that dark, Guernica style carving along the back wall. This is a great place to take a date. *hint hint, nudge nudge* Hear that boys? Just pray that they don't get her order wrong or if they do, that your date is laid back.

This place can suck my cock.

I travel all over the world, have stayed in hundreds of hotels, and never have I been so frustrated by a hotel.  

The exterior of the hotel is VERY bland.  Looks like a middle-class apartment complex but with 28 floors.  White.  Stale.  Glad it's farther north towards all the shittier casinos where it belongs.

Valet services were constructed VERY poorly.  You have to walk across incoming traffic to receive your car and there are like two benches to sit at and no place to really stand.  

If you choose to self-park, enjoy the slowest freight elevator of your life.  That is, if you're lucky enough to be there when they're even running.  One of the two elevators was out on Friday night.  On Saturday night, the maintenance guy was working on it and the other elevator stopped working too.  As I had to trek up six flights to get to my car, I was passing dozens of people not happy to be descending several flights of stairs because neither elevator was working.  Sunday afternoon, the situation didn't seem resolved.  Seems as though one of the elevators was working as a crowd of about 25 people were waiting on it.

Love to gamble?  First opportunity is hoping to fuck you picked the right check-in line.  It's not single-file (as it should be to ensure you get treated prior to the people who wander up ten minutes after you).  You walk up, have about a dozen options, pick the shortest one and hope you're not behind somebody trying to negotiate a purchase of the hotel (or whatever else took twenty minutes).  Fortunately, EVERY lane seemed slow.  Regardless, people who arrived ten minutes after I stood in line kept reaching the desk prior to me.  Yeah, that pissed me off.  Oh, did I mention they couldn't find my reservation and forced me to call the third party I booked through for confirmation even though I had a confirmation email on hand?  Then, my third party (Priceline) told me nobody at the hotel was answering the phone so they could square my reservation.  It took me over an hour to get that squared away before I could check in.  They also came thhhiiiiiis close to handing me a room booked by a different guest who shares my name.  "Your room has been pre-paid by Hotwire.  Here are your keys."  "Uh, I didn't use Hotwire."  Glad I caught it.  

Then, you are handed your key and, prior to even reaching the elevators, are forced to show security your key.  I finally get all my bags, headed towards my room, and now I've gotta stop, drop my luggage, and fish for my key?  Somebody walked innocently past as they headed towards the elevators and the security guy SCREAMED at him:  "SIR!!  I NEED TO SEE YOUR KEY!!!!!"  #class #sophistication.  Who the fuck is sneaking into the rooms at 3pm?  Is that process necessary?

Then, the elevator is a hall of mirrors like you see at a funhouse.  It's overwhelming.  You can't tell which elevators are arriving.  And there are like a half-dozen elevators but none seem to ever be available.  It's always fun to be the first one to the elevators, wait a few minutes for one to arrive, the one that shows up is five feet away, people who just arrived scurry on and pack it, and you have to wait another five minutes for the next one.

To call for the elevator in the first place you have to swipe your room key again and then press the call button.  Amusing watching people press the call button repeatedly and getting frustrated when the up arrow doesn't light up until they eventually figure out they need to swipe their room key.  Calling an elevator really doesn't need to be such a sophisticated process. 

The rooms . . . meh.  Very uninspiring.  Trying for a chic boutiquey thing but it does nothing to impress.  Directly above my bed I have a black and white panoramic photo of people in a crowd that look as if they're at a music festival.  Um.  Okaaaay.  And there was a long brown hair on the desk.  Way to clean, gang!

The bathroom is small and not nearly as nice as most of the 4-star Strip hotels.  No bathtub.  

The TV is a gorgeous flat-screen mounted on the wall but, of course, it doesn't work.  Wouldn't turn on this morning.  Finally, randomly turned on hours later when I returned.  As I was watching football, a message about a loose cable kept popping up so I had to press 'ok' repeatedly to get it to finally disappear.  Then the screen froze and it hasn't worked since.  I picked up the phone and called 'guest SERVICES' and it just rang for about ten minutes.  I put it on speakerphone and just addressed other things til somebody finally picked up.  They said they'd send somebody right up.  That was an hour ago.  It's given me enough time to lay down and type this review via iphone.  

I have one more night at this place.  Ugh : (

Will I be back?  I'd rather get shot in the face.

Still waiting for somebody to fix my tv situation.  Been an hour and a half

Just left.  Waited thirty minutes in the taxi line.  Few cabs go that far North (per cabbie).

I don't know why I do this to myself...How long does it take to make a bowl of delicious and nutritious oatmeal, complete with cinnamon, nutmeg, maple, raisin's...you know something good for me?

I'll tell you how long...exactly 180 seconds...from scratch:)

But, I got busy this morning and forgot...again!

So I ran all morning long on nothing but coffee (which would be enough, some days...but not today:)

By the time I got done with power yoga (on an empty stomach), I was feeling decidedly in need of some serious retox...but I didn't go that way:)

I decided to try to eat something a little bit healthy...for a change:)

And, since I hadn't been to Bertha's in a couple of years, and they have their new location opened up, I dropped by Bertha's to grab a sandwich re-fortify me:)

I liked Bertha's prior incarnation, over behind the post office at 40th and Thomas, and I was pretty regular customer there for a couple of years.

This location, this version (Bertha's - version 1.5...it can't possibly be what they intended, and must therefore be a mid-release version), is lacking in few areas:

* Service - I used to appreciate that I was greeted with smile and a  "hi" when I walked in:)...not at Bertha's - v1.5...no "hello"...no "how can I help you"...no response to my "hi"...just a vacant stare until I decided what I was going to have, then writing followed by the total...that was it, followed by a shouted "ORDER" to the kitchen:(

* Quality - I appreciated that they always paid attention to details, and that my sandwiches, soup, baked treats, whatever, were always well prepared and tasty...When I got my Ham and Cheese Panini (to go...I was a little busy), no bag check and no napkins when I looked in the bag:(...I asked for them and was handed a wad of napkins with little more than a grunt...I headed down the road and opened up the sandwich...took one bite and found ice crystals in the middle of the ham:(...semi-warm on the outside and still frozen inside (or did the definition of "Panini" change while I wasn't looking?)

* Atmosphere - I liked the old space...I realize that Bertha's - v1.0 was small, but it was nice:)...the new release, Bertha's - v1.5 space looks and feels like the "remodeled on a budget" second hand clothing store that this space probably was...not a great room and not well done on the remodel...I was waiting for my sandwich and thinking "why were they closed for 5 months?...I could have done this remodel all by myself over a long weekend, for about $200, including the apartment white paint for the walls"

I made a completely legal U-Turn (as far as you know) and went back to Bertha's - v1.5, and asked them, about the ice in my Panini:(

No "oh, I'm sorry", no "can we make you another?"...just the blank stare from counter girl...

I suggested another attempt at Panini-ing my panini...she took it back to the kitchen, where I heard "It's still cold" and returned a couple of minutes later with my Panini (easily identifiable by my bite marks on the corner of the panini...

They microwaved the friggin' thing!!! :-(

I headed back to my car, and tried to eat my Panini...do you know what microwaving does to thick crusted Italian rolls?...It turns the crust to concrete, is what it does.

I was starving and I still only managed to get through about  1/4 of the Panini.

I think I am going to wait until the next release of Bertha's, to reload.

It could be that both Bertha's - v2.0 and Windows 7 will surprise and delight me...but I have my doubts.

Make sure you come prepared to stand in line here at the Bachannal Buffet. Being one of the more popular buffet's on The Strip, this line can get outright outrageous I heard.  We were lucky this time,  waiting less than 45 minutes, after hearing stories of people waiting 1-2 hours. BTW, you can opt to pay an extra fifteen bucks to enter via the "Preferred" line. Nope, I'll wait. After paying for two, which by-the-way set me back a cool $102 bucks, we were escorted to our seats and invited to start anytime we wished. Ah, my dining companion and I decided we would make a "dry run" through the entire buffet to prepare ourselves for the journey ahead of us. After familiarizing ourselves with the setup, we proceeded to get our food. For me, the first stop was the Asian section. Being savvy enough to discipline oneself to realize that there is one big huge buffet ahead and not to fill up on starch here can be difficult here.  There was a nice layout of sushi and other Oriental delicacies. As I made my way around the buffet, I couldn't help but notice the standard items found in most buffets. People were piling their plates with crab legs, which btw were probably snow crab, really skinny. I think I took maybe two small legs. I made my way to the prime rib, which is kinda how I judge a good buffet. I asked for a medium rare piece, but was a little disappointed in it's being dry. There were other meats, but they looked equally dry also. The oysters are good, though, very fresh. They have a nice display of fish in the display case which made for a great photo op!  The Mexican section was pretty good, but I think the star of this buffet had to be the dessert section. Macarons, cakes, pies, cake pops, even mochi ice cream! A dessert lover's paradise! All in all, I have to give this buffet a three star rating because I felt it was a bit overrated and because the meat section wasn't what I expected. The service was fair, although I noticed towards the end of our meal it got slow and our drinks went un-refilled... Would I go back? Probably not, I did want to try the brunch one day though. I think for the money, there are other better choices in Vegas.

It's sad that I didn't give Kyara a try earlier, as it is merely a few minutes from where I live. Japanese Tapas has always been a little intimidating to me, as I don't really know what I'm ordering a lot of the time. I've been missing out -

The food at Kyara is excellent, as far as I can tell. There is time and effort put into a lot of their dishes, along with quality ingredients. I've now tried nearly a dozen of their different items, though there are still many more to be tried. My favorite at this point was a simple chicken and rice bowl called Tori Meshi. Uncomplicated to say the least, but still very delicious.

The Chicken Garlic Ponzu is also truly tasty. It has strong flavors that jump out at you, but is unique enough that it is intriguing. Another excellent dish was the Yuzu Chili Salmon Salad. The salmon is very lightly seared and the texture of the dish is amazing, as well as the presentation.

Some other highlights so far have been the deep fried cheese, which while straight forward, was tasty and had some nice variety of cheese. Their pork belly skewer is average, while the Negi Ma (chicken and green onion)  skewer was very tasty. The sasami (chicken breast) was not as good, as it really was just a piece of chicken on a skewer. I also tried the bacon mochi skewer, which, while interesting, wasn't necessarily that strong of a combination.

I would probably pass on the potato salad, which really was just that, and the Niku Jaga was good but also just seemed like sukiyaki. Still, there are many dishes that I would like to try.

It is definitely worth noting that their desserts are extremely good and priced very cheaply, in my opinion. The Yuzu Fromage Mousse is really quite amazing, as is the Green Tea Waffle, which is enough for 3-4 people and only costs around 5 dollars.

Service here is a little on the slow side, which is really my only knock on the place. A table was ready and we were asked to sit for a good 5 minutes for no real reason other than they had some trouble keeping up with the crowd. I'm not sure if that's a normal situation, or if they are short one or two servers during the busy hours.

All in all, Kyara is a very good and reasonably priced option for those desiring to try a multitude of Japanese-influenced flavors, and I see myself returning here many times for it's convenience to my location as well as its excellent food.

***Some of the dishes I had at Salt of the Earth were a little underwhelming, but there were still good things on the plate and the ribeye and salmon (with the skin on) looked very good***

Salt of the Earth is a popular and relatively new restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Salt of the Earth is in a great space.  There are two floors of dining areas and this combined with the high ceiling really opens up the dining room.  The downstairs dining area is very simple and comfortable, but it is also sleek and modern with a good use of blonde colored wood.  There is a great chalkboard on one wall, which lists up the menu (the menu seems to be very spontaneous with frequent changes).

I really like the upstairs dining area because you get a great view of the downstairs dining area as well as the kitchen as they both cook and plate.

The menu features a lot of good ingredients with several interesting flavor combinations.  I started with the octopus, which was served with white bean puree, chorizo, crisp radishes, crunchy almonds, a cilantro pesto, and oranges.  The octopus was very nicely done.  It was incredibly soft and had a very interesting texture.  The octopus almost shredded like crab or braised meat.

I did not like the chef's choice for the other ingredients on the plate though.  Everything was fine, but I was just not sure if all the flavors went together that well.  The white bean puree was also a little cold.

Next came pork loin with a poached egg, farro and chorizo risotto, green tomato jam, pickled okra, and mustard seeds.  Like the octopus, the cooking of the pork was very good.  The pork was very tender and had a good amount of juiciness.  Once again, I was not a huge fan of all of the garnishes, which kept this dish from from being exceptional.  I also did not like the color of the dish.  Still, the plate definitely showed the talent in the kitchen.

I did happen to see their ribeye special and salmon special and both dishes looked excellent.  The skin on the salmon looked crispy and flavorful while the ribeye had a great thickness and color.  The garnishes there also looked more traditional so those two dishes might have been better representations of what the Salt of the Earth kitchen can put out.

For dessert, I had zucchini bread, which came with crunchy sunflower seed brittle, rhubarb sauce, brown butter powder, and fennel ice cream.  The zucchini bread was good--nothing exceptional but good.  The brown butter powder was interesting and I really liked the fennel ice cream--good, unique flavor and very creamy.  It was not my favorite dessert, but like a lot of the dishes at Salt of the Earth, it really shows the potential of this restaurant.

Service was great--very personable and attentive.  The food came out at a quick pace.

Prices were very reasonable given the high quality ingredients used and the generous portions.

Salt of the Earth shows real potential.  There were definitely elements in each course that I really liked and I think if you order right here, you could probably have a very good meal.  There is definitely good sourcing of quality ingredients, a seasonal approach, talent in the kitchen, and a contemporary approach to the menu.  All of these pluses make Salt of the Earth one to consider for an upscale but still casual dinner in Pittsburgh (while I did not love Salt of the Earth, I would definitely give them another shot if I lived in Pittsburgh).

You can find metered parking on the street.

Appetizer:

Chicken Sausage (Complimentary) - A-Ok (3 Stars) - Quarter sized slice of chicken sausage served with jam and green bean.  If I was blind tested, I would not of known that it was chicken.  It definitely had the texture of a sausage but it was not as tasty as I thought it would be.  The only odd thing is that it was served cold.

Bacon bread and Sourdough (Complimentary) - So they have a guy walk around offering bread and you get a choice of bacon bread and sourdough.  My sister's fianc is a bread fiend so he asked for both.  I did the same not because I love bread, but I was worried I would leave hungry since these fancy places tend to serve small portions.  Trust me, get the bacon bread and it's for obvious reasons.  The bread comes with silky smooth butter and sea salts.

First Course:

Wagyu Beef Tartare - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - Wagyu beef tartare with crush capered aioli, slow poached egg, pickled mustard seeds, and crispy chocolate.  This dish does come with a side of toasted bread.  Tasted great!  The texture reminds me of pate.  The soft, raw beef along with the slow poached egg made it really creamy and went well with the toasted bread.  Very generous portion of tartare--approximately 3" in diameter and 1" thick.

Second Course:

Bacon Wrapped Rabbit - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - Bacon wrapped rabbit with heirloom carrots and roasted garlic ravioli with salsify cream and black truffle.  You get 3 pieces of bacon wrapped rabbit (3" x 1") and 2 ravioli (2" in diameter).  The prominent flavor was the deep smoky bacon.  The rabbit tasted like regular white meat because the bacon was so overwhelming.  The roasted garlic ravioli tasted good as well, however it was bland because the smoky bacon would not leave your mouth.

Third Course:

48 Hour Beef Belly - Woohoo! As good as it gets! (5 Stars) - Beef belly that have been cooked for 48 hours with roasted chestnut puree, Brussel sprouts, and pickled sweet onions.  This beef was totally like butter--soft like it, you slice through it like it, and melted like it in your mouth.  The flavor is to remember because to this day I think about how wonderful it tasted.  Other beef will not be the same after you had this beef belly.  This is the beef you marry--we are soul mates.

Fourth Course:

Warm Apple-Fennel Strudel - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - This is a deconstruction of apple-fennel strudel with hazelnut crumble and brown butter ice cream.  The apple was nicely sweet and warm and worked well with the smooth and creamy brown butter ice cream.  The paper-thin sheet of dough was crispy and flakey and gave the dessert a little added crunch and texture.

Complimentary:

White chocolate dessert shot - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - Our waiter for the evening came by and brought this out stating it was the compliments of the chef.  It was served in a white ceramic shot glass.  It was served warm and was very rich and sweet.  It reminds me of the warm soy bean that is served for Taiwanese breakfasts.  The only main difference there is a spicy kick at the end.  

The service and food is wonderful here.  I definitely recommend Sage as a must try whenever you are in Vegas.  You'll like the ambiance as well--very dim and warm lighting.  Plus, the area is very spacious and you will not be in the space of other diners.  Sage is a Woohoo! As good as it gets!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 39/100

My boyfriend and I were on a mission to try all of the Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas this weekend! BurGR was our second stop of the trip!

BurGR is located literally right inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel. SUPER easy to get to from the lobby! They have this AWESOME glass window display with a metal structure emitting a bunch of flames all over it. It's really interesting and a great storefront display! They also have a bunch of Gordon Ramsay merchandise at the front such as t-shirts, cookbooks, glasses, etc.

We were able to walk right in and get seated immediately. However, a few minutes after we had been sitting at our table, I looked over to the front of the restaurant and there was a HUGE line! We got super lucky that there was nobody there when we entered at around 11:15am.

The decor of this place is super trendy, modern, and basically a sports bar with all of the large screen TVs on all of the walls displaying football and other popular sports. There are also lots of flames everywhere (I'm assuming are related to Hell's Kitchen) and a photo of Gordon Ramsay.

Waiter service was great, as usual. Our waiter immediately came to us and asked if we wanted to take a look at the drink menu, which is an iPad 2 that they give you to look at. It is an interactive menu that has all of the drinks sorted by category (beers, cocktails, red/white wine, etc.), descriptions of each drink, and even photographs. There's also a tab with Gordon Ramsay's biography and photograph, which I thought was pretty cool.

We ordered two waters, a cup of coffee, and then took a look at the menus. The menus were pretty amusing because they, too, had a giant photo of Gordon Ramsay that surprises you when you first order them :P

My bf and I ended up sharing the Shake #4 - creme brulee pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie. THIS WAS AMAZING! I had seen photos of the shakes on Yelp and was curious to try them because I've never had a shake infused with pudding before. Thanks to this shake, I am a HUGE fan of the pudding + shake combination from now on :) So yummy! The two flavors look separated (with creme brulee on top and oreo on the bottom), but surprisingly when you sipped on it, the flavors were combined and complimented each other very well. I would love to come back to try the other 4 combinations!

As for burgers, I ordered the Uber Cheese Burger (fontina cheese + raclette cheese + goat cheese), and my boyfriend got the American burger (american cheese + butter lettuce + tomato + pickle + onion). As a HUGE cheese lover, my burger was absolutely PERFECT for me! It was literally just the patty + 3 types of cheese, which was exactly what I wanted. My bf nearly inhaled his American burger and said it was super good. We unfortunately decided to skip out on getting fries because we didn't have the appetite to eat that much food! I would definitely like to come back to try the truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries.

When we received our bill, we were given an iPod that had a little survey/questionnaire for us to answer based on our dining experience at BurGR. The Yelp Elite in me naturally reached for this and began answering the questions like crazy :P I thought it was pretty cool how much they integrated the use of iPads and iPods at their restaurant!

Overall, 5 stars for a really trendy, hip atmosphere, great service, and delicious food! I would love to come back during my next visit to Vegas! :)

You're probably asking yourself, what in the world does "Sekong by Night" mean? Well, the answer is, oooh just some classic, popular Cambodian song title that the owner is obsessed over. :)

As previously mentioned by another fellow Yelper, Sekong does exude charm.  In fact, most of the artistic, decorative items that is seen in the dining room is a straight import from mainland Cambodia (ie. table cloths, paintings, sculptures, and other artworks).  Obviously, the owner wanted to not only deliver authenticity from a cuisine standpoint but also historically and culturally.  They did a magnificent job in creating a nice visual display to sort of educate first time consumers of Khmer cuisine.

To get an idea of what Khmer dishes are like, I always say they're a cousin to Vietnamese and Thai cuisine.  Although, I think they just share ideas or possibly just steal from one another.

One prime example of idea sharing that you might find in a Vietnamese menu is the Luc Lac.  And actually, this creation was French inspired.  It's basically steak meat that has been cut into cubes and sauted to a tender perfection fused with caramelized onions and garlic to give a richer taste.  The dish usually comes with a side of white rice and a fresh salad that has been lightly soaked in a sweet, citrus, vinagry dressing.  Its fantastic when done right!  In fact, I really enjoy Sekong's version! Its a must try! [Recommend]

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ?select=yeZLfWYl0CMkhNM9T73i_w

Sekong also serves tasty sandwiches like the Vietnamese Banh Mi.  I have only tried their grilled beef.  From what I recollect tasting, it was meat marinated in a savory, lemon grass.  The baguette was very toasty and had a soft interior while the pickled veggies were fresh tasting. [Recommend]

And the cultural similarity theme continues! They also serve a crispy crepe-like dish that encompasses pork, shrimp and bean sprouts called, Baynchaiv, traditionally a finger food.  You take your lettuce and create a wrap and dip it into home made fish sauce. [Recommend]

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kBJfBVaXJtPEKLTov1hJdQ?select=dmpDwgYQUk68LqY3tGx3fw

Loat Cha, my other go-to dish, are these 1-inch round rice noodles drenched lightly in soy sauce and then pan fried served with fresh, crispy bean sprouts, green onions, and sliced beef topped with one egg.  [Recommend]

Now, the chicken wings with a side of rice is quite tasty.  Last time I ordered one, the chicken came out nicely crisped with a hint of peking flavor, which is a notorious marinade for Chinese roast ducks.

As for snacks and specialty drinks, I've had their tempura sweet potato and banana, and grass jelly drink.  All were excellent.  The tempura snacks came out super crispy with a fresh tasting interior.  If you are unfamiliar with grass jelly, it is basically semi-bland jello with a slightly sweet, grassy flavor, but in creating a refreshing drink, jello are cut up into tiny cubes while adding ice, sugar and honey.

The one item that has bothered me for awhile now is the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup, also the counter to Vietnamese Pho.  The only reason why I have hesitated for this long is, admittedly, due to the exotic-ness (ie. pork liver, heart, tripes, etc).  As soon as I can grow a third ball, I will attempt it! Just kidding, I will eventually.

The menu is not as large but being new to the food scene, they are looking to start off small and expand as business blossom.  

By now, you may have already read about the lengthy wait, awkward location, and whatever shenanigans have you not, they are still working out the kinks and are continually listening to feed backs.  

Pricing is very reasonable and competitive with the other Southeastern Asian power houses in the Valley [$5 - 10 range].  I will continue to be a regular here and add more updates as I try more items.

I didn't have such a great experience at the Sugar Factory inside the Paris, so when I found out this is where we would be meeting up for a birthday dinner, I was a bit bummed. I hadn't been to this newer location at Town Square though and only had dessert and drinks at the Paris location, so trying actual food from Sugar Factory I had a open mind for. Walking in they have candy and lollipops for sale, but they have price tags on them that are way overpriced. I couldn't ever see spending what they are charging for a sucker that spins. 

Our server, Manolo was great. He checked on us often and seemed genuine, not pushy trying to get us to order apps, drinks, merchandise, etc. He just was the type of server you wish you always had when eating out. The place was packed inside and even the tables outside the restaurant were filled, but the servers did a great job at taking care of everybody. 

I ordered a "S'mores Martini" priced at $14 and was a bit disappointed. Sure it looked cute and tasted alright, but it tasted more like candy than anything I would catch a buzz off. My hubby's Reese's drink was much more tasty. Priced also at $14 I had a "Garbage Bowl Salad" for dinner and substituted the vinaigrette that comes on it for ranch dressing. The salad had lettuce, pepperoni, salami, cucumbers, tomato, avocado, mozzarella and provolone. The menu said it also came with croutons, but what a bummer they weren't on the salad! There was enough other stuff so it worked out. The salad was really good. I liked the crisp, fresh lettuce and the amount of ripe delicious avocados they put in it. The bottom was filled with salami and pepperoni as well. I kept eating and eating and still there was salad left! 

The key with Sugar Factory is to come here when it's HH or with some type of deal/coupon. The drinks and much of the menu is just way too overpriced and coming here and paying full price will more than likely leave not only a dent in your wallet, but will probably leave you feeling like not ever coming back. Currently there is a yelp check-in offer for $15 that gets you $25 (not valid Fridays & Saturdays) and they have a groupon right now for this location where you can pick from a few different deals depending on the size of your party. Sugar Factory also has different deals depending on the day. The HH runs Mon - Fri from 3 pm - 6 pm where you can get BOGO cocktails and half off appetizers, pizzas and burgers. If you are coming here to drink anyway then coming here when it's better priced makes more sense.

P.S. The cel reception in here is no good! I had no signal most of my visit and when I did it was just 1 bar. Everyone at my table had this same issue.

P.S.S. The music is TOO LOUD! It's hard to have a conversation with people sitting next to you because the music is annoyingly loud.

I'm not planning to come back, but wouldn't say no if someone else wanted to go.

I've visited twice now with mixed experiences. I thought the food was as expected from a Fox restaurant. Not exactly to die for, but definitely better than a Chili's. My aversion to loving this spot is the menu prices and the extreme wait during a lunch "hour", and I use the term hour loosely there.

Had I not been out to lunch with my boss already, I would have likely had a stern "talking to" when I got back to the office two hours later. We had six people at our table and took about five or so minutes to peruse the menu. The staff was quick to deliver our drinks, but four salads, a burger, a meatloaf and 50 minutes later meant my lunch hour turned into a lunch two hour. I didn't exactly expect a ten minute turn around on our food; but really, almost an hour to deliver these dishes is seriously extreme. Even though my boss was with me, by the end of our lunch I was itching to get back to the office as to not waste any more time.

The burger I ordered was on the menu at $12, not exactly cheap to begin with. The waitress asked if I would like fries or a salad with it, but I asked if there was a vegetable I could have instead and she was happy to bring it out with asparagus. Regrettably, she failed to mention an added charge to make that swap from spuds to veg. My $12 burger, now $18 after fees, tax, and tip, is why I usually skip lunches during the week and bring in my own from home. :-(

I did; however, like the food itself, the company, the location, and the waitress was nice enough as well as apologetic about the long wait. I like the LARGE outdoor patio complete with shuffle board, corn hole, ping pong, and foosball. Seems like it could be a fun place to come for drinks in the evening hours with a couple of work buddies.

On my previous visit, I had the meatloaf, the meatloaf itself was good - and I did really enjoy the green beans, but not awesome and not really worth the price IMO, especially when adorn with what can only be described as fancy ketchup, really, ketchup on a $16 meatloaf (after tax-tip). Honestly, I feel the food on the menu is priced about 20% too high for most of the items. I wouldn't mind returning for happy hour, but outside of that, I'll likely just stick to "grabbing a drink" or two with friends if I'm ever back.

I noticed after this visit just how much the price has changed when it comes to a brunch buffet. Generally brunch costs more than breakfast, lunch or dinner, but not here at the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station. Brunch on Sunday runs around $9.99 (same price for dinner during the week) with a players card. After being seated I noticed how dirty the highchair was that my nephew was in. I'm talking all sorts of food on either side of it. I cleaned it up with some wipes his mom had with her, but this highchair looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. Our server was great and checked on us often. Even with the big group we had at our table she kept the dishes cleared and brought us refills without us ever having to ask. 

They brunch buffet has the usual stuff. Different breakfast and lunch option at the same time. I walked by the pizza as it was coming out so I figured that was a good time to get some of that. It tasted OK, but definitely tasted like a frozen pizza that was made. They do have a pizza oven right there and you can watch it cook, but it wasn't anything I'd ever go out of my way for. The bacon was hard and tasted microwaved. Scrambled eggs weren't bad or the mini waffle I had. The hash browns were a soggy mess with some burnt crispy parts. I did enjoy the mac & cheese even if it tasted like Kraft deluxe. The breakfast sausage looked good, but tasted nasty. I brought back an assortment of desserts for our table to try and they were terrible! All of the pastries were hard which was a disappointment. I will say that the salad bar had a lot of options including fresh fruit and it all looked good. I enjoyed what I had from the salad bar area much more than anywhere else at the buffet. This buffet could use many changes and isn't really worth it until then in my opinion. 

Kids 2 and under are free.

While the boys make it a golf day, the ladies spa away...at least that was the plan. This was my first time visiting Fort McDowell and I must say that for being a Radisson, the grounds were nicer then I would have expected. The pool is spacious, the water is ice cold (which is perfect on a hot day), the cocktails are very reasonably priced (around $6.50) and the staff is friendly. However, sadly, the spa was anything but a "day spa." 

Spa days are my weakness. For me, taking a spa day is the perfect escape from reality and a way for me to go on vacation without the costs of flights and accommodations. I enjoy spa days because I can arrive early and enjoy the amenities. I like to check in with the aroma of spa scents welcoming me and spa music calming the atmosphere. I like to enjoy the woman's locker room with amenities like a personal locker, jacuzzi, showers, sweet smelling products, etc. I also like to sit in a calming waiting room and clear my mind before my service. Did I experience any of this at the Radisson's "day spa?" Sadly, I didn't experience one aspect of this. Instead, this is what I experienced...

I entered the Radisson and followed the signs to the "spa." I entered the room that claimed to be the spa and instead found myself in a meeting room converted into a small gym (similar to those found in corporate motels). I looked around for the spa entrance and didn't see anything. Finally, I saw a small sign on a cabinet that said to check in to the spa at the gift shop. I walked down the hallway to a gift shop where the lady working the counter checked me into the spa. I asked about a ladies' locker room but learned that one didn't exist and instead, I was given a key for a "locker" that was against the wall of the mini gym. I came to the spa planning on working out, getting my massage, using the amenities and ending the day at the pool. Instead, I sat on a chair in the mini gym while waiting for my service. As it turns out, the spa is actually three rooms off of the mini gym. The spa doesn't have a ladies' locker room, a proper waiting area or any feeling of a spa at all. The workout didn't happen because the gym only had two treadmills and both were being used. Instead of changing in a ladies' locker room, I had to take my bag into the solo bathroom in the gym to change into my suit. My friend and I both booked massages for the day but they had to be an hour apart. Now I know why. It's because they only have one massage therapist. I didn't see any other treatments going on during my visit either. 

Now, my experience is no fault of the massage therapist's. She was professional, nice and provided a nice massage. The massage therapist mentioned that I was not very relaxed during my massage and I wanted to comment back that it's very hard to relax when you're getting a massage in a random room off the hotel gym with the hotel hallway on the other side of the wall. The icing on the cake was when a group of people (maybe on a tour?) walked in on my massage. Yes, they walked into my massage room right smack in the middle of my massage. It was one of the most awkward moments of my life. Again, the massage therapist was wonderful and I feel bad that she has to be associated with this disappointing spa experience. 

Don't be fooled by the long menu listing a variety of treatments. All will be done in a maximum of three small rooms off the gym. There is no sense of spa here and if I could have canceled my massage upon arrival, I would have. This shouldn't be considered a "day spa." If they are going to promote anything, they should say that offer "spa services" within the hotel, but there was nothing that fell within the "day spa" category during my experience. It doesn't take a lot to please me, but when I'm spending a decent amount of money on a spa day, I expect a spa day. 

If you visit this hotel, stay the night and enjoy the pool and renowned golf course, but think twice before booking a spa day here.

Our last meal before we headed home from our week long stay in Las Vegas. After a week, we were looking for something other than a buffet. My wife found this place and wow, what a gem it was. It's way south of the Strip, but it's worth the drive. 

Here's the rundown:
French Pressed Coffee - it's a long drive, so I needed a good cup of Joe. What a cup!! First off, they use Illy coffee (Italian espresso coffee bean, my favorite) It comes in a big French press container (good for at least 3+ cups of coffee, good for at least 2 persons) and a sand glass timer to determine how strong you like it (cute touch). Talk about a good start to your meal, if you're a coffee drinker, you've got to try this. Great Coffee. 

Pot of Bread - literally a bread baked in a small terre cotta pot (another cute touch). The top is brushed with cinnamon sugar and is very good. This is one of your bread choices w/ your breakfast meal (other choices are toast or biscuit) pot of bread would be my recommendation. It's unique and a good eats. 

Ultimate Steak & Eggs - 8 oz ribeye steak and two eggs (there is an option for 3 eggs)  with hash brown. My steak was cooked medium rare (as requested). It's on the thin side but was very delicious. 

Crispy Chicken Breast & Waffles - this was my wife's order. But this will be my order next time. OMG. The best chicken & waffles I've ever tasted. Yes, better than Roscoe's C & W. I prefer dark meat, but their crispy chicken breast was incredible. The chicken was indeed very crispy outside, but the breast was so moist and soft inside. Tons of flavor, delicious!!  And the waffle was so so good. Yum yum yum. The best period. A MUST ORDER. 

Service was super friendly and helpful, thanks Lisa! On this day, all the waitresses were dressed in pajamas (yes another cute touch)

Info: they are only open for breakfast & lunch. They close at 3 pm. 

If you're sick of the buffet and want something different and really good, come here. You won't regret it. 

I'm rating this a 5 star plus
I'll definitely be back.

I remember when a couple of other businesses occupied this location that Weiss Deli is at so I was skeptical about if Weiss was like them or not. The reviews and delicious pictures on yelp got my to finally try this Jewish deli. It is tucked in the corner of a shopping center. They have a decent amount of tables and chairs outside if eating outdoors is your thing. Inside is clean, but the decor is dated. The booth I sat at had gashes in the seat. The inside isn't very big so I imagine trying to eat here on the weekend is a zoo. When you walk inside towards the left they have bagels & pastries for sale. I took a look but the case was empty and I was told by our server that they sell out quick in the mornings. They have a board when you enter that tells you what specials are going on that day.

They have a section on the menu that says "not so hungry" for those feeling like they can't tackle a whole sandwich themselves. You get 1/2 of a sandwich (your choice from the sandwich station area on the menu) and your choice of either a cup of soup, fries, coleslaw,  potato salad or fresh fruit on the side. I decided to order this priced at $9.95 and I can assure you that you do need to be hungry unlike the menu claims because the portions are generous. I decided to try the "Chicken Noodle Soup" and it was the best I have e-v-e-r had in my life! It was hardly a cup like the menu suggests and was filling all by itself. I could just sip on the broth for days! The soup had a couple bagel chips on the side that had such a nice garlic flavor. For my sandwich I went with the "Roast Turkey" on challah bread. The 1/2 sandwich was so big that I had to cut it in half just to eat it. The bread was seriously delicious!  I could only eat a portion of my sandwich and took the rest home for later. My hubby ordered a "Pastrami Burger" priced at $9.95 that came with a side of fries. He said the pastrami had good flavor. 

I saw on the menu they offer catering. 

The next time I stop in I will be trying out something from their tasty looking breakfast menu. I would stop in when working on this side of town just to get some of the soup to-go!

I shouldn't give this place a two because the description says, "Meh.  I've experienced better."  Well, I haven't experienced better because this is my only experience with a male strip club.  

I should give this place a big fat ZERO because I'm pretty sure the bartender roofied me.  

Why do I think he roofied me?  Let me tell you.  

A friend of mine had her bachelorette party in Vegas and her maid of honor thought up this brilliant idea of making us all wear corsets- bridesmaids/friends in black and the bride in white.  Well, I'm rather busty, but luckily I saw my drunken future and prepared for the inevitable.  More about this later. 

So, we make The Olympic Garden our first stop and right away the guys bombard us.  They cornered us individually so that we couldn't consult on who everyone was buying lap dances for, and thus we all bought multiple lap dances for the same people.  This is when I learned that lap dances make me uncomfortable, especially if I haven't even had a damn drink yet.  I actually made the poor guy so uncomfortable he asked me if I was feeling ok.  I just don't find guys who kiss their own biceps while gyrating on top of me sexy... I find it funny and maybe a little sad, but not sexy.  

After I was dance raped, I made my way to the bar where I recognized the bartender.  My dad owned a bar and I knew this guy had totally worked for him (Note to self- my dad must be a real asshole if this guy did indeed roofie me [sorry daddy, but I'm sure you stopped reading at dance rape if for some reason you stumbled upon this review] and also, this is a small, small world).  So, I asked the guy and after finding out who I was he started pouring me shots.  I had about three the entire time we where there.  Trust me, I can handle three shots and this was all I had to drink for the rest of the night.  Not only that, but he was the only person who came in contact with these shots other than my mouth.  

This is where my memory gets fuzzy and eventually it just goes dark, but before I forget who I am I decide it'd be fun to call home and tell my dear old dad who I ran into.  Thank God my brother answered and screened the call.  I don't even know what I said to him, but he told me I was pretty out of it.  Last memory from here on out is an image of the limo pulling up and my friends piling in. 

The next day.  I wake up in my hotel room with a start.  I have no idea where I am at first.  I have no idea how I got there and I have no idea how I got out of the corset from last night.  This is where my friends and my boyfriend at the time fill me in.  Luckily, he just happened to be there for the bachelor party, but unfortunately my near death state forced him to miss out on all the stripper action.  Haha, sucker.  

So, apparently I was completely gone like I'd never been before.  I fell down multiple times in public places and even knocked a friend into an open trash can.  It was so bad that a security guy at MGM Grand offered me a wheelchair, but my friends were afraid he was just some random guy trying to molest me so they continued to lug me around.  I had horrible bruises all over my body the next day to prove just how embarrassing this all must have been.  Here is where my good planning for a drunken future comes in.  I knew that my corset had a tendency to slip, so I wore a lace cami underneath just in case I got too drunk to pay attention to wardrobe malfunctions.  This proved rather smart because all the falling down pulled my corset right off of you know what.  If I hadn't been wearing that cami I would have looked like I was dressed for a topless review. 

I also puked in a cab at some point.  The cab driver started yelling in another language and a girl I barley knew caught my freakin' throw up in her hands.  IN HER HANDS! 

Once they got me to the room, I was completely out.  I mean, dead to the world.  Well, until I guess one girl got on my nerves enough to wake me out of my stupor.  My friends told me she was complaining about everyone wanting to wait around a bit to make sure I was okay.  So, I popped my head up long enough to say, "Be cool, bitch."  That was the last thing I would do or say until the morning.

My poor boyfriend got wind of the state I was in and said I looked like a dead person when he went up to check on me.  He missed out on the rest of the night for fear I would stop breathing.  Apparently, I was completely non-responsive.  

The next day, I wanted to kill myself.  I have never felt a hangover like that in my entire life.  It was HORRIBLE.  

In conclusion, I have no way of knowing what was in those drinks.  All I know is that no amount of binge drinking ever rendered me completely unconscious and without memory of an entire night worth of events.  Everything after leaving the strip club is like a dark hole in my memory- it's just blank, as if the rest of the night didn't even exist.

P.S.  I highly identified with The Hangover... for obvious reasons.

This is my first visit to the new hotel and casino.  On my way from work to the hotel, I called up reservations to ask what my dining options were at this time of the night (arriving at 8:30p) and was told that I had Ditka's (steakhouse), the 24/7 Cafe, and the food court, where I could find Panda Express, Fat Burger, and Los Reyes de la Torta.  As soon as I heard "Los Reyes," I knew where I would go for dinner.  :)

After studying the three menu boards overhead (a shorter list of their regular selection of tortas, aka sandwiches, and tacos) and concentrating on the tortas board, I considered two options: Cubana and the Carne Asada.  I ordered the Cubana (ham, sliced roasted pork loin, melted cheese, jalapenos, onions, and minus the avocado, and served with refried beans) since that was what grabbed my attention the most.  I was told my wait would be around 10 minutes, so I went to the Players Club to get a reprint of my card, should I ever get the itch to gamble during my stay.  (I found out the unused free slot play I'd received when I first applied for my card years ago was only good for the first 24 hours, so I was not able to get a re-issue of that free play- darn!  However, if you play nice, you can always get something comped.  :)  Thank you, Patrick!)  After getting a new copy of my card, I made a quick stop at the Square Bar for a glass of wine, and then headed to LR to retrieve my to-go order**.

A styrofoam box with my name on it was waiting for me, and while I dropped off my claim ticket, I asked where I'd find the utensils and was told it was at the cubicle next to me (couldn't see it because I was approaching the pick-up section from the left and the divider kept me from seeing the utensils, condiments, wet naps, and napkins, which were to my right).  The tables are cafeteria-style, so just grab one that looks clean.  This sandwich, which came with ridged potato chips, was HUGE!  I expected refried beans goop, but these were actually whole beans scooped onto the bottom of the sandwich, upon which sliced ham, white cheese, sliced pork, tomatoes, sauteed seasoned onions, and jalapeos were added.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-reyes-de-la-torta-laveen?select=XmayEHOPKoQE1L20R-H1jQ#XmayEHOPKoQE1L20R-H1jQ  The telera roll was toasted and buttered- so delicious!  It was all I could do not to eat the whole thing, and I am accustomed to eating light at every meal.  I ate so much that I don't think I'll need to eat breakfast before heading for my morning swim... With Dunkin' Donuts coffee and Munchkins to tempt me, however, I may just have to force myself to have a few bites!  ;)

**  I should've just gone with "dining in" option, since I knew that I didn't have a refrigerator in my room.  However, I had planned to look for a bar to order a drink, since LR didn't serve alcoholic beverages, and I didn't want to leave my food open to the elements.  Thank goodness I went with the boxed option, since there are flies in the cafeteria-- disgusting!

I visited last night at around 6:45.  Because I was meeting my dining companion here at 7, I decided to sit at the bar and take advantage of happy hour.  I was impressed by the long list of $2 beers, which included Woodchuck Amber hard cider, which I ordered.  Happy hour here seems quite popular--the bar was almost full at the time that I arrived, and was completely full by the time my dining companion arrived--and given the selection and discount, I can certainly understand the attraction!

Once my dining companion arrived, we got a table.  Having heard good things about the fried cauliflower patties, we decided to get an order of them to share.  (This worked out nicely, since one order comprises 4 patties.)  They were quite nice, esp. with the lemon aioli sauce drizzled on them, tasting similar to potato patties.  Cauliflower patties aren't an item that would normally hold a huge appeal to me, but I'd definitely recommend them!

For my entree, I ordered the turkey burger, since I'd also heard good things about it, and my dining companion ordered the Social (beef) burger.  Based on other reviews, I was expecting a mind-blowingly delicious turkey burger.  Alas, this was not the case.  Paradoxically, the turkey patty and bun were extremely dry, whereas the toppings were overly moist.  As I ate the burger, the far end became soggier and soggier, to the point that I found it inedible, only finishing 2/3 of it.  The burger wasn't nearly as flavorful as I was hoping, either--I could barely taste the gouda cheese, and the lettuce and tomatoes didn't add much to it in terms of flavor, either.  In general, the ingredients struck me as low quality.

I ordered the cheesy tomato soup as a side, and it wasn't bad--it was thicker and creamier than Campbell's, though it wasn't quite as cheesy as I would have hoped, and I'm not sure how I feel about the toasted bready thing floating in it.  The burgers came with fresh cut fries, which was a nice touch, but they were nothing too special.

Aside from the food, service was pretty lackluster, with our waitress making minimal conversation, etc.--although she did keep our water glasses filled, which we appreciated.  As for the ambiance, I'd describe it as rather loud and somewhat boisterous--which I suppose is to be expected for a place called Social.  People were engaging in some fun activities, such as ping pong and darts, which was cool to watch.

Overall, with the exception of the cauliflower patties, I wasn't very impressed with the food at Social.  (I found out later that Social is owned by the same group that owns Shady Grove, for which I have similar feelings.)  If you want a solid turkey burger, I'd recommend checking out BRGR nearby. I'd consider returning for happy hour, but would definitely go elsewhere for dinner.

Wow!  Now that I've been to Rose.Rabbit.Lie, I understand how the whole thing fits together and works.  I had a free ticket for the show last night and I made a dinner reservation, too.  The website said they were fully booked, but when I called the Cosmopolitan, she made a reservation for me.

I got my ticket at the box office on the second floor and went to the Rose.Rabbit.Lie entrance at 6 PM for my reservation.  There was a couple in line ahead of me.  They weren't yet open.  There's a lot of security and ear pieces in this area across from the Wicked Spoon buffet.  When they opened, the woman asked me if I wanted a table or to sit at a bar.  Since I was alone, I told her the bar.  She asked which one I wanted to go to and I couldn't answer.  I let her choose and she took me to the Library Bar.

There are several rooms behind closed doors after you enter the main door.  On the left was the Library, a small room with about 8 tables and 8 or so seats at the bar.  I took the end seat and I was so glad this was where I was.  We could hear the music from next door--it turned out to be the Music Room--and the bartender who waited on me was Anthony!  He was perfect--knowledgable about the menu and he made some great recommendations to me.  

Most of the dishes are tapas style.  I ordered the Brussels sprouts with crispy chicken skin. Manchego cheese and Spanish paprika.  I also ordered Tte de Cochon--pig head with a slow cooked egg.  The pig head was cooked and the meat was seasoned and formed into a small rectangle.  It was lightly battered with panko breadcrumbs and lightly fried.  Served with a soft poached egg, it was delightful.  Breaking the egg and letting it run over the pork was so very good!  The Brussels sprouts were wonderful!  I could not have had two better recommendations!

I chose desert on my own.  I ordered the butterscotch pudding with a chocolate and hazelnut "stone".  The dessert was a perfect ending to the meal.  The butterscotch was salted and the "stone" was very tasty!

Service was excellent and sitting at the bar was a show in itself.  Anthony showed me and the gentleman seated next to me the 3 kinds of special ice cubes they make for Rose.Rabbit.Lie.  Quite interesting and creative.

From here, I was shown to the Music Room where I listened to a 5 piece combo play.  There was a singer who walked on the bar in the Music Room.  One of the entertainer/ushers--a friend of mine--came in to work.  I had no idea he had gotten a job here.  He told me that we'd be shown into the Ballroom (another place to eat and drink) and then we'd go to the showroom.  The combo and the singers went into the Ballroom and then the doors were opened to the Showroom.  

The show is called Vegas Nocturne and although the website lists it as 70 minutes, it's more like 95 minutes in length.  There are two types of chairs and I got seated in a row that had the hard folding chairs.

The show is a milder version of its cousin, Absinthe.  The acts are lower key in a way because of the low ceiling.  The acts are very good, the comedy is quite funny, and it was a perfect end for my evening.  Katy Perry was in the audience.

This was a wonderful evening and I'm so glad I went.  I'm not sure I'd pay the full price for the show.  It's a bit steep considering the other entertainment available on the Strip but as part of an entire evening at Rose.Rabbit.Lie, it was just perfect!

Being half Japanese & growing up in Japan I'm pretty picky when it comes to sushi or any Japanese restaurant. Sushi on Rainbow did not disappoint. My friends indulged in my cravings and agreed to eat sushi. Not familiar with any sushi places in Vegas and one of the rare moments my friends have EVER asked me to jump on Yelp & find a place, I was stoked! Usually when I whip out my phone and start yelping it's amongst groans and moans from them. "Emy put the phone down!" "Seriously dude, do you have to yelp everything???" Sometimes I would Yelp while walking and a few times almost face planted into something. Though my friends were annoyed with my constant Yelping, they were nice enough to guide me while I was walking and typing. So yea, I was pretty happy they were turning to YELP for suggestions. 

This was my moment to either shine or worse - tank. Sushi on Rainbow was close to where we were at and the Yelp reviews were pretty good so I threw caution to the wind and announced, "I found the perfect place!". Fingers crossed and a silent prayer to the Yelp gods, we walk into SOR and was immediately greeted with "irrashaimase" in the right pronunciation...yeeesss, there is a Yelp god! 

It was AYCE sushi and other Japanese dishes such as tempura, fried oysters, curry rice, katsu etc. As some Yelpers have pointed out there is an hour time limit but this is common in Japan of any AYCE restaurant so this was not a big deal to me. I forgot how much it was per person but I did upload a couple of pics here that have the pricing on it. We all def ate and drank more than our money's worth in the allotted time.

The sushi we ordered came out relatively quickly and so did the non-sushi items. I was amazed at all the things they offer for AYCE! It was delish! The night we were there, beer, sake and soft drinks were also included in the AYCE eat. After establishing who the DD was (gotta be responsible ppl) we all ordered sake.  

The sushi chef's were very friendly and personable so were the waitresses. The sushi chefs would call out from time to time to ask us how we were doing. Like I said, very friendly. One of the waitresses was from my hometown in Japan and lived about 10 mins from me. It was fun talking to her in Japanese especially since my friends hardly ever hear me speak it. So yea, I got to bust out my Japanese...lol. 

Ok getting side tracked. I can't remember everything we ordered but the sushi was very fresh. I always start with hamachi (don't know what it's called in English) and it was very good. Salmon and maguro followed. Plus spicy tuna and a few speciality rolls. Also ordered the shrimp tempura, fried oysters and tonkatsu (pork cutlet). Yes, I'm a little oinker! 

One hour was plenty of time for us to fill our bellies on endless sushi and sake. Like I mentioned we hardly had to wait and the restaurant was a bit busy. The sushi counter was full when we got there and there were 3 tables that were occupied. The 2 sushi chefs both from Japan, were making the sushi and the cooks in the back were making the other dishes, 

This will be MUST GO TO restaurant every time I go to Vegas. Oh and btw, one of the sushi chefs was wearing a UH cap and told me they get lots of customers from Hawaii. 

As for converting my friends to Yelp that's another issue lol. I did score some big points on this once. (Fist pump!) Oh wait, I did convert one person, who just set up an account!

If you're looking for authentic Japanese sushi & food this place is the place to go. I've been to other Japanese restaurants in Vegas that were highly recommended by locals only to be disappointed that it wasn't authentic. I mean come on, shrimp tempura is not panko crusted shrimp...that's called shrimp fry. 

So glad I found this place thanks to Yelp. 1 point Emy / 0 points friends who I will eventually convert to becoming Yelpers. Bwuahahaha

We dropped into this Las Vegas hot spot prior to going to a show to grab a quick bite and catch up on the sports news for the day.  For the latter you'll need to sit at the bar which is exactly what we did.  Their beer and wine list is extensive as are the number of tap options at the bar.  I went for a bottled brew instead selecting one of my favorite tangerine ales instead of trying something new.

Their menu features appetizers, tiny buns which come two per order, big buns and milkshakes galore including a long list of boozed-up ones.  I was feeling a bit shaky, but my short supply of lactose intolerance tablets on myself made me put aside that idea of having the shakes for the night.  I stuck with my Lost Coast ale.

Pork belly buns, mini lobster rolls and tiny Chicago dogs seemed like popular picks in the Tiny Buns section, but I wanted something more substantial so I picked out the Korean "Bull"Gogi burger from the Big Buns section.  This was a burger glazed in a sweet soy sauce, topped with kimchee slaw, slathered with chili mayo and topped off with a fried egg.  The burgers come with seasoned skinny fries or steak fries.

Their kitchen works fast here as a short wait later we were already chowing down.  My burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=fBXXyjMoAlX3NvotKQLd-A) sat in a pool of glaze and it appeared the yolk on my fried egg was runny.  For a split second I considered picking up the knife and fork, but who doesn't eat with their hands while sitting at the bar?  On my first bite the yolk burst out of its egg white home and coated my face and fingers in hot yolky heaven.  There was no turning back at that point; I was going to finish this burger using my hands even if the entire thing fell apart.  It didn't by the way as the soft bun was one of the sturdiest I've ever held in my hand even soaked in with burger juices, sweet glaze and egg yolk.

The burger itself I'm thinking maybe a half pound of quality beef was cooked to a perfect medium and bursting with juice.  Considering how many ingredients were added to this burger the beef really stood out as that was the main component I kept tasting.  The kimchee slaw was nice and crunchy, but the chili mayo really provided no kick to the overall flavor of the burger.

My seasoned steak fries while generous in portion size were a bit too salty for me.  I loved my burger though just as my friends loved their mini pork belly buns and mini hot dogs.

La Pizza, or also known as JJ's Pizza Window, is located inside the Paris Hotel & Casino. It is connected to JJ's Boulangerie. I was waiting for hubby to get finished at a store and decided to try a slice of pizza from here. You order from the walk-up window and they sell pizza by the slice. The cashier was very friendly and told me that fresh pizza was just coming out of the oven. She also said they use san marzano tomatoes in their pizza sauce. I just ordered a simple slice of "Cheese Pizza" priced at $4 before tax. It was a decent size slice. Next to the walk-up window there is a small seating area with about 4 tables that have 2 chairs at each table. The pizza slice was pretty good. I did have to dab some grease off of the top with a napkin, but that was just my preference, it wasn't too overly greasy. The crust was crisp and the pizza was nice and hot. I think next time I will get a slice with toppings and see how that is. I also will ask for a side of sauce since I didn't taste too much of it on the pizza and I usually enjoy dipping my pizza in sauce anyway. I know in the picture I posted it looks like there was a decent amount of sauce, but I really couldn't taste it. The pizza slice is 3.5 stars for me. I give a full 4 stars total because the pizza was edible and didn't taste bad (it just didn't *wow* me), the cashier was friendly and I enjoyed sitting at one of their outside tables by myself having a quick slice and tourist-watching. 

The daily special (probably everyday) is 1 slice of pizza, chips and a drink for $6.99, but I had a drink already so just the slice would do for me today. If you are passing through this is a nice place to grab a quick bite to eat.

Scale of 1-10 (single visit):
6 Food
8 *Drinks*
5 Service
10 Atmosphere
4 Value

Holy shit, thank god I had a Groupon for this one.
As such, note that the above 2-star rating is *generous*.

To start off on the good: The space is really really cute & comfortable.  The patio has lights and trellised flowers and the indoors is perfectly lit and just feels good.  The drinks were also really tasty, and the service was pleasant.

However, despite all the pleasantness in the world, competence wasn't on the menu last night.  Among other things, i expect servers to a) take my order correctly, and b) know what menu items they are out of.

Well, no such luck.

Strike 1: Our server had to go check with the bar to see which "winter drinks" they were no longer making.  It was 7:30pm.  Do that before your shift starts, or maybe mgmt should update the menus, even if it's just with a sharpie.

Strike 2: He almost brought me the wrong drink.  The only reason he didn't is because of the extra trip he made to tell us which drinks were actually available.  "Okay, so I'll go put in your X, and your Y [from his first trip] is in as well." -- "Um, I ordered a Z." -- "Oh, I'll go change that."

Strike 3: When the appetizer came out, it didn't have the fried egg on top like we ordered.  It looked much different than I expected (which isn't a bad thing) so once I realized it was eggless, the food runner was gone, and 3 minutes passed and no sight of our server, so we just ate it.  He apologized and didn't charge us for the egg, which I don't expect took much effort because I doubt it was ever rung in in the first place.

Strike 4: After taking our food order, he returned to the table to tell my girlfriend that they were out of the Fettuccine.  For the love of god, know that shit *AT* the table!!  This turned out to be a problem, because there aren't many vegetarian options on their menu.

Which leads me to the food.  Why are there so few veggie options?  I'm not a veggie, but you should have a healthy selection of veggie options.  Some people need them, and some people just want them.  After getting my food, I was also amazed at how underwhelming it was considering the price.  People used to bitch that PastaBar was overpriced for what they got.  Have they ever been to Caffe Boa?  Caffe Boa's food was less filling, less flavorful, and more expensive than PastaBar's ever was.

The only exception was dessert: a Tangelo & Honey Twinkie.  This tasted excellent... but was still an astounding $9.

I was hoping that Caffe Boa would give me another reason to go to Mill, which I enjoy the liveliness of, but unfortunately not.  Thank god I had that Groupon....

This ranks high on one of the most amazing and unusual culinary adventures that I've ever had.

A friend tipped me off that this chicken place was opening this week.  I so wanted to go, but I had another gig, and figured that I'd miss out.  As it so happened, said gig ended just early enough for me to go right before closing, so the missus and I hightailed it to ensure that we got there before closing.

Oh yes, there was a line.

And so we waited.  And waited.  However, the staff came out and started giving away free cornbread.  I'm... just not a big cornbread fan, but I figured "Why not", and bit into it.

o_O

It was amazing.  Super sweet, like cake.  I ate two pieces while the line trudged on.

As we got closer to the door, another staff member came out and started handing out copies of Flav's autobiography.  And now I had something to read while waiting.  People said that Flavor Flav himself was in the kitchen cooking, and sure enough, he was.  No clock because of health reasons, but he was hands deep in prepping chicken.  The place is small, and not flashy.  Public Enemy was playing over the speakers, and a few pictures of Flav hanging with other famous folk, but the size and decor were subdued.

In between food prep breaks, he came out and talked to people, posing for photos, and signing autographs before rushing back to the food.

I placed my order, and waited.  And waited. 

And waited.

Turns out, they simply weren't prepared for the mass onslaught of people at the end, and had to rush like crazy to get everyone's order covered.  The staff looked exhausted having been there all day, but they were nothing but friendly, even tempered, and soldiered on, saying that they are here to be the best.  Flav even came out in between food prep breaks to let people know how genuinely appreciative he was that so many people came out to support him, and just bless everyone.  He's going to make this right.  And that included getting down to the last order perfect.  "If anyone were to get a raw piece of chicken", he said, "you can come up and punch me in the face."

It was nearing midnight by the time the final 10 orders were being serviced.  He was dead set on making everything perfect, and thanked us over and over for our patience.  I have never seen someone work so hard in my life.  Forgot the rapping and reality show work.  The man is a juggernaut in the kitchen.  His staff are class and all were working like crazy to get food done, and keep people happy.

When I finally got my order, it was past midnight, so I wished him happy birthday.  As I got handed my bag, I called out to him to say thank you for working so hard for us.  I felt it was the least I could do.

With that, he stopped, came over to me, and shook my hand profusely, thanking me for coming out, being patient, and bless me for being so supportive.  I've come across of a lot of celebrities, famous people, and well knowns in my time.  Flavor Flav is honestly one of the nicest, most genuine people I've ever met.

Past midnight, I finally dragged home, more excited than tired by the wackiness of the adventure, and how fun the whole experience was.  And then I sunk my teeth into the first bite of the chicken.

....

o_O

My God.... 

It is, hands down, the best fried chicken that I've had in Las Vegas, if not possibly ever.  It is absolutely, utterly remarkable.  I don't know what Flav puts in that fried chicken skin, but Colonel Sanders deserves a demotion in rank and can kiss Flav's backside, for Sanders or Popeye are no longer the masters.  I devoured chicken like a Mogwai from Gremlins, and even cold the next day, I gnawed on the remaining pieces with glee.  The mac and cheese is excellent.  I even liked the french fries quite a bit.

So if there was ever a "bucket list" item that you never knew you had or even wanted, I can now cross off that Flavor Flav personally hand prepped and cooked me one of the best fried chicken meals that I have ever had in my life.

You'll need this experience on your bucket list.  You don't know how much you really do.

I will heartily go back to this diamond of a chicken place in a microsecond.  I am stunned.

To all previous Yelp friends who reviewed Carlos' Kitchen--THANK YOU!  I was aware of Chef Carlos when he was at the other place a few blocks away but never went there.  After being reminded of him by Susie H.'s recent review, this was on my to try list ASAP.

We arrived early last night (Sunday) after the Ribbon of Life show at the Smith Center.  We were the only ones in the place.  The server told us to sit anywhere we liked and she handed us the menus after we were seated.  Before leaving, she read the specials of the day.  There were two dinners, a wrap, and I believe a salad special.  She had me hooked with the first thing she read--bleu cheese pasta with steak!  I ordered that and my wife ordered Chicken Angelina.

The bleu cheese pasta was made with penne rigate and the steak was grilled, sliced, and placed in strips on top of the pasta.  The bleu cheese sauce was exceptional.  A great bleu cheese bite with every taste and there was extra bleu cheese crumbles spread on the pasta.  My wife chicken Angelina was a seared chicken breast served on top of garlic spinach and mashed potatoes with large pieces of mushroom.  It was topped with artichoke and there was a dijon cream sauce.  She enjoyed it a lot!

Although we were both full, we had our minds set on having dessert we had looked at online earlier in the day.  She got a chocolate molten lava cake and I got the chef's indulgence.  Both were outstanding!!!  The menu describes the indulgence this way:  A Cheesecake Spring Roll, Crunchy Bites of Brownie and Mini Banana's Foster Cheesecakes, served with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Fresh Strawberries and House Made Berry, Caramel & Fudge Sauces.  For the single version there's one brownie bite and one mini bananas Foster, but that's more than enough.  There are sweetened tortilla strips on the bottom of the plate.  This is one of the most creative desserts I've seen.  

Chef Carlos came to the table twice to check on us and we chatted about the food and what he'd done since he moved to this newer spot.  The restaurant is almost completely closed from the VP bar so there's almost no smoke smell from the bar coming into the restaurant.  I can really see this place coming onto our rotation list of places to go again and again.  I'll call and ask the specials before I go.  What a wonderful gem hidden away in this video poker bar!  And, what a fantastic and creative chef Carlos is.  He cares about his food and his customers.

Linda S. does not wait in long lines for food...except today. Today was about subjecting my family to driving across town to a long wait inside a smoke filled casino which has surely stunted my daughter's growth...all in the name of PAN ROAST. I would have lived the rest of my life ignorant of such a dish, but I became aware of this PAN ROAST in my quest for clam chowder in Las Vegas. The name itself brought images of a sort of pot roast, and of course this is sooo not even close.
I've been to Palace Station for conventions and would not have guessed I would be dragging my family here to eat on a Sunday afternoon. Crazy. I was hoping the line wouldn't be too bad, but we ended up waiting 1.50 hours to get our food. About 45 minutes into waiting, I noticed the 21 & over sign, so we inquired about take out since we had our daughter with us. They do offer take out but we would still have to wait. They only have about 18 seats at the bar. 18 seats plus 13 people ahead of us translated into about an hour to be seated.
I was especially curious to see how they prepare the pan roast. They use special steam pans and the food is cooked right in front of you. The chef was very jovial and interacted with patrons. Maybe if he just cooked, it would go faster. But the customers seemed to enjoy it and the servers were very nice.
I am terrible with remembering chronological order but here is my account anyway. If I missed anything, please feel free to let me know as I would like to attempt this recipe at home :) 
First came a scoop of butter, then garlic and chopped veges (looked like onions, celery and red peppers). Then I think he added the fresh seafood, followed by a ladle of clam juice. He let it cook until bubbly. Next came the sprinkle of chili powder to taste (1-10 level) and other seasoning...possibly celery seed. He let it cook some more. Then a splash of brandy and white wine. Finally a healthy ladle of a creamy red stock. Cooks it some more until hot and bubbling. The last step that put a smile on everyone's face was when he tips the pan into the bowl, puts a scoop of white rice and serves it up. The long wait is over :) Nom, nom, nom! Be careful not to burn your mouth as it comes out very hot.
PAN ROAST is a delicious and creamy seafood stew full of flavor. The combo pan roast has shrimp, lobster and crabmeat. Not at all fishy and very satisfying. The broth is rich and so flavorful,  you won't believe that you finished the entire thing...I know I didn't.
The CLAM CHOWDER  is one of the best I've had. Creamy but not heavy. Tender pieces of clams and small little chunks of potato (not too much). Another winning dish here.
I am happy to say that I would venture another trip to the Oyster Bar for the PAN ROAST and Clam Chowder.

This is my review of mine and my husband's experience for my birthday on May 1st, 2013. I am upset to give The Cosmo a two star review, but based on my experience with the check-in process and having a suite here I cannot give anymore. I have been a fan of Cosmo since it opened. I've spent a lot of money here. I'm a local and I sing its praises to out of towners all the time. But I will NOT be recommending for any of my friends (local or otherwise) to actually stay here.

We arrived early (just about an hour) prior to check-in time and we were greeted by a very nice, chipper young lady who set about getting our information. First off, we had just made the reservation the day before, so we were absolutely sure it was there. The girl typed in our name repeatedly to no avail. My husband whipped out his phone and showed her our email confirmation so she could look it up by the confirmation number instead. TA-DA. There it was with our last name misspelled. Hurray. At least we were smart enough to bring our confirmation with us or else they probably never would have found our reservation to begin with. 

They have our reservation for the Terrace Suite for one night. She asks us if we're there for business or pleasure and I say it's my birthday and we're locals and we just wanted to get a room for the night and play by the pool. She seems okay with that and continues tapping away, then she excuses herself and brings forth some other guy in a suit. O HAI guy in a suit, what do you want? He introduces himself and shakes mine and my husband's hand. He then proceeds to chastise us and shame-shame us for being locals and getting a hotel room for a night.

"It's our policy to inform locals that our rooms are not meant for loud, raging parties. We expect you to be courteous to the other guests. After all, there are plenty of other places to have a good time here in the resort."

OH. OKAY GUY IN SUIT. I'll try not to have a raging balls-to-the-wall party in my room since you've wagged your finger in my face before I even check in.

What gets me is that he specifically said it's policy for them to inform LOCALS. Because, well, guess what locals? Cosmo doesn't want your business if you're just there for a night for your birthday with your husband trying to enjoy a suite and have dinner with your friends. Seriously. I was so incensed by this guy I didn't know what to do besides awkwardly laugh at his remarks.

He then goes on to ask if we're "in the industry". 

No. I reply. I work for the federal government and my husband is Air Force. 

"OOOOH" says guy in suit, "Thank you for your service."

YAH. Fuck you. You were just giving us a lesson in how we should conduct ourselves in our room that we're paying good money for, GUY IN SUIT. How about you fuck off with your "thank you for your service".

I've never been treated that way when I've checked into any hotel before on the strip. I've never been shamed because I'm a local. I've never been given a talking to by some random guy just because I happen to be local and I happen to just be getting a suite for the night. I think it was ridiculous. I think it was rude. And I think The Cosmo does a whole lot of assuming about their guests.

Well I guess my young appearance my tattoos must have just sent alarm bells ringing up the asses of these people.

So our check-in process basically sucked and I am sad to report how far it dropped The Cosmo in my eyes.

Our room - Terrace Suite, 28th floor, facing the Bellagio Fountains. Amazing room, full kitchen, living area, wrap around suite, plush bed, interesting artwork. Lighting that goes completely on and off when you leave the suite. A tub that could have been much bigger in my opinion and a decent enough bathroom. We didn't call for room service, so can't comment. 

We DID have my 4 friends come up to the suite AFTER we had dinner. We all fuckin jumped all over the beds and turned over tables and lit a fire in the trash can and brought in a fuckin tiger from Sig & Roy's Magical Garden and we fucked that place up. OH JUST KIDDING. We watched the fountain show, hung out, had champagne, talked, and had my birthday cake while I opened presents. Afterward my LOCAL CRAZY MUTHER EFFING FRIENDS left and my husband and I watched TV and went to bed. OH MAH GAWD.

Anyway, that's my experience at The Cosmo. Not so good, eh? Dearest locals - go elsewhere, lest you be chastised before you even get a chance to enjoy.

Shame on me for not eating here sooner! Vintner Grill is in a business complex and can be easy to miss, but you will not want to. I was surprised upon entering VG, it had  a modern beach feel to it. The patio chairs were very roomy, comfortable and had pillows. If eating inside isn't your thing they have cabanas outside, but only a couple so if you want to make sure and get one it would be best to make a reservation. 

If cheese & wine are your thing then VG is the place for you! They have a selection of over 400 wines from different countries. They also offer 30 different beers from around the world. When it comes to the cheese, the menu says VG has one of the largest selections of cheese in Las Vegas! They also have a nice selection of house cured meats. If you are interested in buying their cheese online instead of at the restaurant you can go to the following website http://vgcheese.3dcartstores.com/ to place your order.

Out server checked on us often and was very nice. A man came around with a bread tray and offered us a complimentary variety of breads and left some butter and oil on the table. The bread was delicious, but it would be easy to fill up on this stuff so I just had a few bites. After looking over the menu it was hard to decide since so many things sounded tasty. I chose the "Classic Cobb W/Grilled Beef Tenderloin Salad" that had a bacon-blue cheese vinaigrette. This salad priced at $14 and had green onion, hard boiled eggs, hearty blue cheese crumbles, fresh greens and of course the beef tenderloin. The vinaigrette was so good! The beef was cooked perfect, tender and flavorful.  I couldn't stop eating this salad it was just so good. All of the flavors meshed well together and I will happily order it again! I was having lunch with a friend who ordered the "Grilled Lemon-Marjoram Chicken Salad" also priced at $14 and she enjoyed it. 

Vintner Grill is the perfect place to have lunch with a friend, date night with that special someone, or celebrate an occasion with family and friends. VG has a private party space and also offers catering.

Las Vegas can be on the extremes at times with all of its glamour and luxury along with the back alley dirt on your dinner table; however, I've never been offended by Vegas until now.

HAZE may be the newest nightclub in town, but it sure won't last very long when the mystery is revealed that there's absolutely nothing special about this club except for a bunch of bouncers in the front all of whom think they are just too good for you. HAZE is not owned by Aria but by the Light Group which runs all of MGM / Mirage property clubs including Jet and the club at Hard Rock. If you've ever been mistreated at those clubs, now you know why. 

First, it's competition like someone mentioned is XS, Tryst, TAO and many other clubs that have amazing features such as beaches and pools, lagoons and pillars towering high above with gorgeous views of the strip. They have elegant and impressive bars and table areas. They have huge dance floors in multiple places and interesting tidbits like the girls in the bathtubs at TAO or the dancers at the pole at Tryst. Unfortunately for HAZE, they don't seem to have any of these features except for a small stage which divides the already small dance floor that contains a pole. They boast about having special shows that no other clubs have, but it's nothing more than going to a strip club on a B-grade night where a bald, head shaven female will come out and perform for you while hundreds watch on and wonder why she has no hair and is made up to look so scary instead of sexy.

This club is SMALL. It cannot hold many people and of all the people it does hold, its about 90% girls. No they will not go home with you nor will they party with you because they also have the same attitude as the bouncers in the front. Too. Good. For. You.

If you are a guy and you are trying to get in to this club, please save yourself some time and heartache because you will not get in even if you grease the bouncer $100+. If you get a table, you will have to deal with the fact that there's literally no space for you to dance and the waitress seems to be always missing so you can't get any service after paying $300 for a bottle of alcohol you can get from Costco in a bigger size for $55+tax. Even if you have 10 girls and 1 guy, the guy will get redirected to another line that will not move, and will be dispersed by the bouncers saying they are at capacity for people so cannot let anymore people in (but then will usher in 10 girl groups).

Despite the poor layout, poor design, poor air quality and extremely expensive drinks (mixed drinks for $20? are you kidding me? not even the Wynn has these kinds of prices for a Vodka and Pineapple), HAZE tries to limit to zero the number of guys going into the club.

Lets step back for a second. If the girls get in free, and guys buy girls drinks, and guys are in the club to find girls and are willing to pay to find and buy these girls drinks ... aren't guys the STAPLE of the Las Vegas clubbing scene? So why is it that every other club has this figured out already except for the newest supposedly "hippest" club in town?

Regardless, being a hotel guest I expected to have no problems getting in with the bf. We waited in line, like normal people would. We had VIP passes from our stay at Aria. We did not bitch, moan, complain or make a scene. Somehow, we were still separated after 45 minutes of waiting in line only to say that I could get in free but he would have to stay behind and wait in a line that may or may not get in at all. 

And when I tried to find someone to explain the situation where we were guests of the hotel, had waited for a long time, had VIP passes and there's no reason for me to be in a club by myself while he's out there waiting ... the main floor manager Mike cussed at me, shoved me physically and told me I had to get in or get out while completely being RUDE and did not listen to ANYTHING I had said. 

I understand Vegas is different, I understand guys have to pay more than girls, I understand they are trying to keep the girl to guy ratio high. What I don't understand is why someone has to be RUDE and use INAPPROPRIATE language in front of me when I have not done anything except ask if he could give me a minute so I could explain how I was frustrated at the situation. There's NO reason for him to put his hands on me, there is NO reason for him to be rude. 

Please take your business elsewhere. HAZE is not worth your time, their attitude is not worth you having to put up with it, and you will have a far better time at XS or TAO once you find out that HAZE is nothing more than smoke and mirrors located in a dingy basement with some lighting, overpriced drinks, and no room at all to move.

Reflective of visit May 2012.

Do not go, do not go, do not go, do not go. I can't say that enough. If I could give a negative rating I would.

Decor: I've got too much to talk about to waste characters here.  But to note:  I am handicapped, and there is no elevator. I understand it is an old building, so actually not their fault, but it was the first omen of a bad night and should be noted for any handicapped patrons who may be reading this review. Even to get to the inside dining room, there is no ramp, only stairs, albeit 2 steps, but still.

Service: Ha! Negative 5 stars. We were there as guests of a sizable private party, and seated outside and served buffet style. Many of us, including my husband, approached the outdoor bar instead of going back inside to the main. There were two bartenders, a female and male. He tried to order from the male. "Do you have Malibu rum?" Reply: "No." "Okay, what about a 7&7?" Reply: "Nope." "Fine then, just a plain Coke." Reply: "We don't have Coke." "Okay... what do you have?" The bartender starts to lift up bottles to show my husband. One of which is rum, not Malibu, fine, but then the correct response at the beginning should have been, "Sorry sir, I don't have Malibu, but I do have 'insert brand here.' Would you like that?" Anyway, as he sees the bottle of rum in front of his eyes, he also sees a cocktail waitress next to him ordering from the female bartender-- 2 rum and cokes, so my husband asks for that, as he sees her pouring said rum and popping open cans of coke for the waitress' drinks. He tells male bartender "I'll take one of those--a rum and coke." Reply is an exacerbated "We don't have Coke!" My husband is in disbelief. Finally the female says, "Yes, we do," and hands the man a can. The male says to my husband, "Oh, I guess we do," mixes the cocktail, and there is no apology or even sheepish or embarrassed expression.

Next, the buffet line of tapas chosen by the host: at sundown on the patio with little light (as well as the fact most items were fried past recognition) many of us couldn't see or figure out what was being served. My husband, ever the optimist, even after his bar escapade, asked the staff member working the buffet line if he could tell us (aka me, him, and his elderly uncle) what that the items were. Staff member's response: He scoffed, and said "EVERYTHING?!?!?!" (Oh, I'm sorry for putting you out by asking you to assist me, which is your job!) My husband quietly, being made to feel like the rude one in the situation, if not an idiot, both of which were untrue and uncalled for, said, "Well, yes." So the horrendously rude server quickly pointed and offered no explanation other than, "Pork sandwiches, lamb, chicken, and all the same repeated at the other end." First of all, even I could tell via sight that every serving tray held something different, there was no "repeating at the other end," but whatever...Anyway, based on that amazingly helpful [please read sarcasm] explanation, we chose a few items and went to our seats. Mr. Helpful server wasn't even right. His closest "guess" was the "pork sandwiches which turned out to be mini Cubans. Other than that there were fried artichokes and calamari. (Glad I guessed that from its look on the serving table myself, as I hate the stuff and would have "urped" if I mistakenly took a bite.)

Lastly on the service end, I asked a passing waiter if there was a manager I could speak with in order to report the previous server's disrespectful attitude. This waiter refused to get a manager, saying, "Whatever it is, I can help." Fine, I was in no mood to argue. But when I told him, he simply laughed and said, "I'll get you a menu." I was taken aback and replied, "I don't need a menu, it's done. It's just his attitude I have a problem with." He laughed again and offered to bring a menu.  When I insisted again that a menu had nothing to do with it, he laughed more and walked away.  I would bet the bank these employees have either been trained to not get a manager because the manager doesn't want to hear about it, or that they don't want to get a manager because they don't want to show any sign to their superiors that there is, yet another, complaint.

Food: Zero stars.  Most tasteless beyond fried grease, the rest bland.

Trust the undercover Food Network specials--this place is deplorable. I can't believe in an economy where establishments are boarded up daily it seems, that this one has enough customers to stay open, and that it doesn't seem to care if or how it will retain them.

Originally hubby and I were going to try a different place, but it was too packed so I decided to look up what was nearby on the yelp app. I had Fat Boy bookmarked and it was only a couple of blocks from where we tried to eat first, so we headed to Fat Boy.

Walking inside there wasn't much space and there were plenty of customers. There are maybe 4 or 5 tables and we were lucky enough after ordering to snatch one up. The food is made to order and since it was busy we had to wait our turn for our food to come out, but I was patient since it smelled of yummy pizza throughout the place and the vibe inside was awesome.

I asked the man who took our order if the bacon was made fresh since this would alter if I would order it or not. He said that indeed was! I ordered a "BLT Sandwich" priced at just $3.24 for the sandwich by itself, or $6.23 to make it a combo with fries and a drink. I made mine a combo and substituted regular fries for "Chencho Fries" which was a very smart decision. The BLT came out on a burger bun with fresh shredded lettuce, tomato and mayo. I was surprised at the amount of bacon on the sandwich for the price. I was pleased with the flavor of the BLT and would happily order it again with a little extra mayo. You can order the Chencho Fries with skinny or fat fries. The cashier suggested the skinny fries so I went with that and hubby had the fat fries with his. The Chencho Fries have a little bit of chicken with green sauce and cheese. Yum! I loved these fries! Get over here and try these fries! Hubby had a "Pastrami Boyger" and couldn't stop talking about how good the pastrami was so we came back a couple days later for dinner again!

This time hubby went with a full on "Pastrami Sandwich" and loved it. I knew after smelling the pizza a couple days before that I had to give it a try. They have a pick-up only special where you can get a 14" one topping pizza for $5.49 so I was all over that! I ordered a cheese pizza and a side of ranch to dip it in. The owner (turns out this was who took our order the first time) came over to our table and talked to me about the pizza and how he makes the dough from scratch everyday. The pizza was cheesy and the sauce and crust tasted great. I just can't believe how good it tastes for such a great price. I don't live near Fat Boy, but it's worth the drive and I will absolutely be back! 

They offer a good variety of menu options from pizza, boygers, wings, fingers, salads, sandwiches, milkshakes, bottled drinks and fountain drinks. They also offer boyrritos, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas and even serve breakfast! They have different specials and family deals too.

So it's a restaurant chain. That doesn't matter to me I'm a fan. I admit that I don't ever eat at Buca unless I have a coupon, but come on they send them in the mail all of the time! I'm also signed up on the e-mail list so they send offers that way too. I received a $20 off with purchase of 2 entrees and wanted to take advantage of it since I hadn't had Buca in a while, and it was better then the $10 off they generally send.  

We arrived just after 5 pm. The parking lot was pretty empty and when we got inside we were able to have our pick of where to sit since they weren't busy. We must have just beat the dinner rush coming in because the restaurant soon filled up. Our server brought some complimentary bread that I had to force myself to put down to save room for my meal that was coming. I could have eaten the bread all to myself! Since Buca serves family style meals the portions are big. They have small and large sizes, but don't let the small size trick you into thinking it isn't much because it is plentiful. 

I ordered the "Penne Arrabbiata" priced at $19.99 for the small. It had spicy Italian sausage on top of the pasta as well in the sauce. I wasn't crazy about this dish simply because it had too much sausage flavor. I like sausage, but don't like it overpowering certain dishes. The sausage that was on the pasta also was a bit dry. The other dish I ordered was the "Baked Lasagna" priced at $19.99 for the small. This is so good! The meat sauce it tasty and the cheesy goodness it what makes it! There is ricotta, mozzarella, provolone and parmesan cheese in this lasagna. Very comforting and delicious! 

You can phone your order for pick-up if you don't feel like eating inside. Buca has several options as far as catering goes. You can pick up "Party Pans" (they have a menu for this) if you are having a gathering at your house and don't want the fuss of cooking. They offer different sizes and menu options broken down to how many people you are entertaining. They also offer a catering service where you can have Buca deliver the food along with tablecloths, plates, utensils, etc. so this is probably a great choice for a corporate party. They also have banquet rooms (some themed) and offer group menu options. When the server told me about the themed rooms I wondered what they could be like since there are pictures of naked people hanging on the regular dining walls. I crack up every time wondering how they get away with that since Buca is supposed to be a place to bring the familia, but it is just part of the character and I guess it works!

DB Brasserie has returned to the Strip and I must say that my return visit was one of the best dinner experiences I ever had.

First, let's go back in time to my review of Daniel Boulud Brasserie when they were located at The Wynn -- http://bit.ly/1o4M0AL
Looking back at that review it's pretty interesting to know that it was my first foray into high end gourmet burgers.  That DB Burger was simply too amazing and when I found out that DB Brasserie was returning, I had high hopes in being able to have the DB Burger once again.  However, a few weeks before my trip, I saw their grand opening menu and noticed that it was missing, which almost made me not want to go.

When I arrived in Vegas, at first I wasn't too sure about going there since it was so close to their grand opening and I assumed they were still working out the kinks.  So it pretty much became a game-time decision on my last day there when I made a reservation for dinner.  And I don't regret that decision one bit!

I love the fresh new look of the place.  It's definitely brighter and more inviting than the old location which was dark and almost cave-like.  The decor is quite similar to Bouchon which is a hybrid of classic bistro look with a modern touches.

Menu -- http://bit.ly/1mmt90m
I'm not sure what exactly carried over from the old Wynn location, but this current menu is a like a 'greatest hits' mashup of all his restaurants in NYC from Bar Boulud, DBGB, and Daniel.  Unfortunately for me, the DB Burger that I enjoyed back at the old location wasn't on the menu here.  Which was fine because I was willing to try something new with this visit.

Here's what I had for dinner:

Fresh baked baguette and foccacia. -- http://bit.ly/1omQGCE
They give you a small portion to start with, but you can always ask for more bread.  The baguette was nice, hot, and chewy.

Escargot Spatzle -- http://bit.ly/1omQMKA
burgundy snail fricasse, chicken "oysters", mushrooms, garlic, parsley coulis, hazelnut
I've never had Escargot of any kind before so I decided to man-up and try this.  It was delicious!  I actually couldn't distinguish the Escargot from the sauteed mushrooms, but everything on the plate tasted good with the spatzle giving it some substance.

Beef Duo  -- http://bit.ly/1noUxOz
red wine braised short ribs & roasted tournedos, Supergreen spinach, pommes pure, carrots 'nioise'
I basically decided to order this beforehand when I saw them post a pic of this on their Facebook page.  Can you say....OMFGYUM!!!  The short ribs were braised perfectly that it broke down so easily with my fork.  No knife needed!!  And the tournedo was like butter!!  So tender and juicy and just melted in my mouth!  This was probably one of the best beef entrees I've ever had.

"le president" - chocolate and hazelnut mousse tart --  http://bit.ly/1p5pp9Q
Chocolate-Hazelnut Mousse Tart, Coffee Chantilly
Best way to finish the night.  I ordered this with zero expectations and it was rich decadent.  Very nice presentation!  The mousse was nice and cool too.

I'm definitely coming back to DB Brasserie.  I would love to try everything else on the menu and hopefully next time I go there, maybe the DB Burger will return.   I actually wouldn't mind coming back for lunch as well, now that they have a 3-course prix-fixe menu for under $30.  It doesn't get any better than that, especially on The Strip.  Overall, I highly recommend DB Brasserie!  They really impressed me with their exceptional service, lively atmosphere, and delicious food.  Thank you, Daniel Boulud for bringing DB Brasserie back to Las Vegas!

All you need to know about Cheddar's is that it serves good comfort food and has a well stocked, ample bar area.  

We came here on a Friday night around five. Cheddar's was in the middle of it's opening week growing pains. We were told there was a ten to fifteen minute wait, and nearly fifty-five minutes later, we were seated. LOL

As noted above, the food makes up for the confusion at the hostess station. The servers were on top of their game, and many were backing each other up, busing each other's tables. Nice!

The atmosphere was busy as you could imagine.  But, Jeff the Manager was walking around, keeping a watchful eye on things. He made a point of visiting each table and greeting guests by saying: "welcome to your new favorite neighbor restaurant,". It worked on us. Double, nice!!

The menu is mixture of burgers and steaks, with the prices being extraordinarily reasonable. The half pound burgers on the menu were only$6.29-6.79, with the chicken and steaks around $11-14. 

We started with two ice teas, one regular, the other a Long Island.  Surprisingly they were less than $2.00 apart and came out almost immediately. Did I mention our server Lori was good?  She treated us as if we were her only table!

After the teas arrive, we decided to try the Spinach Dip (see photo) for $5.99. It was very tasty, served with light tortilla chips and warm salsa. 

For our entree, we ordered a half rack of BBQ ribs ($10.79)and the Rib-Eye Philly Steak Sandwich ($8.49).  The ribs had a nice smokey taste. While the only downside was the sandwich, which seemed to have more mushrooms than steak.  

As mentioned above prices are very reasonable, and yes we'll be back after the newness and crowds settled down. Expect to pay around $25 each, including one drink each, one appetizer, taxes and gratuities. 

So Three and a half Stars "A-Okay". But this might change, since Cheddar's has the potential to become a goto neighbor restaurant.

I really enjoy the Sicilian pizza from the Cugino's across town, so when I noticed this location I wanted to check it out. Before walking in, I noticed a sign at the door promoting their current specials. When I saw they offered a 2 slice Sicilian special with drink I knew that would be what I wanted to get. I have been in more than once and the same sign is out front with several different specials on it, but they don't always have them all available. So far each time I have been in (even at dinner time) they don't have any Sicilian ready unless you order a whole pizza. They only have had some regular slices available. When I asked the guy behind the counter about it, he said that it just depends what time you get there and says they sell out quick. If people like it so much why not have more of it ready? Oh well I do agree it's tasty! I ended up getting the 2 slice special with a drink. For just cheese slices it's only $4.99 and with pepperoni it's $5.99 which isn't bad at all. The slices are decent size and like how the crust is thin yet has just the right crispness to it. I have eaten inside, but I have also taken my lunch back to work with me and I like that the pizza is still nice and warm and the crust isn't soggy by the time I drive back and eat it. This is a plus because let's face it, not all take-out tastes the same once you get it home vs. eating it right when you get it. The inside is clean and the employees are friendly. Definitely better than average pizza, so if you are in the area give it try.

One day, my je'e (mother) and I were wandering around Mesa trying to figure out where in the hell we were. The Navi was on the fritz and we were both getting aggrivated. 

"I'm not trying to get us lost Cheryl Miranda... I'm trying to find somewhere to eat - I'm hungry!" She shouted at me while nearly sideswiping a car off of Stapley - it was our third near accident that day. 

"Oh... DUDE! Turn Left at Main - there's a place that has popovers!" (For my non-O'odham yelpers, Popovers is my tribe's nickname for frybread; wah-much-tha is the traditional name for it btw) 

"POPOVERS!! Hell no! If you want frybread, we'll go home and you can make some!"

"Awww... come on! It's prolly the only place around here anyway!"

So we turned into a rather... dank looking strip mall (aren't they all dank looking?) and my mom nearly slammed into a drive thru sign for a small taquillia who specializes in tortas. We pulled up to a small resturant that was BRIGHTLY painted with Apache Crowndancer and large promises of Apache burgers & Navajo Lamb. 

When we entered we found a large airy room with a small dining room. Tables and booths to line the windows. There was a cute lil White couple dining on large tacos and huge sodas and a counter where employees took the order. We grabbed a couple of menus and then sat at a booth and looked things over.

"oh my gosh! haha! the ONLY difference between an Apache burger and a Navajo burger is that an Apache burger has two patties!" I giggled to my mom.

"Well... Navajos are really skinny." Score one for mom!

"the ONLY difference between an Apache taco and a Navajo taco is that one has crushed (think refried) beans and the other doesn't." 

"oh what in the HELL?!" I exclaimed as I turned the menu and I saw the monstrosity they call a dessert. The "tempting" Indian Dessert... looks - (I'm so sorry to say this) disgusting! I'm sorry! Grandma never EVER put so much on a frybread! It comes with a full sized frybread topped with a HUGE scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate syrup, powdered sugar & cinnamon. It's too much! frybread has such an amazing texture and delicate flavor... it's best when hot and to dump so much STUFF on it and let it get melty and gloopy is - gross. My advice is to stick with the basics and get a LIGHT dusting of sugar OR honey. 

We were both a little grossed out at the thought of the 'indian dessert' and decided to finally order. I had the red chili taco with whole beans (which cost extra). Normally - at frybread stands, it's called a red chili combo but not here. The madre got a whole bean taco (navajo taco). 

We started to talk with the employees for a second and it turns out they are pretty friendly. We got our drinks and sat back down. I began to really get a scope of the room. Photographs of Apache Sunrise Ceremonies where plastered on the walls as well as cradleboards and small Navajo rugs. I thought it was cute and I'm glad all the art was authentic. Within a few minutes, an employee came out from the kitchen and brought us our food.

The bread was normal sized (umm... I guess large to non-natives?) it had a great texture and was very fresh. I liked the redchili's flavor but was disappointed it wasn't very hot. Their hot sauce was good and I put it on EVERYTHING! My mom liked her taco as well but wished there was more salt. She in turn - then sprinkled half the shaker on our table onto her taco. 

We wound up ordering another couple of breads one with honey and the other with sugar and enjoyed our light dessert. Overall the food was good. I'm glad the service was quick and friendly and I'm even more grateful that the chili sauces were fresh and flavorful. The bread itself was crisp and light and yet still hearty. It takes a lot of years to develop such technique - I was quite impressed with it.

the prices on the other hand... compared to on-reservation stands are astronomical but when compared to powwows and the state fair they are still a little high but when compared to other resturants - they are actually cheap. lol... odd I know. The entree`s are about $7 at the resturant but NOTHING will EVER make me to pay over $3 for ONE single tortilla! That is outrage! it should be $3 for a half dozen, but not for one thick tortilla! 

To my yelpers, These are real Natives. They are cooking traditional recipes handed down from generations. The bread is good. The dining area isn't anything to write home about. The prices are both decent and highway robbery at the same time.  The cooking facilities and the dining area appear very clean. The burgers and mutton appear to freshly grilled. If you're in the area - give it a try. But do NOT order that damned dessert! I don't wanna hear about one of ya'll slipping into a diabetic coma from eating it.

We have enjoyed The White Chocolate Grill (WCG) many times, both for Happy Hour and for dinner. Our experiences have been universally good.

We came here last week after church for Easter Sunday around 2-ish for dinner.  We had made our reservations on Open Table/Yelp and our booth was waiting for us when we arrived.  Actually, the WCG was only half full at the time after a busy brunch, but it was nice having the hostess escort us over to our table by the window.

Our water glasses were filled, as we sat looking at our menus.  Heather our server came by giving us the Specials of the day.  The three of us decided to skip the wine list, opting instead for Ice Tea.  It had already been a long day, and any alcohol would have put us to sleep.

We started by sharing the Ahi Tuna Salad for $14.95.  WCG normally sears it with a sesame crust which is very good, but today we asked them not to cook it but serve it raw.  There is something about raw ahi tuna, in their champagne vinaigrette that speaks to me.  Today was no different, it was very nicely done.

For dinner we order, the End Cut Prime Rib for $24.99, the Baby Back Rib for $21.99, and the Balsamic Rib Eye for $26.89.  Each of us had a bite of the others and we were very happy with our selections.  

The Rib Eye was not what you would have expected, in so far as it was not a piece of prime rib without the bone, but instead two small 7' cutlets cooked in a glazed balsamic reduction sauce.  Very nice.   The Baby Backs were as you would expect, as was the End Cut.

For dessert, we ordered the Bread Pudding for $7.59 and the house special Silky Chocolate Souffl Cake also $7.59.  We also had some coffee for $2.49 and a Cappuccino for $2.99.

In my Yelp Tip, I mentioned the Bread Pudding as being exceptional and it is,  I know on some cooking shows, it looks like just day old bread and a cream sauce of some kind.  But at WCG, the sauce is almost Creme Brulle-ish and it really is out of this world.  

The total damage came to $116.00, before tax of $10.79 and tip; which seemed fair for three people.  One of things we like to do is go to a movie at the nearby Harkin's Cine Capri and stop at WCG for dessert afterwards.  We really had a nice time at the WCG on Easter and we will certainly recommend them.

Enjoy!

I'm in Las Vegas with my father for one night (don't ask, we're not getting married or any sick Red state shit like that) and I refuse to eat where we are staying because as much as I love me some free room service, I cannot handle when my only choice on the menu is a STEAMED VEGETABLE PLATTER.  that is right.  it is a platter of steamed vegetables and a scoop of white rice.  just typing that sentence makes me want to get sick all over this computer.  now, you might be thinking, "Laura, aren't you on Weight Watchers?" and to that I say, "Fuck you."  

So anyway, I decide we're going to be adventurous and take a trip off the strip to a mostly vegetarian restaurant that I've been to before called Long Life Vege.  It's about a ten minute cab ride away, it's cheap and they have delicious fake meat.  Delicious.  While my dad may hate fake meat product, there is nothing the man loves more than cheap (the dude likes to be told how much you spent on his birthday present and if it's under $10 he will be all, "HIGH FIVE!" Once, my sister got him a pair of toe nail clippers from Mac Frugal's (RIP) for 99 cents and the man shed a tear.  HE CRIED, HE WAS SO PROUD) so we were in a cab faster than you can say, "faux chicken chow mein."  Well, our cabbie was a delightful chap from Somalia who was very affable and talkative and when he asked why we were going to a vegetarian restaurant, my dad said, "Because this one's a VEGAN!  Hahaha!' and they laughed and laughed.  Good one, you guys!  It IS hilarious when someone is vegan!  HAR DEE FUCKING HAR HAR.

we pull up to Long Life Vege and the motherfucker is closed.  GODDAMMIT.  we ask our cabbie for restaurant recommendations and he suggests Merkato since it is nearby and he is a regular.  We get to Merkato and as we are getting out of the cab, both my dad and I realize that we forgot our wallets.  Well, actually, my dad forgot his wallet and I "forgot" mine, you dig?  I ain't paying when money bags is around!  I wrangle dogs for a living and my father gets hundred dollar bills poured on his head just for waking up.  Plus, there will be no social security left for me when i'm old and I gotta save NOW!  and by save NOW!, i mean buy that new ipod phone because it's SWEET!  do you think it comes in pink??

We take a cab back to the hotel, my dad get his wallet, takes out another $100 from the ATM and we drive back to Merkato.  The cab is $45 at this point so my dad gives the guy what he thinks is $70 because he has put up with our insanity for the evening.  You're saying to yourself, "Who gives a fuck, Laura?" And to that I say, "Wait for it. You will get a mild satisfaction at the end but it's probably still not worth reading the whole long ass review."

We walk into Merkato and are the only non-Ethiopian people in the place and it's crazy crowded.  Both VERY good signs for potential deliciousness.  I order the veggie combo (which was a very typical veggie combo: yellow lentils, red lentils, mustard greens, enjera salad, etc) and it was MAGNIFICENT.  One of the best i've had and I've had A LOT.  my dad got the dead lambert and said the flavor was fantastic but there was too much fat and gristle.  now, contrary to popular belief, i haven't always been vegan.  i used to eat meat and let me tell you, i liked the grossest meat.  tendons and gristle and marrow...i mean, i would CLEAN a chicken bone and then use a splinter to pick my teef.  i was a hardcore red neck of an obese 9 year-old until i figured out i was eating bambi.  ANYWAY, if you are currently like i was when i was 9 years-old, then get the lamb and when you're done, have your cholesterol checked because i'm pretty sure you're gonna drop dead at any moment.  

So, we finish our fantastic meal about 15 hours after we first walked in (that's how they roll in Ethiopia.  Slowly.  But friendly.  Like this review.) and as he's paying, my dad realizes that instead of the $30 tip he thought he left our lovable cabbie, he gave him $115 tip.  MY DAD'S BAD!  we also realized that we had no way back to the hotel. luckily when i asked our waitress to call us a cab, she was all, "hold on" and disappears.  two minutes later, a guy who was eating a few tables over has us in his cab, headed back to the hotel.  Major bonus.

In the end, we're dealing with:

Cab rides: $135.  
Dinner: $25 (for two HUGE plates plus two beers and tea)
Average Cost of Dinner for Two People in Las Vegas in Some Cheesy Rip Off Restaurant On The Strip: $200.  

So anyway, I think we still did good.  And there's a cab driver (Yasin!  Holla!) who is high rolling tonight.  Or, you know, sending money back to his family in his war torn country.  As my dad put it, his company is paying and screw those jerkwads, the better man (Yasin! Holla!) wins tonight!  I love my dad.  

I am finally done, you can rest your eyes.  Get up, stretch, do some squats, get the blood flowing...you've been here awhile.

***This Marriott brand hotel (like other Marriott Brand hotels) is located near but still off The Strip; it is actually a pretty nice hotel and you can get good room rates if you do not mind driving, taking a taxi, using the monorail, or enduring one very long walk to The Strip***

Renaissance is part of the Marriott brand and it is very similar to most Marriott hotels.  They both typically feature on-site restaurants and concierge levels and concierge lounges for Gold and Platinum Marriott Rewards members (though Renaissance calls them club levels and club lounges).  The one difference with Renaissance is that they typically feature a sleeker and more modern decor (both in the lobby and rooms).

My room was nice.  It was comfortable and spacious.  The bed was comfortable with good and clean linen.  The cabinets / drawers all felt new and the room had a mini fridge and safe.  The room also had a big flat screen TV.  The decor was nothing too unique, but it did feel more modern than most Marriotts out there.  This one had a nice touch too with a personalized welcome screen on the TV when you enter.

The bathroom was nice.  There was a bath tub and a separate shower.  Like the room, the bathroom was very spacious.  The shower worked well (so did the room temperature unit).

The fitness center was good.  There were many fitness machines available including treadmills, bikes, weights, and CrossRamps.  There was also two restrooms located within the fitness center, which was convenient.  The restrooms could be locked and even came with a private shower.

I did not try the restaurant, but there is a quick service cafe on-site called E-Go Cafe.  The cafe sells snacks, an assortment of coffee drinks and cold drinks.  It also serves breakfast sandwiches, pastries and yogurt parfaits for breakfast and salads and sandwiches for lunch.  I had the yogurt parfait and it was pretty good--the yogurt was tangy while the granola crumble was sweet, buttery and crunchy.  There were also good candied pistachios and berries (though the berries were a tad tart).

E-Go Cafe is fairly small so lines can really build here.  This Renaissance provides a $10 per day credit for Gold and Platinum Marriott Rewards members for Saturday and Sunday morning since the Club Lounge is not open on weekends.  This is a nice touch and I have been to a few Marriotts that did not do this since it is not a required elite benefit.

The Club Lounge was nice.  From Sunday night thru Thursday night, they offer a selection of cold and hot appetizers.  On my visit, cold appetizers consisted of a cheese and antipasto plate though the cheese plates at Marriott and Renaissance lounges are never that good (the cheese was simple cubed cheddar and pepper jack cheese; the antipasto was cubed salami and ham).

There were also cold vegetables like celery, carrots and asparagus (with ranch and a vinaigrette for dipping).  Salty mixed nuts were available as well.  The hot item was chicken breasts in a cream sauce with white rice.  It was a substantial offering for a concierge lounge given most of the time it is just small bites.  The food did not look that good, but the chicken was surprisingly tender and not too dry (and the sauce was not that bad).

Another plus was that cold Coca-Cola drinks were offered.  I think all or almost all of the Marriott lounges I have been to have offered Pepsi drinks, but this one offered Coca-Cola in the thick aluminum bottles, which kept the soft drink very cold and crisp.

Their breakfast was a substantial offering too.  There was decent scrambled eggs (for a buffet)--not too dry and not runny.  There was also bacon and the bacon was very nicely cooked--crisp but not burnt and meaty and not that fatty.  Cold options like fruit and cereal were available.  Orange juice and milk were offered complimentary.

The lounge was a decent size too.  There were several tables available and there was a nice living room area with a large flat screen TV.

Service was good throughout my stay--consistent with the Marriott brand.

Room rates are not bad.  You can find good weekend deals here, but this hotel is very far from The Strip so the location is not really ideal; ideal only if you are spending time at the convention center, which is within walking distance.  There is a monorail stop nearby.

I liked this Renaissance.  Though the exterior did not look that great, I thought the lobby (comfortable with lots of power outlets) and the rooms were both nice (I liked this Renaissance more than the one I stayed at near the St. Louis airport).  Overall, it is a good hotel choice if you are spending a lot of time at the convention center or do not mind being quite far from The Strip.  It is also a nice spot for Gold and Platinum Marriott members given the good Club Lounge and the complimentary weekend breakfast.

Like the Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, this Renaissance offers both free valet and self parking.

My first visit being so-so, I decided to give Teriyaki Madness a second try to see if I liked it any better. For me it was still the same so-so experience and I don't get the hype over this place. Inside is very clean and they have plenty of tables to choose from and the booths are spacious which is nice. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu. Some of the food I ordered was really good and some of it was not so good. I do get coupons in the mail sometimes for BOGO offers, so I can see coming back with a coupon and probably will since the rice and chicken are pretty darn good and I work in the area, but I can't see making a point to come here often. 

Spicy Chicken Teriyaki Plate ($8.99) - I took the white rice that came with it and mixed it with the chicken. I liked the flavor of the chicken a lot. There was a good portion of both rice and chicken. I'd order this again for sure. 

Spicy Beef Teriyaki Plate ($9.49) - For an extra $1 this time I chose noodles instead of rice. The noodles were a bit dry and lacked flavor. The beef was tender and tasted good, but I tasted teriyaki flavor and no spice which was a bummer because I had enjoyed the spicy chicken and the chicken actually kick. The overpowering flavor of teriyaki on this one will most likely mean that I will stick to the spicy chicken instead.

Chicken Egg Roll ($1.99) - Inside I saw tons of what appeared to be black pepper yet the egg roll really had no flavor. It was filled with a generous amount of chicken, but it was greasy and flavorless. 

Chicken Pot Stickers ($3.29) - These were a greasy and overcooked mess. On the menu these are described as "crazy good" and I got 5 of them that were crazy greasy and hard. The inside tasted not so great. I will stick to the stickers elsewhere. 

Stir-Fry Veggies and a Green Salad are each options for sides. The salad came with a sweet dressing that tasted good. The veggies were basic yet tasty and fresh. 

Orders are made fresh so if you are on a lunch break or crunched for time then call your order in so it's ready or at least being made while you are on your way to pick it up.

Chinese food for the affluent located at none other than the world famous Bellagio Resort and Casino.  Normally I wouldn't give a place like this a second thought with its suggested dress code and prices five times the norm, but when Lady Luck intervened I suddenly felt an urge to splurge.

The place is downright formal in its mannerisms.  When I entered the restaurant and inquired about getting a table the hostess greeted me and asked for my last name.  I was asked to take a seat at a small reception area opposite the bar while my table was being prepared.  I found the experience quite interesting because from the moment the hostess wrote down my last name every staff person addressed me as Mr. Y.

The server, the waitress, a floor supervisor ... everybody addressed me as Mr. Y as if they had written my last name somewhere near my table for all to see.

Once inside the fancy dining room with its gigantic crystal chandeliers hanging down I was seated at a small table with a clear view looking out the huge glass windows where three times during my meal the fabulous fountains of the Bellagio performed their artistic magic.  There I was enjoying this amazing spectacle from a most unique vantage point behind the fountains.

At Jasmine they pull your chair out when you go to sit down, they help to push your chair in once you are seated, they unfold your thick fabric napkin for you and they gently place it on your lap.  I was often taught those steps to be used for a special lady, but I never imagined having a lady do those things for me.

Jasmine certainly has its service perfected, but how is their food?

I didn't select any extravagant selection here.  In fact, my selections were downright homey.  I'm pretty certain this type of restaurant can handle the fancy dishes well, but I was curious how well they could punctuate the more traditional dishes I might have at home.

Three Soup Tasting (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg?select=CZ10iE9MQfGLqpLkyda3LQ) is a sampler of three popular soups, braised shark fin, chicken corn chowder and won ton soup.  Since I had run a long race that morning I wanted something soothing, and for me that usually means hot soup.

The shark fin soup had lots of strands of crunchy, chewy shark fin in a slightly thickened soup.  The soup lacked meat though.  Most restaurants will serve this either with shards of chicken breast or pieces of Virginia ham.  Jasmine didn't.  Keeping in mind that this was only a sampler there was exactly one wonton in a perfectly seasoned broth.  The wonton was plump with lean pork and a large chunk of shrimp.  I would have liked more.  Egg whites, corn kernels, corn starch and chicken breast bits made up the very standard chicken corn chowder.

Pineapple Fried Rice was served in a boat-like glass dish lined with a single lotus leaf.  The first bowl was served to me (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg?select=D2-2SonYOPnRw0FUCJ32EA), and I must have refilled my bowl three times in finishing the dish which combined white rice, egg yolks, shrimp, scallops and fresh grilled pineapple.

Ma Po Tofu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg?select=ulN8otZyPI6LQQgH69REeQ) was made with the silky tofu instead of the medium firm tofu I'm used to with this dish.  I had no problem with that though as the dish was very good.  It was mildly spicy just like the waitress suggested.

You can choose from five or six different green leafy vegetables for your Daily Greens side dish.  You can even suggest how you would like it to be prepared.  I chose the Choy Sum (young tender greens) and asked that it be sauted.  The vegetables (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg?select=asVdBSNxFrPL8VSwyZ7j5g) were cooked perfectly with a nice shade of green.  I enjoyed this simple dish very much.

The food is a good 3.5 stars and the service is definitely a 5.  This meal left me nice and full, and the restaurant is a convenient two minute walk along the casino floor to the Cirque du Soleil's "O" Theatre.

Daisho Sushi is a moderate drive away from me (located in a large strip mall on the corner of S. Eastern and E. Warm Springs), but after making my way across town to try out their Dinner AYCE sushi, I am definitely a fan and considered the drive here well worth the effort for good food.

As the restaurant is still relatively new, they were not all that busy tonight (plus it was raining, and you know who people here shy away from driving under such precipitous conditions). So after being seated at the sushi bar, it was pretty much just me and Michael K here at the ~70 seats capacity sushi restaurant giving their menu a taste drive.

We started off with the usual limited to one per person orders: 
Uni, Sweet Shrimp and Blue Crab nigiri, they were good.  

We also gravitated towards their APPITIZERS section, and had ordered:
* Salmon Collar (the salmon was so tasty and naturally fatty, it was amazing, like having "Kobe" salmon) and Yellowtail Collar (cooked just right and I really enjoyed it with and without the accompanied ponzu dipping sauce)

* Yaki-tori (skewers): Bacon wrapped Enoki Mushroom, Bacon wrapped Quail eggs, Bacon wrapped Asparagus.  At other restaurants you can order just skewers, paired with responsible consumption of beer and sake and call a great night out.  I really enjoyed these.

* Shrimp Bomb (it is like the Jalapeno popper with shrimp and crab, but without the jalapeno).

* Miso Black Cod - tasty!  Insane in the membrane that this is in the AYCE line up!!!

* Tuna Poki - the poki are prepared to order, not something that was made hours ago and left marinating in the cooler.

* Yellowtail Poki

SPECIAL ROLLS:
* Star Fish (No Rice) made with Yellowtail Tempura, Daikon and wrapped in Tuna, finished with Wasabi Oil, Ponzu and Scallion.  (Recommended)

* Johny Roll (No Rice) made with Crab Meat, Shrimp Tempura wrapped in thin strip of cucumber and finished with Spicy Yum Sauce.

* Wild Fire Roll (No Rice) consist of Tuna, Spicy Tuna wrapped in Soy Paper, topped with Albacore and finished with Garlic Sauce.

* What's Wrong Roll (recommended by Chef Michael) made with Shrimp Tempura, Soft Shell Crab, Green Onions, Masago, Spicy Yum Sauce, topped with assorted fish and finished with Screaming Orgasm Sauce.

I could totally put away more food, but I have an appearance to make at Bacchanal the next day and thought I take it easy and just finished the meal with some Fried Banana with Ice Cream (it was a nice finish to the meal, but nothing that blows me away).

Totally satisfied and very impressed with the food we were served tonight.  There seems to be a handful of new sushi restaurants opening in Las Vegas recently, and most have had positive reviews thus far. So if the other freshmen sushi restaurants are as good as Daisho Sushi (which I now easily considered in my top 3 Las Vegas AYCE sushi restaurant list), the rest of the old guards will have good competition to keep everyone on their toes.  That is good news for all the diners out there.

Note:  Aside from AYCE sushi, Daisho also offers a la carte items for lunch and dinner in addition to their lunch and dinner specials.  And dinner starts from 4pm until closing.  Pricing are very competitive for AYCE (especially lunch, which does not seem to have a reduction in the selections available).

About the Chef: (kernels of knowledge gleamed from small talk during our meal)
Chef Michael is from New York. His parents own a Japanese Ramen, Yaki-tori (Japanese skewers) and Sushi restaurant there.  So even before moving out to Las Vegas and working as one of the sushi chefs at Blue Ribbon Sushi (inside The Cosmopolitan), he was already familiar with the competitive restaurant business. So finally opening Daisho Sushi here in Las Vegas, just seems like the natural path of progression for this passionate young chef in a new city he now calls home.  (Haha, I sound like his autobiographer).


5 stars!  But as words spread and more and more people learn about Daisho Sushi, and the restaurant undoubtedly gets busier, I hope they can keep up with the projected increased interest in their restaurant and the food they serve.  Good luck Daisho Sushi!!!  And I will definitely be back and bringing friends to tryout the amazing food I had earlier tonight.

So, somehow, I had never heard of this place. I can't even recall how I stumbled onto it. Probably when Googling something like, "top places in Arizona that make you feel like you're dining in the movie 'The Secret Garden'". Or something like that.

This place is spec.tac.u.lar (said like Kevin Spacey from American Beauty).

My friend and I just kinda went on a whim on a Thursday night, not knowing what to expect. I didn't realize the menu was prix fixe, but the hostess quickly filled us in on the details - $45 for a 3-course meal. Salad, entree, and dessert. Fine by us. We were greeted by extremely friendly staff and a delightful little patio, lit up by soft lighting and actual candles. Not that fake fire plastic cheesy bullshit. We were seated by a little fountain at a small table with a chair on one end, and then a 2-person couch on the other. Clearly meant for some type of romantic snuggling. A few minutes later, the owner, Christian, came by to chat with us a bit about the history of the place. He was very friendly and sincere.

Our server took our beverage orders and I said something along the lines of, "I dunno, gimme something fruity. No cucumbers". He brought back something perfect for both of us, and they were SKRONG drinks. I was already giggling like a schoolgirl. Luckily, the eggplant salad came out quickly after to soak up some of that alcohol. It was super unique; filled with diced tomatoes, olives, chunks of eggplant and a bunch of other tasty stuff neatly placed on a bed of greens. Oh, I should mention, their menu changes daily, so you get something unique every time you go. Not sure if it changes for lunch/brunch, but for dinner it does. The salad and dessert are the same, but you have 2 choices for entrees. It makes ordering very simple. My friend had the short ribs and I had the shrimp polenta. Our entrees followed quickly after the salad, both looking and tasting delightful. I honestly don't know what the Hell polenta is, but it was yummy. Everything was so fresh and simple, and being a bit of a cheap, uncultured person, I appreciate things that are simple. I had a bite of the short ribs as well - tender AF. Lastly, our desert came out. Simple as well. Just a lovely brownie with some ice cream and wait...HOD UP. Is this brownie toffee!?? Yes, it was a toffee brownie. I tried to be polite and take adorable girly bites, but fuck it. I ate that thing in like 5 seconds. Afterward, the chef himself stopped by to get our feedback on the food. He was a character. Funny, friendly guy who unfortunately told us he was moving back to San Diego in a month. But I'm sure whoever replaces him will be just as badass. I would expect nothing less at this point.

So after 2 drinks and a 3-course meal, I'd say yeah. We were pretty satisfied. Our bill came to about $120 total. Not what we had intended on spending, but certainly worth every penny. This place is really great for a romantic evening, a special occasion, and definitely a wedding. I haven't been for brunch or lunch yet, they've been booked up the past couple of Sundays sadly. But I can't wait to try it and write a novel on how I feel about it for your reading pleasure.

You're welcome.

Four stars for now, this place will almost certainly earn more as I return.  This is now my go-to margarita (particularly for the entirely reasonable $7) and the ($2! TWO!!! DOLLARS!!!) tacos were excellent as well.  I tried one of each taco - they offer steak, pork, fish, and seasonal veggie.  I think I'll go heavy on the steak and fish upon future visits - the pork taco had carmelized pineapple on it and was just a little too sweet for my taste.  The veggie taco was great, but not really my style.  

I was afforded a bite of the corn, which was lightly spiced and heavily sprinkled with some deliciously pungent powdery cheese.  I can't wait to get a cob of this for myself.  Very juicy, and flavorful.  I missed a taste of the other appetizer my table ordered - the fried cheese roll thing.  This is an almost airy roll of what must have been a cheese batter - I wonder what one would have to do to get a demonstration of how that thing was made - that looked fairly delicious, from my point of view.  The guac was quite tasty, although I don't know that I would call it the best I've ever experienced.  I enjoyed the salsas that were offered nearly as well.  The chips were a slightly thicker variety, with a great fresh crunch and good flavor of their own.  

The service was a bit hectic - our waiter had some help that seemed to come at random times and I wasn't totally sure they were helping him out as much as confusing everyone.  Given that it's a new restaurant, apparently a waiter was out for some reason, and the fact that nothing actually offensive or problematic occurred, I won't dock stars, but I expect this aspect to improve on my next visit.  Perhaps we won't invite 8 people who each expect separate checks next time and it won't be a problem (but what fun would that be?).  

The ambiance - I liked the design of the place, although it would be nice if they had a slightly larger TV above the bar, and the layout is a little.... interesting, with the bar area right near the lobby and all.  The main seating area looked like a more compelling place to enjoy a leisurely meal, with large windows, some bench seating along the wall, and a better division of space.  

All told, I really enjoyed my experience here, both food-wise and every entertaining second of the conversation.  I'm excited to return again and again (the corn, dessert, a torta, the cheese appetizer, perhaps breakfast?) I can hardly wait, in fact.

Nourish is one of those places I recently found that I'm hesitant to share on Yelp because I selfishly don't want them to get so crowded that I'll have to wait for a table when I go... 

A friend of mine who lives in the Optima told me about "this new healthy restaurant that opened up" recently, and I couldn't wait to try it. Jared and I went in for dinner last Friday night and were both extremely pleased... we both loved the casual environment, friendly service, and of course the incredibly fresh and healthy food.  

We worked up an appetite by taking a bike ride prior to our visit and we were both starving when we arrived.  We pretty much ordered one of everything on the menu.  OK... that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but we did have the following:

1 x chunky sweet potato and avocado salad - (one of my favorite things that we tried)
1 x quinoa salad 
1 x confetti veggies of the day 
2 x seared sashimi-grade ahi tuna 
1 x salmon burger with peppered air-fried, no oil, sweet potato fries
1 x steamed teriyaki wild rice bowl with chicken
2 x flavored water of the day (it happened to be blackberry that night)

And as if that wasn't enough food for our first visit, we ended up purchasing two orders of quiche so we would have breakfast the next morning... and guess what? We finished everything we ordered and enjoyed it all!

To top off the experience, we got a chance to meet Kirstin, the owner, and she was extremely sweet.  She told us about how she came up with the idea for the restaurant and all of the planning and hard work that went into it.  Judging by our experience that night and the reviews so far, Kirstin's work is paying off... 

Jared actually went back for lunch today and I was jealous!  But I am excited to go back to "nourish" myself very soon.  

A few additional notes:
*There is a bar with plenty of outlets set up so bring your computer and have a working lunch... they've got WiFi too!
*There is a long list of wine, beer, and cocktails.
*Parking is kind of annoying... park underground and walk up.
*There is a dog friendly patio!
*They are closed on Mondays.
*They offer personalized healthy meal plans.
*Catering is also available.

The food is outstanding but you have to wait for it. Is it worth it?

The Oyster Bar is inside the Palace Station Casino. The bar only has 18 seats. 

We got here at 8:30 pm on a Monday thinking we could avoid the infamous wait. No such luck, eleven people ahead of us in line. The line did not move for 40 minutes. When it finally moved, it went quick. At the one hour mark, we got seated. Yay. 
Well not so fast. 

After you're seated, you're given a sourdough roll and butter. Thank you, thank you thank you. We were starving and that helped a lot. A few minutes go by and they take our order. We waited so long I memorized what we wanted a half an hour ago lol. 

40 minutes later our soup comes out. 
An hour & 15 minutes from being seated we got the oysters. 
At the two hour mark from being seated we got our entrees. 
3 hour 15 minutes from waiting in line to finishing our meal. 
Was it worth it?

Here's the rundown:
New England Clam Chowder - Delicious. The bowl was full of clams and the soup was just outstanding. 

Oyster (a dozen) - was so so good. Cocktail sauce, horseradish and lemon accompanied the oysters. One of the best oysters I've ever had. The chef was having problems with one of the oysters (didn't want to stay in the shell) we were playfully teasing him about it and he was such a sport about it. We all had a good laugh and he put an extra oyster in for us. A bakers dozen, all delicious. 

Plaza Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab, chicken and andouille sausage. It's my first pan roast and it was delicious. The brandy and cream was a good combination. All the proteins were cooked perfectly. I specially liked the andouille sausage, a little hint of spiciness worked well with the broth.  I got a number 7 on the heat scale. It was not spicy for me at all. I could not finish my bowl, it was so rich and I had a lot of oysters. Lol. I will have a good lunch tomorrow for sure. 

I was also able to taste the following dishes. 
Combo Pan Roast - it had shrimp, crab and lobster. My Mom's choice. Zero on the heat scale. It was as good as mine. Tasted the lobster and that was very good. Good amount of it too. Lol. 

Bouillabaisse - was so good. My brother's dish. 7 on the heat scale. It was spicy. Ouch. But it was really good. The broth was clean and very flavorful. It had shrimp, crab, lobster, mussels & clams. Great broth. I would get this next time. 

Service was excellent. The chef was friendly and entertaining. 

The wait. It didn't bother me at all. It was more entertaining than anything else. I got to talk to other people waiting in line and making fun of the situation we were in. I even got to meet a couple of local Yelpers and she told us about a Korean/Mexican fusion restaurant (Komex). The 3 hours went by really fast. 

It's an experience I won't soon forget and isn't that why we go to these places and go through all the hoops. Lol
Was it worth it?
I say Yes!!

We had great service
We had great food. 
We had great conversations
We had a memorable night. 

I'll definitely be back

Of all hotels we've stayed at in Las Vegas, Bellagio remains our favorite.  From our first stay here in late 1998 to our visit a few weeks ago there are many things to love. But there are also flaws to keep this well shy of five stars.  

Still, our advice would be if you're making your first or only trip to Las Vegas, spring for a room at Bellagio on the fountain side in the Resort Tower (not the Spa Tower), making sure you're on the 17th floor or above in this 36 floor property.  We did this this on our first stay.

If you're not interested in seeing the fountain and lights on the strip, a room overlooking the pools (with the same advice about floor location) is also a good choice.  Same rooms with lower rate.  We chose these on the 22nd floor this time.

GOOD THINGS:

1. AMBIANCE / DESIGN PUBLIC AREAS:  From the breathtaking Dale Chihuly glass sculpture Firori di Como (flowers of Como as in Italy which was original Bellagio owner Steve Wynn's inspiration) on the lobby ceiling to the seasonally changing garden in Bellagio's glass enclosed conservatory to the artful woodwork in public spaces, this is for our money the most beautiful and tastefully restrained of all Las Vegas casino hotels.  We love walking through the shopping plaza and looking up to see glass elements that change seasonally and are suspended overhead.  Public spaces are nicely accessible to folks using wheelchairs or pushing strollers.

2. GUEST ROOMS: The 2011, $70M update of the Resort Tower guest rooms was much needed but these have always been some of the best sized rooms on the strip for the price paid.  They are appointed with comfortable chairs, a desk, wifi that is fast (but not free), top end electronics and lighting, the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in at any hotel anywhere and large bathrooms with lovely bath products. 

3. GAMING:  Casino is big enough to have all the gaming tables and machines laid out in a way that makes it easy to get to them.  From $10 blackjack tables to high roller rooms, they have it all covered. 
 
4. STAFF:  The valet staff, bell staff and housekeeping staff have always been very helpful and friendly. Same with staff on the casino floor. .

5. SECURITY:  Room card keys are checked by security staff before guests enter elevators to the rooms.  Security personnel roam guest room halls in the evenings. 

6. LOCATION:  At about mid strip, the location is perfect.  An easy walk up to Wynn or Palazzo or Venetian. Caesars is roughly next door on one side and Cosmpolitan on the other with Paris across the street.  A tram connects Bellagio to City Center shops and to Aria (also owned by MGM as is Bellagio). 

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:

1. $25 "RESORT FEE PER DAY: Applied to all rooms, hypothetically for wifi and access to the exercise room but is simply a way to up room rates.  

2. ACCESSIBILTY ISSUES -  GUEST ROOM LOCATIONS:  Bellagio has not put wheelchair accessible rooms on the best location fountain side of the building even though the  1990 Federal Civil Rights law of ADA requires accessible rooms to be distributed in all locations so people with disabilities can enjoy the same inclusion as do all others.  MGM, Bellagio's owner, has been sued for similar problems at the MGM Grand to result in compliance.  They know better.  But some hospitality entities hold a strategy of waiting to be sued at each hotel property before ADA compliance.   It was a nosebleed for my friend when she needed an accessible fountain side room for her father in law here this year.  Just a "heads up" if you need an ADA compliant room and want fountain view.  However, all rooms and bathrooms have lots of clear floor space for accessibility if you can forego grab bars and seated showering. 

3. RESERVATIONS - CHECK IN - POST CHECK OUT PROBLEMS:  All three couples in our party this time had problems making and revising reservations as online systems weren't working,  Neither were the systems when we called to do this by voice.  Check in took a very long time, again due to systems problems.  In each event, the staff involved acted as if they were doing us a favor.  And when my friend discovered after check out that he'd left a piece of luggage in his room, customer service staff was indifferent about helping him.  That luggage was gone for good.

THIS N THAT:

FOUNTAIN: The music choreographed water fountain in the 8 acre sized lake that fronts Bellagio goes on about 2P every afternoon  at maybe at 30 minute intervals, and the last show is about midnight.   Street level viewing is great and a good place to also watch is from the outdoor patio of Mon Ami Gabi at Paris across the street.

JEAN PHIILLIPE:  The main location of this pastry, chocolate and gelato purveyor is at Aria and worth the free tram ride there to indulge. But the smaller location off the Bellagio lobby has many of the same delights. Worth standing in line here to buy them.  The calories consumed in Las Vegas don't count!

Some decent 'Que on my side of town!

I'll admit, I had to check out this place after it was featured on "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives" on the Food Network.  But without this tidbit, I might have never knew the place existed!

Funniest thing about John Mull's is that it is basically located in the middle of residential homes.  Yes!  When you GPS the address you might think you're being led to the wrong place.  But keep truckin' because the BBQ joint is on property of what looks to be a ranch house.  John Mull's eating area shares the common space with what is essentially a butcher block.  Get a whole cow, some eggs, and then a meal of BBQ afterwards?  I don't see why not.

While the market has been around for some time, my review basically goes over the BBQ station.  It used to be just a shack when they first started, lately I hear they have a small food truck type deal to serve folks as well.  They need the help, John Mull's can get busy for lunch!  Typically it's take-out, but they do have a small seating area with about a dozen bench tables or so.  If it's full, eat it out of your truck tailgate like most folks do!

I am not an expert on BBQ by any means, but good food I can do.  Sure, you have your naysayers that go on and on and on about how their BBQ sauce is from a bottle (I can confirm I think it is), but really I don't care.  The meat itself is not artificially processed.  Trimmed in-house, and smoked in-house!  Flavor of the BBQ is what is necessary!  John Mull's makes some mighty decent 'Que.  Easiest thing on the menu to try if you're a noob to this place is just to go with a combo meal.  A 2 Meat Combo will run you about $14, and a 3 Meat Combo will run about $16.  When it's the wifey and I we usually opt for the 3 Meat Combo and share.  Be careful, it's a lot of food!  The 3 Meat Combo will easily feed a third person.  

Combos come with your choice of meats and sides.  Meats include:

-Hot Link
-Brisket
-Ribs
-Pulled Pork
-Pulled Chicken
-1/4 Chicken

Their strength lies in their ribs and brisket I think.  I like their pulled pork, but if I'm having their ribs (which I always do) I compliment it with the brisket.  The ribs are cooked just right, requisite pink ring around the outside, meat pulls off the bone (but not too easily), super moist and tender, finished on the grill with a slathering of BBQ sauce right before serving.  The brisket is flavorful, and just plain juicy, thanks to the lovely fat cap that surrounds each one before smoking.  OK, if you just say 'brisket' when you order your meat, you will most likely just get the lean end of the brisket.  Which is not dry, but not as near darn tasty as the fatty end.  So be specific on which part of brisket you want, lean or fat.  I will usually ask for a 1/2 portion of both.  

For sides, Road Kill Grill has some options too:

-Potato or Macaroni Salad
-Coleslaw
-Baked Beans
-Mac & Cheese
-Green Beans

Unfortunately, no collard greens or black eyed peas!  But you can't have everything.  I will mention that the green beans are just mainly reheated from the can, so I mainly skip that.  The baked beans are very good, and their mac & cheese is actually pretty stellar.  I also enjoy their potato salad.

Combos and meals come with slices of white bread if you request, but don't forget to ask!  It won't always come with it included.  Also, get some extra BBQ sauce!  I know the sauce may be bottled, but they let it simmer on the side most of the day, so the flavor does concentrate nicely.  The hot BBQ sauce has a nice kick so watch out.  Kaboom!  It's overall great eats, just don't forget extra napkins and extra wet wipes!  It will get messy.  Which one of you city people eat BBQ with a knife and fork?  That's what the white bread is for!

Another item I usually order when we eat at Road Kill Grill is a sandwich.  They load these suckers nicely so you get a nice portion of meat and sauce to bread.  Basically a meal in itself!  I enjoy the hot links sandwich in particular.  This with extra hot BBQ sauce on top, and a side of coleslaw?  Classic.  

BBQ can be a very picky topic, so you will see tons of varying reviews on John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill.  This is because depending on what side of the country you are from, you have a different taste of what BBQ should be.  Some like tomato based, some like vinegar based, some like mustard based, and so forth and so forth.  Some folks like more smoke, some folks like less smoke, Hell, some folks like their BBQ baked in an oven instead.  But no matter what, we all like good food.  And I think Road Kill Grill overall has good food.

Give them a try for yourself.  You might like, but then again you might NOT like.  Many reviews for this place are in the 3 or 4-star range, I tracked over to the 4-star area because I like it here.  In a place like Las Vegas it's difficult to find good 'Que that's not from a place like Famous Dave's or Memphis Championship BBQ.  Nuff' said.

While waiting on a phone order of sweet potato fries from Gallagher's yesterday, I discovered a restaurant on the other end of the block sporting a "Grand Opening" banner (where Moe's Southwest Grill used to be).  Yay!  Another venue offering soul food with candied yams on the menu!!  Since none of the employees could answer my food allergy concerns that afternoon, I'd have to call the next morning.

Earlier today I was able to get my food issues cleared and decided I'd have a late lunch (or early dinner) of BBQ platter with three meats (choice of beef brisket, chicken on the bone, pulled pork, or rib tips).  I ordered the meats dry since the BBQ had allergens.  Dinners come with two sides and cornbread, so I chose candied yams and brown sugar baked beans and asked that the cornbread be packaged to go.

(Before I placed my order, I asked if I could sample the meat since the last time I tried BBQ meats on the dry side, I found them quite tasteless; the cook was more than happy to hand me a sample of the brisket.)

Liked the brisket; the meat was so tender and moist and  tasted like a smoky version of corned beef.  The chicken was good, too, but the meat was still red and slightly raw when I sliced into it for a peek underneath.  I showed it to the server who started to say that the chicken is usually served that way, but she took it back for more time in the oven when I asked.  Unfortunately, the chicken was very charred when it was returned to me.  I was able to salvage most of it after scraping the burnt skin off.  While the first two meats were delicious on their own, w/o BBQ sauce, the rib tips did not fare so well.  I liked the texture of the meat, but it definitely could use more complexity. 

While I was able to determine that the dessert menu (outside source so info on ingredients wasn't easily available) is pretty much off-limits to me, I am not in the least disheartened...  The candied yams and brown sugar baked beans (both made from in-house recipes) were so delectable and sweet, they're almost like dessert, but with added benefits- vitamins, fiber, and protein!  Mmm... LOVED the spices used to flavor the yams.  Yes, there are the usual suspects of butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar, but I detect something else... almond extract!  Go and have a try yourself and see if you can help me detect what these flavors are :)  And the baked beans!  Red peppers and hatch green chilies really make this side dish sing!  

Beans, beans, the musical fruit...  

Breakfast menu is served all day [steak and eggs, biscuits and gravy (thickened w/ cornstarch), scrambles, and country burritos, to name a few], and lunch and dinner menus [fried chicken and (Belgian) waffles, burgers, wings, BBQ tacos and wraps, sandwiches and po'boys, chicken fried steaks, etc.] start at 11a.  I'm already looking forward to taking my grandmother and cousin here on my next weekend off!

Notes to owners/manager:  

1.This easily could've been a four-star review, but I thought it poor form to send back a badly-charred chicken.  I didn't think it was wrong of me to send back the bloody leg... (Ring!!  "Hello, Salmonella poisoning, How may I hurt you?") 

2. I was told that the addition of sweet potato fries is being considered- please don't take too long to decide Yes! :D 
(With a good dusting of cinnamon-sugar, please!)

3. Please change your font printing on the front and back take-home menu covers.  The current choice (white print on black and superimposed on a white background) is almost illegible.

4. Kudos on having DEDICATED fryers for your fried fish (batter contains corn), chicken, and other meats (fried pork chops and chicken fried steaks)!!  Not only do dedicated fryers limit the flavor transfers of these varied meats, but they also benefit your patrons that may have food allergies (fish, spices, and other ingredients).

I guess my expectations were a bit too high for such an expensive place.

We made reservations for our anniversary dinner. In general, my dining experiences surround casual dining establishments. Low key, relaxed atmosphere, friendly wait staff, the type of place that will stop for a minute or two to have a conversation instead of go through a check list. Serve bread, bring water, fork on the left, soup spoon above the plate, ask about appetizers, talk about specials, etc., etc. I got the feeling that this was a stuffed shirt type of place, and while I *was* wearing a tie that evening, I wasn't expecting a by the book, average service with our $50 meals.

Where to begin? I hate that this is basically going to be a check list of everything that went wrong, but here goes.

- requested olive oil for the table bread which took about 15 minutes to arrive. 
- the drinks we ordered took 20+ minutes to arrive.
- wifes steak wasn't cooked to order. The waiter asked if she wanted it butterflied to be sure it was cooked to order, she said yes. It was not butterflied and started bleeding when she cut into it.
- we ordered a side of brussel sprouts that didn't actually come out with the meal.
- I had to remind the waiter that we didn't get our brussel sprouts
- the sauted brussel sprouts and bacon tasted mediocre and came with crunchy bacon bits, not bacon - I've had way better and for a lot less $$.
- the steamed vegetables (a carrot and snow peas by the way) went through more of a blanching than a steaming and were basically raw veggies.
- option of baked potato, mashed potato, and potato au gratin as your included side, how much potato do you think I eat?
- run of the mill steak house music playing over the speaker system.

My expectations were that I would get an amazingly delicious meal, nice friendly evening, perhaps some live ambiance music, a waiter who remembered what we ordered without a reminder, and service that happened a bit faster. I understand that kitchen problems aren't the fault of the wait staff, but I assumed at the cost of these meals, the waiter staff would notice a missing side dish, and a steak that wasn't butterflied.

If you care to know, yes we did mention the foul ups with the food order, they did comp the brussel sprouts, they did cook the steak a bit longer, the manager came to the table to apologize, and we did receive complimentary desserts. Although the desserts were complimentary because of our anniversary and not the foul ups; not that I was fishing for free stuff. I certainly appreciate the apologies and effort put in to correcting what went wrong. I was generally expecting a *nice* place like this to be on their game the entire night and was soured by the overall experience.

Donovan's sure knows how to make a special evening, well, not so special.

UPDATE: Someone (who just joined Yelp btw) sent me an extremely abusive email via Yelp re: my negative review. Whoever this person is, firstly, doesnt speak/write english properly, and secondly, makes threats that are ridiculous (I.e Tina will kick my ass if I ever went back to her cafe?!) Are you kidding me?! First of all, i will never ever go back there, unless I'm needed by the Health Dept. to testify against this establishment, and second, don't ever threaten me, especially when I'm giving my honest opinion. Have you heard of freedom of speech? Sounds like Tina has a posse, but that is all she'll ever have when she loses her business due to dubious business practices! 

Hands down, absolutely the worst dining experience I've ever had. We only stayed because we were already there, and I had purchased a Groupon, wow what a waste. We sat down, and weren't even acknowledged for at least 10min. Then, the menus came about 20min later. So, about 30min of total wasted time. Maybe they were hoping we would read the disgustingly dirty book that was on the table on Ethiopia? It's a great idea, until you realize it's not practical at all for a restaurant. Forget that our copy was from 1964. I'm sure even Ethiopia has changed since then. 

Moving on to the ambiance/decor. Absolutely, disgusting and dirty. It's old, owner's kids were playing in and out of the kitchen (hello??), the kids' high chair (which was a regular high chair, not a restaurant style) was so disgusting, I had no idea what to do with my baby. 

Food. OMG. The amount of food you get is meager. I'm not kidding. It's a tiny little portion, probably about 3 tablespoons? It came out cold and it looked like someone had thrown it up. I had ordered the biggest plate that combined most of the foods (which by the way, there are only 15 on the menu, and they were out of 4 of them), and my husband had ordered his own plate. After we patiently waited for the food, the server (who had no idea what was going on) came out and asked us if it's ok for them to put my husband's order on my plate. What? Why? But we said "fine" b/c frankly, we wanted to just leave! In any case, the amount of my food was reduced by what my husband's food took up as space, which is not much, believe me. The quality of the food was just subpar. Cold, not tasty and lacking in meat.The "bread" was wet and sour, and I don't believe that's how ethiopian bread is. Some entries were beef and chicken, but you wouldn't have known it if it wasn't indicated on the menu. There were probably 2-3 TINY pieces of chicken/beef over all, I'm not kidding. (I wonder if it's b/c I told them we had a Groupon in advance, and they just gave us a tiny amount of cold food with no apparent presence of meat.) 

Service was just horrible, and the girl (was she the owner, or maybe the owner's daughter?) who waited on us at first, had no people or service skills. The boy who came in late apparently, was out second server, and he mentioned it was his second day, so he had absolutely no idea what to do. It was so sad to watch, really. The woman was just awkward. I wondered if there was something behind the scenes (in the kitchen) we weren't aware of, that was making the people working there completely incapacited. I also thought that if this restaurant can survive, anyone can be in the restaurant business apparently. 

I have traveled a lot, and am open to and love other cultures (I, myself, am not American), but this was by far not a tolerable or pleasant experience in any way. Looking at their website, you would think they are a well-established and clean business  but make no mistake, they are absolutely not. I am actually surprised they are still operating, and have a license. My husband and I wondered how long they will stay open, he gave them a month (but I have no idea how long they've been open for already.) Either way, we will NEVER ever go back there and waste another dollar. Please don't waste your money.

I have been back several times before writing this review update just to make sure all the inconsistency that I have been experiencing is now the way of Bagel Cafe and not just an off day they were having. I'm prepared for the loyal fixtures to be upset, but if you really have been eating here since it opened then you know it's not the same. I first started eating here at Bagel Cafe (I was a teenager) after it opened. It was worth the long wait to get a table as the food was spot on excellent. Sure we all know the best breakfast in town is at the Omelet House on Charleston, but this place definitely came close behind at one point. In the last 6 months I have experienced meals here at Bagel Cafe that were just not worth the money or wait for what you got. They don't even use Boar's Head deli meats anymore! WTH?!?!?!? They use some brand I have never heard of. The taste and quality of the deli meat just isn't the same as it used to be. They claim the bagels are made fresh daily yet they are rock hard. I have never liked the bagels here, but if it's in your name.... live up to it!

As you can tell from my previous review and pictures, I really used to like this place. Consistency is a major issue. The sandwiches used to be made with Boar's Head deli meat and was piled high between the bread of your choice and a real winner. Now you get some other brand of meat just bunched up in a ball between 2 dry pieces of bread. I can do that at home! Then there is breakfast. I usually order breakfast here. The last 3 times the coffee has tasted bitter and nasty. Getting a refill was a major chore as well. I noticed the servers didn't have name tags on my last visit or I would give a proper shout-out to the waitress who has messed up my order lately and has terrible customer service. I ordered "One Egg any style W/Bacon" priced at $8.95 and asked for eggs to be scrambled with shredded cheddar cheese on top. Such a simple breakfast right? Apparently not For Bagel Cafe. The breakfast also came with a bagel of my choice and breakfast potatoes. When my food arrived I noticed there was a slice of cheddar cheese on my eggs. UGH! If you don't have shredded cheese just let the customer know so they can maybe make another choice. I would have had the egg over medium or easy to dunk my bacon in if I had known. The "Asiago" bagel I had was so tough and hard!  I was with another yelper one of my last visits and showed him how I was able to bang the bagel on the table and it just broke in pieces.  The bacon was terrible. From the picture it looks heavenly, but let me tell you it was rock hard and seemed like it was honestly pulled from the fridge or something. When my meal arrived the bacon was missing, so I informed our waitress and she replies to me "oh did you want bacon?" to which I'm like HELL YES why would I have ordered a breakfast that comes with it if I didn't want it? She then brings me the cold/hard bacon and when the receipt comes she charged me $3.50 for a side of bacon. Seriously? It was supposed to come with the breakfast I ordered. She made me feel like I had done something wrong when she actually is a very lousy waitress. The potatoes I had were the only thing edible on the plate and even those aren't the same potatoes as they have had in the past. With this place not being consistent and having waitresses who can't do their job right, I'm going to  BabyStacks Cafe and Omelet House from now on for breakfast and will make the drive to Henderson to eat at Weiss.

I just literally got back from there and I have mixed emotions. I would say my experience was bittersweet. Let me explain.

What is it about bacon that makes everything good? The saltiness? The greasy goodness? Maybe its the fact that it is really not good for you that it makes it taste that much better. Well, the fact that this place has a bacon theme is what sold me.

With that said, I came with my wifey to check it out. I ordered The Cure and she ordered the Man Candy. We also got the Garlic Parmesan Fries because I love garlic. Then, we capped it off with dessert by getting the Panookie.

The Cure (13.95). Pork Belly with 2 Fried Eggs and Tomato Jam on a French Baguette. 
This entre was a bit overwhelming. First off, it is very messy, as soon as you pick it up, you have grease and/or egg yolk running down your arms. The pork belly itself was more belly than pork. A lot of fat with some slivers of actual pork. It tasted decent, but a lot of the fat turned me off.

Man Candy (6.95). Glazed Bacon with Cayenne accompanied by Maple Syrup to dip it in. 
Now this masterpiece is a magnificent piece of art that has been placed in a jar for your eyes to feast on. Dip it in the syrup and you will be in bacon heaven. Now this entre alone is worth the trip just to come here. I recommend getting this no matter what you or your party decides on getting. 

Garlic Parmesan Fries (4.95). French Fries sprinkled with grated Parmesan Cheese and Garlic Powder.
Now this I was a bit disappointed. To me, if you are going to serve the best Garlic Parmesan Fries, use real bits of garlic and sliced parmesan/romano cheese. The best I have had is at another restaurant that I will not mention out of respect for these guys. Message me if you are interested in that place.

Panookie (5.00). A niced sized Cookie baked in a aluminum dish topped off with Whipped Cream, Ice Cream and Chocolate Syrup.
It's exactly as described. Ours was a bit burnt on the bottom so it was a bit hard. I think it was a bit overcooked. It probably would of been great it it wasn't burnt.

Service was decent. Our server was on point with order taking, refills, etc. which it should of been because it was just us and another party of 2 she was serving.

Ambience: Since it's called "Bacon Bar", you have to picture a typical bar scene with people hanging out and of course, smoking. Even though we were seated in the "Dining Area", we weren't really sealed off from the smoke coming from the bar. So basically you will be inhaling second hand smoke guaranteed. At the bar you have to be 21. But you can bring your kids to the dining area. Now this to me is a big negative. You and your party will be exposed to secondhand smoke.

So my 3 star rating is a bit generous since my original thought were 2 stars. Like I mentioned earlier, the Man Candy alone warrants a visit here. For you not so bacon lovers, they have other things like Pizza, Wings, Pasta, etc. for your other dining options so bacon doesn't have to be your default choice.  Also, they are open 24 hours which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. Next time I will try the Bacon Burger and I will see if it can be bumped up to 4 stars.

I apologize in advance for the length of this review, but if you are ever planning on being within a 100 mile radius of this place, I would recommend that you read it. 

It was my grandfather's birthday, so we decided to go to old town Scottsdale to have a nice dinner. He felt like Italian food, so we decided to try this place out. At the door, a man was greeting guests. Later, I realized he was the owner. He seemed nice at first, assuring me that he was getting a table ready for my family. We were seated and the first noticeable thing about the restaurant was the noise level. The waiter was literally screaming at our faces to get our orders. And I though HE was rude???! Things were somehow about to get wayyyyy worse.

Even though we were 6 people and a baby, we only ordered 4 dishes. My grandparents always share, and the baby can't exactly eat a full plate of lasagna and garlic bread. We started our meal with Minestrone, a "vegetarian" soup. I found a piece of sausage in my soup, which I cannot eat. It's not a big deal, but at that point the soup was inedible. The owner was passing by, so my father got his attention. He told him about the sausage and explained that we could not eat it. Instead of apologizing, this dude started lecturing us. "Stuff happens! I've owned this restaurant for 38 years and you expect me to be perfect? NNOO!" All I wanted was a simple "S-O-R-R-Y." Do people not teach that word to their toddlers anymore? It certainly wasn't in this guy's vocabulary. So, after he left, I exclaimed "Excuse me!" to my family and we began talking about how rude his behavior was. This guy, who I assumed was a waiter, heard me and we made eye contact. He then walked away.

A few minutes later, the owner returned. He then decided to give us another condescending lecture. "Well I saw your ticket and you are a party of 7 who only ordered 4 meals! I'm just sayin'. The soup is not a big deal- it happens once in a blue moon! Tomorrow is a new day and the sun will come up! I'm not gonna kill myself tryin' to make you people happy! I want to live a long life! BLAH BLAH BLAHHHHHH" My grandmother asked him if he was going to bring me another soup. He then, in a very patronizing tone, asked me if I wanted another soup. I refused, since I was almost finished with my soup when I discovered the sausage anyways. He then went on to say "I have 6 kids! I know that you need more food. Tell me what to bring and I'll bring it for you. You only ordered 4 meals. DOES ANYBODY HERE WANT A SOUP!!?!? " I have to say, I feel bad for those kids. They probably get whipped on a daily basis. He left after we all refused, as the waiter I mentioned before smirked. We had had enough. We decided to leave while we still could. As we began to exit the table, the waiter saw us and realized what was happening. He came by and asked "Is everyone leaving here?" We said yes and continued to leave. "I don't like being insulted like that," my father told him. "Oh yeah?? Insulted? You only had 4 meals on your ticket! Now that's insulting! You can't even afford enough food to feed your family! This is MY restaurant! I'm done with you people! GO- GO! Keep moving! GET OUT OF HERE!! STOP THEIR MEALS!" he yelled. At this point, I was worried that he was going to get physical. I decided this spawn of Satan could only be the owner's son.

We continued walking out of the restaurant, our jaws hanging open.The owner was at the door greeting his friends and regular costumers (how does he even have any of those??)  He then started yelling at my father! "You can't even afford seven meals! I'd rather you people leave!" Now, my father was mad. "I'm a cardiologist! I can afford a meal! Do you expect the baby to eat a full meal???" The owner replied, yelling and following my family as we turned from the restaurant, with "A cardiologist? Oh, and I'm an astronaut! I'm going to the moon tomorrow!" This dude certainly seemed high enough to get to the moon. "Just don't end up in the ER!" my father said. 

I was shaking after this incident. This dude needs to be in a mental hospital. His son can be his cellmate. I have a weird feeling he's going to send the mafia after me after he sees this review, but I don't really care. I need to preach out to people DO NOT GO HERE! THE OWNER IS A CRAZY LUNATIC! RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN! I seriously hope this place burns down. It would make the world a much better place.

I went to Del's with my girlfriend on the night of the Restaurant Impossible relaunch, eager to see how the show transformed it. While hectic, the night was a lot of fun and the food was reasonably tasty. The menu was small (as is usual on relaunch night), but had plenty of good choices. There were some high points- the mozzarella sticks, garlic bread and biscotti. As for dinner, I had an average chicken cacciatore, while my girlfriend had chicken parmigiana that was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. She was happy enough with it that she was looking forward to having it again.

The servers were enthusiastic and accommodating, which was impressive considering everything they went through that day. As the night went on, we were both troubled when we overheard the owner complaining to regulars that the show had forced her to severely shrink her menu. She pledged to go back to the old menu once things were back to normal. I couldn't help but wonder why. After all, if you appear on Restaurant Impossible, isn't that a pretty glaring sign that something is wrong with your current menu?

About three months later, we figured that it was time to go back with a couple of friends. As expected, the smaller menu was gone and the bloated original menu was back, plus a few of the Restaurant Impossible dishes. I was dumbfounded by the breadth of choices. In addition to the long list of entrees, Del's also offers pizza and 12 kinds of pasta that can be combined with 13 different sauces. I can't help but think that our meal would have been better if the menu was tightened up.

We started with mozzarella sticks and garlic bread, the strongest parts of the meal. The mozzarella sticks were a tad overdone, but were still very tasty, especially with the accompanying tomato sauce. The strong garlic bread was a welcome change of pace from what often passes for garlic bread elsewhere. Unfortunately, my French onion soup was middling at best. In addition to being very sweet, it had an unappetizing layer of oil on top of the melted cheese. My girlfriend and buddies found their iceberg salads to be mediocre.

The meal continued to go downhill with the entrees. I had gnocchi with butter and garlic sauce. The butter and garlic sauce was flavorful and strong, but the gnocchi were dense and slightly chewy. My girlfriend, pleased with her chicken parmigiana on our first visit, ordered it again and was severely disappointed. The chicken was buried in sauce. I tried it and agreed- the breading was a soggy mess, while the chicken was drier and tougher than on our first visit.

The desserts that we saw floating around looked very good, but we were all far too stuffed from dinner to try anything. Del's portions are huge, which they charge accordingly for. As it is, I think the large portions are meant to counteract the middling quality of the food. Three out of the four of the people in our party had enough leftovers for another full meal.

The restaurant itself is still bright and clean, just as it was on relaunch night. Service was well-paced, friendly, and honest. The food and menu need work, though. Cut out some of the dead weight on the menu and give the staff the opportunity to focus on creating better quality dishes. I'm sure Del's doesn't want to shake things up too much for fear of losing their regulars... but if they fail to change, they're never going to create any new regulars.

Italian was my unofficial and official second major in college. I studied in Rome for three months and Florence for three months and went back several times after to experience the magic all over again. While I was there, I learned many things about Italian culture and solidified my language skills, but as you can imagine, the thing that I found the most exciting and educational was the Italians' relationship with food.  

Regardless of the region I was in, I found Italians united by shared beliefs about food preparation and eating, many of which were foreign to me prior to going. As an example, all the Italians I met took it as a given that: salad comes after a meal, not before it; fresh fruit is a dessert, not a snack or breakfast; alfredo sauce and mozzarella sticks are not Italian; alcohol exists to enhance the flavors of food, not to get drunk; and pepperoni is not thin slices of cured pork, but peppers - you know, the vegetables (this one blew my mind the most!). 

You get the idea. Of course, these guidelines come across to Americans as strict rules. We love our culinary freedom, and that makes sense - we have many different types of food, types of people, and types of lifestyles. Plus, Italian food changed a lot at the hands of the immigrants who came here. However, even if I'm not going to follow every guideline, I took from my experiences in Italy a sense of genuine appreciation for simple, fresh flavors, a desire to slow down and truly enjoy what I'm eating, and a greater awareness of the way that different dietary components come together to create a balanced diet and better internal functioning.

Since I got back, I've found few Italian restaurants that really embody these key principles, refusing to dumb down or speed up their food for the American masses. Well, Pizza A Metro is part of that elite category, and I'm thrilled to have found it here in Phoenix, just a short drive from our house. Maurizio makes it his goal to serve his customers fresh, simple, carefully-prepared food that allows the flavors of individual ingredients to shine. I appreciate that so much. 

We checked the place out for the first time last Friday night. We had made a reservation in advance, which was a great idea because we only had to wait 2-3 minutes to be seated once we arrived. We were promptly greeted by Maurizio and quickly had our drink order taken by the server. I was a little nervous about speaking Italian, since I'm pretty rusty, but I figured I should, since I haven't got many chances to do so in California, where I grew up, or here in Phoenix. So, when Maurizio returned with our bread basket and to take our order, I worked up my courage and ordered in Italian. Even though he was super-busy, Maurizio asked me a few questions back in Italian (where did I study, etc.) and continued to converse with us in Italian throughout the rest of the meal. It was so much fun for me to speak again, especially when the food was so delicious and really took me back to my study abroad time. 

We decided to start with the grilled calamari and then have the Penne Amatriciana and a medium Pizza Frescolina. The bread basket was phenomenal, with lightly oiled pieces of Italian flatbread with a cold mixture of eggplant, olives, and onions (almost like an Italian ratatouille). When the calamari arrived, we discovered that it was fried and not grilled (both are appetizer options; grilled is more prominent in Italy), but we decided not to say anything and eat it anyway. We were glad we did because it reminded me of the seafood "fritti misti" you get in Italy - just lightly battered with a hint of seasoning. It came with a tomato sauce, but it was delicious with just a squeeze of lemon. 

Our entrees were even more delicious. My pasta could have been a bit more al dente, probably because most Americans don't eat it that way, but no harm done - I'll just order it that way next time. The sauce was incredible and truly authentic. It perfectly combined fresh tomatoes, tender pieces of pancetta, onion, garlic, and olive oil without being too thick or sweet. The pizza was also to die-for with a thin, flour-brushed crust, small amounts of milky mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and arugula, and salty prosciutto. Just like Italian pies, all the flavors were balanced and no single one was overwhelming. So you know, the medium was huge and even with our huge appetite we ended up taking 3-4 slices home.

All in all, we only spent $30 or so and had an amazing, deeply satisfying meal that brought me back to my memorable time in Italy. I absolutely can't wait to go back and try more things (and practice my Italian again!).

Grand Opening for PoshBurger today!

I had very high expectations...but I was pretty disappointed truthfully 

Little things like the Raw Juices not working yet is acceptable as initial growing pains....Them not having highchairs or boosters for my little foodie dude...borderline acceptable...these things will be fixed in due time.

But a medium rare burger should not be difficult to achieve...especially if it isn't busy out front! The first bite...a well done burger. I sent it back, with apologies from the server and a manager intro. The manager said she would personally check up on the next burger, and to make sure it was done correctly the second time around.  Kobe burger :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/poshburger-bistro-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#4cJIHeKsw7583CsxztmIfw

First bite into the second burger...well done again. Are you serious? Well done, as in cooked 100% throughout. Not a hint of pink at all...the same as the first time. My company was already pretty much done with theirs, and we were running out of time, so I wasn't going to bother sending it back. The server checked on the second burger, saw it was overcooked again, and said she would get the manager.

Meals over...no manager. We get asked for dessert, we decline, and the check comes over....no manager, no discount, no mention about the poor cooking. I pay and get outta there...still no manager chasing me out the door to double check everything, especially being notified of the second time around. 

Keep in mind, this was a $30 hamburger. This is their top tier, most expensive plate they sell....they should be able to cook it right, especially after two tries. And for $30, I got meat that I couldn't tell was Kobe, Waygu, or Sirloin because it was overcooked. The foie gras was a sliver...about an inch wide, that didn't even cover half of the burger. Look closely for it :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/poshburger-bistro-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#QGfHECw6fQR6tXecvIfUhg

The quail egg was great...but small of course. It covered the half of the burger that had no foie gras....It's a $30 burger!! I don't want a half/half burger, but I guess that is what they are going for. There other burgers are probably fine...just don't waste your money on their Kobe burger!

Also, one other small rant....the dips were way too small! We got one small glass bowl that was about halfway filled up...for each set of fry!  Pic of the fries :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/poshburger-bistro-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#jU73XEy-7LnNiXZtTseeFw

I was afraid to ask for more, since it probably would have carried a $2 price tag, so I tried to spread the love out. Fill up the entire glass, or offer two with each fry!

The tuna tartar burger was good though! 

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/poshburger-bistro-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#McfVnw8B3SzaAW9zcVPJVg

Very light and refreshing with the asian slaw and wasabi aioli!  I love wasabi, so I kind of wish they went heavier on it, but we know others wouldn't like it that way! The tuna was cooked well, and had a nice consistency...not falling apart or overcooked.

With all that being said, the Kobe burger itself was great tasting, just felt like it should have been a whole lot closer to $18-20 than the $30 price tag.  

I never mind spending good money for a good burger...but double the size of the foie gras to compete with the other gourmet burger spots in town, or you won't last long selling them for the same money.  The flavor IS there, just cook it correctly, and give your paying customers a fair amount of topping...we are paying enough money for it.

I don't throw the following sentence out very often but when I do, I mean business so here it goes...I had the best sandwich I've ever eaten here. I am not exaggerating. So if you stop reading this review right this second, at least you know and now you can you get into the car, make your way to Mesa and try one for yourself. 

So on to the rest of the review. I've been lucky enough to have an Ike's sandwich in SF and couldn't believe my eyes when I found out they were moving to Arizona. Their location is a bit of a drive for me, but the sandwich truly makes it worth it. 

Here's how the experience works. This is a casual sandwich eatery where you can come in solo, order and take it to go, or dine in with a couple friends. Anything goes at Ike's. Now, when you walk in, you'll immediately be overwhelmed by a board listing off a variety of every sandwich combo imaginable and it's not your run of the mill sandwich combo. No way. It's a combo of everything good in life that's put in between two slices of bread and served either hot or cold, depending on your sandwich. I suggest looking at Yelp reviews, pictures and the menu before you arrive to avoid major menu anxiety like I experienced. Also, note that every sandwich has a hilariously funky name so you might get lost in translation just simply reading the names! 

Once you've made your sandwich selection, you'll order at the counter from one of the incredibly friendly staff and they are truly genuinely friendly! It was such a breath of fresh air to experience a sandwich at Ike's. The decor is just as fun and funky as the staff and sandwich choices and be sure to look on your napkin holder because it will tell you something pretty about you! 

Now on to the best part, the sandwich. I don't even know where to begin. First, they serve this special bread that typically can only be found in N. Cal and it's amazing. Cheese is baked into the bread. I tried the Bella which is their most popular and I'm not surprised. It's a combo of chicken that has been slow-cooked for several hours and then tossed in this delicious honey mustard. Then they top it with cheese, avocado and this special mayo spread. I suggest adding some hot sauce to it. It's served hot and it is large and in charge, so unless you're ready for a last supper meal you will probably have some left-overs or your might want to share. It's worth every single calorie consumed and then some. 

Now, although this is about a 15-20 minute drive from my house, I will absolutely be visiting on a regular basis and can't wait for them to open additional locations!

PS - if you get lost, it's across the street from the mall!

I stopped in here for dinner and wasn't disappointed. It's inside Doc Holliday's if you can really say that since it seems more of a next door neighbor to the bar. I figured I would be walking through the bar to get to Maribel's and you can, but the door I went into led me straight inside Maribel's. Hubby and I were greeted right away and told to sit wherever we wanted. Our server was excellent! She got our drink order and brought us some chips and salsa right away. I usually like chunky salsa and this salsa was thin, but it had a lot of good, fresh flavor and the chips were tasty. For $3.99 I ordered a side of Chips and Guacamole and my oh my was it so good! It was made fresh to order and had such great flavor. I'm very impressed at the price of the chips and guac considering it was fresh and the portion was good. If you are a fan of guacamole you must try it here at Maribel's! They have daily specials for just $5 that includes a drink. 

Monday - Chicken Enchiladas 
Tuesday - Carne Asada Tacos
Wednesday - Fish Tacos
Thursday - Carne Asada Burrito
Friday - Chicken Sub
Saturday - Shredded Beef Burrito
Sunday - Hamburger or Cheeseburger

I was there on a Tuesday, so I decided to go with the Carne Asada Tacos. You get 3 tacos, rice, beans and a drink. If you want flour tortillas you can also get that for no additional charge, but you get 2 tacos instead of 3 and our sever said they are bigger than the regular ones. Options are nice! The asada had good flavor and the tacos were filled nicely, especially for the price. The beans were good and the rice was even better. It's awesome that you can get quality food that tastes so good for $5 plus tax and leave stuffed. Inside was clean and they have TV's. I can't say enough about our server. She checked on us often and took the time to chit chat with us for a bit letting us know about other specials and I could tell she was genuinely passionate about the food being served here. They even take phone orders if you don't have time or want to eat inside. I saw several people picking up to-go orders. I don't live in the neighborhood that Maribel's is in, but when I am on this side of town, I will definitely be stopping by for some good grub!

3.68991234 stars.  I have some serious personal issues with spending as much as I did on Chinese food for 2.  I just imagine my Taiwanese mother looking at this menu and freaking over things like $18 stir fried noodles (with no meat nonetheless) and $28 for essentially 8 dumplings (albeit very good ones) .  But alas...happy wife, happy life!  She really enjoyed the dinner and preferred this over Tao.  I disagree.  

Don't get me wrong.  There were a couple of excellent dishes but it's simply the principle of paying this much for it that endlessly irks me.  So let's start with those:

OUTSTANDING DISHES:

Crispy Duck Salad:  My Hakkasan host recommended this dish to me a week before.  The server said it was her favorite thing on the menu.  Who am I to argue?  It was the best thing we had.  The duck was cooked perfectly and combining it with greens, pomegranate, pomelo and pine nuts made for a super tasty dish.  I am pretty sure I will order this every time I dine here.  It won't be many more unless I am getting comped but this is a MUST HAVE.  

Stir-fried Black Pepper Beef Ribeye with Merlot:  Love Me Tender.  Tender is the night.  Tender Love.  Time, Love and Tenderness.  Tenderoni.  I would've included "Try a Little Tenderness" but there was nothing little about this.  It was A LOT of tenderness.  Every freakin morsel was juicy and delectable.  I also liked that they included big pieces of garlic mixed in.  To fully enjoy this dish, you should order a side of jasmine rice for $2.  

DECENT:

Hakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter:  I won't go into the names of them all but there was shrimp, fish, scallop and duck.  The fish was ground up and then secured in a black squid ink wrap.  The scallop had a little ikura on top which was a nice touch.  I chose to eat the majority of these dumplings straight without sauce to get the full taste of it.  They offered 3 sauces with them but vinegar would have been nice as Yelper Cynthia C. mentioned in her review.

The cocktails were also decent but I forget the names of them.

DON'T EVEN BOTHER:

To sum it up, go for the stuff you can't get in a regular above average Chinese restaurant. 

Four Style Vegetable in sweet Szechuan sauce:  I didn't plan on ordering this but the server recommended it.  We had also been eating a little more unhealthy than usual that week so both of us thought a few veggies would help.  This was a joke.  The sweet and spice didn't work and the medley of asparagus, shimeji mushroom, yam bean (had the consistency of apple) and tofu was weird for me.  

Hakka noodle with mushrooms and Chinese chive: I was recommended this dish before coming and I got it even though I was still skeptical.  This would've been good if it were $5 but not $18.  

The food wasn't the only thing going on here.  I liked how the tables were sectioned off to handle small and larger parties.  The atmosphere was pretty chill at the time we were there (7pm Saturday) but I imagine it might get a little more rockin later in the evening.  The service was surprisingly excellent and our main server was incredibly nice.  They also offered some tasting courses that looked pretty interesting but you had to have a minimum of 4 to do it.  

I don't regret coming here but there are a lot of better options at this price point in the MGM like Craftsteak.

Now, I rarely ever write mediocre 3 Star reviews, but in my honest opinion, my tepid experience wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. With that said, here's the rundown of what transpired on the evening of July 4th... After reading rave reviews from friends and fellow Yelpers, i decided to choose Le Cirque to celebrate my best friend's birthday. The restaurant was bustling when we arrived. We were seated towards the back which was upsetting since I requested a window seat months in advance. A few tables were still vacant by the window, which I found puzzling. Moments later those same seats were filled with other patrons, same number of guests mind you, that came after us. Not a good start so far. 

Granted the place was busy, it's no excuse for the waiter to make us feel rushed. He seemed hurried and not warm yet he was quite efficient at taking our orders and whisking away in a flash.  He clumsily scattered our silverware on the table like we were dining at Denny's. Wait, even at Denny's our utensils are placed with more care than this jumbled mess.

We all went with the degustation menu at 135$ per person and the birthday boy went with the 88$ additional wine pairing, as well. With a bottle of French Pinot Gris on the table, we were good to go.

The breads weren't warm, but room temperature and very chewy. 
I went with the onion bacon and pretzel. The pretzel was salty and too tough to eat and the onion bacon was hard and practically indelible. 

Thankfully, our amuse bouche was a refreshing bite sized cucumber wrapped creme fraiche treat that awakened my palate perfectly. 

The first course was incredible.  It was a delicate langoustine osetra caviar carpaccio with crisp sliced green apples that simply made my taste buds pop at first bite. The contrasting textures and flavors went from tart to tangy to sweet and spectacular. A splendid first course.

Here's where it gets bad, again. The time period between the first and second course went from lengthy to uncomfortably long. Luckily I was in good company and we had pleasant conversation that helped pass the time but the extensive wait (30 minutes) was inexcusable.
We inquired with our server and he quickly rushed into the kitchen without responding to us. Moments later, our dishes came out from one of the support staff that appeared agitated and rushed, as well. What was going on here? There was plenty of staff standing around, yet the same few guys were running frantically around the small restaurant. Strange. 

The scallops were supple, buttery and exhibited an excellent mouthfeel.

The foie gras was magnificent. The combination with the sweet plump cherries was genius.

The fresh black truffle risotto was a huge disappointment, however. The risotto was undercooked and hard, which is not the consistency a good risotto should feel like. The only saving grace were the finely sliced black truffles sprinkled on top, that left a subtle yet heavenly aroma to this mediocre dish. At an additional 40$ supplement to the 135$ per person tasting menu, I expected better. I would have sent it back but refrained in fear of an even longer and more excruciating wait time.

The third courses were far more redeeming with the beautifully crusted cod that tasted like butter in my mouth and the sea bass that was simply heavenly
The John Dory was good but paled in comparison to the complex flavor profiles of the other two mind blowing dishes. 

The fourth dishes were fantastic, too. Namely the Kobe. It was literally melt in your mouth delicious. It came at an additional 65$ premium but it was well worth it. Divine in every way!

The duck was supple and the flesh was smooth and velvety soft. 

The rabbit was tasty but I couldn't help but feel it tasted like chicken.

The pre-dessert was bright and whimsical. A tequila lime sorbet with fresh grapefruit and poprocks was inventive, surprising, refreshing and a perfect palate cleanser

In regards to dessert, don't skip it. You would be making a huge mistake. With that said, you've gotta try the souffls here. They are perfect pillows of paradise in every bite. The chocolate was enticing but the vanilla grand marnier was irresistible! The ice sculpture berry sorbet dessert was inventive and incredibly refreshing, as well.

My friend received a birthday selection of mignardises and the ladies were presented with truffles neatly presented in Cartier inspired jewelry boxes. 

Thankfully the night ended on a positive note but in all honesty, for a restaurant of this caliber, I expected far more consistency in service than the inattentive and sloppy half-baked excuse for service we got last night. If it weren't for some of the incredibly amazing dishes, I would have given this place one star for the poor service alone.

If I were you, check out Picasso in the same hotel. They offer beautiful views, delicious five star quality dining coupled with exceptional service.

Happy Eats!

Looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant in downtown Las Vegas? Look no further.  La Comida has arrived.  

New restaurants are opening left and right in Las Vegas, especially in the downtown area.  One things for sure, La Comida is a refreshing change from your usual bar food, appetizers, and fried food.  Here at La Comida, you get authentic tasting Mexican dishes.  When you think of Morton's, their steakhouse, N9NE, Ghostbar, and Rain comes to mind.  And because this is a Morton's establishment, expect no less than quality, upscale, and great service. 

My first thought upon arriving here was "Wow".  Although this place was packed on their very first night, we were greeted by almost every staff member.  Smiles are free and we got them.  My second thought, another "Wow".  Las Vegas' who's who was here tonight.  I'm not going to mention names, but the energy was surely in the air tonight.  

There's seating indoors, at the bar, and at the patio outside.  The ambiance includes an attentive staff, wide open restaurant, and a ton of people watching.  Can you imagine this place on the weekend? This restaurant was extremely busy, but there's no rush once you're in and no one seems to be rushing you out.  In other words, this restaurant has a chill feel to it.

As for the food, you really can't go wrong.  Everything made here is authentic. The food was so authentic that I even had a tough time reading the menu.  But our lovely server, Camila, took the time to give us her recommendations and even gave me a short Spanish lesson. My main dish was their Carne de res a la Parrilla (beef skirt steak).  The steak is prepared to your liking on top of a bed of mushrooms and peppers.  The wild mushrooms were so good that I could eat a bowl of this stuff ala carte.  As for the steak itself, I wish I had seconds it was that juicy. Terri R had their Camaron de Golfo (buttered shrimp dish) and for dessert their Platanos Fritos (banana w/ice cream).  It's obvious that Terri loved her dish since she finished the whole thing.  Plus, she told me numerous times "I love my food".  

It's awesome when new restaurants open in Las Vegas, specifically Downtown Las Vegas. Owners Jenna and Michael Morton open it's doors today on an invite only with an expectation to open officially mid-week.  Jenna and Michael didn't miss a beat with their soft opening.  The restaurant was fully staffed, the talent at the bar kept patrons drinks full, and the ambiance matches what us locals expect at DTLV.  Even better, they took the time to meet, greet, and take photos with everyone.  My suggestion...visit or bookmark this place for a fun and happening dining experience.

Located in Old Town Scottsdale, this gastropub has been one of my favorite restaurants due to their superb ingredients, consistency, originality, and service. The location is easy to miss on the street corner, and strangely I haven't had problems with parking in the amount of times I have been here.

They open in the late afternoon and dim the lights once dinner hours kick in. The interior is underscored by a full bar in the middle surrounded by rows of tables and booths dressed in white tablecloths and small candles. Even though the atmosphere gets loud later in the evenings, the venue is a nice date spot or small gatherings.

For appetizer, their Original Chopped Salad ($12) is a must get. The firm couscous, fresh arugula, corn, aged asiago, and smoked salmon was a delicious combination that gave pop and texture in every bite. I highly recommend it.

Among the entrees, I top two dishes are the Smoked Duck Breast ($28) and Roasted Buttermilk Chicken ($20). The Smoked Duck Breast comes with two thick cuts of duck breast served tender and medium rare. The pieces were very soft to cut into with refined seasonings to go nicely with the sweet potato hash and braised greens. I wished the sweet potato could be a tad sweeter for a change of pace, but the greens were fresh and delicious to couple with the succulent duck. 

Kudos to the chef, I'm not sure how the Buttermilk Chicken came out so tender and full of flavor! It was served with corn-butter bean succotash, roasted Brussels sprouts, truffle oil, and pecorino Romano on top. The thick cut was grilled and impressively moist with a refined buttermilk flavor in the backdrop. It was simplicity mixed with complexity. This is a dish for those who do not like to take risks, but it's also one that will impress both foodies and non-foodies alike. 

The Fair Trade Short Ribs ($30) came with coffee rub, dried cherry BBQ sauce, roasted parsnip puree and seasonal veggies. The ribs lacked a desired smoky flavor, but it was nevertheless complex and cuts at the touch of knife. The ribs were moist, and the tangy and zesty cherry BBQ sauce gave it an added dimension. The parsnip puree round out the flavors to go in-between the meats. 

The Lamb Burger ($13) came with Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion tzatziki, and fries with house-made ketchup. The lamb was tender, super moist, with a detectable seasoning and good lamb flavor. The soft rolls held the burger together nicely, but for a dish this good, the fries could come with a few innovative dipping sauces other than ketchup. 

For dessert, I was not all that impressed with the Choco-Chile Bread Pudding ($10). The chili flavor could be more pointed to add to the scoop of tortilla ice cream and dulce de leche. The quality of the bread pudding was rather stiff, flavorless, and one-dimensional. I wished the bread pudding could have more flavors embedded, so it does not create a distinct separation between dull and rich flavors. Since the bread pudding came highly recommended by the server, I got the sense that dessert is not really their specialty.

Service was very friendly, responsive, attentive, personable and knowledgeable. My meals were always nicely orchestrated, and the servers were extremely knowledgeable about the menu. One time I had a two year old at the dinner table and they were very accommodating with everything he needed. 

However, I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups. I tried to organize a large dinner and the person on the phone was not friendly and required a hefty minimum for drinks. Her requirements were quite unusual since I had organized many other dinner events at other restaurants in the past. Other than that, there's plenty to like about this place. I'd be happy to return to try their Happy Hour menu and other items such as the Grilled Cheese Sandwich and Mac n Cheese.

Thanks to fellow Yelper Kurdy S for finding this place!

Okay, one of the best steak houses I've eaten at!  

I spent New Year's in Las Vegas and this was one of the places we went for dinner.  We were also seeing the Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson One after dinner so being in a slight rush, we were hoping they would be able to get our food out in time because we had to be seated by 6:45 pm at the Mandalay Resort.  Once we told them this, the serving staff were all very accommodating and stressed that they would put a rush on things.  

I made a reservation through Open Table for 5:00 and they happen to open right at 5:00. Since we got there a little earlier so as not to miss our show, we had a few minutes wait before they could seat us so we waited at the bar. I ordered a VIP Martini which is their signature drink. Very refreshing indeed!

We were finally seated and my friend and I each ordered the Prime Strip which was 16 ounces (1 lb.) of delicious aged beef.  We were first served some great bread and butter.  I also had the Bleu Cheese Wedge Salad which was really nice, big and filling.  Along with the steak, we ordered sides of the sauteed mushrooms and asparagus with almonds.  Both were really delicious but I couldn't eat very much of it because I was getting really full from the steak which I was intent on finishing.  It was my main goal since I didn't want it to go waste and the besides the fact that it tasted so darn good, so tender with the right amount of seasoning and cooked to perfection, scrumptious!!  We asked the server how they prepared it and she told us so now I can hopefully replicate it at home sometime.  It'll probably won't be the same however because it never is when you try to do it at home.

I enjoyed the dinner immensely do I will definitely come back again when I'm in Vegas when I want a  steak because they do it up right here.  They have a nice decor with dark woods making the ambiance really comfortable and inviting.

If you're looking for a good steak house, I highly recommend coming to Del Frisco's because you won't be disappointed in the food or service.

It was opening day so of course there were going to be issues. I knew that going in and it was pretty much what I expected -- wait times for slides ranged from 1-2 hours. But the park never felt that crowded, thanks to them closing the gates when they reached max capacity. 

It's a good thing I got there at 6:30 and another person in our party got there at 5:30. There was the expected rush to get in but most people in line were cool about it. We were some of the first hundred or so people in and had no problem snagging inner tubes (which you only need for the lazy river and maybe the wave pool) and lounge chairs.

Here's a quick rundown of positives and negatives from the first day:

Positives
+ Friendly staff. They didn't always know the answers to questions, but they always smiled and tried to be helpful. 
+ It was great that they had people manning the locker area and walking people how to rent a locker, find it and work it. Prices for lockers range from $8-12 and can be accessed throughout the day.
+ Slidin' Thru. The park food wasn't good, of course, so it was nice to see the Slidin' Thru Food truck set up in the back right corner of the park. Prices were higher than usual, but I can't fault them for making a good business decision. Let's hope we see more food trucks here in the future.
+ The main restrooms by the lockers have showers.

Negatives
- They ran out of food. By 1pm their cafe was out of almost everything. So I walked over to their buffet, purchased a wrist band for it and proceeded to wait almost 2.5 hours in line. That long wait was due to their buffet running out of food. They had to wait for a couple delivery trucks to drop off more food, then heat it/cook it. They only had hot dogs and pizza when I finally made it through. Typically I think they have salads and other options. But remember, this is a water park. Don't come here expecting Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon-quality food. Think high school cafeteria.
- Not enough rental tubes. This didn't effect me since we got the last of the rental ones. But there were lots of unhappy people left at the rental counter and at the lazy river. I guess they should have gotten there earlier.
- Poor signage at the cafe. There are separate lines to order food and pick up food. Make sure you're in the right ones.
- No outside food or drink is allowed. But you can bring in water bottles only if they're unopened (factory sealed)

Comments/Observations
- Buffet prices are $12.99 ($9.99 for kids and season ticket holders). They give you a wrist band and you can go through as often as you like throughout the day.
- Some families were only buying one buffet wristband and had that one family member go through and get food for everyone. One chick walked out with two plates of pizza, about 6 hot dogs and a few salads. haha
- There are only 30 or so cabanas for rent. You can rent them in advance for here on out. If you get a cabana you can also get food service. A great option if you want to avoid the long lines at the cafe.
- I didn't have problems with parking but if you can't get into the main lot there are plenty of dirt lots within walking distance to the park.
- For the majority of slides you have to wait in a line to get a tube/floaty, then head to a different line to wait for your turn on that slide. Some groups will split up -- one person will wait in the line to get a tube and another in the line for the slide. This will minimize their wait time because by the time the person gets the tube, the other person will be close to the front of the line for the slide. Some may think of this as cutting in line -- and as an old crabby dude, I would agree -- but congrats kids on thinking outside the box.
- There are plenty of grassy area to layout if you don't get a lounge chair, so feel free to bring blankets along with towels.
- I only went on 2 slides (the Rattler and Constrictor, both were fun) and the lazy river and wave pool. It's a good thing I prepped my kid ahead of time and told him he'd probably only go on a few slides, not all of them. It's important to set your kid's expectations to lessen the chance of a meltdown.

It wasn't a perfect opening day, but the most important thing is that my five year old walked away thinking it was loads of fun. Plus he was wiped out by 7pm. Despite some negatives  (mainly running out of food) it was a fun family day and Wet 'n' Wild is a long overdue addition to the community.

The Sparklings is one of the newer restaurants to have opened in the southwest area, courtesy of the owners of Soyo and Oyshi, which are just down the road.  Walking in, it's hard to not be impressed with the dramatic transformation this space has taken.  I almost felt a bit under dressed with the ornate chandelier dominating the open eating area and a bit concerned pushing my stroller in with a crying baby inside. We had our choice of seating and opted for a corner spot to minimize any distractions.  (I noticed the generous amount of high chairs available, which to me encourages a family-friendly restaurant.)

With a quick glance at the menu, we ended up just ordering appetizers.

* Crispy Gnocchi "creamy pesto, Italian sausage, peas, crushed candied walnuts" ($7.50) - This was good, worthy of making this a meal by ordering two. (Update! I actually did this the following week and it was too much for one person. It's pretty rich, and two orders to yourself is quite a bit. And my gnocchi wasn't as 'crispy' this time. In retrospect, 'crispy' may be a bit misleading. It's more 'browned' than 'crispy'. Nonetheless, it wasn't as 'browned' in the to go order.)

* Grilled Octopus "soy marinated" ($7) - Three little octupi sat on the plate along with some greens.  I like grilled octopus in general, so we liked this dish.  It can be a bit daunting for those not wanting to see the head of a baby octopus.

* Seared Diver Scallops "lemon beurre blanc" ($7.50) - I didn't realize this dish had other items on it besides scallops, so was confused by the texture in my mouth when I thought I eating scallop. I guess along with the scallops were tater tot like disks.  The sauce was a bit fruity.

* Truffle Parmesan Fries "sea salt, parsley, lemon garlic sauce" ($6) - It came with two dipping sauces and the chunks of garlic were falling off.

* Portobello Fries "lightly breaded" ($6) - This also came with two dipping sauces.

* Roasted Beet and Apple Salad "arugula, candied walnuts, balsamic vinaigrette" ($8) - We like beet salads, but it seemed like this salad missed a little something.  They did shave some Parmesan cheese on there, but maybe it needed more nuts?

* Clam Linguini "surf clams, roasted garlic, garden herbs, Italian parsley & white wine extra virgin olive oil broth" ($13) - We took this dish to go for my mom.  She's a big fan of clam linguine and the first thing she noticed was the amount of clams.  She gobbled up the dish and even saved the sauce for the next day.  (She said it was good, but there wasn't enough for the price.) (Update! The Husband obviously liked what he saw when we ordered this for my mom. So the following week he got an order to go!)

Service - The staff were attentive, perhaps even too attentive.  I appreciate more than less, so I can't complain too much.  The restaurant wasn't busy, so they were coming around a lot to ask how things were and if we wanted to order more.  The owner (one of the partners) came around to see how we were doing too. I appreciate when the owners take an active part in their new business ventures because it can show a genuine interest in their clientele, especially if they become regulars.  He mentioned that this was a family-friendly restaurant, which we do appreciate (and noticed a kids' menu available too).

Overall, we like The Sparklings but are a bit confused.  It's very upscale in appearance, but a mix of casual in the menu.  I think they can actually expand on the menu a bit more, and perhaps they will with time.  But for the time being, we just couldn't find anything in the entrees that interested us.  (Items ranged from sandwiches like Philly Cheese Steak ($8.50) and Shrimp Po Boy ($8.50) to pastas, salmon and meats, ie. Rib-Eye Steak ($25) and Filet Mignon ($25).

They do offer a happy hour in the lounge/bar area from 5 pm to 10 pm daily, which means discounted drinks.  Only those over 21 years of age allowed into the restaurant after 11 pm.

I was very VERY VERY underwhelmed by this place. Really folks... the deal is not what it used to be and they are living on lost reputation... kinda like a chicken that is running around after its head is cut off. 

Yes they have some intriguing and great items here. However when I was just here, not 1 person was impressed. When I see the prices that people used to pay of $22 for brunch/breakfast, I can agree my whole outlook would likely be different. However the price is not $39+tax & tip. So realistically you are looking at a $50 meal. Is this place worth that? To be BLUNTLY BRUTALLY HONEST, OHHH HELL NO! It's a standard Vegas buffet.

The Good: 
Bangers n mash - Hands down the best tasting item on the menu. The sausage snapped when taking a bite. Even on a precut portion. The gravy was perfect. However the mash was one of the best, if not the best, that I may have ever had.

Stir Fry Beef - My second favorite item on the menu. But you can get the same results from just about any good Chinese restaurant for $10-15.

Watermelon Juice - Super Tasty, but I cant remember what exactly that they called it

Kalbie Ribs - If you like strong flavors (perhaps over the top) this was an awesome thing to eat as well. There was no subtlety here it was in your face taste and I loved it.

Gelatto - Hit and miss, but the mint chip was outstanding and the best of the 5 flavors that I tried.

Cheesecake - very rich moist and extremely filling in small portions

BACON! Just the right level of crispy and soft. Very flavorful, and tasted more how I make my bacon than I almost ever find at a restaurant.

The OK:
Prime Rib au jus
Blue cheese
Cream corn with red n green peppers
Most of the deserts

The unimpressive:
Angry mac n cheese - bad day? The cheese wasn't creamy and seemed to be separating, very oily
Linked sausage from the carving station - no snapping, no taste, no interest
Fried Chicken - no taste hardly at all. The Colonel 's chicken is ten billion times better than this. (several of the yelpers I was eating with agreed that this is the worst that they have tasted chicken from wicked spoon)
Gnocchi - very very bland with an unanticipated consistency, almost grainy if that makes sense. Definitely different from when I have had this in the past
The asian riblets - very weird tasting and I only took a small niblet to figure that one out

The five billion little dishes for food to come in. This is an utter nightmare. I do like that all the dishes can be tasted separately, but it's still a royal pain in the derrire!  This is easily solved by plates with dividers on them as an option... it is a buffet err cafeteria after all. Ohhh wait, does it matter? They ran out of all of these lil pint size dishes and started putting out large bowls for things previously in mini dishes.

The service sucked. I had to ask for more juice several times and they didn't want to take the dirty dishes even though we had piles of mini bowls, baskets, plates, etc... Then when they did take plates from us, they just grabbed everything from you including what you may still have been working on.

In summation, for the money spent, this place is not worth it to go to again for me. Perhaps it was a bad day. At least I didn't wait in line for this crap like so many others were doing. Drop the price, kills the stupid excess dishes, improve service, make sure you don't have an off day in the kitchen, and I bet I may like it. I would have been satisfied in the $20 range. But at a base price of double that, it simply does not even remotely contemplate being a good deal...

One last thing, being it was brunch, if you wanted champagne, mimosa's, or alcohol period, that was an additional fee. Bottomless mimosa's was an additional $10 per person!

Let's get straight to the point, this little Thai restaurant is skyrocketing near the top of my list.  I was extremely impressed with this place.  While the atmosphere feels like a small hole in the wall, and the seating may be a little cramped, rest assured that this is some of the best authentic Bangkok style food in Vegas as of this review.  

On my first visit I tried the Pot Stickers ($5.95), Green Curry Fried Rice ($7.95), and Green Curry with Beef ($6.95).  The Pot Stickers were similar to the ones served at TSNH.  The fried shell had a light crispness to it, and it was topped with a creamy orange sauce (I think it's the same sauce you get on a lot of sushi rolls).  They were pretty good, although nothing to rave about.  At least, not compared to the next two dishes.

The Green Curry Fried Rice was absurdly good.  Spiced heavily with just enough heat (I ordered a 7/10), the balance in flavor was spot on while still having that strong herbal/spicy array of authentic flavor.  The vegetables, which included short slices of green beans, were firm and juicy (not as juicy as good ol' Pan Asian mind you).  The chunks of chicken breast were most impressively juicy and tender as well.  I highly recommend this dish to any Thai food lover.  They don't hold back on the flavor. All kinds of lemongrass, basal, and other delicious spicy flavors explode with this dish.

The Green Curry itself, ordered with beef, was one of the best I have had in a very long time.  It was a thin Bangkok style curry with lots of bamboo, green and red peppers, etc.  Any Thai food lover knows that it is hard to find an exceptional Bangkok style green curry.  I think this one has trumped Krung Thai for my favorite green curry in town.  The balance of flavor was again amazing.  Many Thai restaurants either hold back on the spicing ingredients or can't balance them properly.  This place does it right.  The only complaint that I could see maybe is that there wasn't a ton of beef, but to me the curry itself is so good that it doesn't even need it.  A+ green curry right here, folks.

On visit two we had the Roast Duck Curry ($8.95), Larb with Pork ($6.95), Pineapple Fried Rice ($7.95), and Drunken Noodles with chicken ($6.75).  Again, the food was stellar the second time around, and again the Roast Duck Curry stole the show.  It had a strong yet balanced and lightly sweet flavor, very savory while still a thin consistency.  The pineapple tasted fresh, and the duck was of the highest quality.  The only complaint I would have is that there could have been more duck meat, but I would rather have less of a higher quality meat.  The price is certainly right regardless.  The curries here are authentic and balanced at the same time, completely stellar.  

The Pineapple Fried Rice was excellent as well, with a light grilled flavor balanced with the sweetness of fresh pineapple.  The cashews tasted fresh and were absolutely delightful.  The Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mow at some other restaurants) was also great.  The Larb was slightly dry for my taste, but very flavorful. It wasn't too sour but definitely had some sourness to it, and had lots of other savory flavors to balance it out.  Most Larbs I have had lately are very one sided in the sour department, but not this one.  Multidimensional flavor seems to be the theme to this place!

I would probably give Thai Food To Go a 4/5 over all, but the curries here are so off the hook that I have to bump this one up to a 5.  I can't express my previous frustration with not being able to find really good, authentic tasting Bangkok style curry in this town.  Thai Food To Go has finally filled that gap for me, and I can't wait to go back. (Note: I was told the place has new owners as of about 6 months ago).

Sweets Raku is the brainchild of Mitsuo Endo of the Abriya Raku fame (a 3-time James Beard Award nominee). The concept of this restaurant is a dessert bar, where you come in, order off a prefix menu, or order the desserts  la carte. Being a dessert bar, you will be served desserts only (but I've heard that they also have a cheese plate). After hearing some interesting comments about this dessert bar, I went with a buddy after my SnowFlake Shavery fix to get some dessert.

SR is located in the Seoul Plaza on Spring Mountain Road and Jones. It actually sits across the same building complex as Raku. Walking inside, you'll notice an amazing display of bottles of water and other refreshments built into a see-through wall. The clean, modern, and white interior give you a sense that the people who created this restaurant really wanted to give you an unforgettable experience. There is an open kitchen, and around it sits a bar with around 15 seats where you can watch all the desserts being made right in front of your eyes! There are also tables, but if you have the opportunity, sit at the bar and enjoy the show.

The pastry chef is Mio who is in charge of the kitchen. She's been a pastry chef for over a decade in Japan, but you would never guess due to her youthful appearance. The server dropped off a menu that was rolled up in a sugar ribbon ring. After ordering our drinks and the prix fix menu, we waited for Mio to start. The menu is also edible, and I thought that was a real neat and fun idea to be able to eat a menu!  It didn't have a taste at all, which is good because I would have gagged if it tasted like paper. The server then brought us our drinks.

- Americano coffee: They use the Illy brand coffee, and it was bold and well made.

The Amuse/First course came up first:

- Strawberry and Mint: A strawberry sorbet with mint jelly, with a fresh sprig of micromint. The strawberry sorbet had a nice strawberry flavor. The texture was sort of weird for me, it wasn't icy... but I guess it wasn't as smooth as I would have liked.  It's hard to describe. On the other hand, the texture of the mint jelly was well done, but I couldn't really taste the mint flavor that much.

The main entrees then arrived:

- Mt. Fuji: This was a play on the classic French dessert, the Mont Blanc. This was my favorite dessert of the night. The chestnut cream was amazingly light and had a smooth chestnut flavor. The cake was moist, and the chestnut glace complimented the whole dish. The presentation was also pretty cool.

- Apollo: Chocolate and raspberry mousse on top of chocolate cake, Earl grey tea ice cream, raspberry meringue, chocolate bases, and raspberry sauce. I thought the mousse's were all well made and so was the chocolate cake. The chocolate squares around the plate and the Earl Grey Tea ice cream were my favorite part of the dish. The ice cream tasted exceptionally well with the pink peppercorns that were ground on top. I thought the meringue and raspberry sauce were O.K. This was my least favorite dessert, I thought, flavor wise... it was just too safe.

The petit fours/Last Courses arrived:

- Parmesan cheesecake with oranges: I loved the concept of this dish. It is like eating two different courses in one dish. By itself, the cheesecake is very savory, and I thought that this would make a nice appetizer on a restaurant menu. But then, after eating the cheesecake together with the oranges, it complimented the savoriness of the cheesecake perfectly, and it became a dessert again! I found this to be absolutely fascinating.

- Chocolate Fondant with marshmallows: The warm chocolate molten cake was well executed with a cakey outer shell, and a warm molten interior. It was a well balanced cake. My favorite accompaniment of the night had to go to the lemon marshmallows. They had a bright, strong,  lemon flavor, and they tasted just like a lemon curd! I thought the raspberry marshmallows were lacking in raspberry flavor, but the texture was good.

The service throughout the night was top notch. The server knew when we needed drinks refilled, and cleared our plates at the right time. She was super friendly and knowledgeable and engaged with us enough, but not overly smothering.

Dining at Sweets Raku brought an old smile to my face. It brought me back to those pre-"Great Recession" days. I remembered when the properties on the Strip were in competition with each other... not money-wise like they are now...but quality wise. Back then, F&B programs were trying to think of ways to create unforgettable experiences to their guests. Now, it's all about the bottom line, which is why we only see now burger joints, bars, and steak houses popping up, with inconsistent service everywhere. There are some flubs in this place, but you can find flaws at Raku, Joel Robuchon, The French Laundry, etc. But, this place deserves 5 stars, because.. it's the thought that counts. 

Kudos to Chef Endo and Chef Mio, true artisans of their profession!!!

Mr. K has covered most of the bases in his FTR, but there were a couple of things I thought I would add... 

The green chile beef is every bit as good as the red. We sampled both, as well as the beans (we choose Pima style which is the smashed version of beans rather than whole). All were very ample portions and exhibited crisp flavors. We all agreed that each could use a little salt, but after some discussion and a few sprinkles we came to the conclusion that actually it was preferable to season your own to your liking. Too often, we had all been served items which were over seasoned and quite frankly, there isn't much you can do once that has happened. This way, we each were able to make adjustments as desired. 

The bread itself seems a little more tender than TFBH. It also seemed a bit larger. That being said, we did each have the "full" version of the tacos, so the "half" may be more along the lines of what you might get elsewhere. Prices also seemed to be approximately $1.00 - 1.50 higher than TFBH, for the full portion. 

Some other items on the menu were both surprising and intriguing. I'm definitely going back for the Blue Corn Mush (I would have ordered it today, but I had already ordered my taco and was sure I couldn't handle both). I've never actually seen this on a menu off the reservation, so that in itself is enough to make me a repeat visitor. They have a few mutton and lamb selections that are obviously more on the authentic side. The mutton rib plate is served with sauteed squash and diced green chiles along with a navajo fry bread and drink ($11.99). The people at the next table had one of these and it was a large plate of food which they clearly enjoyed. There is a grilled lamb stir fry and also a lamb sandwich to round out the native selections. The sandwiches and burgers are a definite twist on the common offering. Sandwiches are served either a tortilla or fry bread and come with such toppings as eggs/bacon/onions/fire roasted green chiles, eggs/grilled spam, or two burger choices. Lastly there are the stews... yummo! They have the standard red and green, but also offer up a monthly special (this month was a very tasty vegetable style). Stews are served in two sizes, which is particularly nice if you are sharing items. 

The decor is certainly nothing that stands out; the chairs and tables are a mosh of options, but it is clean, and the staff is very friendly and patiently answered questions. They have one high chair for those of you with little ones. It is a small place, so if you go during peak hours expect to wait for a seat or take your food elsewhere to eat it, as it fills up quickly. 

The final distinction is that the SH is open on Sundays from 11:00 to 5:00. So if you are dying for some of that unbelievable fried dough on the morning after a long night out and had to previously wait until Monday, this could definitely be a saving grace. 

It's great to have another option and I truly hope that they will build a following in the Central Phoenix area.

After seeing Guy rave about this place on "DDD"  and having many yelper friends telling hubby and myself that we needed to try this place I finally gave in. A lot of the reason it took so long to try is because I am not fan of burgers. While hanging out with one of our best-est buddies Joshua G and his wifey we decided to give Bachi Burger a try.

Upon entering there were plenty of tables open but maybe not enough servers or something. The hostess told us as well the customers coming in after us that there would be a small wait so the severs could catch up. After being seated our drink orders were taken right away. I have to say the service here is great. Our server was fantastic. 

I knew I wasn't going to order a burger so I took a look at what sides and salads they had to offer. I decided to go junk food style and order some "Crispy Onion Rings" priced at $3.50 and "Salt & Pepper Garlic Fries" priced at $4.50. The onion rings were pretty good. The fries were good but I sure didn't taste any garlic. Paying extra money to have the garlic fries I do expect it to actually taste like garlic fries. My man ordered a "Bachi Burger" and added cheddar cheese and bacon. He did enjoy the burger but not for the price. I feel personally that for the price of the burger it should have came with fries instead of paying separate for them. I don't want to go to a burger place that looks like they just threw a few random *fancy* things on the walls just so they can charge me a la carte for everything. I have no problem paying a la carte for a establishment that enforces a dress code and doesn't have kids running around the tables. 

Bachi Burger doesn't taste terrible but is not worth another trip for me. It doesn't have any *wow* factor for the price.

I never have been a huge fan of Johnny Rocket's, so when I found out The Wiener's Circle would be taking the spot JR was in, I was happy. A lot of the signs say it's near the bowling alley when it's actually closer to the doors near the buffet. I have enjoyed my experience at The Wiener's Circle inside Red Rock, but there is something about this location inside Santa Fe that was just better to me. If you are familiar with the original The Wiener's Circle in Chicago, then you know they have a different attitude when it gets dark. Here at this location they don't sling any insults (they play games with customers and sling expected insults at the original location after a certain hour even handing out free food and shirts sometimes) or play any games, but what I have experienced is great customer service. The guy who took my order was very nice and patient while I went over the menu. He also told me about different combo deals that include fried and a drink. I have to give them props as far as the menu prices go. Being in a casino usually means marked up prices and sometimes not the same product you'd expect, but I found the prices to be fair and the food tasted great. I've been back a few times now and will be back plenty more! 

Char Dog - I got the combo priced at $6.99 that came with fries and a drink. The dog had onions, relish, mustard, pickles, tomatoes, peppers and celery salt. I asked that the dog be lightly charred and that's exactly what I got. The cook even came over to our table to make sure I liked it. I had them add cheese to my fries and the cheese sauce is thick and delicious! I could eat a huge pile (they already give you 1/2 pound with your order) of just those fries covered in cheese and my taste buds would be happy. 

Chicken Fingers - As a combo it was $7.99 with fries and a drink. They also give you a choice of mustard, ranch and honey mustard to dip your fingers. I really like the honey mustard here it goes well with the fingers. The fingers didn't look to plump or appetizing when I first saw them, but they really had good flavor and the chicken tasted good enough with out any sauce to dip, but trust me and pair it with the honey mustard. 

Wieners in a Blanket  - These were $4.99 and tasty little bites! They come 6 to an order, but when I got my order I noticed I had 8 of them. Score! You can choose a dipping sauce for these so I obviously chose honey mustard. I don't think these would fill someone alone, but they make a great snack to share along with your meal or nice portion for a kids meal. 

They have booths and tables or you can get your food to-go.

First impression, this place rocks!! It's in the space that used to house Palette.. the space has a very "breezy" sort of Caribbean plantation feel that's easy to relax right into.. not to mention the moment you walk through the gate you're greeted by friendly smiling faces. 

LB has a massive outdoor patio complete with tables, well appointed outdoor sofas and chairs where you can leisurely sip a cocktail or beer. While their grand opening isn't truly until Tuesday (12th of May) they seem to be ironing out their kinks pretty quickly with only a few minor hiccups mostly due to computer errors rather than human. 

The menu is made up mostly of burgers, salads, lahvosh pizzas and a few entrees. We ordered a few starters, the LB Favorite (bacon and roasted corn lahvosh pizza, half $9) as well as the Queen Creek Olive Oil (kalamata, tomato, fresh basil and feta lahvosh, half $9). You know you can put bacon on just about anything and have it taste awesome but paired with the right flavors the good becomes great! The sweetness of the roasted corn with the savory saltiness of the bacon sent me into piggy heaven! Was so good I didn't want to share but alas, I'm a good guy like that. The Queen Creek Olive Oil lahvosh was very tasty, the lahvosh being crispy and light but sturdy enough to hold the ample toppings. I love olives and olive oil paired with cheese and the feta was a great idea. The cheese being strong enough to stand up to the kalamata, the tastes were right on.

Meanwhile we were all sipping on Nimbus Brown Ale ($4) which was ice cold, rich and complex. Nimbus is certainly one of my favorite craft beers and at 4 bucks, nice! LB also has a full bar and while cocktails around 8 bucks they pours are generous. We didn't have wine service but the manager Eric used to be the sommelier at The Grill at TPC back in the day when it was one of the best steak houses in town. He knows his wine so I look forward to next time when I can enjoy a glass or 6. 

I ordered the Fire Island ($10) which is one of several classic Pischke dishes on the menu that made it over from the old days. Oh yes, the owner Sid Campbell was a cook at Pischke's Paradise for over 12 years before it was ruined by new owners. The Fire Island is a pizza with chicken breast, red onion, green chilies and a cream cheese sauce that is absolutely finger licking tasty! Be sure to ask them to add 2 over easy eggs on the top, outrageous! 

The Mr ordered the Roasted Green Chile Cheeseburger ($10) which is served on MJ's Breads giant English muffin. The beefy flavor combined with the soft texture of the English muffin was excellent, you can taste the quality and the smokiness of the green chile. An order of house fries comes with the burgers and sandwiches and let me just say, they were seasoned so well that you could have chowed them down plain. However, the bread and butter pickle ketchup is simply amazing with its dice of bread and butter pickles, never knew ketchup could be elevated to another experience! 

First impressions last nearly forever and this one was great! I think LB has a bright future in front of them. This will be a great place to hang out on the patio after work with friends, drinks and cool conversation. Excellent addition to the neighborhood.

Food: quite delicious. Atmosphere: rockin'. Customer service? I'm disheartened to say that it's extremely disappointing! Therefore the three stars is only for the food and atmosphere. I've been to Copper Blues three times now and every time there's always been some sort of hiccup. However, the hiccups were short lived and soon forgotten. Unfortunately the hiccup during this last visit won't be so easily forgotten. 

This past Friday night, we went to see Bob Saget perform (he is absolutely hilarious by the way). Before the show, we wanted to grab dinner so we decided to make it easy and eat at Copper Blues. When we arrived, we were given a buzzer and quoted for a 10-minute wait. We asked if there was open seating anywhere and they directed us to the outdoor patio and said that was the only open seating. After about 10 minutes of waiting, we checked back with the hostess on the status and at that point, she said it was going to be a 35 minute wait. We said that we were told 10 minutes initially and then she said, "oh well, then it's 10 minutes I guess." It was all very confusing. So after about another 10 minutes, we checked back again and at this point they said that they never quote a wait time and when I told them that I had been quoted twice, she said again that they never quote a wait time. I felt like I was on crazy pills! It didnt seem like the staff knew what was going on that night! Well, the saga continues on... 

At this point, it's around 6:00 PM and we are hungry and eager to get some dinner before Saget. It was also freezing on the outdoor patio and we were hoping to sit inside. We decide to check out the inside portion of the restaurant (even though we were told initially that the only open seating was outside). Well, when we got inside, we realized that the entire bar area was also open seating. Now this is where the hiccup will forever stay with me and it will be hard to get over this next part. We find two high top tables and are told that one is in use, so we take the other one. It has three chairs and we need two more chairs. At this point, a waiter comes up and confronts us. I let him know that we are in need of two more chairs and do they have any (this is in the open seating bar, remember.) He turns to me, stares at me dead on and says "well are you even planning on eating here or are you just going to be using this table to wait?" Now regardless of whether we were going to order one drink or a whole meal, I don't think a waiter should ever question a customer and treat them the way I was treated. I proceed to tell him that we are wanting to eat dinner and we have been wanting to eat dinner there for a good thirty minutes! I was blown away by the treatment and I will admit that I've never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before. Someone must have seen my anger and utter shock because about five minutes later they told us they found a table at the bar for us but sadly at that point, the experience at Copper Blues was ruined. We ordered several drinks and a couple appetizers (which were delicious) but after the treatment, decided to just eat dinner at Stand Up Live. 

I hate writing a disappointing review like this one. I visit restaurants wanting a good experience and wanting to enjoy the atmosphere. However, customer service can either make or badly break an experience.

We've been eating at LOS for years and have been there so many times that luckily we've managed to order most of the menu. However we have 2 different ways we order when visiting LOS. The first way is just me and my hubs on a casual weeknight, we tend to order the few dishes that we haven't tried yet . The other is a weekend night with several guests along for a Thai feast. So this review will focus on the later, a sort of best of LOS if you will.

On a side note you do not come here to order Pad Thai and the other super popular Thai dishes. LOS is famous for Northern style and Chef Chutima specialties, stick to those and you will not be disappointed. Also, LOS has 4 condiments but be sure to ask for all 4.. chili paste, chili powder, pickled jalapeo will be brought out in a caddy but the 4th is separate.. its thai chili in fish sauce and lime juice, you'll have to ask for this one. When they bring it lift the lid of carefully and inhale the fragrance. This to me is the LOS perfume and let me tell you this condiment is scorchingly hot. Its burns both ways but it tastes truly amazing! 

Apps..

#12 Stuffed Chicken Wings.. while these can be found elsewhere, the preparation here is a deep fried crunchy version that's amazing with pickled jalapeo and sticky rice. 

#13 A. Nua Dad Deaw which is Issan style beef jerky. Seriously, it's jerky so think deeply flavored slices of chewy meat. Its fun to eat especially with sticky rice and some of the accompanied sauce. 

#14 Nam Kao Tod.. this is like the premier LOS appetizer, if you can order only one app, make it this one. We call this one simply crispy rice with sour sausage. However its the little pieces of sausage arent sour but have a porky lime flavor thats addictive paired with fresh ginger, green onions, chili, peanuts and of course this is all nestled into a pile of light crispy rice. Served with cucumber chips this tastes great using the chili fish sauce condiment. BTW, if you prefer the sausage whole order #66.

Salads..

#45 Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad.. little deep friend pieces of cat fish with slices of apple and peanuts then dressed with lime juice.. Its bright, crispy and one of my favorites here. 

#59 Koi Soy.. okay so technically this isn't a salad but the coolness of this dish sits perfectly in the salad space for me. So what is it you ask? It's Issan style beef tartare. Yep raw beef and its a gorgeous dish with minced beef dressed with chili, rice powder and lime. We've ordered this at a spice level 4 and let me say that our faces felt like they were going to burn off. Order at a 1 spice level and add your own heat via condiments. Trust me on this.

Entrees..

A. Khao Soi.. typical street food noodle dish but the version here is crazy good. We always order beef with this but if you're feeling like a high roller get the beef short rib version (you'll pay more but its marginally more tender). Its simple, toothsome egg noodles afloat in a curried coconut bream broth garnished with red onion, lime and pickled cabbage. Its rich, thick and a must order. 

K. Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry).. this is one of those dishes that has a far reaching flavor profile. To me this curry could easily be on a table in India.. its dark deep pork richness is fork tender and perfect over steamed rice. However many prefer to eat this one with sticky rice. 

Drunken Noodles.. we order this a couple of different ways depending on what the table wants.. most popular way is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Sea Bass with extra noodle. The sea bass is lightly dusted and deep fried until its light and crispy. Inside the meat is light, flakey and a great contrast to the rich smokey noodles. The other preparation for us is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Duck. Same as above but with slices of deep fried duck breast (no bones in either). The duck is rich, slightly fatty and bursting with flavor. For me the duck is my favorite preparation but I also like heavier meat flavors. 

Garlic Prawns.. so for the longest time we never ordered this dish as we thought it was just a Chinese style dish, boy were we wrong. This is where Chef Chutima works her Thai culinary magic. She takes large shell on shrimp and cooks them in such a way that the meat is tender and juicy while the shell is as light and crispy as a potato chip. Yes, you eat the shell, legs and all. This is truly a magical dish for us. 

Dessert.. 

We're usually so full right about now that desserts of sticky rice and mango seems just to heavy for us. Though look up my review for Luv-It Frozen Custard for a tongue cooling treat (its close to LOS).

At some point in the future I will write a companion review to this review for those who want to explore other dishes but have been overwhelmed with the scale of the menu. Oh and in case you're wondering the amount of dishes we ordered above are good for about 4-6 people. Though we're really big eaters so a party of 4 is more like it for us. 

Bon appetite!

Once upon a time there were 3 bunnies... very hungry bunnies. Venturing the Las Vegas Strip with black wristbands on their wrists, they hopped from hotel to hotel in search of bountiful yummy things to eat. It was seven hotels to be exact, actually, as they were on mission to complete...  *insert deep, booming voice* THE BUFFET OF BUFFETS!!!

And complete it they did! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pJpjgXH5lgJtIJos9GqetQ?select=cicuGUx9tyF5o88Ykc_0uA
I write today to tell the tale of the 3 bunnies' eating adventure on Easter weekend 2011.   

* SATURDAY *

Paradise Garden Buffet (Flamingo) - 12:50pm
- Officially got our wristband passes here + thus began the adventure. Just in time for brunch, we liked that they had made-to-order omelettes + crepes... but everything else was your mediocre typical buffet fare of so-so prime rib, crab legs, cocktail shrimp, crappy sushi, pastas, etc. The highlight is definitely the chocolate fountain that you can drip skewers of marshmallows, fruit + rice crispy squares into. Only worth grabbing 1 plate of food each plus chocolate dipped dessert + cotton candy to-go.      

Lago Buffet (Caesars) - 3:30pm
- Originally arriving around 2:15, this was the only buffet we had to wait over an hour in line for, + although it gave us time to digest, it wasn't  worth it. The food quality, variety + plating was more creative than Flamingo with the salad medley cups + the desserts... but we knew we still had better options ahead. Only grabbed 1 plate of food + a hand-scooped ice cream cone each to-go.    

Le Village Buffet (Paris) - 4:30pm
-  The late afternoon is the BEST time to hit up the more popular buffets. No line + we had our pick of the last of brunch + got first pickings at the dinner options coming out. Favorites here include bouillabaisse, custom crepes, perfectly tender prime rib, bacon-brie mac n cheese, crab claws (not legs, the claw part only), quiche, crme brle, etc. We feasted here on at least 1 plate of food + 1 plate of desserts each. My second favorite!  

The Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood) - 6:00pm
- Just beat the dinner rush + took our time here stretching our tummies to the max before a long night of partying ahead. Despite being spoiled by Le Village buffet, we liked the rack of lamb, the crab legs that were pre-split + came both chilled + steamed, skewered meat, stuffed pork loin + shrimp cocktail in a martini glass. At least 1 plate each + more cotton candy to-go! 


* SUNDAY *

Carnival World Buffet (Rio) - 9:30am
- My favorite of the 7! Encompassing the flavors of the world, the buffet options seemed to never end as I had a tough time being selective about what to load my empty tummy with! In addition to made-to-order omelettes for breakfast, we feasted on made-to-order teppanyaki, roast duck, taco bar, sushi that was actually good, different kinds of ribs, etc. Gotta love the bar in the middle with the blasting of drink specials over the PA system even before 10am... LOL. Worth eating more than 1 plate of food each plus gelato to-go!  

Flavors, The Buffet (Harrah's) - 11:30am
- Not too memorable except for its similarity to the Flamingo buffet in variety, general mediocrity, + having to pre-order our first drink with the cashier. Other than your typical buffet fare, some unique selections were veggie spring rolls, giant corned beef shank + fajita bar. Only grabbed 1 plate of food here plus a cute Easter decorated dessert to go. (My current Yelp profile pic was taken here)

Emperor's Buffet (Imperial Palace) - 12:40pm
- Yes, we saved the worst for last. Compared to the other 6, this janky buffet is worse than a school dining hall but with decades-old tacky tiki decor. Shrimp cocktail is tiny, salmon is white as if it were canned, the "Asian noodles" is spaghetti noodles stir-fried in soy sauce... *shudders* We shared a couple plates of food/desserts + called it a day. Don't waste the valuable real estate in your tummy here.  

*****

Strategically, we planned this out perfectly so we barely had any line waiting + so we would hit up the better 3 buffets for more key meal times (dinner-ish before a long night of partying + then brunch the following day). 

Priced at $44.99 for Gold Card members or $49.99 for non-members, this is a steal of a deal. But even BETTER is staying in one of their properties + booking the Buffet of Buffets package deal. Over Easter weekend, our 2-night stay at Imperial Palace with the package cost us 

   $213 (package of 2 nights + 2 BofB passes) 
+ $48 (1 extra BofB pass)
----------
   $261  

Split between 3 girls... that's DIRT CHEAP since it covered all lodging expenses + majority of our eating expenses. Yea we chose ghetto Imperial Palace rather than nicer hotels offering the package, but we spent less than 12 hours in the hotel anyways so it wasn't a big deal.

And then factoring in how we hit up 4 clubs/lounges including 2 open bars in 2 nights... this was perhaps my favorite Vegas trip EVER!

4.5 stars!

Today was my second visit, and I like this eatery!   The ambience is laid-back, despite the gorgeous marble bar counter, distinctive winery flourishes (I looked for beer taps,  but didn't see any), including cut-out kegs doubling as decorative shelves, and one flat-panel TV (this isn't a sports bar). Matt and Shawn (the latter had been the former manager of neighbor Four Peaks) are gracious as  always.  Chef Indy remembered me from my first visit, as the guest who ordered the spare ribs without the BBQ sauce and the chocolate bread pudding, which he made a chocolate ganache especially for me, because I couldn't have the regular chocolate sauce laced with corn syrup.

This afternoon's dishes all tasted terrific, and I enjoyed the textures:

Calamari app- Menu says $10, and 3.5 weeks ago was half-off during happy hour.  Menu still lists the price at $10, but my receipt said $9, with $2 off during HH.  Loved the crunch!  The calamari was prepared just the way I like calamari to be, and I know Mom would love it, as well.  The accompanying garlic aioli and marinara were great, as well, with the aioli being a little saltier than I'd prefer.  My only gripe is that for $9 original price, I didn't get a lot of calamari, so I'd only order it during HH...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=Tc4nAKLyAECUuNVzJH0o2w#Tc4nAKLyAECUuNVzJH0o2w

Twisted Burger- $14, and comes with house fries.  Matt had told me about TR's mac 'n cheese more than three weeks ago and said that he could sub it for the fries, if I wanted.  The burger came with brie, perfectly-crisped thick bacon (!), arugula, and tomato jam, which I'd asked for on the side.  It's made with sun-dried tomatoes in a white wine and sugar reduction.  It added a definite sweetness to the burger and complemented it well, but for someone with inflammation issues, I'd skip it next time.  (Tomatoes, part of the nightshade family, is one of many inflammatory foods.)  The mac 'n cheese was DELICIOUS!  Today's preparation consisted of cheddar, parmesan, and provolone, and a little bacon.  I had to stop myself from eating too much!  Again, this dish is a little pricey for me, especially since I can't have the tomato jam...  The great quality of the mac 'n cheese kind of makes up for the price, just a little.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=SAuXcPnQ-Quc8EI3W6e2uQ#SAuXcPnQ-Quc8EI3W6e2uQ and http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=AZl3l-786NTEWyX8ephxKg#AZl3l-786NTEWyX8ephxKg

Double Chocolate Lava Cake- $8, and usually comes with vanilla ice cream, which contained corn syrup that I can't have, so  Chef Indy (sp?) offered to whip up some fresh heavy cream and granulated sugar.  He also offered to make a caramel sauce when I asked if instead of whipped cream, I could have some creme anglaise.  He wasn't sure which of the two I wanted, so he decided to give me both!  After the first bite of one lava cake, though, I knew the whipped cream and the caramel sauce were not needed.  This dessert should be called Better Than Sex, and really, what better metaphors for sex are there but volcanoes and lava, eh?  And boy, was this dark chocolate lava hot, thick, and decadent!  I'm getting excited just thinking about it!  ;)  I'm sorry I didn't take a photo of the lava oozing out... I couldn't stop eating to take other photos...  If only there weren't other people present, I'd have licked that plate clean!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/twisted-rose-winery-and-eatery-scottsdale?select=fLYO4YN5-mYty5nbRGvlFw#fLYO4YN5-mYty5nbRGvlFw

Btw, Thursday night is Ladies' Night, which means happy hour* deals ALL DAY for women.  Also, live music entertainment is held from 6p to 9p.  I enjoyed it, and so did the other women who filled up the main dining room.

*Happy hour deals changed since my last visit three and a half weeks ago.  It used to feature half-off appetizers, but now it's just $2 off the apps.  There are wine specials, too, both by the glass and bottles.  If you feel like splurging, try the Sexual Chocolate by Slo Down Vines, $45.  Very good!

I came here for dinner with some friends the other night to try out the much talked about stuffed pizza served here. Walking in we were greeted and taken to a table. The place was half full and had a good vibe. The walls are lined with memories of Chicago, celebrity pictures and yes, I even heard a songs by Chicago while eating LOL! There were several TVs playing various Chicago games as well.

After ordering a "1/2 cheese & 1/2 Sausage Stuffed Pizza" (large) priced at $19.50 our server told us that it would take about 45 minutes to make so I ordered "Cheesy Garlic Bread" priced at $3.95 to grub on while the pizza was made. The cheesy garlic bread tasted good, but average. While waiting for the pizza I observed a couple different things going on. There was some sort of celebration with he staff because they all gathered to eat a ice cream cake (didn't look like spumoni to me!) and then there was the couple who got engaged. Yep, after they finished eating, he pulled out a ring and proposed. I don't know if this was where they had a first date or what, but it was interesting! 

Now let me get to the pizza. When our server (friendly and courteous) brought it to the table I was very excited. It looked so good! This was one cheesy, saucy, good kind of mess! The sauce is very sweet, I actually liked it, but if you aren't a fan of sweet sauces you might not like it. I used a fork to get every last tomato off my plate. The crust is supposed to have a buttery flavor however I didn't taste that. It was more doughy tasting, but certainly edible. I am usually just a cheese pizza kind of girl, but next time I would get a couple toppings to help balance the amount of cheese in the pizza. There was something about the crust that was just not right though. Windy City still puts out the best Deep Dish in my opinion. my husband thought the pizza here was very good, but he also thinks Pizza Hut is good. Enough said. 

Out front they have benches if you want to eat outside. Besides pizza you can choose from different pastas, salads, sandwiches and dessert. Catering is available.

This is the second time a club in a Wynn property has embarrassed me in front of friends/colleagues. 

Let me preface this review by saying that I know Labor Day Weekend in Las Vegas is nuts. I've been partying in Vegas for the better part of five years now; it's the second most expensive/busy weekend of the year or something to that effect.

That said, I booked a cabana here fully prepared to spend a lot of money. And I am the EASIEST person to help. No wacky requests, nothing. Just take my money and give me what I'm told I'm getting. I showed up with a bunch of my friends and we had a minimum spend of $2k (which is realistically more like $3k), which I thought was totally reasonable for the cabana that particular night. It was no problem, but the holier than thou attitude that I got from some of the staff was extremely off-putting. Yes, I know you're busy. Yes, I know you're stressed. But if I'm buying bottles and bottles at a 1000% markup... be a little nicer. Smile. Take five minutes to make sure we're all set. Don't ignore me when I need help. You're supposed to be bending over backwards for me, you're a VIP host. Customer service goes a long way. I'm not going to name any names in my review, but I am going to be honest.

So we waited in line for about 10 minutes before getting in. Totally standard, no problem. But, when we got in, the cabana I was promised was mysteriously unavailable. Instead, I was offered a daybed. I politely refused and asked to speak with a manager. This was embarrassing, since I was entertaining friends from out of town, and had kind of been hyping up the night since Surrender is the hot spot.

The manager came by, and I ended up having to kick him $200 to "upgrade" me to what I was promised originally. This is after I had already tipped out over $400 to the hosts and door staff. It's not like I didn't take care of my people; this wasn't my first rodeo. Tangentially, I know I'm breaking all the rules by mentioning that I tipped out, but fuck it. I'm pissed. I had been pre-authed the night before for the cabana, I had confirmed it twice, and then I got bait-and-switched. Not happy, Surrender. If you wanted to sell the cabana for a higher price to someone else, fucking tell me before I show up with a group, and don't you dare try to pull a bait and switch.

Anyway, we finally get up to the cabana and got our drinks a full hour after we arrived at the door. The host I had booked the table through passed me off to someone else, and (thankfully) he was fantastic, friendly, thorough. Our waitress was sort of around, our bussers friendly, our security fine. No above and beyond; if anything, the service was worse than I expected. The club itself was gorgeous and the night was beautiful, which is the only reason that this place isn't getting one star. Seriously, it was ridiculous. I'd give the club and the ambiance 5 stars, but the staff was less than stellar that night. In a city of hospitality, I was not impressed.

MIdway through the night, I had two friends get in touch with me to join the party. No problem, right? Wrong. My hosts told them my party was full, they had to wait in line, pay a $75 cover. It's a little absurd, considering we were going to purchase two more bottles when they came in, and they were just given a flat out no when they asked to join our party. I stepped outside to speak with a host - I wasn't even drunk - and I was given the cold shoulder. I produced another $100, he palmed it,  still didn't help my friends. Laughing.

All I have to say is, if Surrender treats the people who spend a ton of money this way, I can't even imagine coming here without table reservations. I learned an expensive lesson at the Encore, and this isn't the first time the Wynn staff has treated me like a second class citizen (see my XS review). Is my money different or something?

Overall, less than pleased. I will say this, though; if I ever return, I'd be more apt to return during the day than the night, and it'll be on someone else's dime so I don't have to deal with anybody.

***This was my first visit to a Las Vegas buffet in over 5 years; I had the breakfast buffet at Wicked Spoon (in The Cosmopolitan) and the quality varied with some items being surprisingly good while the majority of food was in the decent to mediocre range (a few of the items were below average)***

In terms of Las Vegas buffets, I've only been to the Bellagio Buffet and that was just for breakfast.  Wicked Spoon in The Cosmopolitan became my second trip to a Vegas buffet (also for breakfast).  This trip though yielded both breakfast and lunch and dinner items (I do not remember the Bellagio Buffet offering many dinner items at breakfast, but that was a long time ago).

There were a wide variety of lunch and dinner items.  There were several stations I did not try like the sushi and Chinese food.  I did try some more of their New American offerings though.  All of it was kind of just okay.  The crispy chicken wings were crunchy and crispy and well seasoned, but they had been sitting around too long.  The duck confit ravioli was not bad, but it was really kind of a just okay flavor--heavy and not that interesting of a cream sauce.  The beef short rib was decent--moist and tender.  The tri-tip (sliced to order) was just okay.

In terms of breakfast, their selection was impressive.  They had several breakfast pastries, breads and muffins available.  Some looked better than others.  The pain au chocolat was not bad for a breakfast buffet.

There was also a good number of cold items from fresh fruit to several salads.  For more heartier breakfast items, Wicked Spoon had about every dish you would expect to find at one of those all-day breakfast places.  There were many egg dishes (as well as eggs made to order), pancakes, French toast, and several breakfast meat offerings.

The breakfast meats stood out the most.  There were two kinds of bacon.  The first was crispy strips of bacon (piled up in a traditional buffet serving dish).  For breakfast buffet bacon, this was pretty good.  The bacon was crispy but not burnt and there was a decent meaty chew.  There was also a smoked bacon that they sliced to order, which had a meatier and more tender feel to it (closer to braised pork belly than traditional breakfast bacon).

The chicken apple sausage was good--moist and nicely seasoned with a decent amount of spice.

The French toast was also good--light and fluffy (with a good flavor).  The pancakes were fine.

The eggs Benedict was just okay.  The hollandaise sauce was too thick and the meat was thickly shaved ham as opposed to Canadian bacon.  I also tried an omelet made to order and it was not that good.  It was not that fluffy and the cheese was not melted at all.

In addition to their many savory offerings at breakfast, Wicked Spoon also offers a wide variety of desserts.  There were cakes, housemade marshmallows, chocolate molten cakes (though not that molten), and gelato.  The flavors of the gelato were very good--a nice caramel and a distinct pistachio flavor.  The gelato was creamy and smooth but a tad too soft.

Service was okay.  The staff was quick with getting drink orders in, but they were kind of slow in taking away plates.

The price was right around $25.  I think that is about what you would expect to pay at breakfast buffets at similar Las Vegas hotels.

The dining room is comfortable enough though I remember the Bellagio Buffet having more booth seating.

The Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon Buffet offers a great variety of food for breakfast.  Some of their offerings (like their breakfast meats) are quite good, but most items fall in the just okay or maybe slightly below average range.  Still, if you like buffets because of the great amount of choice they offer, Wicked Spoon seems like a good option.

I know The Cosmopolitan offers free valet parking.  I think this hotel also offers free self parking.

This is not a review but a love letter.  There are so many reasons to love centurion I have a hard time knowing where to start, so I guess I will just start at the beginning.  THEY HAVE A LIQUOR LICENSE AND WINE SELECTION WITH A SELECTION OF BEERS AND LIQUORS COMING SOON.

We walk up to a small restaurant within walking distance of the Central and Roosevelt Lightrail stop.  There are about 4 or 5 tables on the patio and about 10 tables inside with the tiniest open kitchen you have ever seen.  Seriously, the guy has 4 burners and a brick oven.  Not a whole lot to work with if you're a chef in my opinion.  The restaurant has a good neighborhood kind of feel.  It's not a kitschy overly modern place. Now I'll get to the best part of the restaurant, the food. 

We started with a Baked Brie with raspberry jam in a phylo pastry.  It was insanely inexpensive as an app that two could share for 7 bucks and the grapes that came with it were seriously some of the tastiest grapes I've ever had.  The Brie was had a nice strong flavor and was extremely tasty.  

Next I had the Taglioni with pulled duck, artichoke hearts, and leeks in garlic cream sauce.  The price for entre was 14 bucks and was an insane for the amount and quality food you get.   The flavors were incredible and here is my one wish for the meal.  I would have loved a nice thick noodle to hold up to the sauce a bit better.  The Taglioni is tasty and does well but I think something like a Pappardelle would have held up a bit better texturally.  The duck was cooked extremely well and was insanely tasty and the sauce was ridiculously good.  When I say ridiculously good, I mean ridiculously good.  I could sit with large bowls of that sauce and some bread and sop it up for a day and a half.  When our server Sean checked up on us I mentioned how I loved him for bringing me some crispy dusk skin with the meal and he comes back with even more.  This is about the point I fell in love with this restaurant.

Tiffany B had the Salami and Artichoke Pizza and I cannot describe how tasty it was.  This is my new pizza place hands down.  Forget Cibo, forget Pizzeria Bianco, go to Centurion for pizza.  They make pizza exactly like I like it.  The dough was delicious, not too salty like most doughs, and was airy and fluffy.  The sauce was sweet without being too sweet and all around flavorful.  It is extremely reasonably priced at 13 bucks for the pizza which makes me love the place even more.  

At this point we are late for our movie and are so in love with this place that a second bottle of wine and some dessert are in order.  The chef Eric Osbourn comes out and talks to us for a while and lets us know a bit about himself and the restaurant.  His goal is to bring gourmet foods in at an affordable price.  You can tell in talking to him that he serves things that he personally loves and that he loves food.  You don't get the feeling of a menu put together to maximize profit or to impress but to be as tasty as possible.  He is C.I.A. trained primarily as a pastry chef.  Ok seriously?  The rest of the food was so good and his specialty is desserts?  Sign me up.  After we talk to him for a while I tell him bring out whichever desserts we should have and a second bottle of wine.  He selects a sparkling wine for us and tells us he will be bringing out a trio of desserts for us to try.  

The first is a freshly baked Marscapone and Strawberry Phylo Pastry with Chocolate and Chili "Soup".  I am not a fan of chocolate but when the pastry was gone and there was chocolate left I started looking around the table for more things to dip in it.  The chilies were not overpowering at all but left a nice hint of spice.  Next we had a lemon sorbet, and a quince grenata with a raspberry puree, and a blueberry puree.  Both were good but the quince grenata with the blueberry puree was delicious beyond words.  Finally we had a chocolate flourless torte with, crme fresh, raspberry puree, and candied wine soaked quince.  The candied quince were sooo good.  I could eat a bowl of them with some crme fresh and be happy but add the chocolate torte and I was even happier.  

The entire meal (appetizer, pasta, pizza, 3 full desserts, and 2 bottles of wine) came in at a hundred bucks.  I got fast attentive service, from both Sean, who was an incredibly knowledgeable server, and Eric Osbourn, who is a fantastic chef.  I cannot recommend this place highly enough.   This will absolutely be a regular haunt for me as it is by far the best restaurant value I have found in Phoenix.  The restaurant is open til 2 on the weekends which will also make this a late night post boozin it up spot.

After doing some shopping, hubby and I decided on coming here to Jayde Fuzion for dinner. We didn't leave hungry! We were greeted with a warm welcome and our server was fast as we sat at the table to get our drink order. The service was excellent here. Our drinks never went empty and our server answered all of our questions.

The menu is very simple without having a ton of items on it, but it was still hard to decide was to order since it all looked so good. The prices are also very reasonable. We decided to get different items from the menu and just share it. 

Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($8) - These were pretty good. I personally prefer a crunchier lettuce, but it was good. The menu said this dish was spicy however there wasn't any kick to the dish all. The chicken still had good flavor and it is worth the price. It came with 3 lettuce cups and when I asked our server for more it was no problem.

Cashew Chicken ($15) - My favorite dish of them all! It was a great portion of chicken and put over white rice it was perfect. There were plenty of cashews and this is a dish I would probably order every time. 

Gochujang Pork ($15) - Apples are in this dish, but I didn't taste them. That's OK because whatever flavor it did give the pork, I loved! I will say that this was also supposed to be a spicy dish and there was again no kick at all. It's sort of frustrating when a dish says it will be spicy and it isn't, but it did have great flavor and I would eat it again. As with the other dishes it was a decent portion. 

Honey Walnut Shrimp ($18) - I don't eat seafood. I didn't try these! The menu says it was supposed to have a creamy mayo sauce, but hubby said the shrimp tasted more like a really sweet orange and wouldn't order them again. I thought they were presented well and nicely sized. 

Yuzu Doughnuts ($7) - These are yummy! The doughnuts are very light and not greasy at all. The doughnuts were filled with tasty yuzu glaze and more glaze with pistachios were on top. The refreshing citrus flavor and light texture of the doughnuts made for a nice dessert. 

They didn't open until 5 pm (when we happened to arrive) and people were already waiting to get in. You might want to call ahead and make a reservation. And come hungry! There is also a sushi bar.

There are few things I can justify waiting in line for in Vegas. Good food is one of them. After a 45 minute wait in line, we definitely built up a big appetite. I was excited to try the Wynn buffet, especially after running into our friends who were on their way back from the Wynn. They managed to wake up at 9am on Sunday to head over there for brunch. I'm sorry, but I need at least 5 hours of sleep! One of the girls was eating a shiny red candied apple that looked so good. I couldn't believe she got it from the buffet. The Bellagio buffet didn't offer candied apples!

While waiting in line, cocktail waitresses actually came around with little bottles of water, which was greatly appreciated. It helped ease my growling stomach. This time, we decided to do the $30 regular brunch instead of the champagne or Bloody Mary brunch although it was only a few dollars more. 

The atrium was nicely lit but the only tables available for two was right by the entrance, so we decided to sit in the main dining area. The nice thing about this buffet was that each area had a sign above it, so it was easy to locate everything. Because when you're hungry and know what you want, you don't want to go around looking for it. 

I was really happy with the variety, including the Asian food selections, and the carving station had bacon as well as prime rib. My favorite, of course, was the dessert station which included a variety of homemade ice cream flavors and toppings. The chocolate chip bread pudding was amazing straight out of the oven. All other desserts were ok.

I was really impressed by our server, who was really attentive. Our friends had recommended that we have their hot chocolate, so I made sure to get a cup. It was so good, especially topped with whipped cream. 

The couple who we sat next to also raved about the Wynn buffet, telling us that they made it a point to dine there every time they were in town. They said their dinner buffet was better though, just as most buffets are. 

We walked out of there with Wynn buffet babies - we were so stuffed!

After how many failed attempts, I've finally crossed Bacchanal off my "to try" list in Vegas. This time around was sweeter. A self check-in kiosk met us as we tried getting in line which asked for a name and a cellphone number for them to reach us when it's time to pay and get seated. 30 minutes of trying our luck with the slot machines and my phone beeped saying it was time. 

Time to get our glutton on, that's what!

I always scope out the different stations categorized by cuisines before getting anything. I've finally learned to skip the bacon and other breakfast items I can eat at home so I started with some dim sum, roasted duck, and hot and sour soup. Can I say that was the best SIUMAI I've had just yet? It's remarkably tasty and perfect in texture from all aspects. Try it and thank me later! Meanwhile, the duck was great but the hot and sour soup could use less salt.

There's a long line for the seafood station so I went for the carving station for a nice slab of PRIME RIB (yuummmm!) and got me some of the best SCALLOPED POTATOES with MUSHROOMS from another part of the buffet. Wow! I got two pans of these buttery and flavorful carbs. Soooooo gooooood! I was told the LAMB CHOPS would be dished out around 3pm but by then I was already too full. Something to try next time, that's for sure. 

Offering a selection of soups, I had their tomato basil soup, very delish, and their mushroom with truffle soup, very salty! Next to it is their bread station and take heed when I say get their mini CORN BREAD muffins. Mmmhmmm!

I finally lined up for the seafood station to start burning what I ate. Mussels, clams, salmon, and seafood paella were the hot ones that I partook. I forgot to return for the shrimp and grits but those looked good. Cajun crawfish was also some of the offerings I decided to skip on due to the eating logistics of that crustacean. However, I certainly could not pass up on the oyster shooters, cocktail shrimps, KING CRAB LEGS, and their fresh succulent oysters. I recommend everything I tried in this station, however, I thought the paella was just alright and was on the salty side.

Ending this gluttonous meal on a sweet note, I will have to say that among all the beautiful looking pastries and sweets I've tried, what's really worth indulging in are their CREPES! They have a station where they make it fresh for you with your own choosing of toppings such as sugar, syrup, and fruits. The texture and flavor is spot on. It's so good I could easily eat it by itself! Or, you can pair with it any gelato of your liking with so many flavors to choose from, if it rocks your boat. 

If there's anything that didn't impress me other than a few over-seasoned items, it would sadly have to be the service rendered to us by our server. She was an older lady who was somehow kind and very accommodating to all the tables around us, but us. She seemed cold, always rushing without stopping to hear what we're requesting. When she was leaving, she said, "My shift is done, I want to go home now! You want anything else?" And it wasn't in a friendly way. She moved on to the next table and got all friendly to them endorsing the server who was to take care of them when she leaves. And this is why you should tip only after you've been served.   

Bottomline, we were all happy with what we consumed despite the price tag it came with ($50 for weekend champagne brunch). Because we got seated around 2pm, we were able to enjoy some dishes that were served only for dinner such as the fresh oysters. Either way, I guarantee you will leave this place satiated not just with the quantity of food you'll get but with a quality worth noting.

I have this horrible affliction where I have to go to new restaurants when they open, I'm  very impatient. And I do this even though I know that newly opened restaurants inevitably have kinks to be worked out. I have been walking by Sens for months now and I've watched them put it together piece by piece and have been waiting for it to open. And what do you know, it opens the night of the Yelp party. Since I couldn't go to the opening, my husband and I decided to go on the second night. In reality this turned out much better because it was intimate and we were able to take a nice leisurely pace with the meal. Even the servers were saying it was better we came in when we did rather than for the opening since it was crazy and nobody really knew what was going on. 

I'm giving Sens 4 stars because yes, there are kinks to be worked out. I know that I will be there often given its proximity to my place and I fully anticipate giving it that 5th star once said kinks have been worked out. 

The Space- Think Asian diner/lounge. Yes, it is small, and the tables for two are not large enough to fit more than one plate at a time (slightly problematic for a place that serves small plates). There is a small lounge area off to the side which would make a really nice space for a semi private party. (They do take reservations, just call ahead). The bar and bar seating are definitely right in the main dining room. 

The Drinks- They sure know how to appeal to customers. We were offered complimentary shots of their infused drinks of blood orange sake (pass), pineapple sake (good), and lychee shochu (very good). My husband ordered a spicy mama, which had Thai chili infused shochu. My husband adores spicy drinks and this one really made him happy... reminded him exactly of the Thai chili martini that he gets at our favorite Thai place of all time in our hometown. 

The Food- There is nothing subtle about the food. Flavor is strong and very present. We chose four small plates, as we do in all small plate/tapas restaurants. We find four is always the perfect number. The first dish that arrived at the table was the clay pot lemongrass clams, which I would pass on in the future. The second dish was the volcano flamed beef which I would have to say was the best dish that we ordered, mainly because the flavors were the most subtle here- a little bit of peanut, a dash of mint. We did have 4 strips of steak and 2 lettuce wraps though, putting 2 strips of steak into one wrap was a bit much for me. The third dish was the seseme tofu which was very well cooked. Finally we finished with the ginger fish. When fish is cooked in a banana leaf it should absorb all the flavor from the cooking method, there was no reason for heaps of ginger to be placed on top of the fish. It was incredibly overwhelming. Our side of soba noodles were standard, even if they were delivered to our table after all of the other plates had arrived. They do not offer dessert so don't plan on having it there. 

The Service- All the servers were very friendly and engaging. They did feel the need to tell us how to eat every dish we ordered which I found annoying. I know there are a lot of people out there who have no clue but its best to ask us if we know how to cook our meat on the hot rock (sort of shabu shabu style). 

All in all I can see myself here often. The price is just right- the four small plates were more than enough to satisfy my husband and I for dinner and they came to $32 total. They do have kinks to be worked out and the food is not the best I've had but I am positive it will be part of our regular rotation.

This is the sort of review that the Liberty Market powers that be might not want to associate themselves with.  They should read it, and then disavow it if need be.

So we've been to LM a bunch of times.  I famously said that I'd eat myself to death on their red velvet cake (more on that later) but had marginally less success with the rest of the menu.

Well all that changed two visits ago.  My wife ordered the italia salad, which is sort of like an antipasto salad with garbanzo beans, kalamata olives (the lone blight on the salad, but I can appreciate that that's only my opinion), and italian meats with lettuce and tomatoes and all.  Totally delicious.  And I ordered the italian sausage pizza which is actually amazing.  Totally delicious.  It comes with ricotta cheese and onions, the ricotta being delightfully creamy and the pizza, on the whole, being perfect in every way.  Thinish crust (but not too thin) and just really flavorful.

We got all that last night, too, and it was amazing again, but the trip was marred by...

the worst customer ever to live.  If you see a mushroom-shaped woman probably in her mid 40s, wearing a visor on her mushroom shaped head, and a t-shirt with "talk to the (paw print)" emblazoned on the front, look out.  You'll recognize her by her disconsolate husband/significant other, who carries around with him the ethos of a beaten pet.

WOMAN: I'll have the (five thousand different desserts to go) and the pecan bar.  But NOT the pecan bar that was cooked on the side of the pan.  I HATE that.
HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay... what about that pecan bar right there.
WOMAN: NO! Not that one.  Look. You can tell that that one was cooked on the side of the pan.  No, I want that one (the one predictably buried under thirty others).  That *should* be all right.  It looks okay.
HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Uh.  Okay.  Sure.
WOMAN: (orders fifty more things)
HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: (rings up woman. she pays.)
WOMAN: And MAKE SURE that I don't get the pecan bar because (points credit card menacingly at HAPLESS EMPLOYEE) I am *very particular* about this.  If it doesn't look right, I will send it right back.
HAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay (reassuringly).  We will.  Thank you.

So I roll up behind her and give her a withering look as she turns away and commiserate with the homeboy at the bar.  Then we order, etc.

A couple of pointers.  One) if my wife thinks you're an asshole, you are.  She's got a pretty long fuse for this sort of thing.  And yes, that's how come we're married.  Two) if you're fat, why would you act so... fat?  It just reinforces the fact that you're a great big fat person and what the hell?

Fat person code: (I am an authority)
1. Don't act like if you don't get the exact pecan bar you want, that your life is OVER.  It may be true, but for fucks sake.
2. Don't order a disgustingly fatty triple-super-size quadruple burger with extra mayo and then a large diet coke.  You get laughed at when you do this.
3.  I would say DO diet and exercise but I'm fat and I think those two things are profoundly boring.

Anyway, I know this has dragged on but I talk so that I can hear myself talk, and the same generally applies to my writing.  BUT: If you are from LM, I HOPE YOU READ THIS BECAUSE...

Our red (please see updated below) velvet cake last night was (sorry about the parentheticals but the yelp-bots are to blame.) terrible**.  TERRIBLE!  We got it to go and whoever served it to us either grossly misunderstood the quality of what they were serving, or they should be fired.  I have (albeit indirect) experience with Joe (the owner/conceptual mastermind) and I am certain that if he knew that this five day old, dried up piece of cake were being given to customers, he would be upset. 

There were even two people in line ahead of me trying to decide between the carrot and red velvet and I told them they should get red velvet, hands down.  YOU MADE A LIAR OUT OF ME, LIBERTY MARKET!  And for this, I won't forgive you unless I get a free slice of (do I even need to specify "fresh") red velvet cake.

Having said all of that, every restaurant has it's moments, bad or good, and I forgive that and on the strength of the usual red velvet perfection and the deliciousness of everything else, I give LM five stars.

__________________

**Red Velvet Update: I have been in twice since and this most recent time, Kiersten (one of the owners) gave me a new piece of red velvet cake.  And a pecan bar, from the middle of the pan no less!  But I want to make this clear, just in case it isn't: I love liberty market--it's exceptional.  And I really want everyone to know that I've had the RV cake many times before *and since* and it has, every time, been amazing.  I still hold that it is the best piece of cake I've ever had.  So it clearly was an aberration this time.  And the carrot cake is almost as good.  Really.  The bread pudding is totally sublime.  If you get a dessert there, you won't be disappointed.  I promise

I noticed ZiKiZ while in the area a couple months ago and decided to bookmark it based on the positive reviews and the food sounded good. I met yelper Tracy P here for lunch and walking in we were greeted right away. The 2 men behind the counter were very friendly and told us about their menu. They said they specialized in customizing any order with what's offered on the menu. You pick if you want a wrap, salad or bowl (prices vary) and then pick what you want inside. They have chicken, steak, crab and falafel and a variety of veggies. 

Priced at $7.99 I ordered a "Chicken Wrap" with salad mix, red onion, black olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, ZiKiZ sauce and feta cheese (.50 cents extra for feta) inside a sundried tomato tortilla. I said that I would be eating the wrap inside, but would like the chicken on the side to-go. The guy looked at me kind of funny and said I needed to pick a protein to go into my meal. I looked funny back at him because he just told me a minute prior that they specialized in customizing any order, so what was the big deal with just putting the chicken on the side? I like the Greek Salad Wrap over at The Great Greek on Warm Springs and was hoping to create a wrap somewhat like that. I just said the chicken inside the wrap would be fine. My friend, Tracy had a coupon for $5 off any order over $20 which was a nice bonus. The guy accepted the coupon with no problem, but he majorly messed up when it came to ringing up our order. We wanted to add 2 sides and 2 drinks for an additional $2.99 each. He never asked us what sides we wanted and when we were looking over the menu deciding which ones we wanted, he says "oh I thought you'd want fries" and I was wondering why he was picking for us. I said no, we never asked for fries and don't want those, but we'd like to try the ZiKiZ rice. He then brought only 1 side of rice over and not the 2nd. Then he starts to talk to the next customer and we haven't even received our drink cups. I ask for them and he only hands 1 cup over. What the heck? We mentioned that we needed the other drink (deciding to just give up on the 2nd side we never received) and he just smiles and hands a cup over. I wasn't given a receipt, so I don't know how he charged me. I am thinking he didn't ring up the 2nd drink and side or something, but with the coupon our total was only $15 and some change, so not a bad price to try a new place out.   He did give the coupon back and said to save it to use again.

The rice was very bland. I really tasted no flavor and decided since it was in a container already to just take it home and give it to my dog with her dinner. The wrap was just average. I did like the taste of the tortilla, but the chicken really had no flavor and the veggies stood out more as far as flavor goes. With them not customizing my order the way I wanted, the food only tasting average, the mix up with sides and drinks and the food not being that great, I can't see coming back.

This place is going to be one of my new stops on my lunch rotation. Usually work in this area a couple times a week and now this just made it that much better. Hello Gourmet Tacos and then some!

Inside is very nice and rather modern looking. The menu items are written on some clear glass behind the counter and the soups of the day are displayed on a hanging roll of brown paper on the wall. Just place your order and find a table. You can see them cooking it in their small open kitchen.

Seating is somewhat sparse and there is an additional area out on the patio outside. Noticed a lot of people calling in their orders and picking them up once they were ready. This area definitely needed a place like this to pick things up a bit.

So far ... Ordered the Rib Eye Tacos on my first visit. They were perfectly cooked and were packed with flavor. Next tried the Mexican Hot Dog and the Torta Cubana. Very good and was too full afterwards for dessert. Today tried the Burrotote and some PapaNachos. Don't forget to check out the killer salsa bar with everything necessary to kick things up a notch.

Food is always very fresh and they use high quality ingredients. Been here several times and have not had a bad experience yet. Nice!

Too many cool things on the menu to list them all. How about fresh desserts made out of fruits, several kinds of flans, ice creams and yummy bakery treats to cap off the meal.

Service is very friendly and polite. Place is starting to get really busy and there can be small wait during peak hours. Did I tell you about the Soup of the Day? They will give you a sample to try while you wait.

Going to round up on this fine establishment. WOOHOO!

They sell pizza by the slice, so originally that was the plan. On the way in though I noticed a pizza special on the window for a $9.99 large (pick-up/carryout). I thought that was a great price to try out their pizza and this way it would be a freshly made pizza. Walking in it looked like a typical deli. There were tables inside and the usual pasta, tomato sauce, etc. for sale. The olives, meats and sweets they offer look very good, but they have no prices on anything. There are plenty of signs along the glass case promoting catering and their win on "Sandwich Wars" yet nothing saying how much per pound or per slice anything was. Maybe they were changing out prices and I came at an off time, but if I have to ask how much something is... I'm more than likely to just pass all together. 

The guy who took the order was nice and when I showed him my yelp check-in deal for a free "Mini Cannoli" he made sure I marked it *used* and said it would be with my order. He also said it would be about 10-ish minutes for the pizza to be made and that was cool by me. When the food was ready I checked my bag and there was no Cannoli. I had to ask for it and the girl who handed me the food acted like she had no idea about it and had to ask around. Finally, the guy who took the order came out and said "yeah yeah they get a free mini" so she went and packaged one up for me. 

The pizza deal wont be going on forever. The guy told me that they would be stopping it soon. Don't fret! If you get down here before it ends you will get a card that gets you the large cheese pizza for $9.99 every time. Score! 

Wow! The pizza was pretty darn good! I love when something as simple as a cheese pizza tastes so good. It seems lately I have been experiencing bland pizza, but not here. The sauce has a good flavor and I like the crust. I had some left over for lunch the next day and it was just as good cold! The Cannoli made for a nice dessert. I enjoyed it. 

They deliver!

Wow the 2nd best steak I've ever had.  Only behind the great Bern's Steakhouse in Tampa.  This is a bad thing, because I will never come to Vegas again without eating here.  A truly great steak is something special that you don't take for granted.  Once again folks get off the strip, and explore some of the best restaurants in town without the celebrity chef's name attached to it.

I've had Del Frisco's bookmarked for a while now and the only thing that kept me away is that I found out it was a chain, so how good can it be?  There are lots of Prime Steakhouse chains and while they are all pretty good, they aren't really that special.  Well this chain is small, only 10 locations.  I hope they keep it that way to keep up the quality.  We decided to really give the place a try and went with their signature special steaks.  The 32 oz Wagyu Tomahawk Bone in Rib Eye ($90), The 16 oz Bone in Filet Mignon ($60), and the Filet Mignon 3 ways ($60).

The 32 oz Wagyu just melted in your mouth.  I'm not usually a Rib Eye fan, but the marbling on the Wagyu is a beautiful thing.  I love steaks medium rare with a warm red center.  Our excellent server Tatyana, told us that the chef recommended going one degree more and ordering medium.  This way the excess marbling has a change to "melt" into the beef as it cooks.  I read a few reviews, that complained about this steak being too fatty.  I'm guessing they didn't take the chef's advice.  When cooked properly a Wagyu steak's fat content has a wonderful texture to it that just blends perfectly with a beef.  This steak was pure heaven and like I said, the 2nd best steak I've ever eaten.  Yes it's expensive but, at 32 oz, big enough to share with others.  I would share this steak, before going with one of their regular steaks.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2#QnGNcJnSUIKmtRx5-D5fOw

The 16 oz bone in Filet Mignon, isn't one of their regular steaks.  It's a much higher quality Filet than the other steaks on the menu.  Again splurge for this steak or you are missing what makes Del Frisco's special.  Served right on the tail of the Porterhouse bone, it's awesome and you are getting a large filet as they don't waste too much of the weight with the bone.  It pairs very well with the Wagyu and you will be happy going back and forth between them. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2#uUtykR97bd0p9_sMrBSkQw

The Filet Trio, while nice, seemed fairly ordinary compared to the other two steaks.  The steak quality here was similar to other prime steakhouses, but were seasoned a little more boldly.  My favorite of the 3, was the Brie Filet.  Melt Brie on anything and it's a hit.  The Huge Broiled Shrimp was slightly over cooked, and the oscar while ok, wasn't to the level of the steak it's self. Each was a good size 4oz filet.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2#7NRMtJHyxBEUaJLC7EB-QQ

If you want insurance that your steak will be special, order a side of the truffle butter.  This is melted table side and is amazing.  It isn't needed for the Wagyu or Bone in Filet, but a few bites here and there didn't hurt.  It definitely brought the Filet trio up to another level, as well as the Potato Wedges that came with my daughter's cheeseburger. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2#0pPPADGYUQ0GMgvAZjKMKg

Speaking of the cheeseburger, it's prime ground beef and was well seasoned.  If you are in Vegas for a few days, it wouldn't be wrong to come back and sit at the bar and enjoy this big burger with a few tasty sides. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2#PxzVgtdoc2OMmXJMGWB2mQ

Of the 3 side dishes we shared, the Potatoes Au Gratin were the only one that really stood out.  So cheesy with a nice strong cheddar and perfectly cooked cubed potatoes.  It was everything the Lobster Mac & Cheese should have been.  Not cheesy at all and more like a Lobster Mac & Bechamel, pretty bland.  The Mushrooms nothing special either.

Read way too many reviews not to share a slice of the 6 layer lemon cake with buttercream frosting.  It's big enough to share with a few people for sure.  Very moist and along with a dessert wine could be a great ending to a special meal. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-las-vegas-2#H2gQ4_Ti4oHafcxn3UH3lw

If you are a steak lover, make sure you bump Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steak House high up on your to do list.  Bookmark now and you'll thank me later!

Fine Dining while watching the open kitchen here was one of my favorite dining experiences in Vegas. We had made reservations for the L'Unique menu which was designed for people who wanted a complete meal but had limited dining time (such as before a show). For $59.00, we got to enjoy a fantastic meal of an app, entree and dessert- all served within about 15 minutes. 
Started with a bread basket that i'm sure would make Anthony N's bread basket notes. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=wcB4tCCHDP-MVZgumBWRIw It was served with 3 kinds: baguettes, country rolls and croissant rolls. The croissant was my favorite. They give u generous pads of butter and will give u extra bread- so eat up! You will be hard pressed to find better bread baskets. 
For the L'unique menu, we got to choose from two different items for each part of the meal. Between the bf and i, we got to try all of them. 
My dish: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=WtpRh5soYH-ievHYOznn7g
Everything was beautiful and tasted amazing. They gave a pretty good amount of lobster with the sole and the sauces and vegetables were perfect. The salmon and tuna tartare was yum and tasted very fresh. The dessert was light and delicious and so very pretty :http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=_t-FoXFZtmghxSyON9UZzg
Dude had the flank steak (cooked perfectly) with buttery mash potatoes, asparagus and the lemony berry dessert. Dude dislikes veggies, but he loved every bite of his meal.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUdalYTuAtnZm2K9zoH27Q?select=IDFSuLaOxP67CEmLH10DuA
The best part of this experience is watching the chefs making these beautiful dishes. Every chef had their special tasks in making each dish complete to perfection. We even saw a chef using tweezers to carefully place pieces together of a salad. Although the chefs and servers move swiftly to try to complete your meal in the promised 15 minutes, you never feel rushed or see anything done hastily. Our waiter checked on us just enough times to make sure everything was great and took the time to make conversation as well and answer any questions we had. 

Dude is a notoriously slow eater, and i had surprise tickets for him to see the Jabbawockeez after dinner. While he was busy taking photos of the decor and watching the chefs- i was afraid we were never gonna get to the show in time at the rate he was going, not even having touched his bread yet. But as dinner was served- to see his reaction to finally finding a vegas hotel restaurant that he truly enjoyed (he always complains they r never great)- from him watching the chefs, to enjoying every morsel on his plate, was well worth the price and nervousness!!!

*if you want the Ultimate Robuchon experience, go to his restaurant next door.  (inside the MGM)

When I stopped in for dinner the other night, I was surprised to see this place still called Martinez Taco Bar. I came by about 2 months ago and the girl who took my order said they were using the name Martinez Taco Bar for now, but said they would be changing to "Aranda's Taco Shop" and gave me a business card and coupon for a free agua fresca upon their re-opening. I was hoping after 2 months they would have worked out necessary kinks and have the menu in better order. That's something they are still working on according to the girl who took my order this time. it's confusing though because the menus posted on yelp and the menu they have posted on their walls and the printed menus they have out all are different from from the items offered to the price of them. I wanted to try certain things and couldn't because they say they aren't Martinez Taco Bar anymore and are changing the menu around some. Why still use that name after all this time and still not have your menu together? Loco! 

They have a large menu with basically the same thing over and over just in different sizes and maybe a couple different toppings. If you want a basic street taco those are $2 each and come with onions and cilantro. If you want a bit more on your taco and double the meat, the regular tacos are for you. The regular tacos were $3.75 and came with cheese, salsa, guacamole and double meat. They were out of guacamole on my first visit and so they gave me freshly sliced avocado instead and the same thing happened on this last visit. I don't know how they are out of guacamole again, but I have to admit that I really liked the sliced 'cado on my taco and wouldn't mind it that way each time. The street taco had decent flavor and for $2 is a great deal. There is a free salsa bar where you can dress your food as you wish or they have containers for you to fill up what you want if you are taking your order to-go. The price of the regular taco was steep, but it did taste good and I appreciated the amount of stuff inside it. I tried their Al Pastor and Carne Asada. The Al Pastor isn't the best in town, but it was OK as far as taste (a bit overcooked yet had a decent flavor) and something I'd order again if they weren't out of pineapple like they were on both my last visits. The asada was just OK for me, but my hubby did enjoy it. They weren't shy with filling up the asada tacos and that is a plus. There is a good size patio with tables and chairs outside. The food was good, but other kinks still seem to be holding them back in my opinion.

Both visits the soda fountain was out of order. I feel like this place has something, but they certainly have kinks to work out. if they are changing names they should do it and they should have menus that are all the same. It's frustrating to order 3 different things and be told that they don't serve it anymore. Hopefully they will get it together because I'd like to see them succeed being a local family run business. 3.5 stars.

Fresh herbs and produce, menu items under 600 calories, low sodium, no hfcs and everything made fresh to order is what made me excited for LYFE. 

It's been open a little over a week now. Located at The District Green Valley on the side where Whole Foods is. 

LYFE acronym for L.ove Y.our F.ood E. veryday is more fast/casual style to where you get in line, order and pay at the counter, seat yourself and food is brought out to you via high tech way of their GPS tracker. Cool huh? Well as long as your server doesn't take off with the round disc before you get all your food. Twice, when I was there it happened and both times the servers were at a lost as to where to find me. So TIP #1 ..don't let the servers take your disc until you get all of your orders!

Initially I was impressed on a first visit. Ordered a side Kale salad, Chocolate Budino and LYFE specialty water Hibiscus Beet. The drink was refreshing more lemony than sweet. The pudding was creamy and chocolaty! Love how it's made coconut milk, dark chocolate,agave,pomegranate chia seeds  It was an all natural and overall a healthier dessert! The side kale salad was paired with a lemon dressing..but in this case it was doused with lemon and pepper? It ended up being too bitter for me.

Second visit for breakfast next morning. It indicates they are open at 7am and 2 employees I asked the day before verified it. Well got there at little after 8 and even though there were employees inside, lead manager I spoke to when I walked in said it was not ready to open and will open later at 11 and start their regular business hours starting the next day. No apologies just straight up told me and turned back around and went about his business. Alrighty then. 

Third visit later that evening with Terri R. My order was for sweet fries, their delicious chocolate pudding again and orange ginger chia drink.Terri got the Unfried Chicken entree. Verdict: Skip Unfried Chicken dish. I only had 2 bites, that was enough for me. The chicken breast was uneven, ie one side thicker than the other which ended up being overcooked, too dry and lacked seasoning. Since there was veggies still left on Terri's plate, I went ahead tried it. It was under cooked! Even the baked garlic parm sweet fries I got were poorly executed. That too was under cooked. Sigh. 

I get ingredients used are higher quality and portion wise it's smaller to stay under the 600 cal limit. For the price they charge  though over ten dollars, I thought this particular entree was NOT worth it.

Fourth visit ..finally breakfast! It's served only till 11am.  Thumbs up for the quinoa buttermilk pancakes! Hurrah! Usually whole grain pancakes end up being too dry. But adding blueberries (extra .99)  in it helped add enough moisture. Every bite had warm blueberries with quinoa   At 4.99 this superfoods breakfast is a great deal!  It's a winner in my book. Skip the chipotle potato hash though...either they forgot to season it, or not enough seasoning..but was just blah! 

Touching on service. Front end cashiers friendly and efficient. The line moved fairly quickly. Staff on the floor needs work. 3 different employees had 3 different answers when asked a simple question "What time was closing?" It's emphasized they are all about being locally SOURCED yet no one knew where they get their produce. One of their management staff employee didn't even now how to pronounce the name of their breakfast entree correctly. Psst FYI ...Quinoa (it's Kin Wah not Kin No Wah). If you are newbie I totally understand but if you are running the place that's a different story. 

Ambiance, very inviting and reason why I like it here. It's spacious, plenty of seating both inside and outdoors. They even have a patio chairs and a dog bowl with water set outside. Love the natural lighting and decor ..a walled fresh herbal garden. The furnishings all modern. 

Fast forward a week later, Already slacking. There was a post it note that the sparkling water was out. While the tables are wiped clean, the floors were unswept and under the tables had bits of food debris...yeah...and they were slow to get my order out to me. 

Overall though everyone was working hard to please the customer. Even the president and CEO of LYFE(and former McDonalds CEO)  Mike Roberts (he ntroduced himself later) was real hands on and was busy emptying out trash from the bathrooms when I ran into him on the grand opening day.

I applaud LYFE caters to the health conscientious crowd.  I like it and will come back for breakfast and refuel spot for now. This place is borderline 2 stars "I Had Better" because if given a choice between other healthy choices in the area I still would choose Sunrise Coffee and Rachel's. But saving grace are the drinks, quinoa pancakes and dessert. SO bumped to 3 stars and a A-OKAY! I'm over the new kid on the block though, but dont miss out on LYFE!

My bf & I have always been fans of Gordon Ramsay. After watching the whole season of Master Chef Jr. I was mindblown at how those little kids could replicate Ramsay's infamous beef wellington. Everytime I see pics of his wellington, I start salivating, hoping to try it one day. Well...THE DAY FINALLY CAME!! I know he has the London West Hollywood restaurant in L.A., which served the wellington, but the reviews weren't great. I'm so glad I waited to try his food in Vegas, rather than the L.A. restaurant!

We had reservations at 9:30pm, but arrived to vegas a little late Fri night due to traffic. Luckily, they were able to accommodate us at 10:15PM.
NOTE: HELL'S KITCHEN TASTING MENU STOPS AT 930PM

We were guided through the "tunnel" and given the option to our table upstairs via elevator or stairs. The view upstairs is amazing with this giant neon structure of Gordon's hands making the wellington. The interior is chic decorated in colors of black and red w/ a big British flag painted on the ceiling. Downstairs is an open kitchen, bar, and framed photos of Ramsay. It's very classy yet romantic at the same time

Our server Yaron was such a sweetheart! We came for our anniversary & he made it very memorable. I felt like royalty dining in this restaurant!  After browsing the menu, Yaron pulled up the meat cart and the carnivore in me wanted to devour every meat on that cart! He said that if I finished the 24oz bone in rib eye, he'd applaud and give me a free t-shirt. I will most definitely be back to take on this challenge :D

Shortly after ordering, the fresh breads came out on a plate (different than most places serving it in a basket). We ended up eating 2 plates of the bread 'cause it was so bomb! I wanted to get some to-go at the end of the night, but forgot to ask. ALL 4 VARIETY OF BREADS WERE SOO GOOD. My fav were the brioches w/ truffle and pancetta (bacon). The walnut baguette was good as well especially w/ the butter. I LOVE the butter here w/ the sea salt. Gives texture & taste. 

English Chowder - smoked haddock, scallops, fingerling medallions, 
citrus pearls. Wow at first I thought it'd be like clam chowder, but this takes chowder to a different level. Initially it came out in the soup bowl w/ just the scallop, haddock, etc. & then the server pours out the soup from a little pot. Very nice, thick consistency yet not over laden w/ butter. Scallop was cooked to perfection! It was a very filling soup, not your typical chowder.

Maine Lobster - O..M..G.. the lobster was a work of art. The lobster cream was delicious, I wanted to lick the whole plate. Lobster was cooked to succulent and had a beautiful red color. Very tender, buttery smooth, fresh. The lentils were cooked perfectly as well, but I do wish that they accompanied this dish w/ something else other than lentil.

Beef Wellington for 2 - Over $100 for this bad boy. It's funny the say for 2, when really it's just one wellington, but cut in half. So usually if you order wellington for 1, you get just half the wellington..It literally took 45 mins to get this dish. The wait was agonizing 'cause my mind just kept thinking about how good it'd be. When the plate finally came my heart was racing. This dish looked exactly like it did on T.V.! Everything was beyond amazing. Pastry crust was flaky, filet inside was roasted to medium rare. All the flavors in one bite blended so well I was so amazed. The potato puree and red wine demi glaze were excellent. The glazed vegetables (parsnips & carrots) accompanying the dish had glaze that were shimmering.

Demi Roasted Bone Marrow - HUGE bones plated beautifully, decorated w/ green salsa verde. These totally blew away Mastro's bone marrow. I didn't care if my arteries would be clogged, these babies tasted so rich as we scooped the marrow out from the big bones.

Sticky Toffee Pudding - I noticed every table ordered this and so we had to try it since everyone raved about it & it's their signature dessert. I'm not sure why they call it pudding, when it it really is a date cake. I LOVE the brown butter ice cream, it's cute how they even made it look like a stick of butter. Yaron drizzled the toffee syrup onto the cake and as it flowed spreading throughout the plate I couldn't wait to dig in. The date cake was moist and when you eat the ice cream w/ the cake & toffee, it's an explosion of sweetness in your mouth.

We didn't finish til after midnight and were the last ones to leave the restaurant (they close at midnight). Midway through our meal, we felt bad staying so late so we told Yaron that he could bring out the dessert when the Wellingtons came out, but he insisted no rush and that we should take our time to enjoy our meal. That is customer service at its finest. We never felt rushed at all, truly an amazing experience at this restaurant. Can't wait to come back! O BTW, I wanted to get a pic w/ Christina, but was notified she has left and is now exec chef at BurGR!

I've had the wonderful opportunity to visit Brooklyn Bowl not once, but twice in one week and let me tell you, I couldn't WAIT to write this review.  Instead of writing a review the first time, I waited for two visits, so I could write a really well balanced review. I thought the first time was too good to be true. Man, I'm glad I waited...

FINALLY, a REALLY great space on the strip.  As a local, I try to stay away from the strip as it's too congested and inconvenient for the everyday life.  This place, will absolutely bring me back time and time again.  When you approach "The BB," you'll notice a very aesthetically pleasing olden day-type cinema sign.  From the outside, it doesn't look that big, but don't let that fool you!  Once you enter, you'll make your way up the escalators.  To the right is a little bar, high top table seating area.  This area is full of large windows which offers great views of the Linq.  To the left of the concierge desk are the restrooms and a couple of ATM machines.  Pass the desk and there's either an outdoor space with table tops and a smoking section to the right, and a lovely restaurant with another bar!  Then, the good stuff:  Passed all that, is a HUGE concert venue area and 16 lanes of bowling.  WOW!  Don't worry, there's a few more bars to keep you liquored up all night long.  If that's not enough, make your way to top VIP area where there's lots of balcony space for the concert, sofas for seating and 16 more lanes to bowl on!  In the VIP area, there's also a bar, an outside roof deck and even a very eclectic living room which offers comfortable couches, big screen tvs, quirky signs and lights, all encompassed with a quieter atmosphere.  SOOO AWESOME!!!  

Brooklyn Bowl is full of amazing features. All around, there's leather couches, palm trees, artsy signs, vines covering the walls and lots of exposed brick. Shows lots of character. The staff is also on point!  They are nice, attentive and EVERYWHERE.  All I have to say is the staffing department did an amazing job!  (There's your shout out, Java!) In all seriousness, one of my former coworker left our company to work at this place and I'm glad she did.  I'm absolutely amazed!  On my first visit, our server was Michael, who goes by Micah.  He was AH-MAZE-ING.  So accommodating, so nice and personable, so awesome. I firmly believe the overall experience comes from the tone a server sets and The BB is filled with positive servers and bartenders.  

I'm not going to lie, the drinks aren't cheap.  I payed about $12 for my Ketel One vodka and soda water.  WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?  You're on the strip.  If you're going to come here, make sure you can afford it.  If not, I think Southpoint has bowling and dollar drinks LOL.  I don't mind it at all, because I don't do this very often.  On both visits, I also had the awesome opportunity to try their food for free.  Here's what I had and here's what I thought:

BBQ pork sliders with cole slaw:  The pork was tender and flavorful.  The cole slaw added a crunchy texture and sweet taste.  The bun was good, maybe too thick, but didn't hurt the experience.

The San Gennaro Pizza:  VERY GOOD pizza.  It's filled with sausage, mozzarella and pepper.  This pizza is packed with sausage!  Lots of toppings offered NO complaints LOL. 

Chicken wings:  THE BEST THING THEY HAVE, BY FAR!  The batter was crispy and crunchy and light.  It was so flavorful with spices and not overpowering. It was served with honey which is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  It really just takes the wings to the next level.  So delicious.

Rolling Stone really hit home when they said Brooklyn Bowl is "one of the most incredible places on earth."  I really believe that on a Las Vegas strip perspective.  Who would have thought a venue that offers bowling and live music in one place would be such a hit!  This is exactly what Vegas needed.  Opening up with one of the coolest bands, The Roots, was a great move on their part.  Listen, if you're in the area, turn north on Koval and make a turn into Winnick street.  You need to park your car and walk to Brooklyn Bowl.  This place will blow you away.  Trust me, it's simply AH-MAZE-ING!

**Disclaimer: This is probably going to be a 2 part review just like I did for my 400th with Ortolan... we need a higher character limit....**

FINALLY!!  Hubert Keller is one of my favorite chefs, so ever since I first heard about him a couple years ago, I told myself next time I was in either Las Vegas or San Francisco, I HAD to go to Fleur de Lys.

It happened to be restaurant week in Las Vegas so our group had come here getting that menu in mind.  However that didn't last very long.

Our reservation was for 8:30, but a table where they were planning on seating us was taking their sweet ol' time and we were forced to wait.  After about 10-15 minutes of waiting outside, the hostess finally came up to us and offered us to wait in their lounge and enjoy complimentary champagne in their LOWLY lit lounge to apologize for the longer wait.  Free champagne?  Yes please!  The hostess was also kind enough to keep us updated on the table, waiting maybe an additional 10 or so minutes.

The lighting in the dining room was a little better and was thinking I could get away taking pictures without using my external flash on my camera (I hate using flash in a fine dining restaurant as I feel its a little bit of a distraction and nuisance).  Our table was slightly tucked away off in the corner, making out meal semi private.  Within a New York minute, our server, Marcus, was at our side, giving us our menus.  So like I said, we had come having in mind that we were going to get the restaurant week menu for $50.  However, right when we opened the menu, right there staring us down was Chef Keller's "Elegance Menu", which was 4 courses (instead of 3 on the RW menu) for $89.  Yes, a little hard to justify an extra course for $39, but, while some were the same, had more and better choices.  Such "better" choices included veal and potato ravioli and filet mignon.  The RW menu did not have the ravioli or the filet.

I started with the ahi tuna tartare with shaved fennel salad, a ginger ponzu sauce, and fennel seed tuile.  The tuna was very fresh and the ponzu wasn't too overpowering or salty.

My next course I ordered the veal and Yukon gold potato ravioli with English peas, veal jus, pea shoots, and a sunchoke foam.  The ravioli were pretty good but I do have to say the veal jus was a little salty.  I still very much enjoyed this dish.

For my entree, I ordered the prime filet mignon, with a potato puree, baby spinach, wild mushrooms, salsify, and a red wine reduction.  Medium rare of course.  The meat was cooked perfectly, though slightly underseasoned. The vegetables were perfect and the potato puree was very buttery.  There was an option to add black truffles and foie gras to the filet for an additional $25, and while I didn't partake in that, 2 others did.  The size of the foie was as round as the filet and they put A LOT of truffles.  I'm not talking about like maybe 3 or maybe 5 slices of black truffles.  It was a PILE of truffles, I'm guessing at least a dozen slices.  That right there, at $75/oz, definitely worth the $25.  And while seeing that much foie and truffles made me sad I didn't get it, they both gave me some of theirs so it was like I had gotten it myself.  Oh man... the foie was just... I had to take a moment.  I also said I didn't want to eat or drink anything else after having the foie for fear of washing away the flavor.  It was ethereal.

As much as I wanted to savor the foie gras, our dessert courses came out.  With souffle on the menu, I knew at least 3 or 4 people in our party would order it, so instead of ordering one for myself, I decided I would just steal a couple of bites of theirs and order the other item: a banana chocolate lava cake, served with a shot of peanut butter milkshake and Baileys ice cream.  The lava cake was really good and had a pleasantly subtle banana flavor.  The peanut butter milkshake was good.  I honestly didn't really get the Baileys ice cream.  Personally to me it just seemed to be a little bit of a disconnect.  I mean, if the pastry chef would kindly explain why he chose Baileys ice cream, then I'd probably understand.  But until then, your guess is as good as mine.

I'll end here for now because of the 5000 character limit... remainder of review shall come tomorrow....

We had been really excited to try Heart Attack Grill ever since seeing it featured on some Travel Channel show in 2010 some time. So when we learned that Heart Attack Grill was opening in Vegas on Fremont street, it was ON!

Flash forward to this past weekend. We stayed in Las Vegas and decided to make a trip to Heart Attack Grill for Christmas Eve dinner. Not your typical dining choice for one of the most special nights of the year; then again, Vegas isn't exactly the first destination folks think of for the holiday, either. So... It was par for the course!

Our journey down Fremont Street was one of excitement and anticipation. We were finally on our way to bad food ground zero! When we arrived, we took pictures of the front of the restaurant, including he parked ambulance in the front; funny stuff so far. 

Inside, we were greeted by a "nurse" who didn't even bother standing up from her seat behind the counter until we made it clear we wanted to eat. Weird. 

The restaurant was very empty. A few families were there, but it felt very cold and odd. To give them the benefit of the doubt, it WAS Christmas Eve. However, the design and execution of the place just isn't welcoming or even amusing. It's bad. An empty bar and walls filled with huge monitors that were so dim, they'd have looked better turned off. '80s music played along with their music videos on one wall. I guess that means the '80s were the flashpoint of shitty, greasy food. Or not. Who knows? Or cares. 

Our waitress was a nice gal, and we thanked her for working on Christmas Eve. However, a nice server doesn't make a crap restaurant much better than it is. 

Food ordered included a Single Bypass with lard-fried fries and a bottle of Coke. Bottle of Coke = no refills, and The Heart Attack Grill does NOT serve water unless you want to BUY a bottle. 

The fries we envisioned were golden and crispy, like McDonald's back in the day. Heaven, right? Wrong. They were limp and soggy, fried with their skins on. Not tasty and the texture was just nasty. 

The burgers were OKAY. Nothing great. It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger. The cheese slices were sandwich slices, the crease from the individual plastic wrapper impression could still be seen. Classy. 

Finally, the dessert of choice was a butter fat milkshake, vanilla, with an entire bar of butter blended into it for good measure. We shared and ate with spoons because the consistency is more like ice cream than a shake. And so... about half way, we decided that the taste of butter really overpowered the vanilla. That wasn't a good thing. When I finally put my finger on it and said, "This tastes EXACTLY like a Buttered Popcorn Jelly  Belly," that signaled the end. Because that IS what they taste like. Gross. Not even sweet. Just gross. 

The bill came to $30 for the two of us. Heart Attack Grill doesn't take cards, only cash. I thought the cheap-ass Asian places in Alhambra were the only ones that pulled that crap these days. But anyway.

We paid and walked out feeling like we'd been had. The waitress was fine and friendly, but the others (including a guy dressed like a doctor) walked around the place NOT interacting with guests, NOT making jokes or being lively. They just walked back and forth like zombies; the perfect environment to be wild, rude and crude. But no - total ambience fail. 

I honestly don't think Heart Attack Grill will survive very long in Vegas. There are too many dining choices. Especially when there is NO feeling of experience of even humor when you eat at the Grill. Just zombies taking your order with iPhones and hurrying back to doing nothing (or in the case of the hostess, sitting on her ass). 

What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us. To say we were let down is an understatement. I'd never recommend this place to anyone. The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.

What a lovely surprise located in...well...Surprise! Mr. Hottie and I decided to have dinner somewhere different. The plan was left to me so I decided to head out to Surprise. I have heard some rumblings of a new bistro out there so I hopped on Yelp to look it up. I made a reservation for 8pm and headed out the door. 

When we arrived we were immediately struck by the nice decor and cool music. We were greeted warmly and had to wait only a few moments to be seated. We got a nice dimly lit corner table, perfect. We surveyed the patrons, while the website does say the attire is casual, I wouldn't suggest coming in shorts and a t-shirt. Those who did, didn't look like they belonged. Maybe shorts and a polo? Maybe.
 
Anyway, onto our visit. Our hostess seated us and asked us if we had been there before. We responded no and she went on to thank us for our visit and welcome us to the bistro. What was cool about her greeting was that it wasn't like she was running through a script in her mind, it was actually a genuine welcome! No dead behind the eyes Scottsdale hostess here! Our waitress, Jessica was friendly and bubbly. She usually worked the lunch shift so she was a tad shaky on dinner service but we were forgiving. She was doing a great job and trying really hard to make sure we were happy. 

We started out with a martini. Mr. Hottie had a "Stuffed Goose" which is Grey Goose with stuffed blue cheese olives. I had the Valentino, a pomegranate martini. We both enjoyed our cocktails. We also ordered a 2004 petit syrah to go with our dinner. 

Ahh.. dinner. Let's start with the appetizer. (Tree hugger/PETA member beware) 
We ordered the foie gras. The plate was very unceremoniously dropped onto our table by a food runner. She didn't even announce what the food was, just sort of plopped it in front of us and said "There ya go!". Not kidding. Oh well, a minor hiccup. While I was expecting a nice seared piece of duck liver, we got something more in the line of pate. It came with hunks of toast and a compote of apple and figs. It was still VERY delicious. Not as savory as a seared piece of liver, it was still very yummy and I will get it again. 

We also shared a beet and goat cheese salad. I grew up thinking that I detested beets. They came out of a can, and they tasted like pennies. WRONG. I actually got coaxed into trying beets again and they were so yummy! The goat cheese with the beets were great! The bed of arugula was a little much for me, but that's a personal choice.  

Mmm Dinner...We both ordered something from the Chef's entrees of the day. Don't be sad when you see the small dinner menu. The chef adds about 3-4 entrees onto that. Mr. Hottie ordered the thick cut pork chop topped with an apple and bacon mixture, and on the side was broccolini and curried cauliflower, talk about savory and spicy (not HOT but just full of flavor). The pork chop was perfectly cooked, if you like your pork chop well done. It wasn't too dry and the meat was moist and tender. The curried cauliflower was crisp and fresh, not at all mushy.  I had the duck breast with sticky rice, cabbage rolls and a slice of roasted pineapple on the bottom. It was DIVINE. The duck breast was juicy and delicious. All the flavors ran together in harmony. The cabbage rolls were just that, a small egg roll filled with cabbage. Sounds simple right? Wrong, the cabbage was so good. It was very well seasoned and the roll wasn't greasy at all. The ONLY thing I would have changed is that the ball of sticky rice was CRUNCHY on the outside. I don't know if that was the intention of the chef, but being a sticky rice/ any rice eater, it came off as though the rice had been left out to dry. Other than that, heaven. 

We took our time with our dinner, sat, drank wine, and surveyed the area again. The chef had made an appearance at the table next to us. I understand that one of the gentlemen at at the table was from France and that is where the Chef is from. So she made a very friendly visit. As our dinner lulled and the restaurant emptied a bit, we were hoping the chef would stop by to say hello as she was blowing out candles around us, but she left us alone with our wine. Oh well, maybe next time I'll grab her. After all there was a lot of hand holding and goo goo eyes going on at our table. Maybe she didn't want to interrupt. We did get visits from the Chefs Hunky Husband who was very courteous, and the Hostess came by again to make sure our visit was going well. Talk about great service! 

Vogue Bistro is a breath of fresh air in an area riddled with chain establishments. I suggest restaurant owners take notice and maybe form a restaurant row or something. Wouldn't that be cool!
I have a feeling that Vogue Bistro will be on my list of places to go whenever I'm way out west. This place was fantastic and a must try!

I had eaten at the Earl of Sandwich on the strip a few times and liked it, but never new we had another location at the Palms. That was until I got a coupon booklet in the mail for a variety of places at the Palms, Earl of Sandwich being one of them. I signed up for the Earl of Sandwich e-club after the first time I ate at the strip location and for my birthday this year they sent a coupon good for 1 free sandwich and 1 free drink, no purchase required. Score! Since I had the coupon from the booklet at the palms with a BOGO and the birthday coupon this seemed like the perfect time to try the location at the Palms and eat for almost free. :)

This Earl of Sandwich is located in the food court of the Palms Hotel & Casino, between Chronic Tacos and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. It is open 24/7. The one thing I noticed different about this location from the other one on the strip is they have no inside seating. You have to find a table (not many) in the middle of the food court. Also, the "order here" and "pick up here" lines are very close together. While placing my order I had to move out of the way and stop placing my order twice so that other customers could get their food. They need to really make some adjustments as far as where people should place an order and pick one up. 

The girl at the register who took my order was very friendly and polite. She had trouble getting one of the coupon codes to scan and after she asked the manager for help several times,  was finally able to get it on her own. I felt bad that the manager was ignoring her and talking on her cel phone instead. They had a promotion going on called "Dine with the Royal Couple" that offered 2 sandwiches not regularly on the menu. The 2 sandwiches were the "Avocado BLT" and "Pastrami Reuben" both priced at $6.99, but I used the BOGO and ordered 1 of each. I left off the kraut and thousand island dressing and just requested mustard be put on it. I usually would love having the sandwich the way it came, but hubby doesn't like the other stuff so we just customized it a bit since we were sharing each sandwich. The Pastrami Reuben was very good, but skimpy on the meat. Hubby would have to eat 2 of these to get full. The Avocado BLT was also very good except some bacon pieces were too fatty while the other pieces has great meaty flavor. The bacon was cooked fresh so kudos for that. All the sandwiches are made fresh to order here. They were generous with the fresh avocado too. So for the free sandwich from the birthday coupon I ordered a "Full Montagu" priced at $6.49, but of course the awesome coupon took care of that! The Full Montagu has roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, tomato and mustard sauce. I had them leave off the lettuce. So with everything I said was in the Full Montagu you would expect something pretty big right? Nope! This sandwich was very good, but again just too skimpy on what they put between the bread. With the coupons we did get full though! I do like that the sandwiches are generally under $6.49 so even if hubby needs to order 2 to get full, it really isn't any more in price then ordering a burger and fries at a average restaurant. 

Earl of Sandwich also offers a variety of salads, wraps and artisan soups (soup selection changes daily). They also have sides like coleslaw, potato salad, pasta salad and chips. Breakfast is served daily until 11 am and they use fresh cracked eggs! There is a kids menu and when it comes to dessert Earl of Sandwich has a lot of tasty looking sweets, including brownies made with Ghirardelli chocolate.

I picked a good night to try Sabatino's. I called in to see if they had any specials going on and since it was Monday, The girl on the phone suggested the "Monday Special" to me. Mondays you can get a large cheese pizza (dine-in or carryout only) for $8.99 (regularly $12.99) plus tax and $1.50 for each additional topping. I thought that was a great price to see if I would even like it or not so I ordered a "Pepperoni Pizza" for pick up. The ordering process was easy and I appreciated the great customer service the girl taking the order gave and going over the specials with me.

When I arrived the place was full of people so I took this as a good sign. The inside isn't very big, but clean and cozy. I walked over to the cash register and was greeted by a nice young girl who rang me up and went over the weekly specials with me while my pizza was being boxed up. She also gave me a menu to take home and look over. It wasn't too cold of a night so I asked for some paper plates so hubby and I could eat our pizza at one of the many tables I noticed outside on the way in. Plates, pizza and now drinks in hand we headed outside.

When I first opened the pizza box it didn't look that appetizing, but we all know looks can be deceiving and that was the case this time. The sauce on the pizza is really what stood out to me. The sauce was just tasty! The cheese, crust and pepperoni were good. I had some that was left over for lunch the next day and it tasted just as good, even cold! I will be back to try other menu items!

Pizza sizes are medium (14"), large (16"), extra large (21") and Sicilian. 

They have over a dozen lunch specials, but here are a few:
-slice of cheese pizza and a side salad for $4.99
-slice of cheese pizza and 1 garlic knot slider for $5.99
-2 slices of cheese pizza for $5.99
-any regular sized hot or cold sandwich and fries for $8.99
-spaghetti with marinara and garlic bread for $4.99

All lunch specials include a drink! Lunch specials are currently from 11 am - 3 pm.

They offer delivery with a minimum $12 purchase and deliver pretty far out so call and check to see if they deliver to you.

If you are looking for an affordable family meal you might want to check out their "all you can eat anytime" deal. It costs $7.99 and includes cheese pizza, any pasta with marinara, and a side salad. I am assuming when I walked in and saw so many people, that they were taking advantage of this deal, but who knows. 

Tuesday and Wednesday if you buy any entree, large or extra large pizza at regular price, you get a 2nd of equal or lesser value for half off. Dine-in or carryout only.

Where to go for a good breakfast after a red-eye flight to Vegas? Try "eat." in downtown Vegas. Unusual name, yes, highly recommended!

Located on the 1st floor of an apartment building at the corner of Carson St. & 7th St., "eat." is a casual & trendy restaurant known for its upscale American breakfast/lunch entrees w/ southern & New Mexican touches, while using quality & locally sourced products. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=sloCm07roLTYRRVg5PHCJQ 

During a recent Vegas trip during Spring break, my son & I had our 1st meal in Vegas - breakfast at eat. on a weekday mid-morning.  Our entrees were delicious, & the presentations were eye-catching. We had the following:

- Golden-brown pancakes w/ chicken-apple sausage ($9). This order came w/ thick pancakes w/ a grilled chicken-apple sausage sliced down the middle & garnished w/ powdered sugar & a strawberry sliced in half. The pancakes, crispy at the edges & so fluffy & soft on the inside, were perfectly done.  They were so delicious & were the best that I've tasted! They came w/ butter & cute little sealed jars of 100% maple syrup from Vermont, instead of the sticky tabletop syrup dispensers; the pancakes were so flavorful that you really didn't need to use that much syrup. The entre is so generous that I could not finish it; next time, I'll just have a side order of one pancake to satisfy my craving & try another entre. The full order would have been good to share amongst a group of people. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=d371vDGyCTtrV47Wfezxig 

- DWBLTA w/ fresh made-from-scratch tomato soup & pickle ($11). This sandwich is their version of a BLT consisting of smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato, & avocado w/ chipotle mayo on buttery toasted sourdough.  (DW stands for Don Welch, who is one of the restaurant's investors.) I was impressed w/ the thick slices of smoked bacon & avocado, which made the sandwich very creamy & savory; the ingredients complemented each other very well. The tomato soup was very flavorful.  This entre is a winner! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=KfcNl_Zk82sijLfZcCy5Rw 

We chose the above two entrees based on the resounding comments posted in other Yelp reviews. They also have other popular dishes which we will try  the next time:  chicken fried steak, shrimp & grits, beignets, huevos motulenos, eggs done in different ways, salads, many types of sandwiches (roast beef, chicken, grilled cheese, veggie burger, Rueben, shrimp), & freshly made chips. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=HaumAEuf9JqmIJP_lQej4g http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=epkj9L81E8G3DUDyjjNq5A http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=xKU896f0iS1uFBqYkSFEgg 

Service was very attentive, as the servers, in their signature black attire, ensured that our orders came quickly, dirty dishes taken away promptly, water glasses refilled regularly,& periodic checking in assuring that everything was okay. In fact, I found out afterwards that chef/owner Natalie Young will appear in the dining room & converse w/ diners to get feedback in improving her operation (I don't recall if she did talk to us, as I didn't know who she was at that time.)

The restaurant seats about 60 people. The interior is full of charm w/ a mixture of brick & green walls & a cemented floor. The walls are adorned w/ artwork of local artists.  There are orange metal chairs made from recycled materials, partial booths of a green color, tables, & a bar counter facing an open kitchen. Fabric napkins are used. Cute recyclable boxes are used for doggie bags. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=zsaULVQQOqXcBg4WOb7eBA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=4Pp0OeG2PEltnI1XhuvK-Q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eat-las-vegas-2?select=1XAw57xgR3526XmFH1h4Tw 

Opened in Sept. 2012, eat. was the first restaurant to be part of the Downtown Revitalization Project in luring businesses to be part of the permanent venture. Its chef & owner, Natalie Young, was tapped for this restaurant; she had 12 years of previous experience at restaurants on the Strip, such as Hard Rock Caf, MGM Grand, & Paris LAS. She named the restaurant "eat." to describe a place where locals can come, eat, & talk/enjoy one another. In its first 34 days of opening, the restaurant served 2,300 customers!

Metered curbside parking available.  No reservations taken. We did not have a problem in finding a parking space, nor did we have to wait to be seated, probably because it was midmorning on a weekday; we heard that there are lines on weekends.

Can't wait for our next trip to Vegas so we can eat at eat.!

I was in my Hometown for the Christmas celebration with my family. My Dad wanted to treat us to an All-You-Can-Eat Friday Night Fish Fry and gave us a couple of places that serve one. It wasn't hard for me to choose. Prairie Lanes was a place that I spent many hours at as a kid. The Bar & Grill part is all new & refurbished, so I wanted to see the new changes. Plus, I remember there not being a menu because of the limited options they had "back in the day". Now, they have a full menu to offer. We made plans to all meet up at 5:30. 

Prairie Lanes has ample parking all around and we found plenty of spots available. They have entrances on the North, South, and smack dab in the middle of the place. The best entrance for the Bar & Grill is the middle. You will find the Bar area immediately. There is a host stand, and they will find you a table or booth. We needed a table for 7 and there was no issue with that. We got a big round one right away. Getting settled in, our server stopped by asking about drinks. I don't think anyone of us knew what we wanted. She offered waters to us all, which we accepted. When she returned with the waters, only two of us had figured out what we wanted to drink. I asked about tap beers and our server grabbed a table tent off a booth to show me. She said she would be back with the two sodas that were asked for. Most choices seemed domestic on the tap list. Our server brought the sodas and started taking our food order at this time. In all, 3 AYCE Fish Fry's, one senior Fish Fry, and two kids meals. I also ordered a High Life on tap. The Fish Fry comes standard with Beer Battered Cod, Salad Bar, Soup Bar, & choice of potato. The choice of potato is French Fries, Baby Reds, or Potato Pancakes. I went with the Pancakes. Alyssa did Baby Reds. 

I checked out this Soup Bar first which is right next to the Salad Bar. They offered up 3 kinds of Soup. Clam Chowder, Chicken Noodle, & Wisconsin Cheese. They also offer bowls & cups for dishing your Soup in. I grabbed a bowl of Clam Chowder and headed back to the table. Alyssa made her way up when I got back. I put a little pepper in my Chowder & dumped in the little packet of oyster crackers offered. Creamy, Hot & Fresh. But as Alyssa put it. It tastes like it came out a bag. It wasn't bad. Just....basic. I went up a second time to try the Chicken Noodle. I did a cup of it. The noodles are big and thick. The broth is flavorful. Hardly any chicken in it. Next up, Salad Bar. This is surprisingly solid. They have all the bases covered on this one. Everything was fresh & full. They had an attendant right there monitoring it. Coleslaw is available here, too.  It's something that I didn't try. 

I was a couple of bites into my salad when our dinners arrived. The Fish looked good. Two pieces of Golden Fried Beer Battered Cod. The Potato Pancakes not so much so. When I think of Potato Pancakes, these I didn't have in mind. They were little McDonald's like Hash Browns. Or Larger Burger King like Hash Rounds. Take your pick. Tasted like 'em, too. Straight out the freezer. Slid out the bag. Into the fryer. They tried to make them authentic by providing Applesauce & Syrup to dip them into. The Baby Reds Alyssa got were nice. They looked pan fried. The Cod Loins were cooked too much. Cutting in, they clumped instead of flaked away. Biting down, you knew it. Firm. Not tender. It's one of those thing where it's not bad, just not good. Seeming that they only offer one kind of Cod, Deep Fried. They should be able to handle cooking it the right time. Ah well. There's always the reorder, right? Those were overcooked as well. Not burned, just over done. By 2 or 3 minutes. When I mentioned this later, everyone who ordered Fish thought the same thing. I had to ask for lemon, as for that didn't come with the supper, but tartar sauce did. It tasted fine, just seemed like it came out the bottle.

Our server was so very patient with us. When we were indecisive of drinks, she didn't blink an eye. She was always checking up on us. Awesome job by her. The AYCE Friday Night Fish Fry costs $11.99 here. Could be worth it, if the Cod is cooked proper. For what we got, it's a little steep. The menu here is nice. They have a burger that me, living in the Twin Cities, was surprised to see. The Juicy Lucy. While it might not be the way I'd spell it (Jucy Lucy), it sure was a welcome to see. I tried to get someone at the table to order one, to no avail. Probably a good thing. I'll take 'em out for an authentic one when they come to visit us.

The only thing that could've possibly made my meal at The Estate House any worse, is if we had to pay for it...

My bf and I stopped by for a drink on the night of their grand opening about 2 weeks ago... it was beautiful and the staff was pleasant; many of them my bf knew from previous workplaces.  So, he decided to have his birthday dinner there.  BIG MISTAKE!

The meal we had last night was a comedy of errors... First off, there were 12 of us there and the way that they sat us (in the Butler's Pantry) was not ideal for our group.  We took things into our own hands and pushed our 2 tables together to make it easier to talk amongst ourselves.  

Although Roman (I think that was our waiter's name) had good intentions, our service was horrendous!  We had to ask for menus after a half hour of being seated.  We had to ask for bread several times before it arrived probably an hour later, and then some of us (like myself) never even received any bread.  We also had to ask for water and drink refills throughout the 3 HOURS we were there...

The menu itself was extremely pricey and fairly limited.  Not only that, but the menu lists a special 'tasting menu' but somehow it wasn't available yet... nor were there any specials.  We all finally decided and were able to place our order.

One thing that the staff was good at was clearing and bringing back fresh silverware.  I think they moved my silverware around 3 times even though I would've been good with just one set.  Since they cleared my silverware that I hadn't touched before appetizers were finally served, I had no fork even if I wanted to sample from someone else's order... The Wild Arugula Salad that was supposed to arrive with "Warm Camembert," toasted marcona almonds and  blood orange vinaigrette arrived cold and all 3 people that ordered it had to send it back... other appetizers that arrived and some of the people in our party ate were the mussels and the winter squash risotto.  

So, like I said, our reservation was for 7:30 and we were all seated by 7:45... so, when I looked at my watch and saw it was after 9:30. I was a little bit disappointed that our entrees weren't there yet.  After all, we were planning on meeting some other friends for drinks after dinner, and this was taking a really long time.  I think that everyone else at the table was feeling the same way.  We were all hungry and antsy and upset that the waiter or GM hadn't even acknowledged that it was taking a ridiculously long time.  So, the birthday boy spoke up... and asked for the GM.  I think it took another 30 minutes before the GM came over and acknowledged us.  Note - the food was still not there.  He was reactive instead of proactive apologizing but not offering anything.  He asked what we wanted him to do and we all just said to bring our food!  At this point it was 10pm.  He promised it would be there in 5 minutes.  Ron (another member of our group) looked at his watch and 5 minutes later, still no food.  Roman attempted to bring us a bottle of wine, but we didn't even want more to drink at this point...

So, at about 10:10. our food began to arrive in piece meal...  2-3 entrees at a time and several minutes apart.  Many of the entrees were overcooked and had to be sent back and the person that ordered marlin was served tuna by accident so when the person that ordered the tuna didn't have her meal, we figured out their mistake.  The waiter then had the audacity to ask the person that ordered the tuna if she wanted a new one.  (There was already a bite taken out of the tuna that was served in error).  Of course she did!  Unfortunately, we were all done 20 minutes later when the new tuna finally arrived.  I had the "Estate House Fruit De Mer" which was actually pretty good.  (However, at 10pm, anything would've been good in my eyes).  

We basically had to tell the GM that there was no way we were going to pay for this horrendous meal... you would think we'd get apologies again or something, but no.  We left a decent tip for Roman, and never even had birthday cake for the birthday boy... bummer!  At that point we just wanted to get the hell out of there!

Fortunately, we had much better service upstairs at the 3rd floor level bar where they had a piano player until 11pm.  We met some other friends there and attempted to laugh at the miserable meal we'd just had... Side note - Charles Barkley and his wife were also at the restaurant and had a 3 hour meal as well - we know this because we swapped stories over drinks upstairs after the fact.

The Estate House has a lot of kinks to work on... I doubt I will ever return to eat there again... I do recommend going for the ambiance and drinks on the top level.  Gina and Bill will take good care of you there... Aside from that, I would tell you to save your time and $$.

It was Pittsburgh Restaurant week and I was beyond excited to try a few new places.  We booked reservations to two places, one being Paris 66 Bistro  and this was the H's pick.  I checked out their prefixed menu online and thought yea this could be really good.  
 
Parking was tricky, but they have a valet at a very reasonable price of $3.00.  The restaurant is quaint but nicely decorated.  They have white table cloths but cover them with paper I guess to save the effort of changing the linens every few hours.  When I say every few hours I mean that was about the time it took us from start to finish to complete our experience.  Not a positive.

After being seated we glanced the prefixed menu, which we had already decided upon and waited.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited some more.  Our waiter finally appeared, not sure what took him so long, but he seemed stressed.  We ordered drinks wine for me French Martini for the H, and immediately put in our order.  I requested the escargot and asked about the Boeuf Bourguignon which was one of the options for the entre the other was salmon.  Our waiter immediately began pushing this lamb special they were having.  He stated he would not order that and he didn't like it.  Compared it to a well done stew.  Um ok.. I said what about the salmon?  He said that was better than the beef but still not one of his favorites and wouldn't suggest it, but he said the sauce was really good.  What the heck?  He was pushing the regular menu and or the special, even stated the food on the menu was much better than the not so cheap $45.00 prefixed meals.  . We didn't allow this to alter our intentions of ordering off the restaurant week menu but I did decide to go with the salmon over the beef.  We both got the goat cheese salad for the appetizer, H went for the beef regardless of the waiters disdain for it, and I got crme brulee and he chocolate mousse.

To the most annoying part. The wait!  We waited for everything!  Our initial drinks took 15 minutes and when done  we waited forever with empty glasses.  The best part is I pushed the glasses to the edge of the table as to be noticed easily as our waiter passed several times, yet he did not stop to address it.  No actually he sped up as to avoid us calling him out as he dashed past our table.  I would have considered them moderately busy, not hustling past tables that are in need of drinks busy!  So we probably waited about 15 minutes before he finally stopped to get us a refill.  The refill process wasn't quick either, and we noticed that the servers made their own drinks.  Hmmm in a management perspective I think this is a bad idea.  But hey if it works for them, which it don't, then oh well.  He brings the drinks and in the process of setting them down he catches the H's on the tacky white paper covering the table cloth and spills a good sip or two of his martini.  The waiter blames the spill on said paper and says the next one's on me.  

At least 30 more minutes, and still nothing. We came hungry this wait was excessive.  About 45 minutes in we got some bread and he dropped off a complimentary bowl of zucchini foam, quite tasty.  An hour in and finally my escargot show up.  H wouldn't even consider trying these puppies and good thing cause they were tiny.  They were quite good, but drowned in butter, garlic, and parsley that that was the primary flavor so I can only describe the escargot texture like a portabella.  Again very good, just wonder what they would have tasted like without all the disguisers.    

Hour and 15 in, salads show.  I have never waited so long for a side salad, yet it was quite delectable.  The goat cheese mixed with the fresh veggies and delicate dressing made a very well balanced salad.  The problem, it was a small portion so we ate it in less than 5 minutes leaving us hungry and waiting for entres.  So another 35 minutes pass and they show up.  The H really liked his beef so I am glad the waiter didn't deter his opinion, however it held the same challenge as the previous courses.  Small, tiny, teeny, itsy bitsy.  My meal held a little more bang for your buck.  The salmon was done nicely, though this sauce that was spoken of was hardly apparent.  The rice and asparagus that accompanied the dish were perfectly cooked.  In the course of eating again we were out of drinks and the empty glasses again sat at the edge of the table, where I would learn they would spend the rest of the night since he hustled past plenty of times without stopping.  Our final course desert arrived, Tasty we both enjoyed.

So in the end would I go again.  Unfortunately probably not.  The food was quite flavorful, but the portions do not represent the price tag, and being dodged for drinks in the almost 3 hours we were there was frustrating.  I would think that would be a no brainer, hello we want wine and cocktails, we drink more your tip goes up, sadly no.

* Since there's no ONLINE MENU - I took pictures for ya'll! Look in the photo gallery. * 

The namesake carries some heavy expectations and also prejudices for a TV personality, but this place really has done justice even on just their 2nd day of being opened. I was excited for this as a few days prior I walked by and they were having a meeting. I stood there listening in and looking through the curtain like a total creeper.  I was worried there might be a wait, being a famous name, and brand new. I did try to call, but had a hard time getting to them and decided to come chance it anyways. It was busy, but there was no wait to be seated when we came at 5ish.

The menu is a cheeky paper menu that they encourage you to take as a souvenir, if you wish. With us being a bit of fans, yes, I took mine home. *blush*. Some people might be confused with the two different pricing but the orange is for Total Rewards members of PH Hotel&Casino so before dining, go get a card for a savings of $1 off per each item you order. 

The Farm Burger - this was a rather good burger if you like something to showcase natural flavors than big zesty spicy accompaniments. You can tell the meat quality is top notch and the flavor on it is fantastic. We did order a medium rare but it was more on the medium side, just a small oversight. The duck bacon was a curiousity, but basically just like bacon, just less fatty than pork. The brioche bun was so lovely soft and had a perfect flavor and toast to the inside. The egg is always a good flavor with beef. It needed a tad something to tie it all together so put some of the chipotle or curry ketchup on it! It isn't a huge burger, but trust we were full splitting all our items and I can tuck in and eat. 

Fresh roasted chili dawg - so the beef "devil dawgs" are cooked in a hellfire hot sauce and then grilled. I would rarely say a hot dog is gourmet or worth paying for, but this was seriously good. Fuck Pinks next door (its not like the one in LA anyways), and get this instead! I love the crispy texas toast like hot dog bun it was on and the dog was snappy, and super juicy and does taste of hotsauce it was cooked in! The toppings of the jalapeno, roasted fresno peppers, avocado, onion, cheddar and chipotle mayo were perfect with it. 

Just Fries - these were lovely skin on fries. I read in a press junket they use a specific more fluffy potato and do the 3 step fry method. These were crisp yet fluffy, not thick but not thin either and for me that's the ideal fry. The chipotle and curry ketchups were both very good, I didn't have a favorite. I just alternated every other fry.  

Shake # 5 - they split ours up for us which was a nice move on their service. This was rich and so good. I love the texture and flavor contrast between the shake and the swirl of pudding they put. This one was chocolate hazelnut pudding with coffee shake and a awesome praline cookie thin. It didn't taste too much like hazelnuts though, but more like chocolate caramel pudding but still good. It was good to split, it would have been too much for me to do one whole. 

Service was super friendly, personable and attentive. Much more cohesive than I would expect of a newbie restaurant. They asked how we heard of them, hows our day going, explained the menu, etc as we sat down and browsed. Our drinks were filled without ever asking and we were checked on a few times to see how we are doing. Their uniforms here are something else. Ladies are very form fitting and short so there's a eyecandy element to this place. After ordering our food did take a while to get to us so we sat around for a bit. Still, I would rather have it cooked right than rushed to where standards are lowered. 

Very satisfied with this meal and will be returning absolutely! Of course on principle I do reserve 5 stars for consistency upon return visits, but this is a highly recommended 4 stars. Definitely one of the better burgers I've had in this city and I don't trek onto the strip for bollocks either.

So I just got back from Vegas...... and you know that anytime anyone who goes to Vegas and back always have a new review posted shortly.  (You don't understand how excited I am to be back just so that  I can write this review for you...LOL!)  So without any further delays, let me share with you what I've discovered while I'm there for a very short, quick, and fun weekend!

COSMOPOLITAN.... A brand spanking new hotel sitting right next to Bellagio, has finally opened up it's doors to the glitzy lights of Vegas.  Even though this review is not about COSMO, let me tell you a little bit about it....  This is a Marriott created hotel (NOT part of the City Center / MGM Group), it's got the Planet Hollywood hip feel to it, but man... the design was just to...CRAMMED!  They try to squeeze so much decor into this place that they made it feel so small!  Anyway, there is your sneak peak into COSMO... please do read my future reviews on this place... (Or check it out yourself!)

So the highlight of this review of course is the Wicked Spoon Buffet.  Like what I would usually do now once I'm at a location I'll check in on yelp and try to read the reviews prior.  So before deciding to give this place a try I found out that it's a Tapas-Style buffet.  I was like "huh?" but let me tell you... what an awesome concept this place is!!!

So we went for lunch (The dinner the night before was insane with lines snaking throughout the buffet so decided to delay my experience)  No lines at 2:30pm, got in immediately, and off to the food we went...

Let's start with the drinks like how a normal meal would go... we asked for ice tea, coke, lemonade, and water... all were normal except for the water!  It was Aquahealth water (http://www.aquahealth.com/)...Never heard of it but it was some really delicious dispensed water!  (Very much like Voss Water for those of you have tried that before!)

The food was simply crazy!  Everything pretty much was served in small portions but all in miniature cookwares!  (small pots and pans, frying basket, etc.)  So the presentation was 5 stars right there!

Food was decent tasting.... (sweet potato fries in small basket, dungeonese crab claws on porcelain dishes, white truffle risotto in an All-Clad like sauce pan (mini-version!) and many many more!  Unfortunately I can tell you everything I've had simply because there were no names but a description in front of each of the servings (much like an high-end restaurant), but all the food tasted pretty good and you can definitely tell that they focused on the quality and not just quantity.  The only complaint that I would have with this place is properly the warmth of the food served... again, this place was opened 10 days ago so I'm gonna let that go...(thus the -1 star)  I'm sure that once they have everything in place things will be simply awesome!  (But they do have a pretty decent selection of food available all in Tapas-Style servings!)

The mini-dessert island is no joke!  Everything was all attention to detail oriented so it's awesome to see it being displayed!   But their highlights of the dessert island was the following in my personal opinion...

Madelines:  Mini madelines super buttery yet soft!  OMG.... it is one of the best I've had and it's super cute!  Tiny and delicious!!! (great poppers!)

Gelato Bar:  10 flavors to choose from!  Al delicious and not overly sweet!  (Like They Cup in City Center)  Great flavor and just right!  Served in mini cones!

Chocolate Dipped Strawberries:  THE BIGGEST AND SWEETEST Choco-dipped strawberries I've seen in my life!  And it was simply the best period...  Imagine... wait staff on their break getting some food to the back breakroom..... what's on their plate?  Only Choco-dipped Strawberries....  Gotta Get'em All!!!!!  You will not regret trying this for sure!

Finally, the service was awesome!  Our waitress was super nice, attentive, and very accommodating!  Again I can't imagine how they will be once they are finally all in sync with this place say a month from now...  It's gonna be awesome and I'm already looking forward to it!  So kudos to the awesome service training!

One ending high note.... we spoke with one of the managers Jackie (totally funny, awesome, and again, accommodating to the max!)  She mentioned that currently her head chef is driving her nuts!  He is literally creating new dishes on the fly on almost a daily basis (in 10 days of opening they had 7 menu change!)  She said that so many locals came here several days in a roll just to see what's new the next day!  That is simply crazy, I personally don't think they can keep that up, but if they do... I will almost have to rank them higher than my all time favorite Sterling Buffet...

So... let's get the food hot and tasty, and keep the inspirations flowing on a daily basis.... Wicked spoon....I'm hoping that you can be my new number one on my buffet favorites list!  Trust me... that will be some accomplishment!

Wickedly Awesome!

A couple of friends are in town for a convention and they wanted to eat at a top notch buffet. So that means its either the Wynn or the Bellagio. The past few times this situation presented itself, my friends all decided on the Wynn. This time around, this particular group of friends let me decide. "Well, the past few times its been the Wynn, so lets mix it up and try the Bellagio.", I suggested. "I mean how bad can it be?"

We stroll up to the buffet on a Monday at around 7:30 and was pleasantly surprised not to see a line. Now in hindsight, is that a good thing or bad thing? Anyways, my friends bought my dinner so I didn't catch the price. I figure it was close to about $30. The nice hostess leads our party of five to a table that normally seats 4. She pulls an extra chair and puts it at the head of the table. Seriously? I can understand if we had a kid in the party, but we are all adults. Cant we all have our own little space?

"Excuse me miss, can we get another table?"
"Sure, this way please."

So I was expecting they would bring us to a table that seats 6 and have an extra chair open. I guess thats what I get for assuming. She leads us to another table that seats four and pulls up an extra chair. Wow. This must be the five diamond/5 star service I was expecting. I can understand if the place was packed but it seemed like 1/3 of the tables were empty. Whatever. We deal with it and head for the food.

We grab a plate and walk the selections to see what delicious offerings they have. Dish after dish I didnt see anything I was too excited about. Everything just seemed normal. If they blindfolded me and brought me here, I would of guessed we were at a $12.99 buffet somewhere. I think I would of been happier eating at the Planet Hollywood buffet and saving a few bucks for gambling or drinks afterwards.

So for our first round, I start out with crab legs, peeled shrimp, cold smoked salmon, salmon sashimi, and some spicy tuna sashimi. Maybe it was my high expectations, but I didnt enjoy the food as much as I thought I would. The crab legs dipped in the warm butter was fine. Not spectacular. The peeled jumbo shrimp tasted like the ones I bought from the Albertsons seafood counter. Normal. The smoked salmon tasted fine. The salmon sashimi was decent. Now here's my gripe about the 1st plate. Spicy tuna sashimi... I couldnt even get past two bites. It was soooooo spicy. Are they trying to cover up the lack of taste? Seriously?

For the 2nd plate, I chose a slice of shrimp pesto pizza, rare prime rib, duck leg in peanut sauce, calamari salad, and scallop ceviche. I love duck. So the duck leg was yummy. The prime rib was good because I asked for a rare slice and the carving station guy pulled a whole prime rib slab and cut me a piece straight from the middle. It was worth it.  The pizza was ok as well as the calamari salad and scallop ceviche.

So far I enjoyed 3 out of 10 dishes. I take another lap and didnt really see anything else I wanted to eat. So I head for the massive dessert area to fill the void I was feeling. I select the carrot cake, flan, creme brulee, and a chocolate covered brownie. The best one was the carrot cake. Wow. That was very tasty. Possibly the best thing I tasted all night. The flan and creme brulee were delicious as well. the chocolate covered brownie I could have done without.

Here's another thing that bothered me. I ordered some tea. They had a great selection of about 5 or 6 teas. That's a good sign. I ordered some Green Tea and my friend orders some Earl Grey. While we wait for our beverages, she mentions that she should of asked for some lemon and honey for her tea. "Those always come with the tea.", I confidently stated. Boy was I wrong again. I'm not doing well on assumptions tonight. They bring the tea and of course there's NO lemon or honey. Cmon now. Even at a lowly 24 hour cafe/diner they bring you lemon and honey with an order of tea. Seriously.... SERIOUSLY?

Throughout this whole evening, the only thing that kept running through my mind was... How come I didn't choose the Wynn buffet? What else could go wrong? I had one too many drinks so I had to use the little boys room. When I walk in, there were about 5 guys in line waiting to use the urinals. Seriously.... There are two urinals and one regular toilet stall IN A BUFFET? SERIOUSLY? Now I know how the ladies feel.... Waiting.... Waiting....

Would I go back? Not anytime soon. Wynn or Bellagio Buffet? WYNN. Hands down. The food just tastes better there. You can truly taste the quality there. Do you have any pictures Leo? SURE DO! Check them out!

I was torn between 2 or 3 stars. If I could, I would of given them a 2.5.

Yay - I see I'm the first to review the first Arizona franchise of "the leader of the salad revolution." I'd heard of Tossed before (maybe because it was voted "NYC's best salad" by New York Magazine.) Or, maybe because my friend opened a similar concept called Dressed in Atlanta... either way, I'm the kind of girl that loves a big salad for lunch, and I'm psyched to have a place like tossed here in Arizona...

As of today, October 10, Tossed has been open just over a week. So I know I can't be too tough on them... when we went a few days ago, they were still getting used to being open. Even so, it was a positive experience.  The space itself is pretty large for a salad restaurant.  I think it used to be an Arizona Bread Company - I hope it does well at this location as I'd love for it to stay!

I was with my brother; I asked if he'd join me for lunch at tossed since I really wanted to try it.  We walked in and figured out to go to the side that was to order in (as the other side was for catering and take out orders) - it was kind of confusing, but we later learned (from Gazwan Paulus, the Area Developer) that bigger signs are on their way.

Since I'd picked up one of the tossed menus before we went, we both were somewhat familiar with it, but it still took me a few minutes at the register to design my own salad from their huge list of ingredients.  Zack chose from the list of "specialty salads and creative interpretations of familiar favorites" and ordered the Southwest Blackened Chicken Salad.  I finally chose my unique combo of greens, chick peas, chopped tomato, avocado, turkey, and maybe celery.  I also suggested to Zack that we order one of their whole wheat crepes (that are made fresh in the store to create crepe wrap sandwiches) to share.  After we ordered and payed, we were given a # to bring to the table - I do like the fast casual concept.  However, it was not until after we ordered that we were able to actually see all of the ingredients in front of us - I may have chose differently after seeing everything laid out in front of me...

Regardless, it was only a matter of minutes before  our beautiful salads were delivered to us.  Presentation was beautiful, service was friendly, and best of all, our salads were delicious!  I'd taken the suggestion from Tori (the girl who took our order) to taste the Strawberry Balsamic Vinaigrette as my dressing and it was delicious - Thanks again, Tori!  We were both pleased with what we ordered; the crepes were a light, chewy, unique texture that we both really enjoyed as well.  Somehow a bite or two of cheese made it into my salad which isn't the end of the world, but I knew I hadn't ordered it- I'll let it go since they are still so new.

There are a ton of other salads that I look forward to designing at tossed and I cannot wait to go back for more!  You may want to check it out online before you go as the menu can be a bit overwhelming.  Prices range from $6.95 - $10.95 but can get even more expensive if you like to add a ton of ingredients.  I'd plan on spending about $10 per person on average.  Not so bad... oh, and they also soup, smoothies, and sweet treats including freshly baked cookies, brownies, and fruit - there is something for everyone.

As we were leaving, we met the Area Developer I spoke of above and he was really nice... he wanted to make sure we had a good experience and he told us of their plans to build locations of tossed all around the Valley.  I hope they will consider coming to Old Town because that's where I'll be soon!

I saw a lot of mixed reviews on Burger Bar (both for this location and the one in San Francisco), but I was still eager to try it after seeing it featured on Top Chef Masters.

It actually took some time to find it.  Burger Bar is not located in Mandalay Bay but Mandalay Place, which is a little shopping mall adjacent to the casino.  It was late in the morning (just before 11:00am) and the mall was pretty empty.  When Burger Bar opened though, there were quite a few groups waiting to go in.

The atmosphere was kind of like a chain family restaurant without all the kitsch and decorations.  The atmosphere was loud, casual and comfortable, but there was nothing to it.  The dining area was not that big.  Seating was available via tables, booths and the bar.

The focus on the menu, of course, was burgers and fries.  While it was expensive for burgers and fries, it did not feel expensive for Las Vegas.  Many menu items were less than $20 and gourmet burgers do go in the $12-$18 range in L.A.  At Burger Bar, there are a few pricier burgers and burgers can be customized with some fancy ingredients (like lobster) that can lead to some really pricey burgers.

I went with the American Kobe Beef burger.  The burger was about small-to-medium sized.  A lot of burger places like The Counter and Father's Office definitely have bigger burgers.  The bun (which can be customized) was nice.  The tomatoes, green leaf lettuce and onions were fresh, but they were very ordinary.  I got some cheese, which was an extra cost, and some homemade Dijon mustard.  The meat had a good flavor and was juicy (also not too greasy).  It was not anything great, but it was a decent, okay burger.

I ordered some of the fat fries, which the waitress recommended.  Skinny fries and sweet potato fries were also available.  I liked the fries, but they were not as hot as they should have been, which was kind of odd.  Since they just opened the restaurant, I was surprised the fries tasted like they had been sitting around for a while.  I've definitely had my share of food in Vegas that was served cold, but I would think this place would have a higher standard.

The milkshake was expensive but good.  It was a chocolate and Nutella milkshake.  It had a good flavor and consistency.  It could have been a little colder.  It was topped with crunchy hazelnuts, chocolate syrup and chocolate whipped cream.  It was definitely heavy on the chocolate and probably could have used something contrasting to balance the shake out.  While I liked the shake, the portion was a little on the small side.

The waitress was very good--attentive, informed about the menu and friendly.

There is a lot of bad and overpriced food in Vegas because the casinos know they have a captive audience and they let their standards slip.  Burger Bar, while not great, is definitely better than some of the Vegas restaurants I've tried.  It also presents a better value (though maybe slightly overpriced, considering the size of portions, when compared to some burger joints in other major cities).  Still, if you go to one of those cafes in Vegas, you are probably going to spend right around the same amount for a burger.

I probably would not make a special trip to Burger Bar, but if we were around Mandalay Bay again, needed some food and weren't looking to spend too much, Burger Bar would definitely be a place I would give another try.

Final Note: For me, celebrity chef restaurants often feel more like a brand than a representation of the chef's food because the chef is hardly ever there.  Chef Hubert Keller was there that day; he was not in the kitchen though.  He was having a meeting (outside of the restaurant in the mall area).

Let me apologize for not writing during these past few days...  sori!
Here is the reason...  I knew I was going to Vegas, I understand that my next one is my 100th review, therefore, I had to review one of the much better places to make my 100th review shine!  There's no other place better than City of Sin to scout out all the awesome eateries so that is why I've delayed my review for the entire weekend.. again, sori!  I do hope you all understand...

So... 100th one... what should I have...  Buffet of course!  Didn't get the chance to check out Wynn again (it's been a long time), but at least I end up at Rio's famous Carnival World Buffet...  So here it goes...

First of all, the name of the buffet has the word "World" in it... I bet you wouldn't expect it but literally, the selection is as big as this world!  Last time I've been there I remember the food lineup were as long as Walmart on Black Friday!!!  But now... it seems like the line is actually as long as Best Buy on Black Friday!!! (For those who has done the BF thing will understand my reference, good luck by the way if you are going this year!)

Focus Henry Focus!!!  Ok... so... damn!!!  The selection seem to be longer than before... so let me tell you how this great wall of buffet is set up!  

Starting from the left, you got like 8 different styles of pizzas, some condiments for burgers, bunch of seafood delicacies, crab legs & crab claws, deep fried seafood, mash potatoes along with the carving station, roast chicken, Mexican food sections such as taquitos, flautas, quesadilla, mole, carne asada, more mexican condiments, etc., The Bar (for some real fun drinks not ice tea or coke), Fresh Noodle station with pho, egg noodles, soups ranging from egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, etc. fish balls, pork balls, beef balls, more chinese condiments, chinese food such as chow mein, stir fried veggies, some meat dishes, dim sum, sweet bbq pork, roast duck, Italian/seafood, lasagna, meat balls, blackened catfish, broiled salmon, salisbury steak, country fried steak, , corn, pork chops,4 types of hot soups, salad station, fruits, cold salad related sides, wall........  Whew.... I'm terribly sorry for the EXTREMELY LONG RUN ON SENTENCE, but that is the best way to describe this unworldly buffet line!!! It is literally that long!!!  And let me tell you, despite all the descriptions, I probably missed like 30% of the food on that great wall of buffet!!!  It's absolutely ridiculous that they expect anyone to try all of their food here!!!

Ah ha!  That's when I come in!  Agent H on the job!

So I had to get very small portions and was actually able to get one of each samples from the plates on display... OMG was I full!!!  I swear I will never do that again!!!  Rio I hate you for doing this to me!!!  You leave all this deliciousness out there just so you can see me suffer!!! WHY???  (But I thank you for the yummy food!)

So enough with the descriptions.. I know if I continue on this post 5001 character is not enough!  So here's my assessment and evaluation of this monstrosity that they called a buffet line.  

Everything was actually decently made!!!  I pretty much enjoyed every single thing there with the exception to the following...  (you definitely should read this and skip them because I suffered to get you this piece of important info!)

Things to skip:
**Sushi -- hard cold rice, not fresh at all
**Veggies -- waste of stomach space
**Noodle soup -- This is an iffy... I loved the soup but was way too salty, maybe Mr. chef there can add some hot water or something? It's quite salty
**Salmon -- Not sure how but they overcooked it... pretty dry and hard
**Corn Chowder -- nothing special, again takes up space in tummy
**Dim sum -- maybe it wasn't fresh when we got there but looked stale and old... very uninteresting.......
**Fried fish filet -- Dude, these patties are from the supermarket!  (Van De Kamps)  Not tasty at all

Do try everything else!

Now... they still have dessert!!!  AHHHHH!! I can't take this anymore!  All this food and now a dessert island station right by the exit!!! 

Sure I'll take some yummy treats please!

Gelatos! Gelatos! Gelatos!  Tried all of them and here are my favorite and least liked choices...

Dislike:  Coconut---way too sweet
Right in the middle:  Vanilla Yogurt---pretty tasty without that much sugar
Favorite:  Sugarless Chocolate---WOWzers!  Taste like chocolate without the sugar!  Rich, Creamy, and absolutely amazing for being sugarless!  Where you've been all this time???

Other desserts were on my notable list too such as bread pudding (I heart bread puddings with Whiskey sauce), cheesecake cup, and the best dessert would have to be the super eggy flan!  Extremely enjoyable!

So now... can someone wheel me out of this place?  Get me out of here before I say... Yes... I would like to see what else they got... maybe another ice cream?  maybe another cake?  Maybe this is one of Sin City's absolute best?  Just maybe...

I bought a yelp deal ($10 for $20) a few months back for this place not knowing they weren't open yet. Kind of frustrating that they would post the deal and not even be open, but it did say at the bottom of the yelp listing it was "coming soon" so I will take the blame. Their Facebook page said they would be opening the following month, but that never happened. I reached out to Caf Casera by e-mail to see if they had any updates on when they would be opening. The owner responded promptly and said they were working out some last minute things and should be open soon and they would let me know when they opened. The owners word was kept, I received a e-mail letting me know they were opening and ready for customers. It took me a couple weeks after receiving the e-mail to make my way over, but with as long as I waited already what was a couple more weeks? 

Walking in hubby and I were greeted and given menus right away. originally, we planned to eat inside the restaurant, but the fountain machine wasn't set up yet and they only had cans of soda ($1) and bottled water ($1.25) so we decided to order our food to-go and get drinks from a gas station. What a bummer because they had Cherry Coke! I spoke with one of the owners, Julie who said they were waiting for the "Coke man" to come hook it up. I had a wonderful conversation with Julie who also introduced me to her husband and mother-in-law. I could tell while talking to Julie, just how genuinely passionate her and her family are about the food they are serving. She told me how they are there at 5 am each morning making everything from scratch including the corn and flour tortillas that are all personally made by her mother-in-law. 

Some of the menu items here will be something you have seen before at other restaurants, but I promise you Caf Casera puts there own twist on each dish and I personally haven't ever tasted anything like it. I have never heard of "Sizzle" which is the specialty here, so I obviously had to try it! 

Sizzle Tacos ($7.95) - Seasoned ground pork and beef, onions, cabbage and cheese sauce inside 2 crunchy taco shells. The taco shells tasted amazing! They had such a fresh flavor and weren't greasy at all. The stuff inside the shell is an acquired taste for sure. I thought it was alright, but can't say I would order it again. Hubby took a bite and thought it was the best thing out of everything we ordered and he ended up switching me his Bean & Cheese Burrito for it. The burrito was so good! The flour tortillas here aren't your average flour tortilla, they are a bit thicker. The beans and rice were great. The beans are thick and the rice has a nice flavor, nothing dry or mushy about it.

Cheese Quesadilla ($2.25) - The menu says it is grilled with Colby cheese inside, but honestly it tasted more like Velveeta cheese. The cheese was very pasty. The tortilla was kind of burnt on the outside too. After two bites I was done, I just didn't like it. 

Sopaipilla ($2.75) - Yes! This was great. I have had different versions, but not one like this before. They put cinnamon and powdered sugar on it and it can easily be shared. It does have a sweet flavor, so if sweet things aren't your style you can try one plain. I enjoyed the sweet flavor and would order it again. 

As I sat there waiting for my food to be prepared, I noticed the menu boasted that the dishes were prepared with a "New Mexico Flair" so if you want green chile they can add it for 75 cents. It confused me because if the dish is prepared with New Mexico Flair, wouldn't it already have the green stuff in it? Julie was kind enough, because I forgot to order the chile on my tacos, to give me 2 free sides of it. This was awesome green stuff indeed! Hubby was just eating it with a fork, cold and all. I do wish the chile came warm and was already included with the food, since the food is prepared when you order it, a customer could just say they don't want it on there. Oh well they were gooooood!

The inside was very clean and the decor was nice. There are about 4 tables inside if you don't want to take your food to-go. Caf Casera also offers breakfast burritos on their menu. Purchase a yelp deal and give this family run business a try! 

Mon - Sat .... 7 am until 10 pm
Sunday - Closed

"A feast worthy of Gods"

Baccarnal Buffet in Caesar Palace is consider the best buffet in the Las Vegas by most food critics   It rated highest in trip advisor and yelp for a buffet restaurant in Vegas.  I was only going to eat Buffet once in this trip, so I decided must try the best there is available.  My review is based on late breakfast and lunch during a non-holiday weekday.  Finding this place is confusing and take more than five minutes from the main entrance to get here, this is common in most buffet in the strip.  

Admission Price
*Breakfast (Monday - Friday, 7 a.m. - 11 a.m.): $25.99
*Brunch (Saturday - Sunday, 8 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $40.99
* Lunch (Monday - Friday, 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.): $32.99
* Dinner (Daily, 3 p.m. - 10 p.m.): $45.99 on weekdays, $50.99 on weekends 
* Holiday expect to paid $10 more.
* Total Reward Card Holder gets $1 off.
* Price not included the 8.1% sales tax.

Atmosphere
The interior is similar to those of mid-level restaurant, they claim it cost 17 million that might not felt like it perhaps they included all the equipment and kitchen tools in to the cost.  There is a lot of seating, but do not count it those do not mean anything during dinner and weekend which can get full very quick.  The dessert section is separate counter from the rest of the food.

Customer Service
We got assign an individual server, at first she was helpful but quickly kind of forgot our table.  This was not during a weekday lunch so is not busy; there is was still several table empty.  Imagine in dinner or weekend, the service might be worst. The nicest thing is that they did not enforce the 2 hours eating time limit as they normally do in a busy time.   During peak hours, you would need to get an estimated waiting time in a kiosk machine, 

Beverage
You can to choose variety of juice and coffee.  Some yelper was right that the juice they serving were no longer freshly squeezed, but instead are concentrate and probably are pre-made package.  At this price tag, they should had keep the fresh juice instead of during the cheap way.  I was told that the Mexico Section would had fresh juice and Hocharta but never came out.

Breakfast
The item in the breakfast was the best part of the hot food section I think.  The typical American favorite food like Scramble Egg and Fried Chicken are just perfect in term of texture and flavor.  The dim sum was disappoint, it tasted like those cheap takeout place. 

Seafood
At this price they don't had crab leg for lunch, I heard Aria is the only in the strip serve cheaper.  I can settle with no crab leg as long the other item in the seafood make up for it.  However, it failed to impress me at all.  The got the jumbo shrimp cocktail, looks good but tasted plain.  Probably the worst jumbo shrimp I've tasted.  The oyster was small and wasn't much flavor either, lack freshness.  The smock salmon was not that great either, they got three version and all were no good.  Sushi was ok, I like the sushi rice it was authentic one, however the tuna wasn't good.  But salmon was alright.  There was no specialty or hand roll here.

Noodle Section
Skip this one, it was the worst section in the buffet I think.  They use pre-packed noodle, not even the good kind.  I try their Ramen, they use nissin kinds of noodle.  The broth was supposed to be Tonkotsu it tasted more like Shoyu.  There was tiny slice of chashu.  If they wanted to had this type of item, better get it right.  The pho was slight better but still no even close to the real Pho you can from any shop in L.A.

Meat Section
I tried their sausage and beef ribs, it was mediocre at best.  The person that cutting the meat is cool with smile.  There was no lamb chop for lunch, but they do serve prime ribs. The best food in the hot section were the sliders, those were mouthwatering.   I should had get more of those.  I think the burger were prime meat it was extreme flavorful.  Actually, it tasted better than the Gordon Ramsey Hell Burger, which later I eat that night.  The made to order taco wasn't good.  It tasted like king taco and other cheap taco place.

Dessert Section
They dessert has variety of food but nothing really won me over except one item.  Their made to order crepes were the best dessert easily. Fresh and with the right texture, I added the ice cream which was heavenly match.  Their Crme brle was too watery.

Fruit and Salad
They were pretty good in general, Large selection of salads.  You won't get disappoint here.  Just wish they were more fruits.

My 2 Cents
To be honest I am debating giving this 4 or 3 stars, I ended gave a four since there few dish were excellent and the best I had (Sliders, Crepes, Fried Chicken) .  But many other dish were average and even bad..  The price is the problem, they need to better quality and included more crab leg or lamb chop to worth the price.  I didn't get any food sickness after eating here over 2 hours which is a good sigh that the food is prepare it right.

I came to Fogo during Restaurant Week 2013. After trying to make a reservation the first weekend of restaurant week, I was denied because they were already booked. Since this was going to be one of my birthday meals, hubby said to call back and ask for something towards the end of the week so he could take the day off for it. I called back asked about Friday, August 30th (last day of restaurant week) and the woman on the phone said 2 pm was available so I reserved the spot. When we arrived on the 30th the parking lot seemed dead. For a place that was booked the weekend before, why did it seem nobody was here? I soon got my answer on the front door. They stop serving lunch at 2 pm and pick dinner back up at 5 pm. Fogo called as well e-mailed me conforming the reservation, so I was baffled. 

Entering Fogo we were greeted and taken to our table. We sat for a few minutes and then our drink order was taken. I then headed to the salad bar where I was surprised at how some stuff looked very fresh and other stuff looked like it had been sitting there untouched for a while. There was food scattered about along the salad bar and the ranch dressing had a ladle from another dressing inside of it and the ranch ladle was just laying on the counter. I avoided having ranch (my fav) on my salad because there was just too much of a mixture of who knows what inside of it. I went with a few things that looked fresh like tomato, mozzarella, croutons, parmesan and the basil dressing I put on it was delicious. 

I wasn't able to have anymore salad, but will explain about that later. So, the meats started coming. The servers were nice, but I don't know if they understood us or what. I told them what type of meat I would like and they would bring something else. They asked how I liked my filet and I said closer to well-done and I get brought a piece of raw red meat. The meat was seriously hit or miss. Some pieces were either very flavorful and tender while others were too raw or nothing but grizzle. The best thing here isn't the beef, but the sausage and bacon wrapped chicken. They do cook those 2 things right and the bacon wrapped chicken might just be the best I have ever eaten. Included with the meal were sides. The 'Mashed Potatoes" were just average. The "Cheese Bread" was dry and disgusting. The cheese bread tasted like a old biscuit. The "Carmalized Bananas" were actually very good, but the "Crispy Polenta" wasn't for me. I don't know if this experience was due to the time of our reservation or not. I wouldn't have even picked the time if it weren't suggested to me by Fogo. 

Then dessert came. Fogo claims the "Papaya Cream" is their most requested dessert. Most requested by who?? Sure it looks pretty upon presentation, but this dessert had zero flavor. I could have opened a jar of baby food (the dessert was that consistency) and tasted more flavor. Everyone at my table left their dessert unfinished. 

Too bad I didn't try more from the salad bar before we got cut off. The server came to our table and said that the salad bar was going to be closing so the employees could eat. WTH?!?!?!?!?!?!? The RW menu price was $30.13 and included an all you can eat salad bar, endless meats and a dessert. By this time we had only been seated maybe 20 minutes and were the only customers. I felt like we were the ones intruding on the employees eating since it was several of them at the salad bar and sitting at the tables near us. I first must that I think it is a great perk that the employees get to eat a free meal. They work hard and if the food is going to waste anyway then why not let them enjoy it too. I just don't understand why paying customers get cut off so they can have that perk. Dinner didn't start until 5 pm and it wasn't even 2:30 so these employees could have let us enjoy our meal and then stuff their faces. I contacted Fogo about this and got a call back from Whitney, who said they do let the employees eat, but they should have waited until we were finished. Whitney never once said she was sorry on behalf of Fogo and never returned the promised phone call the following day. Just because the small salad I was allowed to eat tasted good and the bacon wrapped chicken was to die for, doesn't mean everything else was acceptable. I would much rather give my money to Texas de Brazil.

I purchased a yelp deal ($12 for $20) a while ago and attempted to eat here close to a month ago, but the power was out so the girl who was inside said she wouldn't be able to serve us since they had no power to cook with. Bummed since I had this place on my radar due to all of the positive yelp reviews and the the food sounded good, I understood and figured we'd just come back another time. Fast forward to a few days ago when hubby and I decided to give this place a try again. This time the power was on yay! Walking in it is confusing because there is no sign saying to seat your self or to wait to be seated. After standing there for a few minutes and seeing no employees I decided we would just seat ourselves. There were already a couple other filled tables, so I figured the employees might have been taking care of their orders in the back and it turns out there was just one girl working the whole floor and one cook in the back. Once she noticed we were there she did check on us often and was very friendly. Inside has mostly purple walls and bright red booths. It's obvious they are going for a Mardi Gras theme, but it could have been done better. Most of the decor has signs on it that say "for sale" since they are closing at this location.

I ordered what was probably the most simple thing on the menu, but it was what sounded good. Priced at $6.95 (regular size) I ordered the "Royal Street" and priced at $2.95 the "Bananas Fosters Rue Royal" for dessert. 

My sandwich came with a side of Cajun Fries and Coleslaw. The coleslaw was crunchy and had just the right amount of dressing tossed in it so it wasn't dry or soggy. The problem with the coleslaw though was it had absolutely no flavor at all and after three bites I put it aside. I was surprised at the side of fries since the menu said it came with a side of "Cajun Chips" and after seeing the pictures on yelp, I was really looking forward to trying them. Now let me get to the fries. The fries were absolutely perfect! The fries were cooked just right and whatever seasoning they put on them tasted really great. I wished I had no coleslaw and all fries. I don't know what the Cajun Chips tasted like, but i'm sure the Cajun Fries I had made up for it. 

The sandwiches come in regular and large sizes. The Royal Street is a grilled cheese with tomato sandwich. If you want your sandwich "dressed" you will get the addition of lettuce, tomatoes, mayo and pickles. Since I ordered a grilled cheese I wondered how that would turn out, but our server said it was one of her favorite sandwiches on the menu and it is really good with the additions, so I went for it. I have to first say that I really did enjoy my sandwich and would totally eat it again. Now let me say that the sandwich just wasn't what the menu described. There was nothing grilled about it. The bread was extremely good. I mean the bread was so soft and tasty and still held the fillings in nicely. I did order a grilled cheese though and the bread had no grill marks and there was nothing crunchy about the bread. The kids menu even mentions that if your kids have a hard time eating crunchy bread to let them know, but a kid would have no problem eating the bread on the sandwich I had. I also kept hearing the microwave going off and the door opening and closing and when hubby asked me how they got the cheese on both pieces of bread melted if they didn't grill it, the whole noise of the microwave came to my mind. I don't know that's what they did, but the sandwich wasn't at all a grilled cheese. 

When I ordered the Bananas Fosters Rue Royal for dessert and I heard our server tell the cook the order, I heard the microwave start up again. I think they were heating up the bananas maybe. This was a decent dessert. I wish there was more bananas it it, but hubby and I both enjoyed sharing it and there was a nice big scoop of ice cream in it that was perfect for sharing. 

I asked our server about the chips/fries switch up and she said that they signed a 6 year lease, but wont be able to stay at the location they are in because the whole building will be coming down with the expansion of the freeway. She said that the owner is unfortunately going through some health problems right now and between that and moving locations (if they can find one she says) some of the menu isn't available right now. If you are craving alligator or Cajun chips you are out of luck. They wont be serving them and some other items until they figure out where and if they are moving. The girl was very nice and like I said I did like my food aside from the coleslaw, but it would have been better for the server to let us and every customer know what is and isn't available on the menu so they aren't disappointed when they get something else on their plate or have to pick something else to eat and look over the menu again. I hope they do find another location and work out the kinks because I'd try them again in the future.
