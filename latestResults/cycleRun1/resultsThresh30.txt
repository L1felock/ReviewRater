Ew, this place is disgusting. We stayed in the fantasy suite building in the "pool suite"-but it would have been more aptly named 'nightmare suite.' Old, dirty, broken... And way overpriced. You couldn't pay me to stay here again.

LOBSTER ICECREAM!!!

is the reason i bookmarked this place. i was excited cuz i was staying at planet hollywood. as i did research, reviews were lukewarm. I tried the lobster icecream and it was ok. I'd rather spend my $ at Earls. if ur a lobster freak, it's worth a looksie as they have many items like lobster grilled cheese, with waffles, lobster rolls- which are $22 for the large ones.

I was in an accident a few months back and USAA referred me to Gerber Collision, they had my car in and out, and painted perfectly. They replaced the rear bumper and passenger fender. The job was great and they patched my tire up for free! They were very nice and professional. They even gave me a ride to Enterprise Car Rental just as an added bonus. I will go to Gerber every time I need body work done. Hands down.

This is probably the easiest trail that you're ever going to hike besides walking around your block. You only go up an additional 400 plus feet in elevation during the hike. I believe the total loop is a little over 4 miles. This is a great hike for beginners and hiking in groups where you can have casual conversations. There are some rocky parts but mostly this is a dirt trail. This hike at a slow walking pace is about a two hour hike. There are some nice vistas so bring your camera.

2pm: Lunch at Paris (the off time will help you avoid their notoriously long line) 

6pm: Dinner 1 at Rio

10pm: Dinner 2 at Planet Hollywood (open late until 11pm on Fri and Sat, if Sun-Thurs, make it a 9:15pm dinner)

Secret pizza is the shit. Sober or drunk, it's worth the wait and the ridiculous conversations and interactions from all the sloppy mcsloppersons standing in line for a slice makes it quite entertaining as well. I liked the pepperoni, but I loved the white pizza with ricotta, mushrooms (?) and pepperoni! Just get a whole pizza for your group instead of ordering individual slices, because they're like the Pringles of the pizza world, once you pop you can't stop.

Hit the spot... but definitely not ranked up there as a favorite.  The eggrolls were somewhat dried out!  The soup didn't have the same taste that I have come to look for in pho broth.  The service was not horrible but definitely wasn't as good as other restaurants, even though they weren't so busy when we went to visit.

They were rather stingy with paper napkins ... and water.

Been there once... and that's okay for me.

Beautiful show; loved the intimate settling.

Reminds me of O show but the stage is a round circular shape; lot smaller & more intimate feeling making you feel like you're closer to the stage. 

Vivid & passionate colors used throughout this show.

Loved the beautiful flowers that bloom at the end of the show.

Highly recommend this show; this is one of the better Cirque Soleil shows in Vegas. =)

FYI, you can buy discounted tickets on day of the show at Tix4Tonight but you have to go in person to buy them; they have plenty of booths & locations within casinos so don't worry.

We are a family of six and moving from a 3200 sq. ft. home is no easy feat.. After interviewing several other moving companies, choosing Creative Moving and Packing was an easy decision. Conrad was professional, knowledgable, and flexible - our closing date changed 3 times and Conrad said, "no problem, we'll make it work".  The employees that packed us up and moved us were friendly and courteous; they helped make one of the most stressful events in life (moving) into a smooth transition for me and my family. I highly recommend this company for any type of move.

Could this store BE any smaller (said in my best Chandler Bing voice)? I seriously walked in with Rickie, stayed 90 seconds, and said "Dude, I gotta git outta here!" Fortunately they had a guitarist/singer on the back patio with a coffee pot full of java and some cookies. How cool is that? Said musician was eventually joined by a little girl who played her clarinet. Played is being kind. Poor thing. That clarinet squeaked more than the brakes on my 95 ghetto beemer. More than Peter Brady's voice during puberty. But how cute it was. How very Bohemian. Rickie scored The Knife CD he's been looking for and the staff was VERY helpful and not all weird slacker don't bother me cuz I'm too cool to move from behind the counter cuz I just know you two queers are looking for Brittney Spears or Madonna crap and that is so lame...NO...not at all. Nicest of nice. And we were cool. Besides. I'd never heard of The Knife. That was always my nickname for OJ. And he WAS not there. Oh. Cuz he's in jail! HA HA! Anyway, I digress. Stinkweeds! Neither stinky. Nor weedy! Check it 08 my yelpitas. Love you!!!!!

Oh snaaap. If you wanna feel like Sharon Stone in 'Casino' circa 1975, then put on that sparkly silver dress and get your ass to the Fireside Lounge. While so many places in Vegas are trying to go old school back to Sinatra in the 50s, Peppermill boldly stays in the 70's...tacky floral uniforms and all.

The restaurant part is okay, but lounge is where it's at. Sitting around the water/fire pit on those cheese plush couches makes you wonder why disco ever ended. ...well, other than the million obvious reasons, but the cheesy throwback amazingness of this place can't be beat.

When my mom picked him up he was covered in paint and what looked to be chemical burns. Along with a 106 degree fever. They didn't contact our family or the vet and refused to help with any bills despite the fact this was because of their negligence.

If I could give 10 stars to Conrad, Robert and the team, they earned them! These guys were the greatest! I moved from Scottsdale to South Florida - a difficult move alone with two puppies. Conrad was creative and flexible, solved every challenge; he called me along the drive out, and every step of the way to my arrival. Robert was my "Guardian Angel" on the trip; He made it Fun! (well, as much fun as you can have moving). I so appreciate all the hard work, the integrity and genuine care that they took to get me to my new home. All the "stuff" made the trip in great sted!

It was a spur of the moment thing and happy that it happened! I met up with Rand H, Norm R & Scott W to try the Reign of Thai buffet on a Sunday afternoon.

Every item in the buffet looked delish and fresh,  I tried a variety of things and enjoyed them all, egg rolls, chicken won tons, pad thai, beef massaman curry, chicken pangang curry just to name a few.   Massaman curry is my favorite curry, and normally I chose chicken but the beef was good too!

Service was friendly and learned from the server that it was her aunt and uncle who cooked all the dishes.

Sundays buffet was 10.99 and it is very much worth the price! If I am ever in the area again you bet I will be back!

This may be the first review that I've awoken from a deep dream of peace to write.  Ok, first I had to make a pit stop, but then it was time to pen my thoughts and aspir... ooooh hoooold on, brb...

Now, where was I.  Here's a fun fact... the human body can hold up to a quarter of its own weight in disposable fluids, whose liberation can be mobilized by Arriba's own spinach enchiladas.  Ole!

That's right, the green leafy vegetable made famous by a marble-mouthed sailor, now compels me to blow my own ballast tanks... again and again

But I have to say, this couldn't have come at a better time, with tomorrow being the inaugurate outing of my office's hiking group.  Magic 8 Ball says "Signs point to yes" that I'll collapse 27 minutes into the trek from dehydration, and possibly require professional extrication.

You know what doesn't require professional extrication?  The cauldron of dysentery brewing in my lower GI.  Spiiiicy!

But to be fair, its not all waterloo, Arriba's.  I really should thank you for lightening my load, even though I've really never felt more bloated and irritated.  *quizzical look*

And if I ever nurture the desire to tarry in your cantina, which is somewhat reminiscent of The Blue Oyster on tango night, I'll be sure not to waste the opportunity, and schedule that pesky colonoscopy for the following morning.  Osmoprep's got nutin on you, honey.

I've been here a couple of times. It's decent cheap food. The owner's like to call it the Italian Chipotle. 

Basically you go thru the line like an assembly line and order your pasta and then the toppings and then pay. I think the angel hair pasta works perfectly for this type of eatery. First timers usually get crazy and load up on the toppings. I just get a meat item and some marinara sauce. They give you a bunch of pasta in your bowl so you won't leave that place hungry.

The house of Petrossian is known world wide for one thing; CAVIAR.  Before you jump down my throat, Petrossian only sells farm raised or sustainable caviar.

Hidden in plain sight off the Bellagio lobby.  Masked as a place to get a quick drink or take high tea while listening to live piano music.  No, no.  Ignore the distractions, stay focused on the prize.

Glassy green gray pearls shimmering with highlights of gold atop a mother of pearl spoon.  Delivery, then; the nutty flavor burst forth, a hint of yolky goodness, a creaminess coats the palate all finishing in a slightly briny oceanic wash.  A sip of chilled vodka to erase the flavor and begin the enjoyment all over again.

The caviar service comes complete with chopped egg whites, yolks, crme fraiche, onions, chives, and blinis but seriously, there is no better way to enjoy this treat than dive-bombing.  Extreme quality and freshness.

Want to learn about caviar and vodka pairings?  Try the three caviars (Royal Ossetra, Royal Transmontanus and Royal Siberian), three vodka tasting (Ciroc, Chopin, Level).  At $105, the tasting is a great way to sample the different flavors.

A dozen vodkas and a good selection of champagne if you must.  Vegas resort pricing.

Note: From Petrossian's website, a description of the flavors and types of caviar offered:  http://www.petrossian.com/caviar-1.html

"Champagne wishes and caviar dreams", maybe but then again consider, there are only three materials suitable for making caviar spoons:  24k gold, mother of pearl, and plastic.  Cheers!

4pm check out time, at no additional cost. In Vegas? Yes, it does exist, and it exists at Trump. It's an excellent buffer after going all night long, because the thought of getting up at 10 or 11 is just plain awful. 

The bathroom is huge and includes a shower large enough to fit a party of four people (if that's your kind of thing) and a bathtub deep enough to store all your winnings. And there's a TV in the mirror in the event you want to bathe in your money and catch some prime time.

The rooms are spacious and though there's no casino to amuse you, it's walking distance from some of the more desirable entertainment locations of the strip.

Your nose will also appreciate the distinct (and pleasant) smells in the lobby and elevator.

HEALTH IS HAPPINESS

  The Peccole Ranch Walking Trail (PRWT) is an unsigned Summerlin trail system in the neighborhood bounded by Hualapai Way to the west, Charleston Boulevard to the north, Fort Apache Avenue to the east, and Sahara Avenue to the south. After experiencing PRWT, I see it as three connected concrete trails winding through a continuous linear park. Trail 1 starts at Hualapai Way to the west which is 0.4 miles north of Sahara Avenue. A tunnel carries it under Grand Canyon Drive. After intersecting with a spur trail, it heads northeast. A second tunnel carries it under Red Hills Drive. Leaving the tunnel it parallels Apple Drive up to it concludes at Trail 2 near Charleston Boulevard. This is the physical fitness trail. Fitness stations with cooresponding descriptive signs adorn the parkscape. They include a vertical ladder, chinning bars, and squat-stretch bench. If health is happiness, this is the trail to happiness. Trail 2 runs south of the commercial and residential development along Charleston Boulevard from Hualapai Way to a couple hundred feet east of the Apple Drive tunnel. Trail 2 weaves through a linear disk golf course. Trail 3 is the spur trail off Trail 1, which continues the due-east direction of PRWT past a surface crossing with Preakness Pass to the easternmost point at Fort Apache Road.

  In late November, I spent a couple of hours enjoying an adventure on PRWT. It reminded me of its sister linear parks in Summerlin: The Pueblo Park and Cottonwood Canyon. However, there were a few characteristics that separated PRWT from its sister linear parks. In comparison, it is a more compressed space bordered by walls instead of larger homes up on hills; with the exception of the trail east of Preakness Pass,  the landscape is golf course green grass; and parking lots are nonexistent. 

  My adventures along PRWT color me impressed. Graffiti is nonexistent. Mature pine trees and colorful trees that left sprinklets of fallen leaves on golf course green grass attracted birds. Birds were everywhere. Many of the adjacent backyards have humingbird feeders. The white concrete trail is a work of art that gently weaved between the bordering walls of the linear park and under picturesque tunnels. Green streetlamps complimented the parkscape. The gentle inclines added texture to the trail. And the fitness stations are a celebration of good health.

  This is an unadvertised trail. Signing and parking lots are nonexistent. My advice is to park at either the Sahara West Library parking lot or Hualapai Commons Shopping Center anchored by Smith's at the southeast corner of Charleston and Hualapai. To reach PRWT from the Sahara West Library, you will walk north on Grand Canyon Drive for 0.4 miles until you reach the overpass. The Hualapai Commons is adjacent to PRWT. Both parking lots are a relatively short distance east of the 215.

  After spending a couple of hours exploring PRWT I felt uplifted and a few pounds lighter than when I came into the trail. I felt healthy! As the sign says on the fitness trail "health is happiness. " And because this is the season of giving, I want to give people happiness by recommending an adventure on the Peccole Ranch Walking Trail.

Hands Down The Most Enjoyable Cirque Experience EVER!!!

If you're a fan of MJ and all his amazing work, this show is a Must See!

From the very start of the show to the very end, the performers had the audience engaged with hands clapping and toes tappin' 
Honestly, even if you have two left feet, you will feel compelled to get up and dance! 
The vibe of the entire show is lighthearted yet thoughtful to MJ's extensive body of work. It embodied the best of MJ and his dedication to music, children and equality.  

I truly enjoyed this show on so many levels and I'm not even a huge MJ fan.

Now, be warned, if you're a Cirque Du Soleil purist looking for the obligatory acrobats this show may not be for you. However, if you love a high energy, creative and unique experience, "One" will not disappoint! 

I guarantee you will leave the show feeling gooooood!

Happy Times!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 37/100

The bf and I paid a visit to the Conservatory & Botanical Garden at Bellagio this past weekend :) It was all decked out for Chinese New Year, with festive decorations everywhere, incense burning, a tree made out of gold coins, and a giant mountain with practically full-sized horses in honor of the Year of the Horse. It was wonderful!

I hear they re-decorate it to match whatever season/holiday is going on at the moment. I would love to see each of the rotations in a calendar year!

The Conservatory is located just past the lobby in the Bellagio hotel - very easy and quick to get to. It has wonderful natural lighting coming in through glass panes in the ceiling, and has beautiful flowers and plants planted everywhere. Great photo op spot as well!

It actually wasn't as big as I remembered it to be when I came here as a child...but nonetheless, definitely something worth seeing during your visit to Bellagio!

There is a garden gift shop nearby where they sell nice souvenirs and trinkets :) There's also a store that sells the beautiful glass flowers hanging from the ceiling in the lobby of the hotel, but I'm sure they cost an arm and a leg just for one!

Just used them to move from Ahwatukee to Central Phoenix and these guys were outstanding! I've moved 5 times in the Phoenix area and each move has had problems. One time the movers didn't bring enough wardrobes. I didn't have any problems with Creative. Jesse and Eric were terrific! They were very fast and professional. I had to store my stuff for a week because my new place wasn't ready and Conrad (the owner) quoted me a fair price. They are the best and deserve all the great reviews. I have no complaints about this moving company and highly recommend them. One thing I appreciated was fact Conrad always answered my emails and was in constant contact with me about the move. It relieves a lot of stress when you have a professional mover. I called a lot of movers but based my decision on Yelp. I always use Yelp to find local businesses.

I vividly remember my first bite of their red velvet cupcake 8 years ago at their Beverly Hills location.  I'd never had cupcake like that before or since.  There have been copycats sneaking their way into Las Vegas over the years with mixed results and never living up to Sprinkles for me.  They finally made it and I am psyched!  

Yeah so 6 cupcakes costs $22.50.  I was surprised when the cashier asked me if those were for here or to go but then I saw a guy with 6 of them at a table by himself.  Damn, dude.

We ordered 3 red velvet, a peanut butter chip, lemon meringue and black & white.  Those other 3 were nice and all but it's all about the red velvet.  The cake was perfectly moist and the frosting is like no other.  Funny how they put the takeout box into a resealable plastic bag...like drugs.  I am sure Sprinkles is well aware of their addictive qualities.

Even the line on Sunday at 11pm was about 15 minutes.  Looking forward to giving the cupcake ATM a whirl when the line is an hour plus.

I always end up at the Cal (where everyone looks like my uncle or auntie) and this time it was for icecream!

I got the yelp favorite Banana Caramel Chocolate Chip on a sugar cone.
Delicious!!!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/egpDg61SdYbKWvCpPM7Nbg?select=-Gj0mB9XAroIS_H4iwS5tA   I had a taste of mango too, which was yummy as well.  

Great place to come after your hawaiian lunch plate from Aloha Specialities right across from it. (2nd floor). You can take the bridge from Main street hotel right to it. 

I hear they have malasadas in the AM! (thanks Elnino!)

I came here to celebrate my nephews 3rd birthday. The park is nestled in a neighborhood of houses. Since the park is dog friendly, I brought my dog, Brownie along for the party. I walked her on a trail that went around the park as well took her over to the large grassy area the park has to interact with the other dogs there. The grassy area isn't fenced in, so I was surprised at how many pet owners had their dogs off leashes, tsk tsk. The bathroom is large and has entry on either side of the building for males and females. They have an area where the kiddos can get wet, but unfortunately the day we were there the wind was blowing and it was cold, so most of the kids played at the playground. The playground is nice even though the swings were roped off for repair and I am a girl who loves to swing so that was a bummer! The park was clean and the area that was reserved for the party was spacious enough with a shade structure and the nearby bathrooms, BBQ grill and trash cans were convenient. They also have a small skate park too, but I didn't make it over to check it out fully. The water fountains were clean and lights came on in the park after a certain hour and lit everything up fine. All in all a decent neighborhood park.

From Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich comes an authentic, contemporary Italian restaurant.  It's good! 

This is not your "we import everything from Italy so we are an Italian restaurant", nor is it "I use my mamma's recipes and she was Italian so this is authentic".  B&B creates classic Italian flavors using what is available seasonally, in the area.  From fresh herbs and produce to house cured salumi, it all goes into creating outstanding authentic food.

Antipasti features a simple but perfect braised tripe alla Romana.  Tender, with no off smell.  Vibrant acidity from the tomatoes add a nice foil to the mildly flavored tripe.  Perfect.  The grilled octopus, heaven.  Toothsome with a charred bitter edge that contrast well with the sweet, spicy, sour limoncello vinaigrette.  The lemony perfume is heady.  Sensory overload on a single plate.

Prima focuses around perfectly cooked, authentic pastas.  The bucatini all'Amatriciana is near Roman perfect.  Fatty, porky goodness of guanchale, bright acidity from pured tomatoes, a zing of acidity from some wine, lightly spiced and finished with pecorino cheese.  If that's too simple, the bone marrow ravioli is to die for.  Rich unctuous goodness surrounded by thin pasta bathed in a veal shank ragu that must have simmered all day.

Secondi proteins are different (lamb, rabbit, quail).  Experiment.  The deep fried sweetbreads, Win.   Crisp on the outside, pillowy on the inside; they pair perfectly with the sweet sour balsamic glazed cippolinis and the sweet bitterness of charred corn.  Don't think about what you're eating and you should be OK.

Massive Italian centric wine list representing DOC / DOCG throughout the country.  Good vintage depth for super Tuscans.  Vegas resort prices.

True Italian service, friendly with great pride taken in what they do.

Dare I say that I like Amore's deep dish pizza even better than the pizza I had in Chicago? No need to hop on a plane to go all the way to Gino's when we have Amore Taste of Chicago here in Vegas. My favorite thing about it... It's hard to narrow it down to only one so here's a few. Their sauce is so flavorful and made from real crushed tomatoes. The ingredients are extremely fresh. Their thick crunchy cornmeal crust is never oily. Every time I have ordered from here, my pizza has been perfectly cooked. 

I love this pizza! I'm just mad that I tried it because now I'm hooked and I'm going to get fat. When I become too out of shape and have to give up modeling because of this guys, I blame Amore! It's all their fault! Don't say I didn't warn you. ;)

Three Birds left and pounds of Steel makes for good target practice! 

The Pittsburgh Steelers have one of the best records in football history. They have won 5 out of 42 Super Bowls. Only 3 teams have won 5 and that is the Steelers, the Cowboys and the SF 49's. Seeing the Steelers are the only one of those three in the playoffs, they could break all records this year, by winning 6 Super Bowls. IF they go to the Super Bowl again this year, it will be their 7TH appearance.

IF, is the biggest word in the English language. If my grandmother had 4 wheels, she would be a box car. 

I was not thrilled when Bill Cowher left the Steelers, but I must say Mike Tomlin has done a fine job and we were blessed, to have had two great coaches. 

I have been an avid collector of autographed sports memorabilia for many, many years. I have quite a lot of autographed Steelers merchandise, including a football jersey signed by the Steel Curtain. 

I can't help but admire that more and more each week and think of how Mean Joe Green and LC Greenwood will be watching the games, with nerves of steel and how Ernie Holmes and Mad Dog Dwight White will be smiling down upon Big Ben, Willie Parker, Hines Ward, Troy Polamalu, Harrison, Holmes and the rest of the team. 

This week the Steelers have home field advantage of a ridiculous time of 6:30 against the Ravens. The Ravens play hard and rough and my fingers are crossed that we beat them for a third time this year. 

Everyone is thinking of how great it would be to have a PA. Super Bowl. I went to Heinz Field for the 2004 Eagles/Steelers game. I drove from Philadelphia along with Eagles Fans galore. We won and it was an awesome ride home. 

GO STEELERS!! You rock my world! Give me one for the other hand!

You would have no idea which show I was referring to if I said I saw it in Las Vegas and it starred a group of fairly attractive women doing dance routines to prerecorded music while topless.  That not only describes "Sydney After Dark", but also current strip shows like "Fantasy", "X Burlesque" and "Crazy Girls".  

Australian accents aside, there is nothing new being offered here.  As I watched the prerequisite cowgirl scene, I wondered how/why THIS had become the formula for Vegas topless shows?  Maybe having a girl that sings makes it classier than a strip club?  There has to be a more creative way to present half naked girls!  Oh!  They have a girl in a leotard doing an aerial scarves act!  That was so cool and original like 10 years ago but a snoozefest today.  A topless comedian would have been much better.    

Keeping with the Aussie theme, they dance to mostly native artists from the "lahnn daahn undah" like AC/DC, Tina Arena, Sia and INXS.  I can only guess their sultry version of "Locomotion" was inspired by Kylie Minogue.  They even did an aboriginal routine which left me feeling cultured and educated.  That's a lie. 

The few people in attendance (15% capacity at best) were all moved up to the best seats so buy the cheapest ones if you're going to pay.  I would recommend "Fantasy" at Luxor over this.  The girls are hotter!

Ladiessssssss....hold tight to those purses!

If you're a woman standing on the dance floor with a purse, you're a target. There's some kind of crime ring happening that can ruin an entire Vegas trip if they get their hands on too many personal items. They appear to be pick pocketing cell phones and if they can wiggle a wallet out while they're at it, game on. A handful of girls in our group noticed their cell phones were missing about an hour into the night and once those of us that still had ours started flashing the ground to see if we could find them, ladies dancing around us jumped in announcing that their cell phones had been swiped, too.

Sadly Hakkasan's security guys couldn't do anything about it, because their job is to keep the fire lanes clear and keep bottle service VIPs away from the commoners. It's a shame because if they had just put a few more security guards on the dance floor after the many complaints we sent their way about the situation, some people could have been safe from the thievery.

Losing your phone or ID on a Vegas weekend is probably one of the worst scenarios you can think of because your whole life is put on hold and you have to jump through hoops (while on vacation) to get everything back in order.

Props to securing kick ass DJs and the unlimited confetti budget, but there's a serious issue taking place under Hakkasan's roof that needs to be addressed. And fast.

Forget about those other foot massage places that "waste" your 1 hour treatment time by soaking your feet for half an hour. This no frills, straight to business foot massage business is the real deal!  No "happy endings" here, unless it refers to satisfied customers with their full body therapeutic massages.

I actually dropped in on a whim, as I was feeling very uncomfortable with severe neck and shoulder cramps. I did the quick Yelp search to see which massage places are still opened and picked one of the closest ones.  I parked at the massage place next door by accident, but am very glad I walked the last few feet to Good Season's Foot Spa () for their "ancient professional reflexology".

My therapist was Tom, and I learned that he has been doing this in California for 12 years. He was definitely an old pro at helping customers feel better with his expert hands.  If all you are expecting is a good foot massage, Tom will probably be overkill. If you walked in with sore shoulders and back, Tom is the one you should seek out.

I am so satisfied with my first experience that I made an appointment to go back in 12 hours.  Now if that is not a ringing endorsement, I don't know what else would qualified.

Note: $15/hour grand opening special applies before midnight, after that it is $20/hour. Visa and MasterCard accepted, but American Express is not recognized ($1 per swipe surcharge).

Not absolutely sure if this is the first business of this business model to open in the 702, but I am absolutely sure that it is the newest and only business of this kind currently in operation.

Cafe Teaze is what I would considered a hybrid business model combining a boba tea shop and a Vietnamese coffee shop (just Google or Bing it if you want to know more).  Specifically, the menu is what you would normally find at a boba tea house in California and the waitstaff are all bikini or lingerie clad women. The best part for me and I am sure for the target market is that these waitstaff are friendly and beautiful, and could easily transition from serving you boba milk tea to fitting right in at import model photo shoots.

What can you order here?  11 types of milk teas (from the simple milk tea to Ma-Cha Ice Cream Milk Green Tea with or without boba), 5 different iced flavor teas (Lychee Green Tea and Passion Fruit Black Tea are what look the most appealing to me right off the bat), 6 varieties of Flavored Snow Ice, 5 hot milk tea options and 9 snacks (popcorn chicken, fried wontons, and spiral potato just to rattle off a few).

Let's be frank here, even if your name is not Frank or Francis Underwood, I am here first and foremost for the eye candy, without getting hassle for doing the looking. That reality is what the proprietor is relying on in attracting new customers. However, the beverage and food are what the owners are banking on for lots and lots of repeat business after the novelty wears off a bit.

For me hopefully the novelty will never wear off :)

Caribbean, mon!
Some water in the desert.
Get the chili dog!

Dillon's is a chain down in Arizona.  BBQ is their specialty.  Kind of like the Famous Dave's of the Southwest.  Have been to the Glendale location in the past.  Solid.  This place brings it to another level.  Situated on Lake Pleasant, just outside of old timers land in NW Phoenix burbs. 

They have a vernicular to get you down to the Lake? How cool is that? I am sure that I will appreciate that in my later ages when I retire down there in my golden years.  Look at the old guy getting busy!:

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dillons-morristown?select=wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqA#wkEu8lVCFfLLd9oek0jHqA

Anyways, their chili dog is out of this world.  See my picture.  Comes on a hamburger bun with two sliced dogs, topped with cheese and jalapenos and BBQ pulled pork.  Just died and went to heaven.  Gives the Gopher Bar a run for its money. 4.99999!

Are you kidding me?  Seriously.

If you like less than mediocre food while porn is being thrown in your face, you'll find it here.  Seriously.

We never would have gone in here if we had any idea.  Seriously.

Corporate Suits in town wanted to take a few folks from my office to lunch and chose this place.  There's an hour of my life I'll never get back.  Seriously.

This place makes Hooters look very upscale and classy.  Seriously.  

And the food.  Huge burgers and fries are the only choices.  The burgers?  Think Encore Frozen Salisbury Steaks on a bun.  Seriously.

We left with the unanimous agreement that none of us would ever see the inside of this place again.  

Seriously.

Just moved into the area and went to this location. It was so busy but staff was very helpful as I'm not used to this store and couldn't find the things I usually get. One time I went to another store and there was a demo of waffles with pomegranate seeds and yoghurt on it.  At this store there was a  sample with Belgian waffles, strawberries, and whipped cream...delicious!  So I bought the waffles and they were so cheap! I also love their Mediterranean feast meal. They have so many different items and prices are very reasonable. I find that I go to Trader Joe's a lot because of the variety of products and the atmosphere. I highly recommend Trader Joe's.

If I could give Green Acre Dog Boarding no stars...I would.  Stay away from this dog boarding facility.  It appears that Yelp has been removing ALL of the negative reviews that this place has had, and I this facility is STILL taking in animals despite what happened two weeks ago (and Yelp saying they are closed).  Four of my five dogs died while under the care of this boarding facility.  I was "promised" that no more than ten dogs would be cared for at a time.  When we dropped our dogs off, there was only two "larger" dogs and about four small dogs at their house.  My dogs ran around the yard, and seemed to be OK.  We were going out of town for two funerals, and our five dogs (English Bulldog puppy, Manchester Terrier, Pit Bull, Great Dane, and rescue dog) were to stay at their facility for about ten days.  I received a call very late at night that four of our dogs had ran away and died from heat exhaustion (one of which being a six month old puppy and one being a 12 year old blind/deaf dog).  I later found out that my four "furry children" were only four of the twenty-some dogs that died under their care, and i was lied to...they did not run away; they were neglected.  I had NO CLUE the owners were going to be out of town, or I would have had ANYONE I could think of go pick them up.  On top of this tragedy, not once have we received any type of apology for our loss from the owners.  They met my family upon drop off, and knew we had two small children we would have to explain this to...no remorse...no apology.  Please don't take any animal here.  They shouldn't be allowed to care for animals.

I visited Al-Hana for the first time today for an Unofficial Yelp Event with Rand H., Robyn N., Mike C., Jackie C. and the other Jon H. I enjoyed some great Hummus and Pita Bread plus my main course of Lamb Kafta for $8.99 and a can of soda for $.099; this meal set me back $10.75 today.

Prior to arriving, I perused some reviews and the menu. Pro Tip - this place is not located in the ghetto as some reviewers have mentioned. I did not have to use any of my martial arts training to get into and out of the restaurant. There was decent parking at about 11:10 when I got there. 

As I'm writing this review 4 hours later, I can tell you that I'm still stuffed. I really enjoyed my food along with conversations with my awesome lunch companions. Thanks to Rand for "inviting" me. I probably would have not tried this place otherwise.

Bryan's Black Mountain Barbeque is definitely at the top of the Barbeque Mountain in the Phoenix metro area. They have plenty of seating both inside and outside the restaurant.

This place is busy and for good reason. You line up and give your order and pay. They also have many different types of sodas, tea and lemonade housed in a giant dispenser where you program what you want via touch screen. They call out your name when your order is ready. 

I really like the brisket and have enjoyed the ribs as well. They have a station where the heated BBQ Sauce is dispensed from a dispenser similar to how you get your ketchup. They season their fries with a lot of salt/spices so ask for plain fries if you're not into the salty/spicy fries. Their beans are also mighty tasty if you decide to go in that direction.

I just wish this place was a lot closer to my house because I love climbing that BBQ Mountain.

Green has the best vegan food in Phoenix. Weather or not if you are vegan, there is something there for you. Very artsy inside, fantastic staff, amazing "soynamis" AKA a vegan DQ Blizzard. They have a small grocery area in the front as well, all vegan but all amazing. I always get their special without even looking and have never been let down. The spicy Po Boy, and the Mexicali Burger are my fav off the menu, you also get a side and I never stray from the delicious curry pasta salad. On top of it all, they are very fair priced, 2 meals, 2 drinks, and 2 deserts, usually runs about $20. That's great for in house made healthy food.

The Mecca.  The holiest of all things burger.  It's a west coast operation, so I only get the chance to In-N-Out once every few years (insert joke here).  But it never disappoints!

The menu is as simple as it gets - burger, cheeseburger, fries, drinks.  But don't let that fool you, there's nothing simple about it.  I'm guessing the most popular menu item is the Double-Double...two patties with two slices of cheese.  From there you can go off menu and order any kind of burger you want.  The first number is patties, the second is cheese slices.  Haven't had the chance to try a 4x4 yet, but that will be happening in the next few months.  Beyond that, you can also dabble in the secret menu and get your burger protein style (wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun), or animal style (includes grilled onions and animal sauce).  It's impossible to go wrong.

French fries can also be ordered animal style, but the plain version is just as good.  One of each is even better.  And as far as milkshakes, you have to go with Neapolitan...a combo of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.

It's that simple, yet that perfect.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 40/100

Quite a pleasure to see while visiting Vegas! There is a huge lake in front of the Bellagio hotel, which is where the water fountain show takes place every 15-30 minutes. My boyfriend and I recently watched it this past weekend and it was wonderful! The particular show we watched was played along to the song, "All That Jazz." 

As much as I loved watching these fountains, I still think that I wasn't as impressed as I could have been. I've watched World Of Color at California Adventure in Anaheim, CA, and I think that World Of Color is MUCH more impressive than the Fountains of Bellagio. Don't get me wrong, the Bellagio fountains are great and definitely the landmark on the strip, BUT they aren't the best I've ever seen.

Did not know you could Zipline in Vegas!!! 

Buddy Ken C told me that you can zipline down Freemont Street for about 20 bucks. This definitely peaked my interest, but when the time came, i didn't feel like it- maybe it was the fear of getting stuck in the middle of the zipline and having to wait for someone to come fetch me, while i hang over hundreds of people (which did happen to a girl we saw). The wait on a friday night took a very long time, over an hour. But from all the smiling faces i saw ziplining above me while i watched, it looked like a lot of fun. We videotaped our friend coming down - they sell pictures of you ziplining for $20.00. 
If ur lucky, you might get to zipline during the Queen show, where they dim the lights a bit and play "We Will Rock You". You can zipline at the same time with 3 other people, so it would be a cool group activity (you can get group prices). Maybe next time, if i get buzzed enough, i might take the "leap". I'll be sure to take a considerate plastic bag with me.

Scary things to me:
Paris Hilton has a career. 
Sarah Palin. Really. She's like the new Anita Bryant. 
My fathers' overgrown eyebrows. Trim, daddy, trim!
Droves of high schoolers leaving school just as I'm trying to find Barrio Cafe. 

Seriously. Like thousands of them. And I couldn't find the damn restaurant. What was I gonna do? Roll down the window (well, not roll down, seriously, who rolls down windows anymore?) and holler out in my best lispy voice, "Hey, squeeze me fellas, I'm going to a wine tasting at the Barrio Cafe. Y'all know where that is?" Since all teenagers carry guns, yes, that scared me. 

Finally. I found it. And entered. 

Cute. Cozy. Middle of the day, so empty. Great, vibrant art. And a very attentive and friendly staff. Often times at this time of day, restaurants really drop the ball. No ball dropping here.
I had La Paloma margarita which is made with a grapefruit soda. Think Squirt and Patron! And after a couple of these babies I was in el bano squirting out that Patron. Dee lish however. 

I ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar. Enchiladas of the Sea for my non Spanish speaking peeps. You know what? It was good. Not great. And the presentation was somewhat messy. I couldn't find the crab or the scallops (which were the size of the ends of q-tips by the way). They were lost in the sauce and the cheese. But I devoured it as the blue corn tortillas sang to me. My friend had a chickent torta. Big and rustic. Like Janet Reno. She loved it! 

I will most definitely be back. Hopefully I will not have to navigate through the plethora of pubescent people and hopefullyl I will pick that Barrio menu item that will blow my calcentinas off. 

Oh. That's blow my socks off. BTW. Adios for now mi yelpitas!

I stopped in for lunch to check out this new pizza place. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta used to be here. I recognized the girl at the register when I walked in, so I asked her if they just changed the name, but she said that Mark Rich's recipes transferred over when the new owners bought the business in this location. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta still currently operates another location, using the same recipes and ingredients, but has nothing at all to do with Giani's NY Pizza and Pasta.

I ordered the lunch special for $5.95 which was 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The pizza slices were a good size. I didn't care for the pizza though. They might be using the same recipe the previous owner used, but it doesn't mean it comes out the same and it just didn't for me. The pizza was somewhat burnt and had a stale taste to it like maybe it was from the day before. This is a real disappointment for me because I regularly shop in the shopping center Giani's is in and enjoyed stopping for pizza. Good thing "Above the Crust" is just around the corner though on Ann Rd so there still is a solid pizza joint in the neighborhood I can go to.

I've been awaiting a great eatery to replace the now defunct Chandler BBQ Company, and the wait was worth it.

I've had both the meat tortellini with bolognese and the marscapone with butternut squash ravioli, both made from scratch, both delightful.  I have huge expectations for their artichoke parmesan.  The restaurant does have a Facebook page when you can come and get a little extra info.  It's quaint and cute on the inside (seats 16) and they have a nice sized outdoor patio with ample seating, for al fresco dining.

The chef, Carlo, is friendly and excited for you to try his creations.  They have a chalkboard menu behind the counter, where you'll place your order, and a deli case with meats, cheeses and olives... soon to include desserts.

They offer hot and cold sandwiches, salads, pasta (with your choice of six sauces), and a few side dishes.  The beverage options include a fountain station.

Stop by for lunch or dinner.  Stay for the ambiance or get it to-go!

A cool place to check out AT NIGHT for some cheesy fun! The light show is the main attraction : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=o6mHisZZA0tj7RjX7W1ccw.
Came here to check out the ZIPLINING (Freemont Flightlines) and the light show. Tons of people- GREAT people watching. Saw some familiar faces : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=baqnWN8WDv_vdGcYDljwNg. 
My favorite group was this one: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3xmfT7l3xNH5LK1dLzfvGw?select=cvn4V62FYXTCGj7WLVx4tg
I also saw a Justin Bieber look alike here, with his mom heading out near his bedtime. You can check out a live 80's cover band, street performers, cheap eats- my favorite thing here was the time when the neon light show overhead plays "We Will Rock You" from Queen. Forgot to get my deep fried twinkie to complete my experience...

They charge for parking (what?) in the structure, so park at the nearby hotels like the CAL instead.

It was almost impossible to pick which cake i wanted. We settled on triple chocolate cake (so decadent!) topped with a fab macaron. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P3Jnl4QyXymwdnWpzifrmg?select=HfgazxGFRJ6nZO2MXGcNsQ
We also shared a tasty crepe: rich and very indulgent. Loved it! 

One thing i didn't love was when I asked a worker if they sold individual macarons and the guy said yes and pointed me to the coconut macaroons. I was even more annoyed when I saw labels for the rose macaron cake say macaroon. However the prepacked macarons were labeled "French macarons".  Anthony N pointed it out to me that macaroon is the English translation for macaron; but seriously at Jean Philippe I would like to see it labeled Macaron, especially when they ALSO sell macarooooons. It's like a prestigious french restaurant having "fat liver" on their menu instead of foie gras. Luckily my annoyance quickly dissipated when i took a bite of that triple chocolate cake!!!

"Where does my heart beat now?
Where is the sound?
That only echoes through the night."

The French Canadian with pipes like an angel, the gifted Celine Dion.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#Kbvx9GtNiElinZ0HzpQ_Lw

Celine looked absolutely stunning, captivating the Friday night audience with her melodic voice & touching lyrics.  I felt quite a few goosebumps as she sang hits such as-

"But when you touch me like this,
and when you hold me like that.
I just have to admit,
that it's all coming back to me."

Our seats located in the rear orchestra had a great view of the stage, off center left.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#w6Yz3Dx-Wgzi0dRHERURxQ

Celine did several covers of other artists' songs, but I would've preferred if she sang more of her music library.  She even performed 2 hologram duets, one of which was interestingly enough, with herself.  Can't say I didn't get the most Celine Dion for the dollar ;p

"Cause I am your lady,
and you are my man.
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can."

Of course, the song that everyone anticipates, "My Heart Will Go On", lived up to all expectations & mesmerized the fortunate concert goers.  Towards the end of the song, Celine was surrounded by falling water that artistically cascaded down to make a magical experience, both audio & visual.  Think Fountains of Bellagio in reverse.

Can't have a concert w/o merchandise
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/celine-las-vegas-2?select=qKgA_mxajVkBkSBtJRwkdQ#84ZlgUYEgyq-PDy-eNr-YA

A true showstopper & deserving of headlining the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace,  Celine Dion puts on an extravagant show that will pull the heartstrings & touch you to your very soul.  Her powerful voice wil captivate & strike you with awe as to how such strength can come from such a small frame.  A tremendous show that absolutely has to be experienced before her run is done.

Highly recommend!

I think my friends secretly hate me...I'll give the good, the drinks are pretty damn good. Some really nice eye candy.

The bad why is it so sticky??? I'm hoping spilled drinks and not body fluids......I understand college bar but ladies have some class as much as I love the hot outfits seriously pick a person not 8. I did actually buy 2 guys drinks for having the dirtiest pick up lines. I agree on other reviews if your're looking for a STD, maybe roofied this is the club for you. 

Oh the bartenders are awesome make great fun shots

I love this place!  I noticed a lot of people there and wondered if it was worth the trip.  I wasn't disappointed.  On the day I went, I had a vegieburger and it was really good, came with a salad and blue chips. I brought half of it home and had the other half for dinner.  I also ordered a drink that was cherry and chocolate (delicious).  I am a big fan and would go more but it is a little expensive.  Also took a slice of the chocolate pomegranate cake (their signature dish) and it was really outstanding.  I shall return!

You can't say no to these amazing slabs of meat!

I ordered the **Steak Bordelaise** which is topped with caramelized onions and accompanied by frites. The steak is incredibly tender and melts in your mouth! The sweetness from the caramelized onions blended so well with the meaty juiciness. And I couldn't stop popping those frites in my mouth, one after another. They had the perfect texture: thin and crisp yet dense in flavor.

The **Paris Romance** cocktail, elegant and refreshing, is composed of Malibu Rum, Amaretto, a splash of pineapple juice, a dash of Grenadine, grapefruit juice, and some secret magic ingredients. Served in a chilled martini glass, it is the perfect accompaniment to such a fine-tuned meal.

The decor and ambiance reflect classy French charm, without being overbearing in the slightest. For dinner it was dimly lit and offered a warm comforting vibe. Service was flawless, although I have to say we made it pretty easy since we all knew we wanted steak and frites. 

You will definitely get the bang for your buck here. Upscale experience but at way more reasonable prices than many other restaurants in Las Vegas. Use your $$$ for going out later that night or hitting up the tables. :)

DATE TIP: Oui oui!

"Oh, well that's my partner and I'm not sure what it is. I have our address, phone number, our account number..."

"OK Melika. Look honey. I'm trying to GIVE you money. I'm not changing my plan or even making fun of your dumb ass company yet. Just wanna GIVE you money."
"Without your PIN or social security number I cannot tell you the minimum due but I can take a payment."
"Oh. Well now we're getting somewhere. Melika. By the way, we're you named after a coffee maker? Great let's pay $165 like I did last month and see where that gets us."
"Thank you sir for you payment. And, yes, I was named after a coffee maker. Thank you for choosing Cox Communications for all your media and digital needs. Have a nice day."
Two days later. Our cable and internet is turned off. Because she could not tell me my minimum amount and I was short by $4.83. Our services were turned off. And I didn't "choose" Cox. It was forced on me like Catholicism and puberty. Cox? You suck!

When the king of pop decided against "Beautiful Young Thing" for his epic 1982 album, Thriller, that set the wheels in motion for what we know today as BYT.

When this place is packed, and it gets packed, you'll be doing the moonwalk as patrons enter and exit by means of any open crevice between you and the other line-mongers.  Michael was so right... You Are Not Alone, but tough it out, because once you sink those bleached choppaz into your first bite, you'll Wanna Be Startin Somethin.

I can personally vouch for the carne asada, chicked and birria tacos, with the later being my favorite.  My wife and I split a carne, cheese and bean burrito.  My only complaint was the fatty chunks, and the gristle.  I wont ding them too hard, as they were totally slammed.

The biggest disappointment of the night came in a styrofoam cup.  The side of frijoles we ordered had to have been from a can... like a can of Rosarita.  I can see them needing a fallback with as  busy as they were, its possible they could have sold out of the good stuff.  I wont know for sure, until my return visit.  I use Elmer's Tacos or Rancho Market as my bean baseline, so be on your A game guys, because based on The Way You Make Me Feel will determine if I'm going to continue to Rock With You, or not... because I will Remember The Time.

I also polished off an order of chips & salsa, a Mexican coke and a large horchata... so I left pre-diabetic and pretty stuffed... so much that I almost didn't recognize that Man In The Mirror.

I've only been here for lunch but based on some reviews regarding breakfast I may be missing something.

The first time I went in here I was kind of overwhelmed by all the choices. It didn't make it any easier trying to decipher the menu plastered above the grill area, that was kind of awkward. I'm not certain if they have a paper menu.

I struck up a conversation with a regular and he pointed me to the Gyros special. I ordered that and didn't really dig it too much. The next trip I tried the pastrami and was not too impressed. Both meals BTW, were ginormous. Next, I said to myself if this was an IQ Test and you had to choose something from a place that was called the BURGER Factory what should you choose? Burger, dummy. Yes, I tried a burger the next time through and liked it. So I would rate the burgers a 4 and the rest of the stuff a 2 to average out to a 3 star rating for the total body of work.

Also, they take credit cards. So this is not a cash only place.

While I was in Vegas and bored outta my mind, I called my "friend" Chris who moved to Vegas a few years ago so we could "chat".

I was staying at the Cosmo so I told him to meet me at the Vesper Bar so we could have a drink and he could possibly slip me a quaalude *kidding*

People watching here is amazing.  The bar area is pretty much empty most of the time, but there are so many people moving past from the hotel.  All kinds of walks of life, from everywhere.  

The drinks all have interesting names and even more interesting ingredients.  Drinks are average prices, anywhere from 10-15 bucks, but they're worth it.  The bartenders are nice, and easy on the eyes.  

If you happened to see an Asian guy making out with a tall white guy...That was probably me...God I'm such a slut, at least Chris cured my case of boredom.

I really like this place because it has a lot of potential. One of the tweaks I would make is to get a decent honey mustard dipping sauce. Also, I thought calling out people's name in the restaurant with their food order was annoying. I guess I find that annoying because I was trying to get some reading in during the lunch break. I did like their ketchup dispenser. No more worrying about ketchup splattering on your shirt. Next time I'll have to take a picture of it.

This was my first time in a Raising Cane so I decided to order the Caniac which consists of 6 chicken strips plus a bunch of crinkle fries and a soda for about $8 dollars. I thought you get a lot for your money. I enjoyed the chicken strips but they would have tasted much better with the honey mustard sauce.

Carrot Top elicits such a negative knee jerk reaction from so many.  It's like asking people at a pizza joint if they want anchovies.  When was the last time you actually had anchovies??  The guy has been a Vegas headliner since 2005.  There's got to be a reason why he's been able to stick it out on the strip and fill seats in that theater for the long haul while so many headline comedians have come and gone.  One year they're at the Excalibur, then The Plaza and then there's their one way ticket to Laughlin. 

I didn't think I would enjoy the show as much as I did.  He opened the show at a frenetic pace going from prop joke to prop joke.  Didn't think the joke was funny?  No problem!  There's another one in 5 seconds.  It was like watching the biggest 5 year old wise ass with A.D.D. show off his box of toys.  Freakin hilarious!!  The rest of the show was just as great.  You'll definitely laugh a lot and have a fun time unless you don't laugh at cock jokes.  So yeah....eunuchs may be sensitive to Carrot Top. 

We sat in the second to last row.  There's not a bad seat in the house.  You can purchase the cheapest seats without hesitation if you're still skeptical.

They INTERPRETATE the music so well!!! 
(Holla at ABDC season 1 fans!)

It was very difficult keeping the show tickets a secret from my dude- a huge Jabba fan. Bought them about a month in advance, we got 3rd row seats for about $70.00 each. Pricey indeed, but it was so worth it to see them live, so close and their 1.5 hour show was packed to the brim with Jabba-ness. When i could finally reveal the big surprise of the tickets, we were full of giddy smiles the entire time. From the very entertaining preshow until the end, we were fully ENTERTAINED!!!! 
Actually reading some of the things in the negative reviews made me sad and little butt-hurt that they were not ENTERTAINED! These are no skinny lizards- but some of the baddest mofos i've ever seen dance. I didn't give a f*ck if some of the story was a little odd or didn't really make sense to me the whole time. I was just happy to see them recreate some of their ABDC performances as well as a whole slew of new routines. ABDC fans will recognize special guest appearances by SuperCr3W members, which was awesome. I loved the playfulness of the glow in the dark sequence, the oldskool segment and the Single Ladies ofcourse. I especially liked the KB solos and it was fun spotting the individuals behind their masks, like Phil's booty shaking and Rynan's impressive headspins. 

A MUST SEE for TRUE Jabbawockeez fans!!!
Great show for hip hop music/dance fans.
Hit or miss for those unfamiliar.

Get seats in the front or center aisle and you may get picked for audience participation!

Over the last decade, we've had a few problems with our Lexus cars.  And, now for the rest of the story...

About eight years ago I was driving our five year old RX-300 from Seattle to Chicago, so one of our kids could use it at college.  We were outside of Bismarck, ND when all the lights on the dash lit up warning us that the car was about to fail.  The nearest dealership at that time was in St Paul, MN.  Yeah, I know LOL.

So after calling Lexus for advice, off we drove very nervously to MN.  We arrived safely around 5pm and waited nearly three hours for them to look at the car.  It was confirmed that the RX had some sort of unknown oil sludge build-up in the engine and that the engined needed to be replaced!  Replaced? Eesch!

We were asked various questions on where we had our service work done.  After verifing that we had all of our work done at the dealership in WA state, they offered us a Loaner.  Ummm I said, we're driving on to Chicago.  Not to worry, they would flatbed the car to us when it was repaired and to keep the Loaner.  Out of pocket costs?  Nothing!

Now, that story is eight years old and it reminds me of our current experience with our ES.  Seems the NAV & bluetooth link doesn't want to accept the new iPhone.  Yeah, I know, Apple right? LOL. After several attempts by us and the dealer, they are now replacing the entire system. Out of pocket costs?  Nothing!

We have owned other cars and have spent lots of $$$ with replair work, but no one backs up their cars like Lexus.  No one. Peace of mind? Priceless!

Encore Beach Club is G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S. Kaskade Sundays is what's up. Like Wet Republic and Rehab, it's all about scene and be seen - you will be surrounded by beautiful bodies. Unlike Wet and Rehab, you will NOT be afraid to get into the pool! 

Mr. Wynn did an amazing job getting this luxurious beach club built in a matter of months. It's located at the front of Encore - I don't even recall them being under construction when I was there in April. The layout is beautiful with three pools and two levels of cabanas, and rainfall "cages" with a stripper pole in the center if you want to show off your skills. 

Kaskade definitely brings the party on Sundays, but the vibe is definitely more chill than Wet and Rehab (hence the cleaner pools). He's set up right in the middle in front of Surrender (the nightclub) and there's a small area for people to dance. 

We got in for free (doesn't hurt to know the promoters), however cover is $30 for women and $50 for men. You'll easily drop $100+ on drinks, so you might want to consider reserving a lounge chair ($150 drink minimum) or if you can splurge, reserved a day bed or cabana (some with your own personal see-through pool), which will run you thousands. Otherwise you can grab a towel and post up along the edge of the pool.

There are two bar areas, a few tables to gamble and "The Grill" to order food. Share a few salads, which are huge, and the turkey club wrap - the more healthy options on the menu. Food babies are not attractive here.

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 36/100

Beautiful hotel! Probably the nicest one I had visited this weekend, other than THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. It was a vintage, regal and expensive look to it. I have not stayed here, but I was really impressed by my visit this past weekend and would love to return.

LOCATION:
Excellent. Right in the middle of the strip for easy access all over

EXTERIOR:
Beautiful. Especially the beautiful lake in the front which gives it a little bit of distance from the actual street

INTERIOR:
Like I said earlier - regal, fancy, stunning
Entryway has beautiful glass flowers all over the ceiling

SHOPS:
Not too many. Most were very high end stores such as Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Louis Vuitton, etc. More eye candy, but they definitely match the expensiveness of this hotel!

WHAT TO SEE:
Flowers in the entryway
Window shop in the expensive designer stores
Conservatory & botanical gardens (decorated every season!)
Jean Philippe patisserie - home to the "world's largest chocolate fountain"
The famous water fountains out front! Shows either every 15 or 30 min. depending on day/time

I would love to stay at the Bellagio if I could afford it. I think I was expecting the Paris hotel to look more along the lines of Bellagio. Kinda disappointed over there...BUT Bellagio was simply beautiful!

Stone Crabs ... We came to Joe's for the famous Stone Crabs ..., but they didn't have any. Why? Only Joe's knows. We should of left.

Unfortunately, Joe's was already our second choice of the night (after seeing the long line at Bacchanal) and we weren't going in search of a 3rd restaurant. We were hungry, so, let's eat at Joe's.

Luckily, the other food was pretty tasty. We started with some glasses of inexpensive Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon and a Colossal Lump Crab Cake ($17). I liked the big bits of crab that didn't require (or have) much other seasoning (4 stars). 

Equally, the Chilean Sea Bass with Miso Glaze & Bok Choy ($37) and 20 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye Steak ($53) were 4-star entrees. The sea bass was flaky and the miso subtle. Meanwhile, the juicy and tender rib eye was meaty despite not being an elite steak. As a side, we split a creamy Wild Mushroom Mac and Cheese ($11) that excited thanks to the mushrooms and disappointed with lame cheese (3 stars).

Sadly, the service was weak. We suffered long gaps between being seated, ordering, getting food, or service. We wanted to try the acclaimed Key Lime Pie, but chose to try a different place at the Forum Shops at Caesars rather than put up with the poor service.

Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab is famous in Miami for fantastic Stone Crabs and Key Lime Pie. We didn't get to try either. Instead, Joe's became a basic Joe Schmo steak and seafood chain with high prices for the average Joe.

The first time I dined at Chompies I was blown away at how extensive the menu is. I have enjoyed everything that I have ordered. This is my go to place when we get caught between that critical 6pm to 7pm time slot when a lot of restaurants have big waiting times. This is not a knock on Chompies, It just works out that way since their clientele seems to eat earlier in the day.

I've usually order their burgers or the pastrami. My son loves their chicken sandwich. My favorite is the whole pastrami sandwich. It's very tasty and probably the best pastrami I've ever had. It is a mountain of a sandwich. I usually eat half of it and finish the next day for lunch. I order the whole sandwich as opposed to the 1/2 sandwich, soup option since the soup always seems to spill on to the plate when it's being delivered to the table. I don't like soggy sandwiches.

They also serve breakfast items. So if you have that picky eater in your family, this place is definitely an option.

I had my first taste of the Capistrami in Vegas and was so excited they opened a location in Beverly Hills, but after coming to this new location, i am reminded that i still like the set up in Vegas the best. 
It feels alot more family run and friendly here.
Place your order first with the cooks, grab your drinks out the fridge and chips to munch on, and pay at the register. Be generous and give them tip for their Beer Fund! 

I've enjoyed the Bobbie and the Slaw Be Jo, (the philly is too spicy for me), but i still love their Capistrami the best. This time we got a 20 inch of that, and 12 inch roast beef Slaw Be Jo. They have tastykakes here, which i have yet to try and i love their potato chip selection. 

If ur tired of buffet gorging or don't have enough money left to keep splurging, and had enough of Sonics, I def recommend trying their pastrami!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 60/100

Pretty solid shopping mall in Vegas! One of the best ones I visited during my most recent trip. It's huge and actually feels like a real mall as opposed to some of the hotels who have a few shops (less than 20-30) and consist of stores that nobody would ever be interested in actually shopping at.

At the front of the mall, there's a smaller area that consists of several floors with an awesome winding escalator. On the second (or third? I can't remember), it leads further back into a whole other section of the mall...which goes on for forever! So many stores! They range from normal/average, to high end and luxury brands. There are also lots of restaurants and cafes located in the mall.

The one reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because I felt like I was getting kind of confused as to the layout of the mall. It's weird how there's the small-ish entryway area (reminds me of the big mall in San Francisco), and then on one floor it kinda just continues further and farther away from everything else. Also, the mall map directory was kind of confusing and I wasn't sure what direction to walk in.

I would say this mall is comparable to the Venetian's, except slightly different architecture! Both very European.

We used these guys to cater street tacos for our daughter's 1yo birthday party.
If you have an upcoming event and need awesome food and great service at a great price, use Taqueria Guadalajara.  These are legit street tacos.
   Hector was my contact person, and he was very accomodating and professional. We ended up increasing the guest list significantly near the party, and it was no problem. 4 types of meat are included - went with carne asada, chicken, chorizo, and al pastor (pork). All four were good, but the consensus was that the al pastor was the best. 
   David came out to our house and set up about an hour before food was to be served. He started grilling, and set out the vegetable bar, which was huge. There were pickled onions, carrots/jalapeno, some sort of slaw, lettuce, pico de gallo, onions, and green and red salsas. David was extremely courteous, and stayed to serve until the last person was done eating - in 100 degree heat outside. Cleanup was great, you wouldn't even know they were there. 
  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because David did leave a "Tips" box out on the table. My feeling is that at a catered party, it is the host's responsibility to tip for good service. Expecting the guests to tip is a little awkward. Just my opinion, but not a huge deal. 
Would use them again in a heartbeat, as will many of my guests.

I wished Bellagio had an electroshock therapy vendor to administer temporary memory loss.  That way I could forget about every other Cirque show I've seen and "O" would blow my mind like it did the first time I saw it in 2002.  Sign me up and please hand me that rubber thing that stops me from biting my tongue.

The writer and director of the show, Franco Dragone, is freakin brilliant!  How in the world does one conceptualize a show like this and then explain to others how it's all supposed to work without being shoved into a windowless van with a one way trip to the funny farm?  I can only imagine the conversations he had before it got the green light:


Dragone: "So honey, it'll be a stage that will change from a big assed pool with 1.5 million gallons of water and back into a dry stage that can be walked on  throughout the show.  And then there will be a ton of synchronized swimmers and the theatre is going to look like a 14th century opera house.  I was thinking during dinner last night that there should be a guy in the show that will set himself on fire."

Mrs. Dragone: "Yes, dear. (rolls eyes)  Don't forget to mow the lawn tomorrow.  We have company this weekend."    


Later in the day....


Dragone: "Aerialists! Clowns! Contortionists! Trapeze! People on a Russian swing and swimmers everywhere!  Sometimes it will all happen at the same time!  Lots of leotards too!"

Dragone's ex-college roommate: "Yeah, yeah.  Sounds sweet.  Pass the bong already."


Sure, there are detractors that say it's too pretentious and artsy fartsy.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  After all these years, "O" is still inspiring, a welcome escape from reality, and a "can't miss" show in town.

Chocolate is the Chuck Norris of sweets. It is possibly the tastiest substance ever created by mankind. Sure, chocolate can cure hunger, but it can also be paired with any food, stop wars, and, in many cultures, is part of mating rituals. Chocolate is like sweet edible sex.

If you're still reading, you can stop now cause ... ya, I know ... "I had you at chocolate."

No sane person could turn down chocolate if offered. When my wife proposed going to Max Brenner at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace for dessert, she knew from my drool that I was no fool.

We were greeted at our table by a hyper server. Dude was clearly choco-rushin' and bouncin' off the walls. I loved his energy, but never did quite figure out what he was recommending. Does it matter? Chocolate is a synonym for "yum."

The Chocolate Fondue and Choctails were tempting (of course); however, we opted for Max's Fried Dough ($14.25). This sweet icon is one huge thin crispy plate of Fried Dough drizzled with Chocolate Chunks, Toffee, Chocolate Ice Cream, and Milk Chocolate Ganache. The animated server said there was no way the two of us could finish it ... I laughed and dove in with both hands. He knows this is chocolate, right? It's a messy and filling dessert designed for a whole family to share...or not share. (4 stars)

We also split a Chocolate Hazelnut Milkshake ($7.95) with Vanilla Ice Cream, Milk Chocolate Ganache, Chocolate Hazelnut Spread, Milk, and Whipped Cream. The shake was smooth, sweet, & superior. If Vincent in Pulp Fiction was surprised by a $5 milkshake imagine how he'd react to an $8 shake. Who needs vodka? It's got CHOCOLATE. I don't know if it's worth $8, but it's pretty f-in good! (4 stars)

Max Brenner, I don't know who you are, but I do love chocolate. So, yep, I'm a sucker ... and a fan ... cause there are only two kinds of people in this world, those who love chocolate ... and those who love chocolate, but won't admit it.

Just got this message from one of the owners (their review is under Jestin M.) 

this is me one of the owner of Tina's cafe.  you are obviously a poor idiot who is miserable in life.  If you have a nerve, you should've tell your complaint to us instead of crying out on yelp.  We have so many flowers and will continue doing great. Tina will bit the fack out of you if you come and let her know who you are.  ASS HOLE. Go back to your Mexico and eat corn with your whore mother.  by the way, your picture looks like a a guy who is infected with some kinds of disease.   Your women is ugly as you btw (lol)

So after this I personally called and spoke with a manager, they confirmed Jestin works there. Even though I was being cordial with my tone and trying to be helpful in saying that this was my experience, maybe others are experiencing the same thing and that can help fix the problem, they proceeded to say a few things I wont retype here and hung up. 

I responded back and so did they. If you want to read that here is a screen shot of that:

Here is a screen shot of the text I just got from the business phone number:

You know what? I watched the Pound Puppies too. I had dreams of rescuing one of those little Hogan's Heroes clones from their little prison, but in real life that isn't necessarily the best way to go.  Cooler never got parvo.

There is a lot of tramatic backstory to my dog ownership that i will spare you but lets say I have been scarred and it took a lot for me to agree to go here to even look.

Several kennels were full of dog shit...haha yeah dogs live there, no sick looking dogs laying in puddles of runny wrong coloured dog shit, it kennels with healthier looking dogs rolling around in the same sick shit. Yes I am being intentionally vile with my language to make the poit of how vile it was. SHIT!

We saw a dog that we loved. I said no; she said please...then a woman told us this dog was on "the list" yup his last day on god's green earth if he didn't get adopted so we took him. A day or so after we pick him up his little cough is turning into a scary and serious sounding wheez so we take him to the vet, over a thousand dollars later we are told the dog has both pnemonia and parvo...surprise surprise since we picked hi up he had dried SHIT in his fur (keep in mind he was not to be bathed for two weeks because of having just been neutered, yes a freshly operated on dog with dried shit in his fur)
 Oh and puppies don't really recover from that sort of thing so w paid the very nice vet to kill out dog...euthenasia...super....

As she bawls her eyes out I man up to call and let the MCACC know hoping they can take some preventative measures, ya know like not let other dogs roll in the shit that he left. (Parvo is super contagious). They let us know the only action they would take was to make note in our file so that if we went to adopt again they would know we didn't already have a dog in the household...yup...My next dog will be adopted from a much more responsible shelter. I understand low budgets and whatnot but how much does it cost to hose runny shit out of a kennel? GRRR.

LOVE The Barrymore!! What a hidden gem and one of the best meals I have ever had in Vegas! I've been to many upscale restaurants opened by celebrity chefs, but this honestly blows many of them away. Located inside the Royal Resort behind Encore, you'd never expect to find such a fabulous restaurant here. The interior is Mad Men-esque with chic retro decor and a really swanky ambiance.

Food and cocktails were phenomenal and the service was unpretentious and top notch. Everyone was super friendly and we even had the pleasure of meeting their amazing chef de cuisine Francisco Campa.

The seared foie gras was to die for! My friend and I shared one order, but considered ordering another because it was just that delicious. We also enjoyed their decadent lobster mac n cheese, and the fish and duck specials of the night were amazing. Be sure to ask for recommendations and hear about their specials. For cocktails, I really loved the Virginia Hill (Pisco, Lillet Blanc, peach syrup, fresh lemon juice, egg whites, 
peach bitters, sage). You really can't go wrong with anything though.
Book a table here and thank me later!

This is the first (hopefully last) show I've ever attended where the headliner lip-synced the majority of their performance.  I knew going in that would be the case, but it still bugged the crap out of me.  There are a ton of Yelp reviews that mention it.  Almost none of them care and joyously devour her show like it's all you can eat ice cream.
  
Just being in the same (albeit very large) room as Britney Spears, wafting in her aura and celebrity is where their satisfaction is.  She could have been brushing her teeth on stage for all they cared.  My wife argued that I would go see Red Sox designated hitter David "Big Papi" Ortiz if he did a Vegas lip-sync/dance show and it's nothing different than this.  She's right.  I totally would.    

The scene was a sea of ladies dressed in club clothes, packs of gay men that knew the words to every song, Eurotrash, and significant others like myself that questioned whether the metal detectors at the entrance were for Britney's safety or to prevent a person like me from shooting/stabbing myself mid-show if she sang (ummm...performed?) a song like the inadvertent sex change anthem "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman".  The energy in the venue was palpable when you combined all that with the $45 "Work Bitch" caps, the homemade costumes worn, and people pre-gaming big by double fisting their $12 cocktails.

Of course I got a bunch of dudes a row up that refused to sit at any point during the show. Ballads, dance interludes, parts that she wasn't even in; they were all "Fuck it!  We're standing!  It's Britney, bitch!"  That meant we couldn't see anything unless we stood too!  So even when the majority of people were sitting during certain parts, I was still out of my seat which probably made me look like a really big fan of Miss Spears.  Puke.  I actually shelled dough out for this show so I'd be damned if I were to miss a wardrobe malfunction.  

Songs were....stage was...dancers were....screw that!  Go read other reviews for that stuff.   I didn't cross this show off my bucket list, I crossed it off my fuckit list.

"What would you do if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,
And I'll try not to sing out of key."-"With A Little Help From My Friends", Beatles

Beatles LOVE, with seating in the round, so not a bad seat in the house.  It's been showcased on the Strip for a long time now, and still draws the crowds nightly.

We used Tix4Tonight to score some primo seats for cheap.  There's a part of the act where a surpise is brought out to the audience and we happened to be the very last row to participate.  I won't spoil it, but it was fun!

Pre-show, some clowns put on some comic relief by, literally, blowing smoke up people's arses.  Kinda creepy, kinda funny - it was great seeing people's reactions.

The highlights of Beatles LOVE, for me, were the aerialist during "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" & the act featuring "Strawberry Fields Forever".  Very touching.  I didn't care much for the halfpipes and rollerbladers.  Oh, and the music is on blast!  I'm talking loud!  So, just be mindful of that, if you have sensitive hearing.

Overall, a great show worth the money & time while in Vegas!  I highly recommend using Tix4Tonight for purchasing tickets the day before/day of.  Our seats were great & we saved a lot of money.  I'm generally not a Cirque du Soleil fan, but I highly enjoyed this eclectic & colorful show.

My favorite part of Vegas - right here.

Sure it's nice to walk around in the daytime, but it's better in the night. Why? Because that's when everything is completely lit up! Keep those cameras handy when you're walking around here. You can even take some pictures of certain areas of the strip when you're walking on the "overhead" crosswalks. It's not just the lights to enjoy, but also some of the free shows that are available, including Mirage's Volcano and Bellagio's Dancing Water Fountains.

Be mindful of your surroundings when walking around, especially in the night. Sure it's touristy, but as what some other reviewers pointed out, there were some sketchy people hanging around (panhandlers, con artists, etc.). For this reason, I take away one star.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely be back here!

I went here on a Friday after work for some dinner. The parking can be a challenge so have some patience. 

I have had this place bookmarked for several years but I have never really found myself in the area to take advantage of this place. I was trying to decide on a couple of Korean dishes. There was one that was cooked in a skillet with rice and the dish that I finally chose was the Spicy Korean dish with beef and noodles. I'm really not a more spicy the better aficionado. I don't mine a little heat as long as it compliments the meal. I thought the spiciness to this dish was just right. They give you a huge portion and our waiter was always there to refill my water glass because my mouth was en fuego at times.

The cost was under $12 and a good deal for the amount of food received. The service was excellent and my wife really enjoyed this place as well. I will be back!

Horrible Horrible Horrible!!!!!!

For a dedicated customer whose been loyal for over 10 years, I've never been more disappointed in an airline than JetBlue 

Our flight was scheduled to depart at 2:45 pm over the New Years weekend and while we were waiting in line to check in, our flight was suddenly cancelled due to inclement weather.  That's not all. The rescheduled flight wasn't set to leave until three whole days later! Holy moly, i had to get back to work! That being said, they made no attempt to accommodate me or pay for the inconvenience. No hotel, no taxi voucher or nothing. They did offer a refund if I didn't want to take the ridiculous flight that was leaving three days later. I think you can figure out the choice I made. The heavens were looking over me that day and I managed to nab a late flight leaving to LAX 8+ hours later that evening. 

I swore never again to fly JetBlue but when February came around, I had to make reservations for a business trip and because my Amex preferred airline was JetBlue, I just took the leap of faith. I flew out of long beach with no hassle but when it came time to flying back home, trouble was brewing yet again. 
This time, the flight gate was changed last minute without any changes made on the overhead flight monitors. I was chilling in the airport lounge and checking the monitors periodically, and there was no gate change announcement until I arrived at the gate to depart. To add insult to injury, they stated the 5pm flight was delayed until 7pm for maintenance issues. 2 hours later, they dropped the bomb on us and said the flight was cancelled. I scrambled again, just like I did in January to find another flight. Thankfully I found another flight with absolutely no help from JetBlue whatsoever. JetBlue emailed me and offered a 75$ credit towards my next flight. Hmmmmm, would you fly again with them when your flight was cancelled twice in less than 6 weeks? I think not. I tried calling and asking for a refund or reimbursement for all the inconveniences (ie having to find another flight same night, leaving at a much later time than my scheduled flight, no accommodations, driving from Santa Ana airport to long beach to get my car, etc) The rep responded with a resounding "No compensation, only 75$ credit towards another flight" I asked to speak to a supervisor, she again responded with "No"  I'm done with this airline and if you have any common sense, you should avoid them like the plague. Horrible service, no regard or consideration whatsoever for their customers and completely unreliable.

After surviving my first tornado scare in Madison, Wisconsin, my partner in crime, Daniel L. and I ventured out to this well known local BBQ hangout for some good old smoky ribs and all the fixings.

With the Midwest reputation of having some of the finest meats, it was a no brainer to order the 1/3 slab BBQ smoked ribs and pork shoulder sandwich combination dinner ($14.75). The staff mentioned the pork shoulder and the beef brisket were the top sellers besides the ribs.

The pork shoulder was pigilicious! The shredded meat was perfectly seasoned with the rub and then hickory smoked which gave its own taste without the addition of the BBQ sauce. It also impressed me because there were was no sign of grease on the pork. The bun was a standard bread bun compared to the sweet roll which accompanied the dinner combination. We took the recommendation of the staff and ordered the extra meat (additional 5 ounces for $3) since were feeling extra carnivorous! The BBQ pork ribs came with five succulent ribs with the meat just waiting to fall off the bone. Each bite had a generous coating of their famous award winning BBQ sauce. 

Our dinner combination came with two choices of side orders which we picked the baked beans and cole slaw. Both were served in a small styrofoam cups along with the BBQ sauce. It's easy to see why the BBQ sauce won numerous award because of it's rich, sweet and peppery flavor. I'm not a fan of cole slaw but this one exceed my expectations with its creaminess and was extra cold. The baked beans maintained a firm texture and should be ordered with any meal because the sauce was so addictive.

The cabin style interior holds 11 tables and is very close to the Madison airport. The actual BBQ pit is located a few miles away from the restaurant. So grab your dental floss and wet naps and eat some authentic BBQ at Smoky Jon's!

We enjoyed our brunch this Sunday. Arriving right in the middle of the rush, it was a surprisingly short wait. The tables turn over quickly here!

Even though they have tons of other stuff - sandwiches, waffles, salads - there are two pages of crepes on the menu - one of savories and one of sweets. Tough to choose!

After our waiter brought us two swimming pool sized cups of coffee, we chose one sweet crepe (the Apple Streusel) and one savory (the Crispy, which is cheese stuffed). Both took a little bit to be prepared, during which the coffee was refilled. Good coffee, btw. Even though they have lattes and cappuccinos and other 'elite' coffees, you can't go wrong with a cup of Joe here.

Both plates arrived looking excellent as you can see from the pictures. The apple crepe was massive and quite sweet. The "Crispy crepe" was excellent. Tons of cheese and lots of flavor. I think I made out better for having that one. Oh, and the side of potatoes? Heavenly!

Plenty of parking in the parking deck behind the restaurant or on the street if you can find it.

I like Firehouse Subs for their premium tasty sandwiches, they're absolutely outstanding!  

Recently I've found it somewhat harder to swallow their premium prices.

Years ago, the late Clara Peller became famous for her TV commercial "Where's the Beef?", while complaining at a burger place called, "Home of the Big Bun".

While Firehouse isn't that bad, they are close and Which Wich isn't too far behind either for the same reason.  I'm tired of trying to figure out who is giving out 3oz, or 4oz of deli meat on their subs.  

What I truly enjoy is a creative, well made sandwich, that has er, some beef on it, or in Firehouse's case, some meat.  

Quiznos went though bankruptcy, I believe because they forgot that consumers could see them weighing the meat on a scale, and then removing a slice or two when it was too much.

Okay, here's my beef (pun intended).  A group of us came here for lunch and universally found our checks in the $11.00 range.  So that's a sandwich 12" long, meat, chips and a drink.  How much does a 1/4 lb of the most expensive deli meat cost at Fry's or AJ's?

Sadly, we've found it easier just going to Jimmy Johns down on Chandler Boulevard, asking for double meat and paying $9.50 for the same setup.

I give the manager of this location high marks for draining the liquid from the heated pastrami/corn beef NY Steamer after it came out of the oven.  I was in a Firehouse in Florida recently where they forgot to do this and the sandwich just a mushy mess.

In summary, "Yes, I am a Fan" of Firehouse Subs, particularly for all the local Outreach they do for our Bravest. But I only hope they consider taking their thumb off the scale and put some real meat on those sandwiches. 

Enjoy!

WOW. THE ONLY THING THAT IS KEEPING THESE GUYS OPEN IS THEIR LOCATION AND FOOD NETWORK FAME.

Most of their customers are mainly gonna be tourists and first timers. Located in a busy part of the Fremont Street Experience, the name of the restaurant and the words "350 Pounds and Over Eat Free" are definite eye catchers.

The Heart Attack Grill or "HAG" as it's come to be known, has actually lived up to it's namesake with actual heart attack incidents. As a matter of fact, while I am typing this review, I find out the unofficial spokesperson for HAG has died from you guessed it, an apparent heart attack. 
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130212/nv-heart-attack-grill-heart-attack/?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=politics

This place must be bad because I have gone at least 3 paragraphs before even having to mention their food. Ok, quick descriptions. They cook their beef patties and fries with lard. Their milkshakes have actual butter in them. Literally they have a little stick of butter right on top of it sticking out. Now I know the fat is what makes most greasy food taste good but in this case the grease is highly overpowering.

Service is decent. Yeah you got scantily clad female nurses as your servers but this is Vegas. Nothing should surprise you. Well, maybe except for when you see guys getting spanked by them with wooden paddles because it's their birthday. You can actually get spanked if you ask nicely. No special occasion necessary.

Of course everybody's number one complaint is that they take cash only. Of course there is an ATM available but you get charged up the arse just in fees alone. FAIL.

So overall, most people come just for the shock value. Meaning they are shocked when they shouldnt be when they find out there has been several heart attack incidents. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

Hated it.
Yes, it was cheap. Yes, it's centrally located. Yes, it's disgusting.

A couple of friends and I went for a turn around trip to Vegas for the night. We knew we weren't going to spend that much time in the room because we were there to eat and play some tables. Who knew that we weren't going to spend that much time in the room because we didn't want to be in it? Granted, yes- it was off season and we only spent $15 for the room- but I wish I would have spent $15 more to stay at one of the nicer hotels. We were being cheap, and we paid for it.

I knew it was an older hotel, but come on... a little updating (and cleaning) wouldn't hurt, would it? Being on the main strip next to all of these other nicer hotels, you would think they would try to up their amenities a little. At least run a steam cleaner over the effing carpets.

It took forever to find the check-in from the garage. There was a place that looked like a front desk, but wasn't really a front desk? A maintenance person had to tell us where to go. Check-in was fun, too. The lady pulled out a map that looked like something from an Indiana Jones adventure and proceeded to draw our route to the room. We were really confused when we had to exit the hotel to get to our room. WTF. There was a separate section that resembled a Motel 6 from the 70's. That's where our room was.

Upon opening the door, we were greeted by more dilapidated furniture, stale air and heavily stained carpet. Either someone had a crazy orgy in here before us- or there was a homicide. Needless to say- I waited until I got home to shower and I refused to take off my shoes.

Yes, it's cheap. But spring a little more for a nicer room regardless if you're just there to party. I'd hate to wake up face down on that carpet.

Why does everything have to be SO BIG?! Usually we Yelpers don't complain about that (ha!), but in this case it's just ridiculous. Not to mention the potential for inducing heart attacks is immeasurably increased. It must be part of the appeal / gimmick, but too bad larger sizes don't translate to better food quality.

We were here for breakfast at 8 AM after a long night of partying and gambling (we hadn't slept yet) so at this point everything * should * have tasted good, right?

My Grilled Cheese with ham was hearty and a decent size -- thankfully not a monstrosity. The "Hash Browns" were more like a plateful of overcooked potato chunks, most of which were too hard in texture to eat. The "Side of Bacon" turned out to be an overflowing platter of much-too-crunchy, strange looking meat strips.

Service was friendly when we arrived, but seemed more hassled as the room began filling up for breakfast. 

All in all, an okay experience but would only come back for convenience (a.k.a. when staying at the Mirage and cannot make it to a restaurant outside the hotel).

TIP: Size isn't everything.

DATE TIP: Size isn't everything. Wait, what?! I'm talking about the sandwiches!

I went here to see the Coyotes play my home town Chicago Blackhawks. The place was sold out and consisted mostly of Chicagoans. I had no problem high fiving fellow fans after each of the 5 goals that the hawks scored. And of course they won going away that night. I guess it's a sad commentary on society in general when you have to go through a metal detector to go into the stadium. 

I had excellent seats since they were about 10 rows from the glass at the faceoff circle. I was positioned near the Coyotes net to see most of the Hawk's goals. The lines at the concession places weren't too bad but I'm pretty ticked that the dude as we entered our section wanted to see my tickets. I guess he wanted me to juggle my food and drinks in the air while I fished out my tickets from my pocket. He saw my "Are you kidding me look" and explained that they were sold out. I explained to him that I've gone to plenty of sold out games in Chicago without the attitude from the Stadium staff. How can the management expect fans wanting to pay $10 bucks for parking plus $80 plus dollars per ticket and still wanting to endure the hassle of their staff inside? Management might want to think about that for awhile.

Pro tip about going to the game. Don't expect to get any free pizza from their cheerleaders when you're wearing the away team's colors. Getting out of the parking lot was fairly easy as well. Also, thank goodness that cell phone reception is a little inconsistent near the ice so you don't have to listen to people on their phones.

I've always had mixed feelings about the Cheesecake Factory.

I am not much of a cheesecake aficionado, and they have always struck me as an icon of american food excess.  The few times we've eaten in one, we have always left with a bagful of leftovers capable of feeding a third world family for a week.  A slight exaggeration, but not by much I believe.

On the positive side, Cheesecake Factory makes some really interesting and tasty dishes.  I have also found that I have become susceptible to subliminal messages while watching Sheldon and Leonard discuss their BBQ Burger on Big Bang Theory. LOL

So here I was shopping at the Mall and wondering about lunch, when I walked passed Cheesecake Factory and thought of Sheldon and Leonard's discourse.  See link: http://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/series-1-episode-5-the-hamburger-postulate/

So instead of their preferred BBQ Burger, I went with the Classic Burger for $10.50 (see photos). Wow it was huge (maybe a 1/2 lb.) and very, very good. 

A couple months back we were in LVS and had an enjoyable dinner at Gordon Ramsey's "BurGR". This burger is a close second to that carnivorous experience. I'll say it again, wow. 

Cheesecake's Classic Burger is grilled on an open flame and it picks up all that smokey taste from the grill. A nice touch was the sliced grilled red onion which is served on top. 

In summary, an absolutely Four Star Plus experience; and yes I am a Fan. Maybe next time I'll try Sheldon's BBQ Burger. Hmm, I just realized my review feels more like a Chuck Lorre vanity card. LOL

Enjoy!

Oh Ma Gawd! Samantha needs to get her sweet little ass to Talavera. Then she would have her best meal so far. This certainly ranks as one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. From the lobby of the masculine Four Seasons (like Ralph Lauren masculine, not Martina Navratilova masculine) to the bar to our own private dining room, everything was simply outstanding. 

Chef Frank Robertson had prepared a special seven course meal for our party, we just had to select our own entree and the decision was agonizing. I went with lobster served with corn, baby squash and cabbage. Perfection! Preceding my entree we had three amuse bouche; Blue Fin Tuna Poke, Sesame, Avocado ; Heirloom Tomato and Burrata, Basil, Orange Olive Oil, Balsamic and I'll be darned if I don't remember the third.

 Did I mention we had predinner cocktails? Belvedere and freshly squeezed grapefruit juice for me and a round of Absolut LA drinks for most of the others. And the wine. It was pouring like Morton salt. My favorite was a Carneros Pinot Noir. Like drinking liquid velvet! Other foodies raved about the filet, the scallops and the sea bass. Prices for entrees ran from high 20s to mid 40s. Worth every penny. Dessert for us were several plates of sweets...small pieces of various delights from truffles to cakes and pecan bites. I felt like Lucy on the chocolate factory line. Dare I say I stashed a few in my cleavage for the ride home? 

Misc:
Service was five stars all the way. Thanks to all who made our party special.
The long fire "pit" outside is fabulous.
Views of the Valley....uh...maze...ing!
Cloth handtowels in the restrooms. Nice touch. Cotton is afterall the fabric of our lives. 
Chocolate does tend to melt when nestled between your shirt and your chest.

Who would have thought I'd find myself downtown at a rundown casino like Palace Station, but there I was on a late Sunday night enjoying one of the most satisfying dishes sin city had to offer! 

Yup, I'm talkin about the Pan Roast at Oyster Bar! 

Do yourself a huge favor and order the palace version with shrimp chicken andouille sausage and crab. I added lobster too. But either way, It's the bomb, cuz its all about that crazy good sauce! Keep in mind however, to truly enjoy this dish, you've gotta love your spice! Trust, each bite will be a scorching spoonful of fiery goodness! Chunks of meaty sausage, chicken and seafood in every bite and I bet you won't be able to put your spoon down! Well, except to wipe your forehead from the sweat cuz this bad boy is hot hot hot! But oooh soooo hot diggity good! I ordered a level 7 (1-10 being spiciest) and it was just right!

We started with 1/2 a dozen oysters on the half shell, and that was an excellent intro to our fantastic meal! The oysters were fresh and went down the hatch nicely with a swig of cold frosty Kirin! 

We also ordered the shrimp scampi. It came served with loads of succulent tiger shrimp, a heaping serving of fresh chopped garlic and noodles swimming in a pool of buttery glory. Although it was tasty, it simply couldn't hold a candle to the signature pan roast IMO! 

I'm tellin ya, order the pan roast and enjoy! Your taste buds and tummy will thank you for it!

Happy Eats!

I appreciate French food and like it more than I should. 

I also love NOLA and their Laissez les bons temps roulern!

But, the French Grocery is really not a grocery store at all. You cannot buy any grocery items, like you might find in a typical Champion or Carrefour. No Carte Noire coffee, no Maille moutardes, et cetera

They also do not cook, nor serve food here.  Everything is pre-made, wrapped for sale and kept in a refrigeration case. The only exception is the bakery items and a small chilled salad deli case. 

When we arrived on Friday just before five, there were also very few items left in the refrigerator. There was no croissants, no french bread or much of anything in the bakery case except for some small $1.75 cookies.

There were a couple of small individual Quiche Lorraines (which didn't contain any bacon or ham) and a few small baguette sandwiches, like you would find in Gare du Nord. 

The French Bakery also has a wine section, along with a few French press coffee pots. As others have noted, the lighting is poor and makes the store feel dreary. There are a few tables scattered in this cavernous store. But I am unsure what they are used for since you cannot sit and eat any of the chilled items. 

I believe the French Grocery is set up to appeal to working couples on the go --who want something more interesting than the Take Out selection of Fresh & Easy.  Of the six items we ordered, the best was the chocolate Pot de Creme for $3.50. Our total including tax came to $32.11

But if you come to the French Grocery thinking of Le Pain Quotidien, Le Madeleine, or even local Amuse Bouche (Surprise), you might leave disappointed.   Sorry!

We were sooo happy when Sam Fox opened one of his Zinburgers here in Scottsdale Quarter.  Our taste buds leaped for joy.  

We've always enjoyed their Biltmore location. And even though the service here could be better and the location enlarged, the burgers were...  great. 

We returned last evening for our fourth visit. I would plan on a thirty minute wait, but that will allow you to hit some of the nearby stores. The time went by quickly, with a band playing in the promenade.  Nice!

We started off with their yummy fried zucchini sticks ($7.00), adding the Chipotle Mayo dip to the Ranch was a great idea. I decided to try their Kale Caesar ($4.50). It was good, but needed a little more dressing. 

As for our burgers, we ordered the Breakfast ($12.50) open face and their house Zin($10.50).  Mine had an fried egg on top, with applewood bacon,
avocado, cheese, lettuce and mayo; while the Zin had manchego cheese, yummy zinfandel Braised Onions with lettuce and mayo.  Both were delicious.

I believe the secret to Zinburger is how they make their burgers.  Rather compacting the chopped meat and squeezing out all the air pockets. They form them gently. That way the smoky taste permeates the meat.

Expect to pay $20 each plus taxes and gratuities, including soft drinks and one appetizer or small salad each.

Enjoy!

I have never written a review, but I feel compelled to write one for the Marquee. From my experience, the Marquee staff is clearly racist against black people, and therefore regardless of everything else deserve the lowest rating possible.

I got a table with bottle service for my little brother's 21st birthday. Our group had 7 people. When the staff came to escort us to our table, they let the 5 people that were not black in, and then stopped the two black guys and asked them if they are with us. The guys were clearly with our group.

Then we show ID's. The girl checking ID's checks everyone's ID, and then when it gets to one of the black guys, checks the ID for a good 15 minutes, while the rest of us wait, on the other side of the ID check. They bring an extra person to check this clearly valid driver's license from Florida, while they harass us for waiting for our friends to get in to be escorted to our table.

After that we got into the club, and by the end of the night, both of the black guys were kicked out of the club, with an 'X' marked in permanent marker on their wrists so they can't get back in.  While I did not see what happened, I know everyone in that group. They are long time friends of my little brother's and they are some of the coolest, nicest people I know. They are not the kind of people that cause trouble in clubs.

It is inconceivable to me that this was a series of unfortunate mistakes or coincidences. My friends were kicked out for being black and not dressing "white" enough. I expect we would have had less problems if they put on a white button-up shirt, suite and tie and tried to look extra friendly and smile extra big for the racist Marquee staff. I think the Marquee staff saw two black males and assumed they would cause trouble, so they gave them as much trouble as they could and ultimately kicked them out.

This was our experience and we had bottle service. One can only imagine how the staff must treat black males they determine are "too black" that just want to come in and have a good time. I'll never go to this club again.

With suitcases in hand we checked this place out to satisfy my curiosity about Michael Mina. I've heard his name thrown around here and there when the conversation is about restaurants. Why is he famous? Why does have so many restaurants??

NEW ENGLAND CRAB & LOBSTER ROLLS ($17) - 3 pieces of warm bread with crab & lobster goodness on top. Scrumptious!

SEARED FOIE GRAS ($25) - It was perfectly seared and buttery. It also had an apple compote that made it super sweet, super yummy!

FRENCH FRIES ($7) - Perfectly salted and perfectly crunchy.

BEIGNETS ($9) - So warm, so soft, and so sugary! Then I dipped it in the chocolate caramel sauce....ohmanohmanohman, I was in pure ecstasy! The salty caramel ice cream was a delightful bonus to this dish!

CHRIS-TINI ($14) - There was something beyond sweetness, something odd and sour that made me a bit dizzy. I liked it!

SUMMER FLING ($14?) - So good yet so bad...The first sip wormed its way into my brain and made me giddy!

SERVICE - There was 1 to 2 people standing in each corner watching the dining room. At least they were on it when we needed something. But as the restaurant got busier, we saw less and less of our waiter. We had to flag him down when I wanted to order dessert, when we wanted more drinks, and when we were ready to pay. But my tummy was happy so I wasn't upset with the wait. And props to the manager for hiding our suitcases in his office.

After a few appetizers and drinks I kind of understood why Michael Mina is known by a lot of foodies. AHHHH...dining here was a great way to end this Vegas trip! Now I'm curious about the other Michael Mina restaurants!

I used to love coming to Hancock for fabric, but stopped because the selection changed and I couldn't find any fabric that I liked unless I had it special ordered. I stopped in today to check out their fabrics to see if they had any neat holiday patterns or kits and also I needed to pick up some craft glue to finish up some Christmas gifts I'm making. When I walked in there was 2 older woman and they saw me yet didn't greet me or even say hello. After looking around a bit at the fabric and seeing that it all looked dated, I walked up to another lady I noticed and asked her if they sold craft glue and she directed me to it and asked if I needed any help finding anything else. Hancock is smaller than Hobby Lobby or Michael's, so the selection and brands are limited. The craft glue was actually the same price as it would be at the other mentioned stores, but I also could have used a 40 percent off coupon at those other said places, making the craft glue more expensive here if I were to come here to get it each time unless Hancock offered the same coupon that could be used daily and that I could just pull up on my phone like I can at the other places. I did sign up for some sort of rewards card, so if they send deals worthy enough, I'll stop by no problem. The fabric today was on sale 40-50 percent and that's good, but the selection was terrible. The quality of the fabric at Walmart (if you can even find it anymore because they have taken a lot of their fabric isles down) is very poor, so it's nice to have a place like Hancock that has good quality fabric, but it has to be on sale to be worth it and they need more patterns that aren't so dated. I can see stopping by here in a pinch, but will stick to getting my regular crafting supplies at Hobby Lobby and Michael's where the selection and deals are better.

Oh, Bouchon. I love you oh so much. We usually pick one schmancy dinner during a Vegas trip, and since I'm not one for the over-the-top fancy $500 per person dinners, Bouchon suited me just fine.

First of all, I realize you're supposed to order wine with all things Frenchy, but I've gotta say the cocktails at Bouchon are spectacular. Supremely amazing. I had a Bulleit Old Fashioned - and it was one helluva Old Fashioned.

Of course the service is more than superb. And makes you really feel like it's worth every penny that you're spending. 

The food? Ah. Delicious. I never ever get chicken at a restaurant, but something about the chicken on the menu at Bouchon struck my fancy. And I ordered right. That roast chicken was just superb. So amazing perfect. 

Like I said worth every penny. Sure, it's not quite as pricey as some of the places on the strip (at around $80-$100 p/p), but you'll be in store for a fantastic dinner, that's for certain.

"My eyes adored you,
Though I never laid a hand on you,
My eyes adored you.
Like a million miles away from me,
you couldn't see,
How I adored you.
So close, so close and yet so far." - "My Eyes Adored You", Frankie Vallie & the 4 Seasons

I loved "Jersey Boys"!!  The musical retelling of how the group last known as "The 4 Seasons" came to be, starting at the humble beginnings of standing underneath a streetlamp in New Jersey.  I'm a big fan of Franki Valli's music & getting to see how he became the multimillion selling, international hit singer had me hooked from the moment the lights came on.

The actor who portrayed Frankie Valli was dynamite!!!.  He hit those high notes like a champ.  To me, he resembled the Brazilian race car driver, Helio Castroneves.  The supporting cast also did a magnificent job during the show.  We had primo seats, 5 rows from the stage, in Row D.  Looking around, all the seats seem to have a good view, but I must say I loved my vantage point.  

FYI, there is typical "Jersey talk" used during the show, aka profanity, & there is also some gun action/blood.  Therefore, I wouldn't recommend taking the little ones.  There is an 8 minute intermission with a handy countdown timer displayed on the stage, for those wanting to make sure they get back just in time.

I defy anyone not to sing along & have the catchy songs of Frankie Valli & the 4 Seasons in their head for the rest of the night & the day after, as well.  I immensely enjoyed "Jersey Boys" at Paris Las Vegas from beginning to end.

I highly recommend you come & catch a performance of one of the greatest shows on The Strip!

I was reading in my IBD yesterday that Zoe's Kitchen was going public today. So why not write a review.

My first experience with Zoe's Kitchen was a couple of years ago at a CMYE at this location. I thought it was good but unfortunately too far from the house or work. Well, since the office moved nearby, I go here about once a week.

I order the 2 Chicken Kabobs which comes with a Greek Salad, rice and a few very small pitas. I really enjoy this meal even though I think it's a bit too pricey. I saw a couple of dudes enjoying the Steak Kabobs the last time I was in there, so I'll probably order that next time.

Living up to the hype.  A warm and contemporary Italian American eatery that delivers great tastes with the energy that is Vegas.  

This is not an authentic taste of Italian regional specialties rather refined and prettied up versions of Italian American favorites.  All good, it works.

The majority of the menu centers around small plates of antipasti shared family style.  Flavors are very complimentary so ordering a wide variety of dishes works.  An incredible simple grilled broccoli rabe natural bitterness is enhanced by hints of char and smoke but brought to life by a spicy, chili vinaigrette.  Sweet peppers stuffed with a tangy goat cheese and peppery olive oil create a very well balanced dish exploding with freshness.

For seafood antipasti, do not pass on the lobster arancini.  Dressed with a spicy pomodoro of Calabria chili and a touch of a herbaceous basil aioli that elevates the sweetness of the lobster.  Slightly cloying mouth feel but great flavors.  

Great selection of well made salumi.  Try a variety.  The Bresaola and finocchiona as good as any in Tuscany.  Add a selection of cheeses with perfectly paired condiments (Mozzarella with a citrus chili pesto,  Parmigiano with honey).  

Small selection of pastas.  The lobster ravioli excellent.  Perfectly cooked sheets of pasta surrounding chunks of barely cooked through lobster perfumed by tarragon.  Richness on richness but it works.

The only weakness of the restaurant are the mains.  A mustard, walnut, and raisin crusted rack of lamb, while perfectly cooked was one dimensional, needing more herbaceous, lemony gremolata.  A bone in "Tuscan" rib-eye topped with a sunny side up egg did not make sense.   The yolk did nothing to elevate the flavor of the beef rather giving it an unpleasant yolky aftertaste as it cooled.

Service is a work in progress.  Slow and lacking confidence.  This will definitely improve with time.

Decent wine list at Vegas resort prices.

Guys, admit it, Giada turned you on to cooking shows.  Now the chance is here to try the food you know you never cooked.  Worthy.

Best way to relax in Vegas before your flight home! They definitely know how to pamper you here. Two words: Free B&B (Buffet & Booze).

The lunch/dinner buffet offers light, delicious options. The highlight for me were the super tender **Braised Short Ribs** served over slow-cooked creamy polenta. Warm, savory, and juicy! Also delightful were the **Spinach & Ricotta Gnudi**, perfect little dumplings with a dash of tomato and basil. A fresh corn salad, roasted zucchini, and arugula salad were flavorful and healthy side dishes. The **Vanilla Honey Panna Cotta with Summer Berries** gave the meal a smooth finish.

A whole array of cocktails welcomes you at the bar. Just take your pick and go relax. Love this perk!

You can get some work done in the conference area or in one of the more private work booths. Or sit back and watch TV in the lounge area. Or take a sweet nap on the comfy reclining personal couches. We opted for #3 -- nap.

The decor is very mod and clean, while the setting is quiet and relaxing. My only complaint is that at one point, two employees began talking pretty loudly in Spanish. The serene vibe was slightly ruined, but I was already so content on my cozy napping device that I dozed off anyway.

Overall the service was phenomenal. You will want for nothing.

TIP: Open to AmEx members only. One-day passes are $50, or complimentary for Platinum members. Thank you, travel buddy!

Probably the best Pad See Ew I've ever had, but let's start from the beginning...

Immediately upon walking in, I was given... bar none... the most hospitable reception in my short history of dining.  It was comprised of a greeting (including being called by name) and a hug from the cutest little thing, who I had just met.

We started off with a chicken satay app, which was accompanied by a creamy peanut sauce and cucumber salad.  Removing the delicious skewered meat from the wooden spears brought me back to days of yore, when I would covertly poke my little sister in the closest appendage, with the sole purpose of evoking a squeal, all the while under the auspices of my no-nonsense parents.

My go-to Thai dish is Pad See Ew.  I've seen it spelled differently, but I'm hip.  This dish was one to be savored.... no, to be fawned over and then savored.  Using my meticulous chop-stick skills, I pampered each delicate noodle into my quivering mouth... which evoked blissful visions of lazily floating down the Chao Phraya river... and mind you, I've never even been to Thailand.

I'm not saying the dish was laced with opium, but at some point, I do recall fancying a ride atop an Asian Elephant passing through the seven levels of the Candy Cane forest.

My lunch companion, Chris, ordered the basil fried rice, which was more akin to an architectural wonder than an entree.  Using his meticulous spoon skills, I witnessed him moving mountains... of succulent rice and fixins... never to be seen again, for at least eight hours.

And just when I thought our culinary journey was disembarking, the same vision of loveliness appeared to my right, presenting a showpiece comprised of cake, cream and maraschino cherry.

Knowing my chop-sticks would only make a mess of things, I grabbed a spoon.  It had been so long... but it felt good in my hand.  A little cold.  I raised that utensil to the sky, and with an intense bellow, I cried "By the power of GreySkull, I shall have you as my own".  As I started my initial swipe, I noticed Chris had already gotten 2 or 3 bites in during the fanfare.

BAM!  The cake was bursting with coconut gusto, or maybe it was the ice cream.  I'm embarrassed to think of what I probably looked like as I descended into that dessert feeding frenzy.

I'd like to offer apologies to any staff and/or patron within line of sight.  I don't get out much, and unfortunately whenever my taste buds are stirred up like that, its plain and simple mob mentality.  I cant get in their way!  I wont!

After paying the tab, I bid a fond adieu to the huddled kitchen crew, and noticed their horror stricken faces.  The audible syllables "Mujumbo hielan friacah" lilted through the air as I passed... which I believe meant: "Great manly warrior"... no, my bad, wrong dialect... it actually means: "Portly destroyer with awkward shirt cleavage".

I look forward to my return visit, where I will exercise self control... or maybe just exercise

Surreal pool party experience. Vegas does it unlike anywhere else, and Wet Republic is no exception when it comes to getting WET!

So you know what you're getting into:

1) Getting tickets in advance substantially cuts down waiting time.
2) Arriving early (before 1pm) does the same.
3) Cabanas cost $1,500.
4) There are lockers available to stow your stuff.
5) The bar sells drinks in enormous lidded cups. Get these and you won't regret it when the splashing starts! Unless you like chlorine as part of your alcoholic mix.
6) It is calm and beautiful when you arrive early and hardly anyone is there. It gets increasingly more chaotic and cramped up through peak pool time (~3pm).

* * * Now, so you know what you're REALLY getting into: * * *

Be prepared for a poppin' party. And when I say poppin', I mean POPPIN'. Super crowded, off the chain, dope beats, crazy splashing. Beach balls are constantly flying, some that may come your way and bonk you on the head while you are distracted, completely unaware. Good thing they're only beach balls! Then the huge inflated whales start coming out. These are much heavier than the beach balls and have more of an impact on your head. But everyone is too busy dancing and having fun to care. NOTE: You can't ride the whales. You can try, but it's impossible.

By the time the headliner DJ (Steve Aoki) takes over, it becomes so rowdy both outside and inside the pool. Outside the pool, a large crowd is clamoring up by the DJ booth. Aoki sprays the crowd with champagne and even throws a large cake with white frosting at them. He is carried overhead by the crowd. Rafts and inflatable animals (flamingos, ducks, and monkeys) are deployed. It's a hot, hot mess on land!

In the pool there is so much splashing that tidal waves are straight up rolling. One guy was so ecstatic to be in the pool that as he thrashed around, he brought his hand down (with his phone) hard onto my forearm. Thanks for the enormous bruise! Of course I didn't feel it until the next morning, probably because of the booze and adrenaline. Before I know it, 4 hours have passed and the drinks and music are still flowing. Wet Republic sure knows how to make it last!

TIP: Be ready to party. Go hard or go home!

DATE TIP: You can most certainly find a date here. Enormous margaritas + dancing in the water + people in swimsuits? Oh yeah, no doubt.

Friday night and it's 4am.  You've been drinking with your friends since at least 9pm.  It's Scottsdale, so nothing is open and you've exhausted all the fun you can possibly have laughing at drunk idiots gobble down subs at The Philadelphia Sandwich Company (one of my favorite pastimes).  As you drive down Scottsdale Road you see Zorba's and flash back to your senior year of high school, when you and your friends would go into these places and giggle like the innocent little girls you used to be.  I decided it was high time I revisited this Old Town institution. 

Maybe it was the vodka, but I have never felt more comfortable and welcome in a sex shop before.  Usually I get that paranoid feeling that everyone is watching me and keeping tabs on the things that peek my interest.  

I asked the nice young gentleman behind the counter to give my friends and me a tour.  He let me ask stupid questions like:
-"What's your best seller?"  While holding the largest double dildo I have ever seen in my life.  Apparently Zorba's sells a lot of those, just is case you wanted to know.
-"How often do you clean these things and are you the one who has to do it?" In reference to the obvious jack-off rooms.  He kept saying something about no touching being allowed.  He showed me how the little window separating two private rooms will unfog when both rooms are occupied.  So, let that be a warning to you... unless you're into voyeurism I guess.  

He continued to indulge my inane questions so that I could get a good laugh.  Maybe he was bored and got some entertainment out of it too.  Thanks Zorba's for being such a good sport.  I hope you will be entertaining Scottsdale's youth for generations to come.

For 20 something dollars, I could understand some of the 4/5-star reviews detailing brunch. But for $50 at dinner, it fell short.  I'm certain I didn't eat $50 worth of food, my fault for not eating everything!!!  If I tried a bite of everything they had, I would totally pass out from a food coma without really savoring and enjoying (that's why I'm a bad candidate for buffets).  Plus, we had seafood on our brains, wanting everything under sea, especially a variety of crab.  Failed!  All they had were snow crabs. I suppose AYCE lobster is out of the question for $50.  Stop being so unrealistic, Gigi!!!

I did like the shrimp cocktail shot glasses!  Very convenient, tasty and cool spin to a just pile of shrimp as I've seen at other buffets.  Bone marrow was another yummy treat, haven't seen that anywhere else.  I love bone marrow (and clogging my arteries)!! Gelato station was a nice touch.  No white chocolate covered strawberries, only dark chocolate!  Booo!!!  Prime rib was just ok.  Nothing else really caught my attention.  A few other complaints from my table were, not a wide variety and items like bread/pastry were stale and even hard.

Our server was friendly and attentive, I appreciated that.  Didn't appreciate the attitude from a worker at one of the stations. Too long to detail the incident, but I wasn't being out of line.

Will definitely opt for Bacchanal instead next time.

Like ancient Rome, Caesars Palace is old, but still impressive.

Caesars has done a decent job of upgrading rooms, restaurants, and entertainment in an effort to keep up with best of Vegas. Sure, for similar prices you can usually find a 5-star Las Vegas room, but staying at Caesars in the middle of the strip does have benefits.

The hotel has a wide range of rooms to fit just about any budget including classic rooms, tower rooms, fancy "Nobu" rooms, multi-room suites, spa suites, exclusive "Laurel" rooms, and, of course, Forum Tower Emperors Suites for bachelor parties made famous in Hangover. In room amenities vary depending on the class of the accommodations. Don't forget about the mandatory $28 Resort Fee per day when booking your stay, too.

Headliner acts often do short stints at Caesars so if you are a fan of Celine Dion, Jerry Seinfeld, Elton John, Shania Twain, Jeff Dunham, Rod Stewart, or one of the other star acts then purchase tickets online early. Absinthe is an adults-only show five nights a week that blends a cabaret vibe and raunchy humor with acrobatic skills.

Even if you don't stay at Caesars Palace, the dining and shopping options are worth a visit. The Forum Shops is a huge indoor mall of stores and restaurants under a blue sky. It's an experience to see at least once and take in the architecture, statues, and animatronic performance at the large fountain. 

For eating at Caesars, Bacchanal is the current "it" buffet with lines and prices that will make you wonder if "it" is really worth it. There are dozens of other options including chains like The Palm, Spago, Joe's Seafood, Cheesecake Factory, and such. Other name restaurants to consider are Guy Savoy, Nobu, Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, and Gordon Ramsey's Pub.

Obviously, Caesars Palace is much more than a casino. The gaming areas are relatively clean and smoke-free. Slot machines seem everywhere or sit down to play poker or blackjack for awhile.

Self-parking is free in the structure behind Caesars while valet is convenient (except when they are busy). Because Caesars Palace is in the heart of the Las Vegas strip, it is convenient to the Bellagio, Paris, Cosmopolitan, Mirage, Treasure Island, and the Venetian.

Caesars Palace has remained remarkably relevant for over 50 years. Even though it isn't among the elite hotel resorts in Vegas, the "Spartacus meets Rodeo Drive" vibe is well maintained with plenty of attractions, restaurants, and shops to attract visitors and guests.

Finally... a buffet where Quantity = Quality. Of course, it is still a buffet, so, don't come expecting this to be a 5-star dining experience or some romantic dinner for two. The Buffet at Wynn Las Vegas is a 5-star buffet experience ... with buffet being the key word.

We came for dinner and left about 2 1/2 hours later. I'm sure our waitress thought we were pigs. I know we felt like pigs ... and didn't really care because we loved the food so much.

 - Fresh-prepared food like a Pasta counter, Salad station, and custom Crepes 
 - Mounds of Crab Legs and Shrimp
 - Lamb, Prime Rib, & Game Hen
 - Try to get a table in the well-lit courtyard. It's a nicer atmosphere.
 - Gelato, Candied Apples, Profiteroles, and Chocolate-covered Marshmallows
 - Cheeses and Charcuterie
 - Dim Sum dumplings (so-so) and other Asian dishes
 - More, more, and more.

It may sound like every other buffet and while it is, it also isn't. The little things are nicer. The food is better. The buffet is better.

The grilling of food over an open flame is almost 125,000 years old.

And, the Habit Burger story is an interesting one. http://www.habitburger.com/story/  Yet the charbroiling of hamburgers and chicken is a cooking technique that many fast food places have yet to master.  Until now that is. We came here this past Saturday and came away thinking, Wow.

The menu is very familiar.  It will remind many of "In 'n Out" in it's simplicity and style of service.  Their Char-burger is $2.95 and the Double Char is $3.95. I don't know if you can order it animal style, but the burgers are delicious.  Yes, delicious.  It has that smokey char-boiled taste down to where you will want lick your fingers.

Other grilled Habit Burger sandwiches include, Chicken for $5.75, Tri-Tip beef $6.25, as well as Veggie options and Albacore Tuna.  The Sides include French fries, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and a salad range in price from $1.85 to $2.65.  

Besides a side of salad, Habit Burger also has six different Specialty Salads to choose from, ranging from a Garden for $3.95 to a Santa Barbara Chicken Cobb for $6.95.

A couple of burgers, a side of sweet potato fries and a drink ran us $12.68, including tax.  Wow.  Less expensive than "SmashBurger", slightly more than "In 'n Out"; but a lot better tasting.  Nice.

Enjoy!

My family and friends have been getting together for a few years here to grub. That will be happening no longer. The last 3 visits were terrible and the last visit specifically was not good. I'm sad about this because I really loved the food before, but now it's just not consistent. On this last visit we were the only customers in the restaurant yet it still took over an hour to receive our food and the food came out staggered. My niece only wanted Egg Drop Soup and they totally forgot to bring it to her and only did so after asking a 3rd time about it. When she finally got her soup it was like a bowl of gloppy gel. I loved the soup here before, so I have no idea what has happened, but it wasn't even edible. What I loved ordering here most, Strawberry Chicken, tasted awful. One thing that wasn't easy to ignore was the nasty smell inside. It smelled so badly of like sewage or something. Then at the end of the meal we noticed roaches on the floor! OMG I was so ready to leave. Drinks come in cans and refills aren't free. After loving this place for so long it's a major disappointment to see New China Cuisine go so downhill.

Level 107 Lounge is on the 107th floor of the Stratosphere Tower. That's the best thing ... and worst thing ... about Level 107 Lounge. The bar is great because it's near the top of the tallest tower in Las Vegas offering a vast 360 view of the city and dessert ... while it's bad because the Lounge is in the subpar Stratosphere. 

It earns 3-4 stars for a pair of reasons.

** Reason #1: Free
You can ride the elevator up to level 107 without purchasing a ticket to the top. Why pay $$ to go to the observation deck on level 109 when you can go to level 107 for free? The Lounge is close to the center of the tower and you can't get next to the windows, but the view is the same Vegas.

** Reason #2: Happy Hour BOGO
Happy Hour occurs twice per day at Level 107 and serves a limited selection of "signature" cocktails 2-for-1. Early Happy Hour is 4:00 - 7:00 pm and (really) Late Happy Hour is 1:00 - 4:00 am. Each cocktail is $15 and both must be the same. The 10 cocktails available for the special include Lemon Drop, Blue-tini, Cosmic Cucumber, Chocolate Masterpiece, Last Tango, Mango Madness, Summer Mint Margarita, Razz Jito, White Peach Margarita, and Summer Sangria. You can also get some appetizers for half price during the early happy hour.

My wife and I popped in for some happy hour drinks and to catch sunset. It was easy to get to the top and even easier to order. To see the LV Strip, sit on the side with the Bar. We chose $15 Chocolate Masterpieces with Van Gogh Chocolate Vodka, Godiva Chocolate Liqueur, and White Chocolate Liqueur. Round 2 was two $15 White Peach Margaritas with Sauza Silver Tequila, Peach Schnapps, White Peach Puree, and Sweet & Sour Mix. Both drinks were SUPER sweet as you'd expect with names like that. It was happy hour and I was on vacation with my sweetie, so, I guess it was ok to throw back a few sweet cocktails, too.

Note that it didn't seem "required" that drinks were purchased either, so, I guess you could just go to Level 107 Lounge for the view (I think). Self-parking is free at the Stratosphere.

The view from the Observation Deck may be better, but instead of spending $18 for the elevator ride to the top, spend $18 ($15 plus tip) on a couple cocktails while enjoying the view relaxing in the Level 107 Lounge.

Lord knows how many businesses have come and gone at this address over the years like Underworld, Black Label, and Emergency Room etc.  Its transformation into Gyu-Kaku has been nothing short of amazing.  The ultra cool lit entrance begged the question...does Tron eat here?  Being seated while a female sung cover of Savage Garden's "Truly, Madly, Deeply" at 300 BPM's blared through the stereo made me think it possible if he were drunk.  

We considered the course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 for a moment but saw a lot of filler that would have ended up untouched like cheese wontons, chicken cheese fondue, house salad, fried chicken (ok,ok, maybe one piece), calamari and S'mores.  Our initial server, Keiko, recommended we start with the spicy cabbage salad over the kim-chee.  Thankfully, we listened.  Crispy, spicy and dare I say refreshing?  It was a fine way to whet our appetite.        
 
Standing out among with meats was the beef tongue and harami skirt steak.  Quality matched the price and both delivered on what decent yakiniku should be.  We also enjoyed the kalbi short rib and although the Angus beef ribs were a little too fatty for the wife, I happily devoured it.  The mushroom medley cooked in an unbeatable combination of soy sauce and butter was a nice side dish.  

The only letdown was the "Spicy Kalbi Bibimbap".  They got the stone pot right but the rest of it?  It was as if it were made by a northern Swedish resident with no knowledge of Korean cuisine attempting to replicate it through hearsay.  I would have rather ordered the sliced duck breast, an atypical yakiniku offering, or dessert over this pointless filler.  

Despite that, I know I'll be back and stick to grilling.  It's yet another welcome dining choice around Spring Mountain.  3.46729311238987 stars.

ToGo isn't quite the new kid in town, but they are trying hard to make a go of it in the Valley.  

ToGo's origins are NorCal, with a huge following there.  Here, they've met with mixed results so far, closing some locations including one in Scottsdale. 

Their choice of locations have been somewhat puzzling, with no natural customer base like a school or large office park nearby. The other nearby Togo's location (Chandler/Tempe border) is tiny and shoehorned next to a Fry's.  I've driven past it many times not knowing it was there, but this one is much larger. 

My two co-worker and I made a trip here for a late 1:30 lunch one Friday. There was only five or six other here. So it gave us time to chat with the Manager and have him give us a nice introduction and overview to Togo's.

The subs were very good. But the bomb is their Pastrami. It's a killer. Expect to pay $8 including a drink for a small sub, or $10 for the large waist buster. LOL

There's also a frequent diners card and an email club you can join to get online specials. Don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free drink, see photo. 

So the three of us are now Fans and enjoyed our Four Star meal.

It's hard to believe the 5-diamond, all-suite Venetian Hotel rose from the dust of the Sands way back in 1999. The opulent Casino, famous Grand Canal Shoppes, 24-hour Race & Sports Book, and large Suite Hotel Rooms (with sunken living room and Italian-marble baths) are just a few reasons the Venetian still reigns as a spectacular destination for an unforgettable Las Vegas vacation.

Of course, the Venetian is inspired by Venice, Italy (sorry, California). Several detailed replicas of landmarks from Europe's most beautiful city include Piazza San Marco (St. Mark's Square) with Campanile di San Marco (St. Mark's Campanile Bell Tower) and columns for the Lion of Venice and Saint Theodore. Other notable reproductions are Palazzo Ducale (Doge's Palace), Ponte di Rialto (Rialto Bridge), and Ponte dei Sospiri (Bridge of Sighs). 

Here are your best bets for a good time at the Venetian:

Rooms
 * There are more than 4,000 suites at the Venetian
 * Luxury Suites with King bed are standard & 650 sq ft
 * A 700 sq ft Bella Suite has 2 Queens for about $30 more
 * For either, about $40 upgrades to a Suite with a View
 * A Venetian Piazza Suite is 1400 sq. ft and only $150 above Luxury
 * Another $50 can get you a Venetian Prima Suite (1500 sq ft)
 * Rates get high for larger Renaissance & Penthouse Suites
 * An In-Suite Breakfast offer is available, but not my style
 * The Venezia Tower is newer, but may not be for everyone
 * Book online & check discount packages for the best deals
 * Daily resort fee: $25 + tax ($3): Fitness Center, Internet, & 1 coffee

Dining
 * 15 Fine Dining ($$$$) restaurants are tempting
 * Recommend CUT, Bouchon, Delmonico, AquaKnox, or SUSHISAMBA
 * Over 20 casual eateries will fit more budgets
 * Try Public House or B&B Burger & Beer
 * Grand Lux Cafe is open 24 hours
 * The Venetian has several bars to get your drink on

Shows & Activities
 * Tao Beach & Night Club is THE club at Venetian
 * The Race & Sports Book is uniquely open 24/7

 * Panda! features Chinese Acrobats at Palazzo ($68-$158)
 * Lipshtick rotates female stand-up comedians ($75-$120)
 * Human Nature has Australians singing Motown ($74-$118)
 * Get married (if you must) at one of their Wedding locations
 * The DaVinci Exhibit was a waste of $27.50 to see replicas
 * Canyon Ranch SpaClub isn't cheap, but you're on vacation
 * Semi-romantic types can ride a gondola indoors and out

Shopping
 * Grand Canal Shoppes has shops along an indoor canal
 * The stores are open 10am - 11pm (midnight on Fri/Sat)
 * More than 160 stores with mall favorites, boutiques, & high-end
 * Louboutin, Burberry, Ferragamo, & Fendi are highlights
 * Some will like Jimmy Choo, Coach, DvF, or Michael Kors
 * It'Sugar is always sweet
 * Many of the restaurants are located along the Grand Canal

Parking & Location
 * Near the North end of the Vegas Strip by its sister, The Palazzo
 * Across from the Mirage and Treasure Island
 * Free parking is in an 11-story parking garage
 * Follow signs from main Venetian entrance
 * Valet is easier sometimes if you don't mind waiting & hate walking

The Venetian Resort Hotel and Casino is a truly remarkable Vegas Strip hotel offering upscale value and amenities for reasonable prices. It should be one of the first places you check for reservations before any trip to Las Vegas.

LAS VEGAS RESTAURANT WEEK!!!

$20.00 3 course lunch!!!

I wanted to hit a bunch of places for LVRW, but i could only make it to this one plus dinner at Del Friscos. I read some previous reviews that this place used to be alot more high end, and made some changes to make this more of a tapas place with a bar. It definitely looked more price friendly and $20 for 3 courses was a steal!

I started off with a nice caesar salad, complete with a tiny anchovie and yummy fontina and brioche croutons http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=i2U5iJLxkTWXSHQAdivVNA

The shortrib sandwich was next http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=LcQPsvafLFyw9GLqWZMl9Q.
It was almost like a bahn mi. Bread was yum and shortrib was tasty. I enjoyed it better when i put some of the coleslaw into the sammie. 

Lastly was some tasty sorbets for dessert http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=rWJOt4nICtNbUqEqtZaIIQ

We also added an order of the Cuban Panini. I wished we had ordered the tuna tacos instead. The panini i think would have tasted better with some bacon in it. hahaha. The bread was a little too heavy. HOWEVER the FRIES were amazing!!! I think they were twice fried in duck fat or something, cuz i seriously started to break out after i ate some. But it was yummy!

WHAT? I can't hear you!
Grace? Died 30 years ago!
Good luck conversing.

I don't review many chains, but I am going to take a stab on this one.  Been meaning to check out a Yard House ever since Josh A's glowing endorsement on the Talk boards awhile back.  102 tap beers sounded right up my alley.  Didn't think I had ever been to one before, but it was pointed out to me that I was at one in San Diego in the Gaslamp Quarter a couple years ago.  Remember really having liked it.  Probably would have gone 4 or 5.  Low 3 on today's visit.

The music was blaring loud this evening.  I'm sorry, but Matchbox 20 was not meant to be played that loud.  They are not even that good as background music.  I thought the waitress was going to kiss my mother on the lips as she was leaning in so close to hear the order.  Do they really think people like the music that loud?  Most of the customers were either parents with kids or gray-haired snowbirds.  No one was rocking out to it. 

Had two Uinta Hop Notch's which I have never seen anywhere else before.  Quite tasty.  The menu is very extensive both on beer and food.  Got the Mediterranean flatbread as an appetizer.  It was not good.  No sauce whatsoever, just toppings on crust.  Would have also been much better if the tomatoes were sun dried.  Would not get it again.

The blackened swordfish tacos were pretty good.  Little light on the fish, but excellent flavor with a healthy dose of guacamole.  I would definitely get these again.  Also had a couple bites of the Vodka Shrimp Pasta.  Think I will get that the next time I go when they open at West End in St. Louis Park.  Hopefully, they will use the volume dial on the music more prudently.

I went here with a group of six and everyone was pretty bombed after a fun afternoon on the strip.  Dinner suggestions popped up, but options got slimmer when a companion meeting us was sporting a Randy "Macho Man" Savage t-shirt.  Giada was undoubtedly out of the question.  Carmine's welcomed us with open arms.  

My jaw dropped as the hostess walked us to our table.  I gawked and commented out loud to no one in particular on the enormous portions at other tables.  Yeah, it's family style, but who's family??  The Brady Brunch with Alice?  Joey Chestnut's family???  The Klumps????  Monstrous plates of pasta were everywhere!!

The spicy wings were a fantastic appetizer.  $32 got us 24 wings, sliced fennel as opposed to celery, and their homemade bleu cheese dip.  Carmine's isn't a typical place to order wings, but these were some of the best I've had in recent memory.  The tomato based sauce had nice spicy kick and went so well with the thick dip.  The fennel grew on me bite after bite as it kind of worked as a palette cleanser.     

Then all the main entrees came out.  Good god!!  The chicken parmigiana had ton of cheese on top and managed not to be dry despite being hammered super thin.  Ragu with meatballs was suggested by our server and he didn't steer us wrong.  I overheard someone else say the meatballs were "tender as fuck".  I agreed.  

The main event was the "Four Pasta Special" which is only available Sundays.  If you have a chance to check out my picture, just look at how small the server's hand/wrist looks compared to the dish.  It looks like a child brought this dish over!  We barely made a dent in it.  I enjoyed lasagna and gnocchi the most.

My wife and I could never eat here by ourselves unless I cleared my car trunk out to make room for the leftovers.  The ones I did have on this particular evening came in a large aluminum buffet pan (no joke) and weighed at least 5 pounds.  If a full on Italian pig out is what you're looking for, look no further.

Those who live by the sword...

We came here last evening around six for quick bite and walked in on a crazy house.  You couldn't tell it by the two other couples eating here.  It was only when we got to the counter and discovered they couldn't stop taking telephone Take-Out orders to take ours. LOL  

We actually didn't wait too long, maybe ninety seconds.  But the phones were ringing off the hook!  China Jade is basically an old style Chinese Take-Out place, doubling as a restaurant.  Gaging by the phones ringing every thirty seconds, there's no need to change their setup.  You don't fix things that aren't broken.

China Jade's weakness isn't the food. It's the hurried service to get back to the phones.  I am not exaggerating this point.  It was almost bye-bye cell phone as they nearly spilt the soup in their rush. And, since China Jade is built for takeout, you'll find a lot of plastic plates and utensils. The soup BTW was served in a  plastic 16 oz "To Go" container (photo).

From our standpoint this is all minor stuff, if the food is good.  Last night the food was very good and just short of Four Stars. 

We had the Hot & Sour Soup (photos), eight Fried Dumplings, Sesame Chicken with Fried Rice and a soft drink; all for just $18 including tax. Nice! 

So, Three and a Half Stars "A-OK" and we'll be back; most likely for Take-Out. LOL

A lifesaver during my last Vegas trip. My first mistake: assuming everything there would be fattening and unhealthy like every other crepe place. But wait! They have fresh cleansing juices. Oh my! I've never been into juicing but this place changed my mind for sure. 

Have you ever become FITTER during a Vegas trip?!? Well, it happened to me. I was very pleased with the surprising results. How did it happen?

All hail the **Detoxifyer**! Densely packed with kale, celery, apple, beet, ginger, and lemon, the juice is delicious compared to many of the healthy concoctions out there. Of course it can't compare to a sugary juice, but it does soooo much more.

I had arrived in Vegas knowing I would be attending a pool party at Wet Republic after 4 days of eating terribly. There were no vegetables or good salad options anywhere around. So I had a feeling I'd gain weight by the time I had to don a bikini. But hey! Detoxifyer to the rescue! One juice once a day for 3 days was enough to do the trick. On the 4th day I put on my swimsuit and was actually impressed. I couldn't believe it.

If you need something more substantial to eat (I did), try **The Fitness** crepe and add Alfredo chicken to the mushroom spinachy mozzarella goodness. I split one of these with with my friend and also had the Detoxifyer.

The only thing I'd change about this place is the system to indicate when orders are ready. They have to shout the order number out and then people come up and take items without having to show a receipt. Maybe a more automated system that shows a number and patrons have to show proof of purchase. My order was stolen twice! Granted the MGM Grand was overrun by about 15,000 people from my company's convention. But still, such a system would help even on a daily basis.

Overall I love Blizz for introducing healthy juice options to me. Thank you to the clerks for the recommendation! And special thanks to the Detoxifyer! You've really opened my eyes.

DATE TIP: The Detoxifyer will definitely get you ready for your next hot Vegas date. 

TIP: [[[ T.M.I. Alert ]]] Remember that what you put in must also come out. You may have to use the restroom slightly more often than before, and things may look the same color as when you consumed them. The Detoxifyer is a vivid pomegranate color. Haha, I told you it was TMI. You've been warned!

I hate buffets, but I had heard so many good things about Bacchanal I said I'll give it a whirl for breakfast ($28/each).  We had:

Freshly squeezed juices like carrot and cucumber
Smoked salmon & cold shrimp
Steak & egg
Biscuits and gravy, sausage and cheesy tots
Fried chicken and waffles
Sorbets:  Thai tea; fig & balsamic; mango chile lime; and blood orange

There were also your basic fare of eggs, bacon, hash browns, waffles, and an extensive array of desserts.

The juices were excellent and full of flavor.  I had four:  5 Stars.  In addition, the salmon and shrimp were fresher compared most buffets:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the hot dishes disappointed.  They were not warm.  In addition, the biscuits were not that moist, the sausage in the gravy was not crumbled well, and there wasn't enough pepper:  2 Stars.

On the other hand, the sorbets were really good and flavorful, with the mango chile lime being my favorite.  You could really taste the chile:  5+++'Stars for the latter flavor.  The woman who served me was from Puerto Rico, and we struck up a conversation in Spanish which was cool.

The remainder of the service was spotty.  Although there were many open tables, it took a while to be seated.  The group in front of me thought the same.  Additionally, we had to ask for water, and our glasses were not refilled.  Lastly, we told one server that we were going to the restroom.  However, when we returned, someone had cleared our table:  2 Stars.

I would come back here for breakfast.  However, I would not come back for dinner ($55), and wait an hour or more.  There are far better things to do in Vegas, than wait in a buffet line.

Over the last few days, I've eaten here four times.

First, I took my daughter for a late dinner on Tuesday night; then I sprung a friend over at Westminster Retirement for his first Chicago Italian Beef yesterday; then my son on his last night in Scottsdale wanted some comfort food before journeying to California for his new job; and lastly, today we had a UYE with Phoenix Buffet King Rand H, Robyn N, Mike C and his fiancee Jackie R.

Over the last few days I've gotten to know Mike Portillo pretty well.  He's a great guy who is in charge of Training at his family's restaurants and is here working the kitchen with the rest of his employees. Given the crazy opening three months ago, he's done an incredible job! A textbook management case study if you ask me!

The food is still great!  And now, that some our out of town guests have returned to points north, it's easier to get in and out of here. The place today was packed, but with three/four cashiers working, the wait-time was less than ten minutes to get your food. Nice!

Sooooo, if you feel like an Italian Beef, Combo with sausage, or a Chicago "Red Hot" stop on by.

Now a shout-out to Nancy P, who is next door at Scottsdale Health waiting to deliver her son and tells me: "Think my hubby will be spending a lot of time in line here while I'm recovering after our son is born!"  You hear that Mike!

After reading MaryLou D's review on Yelp, a group of us from my office decided to come here for a late afternoon lunch.

We were blown away by this Mom (sorry, no Pop) place. Nana is cooking up some really tasty food. I had the Carne Asada burrito, which was huge.  Take a look at my knife and fork (photo) next to this bad boy. 

Second, the flavors were outstanding and we couldn't get over the amount of meat that she gave us.  Even at $6.50, there must have been well over a cup and a half of diced Carne Asada. Wow. 

While she was making our food, we got a chance to catch up on our favorite Mexican Soaps on the flat screen TV, munching on some chips with some really good and flavorful homemade salsa (with four alarm heat), and all the while enjoying a 16 oz bottled long neck Coke. Atmosphere. Atmosphere. Atmosphere! We didn't want to go back to work. Time moves slowly here, but not Nana. She's always hustling!

Expect to pay around $11, including a very generous Tip to Nana for this incredible meal. Four Stars and yes, we are Fans. Thank you MaryLou!

The Cosmopolitan's  "grand social experiment".  It delivers!

Walk in to be greeted by five doors.  Some leading into turn of the century meets Star Trek rooms, others, well...  Spaces morph, the experience evolves, life happens all around you.  Live bands, eclectic music, spontaneous vaudeville acts and a stage production, good food, great craft cocktails.  You need to experience it to understand.

Essentially it's a craft cocktail ultra lounge, stage production, and mega club and restaurant all in one.

Breaking it down:

Craft Cocktails - Excellent, many reinvented, from classics.  Very consistent (a rarity when some cocktails contain 10+ ingredients).

Stage Production (Vegas Nocturne) -  Similar to Absinthe.  Acrobatics, comedy, tap dancing, strip teases. No more details as you are sworn to secrecy.  

Club - Still need to experience this.

Restaurant - Inventive and indulgent.  Many items to be shared like the outstanding caviar mini tacos (Yukon gold shells filled with hamachi and drowned in caviar), deconstructed oysters Rockefeller (fried oysters on a bacon butter sauted spinach and bacon dust in an oyster shell) or the tete de cochon (deep fried panko crusted head cheese topped with a poached egg).

For larger dishes, the reinvented beef Wellington (beef tenderloin with a generous portion of seared foie, trumpet mushrooms, studded with cream spinach, topped with shaved black truffle and crowned by a flaky, latticed puff pastry is very good albeit rich.

Incredible caviar service (five types sold by the ounce, half kilo, kilo).

Outstanding wine and champagne list.  Ultra lounge prices.

Tip;  To make the most of your experience:
1.  Make a night of it.  Drinks, dinner, and the show.
2.  Move through the rooms.  There is something different in each.
3.  Make reservations if you want to eat a full meal.
4.  Purchase your tickets in advance for the show.  Don't skimp.  Pay the $135 for the best seats.
5.  Shows are not the same.  The later you go, the edgier.
6.  Be prepared to spend $$$$.  The show, dinner, and some cocktails averages $300 per person.  Add some caviar and bottles of wine and it's easy to drop several dimes.

Now if only I can remember how Alice got home after falling down the rabbit hole.

Right now they are open Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays from 7 am - 12 pm. Admission is free if you are walking in, but $3 to drive in with your vehicle. There is parking right across from the entrance if you decide not to drive in. I grew up coming to this orchard for school field trips as well with family and friends. I love that this place is still here! The area is rich in history, which could take a whole review alone so, I recommend reading up on it sometime and maybe you will appreciate the area even more. They have such a huge orchard that depending on the time of season you come, you really need to dress accordingly especially if you plan on walking through. There is about 60 acres to explore. They have a stand at the entrance if you just want to grab some stuff already picked, or you can take your time exploring the orchard and pick what you like. They provide wagons for you to use.

When I visited yesterday they were offering the following:
Carrots - $1 per pound
Beets - $1 per pound
Cucumbers - $1 per pound
Green Tomatoes - $1 per pound
Apricots - $1 per pound
Squash - $1 per pound
Zucchini - $1 per pound
Peaches - $1 per pound
Honey - $7 for the honey bear and $20 for a quart
Garlic - $2 for 3 bulbs or $10 for 3 pounds
New Potatoes - $2 per bag
Onions - $1 each
Peanut Butter - $6 each
Almond Butter - $8 each 

I came specifically for a honey bear and some peanut butter. Both sell out fast and aren't always available. If you can get your hands on some, I recommend it! The honey is fresh and comes right from the orchard. The peanut butter us a huge hit in our house and doesn't last long. If you ever at the orchard when they are making fresh apple cider donuts you must try some! They are usually only a couple bucks and SO worth it! Sign up for their weekly newsletter and find out when they have available for harvest and what types of food items they might be cooking up.

I know, I know, this is a brand new steakhouse in Vegas and I probably committed every faux pas in the book by ordering the fish. But I did it. And I don't regret it for a minute.

FOOD:
---------
As our group asked for my opinion on appetizers, I knew I had to select the **Smoked Pork Terrine** because it offered the sublime foie gras, of which I have been deprived for ages, being a Californian and all. Combined with delicious pickled figs and pepper jelly atop a piece of bread, this appetizer was everything I wanted and more.

I was a little worried that choosing the **Roasted Market Fish** would be a total mistake, but it was delicious! It turned out to be Sea Bass with a tomato paste and zucchini relish. The bass was prepared perfectly, being sufficiently firm while also smoothly melting in the mouth. This would rival any bass from an acclaimed seafood restaurant. I sampled a piece of Anna's **Porterhouse** and it was divine. I would definitely order it on my next visit.

For side dishes we got the roasted mushrooms, asparagus, creamless sweet creamed corn. We all thought the asparagus could have used some more flavoring or some sort of creative twist, but the corn was a huge hit with its buttery smoothness.

SERVICE / AMBIANCE:
-------------------------------
Absolutely outstanding. Every member of the staff we encountered was on point, very warm and helpful, and extremely professional. Our server had an entertaining sense of humor. Even the busser impressed us with his refined gestures.

The decor is mod and clean with beautiful wood accents everywhere. The open kitchen in the back is a nice touch.

Of course you get what you pay for, so be ready to lay down some cash. For four people (3 steaks, 1 fish, 3 sides, 4 drinks), we each fronted about $100.

DATE TIP: With swankified dining at its best,
How could your date not be impressed?

Vdara is a winner! It has a ton to offer without having to spend a ton of money for it. During CES/AVN weekend, I was able to book 2 nights here for $169/night, which was the best value on the Strip for that weekend. The City Center hotel is just over a year old, so the rooms are really nicely appointed with modern amenities. Although there is no casino and not much in terms of dining options, it's conveniently located next to The Cosmopolitan, Aria and Bellagio, so it's just a short walk to some of the best gambling, clubs and restaurants in Vegas. An additional upside is that the hotel is clean and smells really nice when you walk through the lobby because no smoking is allowed and they pump this lovely scent through their vents. I wish my house smelled like that. 

My BFF and I enjoyed our suite; bed was super comfy, bathroom was really nice and stocked with Aveda products, and there was a mini kitchenette, great for heating up leftovers at 4am. Our other friends stayed in a similar sized king room that had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains so we got a great view of the water show at night. But the rest of our friends had the best suite of all: the 1,447 square foot 2-story penthouse suite with two bedrooms, 2.5 baths, living room and fully equipped gourmet kitchen. There were 6 people staying here, and at $600/night, it was such a steal. Like I said, you can feel like a big baller without breaking the bank here. Unfortunately, their check-in process was a bit of a nightmare as the suite was not ready at 3pm, but they did give them spa credits.

I'd definitely consider staying here again, especially since it's just a hop, jump and a skip away (ok, maybe a painfully long walk if you've been dancing in stilettos all night) to The Cosmo, my new favorite casino resort.

I came across this place on yelp and wanted to check it out. We used to have some Hostess outlets in the NW part of town (since closed) that I liked and was hoping to find something similar to that in this place. I found much more than I expected! Walking in I was greeted by a friendly cashier who asked if I had been in before. When I told her I hadn't, she went over the different sections and said to ask if I had any questions. They mostly have Entenmann's, Oroweat, Thomas, Grandma Sycamore's and Sara Lee goods, but they also have other stuff like Bear Creek soup and Boboli pizza crusts. I got a loaf of Sun Maid cinnamon raisin bread for just $1.75 and Texas Toast for the same price. Bagels were $1.99 and I picked out some pizza crusts, english muffins and other pastries. The prices here are drastically lower compared to buying these items at the grocery store. Not even Walmart has a "rollback" like this! 

When I got to the register I was given a stamp card. You get a punch for every dollar you spend. Once the card is full you can get a free item by the brand listed on the card. For every $9 spent you also get to pick something free (changes everyday) from the premium section near the front door. I also received a $1 coupon to bring back towards my total purchase for a future visit and the cashier told me I can combine them! The $1 coupons can only be used during the month on them so make sure to pay attention to that. You get a $1 off coupon for every $8 you spend.The cashier said what is sold here isn't leftover stale stuff from the grocery stores like most people think. She says Bimbo is the largest bread supplier and the stuff sold here is leftovers, but fresh leftovers that grocery stores, etc. had no shelf room for. Nothing I purchased was past a "sell by" date and was soft and fresh. This bakery outlet isn't anywhere near where I live, but I work in the area once a week and will make a point to stop and load up on delicious savings.

What a great place for breakfast! BBD has a very warm, friendly, family feel to it. Cindi was our server and she is fantastic! She took the time to answer all our questions and never let my coffee cup go empty. The coffee by the way was delicious! The menu was on newspaper and there are stories also on it telling the (you are allowed to keep it) story of BBD and other stuff. Most of the food on the menu is made from scratch and it says you can customize your order any way that you like and if they can do it, they will.

I ordered from their "little less" menu which has smaller portions. It was still enough to fill me! For $6.99 I had 1 egg, 2 pieces of bacon, hash browns and sourdough toast. The egg was cooked just the way I ordered it, the bacon had great flavor, the hash browns were too tasty and the sourdough toast was great! Something simple as breakfast is easy to mess up, but they do it right here. I also ordered a "Bear Claw" priced at $4.49 however I was too stuffed from breakfast to tackle that big boy! Cindi packed it to-go for me and said to just pop it in the microwave for 25-30 seconds before I'm ready to eat it. She also said the bear claws are made at each location daily! That bear claw made for one mighty fine dessert :)

Lunch and dinner is also served here at BBD. I have no doubt it is probably tasty, but I'm sure this will me more of a breakfast spot for me since I enjoyed that so much.

I recently stayed here for a bachelor party. The hotel lobby was decked out with sick flat screen columns that looked like wall paper, but changed throughout the day. The check-in counters used iPads (with a stylus?!?), though it seemed like a fairly frivolous addition. 

Service at this relatively new hotel was extremely rough. We had a block of rooms reserved together before we arrived, however at check-in that information was lost and people were checked into rooms all over the place. The staff worked hard to get us rooms in the same tower at least and ended up comping us each for one night and giving us half off the second night (a few of us were stuck room-less for 3 hours). In addition to the check-in mishap there was a "cleaning" problem in one of the rooms. I won't get into the details, but it needed immediate attention, which unfortunately had to be requested multiple times. Also on Sunday morning I ordered room service that never arrived, when I called to check on it they suggested I go to the buffet instead.

My suite had a great view of the Bellagio fountain. Decor was attractive and it felt spacious enough for one. The bachelor got a massive bungalow (he was majorly upgraded due to our many service issues). It had a private entrance to the hot new club: Marquee as well as 3 floors, views of the club, and an outdoor hot tub. Unfortunately the lack of sound insulation meant he couldn't sleep until the music stopped (after 5am). Also the fancy stereo system wasn't working on the main floor so we couldn't pipe in any music. Furnishings in the bungalow (like the couch) seemed designed more for ease of cleaning than style.

While it's a cool looking hotel for now, I suspect the heavy use of technology means it won't look or feel modern for all that long unless they have a big budget for frequent upgrades. In my mind... Encore remains the Vegas champ.

El Dorado Cantina is one of my favorite new restaurants in town.  This definitely rivals Javier's at Aria for the "high end" Vegas Mexican cuisine market, but the prices are way more reasonable.  Chef Paco and his staff are churning out some really good stuff.  

Want a great way to spice up a weekday dinner?  How about doing as the Aztecs did back in the day (century) and start off with some grasshoppers?  Yes, sir!  EDC's "chapulines" can be prepared sauted either in garlic lime or habanero.  For the uninitiated, the closest thing to compare them to would be crispy shrimp tails but juicier.  The habanero order offered terrific heat and not in a painful, shoot me in the face kind of way.  At $7.50, it was a large portion that could have easily satisfied a party of six.  Not for everyone by any means, my wife was literally one and done, but I enjoyed it and had plenty to take home (fried rice, anyone?).

"Imperial Shrimp" was everything I look for in an appetizer: seafood stuffed Pacific wild shrimp wrapped in bacon and then lightly fried. The creamy heat (sounds gross, right?) from the chipotle ranch dressing that accompanied the dish was awesome.  More things in life should be wrapped in bacon!  I should start a national campaign.

We chose to split the humungous carne asada entre.  The citrus marinated steak was medium rare perfection.  I loved the big slabs of grilled cactus that it came with.  We probably boxed up 70 percent of the plate.  Goddamn nachos and salsa....

You'd think that would prevent us from ordering dessert, but the flan and tres leches cake somehow made it to the table.  The latter was plated nicely and the rum flavor made me feel like I was on vacation.  It was a great end to the meal and I can't wait to try more.

BurGR is definitely a fun place.

I'm not a big fan of GR's TV persona or schtick.  Though there is something positive to be said about his mercurial nature and focus on detail.  So, given our short eleven hours in Vegas, we decided to come here.

At the heart of BurGR, you'll find some good food and I believe GR poking fun at himself.  The restaurant has several photos, as does the menu, of him hands up in a fit of mock anger.  I believe, there's a wee sparkle and impishness in those eyes.

So, what about the food you say?

It's good!  Very good in fact.  And, those BurGRs are worth every penny of the $14.00 to $17.00 you'll pay to enjoy them.

The reason isn't too hard to understand.  Given that mercurial nature, GR chose to cook the food: "Paying special attention to not only the ingredients but the method, beef patties will be cooked over an open flame fueled by hard woods."  

So it isn't too difficult to see why they have a complex smokey taste, that layers nicely with the various toppings and ingredients. 

We had the American and Euro BurGRs.  The Euro (photo) came with truffle aioli, goat cheese and arugula, while the American came with american cheese, butter lettuce, tomato, pickles and red onion.  Both were delicious, though the Euro was more interesting on the palate.  GR's focus to detail even shows up on the selection of the bun. Nice!

Another WOW if you will, were the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Seems the BurGR fries are "hand-cut and thrice cooking will ensure extra crispness" and they use Kennebec instead of Russet potatoes  which "offering a lighter, less starchy and crisper fry"  

Okay, we agree.  But what makes them special, is the hair like shavings of parmesan cheese (photo) with a special aioli oil sauce for dipping. Ohh, are they good.

So, with a glass of wine, a nice pint of Leinenkugel on tap, a couple of BurGRs and some of those wonderful Truffle Fries, expect to pay around $27.50 each, not including gratuities or taxes.

Enjoy!

I have been stopping by here for lunch and like the subs I have had. Inside is very clean and the employees are friendly and say hello when I walk in. They have plenty of tables if you want to eat inside, but I get my food to-go. The meat is sliced fresh and the sandwiches are made to order. Sometimes they can get busy around lunch time and since I'm on a time limit for lunch, I just call in my order for pick up so that it's ready when I arrive. 

Hook and Ladder - A medium costs $5.99 and includes a pickle. The sub has smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham and monterey jack cheese. I like it "fully involved" which means it comes with deli mustard, mayo, onion, lettuce and tomato. Per my request they leave the lettuce off. The subs are served hot and this sub is my favorite of them all. Usually I don't like deli mustard, but there is something about it on this particular sub that just makes it taste great. 

Firehouse Meatball - A large costs $8.49 and depending on your appetite could be shared between two people. This sub has Italian meatballs, provolone, marinara and Italian seasonings. I usually order this one "sweet and spicy" which means they add pepper sauce and red pepper flakes. I really like this meatball sub a lot. It's always hot, the bread good, meatballs good, melted cheese good, but..... there is a consistency issue with the taste of the sweet and spicy part. Sometimes it's just right and sometimes they put so much pepper sauce that it's too hot. When this sub is good it's very good, but when it's drenched in pepper sauce it's hard to taste anything else. 

The medium sub is just perfect for my appetite. If you are the type like my husband who eats 1 footers, you might want to order the large sandwich. They also offer catering.

About a week ago, our AC finally gave out and died.

We have been trying to keep it alive for the last five years.  Freon, new blower, condenser, still more freon, welding a leak, a new outside fan and heater switch, and finally still more freon.  

So I found myself around midnight searching Yelp for HVAC businesses and couldn't find any in my area.  I then tried "Air Conditioning", nothing.  Finally I expanded the area and found Flores, 

Parker and Sons, George Brazil were also listed.  But after reading a few reviews, I decided to go with Flores.  They had over 55 reviews, by far and away the most of any HVAC business. Of those 55 reviews, an incredible 49 were Five Stars. I also saw and read many of my Yelp friends, and decided to give them a call the next morning.

I knew before they came, that our time was up with the old unit. Though I held out some hope that maybe there was a possible stop gap measure. But it was pretty clear what was needed to be done.  

I spoke to Miguel and Jorge for a long time and we agreed they would work up an estimate. No charge for their hour long visit and stating the obvious. Very professional. 

The next day I received by email an indepth estimate for the new unit and air handler. We had a very old four ton Trane unit which was too small for our house. 

The new Trane unit was going to be five tons (see photos). After reviewing their estimate, I stopped by Costco and other places, as well as searching online. Everywhere, the estimates were at least $2,000 or more higher than the Flores' estimate

I gave them the go ahead and it took a little more than a week. They arrived early yesterday morning and put drop cloths down throughout the house. I was very impressed. 

Flores is actually four brothers, who work very well together. They all have their own specialty. Seems they've done this before. LOL

They arrived at 7:30 am and finished around 5pm. When they were finished, the house was at 89 degrees. It took less than twenty-five minutes for our new AC to get it down 73!

The final bill came in exactly at the original estimate. Wow!  Thank you Miguel, Jorge, Carlos and Jaime!  If I could give you guys Six Stars I would.

The Cheesesteaks here are now the best I've had in town! There was a flyer put on my door earlier in the week from this place and it sounded good so hubby and I gave this place a try. Hubby actually ordered a "Original Cheesesteak" with cheese whiz, onions and peppers, but I ended up eating almost half of it. I just loved the flavor and enjoyed every bite! The sandwich was 10 inches long and stuffed with thinly shaved beef. We shared a order of "Mozzarella Sticks" priced at $7 and they were cheesy. Each one had their own unique shape as they are hand breaded to order. Be prepared for lots and lots of oozing cheese with these! I do wish the breading had more flavor, but they are totally worth ordering. I ordered a "Italian White Pie" priced at $16.50 and it was 14 inches. The pizza had mozzarella, ricotta, sausage, broccoli rabe, garlic and caramelized onions. I liked the pizza, but it actually tasted much better re-heated the next day for lunch. The guy who took our order and gave us our food was nice. I'd like to come back and try some of their other pizzas, sandwiches, salads and of course I will be back for more cheesesteak! 

Delivery is offered. Check the website to see if you are in the delivery area. They have different lunch specials daily.

T is for ... Tantalizing Bars & Restaurants
A is for ... Artsy and Hip
N is for ... Never-ending Naughtiness

Every adjective you've heard about the Cosmopolitan is true. It's a chic, contemporary, opulent, decadent, lovely, lavish, romantic, artsy, naughty, and hip hotel located in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip with amazing panoramic views, a bevy of restaurants, and a very cool club in Marquee.

Olivia Z. and me stayed in a luxurious Terrace One Bedroom on the 62nd floor with an outdoor Private Terrace offering a magnificent panoramic view of the neon-lit Strip. The room featured separate king bed and living areas including a kitchenette. The bathroom had dual sinks, shower, and a wonderful Japanese Soaking Tub (that was an amazing way to unwind at the end of each day).

Stay in the East Tower if you want to be closer to the Strip, Restaurants, Marquee Day & Night Club, and Bars. It was very convenient for us. Since Cosmopolitan is next to Bellagio, many rooms (with up charge) offer a view of the Fountains or you can easily walk there to catch a few of the Fountain Shows. Another upgrade option is a Upgrade to a Wrap Around Terrace on a corner which was really promoted when we checked-in.

Resort Fees are $28 and include access to the Gym, Pool, and WiFi (2 devices only).

Self Parking is easy. If you are staying in the East Tower, be sure to drive all the way to the east side of the parking lot for convenience to your elevator. Also, note the shortcut entrance/exit from the east tower, too. Valet is easy, too. It is all done in the parking structure and very comfortable and convenient.

Wicked Buffet is over-rated, but ok. Holsteins, on the other hand, makes an amazing burger (The Risng Sun with Kobe-style Beef & add Fried Egg). Secret Pizza isn't a secret anymore. Comme Ca is a relaxing choice for happy hour. STK and Scarpetta are so-so for the higher prices.

The Cosmopolitan Las Vegas may not be a 5-star hotel or casino, but it is a convenient, chic, contemporary, lovely, romantic, artsy, naughty, and hip place to celebrate and have fun in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip.

I was shopping at the nearby Centennial Center as I do pretty much every week and even though there are many food options within the shopping center, I was bored with those options at the moment. I decided to pull up places on the good ole yelp app and came across Above the Crust. It's on Ann Rd across from Painted Desert, so not too far behind Centennial Center. Deciding to give Above the Crust a try, I stopped in and placed a order. They have so many good deals going on each day! It being Tuesday meant that I could get a large pizza free with the purchase of a large pizza and toppings an additional $2 each. I went with a large cheese and a large pepperoni and added a couple "Garlic Rolls" priced at .95 cents each. I really liked the taste of the pizza and the sauce on it. The rolls had a nice garlic and butter flavor on the outside, the inside was a bit too much bread that was tough. I prefer a more traditional knot personally. When I walked in, I was greeted with a friendly hello from all the employees and I was given a menu and a flyer that shows the current daily specials offered. 

Sunday and Monday ($32.95) - Large pizza, bucket of wings, 4 garlic rolls and a 2 liter of soda.

Two for Tuesday - Buy one large pizza get one free.

Wing Wednesday (24.95) - Sampler bucket of wings, choose up to 4 flavors.

Friday Special ($29.95) - Large pizza and a bucket of fingers.

Stromboli Saturday ($17.95) - Large pizza and any stromboli. 

Daily special ($5.95) - 2 slices and a drink.

They offer delivery and also offer sandwiches, salads and calzones.

In the ever evolving world of sandwiches, many claim to produce the best sandwich in the world.  Among the contenders are the likes of Capriotti's, Mendocino Farms, Which Wich? and many more. Among this iconic list of sandwich makers, there are droves of fans and haters alike.
But make no mistake, The Earl of Sandwich makes some of the most addictively good sandwiches i've enjoyed in a very long time! Tack on the competitive prices and it makes it even better! So it's safe to say i'm a fan when it comes to the Earl's cheap & tasty eats!


The Original with Roast Beef - 
The bread was excellent! As soon as I grabbed the warm bag in my hand, I knew I was in for a toasty treat!
The bread was perfectly crisp on the outside yet warm and fluffy on the inside. Not thick, bread-y, dry & spongy like most other places. The roast beef was piled high and it was juicy and full of mouthwatering flavor!

Jerk Chicken Sandwich
Filled with generous portions of chunk grilled chicken breast (not sandwich meat), red peppers and of course a good helping of zippy banana peppers, this zesty lil number was quite flavorful and surprisingly juicy (considering it was chicken breast!) but my favorite has to be the original for overall mmmmmm mmmm mm factor!

Dessert
Brownie Cream Sandwich
Imagine two chocalatey rich brownies sandwiching a decadent layer of sweet vanilla frosting...yup it's insanely rich and sweet! I advise you to purchase a glass of milk with this decadent number cuz you'll definitely need it!

Service was nifty & quick and they got us in and out in no time flat! Don't forget that all toppings are free with the exclusion of avocado, so pile it high if you so desire! And did I mention the prices? Only 6$ for a delicious hot sammie! That's a steal for a great sandwich on the strip I might add!

With that said, it's a no brainer...if you're out after the club looking for some awesome late nite eats or just strolling the strip, give EoS a try, you won't be disappointed!

Happy Eats!

Ellis Island, you are dead to me!

Oh Ellis Island, I have been a fan for over 10 years. I have been a loyal customer. I have sung your praises from mountain tops. I brought my friends to enjoy the goodness (or should I say former goodness) of your $7.99 steak dinner. But no more! After the experience I had last night, you are indeed now dead to me and hopefully to all the people who read this review.

Ellis Island, I stuck with the even after you continually raised the price of your steak dinner from $4.99 to $5.99 to $6.99 to what it is now $7.99.

Ellis Island, I stuck with you despite the increasingly awful service...your employees have no sense of urgency nor do they understand customer service.

Ellis Island, I stuck with you even after finding out that your "center cut sirloin" is indeed just beef scraps combined with meat glue, rolled up into a loaf and cut into "steaks."

But, after the experience I had last night with your obnoxious, insensitive, offensive, bully of a restaurant manager I will never visit your establishment again.

I arrived on a Monday night at 9:15pm very excited and hungry. I was really looking forward to a "steak" dinner. We were unenthusiastically "greeted" by a hostess who told us there was a 20 minute wait. Odd, the restaurant was more than half empty...in fact the casino was almost empty. The hostess then directed my attention to a printer paper sign stating the kitchen is being cleaned and anyone who arrives after 9:30 pm will only be able to order off of a limited menu. As we were given a 20 minute wait time I asked the hostess if we would be able to get the steak dinner...she said no. I told her we were there now and if we were seated by 9:30, the supposed cut off time, would we be able to order the steak dinner...she said no. I explained we came specifically for the steak dinner, having walked from the strip, and asked if there was any way we could get the steak dinner...she said no. I then asked to speak to the manager.

After a long wait the manager finally arrived...with a security guard. Really, a security guard? Please look at my Yelp picture...do I look like a threat? The manager stood about 2 inches from my face and proceeded to tell me No over and over again. He kept interrupting me when I pointed out his restaurant was empty, that the hostess was specifically giving wait times so that that people would have to order off the limited menu, etc. I told him his manner and policies were completely unacceptable. I finally just asked, "Am I going to be able to order a steak dinner?" He got even closer to me and yelled, "No!" I then informed him that I would make sure to tell everyone about this terrible experience and he yelled in a close and threatening manner, "Don't threaten me!" I told him that I was not threatening, just informing him that this is what is going to happen and this is what happens when people receive horrible customer service like this. We then walked out, while the manager continued to yell at us.

Amazing! I have never had an experience like this. Just an FYI to you my Yelp friends...this is the experience you can expect from Ellis Island. Inferior food, inferior service, all served up to you by a manager who is a bully. Enter at your own risk.

I finally made it over to Pink Box Doughnuts to see what everyone has been raving about. I will say one thing, you cannot compare Pink Box to places like Dunkin' Donuts or Winchell's because they are simply different. After having Pink Box, I can't see ever going to one of those chains again when I can go to a locally owned shop and taste the love in each bite. These doughnuts are made from scratch daily.

They have the doughnuts broken down into 3 different types: classic, specialty and gourmet. The classic such as "Glazed" or "Buttermilk" are $1 each. The specialty doughnuts like the "Bavarian Creme" are $1.25 each and gourmet favorites like the "Fat Elvis" or "Date With A Nutty Pig" are $1.75 each. They have half and full dozen boxes (pink of course!) with prices ranging from $8.50 - $12.50 for those.

I saw on Facebook they were now selling "Cronuts" so of course I asked about those. They were sold out! I spoke with Lance behind the counter who said they had made Cronuts 3 times that day already. I went just after 11 am so apparently people are scrambling to try them. Not having tried the original from NYC, how can I really compare it though? I guess I just want to taste it and get some sort of idea what it might be like. I will try again! Lance says you can just call ahead and if they have the menu item you are looking for then they will hold it for you. 

So I decided that I needed to try the "Fat Elvis" after hearing about it and I am kicking myself for not trying this sooner. DELICIOUS! It is just flat out good! The Fat Elvis is topped with chocolate icing & a caramelized banana, and filled with a homemade peanut butter & banana filling. This doughnut had me feeling stingy since I didn't want to share a single bite with hubby, but I had to darn it!

The 'Apple Fritter" needs some work. The texture is perfect. It is soft and chewy inside, and crunchy on the outside where it needs to be. The thing that gets me is why it's called an apple fritter if there are no apples in it? I didn't bite into a single apple! Boo-Hoo!

When I saw a Doughnut with fruit loops on it I had to give it a try. I was told by a worker that this was called the "Fruit Loop Doughnut" and I get the fun concept, but it just doesn't work. The long glazed doughnut is really good, but the fruit loops they put on top just absorb the glaze they rest on so they are soggy and chewy. 

Last and certainly not least is the "Cinnamon Tornado" and I have to tell you, it lives up to the name. When I took the first bite it was like a tornado of instant flavor, and it seriously melted inside my mouth. Very yummy.

There was a sign out front that said they are now open 24 hours on weekends.

Omakase!!
I'm a fan of Chef Nobu and I've been dreaming of dining at one of his restaurant some day. Well tonight was the night

I got a seat at the sushi bar. 
A great way to see the action up front and personal. 

I went with the Omakase (Chef's Choice)
13 cold dishes
3 hot dishes
Desserts

Here's the rundown:
Cold dishes:
Nobu Tako w/ Jalapeo Sauce - a great way to start things off. 

Toro Tartare - Wow, melts in your mouth goodness. 

Toro, Big Eye Tuna, Abalone, Tamago, Scallop w/ Fresh Pickled Ginger - this was the nigiri part of the meal. Every thing was great. Fresh, clean tasting sushi. Yum!!

Amaebi w/ Uni, Egg Custard & Snapper - the shrimp and Uni was ridiculously good. Egg custard was so creamy and tasty. The anapper had a yuzu sauce that was so good (and I don't usually like yuzu)

Xxx salad, Amberjack,  xxxxx - I didn't get the names on the last 3 cold dishes, but they were all good. 

Hot dishes. 
Grilled Diver Sea Scallop w/ Tomato Sauce & Chive Oil - Scallops were perfectly cooked, but that sauce was AMAZING!!

Wagyu Beef w/ Garlic Butter & Brussels Sprouts. OMG!  Melts in your mouth goodness. PERFECT!!

Ramen w/ Crab and Vinaigrette Broth. A nice dish to finish the meal. 

Dessert:
Sudachi Cream, Merengue, Hazelnut and Black Sesame Ice Cream - a Napoleon (sideways). That sudachi (Japanese Citrus) cream was delicious. Hazelnut provided the crunch. A thin chocolate sheet provided the sweetness. That black sesame ice cream is the BEST ice cream I've had in a long long time. It was creamy, not too sweet and the sesame flavor shines through. I highly recommend it. 

Service was SUPERB!
From start to finish, I was pampered. 

For me, one of my dining dreams come true and it lived up to everything I imagined it to be. 

My Rating:
5 Star Plus!! 
Try it for yourself and decide.

I have never fully appreciated nouveau cuisine. It has always left me a little hungry and a few Benjamins short. LOL 

Our introduction to Cantina Laredo was somewhat inauspicious, since they misplaced our reservations on a busy Friday night.  

We also had the same experience with the hostesses that fellow Yelp'er Teehee wrote about.  But in end, we had a nice evening, with our bill coming in at the low end.  

After the confusion and a five minute wait, we were seated near the patio. It was a nice location and we had the added bonus of observing a pre-wedding family dinner of eighteen. 

Cantina Laredo likes to market itself as serving "modern Mexican food in a sophisticated, vibrant atmosphere. ... with a Mexico City style menu."  I believe it's more Mexican petite nouveau cuisine. 

We started off with a delivery of chips and two types of salsa. The milder version had a nice tomato base. But it was the spicier one, with fire roasted peppers that was the standout. It was complex and so delicious, that you could have eaten it with a spoon. 

Next was their table-side guacamole making called Top Shelf for $9.99. It was an exquisite. Now I make this all the time at home, yet it always seems tastier when someone else is doing it. LOL

Somewhere along the way our white honey sangria was dropped off. It was very good and fairly priced served in large 12 oz flute glass. Nice!

For dinner we decided to share two entrees. One was their Vera Cruz Enchiladas (photo), which was a nice mixture of spinach and chicken for $13.99; and the other was the Carnitas Tacos for $13.79.  The enchiladas had a nice flavor and kick. Both were very good, with the street tacos seeming deceptively small. 

The bill came to about $30 a person including drinks, but before taxes and gratuities. 

So Four Stars, and yes we are Fans of Cantina Laredo. While eating here might not get you a doggie bag for later, you will go home feeling as though you've enjoyed something special.  Remember to make reservations like we did! LOL

Spoon is easily one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. For fine dining, I put them in the top five.
Been here four or five times now just to make sure I was not dreaming. But for sure this is a solid four stars and edging on five. A few subtle enhancements could tip the scale to 5.
Dcor is nice and trendy with several seating areas including a great bar.  Service includes John the top sommelier in the area, usually two hostesses, well-mannered servers and great bartenders. Service is prompt and a drink order results in libations within 5 minutes along with a choice of waters. There is a very ample selection of cocktails and wines by the bottle or glass.
I should mention there is a prompt and courteous valet service as another notch up the service pyramid.
Next the wonderful bread basket with warm selections of biscuits, awesome cornbread and ciabatta or some other artesian bread with sugar or honey butter to complement. We usually need a second basket as a testament.
The short menu is a design to keep choices interesting but not drone on, the ingredients fresh, the food delicious and it changes often enough to keep regulars coming back.
Seafood is my favorite here in appetizer and entre, but the soups and salads are fresh and outstanding as well. A very well enjoyed appetizer choice from the other night we had the 'bacon and eggs' appetizer which was seared pork belly, 5 minute egg (just right) sauted spinach, and hollandaise. Also we had the crispy duck confit which was a fabulous set of ingredients of crispy duck, 3 grain salad, Indian spices, goat cheese, cucumber yogurt, and toasted almonds. Almost sounds like decadence and just about was.
Around the tale we had the shellfish pappardelle; Alaskan black cod; cassoulet which interestingly was comprised of roasted pork, chicken sausage, duck confit, braised cannellini + cranberry beans, herbed bread crumbs, and farm egg. This was 'dryer' version of cassoulet a French peasants, style stew.
We have tried many other appetizers and entrees on our other visits and they all were as wonderful as these I mention here. All had the same complexity of ingredients, preparations, with flavors all overwhelmingly pleasing to the senses.

I gave away our card with 4 stamps at the end of the meal.  THAT'S how sure our group was that none of us would ever return.  

This isn't sushi in the Japanese sense.  These are crazy freakin rolls/inventions that contain some raw fish in, on or around them.  Calling this Japanese is very misleading.  The typical roll on the menu sounds like this:

"Tastes and smells like your bitchy ex-mother in law's 1st semester college sophomore roommate who did the whole lacrosse team on a dare and got Hepatitis C roll:  Baked inside out roll stuffed with eel, cream cheese, bbq sauce, avocado, super super super white tuna, chopped yellowtail and spicy tuna, shishito peppers, scallop, garlic and salmon on top with orgasm, yum yum, and fuck me in the ass sauce on the side."

As you can see, they used the whole "I Love Sushi" concept and took it way over the top.  This could be a potentially fun dinner (as many Yelp reviews can attest) trying all the insanity but there were enough misses to warrant my negativity.  It wasn't fun, but it sure was funny.  

- Sushi rice was off.  Slimy?  Low quality?  I don't know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.  I see a lot of reviews raving about sashimi though.
  
-Speaking of sauce...what's up with drenching sauce all over nigiri?  Several pieces of nigiri came with sauce on top as a default.  We actually had to request it without.  Freshness of the fish was ok.  None of us died afterwards.  

-Pretty sure that was shrimp cocktail drenched in a soy sauce base and topped with scallion advertised as amaebi. 

-1 order of green tea was not green but it might have been due to the lipstick contamination on the side of the cup.  The liquid was a very, very light brown.  The server claimed it was green tea despite my protest.  Magically, the next cup of tea was suddenly very green.  So that's where Dirk Arthur has been performing all this time!!

- I didn't know uni came in so many colors.  The most suspect pieces were left on the plate.  The server didn't even question it.  She just took them away like she knew.

- My native Japanese dinnermates found the tamago presentation to be hilarious.  A tamago house!

At least the unagi was good.  Congratulations on well cooked eel!  Have a good life.

So long Pink's, hello The Wiener's Circle! I was sad to see Pink's go, but the location was never going to work with the jacked up prices and confusion with the names they gave the hot dogs compared to what they are actually called at the original location in California. So, The Wiener's Circle enters in its spot. Will it last? Time will tell! I must admit, I did watch the TV show they had on a while back and found the games they played with the customers (at night they curse at the customers and play crazy ass games... It's intended, expected to all customers and hilarious) funny. I was surprised they opened up in Vegas, but hey it saved me the trip to Chicago for the moment! The original location in Chicago has been in business for over 30 years.

Looking over the menu board, I was surprised at how fair the prices were. The prices here range from about $2-$3 higher depending on the item compared to the Chicago menu. Being in a casino we can expect higher prices, but they weren't too outrageous. I ordered "Wieners in a Blanket" priced at $4.99 for 6. They are made fresh to order. I had my choice of sauce and chose honey mustard. That honey mustard had a real good flavor and paired nicely with the tasty blanketed wieners. They also come 12 to a order, but the 6 was good enough for me. Priced at $4.99 I also ordered "Cheddar Fries" and wow were they good! The fries are fresh cut and come 1 pound per order. The cheese they put on top was very good! Hubby and I split a "Char Polish" priced at $6.99 and came with mustard, relish, onions, pickle, tomato, celery salt and sport peppers. It was pretty good. Next time I would ask for a lighter char, but a decent hot dog with nice toppings. All the burgers and dogs come with those toppings unless you tell them to leave it off. They are happy to customize your order so just ask! If you are in a pinch for time you can phone your order ahead and just pick it up. Aside from lunch and dinner they also serve breakfast and offer Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

Straight out of Cali and family owned. This location was originally built to be a Dunkin' Donuts, but DD never opened. I'm glad Tom's swooped in! You will find a variety of options on the menu here from burgers, tacos, burritos, sandwiches, bacon & eggs, pancakes, steak, pork chops,  fish & chips, salads, smoothies, and Mediterranean & Greek options, and believe it or not much more! They have some pretty good all day specials if you like breakfast.  Seniors 55+ get a free cup of coffee with any breakfast or lunch purchase.

Hubby and I decided to split the "Pastrami Sandwich Combo" priced at $9.59 plus 40 cents for cheese. The combo came with fries and a drink. I also wanted to try the "Zucchini" priced at $3.99 and it came with a side of ranch. The pastrami sandwich was SO good. The bread held up the sandwich well and the mustard and pickles were just right. I know this is something that I will for sure be back for. Good pastrami in Vegas is hard to come by. The fries were excellent. I wasn't actually crazy about the zucchini. The ranch that it came with was a decent size though. They make the onion rings and zucchini from scratch. I want to try the onion rings next time, but will pass on the zucchini again. 

They have a drive-thru if you don't want to eat inside. The burgers are made fresh to order and the steak and chicken is hand trimmed on site. There are a lot of things I want to try here at Tom's so I will be back!

We have been to two Outbacks in the last ten years.

It's wasn't because the food was bad; it was just that the experience wasn't anything special.  

We tried the Happy Hour once up at Mayo Boulevard location and left underwhelmed. Recently however we received two gift cards and decided to give them another try.  

Outback has always reminded me of a slightly more upscale Sizzler, mainly because prices are so low.

Last night the three of us started off with Spinach Artichoke Dip for $7.99, Blooming Onions for $7.29 and the Coconut Shrimp for $7.99.  All these were pretty good, though the star was the Coconut Shrimp.  It was served with an orange marmalade/stone mustard sauce which was interesting, but we had to ask for some cocktail sauce in the end. The Blooming Onions on the other hand are still way too greasy for me and clearly they need to rethink this offering.

For our meal, we tried to order the Pork Chops.  But strangely, they had run out (?) this, so we had to substituted for the 1/2 order of Baby Back Ribs ($13.49). They were very good and had a nice smoky taste.  

We also ordered the Filet with Shrimp for $15.99.  We ordered it medium rare and it came out with a pink center and very tender. But as Yelp'er Jody K pointed out in her review -- the shrimp were tiny and way too salty, with some sort of Cajun/blacken seasoning just dropped on top.

Our last dinner item was actually their Short Ribs Nacho appetizer for $6.99.  It had a nice taste and must be considered an incredible value.

So our tab came to $74.60, including a diet soft drink, a nice Chteau St Michelle Riesling, and one of their special Black Sangria. This also included a discount of 50% off one entree that we found on-line as we waited for our drinks to arrive. LOL

Fuck this place.

Yes, I said it and even after 6 years, I will still say it.

So the girls and I are on a tear it up Vegas weekend. All very cute and sessy gals for the record and all gals who appreciate the less than finer things in life like fake boobied strippers, over-priced drinks and titty bars. 

So we cab it over to the Crazy Horse Too after hearing that THIS was THE place to go. We roll up and instantly get static at the door. You can't come in without a date. Um, okay, well we are a bunch of girls with lots of money to spend? NO! But...? NO!

So we walk a few feet away and regroup while trying to keep the temper of one Drunky MaGoo down to a manageable level since the a-hole of a door guy was especially rude to this one girl in our group. I suggest grabbing a few guys and rollin in with them. I mean who cares, we can ditch them at the door but at least it gets us in. So we latch onto said guys and walk up.

Door guy says, NO!

I say, "You said dates, these are our dates. We are in love, let us in." (Mind you I'm drunk and his anger is amusing me at this point)

Door guy says, "fine you can come in, but that one stays out!" (pointing to my friend)

I say, "Come on, don't be THAT guy, did mama raise you to be THAT guy? She just really wants to see some boobs, surely you can relate."

Apparently he couldn't, but I also think he was suffering from mama abandonment issues and clearly wasn't loved enough as a child, but I digress...

He then decides that none of us should be allowed to come in. Fine, I'd rather not go if my friend is going to not be let in, so just give us our money back and we will go spend it elsewhere, right?

Apparently this is when the poor chap lost all sense of hearing as i became invisible and mute in his eyes.

"Excuse me, I said we'll go. Can you please just give us our money back?"

"Hello?"

"Umm"

"Yo!"

Retard Roy then starts smirking and it is quite clear that the four of us who "got in" will not be getting our money back, even though we technically never even entered the club. 

I then followed up with calls to the establishment the next day that were (to no surprise) never returned. Maybe they are in cahoots with Prime Time Shuttle as their customer service seems to be pretty dead on.

So if you are a girl don't go here. If you are a guy, have at it, but why waste your money on a place that won't let cute girls in who might actually go home with you for free. Just sayin.

The decor for this place was definitely the best part. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f1eeViD_rhRG4-MIFgZsEA

It was a nice day so we got seated on the terrace overlooking the Vegas strip.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=FR6MuipnPqtxwIo9BUVZHA

There are some hotties working up in here.  I kept drooling over one of the waiters.  He was Asian, built, slight scruff, and had tattoos on his right arm.  I wanted to order him and take him to go but he wasn't on the menu :(

Order:  Crab cake, mac and cheese, pomme frites, Croque madame, and shrimp cocktail.  For dessert we ordered the caramel tart and the chocolate terrine.  

Crab cake came served with a remoulade and topped with a frisee salad.  It was actually pretty good, nice and meaty with large chunks of crab, yet it was still crispy and held up.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=p_zZ9eP10crf4OoTMMPw-w

Shrimp Cocktail came with huge jumbo shrimp.  I'm not a big cold shrimp fan so it was just okay for me.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=f0eXikNX8SVFSiTNYpvs2Q

Croque Madame is basically a ham and cheese sandwich topped with an egg.  I wouldn't order it.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=hz67b-rY5NF_D8MfoFhpyw

Mac and Cheese came out awesome looking, but upon further tasting it fell pretty flat.  It needed something to lighten it up and give it some flavor.  My friend squeezed some lemon on it and she said it made it a lot better.  They need to work out that recipe and give it some ooomph!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=xWVNfswLh_diFTC__WeVMg

The chocolate terrine was too dark for me.  I normally enjoy dark chocolate but this was a tad too bitter for me.  It just tasted like straight up cocoa powder.  I wouldn't order it again.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=LeYT8q4sUDeDQrM6-jxIeA

The caramel tart was really good, but the crust was super stiff and thick which normally I like :)  but not in a dessert.  Flavor-wise though, it was the better of the two.  It came with caramel ice cream and candied macadamian nuts and wafers.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HoKXKkW8oC9q8XnjKLulRw?select=Uv9LtnwzyrTIZFS6DEGv3w

The waiter was cordial and accommodating.  He was telling us about life in Vegas because I was thinking about applying to schools there.  Overall, it was a nice relaxing meal.  There were highs and lows but pretty solid still.

Okay, I've been beaten into submission. Yes, you can enjoy a wonderful dining experience in a restaurant that serves only buffet.  Jasmine Tokyo is that place!

Our merry little group included ring leader, buffet master extraordinaire Rand H, along with Robyn N, Mike C and myself.  As noted elsewhere, Jasmine Tokyo is located in the old Claim Jumpers space, near the corner of 70th Street on Shea.  

Both the exterior and interior hasn't changed that much either.  The only difference you'll notice are the huge buffet stations that run down the middle of the restaurant.  On the right side, as you come in, they've re-positioned the bar to the back and added a huge sushi station. I have posted a zillion pictures online.

The food was extraordinary.  It wouldn't have been better, if it was prepared individually in the back.  Everything was fresh and served in smaller, more manageable portions.  This is one of those restaurants (buffets) where you can only take a small amount of food on you plate, because you want the opportunity to try everything.  According to Rand, they have nearly 130 different choices, including eight different gourmet ice creams.  The ice cream by the way, is the only food item that is served to you upon request.

My bill was $11.99 before taxes, less a "20% Yelp Discount" that came to $10.66 including taxes, but before tip,  Our server Mirian F was outstanding and always there refilling our glasses or cleaning our table.  Very nice.

Enjoy!

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

We came here on the Friday of Labor Day weekend. The food was just okay and not very memorable.  There really isn't a Happy Hour menu at Four Peaks.  As it was explained to us, "the drinks are $1.00 off and the food is just the regular prices."   

This is the sort of thing you run into at Craft Brewers that serves food.  A lot of times they confuse their beer sales, as proof of their food success.  It's too bad they don't eat here.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
Very, very noisy and somewhat overly attentive service, particularily from those busing tables.

MENU:
Everything under the sun, but nothing that stands out:
Chicken Rolls $7; Spinach Artichoke Dip $8; Garlic Cheese Beer Bread $6; Cheese Puffs $7; Spanekopita $7; Wings $7; Nachos $7; Quesadilla $7; Thai Hummus $6; Stuffed Poblano $8; Chicken Strips & Fries $8; Pub Fish and Chips $9; Chicken Enchiladas $9; Carne Adovada $10 and various pizzas starting at $13.50

SERVICE:
As noted above, they are overly attentive, including their over the top busers. They seem to excel at taking your plates before you have finished your food. LOL.  No, it's actually not funny.

FOOD:
Four Peaks is a Craft/ Micro brewer http://www.craftbeer.com/breweries/brewery-locator/find-a-us-brewery  who uses the restaurant to sell their beer.  Now, normally that isn't a bad thing. Except the food here is uninspiring at best.  RAM, Rock Bottom, Yard House, Gordon Biersch, BJs all do it quite well, but these are restaurants concepts trying to sell food and beer, in that order.

We tried their  Spanekopita, which they describe as a blend of cheeses, spinach, pine nuts, and dill rolled in phyllo dough and served with marinara sauce. We actually liked this very much and would recommend it.  

On the other hand, their Five Layer Nachos was a big miss. It came out cold and you could peal the cheese off the nacho chips. We added chicken ($2.50) which looked like it came out of a Sysco bag and dropped on top before serving. Ugh.

As you would expect, the beer at Four Peaks is very much Four Stars.  We enjoyed their Oatmeal Stout and their 8th Street Scottish Ale, both of which had low IBUs and 4.8-5.2% alcohol.  

PRICES:
Expect to pay around $40 including tax and tip, depending on how many pints you are going to enjoy.

Bouchon is THE ideal brunch spot after a long night (and/or morning) in Las Vegas. Roll out of bed (or the club) and get yourself over here for some hearty delicious grub! 

Anna R. and I strolled over in the hot sun and arrived around 11 AM. We were told there would be a 25 minute wait. Since we hadn't eaten much the day before, we were practically starving. Luckily they offer seating at the bar, so we gratefully decided to sit there.

We each ordered a Croque Madame -- Anna highly recommended it and the description on the menu made the dish undeniable. I had no other choice. While we eagerly waited, we each enjoyed a refreshing **Hibiscus Cocktail**. Just the right amount of bubbly and lightly sweet for a morning meal. The candied hibiscus at the bottom of the glass was delicious! 

When the **Croque Madame** finally arrived, I wasn't quite ready for what I saw. Beautiful presentation -- a sunny side egg perfectly placed atop a ham and cheese sandwich with thick bread, accompanied by a huge mound of french fries. As I cut this creation open, I happily observed the cheese oozing out from within the folds of the sandwich. I was also very pleased when the egg yolk started running all over the absorbent bread and the rest of the sandwich. HEAVEN. And those fries are extremely addictive and come in a dangerously generous portion.

Service at the bar was excellent. The bartenders checked on us frequently and made sure we were taken care of. My only complaint is that it took around 30 minutes to get our food. The restaurant seemed to be understaffed on Labor Day Sunday, as there were several tables available that were not being used. I was surprised that an establishment of this caliber would not be fully staffed for a holiday when lots of hungry folks would be waiting for a table.

OVERALL: Extremely pleased with the food and service, but I hope they can fully staff all their meals so there aren't such long waits and unallocated tables.

DATE TIP: This is a super cute breakfast/brunch spot with French decor and a warm vibe. Consider taking your date here in the morning after a fun night!

During a 2+ hour layover in PHX, we were headed to La Madeleine to get soup for the wife when we saw the French Onion Soup on the menu here.  Since we can do "La Mad" back home, we said what the heck and stopped in to Zinc.

Now, as everyone knows, French Onion Soup is general served with a "crouton" on top, on which the cheese melts.  But if you're gluten free like the wife, they'll just melt the Gruyre cheese right on the top of the soup-filled crock.  Even though it would probably have been more fun to be able to have the cheese on toasted bread on top (poor wife), she was pleased with the soup.

And speaking of Gruyre...  The truffled Gruyre Zinc Burger was as amazing as it looked.  Five stars right there.

The dessert we chose was some sort of chocolate bread pudding/cake situation, with a side of ice cream with "house made caramel sauce on top".  Eh.... Fairly forgettable (we didn't finish it, even splitting it between the two of us... well, wife could only have the ice cream).  Maybe pastry isn't their strong suit.  

Overall, it's pricy because of the airport premium, and it's trying a bit too hard to be a "bistro" (which for some reason, makes people think they should charge 10% more).  And we didn't have to wait very long for our food, which is necessary in an airport.  I was pretty happy with my burger, "frites", and beer, and there were plugs available between the tables to top off the devices. 

3.86 stars.  Which for an airport dining stop, is pretty darn good.

I've been coming here for a long time since before when it was Xtreme Sushi and through the new ownership change. I must say that I love it the most now that the new owner(s) has/have taken over. The food is a lot more consistent. They've added some new artwork and chairs which made the atmosphere a whole lot nicer and tied everything together more with the decor. Plus they got rid of the awful grimy menus that had seen better days and have added new rolls, my favorite being the Burn Your A** roll. The Yoshi roll from the past is still on the menu so it looks like they've kept some of the more popular rolls. I'm pretty sure that they will accommodate orders from the old menu in case there's something you miss from before. It's a lot of the same people that work here so that's half the battle right there.

The employees are all great and personable. It's very much like the tv show Cheers type atmosphere. Once they get to know you, they will roll out the red carpet, including remembering your name and what you order to make you feel at home. I'm just waiting on my little name plaque at the sushi bar where I always sit. ;)

It's the little things like this to consider when there are so many other options for AYCE sushi in Las Vegas. They really care and appreciate your business here. Therefore, I vote in favor of trying out this local gem.

PS: Why in the hell did someone upload a photo of their dog in their review of this place? I love dogs like the next person but seriously? WTF!?

With so many notable spots for fusion cuisine having popped up in the middle of the desert over the past few years, Japaneiro kicks the door down and slam dunks their excellent menu into the Asian fusion ring with authority. 

Like a lot of the gushing reviews already mention, the chalkboard specials by the entrance is where the gold is.  My advice would be to take a picture of it to look over with your tablemates so you're not like me and getting up to look over the board again and again as if it were on display at a museum.  

I can never say no to foie gras.  If foie gras told me to jump off a bridge, buy it diamond earrings or crash my car through a convenience store, I'd do it.  It was well cooked and those tasty notes of fatty tenderness in a savory sauce were music to my mouth.  I even showed some restraint by offering the last bite to my wife. :P

The Nigerian prawns tasted as impressive as they appeared.  Large and succulent, the truffle butter sauce that it was accompanied by took it to another level.  The green salad offered a nice balance to the whole dish.  I admit I sucked on the shrimp shells to savor the flavor and only felt 3.1% ashamed/embarrassed about it afterwards.  

Our meal luckily managed to carry over to the late happy hour that occurs M-F 10pm-midnight.  Ending the meal with some great small bites like the salmon/tuna/beef tacos and miso black cod lettuce wraps.  The standout was the rock shrimp with its terrifically crispy fry, micro wasabi kick and cream sauce made it an absolute steal for $5.50.  I guess that shows how good these chefs are; they even managed to make rock shrimp interesting!

The lack of description for many of the items caused me to underestimate things like the "European Sea Bass" until I saw it brought to another table near the end of our meal.  The fish looked marvelous with the meat being filleted post-grill and the rest of the carcass twisted up for an interesting look.  I was practically seething with jealousy!  

Lesson learned: everything is awesome and get that the next time.

How much would you pay for a popular & busy buffet with hundreds of quality choices?

   A: $54
   B: $74
   C: $94
   D: Anything ... just let me in the freakin' buffet already

Be prepared to pay any of those prices at Bacchanal Buffet cause this is the current "It" buffet in Vegas. Caesar's Palace can pretty much charge whatever they want. The line is KuRAAAYzeee. We tried to go for dinner Monday before Christmas and the line was 3 1/2 hours long. That's over 200 minutes. We read on Yelp about an "Express" option for $20 extra, but it wasn't available that night. We left.

So, we came back on Christmas Eve for a late lunch. The set-up was different and line much shorter ... because it was a 25-minute line to put your name in for a time slot 3 1/2 - 4 hours later. The registration part is cool if you can wait. I can't. Luckily, the "$20 Express" option was available at that time. Whew! Seriously, I would of paid anything to skip the wait. So, after paying $74 for lunch per person, we headed to ... the next line. It took another 25 minutes to get seated with express. 

      This better be one hell of a buffet!

            It was. 

Here's what I pigged out on for a couple hours ...

Bacchanal Buffet really is a great buffet. It is, of course, overpriced and hardly worth the wait, but if you want quality and choices like this in Vegas you have to either pay for it or have the patience of a very bored saint to stand in line. When you do finally get into Bacchanal, go nuts on the seafood and meats so at least you feel like you're making it worth your money/time.

Follow the yellow brick road to the emerald city and you'll find the golden lion! It's the first thing you see as you enter the main lobby.

This hotel is pretty grand, alright, at least in size. Being the largest hotel and casino in Las Vegas, maybe they feel they don't need to be the best in customer service. Granted, there were over 15,000 people from my company for a huge convention, but they should be equipped to handle as many guests as can fit in the hotel, right? They're just lucky the other 15,000 people went elsewhere.

Need to Spend $?
---------------------
Plenty of restaurants, touristy shops, and of course... massive casino space. Many vehicles for spending dolla bills! The food court gets wicked crowded so I tended to opt for **Blizz**, which is just around the corner and has some healthy juice options (see Blizz review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/blizz-las-vegas?hrid=9pL5NN9VJ-YEqvD0mBJjBA). Also MGM is home to **Cirque Du Soleil's 'Ka'**. Not my favorite Cirque show, but still an interesting one. My favorite Cirque show is the Beatles' 'LOVE', which you can only catch in Las Vegas. (see LOVE review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/cirque-du-soleil-the-beatles-love-las-vegas?hrid=FBWaEYnI5TPtpuBeePDZdA).

Need to Catch Some Sun?
-------------------------------
They have not one, not two, but FOUR pools! If those weren't enough fun for you, they have 3 whirlpools and waterfalls too. It's a 6.5 acre complex of pool action and also includes a quarter mile lazy river. As if you hadn't already consumed enough food and alcohol, they have 5 bars and a full service Cabana grill. You can even get a poolside massage. What?!

Need to Feel Large and In Charge?
----------------------------------------
The **MGM Grand Garden Arena** is there for you! When you're here, you can't help but feel the power and energy of thousands of people in one space. Amazing sound systems and visual effects really enhance the experience. If your company is cool enough to play EDM (electronic dance music) for 5 hours, I can guarantee you'll have a great time here. Arena staff are friendly and helpful, which is a huge contrast compared to much of the hotel.

Need to Dance?
-------------------
Other than partying with my company's EDM fix, you can also hit up **Hakkasan**, one of the hottest nightclubs in Vegas. No wonder this place won the title of "#1 Nightclub in the World" by Playboy Magazine. All the top DJ's spin here, including resident DJ's Tiesto and Calvin Harris. Then of course there's also **Wet Republic** at the ultra pool, complete with the resident DJ's, a newly expanded 95-foot bar (neverending alcohol), a huge LED display, party cabanas/bungalows, and of course tons of people ready to party in their bathing suits. A super fun day party! (see Wet Republic review here - http://www.yelp.com/biz/wet-republic-ultra-pool-las-vegas?hrid=KRe8TmiGoVdgNzKIFNxjgw)

All in all, the MGM Grand has a LOT to offer. Just wish their customer service could keep up.

TIP: Be prepared when asking for extra towels. Staff may sound as shocked as if you had asked for their firstborn child.

DATE TIP: Plenty of venues here for a hot date!

I wish I could give this place 6-stars. I even changed my last meal on earth in my profile to Bacchanal Buffet- it was that good.

Weekends are WAY more expensive because of brunch. We had a little mishap when we called and asked for prices and were given the wrong information. When we told the cashier that- she said that we should have called the buffet and not the hotel. WTF- you work there, right?

Anyways- it was off-season in Vegas, so we only waited about 10-minutes before being seated. Because it was brunch, mimosas were complimentary and we were going to get our money's worth. We 

I seriously could list out all the food that I ate, but that would be a super, super long review. If you want to know- you can see the photos I posted while here. Everything was scrumptious!

A couple of standouts:
- Beef brisket: It was smokey, tender and came in a big slab on your plate. You could break apart the meat with your fork with little effort. This one of my favorite things.

- Eggs Benedict with skirt steak: A small individual portion served in a cast iron skillet. The egg yolk was calling my name from across the restaurant. I ate two without any effort, but had to contain myself before going back for a third. They also have this same dish with fried chicken instead. I wanted beef. The meat is tender and has that nice grilled flavor. Break the egg and it's like a slop of heaven soaking into your bottom piece of English muffin.

Quail egg flatbread: This came lathered with small little over-medium eggs and bacon. The outer crust was crispy and you heard that crunch when you broke it apart or took a bite. It definitely had that wood-brick oven taste, though, I'm not sure how it was cooked. 

I am just going to say that you HAVE to eat here at least once. Like a tourist destination, you should make it a PRIORITY. Screw the bodies exhibit, screw the Grand Canyon- you need to go to Caesar's Palace for their Bacchanal Buffet. It's seriously worth it.

I could tell you all the reasons why you shouldn't go here. But what good of a reviewer would I be if I told the Yelp community to stay away because this place is far too amazing and you're not good enough to take part in it. Every food lover who can appreciate the beauty in a piece of raw fish should have the chance to experience what Kabuto has brought to Las Vegas. But good luck trying, there are only 18 seats in the entire restaurant and once word gets out, it ain't gonna be easy to get in.

Kabuto is part of the Mon Restaurant Family (Monta, Goyemon, Sushi Mon) and another development from restaurant stylist Martin Koleff. Martin is a pioneer for authentic Japanese eateries in Las Vegas. And at the sushi bar, I was rubbing elbows with those who were more than familiar with Martin's talents. He even popped in for a brief hello during my meal. 

I was told the Omakase Course ($80) will not be available until after the grand opening. I went with the Nigiri Course ($48) but you can order a la carte if you wish. I was served a pineapple appertif sake, a small cucumber salad with sea snail, and 10 pieces of the best fish I've ever had. You can state your preferences, but I had the chef choose for me. He was actually quite vocal and very friendly! He was conversational and took the time to explain the origin of each fish. The giant clam and bull eye were a couple of my favorites. And the uni with ikura were to die for. After your 10 pieces are served, you have the option of ordering more nigiri or moving on to your handroll. I ordered an additional saba then finished my meal. If you love mackerel. Order it here. I've now found the best saba in Las Vegas.

Dessert is not taken lightly here either.  In a couple of months, a Japanese pastry shop is to join this family of restaurants right next door. You have a few dessert options with the nigiri course--mochi, ice cream, or the strawberry layered crepe I ordered. Before I started eating, the chef busted out his iPhone and showed me a picture of a bunch of rocks. Confused, he explained to me the pastry chef's vision. She created the pink and white layers to resemble the layers of rock and sandstone at Red Rock. It was touching, and very delicious.

To be quite honest, I've never been to Japan. My understanding of Japanese tradition is a smattering of information from the internet and my Japanese-immigrant friends. But even I can tell that authenticity and quality are of the utmost importance here. From the food to the decor, Kabuto lives and breathes culture. Its unlike any sushi "joint" you've ever visited in town. I won't discourage you from visiting this magnificent addition to the Las Vegas community. But if you walk in expecting a baked roll with cream cheese, please, turn around and leave those 18 seats for the rest of us.

"That's all you need to know, right there, " she said, pointing up behind her head at a framed plackard from local news affiliate CBS 5 Dean's List.  
It was dated from like 1996, or 2003, or something like that, I can't remember, but it wasn't very recent.
"What's that got to do with Customer Service?" I asked, completely perplexed.  
I was just trying to tell her that I've had the same thing happen here twice now in two visits, where she is attending to personal business instead of her customer, ie me.  
"Go on. (waving towards the door)  We been here 17 years.  We don't need YOU."
"You haven't even listened to me.  I'm going to have to tell somebody about this."
"I don't care.  I dont need to listen.  I'M the owner. Go." (she starts pacing back and forth behind the counter, like a caged animal or a person about to get in a fight)
"You're the ONLY owner?  So you're saying your PARENTS work for YOU?  Here, and down the street at BurgerMania?"
"I'm the owner.   I don't care."

A customer standing next to me, who's already received her order but has been waiting the entire time, come to find out, for Mrs. Rude to scoop her an ice cream cone, chimes in with, "I don't think she WANTS to listen to you."

You think?!    


Moments earlier, I'd stood at the counter ready to order, while she was digging red plastic baskets out of one of the trash containers in the lobby.  She saw me, and proceeded to continue what she was doing without acknowledging me, for a few more moments.

Then she comes around the counter  -- no hand washing -- and proceeds to take my order.  
$7.03 ... hand her my card, she swipes it but doesn't press any buttons on the card machine or the cash register.  
~
On her phone laying on the counter, she continues the texting she originally started while taking my order.
~
It's taking forever, and she keeps going back and forth between the credit card reading machine and her phone laying on the counter.
     -a few buttons pressed over here, -a few buttons pressed over there
Finally, I say "Forget it, this is the second time you've done something like this to me recently, and it's not acceptable to me.  I'm taking my business elsewhere."  
"I WAS WAITING FOR THE MACHINE! "  she lamely attempts to defend.
"You were on the phone instead of doing what you should have been doing."
"Go ahead.  I don't care.  That's all you need to know right there."

.......and now you're up to date, back at the top of the review.

WAIT!  I forgot to tell you about what happened last time:

I go for a late lunch, and I'm after a Falafel sandwich, easy enough.
Into a near empty dining room walks your humble narrator, and there's no one waiting in line at all, since it's 1 ish already.  
A single patron is waiting at the counter for his food, engaged in personal conversation with our villain, Mrs Rude.

As I stand patiently behind Chatty Customer Man, Mrs Rude makes no effort to wrap it up or otherwise acknowledge me as a waiting customer, despite having already made indisputable eye contact.  

"Shit, Did they just change subjects?!?" I'm thinking to myself, as I make the Universal Signal for depicting the perfect combination of Hunger and Readiness at a food ordering counter -- I caused my keys to jingle in my hands.  

I literally stood at an empty counter while they chatted for a full minute and a half before I decided to turn and begin walking away.
I didn't rush, since there were a few Mother-May-I-Giant-Steps between me and the exit, and I would have gladly turned back if called upon.

But she let me go, and now I know why.

Mr Gyro doesn't need my business.
Mr Gyro doesn't need your business.

And if Mrs Rude does, in fact, speak on behalf of the entire ownership of Mr Gyro, well, then I guess 

Mr Gyro doesn't even WANT our business.   So be it.

Whoahhhh!!! Now this is what i call a throw down!

Of course, i'm referencing Bobby Flay's inventive cuisine at his southwestern themed restaurant in Caesar's palace, Las Vegas.   

It was our first night and after winning a grip of change form the slots at Caesar's, my friend suggested eating at Mesa Grill for din din.  I wasn't too familiar with the restaurant but when I realized it was Bobby Flay's joint, my interest was certainly piqued.  

Truth be told, i'm not a Flay fanatic by an stretch, but a little star power never hurt anyone IMO.  With that said, there's always the pressing issue of hype over substance which in turn had me proceeding with cautious optimism.  

As we made our way across the bustling casino and stepped into the restaurant, I definitely felt the warmth of the contemporary Latin theme throughout the communal dining space, which was flanked with rich reds and soft golden hues. 

Within moments, the hostess greeted us and proceeded to lead us to our seats.  Our server wasted no time in taking our orders, as well.

In record time, we got our beautifully plated appetizers and entrees. 
Let's just say my doubts melted away with my very first bite! Wow, this food had big, bold flavor and the quality was incredible! 

Here's a rundown of what we had:

Shrimp tamale - Plump, juicy and mouthwatering gulf shrimp in a fresh corn meal that was both rich & flavorful. Outstanding! 

Tuna nachos - Fresh chunks of seasoned ruby red tuna in a sweet & tangy sauce that had a pleasant citrusy finish. The crisp corn tortilla added a nice contrast in texture to this refreshingly vibrant dish! Lip smacking goodness in every bite!

Pork tenderloin - This dish was absolutely phenomenal!!! The meat was like a perfectly cooked filet! It was soft, buttery and rich. Perfectly decadent and oh so flavorful! Honestly, the meat was so tender, i kept asking my friends "Are you sure this is pork?" 

Spice Filet - Buttery, tender and succulent beef filet with a pleasant kick from the house spices! Scrumptious!

Lamb chops - Beautiful crust and perfectly pink inside. Boasting a magnificent charbroiled flavor that was absolutely addicting! Seconds please!

Corn - Fresh cuts of corm kernels with explosive flavor and fantastic texture. This is a side you don't wanna miss!

After consuming all that delicious food, we simply had no additional room for dessert. Besides, wehad our minds set on some chocolate decadence at Max Brenner's afterwards (review forthcoming)

Overall, service was attentive, friendly and fast. The food, of course, was incredible and most importantly, it didn't break the bank either!

Why? Because this birthday boy didn't have to pay...lol

Happy Eats!

The chefs of today may well be the Van Goghs of our time. The care and precision of modern food presentation has made some of the creations on our plates incredible edible works of art.

The Japanese have the art of food presentation imbued in their food culture and they really put their heart and soul into making their food a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.

On my visit to Las Vegas last September, I was starting to feel a bit jaded about eating at the big corporate named restaurants on the strip and sought out a dinner spot more in keeping with being a locals' favourite. A Yelp search threw up Raku and a quick check with local Yelp friend Emily R confirmed that it was one of her favourite spots in town.

I was especially drawn to their kaiseki menu, where they create a unique menu based on the best ingredients available that day. A quick phone call secured  my dinner reservation and as requested on their website, I pre-ordered the kaiseki menu.

My taxi dropped outside Raku, which is located in a non-descipt small off-Strip mall. Any initial fears about the unprepossessing surroundings were soon dispelled by the warm welcome I received on entering the restaurant. There was a general hubbub of conviviality in the restaurant all evening with many customers obviously being happy regulars.

I bagged a seat at my favourite place to sit in a restaurant - at the counter watching the chefs at work. I was able to chat to the main chef all evening, who was very happy to engage and explain things to me about my unfolding gastronomic adventure.

Every dish was a work of art and there were quite a few new flavours for my palate to savour.

1. Mountain potato croquettes in dashi broth

2. Eight mini treasures, including creations such as tofu skin with wasabi and egg with sashimi

3. The house signature homemade silken tofu with salmon roe and homemade green tea salt and soya sauce

4. Fluke sashimi and liver with spring radish and grated onion dipped in ponzu sauce

5. Japanese/Spanish mackarel marinated in yuzu

6. Foie gras/egg custard/summer truffle served in an egg shell

7. Eel with shisho pepper

8. Uni with egg

9. Kobe beef on hot rock flamed with Hennessy XO sauce

10. Mixed tuna over rice

11. Panna cota

As you can see, the list of ingredients is like a who's who of the best ingredients to pass one's lips. Everything was a delight to eat.

 I love the way that Japanese cookery has given exquisite food presentation to the west but in return, the has given them ingredients like foie gras to cook with.

Service was always with a smile all evening.

The final touch of class came at the end of my meal when the chef confessed that normally, they don't do the kaiseki menu for only one person due to the large amount of prep time involved but as I was visiting from London, they made an exception.

Arigato, Aburiya Raku!

In a word, Twist.  

The mere idea of the word is enough to send your token foodie's stomach into a conniption fit of pure desire.  The mere whisper of the word is enough to trigger endless blogging and tweeting due to sheer sweaty-handed anticipation.  The mere realization of the word is enough a road trip all the way to Lost Wages to see what all the fuss is about.  

And so it was done.  Off to the south Las Vegas strip we would go in search of langostine (among other things), prepared in the manner of a man who pretty much put langostine on the map.  

Being the gastronomic simpleton that I am, I decided I couldn't pass up a grand opening invite to the first ever dinner service at Twist by Pierre Gagnaire (December 5, 2009).  But in lieu of a ginormous appetite, what I really should've packed was my brain.  Food this complex, this multi-layered, and this (pardon my crude undertone) "weird", simply can't just be engulfed.  It requires several hours of thinking, ruminating, pondering or whatever-the-hell-it-takes to justify paying $400 a head for arguably one of the fanciest and most thought-out meal you'd ever dream of having this west of the Mississippi.  It's been days since engulfing this meal and I STILL can't wrap my head around it (and my stomach definitely had its work cut out for it too).

Surprisingly, it took nearly 5 hours to complete this marathon of a 6-course tasting menu plus 6 courses of added appetizer supplements (note: every single thing I ate is pictorially posted here).  And don't you dare go on thinking that I'm slow and that 12 courses aren't all that much, because under Pierre Gagniere's roof, that really means like 36 presentations.  Do the math.  

Throughout this marathon dinner complete with cocktails and fine wine, Voss water and a few $8 diet cokes sprinkled in "here and there", I began to realize the perplexity as this:  Pierre Gagnaire is, quite truthfully, an enigma of a man.  Forget that he's Michelin starred-this, iconoclastic-that.  Forget that he practically invented all that we have come to realize is "fusion" cuisine.  And just forget that his so-called eponymous "other" location on Rue. St. Balzac near the Champps Elysees is thought of as being the "3rd best restaurant" in the world by Restaurant Magazine (El Bulli in Spain is the 1st).

Pierre Gagnaire creates an inspiring vision for this type of weird food, which is, not surprisingly, just weirdly delicious.  He's even a lovable weird guy himself, so appropriately charming and entertaining us like a "crazy uncle" might do during his brief cameo at our table.

And as we were appropriately informed by our server David, the whole idea is to "taste and experience" all the ingredients which God put on this earth, which might occasionally occur in 1 singular dish.  This is most evident in the first of 3 presentations of Gagnaire's "Shellfish Royale" - somewhat of an oyster extravaganza with a backdrop of toasted beef gele and shallots, as well as his last presentation of "King Sea Bream", a curiously concoction of a "bonito-shellfish gele" with mozzarella ice cream.  I loved the fact seared scallops aren't even safe from Gagnaire's innovative antics as "black olive gelee" provides a certain Mediterranean setting, but then squab breast and foie gras come in to steal the show.  The end result of these seemingly contradictory flavor combinations and layers is this:  each bite resembles something that you have never ever tasted, with few ways to describe them, save for these vague examples --  My first time eating Pierre Gagnaire cuisine allowed me to taste 5 different representations of the langostine, including the unmistakable "head", allowed me to taste (and like) seafood mixed with cheese mixed with meat, and allowed me to eat something that tasted like the splendor that exists in a tidepool.  

Overall, do I have any idea what this means?  Not on your life.  The only thing I can muster up is that a dinner under Pierre Gagnaire's roof is absolutely positively unlike any other eating experience you will ever have.  Ever.  Go there, and you will see.  The originality of it ensures that you cannot and will not be disappointed.

Of all the Roberto's locations around Vegas this 'berto's location is one of the more consistent. It's located between Home Depot and Capriotti's. I have been coming here on my lunch break and more recently yesterday after a trip to Home Depot. The inside is clean and the guy at the register who has taken my order each time is friendly and actually goes over your order with you to make sure it's right if you customized anything. Like the other locations in town, you can get your chicken taco fix for only 99 cents on Wednesdays with a limit of 12 per person at that price.

The "Adobada Taco" at a cost of $2.75 each was good. It had marinated pork, guacamole and fresh salsa on it. There was meat falling out of the taco because they weren't stingy with the fillings. One thing I love here is the "Rolled Tacos" that come in different options. You can choose chicken, beef, sour ream, guacamole or just cheese. I don't like their guacamole that much, so I just got the rolled tacos (beef) with cheese. The rolled tacos with cheese cost $2.35 and are easily a meal by itself for me! So darn cheap and it tastes good. I love the "Carne Asada Fries" here, but only get them when I have someone to share with because it's such a huge portion. The asada fries cost $8.10 which is a great price for the size of it. We are talking fries, beans, sour cream, salsa, cheese and a pile of carne asada. It does come with guacamole, but I asked that it be left off. The menu here has many options for everyone. 

Inside there are plenty of tables and a small salsa and veggie bar. It has been filled with customers when I have been here, so I am going to start calling my lunch order in to avoid the wait time. If you are on a time crunch and it's Wednesday, calling in your order is smart as well because more people are there that day loading up on the 99 cent chicken tacos.

Exhilarating pre fixe menu that showcases the chef's masterful culinary skills!

Located in the beautiful themed garden of the Bellagio, the restaurant's sleek blond wood interior was both intimate and inviting.  Set against soft lighting, the dining space was conducive to a festive and celebratory evening with good friends and at first glance of the tasting menu, i was looking forward to the exciting evening ahead. 

The Breads: Warm sourdough & honey wheat rolls came out nice & hot with a side of lightly salted soft butter. The sourdough was my personal favorite with its nice buttery crust and warm chewy center.

Our party of four didn't need much coaxing as we almost instantly decided on the all inclusive chef's tasting menu with wine pairings, which included the famous lobster pot pie!  

Tuna Tartare - Fresh plump ruby red tuna prepared table side with bright vibrant colors that was definitely a sight to see!  The ancho chili and fresh mint pumped up the volume by adding a tangy zing to this remarkable dish and the pine nuts added a pleasant rustic contrast of texture and rounded out the flavor profiles nicely!

Caviar Parfait - Magnificent! Served atop airy light creme fraiche and a crisp potato cake, each bite was magical! The bubbly paired perfectly with this exquisitely enjoyable dish!

Lobster Pot Pie - Outstanding! I was anxiously anticipating this dish and i am happy to admit that it did not disappoint! As soon as the server carved away the warm golden crust, the sweet smell of buttery lobster wafted into the air and i was mesmerized! As i glanced down into my ramekin, i could see chunks of juicy lobster bathed in brandied lobster cream and it made my mouth instantly water!  I simply love pot pie and lobster has always been on my guilty pleasure list, so the combination for me was a match made in foodie heaven! 

American Kobe Rib Eye - Perfection! The kobe beef was exceptionally moist, tender and buttery! Oh, and yes, it melted in my mouth! Hot dayam, what i'd give to sink my teeth into this luscious piece of premium meat again! Let's not forget about the sides! The butter poached porcini was rich and flavorful while the creamed corn was decadence in every bite!

The tasting menu ended with several small dessert items that showcased the chef's whimsical approach to sweets including a magnificent root beer float, a cookie served with hot mulled apple cider, chocolate bon bons, chocolate chip cookies and a glazed chocolate brownie with cocoa nib ice cream & spiced pecans. 

In a few words, it was literally death by chocolate!!!....and oh what a way to die!

The wine pairings were 100% spot on compliments to our meals. With that said, our server was nothing short of professional, helpful, and friendly.  It was great having friendly conversation with everyone but still enjoy the formalities of fine dining. 

What more could a birthday boy ask for?

FINALLY!! I've been waiting for this location to open f-o-r-e-v-e-r! With the location on the Strip closing, it couldn't have come at a better time. Walking in I saw the usual lines for adobada, asada, etc. You have to pay attention to the signs so you know what line to get in. I only ever get adobada, so I usually go straight to that line and hubby usually goes straight to the asada line. Sometimes I do feel like an asada taco, so hubby just gets mine when he gets his and that saves time and my food from getting cold. This last visit the line wasn't bad at all and the place had a good amount of heads in it. I only waited maybe 5 minutes in the adobada line and hubby waited less than that in his line. The wait time will no doubt change depending on the day at time, but the wait is worth it. I had an "Adobada Taco" ($2) and an "Adobada Mulas" ($4, I requested mine to me made on flour tortillas) and they were both so good! I asked for them both with pineapple and the dude hooked me up with a fair amount. The adobada has such great flavor and is very addicting! The taste just keeps you wanting more. They do have seating inside, but I noticed they are working on the other part of the building, so maybe they will add more seating there?? That will be good for those who like to eat inside, but a lot of people, myself included, just eat at our cars. They offer a variety of meats including asada, adobada, lengua, sesos, buche, tripa, suadero and chorizo. You can get any of these meats in a taco, mulas, tostadas, vampiro, sopes and even over fries. This place is absolutely legit when it comes to tacos and I'll be a regular for sure!

An incredible steakhouse.   Outstanding food.  Solid wine list.  Excellent service.  Stellar value.

(Sorry this review is long, there is a lot to share).

It's in Luxor.  Stop laughing.  Once you get past the lobby (hey, you can't hide the fact you're in a giant pyramid), renovations have made the casino as contemporary as any.  

Five years and 120+ visits;  Tender continues to impress.  Innovation keeps the menu exciting.  Rapidly changing seasonal specials showoff the chef's commitment to freshness.  

For summer, the heirloom tomato salad with over a dozen varieties of fresh, vine ripened tomatoes dressed in olive oil and sea salt with micro basil and slices of uber fresh, milky mozzarella just incredible.  A full blown tomato party in your mouth.  The salad is large enough for two.

For bison month, a charred bison carpaccio topped with a spicy aioli, arugula salad with roasted peppers and sweet corn finished with a touch of sea salt.  Incredible!

Other killer starters, the charcuterie of game and deli meats (bresaola, finochietta, wild boar sausage, pork coppa, lamb prosciutto and antelope pastrami) with cornisons, assortment of olives and mustard, an excellent take on the classic.  The chilled salmon tasting, a true standout; hot apple wood smoked salmon topped with black truffle "caviar" on a bed of pesto, edamame, and sea asparagus.  Wow!  An explosion of flavors, oily salmon, earthy truffle, herbaceous basil, the back taste of the pine nuts, the crunch and oceanic flavor of the sea asparagus.  Perfect.

Outstanding steaks at all quality and price ranges.  The Bison ribeye is very hard to pass.  Deep meaty flavor, low fat.  JAPANESE KOBE A5 WAGYU.  The real deal.  $95 / 8oz.  I doubted it, I saw it, I tried it.  Yes, yes, yes.  Extremely well trimmed.  Request it cooked below rare.  It's an ethereal experience, seared goodness on the outside, chilled, tender with melting fat on the inside.

Something different?  Wild game platter remains excellent.  Berkshire kurabuta pork chop (order this medium) near perfect heritage pork flavor.  Sweet, tender, and porky!  Finally the bison osso buco; tender perfectly braised, deeply flavored bison on a bed of enriched mashed potato and tangy bbq onions.  Incredible balance.  The marrow is a special treat.

Tip:  check out the sides.  Roasted bone marrow glazed with a veal demi an insane value at $5, Hudson foie for $10.  Add it to any steak or have it alone with some bread as a starter.

Sure, missteps do happen but are always corrected with no fuss.

For the absolute best service on a casual night out, eat at the bar.  Friendly, very knowledgeable bar staff who aim to please.  The music in the lounge a little loud, but it keeps the energy up.

Great wine program with the lowest markup on the Strip.  Huge by the glass pours.  Wines by the bottle near retail.  Check out the Captains' List for clearance wines below retail.

Snub the Luxor all you want, you will be missing a great restaurant.

I wanted to try a new place for dinner and am glad we found this one. Here It's worth it for just the drinks alone! This place used to be a Pizza Hut, but once you step inside you forget about all of that. Inside was very clean and they offer plenty of seating. You walk up to the counter to place your order and then they give you a number to place on your table. When your food is ready it is brought out to you. Our food didn't all come at the same time which seemed odd. The girl who took the order was very nice and offered me samples of their freshly made drinks. 

Watermelon Agua Fresca ($2.50) - Very tasty and refreshing. I couldn't put it down! They have many other flavors just ask for a sample to see which you'd like. 

Mini Taco Al Pastor ($2) - This has onions cilantro, salsa and a fair amount of meat. I thought the tortilla tasted good and the taco was decent. Not as good as some of the street vendors I have been to, but decent for the price and nice flavor. They also have tacos similar to "Los Tacos' that are $4.50 each, but come with sour cream, rice, rice, beans, cheese, salsa and avocado.

Rice and Beans ($2) - Sadly, they were out of rice. I said that it was ok and I'd just try the beans. They apologized and gave us an extra side of beans instead. I was hoping with a place called Frijoles, that they would have amazing beans. I just thought they were ok. They weren't bad. Just nothing wow and could have used more seasoning or something.

Chips and Guacamole ($3) - I love that they use fresh avocados here! The guac tasted great, but could have used a bit more salt. The chips were very good.

Cheese Quesadilla ($2.50) - Simple yet tasty from the first bite. The tortilla tasted good and it wasn't loaded with cheese, but what was there could be tasted and it was good. Simple can be very good sometimes! 

I'm glad we tried this place and look forward to coming back and trying more. The only downside, they have no salsa bar. They need a salsa bar!

It is ALL about the Aromatherapy Scrub & Massage at Imperial Health Spa. But brace yourself, bitches. There's no gentle, relaxing touch involved so if that's your thing, don't even bother reading any more of my review. The hearts and rainbows and jumping unicorns and rose petals are just not the type of things that transpire over at the Korean Spa. So if you're a bad ass like me and you're from the school that whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, do feel free to read on... 

They will scrub you within an inch of your life and elbow the shit out of knots in your back but it's sooo worth it! No pain no gain baby! Brunhilda from Ryan and Sean's Not So Excellent Adventure has nothing on the chicks that work here! If you don't get that reference, don't feel bad. It's just some obscure, cheesy movie that I happen to have acted in so I wouldn't expect you to have any idea what I'm talking about. And if you do get it... I'm impressed! Extra cool points in my book for you!

Come earlier than your appointment time. Like half an hour early minimum. They want you to be human soup with the rest of the nudists that enjoy the facilities here pre-scrub/massage. Oh and jump into that steam room for a few too if you can handle it. I can't take it too long though. I get wayyy too hot! *insert cute boys sending me compliments like "Yeah, that's right, you ARE way too hot!" here*

My suggestion is to come here before an airbrush tanning session. Get all that dead skin off your body and then head over to see Terry over at Bronzed. But actually the ideal thing is to do this the day or two before because they put a bunch of hardcore moisturizer/oil on you which is not good to have on your skin before an airbrush tanning session because it will make it so the tanner doesn't stick and defeat the whole purpose of your doing the scrub in the first place.

They do just about everything that can be done to pamper you here during this treatment. And there are two different options. One's $125 and the other is $150. Only difference between the two is that one is longer than the other. The Aromatherapy Scrub and Massage appointment goes as follows:

Your scrubber/massage lady comes and finds you in the steam room or jacuzzi. You go back with her and get completely nude. She scrubs the hell out of you as you contemplate your escape route and/or start thinking of a way you can start climbing the ceiling. She shows you all the nasty skin she has taken off of you and you're like, "Wow! I guess I definitely needed this! I swear I don't live in a cardboard box under a freeway overpass!" Then she washes you with this pineapple smelling soap and one of those poof things. This is one of my favorite parts of the treatment because the scent is very intense and smells amazing! After that they wash your hair for you and condition it while giving you a bit of a head massage. Then they seat you up and give you some soap for your face and have you go get in the shower while they clean up all your dead skin off the table so everything is nice and clean for the massage portion that is coming up next. After your shower, they hand you a towel and have you lay down on the table face down. Then they dry you off some more and begin the massage. After that they flip you over and massage a little more, then put a mask on your face. While the mask is drying, they massage your neck and shoulders. Then they peel the mask off and that's the end of your aromatherapy scrub and massage treatment. 

All in all it is a great experience that I recommend and partake in often. So if you see me running around naked 'round these parts, don't be surprised. And sorry dudes... it's not co-ed in the naked area although the men do have their own birthday suit section at this spa. No clue what goes on back there so you're on your own there, buddy. To all the ladies out there... Maybe say hi or something if you see me... Or not. Cuz that like might be awkward since we're like naked and stuff. I dunno... I'm pretty easygoing so if you don't mind, I won't. Your call either way, fellow yelpers. 

All I know is this... You will leave here glowing and looking fantastic, feeling like a new woman! This place is the bomb diggity and the sheer number of checkins I have listed above should speak volumes about how much I love this place!

***There are some great things about Guy Savoy like the lobster with beets in cold steam, the great service, and the nice dining room, but like other Las Vegas restaurants, it is very overpriced***

Guy Savoy definitely reminds me of Joel Robuchon.  They both feature formal fine dining French cuisine from esteemed chefs and very expensive tasting menus and a la carte items as well as lavish bread carts and dessert trolleys.  The restaurants are quite different though.  Savoy has a minimalist and modern decor.  It feels much more elegant, comfortable and less distracting than the over-the-top and all over the place elegant decor at Robuchon.  Savoy also features much more personable service that is still professional and polite.

In terms of the food, it is hard for me to compare Savoy to Robuchon because I had a few a la carte items at Savoy while I had a tasting menu with many, many courses at Robuchon.  In terms of bread, Robuchon is better.  Both feature a wide variety of bread, but I felt Robuchon's bread had better textures as well as much more distinct flavors (Robuchon's bread was warmer and felt fresher too).

Robuchon's dessert trolley is significantly better than the one at Savoy.  Robuchon's lavish dessert trolley is an extravagant and over-the-top movable feast of sweets while Savoy is more of a small selection sweets on a nice tableside cart.  Variety is not the only reason why Robuchon is better.  The sweet treats at Robuchon have much better (and more interesting) flavors.

In terms of the food, I had really good things at Robuchon and Savoy but nothing as good as what I have had at Bay Area fine dining spots like The French Laundry, Cyrus or Manresa.

There were bright spots.  I really liked the lobster and jumbo lump crab with beets and cold steam from seaweed water.  There were great beet cups filled with creamy beet mousse and soft, fresh and moist crab.  There was also lobster carpaccio that was topped with minced golden beets; the beets had a great sweet flavor that was reminiscent of fruit.  There was also warm and nicely cooked lobster meat--fresh, moist and soft.

There was even puff pastry topped with beet ribbons.  The finishing touch was great seaweed aroma from the cold steam that enveloped the food (cool effect and great fragrance).

I also liked the mushroom brioche topped with black truffle butter.  The brioche was warm, buttery, crispy, and flaky (and the black truffle flavor was very prominent).  The accompanying black truffle and artichoke soup was just okay.

The amuse of foie gras with brioche was good--rich, creamy and a great foie gras flavor.  The pumpkin soup amuse was good though surprisingly thin.

Other courses were not as good.  The crab tart was just soggy and boring and I probably should have ordered the veal three ways as my entree.  They present the veal chop before they slice it and it was very nicely cooked--a great golden brown sear.

My entree was a variety of game birds cooked in a pot.  The cooking in the pot yielded tender and moist meat, but there were no contrasts in textures so the meats were a little uninteresting.  I thought the pheasant was good.  I thought the squab was good too, but I prefer it when they achieve a crispy skin on squab.

I was not a fan of the Mallard duck.  Like the squab, there was no crispy skin.  The flavor of the duck was very strong--interesting but not my favorite flavor.  The texture was off-putting.  The texture of the duck meat was squishy and a tad rubbery; it ended up being similar to the unique texture of squab.

The garnishes were good though a tad rustic for such a fine dining spot.  There was some good sweet and sour cabbage and wild mushrooms.  There was also a nicely cooked, buttery and smooth foie gras.

While the savory courses were a mix of good and average, I was not a fan of Savoy's desserts.  I ordered the coconut six ways and while I really liked the light and crispy coconut flakes and tapioca, I did not like the rest of the dish.  It was like various bland ingredients in water.

The mignardises from the trolley were okay; the pate de fruit was kind of hard and overly sugared.  The dark chocolate ice cream was rich and good though and I liked the flavor of the earl grey sorbet with English cream and black pepper. 

As mentioned, service was good; prices were too high, but that is often the case with high-end Vegas restaurants.

I did not love Robuchon, but I preferred it to Savoy.  There were some nice things about Savoy, but the food is just too expensive for just so many okay dishes.  I think your money would be much better spent on a dinner at an upscale Bay Area spot like Manresa.  If you do want a nice dinner in Vegas, I recommend the much more price friendly Picasso or L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (seasonal tasting menu).

Like most Las Vegas hotels on The Strip, Caesars Palace offers both free valet and self parking.

Craving pizza, we stopped here for dinner. Inside they have a decent amount of seating, though some of the seating is a bit too close to the next table. We seated ourselves and our server came over a few minutes later to greet us. There were no other customers when we arrived (some came in later) and it seemed odd that no employees were noticeable until the server came from the back. I ordered the "Mozzarella Sticks" priced at $6 to start. About 15 minutes later our server came back to take our main order (no mozzarella sticks in sight) and hubby and I shared a medium "Chicago Style Pizza" with 1/2 pepperoni & sausage and 1/2 garlic & ricotta. The pizza was priced at $19.65 and even for a medium pizza, it was hearty. I asked the server about the mozzarella sticks and she said they should be right out. Another 10 minutes later they arrived! I don't know what went into preparing them, but they took damn long enough! I thought the sticks were very good. Not worth what we waited, but good. The server did warn us that the pizza would take about 30 minutes. Lie! An hour later the pizza came out. I felt like family at this point I mean we had been there so long! The crust on the pizza was perfect and the sauce tasted great, Unfortunately, the garlic and ricotta were visible yet the flavor of them barely stood out at all. I might give the deep dish another try with different toppings in the future since the crust and sauce were good, but with some of the toppings I chose this time lacking in flavor (you should be able to taste fresh garlic!) and how long it took for service, I can't see coming back anytime right away. 

They charge $3 for delivery according to their menu. Mon - Fri they have a pizza and salad buffet for $7.95 (dine-in only) from 10am - 2pm.

Prior to dining, my only familiarity with the Katsuya name was from TMZ.  If I were making half a milly per TV episode, this would be in my regular dining rotation too!  The menu's prices are on par with Nobu, Sushi Roku or Blue Ribbon.  

At least those restaurants offer some kind of a chic atmosphere.  Katsuya felt like an upscale diner with a sushi bar plunked in the middle.  The bright lighting, noise from the casino and the constant yelling of "Irashaimase!" over and over and over by employees made this a decisively unsexy spot.  I can't imagine tourists would want this kind of setting for a pricey sushi meal on the strip.  If a booth at Nobu's outpost at Caesars Palace is Kate Upton, it's kind of Rosie O'Donnell here.  Power lunches or corporate dinners? Yes.  Anniversary dinners or bachelorette parties? No!  

For those reasons, my wife and I chose to sit at the bar since the people working there looked like they were having a good time.  All them were super nice and knowledgeable of all things Katsuya. They also made some awesome cocktails to boot.  I loved the "Sahara Cooler" which consisted of Ketel One Oranje vodka, Aperol, passion-fruit pure, fresh lime juice, and Stiegl Radler Grapefruit beer.  That was instant refreshment.  One of the bartenders, whose name escapes me but I remember being a Chargers/Eagles fan, created a wonderful version of a prickly pear cocktail for my wife. 

The plan was to not order items we could get at local, off the strip Japanese spots like Kyara or Raku.  So $8 edamame (shockingly saw lots of people order this), anything from the robata grill ($12 for asparagus with no bacon) and $11 karaage were out of the question.  

Want to know what was?  Rare Wagyu filet with foie gras on top!  So tender and soooo decadent, it was like a story I never wanted to end.  The plum wine sauce reduction really added a nice balance.  Lobster and truffle chawanmushi was another dish I don't see everyday.  Despite the small portion being steamed in a Japanese tea cup, I thought it tasted great and would probably order it again.  Dig in from the bottom for maximum truffle taste.

I thought the Wagyu sashimi seared with hot oil and topped with chives and ginger was very good too.  The oil they used made it taste more like a Chinese dish which was a nice little changeup from the other beef dish.  Seared tuna with Japanese salsa was equally as good.  The high quality of the fish was easy to see as well as taste.

My wife was still hungry and had her eye on the "Wafu Carbonara" which was simply described as "slow-cooked bacon, soy reduction, and soft poached egg".  I tried to talk her out of it since she makes a great version of this dish at home.  Unsurprisingly, I lost that battle.  One of the bartenders assured us this was something worth having and she was right.  The huge chunks of pork belly with bonito flakes and sauce/egg mix just oozing over the ramen noodles was a hearty dish and a nice ending to the meal.

I stopped in to pick up some dinner to-go. After walking in, hubby and I were very confused since they have no signs saying to seat yourself or anything pointing you to a place for to-go orders. The most confusing part was no employees in sight and no menu board?!?! There wasn't anybody else eating inside either, so I had to wonder if this place was really open for business or not. After a couple minutes a woman came out and asked asked if were were eating in or taking out, so I told her we wanted to place a order to-go. She handed us menus and we sat and looked it over. After only a minute she came back to take our order, but I told her we we hadn't been here before and needed a little extra time to look over the menu. She then comes back I swear less than a minute later and asked if we were ready. Ugh. I felt rushed which made no sense since there were no other customers. I just went ahead and ordered some things that caught my eye.

Bean and Cheese Pupusas ($1.95) - The price was great, but not the taste. I wish I tasted more beans and cheese inside instead of the pasty corn flavor this one had. 

Al Pastor Taco ($1.95) - I enjoyed the taco and they were generous with the fillings, but it tasted more like chicken and certainly doesn't stand up against some of the other al pastor around town. 

Fried Plantains ($2.50) - Yum! This was the best part! I really enjoyed the nice sweet flavor.

The lady who helped us was friendly, but pushy about getting our order taken. I really feel they need to put a menu board up and some signage showing customers if they should seat themselves etc. Price was on point and the plantains were good, but everything else was a miss for me.

HAPPY HOUR REVIEW:

Warning! Going to Sam Fox Restaurants for Happy Hour after a movie can be habit forming. 

We have heard many good things about this Italian farmhouse concept, but we were little hesitant given that we found the lunch at North in Kierland just okay.  Our caution however, was unwarranted.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
We arrived around four-thirty and the parking lot was mostly empty. Were they open we thought? But as we approached the front door, it was opened by a hostess and we were invited in. Nice.  

We said we had come for the Happy Hour and were escorted not to the bar, but to some tables along the back wall. We were given menus, both Dinner and HH and heard a brief explanation of the fish special. Very cozy and very nice. I have taken a few photos of the inside of the restaurant.  The mood is upscale and dare I say 'hip".

MENU:
Like other Fox places, the HH menu is more of a starting point of samplers. For instances, if you like HH serving of freshly made meatballs and spaghetti, then maybe you'll like the lager dinner serving.

The HH menu has about a dozen items, mostly in the $5.00 - $8.00 range.  They have Caesar Salad, Arancini, Pizza of the Day $8, Chef's Board of meats and cheese $10, Zucca chips $3.  Two holdovers from other restaurants are the Castelvetrano Olives $3 and Spiced Nuts $2. These two look similar to the Olive & Ivy's offering. http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-and-ivy-scottsdale#hrid:XB-E39WNviGs1MkkQ4XIxw

As you would expect, they also have all beers and well drinks priced at $4.00 to $5.00.  But what we found special, are all their wines marked at 50% off.  They will also re-cork it for you to go.

Here are links to the menus:

http://www.foxrc.com/frcwp/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/North_40th_Dinner_Menu2.pdf

SERVICE:
We found the service to be very professional.  Yes, the water glasses were refilled on a timely basis, but also the wait staff comes by and chats with you about your food and answers any questions you have very knowledgeably.  We actually got into a very detailed discussion on Washington State wines and Oregon Pinots with our server Vail.

FOOD:
We started off by ordering a Washington State Chardonnay, but found they didn't have any chilled.  We then opted instead for the Snoqualmie Riesling, which was somewhat sweet, with a hint of cherries.

We tried the HH Caesar Salad for $5.00 and the HH Spaghetti, also for $5.00. The salad came with some of the most delicious croutons that had a smokey taste we have ever had.  A definite must.  The spaghetti was equally interesting and flavorful.  The meatballs must be cooked in a marinara, and has a complexed layering taste which was different than the pasta sauce, which has a hint of fennel. Wow.

Next we ordered the Margherita Pizza ($11.00) off the Dinner menu, see photos. It was very good but we found the cheese slipped off when you bit into a wedge. 

For dessert, we each ordered the Gelato scoop for $3.00 and the Tiramisu for $6.00, both off the dinner menu.  I've taken pictures of the Titamisu.  It came in a glass ramekin with an amazing amount of delicious mascarpone cheese and flavorful Kahlua.

PRICES:
Our petite Happy Hour dinner of six items, ran us $41.50 before taxes and gratuities.  It also included the bottle ($23.00, 50% off) of Riesling, which our wonderful server Vail re-corked for us. As we left, the parking lot was full with a dozen cars waiting to be parked.

Enjoy!

I didn't have such a great experience at the Sugar Factory inside the Paris, so when I found out this is where we would be meeting up for a birthday dinner, I was a bit bummed. I hadn't been to this newer location at Town Square though and only had dessert and drinks at the Paris location, so trying actual food from Sugar Factory I had a open mind for. Walking in they have candy and lollipops for sale, but they have price tags on them that are way overpriced. I couldn't ever see spending what they are charging for a sucker that spins. 

Our server, Manolo was great. He checked on us often and seemed genuine, not pushy trying to get us to order apps, drinks, merchandise, etc. He just was the type of server you wish you always had when eating out. The place was packed inside and even the tables outside the restaurant were filled, but the servers did a great job at taking care of everybody. 

I ordered a "S'mores Martini" priced at $14 and was a bit disappointed. Sure it looked cute and tasted alright, but it tasted more like candy than anything I would catch a buzz off. My hubby's Reese's drink was much more tasty. Priced also at $14 I had a "Garbage Bowl Salad" for dinner and substituted the vinaigrette that comes on it for ranch dressing. The salad had lettuce, pepperoni, salami, cucumbers, tomato, avocado, mozzarella and provolone. The menu said it also came with croutons, but what a bummer they weren't on the salad! There was enough other stuff so it worked out. The salad was really good. I liked the crisp, fresh lettuce and the amount of ripe delicious avocados they put in it. The bottom was filled with salami and pepperoni as well. I kept eating and eating and still there was salad left! 

The key with Sugar Factory is to come here when it's HH or with some type of deal/coupon. The drinks and much of the menu is just way too overpriced and coming here and paying full price will more than likely leave not only a dent in your wallet, but will probably leave you feeling like not ever coming back. Currently there is a yelp check-in offer for $15 that gets you $25 (not valid Fridays & Saturdays) and they have a groupon right now for this location where you can pick from a few different deals depending on the size of your party. Sugar Factory also has different deals depending on the day. The HH runs Mon - Fri from 3 pm - 6 pm where you can get BOGO cocktails and half off appetizers, pizzas and burgers. If you are coming here to drink anyway then coming here when it's better priced makes more sense.

P.S. The cel reception in here is no good! I had no signal most of my visit and when I did it was just 1 bar. Everyone at my table had this same issue.

P.S.S. The music is TOO LOUD! It's hard to have a conversation with people sitting next to you because the music is annoyingly loud.

After two visits in the last six months, I remain totally unaware of their a la carte offerings.  It's like a small bolt of electricity triggers my brain to point at the picture of the AYCE deal (now $25) and tell the server in what feels like slow motion to say "I'll......have......this.".  This incurable auto reaction would even prompt me to order AYCE KBBQ if I saw it on Denny's menu. 

With quite a few popular restaurants in this plaza now, Jin Mee feels like a forgotten place.  The space is big and looks like it could easily fit a crowd of 100+.  I wonder if those banquet tables to the rear of the restaurant ever get used anymore. 

It doesn't take a lot for me to enjoy spots like this.  As long as there's pork belly, bulgogi, the other usual offerings and they are of reasonable freshness, I am a happy man.  But there are a few things that make this place a standout.  My wife loooooves the spicy marinated raw crab.  I am not sure if anywhere else offers this but it's pretty awesome.  You gotta get all barbaric with it and just break the shells in your mouth to get those glorious slithers of spicy crab. 

Then they bring out a ton of other dishes before the meat comes out.  You get a large plate of salad, a bowl of steamed egg, a hearty tofu soup with beans and potato, and then 8 dishes of banchan.  A very impressive Korean feast indeed!!  I look at it all as a clever trap.  If customers stuff their faces with this, they'll eat less meat.  Everything I mentioned above probably costs them less than $4 in ingredients.  All tasty and worth sampling for sure, but keep your eyes on the prize!  Kind of like the salad bar at Texas de Brazil.  Trap!!!!

The owner, Chu, was there during my last visit.  He said he was a good golfer and gave me his card saying we should golf sometime.  I hit my friend with a golf ball in the leg after a ridiculous slice 30 feet away the last time I golfed and dutifully informed Chu of this.  He decided to quickly change the subject by offering some grilled shrimp on the house.  That's only on the more expensive AYCE package that includes choices of several kinds of seafood and ribeye.  The shrimp were delicious and unusually sweet.  Nice guy.

The table grills were decently ventilated meaning I wasn't wearing full on BBQ cologne afterwards.  I am a fan!

She sells seashells by the seashore
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#72KODOc9wIrLiJCmEbU6Ew

30% off via Tix4Tonight deal of $2/person

Living out our inner Katniss & going through our "Hunger Pains", we needed something yummy to fill our tummies.  Not being in the mood for a burger or whatever fried crap available, we thought Thai food sounded good.

SEA:The Thai Experience is located back in the boonies of Bally's Hotel & Casino.  The cuisines served are both Thai & Vietnamese.  The ambiance was rather nice, with the center of the restaurant having a fountain pool with a Buddha statue, surrounded by wood tables.  On the periphery, standard tables to dine at, with a private area for large parties.

Being Vegas, we knew we shouldn't expect prices similar to the local haunts back home.  I was almost taken aback as to how much things were, but with 30% off, it helped sweeten the sour taste of overpriced food.

Fried calamari($12)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#GfhhEFZn2GCeSDFfXlbYiA
Lightly breaded calamari, fried to a nice texture, accompanied with sweet chili sauce.  Nice & chewy, these were really good.  I'm a big squid fan, and I enjoyed each fried piece from the sea.  

Pad Thai, with beef ($18)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#yUTLbpFitScqvHh75IGvBQ
Sweet, sour & filling, the pad thai had fair portions & was as good as any that I've had dining at my favorites.  

Honey walnut shrimp fried rice ($18)-
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sea-the-thai-experience-las-vegas#dUTI_D4Rxdqi6-iHIxXNUA
Winna, winna!  The highlight of our meal, the honey walnut shrimp fried rice  made me want to pop a wheelie in a Tuk-Tuk down Las Vegas Blvd.  Crunchy walnuts & bell peppers, a pleasing amount of deveined shrimp with a medley of vegetables  wok-tossed with seasoned rice.  The portions were great, and I relished this dish, since we only had appetizers for dinner the night before.  

Service was on the slow side.  The place wasn't too busy when we arrived, so I didn't understand why our food took longer than necessary.  Our drinks were kept filled & we had a nice meal, enjoying Thai music & the sound of falling water from the Buddha fountain.  

In summation, we had a nice Thai lunch at SEA:The Thai Experience.  Would I dine here w/o the Tix4Tonight deal?  Heck no!  Way too expensive for stuff that's 3 times more costly than restaurants I usually go to.  However, the food was good & we were happy.  Furthermore, the ambiance was a nice respite from the frenzy of the Strip.

Recommend with the 30% off Tix4Tonight deal

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 52/100

Stayed in this hotel with my bf for the first time a few weeks ago and absolutely LOVED IT!

I had never heard of THEhotel at Mandalay Bay before. Apparently it's the nicer of the two towers at Mandalay Bay, and consists entirely of suite-style hotel rooms. 

My bf had booked our stay about four months in advance through Expedia, and he only paid around $110 per night for a HUGE suite for the two of us! It was amazing and you definitely get a bang for your buck!

Parking is free, as with most if not all of the hotels in Vegas. The parking garage is HUGE and has stairs, escalators, and elevators. There's also valet parking and a taxi drop off/pick up area.

Check-in was quick and easy. Lines weren't long and it took us around 5 minutes.

Decor/ambience is really great in this hotel. It doesn't really have a theme like a lot of the other hotels on the strip. It's just modern, classy, and trendy. I really liked it!

Elevators were kinda confusing since depending on what floor you're on, you have a certain set of elevators you have to take. However, the elevators are AWESOME and INCREDIBLY fast! We stayed on the 20th floor and it only took a few seconds to get from our room down to the lobby and back!

Our suite was AMAZING. There was a living room area that had a couch, desk, chairs, coffee table, and a huge television! There was also a guest bathroom located right by the door if you have people over. It's a 1/2 bath so just a sink and toilet, but still really awesome! There's also a mini-bar area, but make sure you don't touch any of the items there because they are monitored with a weight system, and you are automatically charged for anything you pick up. 

The bedroom area of our room was really nice. We had an incredible king sized bed with a HUGE wall unit that had a TV in the middle, and his and hers closets on either side of it. The closets even had lights inside to see your clothes, and robes, slippers, hangers, etc.!

Our main bathroom was HUGE! It came with two sinks, toilet, a big shower, and a ginormous bathtub that could fit like 3 people in it. My college dorm room was honestly smaller than this bathroom...it was crazy!

The Cirque du Soleil Michael Jackson show plays at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. We didn't watch it, but we plan on watching it during one of our future visits! 

The MIX Lounge at the top of the hotel is supposed to be da bomb. We didn't end up going up there but we saw a ton of people waiting in line to go up.

The ONLY things I didn't love about THEhotel were:

1) LACK OF WIFI IN ROOMS. I think they only had ethernet but that is useless when you only have your smart phone and iPad with you.

2) NO REFRIGERATOR IN SUITE. The bf tried to create a makeshift refrigerator with our ice bucket. Didn't really work...

3) LOCATION. That it's on the far south end of the strip. Like literally the last hotel. Fortunately we drove to Vegas so we used our car to drive further up the strip, but if you don't have a car I can imagine it being a huge issue. It's quite a long walk from THEhotel towards the middle/north end of the strip.

I would definitely stay at THEhotel again and highly recommend it! 5 stars!

I noticed after this visit just how much the price has changed when it comes to a brunch buffet. Generally brunch costs more than breakfast, lunch or dinner, but not here at the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station. Brunch on Sunday runs around $9.99 (same price for dinner during the week) with a players card. After being seated I noticed how dirty the highchair was that my nephew was in. I'm talking all sorts of food on either side of it. I cleaned it up with some wipes his mom had with her, but this highchair looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. Our server was great and checked on us often. Even with the big group we had at our table she kept the dishes cleared and brought us refills without us ever having to ask. 

They brunch buffet has the usual stuff. Different breakfast and lunch option at the same time. I walked by the pizza as it was coming out so I figured that was a good time to get some of that. It tasted OK, but definitely tasted like a frozen pizza that was made. They do have a pizza oven right there and you can watch it cook, but it wasn't anything I'd ever go out of my way for. The bacon was hard and tasted microwaved. Scrambled eggs weren't bad or the mini waffle I had. The hash browns were a soggy mess with some burnt crispy parts. I did enjoy the mac & cheese even if it tasted like Kraft deluxe. The breakfast sausage looked good, but tasted nasty. I brought back an assortment of desserts for our table to try and they were terrible! All of the pastries were hard which was a disappointment. I will say that the salad bar had a lot of options including fresh fruit and it all looked good. I enjoyed what I had from the salad bar area much more than anywhere else at the buffet. This buffet could use many changes and isn't really worth it until then in my opinion. 

Kids 2 and under are free.

My first visit being so-so, I decided to give Teriyaki Madness a second try to see if I liked it any better. For me it was still the same so-so experience and I don't get the hype over this place. Inside is very clean and they have plenty of tables to choose from and the booths are spacious which is nice. The employees were very friendly and helpful with going over the menu. Some of the food I ordered was really good and some of it was not so good. I do get coupons in the mail sometimes for BOGO offers, so I can see coming back with a coupon and probably will since the rice and chicken are pretty darn good and I work in the area, but I can't see making a point to come here often. 

Spicy Chicken Teriyaki Plate ($8.99) - I took the white rice that came with it and mixed it with the chicken. I liked the flavor of the chicken a lot. There was a good portion of both rice and chicken. I'd order this again for sure. 

Spicy Beef Teriyaki Plate ($9.49) - For an extra $1 this time I chose noodles instead of rice. The noodles were a bit dry and lacked flavor. The beef was tender and tasted good, but I tasted teriyaki flavor and no spice which was a bummer because I had enjoyed the spicy chicken and the chicken actually kick. The overpowering flavor of teriyaki on this one will most likely mean that I will stick to the spicy chicken instead.

Chicken Egg Roll ($1.99) - Inside I saw tons of what appeared to be black pepper yet the egg roll really had no flavor. It was filled with a generous amount of chicken, but it was greasy and flavorless. 

Chicken Pot Stickers ($3.29) - These were a greasy and overcooked mess. On the menu these are described as "crazy good" and I got 5 of them that were crazy greasy and hard. The inside tasted not so great. I will stick to the stickers elsewhere. 

Stir-Fry Veggies and a Green Salad are each options for sides. The salad came with a sweet dressing that tasted good. The veggies were basic yet tasty and fresh. 

Orders are made fresh so if you are on a lunch break or crunched for time then call your order in so it's ready or at least being made while you are on your way to pick it up.

Thomas Keller is known for being a freakin' genius and since French Laundry is super expensive, Bouchon is a more cost-effective way to taste Chef Keller's masterpieces. 

So, I dragged 17 of my closest relatives here to experience one helluva breakfast! Many in my family, by the way, think IHOP is the best breakfast place on earth...*groan* *eyes roll* I hoped this place would give them an eye-opening, revelatory, perspective-altering dining experience!

FOOD (And yes, I sampled ALL these dishes):
Moules au Safran et a la Moutarde ($25.50) - WHOA. Mussels and fries for breakfast??? Oh hell yeah! I HAD to try it! Fries were cooked and salted perfectly. Tiny mussels steamed in white wine, mustard, and saffron...so tasty, so fresh! After the mussels were devoured, I wanted to grab the egg-shaped metal bowl and gulp down the remaining liquid. The white wine in that liquid was so distinct! Don't worry, I didn't lose my composure, I subtly used my spoon to enjoy the leftover yumminess.

Breakfast Americaine ($22) - This was served with two eggs any style, bacon, sausage, and toasted brioche. It also came with your choice of breakfast pastry, juice, and coffee. The most memorable thing about this dish was the surprisingly delicious strawberry croissant that didn't even look like a croissant. It was actually kind of ugly, but when I put a piece of it in my mouth...HOLY MOLY! I was surprised by how tasty it was! Warm, moist, sweet, with a hint of strawberry; soft and crunchy at the same time.

Bouchon French Toast ($12) - Brilliantly executed! A French toast cylinder with layers of bread pudding, brioche, custard, and apples. So light! so sweet! So moist! So nice to look at, I almost didn't want to eat it!

Gauffres ($12) - Waffles with fresh strawberries, sweetened with maple syrup and vanilla butter. Light, sweet, crunchy! Oh yesssss...

Les Oeufs ($13) - Nothing impressive. The scrambled eggs and country sausage were decent. The toasted brioche was good after I covered it with the made-in-house strawberry jam. I am not a fan of fruit preserves, actually I hate them but this strawberry jam was excellent. The potato croquettes were alright. Christopher C said they were good with ketchup.

Cinnamon Oatmeal w/Candied Orange Peel & Raspberry Puree ($7) - Bland but it was served in a cute little metal bowl. The raspberry puree was so subtle I could hardly tell it was there. And where was the candied orange peel? I couldn't see or taste it. The raspberries on top added a little flavor. It was a little better when we added the small cup of brown sugar that was included. We experimented and added some strawberry jam and oatmeal was way better!

Pecan Sticky Bun ($4.25) - Oh myyyyyy! Topped with crunchy pecans, this bun is very sticky, very sweet, and very good!

Hibiscus Champagne Cocktail ($12.50) - I ordered a mimosa but when they brought it, I saw this drink on the tray going to another table and I had to have one too! What a pretty cocktail! The hibiscus was fun to eat! When a person says no to this champagne, they say no to life!

SERVICE:
We had two waiters all to ourselves. We didn't wait too long for our drinks & food but they seemed to disappear after our food was served. It was hard to flag down our waitress when I wanted another champagne. Also, it took a while for my dad to get his coffee refilled.

I was proud of my family for being adventurous and trying something other than Ihop or McDonald's for breakfast. Even though we didn't get stellar service, they enjoyed their breakfast here. I sure LOVED it! After eating top quality food at this restaurant, I would love to eat at French Laundry. Hmmm...I might have to wait to win the lottery.

I really enjoy the Sicilian pizza from the Cugino's across town, so when I noticed this location I wanted to check it out. Before walking in, I noticed a sign at the door promoting their current specials. When I saw they offered a 2 slice Sicilian special with drink I knew that would be what I wanted to get. I have been in more than once and the same sign is out front with several different specials on it, but they don't always have them all available. So far each time I have been in (even at dinner time) they don't have any Sicilian ready unless you order a whole pizza. They only have had some regular slices available. When I asked the guy behind the counter about it, he said that it just depends what time you get there and says they sell out quick. If people like it so much why not have more of it ready? Oh well I do agree it's tasty! I ended up getting the 2 slice special with a drink. For just cheese slices it's only $4.99 and with pepperoni it's $5.99 which isn't bad at all. The slices are decent size and like how the crust is thin yet has just the right crispness to it. I have eaten inside, but I have also taken my lunch back to work with me and I like that the pizza is still nice and warm and the crust isn't soggy by the time I drive back and eat it. This is a plus because let's face it, not all take-out tastes the same once you get it home vs. eating it right when you get it. The inside is clean and the employees are friendly. Definitely better than average pizza, so if you are in the area give it try.

Third times a charm? This makes three times I have seen a pizza spot in this location. I stopped in and ordered a "Monday's Special" which is a large cheese pizza for $9.99 and additional toppings are extra. Inside was very busy so I guess others are wanting to this place out too. While I was waiting for my pizza, I noticed they have pizza by the slice for sale. I asked if they could add a slice of Sicilian (cheese) to my order priced at $3.25 and make it to-go. My husband isn't a fan of a lot of sauce on a pizza, but I'm the opposite. I asked for a side of sauce (cost .85 cents) to go along with my pizza for dipping and it and I ended up really liking the flavor. The pizza had a thin crust and the right amount of cheese for it. The pizza wasn't very greasy at all and hubby and I both enjoyed it. The Sicilian slice tasted great and had the crisp crust it should, but I was a but disappointed when I got home and opened the paper bag it was in and it was just on a paper plate inside the bag. They did just open, so it's possible they ran out of to-go boxes, but I hope it's not this way all the time. The Sicilian slice was actually my favorite part. The employees were nice and with the different specials they have going on and the food being decent, I can see coming back.

Most pizza joints have a "slice special" and it has a certain time it runs and sometimes only on certain days. Well, here you can get 2 slices and a drink for $5.50 7 days a week anytime. I thought it was a plus that I could get a slice special for dinner instead of just a restricted lunch time special. Aside from pizza they also have wings, fingers, salads, strombolis, pasta, sandwiches and desserts. They also cater.

WED, MARCH 27, 2013 // 12:00PM-2:00PM 
                 PRICE FOR 2: $63.98 (TR price) + $5.18 (tax) + $10.84 (tip) = $80.00
                 WAIT: 15-20mins
                 SERVER: DAWN - (4/5). She looked frazzled but always made time to check up on us. Asked me if I wanted more Peachy Tea when I finished, refilled our waters, & brought us 2 carafes when we asked for coffee.

FRI, MARCH 29, 2013 // 5:00PM-7:30PM
                 PRICE FOR 2: $99.98 (TR price) + $8.10 (tax) + $16.42 (tip) = $124.50
                 WAIT: 25-30mins
                 SERVER: IRANDA - (1/5). We had to chase her down 3x, she ignored our table completely. When we asked for coffee, she brought us 1/2 empty cups (spilled coffee all over the saucers). VINCE (4/5), not our server, was friendly, paid closer attention & cleared our table multiple times.
_________________________

Bacchanal can be overwhelming since there are a LOT of dishes to choose from. Between Bacchanal & Wicked Spoon, if you only have time for one and care more about the selection - go to Bacchanal. (Save room for the CREPES!) 

THINGS I CRAVE: 1.) Lasagna, 2.) Prime Rib, 3.) Crepes, 4.) Machaca, 5.) Posole.

Personally, though, Wicked Spoon still wins in just a few minor areas: a few key dishes that are well executed, bone marrow at dinner, and smooth creamy gelato as opposed to the grainy ice cream at Bacchanal. It's also slightly less expensive, less crowded, and comes with much more consistently reliable service.

CONSENSUS: Would try to make time for both on my next trip to Vegas - Bacchanal for lunch, Wicked Spoon for dinner.

I never thought that I would have such a horrifying experience at this club, which I've been to a handful of times in the past. I came to celebrate my birthday with my cousins and things were fine until around midnight when we took a break from dancing. We were outside near the bar and gambling tables when I noticed a security guard talking to one of my cousins (I'll refer to him as K). I stepped in to make sure everything was ok because the guard looked pretty intense. When I inquired, the guard said that K had a flask and wouldn't turn it over. (This was true because we had asked him to bring one--although he actually didn't even use it!) The guard said he had to leave, so I said we were sorry and we would all go with him. Yes, these things happen and I knew we were wrong for bringing the flask. When I said we were going, too, the guard said we couldn't go with him, but we could meet him somewhere. I grabbed a few of my cousins and we just hurried through the club as the guard led him away. Then another guard came by to help escort him (K was compliant and it seemed unnecessary to have two guards, but whatever. We just hurried up to make sure we could be with him.). Anyone who has been to clubs and has gotten asked to leave knows that it is normal and expected for your group to go with you to make sure everything is ok. But when we reached the elevators to go down, they wrenched him away from us and now there were six guys. Four were in the elevator with him, pinning him against the wall. We asked the two men in front of the elevator, who were blocking us from him, why we couldn't go with him. We said that we didn't want to cause any problems, but we just needed to know he would be ok. My cousin tried to have the manager let her in, but he pushed her back.  K started calling for help because they were hurting him. We could see that the four guards had him slammed against the wall and were starting to choke him out to keep him from calling to us. I can still see the fear in his eyes and I will never forget the sounds of his voice. He was so scared and we were so helpless, trying to just protect him from whatever was about to happen. K is the sweetest kid, and he was compliant.  He was not drunk or belligerent. They were using unnecessary force and they wouldn't even tell us where they were taking him and why 4-6 men were needed to make him leave. He struggled against them only when they started hurting him and choking him. We left the club and asked the front door bouncer what we should do next and where we could find him. He advised us to go back to our hotel because they would most likely put him in a cab. But it was so suspicious that we couldn't just leave with him! It's as if they didn't want us to witness what they were doing, which was using unnecessary force for no good reason. We left for our hotel and told the rest of our family to wait there to see if they would release him, which they did about 20-30 minutes later. 

When K came back, he told us what happened. He had been choked out (there were red marks all over his neck) and he was holding a paper towel covered in his blood. He had woken up on the floor near a back elevator of the hotel because they had choked him out to the point of a black-out. If that wasn't traumatizing enough, the guards asked him repeatedly what he remembered. He was alone and afraid, and although he remembered every horrific moment of their abuse, he was afraid to say a word of it. He knew it'd make it worse and they'd probably keep him longer...so he said he didn't recall. And they implied that he had probably accidentally hit his head or fell and passed out somehow. But the truth is they did it! They feigned ignorance and pretended to play nice at that point to cover up their dirty deed. They got him a paramedic to clean up all the blood on his face and hands...there was even drops of his blood on the floor. He cried when he told us because he was so traumatized.  My heart truly broke for him and I was so appalled at this wrongdoing. It could have happened to any of us! It has probably happened before to other people...people who were compliant and didn't want any trouble, just like K. We knew we had to try to do something to correct this huge injustice and act of violence, so we called the Cosmopolitan hotel to file a formal complaint. Then we called the LV police. They sent two officers to our room to take down a report. Neither acts yielded any progress. I felt that we got brushed off as if this incident wasn't important. I cannot believe that nothing can be done. I fear for everyone's safety that goes to Marquee now. I will never set foot in this club again. I advise that no one else go here either. What happened is so wrong, and I plead with you to spread the word about this injustice. Please do not give this place your business.

Dating Guide for Dummies, Vol. 4: How to properly club & hit on a group of bodacious bimbos at an A-list Vegas night club.

In this edition of DG for D's, I'm going to cover a premiere Vegas night club and extract it's venue perks towards your benefit.  This is also one of the few clubs where every girl will still look amazing after the lights turn on, so there's no need to rush out.

When you go to a night club, you need to be fresh, look fresh, and feel fresh.  The girls don't get Barbie'd up for nothing in this town so you need to do your part too, but do it with a cool sense of casual-class and finesse.  Down-dress with a nice untucked dress shirt with your sleeves rolled, slim designer jeans, dress shoes other than black, and a loose, solid tie (optional, but highly recommended). 

Now on to the venue, XS is a club where the guys "can" get some loving, but how, you ask?  I feel your pain brother, that's why I wrote this installment.  Main rule of thumb, don't wait in the 2 hour line and don't go in broke.  Even if you manage to walk in with a group of lovely girls, you will need to order drinks.  Your best bet is to cut the line by booking a VIP table and/or cabana with your boys and splitting the costs.  Girls love VIP and they love free bottle service so you're sure to attract a herd of them.  With that said, if you're not hitting it off, limit those skanks to 1 drink or risk getting played.

Did I mention the girls are easy?  For the most part they are.  Trust me, 85% are there to get some sort of action: simple flirting, subtle make out sessions, someone to dance with, or straight answer how they like their eggs in the morning question.  Over easy please.  Stay away from the other 15%, you'll immediately know who they are and don't question the validity of these statistics, it's certified as I've scientifically proven them during my last visit.

Make sure to stay away from any pair of girls since they usually want to dance with themselves, unless they approach you or emit an inviting aura a la cutesy wandering eyes.  Also, steer clear of groups larger than 4 unless you have backup.  There's too much criticism amongst these felines and you'll be heavily scrutinized.  Even if the entire group digs you, it takes one crazy bitch to say stop-no-and-don't to ruin your game.  3 is the magic number fellas, there are less girls to impress and you'll get a chance to charm them up on a more intimate level.  If you happen to cusp one away from her pack, the other two girls will still have each other so she's really not leaving her girls hanging.  Once you do, take her outside to cool off and dance at the shallow end of the pool.  Trust me and get your feet wet, this will show her your fun, adventurous side.

If you arrive a little late, well that's perfect!  The girls are already liquored up from the many guys offering them free drinks.  This is a good thing as these guys haven't read my guide so they're making our jobs easier and cheaper.  They don't call me Dr. Date, aka Mr. Steal-Your-Girl for nothing.  Have no shame, just roll on in and commit a robbery.  Also remember, these girls are already wet from how magnificent the venue is: the euro style dcor and endless stripper poles, flashing lights and fancy limelights, gorgeously-lit pool area and spacious outdoor dance floor, loungy plush-white day beds, and party-rocking-world-class dj's.  XS is really doing us a favor.  You paid for it so use it towards your advantage.

Now go, young padawan, for you have the tools necessary to roam the short skirts of XS.  May good luck and fortune bestow upon you.  And remember kids, what happens in Vegas, stays...except for herpes.  That shit will come home with you.

They say, you can never go home, or go back. Well, I've never bought into that. 

Over the years, we've been in almost a dozen or so Chart Houses. Sadly, many have closed due to whatever corporate reorg was going on at the time. I miss the ones in Steamboat and Newport, RI the most. Great locations and views. 

So it was with some excitement that we made reservations here for Easter Sunday dinner. Surprisingly, we have never been to this location.

We arrived a few minutes before six and found our hostess in a middle of a hiccups fit. I offered to frighten her but she decline. I guess I was scary enough. LOL

There was also some confusion over our reservations, but it didn't last long. We were escorted to our table, over by the window with a magnificent view of the lake. You got to give Chart House credit for choosing some great locations!

We started with a glass of Merlot and Pinot each. Both were very good for house wines. We also opted for the salads, the warm bacon dressing was delicious, as was the Caesar.

Things started slowly declining from here. I asked about getting their Callahan Prime Rib End Cut ($33.99). Seems the kitchen couldn't make up their minds if they had one. 

First it was no, then yes and finally surprise, they delivered a regular cut. It was tasteless with no flavor at all. When we were paying I mentioned it to our server, all they could say was, "oh yeah."  Grrr. LOL. The other entree was their Beef Tenderloin Medallions ($31.99) which was very good. 


For dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake to share with some coffee. It came damaged and somewhat of a mess. LOL. See our photo, versus the Chart House one. Our waiter apologized saying they should have been picked it up sooner. (Okay, why didn't you bring us another one?). 

The current owners of Chart House is Landry, a very classy and sharp organization.  I would suggest they work on this location before they need to close this one too. 

Our bill, including two glasses of wine ran us $80.00 a person, including taxes and gratuities. 

Now why didn't we go to Capital Grill I wonder?  Well, maybe next time.

For a positive review of a Chart House, I call your attention to my friend Norm's recent experience in Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz/forte-european-tapas-bar-and-bistro-las-vegas?hrid=Gpo-2lh59Bru8sKqgRm5Hw

I don't expect this to go anywhere, especially given the level of customer service (or lack thereof)  I received this past weekend at the SLS Las Vegas. Nevertheless, I feel the need to vent so here goes.

I booked a 4-day stay at the SLS in order to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday as well as to ask her to marry me. I had heard that the SLS was a small hotel, recently refurbished and that it provided a hip and trendy way yet friendly atmosphere. I was especially attracted to the fact that the SLS is somewhat removed from the strip and that afforded us some much needed quiet and privacy.

24-hours prior to my arrival I called the hotel to confirm my reservation (which I booked directly with the hotel on-line) as well as to advise reservations that I had a late flight in and therefore required late check-in. At first the agent couldn't locate my reservation and actually told me that I did not have one. After 20-minutes on the telephone he finally located my reservation under the confirmation number i had given him. He told me that he would notate the system about the late arrival and that I should have no problems from there.

I arrived at the SLS shortly before midnight on the 8th only to find out that my reserved room had been assigned to someone else. The agent at the counter seemed clueless about what to do next so I jokingly suggested that she upgrade me to a suite - which she said she would do. The problem? Well the "suite" was a room with two under-sized double beds. Given that this was supposed to have been a romantic getaway long weekend I did not consider the sleeping arrangements to be ideal. I then proceeded to call the front desk who told me they would call me at 10AM the next day when my original room became available. The call never came.

At 11:00 AM on the 9th I went to the front desk to inquire about the room and was told by the employee that no rooms were available, that I should consider myself lucky to have the room I had because it was better than my original room and that perhaps I should check out and try to check back in after 3PM if something became available. Really?!?!?! Not being able to tolerate any more stupidity my girlfriend and I decided to go to the SLS buffet for breakfast. While on the way I stopped to ask an employee if the buffet was open and where it was located. They told me that they didn't know where it was located and went on to tell me that they were likely no longer serving food at 11:30 AM so my girlfriend and I went to the MGM buffet instead. We subsequently found out that the SLS Buffet is indeed open for breakfast, lunch and dinner - but more to follow on that one. 

While all of this was going on my girlfriend was attempting to track down a package that she had delivered to the hotel. The person at the front desk told her to check with the FedEx Office. The FedEx Office told her to check with the mail room. Nobody knew anything about the package so I asked the concierge and explained the story to her. She was surprised to learn that the SLS had an actual mail room. She did locate it, however we were promptly informed that we could not go to the mail room because it was an employee only area. The concierge was helpful in that she offered to have a bell-hop deliver the package, the problem however is that the package wasn't delivered to us until 4-hours after the request.

Back to the room fiasco - we stayed in the room with the undersized beds. The lack of helpfulness of the staff wore us out.

Back to the buffet - we finally made it there Sunday. The food was great, it's a shame that there was nobody around to bring us drinks - the wait staff (in typical SLS fashion) was missing and less than helpful.

Oh and then there is the cab ride where the valet at the gate stopped our cab driver to yell at him (using profanities) and asking what country he thought he was driving in because he accidentally turned out in the wrong direction.

To top it all off everyone at the SLS kept addressing me as Mr. Fxxxxo when my name is Sxxxxxe. Fxxxxo is my girlfriends last name. Given that I made the reservations, that I paid for the trip and that everything was under Sxxxxxe I am unsure why the SLS couldn't get something as simple as my name right. 

SLS - Our experience was horrible. I ended up not proposing to my girlfriend because of the stress that you put on both of us. You ruined my girlfriend's long birthday weekend and we will never be back. It's really a shame because on the surface the SLS is a great hotel but when you put lipstick on a pig you still have a pig and that is exactly what the SLS is - a painted pig.

Again, I expect this will fall on deaf ears but I really needed to vent.

Ay Caramba!!!!

I Love This Place!!!!

On our last stop through SinCity before heading out to the airport, my friends and I decided to check out this off-strip Yelp favorite. With over 1,000 reviews, Firefly has scored an impressive 4.5 star average out of five, no easy feat I might add!

Well, it goes without saying that I came with high expectations. Luckily, I was not disappointed...whew!

Upon stepping into the bustling restaurant, i heard rhythmic salsa music being played in the background and it had a very familar Latin cantina vibe to it, which felt casual and fun. With lots of red and orange all around my hankering for tasty tapas became even more amplified!

We were seated conveniently by the large window, which let in a good amount of natural lighting (excellent for foodporn) and spacious enough for us to stow our luggage.

Our server was friendly and helpful with the menu and never pushy or rude.  Within moments of ordering, we got some sliced baguettes drizzled with butter and served with pickled olives and a house butter spread. The bread was warm & crisp and house butter was delicious! 

Then came our drinks and tapas!

I must insist that you try the blood orange mojito. You can taste that the blood orange was deeply infused in this amazing drink and the combination of the refreshing mint makes this exhilarating drink all the more enjoyable! Of course, the sangrias here are phenomenal and also a must if you're going to enjoy tapas here, as well.

Now onto the tapas...

Bacon Wrapped dates with smoked almonds red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles were remarkably good! Crisp bacon wrapped around sweet dates and tooped with fragrant blue cheese crumbles is always a winning combination in my book!

Tuna tartare - the marinated tuna had a tangy Asian flare that had hints of soy, lime & chili...enjoyed on crisp taro chips, it was a delicious contrast of textures and flavors that made this tartare a shining success!

Tierra Y Mar Skewers - Grilled Shrimp, Filet Mignon, Chorizo, Salsa Verde - from the plump shrimp to the juicy filet, each morsel on the skewer was cooked perfectly. Tack on the the tangy  kick of the salsa verde and it was a virtual fiesta in the mouth! 

Duck rolls - Crisp and delicious fried wonton wrapped around tender pieces of succulent braised duck and dressed in a very tangy sweet hoisin sauce, almost too cloyingly sweet but overall, very tasty.

Filet Mignon sliders - Served with a very rich Serrano ham, cabrales cheese sauce and caramelized onions this dish was probably the most disappointing as the burgers were cooked well done leaving them without the awesome pink center I love so much. Because they were well done, they were chewier and less tender juicy and flavorful 

Camarones la diabla - Now this dish was a winner! Bursting with bright flavor and beautifully presented in a fiery red sauce, the plump shrimp were generously dressed with a sauce that creeped up slowly but left a spicy kick at the end of each bite...yum!

Ceviche - Loaded with plump shrimp, this dish came with loads of crunchy tortilla chips and buttery avocado. My only gripe would be that it needed some some spice to kick it up a notch. Nothing a lil Tabasco couldn't fix which our lovely server remedied for us upon request.

For dessert - We enjoyed a caramel flan with a lady finger and it was the perfect end to a delightful meal!

Our server also arranged cab service for us which arrived in record time!

I highly recommend Firefly to anyone looking for a great lunch or evening out with friends. The restaurant is fun, the service is friendly and the food is fantastic!

Happy Eats!

2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 39/100

My boyfriend and I were on a mission to try all of the Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas this weekend! BurGR was our second stop of the trip!

BurGR is located literally right inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel. SUPER easy to get to from the lobby! They have this AWESOME glass window display with a metal structure emitting a bunch of flames all over it. It's really interesting and a great storefront display! They also have a bunch of Gordon Ramsay merchandise at the front such as t-shirts, cookbooks, glasses, etc.

We were able to walk right in and get seated immediately. However, a few minutes after we had been sitting at our table, I looked over to the front of the restaurant and there was a HUGE line! We got super lucky that there was nobody there when we entered at around 11:15am.

The decor of this place is super trendy, modern, and basically a sports bar with all of the large screen TVs on all of the walls displaying football and other popular sports. There are also lots of flames everywhere (I'm assuming are related to Hell's Kitchen) and a photo of Gordon Ramsay.

Waiter service was great, as usual. Our waiter immediately came to us and asked if we wanted to take a look at the drink menu, which is an iPad 2 that they give you to look at. It is an interactive menu that has all of the drinks sorted by category (beers, cocktails, red/white wine, etc.), descriptions of each drink, and even photographs. There's also a tab with Gordon Ramsay's biography and photograph, which I thought was pretty cool.

We ordered two waters, a cup of coffee, and then took a look at the menus. The menus were pretty amusing because they, too, had a giant photo of Gordon Ramsay that surprises you when you first order them :P

My bf and I ended up sharing the Shake #4 - creme brulee pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie. THIS WAS AMAZING! I had seen photos of the shakes on Yelp and was curious to try them because I've never had a shake infused with pudding before. Thanks to this shake, I am a HUGE fan of the pudding + shake combination from now on :) So yummy! The two flavors look separated (with creme brulee on top and oreo on the bottom), but surprisingly when you sipped on it, the flavors were combined and complimented each other very well. I would love to come back to try the other 4 combinations!

As for burgers, I ordered the Uber Cheese Burger (fontina cheese + raclette cheese + goat cheese), and my boyfriend got the American burger (american cheese + butter lettuce + tomato + pickle + onion). As a HUGE cheese lover, my burger was absolutely PERFECT for me! It was literally just the patty + 3 types of cheese, which was exactly what I wanted. My bf nearly inhaled his American burger and said it was super good. We unfortunately decided to skip out on getting fries because we didn't have the appetite to eat that much food! I would definitely like to come back to try the truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries.

When we received our bill, we were given an iPod that had a little survey/questionnaire for us to answer based on our dining experience at BurGR. The Yelp Elite in me naturally reached for this and began answering the questions like crazy :P I thought it was pretty cool how much they integrated the use of iPads and iPods at their restaurant!

Overall, 5 stars for a really trendy, hip atmosphere, great service, and delicious food! I would love to come back during my next visit to Vegas! :)

Originally hubby and I were going to try a different place, but it was too packed so I decided to look up what was nearby on the yelp app. I had Fat Boy bookmarked and it was only a couple of blocks from where we tried to eat first, so we headed to Fat Boy.

Walking inside there wasn't much space and there were plenty of customers. There are maybe 4 or 5 tables and we were lucky enough after ordering to snatch one up. The food is made to order and since it was busy we had to wait our turn for our food to come out, but I was patient since it smelled of yummy pizza throughout the place and the vibe inside was awesome.

I asked the man who took our order if the bacon was made fresh since this would alter if I would order it or not. He said that indeed was! I ordered a "BLT Sandwich" priced at just $3.24 for the sandwich by itself, or $6.23 to make it a combo with fries and a drink. I made mine a combo and substituted regular fries for "Chencho Fries" which was a very smart decision. The BLT came out on a burger bun with fresh shredded lettuce, tomato and mayo. I was surprised at the amount of bacon on the sandwich for the price. I was pleased with the flavor of the BLT and would happily order it again with a little extra mayo. You can order the Chencho Fries with skinny or fat fries. The cashier suggested the skinny fries so I went with that and hubby had the fat fries with his. The Chencho Fries have a little bit of chicken with green sauce and cheese. Yum! I loved these fries! Get over here and try these fries! Hubby had a "Pastrami Boyger" and couldn't stop talking about how good the pastrami was so we came back a couple days later for dinner again!

This time hubby went with a full on "Pastrami Sandwich" and loved it. I knew after smelling the pizza a couple days before that I had to give it a try. They have a pick-up only special where you can get a 14" one topping pizza for $5.49 so I was all over that! I ordered a cheese pizza and a side of ranch to dip it in. The owner (turns out this was who took our order the first time) came over to our table and talked to me about the pizza and how he makes the dough from scratch everyday. The pizza was cheesy and the sauce and crust tasted great. I just can't believe how good it tastes for such a great price. I don't live near Fat Boy, but it's worth the drive and I will absolutely be back! 

They offer a good variety of menu options from pizza, boygers, wings, fingers, salads, sandwiches, milkshakes, bottled drinks and fountain drinks. They also offer boyrritos, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas and even serve breakfast! They have different specials and family deals too.

They sell pizza by the slice, so originally that was the plan. On the way in though I noticed a pizza special on the window for a $9.99 large (pick-up/carryout). I thought that was a great price to try out their pizza and this way it would be a freshly made pizza. Walking in it looked like a typical deli. There were tables inside and the usual pasta, tomato sauce, etc. for sale. The olives, meats and sweets they offer look very good, but they have no prices on anything. There are plenty of signs along the glass case promoting catering and their win on "Sandwich Wars" yet nothing saying how much per pound or per slice anything was. Maybe they were changing out prices and I came at an off time, but if I have to ask how much something is... I'm more than likely to just pass all together. 

The guy who took the order was nice and when I showed him my yelp check-in deal for a free "Mini Cannoli" he made sure I marked it *used* and said it would be with my order. He also said it would be about 10-ish minutes for the pizza to be made and that was cool by me. When the food was ready I checked my bag and there was no Cannoli. I had to ask for it and the girl who handed me the food acted like she had no idea about it and had to ask around. Finally, the guy who took the order came out and said "yeah yeah they get a free mini" so she went and packaged one up for me. 

The pizza deal wont be going on forever. The guy told me that they would be stopping it soon. Don't fret! If you get down here before it ends you will get a card that gets you the large cheese pizza for $9.99 every time. Score! 

Wow! The pizza was pretty darn good! I love when something as simple as a cheese pizza tastes so good. It seems lately I have been experiencing bland pizza, but not here. The sauce has a good flavor and I like the crust. I had some left over for lunch the next day and it was just as good cold! The Cannoli made for a nice dessert. I enjoyed it. 

They deliver!

My favorite buffet in VEGAS!!! 

I came here close to when it opened years ago and remembered loving it and finally got a chance to return and i was happy it was still as good as i remember. 

Off the strip, i came here with my family after outlet shopping on a wednesday lunch. We heard about a senior deal for people over 50, but unfortunately THEY ENDED THE SENIOR DEAL. Still, it's a great deal as we only paid $16.00 per person and they have one of the biggest selections and also UNLIMITED WINE AND BEER AND GELATO!!!

PRICES: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=aVc7XXpYbfEx0zQX1169bA

Seafood Dinner  Fri: 4pm-10pm $34
                               Sat/Sun 2:30-10pm $34

Recommendation: Go for a late breakfast and stay for lunch items, which is plenty of food!

If u want crab legs, don't bother going during the weekday lunches (not sure if they have it during weekday dinners) cuz they dont' have any.

BUT, there's so much stuff! Everything was pretty good except for the sushi, which was terrible that day. Really hard rice! :(
However, i enjoyed DESSERT the best as you can see from my pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LNGBEEelQx4zbfWnlc66cw?select=-2R7iQN7p-BTqDGQACzHXA
Creme Brulee, meringue cookies, carrot cake, RV cupcakes, panna cotta, tiramisu, mousse cake, chocolate cake. GELATO of many kinds, tarts,

Others: small selection of chinese food/mediterranean/mexican /indian.mussels, seafood ciopinno, shrimp scampi, baked ziti, BACON, fried shrimp, fried mushrooms, fried chicken, mash, asparagus, sweet potatoes with marshmallows, cream corn and spinach 

Sad to see some of the prices have hiked up since i originally went, but i would definitely recommend this place if ur tired of waiting in huge long lines and paying the same price or more and getting charged extra for drinks. 

Located in the M Resort- that blue building u see off to the right before you get to the strip. A great place to stop on the way home!

Sweets Raku is the brainchild of Mitsuo Endo of the Abriya Raku fame (a 3-time James Beard Award nominee). The concept of this restaurant is a dessert bar, where you come in, order off a prefix menu, or order the desserts  la carte. Being a dessert bar, you will be served desserts only (but I've heard that they also have a cheese plate). After hearing some interesting comments about this dessert bar, I went with a buddy after my SnowFlake Shavery fix to get some dessert.

SR is located in the Seoul Plaza on Spring Mountain Road and Jones. It actually sits across the same building complex as Raku. Walking inside, you'll notice an amazing display of bottles of water and other refreshments built into a see-through wall. The clean, modern, and white interior give you a sense that the people who created this restaurant really wanted to give you an unforgettable experience. There is an open kitchen, and around it sits a bar with around 15 seats where you can watch all the desserts being made right in front of your eyes! There are also tables, but if you have the opportunity, sit at the bar and enjoy the show.

The pastry chef is Mio who is in charge of the kitchen. She's been a pastry chef for over a decade in Japan, but you would never guess due to her youthful appearance. The server dropped off a menu that was rolled up in a sugar ribbon ring. After ordering our drinks and the prix fix menu, we waited for Mio to start. The menu is also edible, and I thought that was a real neat and fun idea to be able to eat a menu!  It didn't have a taste at all, which is good because I would have gagged if it tasted like paper. The server then brought us our drinks.

- Americano coffee: They use the Illy brand coffee, and it was bold and well made.

The Amuse/First course came up first:

- Strawberry and Mint: A strawberry sorbet with mint jelly, with a fresh sprig of micromint. The strawberry sorbet had a nice strawberry flavor. The texture was sort of weird for me, it wasn't icy... but I guess it wasn't as smooth as I would have liked.  It's hard to describe. On the other hand, the texture of the mint jelly was well done, but I couldn't really taste the mint flavor that much.

The main entrees then arrived:

- Mt. Fuji: This was a play on the classic French dessert, the Mont Blanc. This was my favorite dessert of the night. The chestnut cream was amazingly light and had a smooth chestnut flavor. The cake was moist, and the chestnut glace complimented the whole dish. The presentation was also pretty cool.

- Apollo: Chocolate and raspberry mousse on top of chocolate cake, Earl grey tea ice cream, raspberry meringue, chocolate bases, and raspberry sauce. I thought the mousse's were all well made and so was the chocolate cake. The chocolate squares around the plate and the Earl Grey Tea ice cream were my favorite part of the dish. The ice cream tasted exceptionally well with the pink peppercorns that were ground on top. I thought the meringue and raspberry sauce were O.K. This was my least favorite dessert, I thought, flavor wise... it was just too safe.

The petit fours/Last Courses arrived:

- Parmesan cheesecake with oranges: I loved the concept of this dish. It is like eating two different courses in one dish. By itself, the cheesecake is very savory, and I thought that this would make a nice appetizer on a restaurant menu. But then, after eating the cheesecake together with the oranges, it complimented the savoriness of the cheesecake perfectly, and it became a dessert again! I found this to be absolutely fascinating.

- Chocolate Fondant with marshmallows: The warm chocolate molten cake was well executed with a cakey outer shell, and a warm molten interior. It was a well balanced cake. My favorite accompaniment of the night had to go to the lemon marshmallows. They had a bright, strong,  lemon flavor, and they tasted just like a lemon curd! I thought the raspberry marshmallows were lacking in raspberry flavor, but the texture was good.

The service throughout the night was top notch. The server knew when we needed drinks refilled, and cleared our plates at the right time. She was super friendly and knowledgeable and engaged with us enough, but not overly smothering.

Dining at Sweets Raku brought an old smile to my face. It brought me back to those pre-"Great Recession" days. I remembered when the properties on the Strip were in competition with each other... not money-wise like they are now...but quality wise. Back then, F&B programs were trying to think of ways to create unforgettable experiences to their guests. Now, it's all about the bottom line, which is why we only see now burger joints, bars, and steak houses popping up, with inconsistent service everywhere. There are some flubs in this place, but you can find flaws at Raku, Joel Robuchon, The French Laundry, etc. But, this place deserves 5 stars, because.. it's the thought that counts. 

Kudos to Chef Endo and Chef Mio, true artisans of their profession!!!

When I was asked to dine at a AAA Five Diamond, Forbes Five Star, Three Michelin Star, Wine Spectator Grand Award and Chef of the Century's restaurant, the question wasn't IF...It was WHEN!

My last night in Vegas marked the unforgettable occasion and as soon as I opened those shiny glass paned double doors, I knew I was in for a treat!  As I walked across the foyer into the main dining room,  I left the hustle and bustle of the frenzied casino behind me and I was instantly transported into a luxurious 1930's style French bistro with a huge crystal chandelier cascading above me. Honestly, this place was dripping with opulence!
Truth be told, I do get a bit uncomfortable in fancy schmancy restaurants.  Perhaps it's the well pressed white table cloths or the half dozen stuffy staff serving my every whim, but this place was not like that at all.  The servers were warm, friendly and present without being overbearing, which was really nice!  Add to that the elegant yet inviting atmosphere and I was feeling like a king! A hungry one at that!    
 
As soon as we were seated and handed our nicely bound menus, I instantly knew in my mind that I wanted to try the 16 course tasting menu.  Heck, you only live once, right? 

Because we were in a festive mood, we decided on a bottle of bubbly and for me, a bottle of Veuve Clicquot fit the bill perfectly!

Then came the famous bread cart in all its glory! Wow! It was a sight to see! There were more than a dozen breads to choose from to start the meal and i think we tried almost all of em!  Three magnificent breads, however, stood out from the pack.  Those being the buttery cheese brioche, savory bacon epi, and chewy cheese baguette.  

Then, of course, came the food! Honestly, it was so beautifully plated there were times I simply felt it was a shame to eat it! But I got over that hurdle fairly quickly. 

Now, I don't plan on boring you with the entire 16 course blow by blow, but I will focus on the dining highlights which made the evening extra special for me!

Amuse Bouche "sangria emulsion" refreshingly light citrusy blood orange cream emulsion above a chilled jam in a whimsical dry ice bowl with small chunks of apples and berry sangria gelee.  Lip smacking tartness with a delightfully smooth & creamy finish! Excellent way to awaken the palate!  

Trio of Caviar 
Caviar with Asparagus - Although not the most interesting pairing of the evening, the flavors of the fresh green asparagus and salty caviar played well against each other. 
Salmon Tartare with Shiso Sprouts and Caviar - The textures were delicate and the flavors were refined.  
Daikon Cous Cous with Caviar - The thin delicate slivers of cool daikon wrapped around fluffy cous cous and topped with caviar was an exhilarating finish to an interesting play on Japanese cuisine.       

Lobster - Topped with fragrant black truffle, the langoustine ravioli was magnificent! The grilled lobster was simple yet beautifully presented. Subtle flavors but hey it's lobster! Sometimes a good thing shouldn't be messed with! The smooth & creamy sea urchin fennel potato puree was inspiring and texturally inviting, as well.

Chestnut Soup over Foie Gras Foam - Rich frothy and flavorful with savory bacon bits. The chunks of roasted chestnuts added a subtle sweetness to this warm and rustic soup. 

Bone marrow - One of my personal favorites! The marrow was luscious, rich and supple in texture. It also exhibited the most irresistible aroma! The popcorn added a pleasant textural dimension to this delightful dish.

Sea bass - Beautifully seared, this magnificent piece of fish came bathing in an irresistible butter sauce. The artichoke balanced the flavor profiles nicely. 

Birthday Cake - As the evening came to a close, the staff came out with a cart embellished with lavish decorative baubles and a small sign that read "Happy Birthday" The accompanying birthday cake was extraordinary! Perched on a large black pedestal, it was absolutely majestic but all I could think of was digging into it!  To my surprise, it was a mango meringue ice cream cake and although we couldn't take it home with us, we did indulge in two large decadent slices and it was fantastic! Bravo to the dessert chef!

If that wasn't enough we were given free reign of the mignardises (dessert cart) that had a vast selection of petit fors, small cookies and yes...macarons!

They boxed up the cookies and gave us an additional box of marshmallow treats to take home with a copy of the menu and a nicely bound colored brochure documenting the magical evening.

I'd have to say this was by far the most amazing dining experience
of my life.  Would i do it again? Someday. 

But for now, I'll just revel in the fine memories of an unforgettable evening that will leave my palate in infinite bliss!

Happy "Birthday" Eats, Part Deux!!

OFFENSIVE. Tonight I had the most offensive and unprofessional experience at Yasu; I will never ever go back and I would only recommend it to someone I hate.

A group of four of us arrived at Yasu for our 6:30PM reservation and were seated promptly. We chatted for a while as water and other beverages were brought out and we went ahead and ordered the chef's choice menu so we could see the best of the best that Yasu had to offer. I've had great experiences with chef's choice at Yen, Pure, and a number of places in Boston so I expected the same from Yasu.

We entertain ourselves for a while until the first course arrives. 8 kumamoto oysters with uni and roe. Great play of textures and flavors. Kudos. Plates are removed and now we are getting excited, sashimi must be coming next and we are ready for it! The special fish selections of the day looked fantastic.

About 20 minutes goes by and we get our second course, red snapper carpaccio. it is seared and served at room temperature. One of my pieces had i don't know, tendon or something that made it unyielding to my chopsticks, and frankly, the temp of this dish was iffy. Flavors decent, but this is not the mass quantity of sashimi or nigiri I was anticipating.

The restaurant starts filling up. I see a massive plate of rolls come out of the kitchen and I nearly squeal with glee...until I watch it come to rest at another table.  This starts happening at a regular pace, and then I realize it's been a full 30 minutes since we've had anything at our table. A server comes by so I ask when the next dish will arrive. She mumbles something about the chef's choice taking a little longer than other orders and walks away.

Another cooked plate. A gross mushroom custard, a single shrimp on a skewer, an 1/8th of a cup of japanese eggplant in red miso sauce, a shard of spanish mackerel with some sort of puree, and two bits of jumbo clam. Everything tastes fine, but we are OVER the cooked plate situation.

Yet ANOTHER 30 minutes goes by. No server, nor manager comes to apologize for the delay. We watch literally dozens of delicious looking rolls, nigiri and sashimi fly out of the kitchen to other tables. We also watch 4 other couples come in after us, eat loads of food, and leave before us. We are still hungry.

Next course...Clams in miso broth. We are not offered spoons for the broth. We look at each other, thinking, "we ARE at a sushi restaurant, are we not?" but go ahead and eat the clams.  When the server comes by and asks how it is we tell her that we hope the next course will begin the actual SUSHI part of this dinner. She says yes, we are having live scallops.

About 25 more minutes pass and I'm starting to vibrate with righteous indignation. We are clearly paying a fucking fortune for this meal and we are receiving terrible treatment. The "live scallops" are boiling in miso broth over a mini-charcoal grill. They are so over-cooked they are RUBBERY. We hurry to get them off the coals and into our mouths before they are completely ruined.

Finally we tell the server that we are going to have to INSIST on getting some raw fish on the table. She says that's what's coming next. "Next" meaning ANOTHER 30 minutes later. We wait so long that finally we tell the server we are NOT going to continue with this absurdity and that we want the check. "oh your next course is ready!" "we don't want it. We want to leave" These are the exact words out of our mouths. Instead of bringing the check she brings the plates, telling us that Chef Yasu "wants us to have them." We all resist and the plates are set down anyway and finally our hunger makes us cave and we eat. We have now been at Yasu for TWO AND A HALF HOURS. We've had five courses that were not enough for two people, much less four.

Another 15 minutes pass before the check arrives. In that time, the manager has come out, not to rectify the situation, or apologize, but to call us ignorant and classless. He literally looks at us and accuses, "Have you ever had omakase before? It is always slower." We look at him and tell him in all of our sushi eating years we have never had an experience akin to this. We also point out that we were expecting SUSHI, as in RAW FISH. He tells us we told the server we would eat 'anything'. I asked him if the name of his restaurant was Yen SUSHI Bistro and he looks at me, puzzled. Then I see that we have been charged $20 for the last course that we TWICE tried to send back. I speak to the manager who tells me "if Yasu wants to charge you for it, he will charge you for it." I kid you not. All in all each course was mercilessly over-worked, only average and Yasu is on a major ego trip. Don't waste your time and money here.

I shouldn't give this place a two because the description says, "Meh.  I've experienced better."  Well, I haven't experienced better because this is my only experience with a male strip club.  

I should give this place a big fat ZERO because I'm pretty sure the bartender roofied me.  

Why do I think he roofied me?  Let me tell you.  

A friend of mine had her bachelorette party in Vegas and her maid of honor thought up this brilliant idea of making us all wear corsets- bridesmaids/friends in black and the bride in white.  Well, I'm rather busty, but luckily I saw my drunken future and prepared for the inevitable.  More about this later. 

So, we make The Olympic Garden our first stop and right away the guys bombard us.  They cornered us individually so that we couldn't consult on who everyone was buying lap dances for, and thus we all bought multiple lap dances for the same people.  This is when I learned that lap dances make me uncomfortable, especially if I haven't even had a damn drink yet.  I actually made the poor guy so uncomfortable he asked me if I was feeling ok.  I just don't find guys who kiss their own biceps while gyrating on top of me sexy... I find it funny and maybe a little sad, but not sexy.  

After I was dance raped, I made my way to the bar where I recognized the bartender.  My dad owned a bar and I knew this guy had totally worked for him (Note to self- my dad must be a real asshole if this guy did indeed roofie me [sorry daddy, but I'm sure you stopped reading at dance rape if for some reason you stumbled upon this review] and also, this is a small, small world).  So, I asked the guy and after finding out who I was he started pouring me shots.  I had about three the entire time we where there.  Trust me, I can handle three shots and this was all I had to drink for the rest of the night.  Not only that, but he was the only person who came in contact with these shots other than my mouth.  

This is where my memory gets fuzzy and eventually it just goes dark, but before I forget who I am I decide it'd be fun to call home and tell my dear old dad who I ran into.  Thank God my brother answered and screened the call.  I don't even know what I said to him, but he told me I was pretty out of it.  Last memory from here on out is an image of the limo pulling up and my friends piling in. 

The next day.  I wake up in my hotel room with a start.  I have no idea where I am at first.  I have no idea how I got there and I have no idea how I got out of the corset from last night.  This is where my friends and my boyfriend at the time fill me in.  Luckily, he just happened to be there for the bachelor party, but unfortunately my near death state forced him to miss out on all the stripper action.  Haha, sucker.  

So, apparently I was completely gone like I'd never been before.  I fell down multiple times in public places and even knocked a friend into an open trash can.  It was so bad that a security guy at MGM Grand offered me a wheelchair, but my friends were afraid he was just some random guy trying to molest me so they continued to lug me around.  I had horrible bruises all over my body the next day to prove just how embarrassing this all must have been.  Here is where my good planning for a drunken future comes in.  I knew that my corset had a tendency to slip, so I wore a lace cami underneath just in case I got too drunk to pay attention to wardrobe malfunctions.  This proved rather smart because all the falling down pulled my corset right off of you know what.  If I hadn't been wearing that cami I would have looked like I was dressed for a topless review. 

I also puked in a cab at some point.  The cab driver started yelling in another language and a girl I barley knew caught my freakin' throw up in her hands.  IN HER HANDS! 

Once they got me to the room, I was completely out.  I mean, dead to the world.  Well, until I guess one girl got on my nerves enough to wake me out of my stupor.  My friends told me she was complaining about everyone wanting to wait around a bit to make sure I was okay.  So, I popped my head up long enough to say, "Be cool, bitch."  That was the last thing I would do or say until the morning.

My poor boyfriend got wind of the state I was in and said I looked like a dead person when he went up to check on me.  He missed out on the rest of the night for fear I would stop breathing.  Apparently, I was completely non-responsive.  

The next day, I wanted to kill myself.  I have never felt a hangover like that in my entire life.  It was HORRIBLE.  

In conclusion, I have no way of knowing what was in those drinks.  All I know is that no amount of binge drinking ever rendered me completely unconscious and without memory of an entire night worth of events.  Everything after leaving the strip club is like a dark hole in my memory- it's just blank, as if the rest of the night didn't even exist.

P.S.  I highly identified with The Hangover... for obvious reasons.

Cost - FREE!

I am from Vegas, so like anyone else that is, or lived here long enough, you more than likely came here for a field trip with school, summer camp or simply with family and friends over the years. We are the ones who know what to expect from the Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden, so the overpriced chocolates and hot chocolate don't phase us because we know better not to "buy" into that part of the experience. For everyone else, you will learn your lesson once and always know better from there on out, or maybe not? I personally think that locals and tourists see Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden differently and both have specific reasons for going. This is why the prices of what's for sale and size of the tour will not cause me to give a lower rating.

This isn't a place you will be spending a lot of time, so don't plan for it to be an all day event. The chocolate factory and cactus garden are self-guided tours, so absolutely go at your own pace and take in all that you can or you might blink and it will be over. When I first walked into the chocolate factory, I noticed they have a small version of M&M's World now which surprises me they took this long to put that wall of M&M's in priced at $8.99 per pound. All I can figure is people want to say they had M&M's at the actual plant in Vegas and maybe that's why they pay it. If you just ask an employee they will let you pick a color and have a sample, which is free! They are pretty good about letting you try stuff if you just ask. Then you will know if it is something you would actually buy. 

The chocolate tour isn't long. You just walk down a hallway, one side having windows so you can see the equipment and if you come during the day, when the chocolate is being made, you will see it all going down in action. You can read stuff they have posted about how they make certain chocolates and what some of the machines do. At the end of the hallway is what most us came here for. FREE CHOCOLATE! There is usually a sweet lady waiting with free chocolate, but today she was not there! Oh no! Oh well lol. After the chocolate tour, you end up in the gift shop (of course!) where you can purchase a variety of sweet goodies they have to offer which includes a sugar-free section. I always walk through the gift shop to the exit since I don't buy anything and always stop at 7-11 before coming here to get hot chocolate. The hot chocolate here cost $4.95 and is smaller sized. 

The cactus garden is beautiful all year, but when it comes to Christmas time it is simply magical! There are over 300 species of plants and most of them are covered in lights. The lights are done a little different each year because of the growth of the plants, which makes for a bit of something new and not just the same ole thing every time. So many of the plants are covered in lights that I am one of those people that wonder every year "why didn't they fill in that spot?". I saw an article about the guy who is in charge of the lights each year and he mentioned that they have to know their limits. Some branches might break or a cactus might fall over he mentioned if lights were put on them. Makes sense! I will not wonder anymore! If you are lucky you might catch Santa and get to take a picture with him or if he isn't, you can still sit in his chair and take a picture. If you are one of those people (like me) who spends one night during the Christmas season going on a tour of the best decorated houses in town (you can get a current list each year of neighborhoods participating from local radio, paper and news sites) then you should add Ethel M Chocolate Factory and Cactus Garden to your list. It is just like stopping by to see a really nicely decorated house, but it's tons of colorfully and beautifully lit plants. It's free and a fun memory for the whole family!

When you combine the quality of ingredients, service and tremendous value, Soho is a place worth coming back to again and again.  Dinner for 4 came out to around $60 before tip and we got to try a nice variety of dishes.

It was easy to see and taste the high grade fish they used right off the bat in the "Seared Tuna Special" which included crispy shallots, sweet onion, micro greens and chili oil combined with super fresh nigiri cuts of maguro.  This was a terrific mix of flavors.  $11!  That's about 50% off the strip price.  I almost wished I didn't have to share it.  

I couldn't turn my back on the $3 (!!) Soho Tostadas and went with the tuna with Hawaiian poke sauce.  The tostada itself was made of taro and there were some delicious chunks of tuna on top mixed with cilantro and avocado cream.  Another great starter for sure.  The rock shrimp done tempura style was also nice portion for $7 and came with 3 unique sauces that I fail to remember the details of since my wife was seriously sweating the end of the Seahawks/Rams Monday night game due to some sports bets she had.  It was nice they had one TV up.

Hydro Bibb Black Cod for $5 was a total freakin tease that ensured I'll get a full order of miso marinated black cod the next time.  Even the smaller portioned cod were cooked really well and the combo of cool lettuce, crispy wontons and fish was kind of like a deluxe protein taco.  

Those all were excellent opening acts for what I was personally here for which was the short rib dish.  Ever since I saw that one picture of all those short ribs being grilled, I knew it was destiny!  It totally delivered.  The one rib was like something out the The Flintstones and tasted as good as it looked.  It was juicy and so tender that you could've just picked at it with chopsticks sans fork and knife.  

The chef and owner of Soho, John Chien Lee, stopped by our table to ask how things were and gave us a breakdown on the business.  We were still open to one more dish so I asked him for a recommendation.  He asked what we liked and we said salmon.  He asked if we wanted something cooked or raw and we said raw.  He said he'd make something special for us off the menu (YES!) and 10 minutes later brought over this delectable dish with 8 pieces of scallop wrapped with salmon topped with a little green, lemon and some other stuff I can't remember.  John whipped up this dish thinking it would be a great finish to the meal after the heaviness of the short rib and MAN was he right.  Then he told us it was on the house!  Thanks, John!!  I suck for not taking photos of anything.  

Las Vegas strip quality for locals!  Check it out.

I attempted Cafe Zupas on opening day and the line was so long out the door that I decided to wait. It was worth it! Cafe Zupas is kind of like Panera Bread, serving sandwiches, soups, salads and bakery stuff. The only thing different is Cafe Zupas is much fresher and tastier! 

When you first walk in they have large easy to read menu boards. You place your order telling them what you want on what, pay for your food and find a table where your food is brought out to you. They have a pretty good amount of seating offering tables as well booths. 

Sandwiches by themselves are $4.99 each, salads by themselves are $4.99 for the half size and $6.99 for the large size, soups are $3.99 for the half size and $5.99 for the large size.

There is a  "Try 2 Combo" priced at $7.99 where you can pick from two of the following:
- Whole Sandwich
- Half Soup
- Half Salad 

I ordered the "Honey Bacon Club" and "Summer Chicken Salad" from the try 2 combo. The portion size was great. The honey bacon club is a grilled panini with turkey, ham, bacon, tomatoes, muenster cheese and honey mustard. So good! I will order this one again for sure. The summer chicken salad has chicken, fresh strawberries, cashews, dried cranberries, grapes, mixed greens and strawberry vinaigrette dressing. The salad tasted to fresh and yummy! They have over a dozen salads to choose from so there is a nice variety to choose from each time. A really nice touch was the chocolate covered strawberry that came complimentary with my meal! Hubby got one with his too! Hubby ordered a "Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup" that was put of this world delicious! I ended up getting a spoon and sharing it with him it was just so good. The soup is whole heads of cauliflower blended together with cheddar and pepper jack cheese. Bacon was added for an additional 59 cents. Fresh bread also comes with the meal so it was nice to dip in the soup!

So I saw a dessert in the case that called my name. It was the "Sinful 7 Chocolate Cake" priced at $4.49 and I got it to-go. This cake is any true chocolate lovers dream come true! It lives up to it's name and is sinfully good.

The drink bar offers 16 different fountain drinks with free Italian Soda flavorings. If you have a device that needs some juice then you can take advantage if the recharge bar. They do offer catering, but if they offer online ordering I didn't see anything about it. There is a sign that says they do not take tips, but will gladly clean up your dishes (yep they use real dishes) and table when you are finished. The customer service was fantastic and the inside was very clean. I will be back!

I had my hopes up for this place. Walking in it seemed like a fun atmosphere, but quickly it felt like more of a tourist attraction. From the start our server was trying to get us to buy raffle tickets. It didn't stop there. When she would check on us, she was saying things like "if you like the taste of that, we sell it in our gift shop" and at the end of the meal even asked if she could walk with us to the gift shop (we told her that we didn't want to go earlier and thanked her for the info) to pick somethings out so she could meet her goal since she was in the lead for some sort of competition with the other employees for work. To put people on the spot so many times is rude. Ask once and if the customer is interested they will tell you! 

What encouraged us to come here was because I have family here in town that is hosting an exchange student from Germany and I thought she would not only like this place, but maybe feel a bit of home. We sat at nice long table that is shared with the other customers. I don't personally like that, but that's the theme here so it was fine. There was live music being played which was cool. 

Priced at $19.99 we started out with the "Sausage Tower" at the suggestion of our server. She said it was a "hidden" menu item since it isn't on the menu and it would give us a good taste of the different sausages they have. Sounded good to me! When it arrived, it looked like a tower of heaven. There were 3 dishes. 1 dish had chicken bratwurst, pork sausage and veal bratwurst on a bed of sauerkraut. The 2nd dish had krainer, grilled weisswurst and a frankfurter with potato salad. The 3rd dish had 2 fresh baked pretzels with 2 types of dipping sauces. Of all the sausages I only really liked the taste of a couple of them, so it was nice to be able to sample it all instead of just ordering a certain sausage dish that I might have had a type of sausage in it that I wasn't to find of. The pretzels were pretty good and the mustard sauces had good flavor. For my meal I had priced at $4.95 a "House Salad" and priced at $14.95 the "Grillhendl" which is a chicken dish. The salad was average, but the chicken dish was above average. The chicken was roasted and stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions. The chicken was crispy and had a good flavor. It also came with a side of potato salad that was decent. 

I certainly didn't leave hungry! I didn't leave feeling like I would come back though either. The vibe inside just screamed "gimmick" and "tourist attraction here" which our guest from Germany agreed. The server was just too pushy about trying to get us to buy different things. My husbands meal was a joke especially for the price, so I lucked out with the chicken dish I ordered. I'm glad I experienced Hofbruhaus at least once.

I bought a yelp deal ($10 for $20) a few months back for this place not knowing they weren't open yet. Kind of frustrating that they would post the deal and not even be open, but it did say at the bottom of the yelp listing it was "coming soon" so I will take the blame. Their Facebook page said they would be opening the following month, but that never happened. I reached out to Caf Casera by e-mail to see if they had any updates on when they would be opening. The owner responded promptly and said they were working out some last minute things and should be open soon and they would let me know when they opened. The owners word was kept, I received a e-mail letting me know they were opening and ready for customers. It took me a couple weeks after receiving the e-mail to make my way over, but with as long as I waited already what was a couple more weeks? 

Walking in hubby and I were greeted and given menus right away. originally, we planned to eat inside the restaurant, but the fountain machine wasn't set up yet and they only had cans of soda ($1) and bottled water ($1.25) so we decided to order our food to-go and get drinks from a gas station. What a bummer because they had Cherry Coke! I spoke with one of the owners, Julie who said they were waiting for the "Coke man" to come hook it up. I had a wonderful conversation with Julie who also introduced me to her husband and mother-in-law. I could tell while talking to Julie, just how genuinely passionate her and her family are about the food they are serving. She told me how they are there at 5 am each morning making everything from scratch including the corn and flour tortillas that are all personally made by her mother-in-law. 

Some of the menu items here will be something you have seen before at other restaurants, but I promise you Caf Casera puts there own twist on each dish and I personally haven't ever tasted anything like it. I have never heard of "Sizzle" which is the specialty here, so I obviously had to try it! 

Sizzle Tacos ($7.95) - Seasoned ground pork and beef, onions, cabbage and cheese sauce inside 2 crunchy taco shells. The taco shells tasted amazing! They had such a fresh flavor and weren't greasy at all. The stuff inside the shell is an acquired taste for sure. I thought it was alright, but can't say I would order it again. Hubby took a bite and thought it was the best thing out of everything we ordered and he ended up switching me his Bean & Cheese Burrito for it. The burrito was so good! The flour tortillas here aren't your average flour tortilla, they are a bit thicker. The beans and rice were great. The beans are thick and the rice has a nice flavor, nothing dry or mushy about it.

Cheese Quesadilla ($2.25) - The menu says it is grilled with Colby cheese inside, but honestly it tasted more like Velveeta cheese. The cheese was very pasty. The tortilla was kind of burnt on the outside too. After two bites I was done, I just didn't like it. 

Sopaipilla ($2.75) - Yes! This was great. I have had different versions, but not one like this before. They put cinnamon and powdered sugar on it and it can easily be shared. It does have a sweet flavor, so if sweet things aren't your style you can try one plain. I enjoyed the sweet flavor and would order it again. 

As I sat there waiting for my food to be prepared, I noticed the menu boasted that the dishes were prepared with a "New Mexico Flair" so if you want green chile they can add it for 75 cents. It confused me because if the dish is prepared with New Mexico Flair, wouldn't it already have the green stuff in it? Julie was kind enough, because I forgot to order the chile on my tacos, to give me 2 free sides of it. This was awesome green stuff indeed! Hubby was just eating it with a fork, cold and all. I do wish the chile came warm and was already included with the food, since the food is prepared when you order it, a customer could just say they don't want it on there. Oh well they were gooooood!

The inside was very clean and the decor was nice. There are about 4 tables inside if you don't want to take your food to-go. Caf Casera also offers breakfast burritos on their menu. Purchase a yelp deal and give this family run business a try!

I noticed ZiKiZ while in the area a couple months ago and decided to bookmark it based on the positive reviews and the food sounded good. I met yelper Tracy P here for lunch and walking in we were greeted right away. The 2 men behind the counter were very friendly and told us about their menu. They said they specialized in customizing any order with what's offered on the menu. You pick if you want a wrap, salad or bowl (prices vary) and then pick what you want inside. They have chicken, steak, crab and falafel and a variety of veggies. 

Priced at $7.99 I ordered a "Chicken Wrap" with salad mix, red onion, black olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, ZiKiZ sauce and feta cheese (.50 cents extra for feta) inside a sundried tomato tortilla. I said that I would be eating the wrap inside, but would like the chicken on the side to-go. The guy looked at me kind of funny and said I needed to pick a protein to go into my meal. I looked funny back at him because he just told me a minute prior that they specialized in customizing any order, so what was the big deal with just putting the chicken on the side? I like the Greek Salad Wrap over at The Great Greek on Warm Springs and was hoping to create a wrap somewhat like that. I just said the chicken inside the wrap would be fine. My friend, Tracy had a coupon for $5 off any order over $20 which was a nice bonus. The guy accepted the coupon with no problem, but he majorly messed up when it came to ringing up our order. We wanted to add 2 sides and 2 drinks for an additional $2.99 each. He never asked us what sides we wanted and when we were looking over the menu deciding which ones we wanted, he says "oh I thought you'd want fries" and I was wondering why he was picking for us. I said no, we never asked for fries and don't want those, but we'd like to try the ZiKiZ rice. He then brought only 1 side of rice over and not the 2nd. Then he starts to talk to the next customer and we haven't even received our drink cups. I ask for them and he only hands 1 cup over. What the heck? We mentioned that we needed the other drink (deciding to just give up on the 2nd side we never received) and he just smiles and hands a cup over. I wasn't given a receipt, so I don't know how he charged me. I am thinking he didn't ring up the 2nd drink and side or something, but with the coupon our total was only $15 and some change, so not a bad price to try a new place out.   He did give the coupon back and said to save it to use again.

The rice was very bland. I really tasted no flavor and decided since it was in a container already to just take it home and give it to my dog with her dinner. The wrap was just average. I did like the taste of the tortilla, but the chicken really had no flavor and the veggies stood out more as far as flavor goes. With them not customizing my order the way I wanted, the food only tasting average, the mix up with sides and drinks and the food not being that great, I can't see coming back.

As i rubbed my overstuffed belly, dude said it's ok if i want to unbutton. I told him i unbuttoned already about 30 min ago!

Wowee, i think i consumed more food here that i did at the buffets. 
I brought my relatives here to treat them to a nice steak dinner, without breaking the bank. 
For restaurant week, they were doing a great deal (which is pretty much half of their power couple meal). For $50, you get a 3 course meal. Most of our table ordered that, while my dude and uncle just got their manly bone in Rib Eyes. The deal came with a Petit Filet and crabcake, along with salad and dessert. But ur allowed to tweak your meal and don't necessarily have to stick with the written options- a few items, u have to pay extra for. 
You start off with huge sesame seed bread served with butter. Not the best bread steak house bread i've had, but it was soft and yummy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=0BlIFseV-5Hd16I-PcRrXQ 

My Del's salad was awesome!. Mainly cuz it came with two huge pieces of delicious thick but crisp bacon on top!!! I got mine with an avocado dressing which was so good! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=Gl37AEprIq227kFoigLohw

The petit Filet was pretty filling and cooked nicely med rare.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=fNMin5UVASwyyFBm_eMUlg
The bone in Rib Eye was good as well, dude loved it as he's had it before. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=HyA9h7GFL35u0YrUgi3uvg  It was good, but i felt it lacked that buttery char that i love on my rib eye. Mastros i say still does a better Bone In Rib eye. 

For sides, the staff comes around and spoons out the sides you ordered, which come in large portions that u could share them. 
I tried the spinach (creamy with bacon!), and mushrooms were ok. 
The baked potato looked good. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=_fxRw3wX86gejNGyy2rAWg

The crabcakes were pretty good. 
My uncle got the Salmon and said that the Tchoupitoulas sauce it came with was delicious and light. 
My aunt got the seared tuna steak- which was good but not great. She enjoyed the crab cake more. 

We all let out some gasps when we saw the humongous desserts!
We were too stuffed but couldn't resist the yummy looking desserts. 
The bread pudding was the best-  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=J4y4JWu2Kzjwv4Q_Ein0cQ
Strawberry cheesecake was huge and very cream cheesy than sweet 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=NiuW7t29bUx5BSZYH-8DKw
Chocolate mousse was delicious. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IT_4EEIbv6Ox1jBRMyE7pg?select=PU3xnSpdx9YjuOQpNiNikQ
One dessert, i think is big enough to share between 3 people, esp after having a huge dinner already. 

Service was outstanding. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and took his time explaining everything and made us all feel very comfortable. We saw atleast 10 different wait staff come to our table, either refilling our drinks (even after one sip!) or bringing out our dishes. 

I signed up for their rewards card which racks you up points for dollars spent for gift cards. They charge u an initial fee of $25.00 which they reinburse you in the form of a giftcard for later. You can also sign up online before going there, so you can use it on your first visit. Be sure to let them know of any b-days, as u will get a comped dessert!

SCAM!

Yes, that's right... I said "SCAM!"

The Spearmint Rhino has always been a place that's come up as one of the top strip clubs in Vegas. Of course I had to go check it out while in Vegas this weekend with my friend. 

First off, we knew about the free limo thing, but weren't able to work that one out. We ended up taking a cab and also paying the steep cover to get in. On the surface, this joint made a decent first impression. A bevy of beautiful girls. You couldn't really go too wrong here looks-wise. Girls here are so consistently good looking, you would think you walked on to a strip club movie set. 

It didn't take long though before we started to see the cracks in the foundation here... and they run deep.

Before we could even take it all in, I get accosted and molested by this tall blond Eastern European girl who tried dragging me back to VIP. I had to say "no" half a dozen times and yank my arm away from her before she took the hint. 

She kept touching my dick through my pants while trying to pull me to the VIP lounge talking about 200 dollars and how I didn't want to sit at a table because it's no fun there. Well, maybe I like sitting in the main room having drinks and talking to people. Maybe I don't want to go have a private dance with a complete stranger. 

That shit is awkward. I would like to get to know someone a little bit first. What if I find out your personality is shit and then I'm stuck in the VIP room with some hot asshole and 200 bucks lighter? Plus, I don't really want some stranger touching my dick instead of a handshake... I suppose I'm weird that way. 

My friend and I walked around the club a few times looking for a seat. They let too many people in here. Absurdly too many. I was told to go talk to a guy up at the front if I wanted a seat. He put my name on his list and said he would try to find me something and to just keep checking back with him. I wandered around some more and had 3 more girls come up to me and touch my dick and try to drag me off to the back room. It got quite annoying rather quickly. Let me fucking sit down for 5 minutes. 

My friend and I decided to just sit at one of the two bars and have a drink while we wait. Another girl comes up to us and guilts me into buying her a drink. I hate that. I don't buy girls drinks at bars. I buy my date drinks. I buy my friends drinks. I don't buy strangers drinks because they are pretty... or in their bra and panties for that matter. 

She did turn out to be useful though because she informed me that if I don't give the guy at the door 100 bucks, I won't get a seat ever. She was kind enough to walk around the place with us looking for open seats. We ended up lucking out by asking a guy if we could sit at his table with him. It was a great spot too. Things were turning around for us. 

Then my friend asked the girl who ushered us around the club if he could buy our new friend a dance for sharing his table with us, and she said she didn't do $20 dances - she only did VIP. We all immediately lost interest in her and sent her away. That kind of attitude was just a buzzkill. 

This became the standard pretty much - it seemed that most girls there refused to give you a $20 dance on the floor, but would only go back to VIP. I don't want to go to VIP - it's creepy. I don't want to get any more intimate than just the standard lapdance. Looking around, we noticed very few dances on the floor going on - just a long-ass line to the VIP area. 

I even had one filthy blond scam artist liar tell me she was under contract and couldn't do $20 dances. She kept coming up to me throughout the night trying to drag me off to VIP. I kept saying I didn't want to go and she kept insisting. I felt like I was trying to wander off a used car lot and a sleazy salesman in a bra and panties wasn't letting me leave. 

I had a Larry David moment with this girl. She finally guilted me into going back to the room. She insists I give her the money first - her counting it took up the first song. Then she started doing the worst half-assed standard boring soulless yawn-inducing lapdance without going anywhere near my lap. I stopped her after about 30 seconds and told her I felt swindled and cheated. I wanted to leave and get my money back. 

Long story short - It became a big embarrassing ordeal for everyone, but the manager ended up giving me 40 bucks back. It was the principle of the thing for me at this point. We promptly left after this.

Spearmint Rhino has attractive girls, and some of them were actually nice. It's possible to have a good time. However, most girls here seem to only do the VIP room and scam you out of your cash. Drinks are overpriced, it's too dark inside, and they pack it so full it's standing room only. 

Arizona clubs give better dances for half the price, the girls don't act like they're too good for the job, and they let you get to know them a bit before you decide you want to go to the VIP lounge with them.

My hubby has a birthday coming up and he wants Texas de Brazil for his special dinner. Since we had been to TDB before, and not tried Via Brasil even though it is in our area, I figured we could give it a shot. I did have an A-OK experience, but I am glad it wasn't his actual birthday dinner or I would have been disappointed we didn't go to TDB. 

The "Rodizio" dinner is priced at $45.99 per person. A 50 plus item salad bar is included, and you get to try 18 different meats that meat carvers bring to your table on skewers. You can choose if you want what they have and how much. If pink meat isn't your thing, you can request any of the meat be cooked to to your liking. They give each person there own round paper disc that you turn to green when you are ready for more meat and then you turn it to red until you are ready for more or are simply done eating. I was impressed by the fact that the side dishes were included with the meal. They had like 16 to choose from and you can pick as many as you like. That is a nice touch! They ask that you tell them your sides when you first get there so they can start preparing them. 

So I am not a vegetarian at all, but I don't eat a whole lot of meat. Tonight was my night to shine as the carnivore I am not. I absolutely succeeded! I first went to the salad bar. I wasn't impressed. There were a lot a seafood options which is great, but not for someone like me who doesn't eat seafood. I didn't feel there was a lot of options for a salad however the veggies they did offer were fresh and delicious. I put some "Caprese Salad" on my plate and that was actually very good. As we finished up our salad, the sides we ordered arrived. The "White Rice" paired nicely with the "Sauteed Mushrooms" and the "Fried Banana" was good. Then the meats started coming! I have to admit that the "Top Sirloin" known as "Pichana" that they claim is the star of the meal was not good at all. The meat was tough and flavorless. The "NY Strip", and "Prime Rib" were the same, tough meat and flavorless. Then came the "Bacon Wrapped Turkey" and THAT is delicious. I'm a huge fan of bacon and the bacon really added a nice flavor to the turkey. Then came the "Garlic Filet and "Bacon Wrapped Filet and these two are the star of the meal to me. The filet was so tender and flavorful. I like my meat cooked well done so the server took note of that and made sure to bring me pieces with no pink. I liked my meal, but can't see coming back and paying full price again. Maybe if it were a deal they had going on or something. The meat at first was not good, and the salad bar was not great. I know this isn't TDB, but I do have to compare it because they both have the "churrascaria" thing going on. And the salad bar at TDB is worth just eating that alone. The sides were decent, but I only enjoyed a few types of the meat so I'd rather spend the extra to have TDB. 

There is a Happy Hour here at Via Brasil Monday - Sunday from 5-8 pm in the patio/bar. Every Sunday they have a "Sunday Brunch" from 10 am - 2 pm and have different specials for the brunch so you might want to call and ask if there is a theme for that day. They have several options for events and banquets too.

SHUT IT DOWN!

I was incredibly disappointed when we went to grab dinner here last night. Chef Ramsey would have been so upset at the lack of customer respect. It was like they really didn't care. And I found this unacceptable. 

The hostess took us to our table which was a very cool table but it was not very comfortable for our group to have dinner at. It was so low, that there was no way we could even eat or cut our meat. If we were just drinking then we would have hung out here all night. I asked the hostess for a booth, which was right next to the original table. 

She told me that the 4 empty booths were reserved and we couldn't sit there. I asked the hostess how embarrassed would she be if we sat at the uncomfortable table and no one showed up for those 4 booths in the next hour.  She ignored me and didn't respond. 

She then told me that this was the only table we could have. The sad part is that 60% of the tables were empty and she refused to seat us anywhere else.  I told her I wanted to speak to the manager. She went back to the hostesses station told the other girl and the second hostess rolled her eyes. Honestly I'm the customer.  I don't need to see that. The hostess made a phone call to the manager, who never picked up his phone.  She then went in the back and when she came back she gave us one of the booths we had requested. Wow! What changed?

First, why did it take me 10 minutes to get a booth in a restaurant that was only 40% full. Secondly, I asked to speak to the manager and the manager never came out. Why? Completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Really where is the manager and why didn't he come over to talk to us. 

On a side note: At 10:22pm, we were seated and at 12:19am the booths were still empty.  In fact, nobody ever sat in any of those booths for almost 2 hours. It became apparent that the hostess completely lied to us by telling us they were reserved. Who is training the staff to act like this?

Plus we sat at our table with no service for about 10 minutes. I believe the hostesses probably thought it was funny to send no one over.  We all discussed leaving but decided to stay. 

At 11:52pm all of the lights went full blast, during our meal. It was so bright it hurt our eyes. I spoke to the guy cleaning the tables and he went to speak to the manager and the lights went back down after 5 minutes.  We were just trying to finish our dinner. He came back and said, "the manager had no idea who turned all the lights on!" I think the manager might need a visit from GR and he may have his lights turned on. The waitress told us the lights go full blast every night at that time. I think it must be on a timer, like last call for alcohol. But it should not blast all the lights in the dinning areas. It was not a fun feeling as we ate our dinners. 

My first drink didn't look like the picture in the iPad menu. And I was told by the waitress that the drinks never look like the photos in the iPad. Then why do we have photos of the drinks in the iPad? Again this is wrong and not right. GR would be screaming at someone. 

I went to order another drink at 12:00am but was informed that the bar was closed. I said really and why didn't someone tell us it was last call. There was no response. I told the waitress that I was just having a wheat beer and it shouldn't be a problem to pour a pint. All the bartenders were still there. She went to ask and came back with my pint but I noticed that the Orange slice was missing and about an inch of beer was also missing.  I asked where was the orange slice (this beer is suppose to come with it) and I was told that it was wrapped in Saran Wrap and put away. I asked her to grab me a slice and she said that it wouldn't be possible. Why is this dinner so painful?

I'm so mad that I haven't even got to reviewing the food yet.  The best thing we had here was the fingerling potatoes. It was a side dish but it was the star of the show. My buddy was not happy with his lamb. It was covered in a cheese and he felt it was over powering. I liked my PEI mussels and clams but didn't love them. They came with chorizo, carmelized fennel and lemon zest. I've had better mussel dishes elsewhere. I will say that the shellfish was fresh and only two clams had some sand in them. 

Would I come back here again? Probably never! So you're saying there's a chance? I would only probably ever eat here if Chef Ramsey was actually here running it. This place needs to be on one of those Restaurant Rescue Food shows and its only been open 4 months. I was also informed by the staff that GR had only been there 5 times in the last 4 months, since this location opened. If that is true then, he really needs to spend some time here fixing the many issues. I think the loser of Hell's Kitchen might be running this place?

I let my love of GR influence my choice to stay! Next time I will follow my brain and not my heart. We should have all walked.
